Direct conflict between the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces and Syrian Arab Army has been rare during the country's seven-year civil war, but until now they have found themselves on opposite sides of the fight against ISIS as the Kurds were backed by the US and Assad was supported by Russia. However, after Trump dropped American support for the Kurds and handed over control of regional security to Turkey - which considers Kurdish militias to be terrorists - they have been forced to seek support elsewhere. As part of the deal, brokered by Russia, the SDF agreed to hand over control of the border towns of Manbij and Kobane which it has ruled over for the last five years in exchange for help battling Erdogan's troops. However, as the conflict deepens it is likely that Assad's forces will occupy much of the territory now ruled by the Kurds as part of a defence force, and will be loathe to hand it back once the fighting is done. The deal means one of America's closest allies in the region is now fighting with assistance from Russia,and marks a big win for Assad in his attempts to regain complete control of Syria. The deal also pits Russia and Iran, which back Assad, against Turkey, despite the three countries spending months putting on a united front in the region.\n\nAmerica ordered its final 1,000 troops to withdraw from Syria 'as quickly and safely as possible' on Sunday in the face of the Turkish advance, amid fears they will be accidentally targeted by Turkish artillery and airstrikes.\n\nA tweet by SANA, the Syrian army's news agency, on Monday said forces had entered the town of Tall Tamr and were ready 'to confront Turkish aggression'.\n\nThe Kurdish administration said in a statement on its Facebook page: 'In order to prevent and confront this aggression, an agreement has been reached with the Syrian government... so that the Syrian army can deploy along the Syrian-Turkish border to assist the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF).'\n\nIn their statement the Kurds said that the agreement struck with the Damascus government 'paves the way to liberate the rest of the Syrian cities occupied by the Turkish army such as Afrin', a majority Kurdish enclave in the northwest.\n\nThe strikes have led French President Emmanuel Macron to warn that Turkey's offensive risks creating an 'unsustainable humanitarian situation' in the region.\n\nMacron's office said France will take measures in coming hours to ensure the safety of alll its military and civilian personnel in northeastern Syria after an urgent defence cabinet meeting.\n\nFrance, which is part of the US-led coalition fighting Islamic State in the region, has special forces operating in the area.\n\nOn Sunday Turkish forces and their proxies pushed deeper into Syria, on the fifth day of the offensive, as Washington announced it was withdrawing its 1,000 troops from the country's north.\n\nFighting raged, as Turkish-backed forces made significant progress along the border, despite an international outcry over the operation which has killed dozens of civilians and fighters, and forced tens of thousands to flee their homes.\n\nIt came after a strike which killed at least ten as a convoy of journalists, aid workers and civilians was shelled by Turkish forces.\n\nThe convoy guarded by armed men was hit when it arrived in Ras al-Ain (Sari Kani), a border town that advancing Turkish-allied forces have seized.\n\nA neighbourhood on the edge of the town remains in the hands of Kurdish-led fighters.\n\nA spokesman for the Kurdish forces, said 11 were killed and 74 injured but it was not clear how many were civilians.\n\nA Syrian rebel tank carrying soldiers leaves their base near Tal Abyad, Syria, today, as a deal between the Kurdish administration and the Damascus government was announced\n\nMembers of Syrian National Army pose for a photo in the city center of Syria's Ras Al-Ayn district after it was cleared of PKK terror group and the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia\n\nImages of the attack showed the airstrike shatter an otherwise quiet street and footage shows bodies and severed limbs strewn in the street\n\nCasualties pour into Syrian hospitals as the Turkish border offensive continues with as many as 74 injured in today's convoy strike\n\nJournalists, including foreigners, were accompanying the convoy.

There were conflicting accounts on the outcome of the fighting.\n\nTurkey is facing threats of possible sanctions from the US unless it calls off the incursion. Two of its NATO allies, Germany and France, have said they are halting weapons exports to Turkey. The Arab League has denounced the operation.\n\nFrance said today it was 'worried' to hear of the report that hundreds of relatives of foreign jihadists had escaped.\n\nTrump sends $50million in emergency financial aid to Syria President Trump says he will send $50million in emergency financial aid for Syria as Turkey continues its attacks on Kurdish territory just one week after the president pulled US troops from the area. The money will be sent to assist human rights groups and other organizations to 'protect persecuted ethnic and religious minorities and advance human rights,' according to a statement released Saturday night by the Office of the Press Secretary. On Sunday, President Trump defended his decision to pull U.S. troops from Northern Syria, leaving the America's Kurdish allies to a Turkish invasion, calling it 'very smart' for the US to 'not be involved in the intense fighting along the Turkish Border, for a change.' 'Those that mistakenly got us into the Middle East Wars are still pushing to fight.They have no idea what a bad decision they have made. 'Why are they not asking for a Declaration of War?' he added. Trump spoke of the $50million in aid while at the Values Voters Summit's Faith, family and Freedom gala dinner Saturday night. 'Other presidents would not be doing that, they'd be spending a lot more money but on things that wouldn't make you happy,' he said. 'The U.S. condemns the persecution of Christians and we pledge our support to Christians all over.'\n\n'Of course we are worried about what could happen and that is why we want Turkey... to end as quickly as possible the intervention it has begun,' government spokeswoman Sibeth Ndiaye told France 3 television.\n\nThis was echoed by Germany as Chancellor Angela Merkel urged Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan over the phone to stop his country's military offensive.\n\nA statement by the Chancellery said regardless of 'legitimate Turkish security interests,' the military operation threatens to displace major parts of the local population.\n\nGermany says the offensive also threatens to destabilise the region and restrengthen the extremist Islamic State group.\n\nIt came as Vladimir Putin said all foreign troops should leave Syria unless the Syrian government asks them to stay.\n\nThe Russian president said in an interview with three Arabic television stations that was released Sunday that 'all foreign nations' should withdraw their troops unless they have been asked by the Syrian government to stay there.\n\nHe said Russia, which has a significant military presence there as well as an air and a naval bases, would also leave if President Bashar Assad asks it to.\n\nPutin, a staunch backer of Assad, stopped short of condemning Turkey for sending its troops across the border into northeastern Syria earlier this week, but said that other nations should respect Syria's sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n\nAnd the US appeared to oblige as it is now poised to evacuate about 1,000 US troops from northern Syria, Defence Secretary Mark Esper said in an interview today.\n\n'In the last 24 hours, we learned that [the Turks] likely intend to extend their attack further south than originally planned, and to the west,' Esper said in a pre-taped interview with CBS.\n\n'We also have learned in the last 24 hours that the ... SDF are looking to cut a deal, if you will, with the Syrians and the Russians to counterattack against the Turks in the north.'\n\nEsper called the situation 'untenable' for US forces, saying he spoke with Trump last night, and that the president directed the U.S. military to 'begin a deliberate withdrawal of forces from northern Syria.'\n\nAnkara launched the assault against the Kurdish YPG militia after Trump's first withdrawal of some US troops from the border region last week.\n\nIt says the YPG is a terrorist group aligned with Kurdish militants waging an insurgency in Turkey.\n\nTurkey's stated objective is to set up a 'safe zone' inside Syria to resettle many of the 3.6 million Syrian war refugees it has been hosting. President Tayyip Erdogan has threatened to send them to Europe if the EU does not back his assault.\n\nBut the Turkish incursion has raised international alarm over large-scale displacements of civilians and, amidst the upheaval, the possibility of Islamic State militants escaping from prisons run by the Kurdish-led authorities.\n\nTurkish forces have targeted the two Syrian border towns (pictured, a Ras-al-Ein today) with fresh shelling today, pressing on with their offensive against Kurdish militia for a fifth day in the face of fierce international opposition\n\nA photo taken from Turkey's Sanliurfa shows a flag of Syrian National Army being hung at the customs gate, located at Turkish border of the Tal Abyad town\n\nTurkey-backed Syrian rebel fighters sit together in the village of Yabisa, near the Turkish-Syrian border, on Sunday\n\nTurkish-backed rebels are pictured on Ain Issa Road on and tank and raising a gun in the air as they continue with Operation Peace Spring\n\nThe shelling of the camp at Ain Issa north of Raqqa represented 'support for the revival of the Daesh organisation once again', the Kurdish-led administration for northern and eastern Syria said, referring to Islamic State militants.

Pictured: An elderly woman is evacuated from a building in Akcakale\n\nThe Kurdish-led forces have been the main regional ally of the United States against Islamic State in Syria.\n\nThe Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) hold swathes of territory that was once part of Islamic State's 'caliphate'.\n\nThe SDF has been keeping thousands of IS jihadists in jail and tens of thousands of their family members in camps.\n\nSDF official Marvan Qamishlo said there were not have enough guards for the camp, which is north of Raqqa and about 20 miles south of the Turkish border.\n\n'The guarding is very weak now,' he said, adding there were now just 60-70 security personnel at the camp compared with a normal level of no less than 700 in the camp of 12,000 people.\n\nAlong the front lines, Turkish forces and Syrian rebels entered Suluk, some 6 miles from Turkey's border, the Observatory said on Sunday.\n\nTurkey's state-owned Anadolu news agency said the rebels seized complete control of Suluk. But the SDF's Qamishlo said SDF forces had repelled the attack and were still in control.\n\nTurkish-backed Syrian rebels (pictured today) advanced into Ras al Ain on Saturday.

Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said OCHA and other relief agencies estimated up to 400,000 civilians in the Syrian conflict zone may require aid and protection in the coming period.\n\nTurkish-backed Syrian fighters take position on top of a building in the southwestern neighbourhoods of the border town of Tal Abyad today\n\nTurkey's stated objective is to set up a 'safe zone' inside Syria (pictured, a Turkish police vehicle on patrol near the border) to resettle many of the 3.6million Syrian war refugees it has been hosting. Erdogan has threatened to send them to Europe if the EU does not back his assault\n\nErdogan has dismissed the growing international condemnation of the military operation, saying Turkey 'will not stop it, no matter what anyone says'.\n\nIn the latest criticism, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson told Erdogan the offensive may worsen the humanitarian situation and undermine progress towards weakening Islamic State, urging an end to the operation.\n\nTurkey's Defence Ministry said on Sunday 480 YPG militants had been 'neutralised' since the operation began, a term that commonly means killed. The SDF said 76 of its fighters have been killed.\n\nThe Observatory said 104 SDF fighters, 76 Turkey-backed rebels and 52 civilians had been killed in the conflict.\n\nIn Turkey, 18 civilians have been killed in cross-border bombardment, Turkish media and officials say.\n\nPeople watch from Akcakale, Sanliurfa province, southeastern Turkey, as smoke billows from fires on targets in Tel Abyad, Syria, caused by bombardment by Turkish forces today\n\nThe SDF on Saturday urged the U.S.-led coalition to close air space to Turkish jets, saying SDF fighters were 'being martyred by Turkish warplanes in front of the eyes of the allies'.\n\nIslamic State claimed responsibility for a car bomb on Friday in Qamishli, the largest city in the Kurdish-held area, where some IS militants fled from a jail.\n\nOn Saturday Trump defended his decision to withdraw troops in the Syrian border region, telling conservative Christian activists that the United States should prioritise protecting its own borders.\n\n'Let them have their borders, but I don't think our soldiers should be there for the next 50 years guarding a border between Turkey and Syria when we can't guard our own borders at home,' Trump said in a speech in Washington.\n\nThe SDF accused Turkey-backed rebels of killing a Kurdish politician in a road ambush on Saturday. The rebel force denied it, saying it had not advanced that far.\n\nThe Syrian Observatory said Turkey-backed groups had killed nine civilians on the road, including Hervin Khalaf, co-chair of the secular Future Syria Party.", "description": "Turkey's President Erdogan said that 'we are about to implement our decision on Manbij' on Monday as his tanks massed nearby, even as Assad's forces rolled into the area.", "authors": ["Chris Pleasance", "Jack Newman For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/11/19685004-0-image-a-96_1571047960776.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
