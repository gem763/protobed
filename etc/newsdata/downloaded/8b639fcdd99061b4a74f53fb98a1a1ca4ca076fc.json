It doesn\u2019t matter that we\u2019ve won eight on the bounce and they\u2019re struggling. It\u2019s Man United v Liverpool.\n\n(Image: 2019 Liverpool FC)\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll be wanting to kick-start their season and for them, there would be no better time to do it than against us.\n\n\"I\u2019m absolutely sure that they will be firing.\u201d\n\nRobertson though, also warned that the intensity of the \u2018M62 derby\u2019 will also inspire Liverpool, and pump them up just as much in a fixture he says both sets of players relish.\n\n(Image: EMPICS Sport)\n\nThere is no love lost between the two clubs and their cities, and the Liverpool defender argues there can be no room for a post international-break slump from his side, as they look to equal an incredible Premier League record.\n\nVictory at Old Trafford would match Manchester City 's mark of 18 straight wins, and he said: \u201cWe have our own objectives and our own aims. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve got to be striving for.\n\n\u201cI think what makes it so special is that it\u2019s historic. There have been such great battles down the years. Always top teams who have always fought against each other for everything on the pitch.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s genuinely a different atmosphere when you play against them. there is always an edge to it, a proper game and, sometimes, it gets played like a cup tie.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\u201cBut everyone is just so focused on what we\u2019re trying to do with Liverpool as a team, we are very driven to succeed.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re so focused on getting right back into our stride for the next big Liverpool game.\n\n\"That\u2019s especially true this week, because it\u2019s Man United away.\u201d\n\nJoel Matip declared himself fit for the Old Trafford visit after coming through training yesterday, and Alisson is also ready to return after two months out.\n\nMo Salah continued with his tailored rehab plan and remains in contention.", "description": "Liverpool head to Old Trafford on Sunday with eight wins from eight - and their great rivals struggling", "authors": ["David Maddock", "Image", "Liverpool Fc", "Empics Sport", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20322832.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Sheffield-United-v-Liverpool-Premier-League-Bramall-Lane.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
