BRBR, +0.00%, a spinoff from Post Holdings Inc. POST, -2.29% that makes PowerBar-branded snacks, priced its initial public offering at $14 a share Wednesday evening, lower than its projected range. BellRing announced that it plans to sell about 34.3 million shares at that price, after originally stating the intention to sell 30 million shares at a price of $16 to $19 a share. That sale would bring in roughly $480 million, though underwriters - led by Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs - have access to an additional 5.14 million shares. BellRing shares are expected to begin trading Thursday morning on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol BRBR.", "description": "BellRing Brands Inc. , a spinoff from Post Holdings Inc. that makes PowerBar-branded snacks, priced its initial public offering at $14 a share Wednesday...", "authors": ["Jeremy C.
