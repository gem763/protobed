Our challenge is to play our game and try to entice them into playing some Japanese rugby.\u201d\n\nSouth Africa won the tactical battle by a wide margin when the two sides last met, the Springboks beating Japan 41-7 in a World Cup warm-up match last month.\n\nBut then the hosts notched up four wins from as many matches to win their pool and Brown said the warm-up against South Africa was no longer relevant.\n\n\u201cIt was a warm-up game, both teams had different things in mind around preparing for the World Cup,\u201d Brown said. \u201cWe definitely played a style of game that wasn\u2019t around playing for South Africa, it was around playing for the World Cup.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the game is going to have any effect on what happens tomorrow (Sunday).\u201d\n\nOne Japanese player who could be the target of the far larger Springboks is diminutive scrumhalf Yutaka Nagare, who stands at just 165 centimetres tall.\n\nNagare said he was ready for the challenge.\n\n\u201cThey will come at us head-on,\u201d said Nagare. \u201cWe know, as you can see from their line-up, they\u2019ll look to make it a forward battle, play a physical game.\n\n\u201cWe need to fight properly there of course but it\u2019s important to play the ball smartly and make it a quick battle.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019ll definitely lose if I go head-on,\u201d he added. \u201cI have to use my technique given I\u2019m small ... and I feel they\u2019ll look to attack me in the next game, as well as near the try-line.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019ve decided to go in determined to play with pride for this team. I\u2019ll keep my mind strong. I\u2019ll take them on carrying both mind and technique.\u201d", "description": "Japan will focus on playing their own brand of rugby against the physical game of South Africa in Sunday's Rugby World Cup quarter-final, the hosts' attack coach Tony Brown said on Saturday.", "authors": ["Jack Tarrant", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191019&t=2&i=1442625944&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9I07S-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
