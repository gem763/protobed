The other guy, Haskins, is playing for the Washington Redskins, the organizational equivalent of a drunken bar car.\n\nAs was clear early in their 24-3 loss to the Giants at Met Life Stadium, they are a team careening noisily down the track careless of their destination, full of sloppy passengers with neckties askew. By the time Coach Jay Gruden put Haskins in to replace a sore-footed Case Keenum for his rookie debut just before halftime, the Redskins were down 14-0 and there was no reversing or excusing this clumsy, jersey-grabbing, tackle-whiffing performance.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s see, how do I explain it?\u201d a clipped-worded, sarcastic, job-imperiled Gruden said afterward.\n\nThe offense, with four turnovers, and a pitiful just two-for-11 performance on third downs, was \u201cpretty much inept in all phases.\u201d Of a dozen yellow penalty flags, Gruden said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on.\u201d Asked who the quarterback will be next week or in the future, Gruden said, \u201cWe\u2019ll worry about tomorrow, tomorrow.\u201d If there is one for him.\n\nDwayne Haskins not assured of Redskins starting job after rocky debut\n\nAs for owner Daniel Snyder\u2019s thoughts about all of it, those were impenetrable behind the black shades he wore even as he stalked through the dark indoor stadium tunnel afterward, muttering in a low staccato stream to his general manager Bruce Allen, who bent low to his ear.\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s hard to envision Haskins or anyone else succeeding in these circumstances, given what\u2019s been built, and not built, around him. Haskins turned in a decidedly underwhelming individual performance, with three interceptions to a handful of nice completions, and some effective scrambling. It\u2019s impossible to put the performance into context and judge his long-term potential, since it comes amid such a team-wide malaise. Maybe it was a mercy that he was so blithely, youthfully unaware of just what a mess he\u2019s in. \u201cWe\u2019re going to keep getting better and that\u2019s not happening again,\u201d Haskins said.\n\nAD\n\nThe only proper conclusion to draw from his performance is that Gruden was entirely right when he said last week that, right now, it\u2019s better for Haskins to \u201csit back and learn.\u201d This is such a poor, dispirited outfit that no quarterback change will make them decidedly better, or worse, in the space of a week, especially with the undefeated New England Patriots coming up.\n\nInstead, dysfunction and disagreement will likely continue to brew on the inside about whether Haskins should play or not. There was a hint of that in the snap of Gruden\u2019s voice, when he was asked who will start henceforth, given that Haskins is management\u2019s anointed future of the franchise. Keenum has been ineffective and Colt McCoy is still hobbling on a surgically repaired broken leg, and that may give Snyder and Allen the temptation they need to push for their draft choice.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got to earn that right first,\u201d Gruden said sharply. \u201cI don\u2019t care when you\u2019re drafted, you have to earn that. He\u2019s got to come in here and perform when he\u2019s asked to perform.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMake no mistake: Haskins is not ready to perform on command yet. He started just 14 games before coming out of Ohio State, as opposed to the 36 that Daniel Jones started at Duke under David Cutcliffe. Jones, too, had his rough moments during Sunday\u2019s game, including two consecutive interceptions, but he has a better cast around him and overall better recognition of what\u2019s coming his way. \u201cHe\u2019s smarter than me,\u201d Shurmur says. Haskins simply doesn\u2019t have the wherewithal to avoid mistakes, nor does his team have the support system to cushion him from them.\n\nThe key moments from Washington\u2019s 24-3 loss to the Giants\n\nThe Redskins are not just a losing team, they are a mysteriously demoralized one. Sure, it\u2019s terrible bad luck that they lost some key players in the first quarter of the season. They were playing with a backup center and right guard, given injuries to Chase Roullier and Brandon Scherff, not to mention a left tackle they signed off the street during training camp when Trent Williams\u2019s holdout began. Their list of wounded also includes tight end Jordan Reed, running back Derrius Guice, and nascent new star receiver Terry McLaurin. \u201cWe\u2019ve got some pretty good players who are not here,\u201d Gruden said.\n\nAD\n\nBut that\u2019s not really a legitimate excuse, not in this league. Injuries are where well-built teams emerge and separate from the bad ones. They find competent third stringers culled from low rounds of the draft or undrafted free agents. You know who else has suffered some key injuries? The Giants. They were playing without their brilliant running back Saquon Barkley, sidelined by an ankle sprain. They still managed to rush for 164 yards, behind reserve Wayne Gallman Jr. and a fourth-stringer \u2014 yes fourth \u2014 in Jon Hilliman. They \u201cstepped in with a heavy load, and did a really nice job,\u201d Shurmur said.\n\nAD\n\nThe Redskins never have a coherent plan, only round-robins of backstabbing and blame-shifting, repetitive cycles that culminate in crisis seasons with lame-duck coaches like this one, which has 3-13 written all over it.\n\nAnd the players know it. These are professionals who have reputations and future contracts at stake, and yet they have seemed utterly unwilling to muster a modicum of consistency against any opponent during this 0-4 start. That suggests a couple of things. One, they don\u2019t care what this coaching staff and front office thinks of them. And two, they don\u2019t seem inclined to pour any more wasted effort into this dark hole. It\u2019s just as well not to infect a kid with all this losing and embarrassment.\n\nFor more by Sally Jenkins, visit washingtonpost.com/jenkins.\n\nRead more on the Washington Redskins:\n\nJay Gruden\u2019s future remains uncertain after Redskins\u2019 latest dismal loss against the Giants\n\nOf Redskins\u2019 problems, their NFL-worst third-down defense might be most glaring\n\nDwayne Haskins wants no part of debate over who should start for Redskins: \u2018I can control what I can control\u2019\n\nAD", "description": "Washington\u2019s rookie quarterback is not going to save the team\u2019s season, which has 3-13 written all over it.", "authors": ["Sally Jenkins", "Sports Columnist"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/dOjBXOl14qW-XFfrDUVpbhGwwoY=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/37RMJMHC7EI6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
