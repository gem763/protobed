REUTERS/Regis Duvignau\n\n(Reuters) - Mylan NV (MYL.O) will pay a $30 million civil fine to settle U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charges it concealed a possible loss related to a federal probe on whether it overcharged Medicaid by hundreds of millions of dollars for sales of its EpiPen Auto-Injector.\n\nThe SEC accused Mylan of misleading investors by failing to disclose or set aside money for the two-year probe by the U.S. Department of Justice before it announced a $465 million settlement in 2016.\n\nAccording to the SEC, Mylan\u2019s misclassification of EpiPen, which is used to treat severe allergic reactions, as a \u201cgeneric\u201d drug allowed the company to pay much lower rebates to the government than if it were classified as a \u201cbranded\u201d drug.\n\nMylan did not admit or deny wrongdoing in agreeing to settle. In a statement, the company called the settlement \u201cthe right course of action.\u201d", "description": "Mylan NV will pay a $30 million civil fine to settle U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charges it concealed a possible loss related to a federal probe on whether it overcharged Medicaid by hundreds of millions of dollars for sales of its EpiPen Auto-Injector.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190927&t=2&i=1434560037&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8Q14C", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
