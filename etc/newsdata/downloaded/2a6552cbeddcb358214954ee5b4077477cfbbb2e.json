The S&P 500 dipped 0.20% to 2,989.69. The Nasdaq Composite slid 0.30% to 8,124.18. The major indexes were little changed for most of the session as weak consumer data offset the impact of strong earnings.\n\nRetail sales slump\n\nU.S. retail sales unexpectedly dropped 0.3% in September as households cut spending on autos and online shopping, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. The weak data added to already growing concerns over the possibility of a recession. This was enough to overshadow the release of strong corporate earnings results. Bank of America and United Airlines posted solid gains on better-than-forecast profits alongside Bank of New York Mellon.\n\nMcKesson and Bank of America climb, Adobe slides\n\nMcKesson shares rose 4.83% and were among the best-performing S&P 500 components after The Wall Street Journal reported state and local officials could reach a settlement with the drug distributor. Bank of America's strong earnings boosted the bank's stock by 1.48%. Meanwhile, a downgrade pushed Adobe shares down 2.39%.\n\nWhat happens next?", "description": "Disappointing U.S. retail sales data offset strong earnings to push the major stock indexes lower.", "authors": ["Fred Imbert"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105553315-1541444165928gettyimages-591961918.jpeg?v=1541444181", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
