Says, \u201cWe do have freedom of speech, but there can be a lot of negatives that come with that too.\u201d Really. pic.twitter.com/ZTw6a3FZ5n \u2014 Clay Travis (@ClayTravis) October 15, 2019\n\nAll joke, no woke. This is the same guy who tweeted this?\n\n-Injustice Anywhere Is A Threat To Justice Everywhere- Our Lives Begin To End The Day We Become Silent About Things That Matter- #ThankYouMLK50 \u2014 LeBron James (@KingJames) January 15, 2018\n\nLeBron later took to Twitter to \u201cclear up the confusion,\u201d but as you can say, he just made it worse:\n\nLet me clear up the confusion. I do not believe there was any consideration for the consequences and ramifications of the tweet. I\u2019m not discussing the substance. Others can talk About that. \u2014 LeBron James (@KingJames) October 15, 2019\n\nGuys, the multi-millionaire had a \u201ctough week.\u201d Thoughts and prayers, LeBron:\n\nMy team and this league just went through a difficult week. I think people need to understand what a tweet or statement can do to others. And I believe nobody stopped and considered what would happen. Could have waited a week to send it. \u2014 LeBron James (@KingJames) October 15, 2019\n\nKeep in mind this is all Morey tweeted and that\u2019s what set China off:\n\nReminder that this was the extent of Daryl Morey's tweet pic.twitter.com/hmSw3M1TaL \u2014 Peter J. Hasson (@peterjhasson) October 15, 2019\n\nAnd, LeBron, we\u2019re not confused:\n\nlol there's no confusion https://t.co/YrtiTN2Y3Y \u2014 your pal andy (@andylevy) October 15, 2019\n\nWe are so sorry for your pain. Not as sorry as those imprisoned in Chinese re-education camps, but pretty sorry. \u2014 Nick Searcy, INTERNATIONAL THOUGHT LEADER & STAR (@yesnicksearcy) October 15, 2019\n\nLeBron to the NBA: \u201cSHUT UP AND DRIBBLE\u201d:\n\nWhat happened to Lebron James? When Laura Ingraham told him to \"shut up and dribble\" I defended him. But now he essentially tells everyone in the NBA to \"shut up and dribble\" because an actual tyrannical government in China is making him richer. Hypocrite @KingJames. \u2014 Carmine Sabia (@CarmineSabia) October 15, 2019\n\nKeep in mind, Morey has an MBA from MIT, so he\u2019s not exactly \u201cuneducated\u201d:\n\nIs it elitist to point out Daryl Morey went to both Northwestern & MIT, when LeBron calls him uneducated? I feel like that\u2019s a woke twitter move. You have to be ashamed and never mention your degrees. But seriously..I feel as though Morey is profoundly more educated on this. \u2014 Britt McHenry (@BrittMcHenry) October 15, 2019\n\nOr how about the difficult week Nike workers in China had making his shoes and such?\n\nLeBron James now claims that he had a \"difficult week\" earning millions of dollars to play basketball because someone promoted freedom for Hong Kong@KingJames, do you think the millions of people locked up in China's communist concentration camps are having a good week? https://t.co/p9pMZ1a2N0 \u2014 Ryan Saavedra (@RealSaavedra) October 15, 2019\n\nOver to you, ESPN:\n\nWould love to see prominent sports journalists \u2014 cough, @espn \u2014 call out @KingJames for his ignorance. Make it clear to viewers, especially young viewers, that Morey was right and LeBron is dead wrong. But they won't. Because it's all about the bottom line for them, too. \u2014 Tim Alberta (@TimAlberta) October 15, 2019\n\nMore criticism of LeBron:\n\nLeBron clarifies his tweet isn't a critique of the substance of Morey's tweet, but the *consequences* of tweeting it while teams/personnel were abroad. This means he also refuses to take a position on a moral layup, which is a position, anyway, and a mealy mouthed one at that. https://t.co/t2LDzYsY7i \u2014 Luke Thomas (@lthomasnews) October 15, 2019\n\nThis, of course, isn\u2019t remotely what LeBron said. He called Morey misinformed and not really educated on the situation, which doesn\u2019t jive at all with what he\u2019s saying now. Nice walk back attempt, but no. https://t.co/q96IzG3e7A \u2014 T.J. Moe (@TJMoe28) October 15, 2019\n\nWhy won't you talk about the substance of Daryl Morey's tweet? Why won't you say the words, \"I agree with Daryl that the people of Hong Kong should have freedom of speech and the right to protest\"? https://t.co/N1pjW9boKo \u2014 Michael David Smith (@MichaelDavSmith) October 15, 2019\n\nI'm so sorry for the difficult time you are having. Maybe you can wipe your tears with your freedom and millions of dollars while the Uighurs suffer. \u2014 Jessica Fletcher (@heckyessica) October 15, 2019\n\nUighurs don't have enough money to buy his jerseys anyway. \u2014 jon gabriel (@exjon) October 15, 2019\n\nSo @KingJames says the ONE GUY who spoke up for freedom and liberty and against tyranny \"wasn't educated on the issue?\" You mean, he needs to be re-educated? This is an embarrassment. https://t.co/GWMNvu0pHi \u2014 Larry O'Connor (@LarryOConnor) October 15, 2019\n\nEducate us then, @KingJames. What do you know about China that we don\u2019t? We know about the Chinese imprisonment, torture & execution of Christians and Muslims. We know about the jailing of dissenters. We know the violent threats toward Hong Kong. What are we missing, Wise One? https://t.co/tOPdHng3xm \u2014 Allie Beth Stuckey (@conservmillen) October 15, 2019\n\nIs anyone surprised by these remarks from LeBron James? It\u2019s all about $ for him and zero loyalty. We saw how he abandoned Cleveland for Miami. Now, he\u2019s willing to abandon America\u2019s free speech in exchange for China\u2019s $. https://t.co/6g3zwyEVDm \u2014 Elizabeth Heng (@ElizabethHeng) October 15, 2019\n\nThis is so bad, so unAmerican, that it would have been better for coward @KingJames to have remained silent. https://t.co/dX6LngozWN \u2014 Derek Hunter (@derekahunter) October 15, 2019\n\nTranscript here:\n\nHere is LeBron on his belief that Daryl Morey \"wasn't informed\" on the situation in China, and his thoughts on the consequences that come with free speech pic.twitter.com/JOVRSDzCIg \u2014 Harrison Faigen (@hmfaigen) October 15, 2019\n\n***", "description": "\"Educate us then, @KingJames.
