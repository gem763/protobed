They are designed to do different things in different populations,\" he said.\n\n\n\nWHO has used a \"ring\" vaccination approach with the Merck jab, providing it only to the circle of people known to have been in contact with Ebola patients, and their known contacts.\n\n\n\nIn June, it expanded the access to a \"third ring\" of people who had possibly had contact with contacts of Ebola patients.\n\nThe J&J vaccine, which requires two doses 56 days apart to generate immunity, will meanwhile only be given in a preventative capacity, for instance in large cities to ensure transmission does not begin there.\n\nIt \"will provide a sort of firewall\", Ryan said.\n\nIn July, WHO declared the Ebola epidemic a \"public health emergency of international concern\", a rare designation used only for the gravest epidemics.\n\nThat move came on the heels of an Ebola case in the city of Goma, one of DRC's biggest urban centres.\n\nContaining a lethal contagious disease in cities is invariably far more challenging than in rural settings, given the greater task of tracing and isolating people who are at risk.\n\nWHO is set to convene its Health Regulations Emergency Committee next week to assess whether the emergency designation should still stand.", "description": "UN health agency says transmission rates in deadly epidemic have been slashed but warns danger is not over yet.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/7/15/97c5ec7af519448f99968a0b431fc633_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
