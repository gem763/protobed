That defied analyst forecasts that called for a quarterly loss, and marked the stock's biggest intraday surge since May 2013.\n\nThe automaker also trounced Wall Street's expectations for quarterly earnings per share.\n\nStill, Tesla fell short of revenue estimates, and the company recorded its first year-over-year revenue decline since 2012.\n\nHere are the key figures:\n\nEarnings per share: $1.86, versus the -$0.24 estimate\n\nRevenue: $6.30 billion, versus the $6.45 billion estimate\n\nGross margin: 18.9%, versus the 17.7% estimate\n\nQ3 vehicle deliveries: 97,000, versus the 95,000 to 100,000 estimate\n\nFounder and CEO Elon Musk announced the company's new Shanghai factory is already in the trial production phase and will be ready to hit volume production \"in a few months.\" The facility will allow Tesla to access the Chinese market at a lower cost and boost vehicle sales internationally.\n\n\"I'd like to thank our entire team for this extraordinary achievement.

The figures fell at the lower end of analysts' estimate of 95,000 to 100,000 deliveries, and shares sank about 4% in after-hours trading following the release.\n\nTesla closed at $254.68 per share Wednesday, down roughly 24% year-to-date.\n\nThe automaker has 12 \"buy\" ratings, 10 \"hold\" ratings, and 15 \"sell\" ratings from analysts, with a consensus price target of $265.97, according to Bloomberg data.\n\nNow read more markets coverage from Markets Insider and Business Insider:\n\nNike's new CEO is set to double down on the company's success selling online.
