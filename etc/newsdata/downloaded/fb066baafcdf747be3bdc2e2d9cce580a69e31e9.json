Allowing investors to dip in and out of a fund that might contain unquoted and illiquid assets meant such a fund was \"built on a lie\", he has said.\n\nIt can even be a form of self-harm. To go back to the cake analogy, investors may want the icing of immediate liquidity but it comes with the risk of rotting their teeth: by making that demand, they can put the fund's performance and viability at risk.\n\n\"It\u2019s inconsistent with the underlying assets, and it can disturb the balance of the underlying portfolio, if it requires the manager to sell investments to meet an unexpected redemption request, to the potential disadvantage of continuing investors,\" Myners says.\n\nWoodford Investment Management exemplifies this. It was run by one of the darlings of British stockpicking, Neil Woodford. His flagship fund, started in 2014, returned 20 per cent in its first year. But several big bets went sour in 2017.\n\nRedemption requests steadily began to mount from mid-2017 onwards; the exodus of money and the mounting losses saw assets under management halve in 18 months.\n\nMeeting the redemption requests meant selling liquid assets. That pushed Woodford over the regulator's 10 per cent cap for holdings of unlisted or illiquid assets. By April of this year, a mere 8 per cent of the fund's assets were redeemable within a week. As the media began focusing on the story, redemption requests escalated and Link had to gate the fund on June 3.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNeil Woodford was offered the chance to restructure the portfolio, but last week Link took the decision to wind it up altogether, leaving investors likely facing heavy losses.\n\nAlthough Woodford's risky bets and poor performance are a big part of the story, it's clear that his need to keep things liquid led to some poor decisions.\n\nMyners, for one, reckons that funds like Woodford are trapped by investors' expectations. He thinks the task isn't to regulate funds more heavily, but to educate investors and change their incentives.\n\n\"I favour the introduction of limitations on redemptions as a deterrent to investors going into equity funds if they don\u2019t have the risk tolerance,\" he says.\n\n\"Fund managers would then feel more comfortable creating portfolios that deviate from the index, rather than slavishly replicating it.\"\n\nInvestors also need to understand that gating a fund can actually benefit them: they may not be able to cash out, but in the medium term their investment might be salvaged.\n\n\"As we saw in Woodford and other cases, [gating] can have quite adverse consequences for investor confidence. The industry has to have the confidence to explain why gating can be the right thing to do,\" Myners says.\n\nHe's not sure, though, where the driver of change will come from. He doesn't think regulators are very good at stimulating debate. And fund managers just don't seem to want to stir the pot.\n\n\"Financial people are on the whole very conservative. People become accustomed to a certain way of doing things. They fear frightening investors by change,\" he says.", "description": "Investors may need to be re-educated about what to expect from a high-yielding, activist equity fund.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.7516%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/193b477fd3557c6624d621cb176e5248db47e26f", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
