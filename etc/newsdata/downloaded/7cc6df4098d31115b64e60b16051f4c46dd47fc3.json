Even so, it\u2019s difficult to imagine a greater gift to \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d a show with record-breaking ratings that can be directly tied to its ongoing satirical targeting of President Trump.\n\nNaturally, the show wasted no time in commenting on the impeachment inquiry, kicking off the Season 45 premiere with a cold open that followed squarely in the footsteps of nearly every cold open we\u2019ve seen since Trump became president. Alec Baldwin returned yet again with his Trump impersonation, despite once again saying he was finished playing the role. The sketch opens with him sitting in the Oval Office, worrying about the impeachment news and calling every ally he can think of.\n\nSo, once again, SNL played a sort of mad libs, cycling through many of its more frequent characters. Baldwin\u2019s Trump calls Kate McKinnon\u2019s Rudolph W. Giuliani, Aidy Bryant\u2019s Attorney General William P. Barr, Beck Bennett\u2019s Vice President Pence, Mikey Day and Alex Moffat\u2019s Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, Cecily Strong\u2019s Jeanine Pirro, Chris Redd\u2019s Kanye West and Kenan Thompson\u2019s Don King. Most randomly, the sketch ended with SNL\u2019s Trump calling Liev Schreiber, who portrayed himself (but SNL\u2019s Trump thought he was his titular character from Showtime\u2019s \u201cRay Donovan\u201d).\n\nThe easy highlight of the sketch was new cast member Bowen Yang bringing back his Kim Jong Un impression, who offers the president advice: \u201cYou have a big ocean in your country? Send whistleblower to the bottom of there.\u201d (\u201cI wish my country was as cool as your country,\u201d Baldwin\u2019s Trump replies.)\n\nOtherwise, the jokes were mostly familiar. McKinnon\u2019s Giuliani doesn\u2019t seem to know anything is wrong. \u201cNobody\u2019s gonna find out about our illegal side dealings with the Ukraine. Or how we tried to cover up those side dealings. Or how we planned to cover up the cover up,\u201d Giuliani says, though unbeknown to the president, he\u2019s on CNN. In a subsequent call, he\u2019s on Joe Rogan\u2019s podcast\n\nBryant\u2019s Barr asks, \u201cWhere are you going to find a sacrificial patsy that\u2019ll do anything you say? Not it.\u201d\n\nThe show\u2019s Trump chooses Pence as said patsy, though he tries buttering his VP up first by making small talk about church. \u201cStill waiting on whatshisface to come back?\u201d SNL\u2019s Trump asks, to which Bennett\u2019s Pence replies, \u201cYou mean, Jesus.\u201d\n\nDay and Moffat\u2019s younger Trumps, meanwhile, act like fumbling idiots. \u201cIt\u2019s your sons,\u201d Day\u2019s Trump Jr. says, to which Moffat\u2019s Eric adds, \u201cAnd Eric!\u201d And when asked if they took care of \u201cthat thing in Russia,\u201d Trump Jr. tries playing it cool, asking \u201cWhat thing in Russia?\u201d Moffat\u2019s Eric naturally adds, \u201cThe treason!\u201d\n\nRedd\u2019s West hasn\u2019t been taking his psychiatric medication and, on the advice of Thompson\u2019s King, decides to pull his support of the president because the impeachment is hurting his brand. Trump offers to get someone out of jail, like A$AP Rocky (\u201cagain\u201d) or \u201cthat little girl, Teriyaki 69\u201d (a reference to rapper Tekashi 69, who recently testified against members of his former gang Nine Trey Gangsta Bloods).\n\nStrong\u2019s Pirro tries to cheer the president up, calling him \u201cmy special, beautiful boy\u201d and assuring him that he makes all women\u2019s eyes pop of their skulls because he\u2019s got \u201cdumps like a truck truck and thighs like what what,\u201d a reference to Sisqo\u2019s 1999 hit \u201cThe Thing Song.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s final call goes to an extremely confused Schreiber, who has to explain that Ray Donovan is a character. And that John Wick is also a character. They decide if Trump needs someone to fix his problems, he might do better calling Liam Neeson.\n\nThe impeachment news broke late in the week, meaning the show\u2019s writers were likely scrambling to put together the cold open at the last minute. Still, nothing about it was surprising in the least, aside from Schreiber\u2019s appearance, signaling that we\u2019re in for more business as usual this season. That may disappoint some viewers, but considering how well the show\u2019s been doing, both in ratings and at the Emmys, that should suit most fans just fine \u2014 though it might spark a tweet or two from the president.", "description": "The cold open included a litany of familiar impersonations.", "authors": ["Travis M.
