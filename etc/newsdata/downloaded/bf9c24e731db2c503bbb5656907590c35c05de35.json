In doing so, he provided a string of false and misleading statements designed to obscure his actions and confuse Americans.\n\nBefore we tour through Trump\u2019s comments, here\u2019s a quick refresher. On July 25, Trump spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Just days earlier, Trump unexpectedly ordered the withholding of nearly $400 million in military aid to the country, which is battling a separatist conflict backed by Russia on its Eastern border. What was said on the call is not precisely known \u2014 though Trump has said he will release the transcript \u2014 but Trump has acknowledged he raised former vice president Joe Biden, currently leading in the polls for the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nTrump originally said he halted the aid because of worries about corruption \u2014 suggesting also that \u201ccorruption\u201d by Biden was a concern \u2014 but at the United Nations, he changed his story. Now he says it was because the Europeans were not contributing enough to Ukraine.\n\nBut neither of those concerns was communicated over the summer to anxious lawmakers who did not understand why the money was being withheld. \u201cAdministration officials were instructed to tell lawmakers that the delays were part of an \u2018interagency process\u2019 but to give them no additional information \u2014 a pattern that continued for nearly two months, until the White House released the funds on the night of Sept. 11,\u201d The Washington Post reported.\n\nWith that context in mind, let\u2019s look at Trump\u2019s comments, in the order in which he made them.\n\n\u201cAs far as withholding funds, those funds were paid, they were fully paid. But my complaint has always been \u2014 and I\u2019d withhold again, and I\u2019ll continue to withhold until such time as Europe and other nations contribute to Ukraine. Because they\u2019re not doing it; it\u2019s the United States. We\u2019re putting up the bulk of the money. \u2026 Europe has to put up money for Ukraine also. Why is it only the United States putting up the money? \u2026 Germany, France, other countries should put up money, and that\u2019s been my complaint from the beginning.\u201d\n\nIn the space of 24 hours, Trump changed the rationale for withholding the funds, from corruption to the claim that the United States was carrying the burden of funding Ukraine \u2014 \u201cthe bulk of the money,\u201d as Trump put it.\n\nBut that\u2019s not correct. Europe has been a major funder to Ukraine since Russia annexed its Crimean Peninsula in 2014, often providing more aid than the United States. The European Union has provided more than 15 billion euros ($16.5 billion) in grants and loans to Ukraine, according to an E.U. fact sheet on relations with Ukraine. Meanwhile, NATO has its own military cooperation program with Ukraine, establishing six trust funds to assist the country in improving its military readiness.\n\nAccording to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the top 10 donors in gross overseas development assistance for Ukraine in 2016-2017 are: European Institutions ($425.2 million), United States ($204.4 million), Germany ($189.8 million), Japan ($180.8 million), Global Fund to fight diseases ($44.8 million), Canada ($44.5 million), Poland ($42.5 million), Sweden ($34.6 million), Britain ($31.6 million) and Switzerland ($29.6 million).\n\nTrump would be on more solid ground if he had kept his complaint strictly to military aid. \u201cThe United States is the largest provider of military aid to Ukraine,\u201d said John Herbst, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine now at the Atlantic Council. He said there was \u201cskittishness\u201d among many European countries that \u201cdon\u2019t want to provoke Russia,\u201d with mainly Britain, Poland, Baltic nations and Canada joining the United States in contributing military aid. But this is how the aid burden is usually divided between the United States and the Europeans, with the United States providing the muscle and Europe providing the \u201csoft power\u201d to stabilize troubled nations.\n\n\u201cThis is Trump\u2019s third rationale\u201d for delaying the aid, Herbst noted. \u201cIf it\u2019s Tuesday, it must be because of the Europeans.\u201d\n\nAt the very least, Trump\u2019s constantly changing explanations for why he delayed the aid suggest he\u2019s not being forthright about the real reason.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m leading in the polls; they have no idea how they stop me.\u201d\n\nJust about every poll has Trump trailing many of his Democratic rivals, in particular Biden. Biden led Trump by 15 percentage points in a Fox News poll, 8 points in a SurveyUSA poll, and 15 points in a Post-ABC News poll. (Caveat: Polls at this point in the election cycle are not especially informative.)\n\n\u201cThe only way they can try is through impeachment. This has never happened to a president before.\u201d\n\nOne president, Bill Clinton, was impeached by the House during Trump\u2019s lifetime; he was acquitted by the Senate. Another, Richard Nixon, resigned in 1974 after articles of impeachment were approved by the House Judiciary Committee. A third president, Andrew Johnson, was impeached in 1868; he was also acquitted by the Senate.\n\n\u201cThat call was perfect. It couldn\u2019t have been nicer. And even the Ukrainian government put out a statement that that was a perfect call.\u201d\n\nTrump appears to be referring to an interview by Ukrainian Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko with Hromadske, a Ukrainian Internet television station. In the interview, he struck a careful balance, trying not to take sides between the administration and Congress.\n\n\u201cAmerican investigators have the full right to turn to the U.S. and to get this information,\u201d Prystaiko said. \u201cIf they think that our president has been pressured, they can establish this. I know what they spoke about, and I don\u2019t think there was any coercion. There was a talk, talks can be on different topics, leaders have the right to talk about any problems they wish. This conversation was long, it was friendly, and it touched on a lot of questions, some of which required rather serious answers.\u201d\n\nPrystaiko obviously is trying to be diplomatic. He did not describe the call as \u201cperfect.\u201d\n\nZelensky appears to have had a different impression. Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), who spoke with Zelensky during an early September visit to Ukraine, said the Ukrainian president \u201cdirectly\u201d expressed concerns at their meeting that \u201cthe aid that was being cut off to Ukraine by the president was a consequence\u201d of his unwillingness to launch an investigation into the Bidens, The Post reported.\n\nThe official Ukrainian readout of the call, issued July 25, had this interesting line: \u201cDonald Trump is convinced that the new Ukrainian government will be able to quickly improve image of Ukraine, complete investigation of corruption cases, which inhibited the interaction between Ukraine and the USA.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was no pressure put on them whatsoever. But there was pressure put on with respect to Joe Biden. What Joe Biden did for his son, that\u2019s something they should be looking at.\u201d\n\nHere, Trump continues his misleading effort to suggest that Biden somehow was involved in corruption. But we fact-checked these allegations in May and found they did not add up. In fact, Biden\u2019s case has gotten stronger with time.\n\nTrump repeatedly has falsely claimed that Biden in 2015 pressured the Ukrainian government to fire Viktor Shokin, the top Ukrainian prosecutor, because he was investigating Ukraine\u2019s largest private gas company, Burisma, which had added Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, to its board.\n\nBut it turns out that the investigation had already been shelved when Biden acted and may have even involved a side company, not Burisma. Hunter Biden, who served on the board for five years, was not accused of any wrongdoing in the investigation. The Ukrainian prosecutor was regarded as a failure, and \u201cJoe Biden\u2019s efforts to oust Shokin were universally praised,\u201d said Anders Aslund, a Swedish economist heavily involved in Eastern European market reforms.\n\nShokin was ousted three months after Biden\u2019s visit. \u201cBowing to pressure from international donors, the Ukrainian Parliament voted on Tuesday to remove a prosecutor general who had clung to power for months despite visible signs of corruption,\u201d the New York Times reported at the time. \u201cThe United States and other Western nations had for months called for the ousting of Mr. Shokin, who was widely criticized for turning a blind eye to corrupt practices and for defending the interests of a venal and entrenched elite.\u201d\n\nMoreover, Yuri Lutsenko, a former Ukrainian prosecutor general who succeeded the fired prosecutor, told Bloomberg News that there was no evidence of wrongdoing by Joe or Hunter Biden.\n\nBy continuing to claim that Biden \u201cdid\u201d something for his son, Trump persists in spreading a false narrative about a diplomatic maneuver hailed at the time as a step toward reducing corruption in Ukraine.\n\nThe Pinocchio Test\n\nIn the space of minutes, the president told falsehoods about aid to Ukraine, his standing in the polls, the history of impeachment, impressions of his phone call and of course the role that Biden played in trying to root out corruption in Ukraine.\n\nIt adds up to Four Pinocchios.\n\nFour Pinocchios\n\n(About our rating scale)\n\nSend us facts to check by filling out this form\n\nSign up for The Fact Checker weekly newsletter\n\nThe Fact Checker is a verified signatory to the International Fact-Checking Network code of principles", "description": "In the space of minutes, the president told a series of false and misleading claims about the Ukraine controversy worthy of Four Pinocchios", "authors": ["Glenn Kessler", "The Fact Checker", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Vp9XD0bhMT6-em5BwKb4kp7nQd8=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/Z3G3ZWG7AMI6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
