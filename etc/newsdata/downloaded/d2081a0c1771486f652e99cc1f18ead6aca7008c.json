Opponents of the withdrawal claim that it will open the door to Turkey \u2013 a NATO ally of the US \u2013 to attack the Kurds, whom the US enlisted to fight against Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS) in northeastern Syria.\n\nThe previous administration also sought to use the Kurds as the embryo or a US-aligned administration in Syria, controlling the country\u2019s oil resources and facilitating plans for regime change in Damascus. Meanwhile, Russia has supported the government of President Bashar Assad as the only legitimate and internationally recognized authority.", "description": "US Secretary of Defense Mark Esper called his Russian counterpart Sergey Shoigu on Monday, as US President Donald Trump announced the US pullout from northeastern Syria", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdni.rt.com/files/2019.10/article/5d9b77f82030277ca4259579.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
