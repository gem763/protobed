They see a 13.5 percent chance of a 50 basis-point cut.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite likely the Fed cuts by 25 basis points,\u201d Eric Lascelles, chief economist at RBC Global Asset Management, told FOX Business from Toronto. \u201cFifty basis points is pretty much off the table, given that disaster has been avoided for the moment and inflation is now running at 2.4 percent for core.\u201d\n\nMichelle Meyer, chief U.S. economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in New York, agrees with Lascaelles about the size of the cut.\n\n\u201cThe Fed sees this as an insurance-type cut,\" Meyer said. \u201cThey are cutting proactively in order to ensure that the recovery continues.\u201d\n\nA 25 basis-point reduction would fall short of the \u201cbig\u201d rate cut that Trump has been calling for. He has repeatedly said the economy would \u201crocket\u201d higher if the Fed would only do its part.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe United States, because of the Federal Reserve, is paying a MUCH higher interest rate than other competing countries,\u201d the president tweeted Monday, noting the effect on oil prices of an attack on Saudi production.\n\n\u201cThey can\u2019t believe how lucky they are that Jay Powell & the Fed don\u2019t have a clue. And now, on top of it all, the Oil hit. Big Interest Rate Drop, Stimulus!\u201c\n\nA rate cut on Wednesday would be the Fed\u2019s second in as many meetings as it presides over what Chairman Jerome Powell has called a \u201cmid-cycle adjustment.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn this meeting, I think that the language will be a bit different,\u201d Meyer said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there will be as much focus on a mid-cycle adjustment, and I think that there will be more focus on the idea that the Fed has the tools in place to do what it takes to underpin the economy and make sure that the recovery continues,\" she said. \"It will have more of a dovish tone than the July meeting, given that we\u2019ve seen slower economic growth since then and we\u2019ve also seen greater risks specifically around the trade war.\u201d\n\nSlowing growth and an inverted yield curve -- a signal from bond markets that investors are more worried about the current economy than future conditions, which are typically more difficult to predict -- have spooked investors and sparked recession fears on both Wall Street and Main Street.\n\nThe U.S. economy grew at a 2 percent rate in the second quarter, down from 3.1 percent at the start of 2019. Lascelles believes the U.S. economy will avoid a recession, or at least two consecutive quarters of negative growth. He sees the economy growing at 2.5 percent this year and 1.75 percent in 2020.\n\n\u201cI happen to think we are really on a knife edge right now and that\u2019s why a lot of the recession models out there ultimately point to recession risks that are in the 30-50 percent range,\u201d Lascelles said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s entirely conceivable that with central bank help and a bit of good luck on Brexit and tariffs that the expansion can continue, but it's undeniable that we are getting a lot of late-cycle signals.\u201d\n\nBoth Meyer and Lascelles agree Trump wants big rate cuts in order to support economic growth.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump is fighting a trade war right now, so the more stimulus he can inject into the economy, the longer he can hang in with China and the more tariffs he can apply to secure a better deal,\u201d Lascelles said.\n\nMeyer cautioned there are some consequences to lower rates and easier monetary policy as a way of weakening the dollar, supporting exports and buoying the economy.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\n\u201cWhen you think about what are the potential costs of doing that, it would be stoking inflation fears or creating financial market instability,\u201d she said.", "description": "The market is pricing in a 25 basis point cut on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Jonathan Garber"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/12/0/0/Trump-Powell-Reserve-FT.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
