USA TODAY\n\nCHAMPAIGN, Ill. \u2014 It wasn't a loss.\n\nBut it hardly was an inspiring victory, either.\n\nNo. 16 Michigan pulled out a closer-than-expected 42-25 win at Illinois on Saturday afternoon after allowing the Illini to score 25 consecutive points between the end of the first half and beginning of the fourth quarter.\n\nThe Wolverines (5-1, 3-1 Big Ten) were favored by more than 20 points seemed to be on their way to covering, opening up a 28-point lead before taking a 28-7 lead into halftime on the strength of a run game that piled up 205 yards rushing in the first half.\n\nEverything was going well.\n\nUntil it wasn't.\n\nMichigan running back Zach Charbonnet runs the ball during the first half against Illinois at Memorial Stadium.

Illinois outgained the Wolverines 114-11, holding the ball for nearly 11 minutes and outscoring Michigan 10-0.\n\nThen the fourth quarter began with Michigan losing a fumble. The Illini gained 20 yards with a screen pass and punched in a touchdown. They converted a two-point try, and all of a sudden, the Wolverines' 28-point lead was down to three.\n\nWINNERS AND LOSERS: Highs and lows from Week 7 in college football\n\nSOONERS SHINE: No. 5 Oklahoma with stingy defense prove too much for Texas\n\nSEC SHOCKER: South Carolina knocks off No. 3 Georgia in two overtimes\n\nMichigan was on the brink of collapse. A loss would've been detrimental and seemed like a possibility, given how poorly the Wolverines were playing.\n\nMichigan eventually found a way to pull out the win. On the ensuing possession, Shea Patterson led a 10-play, 79-yard drive that ended with a 5-yard touchdown pass to receiver Donovan Peoples-Jones. Patterson used both his arm and his legs, picking up a key fourth down deep in Illinois territory with a four-yard run.\n\nMichigan's defense forced turnovers on the ensuing two possessions and Illinois didn't score again.\n\nThe Wolverines got off to a quick start, scoring touchdowns on four of its first six possessions mostly thanks to the run game. The defense held Illinois scoreless on its first seven possessions.\n\nThe Illini broke the drought with a six-play, 67-yard drive at the end of the first half, capped by a 23-yard touchdown pass to receiver Josh Imatorbhebhe. Imatorhbhebhe caused problems for Michigan's secondary all game long, leading all receivers with five catches for 102 yards and a score.\n\nIllinois found success in the pass game by attacking the middle of the field and spreading out Michigan's defense. But the Wolverines came up with just enough big plays in the fourth quarter. Linebacker Cam McGrone forced a fumble, and on the next possession, Mike Danna sacked Matt Robinson and forced a fumble that Carlo Kemp recovered at the 1-yard line.\n\nMichigan scored a touchdown on the next play, effectively putting away the game.\n\nThe Wolverines' offense is still inconsistent. During one stretch, Patterson completed just 1 of 7 passes for nine yards. The early success on the ground slowly went away; U-M rushed for just 92 yards in the second half. The defense, meanwhile, allowed four consecutive scoring drives at one point.\n\nMichigan showed that it is still very much a work in progress. And at this point in the season, that might not be sufficient, with two upcoming games against top-10 opponents Penn State and Notre Dame.", "description": "No. 16 Michigan cruised to a big lead before giving up 25 consecutive points in a harder-than-expected win over Illinois in Champaign.", "authors": ["Orion Sang", "Published P.M.
