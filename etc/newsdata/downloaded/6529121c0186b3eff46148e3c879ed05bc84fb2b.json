She\u2019s amazingly ageless \u2014 this much you can deduce through her pics or posts (and still they do no justice to the real thing). But it\u2019s her positive attitude towards all things healthy that leaves us in awe. This mom of two and grandma of one credits her shape to her new boxing workout. WH ventured with her down the road of exercise and life lessons and found she wasn\u2019t short of valuable parting shots.\n\nWorking out is not just for exercise\n\nDespite her hectic filming and production schedule, Connie always finds time for a sweat sesh. \u201cI think it\u2019s important to feel good, and exercise makes you feel good.\u201d A typical exercise session for Connie consists of a mix of cardio-intense pad work, weight training and resistance training. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be skinny \u2014 I want to be fit. I work out four to five times a week; the other days are my rest days. And people are discovering that it\u2019s not just about physical health, it\u2019s actually about mental health [as well]. The combos that I do are long; they\u2019re great for mental fitness as well.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: Unathi on how she is no longer trying to lose weight\n\nDon\u2019t sweat the small stuff\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to imagine someone like Connie having body hang-ups. \u201cI was very skinny when I was young. I used to hate my long arms. I\u2019m naturally petite. I used to worry about my A-cups. I couldn\u2019t find my comfort. Until life made me comfortable. After [second daughter] Ali, I went slightly bigger.\u201d Mother nature left her with womanly curves and a B-cup. But her long slim arms didn\u2019t change. She still struggles to fit into suits \u2014 even doing push-ups. But that doesn\u2019t stop her. She finds different variations of push-ups to keep going. \u201cI\u2019m trying to work my arms every day.\u201d\n\nStay true to yourself\n\nBiggest life lesson? \u201cRemain humble. This industry is very tough and it\u2019s very easy to get a big head. I\u2019ve been in the industry for 30 years and people always ask me \u2018how do you remain relevant?\u2019 My thing is that I always knew why I was doing what I\u2019m doing. And it was never for the glory or for the fame. It was simply because I was/am passionate about it. It\u2019s what I do \u2014 and I do it well. It makes me happy, it makes the people that watch me happy.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: Keeping fit: how to do the right exercise for your age\n\nMake time for happiness\n\nThe little time Connie finds for herself she directs to the things that matter to her \u2014 family and health. \u201c\u2026 Whatever time I have I want to spend with family.\u201d And her family extends to her fit fam too. \u201c\u2026 These gym sessions have kind of filled [a] void, for not being [good at] the friends thing. So now I have gym buddies. It\u2019s nice to have that female energy. Female friendship has become important.\u201d\n\nThis article was originally published in Women's Health SA.\n\nSign up to W24\u2019s newsletters so you don't miss out on any of our stories and giveaways.", "description": "Friendly warning: serious fitness goals ahead.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9435/74907babbe1442148a63381cbd62ea57.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
