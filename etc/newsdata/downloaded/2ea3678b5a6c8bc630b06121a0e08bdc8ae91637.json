I think at times it is an effective way of delivering a message,\u201d Trump Jr. said to Breitbart News about his love of political memes.\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s biggest victory against ISIS after the death of leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi sparked a slew of joyful political memes celebrating the accomplishment.\n\nTrump Jr. frequently weaponizes political moments online, sharing photos ridiculing leftist culture, the media, communists, and even occasionally Republicans like Sen. Mitt Romney.\n\nHe said he learned a lot of political tactics from his father during the 2016 campaign.\n\n\u201cMy father is a master at branding, whether he did that with low energy Jeb, Crooked Hillary, you name it, the reality is we live in a 140 character or less world, these days,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe in some cases, its 280 but those don\u2019t tend to perform as much as the short concise explanation points.\u201d\n\nTrump Jr. cited the 2016 campaign and the subsequent Mueller investigation as an awakening for him, demonstrating just how vicious the left and the media had become.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really frankly more about culture than it is about politics because of all that I\u2019ve gotten to go through,\u201d he said.\n\nThe media, he said, had become the \u201cmarketing arm of the Democrat National Committee,\u201d opening up themselves for ridicule for their hypocrisy.\n\nAlthough Trump Jr. said his description as a \u201cGeneral\u201d in the meme wars was a joke, he is rallying the president\u2019s online supporters by sharing their best content.\n\n\u201cI think part of this is just a nod to all of those who are fighting back and pushing back against the bullshit that we\u2019ve all seen from the mainstream media,\u201d he said.\n\nThe current political climate provided fertile ground for Trump Jr.\u2019s new book, Triggered: How the Left Thrives on Hate and Wants to Silence Us.\n\nTrump Jr. said some days he regretted that his book was finished, as the left and the media demonstrated more examples of hypocrisy every day. But he\u2019ll have a chance to take more shots at the left as he increases his media appearances to promote the book.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s something that a lot of conservatives who\u2019ve been so oppressed, who\u2019ve been demonetized, de-platformed, on social media, its sort of a good laugh and a little nod to all of those people who\u2019ve sort of worked so hard to be able to get their message out there despite being suppressed by the social media masters,\u201d he said.", "description": "While crisscrossing the country and rallying his father's supporters for 2020, Donald Trump Jr. picked up a love of meme warfare.", "authors": ["Charlie Spiering"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1138956761-1-640x480-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
