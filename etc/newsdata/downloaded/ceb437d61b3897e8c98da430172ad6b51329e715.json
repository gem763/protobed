Asked whether another referendum should come first, he said: \u201cA second referendum is what we propose under a Labour government, which would be, as I have said, not a choice between a no-deal cliff edge but between an intelligent arrangement with the European Union and remain.\u201d\n\nThere are several stages yet to conclude before the circumstances of the Saturday sitting become clear, chiefly whether Boris Johnson manages to get a deal from the EU summit on 17 and 18 October. Pro-remain MPs could try to attach a confirmatory referendum on to any deal he secures. If no deal is agreed, the rebels have the option of trying to table Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal agreement bill from the backbenches with a second referendum promised on the face of the legislation.\n\nOne source with knowledge of cross-party talks said there were \u201cfour or five plans floating around\u201d but there was a possible alliance for a confirmatory vote emerging between supporters of a second referendum, pro-deal Labour MPs and Tories or former Tories nervous about the prime minister winning an election on a no-deal Brexit platform.\n\nPeter Kyle, one of the Labour MPs behind the Kyle-Wilson amendment seeking a confirmatory referendum on a deal, said: \u201cWe are very clearly in the end game. We are prepared for any eventuality \u2013 a motion, an amendment or a more novel move. Saturday 19 will be a key moment because it is after the EU summit. In the absence of Boris Johnson being capable of delivering the deal he promised, it\u2019s blindingly obvious that the next best option is the one that already exists or a similar version of it.\n\n\u201cParliament might well want to re-examine that. If Boris Johnson comes back empty-handed, then parliament will be forced to be the grown-up in the room and find a workable proposition.\u201d\n\nHe said it would be \u201cirresponsible\u201d for Labour to agree to an election before a second referendum on a deal has resolved the Brexit issue.\n\nHilary Benn, the Labour MP and chair of the Brexit committee, also said the 19 October sitting would provide an opportunity for those pushing for a second referendum.\n\nHe told the BBC\u2019s Newsnight programme: \u201cIf parliament is going to be meeting we have shown our capacity as parliamentarians to take control of the order paper, so we won\u2019t be meeting just to sit and see what the prime minister has in store for us, this is an opportunity \u2013 if we can get a majority, and that is a big if \u2013 for parliament to say we can find a way forward, a confirmatory referendum is the way to do it, let\u2019s go and ask the British people finally to take the decision.\u201d\n\nLabour would be crucial in this plan, with Corbyn already coming under huge pressure from senior shadow cabinet ministers to back a second referendum before agreeing to an election, especially when the party is not performing well in the polls.\n\nEmily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, went public with her concerns in an interview on the BBC\u2019s Victoria Derbyshire show on Thursday.\n\n\u201cMy concern about if we had a general election, is it would be a kind of quasi-referendum, that it would be all about in or out, what kind of deal, and so to a certain extent I can see the sense in trying to have a referendum first. But it\u2019s really just a question of how can we do that in practice,\u201d she said.\n\nCorbyn had flatly rejected the idea when it was proposed last month by his deputy, Tom Watson. But since then, members of his shadow cabinet have raised concerns that an early election could be a \u201ctrap\u201d that lets Johnson dominate on the issue of Brexit.\n\nThe shadow cabinet is due to tackle the timing of a general election again next week, after an inconclusive discussion this week.\n\nCorbyn himself appeared \u201cgung ho\u201d about an election, according to one close ally. But several other shadow ministers, including Keir Starmer and John McDonnell, have struck a more cautious note.\n\nThere was also a \u201cstrong hint\u201d that those who favour a referendum before a general election plan to press for it in parliament, according to one person present at the meeting.\n\nLabour insiders say the push for a second referendum before an election has been made easier by the moving of Karie Murphy, Corbyn\u2019s chief of staff, out of the leader\u2019s office and into an election role at party HQ. She was among those who were keen to see an early general election, as well as being sceptical about the party adopting a remain stance. One described it as a \u201cgame-changer\u201d for those trying to shift Corbyn towards a more unequivocally pro-remain position.", "description": "Extra day of parliament seen as moment to test support for move as Corbyn faces calls to back it", "authors": ["Heather Stewart", "Rowena Mason"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/35d9b340eea91c5e54d52b39862c340df335878c/0_68_5342_3205/master/5342.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=403b747840377aa38cb2c34a6c918ab9", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
