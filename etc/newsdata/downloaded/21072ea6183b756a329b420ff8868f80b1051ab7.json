I think the last time I did that was probably 2015 when I got the chance to go away and work on a few things and everyone spoke about me coming back with my higher backlift or whatever it may be. To refresh and refocus I think is an important thing to be able to do.\u201d\n\nBairstow hopes to win a recall in time for the Test series to South Africa, which begins in December, even though he will not play any first-class cricket before then.", "description": "Jonny Bairstow is hoping to use England\u2019s Twenty20 series in New Zealand to regain his Test place, after being dropped for the Test tour in New Zealand.", "authors": ["Tim Wigmore", "Simon Briggs"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/cricket/2019/10/21/TELEMMGLPICT000206338669-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqTRGZdwvbfowxpU4Vm1nz6XK9hiev8M58vc3amxvVslM.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
