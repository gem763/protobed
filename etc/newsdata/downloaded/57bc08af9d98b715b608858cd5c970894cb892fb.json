Indianapolis Colts kicker Adam Vinatieri has been collecting paychecks for nearly a quarter of that time.\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, here's how]\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nHowever, Vinatieri\u2019s 24th season in the NFL is now off to a rough start.\n\nAdam Vinatieri misses unprecedented three kicks\n\nThe 46-year-old Vinatieri started his day on the wrong foot with a missed extra point after a Jacoby Brissett touchdown pass, only the 19th such miss in his career.\n\nIt got more worrying from there, as Vinatieri also missed a 29-yard and 46-yard field goal attempt later in the game against the Los Angeles Chargers. He also made an extra point and 44-yard field goal, but this is a job defined by its failures more than its successes.\n\n[Join or create a 2019 Yahoo Fantasy Football league for free today]\n\nAdam Vinatieri has never missed kicks like he did on Sunday.

Instead, it only pushed the game to overtime, where the Chargers won on an Austin Ekeler touchdown.\n\nIt was the first time in Vinatieri\u2019s decades-long career we have seen such a set of misses from the future Hall-of-Famer.\n\nThis is the first time in Adam Vinatieri\u2019s 24-year career that he has missed 2+ field goals and an extra point in the same game. \u2014 NFL Research (@NFLResearch) September 8, 2019\n\nHowever, Vinatieri has had his stumbles in past Septembers, and he obviously managed to overcome those.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdam Vinatieri has missed a PAT and a FG in the same game seven times in his career, five of them in September. \u2014 Nat Newell (@NatJNewell) September 8, 2019\n\nIt is worth mentioning that Vinatieri dealt with a knee injury during training camp, though it seemed he was healthy heading into the regular season.\n\nObviously, Vinatieri\u2019s age is unavoidable when discussing him miss some costly kicks. He\u2019s a legend when it comes to kickers and his longevity is at the point that he has now kicked in 51 different stadiums, but at some point, it seems pretty likely the NFL\u2019s all-time leading scorer will have to retire.\n\nMaybe saying that time is now might be an overreaction to one bad game, but that\u2019s how the drum will beat unless Vinatieri manages to string together some perfect games in the near future.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "The NFL's all-time leading scorer opened his season with two missed field goals and a missed extra point.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/2hOYrod3IQv2Aki45icrOw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/.SWT2eXKXR_oVV6VaRwGBg--~B/aD0yMjYwO3c9MzM5MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/a105bbc0-d28d-11e9-afa7-7d2c5aae9214", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
