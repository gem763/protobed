If and when he makes contributions to both teams, he doesn't want anybody to mention that he's a part of the Curry family.\n\n\"I just want to lay that out on the line right now that going forward this year, there's no family questions,\" Lee reiterated. \"When I'm here in between the lines -- my 9-to-5, this is my job -- I'm thankful, I'm blessed, I'm healthy, I love my family.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Everybody knows I don't have any beef with the media ... no family, there's nothing of that sort because I worked hard to get to the spot that I am.\"\n\nYes he did.\n\nFollow @DrewShiller on Twitter and Instagram\n\nRelated content from TMZ Sports\n\nNick Young blames Instagram for hurting Carmelo's NBA chances\n\nAntonio Brown 'belligerent' during deposition, lawyer claims\n\nCorey Seager hits parked car before Dodger Stadium workout\n\nAldon Smith says he's sober, supported as he turns 30 years old\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarriors' Damion Lee sick of Steph Curry family questions, wants respect originally appeared on NBC Sports Bay Area", "description": "Golden State two-way player Damion Lee was passionate when speaking to reporters Thursday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/waAMj7PkKluAOHXUEhwL7g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/iUpVtzJtnMiw.yEuXbSqog--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/csnbayarea.com/498aa7edf7d308cf83237fdc182960c6", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
