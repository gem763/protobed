The company has developed a brand-new device to assist people with impaired mobility. We visited Honda\u2019s headquarters to see what it\u2019s all about,\u201d reports euronews\u2019 Daleen Hassan.\n\nHonda\u2019s Walking Assist Device\n\nRecent steps into a world beyond automobiles and airplanes may sound like a bit of a leap, but a personal mobility device has been created by Honda to help those in need.\n\nAgile and lightweight at 2.7 kilograms, this Walking Assist Device has been developed for those who suffer from walking difficulties.\n\nIt can manage the stress load of a person\u2019s legs and reduce fatigue. Euronews met Makoto Shibata from Honda\u2019s development department who explained how it works.\n\n\u201cIt is a very, very simple structure, we have two motors and a battery and computer in the backside, during walking this computer senses hip angle movement. This device can assist human leg movement.\n\n\u2018The walking information goes to a tablet. It is like a racing car technique, between the car and the pit,\u201d he said.\n\nThe device has been inspired by the development of the humanoid robot Asimo, where engineers conducted thorough research on the human bipedal system.\n\nSince 2013 more than 50 hospitals in Japan have given patients and elderly people the opportunity to utilise it which has helped to optimise functions.\n\nWalking assist device technology could change the way we look at the concept of mobility as a whole.\n\nMission Arm of Japan\n\n\u201cHealth solutions are not just the prerogative of large corporations. Genta Kondo is a brilliant, young innovator who\u2019s come up with an affordable 3D Printed robotic arm,\u201d explains Daleen Hassan.\n\nIt is 7 o\u2019clock on Wednesday morning and the weekly meeting of \u2018Mission Arm of Japan\u2019, a non-profit organisation where a group of engineers, designers, and physically disabled individuals are gathering to develop prosthetic products.\n\nGentta Kondo, 31-year-old co-founder of the Exii startup company, has combined robotic technology with 3D printing techniques.\n\nWith the simple concept of a sensor attached to the arm, muscle contractions are converted into finger and thumb movements.\n\n\u201cWe are disclosing all the data for free on the internet so as long as you have the access to the internet you can basically download the data and just print it right way.\n\n\u2018This kind of technology trend will improve people lives because they don\u2019t have to stick with the professionals.Everybody can make a hand.\n\n\u2018Making these things has become really easy and I want to tell the world that it is not that difficult. You can customise it to your taste and it\u2019s also really fun to make one,\u201d he said.\n\nProviding practical solutions that can produce an immediate impact could change Takayoshi\u2019s life. He was born with a birth defect in his left hand. Now, he is trying his new prosthetic, before finalising a design that suits him.\n\n\u201cUntil now I was holding things with only my right hand, but this arm will allow me to hold things with my left as well. So I hope that I can do a lot of things with my two arms, I\u2019m very hopeful about my life now,\u201d he told euronews.\n\nWith $500 dollars, you could purchase a stylish 3D-printed arm at 10 times less than the cost of a typical prosthetic arm. A deal you can shake on.\n\nSaving lives with paint\n\n\u201cNearly half a million people die from Malaria every year. A Japanese company has developed a paint that repels mosquitos which are responsible for spreading the deadly disease. We visited Kansai Paint in Tokyo,\u201d said Daleen Hassan.\n\nKansai, known as one of Japan\u2019s largest paint manufacturers for automotive and industrial applications, has invented a paint that uses insecticides to repel mosquitos and other insects. The paint is destined for tropical climate countries.\u200b\n\n\u201cIn a situation where there are a lot of children dying from Malaria in Africa, we thought of developing a paint which could repel or even kill mosquitoes.\n\n\u2018This paint contains ingredients which excite mosquitoes nerves. When mosquitoes land on a wall, they become nervous and paralysed because of these ingredients and would never bite a human. That\u2019s the mechanism,\u201d Yu Akaki,\n\nExecutive Officer, Kansai Paint explained.\n\nDuring tests the paint was found to have an 80% efficiency in repelling mosquitoes. This has led to improvements in health clinics across several developing countries, and the anti-mosquito paint has become vital, especially in nurseries and schools in countries such as Malaysia and Indonesia, where a lot of people suffer from dengue fever.", "description": "\u201cWhat better place than Japan to discover innovative healthcare solutions and technology that can improve people\u2019s lives all over the world.", "authors": ["Daleen Hassan"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/360570/1000x563_360570.jpg", "published_at": "2017-03-15"}
