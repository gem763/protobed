But after losing the Battle of Alesia he was captured, paraded through the streets and then executed.\n\n\u201cAdrenaline provided a solution, to talk about her father while talking about his daughter. That led to an interesting theme which is adolescence, which hadn't been talked about much in previous series,\u201d Ferri said.\n\nRead more: Next stop, Place De Clichix: Paris metro stations renamed for Asterix\n\nIn the story, Adrenaline keeps Asterix and his oversized sidekick Obelix busy chasing after her as she explores teenage rebellion.\n\nAnne Goscinny, Rene Goscinny's daughter, said: \"I think that Adrenaline is certainly in the spirit of the times, but above all, it is in harmony with the spirit of the work, with humour, with the adventures of Asterix in general.\n\n\u201cIt is almost a character that my father could have invented.\"\n\nGoscinny, who created the Asterix series with Albert Uderzo, died in 1977. Uderzo, now 92, has not illustrated the books since 2013.\n\nDidier Conrad, the illustrator of Asterix and the Chieftain\u2019s daughter, said that times had changed since the books were first published.\n\n\"It's not really an 'Asterix' thing, it's more of a 1960's-1970's comic book thing. In general, there were almost no female characters for purely strategic reasons, for the readers, because there weren't many girls reading, or at least, if they were, nobody knew about it,\u201d he said.\n\nThe books have inspired a dozen movies and cartoon series, making it a global phenomenon.\n\nThe latest book is released worldwide in more than 20 languages with an initial print run of over five million copies.", "description": "Asterix and the Chieftain\u2019s daughter sees pint-sized Gaul joined by Adrenaline, the teenage daughter of famous Gaulish king Vercingetorix.", "authors": ["Orlando Crowcroft"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/25/47/02/1000x563_cmsv2_df2c82f0-db30-5bda-9a1e-f06aeba7d98b-4254702.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
