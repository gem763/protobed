They're arranged in a spherical configuration and were capable of capturing imagery at the resolution of full-frame cameras based on concave mirror system that is used on telescopes today.\n\nAngika Bulbul is a PhD candidate (from Bhagalpur, Bihar) at the Ben-Gurion University in Israel. She said in a statement, \"This is an invention that completely changes the costs of space exploration, astronomy, aerial photography, and more. Our system is only 0.5 per cent of the total area of existing telescopic system, using advance technique.\"\n\nShe further added, \"We found that you only need a small part of a telescope lens to obtain quality images. Even by using the perimeter aperture of a lens, as low as 0.43 percent, we managed to obtain similar image resolution compared to the full aperture area of mirror/lens-based imaging systems. Consequently, we can slash the huge cost, time and material needed for gigantic traditional optical space telescopes with large curved mirrors.\"\n\nDon't Miss 423 SHARES 513 SHARES 567 SHARES 10.1 K SHARES\n\nTo show how this system works, the research team formed a miniature laboratory model with a circular array of sub-apertures to analyse the image resolution and compare them side by side with full-lens imagery.\n\nThe Optical Society\n\nThe setup is inspired by the arrangement where two in-sync satellites move with the boundary of the synthetic aperture while capturing light patterns from the subject or scene. The light that is reflected from these satellites interferes with the image sensor on the third satellite. This harmonious union is processed to generate the image of the subject that is similar to the quality of a completely synthetic aperture.\n\nBulbul, who is also an alumna of National Institute of Technology (NIT) Calicut, and the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi further stated, \"In the new work, we are trying to improve the power efficiency of our telescopic system because as we know all the telescope receives very few lights from astronomical bodies resulting in low signal to noise ratio (SNR), for better reconstruction of the image we are working on the improvement of power efficiency.\"\n\nThe team has applied for a patent for this tech however, they're still far away from the end product.", "description": "The revolutionary nanosatellites are of the size of milk cartons.
