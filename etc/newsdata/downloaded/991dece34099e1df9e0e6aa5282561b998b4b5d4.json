Andy Biggs. | Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP Photo Congress House Freedom Caucus picks Andy Biggs as new chairman\n\nThe conservative House Freedom Caucus has a new leader.\n\nThe hard-line group has elected Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.) to be the new Freedom Caucus chief, replacing Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.).\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nMeadows, a founding Freedom Caucus member and one of President Donald Trump\u2019s closest allies on Capitol Hill, will step down Oct. 1 but is expected to remain on the group\u2019s board.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m grateful for the trust of my colleagues in selecting me to serve as the next chairman of the House Freedom Caucus,\u201d Biggs said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThe Freedom Caucus has revolutionized Capitol Hill because our members endeavor to keep our promises to the American people.

The Freedom Caucus has also come under fire for being unswervingly loyal to Trump, prompting one of its members, Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan, to quit the group earlier this year before leaving the GOP altogether.\n\nMeadows was initially expected to pass the baton to the next chairman earlier this year, but Freedom Caucus members decided to punt on leadership elections until the fall to give themselves time to settle into the new Congress.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been honored and humbled to serve as chairman of the Freedom Caucus for the last two and a half years, and I can\u2019t think of a better person to pass the torch to than Andy Biggs,\u201d Meadows said in a statement.\n\nBiggs came to Congress in 2017 and sits on the House Judiciary Committee, where Republican members serve as Trump\u2019s first line of defense against possible impeachment.", "description": "The Freedom Caucus has played a key role in some of the most high-profile fights in the House GOP.", "authors": ["Melanie Zanona"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/54/23/939d594a4dceb692f4c4b59fd65e/20190910-andy-biggs-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
