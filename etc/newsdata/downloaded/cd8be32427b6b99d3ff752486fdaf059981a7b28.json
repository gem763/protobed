Pictured is an area of Swindon\n\nBy clicking on a pin on the map, people can view and download information on an air raid in that area, including the exact date, location and number of casualties\n\nThe map, which is free to use, is based on 6,500 daily reports compiled by wartime intelligence officers for the Ministry of Home Security and senior officials.\n\nIt stretches as far back as 16 October 1939, the first wartime attack on British shores.\n\nThis came just six weeks after Adolf Hitler's Nazi party triggered the devastating conflict by invading Poland.\n\nAnd the map shows all the bombs after that point \u2013 every single marker records the landing of a bomb, whether it exploded or not.\n\nBy clicking on a pin on the map, people can view and download information on an air raid in that area, including the exact date, location and number of casualties.\n\nFor example, the map shows that a bomb was dropped on Waterloo Bridge in London on the night of April 19 1941, during a raid that killed 240 people and injured 880 across the city.\n\nThe groundbreaking map was developed by Dr Laura Blomvall, a researcher from the Department of English and Related Literature at the University of York.\n\nHer work confirmed that the first place in Britain to be bombed was the Firth of Forth in Scotland.\n\nHOW TO USE THE INTERACTIVE MAP To use the interactive 'Bombing Britain' map visit http://www.warstateandsociety.com/Bombing-Britain. To zoom in on an area you can either scroll upwards, use the plus and minus buttons or click on the blue circles containing figures of the number of raids in a particular area.\n\nAs you zoom in further, the locations become more detailed and the clusters of data break up.\n\nThe map can be zoomed in on until you reach the level of a village or town in rural areas; a borough or district in a city, such as Fallowfield in Manchester; or to individual streets in London.\n\nTo search for a specific campaign or type of attack, there are tools on the left sidebar in which you can enter start and end dates to search within; whether it happened at day or night; the region or country; and a number range for deaths and casualties.\n\nDr Blomvall said: 'This map offers an astonishing insight into the extent and scale of total war.\n\n'Bombing Britain allows us to visualise how bomb strikes affected the entire country \u2013 not just London and the South East \u2013 as bombs were dropped from the Orkney Islands to Coventry, from Liverpool to the Scilly Isles and from Dover to Swansea.\n\n'This unique research project shows how war was no longer confined to the battlefield.\n\n'The normalisation of aerial warfare turned mainland Britain into a violent battlefield, and the term 'home front' was no longer figurative.'\n\nSome 30,000 tonnes of bombs were dropped on the UK during the Blitz \u2013 an intense German bombing campaign targeting British industry and morale which killed more than 40,000 people.\n\nThe Blitz began on September 7, 1940, from which London was bombed for 57 nights in a row. The last Luftwaffe raid took place on May 1944, just a month before D-Day.\n\nUnexploded World War Two bombs continue to be discovered up and down the country, often causing schools or offices to be abandoned in a panic.\n\nA woman and two children look at damage caused to the Chrysler Works in London during an air raid in 1944\n\nLondon and the south-east weren't the only places affected by the Nazis' bombing campaign \u2013 this photos shows the damage wrought on Plymouth by the air raids\n\nDr George Hay, military historian at The National Archives, said: 'The National Archives holds vast collections that tell the story of both the British and German strategic bombing campaigns of the Second World War.\n\n'This interactive map makes use of the intelligence reports that followed German raids on the United Kingdom, and visually demonstrates the impact and reach of those attacks.\n\n'This map will be a fantastic resource, not only for military and social historians, but for anyone interested in the impact of wartime air raids across the UK.'", "description": "A researcher from the University of York used wartime intelligence reports to compile the Bombing Britain database which shows more than 30,000 locations hit in Luftwaffe strikes.", "authors": ["Sam Blanchard For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/16/19794666-0-image-a-22_1571240223142.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
