He pledged that Prime Air, Amazon\u2019s drone delivery program, would be delivering packages to customers \u201cin months.\u201d\n\nWithin weeks of Wilke\u2019s announcement, Amazon, Uber and UPS applied for air carrier certificates from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration to launch commercial drone operations. In April, Wing Aviation, the drone delivery arm of Google\u2019s parent company Alphabet\u2014and a competitor to Amazon\u2019s own aspirations\u2014became the first American company granted FAA approval for commercial delivery.\n\nAmazon describes its drone delivery business as \u201ca future delivery system\u201d with the stated goal of getting packages to customers in 30 minutes or less. \u201cPrime Air has great potential to enhance the services we already provide to millions of customers by providing rapid parcel delivery that will also increase the overall safety and efficiency of the transportation system,\u201d the company wrote in a summary of the program.\n\nAmazon appears to be throwing more resources into its drone aspirations than its competitors, which makes sense given that drone delivery could be very advantageous to Amazon\u2019s core business.\n\nSince last summer, Prime Air has more than quadrupled the number of job listings on its website to nearly 170, according to Thinknum, a data analytics company that tracks changes to websites.\n\nWing currently has about 40 job openings and Uber lists a handful of jobs related to drone delivery. A UPS spokesperson said the company isn\u2019t ready to share hiring information.\n\nThe bulk of Amazon\u2019s open posts are located in Seattle, with a handful in Israel, Austria, California, France, Boston, and Cambridge, England, where the company showcased its first trial drone delivery to a customer in 2016.\n\nAMAZON ABROAD\n\nIf Amazon receives FAA approval for its latest drone system, which can take anywhere from months to years, the company can prove its technology by flying in designated areas and scale up operations accordingly.\n\n\"If Amazon delivered to two customers within 12 months of Wilke\u2019s announcement they would not have lied to anybody,\u201d said Gerald Van Hoy, a drone-centric technology analyst at the Analyst Syndicate.\n\nVan Hoy is skeptical that Amazon or its competitors will be flying in and around American suburbs, let alone urban areas, anytime soon.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re more likely to get a package from Scout than from drones in congested traffic areas,\u201d he said, referring to Amazon\u2019s sidewalk-roaming delivery bot that\u2019s currently making trial deliveries in the Seattle area and southern California.\n\nGiven the pace of regulatory approval in the U.S., he argues the company is more likely to make its first drone deliveries to customers abroad.\n\nAmazon has made much more progress working with regulators in the United Kingdom, where it also has a vast network of fulfillment centers and retail stores packed with products ready to ship.\n\nStill, the U.S. market is where most of the American companies have focused their efforts.\n\n\u201cYou can put a man on the moon with enough resources, time and effort,\u201d said Steve Luxion, executive director of the Alliance for System Safety of UAS through Research Excellence (ASSURE).\n\nASSURE is working with about two dozen research universities to help the FAA develop the basic rules and policies governing nationwide drone use.\n\nBut creating such a framework of rules\u2013similar to the system that governs airplanes\u2013could take more than a decade. In the meantime, companies can request waivers to launch limited operations, as Amazon, UPS and Uber recently did. If they can prove the safety of their technology, as Wing did in April, the FAA awards the waiver.\n\n\u201cIf they want to devote the resources to it, I can pretty assuredly tell you they will get there before we clear the capability for the entire nation,\u201d he said.\n\nAMAZON'S ADVANTAGE\n\nTom Forte, senior research analyst at investment banking firm D.A. Davidson, sees Amazon as the dominant leader in the U.S. drone race.\n\nGiven the costly logistics of delivering customer orders at an ever faster pace, Amazon has a greater need for drones than the other companies, he said.\n\nUPS lacks the technological expertise to master drone delivery, Forte said, arguing that the delivery giant was pulled into the drone race in 2013, when Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos announced his plans to deliver packages by drone in less than 30 minutes during a 60 Minutes interview.\n\nUber is the most business- and tech-savvy of Amazon\u2019s drone delivery competitors, according to Forte, but Amazon\u2019s vast network of rural fulfillment centers, suburban sortation centers and its growing urban retail footprint give it a clear advantage in the race to build a booming drone business.\n\nGoogle\u2019s Wing may have been the first to gain FAA approval for commercial operations, but the Google subsidiary has approached drone delivery more as \u201ca scientific problem to solve than a business play\u201d according to Forte.\n\n\u201cDrones can be seen as a component of Amazon\u2019s master plan of logistics,\u201d Forte added.\n\nAmazon has hinted at that master plan over the years. The company\u2019s drone-centered patents have illustrated a future in which drones launch from delivery trucks, trains, and ships. One patent even showed drones being deployed from a snack-filled Amazon Prime Air blimp hovering over a sports arena. The company has also patented methods for syncing the drones with autonomous vehicles of all sorts.\n\nAnd though many patents never come to life, one Amazon drone vision depicts a beehive-shaped fulfillment tower in a futuristic urban center, buzzing with flying robots making deliveries. Inside, robotic arms load packages onto the drones, while other robots restock shelves of inventory offloaded by autonomous trucks or repair damaged drones. The occasional human is pictured monitoring the robots.", "description": "Plenty of tech companies are vying to make drone delivery a reality, but Amazon is poised to dominate.", "authors": ["Casey Coombs"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1567466511/190902-hatmaker-amazon-prime-drone-tease_i7drgh"}
