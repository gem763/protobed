Add Interest\n\nThe Steak Fry, sponsored by the county\u2019s state Democratic party, offered a vivid representation of each presidential candidate\u2019s campaign identity. Each candidates' group of supporters vied for voters\u2019 attention with splashy visual displays \u2013 demonstrations of political force that, coupled with new CNN and Des Moines Register poll results of voters likely to attend the 2020 Iowa Democratic caucuses, reinforced the notion that Hawkeye State voters could shake up front-runner expectations come February.\n\nScott Olson/Getty Images\n\n\"They're using this moment to reach out to potential caucus-goers and in the other early states they're reaching out to potential primary voters and trying to lock down a lot of commitments and to expand from there,\" University of Denver political science professor Seth Masket told ABC News.\n\nThe CNN and the Des Moines Register poll noted nearly two-thirds of likely Democratic caucus-goers have yet to make up their mind about who they would vote for.\n\nThe poll also indicated virtual ties between former Vice President Joe Biden and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren \u2013 both of whom had been investing in Iowa for months, and whose on-the-ground showing in the state couldn\u2019t have been more different.\n\nAnd while Warren's lead in recent Iowa polls may be relatively small, as political experts say, it could serve as a push for her campaign in groundwork and fundraising as the primary season deepens.\n\nWarren\u2019s entrance to the Steak Fry was relatively unassuming. Organizers roamed the park before her arrival from a forum a few miles away and cheered her on as she delivered her speech. From there, Warren participated in a signature selfie line and made her exit.\n\nIn contrast, Biden spent the whole day rallying with supporters, complete with a marching band, dancers, ice cream and a firetruck. The flashy show culminated with Biden jogging up on stage just as it began to lightly rain on the crowd. Biden noted it wasn\u2019t his first Steak Fry and referenced Iowa\u2019s longest-serving Democratic senator who began the political tradition decades ago.\n\n\u201cI started off here when it was the Tom Harkin Steak Fry,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t ever this big.\u201d\n\nCharlie Neibergall/AP\n\nCalifornia Sen. Kamala Harris, who also made a splash Saturday as she danced her way through the Steak Fry with a marching band and drumline. Ahead of the Steak Fry weekend, the Harris campaign announced a renewed focus on organizing in the state Iowa as she tries to regain ground.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had over 60 people on the ground, we\u2019re gonna double that after Labor, it was always the plan that we would double our resources,\u201d Harris told ABC News\u2019 Rachel Scott.\n\n\u201cIt has been from day 1 about investing in Iowa,\u201d she added.\n\nLater, Harris took to the stage to relay those goals to supporters.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if you guys heard, I\u2019m planning on moving to Iowa,\u201d Harris joked on stage about what\u2019s likely to be in store for both her, and many other 2020 Democratic candidates in the near future.\n\nSouth Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg\u2019s supporters also seemed to play into the grand scale of the gathering. Armed with larger than life cutouts of the mayor\u2019s head, his supporters were ubiquitous around the Des Moines Water Works Park, where the event was held.\n\nButtigieg's organizers were positioned at every major entrance to the event, and the arrangement implied a real-time example of the fruits of his campaign\u2019s labor. Over preceding weeks, the Buttigieg campaign opened 20 Iowa offices in 20 days, staffed up and kicked off a state-wide bus tour.\n\nScott Olson/Getty Images\n\nThe other progressive candidate in the pack, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, also seemed to make his rounds in Iowa in a relatively quiet manner. Sanders, who lost Iowa by a razor-thin margin in 2016, made a point of boasting his low-key showing at the Steak Fry.\n\n\u201cWe drove in here and saw a million Joe Biden signs and not many of ours,\u201d he told supporters before taking the Steak Fry stage. \u201cThat\u2019s great. We don\u2019t want them to be here in the field, but on peoples\u2019 lawns.\u201d\n\nOn stage, Sanders took another veiled swipe at Biden, insisting that \u201ccontinuing to be dependent on the wealthy and powerful for campaign contributions is not the way forward.\u201d\n\nAnd now experts say, the digs and jabs that have mostly been directed at Biden so far \u2013 and to certain extent at Sanders \u2013 are likely to start pointing at Warren, as she rises to the top-tier of the race.\n\n\"The one thing that I'm watching for is the broadsides that will inevitably be launched by the other campaigns,\" said Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia Center for Politics. \"They're not going to sit there and let Elizabeth Warren rocket to the top and not say anything.\"", "description": "After their first major weekend in Iowa, Democrats are setting their sights on the state caucuses in February.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/elizabeth-warren-iowa-gty-jc-190923_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg"}
