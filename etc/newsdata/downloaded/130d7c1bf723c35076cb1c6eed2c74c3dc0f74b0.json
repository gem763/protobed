(AP) - The Green Bay Packers strolled into Chicago for the season opener boasting a revamped defense with several expensive additions, and suffocated quarterback Mitchell Trubisky and the Bears\u2019 offense.\n\nDefensive coordinator Mike Pettine\u2019s unit will see an entirely different challenge in running back Dalvin Cook on Sunday when the Packers (1-0) host the Minnesota Vikings (1-0), another NFC North foe.\n\nCook rushed for 111 yards and two touchdowns on 21 carries against the Atlanta Falcons last week. It was the third-year back\u2019s third 100-yard outing in his 16th career game.\n\n\u201cYeah, the run game, I mean it all starts, that running back, he\u2019s an elite runner,\u201d Packers coach Matt LaFleur said. \u201cDalvin Cook\u2019s an elite runner, and they did a nice job up front. They took it to Atlanta, quite frankly, last week.\u201d\n\nWhen healthy, Cook has proven to be one of the prime runners in the league. But staying healthy has been the biggest challenge of Cook\u2019s young career.\n\nCook, a 2017 second-round pick, played only four games as a rookie, suffering a torn ACL. Cook battled injury again last season, missing a chunk after a hamstring injury in a 29-29 tie at Lambeau Field in Week 2.\n\nCook said he\u2019s not thinking about last season\u2019s injury or last season\u2019s tie.\n\n\u201cDifferent team, different mindset, different coaches, everything\u2019s different,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to expect different things. I can\u2019t really talk about what we did last year.\u201d\n\nThe Packers allowed just 46 yards on the ground in the opener, with inside linebacker Blake Martinez leading the team with five tackles and a sack. Outside linebackers Za\u2019Darius Smith and Preston Smith and safety Adrian Amos, all acquired in March through free agency, combined for five tackles, 2\u00bd sacks and an interception. The Smiths combined for 10 total quarterback pressures; Za\u2019Darius Smith had six, which leads the league.\n\n\u201cThe guys that they brought in are pretty good players,\u201d Cook said of the Green Bay defense. \u201cThey kind of added some rangy, long guys. I think their defensive speed is a plus for them, and they kind of fly around. I think that\u2019s what\u2019s going to get their defense charged up. I think we\u2019ve got to kind of limit that for those guys and match speed for speed. We can do that.\u201d\n\nREUNITED\n\nIf there\u2019s anyone who knows what to expect from Minnesota quarterback Kirk Cousins, it\u2019s LaFleur. LaFleur was Cousins\u2019 position coach in Washington in 2012 and 2013. Washington was LaFleur\u2019s first stop in the NFL.\n\n\u201cIf you let him sit back there and have time, he\u2019s going to pick you apart because he\u2019s extremely accurate,\u201d LaFleur said of Cousins.\n\nCousins, who sent a congratulatory text message to LaFleur after the first-year Packers coach picked up his first career win in Chicago, played sparingly under LaFleur as Cousins backed up 2012 AP Offensive Rookie of the Year Robert Griffin III.\n\nCousins had just 10 pass attempts in the win last week, the fewest of any game he\u2019s started in his career.\n\n\u201cI have no interest in dropping back 50 times if we don\u2019t need to,\u201d he said. \u201cI like to win the way we did last week if that\u2019s the way it can happen. I\u2019ll play whatever game is called, whatever game we need, and all that really matters is that we find a way at the end to win. I\u2019m not going to nitpick or look at any of the steps along the way to get there.\u201d\n\nSIMPLY DOMINANT\n\nAaron Rodgers has seven games with a passer rating of 130-plus against Minnesota, the most by a quarterback against one team in NFL history. Rodgers has 24 touchdown and zero interceptions in those seven games (6-1).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just high-percentage passes,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to find in the progression what guys give you the best chance of a completion and the lowest chance of a negative play. This is the way I\u2019ve played and we\u2019ve played here for a long time. We take care of the football.\u201d\n\nSTOUT DEFENSE\n\nTwo of Minnesota\u2019s biggest defensive stars have shined brightest against Green Bay. Free safety Harrison Smith, who had a team-high eight tackles last week, has five career interceptions against the Packers. The eight-year veteran has 20 career picks. Meanwhile, defensive end Everson Griffen has 12\u00bd sacks in 19 career games against Green Bay.\n\n\u201cYou have Pro Bowl-caliber players on every level of the defense, great inside linebackers, two guys off the edge who can rush really, really well, and then a back end that can really cover, one of the top safeties in the league in Harrison, and obviously a great corner combo with Trae and Xavier,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cThey do a great job of playing their scheme. They\u2019ve been together for a while. They\u2019re a tough team to try to attack.\u201d\n\nOFFENSIVE FOCUS\n\nBoth LaFleur and Green Bay offensive coordinator Nathaniel Hackett said the offense needs to operate more efficiently on first and second downs on Sunday to avoid third-and-long situations. The Packers converted only 2 of 12 third-down opportunities in the opener.\n\nINJURY CONCERNS\n\nThe Vikings placed receiver Josh Doctson on injured reserve Thursday with a hamstring injury. Minnesota signed the 2016 first-round pick just before the start of the season after he was released by Washington. Doctson was inactive for Week 1.\n\nGreen Bay left tackle David Bakhtiari, who appeared on the team\u2019s injury report Wednesday with a back issue, was not in pads on Thursday. LaFleur wouldn\u2019t say whether Bakhtiari was held out for precautionary reasons or if it means his availability for Sunday is in question.\n\n___\n\nFollow Keith Jenkins on Twitter: https://twitter.com/MrKeithJenkins\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Green Bay Packers strolled into Chicago for the season opener boasting a revamped defense with several expensive additions, and suffocated quarterback Mitchell Trubisky and the Bears' offense.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Keith Jenkins"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/12/falcons_vikings_football_63756_c0-192-4581-2862_s1770x1032.jpg?909eb3792f4b480b91164e783542aff5f85493f4", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
