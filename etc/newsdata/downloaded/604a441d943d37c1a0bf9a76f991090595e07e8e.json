The service will seek to match up users with common interests who aren\u2019t already \u201cfriends\u201d on the platform. Those who opt in will have the opportunity to create a profile and match with either friends of friends or people who aren\u2019t in their network at all.\n\nThe service, which will exist as a tab in the mobile app, borrows features of other popular dating platforms like Hinge and Bumble: Users answer personality-based questions and will be able to send \u201clikes\u201d to non-friend profiles that catch their eye and send them messages. Facebook Dating will tap into each user\u2019s pre-existing network, as well as their \u201clikes\u201d and \u201cevents\u201d attended where Facebook will attempt to fill in by highlighting \u201cmissed connections.\u201d\n\nBut actual Facebook friends are also not totally off limits, either: The \u201cSecret Crush\u201d feature allows people to express interest in up to nine friends on either Facebook or Instagram, because our social lives aren\u2019t already chaotic enough.\n\nIn the wake of privacy catastrophes like Cambridge Analytica, Facebook is stressing that the dating service is completely voluntary and will protect its users' data: \"A feature on Facebook that people don't trust isn't going to be successful,\" Rob Sherman, the company's deputy chief privacy officer, told WKYT. \"We built in privacy from the ground up.\" Well, color me convinced!\n\nFacebook Dating certainly has the potential to disrupt the dating app space for its target demographic, older people, who don\u2019t exactly have a stellar roster of general online matchmaking services catering to them that don\u2019t give off heavy FarmersOnly vibes. Facebook Dating is also conspicuously free of ads, which should help get users ever more glued to the platform by leveraging the deep sense of loneliness many people feel in our late-capitalist hell world.\n\nWhatever the case, I, for one, can\u2019t wait to find the man of my dreams who also signed up for the event \u201cFive Years From Now You\u2019ll Get a Notification For This Event and Be Like \u2018WTF is This?\u2019\u201d in college. He had to be somewhere.\n\nFollow John Paul Brammer on Twitter.", "description": "Unless you have an Instagram crush you\u2019ve been dying to talk to.", "authors": ["Meera Navlakha", "Caleb Quinley"], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d7171805efbbd0009026d8c/lede/1567717672596-Stocksy_txpb71e341eYdS200_Medium_2243915.jpeg?crop=0.8979xw:0.7576xh;0xw,0.0121xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
