Matthew Kroll says the four bodies had injuries consistent with drowning.\n\nSearchers continued to look for more than two dozen other people who were aboard the vessel Conception, which burned while anchored off Santa Cruz Island.\n\n\"Right now they're conducting shoreline searches for any available survivors,\" Coast Guard Capt. Monica Rochester told reporters at a brief news conference at Channel Islands Harbour in Oxnard, , the nearest city to the island, about 48 kilometres off the California shoreline.\n\nThe coast guard said the vessel was believed to have carried 38 people, including five crew members who jumped off the boat soon after the fire ignited before dawn.\n\nAuthorities previously said 34 passengers were on board, but later corrected this to 33.\n\n\"The crew was actually already awake and on the bridge and they jumped off,\" Rochester said.\n\nTwo suffered minor injuries, said coast guard Petty Officer Mark Barney.\n\nAuthorities said the crew members were rescued by a Good Samaritan vessel called The Grape Escape.\n\nAsked if the crew tried to help others aboard, Rochester said, \"I don't have any additional information.\"\n\nA woman who came to the harbour said, \"My son was on that boat.\" She was led away by a Ventura County firefighter.\n\nRochester said the 20-metre commercial scuba diving vessel was anchored in Platt's Harbour, about 18 metres off the northern coast of Santa Cruz Island, when the fire ignited around 3 a.m. local time.\n\nShe said the vessel sank in around 20 metres of water, adding its bow is still visible above the waterline.\n\nThe Conception was on the final day of a Labour Day weekend cruise to the Channel Islands when the fire erupted.\n\n\"At 3:15 this morning the Coast Guard overheard a mayday call. The call was garbled, it was not that clear, but we were able to get some information out of it to send vessels on scene,\" Barney said.\n\nRochester said that call indicated the boat was already fully ablaze.\n\nU.S. Representative Julia Brownley, a Democrat whose district includes Ventura County, called the fire \"devastating.\"\n\n\"We still are hoping that there could still be some survivors,\" she told reporters in Oxnard.\n\nThe Conception was chartered by Worldwide Diving Adventures, which says on its website that it has been taking divers on such expeditions since the 1970s. It was owned and operated by Truth Aquatics, a respected Santa Barbara-based company founded in 1974.\n\nAsked if the boat operator has a history of any violations, Rochester said, \"The vessel has been in full compliance.\"\n\nThe National Transportation Safety said it is sending a team to investigate.\n\nThe U.S. Coast Guard said it has launched several boats, as well as helicopters, in response to the emergency. (Ventura County Fire Department via The AP)\n\nThe Conception had departed at 4 a.m. Saturday with plans to return at 5 p.m. Monday.\n\nDivers sleep in a single room of bunk beds, according to a diagram of the Conception posted on Truth Aquatics' website.\n\nThe website says the vessel, launched in 1981, has rafts and life jackets for up to 110 passengers and exits on the port, starboard and bow that provide \"easy water entry.\"\n\nThe trip promised multiple opportunities to see colourful coral and a variety of marine life around the Channel Islands.", "description": "The bodies of four people killed by a raging fire that swept through a dive-boat off the Southern California coast were recovered Monday as authorities said more than two dozen others remained missing and were feared dead.", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5267828.1567448088!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/boat-fire-california.jpg"}
