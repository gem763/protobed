The remaining banks did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe IPO plan has rapidly gained momentum in recent days with the appointment of the head of the kingdom's PIF sovereign wealth fund, Yasser al-Rumayyan, as Aramco's new chairman.\n\nRumayyan, a close ally of Prince Mohammed, took over from former energy minister Khalid al-Falih in a move to separate Aramco from the ministry, a step Saudi officials have said was important to pave the way for the IPO.\n\nBankers have been courting Saudi Arabia to secure roles in the transaction, which has faced repeated delays, but which officials have said will happen by 2020-2021.\n\nAramco's chief executive, Amin Nasser, said this week that the domestic IPO would be the \"primary\" listing but that the company was also ready for an international share sale. He said the final decision on venue and timing rested with the government.\n\nThe flotation is crucial for Prince Mohammed's plans to diversify the Saudi economy in an era of low oil prices.\n\nBased on the indicated $2 trillion valuation that Saudi Aramco had hoped to achieve, a 1% float would be worth $20 billion, a huge milestone for the local stock market.\n\nAnalysts and bankers, however, have said $1.5 trillion is a more achievable valuation for Aramco.\n\nAramco raised $12 billion this year in its first international bond, gaining more than $100 billion in demand, in a deal that many saw as a pre-IPO relationship-building exercise with international investors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Hadeel Al Sayegh and Davide Barbuscia; Additional reporting by Joshua Franklin in New York; Editing by Ghaida Ghantous and Marguerita Choy)", "description": "Saudi Aramco has hired nine banks as joint global coordinators to lead its planned initial public offering (IPO), slated to be the world's largest, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Wednesday.
