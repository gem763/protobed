Boston-accent hero Nomar Garciaparra is traded months before the Red Sox\u2019s first World Series victory in 86 years. All-star forward DeMar Derozen is booted from the Raptors the year before Toronto wins its first NBA title. Bolton, warmongering for a conflict with Iran for decades, is sent packing three days before a strike on Saudi oil facilities pushes the administration to a \u201clocked and loaded\u201d standoff with Tehran.\n\nIt\u2019s understandable that the former Trump staffer is frustrated; according to a new report from Politico, he\u2019s letting it be known. At a private lunch hosted by a conservative think-tank at Le Bernadin on Wednesday, Bolton dunked on Trump\u2019s foreign policy, calling the president\u2019s invitation for the Taliban to join him at Camp David \u201cdisrespectful\u201d and a \u201cterrible signal.\u201d As anyone would do after an abrupt dismissal, he derided his boss\u2019s new direction, calling negotiations with North Korea and Iran \u201cdoomed to failure.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe ripped Trump, without using his name, several times,\u201d one attendee told Politico. Surprising no one, Bolton claimed that more aggressive action toward Iran could have saved the U.S. from its current predicament: He reportedly said that if the U.S. hit Iran following a downed drone in June, Iran might not have damaged the Saudi oil facilities last week. He also called the strike on Saudi Arabia an \u201cact of war,\u201d reminding the majority of Americans who don\u2019t want an Iranian conflict why they collectively sighed in relief upon his White House ejection.\n\nAt least in his newfound free agency, Bolton won\u2019t have to suffer the indignities of his former job, like when Trump sent him to outer Mongolia rather than include the national security adviser on North Korea talks, or when Trump hit him with Situation Room jabs like: \u201cJohn, let me guess, you want to nuke them all?\u201d Conveniently for Bolton, his midtown lunch audience was packed with conservative establishment networking opportunities, including Alan Dershowitz, John Podhoretz, Newsmax CEO Chris Ruddy, Fox News alum John Stossel, and billionaire eschaton-board-gamer Rebekah Mercer.", "description": "The week after former national security adviser John Bolton was let go by Donald Trump, he appeared before a lunch hosted by a conservative think-tank and critiqued his former boss, claiming Trump should have taken a harder stance with Iran.", "authors": ["Matt Stieb"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/09/18/bolton_trump.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
