We chatted with its CEO about the launch, and why an IPO is still far off.", "language": "en", "text": "UK fintech startup TransferWise has just inked deals with a US digital bank and a credit union that will offer its international money-transfer services through those companies' own apps.\n\nThis means the US banking partners can now integrate TransferWise's API into their infrastructure, giving their customers the ability to use TransferWise via those companies' client-facing platforms to transfer money internationally.\n\nThat marks the first US agreements where TransferWise is layering its technology into existing banks. The cross-border payments company founded in 2011 is already live with TransferWise for Banks in Europe, where neobanks like the UK's Monzo and larger institutions like France's Groupe BPCE have signed on.\n\nNovo, a digital banking service for small businesses, and the Stanford Federal Credit Union, which serves Stanford University along with other tech companies in the San Francisco Bay area, are among the first US partners for TransferWise's banking product. In June, Novo announced a partnership with cloud accounting provider Xero.\n\n\"The exciting thing that the banks are telling me is that just by integrating TransferWise, they suddenly become hyper-competitive for international payments,\" TransferWise CEO and cofounder Kristo K\u00e4\u00e4rmann told Business Insider.\n\nThe bank partnerships build on TransferWise's peer-to-peer approach, which pairs up people across borders who want to make money transfers in different currencies. The company says that P2P model is what allows it to charge lower fees than more traditional methods.\n\n\"It would never be tech that we would be able to build ourselves,\" Novo founder Tyler McIntyre told us, explaining why it decided to partner with TransferWise instead of building or buying its own system. \"Cash flow is the number one problem we're trying to solve for small businesses.\"\n\nPutting the service in front of customers in banking apps where people keep their money is a key next step, TransferWise Chief Technology Officer Harsh Sinha told us, because 75% of the money-transfer company's users have been coming from word of mouth. He added that 25% of the company's total revenue comes from the US right now.\n\n\"So we either embed TransferWise, or we can ask people to get out of their workflow and come to our site,\" he said. \"We think embedding TransferWise into their workflows is more convenient.\"\n\nTransferWise says it charges fees around 1% for cross-border transfers, whereas the global average cross-border transaction fee is closer to 7%. It says that more than 20% of its transfers are delivered in less than 20 seconds.\n\nIn the US, TransferWise launched a borderless account and debit card last year \u2014 that card works around the world and lets people pay regardless of the currency they are spending in.\n\nEarlier this month, global money-transfer firm MoneyGram, long seen as a cash-to-cash business, announced that it will now offer real-time, digital peer-to-peer direct deposit to Visa debit cards. That means that using the MoneyGram app or website, users will be able to send money to any Visa debit card. There is a fixed $1.99 fee per transfer, and the service will only be available in the US for now.\n\nRead more: MoneyGram launches direct Visa debit card payments\n\nThe TransferWise launch with US banks comes a week after the company reported strong revenue growth and a third straight year of profitability.\n\nThe company says it serves some 6 million people around the world, and processes some $4.9 billion in domestic and cross-border customer payments every month. It has more than 1,700 employees in 12 global offices, and said when it released its latest financials that it is planning to hire 750 more in the next year.\n\nK\u00e4\u00e4rmann said that TransferWise is looking for partnerships with both larger institutional banks and newer challenger banks. But smaller firms may offer the most logical opportunity.\n\n\"We certainly see that the smaller banks are faster, more nimble adopters. It's easier to integrate into their tech stack,\" said K\u00e4\u00e4rmann.\n\nRead more: TransferWise, a fast-growing money transfer startup valued at $3.5 billion, just turned in a third straight year of profit\n\nTransferWise offers borderless accounts and multi-currency debit cards. TransferWise\n\nThe journey of listing\n\nTransferWise doesn't seem to be in any rush to join the ranks of startups that went public this year and are now trading below their IPO price.\n\nTransferWise's last fundraising was a secondary share sale, which brought their valuation to $3.5 billion. This kind of fundraising, which gives early investors and employee shareholders an opportunity to realize returns, can relieve pressure on a startup to rush toward an IPO.\n\n\"The market has given us the flexibility where we can raise funding in private markets and we can bring on investors by offering liquidity to our employees or early investors,\" said K\u00e4\u00e4rmann. \"We can do all those things without embarking on the journey of listing.\"\n\nRead more: Tech IPO injury report: Some of the biggest names in tech have taken a beating after going public this year\n\n\"The company has all the components to have a successful listing,\" he said. \"If we're going to go on the journey of listing, we have to rationalize it from our customer's perspective.\"\n\nK\u00e4\u00e4rmann said that the company still has plenty of work to do in the international payments space.\n\n\"We are very early in fixing the international payments, or international money in general,\" he said. K\u00e4\u00e4rmann is confident that TransferWise will be able to achieve its goal of changing the international payments industry by offering cheaper and faster services than legacy banks.\n\n\"It was really just a hypothesis back then, until a couple of years ago when we reached profitability. That's when the hypothesis actually became true,\" K\u00e4\u00e4rmann said.\n\nTransferWise investors include Lead Edge Capital (which backed Uber and Spotify), Andreessen Horowitz (early backer of Facebook and Lyft), Valar Ventures (backer of Stash and N26), and entrepreneur Richard Branson.\n\nTransferWise markets itself as a revolution. TransferWise\n\nBalancing product development with marketing\n\nWe asked what TransferWise may have done differently to achieve profitability six years after its launch in 2011. \"Where tech companies and other startups trip up more often is in marketing,\" K\u00e4\u00e4rmann said.\n\n\"The more expensive the marketing package, the more you'll have to charge your customers,\" he said, emphasizing that the math is pretty simple. \"So many startups that get tripped up on this, and let their marketing costs balloon without really bringing in the customers that are willing to pay for that.\"\n\nTransferWise markets itself as a revolution in international payments, appealing to a global customer base that is drawn to transparency and efficiency. To be sure, it's engaged in its own high-profile campaign \u2014 Tan France, of Netflix's Queer Eye, is the face of TransferWise's borderless account and debit card.\n\n\"His personal story resonates well with why we launched the borderless account, and why we started issuing the debit card,\" said K\u00e4\u00e4rmann. France is from the UK, lives in Salt Lake City, UT, and films Queer Eye in LA.", "description": "TransferWise's CEO spoke to BI about the US launch of TransferWise for Banks, his thoughts on an IPO, and how the startup became profitable.", "authors": ["Shannen Balogh"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5ce41c05021b4c088d286e17-960-480.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
