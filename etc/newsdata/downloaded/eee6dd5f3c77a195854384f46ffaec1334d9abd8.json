The act now outlines, amongst others, an appeals process that will enable a minister's decision--over what constitutes as falsehood--to be challenged at the cost of S$200 and to be heard in the High Court within nine days.\n\nThese details and others were announced through a series of notices published Wednesday on the electronic Government Gazette, with the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA) officially kicking in on the same day (October 2).\n\nSingapore's proposed law against online falsehoods gives government 'full discretion' over definition Government's proposed bill to combat online falsehoods gives the administration \"full discretion\" on whether a piece of content is deemed true or false and this level of \"overreach\" poses significant risks to freedom of expression, cautions an industry group representing major internet and technology companies including Facebook, Google, and Twitter.

Industry players and observers expressed concerns the law would afford the Singapore government \"full discretion\" over whether a piece of content was deemed true or false.\n\nUnder POFMA, two criteria requirements must be met for the law to apply: there must be a false statement of fact and it must be in the public interest to act. It also does not cover criticisms, satire or parody, and opinions. Comments on falsehoods also are excluded, though, the Law Ministry has cautioned that \"care\" should be exercised to \"avoid repeating\" the falsehood. It also assures that the act will not be used to punish people for sharing falsehoods \"in ignorance [and] good faith\".\n\nUnder the new legislation, Singapore ministers have the authority to decide whether to act against a false statement as well as instruct the falsehood be taken down or corrected.\n\nThe act states that ministers must issue a notice of their decision on an application to \"vary or cancel\" a directive within two working days, and the courts have six working days to schedule a hearing date after an appeal has been filed. This means an appeal can be heard in the High Court within nine days of its filing.\n\nIt will cost S$200 to submit an appeal and the applicant will bear no charges for first three days of court hearing.\n\nPOFMA also lists companies that will be subject to the act, including internet intermediaries, digital advertising intermediaries, and media companies such as Google, Facebook, Twitter, WeChat, and Baidu. These organisations must adhere to the stated codes of practice so their platforms cannot be used to spread falsehoods, according to the act.\n\nSome of the companies have been given temporary exemption from the law, so they have additional time to implement \"the necessary arrangements and technological measures\" to ensure compliance with the act. These include the likes of Facebook, Google, Twitter, and WeChat.\n\nPOFMA outlines three kinds of offences: spreading falsehoods knowing these are false and will or likely to harm public interest; making a bot with the intent of using it to spread falsehoods; and providing services to facilitate the distribution of falsehoods in return for rewards.\n\nOffenders face up to three or five years' imprisonment, S$30,000 or S$50,000 fine, or both fine and imprisonment. If bot or inauthentic accounts are used to amplify falsehoods, penalties are doubled.\n\nOffending internet intermediaries also face up to S$1 million fine, and S$100,000 fine per day for continuing offence after conviction.\n\nRELATED COVERAGE\n\nSingapore Parliament passes Bill against online falsehoods amidst heated debate\n\nAs expected, the Singapore government has voted to pass the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Bill despite strong calls from industry observers and global technology companies to reassess the legislation, which they say gives the government far-reaching powers over online communication.\n\nSingapore urged to make changes to proposed bill against online falsehoods\n\nGovernment should cement its pledge not to use the law to stifle free speech by amending key components in the draft bill, such as including a clause to clearly state the act is not targeted at opinions and parody and creating an independent council to monitor online falsehoods, urge Singapore's Nominated Members of Parliament.\n\nSingapore's proposed law against online falsehoods gives government 'full discretion' over definition\n\nGovernment's proposed bill to combat online falsehoods gives the administration \"full discretion\" on whether a piece of content is deemed true or false and this level of \"overreach\" poses significant risks to freedom of expression, cautions an industry group representing major internet and technology companies including Facebook, Google, and Twitter.\n\nSingapore introduces Bill to fight fake news\n\nIf the legislation is passed, social media platforms may be ordered by government to disable accounts spreading fake news.\n\nSingapore questions social media giants over 'online falsehoods'\n\nTwitter, Google, and Facebook faced a parliamentary committee set up to examine the impact of \"deliberate online falsehoods\"--with Facebook, specifically, grilled over the Cambridge Analytica breach.", "description": "Passed in May 2019 after a brief debate, the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Bill comes into effect from October 2 and includes an appeals process that costs S$200 to file and must be heard in the High Court within nine days.", "authors": ["Eileen Yu"], "top_image": "https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/08/08/95e9f037-1edb-11e4-8c7f-00505685119a/thumbnail/770x578/c6040b0467c52866abcfe39d567d3543/glowing-keyboard-hacker-security-620x465-v2.jpg"}
