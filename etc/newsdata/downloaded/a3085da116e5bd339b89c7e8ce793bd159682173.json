The 27 year-old Scot could feel positively Lilliputian as he walks out alongside South Africa\u2019s Kevin Anderson.\n\nThe 6ft 8in giant from Johannesburg is the fourth of seven men whom Murray will have to beat between now and next Sunday to successfully defend his title.\n\nWith the way he has played so far, it is easy to forget that last year\u2019s winner has not reached any final since \u2014 the process of returning to his best proving lengthy after back surgery and a change of coach.\n\nFor now, the temptation has to be resisted of thinking ahead to potentially sumptuous matches later in the week, a possible quarter-final against the coming man Grigor Dimitrov and a semi that would be a repeat of the 2013 final against Novak Djokovic.\n\nAnderson is more dangerous than anyone Murray has met in the previous rounds, even if he looks like he might have got lost on his way to the nearest basketball court.\n\nTall order: Giant South African Kevin Anderson (left) will face Murray on Monday\n\nHigh society: Anderson returns to Fabio Fognini of Italy in their third round match\n\nHe shares something with Murray in that he first got into the game via playing swingball. He graduated to the local junior circuit, where one of his rivals was the prodigiously talented AB de Villiers, now one of the world\u2019s finest cricketers.\n\nAnderson left South Africa for three years on the American college circuit playing for Illinois State, where he was initially known as someone who only pushed the ball gently around and failed to harness his enormous levers.\n\nAt 28 that has all changed and he is one of the most ferocious ball strikers on the tour, aside from having the hefty serve you would expect. If a rally lasts more than half-a-dozen shots, he is likely to pull the trigger and try to end it with a death-or-glory winner.\n\nWhen Murray was in the final last year, the genial giant found himself rooting for the home player and accepts that he has to play the villain when the match starts at around 3pm on Monday.\n\n\u2018You couldn\u2019t help but hope for Andy last year,\u2019 he admitted. \u2018I really enjoy watching Novak play but at this tournament, given the history, Andy had a lot of support, even from other players.\n\n\u2018Maybe I\u2019ll be the bad guy but I need to try to block that out. Andy has won it now, so I guess there\u2019s no need for him to go on and win two in a row!\n\n\n\nStar status: Niall Horan (second right) and Liam Payne (third left) of One Direction attend Wimbledon\n\n\u2018It will be amazing just to play on Centre Court, not many people in this sport do it. It will be a great experience but I am there to win the match.\u2019\n\nAnderson is a good athlete, to the point where he was once a promising 800 metres runner.\n\nBut while he moves well for someone of his size, he can expect to be dragged all over the court in rallies by Murray, a master manipulator of the tennis ball.\n\nMurray\u2019s uncommon eye picks up a big serve early and is a major factor in why he has compiled such a good record against tall players, whom he teases by keeping the ball sliced low. Anderson\u2019s serve is a weapon, although just below the most devastating in the game.\n\nHe has delivered 63 aces in three matches so far but been broken six times in 56 service games \u2014 and none of his opponents returns as well as Murray. If he keeps his composure as well as he has so far, Murray should come through.\n\nHe has enjoyed the experience of being defending champion and was cheerful on Sunday amid the eerie calm of Wimbledon on its traditional rest day. \u2018I think after winning it last year, the pressure of wanting to win definitely was finally released,\u2019 said Murray. \u2018Obviously I\u2019m still feeling the pressure and the nerves but this year they are completely different. I like having the nerves and I\u2019m able to use them positively.\u2019\n\n\n\nBig time: Murray's celebrity status was boosted by his Wimbledon glory in 2013\n\nThis week is also a huge test for his new coach Amelie Mauresmo, although their relationship has clearly worked well to date.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s great having Amelie around. She\u2019s a very calm person but also incredibly supportive, so naturally that helps me,\u2019 said Murray.\n\n\u2018She\u2019s also a great listener and if I have any concerns she\u2019ll listen to them and then we\u2019ll work through them in practice.\n\n\u2018She has been over to the house a few times but she\u2019s not living with us. It\u2019s quite important to give each other space, particularly during the Grand Slams as you can spend a lot of time together.\u2019", "description": "MIKE DICKSON: Andy Murray knew things had changed a week ago when he walked out on Centre Court to the kind of pop star reception not witnessed since the exceptional days of the London 2012 tennis event.", "authors": ["Mike Dickson For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/06/30/article-0-1A01770E00000578-360_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2014-06-30"}
