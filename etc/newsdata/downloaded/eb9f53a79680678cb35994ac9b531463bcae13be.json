I was horrified. I was so taken aback by it when I looked in the mirror as I then felt like a chipmunk.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s definitely had a lasting impact. As someone who always had problems with dieting and body image and weight loss and weight gain, I\u2019m very conscious of my face and whether I look like a chipmunk.\n\nShe became very conscious about her weight (Picture: Becca Jones /SWNS.COM)\n\n\u2018Whenever someone makes eye contact, I always wonder whether they\u2019re thinking that I look odd.\u2019\n\nAfter her treatment with the Teenage Cancer Trust\u2019s unit in Southampton, she quickly lost two-and-a-half stone.\n\nShe said: \u2018As I haven\u2019t always had the most positive body image, I had to remind myself that the weight loss wasn\u2019t a healthy situation.\n\n\u2018Before my diagnosis I was really active and going to the gym all the time, but during my weight loss I was feeling really weak and helpless, as I felt like there was nothing I could do about the changes.\u2019\n\nOnce her intensive chemotherapy finished, Becca needed another two years of \u2018maintenance treatment\u2019, taking tablets daily.\n\nShe said: \u2018I was able to go back to college during this time but that was tough in some ways. Losing my hair really affected my confidence as it makes up a big part of how you look.\n\nBecca Jones while undergoing cancer treatement , giving her what one doctor called\\\u2019steroid face\u2019 (Picture: Becca Jones /SWNS.COM)\n\n\u2018I didn\u2019t realise how badly it would affect me. I didn\u2019t mind having no hair or wispy hair as much when I was at the unit, but I wore a wig to college.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I took it off at one point and someone said: \u2018Why don\u2019t you keep it on for a bit longer.\u2019 I think they meant if I was unsure about taking it off, but it had taken courage to take it off and it knocked my confidence.\u2019\n\nOne day, Becca took off her wig and a pal said she \u2018loved\u2019 her hair.\n\nShe said: \u2018It gave me such a boost and I remember it even now.\n\n\u2018My hair grew back really differently and curly, and my friends all told me how much they loved my curls.\u2019\n\nNow 21 and starting a new job as a physiotherapist in a Canterbury hospital, she is taking part in the Teenage Cancer Trust\u2019s campaign Still Me.\n\nShe said: \u2018People don\u2019t really understand the mental health impact of cancer.\n\n\u2018While a lot of people understand the turmoil of cancer, the physical impacts, it can drastically change how you feel about yourself as a teenager.\n\n\u2018Even though we\u2019ve had cancer, we\u2019re still the people we used to be.\n\n\u2018We\u2019re almost better as we\u2019ve made it through adversity.\u2019\n\nKate Collins, chief executive of the Teenage Cancer Trust, said: \u2018People like Becca are sharing their experiences of how they coped and this will do so much to help other people facing similar issues.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018We\u2019re really proud and grateful she is part of our #StillMe campaign.\u2019\n\nMORE: Skin infection cellulitis makes baby look like she has a black eye\n\nMORE: How to avoid getting jealous when your friends hang out without you\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "A young cancer survivor is learning to love herself again after a cruel doctor told her she had a steroid face.", "authors": ["Hattie Gladwell"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_90179969_1571308981.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
