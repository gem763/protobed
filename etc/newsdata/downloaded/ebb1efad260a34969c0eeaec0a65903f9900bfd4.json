But never for violence to take place. Especially to students in THE BAND of the rival university. No \u2018alleges\u2019 no \u2018maybes\u2019. This happened.\u201d\n\n\u201cA fan shoved me out of his way as we were marching in formation back to the buses,\u201d Knopp told the Gazette newspaper in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. \u201cHe decided to cut through the band and shoved me out of his way. I yelled, \u2018Do not put your hands on me, sir,\u2019 and he yelled back, \u2018[expletive] you.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cA girl\u2019s ribs are broken because of fan interaction,\u201d he added. \u201cA member of the band was cornered by a number of males and was assaulted.\u201d\n\nIowa Athletic Director Gary Barta said Monday he had been informed of \u201cinappropriate actions\u201d toward the band and said the school would investigate. Iowa State officials pledged to look into the allegations, too, according to the Gazette, though Iowa State Athletics Director Jamie Pollard said Iowa had yet to share specific allegations from the band members. Pollard said Iowa State would look at the security camera footage at Jack Trice Stadium to spot potential fan misbehavior.\n\nBut later in the week Barta and Pollard released a joint statement condemning \u201crude, vulgar, and in some cases, violent\u201d conduct directed at both bands in recent years. Barta on Thursday said both schools\u2019 investigations had concluded, according to the Iowa City Press-Citizen.\n\na brand new joint statement from Gary Barta and Jamie Pollard. so that might be that as far as the band incident goes pic.twitter.com/7Kkm20WQn9 \u2014 noah (@noahrohlfing) September 18, 2019\n\nThat frustrated band members, who learned the investigation had ended while rehearsing.\n\n\u201cI had experienced assault and others were injured,\u201d Nathan Topping, another band member, told the Gazette, \u201cand to drop the investigation really lost our trust and support of the athletic department at that point.\u201d\n\nThe band continued sharing accounts of the alleged abuse online, which led the university to resume its investigation on Friday.\n\n\u201cThe communication on social media made it clear we had not shared enough information with our students about the steps the university has taken to address the concerns raised by members of our marching band,\u201d an Iowa spokeswoman said in a statement provided to The Washington Post. \u201cStudent safety is our number one priority and we are committed to ensuring a safe experience on game day for our students. Additionally we are continuing our investigation to ensure all of our students have the ability to share their experiences with the appropriate authorities.\u201d\n\nIowa band members and representatives from Iowa State did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nA Friday letter to band members from Iowa Deputy Athletics Director Barbara Burke and Music School Director Tammie Walker called the last week \u201cdifficult\u201d and offered members \u201cunconditional support.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour safety is of paramount concern to each of us at the university and while we cannot change what occurred last Saturday, we can work to prevent it from occurring again \u2014 and that is what we are committed to doing,\u201d the letter read.\n\nRead more from The Post:\n\nHow Michael Vick\u2019s dogfighting case changed animal welfare\n\nKansas to reportedly receive NCAA notice of major violations within basketball program\n\nIranian judo team suspended after athlete pressured to avoid fighting an Israeli\n\nIn diverse Toronto, the Raptors\u2019 sports hijab is hailed as a win for inclusivity", "description": "\u201cThe communication on social media made it clear we had not shared enough information with our students about the steps the university has taken to address the concerns raised by members of our marching band,\u201d an Iowa spokeswoman said in a statement.", "authors": ["Jacob Bogage", "National Sports Writer"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BPH7MRGNEII6TJRABKIWK3L5WY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
