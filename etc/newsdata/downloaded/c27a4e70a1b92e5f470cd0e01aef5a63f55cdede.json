It took lessons from the U.S.", "language": "en", "text": "Turkey\u2019s claim would be laughable if the situation were not so dire. There is little evidence that the Kurdish fighters in Syria posed a significant security threat to Turkey, and there was certainly no new threat that would justify the sudden attack. The only new development was President Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw U.S. troops and U.S. air support from the region, allowing Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to launch an attack without fear of American retaliation.\n\nWhere could Erdogan possibly have gotten the idea that he could use a claim of self-defense to justify launching an aggressive attack on the sovereign territory of another state? He got it from us. Erdogan was exploiting a loophole the United States and other members of the Security Council have created and expanded over time.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs originally conceived, the self-defense justification for the use of force was extremely narrow. The 1945 U.N. Charter, which the United States drafted, states that all U.N. members \u201cshall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.\u201d There are just three exceptions: First, the Security Council (made up of five permanent members and a rotating cast of other member states) can authorize an intervention \u201cto maintain or restore international peace and security.\u201d Second, a state may consent to the use of force by another state on its territory (for instance, Afghanistan and Iraq are consenting to U.S. military operations to assist them in combating insurgent groups). Third, if a member state is subjected to an \u201carmed attack,\u201d it can take necessary and proportional steps to defend itself. It is allowed to do so \u201cuntil the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security\u201d \u2014 which could include authorizing states to use force to repel the aggressor.\n\nThe authors of the charter were aware that an expansive right of self-defense \u2014 permitting states to launch a \u201cdefensive\u201d war in response to an arms buildup by a rival state, for instance \u2014 could undo the charter\u2019s prohibition on the use of force. So they deliberately wrote it narrowly, specifying there must first be an \u201carmed attack.\u201d But that limited exception has been stretched beyond recognition over time, including by the United States and its allies.\n\nIn 1984, after bombings of the U.S. Embassy and U.S. military facilities in Beirut, President Ronald Reagan issued a classified national security decision directive (finally declassified in 2010) claiming: \u201cState-sponsored terrorist activity or directed threats of such action are considered to be hostile acts and the U.S. will hold sponsors accountable. Whenever we have evidence that a state is mounting or intends to conduct an act of terrorism against us, we have a responsibility to take measures to protect our citizens, property, and interests.\u201d The directive offered the first sign of a shift in U.S. government thinking toward addressing terrorist threats through more proactive \u2014 even preemptive \u2014 action.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt was not until the administration of President George W. Bush, however, that claims of preemptive self-defense became a public centerpiece of U.S. military policy. The \u201cBush Doctrine\u201d endorsed preemptive strikes as a defense against immediate or perceived future security threats. In a 2002 speech, Bush declared that \u201cthe war on terror will not be won on the defensive. We must take the battle to the enemy, disrupt his plans and confront the worst threats before they emerge.\u201d He soon launched a war against Iraq to \u201cdefend\u201d the United States from weapons of mass destruction \u2014 weapons that turned out not to exist. The resulting conflagration destabilized the Middle East and gave rise to the insurgent group known as \u201cal-Qaeda in Iraq,\u201d which later became the Islamic State.\n\nPresident Barack Obama rejected the Bush Doctrine, broadly speaking, but he continued to justify U.S. military operations under an expansive understanding of self-defense. In 2014, the Obama administration sent a letter to the United Nations announcing plans to engage in \u201cnecessary and proportionate military actions in Syria\u201d against the Islamic State and al-Qaeda elements in Syria, based on the Article 51 right of self-defense on behalf of Iraq (which had requested U.S. assistance), the United States itself \u201cand our partners in the region and beyond.\u201d\n\nThe Obama administration\u2019s letter drew on a controversial interpretation of the self-defense doctrine: It argued that when a state is \u201cunable or unwilling\u201d to prevent the use of its territory for attacks on other states, other states may use military force on that state\u2019s territory to prevent those attacks. Even after the direct threat to Iraq dissipated, military operations against the Islamic State in Syria continued. (The United States was not alone in using this argument to intervene in Syria; other notable participants included Britain and France.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Trump administration continued the operations in Syria under the same theory \u2014 even well after the Islamic State had lost control over any significant territory. It then took the argument a step further, pioneering yet another twist on the self-defense argument. The administration claimed the right to engage in \u201ccollective self-defense of Coalition partnered forces\u201d to justify its downing, in June 2017, of a Syrian jet on Syrian territory after the jet dropped bombs near the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces.\n\nGiven this pattern, it is not hard to see why Turkey would feel emboldened to assert the right of self-defense to attack those very same forces. As a result, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, whose members fought alongside U.S. troops against the Islamic State for years, will be forced to leave northern Syria or be slaughtered when the cease-fire ends. The conflagration will further destabilize the region, lead to the release of thousands of Islamic State fighters and supporters, and strengthen the hand of the Russian and Iranian governments in Syria.\n\nThe terrible situation on the border between Turkey and Syria demonstrates that when the United States and its allies construct convenient arguments to justify stretching, and even breaking, the rules of the international legal order, other states will use those same arguments to suit their own purposes. We may realize too late that eroding the international rules constraining use of force will do more to undermine our security than to strengthen it.\n\nAD", "description": "Turkey justified its attack on Syrian Kurdish fighters as \"self-defense.\"", "authors": ["Oona Hathaway", "Oona Hathaway Is A Professor Of Law", "Political Science At Yale University", "Co-Author Of", "The Internationalists", "How A Radical Plan To Outlaw War Remade The World."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/jLv-4yW4AREM1zAear66KXoj3f4=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CMIKR5XUZMI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
