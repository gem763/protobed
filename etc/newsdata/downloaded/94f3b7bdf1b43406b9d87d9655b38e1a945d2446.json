That night, I woke up just after midnight with pain and pressure in my chest.\n\n'At first I thought it might be indigestion but I quickly realised that something wasn't right and my husband called an ambulance.\n\n'When the paramedics arrived they said they thought I was having a heart attack. I looked at my husband and just started sobbing. I guess I was in shock and my first thought was that I was going to die.'\n\nThe British Heart Foundation (BHF) told MailOnline that heart attack sufferers can experience a wide variety of symptoms.\n\nThe Mayo Clinic says heartburn - which can cause a sour taste in the mouth - can be a symptom of a heart attack. It is not clear if Mrs McGill suffered from this.\n\nFigures suggest there are 200,000 hospital visits because of heart attacks in the UK each year, while there are around 800,000 annually in the US.\n\nThe mother-of-two woke up in the middle of the night with excruciating pains in her chest and was rushed to hospital\n\nShe had returned from a family day out with her husband and twin daughters and sat down to enjoy a glass of red\n\nMrs McGill's left coronary artery, which supplies blood to the left part of her heart, had closed and blocked blood from reaching the organ.\n\nShe was rushed to the Freeman Hospital in Newcastle where she had a plastic tube, known as a stent, fitted to keep the artery wedged open.\n\nShe added: 'As soon as the stent was put in place I immediately began to feel better.\n\n'I couldn't believe it was that quick. The surgeon said there is a second blockage in my other artery, but it's not big enough to need a stent.'\n\nThe mother is now urging other women to prioritise their heart health from a young age, as she feels that many women think that a heart attack won't happen to them.\n\nShe said: 'Looking back at the week before I was really tired and working long hours and juggling life with the kids.\n\n'Two nights after I got back from work I literally fell asleep on the sofa, which was really unusual for me.\n\n'I thought I'd just hit a wall because of being a busy working mum - which I realise now is a typical female response.'\n\nMrs McGill added: 'Women I meet at work and socialising don't always know the warning signs of a heart attack.\n\n'I had extreme tiredness before mine, but thought it was just because I was busy. I am more conscious of how I eat and what I eat now.\n\nWHAT IS A HEART ATTACK? Figures suggest there are 200,000 hospital visits because of heart attacks in the UK each year, while there are around 800,000 annually in the US. A heart attack, known medically as a myocardial infarction, occurs when the supply of blood to the heart is suddenly blocked. Symptoms include chest pain, shortness of breath, and feeling weak and anxious. Heart attacks are commonly caused by coronary heart disease, which can be brought on by smoking, high blood pressure and diabetes. Treatment is usually medication to dissolve blots clots or surgery to remove the blockage. Reduce your risk by not smoking, exercising regularly and drinking in moderation. Heart attacks are different to a cardiac arrest, which occurs when the heart suddenly stops pumping blood around the body, usually due to a problem with electrical signals in the organ.

I wouldn't want anyone to go through what I went through.'\n\nMrs McGill's case comes as the BHF launches a new briefing which reveals stark inequalities in awareness, diagnosis and treatment of heart attacks are killing women in the UK.\n\nThe BHF says its new research shows women often delay seeking medical help by more than two hours, reducing their chance of survival.\n\nIt estimates that more than 8,200 women in England and Wales alone died over a 10-year period because they did not receive equal treatment to men.\n\nDr Sonya Babu-Narayan, consultant cardiologist and associate medical director of the British Heart Foundation, said heart attacks have never been so treatable.\n\nShe added: 'Yet women are dying needlessly because heart attacks are often seen as a man's disease, and women simply don't receive the same standard of treatment as men.\n\n'The studies detailed in this briefing have revealed inequalities at every stage of a woman's medical journey, and though complex to dissect, they add up to a societal failure to provide fair care for women. Together, we must change this.'\n\nDr Babu-Narayan said the first steps to closing this gender gap include tackling the public perception of women and heart attacks, adding: 'The assumption that women are not at risk of heart attack is false, and has proven to be deadly.\n\n'The BHF wants to empower women to better understand their risk and to know the many symptoms of a heart attack. When someone has a heart attack - every second counts.\n\n'The sooner people recognise their symptoms and call 999, the better their chance of recovery.\n\n'In addition, we need to continue to fund research to better prevent, diagnose and treat heart attacks.\n\n'We also need to raise national awareness of gender based inequalities in heart attack care and identify and guard against unconscious biases that could contribute to them.'", "description": "Louise McGill, 47, from County Durham, noticed the unusual flavour in her wine two years ago after returning from a family day out with her twin daughters.", "authors": ["Connor Boyd Health Reporter For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/13/19739970-0-image-a-13_1571143834798.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
