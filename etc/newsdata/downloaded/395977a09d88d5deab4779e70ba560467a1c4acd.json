The terms have not been disclosed.\n\nOn Tuesday, Mr Pozner emphasised that the case was not about First Amendment protections for free speech.\n\n\"Mr Fetzer has the right to believe that Sandy Hook never happened. He has the right to express his ignorance,\" he said, according to the Wisconsin State Journal.\n\n\"This award, however, further illustrates the difference between the right of people like Mr Fetzer to be wrong and the right of victims like myself and my child to be free from defamation, free from harassment and free from the intentional infliction of terror.\"\n\nMr Pozner's lawyer Genevieve Zimmerman described Mr Fetzer's claims in both the 2015 book and 2018 blog post as \"alt-right opium\".\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Alex Jones faces multiple defamation suits related to his claims about Sandy Hook\n\nIt is one of several defamation cases launched in the wake of Sandy Hook, many led by Mr Pozner.\n\nHe and Noah's mother, Veronique De La Rosa, have also sued prominent conspiracy theorist Alex Jones for defamation. The pending case is one of at least five faced by Mr Jones.\n\nLast week, a Texas court ruled that Mr Jones could not invoke free-speech law to end a separate suit, waged by Scarlett Lewis, the mother of Sandy Hook victim Jesse Lewis.\n\nParents of Sandy Hook victims who have spoken publicly about their experiences have been targeted by trolls, both online, as well as in person.", "description": "A massacre denier is told to compensate the father of a child killed in the 2012 school shooting.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/840E/production/_109260833__100916116_56d97770-1c19-4a25-b629-4f38b8d68814.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
