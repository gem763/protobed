You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\n\u201cWhen the only American citizen President Trump singles out for China\u2019s investigation is his political opponent in the midst of the Democratic nomination process, it strains credulity to suggest that it is anything other than politically motivated,\u201d Romney tweeted. And he followed that by adding an outright condemnation: \u201cBy all appearances, the President\u2019s brazen and unprecedented appeal to China and to Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden is wrong and appalling.\u201d\n\nThe next day, Trump unleashed a predictably venomous rant on Twitter, dismissing Romney as a \u201ca pompous \u2018ass\u2019\u201d and calling for him to be impeached. Trump is a stupid man but he can occasionally be astute with respect to the aims of his political rivals. He clearly felt that Romney was a threat when he sent out those tweets; that\u2019s what he does when he fears former supporters turning against him. And Vanity Fair\u2019s Gabriel Sherman reports that Romney may indeed be trying to bring the president down \u2014 only not in the direct way many disgruntled Republicans might like.\n\nA GOP donor reportedly told Sherman: \u201cThere is a half-billion dollars on the sidelines from guys who are fed up with Trump.\u201d But Romney will not be primarying Trump, rightly concluding that the move is doomed \u201cto be a sure loser given Trump\u2019s enduring GOP support.\u201d Moreover, Romney doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s right person to take on the president \u2014 instead, he \u201chas been reaching out privately to key players in the Republican resistance, according to a person briefed on the conversations.\u201d\n\nI know, I know: what Republican resistance? As legend has it, \u201cRomney is the one guy who could bring along Susan Collins, Cory Gardner, Ben Sasse. Romney is the pressure point in the impeachment process. That\u2019s why the things he\u2019s saying are freaking Republicans out.\u201d\n\nThe notion of Mitt Romney leading a GOP-led resistance against Donald Trump in a prospective impeachment trial is understandably laughable. After all, this is the man who disavowed Trump only to suck up to him after he won the 2016 presidential election in a pathetic and failed attempt at becoming Secretary of State. While Romney did disavow Trump\u2019s comments about white supremacists and their actions in Charlottesville, he gleefully accepted Trump\u2019s endorsement for his Senate bid the following year. And yes, although Romney\u2019s recent tweets drew Trump\u2019s ire, they were mildly critical in the grand scheme of things.\n\nYet, I resisted the urge to pile on Romney for not being forceful enough \u2014 because it might now be genuinely useful if he is trying to cajole other Senate Republicans into living up to their oaths.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to say what will come of the impeachment inquiry and likely impeachment trial, but one thing is for certain: support for impeachment and Trump\u2019s removal are both rising in popularity according to multiple polls. Trump\u2019s own antics \u2014 throwing temper tantrums online and on the White House lawn coupled with egregious displays of lawlessness \u2014 are likely to only make those numbers rise. Ultimately, I imagine a Republican or three will try to cement themselves as the next Barry Goldwater, John Rhodes, Hugh Scott \u2014 the Republicans who told Richard Nixon that he all but certainly faced impeachment, which resulted in his resignation the next day.\n\nTrump may not go down so easily, but there is still space for a \u201chero\u201d in the room. It might as well be Mitt Romney. Make no mistake: I don\u2019t believe the man is acting out of principle. A principled man would have never acquiesce to such a vile president whose hobbies include bigotry and contempt for the rule of law.\n\nBut I do know Romney is one of the better opportunists on the right, and there can be value in a useful opportunist. He is someone who can match his careerist interests with some nominal level display of decency in speaking out against Trump and calling on his GOP senators to jump from a sinking ship.\n\nAt this point, I don\u2019t care if Romney is only interested in bolstering his place in history and perhaps running again for president alongside someone like Nikki Haley, another opportunist who claims to be better than Trumpism yet attached herself to it out of self-gain. All I know is that the longer Trump stays in power, the more dangerous it becomes for everyone in this country -- particularly the most vulnerable among us. And if he is allowed to not only remain in office, but potentially extend his presidency for four more years, the tyrant in training wheels will sink this country more than he already has.\n\nHe has to go and everyone needs to get involved, and while I have never, ever liked Mitt Romney and likely will never like Mitt Romney, I can cheer him on as he plots against Trump behind the scenes.\n\nThe resistance could use all the help it can get.", "description": "If you told me even a month ago that the fate of the republic may rest with Mitt Romney, my response likely would have been to say it\u2019s time for me to go back to watching The Handmaid\u2019s Tale in order to prepare for America turning into a real-life Gilead in the not too distant future.", "authors": ["Michael Arceneaux"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/06/13/15/mitt-romney.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
