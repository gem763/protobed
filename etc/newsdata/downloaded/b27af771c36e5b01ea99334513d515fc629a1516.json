In October 2007 \u2014 two months before the Great Recession began \u2014 40% of poll participants felt the same way.\n\n\u2022 For the third straight month, a growing share of Americans said the economy is deteriorating, going from 37% in July to 48% in September. At the same time, fewer people said it\u2019s improving, slipping from 54% to 46%.\n\n\u2022 Republicans are rosy and Democrats are downbeat: 21% of Republicans said a recession will likely happen within a year, while 74% of Democrats said a recession is coming in that time. Independents were evenly split.\n\nGallup noted it conducted the poll from September 3 to 15, as the latest round of Chinese tariffs took effect, but before the latest interest rate cut.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: 3 things NOT to do with your savings now that the Fed has cut interest rates\n\nConsumer perceptions weren\u2019t totally glum. Though 49% of people told Gallup a recession is either fairly likely or very likely, another 50% said a recession isn\u2019t too likely, or not likely at all.\n\nAfter all, there\u2019s still a record-breaking 10-year bull market and a 3.7% unemployment rate, which is around a 50-year low. Like consumers, market experts are also divided. Some brush off recession talk, but others say a downturn will happen by the end of 2020.\n\n\u201cWhile some economic indicators remain strong, many economists are sounding the alarm that a recession is coming in the near future. This latest polling finds that not all Americans are taking that warning to heart,\u201d the Gallup poll said Friday.", "description": "People are evenly split one whether a recession will hit in the next 12 months.", "authors": ["Andrew Keshner"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR744_wave_s_ZG_20190920105637.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
