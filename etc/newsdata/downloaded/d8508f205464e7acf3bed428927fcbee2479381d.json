It's a key test run as Qantas prepares to start direct commercial services connecting Sydney with New York and London as soon as 2022.\n\nQantas's Boeing 787 Dreamliner will carry only about 50 passengers and crew to give the plane the range to reach Sydney on Sunday without stopping.\n\nAs part of research aimed at reducing jet lag, passengers on board will in effect switch to Sydney time as soon as they leave New York late Friday, Qantas said. Rather than following the standard practice of serving food and dimming the lights after takeoff, Qantas plans to keep everyone awake for six hours. They'll be helped by food containing hot peppers and spices.\n\n\"The passenger research will test alternatives to how airlines have managed in-flight service for decades,\" Qantas chief executive officer Alan Joyce said. The industry's traditional schedule may not be the best way to switch the body clock to the destination's time zone, he said.\n\nQantas's Boeing 787 Dreamliner will carry only about 50 passengers and crew to give the plane the range to reach Sydney on Sunday without stopping.
