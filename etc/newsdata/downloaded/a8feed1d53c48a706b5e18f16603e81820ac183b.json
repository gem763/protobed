It came into effect the following day.\n\nThe protest movement originally began in opposition to an extradition bill now withdrawn from the legislature but has now widened into a pro-democracy campaign.\n\nMany of the protesters throughout the campaign have been wearing face masks.\n\nExplaining how the ban will work, Secretary for Security John Lee said it would apply for approved rallies and marches, as well as in unlawful assemblies and riots.\n\nHowever, the authorities will allow for exemptions for people wearing masks for health reasons, or if required by their profession.\n\nThe ban covers all kinds of facial covering, including facepaint.\n\nWhile for protesters face masks may provide a way of hiding identity from family, employers and the authorities, they are also popular throughout the region for a variety of different reasons. Here are some.\n\nREAD MORE: All primary school children to be offered free flu vaccine for first time\n\nFace masks have been banned in Hong Kong following protests [Photo: Getty] More\n\nHealth\n\nThough it isn\u2019t known exactly when wearing face masks started becoming normal practice in Hong Kong and other East Asian regions, it is believed popularity originally started spiking around 2003, during a Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) outbreak. People started donning their masks to help prevent infection from respiratory droplets.\n\nThat was quickly followed by the bird flu epidemic in 2006.\n\n\u201cFace masks can help protect against viral and airborne diseases,\u201d says Dr Diana Gall at www.doctor-4-u.co.uk\n\n\u201dIn Hong Kong they have experienced outbreaks of Sars, which displays similar symptoms to the cold and flu, and in some cases there are a number of fatalities in an outbreak, as Hong Kong experienced.\n\n\u201cThis disease spreads in a similar way to the common cold and is very much an airborne virus. Protecting the mouth and nose from breathing in these fatal viruses and pollution is one important reason why mask-wearing is so prevalent in Hong Kong.\"\n\nAfter a while, it seems people got used to wearing the masks and it became the norm, with some schools even making mask-wearing compulsory if a child was showing symptoms of illness.\n\nThere\u2019s another health explanation associated with the wearing of the masks too. One of the fundamental concepts of traditional Chinese medicine sees breath and breathing as a central element in good health. \u201c\u2018Qi\u2019 is a central concept in Chinese cosmology \u2013 and thereby physiology \u2013 generally having to do with energy and vapour,\u201d Michelle M Ching, a board-certified practitioner of acupuncture and herbal medicine, told QZ.com.\n\n\u201cQi has numerous meanings in Chinese including \u2018air\u2019 [kong qi], \u2018atmosphere\u2019 [qi fen], \u2018odour\u2019 [qi wei], which is perhaps another reason masks are so necessary, \u2018strength\u2019 [li qi] and \u2018pathogen\u2019 [xie qi]. When bodily qi is depleted, or its movement deranged, pain and disease develop. So breathing is critical in order to maintain good qi in the body.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, Naomi Campbell posted her pre-flight routine on YouTube and confessed her fear of people coughing and sneezing on aeroplanes.\n\nAs well as disinfecting her seat with protective wipes, the supermodel also puts on a medical mask to cover her nose and mouth to protect her from breathing in germs.\n\nREAD MORE: Male loneliness: why are men finding it so hard to make friends?\n\nPollution\n\nWith cities around the world seeing a spike in air pollution, face masks are being seen to be of an increasing necessity when stepping outside, particularly in a smoggy city.\n\n\"The main reason for wearing a mask in populated busy cities such as Hong Kong is to protect against pollution,\u201d says Dr Gall.\n\n\u201cPollution can cause long-term damage to the respiratory system, leading to cardiovascular disease and respiratory diseases such as asthma, bronchitis, emphysema, COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and cancer.", "description": "A brief history of face masks and why people wear them.", "authors": ["Marie Claire Dorking"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/4m47xiXy.d_HHIHhesvHMA--~B/aD01MzMzO3c9ODAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/8cb38820-e8ed-11e9-bff7-8068884107a5", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
