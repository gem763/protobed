Reese Witherspoon physically berates an anti-media protester after he calls her a \u201cfake news bitch\u201d. Minutes after we meet him, Steve Carell smashes his flat-screen television with a golf club. And Jennifer Aniston can\u2019t seem to make it through a scene without delivering a loud, impassioned monologue before running off to a private corner to brood.\n\nAll three actors, bright with movie-star wattage and entrusted with headlining the flagship series of the new Apple TV+ streaming service, pitch their respective characters at the same level. It is simultaneously exhausting and heartbreaking. In theory, The Morning Show is Apple TV+\u2019s equivalent of Netflix\u2019s House of Cards \u2013 a slick, starry and expensive drama designed to sell an intriguing new content platform and the kinds of programming it plans to invest in. It should have been a sure-thing, bearing enough potential that it lured Aniston back to television 15 years after Friends went off the air, marked Carell\u2019s first TV venture since The Office, and Witherspoon\u2019s first since the runaway success of Big Little Lies.\n\nAll three are brilliant actors and pop culture figures. But the show they\u2019ve found themselves in is fraught with anxiety about what it is and who it\u2019s for. In the three episodes screened for critics, of a reported 10-episode season (a second has already been commissioned), its agenda never becomes clear.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nAniston and Carell are Alex Levy and Mitch Kessler, broadcasting superstars and the co-hosts of America\u2019s most respected (if ratings-challenged) daytime talk show. Until, that is, Mitch is accused of sexual misconduct by multiple women, leading to his dismissal. Alex is bereft, left not only with feelings of personal betrayal (she had no idea of his behaviour, she claims) but with concern over how his exit will impact her new contract with the series.\n\nMeanwhile, nefarious network executive Cory Ellison (a slimy Billy Crudup) has his curiosity piqued by Witherspoon\u2019s Bradley Jackson, a temperamental reporter for a conservative news outlet in Virginia, whose confrontation with the aforementioned protester goes viral. Hungry for change and with Mitch out of the picture, Cory plots to install Bradley as Alex\u2019s replacement, whether Bradley wants the job or not.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Or Alayned, perhaps.\u201d BBC 15/41 Leaving Neverland (Channel 4) \"Michael Jackson has long looked like a burning tire yard. There were the allegations, the out-of-court settlements, the arrest, the trial and not-guilty verdict. But there has been nothing like Leaving Neverland\u201d AFP/Getty 16/41 Home (Channel 4) \"Home is a rather gentle, unobtrusive variation on the sitcom theme \u2013 but one that is built on a quite a bizarre premise. The twist is that a family who returns to Surrey from a holiday touring around France discover a Syrian refugee stuffed in the back of their SUV. Not only that, but, after a few moments of blind terrified panic about a suicide bombing, they eventually adopt him like he\u2019s stray cat that\u2019s just wandered in.\" Channel 4 17/41 The Murder of Jill Dando (BBC) \"A tremendously sad, strange story then, and just as unfathomable today. Dando\u2019s friends, family and the producer and director of the film have made a fitting and balanced tribute to her, something she deserves. I can\u2019t really add anything to that.\" PA 18/41 Derry Girls (Channel 4) \"It is sometimes remarked that the Troubles in Northern Ireland make for an unpromising backdrop for a sitcom about adolescent kids. Well, yer man\u2019s wrong, as they might say. Derry Girls, returning for a triumphant and exuberant second run, proves that humour, dark or otherwise, can be quarried from even the most unlikely of locations.\" Peter Marley 19/41 Fleabag (BBC) \"While there are plenty of well-turned one-liners, the deeper attraction of Fleabag is schadenfreude. The character is as old as Daisy Buchanan or Lydia Bennett or Scarlett O\u2019Hara. The best compliment to Waller-Bridge and her cast is that they find fresh clothes in which to dress these ancient monsters.\" BBC/Two Brothers/Luke Varley 20/41 Road to Brexit (BBC) \"The Road to Brexit is easily the best thing to emerge from the whole brexit imbroglio. OK, not much competition, but still... Despite the po-faced title, you realise very quickly that it\u2019s not yet another drama starring Benedict Cumberbatch or yet another attempt by Laura Kuenssberg to explain the inexplicable, or yet another show with the public arguing about stuff they don\u2019t understand. Rather, it\u2019s a very clever, very funny, very 'different' parcel of bollocks to Brexit.\" BBC 21/41 Our Planet (Netflix) \"The footage is glorious, especially the side-on tracking shots of the birds and the hunting, where it is as if the cameramen were able to set up a rail along the ocean. Most spectacular of all is the sequence of a glacier collapsing into the ocean, where 75m tons of ice being sloughed off in less than 20-minutes. But at times Our Planet feels a little unfocused. Attenborough\u2019s last big BBC series, Dynasties, won almost unbearable amount of emotional resonance through its focus on animal families. Our Planet is more of a greatest-hits parade, with overblown orchestral soundtrack and ponderous intonation. You can\u2019t buy love, even if you pay for David Attenborough.\" Netflix 22/41 Line of Duty (BBC) \"Plausibility is a spectrum; Bodyguard became ridiculous but Line of Duty stays just the right side, and as usual there is more plot in an hour than in whole series of other programmes. As well as being gripping entertainment, Line of Duty has become an effective examination of the relationship between the state and the individual. The shadowy government forces are elected; the organised crime gangs are fuelled by the drug trade. The police are there to save us from ourselves but can only do it if they are subjected to constant scrutiny. It\u2019s exhausting work, policing the police.\" BBC 23/41 The Virtues \"Joseph is almost never out of shot, whether seen from afar, contemplating a bottle of strong cider in a playground, or in visceral close-up, clutching his doner to his face. There are few actors you could trust with so much screen time, especially with such a pared back and naturalistic script. The fact any of it is remotely watchable is testament to Stephen Graham\u2019s abilities. No man working in Britain today can drink a pint with more pathos.\" Dean Rogers/Channel 4 24/41 Good Omens 'Good Omens is a hugely enjoyable, imaginative premiere, as close to Pratchett\u2019s vision as anyone could have dared dream. And while the melancholy tone may not be for everyone, fans of the book will surely be sated.' Amazon Prime 25/41 Years and Years \"Years and Years, then, is favoured by some wit, a cornucopia of fab talent and promising characters. The dominant one as we continue our quest into the 2030s and beyond, will be Vivienne, or Viv, Rook, played brilliantly by Emma Thompson. As a bit of a long-term Emma-sceptic I was actually startled by how good she is in the role of the epitome of everything she has spent her life hating and campaigning against, for Viv is a horrifically nasty businessperson turned populist politician with the most terrifying of views. Viv Rook makes Ann Widdecombe look like, well, Emma Thompson at an Extinction Rebellion sit-in.\" BBC 26/41 Killing Eve \"As the series develops, it\u2019s clearer than ever that Eve and Villanelle are more similar than they are different. Villanelle\u2019s new vulnerability invites us to question what it is exactly she wants from Polastri. First time around she was toying with a more worthy adversary, but why now? Polastri, by contrast, is frayed around the edges, a terrible wife to her husband Nico (Owen McDonnell) and an even worse intelligence agent to her boss Carolyn Martens (Fiona Shaw). The script is still tight and the jokes are still there, as are Villanelle\u2019s accents, outfits and abrupt killings, but without the will-they/won\u2019t-they energy of the initial plot, it is harder to care.\" BBC/BBC America 27/41 Chernobyl \"Timely, bleak, intelligent and compelling, Chernobyl is a triumph of a disaster.\" HBO 28/41 The Handmaid's Tale \"Season three's knuckle-whitening finale is far less disappointing than the last.\" Hulu 29/41 This Way Up \"The writing is sharp and well observed, probing the fault lines between small talk and real problems.\" Channel 4 30/41 Jade: The Reality Star Who Changed Britain \"A touching tribute to a flawed reality TV star.\" Channel 4 31/41 Succession \"Despite the strength of its ensemble cast, Succession is a feat of writing above all. Although it is ostensibly a business show, you won\u2019t learn much about the minutiae of media deals by watching it. Its key dynamic, between father and children, means that it is limited in the amount that can actually happen without risking the magic. The writers, led by the creator Jesse Armstrong, who also gave us Peep Show, weave just-about-plausible and sympathetic characters from a web of insults and backstabbing, and tight editing and camerawork ratchets up tension from a slow-moving plot.\" HBO 32/41 Kathy Burke\u2019s All Woman \"In Kathy Burke\u2019s All Women on Channel 4, the unapologetic, effing-and-blinding, salt-of-the-earth actor meets lots of different women \u2013 from nuns to reality stars \u2013 to understand what it means to be a member of the fairer sex, so to speak, in 2019.\" Channel 4 33/41 The Capture \"So here we have an intriguing, but rather flawed sort of Big Brother thriller set in our contemporary world of digital snooping, near constant surveillance and (a topical touch) widespread use of facial recognition technology.\" BBC/Heyday Films/Nick Wall 34/41 Top Boy \"Top Boy can be bleak and violent, with dialogue so naturalistic that it verges on the impenetrable, but in telling stories that rarely get heard, it asks us to think differently about the city we live in.\" Netflix 35/41 Criminal \"Criminal uses its small canvas to ask big questions. The focus on these intricate dances means that after a while we begin to question the idea of objective truth, as well as the facts at hand. I have no idea if it is a realistic depiction of detective work, but it makes for gripping drama.\" Netflix 36/41 Tories at War \"After an hour of Tories at War (Channel 4), I felt I had to get out into the fresh air and go for a walk. The foul language; the visceral hatred; the unbearable tensions; the violence being inflicted on ancient institutions and this poor old knackered country by the Tories, as if with chainsaws and zombie knives \u2013 it was like watching my first Saw movie.\" Pro Co 37/41 World on Fire \"In a TV world where too often we are encouraged to see the Nazis as warm and cuddly real people with emotions, it\u2019s refreshing that they are here relegated back to pure baddies, strafing cafes, shooting surrendering fathers and generally being Nazi-ish about things.\" BBC/Mammoth Screen 38/41 Catherine the Great \"At last, an answer to the question, what could be more fabulous than Helen Mirren playing The Queen? Helen Mirren playing an empress, altogether madder, badder and more dangerous to shag. Better costumes, too.\" Sky Atlantic 39/41 Dublin Murders \"Sarah Phelps\u2019s adaptation of crime writer Tana French\u2019s novels finds two detectives trying to solve the murder of a young girl, with plenty of twists and turns.\" BBC 40/41 Modern Love \"Romance is complicated, cathartic and messy, regardless of age or circumstance. But such uncomfortable realities are swept beneath the rug in John Carney\u2019s rigorously whimsical new Amazon series.

But it\u2019s most overt in the sheer number of ideas it\u2019s eager to explore: not just the conflicts and power plays surrounding a daytime talk show (much of which comes off as Aaron Sorkin cosplay) but feminism and misogyny, ageing and morality, ethics and romance, social media and cancel culture, #MeToo and Fake News. It is determined to talk about everything, but often says little at all.\n\nNeither Aniston nor Witherspoon are well-served here. Aniston, so brilliant in dramas that know how to properly use her deadpan neuroses and odd melancholy, is poorly directed, left to sigh, gesticulate and wail to signal Alex\u2019s internal ennui. And Witherspoon seems entirely adrift, buried beneath a distracting wig and struggling her way through exhausting shifts in Bradley\u2019s personality, her character a jumble of talking points rather than anything resembling a consistent human.\n\nThey become more comfortable in the scenes they share together, potentially because of their shared history playing sisters on Friends, but more likely because those scenes are when the series finds a steady groove. The Morning Show is at its best when it is played like a straight-forward soap opera, and embraces melodrama, cliffhanger endings and tense confrontation between directionally opposed characters. It\u2019s also promising that the show rejects All About Eve comparisons early on, with both Alex and Bradley proving much too savvy to go along with the catfight their superiors want them to have.\n\nBut The Morning Show, as is standard for expensive dramas in the age of too-much television, is also desperate to be About Something. And in that regard, it falls flat. Its politics are baffling \u2013 notably Bradley\u2019s insistence on being neither politically red nor blue but \u201chuman\u201d \u2013 and it\u2019s not yet smart enough to say anything insightful when it comes to sexual misconduct in the workplace. Carell\u2019s grim subplot, which appears to revolve around Mitch forming an anti-#MeToo movement of publicly disgraced men, is a particular nadir. And that Donald Trump\u2019s relationship with the truth, and his volatile treatment of the media, is so baked into the fabric of the show while he goes unmentioned by name (unlike, for example, Harvey Weinstein) reads as slightly cowardly. It\u2019s as if The Morning Show has dressed itself in the illusion of thematic bravery, but in truth is commercial, politically centrist and resolutely safe.\n\n\u201cNews is awful,\u201d Cory extolls in one of the show\u2019s many, many monologues about the state of the world today. \u201cHumanity is addicted to it, and the whole world is depressed by it. That\u2019s why what we really need on television right now is not news or f***ing journalism \u2013 it\u2019s entertainment.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s talking about daytime TV, but there\u2019s a lesson in there The Morning Show could learn from. Embrace the melodrama and the soapiness and use these staggeringly skilled superstars to their full effect, and this could be appointment television. Otherwise, it will likely fade into the starry fog of TV series fighting for your already dwindling attention.\n\nThe Morning Show premieres on Apple TV+ this Friday 1 November.
