When he left the store, he shoved Drejka to the ground, surveillance video showed.\n\nDrejka then pulled out a Glock .40-caliber handgun and shot McGlockton in the chest. He later told investigators he was in fear of a physical threat to his safety.\n\nFLORIDA GUN OWNER WHO CLAIMED SELF-DEFENSE CONVICTED IN CASE THAT PUT 'STAND YOUR GROUND' IN SPOTLIGHT\n\nMcGlocktown died at a hospital 30 minutes later.\n\nThe shooting brought national attention to Florida's controversial \"Stand Your Ground\" law, which, since enacted in 2005, established the right for gun owners to apply lethal force to defend themselves against threats regardless of whether it was possible to retreat first.\n\nPinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri initially did not arrest Drejka, saying the controversial law precluded him from doing so. Three weeks passed before Pinellas-Pasco State Attorney Bernie McCabe announced that his office was formally arresting and charging Drejka with manslaughter.\n\nThe case touched on race, given that Drejka was white and McGlocktown was black.\n\nCLICK TO VISIT THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nDrejka on Thursday was sentenced to two decades in prison, with credit for 92 days served, WTVT reported. He faced up to 30 years behind bars.\n\nFox News' Danielle Wallace and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "A Florida man who claimed he fatally shot an unarmed\u00a0man\u00a0in self-defense after the two\u00a0squabbled over a handicapped parking space was sentenced Thursday to 20 years in prison.", "authors": ["Nicole Darrah", "Nicole Darrah Covers Breaking", "Trending News For Foxnews.Com.
