Pour Yourself Some of Your Favorite Wine and Let Ullo Make It Better.", "language": "en", "text": "While wine is my so-called drink of choice, I\u2019m not a wine expert and have no plans to ever become one. But I know I generally like Malbec over Cabernet and Pinot Grigio over Chardonnay. I also know I don\u2019t like sediment in my wine and notice when more affordable wine carries a certain bite on its way down my gullet. After Ullo sent me a sample of its wine purifier, my partner and I plan to purify every bottle we drink henceforth (especially when we have friends over). When we set to test Ullo\u2019s Wine Purifier, we naturally poured an unfiltered glass of red we had lying around (Ullo works just as well with white wine, too) and then poured some through the Ullo. The results for us were very obvious (which actually surprised me given my lack of expertise). The purified wine, which Ullo promises comes out as it was intended, sulfite- and sediment-free, is much, much smoother. And in its smoothness, we both found more flavor. Whatever characteristics smarter drinkers might name and label (\u201cearthy\u201d or \u201cnutty\u201d), I was confident in at least identifying as good and smooth and, well, good. The process is very simple. The Ullo comes with a pack of six filters, which you pop into the ball-like device in less than a second. You then place the Ullo at the top of the carafe it comes with or your preferred glass \u2014it\u2019s designed to fit them all. The wine collects at the top and filters fairly quickly\u2014slightly faster than water journeying through a Brita, I\u2019d say. And that\u2019s it. It\u2019s ready for drinking. Each filter covers a bottle\u2019s worth of wine and additional filters come in 10-packs, going for $30 each. And while the hand-blown carafe accompanying this Ullo purifier is beautiful and versatile, you can also get Ullo\u2019s similarly highly-rated decanter, which gives you the versatility to use with or without the Ullo. Regardless of that stylistic choice, the Ullo Wine Purifier is a must in any home that enjoys wine. | Get it on Amazon >\n\nNEWSLETTERS The Scouted Newsletter Product recommendations that'll make your life better and tips to help you shop smarter.
