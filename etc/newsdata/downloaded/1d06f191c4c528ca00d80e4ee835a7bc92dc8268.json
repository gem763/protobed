It\u2019s a system-wide trigger that gives you a gloomier colour theme across your core Mac apps and any third-party apps that support the feature \u2014 and I think it\u2019s a lot easier on the eyes, but maybe that\u2019s just me.\n\nUpgrade to macOS Catalina, and you\u2019ll even get an extra setting \u2014 \"auto\" \u2014 that will switch your system between Light and Dark mode based on the time. But what if you want manual control over which \u201cmode\u201d you\u2019re using? It\u2019s a pain in the arse to have to navigate through System Preferences to switch between Light and Dark mode. Instead, with a little creativity, you can set up a keyboard shortcut that will warp you between these two worlds faster than Link\u2019s Magic Mirror.\n\nSetting up a keyboard shortcut to toggle dark and light mode in macOS\n\nTo get started, pull up the Automator app within macOS. Click on File > New, and select Quick Action from the menu that appears:\n\nScreenshot: David Murphy\n\nIn the next screen, set the first drop-down for \u201cWorkflow receives current...\u201d from \u201cAutomatic (text)\u201c to \u201cno input.\u201d\n\nScreenshot: David Murphy\n\nThen, click on the little search box above \u201cActivate Fonts\u201d in the second column. Type in \u201cApple,\u201d and double-click on \u201cRun AppleScript. Delete all the purple text in the box that appears and enter this instead (courtesy of AppleInsider):\n\ntell application \"System Events\"\n\ntell appearance preferences\n\nset dark mode to not dark mode\n\nend tell\n\nend tell\n\nScreenshot: David Murphy\n\nYou should now be able to click on the \u201cPlay\u201d icon above the first line of text, and doing so should flip your system from Dark mode to Light mode (and back again). Save your Quick Action (via Command + S) and give it a name you\u2019ll remember later (in one minute).\n\nQuit Automator and pull up System Preferences. Open Keyboard and click on the Shortcuts tab. Click on \u201cServices\u201d in the left column, and then scroll down the right column to find your new Quick Action\u2014likely under \u201cGeneral.\u201d Assign it a keyboard shortcut by clicking on \u201cnone,\u201d then \u201cAdd Shortcut,\u201d then whatever key or keys you want to use to trigger Dark Mode on and off.\n\nScreenshot: David Murphy\n\nIf this is your first time setting something like this up, you\u2019ll also likely be asked for some kind of permission. Makes sure you accept that or your hotkey setup won\u2019t work.", "description": "One of the best parts of macOS, introduced in Mojave, is the operating system\u2019s Dark Mode.
