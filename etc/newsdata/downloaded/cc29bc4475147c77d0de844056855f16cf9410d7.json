The State Department was out to get President Donald Trump after suffering years of \u201cfrustration.\u201d At least these denizens of the deep state are being honest.\n\nPolitico\u2019s 2,000-word story \u2013 titled \u201cThe Revenge of the State Department\u201d \u2013 begins by reporting on the fact that \u201ccurrent and former Foreign Service officers have defied Trump administration orders and trudged to Capitol Hill to testify before House committees investigating whether to impeach the president.\u201d\n\nThese officials, the story says, are \u201cfurious,\u201d \u201cterrified,\u201d \u201cincredulous,\u201d \u201cdisappointed,\u201d \u201cfed up,\u201d \u201clivid,\u201d with a \u201cdeep well of resentment,\u201d in an \u201cunbearable\u201d situation.\n\nSome of them, Politico reports, are using the hearings as a \u201cplatform to air long-held grievances over Trump.\u201d\n\nAnd their colleagues are \u201chailing them as heroes.\u201d\n\nWhat, exactly, are these career State Department bureaucrats angry about?\n\nThey\u2019re mad that several of them \u201cwere demoted or sidelined following attacks by the conservative media.\u201d\n\nThey complain about what they see as Trump\u2019s \u201cdangerous brand of diplomatic malpractice.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019re upset that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo didn\u2019t publicly support Marie Yavonovitch after Trump removed her from her post as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, and that Pompeo \u201cis willing to sell out the department to keep favor with Trump.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019re also enraged that Pompeo gave a speech to the American Association of Christian Counselors and talked openly about the importance of his faith. That, according to Politico, \u201ctroubled many diplomats.\u201d\n\nWilliam Burns, deputy secretary of State under President Barack Obama, declared in an article in Foreign Affairs said to have \u201cturned heads\u201d in Washington that Trump\u2019s treatment of State Department officials was akin to Sen. Joseph McCarthy\u2019s \u201csavage campaign against \u2018disloyalty\u2019 in the State Department.\u201d\n\nBurns conveniently overlooks the fact that there were communists in the State Department. And Pompeo remarked that he appeared to be auditioning to be Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s secretary of state.\n\nThe AP story is more of the same. Diplomats are fuming because of Trump\u2019s push to cut budgets and staff, and this is \u201ca moment of catharsis.\u201d\n\nSo what we have here are career bureaucrats who don\u2019t like the way Trump is conducting foreign policy. Why? Because they know better than some outsider who doesn\u2019t play according to the rules. There is no question that many of them would be delighted to see Trump removed from office, not because he did anything impeachable, but because they can\u2019t abide by the 2016 election results.\n\nTrump Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney had it exactly right when he said that \u201ccareer bureaucrats \u2026 are saying, \u2018You know what? I don\u2019t like President Trump\u2019s politics so I\u2019m going to participate in this witch hunt.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdd this to what we\u2019ve learned about how the intelligence community and the FBI have tried to undermine the Trump administration \u2013 events chillingly recounted in Andrew McCarthy\u2019s must-read book \u201cBall of Collusion.\u201d In it, he shows how the liberal Washington establishment \u201cexploited its control of law-enforcement and intelligence to help Clinton and undermine Trump. This is a scandalous abuse of power.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s critics say that his claims about a deep state are the result of his paranoid delusions. But after what the country has witnessed over the past three years, and now the bragging by State Department officials bent on getting Trump out of Washington, it\u2019s the denial of the deep state that is delusional.\n\n\u2014 Written by John Merline\n\nNote to Readers: Issues & Insights is a new site launched by the seasoned journalists behind the legendary IBD Editorials page.
