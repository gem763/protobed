Perhaps you and a buddy from work have been jamming in the break room and you want to record it, or maybe you just want to sit under a tree in the quad with headphones on and make beats during your free period. Whatever the reason, this guide should help you to build a portable music studio suitable for hobbyists and demo recordings.\n\nFirst a disclaimer: if you\u2019re going for a professional quality, full studio experience, move along \u2014 there\u2019s nothing to see here. This guide focuses on portability, ease-of-use, and gear that combines features you\u2019d normally want dedicated pieces of equipment for.\n\nYou might want a hobby studio for the same reason someone would buy a specialty travel guitar that folds in half for transport. Despite the fact that neither are up to the task of laying down professional tracks, they\u2019re perfect for honing your craft and general stress-relief.\n\nYou\u2019ll need a decent laptop with plenty of USB ports and a decent battery life (if you plan on using your studio in places without power outlets). You\u2019ll also need a carrying case \u2013 this guide is designed for people who want to toss all their gear in an adult-sized backpack. The rest all depends on what you\u2019re using the studio for.\n\nIf you\u2019ll be recording vocals or acoustic instruments you\u2019ll need at least one microphone. And if you intend on recording any other external instruments \u2013 keyboard, electric guitars, electronic drums, beat machines \u2013 you\u2019ll need an interface. For brevity, let\u2019s assume you want to be flexible enough to record vocals and instruments and build your own beats or electronic music.\n\nSoftware\n\nYou\u2019ll need a digital audio workstation (DAW). This is the software you\u2019ll use to arrange, edit, and mix your tracks. I suggest Audacity or Reaper. Audacity is open-source, which means it\u2019s completely free. Reaper\u2019s a bit more powerful and easier to use (plus it comes with a lot more plugins built-in), but it\u2019s only free-to-try for 60 days, afterwards it\u2019s only $60. Don\u2019t worry if you have no clue how to use a DAW, there\u2019s a million tutorials you can read online or watch on YouTube.\n\nIf you don\u2019t plan on making your own beats or electronica, you can get away with plugging your instruments and mics into an interface and recording directly into your DAW. From there you\u2019ll use plugins \u2013 digital effects and editing tools \u2013 to make your recordings sound the way you want them to.\n\nProduction gear\n\nFor those of us who want to make our own drum tracks, electronica, or other MIDI-powered music, things get a bit more complicated. You\u2019ll have to decide if you\u2019re going to be using a strictly-software solution, like programming beats in a DAW \u2013 these let you make beats using your mouse and keyboard or touch screen interface \u2013 or if you\u2019ll be using hardware.\n\nPersonally, I prefer having the option to do both so I use hardware. Any MIDI controller should work. You can buy keyboard controllers, pad controllers, and even specialty controllers. I use Native Instruments\u2019 Maschine Mikro because it\u2019s small enough to fit in my backpack with all my other gear and I really enjoy the Maschine 2 production interface.\n\nSensel\u2019s Morph is another fantastic option for producers who want it all, and want it portable. It\u2019s a tablet-sized touch interface that you can place specialized rubber overlays on.\n\nYou can use it like a touchpad for your computer, but it\u2019s also a MIDI controller that comes with overlays for drum pads, piano keys, and standard audio pads. These can be hot-swapped in and out and the Morph is resilient enough to handle the same kind of pounding that a full-on drum machine can. This means you can play your melodies on piano keys, tap out your bass lines on regular pads, and then break out a pair of actual drum sticks to lay down snares and hi-hats. None of this requires you to push buttons, change settings, or even click the mouse \u2013 of course, you\u2019ll have to change instruments in your DAW or production suite, but the Morph features seamless transition and recognition.\n\nMicrophone\n\nCredit: Nicole Gray\n\nHere\u2019s where you need to think outside of the box. You can\u2019t fit half a dozen mics in a backpack, and most decent cardioid condenser mics require a pre-amp, bulky cables, a microphone stand with specialty mount, a pop-filter, and a solid case to keep it from getting bumped around. You probably don\u2019t want to be slinging your $500 microphone around loose inside of your backpack.\n\nInstead of carrying a studio-quality mic around to record in places where you likely won\u2019t be able to control the ambient noise or guarantee proper acoustic resonance, you can use a \u201cjam station\u201d style recording solution like Izotope\u2019s Spire Studio or simply use less expensive handheld microphones like the Shure SM58. You probably won\u2019t capture the complete nuances of an R&B singer\u2019s mid frequencies with such a setup, but you can record your whole jam session with the Spire Studio, and even track it out before you send it to your DAW. And you can record individual vocal or acoustic guitar tracks with something like the Shure SM58 (vocals) or the Shure SM57 (acoustic instruments).\n\nInterface\n\nCredit: Native Instruments\n\nThis is the easy part. Your MIDI controller should plug directly into your laptop, but for electric guitars, keyboards, electronic drums, and most microphones you\u2019ll need and interface. While some interfaces are huge, rack-mounted pieces of gear, you can easily find an interface that supports between 2 and 4 inputs for relatively cheap and they typically don\u2019t take up much more space than a Bluetooth speaker would. I use a Roland Go:Mixer PRO because it\u2019s tiny, can run on battery power, and is super easy to use. I also recommend Native Instruments\u2019 Komplete Audio 1 and 2, but just about any interface will do \u2013 I\u2019ve got a 10-year-old M-Audio Fast Track that still functions perfectly for my needs.\n\nExtras\n\nWhat else you need is up to you. I keep guitar picks, drumsticks, extra USB cords, batteries, and a few memory sticks in my backpack. I also have a pop-filter because I do travel with a condenser mic and a cobbled-together mini-microphone stand that fits in my backpack. But if you\u2019ve got a computer to record to, the right instruments and mics for your project, and all the MIDI-controllers you need (if any), you should be good to go. Be sure to research and read reviews of any product you\u2019re unsure of. The rest comes with practice, experience, and reading/watching hundreds upon hundreds of hours of tutorials.\n\nThis post is not sponsored, but it includes affiliate links to products that you can buy online.
