Bobby said he was proud to see it, but he was lying.\n\nNot wanting to sound arrogant, but I hope I\u2019m dead before all my records are broken.\n\nWho do you think will win British Champions Day 2019?\n\nOisin Murphy will be the champion jockey this year.\n\nTwenty years ago, the British Champions Day race was a really big deal, but horse racing has become more global and international events have taken over.\n\nI\u2019ve been really impressed with Oisin\u2019s attitude and his respect for the race.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen did you first realise you wanted to be a jockey?\n\nThe first photo of me sat on a horse is from when I was just two years old.\n\nMy dad was a builder at the time and somehow ended up doing a job where he came away with a horse as payment. I have four sisters and one brother, none of whom have ever ridden horses \u2013 I\u2019m not saying I believe in fate, but I have no idea why I\u2019m the one in the family who ended up on our horse Miss Claire, as she was known.\n\nThe only time I feel like I am truly amazing is when I\u2019m on a horse (Picture: Leo Mason/Popperfoto via Getty Images)\n\nI have always loved horses. I used to sneak away from my mum when I was a child and she\u2019d find me standing among them in the stables. They\u2019re therapeutic animals and I get on better with them than I do with people, because they don\u2019t answer back.\n\nWhat qualifications do you need and how long does it take to get them?\n\nIt\u2019s a bit embarrassing for me to admit, but I don\u2019t have any specific qualifications, though I\u2019ve never failed an exam. The man I was riding for said that going to school would interfere with my real education \u2013 horse racing \u2013 and so I left school at 15.\n\nThe good thing about horse racing nowadays is that the sport doesn\u2019t discriminate against anyone \u2013 you can be any nationality, gender and age \u2013 and you don\u2019t even need to have any equine experience to get started.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in becoming a jockey you would either go to the National Horseracing College (NHC) or the British Racing School, where you can obtain a level one or level two Diploma in racehorse care and get the relevant training, and then become an apprentice jockey or conditional jockey.\n\nRegardless of your route to the job, you\u2019ll need to apply for a jockey license.\n\nWhat\u2019s the biggest sacrifice you\u2019ve made for your career?\n\nMy youngest sister was four years old when I left home at 15, so I didn\u2019t get to see her grow up.\n\nI\u2019ve also broken pretty much every bone in my body, and used to eat once a day to keep my weight down, as well as travel 75,000 miles a year in a car to get to various races across the UK.\n\nThere have been personal sacrifices, but I\u2019ve had the best life in the world.\n\nI came out of retirement to take part in the Pat Smullen Champions Race for Cancer Trials Ireland, riding against eight other champions \u2013 and I managed to beat them all (Picture: Seb Daly/Sportsfile via Getty Images)\n\nFavourite race you\u2019ve taken part in?\n\nMy favourite race ever is actually the one I did three weeks ago.\n\nI came out of retirement to take part in the Pat Smullen Champions Race for Cancer Trials Ireland, riding against eight other champions \u2013 and I managed to beat them all.\n\nI loved that race for two reasons; firstly, it was held by a friend of ours, whose family member got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and we raised over \u00a32.5million for the charity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn a more competitive note, I\u2019ve known the other jockeys for a long time, and there\u2019s a great sense of satisfaction in beating your mates, especially mates who are better than everyone else at what they do.\n\nThis was also the last race I\u2019ll ever do, so they can\u2019t get one back over me.\n\nWhy did the Grand National elude you when other races came so easily?\n\nThere are lots of jockeys who are better than me who have never won a Grand National, like John Francome and Peter Scudamore.\n\nSometimes the race just isn\u2019t meant to be.\n\nI won the Grand National on my 15th try in 2010, racing for JP McManus on a horse called Don\u2019t Push It.\n\nIt was extra special because of my close relationship with JP, I raced for him for 12 years and he treated me like a son.\n\nHow hard it is for jockeys to keep their weight down?\n\nI\u2019ve ridden in more than 18,000 races, a distance that is equivalent to around 2.5 trips around the Earth, so I\u2019ve always been physically fit. I also don\u2019t smoke or drink.\n\nTo keep the weight down, I used to eat once a day. It was hard but also so boring because this daily meal generally consisted of healthy foods like fish. When I retired, I spent a year eating a cooked breakfast every morning.\n\nI\u2019d do it even when I wasn\u2019t hungry, just because I could \u2013 eggs, bacon, mushrooms, the lot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIs it hard to make money as a jockey?\n\nMost jockeys get paid once a month by Weatherby\u2019s Racing Bank, a dedicated bank for those in the industry.\n\nBeing a jockey isn\u2019t as financially rewarding as football or golf, and many of the jockeys I competed against now have a more regular form of employment; for example, there are lads who rode at Cheltenham Festival who are now electricians.\n\nThe only time I feel like I am truly amazing is when I\u2019m on a horse. It\u2019s never been about the money.\n\nWhen my monthly statement came, I wouldn\u2019t even look at it \u2013 as long as I was winning, I knew I\u2019d be OK financially.\n\nAP took up golfing in the late 90s and got the chance to meet pro golfer Tiger Woods in 2010 (Picture: Patrick Bolger/Getty Images)\n\nAny fun anecdotes?\n\nThe greatest moment of my career \u2013 that didn\u2019t take part on a horse \u2013 was when I played golf with Tiger Woods in 2010.\n\nI started playing golf in 1997, which is around the time he won his first Masters \u2013 he\u2019s the reason I joined the sport.\n\nI\u2019ve also been lucky to spend some time in Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s company, on and off the track. She invited me for lunch at Windsor Castle once; I\u2019m a catholic from Northern Ireland \u2013 if this was 30 years ago, that might have been frowned upon.\n\nWe bonded over our love of horses, she is a huge horse racing fan.\n\nAt Ascot, she asked me what I thought of her horse and the jockey riding it and while I won\u2019t tell you what I said, I can tell you that she didn\u2019t need any guidance from me. She knows her stuff.\n\nDid the danger of the job ever outweigh the thrill?\n\nThe great thing about being a jockey is that you don\u2019t become too wrapped up in yourself.\n\nBecause of the dangers of the sport you have a lot of respect for your colleagues. I have seen fatal injuries and fellow jockeys fall, knowing that they\u2019ll never come back. I was also once so badly injured, I thought it was fatal \u2013 but now I\u2019m retired, I miss the danger.\n\nLike racing legend James Hunt said: \u2018The closer you are to death, the more alive you feel\u2019.\n\nAdvice to any aspiring jockeys?\n\nEveryone has opinions, but statistics don\u2019t lie.\n\nLook at who is the best, learn from them, analyse their moves and copy them \u2013 to a point \u2013 then find your own edge.\n\nBelieve in yourself, but have the work ethic to back it up.\n\nI\u2019d say there\u2019s a trick to winning, but all I could work out was about getting from A to B as quickly as possible.\n\nThat little fraction that makes the difference is instinctive, but the more you do it, the easier it becomes.\n\nSir AP McCoy will be co-presenting ITV Racing coverage of British Champions Day 2019.\n\nMORE: How to become a\u2026 sports psychologist\n\nMORE: How to become a\u2026 Peloton instructor\n\nMORE: How to become a\u2026football commentator", "description": "AP McCoy, as he's also known, is a 20-time British Champion jockey who has also won the Cheltenham Gold Cup and the 2010 Grand National.", "authors": ["Ap Mccoy"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/HOW-TO-BECOME-A_-JOCKEY-93d4_1571323920.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
