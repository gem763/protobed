USA TODAY\n\nIt's no secret that football is king in this country, especially on Sundays, even if Game 5 of a competitive World Series knotted at two games apiece is going head-to-head with the NFL.\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs-Green Bay Packers matchup on NBC's \"Sunday Night Football\" had a 61 percent viewership advantage over the Houston Astros-Washington Nationals contest on Fox, according to NBC Sports, the largest margin between a \"Sunday Night Football\" game and a World Series televised at the same time.\n\nAccording to Sports Media Watch, the football game drew 18.32 million viewers.\n\nThe Chiefs were playing without MVP Patrick Mahomes and instead had Matt Moore starting at quarterback, while Aaron Rodgers and the Packers outlasted the Chiefs 31-24 in a game that came down to the final possessions.\n\nMeanwhile, Nationals starter Max Scherzer was scratched in the hours before Game 5, depriving fans of a Scherzer-Gerrit Cole pitching duel. Instead, the Astros raced out to a 4-0 lead and kept the Nationals at bay.\n\nPackers-Chiefs drew 18.3 million viewers Sunday night on NBC. According to @NBCSportsPR, the 61 percent viewership advantage over Game 5 of the World Series on Fox was the largest such margin ever for Sunday Night Football over a World Series game. \u2014 MarkMaske (@MarkMaske) October 29, 2019\n\nMLB will not have to worry about the NFL stepping on its toes for the remainder of the series, as Game 6 will be played Tuesday and Game 7 on Wednesday, if necessary.\n\nLast year, Boston's five-game World Series victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers averaged 14.1 million viewers, down 25 percent from the previous year and the fourth-lowest ever.\n\nContributing: Associated Press", "description": "On Sunday, NBC's Sunday Night Football broadcast outdrew Game 5 of the World Series on Fox by 61 percent, according to NBC Sports.", "authors": ["Christopher Bumbaca", "Published P.M.
