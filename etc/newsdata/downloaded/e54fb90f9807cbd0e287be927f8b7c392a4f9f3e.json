First of all, you have to kind of interpreted to include that he was demanding a quid pro quo, that is to say, he was going to withhold the aid unless and until the investigation was conducted. In the end, the aid was not withheld an investigation he supposedly was insisting upon was not undertaken, so it does leave you wondering whether you\u2019re a Republican senator you\u2019re going to vote for conviction of a man on that basis.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cIt\u2019s so like this president to kind of lay about himself demanding this and demanding that, and saying people are treasonous, and saying they ought to be fired, and saying they ought to go to jail, and the rest of it, and a lot of it is just bluster. It\u2019s just bluster on his part. And he is inexperienced in foreign affairs, so he\u2019s on the phone with some leader, and he has this rambling kind of disconnected conversation in which he says you need to do me a favor and then he mentions some things, and later on, he says we need to investigate and see about the Bidens. Well, maybe he meant that as a quid pro quo, maybe he didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN", "description": "On Tuesday's broadcast of\u00a0Fox News Channel's \"Tucker Carlson Tonight,\"\u00a0senior political analyst Brit Hume argued President Donald Trump\u2019s Ukraine call could be dismissed by his inexperience in foreign affairs. | Clips", "authors": ["Pam Key"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/08/brit-hume-youtube-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
