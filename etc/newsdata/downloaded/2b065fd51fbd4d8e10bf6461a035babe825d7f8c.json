I really don\u2019t.\n\n\u201cI think Maddison has another level to go. I think there\u2019s a top team, if it\u2019s not Liverpool then United maybe, they\u2019ll be in for him. He can only get better.\"\n\nJames Maddison Leicester City\n\nOn a player who has enjoyed a meteoric rise to prominence since joining Leicester from Norwich in the summer of 2018, McMahon added: \u201cJurgen loves up and at them players, 100 per cent, non-stop work rate.\n\n\"He knows his full-backs can create a chance, the space and can go for an overlap.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see Maddison sitting on the bench [at a big club]. Say he comes to Liverpool, I\u2019m not telling James Maddison to leave, but if I\u2019m Klopp I would be looking to sign a player.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s young, he\u2019s English, he\u2019s got a lot going for him. He changes the tempo of the game, why wouldn\u2019t he get in Liverpool\u2019s midfield?\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cHenderson has been getting replaced for ever with Milner, Keita has not come on leaps and bounds, Fabinho is the holding midfield player.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a position there for him. If he came and he knuckled down, and he got his work ethic sorted, I see no reason why he wouldn\u2019t fit in.\u201d\n\nMaddison recorded seven goals and as many assists for Leicester in the Premier League last season and has already added another two of each during the 2019-20 campaign.", "description": "Former Reds midfielder Steve McMahon believes Jurgen Klopp should be targeting the Foxes star as he would slip seamlessly into the fold at Anfield", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/aa9wvE5zKg3nFeXOjdGDCA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/1o3MG1S.psZZvcMKq.FtTg--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/homerun/uk.goal.com/729eb7509bb39a0716e34db492362c78", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
