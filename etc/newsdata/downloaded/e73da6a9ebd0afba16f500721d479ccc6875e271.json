Just last week, federal agents executed a search warrant at Mann's lakefront New York home \"in connection to a federal investigation.\"\n\nAccording to the criminal complaint, Mann used fake companies to fraudulently obtain at least $70 million in loans from banks and other financial institutions. He launched his scheme sometime between 2010 or 2011.\n\nThe cloud-based payroll processing firm suddenly shut down operations earlier this month, vanishing with millions of payroll funds from customer businesses. MyPayrollHR processed payroll and tax payments for approximately 1,000 small-business clients located across the country.\n\nThe demise of the company sent shock waves through the U.S. leaving thousands of employees in the dark about paychecks they expected to receive and money that disappeared from their accounts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe company alerted its clients with a cryptic message saying it would be closing its doors and that companies relying on the firm to process payroll payments were instructed to find another means to provide such services.\n\nOn Sept. 5, operations ceased after Mann\u2019s bank accounts at Pioneer Bank and Bank of America were frozen. That impacted MyPayrollHR\u2019s clients since Mann diverted the client\u2019s payroll payments to accounts he controlled.\n\nMyPayrollHR processed payrolls through the Automated Clearing House network. Cachet Financial Services, based in California, routed payments from MyPayroll\u2019s clients to the clients\u2019 employees in accordance with instructions provided by MyPayrollHR. Cachet's general counsel Wendy Slavkin confirmed to FOX Business that around Sept. 5, MyPayrollHR failed to route employers\u2019 payroll payments to Cachet, which was responsible for replenishing the missing funds, setting Cachet back more than $20 million.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nMann appeared before United States Magistrate Judge Daniel J. Stewart Monday and was released on bond with pretrial supervision conditions. If convicted, Mann faces up to 30 years in prison, a maximum $1 million fine, and up to five years of post-release supervision.\n\nMeanwhile, the FBI bureau in Albany is continuing to seek information from people and businesses who may have been impacted.", "description": "He used fake companies to fraudulently obtain at least $70 million in loans from banks and other financial institutions.", "authors": ["Daniella Genovese"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/my-payrollhr-iStock.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
