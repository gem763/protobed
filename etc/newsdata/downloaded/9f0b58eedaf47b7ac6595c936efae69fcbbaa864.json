No other nation got more than two.\n\n\u201cIt is pretty clear to us that on athlete performance this is the best world championships we have had,\u201d said International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) chief Sebastian Coe.\n\nThe head of the global governing body had spent a good amount of time during the opening days vigorously defending the decision to bring the championships to the Middle East.\n\n\u201cIt is the athletes themselves who have come here better prepared for a championship that will be remembered for a long time.... maybe in a large part to the almost perfect conditions that these guys have created in the stadium.\u201d\n\nBefore the last three sessions, a nearby super mall with its shops, ice rink and amusement park had generated more buzz than the Khalifa Stadium with its swathes of empty seats.\n\nThe warning signs came early when the blue riband 100 metres on the opening weekend did not attract even a modest audience.\n\nAmerican Christian Coleman\u2019s win was greeted with a smattering of polite applause, while Jamaica\u2019s Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce did a victory lap in a near-empty stadium with her sleepy son nestled in her arms.\n\nHUGE INTEREST\n\nQatar has shown huge interest in hosting the world\u2019s biggest sporting parties, including the 2022 soccer World Cup finals, but has displayed little desire to actually attend them.\n\nThe futuristic air-conditioned Khalifa Stadium proved without doubt the country can build first-class facilities but hosting an event does not end when construction is completed.\n\nThe crowds over the final three days were as manufactured as the stadium, with organisers giving away thousands of tickets to clubs and immigrant workers although the excitement was real.\n\nWhile track and field athletes competing in Khalifa Stadium did so in air-conditioned comfort, there was plenty of suffering and complaining on the Doha roads.\n\nMarathoners and race walkers were forced to run at midnight along a soulless, almost spectatorless route to avoid the worst of the extreme heat and humidity, with temperatures hovering around 30 Celsius when the marathons and walks started.\n\nCoe had little sympathy for those athletes who were complaining, saying at the midway mark of the meeting that they would be the ones leaving without winning titles.\n\n\u201cThe athletes talking about externalities are probably not the ones who are going to be walking home with medals from here,\u201d he said.\n\nThe rousing end to the championships provided an upbeat note for a sport that continues to wrestle with complex issues, including a Russian doping scandal that looks set to linger, with the country\u2019s federation banned from the event.\n\nIf that was not enough, the championships were hit with another unwanted distraction when renowned American coach Alberto Salazar was banned for four years for doping violations, the news landing in the middle of the IAAF\u2019s biggest event.\n\nSalazar has denied any wrongdoing and said he would appeal.\n\nTrack and field\u2019s focus now turns to next year\u2019s Tokyo Olympics before the 2021 world championships in Eugene, Oregon, home of the Nike Oregon Project which has been caught up in the sport\u2019s latest doping scandal.\n\nThe U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) said Salazar was punished for \u201corchestrating and facilitating prohibited doping conduct\u201d as head coach of the Nike Oregon Project (NOP), a camp designed primarily to develop U.S. endurance athletes.\n\nSlideshow (6 Images)\n\nNike has denied any role in administering performance-enhancing drugs and said in a statement on Tuesday that it does not condone the use of banned substances.\n\n\u201cNike is not a part of the organising committee, it\u2019s just not, so the issue around Eugene is very clear,\u201d said Coe, already defending the choice of Eugene as the next host city.\n\n\u201cThere is the organising committee, and there\u2019s the (U.S.) federation who will be working closely together.\u201d", "description": "A successful world athletics championships had looked like a desert mirage but the event eventually came to life with an oasis of thrills and packed houses to rescue Qatari organisers and officials before the curtain came down on Sunday.", "authors": ["Steve Keating", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191006&t=2&i=1437864442&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF950RA", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
