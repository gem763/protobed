Building sets, casting and waiting for leading men to be free. It went to several festivals, but it was a big mistake to do something about the \u201cWhite Terror\u201d period in Taiwan. Looking back, no picture about that period has done well. I stopped. And tried to redefine myself, especially through writing, for which I\u2019ve always been criticized. After restoring my 1988 film \u201cLast Romance,\u201d I wrote an article about it for the Apple Daily newspaper. Overnight I became a weekly columnist, writing 4,000 words per time. There was so much to come out that I was likened to a pregnant woman. I also wrote two books and got another column in The One magazine.\n\nHow do you make a late career switch from live action to animation?\n\nI\u2019m not a regular viewer of animation, not even Pixar or Miyazaki. But I love painting and have been steeped in it since childhood. I can tell you straight away if a picture is real or fake. Indeed, people have sometimes joked that I don\u2019t need to get outside finance for my movies, suggesting that all I need to do is sell one piece of my collection instead. But a painting that moves, and can move the viewer, combined with music which I love, well that is art. I had no animation skills, but when I set out as a filmmaker, I did not know how to do that either.\n\nHow did the process go?\n\nI joked that this was God\u2019s punishment. I always admired Hitchcock and Miyazaki and said that I wanted to do storyboards like them. But animation required me to do a rough storyboard, then a moving storyboard, then to refine it. We spent a year doing the linear storyboard. But each animation artist interprets it differently in terms of looks and of movement. So I went to Beijing to see an animation master. He said he\u2019d make a 3D animation, first, get the movements of their bodies and eyes right first. Then we\u2019d make a 2D version by hand.\n\nThe film is set in 1967, a time of great political trouble in Hong Kong. What does the film have to say about Hong Kong\u2019s present-day political upheavals?\n\nAs far as I\u2019m concerned, Hong Kong has never changed. Of course, the buildings have. I love the place, and, despite all the many exoduses, in 1989 and 1997, I\u2019ve stayed. The purpose of my movie is so that that everyone living in Hong Kong can find a little bit of the happy Hong Kong somewhere within it.\n\nSign up for Variety\u2019s Newsletter.
