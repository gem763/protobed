That has included Steve Hansen\u2019s side keeping something up their sleeve, which Jones fully expects them to have tucked away this weekend.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

If you look back to 2011 World Cup, they scored that try through the middle of the lineout. All we can do is be creative in training, think about different situations and teach the players to handle it. One thing about playing New Zealand is that you have to be alive all the time, they are always in the game, always looking for opportunities \u2013 but our players are equipped for that and ready to go.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

I think if you have experienced that before you understand what you have got to prepare yourself for and most of our squad have been involved in those games so we've got great experience.\n\n\"They know what New Zealand's going to bring to the game and they have practised this week to be equipped for it. We are ready for the game, we've had two-and-a-half years to prepare for this game so we are ready to go.\n\n\"It's going to be a great contest, isn't it? Two heavyweights, one dressed in black, one dressed in white. You couldn't think of a better scenario.\"\n\nJones decided against making more changes to his side despite the All Blacks choosing a gameplan that will see them target the lineout, with lock Scott Barrett named at blindside flanker to give them more options than England\u2019s jumping trio of Maro Itoje, Courtney Lawes and Tom Curry. Jones could have brought lineout brain George Kruis back into the mix or moved Lawes to six to give his side alternative plans, but decided that the back-row pairing of Tom Curry and Sam Underhill has been too impressive to split up.\n\n\"We've got four great locks in the squad and it's a hard decision every game on who we are going to start with and who we are going to finish with,\u201d Jones said. \"We believe George Kruis will be exceptional for us finishing in the second half and Courtney will throw himself around a bit in the first half.\"\n\nIt means that Ford\u2019s return is the only change to the side that beat Australia last week with Slade dropped to the bench, though Jones believes it is the right move for this match.\n\n\"Every game we have a look at the conditions, the opposition, what we think we need to do, what we need to take away from the opposition and this is the best fit for us,\u201d he added.\n\n\"It\u2019s horses for courses. We just feel it's the right combination this week.\n\n\"Work-rate is going to be important. Whenever you play against New Zealand your work off the ball is going to be massively important. They like to move the ball around, they are very good on transition and George's work-rate off the ball has been absolutely exceptional.\u201d", "description": "Eddie Jones expects New Zealand\u00a0to spring a surprise on England\u00a0in this Saturday\u2019s Rugby World Cup semi-final, but believes his players\u2019 experience in facing the All Blacks over the last two years leaves them perfectly prepared to spring a surprise.", "authors": ["Jack De Menezes"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/24/12/eddie-jones.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
