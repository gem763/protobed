Barcelona after 350,000 rally in peaceful protest", "language": "en", "text": "Barcelona (AFP) \u2013 Thousands of separatists clashed with police in central Barcelona Saturday just hours after some 350,000 demonstrators held a peaceful march in the latest mass protest over the jailing of nine separatist leaders.\n\nThe day had started peacefully, with the city\u2019s streets turned into a sea of flags as a tide of humanity flowed down the wide avenue running from the waterfront to the city\u2019s towering Sagrada Familia basilica.\n\nOn an unseasonably warm October afternoon, the masses waved flags, sang songs and chanted slogans, among them many youngsters, elderly people and families with children.\n\nBut as night fell, thousands joined a separate demonstration by the radical CDR, massing outside police headquarters on Via Laeitana shouting \u201cOccupation forces, out!\u201d and hurling coloured plastic balls and marbles at the riot police guarding the building.\n\nAlthough police initially refused to engage, they eventually charged, using batons and foam rounds to try and break up the crowds who pelted them with bottles, rocks and fireworks, an AFP correspondent said.\n\nPolice said around 10,000 demonstrators had massed in the street, which was eventually cleared by about 11:00 pm.\n\nCatalonia has been gripped by unrest since the October 14 Supreme Court verdict which unleashed a wave of protest that quickly turned violent, with masked demonstrators clashing nightly with riot police.\n\nMore than 600 people have been injured in the protests, 367 of them civilians and 289 police, official figures show.\n\n\u2013 \u2018We won\u2019t forgive October 1\u2019 \u2013\n\nThe crisis began two years ago when the region staged a banned referendum on October 1 that was marred by police violence, then issued a short-lived declaration of independence, trigging Spain\u2019s worst political crisis in decades.\n\nSaturday\u2019s main rally was called by the ANC and Omnium Cultural, the region\u2019s two biggest grassroots pro-independence groups that have organised the largest separatist protests in recent years.\n\nMarching down the spacious boulevard, demonstrators chanted \u201cOctober 1, we won\u2019t forgive, we won\u2019t forget\u201d, breaking into loud boos and whistling as a police helicopter flew overhead.\n\n\u201cI feel really angry,\u201d said computer technician Marc, 26, who did not give his surname.\n\n\u201cThe violence doesn\u2019t sit well with me but it\u2019s normal to have a bit of upheaval like we\u2019ve seen in Chile and Ecuador,\u201d he said of a wave of mass protests in Latin America.\n\n\u201cThere are different ways of protesting but we have one objective: independence.\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u2018Not an option\u2019 \u2013\n\nCatalans remain sharply divided over the question of separating from Spain, with polls showing 44 percent in favour and 48.3 percent against.\n\nSpeaking to reporters at the rally, Catalonia\u2019s separatist president Quim Torra said his government was with the people \u201cbecause it is what they want.\n\n\u201cWe will go as far as they want\u201d.\n\nHe had earlier pledged to push ahead with the controversial independence drive after meeting 800 local mayors who expressed support for secession.\n\n\u201cThe show of unity we\u2019ve seen this week shows the next step that we all must follow\u2026 We must all push ahead and exercise the right to self-determination.\u201d\n\nTorra has made repeated appeals for dialogue with the Socialist government of Pedro Sanchez with the aim of securing Madrid\u2019s agreement for a referendum on independence, but they have fallen on deaf ears.\n\n\u201cWhat we will not talk about is the right to self-determination,\u201d Carmen Calvo, Sanchez\u2019s deputy, told journalists on Saturday.\n\n\u201cIf.. the aim is to break up Spain\u2019s territorial unity and separate Catalonia from Spain, we simply cannot talk,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cUnilaterally breaking the rules of the game is not an option.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Counter rally on Sunday \u2013\n\nOn Sunday, Catalans who want to remain part of Spain are planning a massive counter-demonstration to raise the voice of the region\u2019s so-called \u201csilent majority\u201d.\n\n\u201cThose who oppose independence are a majority,\u201d said Fernando Sanchez Costa, head of Catalan Civil Society (SCC), telling AFP the unrest was causing a lot of damage to Catalan society.\n\nEarlier, some 20,000 people gathered in Madrid in defence of Spain\u2019s unity, national police said, for a rally organised by the far-right Vox party, which has taken a very tough line on Catalan separatism and wants all regional pro-independence parties banned.\n\nAlthough the faction only entered parliament in April, polls indicate it might become the third-largest party following the November 10 election.", "description": "Barcelona (AFP) \u2013
