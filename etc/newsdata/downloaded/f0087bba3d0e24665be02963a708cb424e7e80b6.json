USA TODAY\n\nHOUSTON \u2013 Almost 20 minutes after Joe Altuve\u2019s home run ended the Yankees\u2019 year, their clubhouse was still somber and quiet.\n\nTeammates hugged, coaches consoled players and manager Aaron Boone went around the room, his eyes red, stopping at each locker and offering an individual word of praise and thanks.\n\nIn Game 6, just in the ninth inning alone, the Yankees were down and then even and then out, a whiplash of emotions at Minute Maid Park.\n\nThere wasn\u2019t another game to prepare for. This was goodbye to 2019.\n\n\u201cDuring the season, when you lose, you always have a chance to come back tomorrow and redeem yourself and get back headed in the right direction,\u2019\u2019 Brett Gardner said. \u201cAt this time of the year, only one team goes home happy.\u2019\u2019\n\nAnd this heartfelt scene on Saturday night, after the Astros\u2019 pennant-winning 6-4 victory, was \u201cjust seeing the end of a really special season.\u2019\u2019\n\nGleyber Torres #25 of the New York Yankees reacts against the Houston Astros during the eighth inning in game six of the American League Championship Series at Minute Maid Park on October 19, 2019 in Houston, Texas.

Nothing to hang your head about.\n\n\u201cThis time we didn\u2019t get the job done when it counted.\u2019\u2019\n\nMembers of the New York Yankees watch during the ninth inning in Game 6 of baseball's American League Championship Series against the Houston Astros Saturday, Oct. 19, 2019, in Houston.

Happ. \"We won a lot of games this year. And we expected to win (six) more than we did.''\n\nYet, this was the club that put a record-setting amount of players on the injured list and took its Next Man Up theme to ALCS Game 6.\n\n\u201cIn a lot of ways, it was a very successful year, a very positive year,\u2019\u2019 said D.J. LeMahieu, whose game-tying, two-run homer with one out in the ninth had briefly resuscitated hope of a Game 7. \u201cBut it\u2019s not the ending we wanted.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tough way to end a year,\u2019\u2019 said Zack Britton. \u201cYou don\u2019t know how often you\u2019re going to get a chance to do stuff like this as a team.\u2019\u2019\n\nAnd the team will change some next season; Sabathia walked out of the clubhouse and into retirement, while pending free agents in Gardner, Didi Gregorius, Dellin Betances and Cameron Maybin face uncertain futures.\n\nAroldis Chapman, who threw the final pitch, might opt out of his contract.\n\n\"But the work never ends,\u2019\u2019 said Boone. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to try and, I guess, close that gap.\n\n\u201cI know everyone in our room believes we will and we\u2019ll have a lot of battle scars when we do finally get to the top of that mountain.\u2019\u2019", "description": "After a whiplash of emotions in the ninth inning of ALCS Game 6 Saturday, the Yankees try to come to grips with their season's end.", "authors": ["Pete Caldera", "Published A.M.
