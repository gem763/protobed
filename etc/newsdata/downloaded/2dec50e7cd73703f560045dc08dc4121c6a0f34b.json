Because this is not politics, this is life, this is morality. \u2026 This is real.\u201d\n\nBrown was testifying against efforts by the Trump administration to rescind California\u2019s waiver that previously allowed it to set its own emissions standards for vehicles \u2014 effectively giving the state control of the entire auto industry. The administration argues that California\u2019s policy is actually worse for the environment because higher standards make new cars \u2014 which are more energy-efficient than old cars \u2014 more difficult for consumers to buy.\n\nThe ongoing California wildfires have a variety of causes. The immediate cause of the Getty Fire in Los Angeles, for example, appears to be a tree branch that was blown by high winds into power lines, according to the Los Angeles Times. Critics fault California and its utility companies for spending money on complying with \u201cgreen\u201d initiatives rather than on burying power lines. Others also cite homeless camps, where past fires have started, and poor forestry management policies that have barred the clearing of brush that can provide fuel for wildfires.\n\nBut Brown and other Democrats have identified climate change as the cuplrit, even though there is no scientific evidence to support that claim. In 2015 and in 2017, Brown also blamed climate change for wildfires in California, though scientists disagreed, calling Brown\u2019s arguments an example of \u201cnoble-cause corruption.\u201d\n\nCalifornia Democrats are facing new criticism at home, as utility companies have begun cutting power to electricity customers in peak fire conditions \u2014 a new practice for which the state government seems to have been unprepared.\n\nJoel B.
