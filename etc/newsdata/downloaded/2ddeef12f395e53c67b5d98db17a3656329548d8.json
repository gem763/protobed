Reaches Across Party Lines", "language": "en", "text": "Emotions are running high as Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton completes a review of the terrorist designation. The government of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki of Iraq has said it plans to close the camp, Camp Ashraf, by Dec. 31 and move the people elsewhere in Iraq in order to reassert Iraqi sovereignty over the land where it is located, 40 miles north of Baghdad.\n\nTwo earlier incursions by Iraqi troops into Camp Ashraf led to bloody confrontations, with 11 residents killed in July 2009 and at least 34 in April of this year. The M.E.K. and its American supporters say that they believe the Maliki government, with close ties to Iran, may soon carry out a mass slaughter on the pretext of regaining control of the camp.\n\nIf that happens, the supporters say, the United States \u2014 which disarmed the M.E.K. and guaranteed the security of the camp after the invasion of Iraq \u2014 will bear responsibility.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cWe made a promise,\u201d said Mr. Ridge, a former congressman and governor of Pennsylvania. \u201cOur credibility is on the line. They\u2019ve been attacked twice. How can we possibly accept assurances from the Maliki government?\u201d\n\nMr. Ridge suggested that the M.E.K.\u2019s implacable hostility to the rulers of Iran should be a point in their favor.\n\n\u201cIn my view, if you\u2019re a threat to Ahmadinejad,\u201d \u2014 Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Iran\u2019s president \u2014 \u201cwell, the enemy of my enemy is my friend,\u201d Mr. Ridge said. He noted that the M.E.K. had provided information on Iran\u2019s nuclear program during the Bush administration.\n\nThe M.E.K. advocacy campaign has included full-page newspaper advertisements identifying the group as \u201cIran\u2019s Main Opposition\u201d \u2014 an absurd distortion in the view of most Iran specialists; leaders of Iran\u2019s broad opposition, known as the Green Movement, have denounced the group. The M.E.K. has hired high-priced lobbyists like the Washington firm Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld. Its lawyers in Europe won a long fight to persuade the European Union to drop its own listing of the M.E.K. as a terrorist group in 2009.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe group\u2019s spending, certainly in the millions of dollars, has inevitably raised questions about funding sources.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Because \u201cmaterial support\u201d to a designated terrorist group is a crime, advocates insist that the money goes only to sympathizers and not to the M.E.K. itself.\n\nCongress has taken note of the campaign. A House resolution for dropping the terrorist listing has 97 co-sponsors, including the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Mike Rogers, Republican of Michigan. At a hearing this month, senators pressed the defense secretary, Leon E. Panetta, about the threat to Camp Ashraf.\n\nA State Department spokesman, Mark Toner, said officials there were \u201cworking as quickly as possible\u201d to complete a review of the M.E.K.\u2019s terrorist designation. American officials are supporting an effort by the United Nations to resettle Camp Ashraf residents voluntarily to other countries, a process that is making slow progress.\n\nPhoto\n\nOther State Department officials, addressing the issue on the condition of anonymity because it is still under deliberation, said that they did believe the 3,400 residents of Camp Ashraf were in danger as the Dec. 31 deadline approaches.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in constant talks with the Iraqis and the Ashraf leadership to show maximum flexibility on the closure of the camp,\u201d one official said.\n\nBut the officials expressed frustration at what they described as the American supporters\u2019 credulous acceptance of the M.E.K.\u2019s claims of representing the Iranian opposition and of embracing democratic values.\n\nIn years of observation, the official said, Americans have seen that the camp\u2019s leaders \u201cexert total control over the lives of Ashraf\u2019s residents, much like we would see in a totalitarian cult,\u201d requiring fawning devotion to the M.E.K.\u2019s leaders, Maryam Rajavi, who lives in France, and her husband, Massoud, whose whereabouts are unknown.\n\nMoreover, the official said, the group is \u201chated almost universally by the Iranian population,\u201d in part for siding with Mr. Hussein in the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s. A State Department cable this year concluded that any indication of United States support for the M.E.K. \u201cwould fuel anti-American sentiment\u201d in Iran and would \u201clikely empower Iranian hardliners.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn Iraq, the M.E.K. is also widely despised, especially by the country\u2019s Shiite majority, because it is accused of helping the Iraqi dictator crush a Shiite revolt in 1991 \u2014 a charge the group denies. Because of deep Iraqi hostility, American officials argue that merely dropping the terrorist designation would not end the danger of attacks on the group.\n\nWhile the M.E.K. carried out a campaign of attacks from the 1970s to the 1990s, mostly targeting Iranian officials, supporters say it has renounced violence and has not engaged in terrorist acts for a decade. The designation law, however, allows Mrs. Clinton to keep the label for a group that \u201cretains the capability and intent to engage in terrorist activity or terrorism.\u201d\n\nSuch a decision would outrage the American advocates of reversing the terrorist label.\n\nMr. Dean, chairman of the Democratic National Committee from 2005 to 2009, said the administration\u2019s failure to act decisively threatened a \u201chumanitarian catastrophe.\u201d Mr. Mukasey said he did not believe the claim that the M.E.K. was a cult, but even if true, it was no reason to keep the terrorist listing. \u201cThese people are sitting in the camp, completely harmless,\u201d he said.\n\nLike other advocates, Mr. Mukasey said he had been paid his standard speaking fee \u2014 $15,000 to $20,000, according to the Web site of his speakers\u2019 agency \u2014 to talk at M.E.K.-related events. But he insisted that the money was not a factor for him or other former officials who had taken up the cause. \u201cThere\u2019s no way I would compromise my standing by expressing views I don\u2019t believe in,\u201d he said.", "description": "A dozen former top national security officials are among those seeking to reverse the terrorist designation of a group living in Iraq that State Department officials call a repressive cult.", "authors": ["Scott Shane"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/11/27/world/27mek2/27mek2-thumbStandard.jpg", "published_at": "2011-11-27"}
