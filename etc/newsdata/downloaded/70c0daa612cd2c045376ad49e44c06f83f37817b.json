Zip, bupkis, nada, nothing really happens,\u201d he summarized.\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported last month, Google had announced it has used a quantum computer to perform a task, which a regular machine would take tens of thousands of years to complete.\n\nDescribed as \u201cquantum supremacy,\u201d the event sparked immediate concerns about public blockchains.\n\nMisunderstandings spark crypto concerns\n\nAntonopoulos, however, said these were unfounded.\n\n\u201cQuantum supremacy, what Google described, is demonstrating the practical applicability of quantum computers to certain classes of problems,\u201d he explained.\n\nAntonopoulos continued:\n\n\u201cThose classes of problems are not the same classes of problems we\u2019re talking about when we talk about breaking cryptography.\u201d\n\nThe idea of quantum threatening Bitcoin had previously surfaced several years ago, Antonopoulos likewise dispelling the idea due to the technology\u2019s overall lack of sophistication.\n\nNonetheless, becoming quantum-resistant, at least in terms of signature algorithms, is on Bitcoin\u2019s roadmap as a necessary step, he added.", "description": "The recent breakthrough announced by the tech giant does not pose problems for public blockchain cryptography, says the educator", "authors": ["William Suberg"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvODFlOGY3NjdlYjYzN2RjY2ViODA3ZTM3MTNjYzAxYjcuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
