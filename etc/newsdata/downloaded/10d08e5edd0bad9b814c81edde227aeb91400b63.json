First, I would never skimp on her exercise. Second, I would never feed her from the table or allow groveling in its vicinity. Third, I would never get lazy and use her as column fodder.\n\nTwo out of three ain\u2019t bad.\n\nShe\u2019s 5\u00bd years old, about 48 pounds and mostly black, but with blazes of white in all the right places: her paws, her chest, the tip of her tail. \u201cBorder collie?\u201d ask people who know the breed, but a DNA test said different. She\u2019s mostly Australian shepherd and Siberian husky.\n\nAnd she\u2019s not just smart. She\u2019s telepathic. From the slightest twitch of my thoughts, she can tell that I\u2019m mulling the mortal sin of leaving our Manhattan apartment without her, in which event she wedges herself against the front door to form a blockade of fur and flesh. I\u2019m totally convinced that she could beat Donald Trump in a general election, but she\u2019d never get through the Democratic primary. Her Upward Hound proposal for puppy pre-K is an incremental, modestly funded shadow of Bernie Sanders\u2019s version.\n\nBut this column isn\u2019t really about Regan, so go easy on me. She\u2019s my pivot into a lament about the degradation of our country\u2019s civic culture and a suggestion of how to push back at that process. You expected a simple, sentimental ode to the joys of a four-legged companion? Sorry.
