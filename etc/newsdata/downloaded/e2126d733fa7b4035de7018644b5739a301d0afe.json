(AP) - Matt LaFleur said it is time to hit the reset button.\n\nLaFleur got his first taste of defeat as Green Bay\u2019s coach Thursday night with the Packers\u2019 34-27 home loss to the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\n\u201cI think you can find a lot out of a lot of people in times of adversity,\u201d said the 39-year-old first-year coach. \u201cThis is our first real test of adversity, but I think we have the right character. I think we\u2019ve got the right leadership in that locker room that our guys will stick together.\u201d\n\nAfter allowing 35 points through the first three games, the Packers (3-1) surrendered that much in 60 minutes Thursday. It was Green Bay\u2019s first home loss in September with Aaron Rodgers as its starting quarterback (14-1-1). It also was Rodgers\u2018 first career defeat when leading by 10 or more points at any point at home (58-0-1).\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot to build on, and the frustrating thing is a home game, a winnable game, a good opponent, that we just didn\u2019t execute the way we should\u2019ve to win that football game,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201c\u2026 I think we\u2019re a good football team. To be a great football team, you have to win these kind of games when you\u2019re playing really good opponents.\u201d\n\nWHAT\u2019S WORKING\n\nDespite the loss, Rodgers and the Packers\u2019 offense put up a season-high 491 yards of total offense and tied a season high with 27 points.\n\nAfter a monster season last year, wide receiver Davante Adams had his breakout game of the young 2019 campaign. The two-time Pro Bowler had a career-high 180 yards on 10 catches just six days after he and his wife, Devanne, welcomed their new baby girl, Deija Leigh, into the world.\n\nGreen Bay also got a big night from Jimmy Graham. The 10-year veteran was shut out the past two weeks but rebounded with his second touchdown of the season and season highs in catches (six) and yards (61).\n\nWHAT\u2019S NOT WORKING\n\nFor the third straight week, the Packers\u2019 run defense was flat-out bad. Philadelphia rushed 33 times for 176 yards (5.3 yards per carry) and two scores. It was the third week in a row an opponent had run for 149 yards or more.\n\n\u201cJust from an execution standpoint, we\u2019ve got to get better at staying in our gaps, having better discipline on the backside of runs and just overall performing better,\u201d defensive tackle Dean Lowry said.\n\nSTOCK UP\n\nGeronimo Allison. With Adams\u2019 immediate availability hanging in the balance due to a toe injury, Allison could see his targets increase. Allison had three catches for 52 yards and a touchdown on Thursday. The fourth-year receiver had only managed five receptions for 24 yards and a score through the first three games. Allison didn\u2019t see a single pass come his way in the season opener.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very, very excited for him and the progress that\u2019s he\u2019s showing and the leadership that he\u2019s showing for our room, because we do have some young players,\u201d wide receivers coach Alvis Whitted said of Allison.\n\nSTOCK DOWN\n\nAaron Jones. The third-year UTEP product scored a touchdown in his sixth straight home game on Thursday. That\u2019s the longest streak in franchise history. But after Jones\u2019 score, he had an overall quiet night with just 13 rushes for 21 yards, and that was with fellow running back Jamaal Williams being evaluated for a concussion. Jones now has just 38 yards on his last 23 carries.\n\nINJURED\n\nLaFleur said Friday that Williams, who was carted off the field Thursday following the first play from scrimmage, was well enough to return home after spending the night in the hospital. Jones said he visited Williams during his stay and Williams was \u201cmaking jokes.\u201d Adams, who suspected he has turf toe following Thursday\u2019s loss, underwent an MRI on Friday. LaFleur said he will have \u201ca better indication of where we stand once we get through the weekend.\u201d\n\nKEY NUMBER\n\n9 - Rodgers now ranks ninth in NFL history with 344 career touchdown passes. Eli Manning is eighth with 362.\n\nNEXT STEPS\n\nAfter playing three games in 11 days, the Packers now have about a week and a half to heal, rest and prepare for a road matchup against the Cowboys on Oct. 6.\n\n___\n\nFollow Keith Jenkins on Twitter: https://twitter.com/MrKeithJenkins\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Matt LaFleur said it is time to hit the reset button.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Keith Jenkins"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/27/eagles_packers_football_93404_c0-261-6245-3902_s1770x1032.jpg?09dcde9f63e0922bfe84c382e3f2ca9e9a3b2824", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
