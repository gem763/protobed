Rodarte designers Kate and Laura Mulleavy clearly feel the same way, and have gifted us with the glory of a Betty and Sally portrait as part of the brand\u2019s spring 2020 campaign, which was revealed Wednesday. January Jones, who played Betty, hasn\u2019t aged a day, with her blonde hair still coiffed in an elegant bob. Kiernan Shipka, meanwhile [takes a long drag of a cigarette], has grown into a stunning, sophisticated 19-year-old, who\u2019s still got that skeptical eyebrow-raise. Wearing strapless floral gowns and pearl-laced sheer gloves, Jones and Shipka look like the all-knowing suburban debutantes we remember and love. We are so profoundly sad happy.\n\nBased in Los Angeles, the Rodarte sisters have developed an ever-growing circle of Hollywood friends that extends far beyond the cast of Mad Men. Also photographed for the campaign are musicians like King Princess, Phoebe Bridgers, Haim, and Kilo Kish, as well as actors like Margaret Qualley, Yalitza Aparicio, and, of course, their longtime BFF Kirsten Dunst. The resulting images combine ruffles, tulle, and soft pastels with intense stares. Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce would approve.\n\nSee a selection of our favorites, below.", "description": "Rodarte designers Kate and Laura Mulleavy reunited Betty and Sally Draper for the brand\u2019s spring 2020 campaign, plus Margaret Qualley and Kirsten Dunst.", "authors": ["Emilia Petrarca"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/09/04/rodarte/297286_D5_6I_010_R1.w1200.h630.jpg"}
