The company said its customer base is \"migrating away from natural fur\" and Macy's is following the trend.\n\nMacy's and Bloomingdale's will stop selling the animal product by the end of the 2020 fiscal year, including its \"off-price\" stores\" \u2014 Macy's Backstage and Bloomingdale's The Outlet. The decision also includes all Macy's and Bloomingdale's private brands, including products sold from its brand partners.\n\nThe company will shutter its Fur Vaults and salons \u2014 which offered storage, repairs and restyling of furs, among other services.\n\nThe new fur-free policy does have exceptions, however. Ethically sourced sheep fur \u2014 known as shearling or sheepskin \u2014 as well as cattle fur \u2014 referred to as calf hair and cowhide \u2014 are permitted. The exceptions are in alignment with the Fur Free Alliance's guidelines, which permit the \"use of fur that is a by-product of domestic farming to feed our society,\" according Macy's website.\n\n\"Over the past two years, we have been closely following consumer and brand trends, listening to our customers and researching alternatives to fur,\" said Jeff Gennette, chairman and chief executive officer of Macy's, Inc. \"Macy's private brands are already fur free so expanding this practice across all Macy's, Inc. is the natural next step.\"\n\nGennette added that the company has partnered with the Humane Society of the United States in its \"commitment to ending the sale of fur.\" Macy's and Bloomingdale's will continue to sell faux fur clothing and accessories.\n\nBREAKING NEWS: @Macys and @Bloomingdales are going fur-free! In partnership with the HSUS, the retailers will also be closing all fur vaults and salons.

The law won't take effect until January 2023. Hawaii and New York have introduced similar legislation, and may soon follow Newsom's lead.\n\nBrands including Versace, Gucci, Michael Kors and Burberry have also adopted or plan to adopt fur-free policies of their own in recent years, signifying an industry shift away from the material.", "description": "The company said their customer base is \"migrating away from natural fur\" and Macy's is following the trend", "authors": ["Danielle Garrand"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2016/03/15/e80c5b11-df0b-4b1f-affc-d0c150016fa5/thumbnail/1200x630/b176443bbea93166d440ff0f3f4e7f22/istock000036431880medium.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
