What\u2019s it going to be like to show up tomorrow with a chance to go to the World Series?\n\n\u201cThat\u2019d be huge,\u201d reliever Sean Doolittle said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to think about.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cJust go out there and try to battle,\u201d catcher Kurt Suzuki said. \u201cWin every pitch.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou just got to execute,\u201d right fielder Adam Eaton said. \u201cIf you\u2019re thinking nine-plus innings tomorrow, your head\u2019s going to explode.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe Nationals won Game 3, 8-1, and they\u2019ve only allowed two runs all series, both of which came on miscues by their own outfielders. They need to win one last battle \u2014 left-hander Patrick Corbin against right-hander Dakota Hudson \u2014 to secure the franchise\u2019s first trip to baseball\u2019s Fall Classic.\n\nCorbin\u2019s key, as always, will be his devastating slider. He throws it nearly 38 percent of the time, and it looks like a fastball until the last second, when it dives off the table.\n\nAD\n\nThe key for the Nationals lineup against Hudson will be patience. The 25-year-old is erratic around the strike zone and issued an MLB-leading 86 walks this season. If the Nationals wait him out, and boost his pitch count, it might be an early night for Hudson \u2014 and an early exit for his team.\n\nLineups\n\nCardinals\n\nTommy Edman 3B\n\nAD\n\nJos\u00e9 Mart\u00ednez RF\n\nPaul Goldschmidt 1B\n\nMarcell Ozuna LF\n\nYadier Molina C\n\nPaul DeJong SS\n\nHarrison Bader CF\n\nKolten Wong 2B\n\nDakota Hudson P\n\nNationals\n\nTrea Turner SS\n\nAdam Eaton RF\n\nAnthony Rendon 3B\n\nJuan Soto LF\n\nHowie Kendrick 2B\n\nRyan Zimmerman 1B\n\nVictor Robles CF\n\nYan Gomes C\n\nPatrick Corbin P\n\nPregame reading\n\nNationals demolish Cardinals, 8-1, in NLCS Game 3, move within one win of World Series.
