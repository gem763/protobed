Singh called him \"a star candidate\" for the riding of Acadie-Bathurst.\n\nBut Singh faced questions from reporters about why he hadn't visited the province earlier in his first two years as NDP leader.\n\n\"We're absolutely taking New Brunswick seriously,\" Singh said, adding it was a mistake not to visit sooner. \"I'm really sorry. I'm sorry I didn't get here earlier. I'm happy to be here.\"\n\nAsked for an explanation, he said his mother taught him to not make excuses when apologizing.\n\nSingh's lack of earlier visits was criticized by Green Party Leader Elizabeth May, who made her own appearance later in the day in Fredericton. The two parties are competing for left-of-centre votes in the Oct. 21 election.\n\nMay pointed out that it was her third trip to the province this year.\n\n\"Anyone that thinks that they have what it takes to serve their country as prime minister needs to know the country, needs to have gone to all parts of the country to listen,\" she said.\n\nFacing local criticism\n\nLast month, New Democrat Yvon Godin, the former Acadie-Bathurst MP, said he was \"not proud\" of Singh's absence from the province and said it was hurting the party's prospects.\n\nBut Godin, who represented the riding for 18 years, was at Singh's side on Monday and said it was \"a great pleasure\" to introduce him.\n\nDuring the summer, Godin criticized Singh for not coming to the province during his first two years as federal NDP leader. (Radio-Canada)\n\nSingh urged a small crowd of NDP supporters to rally behind Th\u00e9riault.\n\n\"Here in New Brunswick, with our complete team of candidates, with our star candidate Daniel Th\u00e9riault, we are confident that we can move forward, but we need your help.\"\n\nHe said the NDP is the only party committed to policies on health care and employment insurance that respond to people's needs.\n\nProvincial party problems\n\nSingh's visit comes during a tumultuous year for the NDP in New Brunswick. Last week, Radio-Canada reported that the party's Moncton-Riverview-Dieppe candidate, Luke MacLaren, had to apologize for old social-media posts that were offensive.\n\nThe provincial party has also been in the doldrums, winning a only five percent of the vote in last year's election and failing for the fourth campaign in a row to elect a single MLA.\n\nThe party also lacks a permanent leader. The only candidate who came forward for the position earlier this year, Joyce Richardson, was disqualified.\n\nShe later organized an exodus of former provincial NDP candidates to the Green Party, and her son Jonathan, another defector, suggested voters in northern New Brunswick were reluctant to support Singh because of his Sikh heritage.\n\nThe only bright spot for the NDP was that the exodus was revealed to be smaller than advertised after several apparent defectors said they were not switching to the Greens after all.\n\nThe provincial NDP has been without a full-time leader since Jennifer McKenzie resigned after the party's dismal performance in the 2018 provincial election. (CBC)\n\nSingh said Monday he didn't believe Jonathan Richardson's comments about his background being a liability.\n\n\"People in Bathurst are welcoming and open-hearted and beautiful people who just want someone who understands them,\" he said. \"They're people who just want a fair deal.\"\n\nSingh also pushed back at the Green Party's apparent momentum in New Brunswick. The party captured 11.8 percent of the vote provincially last year, more than double that of the NDP, and elected three MLAs.\n\nSingh said the NDP has \"a really solid position\" on abortion rights and national unity, \"something I can't really say for the Green Party.\"\n\nHe was referring to one Green Party candidate who is anti-abortion and another who declared himself a Quebec sovereigntist.\n\nMay said in Fredericton that the Greens' position is \"the same solid position\" as the NDP's on both issues.\n\n\"What I find disturbing is that the NDP keeps saying there's something funny about our position, because it's the same as their position. I'm all for recycling \u2026 but the NDP has to stop recycling the same lies every day.\"\n\nSingh said the delay in getting NDP candidates nominated was because of his commitment to \"do things a little differently,\" including recruiting more women. But eight of the party's 10 candidates in New Brunswick are men.\n\nTh\u00e9riault said his announcement had been put off so it would have a more dramatic effect.\n\n\"It was part of our strategy to delay the announcement. We wanted to have a good impact.\"\n\nTh\u00e9riault is a former director of the Festival acadien de Caraquet and other arts organizations and was also head of the Acadian Cultural Federation of Nova Scotia. He is the brother of former Caraquet Liberal MLA Bernard Th\u00e9riault.", "description": "NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh made his first visit to New Brunswick on Monday and apologized for not getting there sooner.", "authors": ["Provincial Affairs Reporter", "Jacques Poitras Has Been Cbc'S Provincial Affairs Reporter In New Brunswick Since Raised In Moncton", "He Also Produces The Cbc Political Podcast Spin Reduxit."], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5294261.1569263709!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/ndp.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
