Add Ukraine as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Ukraine news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nHere are five key things to know about Giuliani\u2019s involvement in the Ukraine affair:\n\nGiuliani engaged a foreign power as Trump\u2019s personal lawyer\n\nGiuliani doesn\u2019t work on behalf of U.S. taxpayers as a diplomat or other government employee; he\u2019s the president\u2019s personal lawyer.\n\nAl Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nThat\u2019s why it was so astonishing last May when Giuliani told The New York Times that he planned to travel to Ukraine to press the government on matters that some Trump\u2019s allies thought would help Trump\u2019s re-election bid.\n\nThe goal, he said, was to find information that would be \u201cvery, very helpful to my client, and may turn out to be helpful to my government.\u201d\n\nGiuliani said he specifically wanted Ukraine\u2019s new government to find evidence that corrupt politicians there had interfered in the 2016 election on behalf of Democrat Hillary Clinton. (U.S. intelligence has determined that Russia, not Ukraine, interfered in the U.S. election -- to benefit Trump, not Clinton.)\n\nGiuliani also wanted the foreign power to look into potential conflicts of interest involving Democrat presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden, and his son Hunter Biden, who served on the board a Ukraine gas company at the time. Both Biden and his son, Hunter, have denied any wrongdoing.\n\nGiuliani told The New York Times in May that he wasn\u2019t meddling in the upcoming election. \u201cWe\u2019re meddling in an investigation, which we have a right to do,\u201d he said.\n\nGiuliani says he was acting on behalf of the president\n\nInternal texts and documents suggest Giuliani was so deeply entangled in U.S. discussions with Ukraine, that senior State Department officials sought him out repeatedly to keep him updated.\n\n\u201cThe key to changing the President's mind on Ukraine was Giuliani,\u201d said Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, in testimony to Congress.\n\nAnd in his July phone call to Ukraine\u2019s president, Trump made clear it was Giuliani who was acting on his behalf and not the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, whom Trump called \u201cbad news.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was the mayor of New York City, a great mayor, and I would like him to call you. I will ask him to call you along with the Attorney General,\u201d Trump said of Giuliani to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.\n\n\u201cRudy very much knows what\u2019s happening and he is a very capable guy,\u201d Trump added, according to a rough White House transcript of the call. \u201cIf you could speak to him that would be great.\u201d\n\nGiuliani earned $500K from a man accused of funneling foreign money into US campaigns.\n\nTwo associates of Giuliani \u2013 both Soviet-born, Florida-based businessmen \u2013 were arrested last week at a Washington-area airport with one-way tickets.\n\nHandout/Alexandria Virginia Sheriffs Office/Getty Images\n\nThe men are accused of breaking campaign finance laws by funneling money from an unnamed foreign national \u2013 identified in the indictment only as a \u201cRussian citizen and businessman\u201d \u2013 into political contributions to specific U.S. political campaigns. Both men have pleaded not guilty.\n\nWhen asked whether he knew the men, Trump said he wasn\u2019t sure. \u201cYou have to ask Rudy,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nHandout/Alexandria Virginia Sheriffs Office/Getty Images\n\nThe business relationship between Giuliani and the two men is now the subject of an ongoing investigation conducted by federal authorities in New York, ABC News reported last Friday. And raising questions in particular is a $500,000 payment that Giuliani acknowledges that he received for work he did with a company co-founded by one of the men.\n\nGiuliani\u2019s influence remains outsize on other matters, too\n\nAccording to a source with direct knowledge of the matter, Trump in 2017 urged then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to push the Department of Justice to drop a criminal case against one of Giuliani's clients -- an Iranian-Turkish gold trader accused of helping the Iranian government evade U.S. economic sanctions. Giuliani did not respond to a request to comment when reached by ABC News.\n\nSeparately, a former senior administration official tells ABC News that Giuliani urged Trump to extradite a Turkish cleric living in exile in the U.S.\n\nThe former senior official tells ABC that White House officials stepped in and blocked any actions, telling Giuliani that the Turkish government should go through proper channels for extradition requests. Giuliani declined to comment, citing attorney-client privilege.\n\nGiuliani\u2019s business relationships are under investigation\n\nWith Giuliani\u2019s business relationships with Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman under investigation, the question is what happens next and how his dealings will impact the administration.\n\nAccording to the Times, former national security adviser John Bolton told another White House staffer that Giuliani was a \u201chand grenade who\u2019s going to blow everybody up.\u201d\n\nGiuliani has denied any wrongdoing and insisted that others at the White House didn\u2019t have the \u201cevidence\u201d he did of \u201cUkrainian collusion.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time a personal lawyer to Trump was scrutinized by law enforcement. Michael Cohen is now serving a three-year prison sentence after pleading guilty to tax, bank and campaign finance crimes.\n\nUnlike Cohen, Giuliani says he is not complying with a congressional subpoena.\n\nGiuliani tells ABC News \u201cif they enforce it, then we will see what happens.\u201d\n\nABC News' John Santucci contributed to this report.", "description": "Rudy Giuliani has emerged as a key player in the Ukraine affair.
