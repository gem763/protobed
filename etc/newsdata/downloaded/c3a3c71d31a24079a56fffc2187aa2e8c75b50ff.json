Adapted from Fernando Morais\u2019s book, The Last Soldiers of the Cold War, it is a gripping true story set at a time when the Berlin Wall had fallen and many assumed that Fidel Castro\u2019s Communist regime in Cuba would fall shortly afterwards. The fact that so much of it is shot on location in bustling, crumbling Havana is just one reason why it all seems so authentic.\n\nMore like this\n\n- How good is Joker?\n\n- Films to watch this September\n\n- The Wizard of Oz\u2019s subversive messages\n\nIt begins, in 1990, with a burly pilot, Ren\u00e9 Gonz\u00e1lez (Edgar Ramirez), kissing his loving wife Olga (Pen\u00e9lope Cruz) and daughter goodbye one morning in their Havana flat. He\u2019s got to take a couple of parachutists up for a sky dive, but he\u2019ll be home in time for dinner \u2013 or so he says. In fact, in the first of the film\u2019s countless twists, he nips into the control tower, disables the radios, and flies his small plane across the ocean to Miami. Leaving his family behind was painful, he tells the US press, but he couldn\u2019t bear the privation in Cuba any longer. Indeed, he soon hooks up with an anti-Castro organisation devoted to helping fellow defectors, and uses his piloting expertise to rescue refugees who are struggling through the waves on rafts.\n\nAfter the film\u2019s overstuffed first hour, everything clicks into place with a sudden split screen and a caption that rewinds the narrative to \u201cfour years earlier\u201d\n\nAnother defecting pilot (Wagner Moura from Narcos) is a smoothie who charms and marries a Miami social climber (Ana de Armas from Blade Runner 2049). He too agrees to fly for the anti-Castro faction, but while Ren\u00e9 is in it for the good of his fellow \u201cfree Cubans\u201d, his new comrade is more interested in the money to be made, and the designer clothes and jewellery he can buy with it. That\u2019s why a little drug-running and FBI-informing on the side are so tempting.\n\nIt isn\u2019t easy to keep track of the men\u2019s succession of jobs and contacts in the film\u2019s overstuffed and episodic first hour, but then everything clicks into place with a sudden split screen, a voiceover, a thrum of surf guitar, and a caption that rewinds the narrative to \u201cfour years earlier\u201d. This is the Scorsese-ish introduction of the Wasp Network itself, a spy ring run by Gael Garcia Bernal\u2019s greying, goatee-bearded Cuban secret service officer. The network consists of a handful of pro-Castro agents who have been sent to Miami to observe and report on the city\u2019s anti-Castro agents. And that means \u2013 without giving too much away \u2013 that most of the characters who have been in the film thus far have been pretending to be something they\u2019re not. The rug is well and truly yanked from under your feet, and you never regain your balance.\n\nAssayas\u2019s complex, balanced film forces the viewer to keep reassessing who is on whose side \u2013 and whether you should be on their side, too\n\nIf the rest of Wasp Network is still tricky to follow, that is the point. Assayas immerses us in a world where several different groups all believe that they are the heroes, and where identities and allegiances don\u2019t stay the same for long. It is a world where Bill Clinton and Fidel Castro appear on television, and each of them sounds, in the moment, as if he has the moral high ground. There are cleverly choreographed spy-movie set pieces: a recreation of the 1997 Cuba hotel bombings is unbearably tense. But unlike a typical spy movie, Assayas\u2019s complex, balanced film forces the viewer to keep reassessing who is on whose side, and whether you should be on their side, too.\n\nThen there is the question of the women and children. While Ren\u00e9 is on daredevil missions in Florida, Olga is raising her daughter alone, toiling in a tannery, and being ostracised in Havana for being a traitor\u2019s wife. Life gets even more challenging for her in the years that follow \u2013 and Cruz conveys Olga\u2019s strength and her suffering with equal intensity. Very few spy films give so much time to the spies\u2019 families, let alone their childcare arrangements. Very few make us think so hard about the sacrifices being made, the ethical issues being faced, and whether the job\u2019s triumphant highs are worth the tawdry lows. Despite all that, Wasp Network is still an entertaining and often glamorous cloak-and-dagger thriller in which the sun is always shining and the actors are all gorgeous. But it offers a rare insight into what it might actually be like to be an undercover agent, and that\u2019s not so entertaining or glamorous at all.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\n\nLove film?
