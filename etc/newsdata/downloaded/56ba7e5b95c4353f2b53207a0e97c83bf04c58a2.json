Much of the GDP losses will come from a decline of business confidence, productivity losses from broken supply chains and negative market reactions, she said.\n\n\u201cIn 2019, we expect slower growth in nearly 90 percent of the world. The global economy is now in a synchronized slowdown. This means that growth this year will fall to its lowest rate since the beginning of the decade,\u201d Georgieva said.\n\nThe situation is a stark contrast from two years ago, before the U.S.-China trade war got started, when countries representing nearly 75% of the world\u2019s output were seeing accelerating growth, she said.\n\nThe Bulgarian economist, a former European Union official who previously held the No. 2 job at the World Bank Group, said trade growth had \u201ccome to a near standstill.\u201d\n\nFILE PHOTO: International Monetary Fund (IMF) Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva speaks to reporters as she arrives for her first day in her new post at IMF headquarters in Washington, U.S. October 1, 2019. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst/File Photo\n\nShe warned that fractures in trade could lead to changes that last a generation, including \u201cbroken supply chains, siloed trade sectors, a \u2018digital Berlin Wall\u2019 that forces countries to choose between technology systems.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe precarious outlook will affect many countries caught in the crossfire of trade conflicts, including struggling emerging markets with IMF programs, she added.\n\nIn calling for countries to work together to revise global trade rules to make them sustainable, she referenced frequent complaints about China\u2019s trade practices, without specifically naming the country.\n\n\u201cThat means dealing with subsidies, as well as intellectual property rights and technology transfers,\u201d she said, adding that a modernized trading system would unlock the potential of services and e-commerce.\n\nRISK OF COMPLACENCY\n\nGeorgieva said one of the biggest risks was for governments to become complacent about trade conflicts and take no action to resolve them or support growth.\n\n\u201cWe are decelerating, we are not stopping, and it\u2019s not that bad. And yet, unless we act now, we are risking a potential more massive slowdown,\u201d Georgieva said.\n\nIf a synchronized slowdown in world economies worsens, she said, the world may need a \u201csynchronized policy response\u201d along the lines of stimulus efforts enacted during the 2008-2009 financial crisis.\n\nGeorgieva called for central banks around the world to maintain low rates where appropriate, but warned that this could prompt excessive credit growth and risky investments in the search for better yields, leading to increased financial vulnerabilities.\n\nFILE PHOTO: International Monetary Fund (IMF) Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva arrives for her first day in her new post at IMF headquarters in Washington, U.S. October 1, 2019. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst/File Photo\n\n\u201cOur new analysis shows that if a major downturn occurs, corporate debt at risk of default would rise to $19 trillion, or nearly 40 percent of the total debt in eight major economies,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is above the levels seen during the financial crisis.\u201d\n\nShe called on Germany, the Netherlands and South Korea to increase fiscal spending to support growth, but said such spending was not appropriate for all countries since public debt remained near record levels.", "description": "The global economy is experiencing a \"synchronized slowdown,\" the new head of the International Monetary Fund said on Tuesday, warning that it would worsen if governments failed to resolve trade conflicts and support growth.", "authors": ["David Lawder", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191008&t=2&i=1438501544&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF971A2", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
