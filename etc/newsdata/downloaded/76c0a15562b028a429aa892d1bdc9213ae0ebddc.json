Nicole Kidman stars as Carlson and Charlize Theron as Megyn Kelly, both of whom accused Ailes of sexual harassment. Margot Robbie also stars as a female producer, a fictional composite character, representing multiple other women who were harassed by Ailes, who resigned in July 2016 and died about a year later.\n\nIn her conversation with Entertainment Weekly, Carlson spoke about how she felt after viewing the trailer for the film, which shows a tense elevator ride shared by the three women at Fox News.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating \u2019cause I can say, \u2018Hey, wait a minute, you know, that was my life!\u2019 But the trailer got a tremendous amount of attention, and for me, that\u2019s what this is all about,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a strange and frustrating reality that I can\u2019t partake in any of these projects based on my settlement.\u201d\n\nIn 2016, Carlson was the first of several women at the network to come forward with sexual misconduct allegations against Ailes, who was forced to leave the company as a result. In the lead-up to the eruption of the #MeToo movement in 2017, Carlson was one of the most famous women who had come out against a powerful harasser and won. She was given a formal apology from the network and a $20 million settlement.\n\nCarlson has worked on a number of projects and initiatives for women facing similar circumstances, including her recent work on Capitol Hill stumping for a bill that would end forced arbitration in sexual harassment cases.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to pass the bill to take the muzzle off of women who face harassment in the workplace so that they\u2019re not forced into signing [nondisclosure agreements] and have to go to the secret chamber of arbitration where nobody ever knows what the hell happened to them,\u201d she told Entertainment Weekly.\n\nThough she was disappointed she couldn\u2019t participate in the \u201cBombshell\u201d project, Carlson said she was glad it enabled continued dialogue about the issue.\n\n\u201cAnd, most importantly, if it gives courage to men and women who are facing these kinds of situations to come forward, then that\u2019s the extra bonus,\u201d she said.\n\nThis summer, her story was also told by the Showtime series \u201cThe Loudest Voice,\u201d in which she was portrayed by Naomi Watts. Carlson said it felt \u201csurreal\u201d to see \u201cNaomi and Nicole\u201d playing her.\n\n\u201cI really feel like nobody would have done these movies three years ago when I jumped off the cliff all by myself in July of 2016.\u201d\n\nIn a July interview with HuffPost, Carlson said that watching \u201cThe Loudest Voice\u201d had been an incredibly emotional experience.\n\n\u201cBombshell\u201d is set to open Dec. 20.
