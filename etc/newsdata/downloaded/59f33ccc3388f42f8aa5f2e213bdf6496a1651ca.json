How to Play It With Stock Options.", "language": "en", "text": "Text size\n\nBank of America is a great stock for the long-term\u2014but it has been a difficult short-term trade heading into Wednesday\u2019s earnings report.\n\nA month ago, we recommended buying Bank of America\u2019s (ticker: BAC) October $30 calls that expire Oct. 25 to bullishly position for what was then the as of yet unscheduled release of the bank\u2019s third-quarter earnings report.\n\nAt the time, the stock was out of favor, and not much has changed since then\u2014except the price of the recommended call has fallen rather dramatically. The October $30 call that we recommended at $1.14 is now trading around 25 cents.\n\nStill, we believe the long-term merit of the stock is attractive, and thus we want to rejigger the trade in the belief that owning shares in one of the world\u2019s largest banks is ultimately beneficial. This view is somewhat out of consensus as many investors are concerned about owning financial stocks when the Federal Reserve is expected to lower interest rates, which could potentially crimp bank earnings.\n\nTo reposition ahead of Bank of America\u2019s earnings report, which the bank has since said would be released before the markets open on Wednesday, investors can sell downside puts and play this trade from both sides of the market.\n\nA short put and long call is an example of a risk reversal, a strategy that is often used to buy stocks on declines, while also participating in any advances. The strategy is usually implemented at the same time, but sometimes circumstances alter sequencing.\n\nWith Bank of America\u2019s stock at $29.05, investors can sell the October $29 put that expires Oct. 25 for 59 cents. This short put reduces total outlay to 55 cents in return for obligating investors to buy the stock at $29. The Oct. 25 expiration was chosen to give analysts and investors time to digest earnings.\n\nDuring the past 52-weeks, the stock has ranged from $22.66 to $31.37. The strike selection is aggressive because any hiccups in the earnings report will send the stock lower. Don\u2019t consider this trade if you are not willing to buy Bank of America\u2019s stock.\n\nIf the stock is above the strike price at expiration, investors can pocket the put premium. Should the stock price be below the put strike price at expiration, say because the earnings report or management\u2019s discussion of what the future proves glum, investors would be obligated to buy the stock or cover the put. If the stock is at $26, for example, investors would be obligated to buy the stock at the $29 strike price, or to buy back the put at a higher price. Because this put sale is an example of our \u201ctime arbitrage\u201d philosophy\u2014taking advantage of short-term trading strategies to control stocks worthy of long-term ownership\u2014just buy the stock and add it to the long-term investment portfolio.\n\nSo far this year, Bank of America is up 18%, as is the Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLF). Both are slightly lagging the 20% year-to-date return for the S&P 500, but beating the Dow Jones Industrial Average\u2019s 15% rise.\n\nThese are clearly extraordinary times in the markets, and yet Bank of America is holding up well in a time when investors are concerned about the impact low rates may have on bank profitability.\n\nBut this we know: markets fluctuate, and people will always need access to money, and that ultimately bodes well for major bank stocks.", "description": "A Bank of America options trade from a month ago didn\u2019t work out so well, so we take another whack at the trade heading into its earnings.", "authors": ["Steven M.
