The next hurdle is to get my licence back so I can drive the truck on the roads again,' he said.", "description": "Gary Webster, from Ravensthorpe, on the south coast of Western Australia, lost most of his left hand and two fingers on the other after the tractor accident in June.", "authors": ["Lauren Ferri For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/00/20261812-0-image-a-32_1572223649077.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
