FILE PHOTO: Wood-cased coloured pencils are pictured in a shop at Faber-Castell manufacturer in Stein\n\nBy Chris Taylor\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - There are a lot of hard truths about money, but here is one of the hardest: We are really bad at passing along money smarts.\n\nAs it stands, only 57% of American adults can be considered financially literate, according to a global survey by Standard & Poor\u2019s.\n\nA new initiation from education fundraising website DonorsChoose.org and the Charles Schwab (NYSE: ) Foundation is aiming to change that with a new hands-on approach. Rather than kids reading about starting a business, why not actually open a school store? Rather than reading about concepts like supply and demand, why not start making T-shirts, and see if they can sell them?\n\nThe \u201cInnovation Challenge\u201d prompts teachers to craft creative FinLit projects, helps them get funded, and then monitors which ones pay off.\n\n\u201cExperiential learning is so important, especially for lower-income families,\u201d said Casey Cortese, managing director of Schwab\u2019s community services, which is taking a new hands-on approach to teaching financial literacy. \u201cIf you make lessons tangible and real, it really cements learning.\u201d\n\nThis year's overall winner of an online fan vote: Students of Rapunzel Galang in Lanham, Maryland, undertook virtual-reality field trips to different historical landmarks through time. They did that using VR headsets \u2013 but first they had to plan, budget, and pay for such trips, by researching about the places they wanted to visit.\n\nAnother innovative project: Xavier Lewis in Dayton, Texas, combined financial literacy with a \u201cMission to Mars\u201d STEM project. Students earned money in their virtual bank accounts with attendance, class participation, and completing assignments. They could then spend that money to buy supplies to assemble rockets, rovers and hovercrafts for a simulated flight to Mars.\n\nOther projects included creating a virtual-reality bank, filming a how-to video series on personal finance, using dinosaurs to pass along money lessons, and teaching the idea of \u201cwants versus needs\u201d via dramatic play.\n\nKEEP IT GOING\n\nWhile 92% of teachers say financial education is important, only 12% actually undertake it - because they just don\u2019t have the resources, said Cortese.\n\nTo combat that with the Innovation Challenge, 15 of the top projects were developed into full lesson plans. Teachers across the country could then download them for free and use them in their own classes. The first 200 teachers who did so, and submitted a report on how it went, got a $250 credit to apply to future projects on the site.\n\nThe initiative has encouraged educators to think bigger and more creatively than just using a crowdfunding site like DonorsChoose to cover things like basic supplies. Since the Innovation Challenge first got started, \u201cThere has been a 66% increase in FinLit projects posted,\u201d said Rianne Roberts, partnerships manager for the fundraising site.\n\nFinancial literacy is a long game, though. You can teach a third grader about money smarts today, but you will not know for years whether those habits have actually taken root.\n\nWhen the Schwab Foundation first started partnering with the site in 2017, 350 teachers participated in its financial literacy campaigns, reaching 36,000 students. In 2019, in comparison, they have already reached 1,600 teachers and 250,000 students.\n\nSo far this year, Schwab donated $375,000 to the Innovation Challenge, and $500,000 total to DonorsChoose. Of those teachers who used the resulting materials, 98% said they plan to keep teaching financial literacy in schools.", "description": "Your Money: U.S. teachers take hands-on approach to financial literacy", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9G24L_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
