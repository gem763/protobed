The bil is due to be formally withdrawn this week.\n\nBritain returned Hong Kong to China in 1997 under a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula, which gives it wide-ranging autonomy and freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland.\n\nThe Hong Kong and Chinese governments have repeatedly warned foreign governments not interfere in the territory's internal affairs or fan anti-China sentiment.", "description": "Protesters have targeted force amid accusations of police brutality during months of demonstrations that began in June.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/15/2bf9bf81f6c94104b6f58b0b0a453b9a_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
