Rather, it points to troubling stresses building up in Wall Street\u2019s plumbing as investors complain that a lack of liquidity in the system to meet a surge of demand for cash has resulted in a jump in short-term borrowing costs.\n\nThe lack of cash circulating in short-term money markets has pushed up the effective fed funds rate, the actual level at which banks lend to each other overnight. As a result, Hills says the CME\u2019s tracker of rate decision probabilities may be reflecting the odds for the effective fed funds rate to remain elevated due to this week\u2019s funding squeeze, rather than expectations for the fed funds target range going forward.\n\nSee: Treasury is about to flood the market with debt to fund U.S.\u2019s $1 trillion deficit \u2014 and that is a concern\n\nThe effective fed funds rate, the actual level at which banks lend overnight, jumped above the interest rate on reserves that bank keep in excess of their reserve requirements (IOER) by 15 basis points as of Monday.\n\nUsually, this is seen as a temporary state of affairs because banks have no incentive to borrow from another bank when it could simply withdraw funds on deposit at the Fed, but the persistence of the fed funds rate above the IOER has raised questions whether the central bank is losing its grip over its benchmark interest rate.\n\nMarket participants have pointed to the sharp jump in the repurchase rate, or repo rate, on Monday and Tuesday as the most recent trigger for the higher fed funds rate. This key interest rate represents the amount that banks, dealers and hedge funds are charged for borrowing funds for a short period of time, in return for collateral such as Treasurys. This rate jumped as high as 8% on Tuesday, according to ICAP, even though it is usually expected to stick near the fed funds rate.\n\nInvestors tend to be nervous about a climb in repo rates as they\u2019re usually associated with banking crises and credit crunches. Repo rates spiked back in the 2008 financial crisis when banks were unwilling to lend to each other amid questions about their solvency.\n\nBloomberg Repurchasing rates spike\n\nAnalysts say a perfect storm of factors may have been responsible for the spike in repo rates this week.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury Department is rebuilding its cash reserves, after running them down to keep the government open, before Congress finally raised the federal debt ceiling in July. To do that the Treasury has been issuing a deluge of short term debt and parking the funds in its Treasury General Account (TGA) at the Fed.\n\nIn addition, the deadline for corporate tax payments in September fell on Monday. Investors pulled billions of dollars from short-term funding markets as companies redirected those funds to the Treasury Department. Analysts also cited the settlement of several debt auctions on Monday, and the lack of space on bond dealers' balance sheets.\n\n\u201cThe TGA rebuild ... represents a large reserve drain and the withdrawal of this cash from money markets has materially tightened funding,\u201d wrote Mark Cabana, head of short-term rates at Bank of America Merrill Lynch on Monday.\n\nMost importantly, banks have seen their reserves drained by the shrinkage of the U.S. central bank\u2019s balance sheet from Oct. 2017 to Sept. 2019, meaning they have less to loan out to liquidity-starved investors. It\u2019s why some market participants have demanded the Fed to restart quantitative easing or bond buying.\n\n\u201cThe Fed has reduced the level of reserves too much and will need to start growing its balance sheet again soon,\u201d wrote Krishna Guha, vice chairman of Evercore ISI.\n\nRead: Fed has a \u2018tin ear\u2019 to market concern over balance sheet\n\nThis week\u2019s funding squeeze has drawn calls for the Fed to prevent another seize-up in short-term lending markets.\n\nMore immediately, investors say the central bank may tweak the IOER so the effective fed funds rate stays within its desired range. Others said the central bank needed to carry out repurchasing operations, in effect, temporarily buying securities from banks and boosting their reserves.\n\nThe New York Fed delivered on those expectations on Tuesday. It offered to buy $75 bln in the repo markets and dealers said it bought about $53 billion, and short term rates quickly dropped to normal levels as a result.", "description": "The rise in short-term borrowing costs such as repurchasing rates have drawn questions over the lack of liquidity in Wall Street\u2019s plumbing.", "authors": ["Sunny Oh"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR421_plumbi_ZG_20190917090909.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
