Stewart, another of the 21 Tories who had the party whip withdrawn last month, said he and some of his fellow rebels had been negotiating \u201cthrough the night\u201d to give parliament more control over the next phase of the Brexit negotiations, including being able to vote for an extension to the talks.\n\nHowever, the group of 21 former Tory MPs is split, meaning the government could possibly narrowly still win with the backing of some Labour MPs.\n\nMargot James, another of the whipless Tories, told the Guardian she was planning to support the government on all votes. Ed Vaizey, another former Conservative, also indicated he was planning to vote for Johnson\u2019s timetable, although he said he may change his mind if Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the House of Commons, continued to send \u201cludicrous tweets\u201d saying \u201ca vote against the programme motion is a vote against Brexit\u201d.\n\nOthers are agonising over the decision, amid fears there could be consequences of Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal that will take longer than three days to spot.\n\nNo 10\u2019s threat to pull the bill appear intended to scare MPs who want a Brexit deal passed before an election.\n\nMPs have been given three days to consider the withdrawal agreement bill (WAB), the legislation that formally puts the Brexit deal into law under treaty, prompting concern the process is being rushed.\n\nThe Commons will vote on Monday evening on the so-called programme motion, which sets out this timetable, shortly after voting on the second reading for the bill.\n\nMany MPs have raised the worry that a clause of the WAB allowing an extension to the transition period beyond the end of 2020 can only be triggered by ministers, not parliament, and that if no trade deal was completed before then, it could be a \u201ctrapdoor\u201d to no deal.\n\nHowever, Johnson\u2019s spokesman insisted the 2020 deadline was sufficient, and that the PM had no intention of allowing a longer extension period.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s set out very clearly in the political declaration that the UK and the EU sides both agree that the implementation period concludes at the end of 2020,\u201d he said. \u201cThe prime minister has been clear on any number of occasions that he is not intending to extend the implementation period.\u201d\n\nTo deal with the issue of a 2020 crash-out, Nick Boles, a former Tory, said he had tabled an amendment that would go even further, making a two-year extension to the transition period automatic if there were no trade deal in place by the end of next year.\n\nHe said it would \u201cwould require the government to seek an extension to the transition to December 2022 unless MPs vote to the contrary \u2026 essential to stop hardline ERG members forcing through a no-deal Brexit in December 2020.\u201d\n\n\n\nClause 30, among a series of contentious clauses identified in the 115-page WAB, which MPs first saw on Monday evening, dictates that only ministers can seek a longer transition period, even though this must then be approved by parliament.\n\nHilary Benn, the Labour MP who chairs the Brexit select committee, tweeted: \u201cWhat happens if the government doesn\u2019t propose an extension? Parliament would have no say and we would exit the transition period on the 31 December 2020 even if a trade agreement hadn\u2019t been reached by then with the EU; ie no deal.\u201d\n\nThe Green MP Caroline Lucas called the clause \u201cthe trapdoor to no deal\u201d, adding: \u201cIf the government doesn\u2019t propose an extension to the transition, MPs have no say, and therefore if negotiations on future relationship unfinished by end of December next year, we\u2019re out.\u201d", "description": "Downing Street faces down MPs pushing for concessions to stop no-deal Brexit before they agree to Johnson\u2019s timetable", "authors": ["Peter Walker", "Rowena Mason"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/87d77ae86c5625dea311670f1bab7bf17ad158d3/0_85_1870_1121/master/1870.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5fa1d1bf86fbd464712bfa3de762d83f", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
