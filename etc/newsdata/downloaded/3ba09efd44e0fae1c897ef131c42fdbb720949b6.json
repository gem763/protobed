The cab and trailer left the port shortly after 1.05am.\u201d\n\nBelgium\u2019s federal prosecutor\u2019s office said the lorry was only in the country for a short time as it passed through the port of Zeebrugge.\n\nCooling containers often move swiftly through the North Sea port, often just with a visual check, for the short crossing to England.\n\nExperts said temperatures in refrigerated lorry units can be as low as -25C.\n\nDetectives are investigating whether organised criminal gangs could be behind the deaths. Fears are growing that the case could become one of Britain\u2019s worse people-smuggling tragedies.\n\nAuthorities moved the lorry and the container to Tilbury Docks so the bodies could be recovered while preserving the victims\u2019 dignity.\n\n\u201cEach of the 39 people must undergo a full coroner\u2019s process to establish a cause of death, before we move on to attempting to identify each individual within the trailer,\u201d a police spokesperson said.\n\n\u201cThis will be a substantial operation and, at this stage, we cannot estimate how long these procedures will take.\u201d\n\nPriti Patel, the Home Secretary, met with Essex Police on Thursday to receive an update on the investigation.\n\nSimon Coveney, the deputy Irish premier, said the country\u2019s police force, the Garda Siochana, would co-operate fully with the investigation.\n\n\u201cThis is an issue that comes right into our own lives, into the UK and the investigation that\u2019s under way at the moment involves Garda Siochana,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe investigation taking place will have the absolute and full co-operation of an Garda Siochana.\u201d\n\nHours after the bodies were discovered on Wednesday, police in Kent found nine people alive in the back of a lorry on the M20.\n\nA further six people were found alive in the back of a second vehicle also driving down the London-bound carriageway on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nThe discoveries come as the National Crime Agency (NCA) said the number of migrants being smuggled into Britain in lorries has risen in the last year.\n\nThe NCA has previously warned that it suspects criminal networks of targeting quieter ports on the east and south coasts of the UK, such as Purfleet.\n\nA Border Force assessment had also highlighted Zeebrugge as among the \u201ckey ports of embarkation for clandestine arrivals\u201d.\n\nThe Independent has contacted the Chinese embassy in the UK for comment.\n\nAdditional reporting by agencies", "description": "The 39 people found dead in a refrigerated\u00a0lorry trailer in Essex were Chinese nationals, detectives have said.
