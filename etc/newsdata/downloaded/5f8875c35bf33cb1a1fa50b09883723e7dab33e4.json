A few lines for Jonathan Toews. A few more for a couple new teammates.\n\nIt was like he never left.\n\nTrying for a turnaround after two down years, the Chicago Blackhawks once again dipped into their past as part of a flurry of offseason moves. General manager Stan Bowman reacquired Shaw in a trade with Montreal in June, looking to add more grit and energy to a lineup that seemed like it needed a spark at times last year.\n\nThe 28-year-old Shaw returns to Chicago a married father, with another child on the way. But the pesky forward said his game remains very similar.\n\n\u201cMaybe just a little less reckless,\u201d he said. \u201cStill physical, still hits, but just try not to lead with my head anymore.\u201d\n\nShaw was selected by Chicago in the fifth round of the 2011 draft. He helped the Blackhawks win the Stanley Cup in 2013 and 2015 before he was dealt to the Canadiens three years ago.\n\nThe addition of Shaw gives coach Jeremy Colliton another versatile piece. He could grab a spot on one of Chicago\u2019s top two lines, or provide some offense on the third or fourth group. Shaw set career highs with 28 assists and 47 points in his final season with Montreal. He scored a career-best 20 goals during the 2013-14 season with the Blackhawks.\n\n\u201cWhether he\u2019s top six or he could be on the fourth line, he\u2019s still going to contribute,\u201d Colliton said. \u201cWe want to have that sort of personality throughout our lineup. I think we have a bunch of guys who can move up and down.\u201d\n\nShaw became one of Chicago\u2019s most beloved players during his first stint with the team, and he said he has been greatly warmly since he came back this summer.\n\n\u201cLove. I mean pure love. It\u2019s awesome,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople coming up to you, recognizing you, glad to have you back, saying they missed you. It feels good. It feels good to be loved.\u201d\n\nWHO\u2019S HERE\n\nThe Blackhawks acquired Calvin de Haan and Olli Maatta in a pair of June trades to help bolster their defensive pairings. But de Haan is coming back from right shoulder surgery and Maatta has struggled with injuries over the years, in addition to concerns about his skating ability.\n\nWHO\u2019S NOT\n\nChicago traded promising young defenseman Henri Jokiharju to Buffalo in July for Alex Nylander, a talented forward who hasn\u2019t lived up to expectations since he was selected by the Sabres with the eighth overall pick in the 2016 draft. The progress of the 20-year-old Jokiharju and 21-year-old Nylander will be closely watched in Chicago and Buffalo over the next couple seasons.\n\nKEY PLAYERS\n\nThe addition of Robin Lehner gives Chicago one of the best goaltender situations in the league. Lehner agreed to a $5 million, one-year deal in free agency after he went 25-13-5 with a 2.13 goals-against average last season with the New York Islanders. Corey Crawford was sidelined by a concussion during each of the past two seasons, but showed flashes of his stellar form last year. If Lehner or Crawford goes down, the Blackhawks have Collin Delia waiting in the minors.\n\nOUTLOOK\n\nChicago allowed a whopping 291 goals last season, second worst in the league behind Ottawa, and finished with the NHL\u2019s worst penalty kill at 72.7%. Bowman made several moves this summer to address those issues. If they don\u2019t work out, it could be another long year.\n\nPREDICTION\n\nLife is tough in the rough-and-tumble Central Division, home of the defending Stanley Cup champion Blues and the loaded Predators and Jets. But if de Haan and Maatta can stay healthy and Chicago gets more secondary scoring from its bottom two lines, it could return to the playoffs after a two-year absence.\n\n___\n\nJay Cohen can be reached at https://twitter.com/jcohenap\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL coverage: https://apnews.com/tag/NHL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Andrew Shaw started chirping right away.
