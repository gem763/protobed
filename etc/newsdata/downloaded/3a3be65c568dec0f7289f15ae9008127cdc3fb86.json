Amazing content can be expensive. We don\u2019t shy away from taking bold swings if we think the business impact will also be amazing.\"\n\nNetflix is spending $15 billion this year all in the name of being amazing. Still, it is not always easy to see tangible amazement since the streamer is notoriously secretive with its viewership data.\n\nThe service did release some viewership numbers with its earnings, boasting that \"Stranger Things\" pulled in 64 million views in the four weeks following its July 4 premiere. Netflix said this surpasses the numbers of any of the shows for which it has released similar figures in past earnings reports. That data though has been few and far between.\n\n\"Stranger Things\" cast\n\nSeveral third-party outfits try to track Netflix viewing. One streaming \"guide,\" Reelgood, pulls data from users about what they're watching and uses that to extrapolate the most-watched programming in a given week.\n\nSo FOX Business, using Reelgood data, is taking a look at the top Netflix originals for the week of Oct. 10.\n\n1. THE POLITICIAN\n\nFrom uber-producer Ryan (\"American Horror Story,\" \"Glee\") Murphy's latest high school tale tracks a student who has known since he was 7 years old that he is going to be the president of the United States. But first, to get to the White House he must press the flesh in the hallways of St. Sebastian High School in the race for student body commander-in-chief. Gwyneth Paltrow co-stars.\n\n2. BIG MOUTH\n\nFeaturing a stellar line-up of comedy voices such as John Mullaney, Maya Rudolph and Fred Armisen, the animated series follows a group of 7th graders, including best friends Nick Birch and Andrew Glouberman, as they make their way through puberty in the leafy suburbs of New York City.\n\n3. THE SPY\n\nFunnyman Sacha Baron Cohen takes a serious turn in this six-part, inspired by true events mini-series. Cohen plays an Israeli desk clerk in the 1960s who becomes an undercover agent for the Mossad, the Israeli spy agency, who goes inside Syria on a dangerous and lengthy mission.\n\n4. DISENCHANTMENT\n\nFrom the mind of \"Simpsons\" creator Matt Groening it is the opposite of \"Frozen\" or \"Cinderella.\" In this fantasy cartoon, Princess Bean of Dreamland is a 19-year-old whose favorite royal duty is drinking and hanging out with her elf friend, Elfo, and her personal demon, Luci \" All of which exasperates her father the king.\n\n5.
