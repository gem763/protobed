But this plan involves finer tuning. The smart campaign will make its best guess as to the handful of states where the smallest growth in support will generate the largest boon in the Electoral College, spend as little time and money as possible everywhere else, and hope for the best.\n\nIt\u2019s a gamble, yes \u2014 akin to an investor making a small number of high-risk bets on a few companies rather than diversifying their portfolio through interest funds and the like. But the current electoral map is sufficiently baked against the Democrats that it could be their only path to victory.", "description": "", "authors": ["Chris Wilson", "Time.Com Democrats-Electoral-College"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
