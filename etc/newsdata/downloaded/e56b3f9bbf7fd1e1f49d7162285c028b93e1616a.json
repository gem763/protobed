USA TODAY\n\nDETROIT -- With Dalvin Cook routinely running with authority, the Minnesota Vikings are more than content to be a run-first team in the pass-happy NFL.\n\nBut the results of the past three weeks suggest the Vikings will find more team success when quarterback Kirk Cousins\u2019 arm is the star of the show. Cousins threw for 300 or more yards for the third consecutive week and the Vikings (5-2) downed the Lions 42-30 Sunday for their third consecutive win.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s playing very free right now,\u201d Vikings coach Mike Zimmer said. \u201cHe\u2019s letting the ball loose. Even on some incompletions, he\u2019s putting the ball in the right places.\u201d\n\nCousins was 24-for-34 for 337 yards and four touchdowns against the Lions (2-3-1). He did that with key receiver Adam Thielen leaving the game in the first quarter after injuring his hamstring on a touchdown catch.\n\nVikings quarterback Kirk Cousins next faces his former team, the Redskins on Thursday. (Photo: Tim Fuller, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nCousins\u2019 surge comes at an opportune time because the Vikings have to play again Thursday against the Washington Redskins, his former team.\n\n\u201cIt like the (offense) couldn\u2019t be stopped,\u201d Vikings linebacker Eric Kendricks said about the win. \u201cThey were spreading the ball around. I saw multiple players get the ball, everybody got the ball, fullbacks, tight ends, receivers, deep balls, intermediate \u2026\u201d\n\nOver the past three weeks, Cousins had thrown for 976 yards with 10 touchdowns and no turnovers. He has eight touchdowns in the past two weeks.\n\nOn Sunday, he spread his passes among nine players.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s playing the best I\u2019ve seen since he\u2019s been here,\u201d Zimmer said.\n\nComing into this game, the Vikings had run 52.96% of the time. San Francisco and Baltimore are the only other teams running more than they pass. Against the Lions, Cook ran 25 times for 142 yards and the Vikings had 37 rushing attempts.\n\nThe Vikings were daring as well as dynamic. Instead of trying to run down the clock with three minutes remaining and the ball on their own 25, Cousins connected on a 64-yard pass to Stefon Diggs.\n\nAt the time, the Vikings led by five, and the Lions had two timeouts left and the two minute warning.\n\n\u201cWe just thought we don\u2019t want to punt to them, \u201c Cousins said. \u201cWe said let\u2019s take advantage of the fact they loading up the box.\u201d\n\nCousins said the Lions\u2019 stacked defense to stop the run meant \u201cthere would be no safety help\u201d covering Diggs.\n\nTwo plays after that completion, Cook scored on a short run to eliminate the Lions\u2019 comeback hope.\n\nThe Vikings say they are simply taking what defenses give them, and that has led to a balanced attack. With Cook averaging 103 yards, the Vikings are still going to rely heavily on the run even if Cousins continues to be on fire. No NFL team has broken off more runs of 20 or more yards this season than the Vikings\u2019 10.\n\n\u201cWe were running the ball proficiently,\u201d Cousins said. \u201cAnd when you do that it helps the play calling and helps a quarterback feel like the wind is at his back.\u201d\n\nHe said the coaches\u2019 management of the game was crucial to the big offensive days. He said most of his team\u2019s third down situations were manageable. The Vikings didn\u2019t have many third and longs. \u201cI thought when the plays were coming in, I was in agreement so many times,\u201d Cousins said.\n\nAsked why he is so hot, Cousins said: \u201cIt\u2019s not that simple. ... The game plans have put me in position to be successful.\"", "description": "Kirk \u00a0Cousins\u2019 surge comes at an opportune time because the Vikings have to play again Thursday against the Washington Redskins, his former team.", "authors": ["Kevin Allen", "Published P.M.
