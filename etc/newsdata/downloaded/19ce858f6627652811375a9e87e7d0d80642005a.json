Since then, state lawmakers and departments have been forced to re-examine a system long dependent on sending plastic bottles, cardboard boxes and paper across the ocean.\n\n\u201cYou need to have a market and that\u2019s what we lost with China,\u201d said Anne Germain, vice president of technical and regulatory affairs for the National Waste & Recycling Association, an industry trade group. Up until now, she said, there has been no incentive for anyone to strengthen domestic markets.\n\nNow, states are looking to open up new markets for their recycling products, improve processing infrastructure and create public awareness campaigns to reduce contamination as they search for a more comprehensive\u2014and more domestic\u2014approach.\n\nAt least 10 states have passed or enacted legislation this year concerning recycling management. That is on top of another 200 bills introduced this year aimed at reducing single-use plastics.\n\nOn the West Coast, where China\u2019s policy shift hit particularly hard, officials from different states started meeting once a month to swap ideas and brainstorm strategies.\n\nIn California, the stakes are high. The state\u2019s largest recycling center shut down earlier this month. And about two-thirds of California\u2019s recyclables exported abroad went to China before the restrictions took place, according to CalRecycle, a part of the state\u2019s Environmental Protection Agency that oversees waste management.\n\n\u201cWith the loss of international markets, we\u2019re really being forced to look at our own waste now,\u201d said CalRecycle spokesman Lance Klug. \u201cWe\u2019re asking some tough questions that we probably should\u2019ve been asking for a long time.\u201d\n\n\u2018We\u2019re asking some tough questions that we probably should\u2019ve been asking for a long time,\u2019 said a spokesman for CalRecycle.

Two sweeping, twin bills in the state Senate and Assembly aim to reduce, reuse or recycle 75% of single-use plastics in the state by 2030, create end markets and implement more uniform recycling policies across cities, among other changes. Another bill would raise the minimum percentage of recycled plastic required in water bottles.\n\nOpponents of the legislation worry about the costs, infrastructure and potential impact on consumers.\n\nIn 2017, the U.S. exported about 14.5 million metric tons of scrap recyclables to China, according to the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries, an industry trade group. That dropped to around 9.4 million metric tons in 2018. Since China implemented its new policy at the start of 2018, U.S. states and cities have felt the brunt of falling prices on certain recyclables. The average price for mixed paper in the U.S., for example, dropped from $67 in August 2017 to negative $2 in August 2019.\n\nSearching for temporary stopgaps, municipalities have sent some recyclables to landfills and stopped accepting certain kinds of plastic or incinerated items.\n\n\u201cThe import restrictions recently imposed by China and other countries are not the cause of the challenges facing the U.S. recycling system today; rather, they have brought to light pre-existing issues related to how we manage our recycled materials in the U.S.,\u201d said a spokeswoman for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nIn Washington state, officials are in the process of hiring a director for a new Recycling Development Center. Formed under legislation passed this year, the center was designed to strengthen recycling markets and improve processing in coordination with the state\u2019s Ecology and Commerce departments.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very good at collecting materials but not very good at using those materials,\u201d said Alli Kingfisher, the statewide recycling coordinator at Washington\u2019s Department of Ecology. Washington previously exported more than 60% of its recyclables to China, she said.\n\nNeighboring Oregon\u2019s recycling processing plants have geared up with new equipment and new hires, said Peter Spendelow, natural-resource specialist at the state Department of Environmental Quality. The state pulled together a recycling steering committee focused on improving infrastructure and creating legal frameworks to tackle the issue.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS What confuses you most about recycling? Join the conversation below.\n\n\u201cEverything\u2019s on the table,\u201d Mr. Spendelow said.\n\nAcross the country, Maine could soon require package producers to support recycling programs and cover at least 80% of the cost of packaging materials sold in the state that aren\u2019t easily recyclable. Officials in New Jersey and Massachusetts have focused their efforts on ensuring unwanted materials\u2014like plastic bags, hoses or cookware\u2014stay out of recycling bins.\n\nThat is a focus for industry groups, too, as less contamination in recycling systems can make the material more clean and valuable. But it requires significant investment in public-awareness efforts.\n\nAwareness campaigns in Massachusetts have helped decrease noncompliant recycling by anywhere from 30% to 80%, said Greg Cooper, director of hazardous and solid waste at the state\u2019s Department of Environmental Protection. Massachusetts has provided close to $1 million in grants to 28 communities since 2017 to improve local recycling programs, and last year launched a statewide education initiative.\n\nCreating a new market, however, \u201cis not going to happen overnight,\u201d Mr. Cooper said. \u201cWe\u2019re doing what we can do, right now: cleaning up the best we can.\u201d\n\nWrite to Jennifer Calfas at Jennifer.Calfas@wsj.com", "description": "Two years ago, two-thirds of California\u2019s recyclables exported abroad went to China.
