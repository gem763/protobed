(Ben Stansall/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nJeremy Corbyn had demanded an election dozens of times, insisting his Labour Party was eager, as he put it in July, to \u201clet the people decide their future.\u201d\n\nBut when British Prime Minister Boris Johnson dangled the prospect of a new vote last week, the leader of the country\u2019s largest opposition party overcame temptation and batted it away, likening it to \u201can offer of an apple to Snow White from the Wicked Queen.\u201d\n\nEvery other British opposition party joined him, forming a united front that led to two humiliating defeats for the prime minister \u2014 and a scrambled picture of where Britain goes next with Brexit.\n\nThe story of British politics in recent days has been dominated by Johnson\u2019s stumbles, including an unbroken record of losses on key parliamentary votes, along with purges, defections and even family rejections.\n\nBut analysts say it all would have turned out very differently had the so-called \u201crebel alliance\u201d \u2014 a motley crew of opposition parties and moderate members of Johnson\u2019s own Conservative Party \u2014 not hung together to thwart his plans for a possible no-deal exit from the European Union.\n\n[A chaotic final night for Parliament leaves Johnson with bleak choices on the path to Brexit]\n\nFor parties and politicians unaccustomed to teaming up, the coordination has been a shock.\n\nThere has been \u201cvery little experience, if any, of close cooperation between opposition parties,\u201d said Tom Brake, Brexit point person for the pro-E.U. Liberal Democrats and a member of Parliament since 1997. \u201cThe cooperation we\u2019ve seen on Brexit is really the first example of that for many decades.\u201d\n\nNow, with Brexit and a possible election still in the balance, the question is how far the cooperation will go. In particular, analysts wonder whether Johnson opponents can demonstrate unity in backing something they are all for, instead of just blocking proposals they oppose.\n\n\u201cThe opposition has managed to be united in frustrating the government,\u201d said Bronwen Maddox, director of the London-based Institute for Government. \u201cBut the things that are not agreed are even more important.\u201d\n\nMost critical of all: what to do about Brexit and whether to form a pact in the next election, which is still expected later this year.\n\nAnd on those questions, Johnson opponents have far less common ground.\n\n[Boris Johnson has four options to escape his Brexit mess. One of them is to go to jail.]\n\nAlthough they all fear or loathe the idea of a no-deal exit, they have vastly different ideas about what shape Britain\u2019s exit should take \u2014 or whether the country should leave at all.\n\nSome \u2014 including a cross-party group created on Tuesday called \u201cMPs for a Deal\u201d \u2014 want Britain to quickly come to terms with the E.U. on a soft exit along the lines of the one negotiated by former prime minister Theresa May.\n\nOthers, including Labour\u2019s Corbyn, advocate a second referendum, potentially without the party taking a stand on whether voters should back \u201cleave\u201d or \u201cremain.\u201d\n\nThe Liberal Democrats, meanwhile, have proposed canceling Britain\u2019s plans for an exit by taking back the Article 50 withdrawal letter announcing the U.K.\u2019s plan to leave.\n\n\n\nJo Swinson, leader of the Liberal Democrats, speaks in the House of Commons last week.

Now the prime minister\u2019s party is gunning for his seat, with Brexit on the line.]\n\nThe parties that cooperated in recent days will, in many cases, be vying for the same set of voters: Britons who backed remain, or who wanted to leave but don\u2019t like the idea of crashing out without a deal.\n\nIn Britain\u2019s first-past-the-post voting system, that means parties such as Labour and the Liberal Democrats could end up both losing to the Conservatives, even in areas that voted \u201cremain,\u201d if they divide the pro-E.U. vote.\n\nForming a pact in which parties agree on where to compete, and where to stand down, \u201ccan make a huge difference,\u201d Maddox said.\n\nThere\u2019s a similar dynamic at play on the anti-E.U. side, with the nascent Brexit Party offering Johnson\u2019s Tories a deal that could unite the \u201cleave\u201d vote. Johnson has so far been cool to the idea, but analysts say it could deliver him the majority he has sought.\n\nBrake said that if the Conservatives and the Brexit Party make a deal, then \u201copposition parties need to look seriously at how they would respond to that.\u201d\n\nElection cooperation would come with peril. Corbyn, who is unapologetic about left-wing views that include nationalization of the rail and energy sectors, is anathema to many of the pro-business voters of the Liberal Democrats.\n\nIn Scotland, Labour and the Scottish National Party have been able to work together to oppose the Tories on Brexit, despite the fact that they disagree over whether Scotland should be independent \u2014 and maintain a bitter rivalry.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve reached the point where any action that can be taken to stop a no-deal Brexit has to be taken,\u201d said Carol Monaghan, an SNP lawmaker who won a longtime Labour seat in Glasgow in 2015. \u201cEven Labour is finally coming to that realization.\u201d\n\nAs long as a no-deal Brexit is on the table, at least some level of cooperation appears likely to persist. In the wee hours of Tuesday morning, the opposition parties united to beat back Johnson\u2019s second attempt to deliver an election, with Corbyn and others arguing that it represented a backdoor path to no-deal.\n\nAnd they stuck around for hours afterward to protest the government\u2019s plan to suspend Parliament until mid-October. Opposition lawmakers attempted to halt that suspension, waving placards that read \u201cSilenced,\u201d shouting \u201cShame! Shame!\u201d at Conservative members and trying to physically block Speaker John Bercow from leaving his chair.\n\nBercow, who on Monday afternoon had dramatically announced plans to step down from the job, made clear he appreciated the rebellious mood. He called the decision to bar the doors of Parliament amid the political crisis of Brexit \u201can act of executive fiat.\u201d\n\nAcross the opposition benches, lawmakers cheered.\n\nRead more\n\nBoris Johnson\u2019s statements about the state of Brexit negotiations bear little relationship to reality, E.U. officials say\n\n\u2018The Trumpization of U.K. politics\u2019: Boris Johnson is busting political norms\n\nWho is British House of Commons Speaker John Bercow?
