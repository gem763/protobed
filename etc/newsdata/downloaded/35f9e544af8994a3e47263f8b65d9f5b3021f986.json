Releasing intimate images of someone without their consent \u2014 commonly known as revenge porn \u2014 is illegal in California and many other states.\n\nWhy there\u2019s debate\n\nThe situation differs from the typical political sex scandal in a number of ways, prompting debate over whether Hill is being fairly punished for her actual indiscretions, or if she's being pushed out by sexist and anti-LGBTQ forces.\n\nWhile there's broad consensus that having a relationship with a subordinate is inappropriate, the severity of that misdeed \u2014 and whether it merited Hill\u2019s departure from Congress \u2014 is a source of strong disagreement, especially given the malicious and potentially criminal ways the information became public.\n\nHer defenders point to numerous straight male representatives who have faced similar scandals, only to hold onto their seats, as evidence of a double standard women face when it comes to issues of sexual impropriety and a lack of familiarity that leads queer relationships to be treated as more scandalous.\n\nWhat\u2019s next:\n\nHill has said she intends to pursue legal action over the release of the photos. A special election will be held to decide who takes over her seat in Congress.\n\nPerspectives\n\nHaving a relationship with a staffer isn\u2019t what pushed Hill out of Congress.\n\n\"The truth is that it wasn\u2019t the affair that ended Hill\u2019s time in Congress \u2014 it was the explicit photos. More accurately, it was \u2018revenge porn\u2019 that killed her career.\u201d \u2014 Jessica Valenti, Gen\n\nThe misdeeds of women and LGBTQ people are treated differently.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a reminder both that men aren\u2019t the only ones who can engage in sexual misconduct and that coverage of the issue is just as vulnerable to sexism, homophobia, and biphobia as any other topic.\u201d \u2014 Anna North, Vox\n\nOveremphasis on Hill's sexuality clouds the abuse she was a victim of.\n\n\u201cMuch of the media coverage surrounding Hill has focused on her sex life; who she did or did not sleep with. The fascination likely stems from the fact that she is LGBTQ and allegedly involved in a polyamorous relationship. But by focusing on her sexuality, an important fact is being lost in translation. Hill is not accused of committing a crime by dating her campaign staffer, but she may be a victim of one.\u201d \u2014 Melissa Jeltsen, HuffPost\n\nAnyone in Hill\u2019s position, regardless of gender or sexuality, should resign.\n\n\u201cIf Hill happened to have a promiscuous personal life with people not under her pay or in violation of ethics, there\u2019s little doubt that she\u2019d be able to ride out the storm. \u2026 But this is, in fact, a #MeToo success story, one that proves that the powerful, even women, can still be held to account.\u201d \u2014 Tiana Lowe, Washington Examiner\n\nAbuse dynamics can be complicated.\n\n\u201cWe like to think of that as really black and white \u2014 you\u2019re a victim or you\u2019re a perpetrator \u2026 and it\u2019s uncomfortable to say you can be both.\u201d \u2014 Victim rights advocate Carly Mee to Daily Beast\n\nHill has made appropriate amends for her misdeeds, now she deserves justice.\n\n\u201cI think Hill is doing the right thing. Having an affair with a subordinate is wrong. I think we can say that. I think we can also say that revenge porn is many, many magnitudes worse than a consensual affair. \u2026 She resigned, over. Now let\u2019s talk about what happened to her, what she was a victim of.\u201d \u2014 Jill Filipovic, CNN\n\nWomen are given less room to make mistakes than men.", "description": "Freshman congresswoman Katie Hill announced her resignation after admitting to a relationship with a campaign staffer.
