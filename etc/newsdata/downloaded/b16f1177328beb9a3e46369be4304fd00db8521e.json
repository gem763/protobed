With no visible injuries present on the bodies of the five family members, police suspected poisoning as their cause of death.\n\nThe father of the two dead children told the Fiji Sun that his father-in-law, also among the deceased, was interested in witchcraft.\n\n\u201cI never saw anyone or any family so much into witchcraft than my in-laws,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI used to see my in-laws and other witchdoctors making a doll from dough and poking needles in it. I always took my daughters away into the bedroom. My wife and daughters were obviously also dragged into it.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, three weeks after the bodies were found and after toxicology reports were ordered, police laid charges.\n\nThe suspect, who has permanent residency status in New Zealand, and his wife had been questioned by police last month, with court order issued to prevent the pair leaving Fiji.\n\nHe will appear in a Nadi court later on Monday charged with five murders and one attempted murder.\n\nThe child found at the scene, referred to in Fijian media as the \u201cmiracle baby\u201d, has since been released from hospital.", "description": "Family of five, including two children, found dead in the highlands in August, with no visible injuries", "authors": ["Australian Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90e515c7b267ac299f99ebf270daaa21f536c149/0_34_2200_1321/master/2200.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=442e058b22c321d20d4e84447e814faa", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
