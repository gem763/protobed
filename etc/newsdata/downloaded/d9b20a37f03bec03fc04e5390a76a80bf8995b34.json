I think kind of the whole reason that we're making it is because it's needed, you know?\n\nSo we still get a lot of giggles and a lot of people saying, \"Oh my God, I can't believe you're doing that!\" But that's kind of why we need it really too. Because it's such a taboo subject.\n\nAnd if it wasn't a taboo subject then why would we be doing it?\n\nWell, what do you think you can accomplish with a vagina museum?\n\nWell, what I'm hoping is to really destigmatize this part of the body.\n\nIt's a really taboo topic \u2014 and that has lots of real-world consequences. You know, like people being too embarrassed to go to get their cervical smears, and people not being able to talk to their doctors.\n\nIt becomes very difficult to talk about it, which has this impact on your life.\n\nMuseums are used by societies and communities to showcase what they think is important. And so, by having a vagina museum, it's us as a community coming together and saying, \"This is a part of the body that we think should be valued and should be celebrated.\"\n\nVagina Museum founder Florence Shechter, right, with museum volunteer Jasmine Evans. (Nicole Rixon/Vagina Museum)\n\nWe have interviewed the founding director of the Penis Museum, which is in Iceland. And you know that he collects phalluses of all animals \u2014 including people. Do you actually have specimens of vaginas on display in your museum?\n\nWe won't have any specimens. But we might in the future. The museum's quite small because this is just our first premises.\n\nAnd so, our exhibitions are going to range from everything from science and health, to arts to culture to \u2014 you know, social history. So there'll be lots and lots of different types of things on display.\n\nSigur\u00f0ur Hjartarson tells As it Happens host Carol Off about his quest to find a human penis for his Icelandic Phallological Museum. (Originally aired August 28, 2007) 6:32\n\nYou have a crowdfunding campaign and a video where you're dressed up. Can you describe to people how you're dressed up?\n\nYeah. So we put on what is essentially a vulva suit. It was like a dress-up costume where it turns your whole body into a vulva and your head is the clitoris. It was a lot of fun. Very warm.\n\n\n\nNow, what you're saying is something very important, because it's a vulva costume. And there is always this discussion about that people don't know that there is a vulva and a vagina. And so your vagina museum also includes vulvas, I presume.\n\nYes exactly. Yeah. The name was quite difficult, because the museum is going to be about everything from the ovaries and the uterus, to the clitoris and the labia and everything in between. So the most accurate sort of name would actually be the Gynecological Museum.\n\nBut obviously, that sounds super gross. Like who would go to that, except like, medical students? So we were trying to think, \"What can we use that's actually accessible?\"\n\nAnd we got down to vagina and vulva \u2014 where vagina is just like the \"tubey\" bit, where you put things up and then babies come out, nine months later. Although you can put all sorts of things up there.\n\nAnd then the vulva is the outside bits \u2014 so it's what you see on the external genitalia.\n\nWhat we found is that very few people know the word \"vulva.\"\n\nSo if we were to call it the Vulva Museum, a lot of people would just kind of ignore it. They would say, \"Oh, I don't know what that is \u2014 it must not be relevant to me,\" and walk on by.\n\nAnd the people who would know what it is, well, you know, they already know a lot. So they're not really the people who need that education.\n\nDetail of art exhibited at London's Vagina Museum, which opens in October. (Charlotte Willcox/Vagina Museum)\n\nDo you think that women, as well, don't know the difference between a vulva and a vagina?\n\nOh, loads. Loads. I read a stat that one in five women in the U.K. don't know that they pee and menstruate from different holes.\n\nI think that there's a huge lack of knowledge. There was a study done by a charity called The Eve Appeal that only half of British women aged \u2014 I think it was 18 to 25, or 26 to 35 \u2014 could actually label the vagina on a diagram of internal anatomy. I mean, half.\n\nOK. So you decided to call it the Vagina Museum \u2014 that's the \"tubey\" bit, as you call it. And your first exhibit is called Muff Busters. So what can we expect from that show?\n\nSo our first exhibition is Muff Busters: Vagina Myths and How to Fight Them.\n\nAnd it's all going to be exploring those myths that we hear about so much \u2014 you know, like, if you have loads of sex, your vagina will get really loose. And you can tell if someone's a virgin by like how long their labia are.\n\nYou know, all these kind of myths that pervade this part of the anatomy. And then the exhibition will explore what these myths are, what's the truth behind them, why they persist and how we can try and fight them.\n\nAt the gates to London's Camden Market, where the Vagina Museum is set to open. (Nicole Rixon/Vagina Museum)\n\nBut if you're saying that women even are embarrassed or just not able to deal with the fact that they have these parts, and even get them examined by a doctor \u2014 if people are so shy about their anatomy, why do you think they'll go to your museum?\n\nSomething that I've really found in the past two-and-a half years that I've been doing this project is that people are desperate to talk about these kind of things. And they just do not know, like, where is a safe place to talk about it?\n\nThey feel like if they talk about it with their friends they'll be ridiculed. If they go to their doctors they'll be humiliated.\n\nAnd so, when they see the vagina museum, then suddenly these like floodgates open of, like, years and years of conversations that people have been desperate to have, and nowhere or no one, to have them with.\n\nSo I think that's why people will visit \u2014 it's because I think people are crying out for a place to talk about these issues in a safe way.\n\nInterview produced by Morgan Passi.
