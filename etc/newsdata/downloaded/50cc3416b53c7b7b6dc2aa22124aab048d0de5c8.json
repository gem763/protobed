We can do it with a deal if the EU is willing. But they should be under no illusions or misapprehensions.\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\n\"There will be no more dither or delay. On 31 October we are going to get Brexit done.\u201d\n\nBut his tough rhetoric immediately prompted accusations that he was simply trying to blame any delay on Brussels after breaking his \"do or die\" pledge to leave on time.\n\nEU chiefs claimed that the PM had not made any serious attempts to get a deal.\n\nBrussels chief negotiator Michel Barnier said: \u201cThese negotiations have been lose-lose since the beginning. We are ready for a no-deal, even if we do not want it.\"\n\nBrussels chiefs are waiting to hear whether Mr Johnson was prepared to compromise further on his Brexit plans.\n\nIf not the plans - which involve \"two borders\" in Northern Ireland to replace the so-called 'backstop' clause - are expected to be rejected formally in the next few days.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nLatvian PM Kri\u0161j\u0101nis Kari\u0146\u0161 claimed it was now \u201ca bit of a long shot\u201d to get a deal done before October 31.\n\nHe warned the UK not to offer a \"take it or leave it\" offer.\n\nMeanwhile, the Attorney General has reportedly threatened \"resignations\" if Boris Johnson refuses to write a letter asking the EU to delay Brexit.\n\nGeoffrey Cox sounded the alarm amid a furious row over whether the Prime Minister will defy the law to ram through a no-deal departure on October 31.\n\nCourt papers on Friday finally confirmed he would comply with the 'Benn Act', and send a delay letter to 27 EU leaders.\n\nYet the PM then personally intervened on Twitter to say: \"New deal or no deal - but no delay.\"\n\n(Image: via REUTERS)\n\nCabinet ministers Steve Barclay and Robert Jenrick on Sunday yet again refused to confirm the PM will send the crucial letter.\n\nShadow Attorney General Shami Chakrabarti today said the PM \"speaks with forked tongue\" by saying two different things at the same time.\n\nShe told the BBC: \"He seems to have a very casual relationship with the law. He seems to think he\u2019s above the law as the Supreme Court showed us a few weeks ago.\n\n\"He is not. No one is above the law, even a British Prime Minister.\"", "description": "Cabinet allies have been trying to win round Labour MPs in a desperate last-ditch tactic - even as the EU warns a deal looks unlikely", "authors": ["Pippa Crerar", "Dan Bloom", "Image", "Pa Wire Pa Images", "Via Reuters", "Afp Getty Images", "Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20445795.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Brexit.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
