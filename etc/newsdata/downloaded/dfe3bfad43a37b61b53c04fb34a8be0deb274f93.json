It is shameful to see Walmart succumb to the pressure of the anti-gun elites. Lines at Walmart will soon be replaced by lines at other retailers who are more supportive of America\u2019s fundamental freedoms. The truth is Walmart\u2019s actions today will not make us any safer. Rather than place the blame on the criminal, Walmart has chosen to victimize law-abiding Americans,\" the group said.\n\nDEBRA MESSING RESPONDS TO TRUMP'S TWITTER JAB WITH A CALL FOR GUN CONTROL: 'NOW THAT I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION'\n\nThe changes will reduce Walmart\u2019s market share of ammunition from around 20 percent to a range of about 6-9 percent, according to the memo. Of its nearly 5,000 U.S. stores, about half sell firearms.\n\nThe announcement comes just days after a mass shooting killed seven people in Odessa, Texas. Two other major shootings occurred last month in Dayton, Ohio, and in El Paso, Texas, where a gunman killed 22 people inside a Walmart.\n\nIn response to the shootings, Walmart also asked that customers no longer openly carry firearms into its stores or Sam\u2019s Clubs in states where \"open carry\" was permitted unless law enforcement authorized it. However, McMillon noted that the store wouldn\u2019t change its policy and approach regarding concealed-carry permits.\n\nCELEBRITIES CALL FOR GUN CONTROL AFTER TEXAS SHOOTING: 'WE HAVE A CRISIS HERE'\n\n\u201cWe encourage our nation\u2019s leaders to move forward and strengthen background checks and to remove weapons from those who have been determined to pose an imminent danger,\u201d the statement said.\n\nMcMillon said he would write letters to the White House and congressional leadership to call for \u201caction on these common sense measures.\u201d\n\nWalmart reminded customers that it has changed its policy regarding firearms sales in the past, including stopping the sale of military-style rifles such as the AR-15, raising the age limit to purchase firearms or ammunition to 21, and requiring a \u201cgreen light\u201d on background checks.\n\nMcMillon apologized to well-intentioned customers who may be inconvenienced by the new policies but said he hoped they understood the reasoning behind the decisions.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cWe will treat law-abiding customers with respect, and we will have a very non-confrontational approach,\u201d McMillon wrote in the announcement. \u201cOur priority is your safety.\u201d\n\nCompany officials also said they'll add signage to stores to notify customers of the changes.\n\nFox News' Russell Cosby and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Walmart is set to end sales of handguns in Alaska and will discontinue the sale of short-barrel rifle and handgun ammunition in stores nationwide, the super chain's president and CEO announced Tuesday afternoon.", "authors": ["Stephen Sorace"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/walmart-exterior.jpg"}
