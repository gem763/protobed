There are fewer inspectors at the Occupational Safety and Health Administration than ever before, and investigations of workplace fatalities have soared to their highest levels in a decade. Taxi drivers have been driven to financial ruin and suicide, healthcare aides work 24-hour shifts, schoolteachers in some states donate plasma and consign their clothes to survive, and undocumented workers live under threat of deportation. From July until September, a group of Kentucky coal miners camped on railroad tracks, blocking passage of $1 million worth of coal after their paychecks bounced. \u201cNo Pay We Stay,\u2019 their sign made from a cardboard box declares. Our times, as Warren implied in her speech, are not as different from Perkins\u2019 own.\n\nRead more: The Democrats\u2019 new war on Warren\n\nIn her presidential campaign, Warren is positioning herself not just as an alternative to Donald Trump, but as a problem-spotter who can change the way Americans think about the reality before their own eyes. Before her election to the Senate in Massachusetts, she led at least two significant shifts in progressive thinking: In the research she undertook as a law professor, she reframed bankruptcy as the result of bad luck amid unfavorable economic conditions, rather than of debtors\u2019 moral failings. Moreover, a basic premise of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, whose creation Warren inspired, is that the details of certain mortgage and credit-card loans aren\u2019t just fine print\u2014and instead conceal sneaky efforts to wrangle money out of consumers. In Wednesday\u2019s debate, former vice president Joe Biden tried to claim some credit for bureau, telling Warren, \u201cI went on the floor and got you votes.\u201d Warren instead attributed her legislative victory to an outpouring of popular support for the idea, declaring, \u201cI am deeply grateful to every single person who fought for it and who helped pass it into law.\u201d\n\nSome political handicappers have argued that Warren would be farthest-left candidate ever elected president. But, like Perkins, Warren is betting that, if Americans think hard about injustices that are hidden in plain sight, they\u2019ll demand that Washington take action.\n\nWarren and her team have encouraged the comparison with Perkins. On Twitter, Warren\u2019s chief campaign strategist, Joe Rospars, refers to himself as \u201ca Frances Perkins Democrat.\u201d Warren\u2019s slogan\u2014\u201cdream big, fight hard\u201d\u2014echoes Perkins admonition to Roosevelt when he wavered in his commitment to a public-works program. \u201cHe wanted to think it over,\u201d Perkins wrote in her memoirs of her years with Roosevelt. \u201cMy heart sank\u2026.I felt we must fight hard now,\u201d Perkins wrote. Woodworkers built the podium from which Warren spoke with boards taken from Perkins\u2019 ancestral home in Maine, on the Damariscotta River, to which she returned to all her life. Even Warren\u2019s refrain, \u201cI have a plan for that\u201d seems inspired by Perkins, too. Upon his election as president, Roosevelt was prepared to name her secretary of labor\u2014the first-ever female Cabinet member. She arrived at his Manhattan townhouse with a list of demands\u2014causes she had scribbled on scraps and kept in a drawer, adding up into a list of \u201cpractical possibilities.\u201d In other words, Frances Perkins had a plan. She extracted Roosevelt\u2019s commitment to follow it in exchange for her taking his Cabinet job.", "description": "Before government steps in, someone has to spot a problem\u2014and frame it as something public policy can fix.", "authors": ["Susannah Jacob", "Former Speechwriter For President Barack Obama"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/AP_5706210175/facebook.jpg?1571272415", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
