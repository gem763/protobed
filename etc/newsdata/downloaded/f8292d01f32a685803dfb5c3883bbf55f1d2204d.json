AND HOW COMMON IS IT? Under clinical guidelines in the US, parents are advised to introduce peanuts into a baby's diet 'as early as four to six months'. In the UK, parents are advised to give children crushed up peanuts from around six months, if there is no history of allergies in the family. Peanut allergies among children have tripled since 1997, according to a study by the Jaffe Food Allergy Institute at New York's Mount Sinai hospital found last year. Around one in 100 people in the UK and US has a peanut allergy. The allergy occurs when the immune system mistakenly treats three types of peanut protein (Ara h1, Ara h2 and Ara h3) as a threat, when it comes into contact with them. Their body then releases chemicals to destroy what it perceives as a dangerous invader. This rush of chemicals triggers symptoms of an allergic reaction, often within seconds. These range from an itchy mouth to anaphylactic shock, where the airways narrow, blood pressure plummets and organs start to shut down. Sufferers who have had severe reactions usually carry an EpiPen device to give themselves a shot of adrenaline if another reaction occurs. This opens up the airways and dilates blood vessels to force blood pressure back up.\n\nThe findings strengthen the theory that while immunotherapy pills can provide some protection, they do not 'cure' the allergies.\n\nImmunotherapy is the only treatment option peanut allergy patients are offered. However, most are through clinical trials because it is not yet available on the NHS.\n\nIt can be delivered in pill-form, dissolved under the tongue or applied to the skin as a patch.\n\nLead author, Dr Alexandra Santos, from King's College London and Evelina London Children's Hospital, said: 'Peanut oral immunotherapy can confer some protection to accidental exposure to peanut as a result of the so-called \"blocking antibodies\" and shown by the reduction in the reaction of allergic cells after treatment.\n\n'But if we remove these blocking antibodies we could see that the cells are still as reactive as before, confirming that the patients were still allergic and need to keep going with the POIT [immunotherapy treatment] regimen to maintain the protection.'\n\nPeanut allergy is a potentially life-threatening condition, with rates having doubled over the last two decades. It now affects around one in 50 children in the UK.\n\nThe condition is rarely outgrown and is the most common cause of food allergy deaths. There is currently no cure.\n\nJust 100mg of peanut protein can trigger a severe reaction. A single peanut kernel contains around 300mg of the protein.\n\nReactions usually cause symptoms like sneezing, itchy eyes and hives. In rare cases, they can trigger anaphylaxis.\n\nThis can be deadly, with symptoms including swelling of the throat, difficulty breathing and loss of consciousness.", "description": "King's College London scientists were able to reduce patients' sensitivity to the nut using immunotherapy pills, but they could not get rid of the allergy altogether.", "authors": ["Connor Boyd Health Reporter For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/15/18060010-0-Scientists_may_have_edged_closer_to_a_treatment_that_prevents_pe-a-4_1572363755279.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
