But as Islamic State and other extremist groups fade from the headlines, governments are trying a different tack, invoking the threat of child abuse to argue for \"lawful access\" to these devices.\n\nFacebook's privacy-focused move, announced by founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg this year, is causing particular consternation because the platform is the source of millions of tips to authorities about child abuse images every year.\n\nMr Zuckerberg, speaking on the company's weekly internal Q&A livestream on Thursday, defended the decision, saying he was \"optimistic\" Facebook would be able to identify predators even in encrypted systems by using the same tools it uses to fight election interference.\n\nMany people have applauded Facebook's push for privacy and security. Academics, experts, and privacy groups have long worried that circumventing the protections around private communications would open dangerous vulnerabilities that could make the entire internet less safe, and leave billions of users exposed to abusive surveillance.\n\nAttorney General William Barr, who also spoke at Friday's event, said the Justice Department \"would like to engage with the private sector in exploring solutions\", but he warned that time is running out because the deployment of \"warrant-proof encryption has accelerated\".\n\n\"The status quo is exceptionally dangerous, unacceptable, and only getting worse,\" he said.\n\nDaniel Castro, vice-president of the Washington-based Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, said in an interview ahead of Mr Wray's speech that government officials were framing the conversation around protecting children because it's emotionally powerful.\n\n\"In the past they've really focused on terrorism,\" he said. \"They've really switched angles on that.\"\n\nREUTERS", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Technology - [WASHINGTON] US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) director Christopher Wray said on Friday that Facebook's proposal to encrypt its popular messaging programme would turn the platform into a \"dream come true for predators and child pornographers\". .
