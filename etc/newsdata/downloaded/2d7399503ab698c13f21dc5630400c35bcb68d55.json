The tax treatment will be based on the taxpayer\u2019s residency status at the time they sell, not their use of the property or their residency status throughout the ownership period.\n\n\"The measures will require affected taxpayers to determine their cost base back to when they acquired it to correctly calculate the capital gain.\n\n\"Taxpayers are unlikely to have retained tax records for their home for the entire ownership period because the law allows people to disregard the capital gain on the sale of their homes, so the expectation is that that the capital gain would not be taxable.\"\n\nMs Jacobson said the rules relating to deceased estates and marriage breakdowns remained complex and unclear.\n\nThe Coalition will use the changes to try to convince Labor and Senate crossbenchers to support the legislation, since they had expressed serious concerns before the May election.", "description": "Redrafted changes to capital gains tax exemptions for expatriate Australians living overseas remain complicated and potentially unfair, tax experts say.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2163%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_109/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/e5276dddc5bb1a1667522ee1cc1a56d43affbfbb", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
