Earnings per share of $0.49 slightly beat analysts\u2019 average forecast of $0.47, according to FactSet.\n\nTotal third-quarter revenue was $2.4 billion, up 6.1%. But in the U.S., organic net revenue\u2014the company\u2019s preferred sales measure, which strips out currency effects and acquisitions\u2014fell 0.6%.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nNew business wins this year should help restore growth in the U.S., Interpublic\u2019s largest market, Chief Executive Michael Roth said during a call to discuss the results with analysts, citing new clients such as Levi Strauss & Co., Humana Inc., TaxAct Holdings Inc., Airbnb Inc. and Slack Technologies Inc.\n\n\u201cThe other reality of our business these days is that you don\u2019t have these big clients,\u201d Mr. Roth said. \u201cIt\u2019s more, it\u2019s a bunch of doubles and singles as opposed to home runs. But we\u2019re doing a pretty good job at that, which is why we\u2019re net new business positive and a fair amount of that is in the U.S.\u201d\n\nInterpublic, which owns agency networks including McCann Worldgroup, MullenLowe Group and IPG Mediabrands, reported an overall 1.4% increase in third-quarter organic net revenue.\n\nInternational markets delivered organic net revenue growth of 4.5%, driven by Latin America, continental Europe and Canada. Growth slowed in the U.K., Interpublic said.\n\nShares of Interpublic were up around 2.2% at $21.25 each in late-morning trade.\n\nLike other ad-agency holding companies, Interpublic is contending with its clients\u2019 changing needs. Traditional advertising has become less efficient, while growing fields such as data-driven marketing demand new skill sets and resources.\n\nTo help answer those challenges, Interpublic last fall acquired Acxiom Corp. \u2019s Marketing Solutions unit, which specializes in housing and managing consumer data, for $2.3 billion. Last month, Interpublic promoted Philippe Krakowsky, an executive closely involved with that deal, to the newly created post of chief operating officer, putting him in line to eventually succeed Mr. Roth.\n\nAnalysts are eager to understand just how much the Acxiom deal and other sizable acquisitions are helping big ad companies.\n\nInterpublic Group CEO Michael Roth Photo: IPG\n\nMr. Roth said on the call that Axciom is meeting its expectations, benefiting growth and margins. \u201cAcxiom has been part of a number of our new business wins and frankly, working with existing clients and adding value to our existing clients,\u201d he said.\n\nRival company Publicis Groupe bought Alliance Data Systems Corp. \u2019s Epsilon marketing-services business for a net purchase price of $3.95 billion in July.\n\nPublicis recently revised its 2019 guidance downward for the second time, citing cuts from some U.S. advertiser clients, soft performance by its media agencies and a continuing effort to reorganize digital agency Publicis Sapient to better compete for broader business projects.\n\nInterpublic on Tuesday confirmed its full-year target of organic growth at the high end of 2% to 3%.\n\nWrite to Nat Ives at nat.ives@wsj.com", "description": "Interpublic Group of Cos. posted a higher third-quarter profit, even as account losses late last year weighed on sales in the U.S., the advertising giant\u2019s biggest market.", "authors": ["Nat Ives", "Nat.Ives Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-119382/social", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
