Although Mr Trump unilaterally withdrew the US from the nuclear deal that his predecessor Barack Obama signed with Tehran, he is known to oppose military action in the Middle East.\n\nThe confusion over the circumstances of his exit from the administration was emphasised by the abruptness of the announcement. It came shortly before Mr Bolton was set to appear for a scheduled press conference alongside secretary of state Mike Pompeo and treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin.\n\nAt the press conference, both men said they were not surprised by the dismissal and also said they had their own disagreements with the former national security adviser. Mr Trump was \u201cwell within his rights\u201d to remove Mr Bolton from his team, Mr Pompeo added.\n\nWhite House spokesperson Hogan Gidley told reporters that Mr Bolton\u2019s \u201cpriorities and policies just don\u2019t line up with the president\u201d, adding: \u201cThere is no one issue here ... they just didn\u2019t align on many issues.\u201d\n\nMr Bolton\u2019s former deputy, Charles Kupperman, will take his role in an acting capacity.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Good riddance.\u201d\n\nWith Mr Bolton\u2019s departure, the president\u2019s national security team is reportedly currently missing a secretary and deputy secretary of homeland security, a director and deputy director of national intelligence, a national security adviser and secretaries for multiple military branches.\n\nThe ex-national security adviser seemingly began texting television news hosts immediately after Mr Trump posted his tweets. On Fox News, Brian Kilmeade said: \u201cJohn Bolton just texted me, just now, he\u2019s watching. He said, \u2018let\u2019s be clear, I resigned.\u2019\u201d", "description": "Donald Trump\u00a0has said he fired John Bolton, writing in a tweet he \u201cdisagreed strongly with many of his suggestions\u201d and adding he would announce a replacement for his hawkish national security adviser next week. \u201cI informed John Bolton last night that his services are no longer needed at the White House,\u201d the president wrote. \u201cI disagreed strongly with many of his suggestions,", "authors": ["Chris Riotta"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/10/17/1169209737.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
