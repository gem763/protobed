(Eric Christian Smith/AP)\n\nThe 2019 Major League Baseball postseason is both a cord-cutter\u2019s dream and a slight puzzle. Every game is available either free over the airwaves or via an online stream, although the games bounce around from network to network. Here\u2019s a guide for consuming as much cable-free playoff baseball as possible.\n\n(Need help figuring out if you should cut the cord? Here\u2019s an explainer of what you should consider and the hardware you need to make it happen.)\n\nThe easiest way to stream games is with \u201cauthenticated access\u201d to a television provider. In other words, if you log in to a streaming app with your cable or satellite account credentials, you can watch the action free. If you don\u2019t have a cable or satellite subscription, that\u2019s okay. Many providers allow log-ins from multiple devices, so if you have a family member or friend, they can share their password without worrying about running afoul of the law.\n\nHere are streaming options for each round of the postseason:\n\n[How the Nationals match up with the top-seeded, very scary Dodgers]\n\nDivision Series\n\nThere are a number of ways to watch these games.\n\nYou can use a third-party subscription service such as SlingTV, PlayStation Vue, YouTube TV, Hulu or others. All of these offer a basic package of channels, and you can flip through them in a cable-like guide. SlingTV is the cheapest: $25 a month for the \u201cSling Orange\u201d package, which has TBS, allowing access to the NLDS games. The other options are around $40 to $50 per month, but with more channels. You can also stream those games on TBS.com, if you have an authenticated account.\n\nThe great thing about these third-party services: They follow you around. Download the mobile apps and watch on your phone or tablet or laptop (just be sure to connect to WiFi or be aware of your data plan on mobile devices). And, once you decide you no longer need the service, cancel your subscription.\n\nFor the ALDS, things start getting tricky. Fox Sports 1 is Fox\u2019s sports network, a challenge to ESPN. If you watched any of the Women\u2019s World Cup this summer, you probably watched some matches on FS1. That station is not available in a stand-alone app, so you\u2019ll need a third-party subscription for access. On SlingTV, you\u2019d want the \u201cSling Blue\u201d package for $25 a month, although a current dispute has taken FS1 off Sling packages. On the other services, which range in cost from $40 to $50 per month, FS1 comes standard.\n\nYou can also stream simulcasts of all postseason games on the Fox Sports app, but you\u2019ll need authenticated access. You can\u2019t purchase an independent subscription to Fox Sports.\n\n[Every MLB playoff team's fatal flaw]\n\nIf you\u2019re determined to watch the games on MLB Network, you\u2019re covered by Sling\u2019s Sports Extra (for another $10 a month) or YouTube TV. You\u2019ll need to upgrade to the $54.99 \u201cCore\u201d package on PlayStation Vue and you\u2019re out of luck on Hulu, which doesn\u2019t carry the network at all.\n\nIf you have MLB.TV, Major League Baseball\u2019s own streaming service, you\u2019ll at some point need to invest in another option. The postseason games are only available for MLB.TV subscribers with \u201cauthenticated access,\u201d meaning subscribers who also purchase participating cable or satellite services. If you\u2019re streaming solely with MLB.TV, nationally broadcast postseason games (which is every postseason game) are blacked out.\n\nYou can subscribe to Postseason.TV, MLB\u2019s subscription playoff streaming service, but you\u2019ll only have access to \u201clive alternative video feeds,\u201d and not the regular game broadcast, which is also blacked out. The archived broadcasts are available about 90 minutes after games end.\n\nDate Matchup TV Time Oct. 3 St. Louis Cardinals at Atlanta Braves TBS 5:02 p.m. Oct. 3 Washington Nationals at Los Angeles Dodgers TBS 8:37 p.m. Oct. 4 St. Louis Cardinals at Atlanta Braves TBS 4:37 p.m. Oct. 4 Washington Nationals at Los Angeles Dodgers TBS 9:37 p.m. Oct. 6 Atlanta Braves at St. Louis Cardinals TBS 4:10 p.m. Oct. 6 Los Angeles Dodgers at Washington Nationals TBS 7:45 p.m. Oct. 7 Los Angeles Dodgers at Washington Nationals* TBS TBD Oct. 7 Atlanta Braves at St. Louis Cardinals* TBS TBD Oct. 9 St. Louis Cardinals at Atlanta Braves* TBS TBD Oct. 9 Washington Nationals at Los Angeles Dodgers* TBS TBD\n\nDate Matchup TV Time Oct. 4 Tampa Bay Rays at Houston Astros FS1 2:05 p.m. Oct. 4 Minnesota Twins at New York Yankees MLB Network 7:07 p.m. Oct. 5 Minnesota Twins at New York Yankees FS1 5:07 p.m. Oct. 5 Tampa Bay Rays at Houston Astros FS1 9:07 p.m. Oct. 7 Houston Astros at Tampa Bay Rays FS1 or MLB Network TBD Oct. 7 New York Yankees at Minnesota Twins FS1 or MLB Network TBD Oct. 8 Houston Astros at Tampa Bay Rays* FS1 TBD Oct. 8 New York Yankees at Minnesota Twins* FS1 TBD Oct. 10 Tampa Bay Rays at Houston Astros* FS1 TBD Oct. 10 Minnesota Twins at New York Yankees* FS1 TBD\n\n* - if necessary; all times Eastern.\n\nLeague Championship Series\n\nIn the National League, your streaming options are once again straightforward. TBS is covering all the games, so you\u2019ll need either a third-party subscription or authenticated access to TBS.com. Done.\n\nIn the American League, things are, again, a bit more complicated. You can once again use one of the third-party streaming services to get FS1. Remember, on SlingTV, you\u2019d want the \u201cSling Blue\u201d package for $25 a month, assuming the dispute between Sling and Fox is resolved. On the other services, which range in cost from $40 to $50 per month, FS1 comes standard.\n\nBut, there\u2019s another option for the ALCS games on Fox. You can buy a digital TV antenna (yes, an antenna; if you thought those days were dead, you were wrong) that will pick up Fox\u2019s over-the-air public broadcast signal. Don\u2019t worry, this is not the kind of antenna you hang on your roof. This can sit indoors behind your TV and looks something like your old cable box. If you have company over to watch the game, they\u2019ll be none the wiser.\n\nYou can buy one of these at your local electronics store or online for anywhere from $15 to $127. There\u2019s a ton of variation in terms of capability and reliability on the market. Here are some online resources to help figure out how to set it up. The bottom line: Once you\u2019ve set up the antenna, you can connect to public channels including ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox and PBS free of charge.\n\nDate Matchup TV Oct. 11 NLCS Game 1 TBS Oct. 12 NLCS Game 2 TBS Oct. 14 NLCS Game 3 TBS Oct. 15 NLCS Game 4 TBS Oct. 16 NLCS Game 5* TBS Oct. 18 NLCS Game 6* TBS Oct. 19 NLCS Game 7* TBS\n\nDate Matchup TV Oct. 12 ALCS Game 1 FS1 or Fox Oct. 13 ALCS Game 2 FS1 or Fox Oct. 15 ALCS Game 3 FS1 or Fox Oct. 16 ALCS Game 4 FS1 or Fox Oct. 17 ALCS Game 5* FS1 or Fox Oct. 19 ALCS Game 6* FS1 or Fox Oct. 20 ALCS Game 7* FS1 or Fox\n\n* - if necessary; all times Eastern.\n\nWorld Series\n\nSeven (potentially) games to go, and there\u2019s only one option for streaming. Remember, Fox does not have a stand-alone or a-la-carte subscription service. You can only access it with a cable subscription or a third-party streaming service. Or, again, you can opt for the antenna.\n\nYouTube TV, PlayStation Vue and Hulu are your best options for streaming because Fox comes standard. You can also get Fox on \u201cSling Blue\u201d \u2014 again, assuming the dispute is resolved \u2014 but only in select markets (click here for a list).\n\nRemember, if you have access to an \u201cauthenticated account\u201d for a TV provider, you probably don\u2019t need to jump through these hoops. But for the streaming purist, this should be enough to get you through the MLB postseason.\n\nDate Matchup TV Oct. 22 World Series Game 1 Fox Oct. 23 World Series Game 2 Fox Oct. 25 World Series Game 3 Fox Oct. 26 World Series Game 4 Fox Oct. 27 World Series Game 5* Fox Oct. 29 World Series Game 6* Fox Oct. 30 World Series Game 7* Fox\n\n* - if necessary; all times Eastern.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story incorrectly said that some MLB playoff games would be streamed on B-R Live.\n\nRead more:\n\nMLB playoff bracket and schedule\n\n15 most intriguing characters of the 2019 MLB playoffs\n\nLow-budget Rays bust into postseason filled with high-priced behemoths\n\nI pulled the plug and kept my live sports.
