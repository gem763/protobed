I don\u2019t want to call them stupid on television, but there was nothing there to hide. So why Photoshop it? I have no idea.\u201d\n\nMay denied that the manipulated image was meant to bolster her environment credentials, arguing that paper cups are compostable.\n\n\u201cIt won\u2019t surprise you to know I never take a plastic drinking water bottle, I carry my own mug, I carry my own utensils on airplanes so I never take a single-use plastic item,\u201d May told reporters. \u201cSo it\u2019s bizarre that the notion of fakery should stretch to someone who doesn\u2019t fake anything.\u201d\n\nIn recent months, plastics have become an environmental touchstone in Canadian politics, after the Liberal government pledged in June to ban single-use plastics, including disposable plates and utensils, by as early as 2021. Shortly afterwards, however, Justin Trudeau was photographed in a meeting with single-use items scattered on the table, and as a result, some politicians have become wary of images that could potentially undercut their environmental credentials.\n\nHow you're recycling plastic wrong, from coffee cups to toothpaste Read more\n\nMay did, however, have advice for her team in the event they chose to manipulate another image: \u201cIf they\u2019re going to Photoshop, couldn\u2019t they do something with my face and make it look a little younger?\u201d", "description": "Image of Elizabeth May manipulated to make it seem as if she was using a reusable cup and metal straw instead of a disposable cup", "authors": ["Leyland Cecco"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9eb7e5dbdce936be222626a5cd46d414c7f5e204/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=818d46d968188951f99e98b1440cf3df", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
