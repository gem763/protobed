Meanwhile, the Dow Jones industrial average reached new, record highs four days in a row last week.\n\nOne explanation for respondents\u2019 pessimistic outlook despite the spate of encouraging economic news is the emphasis placed on the potentially catastrophic effects of sequestration by the administration and the news media.\n\nAccording to The Hill poll, a majority of voters, 56 percent, believe the sequester will hurt the U.S. economy. Perhaps surprisingly, though, a strong plurality of respondents, 46 percent, said they were not expecting the sequester cuts to have a negative impact on their personal circumstances.\n\nParty affiliation offers a partial explanation for voters\u2019 views on the country\u2019s economic condition. A full 67 percent of Republicans said the economy is worsening, versus just 26 percent of Democrats. On the flip side, just 15 percent of Republicans said the economy is improving, while 56 percent of Democrats believed this to be the case.\n\nNotably, however, respondents who identified as \u201cOther\u201d tended to agree with Republicans: 22 percent of those independent voters said the economy was getting better, while 55 percent said it was getting worse.\n\nBut since sequestration became reality, critics of the administration have claimed that Obama and his team cried wolf on the impact the cuts could have on the economy.\n\nIn the weeks before the sequester hit, Obama traversed the country, touting the message that under no circumstances should the cuts be allowed to take effect. But he and his team made several dubious claims. Obama declared that Capitol Hill janitors would receive a pay cut under sequestration, but Capitol superintendent Carlos Elias insists that is incorrect. Meanwhile, Education Secretary Arne Duncan Arne Starkey DuncanHow Democrats learned to stop worrying and love teachers Obama Education Secretary: US education system is 'top 10 in nothing' Obama Cabinet official: Trump doesn\u2019t want educated workforce MORE asserted on CBS that many teachers had received \u201cpink slips,\u201d but later walked back the statement.\n\nObama has since toned down his rhetoric, admitting that the cuts won\u2019t be \u201can apocalypse.\u201d But voters are not letting the president off easy: The Hill poll shows that a strong plurality of voters, 48 percent, said Obama and his team exaggerated the negative effects of the sequester cuts, while just 31 percent said the White House did not overplay its hand.\n\nA plurality of the American public also believes the political news media are too soft on the administration. According to the Hill Poll, a solid 46 percent of respondents said the news media are excessively sympathetic to the president, while 28 percent said the press deliberately tries to hurt Obama and just 17 percent said they offer unbiased coverage.\n\nVoters were mostly split along party lines on the question, but those who identified themselves as \u201cOther\u201d tended to agree with a strong majority of Republicans who said the news media are overly sympathetic to Obama.\n\nThese findings come as a spate of prominent national polls indicate that Obama\u2019s post-election honeymoon may be ending. Recent surveys from Gallup, Quinnipiac and CNN show that Obama\u2019s approval rating has dropped off slightly in the wake of the sequester. According to the Gallup poll, the president averaged 49 percent approval for the week ending March 3, down from 51 percent the prior week.\n\nThese results were based on a nationwide survey of 1,000 likely voters conducted on March 7 by Pulse Opinion Research.\n\nClick here to view data from The Hill Poll.", "description": "A strong plurality believe economic conditions are getting worse, with a majority fearing the sequester will add to the hurt.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "published_at": "2013-03-11"}
