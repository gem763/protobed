The store is one of the largest independent bookshops in Saskatchewan and is celebrating its 20th anniversary.\n\nWalker talked to The Next Chapter about what books are selling well at the store.\n\nBirds of Saskatchewan by Alan R. Smith, C. Stuart Houston and J. Frank Roy & Forgotten Saskatchewan by Chris Attrell\n\nThese nonfiction books are popular at McNally Robinson in Saskatoon. (Nature Saskatchewan, MacIntyre Purcell Publishing )\n\n\"In terms of sales, nonfiction has outpaced fiction in the last few years. Birds of Saskatchewan \u2014 a nonfiction book about native birds to the province \u2014 and the historical nonfiction book Forgotten Saskatchewan have been hugely popular.\"\n\nStrangers in the House is a nonfiction book by Candace Savage. (Keith Bell, Greystone Books)\n\n\"This is the latest book by Candace Savage. She tells a story about the first inhabitants of her little house in Saskatoon who were French Canadian.\n\n\"This book is fascinating because Strangers in the House tells us about parts of our history. Most of us weren't aware of about the bigotry and discrimination against French-speaking people.\"\n\nPeace and Good Order is a nonfiction book by Harold R. Johnson. (McClelland & Stewart)\n\n\"He's a hugely popular author. He's a member of the Montreal Lake Cree Nation and a graduate of Harvard Law. He worked as a defence counsel and prosecutor in the justice system for many years. In his book, Peace and Good Order, he makes a case for Indigenous justice in Canada.\n\n\"He writes about his own personal involvement in the lot of the cases and how the justice system was prosecuting people who were victims of trauma themselves.\"\n\nCaroline Walker's comments have been edited for length and clarity.", "description": "McNally Robinson Booksellers is Saskatoon's largest independent bookshop.", "authors": ["Cbc Radio"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5299481.1569605245!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/caroline-walker-from-mcnally-robinson-booksellers-on-the-best-sellers-in-her-store.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
