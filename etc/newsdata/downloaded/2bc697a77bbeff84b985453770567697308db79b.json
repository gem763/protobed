Clearbanc made waves with its \u201c20-Minute Term Sheet\u201d campaign, with a goal of backing 2,000 businesses with $1 billion in non-dilutive capital by the end of 2019. Now, Capital is launching to educate founders about the possibility of debt funding.\n\nFounded by former Draper Fisher Jurvetson (now known as Threshold Ventures) investor Blair Silverberg, Csaba Konkoly and Chris Olivares, Capital is launching today with $5 million from Future Ventures, Greycroft, Wavemaker and others. Additionally, it\u2019s raised from \u201cprominent institutional pools of capital\u201d to invest between $5 million and $25 million in promising companies, determined using \u201cThe Capital Machine.\u201d\n\nCapital\u2019s underwriting technology, dubbed The Capital Machine, determines if businesses have the growth potential necessary for an infusion of debt (by analyzing revenue and other financial considerations), then delivers term sheets within 24 hours. The expedited process cuts out the time-consuming elements of pitching venture capitalists, the company says, allowing businesses to go from zero to $5 million\u2014or more\u2014in a matter of hours.\n\nFor companies that are\u2019t ready for a debt round, or who don\u2019t meet Capital\u2019s qualification, the company is offering access to a free calculator that determines the cost of a company\u2019s capital based on their fundraising and valuation data.\n\n\u201cWe are trying to create a business that is the place that all founders go to start their fundraising process,\u201d Silverberg tells TechCrunch. \u201cWe just want entrepreneurs to understand that step one in building a balance sheet is to understand your cost of capital. Step two is you can now use that to compare your financing options. We hope we can make this process simpler and more transparent.\u201d\n\nCapital charges a 5% to 15% flat fee on its capital, investing a maximum of $50 million over time. The company has ambitions of becoming a holistic investment bank of sorts, says Silverberg, ready and willing to advise companies on fundraising possibilities and connect them with VCs for future deals.\n\nHistorically, Silverberg explains, venture capital dollars went to risky upstarts poised to disrupt a category. Today, loads of equity funding is funneled into predictable business models that could be funded entirely with non-dilutive capital: \u201cI saw what the venture process was like,\u201d Silverberg said, referencing his stint at DFJ. \u201cTech companies do not utilize debt \u2026 this is extremely expensive for founders.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a culture surrounding venture capital fundraising in Silicon Valley and beyond. One in which startups seek to become \u2018unicorns,\u2019 hoping for stories on this very sight to laud their accomplishments\u2014including the loads of venture capital dollars they\u2019ve pulled in. In reality, much of that capital is plowed into things like Facebook and Google to fuel digital ad campaigns, which is not how VC is intended to be used and can result in founders taking a company public with just a few percentage points of ownership.\n\nSolutions like Capital, Clearbanc, Lighter Capital and others, should remind entrepreneurs that venture capital isn\u2019t the only route to getting a company off the ground and can be raised in addition to venture debt.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no excuse for not knowing your cost of capital,\u201d Silverberg adds.", "description": "Capital raises $5M from Future Ventures, Greycroft and others.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-29-at-7.36.38-PM.png?w=581", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
