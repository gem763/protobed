New Zealand may have secured the bonus point before half-time, but at 34 minutes in they led by a solitary point, 10-9 after two unconverted tries from Sevu Reece and Anton Lienert-Brown.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Rugby World Cup team of round three 1/16 Team of round three From Scotland's demolition of Samoa to France's narrow escape against Tonga, who makes the team of round three? AFP via Getty Images 2/16 1. James Slipper (Australia) Ninety-three Tests had come and gone for the Wallabies loosehead, but it was 94th-time lucky for the Queensland-born prop as he finally scored his first international try in Australia\u2019s 45-10 victory over Uruguay. Getty Images 3/16 2. Mbongeni Mbonambi (South Africa) Mbonambi was excellent at the lineout, finding his jumper on every occasion, but it was his work around the pitch that really stood out in the win over Italy as he bagged himself a try in the process. PA 4/16 3. Angus Ta\u2019avao (New Zealand) The rookie All Blacks prop was thrust into the contest against Namibia early when his team were struggling to break down the African side following Nepo Laulala\u2019s yellow card, but not only did he settle straight into the match, he immediately bagged himself a try that convinced Steve Hansen to leave him on for the rest of the match. Getty Images 5/16 4. Wimpie van der Walt (Japan) The uniquely-named lock led Japan\u2019s defensive charge against Samoa and was dominant in the aerial battle with a 100 per cent lineout effort alongside James Moore, which was made all the more impressive as he didn\u2019t start either of their opening matches. AFP via Getty Images 6/16 5. Sam Whitelock (New Zealand) Captained New Zealand in the absence of Kieran Read and led by example. Whitelock bagged a try himself, didn\u2019t panic when New Zealand were clawed back in the first half and contributed well with the ball in hand. His aggression in kicking for the corner early on paid off with a 71-point return. EPA 7/16 6. Rhys Ruddock (Ireland) Ireland may have been criticised for a drab performance in their victory over Russia, but Ruddock proved the silver lining with a man-of-the-match display that could thrust him into the side for the big contests.

Sam Underhill (England) Another flanker named man of the match, Underhill was England\u2019s defensive heartbeat against Argentina, but also an emphatic carrier who helped set up George Ford\u2019s bonus point-clinching try. PA 9/16 8. Kazuki Himeno (Japan) The Japanese No 8 was one of their top performers against Samoa, carrying well and showing a deft touch with his ability to offload from the tackle. Earmarked as a real star of Japanese rugby, he looks to have real captaincy potential. AFP via Getty Images 10/16 9. Frank Lomani (Fiji) A livewire showing as the beating heart of a Flying Fijian side back at full strength and firing on all cylinders. Scored a try himself and delivered the quick ball that the Pacific Islanders crave to play their unique brand of rugby. AP 11/16 10. Jordie Barrett (New Zealand) Stepped out of the shadow of older brother Beauden to play a starring role in the demolition of Namibia. Scored a try himself but it was the in which he created Anton Lienert-Brown\u2019s score that really stood out, combining power, vision, passing ability and athletic determination to send the centre over. Getty Images 12/16 11. Semi Radradra (Fiji) The star of the side this week. When Radradra is playing his best rugby he is simply unstoppable, and so he proved last week. The Bordeaux back scored twice against Georgia and led pretty much every attacking stats list as the European side failed to shackle is delightful talent. AP 13/16 12. Anton Lienert-Brown (New Zealand) His form is keeping Sonny Bill Williams out of the Test side when New Zealand play their crunch fixtures, but on the weekend\u2019s evidence it was easy to see why. Two tries, the first an eye-catching mazy run from halfway, secures him the No 12 shirt this week, and probably for the All Blacks in the quarter-finals. Getty Images 14/16 13. Timothy Lafaele (Japan) Kicked off the performance against Samoa with their first try, starring with teammate Kotaro Matsushima to tear the Pacific Islanders apart early on and pave the way to their bonus-point victory. AFP via Getty Images 15/16 14. Cheslin Kolbe (South Africa) How do you stop him? The answer is yet to be found, with Kolbe\u2019s low centre of gravity, stunning footwork and Habana-like pace leaving team after team in knots \u2013 this time Italy \u2013 with two tries to kick-start his tally at this World Cup. AFP via Getty Images 16/16 15. Elliot Daly (England) Possibly his best performance for England in the No 15 shirt to date, Daly linked up superbly with Jonny May \u2013 who is hard done by not to make the side this week \u2013 and Anthony Watson in what was a scintillating first half for the English back three.

Getty Images\n\n\u201cWith opposition you know you should beat, players, coaches and management can get a little lost in the mental preparation, for want of a better word.\n\n\"It is not a major issue but a reminder that you have to be mentally right to perform at the level you want to perform.\"\n\nIt says a lot that Hansen identified this, even though at 24-9 up at half-time New Zealand never looked like they were going to lose the match at the Tokyo Stadium. The fact that coaches of both teams found it difficult to answer the question of whether a team like Namibia will ever be able to beat the All Blacks says everything you need to know about the gulf between these two rugby-playing nations, but that did not stop the African side threatening an upset until Hansen tore into his players.\n\n\"It was one of the better ones I've heard,\u201d said hooker Dane Coles of Hansen\u2019s team talk at half-time. \u201cAnd rightly so, to be fair. We deserved it. It was a nine or 10 out of 10. It was good, a bit old-fashioned, you don't really see that too much these days. But I think it was just what we needed to get things going.\n\n\"When that first word came out of his mouth I knew something was on.\"\n\nHansen wasn\u2019t too impressed with Coles revealing his hairdryer treatment approach, given it shows that the former policeman fully understands the danger facing his side. Since beating the Springboks in emphatic fashion, New Zealand have thrashed Canada 63-0, and Namibia 71-9. They have not conceded a try, not had to defend their line and not faced anything close to what they awaits them in the semi-finals, and even though their final game in Pool B is against an Italian side who can still qualify for the last eight, South Africa\u2019s final fixture against Canada should see Rassie Erasmus\u2019s side safely through.\n\nIt means that New Zealand risk being drastically undercooked when they reach the quarter-finals. Exactly the same happened in 2007, when the four pool matches against Italy, Portugal, Scotland and Romania provided a combined score of 309-35 in the All Blacks\u2019 favour. Upon reaching the quarter-finals, the were dumped out by France in their famous Cardiff encounter.\n\nThat\u2019s why TJ Perenara, the experienced 62-cap scrum-half, knows that Sundays first-half scare against Namibia needs resolving now, with the belief that if they can correct those mentality issues within the squad, they don\u2019t have to worry what they face in Ireland, Scotland or Japan \u2013 their three potential opponents in the last eight.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a big believer in regardless of opposition, regardless of circumstance and the context of a game, we should be competing against ourselves, both as a group and individually,\u201d Perenara said.\n\n\u201cTry to be the best me that I can be and be the best team that we can be, so regardless of the game we\u2019re playing in, if we can continue to try and strive to be better day to day, better week to week, then context becomes irrelevant because we\u2019re competing against ourselves.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s my personal opinion how you do it, you take the external pressures of the game out regardless of who you\u2019re playing. You take it away and just compete against yourself day to day.\u201d\n\nNew Zealand will not know is that is the right solution until the Saturday night on 19 October, when their quarter-final reaches its climax and Hansen\u2019s squad know if they\u2019re on for a three-peat or not.", "description": "By all accounts the second half that New Zealand\u00a0produced against Namibia was pretty special.
