It\u2019s therefore important that their packing uses resources efficiently \u2013 something Dannielle Borger, who\u2019s responsible for global packaging development in liquid detergents, knows only too well.\n\nSince joining the laundry and home care packaging team in 2010, she\u2019s overseen everything from innovative new bottle designs to how those bottles are filled when they reach the company\u2019s production lines. The packaging development department is increasingly involved in collaborative development projects, working with different research institutes, packaging suppliers and other organisations to make Henkel\u2019s product packaging even more sustainable.\n\n\u201cOnce everything was developed in-house in your own department, but nowadays we do a lot more work with external partners,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have some preferred ones, of course, with whom we cooperate a lot. But we also like to work with new innovation partners on sustainability \u2013 including a lot of startups with some special out-of-the-box ideas.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Henkel\u2019s new compact laundry detergent packaging saves 4,200 tonnes of CO2 a year in its transportation. Photograph: Carsten Behler\n\nLast year, Borger and her department led a project that aimed to improve the resource efficiency of liquid laundry detergents by introducing more concentrated versions in Europe. \u201cWe saw it as an opportunity to fully harmonise our detergent packaging portfolio, which was a very challenging job in terms of maintaining or even improving the performance that each country is used to,\u201d she says. The packaging development team wanted to make the new packaging ready for the future. E-commerce safety was key, \u201cso that when you ship something via external partners it reaches the consumer in perfect condition\u201d.\n\nUltimately, the 23 packaging formats that Henkel produced for the European market were harmonised into 12 formats. The concentrated formula of these new laundry detergents means that 50ml is sufficient for one load of laundry \u2013 rather than the 73ml needed before the redesign \u2013 even when washing at lower temperatures.\n\nHenkel claims a more compact bottle design has helped it to save approximately 3,500 tonnes of plastic a year. In addition, it has saved 4,200 tonnes of CO2 a year in the transport of these detergents, and after use the new bottles result in at least 50,000 fewer waste bins of plastic waste.\n\nTogether with Weener Plastics, Henkel also developed a new dispensing closure for the new bottle. Extensive testing resulted in a smart spout design that helps consumers to use accurate amounts of detergent, delivering clean dispensing throughout the whole bottle. The new closure includes a soft-sealing element to prevent leakage during e-commerce shipping. \u201cWhen we developed packaging a decade ago, e-commerce was not a topic we had to consider,\u201d says Borger. \u201cBut now all our packaging needs to be e-commerce ready.\u201d\n\nWhen the packaging team develop new bottle designs, they consider the potential footprint when the bottles are stacked on a pallet and factor in both in-store and online channels. \u201cIf you can put more bottles on a pallet, that\u2019s not only more economical financially, but you\u2019re also reducing your environmental impact because fewer trucks will then be driving around.\u201d\n\nSuccessfully completing a big project like the redesigned bottle doesn\u2019t mean the packaging team aren\u2019t looking for the next challenge. \u201cWe are pushing forward on all aspects of sustainability,\u201d says Borger, adding that the department\u2019s innovation managers are constantly scanning for new trends and developments that might fit with Henkel\u2019s sustainability ambitions.\n\n\u201cWe have made big strides here over the past few years,\u201d says Borger, pointing out that some softener and dishwashing bottles are now made from 100% recycled resins.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Henkel used to do all its product development in-house, but \u2018we also like to work with new innovation partners on sustainability \u2013 including a lot of startups with some special out-of-the-box ideas,\u2019 says Borger. Photograph: Carsten Behler\n\nSocial Plastic \u2013 plastic collected before it enters oceans and waterways, which provides money, goods and services for collectors in developing nations \u2013 has also been introduced into Henkel\u2019s Pro Nature range of cleaning products. Borger says the laundry and home care packaging team are keen to incorporate it into more brands too. \u201cWe would love to put more recycled material and Social Plastic into our packaging, and we have a lot of products where they would fit well,\u201d she says. However, sourcing large amounts of social and recycled plastic is currently a big challenge.\n\nLightweight contenders: how innovations in packaging are turning the tide on waste Read more\n\nWorking with packaging manufacturer Mondi, Henkel has also managed to incorporate scrap plastic into flexible laminated packaging. Other innovations include fully recyclable black plastic bottles, which use an alternative carbon-free black colourant that is recognised by the near-infrared sensors used in plastic sorting machines. Developed in collaboration with Ampacet, it was introduced for toilet cleaning products in Germany in May, with further products to follow later this year.\n\nAll these solutions aren\u2019t just good for the environment \u2013 they\u2019re what customers want too. \u201cWe\u2019re always listening to consumers and trying to adapt to their needs, and in terms of sustainability, we get a lot of feedback from them that that\u2019s the direction they want us to go in,\u201d says Borger.\n\nFind out more about Henkel\u2019s smarter packaging designs by visiting: https://www.henkel.com/sustainability/positions/packaging", "description": "Putting sustainability at the heart of Henkel\u2019s laundry and home care packaging has reduced plastic waste and CO2 emissions, says global packaging development manager Dannielle Borger", "authors": ["Duncan Jefferies"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a936f54c3ab86f556f2c91d646c89dadc868996/0_501_4290_2574/master/4290.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d06f48cf35340c17fc60268e0ae6f6fb", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
