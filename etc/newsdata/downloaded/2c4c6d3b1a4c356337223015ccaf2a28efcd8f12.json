When Turkey invaded Cyprus in 1974 following a Greece-backed military coup, the two allies came into direct conflict; in fact, Greece left NATO over it, before later rejoining. Later, the U.S. flew bombing raids on Iraq from Turkey\u2019s Incirlik Air Base during the 1990\u201391 Gulf War; in 2003, though, Turkey refused to station U.S. troops on its territory to attack Baghdad. (Other U.S. allies, namely France and Germany, also opposed the 2003 Iraq War, though France was not fully participating in NATO at the time.) As for that whole democratic-values thing, the military stepped in to run the country about every decade or so.\n\nBut by the time anti-government protests swept Arab countries in 2011, Turkey looked like a model of stability and Islamic democracy. In an interview with NATO Review in 2012 marking 60 years of Turkey being in NATO, then\u2013Turkish Defense Minister Ismet Yilmaz said that in joining the alliance, Turkey had made its direction, and its security, \u201cthe same as the West\u2019s.\u201d He went on: \u201cThis was not a decision Turkey took only in 1952. This was the consequence of Turkey supporting Western values. Let\u2019s not say Western\u2014universal values, which are democracy, human rights, and core values of human rights based on the rule of law.\u201d Turkey was even negotiating for membership in the European Union.\n\nWhich all now seems a bit rich, given that the current leader, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, a self-avowed champion of the Muslim Brotherhood, has changed the constitution, rerun elections that didn\u2019t favor his political party, and led a crackdown on journalists and political dissenters, as well as a purge of thousands suspected of involvement in a failed 2016 coup. Even on the interests front\u2014Incirlik Air Base has been central to U.S. counterterrorism efforts in the ISIS era\u2014hitches came up. The Turkish government did little to rein in ISIS fighters transiting its territory to join the battles in Iraq and Syria; some ISIS members even passed through Turkey to carry out attacks in Europe. Erdo\u011fan\u2019s government has bought Russian air defenses over vigorous American objections and in the face of sanctions threats, and as of this week, the Turkish government ditched an agreement that U.S. officials had hoped would keep the peace in northeastern Syria.\n\nRead: The Trump administration doesn\u2019t care about allies\n\n\u201cAbout 10 years ago, you couldn\u2019t swing a dead cat in Washington and not hit somebody who wouldn\u2019t say, \u2018Oh, Turkey\u2019s a great ally\u2019 \u2026 Now everyone\u2019s mad at Turkey,\u201d Cook said.\n\nHence the questions now about whether the alliance is even worth it. Senators Lindsey Graham and Chris Van Hollen are pushing bipartisan legislation to sanction Turkey over its Syria incursion; Graham has also floated suspending Turkey from NATO altogether. (There\u2019s actually no clear legislative way to do this\u2014the NATO charter doesn\u2019t contemplate kicking out members, though members can leave on their own, as Greece did over its dispute with Turkey.) France\u2019s EU-affairs minister, too, has said that NATO suspension is \u201con the table.\u201d", "description": "The alliance goes back more than 60 years\u2014and it\u2019s been decades of disappointments for both sides.", "authors": ["Kathy Gilsinan"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/RTS2QM8Y/facebook.jpg?1570813922", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
