(Oct. 11) AP, AP\n\nThe strong Santa Ana winds driving wildfires in the Los Angeles area have died down, but the major blaze that burned at least 31 homes continued to rage Saturday, keeping tens of thousands of residents from returning to their homes.\n\nThe National Weather Service said the winds, though weaker, were still expected to produce gusts up to 30 mph, creating dangerous fire conditions in the dry, wooded hills of northwest Los Angeles.\n\nThe Saddleridge fire that erupted Thursday night in the Sylmar neighborhood of Los Angeles had consumed more than 7,500 acres by Saturday and was only 19% contained.\n\nThe continued threat prompted authorities to maintain Red Flag Warnings into Saturday evening for most of the threatened Southern California areas.\n\nMeanwhile, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti and Gov. Gavin Newsom have issued emergency declarations because of the fire.\n\nWildfire prevention: California power lines spark wildfires and prompt blackouts. Why not just bury them?\n\nMore than 1,000 firefighters were trying to contain the fires driven by the dry, desert winds.\n\n\u201cAs you can imagine, the embers from the wind have been traveling a significant distance, which causes another fire to start,\u201d said Los Angeles Fire Chief Ralph Terrazas.\n\nThe cause of the fire was not immediately known, though arson investigators said a witness reported seeing sparks or flames coming from a power line near where the fire is believed to have started, said Peter Sanders, a spokesman for the Los Angeles Fire Department.\n\nThe fast-moving fire in areas near Granada Hills and Porter Ranch forced the evacuation of some 100,000 people in over 20,000 homes, according to Los Angeles Police Chief Michel Moore.\n\nCalifornia governor: PG&E's 'greed' and 'mismangement' led to widespread power cuts\n\nA 55-year-old man went into cardiac arrest and died while trying to fight the fire around his home with a garden hose, authorities said.\n\nThe second, smaller Sandalwood fire, which destroyed more than 70 mobile homes in the Calimesa area of Riverside County, 75 miles east of downtown Los Angeles, has destroyed more than 800 acres and was only 25% contained. The fire was sparked by garbage that caught fire in a trash truck.\n\nA person was killed in the Sandalwood fire, said Cal Fire spokeswoman Cathey Mattingly.\n\n#SaddleridgeFire Los Angeles County Firefighters working all out!

The Pacific Gas & Electric Co. switched it off Wednesday to prevent a repeat of the past two years when its equipment sparked deadly, destructive wildfires during windy weather.\n\nContributing: Associated Press\n\nCLOSE Los Angeles authorities say about 100,000 people have been ordered to evacuate their homes because of a wildfire on the northern edge of the city in the San Fernando Valley area.
