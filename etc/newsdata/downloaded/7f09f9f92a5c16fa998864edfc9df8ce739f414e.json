That\u2019s how I felt with a column from David Graham, who used this week\u2019s bizarre press conference from acting White House chief of staff Mike Mulvaney to make a more general point about Team Donald Trump:\n\nWho knows what acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney had in mind when he stepped to a lectern in the White House briefing room Thursday? (Not Trump\u2019s legal team, apparently.) Whatever his goal, Mulvaney delivered a succinct credo for both the Trump administration and the Trump 2020 campaign.\n\n\u201cI have news for everybody: Get over it,\u201d Mulvaney said \u2026\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to be political influence in foreign policy,\u201d Mulvaney chided reporters. \u201cThat is going to happen. Elections have consequences, and the foreign policy is going to change from the Obama administration to the Trump administration.\u201d\n\nAs Graham notes, all the furor over the immediate impact of Mulvaney\u2019s comments \u2014 which admitted a quid pro quo in Trump and his representatives\u2019 communications with Ukrainian officials \u2014 may have obscured the fact that this is generally the White House\u2019s attitude about everything strange or illegal or reckless this president does.\n\nMulvaney\u2019s comments weren\u2019t just more revealing than he intended about the specifics of the Ukraine scandal. They also distilled the guiding mantra of the Trump administration. Others have tried to coin their own phrases (one senior administration official tried to make \u201cWe\u2019re America, bitch\u201d happen, and failed), but the real Trump doctrine is \u201cGet over it.\u201d\n\nThe administration is forcing foreign governments into quid pro quos in order to assist Trump\u2019s political prospects? Get over it.\n\nIt\u2019s using the power of the presidency to financially benefit the president and his company? Get over it.\n\nIt obstructed justice and has announced its intention to do so again? Get over it.\n\nIt circumvented Congress\u2019s power of the purse to begin construction of a border wall? Get over it.\n\nIt separated children from families at the border, locking them in inhumane conditions? Get over it.\n\nThe president is evading Senate confirmation by naming \u201cacting\u201d officials to top posts? Get over it.\n\nRussia hacked the 2016 election? Get over it.\n\nThe prevailing message, in case you have missed it, is that having won the presidency in 2016 (by the skin of his teeth and enormous luck, of course, whether or not you believe Russia had something to do with it) everything he wants to do is mandated, and any resistance is an effort to overturn the election results \u2014 i.e., a \u201ccoup.\u201d This would most obviously include an impeachment effort, which is designed to end Trump\u2019s imperial reign before his full term has ended. The very unlikelihood of Trump\u2019s initial election makes it, in his mind and that of many of his supporters, even more of a wondrous thing that should dispel all criticism of the stable genius who accomplished it \u2014 and explains all objections to his conduct as sour grapes.\n\nThat there are constitutional limits on presidential powers doesn\u2019t enter into the equation \u2014 that\u2019s a technical detail of interest only to his armies of lawyers who daily do battle with \u201cactivist judges\u201d who also haven\u2019t accepted the Historic Victory of 2016. That the Democrats who control one branch of Congress, and the media who aren\u2019t part of his personal echo chamber, have their own constitutionally sanctioned role to play, doesn\u2019t enter into Trumpian calculations at all. From that perspective, of course impeachment is \u201cunconstitutional,\u201d despite the clear language of the Constitution providing for it.\n\nYou get the sense that if, despite it all, Trump is reelected next year, the four ensuing years would take this administration down a long dark path of vindictive and even more reckless behavior. And why not? If the initial \u201cmandate\u201d from the electorate is regarded as virtually unlimited, a reconfirmation of his presidency after he has fully displayed his contempt for any curbs on his power and his corrupt cronyism must surely make him a colossus bestride a supine nation that has acknowledged his greatness. I don\u2019t know if during the 2020 campaign Democrats can find a way to articulate this \u201cyou ain\u2019t seen nothing yet\u201d concern, or convince Americans that a vote for Trump is a vote for a much wilder and megalomanic president than they have previously seen. But if the 45th president survives both impeachment and 2020, and is in a position to enjoy fully the \u201cconsequences\u201d of not one but two elections, the norms he might then break are beyond imagining. And Trump critics would simply have to \u201cget over it.\u201d", "description": "It\u2019s becoming clearer that Trump and his team think voters gave him virtually unlimited powers by electing him in 2016, making any restraints\u2013even impeachment\u2013illegitimate. Democrats must make it clear how dangerous reelecting Trump would be.", "authors": ["Ed Kilgore"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/10/18/18-mulvaney.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
