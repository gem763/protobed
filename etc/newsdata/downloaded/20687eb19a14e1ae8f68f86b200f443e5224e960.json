The world\u2019s second-largest economy\u2019s third-quarter GDP growth of 6% year over year marked the slowest pace after first-quarter 1992. The economic growth rate also lagged expectations of 6.1%, per a Reuters\u2019 poll. The metric compares unfavourably with second quarter\u2019s 6.2% growth and coincides with the bottom end of the Chinese administration\u2019s target of 6-6.5% for 2019 (read: ETFs in Focus as Tariffs Hit Chinese Exports).\n\nWhat\u2019s Causing the Disappointment?\n\nTrade war tensions with the United States have been quite damaging for China\u2019s economy. Notably, China\u2019s exports to the United States fell 10.7% year over year in September in dollar terms in January-September 2019. Moreover, Chinese imports from the United States contracted 26.4% year over year. Also, China\u2019s trade surplus with the United States was $25.88 billion in September against $26.96 billion in August.\n\nOverall, China\u2019s export data for September lagged analysts\u2019 expectations. Chinese exports fell 3.2% year over year in September in comparison to analysts\u2019 expectations of a decline of 3%, per a Reuters poll. Waning demand due to slowing global economic growth, trade war tensions and \u2018front-loading\u2019 impact might have caused the drop in export levels. Meanwhile, China\u2019s import levels in September declined 8.5% year over year in comparison to analysts\u2019 expectations of a 5.2% drop. (read: Time to Buy Global Low-Volatility ETFs?).\n\nWeakening domestic and global markets have led to sluggishness in some major components of the economy like freight shipments, factory power generation, employment and entertainment spending. In fact, factory gate prices had declined the fastest in three years.\n\nDeclining investment levels can also be blamed for the disappointment. The country\u2019s fixed-asset investments rose 5.4% from January-September, in comparison to 5.5% in the first eight months. Moreover, the private sector fixed-asset investment was also disappointing, slowing from 4.9% in January-August to 4.7% in the first nine months.\n\nIs There a Silver Lining?\n\nChina\u2019s industrial output has grown 5.8% in September, beating analysts\u2019 expectations of 5%. Moreover, a rise in domestic demand drove industrial output, which saw new domestic orders in food processing, textiles and electrical machinery.\n\nThere was a 7.8% year-over-year rise in retail sales for September, in line with forecasts. The metric also compared favorably with August\u2019s retail sales growth of 7.5%.\n\nAn increase in new construction activity also led to strength in China\u2019s property investment in September. However, there was a slowdown in property transactions.\n\nETFs in Focus\n\nAgainst this backdrop, investors can keep a tab on a few China ETFs like iShares China Large-Cap ETF (TE: ) , iShares MSCI China ETF MCHI, Xtrackers Harvest CSI 300 China A-Shares ETF ASHR and Invesco Golden Dragon China ETF PGJ.\n\nFXI\n\nThis fund seeks long-term growth by tracking the investment returns, before fees and expenses, of the China 50 Index.

In this regard, Shanghai-based economist at Hwabao Trust, Nie Wen has said \u201cgiven exports are unlikely to stage a comeback and a possible slowdown in the property sector, the downward pressure on China\u2019s economy is likely to continue, with fourth-quarter economic growth expected to slip to 5.9%.\u201d\n\nWant key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?\n\nZacks\u2019 free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.
