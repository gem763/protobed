I'm your son,\" leaving the character and most viewers stunned, while others had predicted the twist after his ongoing vendetta with the character.\n\nBut it was Faith's reaction that has given the biggest hint of a huge past secret, something it seems Cain himself might not have known about.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nIt's obvious Cain didn't know about Nate, not recognising his real name Nathaniel and he was surprised by the news.\n\nCain's mother Faith, meanwhile, made it pretty clear Nate's claims were true and that she knew all about him.\n\nOn Tuesday, viewers saw her looking around her grandson's caravan and being left reeling when she found a photo of a mystery woman in his drawer.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nKeep up with all the soap news Life moves fast in soapland, so make sure you stay up to date with all the latest from your favourite soaps with our regular email newsletter.

There's also speculation Faith herself is Nate's mum in a twist.\n\nOne fan tweeted: \"Faith knew Cain had a son out there,\" as another said: \"Calling it now. Faith knew Nate's mum was expecting him but Cain didn't. Faith was involved in hiding this.\"\n\nA third tweeted: \"Why was Faith acting so sketchy is she Nate\u2019s mum or something?\"\n\nEmmerdale airs weeknights at 7pm on ITV, with an extra episode at 8pm on Thursdays.", "description": "Emmerdale viewers are convinced Faith Dingle knew she had a grandson, given her reaction to the news Nate Robinson is Cain's son", "authors": ["Charlotte Tutton", "Image", "Itv"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20708452.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Emmerdale-Nate-and-Moira.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
