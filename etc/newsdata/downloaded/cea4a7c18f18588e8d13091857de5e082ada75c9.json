It was incredibly disappointing,\u201d admitted Schmidt.\n\nHe said he felt his team was \u201ca bit flat\u201d and pointed the finger at some of the injuries his squad had suffered, meaning that the team was not settled until late in the week.\n\nHowever, he also paid tribute to the All Blacks, who were ruthless in capitalising on Irish mistakes to set up a mouthwatering semi-final with England.\n\n\u201cWe could have played really well and they might still have gone over the top of us. They were stifling they made it very hard for us to breathe,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Unbelievably upset\u2019 \u2013\n\nIt was also the 124th and last time in an Ireland shirt for captain Rory Best, who received a rousing and sustained ovation from Irish fans despite the crushing defeat.\n\nThe Ulsterman finishes his career as Ireland\u2019s third-most capped player and the most capped forward, behind only legendary centre Brian O\u2019Driscoll and fly-half Ronan O\u2019Gara.\n\nIn touching scenes after the game, the hooker led his team through a tunnel of both sets of players then brought his children onto the pitch to soak up the cheers for the final time.\n\nAsked how he felt, he replied: \u201cRight now, tired, sore, upset.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of big characters in that changing room and it\u2019s not often you get a changing room in dead silence. There were big men in tears and that\u2019s what happens when you put your heart and soul into everything,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m unbelievably upset with the thought that I\u2019ll never put on a green jersey again except to go and support,\u201d he said, his voice catching.\n\nSchmidt acknowledged that his record would be tinged with never getting past a World Cup quarter-final and stressed that his team had focused all their efforts on that, even during the Six Nations.\n\nBut he hoped that his work with Ireland \u2014 including two historic wins over the All Blacks \u2014 would be looked on favourably.\n\n\u201cI think when I get some distance to reflect, I think it\u2019s 75-odd Test matches and we\u2019ve won 75 percent of them,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere have been some incredibly good days and I don\u2019t think they get washed away by two defeats and days where we\u2019re incredibly disappointed.\u201d", "description": "Tokyo (AFP) \u2013 Departing Ireland coach Joe Schmidt said he was \u201cheartbroken\u201d at his team\u2019s humiliating 46-14 defeat against New", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/19/5d32a3_ireland-coach-joe-schmidt-is-stepping-role-departing-schmidt-heartbroken-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
