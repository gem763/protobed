The police watchdog today stood by its finding that no officers were to blame\n\nSteve Rodhouse (left), the officer who oversaw the investigation, remains in his \u00a3240,000-a-year job at the National Crime Agency. Neither he nor Det Supt Kenny McDonald (right) were questioned by the watchdog\n\nDetective Inspector Alison Hepworth (right) and Detective Sergeant Eric Sword (left) submitted written answers to questions from the watchdog which were accepted without cross examination\n\nThe watchdog's director general Michael Lockwood said: 'Did the officers involved make mistakes? Yes. Could police processes have been improved? Almost certainly. But did they deliberately exclude information to secure the warrants? Our investigation found no evidence of that.'\n\nToday's statement from the IOPC states: 'This investigation focused on the decision to apply for search warrants and the accuracy of the information provided to the court in February 2015, relating to properties linked to Lord Brittan, Mr Proctor and Lord Bramall.\n\n'The investigation found no evidence the police officers investigated had deliberately misled a district court judge, but found gaps in processes and systems, outlined in the investigation report.'\n\nIts recommendations include suggestions that search warrant applications in court could be recorded and police should balance 'belief' when allegations are made with 'objectivity' during the investigation.\n\nFormer Tory MP Harvey Proctor, who was one of those falsely accused by Beech, has branded the police watchdog's report 'a whitewash'.\n\nMr Proctor said the report was a 'pathetic attempt to excuse the police for their mistakes, incompetence and negligence by saying they acted in good faith' to maintain public confidence in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal.\n\n'This report shows the IOPC is worse than useless. It actually defends the police against the authoritative findings of Henriques because they wanted to boost public confidence in themselves,' he said.\n\n'The Home Secretary should remove the IOPC director general and the IOPC must be abolished and replaced by experts who are genuinely qualified to assess and to criticise police failings. We now know the police watchdog is blind,' he added.\n\nDetective Chief Inspector Diane Tudway who by reason of the passage of time 'was unable to recollect what information was available at what time'. Sir Richard Henriques (pictured in 2000) says 'no effective interrogations' were carried out during the 'flawed' inquiry by the Independent Office for Police Conduct\n\nHis lawyer, Geoffrey Robertson QC, said: 'It is a fundamental mistake for the IOPC to think that police are justified in abusing their powers in order to maintain public confidence in themselves - that is an improper motive and it is outrageous that the IOPC should think it is a valid excuse for accusing innocent men of heinous crimes or misleading a judge to obtain a search warrant for their homes.'\n\nWriting in the Daily Mail, Sir Richard expressed concern over the watchdog's 'lack of knowledge of criminal procedure' and called on Home Secretary Priti Patel to take action.\n\nHe said the IOPC investigation was 'flawed', that 'no effective interrogations' took place and that he found it 'difficult to conceive that no misconduct or criminality was involved by at least one officer'.\n\n'Whilst all five, absent any proper investigation, must be presumed innocent, the responsibility of the IOPC was to carry out a high-quality investigation in a timely manner,' he wrote.\n\n'The delay in reaching their findings of almost three years is gross and inexcusable, and goes some way to inhibiting any further investigation. The investigative process itself was minimal, unprofessional and the decision-making was flawed.'\n\nFormer Tory MP Harvey Proctor branded the IOPC report into the officer 'a whitewash'\n\nSir Richard said the two most senior officers among the five investigated - Deputy Assistant Commissioner Steve Rodhouse and Detective Superintendent Kenny McDonald - had not been asked 'a single question in interview ... written answers having been accepted without questioning'.\n\nBoth Detective Inspector Alison Hepworth and Detective Sergeant Eric Sword submitted written answers to questions which were accepted with no cross examination.\n\nThe only officer to be questioned face to face was Detective Chief Inspector Diane Tudway who by reason of the passage of time 'was unable to recollect what information was available at what time'.\n\nWatchdog's 16 recommendations to police forces in the wake of the Operation Midland disaster Despite clearing individual officers of any blame, the IOPC did make the following recommendations on police warrant applications. 1) Warrant requests by the police should be 'consistently completed to a high standard'. 2) The National Police Chiefs' Council and College of Policing should ensure officer know how best to apply for warrants. 3) Courts should consider making an audio recording of warrant application hearings. 4) The Criminal Procedure Rule Committee should include notes on search warrants. 5 and 7) The Met should remind staff of their duty of disclosure when applying for search warrants. 6) The Home Office's Police and Criminal Evidence (PACE) Strategy Board should ammed its code to emphasise disclosure when applying for search warrants. 8) The next review of PACE should consider rules around search warrants. 9) The Met should consider potential conflicts of interest in who carries out searches. 10) The Met should define the benefits of its IT system 'HOLMES'. 11) The Met should consider how it can best reinforce good-quality document management. 12) The Met should seek undertake regular periodic reviews of investigations to ensure they are being conducted properly. 13) Police forces need to balance 'the culture of belief at the time an allegation is recorded with the clear need to objectively investigate the allegations thereafter'. 14) Police forces should take care when considering whether a suspect can or should be identified by information they put out. 15) Police should 'ensure that a fair and balanced summary of the reasons for taking no further action is put out into the public domain'. 16) Suspects should receive 'regular open and candid communication' from the police during investigations.\n\nLamentable. Inadequate. Inexcusable: SIR RICHARD HENRIQUES blasts the police watchdog who ruled not ONE officer should be punished over the scandal\n\nRichard Henriques pictured in 2000\n\nBy Sir Richard Henriques\n\nIn July, this judge made the bombshell claim that detectives broke the law while probing false claims of VIP sex abuse. Today, he blasts the police watchdog whoe ruled not ONE officer should be punished over the scandal...\n\nThe tardy publication of the Independent Office for Police Conduct report exonerating all five officers involved in the application for search warrants at the homes of Lord Bramall, Lady Brittan and Harvey Proctor should give rise to the most serious public disquiet.\n\nWhilst all five, absent any proper investigation, must be presumed innocent, the responsibility of the IOPC was to carry out a high quality investigation in a timely manner.\n\nThe delay in reaching their findings of almost three years is gross and inexcusable and goes some way to inhibiting any further investigation.\n\nThe investigative process itself was minimal, unprofessional and the decision-making was flawed. The complaint was referred by the then Met commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, at my request, to the police watchdog, then named the IPCC, in November 2016.\n\nI had concluded the search warrants had been obtained unlawfully and I called for a vigorous investigation into the decision to apply for them.\n\nNo such vigorous investigation has taken place. Neither Deputy Assistant Commissioner Steve Rodhouse nor Detective Superintendent Kenny McDonald have been asked a single question in interview as \u2018subjects\u2019 (potential suspects) \u2013 written answers having been accepted without questioning.\n\nBoth were exonerated within four months and were later interviewed as potential witnesses against the more junior officers.\n\nThe complaint was referred by the then Met commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe\n\nA decision was taken to investigate all five officers for misconduct as opposed to gross misconduct or criminal conduct, notwithstanding the fact that false documentation had been placed before a district judge on oath, in order to obtain the warrants.\n\nTheir source, Carl Beech, was described as having remained consistent \u2018and he is felt to be a credible witness who is telling the truth\u2019.\n\nBut he had not remained consistent and officers failed to disclose seven factors that undermined his credibility.\n\nThe investigation of the three more junior officers proceeded so slowly that all of them had retired by the time any decision was reached. Had disciplinary measures been ordered they could no longer have been imposed.\n\nDAC Rodhouse (pictured) and DCI Tudway in particular had numerous difficult questions to answer. In the context of these facts it is crucial to observe the presumption of innocence\n\nBoth Detective Inspector Alison Hepworth and Detective Sergeant Eric Sword submitted written answers to questions which were accepted with no cross examination.\n\nThe only officer to be questioned face to face was Detective Chief Inspector Diane Tudway who by reason of the passage of time \u2018was unable to recollect what information was available at what time\u2019.\n\nNo attempt was made to establish what material was available to each officer. This could have been simply achieved by reference to available logs and other documentation. It follows that no effective interrogation of any officer was carried out.\n\nHaving agreed with Sir Bernard on October 31, 2016, that this matter should be investigated by the IPCC, I anticipated contact from a senior watchdog official in the early stages of its inquiry, to question me in detail about my concerns over the officers\u2019 conduct.\n\nI was not contacted until July 2018 \u2013 20 months later \u2013 when the \u2018lead investigator\u2019 asked me to make a statement by telephone.\n\nShe informed me she had no legal training, was not fully aware of the process for obtaining warrants and initial attempts to create a statement failed. I agreed to write my own statement and submitted it electronically.\n\nI was shocked to learn that the two most senior officers in Operation Midland \u2013 DAC Rodhouse and DSU McDonald \u2013 had been exonerated more than a year earlier and that \u2018mere misconduct\u2019 was being investigated in preference to gross misconduct or criminal misconduct.\n\nIn the final paragraph of my report on Operation Midland I wrote: \u2018At the conclusion of my interview with the officers on 16/17 August 2016, I formed the view that notwithstanding the many mistakes I have enumerated above (43), the officers had conducted the investigation in a conscientious manner and with propriety and honesty.\u2019\n\nIt appears that the IOPC used these words to justify their findings exculpating all five officers.\n\nDAC Rodhouse\u2019s immediate superiors, then Assistant Commissioner Cressida Dick (pictured in August as No 10 Downing Street) and her successor Patricia Gallan, should have been interviewed about their roles in the investigation, the briefings they received and their responses\n\nIn the preceding paragraphs I had called for a vigorous investigation to be conducted by those with appropriate investigative powers. Prior to any such investigation the officers were presumed to be innocent. Such presumption may or may not have survived a full and proper investigation.\n\nNo \u2018subject\u2019 is to be tried for misconduct or criminal conduct without proper investigation. My concluding observation should not have been used as a basis for failing to carry out a high quality and timely investigation.\n\nI did not have the authority to carry out any disciplinary investigation myself. Written responses from four of the officers should have been tested by cross examination. All five officers should have been interviewed and cross examined.\n\nJunior officers should have been interviewed before the senior officers were exonerated.\n\nCarl Beech in court last year\n\nThere is no justification for the officer in charge of Operation Midland, DAC Rodhouse, to have been exonerated after four months, more than two years before the junior officers were cleared.\n\nOther Midland officers should have been interviewed. Emails between officers should have been examined.\n\nDAC Rodhouse\u2019s immediate superiors, then Assistant Commissioner Cressida Dick and her successor Patricia Gallan, should have been interviewed about their roles in the investigation, the briefings they received and their responses.\n\nDAC Rodhouse and DCI Tudway in particular had numerous difficult questions to answer. In the context of these facts it is crucial to observe the presumption of innocence.\n\nIt is possible that senior officers delegated the drafting, reviewing and presentation of the search warrant applications to fully informed junior officers who were responsible for the errors.\n\nIt is also possible the senior officers knew full well that no judge would grant the applications if they were accurately drafted setting out the undermining factors \u2013 and that junior officers with incomplete knowledge of the operation were deployed to make the applications.\n\nClose examination of logs, minutes from office meetings, policy files, weekly briefings, \u2018Gold Group\u2019 minutes, and emails would have resolved such issues and still could. I readily conclude that one or more of the five officers may not have committed misconduct in the application for warrants.\n\nHowever I find it difficult to conceive that no misconduct or criminality was involved by at least one officer. Beech was not consistent. There were numerous undermining facts omitted from the applications.\n\nA rigorous and timely investigation \u2013 headed by a serving or retired chief constable from an outside force \u2013 would have detected the misconduct or criminality.\n\nThis has been my first contact with either the IPCC or the IOPC.\n\nWhilst I have been treated with the utmost courtesy, I have been alarmed by the lack of knowledge of relevant criminal procedure. The \u2018lead investigator\u2019 readily conceded her lack of relevant education, training and experience. She should not have been tasked with this highly-sensitive case.\n\nShe must not be made a scapegoat for failings in the IOPC under its director-general Michael Lockwood, an accountant with many years in local government.\n\nIt is a matter of profound regret that one of the most unsatisfactory and error-ridden criminal operations in history should be followed by such a lamentably slow and inadequate process.\n\nMaintenance of law and order depends upon the effective oversight of those invested with power. Who guards the guards themselves? A malfunctioning police force has not received the necessary oversight.\n\nThose acting for people shamefully and adversely affected by this chain of events need no assistance from me. The Home Secretary will wish to address these shocking failures.\n\nSir Richard Henriques neither sought nor received payment for this article.", "description": "Fantasist Carl Beech, previously known only as 'Nick',  fabricated a series of claims of rape, torture and murder by innocent, well-known names from the British military, security services and politics.", "authors": ["Richard Spillett", "Crime Correspondent For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/12/19393300-0-image-a-76_1570448385428.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
