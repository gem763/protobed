They\u2019re rallying his base and they\u2019re unifying the Republican Party in a way that only they can, by attacking this president the way that they do time and time again.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is absurd that they continue to go down this road and haven\u2019t learned anything new from it,\u201d she added. \u201cI think the big loser in all this process has to be Joe Biden. He is coming out and looking terrible and so far the only inappropriate behavior that I\u2019m seeing in this entire thing is that of Vice President [Joseph R.] Biden, in order to help his son.\u201d\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced Tuesday an impeachment inquiry into the president over allegations that he pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a phone call to investigate Mr. Biden and his son Hunter while also withholding millions of dollars in aid. Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky have denied any quid pro quo agreement and the Ukrainian president said he did not feel pressured by the U.S. president to investigate the Bidens. Mr. Trump has characterized the latest controversy as a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Mr. Trump\u2019s reelection campaign and the Republican National Committee raised more than $5 million in the 24 hours following Ms. Pelosi\u2019s announcement, a top Trump campaign official said Wednesday.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
