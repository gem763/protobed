It is not known to cause harm when ingested as a vitamin supplement or applied to the skin.\n\nIts name sounds harmless, experts said, but its molecular structure could make it hazardous when inhaled.\n\nIts oil-like properties could be associated with the kinds of respiratory symptoms that many patients have reported: cough, shortness of breath and chest pain.\n\n\"We knew from earlier testing by New York that they had found vitamin E acetate, but to have FDA talk about it from their overall testing plan, that was the most remarkable thing that we heard,\" said one official who took part in the briefing but was not authorised to speak publicly.\n\nThe FDA also told state officials Wednesday that its lab tests found nothing unusual in nicotine products that had been collected from sick patients, according to another person who took part in the call.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

As of 27 August there were 215 possible cases reported by 25 states. Additional reports of lung illnesses are under investigation, according to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, which is leading the investigation.\n\nOn Wednesday, Oregon health authorities said a middle-aged adult who died in late July of a severe respiratory illness had used an e-cigarette containing marijuana oil purchased from a legal dispensary.\n\nIt is the second death linked to vaping nationwide and the first to be linked to a product bought at a store. Illinois officials reported the first death last week, but did not specify what kind of product was used.\n\nState and federal health authorities have said they are focusing on the role of contaminants or counterfeit substances as a likely cause of vaping-related lung illnesses. Many patients have told officials and clinicians that they bought cannabis products off the street.\n\nMany of those who have fallen ill say they have vaped products containing marijuana, but some also used traditional nicotine e-cigarettes. Authorities said they are not ruling out adulterants in nicotine vaping products.\n\nAlthough the discovery of a common chemical in lab tests offers a potential lead, officials cautioned that they are a long way from understanding what exactly is making so many people sick.\n\nThe FDA analysed 12 viable nicotine samples and 18 viable THC products, state officials said. Vitamin E acetate was found in 10 of the 18 THC products.\n\n\"This was the only thing that seemed to show up in 10 of the 18 cannabis products,\" said one state official.\n\nThe results seem to confirm findings from New York State. Late last week, its lab found \"very high levels of vitamin E acetate in nearly all\" its cannabis samples tested. At least one vape product containing vitamin E acetate has been linked to each patient who submitted a product for testing, the department said.\n\n\"Vitamin E acetate is not an approved additive for New York State Medical Marijuana Programme-authorised vape samples and was not seen in the nicotine-based products that were tested. As a result, vitamin E acetate is now a key focus\" of New York's investigation, New York State Health Commissioner Howard Zucker said in a statement on Thursday.\n\nAs of Thursday, New York had received 34 reports from doctors of severe pulmonary illness among patients who ranged in age from 15 to 46 who were using at least one cannabis-containing vape product before becoming sick.\n\nThe second report of a death has emphasised the danger of this lung disease. \"It was surprising that the patient suddenly appeared without any other underlying health conditions and became ill enough to die from this syndrome,\" said Ann Thomas, a physician with the Oregon Health Authority.\n\nVaping refers to the increasingly popular practice of inhaling vapour from an e-cigarette device, which frequently involves heating a liquid that can contain nicotine, marijuana or other drugs.\n\nMystery lung illness linked to vaping reported in nearly 100 people\n\nVitamin E acetate is basically grease, said Michelle Francl, a chemistry professor at Bryn Mawr College.\n\nIts molecular structure means that \"you have to heat it up pretty hot\" for it to vaporise.\n\nIts boiling point is 363 degrees Fahrenheit, which is well above the 212 degrees F boiling point for water, and nearly four times higher than normal human body temperature.\n\nOnce the oil is heated hot enough to vaporise, it can potentially decompose, and \"now you're breathing in who-knows-what,\" Ms Francl said.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

But the lungs are very delicate.\n\nWhen extra cells enter, \"they get in the way of gas exchange\", which makes it more difficult for oxygen to get into a person's bloodstream.\n\nThe inflammation can cause liquid to accumulate in the lungs, making it difficult for someone to breathe, Ms Alexander explained.\n\nThe Washington Post", "description": "Health officials have found the same chemical in marijuana products used by people sickened by a mysterious lung illnesses linked to vaping in the US.\u00a0 The patients are in different parts of the country and have used different brands of products in recent weeks. The chemical is an oil derived from vitamin E.", "authors": ["Lena H Sun"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/02/06/13/vape-pen-explosion-death-.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
