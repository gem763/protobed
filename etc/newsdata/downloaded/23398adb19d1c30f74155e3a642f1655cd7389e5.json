Col. Alexander Vindman, ahead of his testimony in the impeachment inquiry.\n\nAs tensions escalated, Goldberg stepped in to tell the co-hosts to just \u201ctake a breath\u201d and stop talking over one another. Unfortunately for McCain, she did not heed this advice:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re starting to do that thing,\u201d Goldberg said, making a gesture with her fingers interlinked.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what that means, \u2018this thing,\u2019\u201d McCain shot back.\n\n\u201cIt means you\u2019re talking over each other,\u201d Goldberg said, prompting McCain to reply, \u201cWell, it\u2019s \u2018The View.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know what,\u201d Goldberg says, shifting in her chair, \u201cLet me tell you something about \u2018The View.\u2019\u201d\n\nGoldberg went on to school McCain on demonstrating respect toward her colleagues: \u201cThis show has always had the ability to have different points of view, which we respect around the table, and when we talk to each other, we also exhibit respect.\u201d\n\nWhen McCain continued to interrupt, Goldberg announced, \u201cWe\u2019ll be back,\u201d and cut to commercial.\n\nThe pure attitude with which Goldberg delivered her speech had viewers quaking in their seats, and it popped \u201cWhoopi\u201d onto Twitter\u2019s trending list:\n\nwhen Whoopi said \u201clet me tell you about the view\u201d I actually started to get up and run away https://t.co/YnOJXoK4EF \u2014 wikipedia \"real life is terrifying enough\" brown (@eveewing) October 30, 2019\n\nWhoopi earned her paycheck today for sure.
