But it results in intense pain in the pelvis and frequent, sudden urges to urinate \u2013 which can leave patients needing the toilet up to 60 times a day.\n\nIn some people, the lining of the bladder \u2013 the sac where urine is stored, within the pelvis \u2013 becomes inflamed, stiff, scarred or covered in ulcer-like growths.\n\nSymptoms can come and go in waves, but there is no cure. And unlike bacterial cystitis \u2013 a common infection that affects the urethra and bladder \u2013 antibiotics do not work.\n\nMany patients try multiple treatments before finally getting some relief. However, others will continue to suffer from discomfort and pain.\n\nNow, a new drug, has been recommended for use on the NHS by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence \u2013 or NICE.\n\nThe pill \u2013 first developed 40 years ago to break up blood clots \u2013 is believed to repair the damaged lining of the bladder (stock image)\n\nThe pill \u2013 first developed 40 years ago to break up blood clots \u2013 is believed to repair the damaged lining of the bladder.\n\nThis protects the delicate tissue and nerves underneath from irritating substances in the urine and prevents the onset of symptoms.\n\nPentosan polysulphate, sold under the brand name Elmiron, will be available to patients from next month. It is specifically for sufferers who have haemorrhages in the bladder, or patches of inflammation \u2013 known as Hunner\u2019s lesions \u2013 and who have not responded to standard oral treatments.\n\nNHS patients with severe symptoms are to be offered a first-of-a-kind drug that could end their distress\n\nJonathan Goddard, a consultant urologist at Leicester Royal Infirmary, who gave evidence to NICE in support of Elmiron, says: \u2018This is a chronic condition and difficult to treat. Elmiron is effective and well-tolerated, and should be an available option.\u2019\n\nMost people are first affected by bladder pain syndrome in their 30s or 40s but only ten per cent of sufferers \u2013 roughly 40,000 patients \u2013 go to their doctor for help.\n\nPenny Grimwood, 72, from Guildford in Surrey, was first diagnosed with interstitial cystitis in 2012, after two years of severe bladder pain.\n\nAbout a year later, doctors realised she had Hunner\u2019s lesions on the wall of her bladder.\n\n\u2018The best way of describing it is if you squeeze lemon juice into an open cut,\u2019 she said. \u2018With a cut you can wash away the cause, but when it\u2019s inside of you and in several places in your bladder there is no relief.\u2019 Penny was referred to a specialist at Leciester Royal Infirmary \u2013 about 30 miles from her home at the time \u2013 who had permission to prescribe Elmiron. She noticed a reduction in pain \u2013 helped further by the surgical removal of the ulcers.\n\n\u2018I still have to be careful what I eat and drink \u2013 as acid can irritate the bladder,\u2019 she says. \u2018But my life has become so much more bearable.\u2019\n\nNICE was unable to recommend Elmiron for use on the NHS earlier this year \u2013 but has since struck a deal with the manufacturer which makes it cost-effective.", "description": "As many as 400,000 people in the UK are thought to have bladder pain syndrome - also known as interstitial cystitis.
