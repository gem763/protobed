But the proliferation of associated jihadist groups in Afghanistan, Yemen, Syria and elsewhere has underscored its continuing potency.\n\nIn 2017, Hamza was placed on the US terror blacklist, seen as a potent future figurehead for the group then led by Ayman al-Zawahiri.\n\nClarke said the younger bin Laden's death might open the way for the rise in Al-Qaeda of younger and even more radical leaders.\n\n\"The unknown actually is what's more dangerous,\" he said.\n\nJust this week, Al-Qaeda's small Syrian affiliate Hurras al-Din released a message calling the group \"a producer of leaders\" and saying it is used to overcoming the loss of its chiefs, Mendelsohn pointed out.\n\n\"The reality is that while Hamza was being groomed as a potential replacement for al-Zawahiri, the group could never focus on grooming only one potential heir,\" he said.\n\n\"They cannot predict who will actually be alive when al-Zawahiri departs the scene.\"", "description": "US President Donald Trump on Saturday confirmed that Hamza bin Laden, the son and designated heir of Al-Qaeda founder Osama bin Laden, was killed in a counter-terrorism operation in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
