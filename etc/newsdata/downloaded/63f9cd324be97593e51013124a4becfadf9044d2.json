Barclay initially told peers: \"We\u2019ve said in terms of [trade] from NI to GB that it will be frictionless and so there wouldn\u2019t be [declaration forms].\"\n\nBarclay's admission reveals that trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland would be subject to new paperwork under the terms of Johnson's Brexit deal.\n\nAccording to the European Commission, exit summary declarations are required when goods leave the EU\u2019s customs territory, but regular customs declarations are not required. An example is when goods are moved between two EU countries via the territory of a non-EU state \u2014 for example, items that are transported over land from Slovenia via Serbia and Albania to Greece.\n\nThe Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party refused to back the Brexit deal last week because it says it cannot accept divergence between rules in Northern Ireland and Great Britain.\n\nThe party's Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson tweeted: \"Clear breach of UK Government commitment in Joint Report of 2017 to allow unfettered access to GB market for NI businesses. How can any Conservative & Unionist MP argue this does not represent a border in the Irish Sea?!\"\n\nStewart Wood, the Labour peer who asked Barclay the question about the declarations, told POLITICO: \u201cThe Brexit secretary of state has made clear that there will be a very real commercial border between Northern Ireland and Great Britain under the government\u2019s Brexit proposal.\n\n\u201cIn conceding all firms will need to complete declarations when their goods travel to Great Britain, he has revealed that trade inside the United Kingdom will be subject to new rules and new paperwork.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe idea that NI companies can continue to have unfettered access to Britain if this deal goes through is fanciful.\u201d\n\nBarclay, the Brexit department and the DUP were all approached for comment.", "description": "Stephen Barclay corrected answers to a parliamentary committee about paperwork needed by Northern Ireland businesses after Brexit.", "authors": ["Eleni Courea", "Louise Guillot", "David M.
