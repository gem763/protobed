REUTERS/Thaier al-Sudani/File Photo\n\nVIENNA (Reuters) - The oil market is resilient and will react positively to the attack on Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil industry, U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry said on Monday, blaming the attack firmly on Iran.\n\nAn attack on Saudi Arabia that shut 5% of global crude output caused the biggest surge in oil prices since 1991, after U.S. officials blamed Iran and President Donald Trump said Washington was \u201clocked and loaded\u201d to retaliate.\n\n\u201cDespite Iran\u2019s malign efforts we are very confident that the market is resilient and will respond positively,\u201d Perry said in a speech to the International Atomic Energy Agency\u2019s General Conference, an annual meeting of its member states.\n\nHe repeated his government\u2019s position that it is prepared to tap its Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which holds about a month\u2019s worth of U.S. oil consumption, but he did say how likely it was to do so.\n\n\u201cPresident (Donald) Trump has authorised the release of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve if that is needed. And my department stands ready to respond,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe United States wholeheartedly condemns Iran\u2019s attack on Saudi Arabia and we call on other nations to do the same. This behaviour is unacceptable. It\u2019s unacceptable and they must be held responsible. Make no mistake about it. This was an attack on the global economy and the global energy market.\u201d", "description": "The oil market is resilient and will react positively to the attack on Saudi Arabia's oil industry, U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry said on Monday, blaming the attack firmly on Iran.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190916&t=2&i=1430405831&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8F0M6", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
