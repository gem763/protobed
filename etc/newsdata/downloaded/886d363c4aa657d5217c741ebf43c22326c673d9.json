Working for a Climate Perks employer means you can choose clean travel without losing out on your hard-earned leisure time.\n\n\u201cEach year you would be offered at least two paid \u2018journey days\u2019. These are for you to use to travel to and from your holiday destination without heading to the airport.\u201d\n\nThe scheme is geared in particular to families taking their holidays in Europe, with its network of high speed rail links to various holiday destinations.\n\nEmma Kemp, Campaign Manager at Possible, which launches Climate Perks next month, admits the scheme is designed to play on the Swedish notion of \u2018flygskam\u2019, or flight shame - the embarrassment increasing numbers of people now feel at admitting they are catching a plane.", "description": "It is surely the prospect of spending an entire day getting to a holiday destination rather than a few hours that has made flying the choice of travel for millions - to the clear detriment of the environment.", "authors": ["Patrick Sawer", "Senior News Reporter", "Robert Tombs", "Juliet Samuel", "Michael Deacon", "Telegraph View"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000184124846-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
