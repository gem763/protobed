Sometimes it\u2019s just better to leave well enough alone. And while that may be your first reaction when you think about Doctor Sleep, a sequel to both Stephen King and Stanley Kubrick\u2019s The Shining, check that sentiment right now. Doctor Sleep may not be \u201cnecessary,\u201d per se, but it\u2019s highly engaging and entertaining on almost every level, and that makes it absolutely worthwhile.\n\nDoctor Sleep tells the story of a grown-up Danny Torrance. You know, the young boy from The Shining whose father, Jack, went crazy with an ax in the Overlook Hotel. Stephen King wrote The Shining in 1977 and Stanley Kubrick adapted it in 1980 but, Kubrick made so many changes to the text, King was famously not a fan of the film.\n\nIn subsequent years though, two things happened: Kubrick\u2019s film got way more famous than the book it was based upon and King wrote a sequel novel, called Doctor Sleep.\n\nEnter Mike Flanagan, who wrote, edited, and directed Doctor Sleep. Flanagan (who recently had a huge hit with Netflix\u2019s The Haunting of Hill House and has a long history with horror) decided to take King\u2019s book and twist it just enough so it stays true to the source material, but also satisfies fans of the film. It\u2019s a delicate balance, to be sure, but one that absolutely works. Maybe too well.\n\nTorrance is played by Ewan McGregor and, for the first act of the film, we see that he hasn\u2019t had a great life since the whole Overlook experience.\n\nMuch like his father, Danny is now a violent alcoholic, and it\u2019s not until he hits rock bottom and moves to New Hampshire to straighten out his life that he can begin to deal with the demons that have haunted him since he was a child.\n\nMeanwhile, two other stories unfold in the film. First is that of Abra, played by newcomer Kyliegh Curran. Abra is a young girl who, like Danny, has the ability to \u201cShine.\u201d Meaning, do things with her mind. Without anyone to explain it to her, though, she\u2019s very unsure about her place in the world.\n\nThen there\u2019s Rose the Hat (Rebecca Ferguson) who leads an evil group called True Knot. They\u2019re kind of spiritual vampires who live extraordinarily long lives by feasting on the \u201csteam\u201d of people who \u201cshine.\u201d Basically, they suck the special out of them until the person dies and, in the process, live for centuries.\n\nMission Impossible\u2019s Rebecca Ferguson is the villain of Doctor Sleep and she\u2019s amazing. (Photo: Warner Bros.)\n\nOK, movie reviews should not have that much exposition. Seriously, what am I doing? But for Doctor Sleep, it\u2019s all absolutely crucial. That means, much like this review, the film takes a good long while to set everything up. And, also like this review, it gets a tiny little tedious. Information is layered on top of more information and there are so many plates spinning there\u2019s a chance everything could go horribly wrong. Thankfully, it doesn\u2019t.\n\nOnce all the pieces are set, Doctor Sleep starts to soar. Rose, Abra, and Danny\u2019s stories begin to intersect and hint at an eventual showdown.\n\nAll the while, we get to watch strong performances by McGregor, Ferguson, and Curran, as well as their supporting actors (which include the likes of Cliff Curtis, Jacob Tremblay, Bruce Greenwood, and more) keep this fantastical story grounded and relatable even as they engage in what is basically mental warfare with a supernatural twist.\n\nYes. Doctor Sleep goes there. (Photo: Warner Bros.)\n\nThe key to that, of course, is Danny. McGregor plays him as a guarded but capable, reluctant hero. Danny doesn\u2019t want to shine anymore. He doesn\u2019t want to get involved. The most he\u2019ll do is help his hospice patients peacefully pass away, hence the film\u2019s title. But once he gets wind of Abra and Rose, Danny starts to evolve, grow, and eventually face his demons head-on. It all leads to a truly magnificent third act.\n\nThe biggest difference between King and Kubrick\u2019s Shinings is the fate of the Overlook hotel itself. King\u2019s book burns it to the ground and Kubrick\u2019s film leaves it standing. Since more people know the film, Flanagan uses the Overlook as a location, and he employs every trick in the book to give fans of The Shining goosebumps the entire way.\n\nFrom borrowing Kubrick\u2019s music to his shot composition, set dressing, everything, Flanagan reinvents the hotel in a way that feels true not just to Kubrick, but this story.\n\nFrom the very beginning of the movie, Flanagan doesn\u2019t hide his intentions to crib from The Shining. The Warner Bros. logo before the film plays The Shining score and he cast actors to play the Torrance\u2019s from the original film. In these flashbacks, it becomes abundantly clear how important reconciling those events is to Danny\u2019s character development. And when it all comes to a head along with Abra and Rose? Holy shit. I get chills just thinking about it.\n\nOn the other hand, I\u2019m a sucker for that kind of nostalgia and there\u2019s absolutely an argument to be made that Flanagan relies a bit too much on Kubrick\u2019s film. Love it or hate it, you have to respect how well it works narratively.\n\nKyliegh Curran is going to be a star after Doctor Sleep. (Photo: Warner Bros.)\n\nThough if you were hoping for some big scares in this horror follow-up you may be disappointed as Doctor Sleep is never particularly scary. It\u2019s fascinating, moody as hell, and cover-your-eyes gory at times, but that pure dread you\u2019ve come to expect from the Overlook doesn\u2019t quite permeate the film as much as you\u2019d hope.\n\nThe whole thing plays more like a solid, psychological thriller than a horror movie. Which is fine, but perhaps different from Flanagan\u2019s intention.\n\nAnd yet, that disconnect may come from a positive place: Rebecca Ferguson\u2019s performance as Rose. Rose may be one of the most sinister villains King ever created and yet Ferguson plays her with such charisma and charm, it\u2019s difficult not to fall in love with her. Which dials down the scary a bit, but sucks you deeper into her web of deceit and makes her beyond evil deeds that much more shocking and rewarding.\n\nThose minor knocks aside, Doctor Sleep tells a complex, interesting story, filled with even more dynamic characters, set in a rich world that surprises as much as it strokes your nostalgia. No, it\u2019s not as strong as The Shining, but you can say that about basically every single movie ever made. Instead, Doctor Sleep carves out its own niche. One of wonder, tension, and satisfaction. We think you\u2019ll like it.\n\nDoctor Sleep opens November 7.", "description": "If remaking a classic movie is the worst idea, an unnecessary sequel is a close second.
