Morey then posted a statement saying he hoped \u201cthat those [Chinese fans] who are upset will know that offending or misunderstanding them was not my intention.\u201d\n\nThe NBA subsequently issued a statement calling Morey\u2019s comments \u201cinappropriate\u201d before backtracking and defending his right to free speech in the face of widespread public backlash.\n\nThe Chinese Basketball Association immediately cut ties with the Rockets after Morey\u2019s tweet.\n\nA manager at a Shanghai store said \u201cRockets products were hot before and when you stepped into the store, it was full of red.\u201d Now the store is filled with the colors of the Golden State Warriors, blue and yellow.\n\nMajor Chinese online retail sites including Alibaba and JD.com also removed Rockets merchandise from their platforms, and a search on the sites for sneakers with the NBA logo turned up zero results.\n\nThe NBA is said to make $4 billion in revenue in the China, and the Chinese market is also crucial to Nike\u2019s business.\n\nU.S. politicians have pilloried the NBA for what they described as the organization\u2019s capitulation to Chinese repression.\n\nCongressmen from both sides of the aisle sent a letter on Wednesday to NBA Commissioner Adam Silver stating, \u201cIt is outrageous that the Chinese Communist Party is using its economic power to suppress the speech of American inside the United States. It is also outrageous that the NBA has caved to Chinese government demands for contrition.\u201d", "description": "Managers of Nike stores in Beijing, Shanghai, and other cities received a memo from the company instructing them to remove the merchandise.", "authors": ["Zachary Evans", "Jim Geraghty", "Victor Davis Hanson", "John Mccormack", "A.
