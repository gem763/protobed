Do you justify every extra sip on the fact that you\u2019ve been for the gym, or that you\u2019ve had a hard day?\n\nIt\u2019s not uncommon for those of us who like a tipple to give ourselves reasons and excuses for borrowing happiness from tomorrow.\n\nDepending on how good you are, this \u2018one more drink\u2019 rule can be done successfully in moderation. For others, though, we can get ahead of ourselves and end up asleep on the night bus to god knows where.\n\nOur weekly series Spill It helps give our diarists some accountability over their drinking, with every drop recorded for our readers (and themselves).\n\nThis week, we spoke a PR Manager who balances her gym-going with her gin-drinking, and loves a wee prosecco.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMonday\n\nAfter a heavy Saturday night, it\u2019s a rough start to the week. My two-day hangover (hangovers post 30 are not the one, kids!) is in full force and I decide to swerve alcohol for today.\n\nUnits: 0\n\nTuesday\n\nOne booze-free day down, and I think I\u2019m on course for another, but life steps in and my friend pushes our gym sesh back a few hours and my boyfriend decided he wants a pint. So I head to the pub intent on just the one\u2026 I have a double G&T and a single chaser. Great gym prep!\n\nUnits: 2.4\n\nWednesday\n\nToday I have work meetings so expect a drink or two. I join in with everyone else and pair two beers with lunch, before heading to meet a media partner and sharing a jug of Pimms.\n\nOnce we\u2019re no longer in work-mode, me and my workmate decide to head to a cocktail bar in the evening so I down a couple of rather strong gin-based cocktails before heading to a pub and drinking two more bottles of beer. I dread the morning already\u2026\n\nUnits: 13.3\n\nThursday\n\nI get up with a bit of a fuzzy feeling, but have a busy morning at my desk before heading out to meet some clients for lunch. We get a bottle of wine for the table, but after 20 minutes and realising I\u2019m the only one whose glass has been topped up, I decide to down the table water and decline a cocktail \u2013 snaps to me. (I\u2019d predict I had two medium glasses of white).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNext up another meeting, where I share a bottle of wine between three of us, before getting on a late train and stopping by M&S for two G&T cans which I neck on the way home.\n\nBefore heading home, I swing by the pub and polish off one large glass of red, before downing the rest of a bottle of red in the cupboard. (approx 250ml).\n\nUnits: 15.2\n\nFriday\n\nBack to a normal day, I rock up late (thanks flexitime) and think about my alcohol consumption this week, knowing 4pm is beer o\u2019clock in the office. I drink three litres of water before 4pm hits, but can\u2019t turn down two cans of Rekorderlig before heading home and having an early night.\n\nUnits: 4\n\nSaturday\n\nMy first weekend at home for weeks and I\u2019m looking forward to a productive weekend. But the sun decides to make an appearance, and being September in the UK, we never know then the next sunny weekend will be.\n\nSo Spoons beer garden wins out and I end up drinking 2/3rds of a bottle of Prosecco and a pint of lager with a meal deal. Fuelled by bubbles, I pop at the shop on the way home for more Prosecco, and continue to drink a large bottle of beer from the fridge while the Prosecco chills. By the time I head to bed, the Prosecco bottle is empty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnits: 20.9\n\nSunday\n\nA day of rest, thank goodness. I take two coffees to get going, and successfully make it to 7:30pm without touching a drop. However a double g&t before bed goes down rather well.\n\nI\u2019d like to say this week was an anomaly, but I\u2019d be lying. Work meetings did change my routine, but without those, there would definitely be a post-work pub trip somewhere.\n\nI know I need to cut down, and have done for a while, but drinking is a large part of my social and work life. Besides, I\u2019ve almost convinced myself that my exercise and healthy eating habits counteract my alcohol consumption.\n\nUnits: 1.4\n\nTotal units this week: 57.2\n\nTotal units in a week recommended by the NHS: 14 units (for anybody regardless of gender).\n\nSpill It is a weekly series out every Friday.
