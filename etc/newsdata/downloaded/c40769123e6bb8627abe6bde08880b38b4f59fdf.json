Fears over Fekir\u2019s durability may have reduced his price but he was still expected to attract interest from Europe\u2019s elite after impressing in the Champions League. Instead, mid-table Real Betis lured him, in the summer\u2019s biggest shock move. At 26, Fekir is approaching his prime \u2013 and if he can help Betis break the top four, he will have handsomely repaid his fee.\n\nKasper Dolberg (forward), Ajax to Nice, \u00a318.2m\n\nAjax\u2019s team of young talents took Europe by storm last season, but Dolberg flew under the radar. The Denmark international failed to score in the Champions League and lost his place to Dusan Tadic, a revelation in the false nine role. Domestically, Dolberg was far more impressive, with 11 goals and five assists. Nice, recently taken over by UK-based company Ineos and managed by Patrick Vieira, may be the perfect place for the 21-year-old to develop. Don\u2019t be surprised if his next move comes at a far bigger price.\n\nSummer transfer window recap \u2013 every deal from Europe's top five leagues Read more\n\nMatteo Darmian (defender), Man Utd to Parma, \u00a31.3m\n\nThere are few assets that depreciate faster than a Manchester United footballer. Darmian joined Parma on deadline day for a minuscule fee \u2013 less than 2% of that paid for Harry Maguire. The full-back never really looked up to United\u2019s level but will surely improve a mid-table side, still rebuilding after financial meltdown. The 29-year-old is a versatile defender who brings World Cup, European Championship and Champions League experience back to Serie A.\n\nEfthymios Koulouris (forward), PAOK to Toulouse, \u00a33.1m\n\nLast season PAOK Salonika won the Greek title unbeaten. Koulouris was the league\u2019s top scorer with 19 goals \u2013 while on loan at another club, Atromitos. The youth product looked set to bolster the champions\u2019 options but Toulouse swooped for a player with one extraordinary scoring season (25 goals in 35 games) behind him. The 23-year-old, dubbed the \u201cGreek Benzema\u201d, has started well in France, scoring on his debut and adding a memorable counterattacking goal against Amiens.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Efthymios Koulouris has made an instant impact at Toulouse. Photograph: Pascal Pavani/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBas Dost (forward), Sporting to Eintracht Frankfurt, \u00a36.3m\n\nFrankfurt, having sold Luka Jovic to Real Madrid and S\u00e9bastien Haller to West Ham, let Ante Rebic leave for Milan on deadline day, and three players with 57 goals between them last term were gone. Adi H\u00fctter has reinvested Jovic\u2019s \u20ac60m fee to bolster all areas of his squad, with Andr\u00e9 Silva (on loan) and Dost the key attacking recruits. The Dutch forward may not be a glamour signing, but he scored 76 goals in 84 appearances in Portugal. The 30-year-old is such a natural finisher he went a calendar year scoring exclusively with his first touch.\n\nDaley Sinkgraven (defender), Ajax to Bayer Leverkusen, \u00a34.5m\n\nPart of the Ajax team that reached the Europa League final under Peter Bosz, Sinkgraven found his opportunities limited by injuries before Bosz, now Leverkusen\u2019s manager, brought him to the Bundesliga. Primarily a left-back, Sinkgraven can also play in midfield and as a winger, and completes a useful summer for the Champions League returnees, who also recruited PSG winger Moussa Diaby and Hoffenheim midfielder Nadiem Amiri at reasonable prices.\n\nVictor Osimhen (forward), Charleroi to Lille, \u00a310.8m\n\nAfter Lille\u2019s surprise second-place finish last season, Europe\u2019s big spenders began circling, with Arsenal signing Nicolas P\u00e9p\u00e9 and Rafael Le\u00e3o joining Milan. The Ligue 1 side have replenished their squad with the next wave of young talent, including Bayern outcast Renato Sanches and Turkish playmaker Yusuf Yazici. Osimhen was allowed to leave Wolfsburg last summer but a 20-goal season in Belgium with Charleroi earned him a chance in Ligue 1 \u2013 and the 20-year-old has four goals in his first four appearances.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Victor Osimhen has scored four goals in his first four Ligue 1 matches.

Bennacer didn\u2019t make the grade there and left for Empoli in 2017 \u2013 with a buy-back clause allowing Arsenal to match any bids. When Milan offered \u20ac16m after he shone at the Africa Cup of Nations with Algeria, Arsenal got their chance \u2013 and politely declined, instead paying a rumoured \u00a312m to loan Dani Ceballos for one season. Bennacer, a holding midfielder capable of creative bursts, could prove to be the latest star that got away.\n\nTomas Koubek (goalkeeper), Rennes to Augsburg, \u00a36.4m\n\nAs a Czech international keeper at Rennes, Koubek drew inevitable comparisons with Peter Cech. Although the 27-year-old has not reached those heights, his heroics helped Rennes stun PSG in this year\u2019s Coupe de France final, and drew interest from Porto. It was a surprise, then, to see Koubek shown the door weeks later, after reportedly falling out with the club\u2019s hierarchy. He has landed with Augsburg, where a safe pair of hands are urgently required \u2013 they conceded a Bundesliga-high 71 goals last season.\n\nRyan Kent (winger), Liverpool to Rangers, \u00a36.5m\n\nThe deadline-day deal for Kent is Rangers\u2019 biggest outlay since their financial collapse. Hardly a cut-price fee, then, but the 22-year-old could be crucial if Rangers are to maintain a title challenge. Kent made 43 appearances on loan last season, earning the PFA Scotland young player of the year award. His swashbuckling style earned praise from J\u00fcrgen Klopp in pre-season, but he left Liverpool minutes before the window shut.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ryan Kent has joined Rangers on a permanent deal after impressing on loan last season.
