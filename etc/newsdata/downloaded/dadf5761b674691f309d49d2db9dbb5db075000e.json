Yet everybody else was living very well, universities making a ton of money off your likeness. It is the most bankrupt model. ... \u201cIt\u2019s backwards. Someone needs to force this dictatorship to change. Because that\u2019s exactly what it is. It\u2019s no different than any country that\u2019s ran by dictators. The NCAA is a dictatorship.\u201d\n\nGreen, who played four seasons at Michigan State, has been an outspoken advocate of the bill since it hit the California Senate floor, where it passed in a 72-0 vote. He urged Newsom to sign it after it gained Senate approval in September.\n\nHe\u2019s far from the only high-profile athlete to come out in support of the law while criticizing the NCAA.\n\nDraymond Green, LeBron James and Richard Sherman all spoke critically of the NCAA in wake of SB 206 becoming law. (Getty)\n\nRichard Sherman: \u2018I hope it destroys the NCAA\u2019\n\nSan Francisco 49ers cornerback Richard Sherman, who, like Green, is rarely reticent on controversial subjects, didn\u2019t pull punches with his thoughts on the news.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cI hope it destroys the NCAA because I think it\u2019s corrupt and it\u2019s a bunch of people taking advantage of kids and doing it under a mask of fair play,\u201d Sherman said, per the San Jose Mercury News. \u201cIt's going to cripple the NCAA in a way where they start to bend, make it more fair and more of a symbiotic relationship between players and the NCAA, or it's going to destroy them in general and start a whole new way of college athletics in general, and I can respect that, too.\u201d\n\nLeBron James hosted Newsom\u2019s signing of the bill\n\nLos Angeles Lakers forward LeBron James, who skipped college to go straight to the NBA and has been a vocal advocate of the bill, hosted Newsom on his HBO show \u201cThe Shop\u201d as he signed the bill into law.\n\nI\u2019m so incredibly proud to share this moment with all of you. @gavinnewsom came to The Shop to do something that will change the lives for countless athletes who deserve it! @uninterrupted hosted the formal signing for SB 206 allowing college athletes to responsibly get paid. pic.twitter.com/NZQGg6PY9d \u2014 LeBron James (@KingJames) September 30, 2019\n\nWhy it matters to LeBron\n\nHe spoke of why it personally matters to him later Monday at Lakers practice.\n\n\"That '23' jersey would've been sold all over the place without my name on the back ...\"\n\n\n\nLeBron explains what it would've been like if he went to college, and why the Fair Pay to Play Act is personal to him.

My body would\u2019ve been on the NCAA basketball game, 2004. ... \u201cMe and my mom, we didn\u2019t have anything. We wouldn\u2019t have been able to benefit at all from it, and the university would\u2019ve been able to capitalize on everything.\u201d\n\nAnother win for Ed O\u2019Bannon\n\nEd O\u2019Bannon, a basketball star at UCLA in the early 1990s before his brief stint in the NBA, has been on the forefront of the charge for student-athlete rights, winning separate lawsuits against EA Sports for using athletes likenesses in video games and the NCAA for prohibiting players from profiting off their likenesses.\n\nHe once again took college sports leadership to task on Monday for leadership\u2019s reaction to the California law.\n\nSome of these AD's and league commissioners are hilarious to me, like the sky is going to fall now that athletes will potentially get paid while in college, off their own likeness no less.
