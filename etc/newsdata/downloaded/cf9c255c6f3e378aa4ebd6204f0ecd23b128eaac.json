Another one, \u201cMISS EDITH CAVELL COWARDLY MURDERED,\u201d upped the ante, depicting a German soldier shooting her as she lay prone. And, driving it home, a contemporary poster challenged: \u201cLATE NURSE CAVELL\u2014 SHE GAVE ALL\u2014 YOU BUY PEACE BONDS!\n\nOne hundred years ago, the civilized world, meaning the British-led Allies, were enjoying an old-fashioned, full-throated, orgy of righteous indignation. It seemed that the Germans had cold-bloodedly executed the saintly Edith Cavell, \u201cour Joan of Arc,\u201d a lovely British woman living in Belgium. Her crime: nursing British and French soldiers to health. The depictions showed this \u201cChristian martyr\u201d being shot to death, in her nursing whites\u2014with some accounts claiming the nasty Germans fired the fatal shot after she fainted. The act was so unchivalrous, so brutal, that it sold hundreds of thousands of War Bonds, er, Peace Bonds, and doubled the British army\u2019s weekly recruitment totals to ten thousand soldiers per week. This drive was essential because Britain only instituted a draft in 1916, and the bloody trench warfare was decimating the ranks.\n\nAh, for the good ole\u2019 days, when stories were so linear, and the line between good guys and bad guys was so clear. Back then, it was easier to whip ourselves into a hurricane of hatred against our enemies, secure as we were in our goodness and their evil. Alas, even then, those pesky facts journalists and historians relish uncovering often muddied the story and obscured the moralizing.", "description": "Edith Cavell is remembered as a martyr shot in her nursing whites by a German firing squad but her death was used to increase bloodshed.", "authors": ["Gil Troy"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1533,w_2727,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1492113127/articles/2016/05/01/the-saintly-nurse-executed-for-being-a-spy/160429-troy-edith-cavell-tease_rtghcr", "published_at": "2016-05-01"}
