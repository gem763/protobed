But it appears to be the vehicle by which Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her House majority have decided to begin impeachment of a sitting president of the United States.\n\nThere is a stench emanating from this episode that reveals it to be something far more sinister than the well-intentioned and patriotic move described by the acting director of the Office of National Intelligence (DNI) in his testimony before the House Intelligence Committee.\n\nThe person \u2014 more accurately, persons \u2014 behind the Aug. 12 \u201cwhistleblower\u201d complaint sent to the chairmen of both the House and Senate Intelligence committees that has fueled this drive, is not in any reasoned manner a true \u201cwhistleblower\u201d complaint.\n\nThe lead complainant reportedly is employed by the CIA, but clearly is working in cahoots with others embedded in the intelligence community who feed him or her information and corroborate his or her conclusions. Collectively, they are saboteurs; intent on bringing down a duly elected president of the United States of America.\n\nWhile these conspirators hide behind the cloak of \u201cwhistleblowers,\u201d theirs is not an effort to simply bring to light evidence of government \u201cfraud, waste or abuse.\u201d Theirs is a cleverly calculated plan, hatched over a period of at least several months, and with the assistance of outside forces, including a so-called \u201cpublic interest\u201d law firm.\n\nThe fa\u00e7ade here is one of a well-intentioned public servant bringing to the attention of the Congress and the American public \u201curgent\u201d evidence of wrongdoing \u201cwithin the intelligence community.\u201d Despite such lofty rhetoric, however, the facts and the actual language of the federal law establishing the legal guidelines by which a bona fide \u201cwhistleblower\u201d must proceed, shows that at every step of the way the whistleblower procedures were not applicable.\n\nThe starting point for this inquiry must be the \u201cIntelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act of 1998,\u201d which established the procedures according to which an employee or contractor of one of the many agencies that comprise the intelligence community, would report abuses to the congressional intelligence committees and be protected from retaliation for so doing.\n\nIn considering at the outset whether the July 25th phone call between Trump and Zelensky which so troubled the so-called whistleblower, even falls within the parameters of the 1998 law, it does not. Neither of the two presidents were engaged in discussing or carrying out anything \u201crelating to \u2026 intelligence activity involving classified information,\u201d which is the cornerstone in the law for a true whistleblower\u2019s protected reporting.\n\nIn next considering elements of the so-called whistleblower\u2019s initial complaint to Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson, we learn that Atkinson forwarded what he decided was a \u201ccredible\u201d complaint of \u201curgent concern\u201d to his boss (Acting DNI Director Joseph Maguire), without ever having read the transcript of the president-to-president phone call or listened to the recording itself.\n\nIn other words, the inspector general for the entire intelligence community determined that an individual had uncovered a matter of \u201curgent concern \u2026 involving classified information\u201d that exposed abuse \u201crelating to the funding, administration, or operation of an intelligence activity,\u201d without ever reading or listening to the supposed evidence (which happened to be hearsay to begin with)!\n\nHad Atkinson bothered to simply read the transcribed phone call between Trump and Zelensky, he would have seen it had nothing whatever to do with \u201can intelligence activity involving classified information\u201d \u2014 the actual legal cornerstone for a bona fide whistleblower complaint.\n\nIt is unclear why Maguire forwarded this complaint up the line without conducting even a cursory review of its contents to determine if it fell within the legal parameters of the law under which the so-called whistleblower purported to be acting. It also remains unclear why Maguire in the same way blindly accepted his inspector general\u2019s flawed conclusion about the so-called whistleblower under his jurisdiction. (Maguire\u2019s only apparent concern was for possible \u201cexecutive privilege\u201d material.)\n\nRegardless of why these two senior intelligence officials blundered so badly, their irresponsible actions have given unwarranted credibility to individuals within our Intelligence Community actively working to sabotage the administration of President Donald Trump.\n\nNot surprising, their work has found a receptive audience in the impeachment-hungry Democratic majority in the Congress.\n\nBob Barr (@BobBarr) represented Georgia in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1995 to 2003.
