Later on Saturday, Iranian media reported that Dehbashi Kivi had already returned to Iran.\n\nPorter would not say whether the two cases were related.\n\n\"The Australian Government does not comment on the details behind its consideration of particular cases,\" Porter said in his e-mailed statement.\n\n\"And while it is likely that because of Mr Kivi's nationality some will speculate regarding this matter, consistent with prior practice I do not intend to comment further on the particular details of this case, particularly when any such response from me may diminish our government's capacity to deal with future matters of this type in Australia's best interests.\"\n\nAccording to Australia's ABC News, the 38-year-old Dehbashi Kivi was arrested in September of 2018 on accusations of sending American equipment for stealth planes or missiles to Iran.\n\nThe United States sought to extradite him on six charges, including conspiring to export special amplifiers classified as \"defense articles\" under the US munitions list, according to ABC News.\n\nDehbashi Kivi was a doctorate student at the University of Queensland, with his lawyer saying he was working on developing a machine to detect skin cancers, according to Australian media reports.", "description": "Australia denies extradition of Iranian academic to U.S.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/world_news_3_69x52._800x533_L_1419494235.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
