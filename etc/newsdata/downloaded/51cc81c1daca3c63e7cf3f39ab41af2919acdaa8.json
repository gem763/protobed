They had the front door of the home open to let the cool breeze in, said Lee Merritt, an attorney for Jefferson\u2019s family.\n\n\u201cThey did that all night \u2014 from sunset until the time that they lost track of time \u2026 when they heard someone prowling around in the bushes,\u201d Merritt said during news conference with her family Monday.\n\n\u201cHe and his Auntie Tay experienced the fear of someone prowling in the backyard,\u201d Merritt said. \u201cHis Auntie Tay did not allow him to check the window, she checked herself.\u201d\n\nThe white Fort Worth officer, responding to a call from a neighbor who was concerned about the open door, fired a split-second after shouting at the black woman to show her hands. Police bodycam video shows the officer didn\u2019t identify himself as police.\n\nHe resigned Monday and was later charged with murder.\n\nAmber Carr said her sister, Jefferson, loved spending time with her nephews.\n\n\u201cMy sister, the relationship she has with my sons is undescribable. Sometimes people think that they are her kids and not mine,\u201d said Carr, who also has a 4-year-old son.\n\nShe said the last time she spoke to her sister was a week before she was killed.\n\n\u201cShe came to the hospital in Plano where I was recovering from a major heart surgery. She came and brought me food, she brought me a new cellphone,\u201d Carr said at the news conference.\n\nJefferson loved playing basketball and video games with the 8-year-old, but she also helped him understand he had to be responsible for getting himself ready for school each morning and wrote out a schedule so he could be organized, Carr said.\n\n\u201cShe helped him become more independent and self-sufficient,\u201d she said.\n\nJefferson grew up in the Dallas area. She graduated from Xavier University of Louisiana in 2014 with a bachelor\u2019s degree of science in biology, and her family said she worked from home selling medical equipment.\n\nAnother sister, Ashley Carr, who read from a statement prepared by the family, described Jefferson as \u201ca smart, ambitious, kind person with an adventurous spirit.\u201d She also called her a hard worker.\n\nShe was good about saving money, the family said after the news conference. They had been paying someone to cut the grass at the mother\u2019s home, but Jefferson bought a lawn mower and weed eater when she moved in and even taught her nephew how to mow.\n\nWhen Carr picked the 8-year-old up at a facility where police had taken him after Jefferson was killed, it was the boy who told his mother about the shooting.\n\nIn the days since, the child has been the one comforting his mother. Carr said she can see Jefferson\u2019s loving influence in the boy\u2019s actions.\n\n\u201cIn the middle of the night when I\u2019m crying, he wakes up and tells me to breathe in my nose and out my mouth,\u201d Carr said at the news conference. \u201cHe holds me, he hugs me.\u201d", "description": "DALLAS (AP) \u2014 Atatiana Jefferson was devoted to her family and had moved into her mother's Fort Worth home earlier this year to help as her mom's health", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/15/076703_aptopix-police-shooting-in-home-texas-61933-amber-carr-wipes-tear-as-her-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
