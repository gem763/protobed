Other options being considered include a reserve of coal generating capacity that is kept outside the NEM.\n\nWe need to recognise that coal is the wrong type of generation to firm renewables... \u2014 Frank Calabria, Origin Energy CEO\n\nMr Calabria says an incentive is likely to be required for \"firming\" generation but calls for \"the full suite\" of capacity mechanisms to be examined. It is also important that capacity markets aren't viewed as a \"panacea\", he says, noting that some, such as the UK's, have been \"plagued with issues\".\n\nHe argues that any capacity payments \"need to go hand-in-hand with a strong carbon signal, to minimise distortion in the market, deferring further investments and increasing the costs to customers\".", "description": "Origin Energy chief executive Frank Calabria has revived calls for a market mechanism in the electricity sector that combines emissions and reliability goals.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1873%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/23d18249be4ff035934d5bd049d58c403085eb7f", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
