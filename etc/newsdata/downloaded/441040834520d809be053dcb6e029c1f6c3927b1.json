The royal couple were presented with the beads among other presents from the organization Brave Foundation which helps survivors of serious physical trauma, injury, and chronic disease. The Sussexes met founder Robyne Conway and her team in the streets as residents marked the annual public holiday Heritage Day which celebrates South Africa\u2019s diversity.\n\n\u201cWe gave them one of our favorite soaps which is wild seaweed harvested from the national park that we want to build our retreat in,\u201d Robyne told T&C afterwards. \u201cWe gave them massage oils, lip balms, we gave them pure organic unbleached cotton socks.\u201d\n\nPhoto credit: Pool - Getty Images More\n\nAdditionally, Robyne shared that they gave baby Archie a set of meditation beads known as malas.\n\n\u201cWe also made them, for Archie, Meghan and Harry, little blessed arm malas,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cOur beads are made from African crystal. Then they have rudraksha seeds, and they have a bead from a temple in Ethiopia, so it\u2019s like a whole continent.\u201d\n\nHarry and Meghan received the gift from seven-year-old Sancuma Nkyomiyapi, and also spent time speaking with 11-year-old Libo.\n\n\u201cShe asked for a hug, and then I gave her a hug. And the prince also asked for a hug,\u201d Libo said afterwards. \u201cIt was wonderful. They are awesome.\u201d\n\nRobyne also spoke highly of her interaction with the couple.\n\n\u201cThey seemed very receptive and very interested,\u201d she said. \u201cThey spoke to each person individually which was amazing, nobody was really expecting that.\u201d\n\nShe also spoke a bit about the Brave Foundation.\n\n\u201cWe have people who are paraplegic, people who are quadriplegic, people who have had strokes. What we are trying to do is raise funding to build the world\u2019s first mixed ability retreat center,\u201d she explained.\n\n\u201cWe are part of the Bo Kaap and we have been here for 15 years helping a lot of people in this community, but also across Cape Town. Prince Harry [has an] interest in physical trauma and also Meghan\u2019s mum is a yoga teacher, so we thought there is a lot of synergy.\u201d\n\nPhoto credit: Chris Jackson - Getty Images More\n\nA cheer went up when the couple appeared at the street party in the vibrant neighborhood where houses are painted bright colors. After greeting the crowds, Harry and Meghan went for a cup of tea in one of the houses.\n\nJust before joining the celebrations, they had visited South Africa\u2019s oldest mosque, Auwal Mosque, to meet members of different faith groups and hear about their work promoting interfaith dialogue in Cape Town.\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "The Sussexes' son has yet to make a public appearance on the royal tour, but he was still top of mind at today's events.", "authors": ["Caroline Hallemann"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/b9LHmZw0xZ.ucAv7L4gRjQ--~B/aD01MTQ7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/town_country_721/c1dd39baedcda6b7702c883aeb1c544f", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
