Australia, New Zealand shares move higher on trade progress\n\n* Santos jumps on acquisition of some local ConocoPhillips (NYSE: ) assets\n\n* Energy firms boosted by oil price gains after Iran tanker attack\n\n* SKY Network tops NZX gainers on rugby broadcast deal\n\nBy Devika Syamnath\n\nOct 14 (Reuters) - Strength in miners and banks helped Australian shares rise for a third straight session on Monday, bolstered by signs of headway in trade talks between the world's two largest economies.\n\nThe S&P/ASX 200 index tacked on 0.8% or 54.3 points to 6,661.1 by 0055 GMT.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump on Friday outlined the first phase of a trade deal with China in a step towards patching up a tariff war that has hounded financial markets and hampered growth prospects. 'deal' represents the most material breakthrough since the trade war started, but it neither rolls back existing tariffs nor reverses the damaging spillover of tensions into technology areas,\" Stephen Innes, Asia Pacific Market Strategist at AxiTrader said in a note.\n\nChina is the biggest buyer of Australia's major resource exports and trade optimism fed into commodity players on the day, with mining stocks picking up as much as 1.2%.\n\nBut Friday's announcement did not include many details while officials on both sides said much more work needed to be done.\n\nGlobal miners BHP Group and Rio Tinto (LON: ) added up to 2.4% and 3.2%, respectively.\n\nOil prices held near their Friday levels after jumping sharply on reports of an attack on an Iranian oil tanker.\n\nRenewed geopolitical tensions in the Middle East boosted energy firms , adding as much as 2.9% to see their best intraday gain in four weeks.

The remediation costs are the bigger problem and quantifying those is a positive for the sector,\" he said, adding that focus now shifts to bank earnings at the end of the month.\n\nANZ and National Australia Bank have already reported expected remediation costs to compensate customers for past wrongdoings. New Zealand benchmark advanced as much as 1.3% and was set for its best session in nearly six weeks.\n\nSKY Network Television was the top gainer after signing a broadcast deal with some rugby unions, while Fisher & Paykel Healthcare hit a record high on upgraded guidance.", "description": "Australia, New Zealand shares move higher on trade progress", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEB5S0BT_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
