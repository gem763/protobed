Through their work, this year\u2019s Chemistry Laureates have laid the foundation of a wireless, fossil fuel-free society.#NobelPrize pic.twitter.com/KXVfXlUT4B \u2014 The Nobel Prize (@NobelPrize) October 9, 2019\n\nThe batteries in their larger forms have been used to power electric cars, while smaller versions have been used for portable devices such as cardiac defibrillators, according to the Times. Akira Yoshino, M. Stanley Whittingham and John Goodenough will share the prize. Goodenough, 97, is the oldest-ever Nobel winner.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe batteries were developed as a result of the trio\u2019s work in the 1970s and 1980s, and were instrumental to the development of lightweight, rechargeable batteries used for technology such as laptops and smartphones, according to The New York Times, as well as contributing to the development of renewable energy.\n\nWhittingham developed the first functional lithium battery in the 1970s, while Goodenough improved upon the design by discovering cobalt oxide could produce a higher voltage, while Yoshino eliminated pure lithium from the battery and replaced it with more stable lithium ions.\n\nYoshino went on to create the first commercially viable lithium-ion battery for the Asahi Kasei Corporation.\n\nYoshino told reporters the news was \u201camazing\u201d and \u201csurprising\u201d and that he was particularly pleased at his research\u2019s potential to combat climate change.\n\n\u201cClimate change is a very serious issue for humankind,\u201d he said, according to the Times, and called the batteries \u201csuitable for a sustainable society.\u201d\n\n\u201cLithium-ion batteries are a great example of how chemistry can transform peoples\u2019 lives,\u201d Bonnie Charpentier, president of the American Chemical Society, told the Times. \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful to see this work recognized by the Nobel Prize.\u201d", "description": "Three scientists will share the 2019 Nobel Prize in chemistry for their work developing lithium-ion batteries, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced Wednesday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/nobel.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
