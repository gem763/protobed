The IMF has forecast a fiscal deficit of 9.8% of GDP this year and 11.5% next year.\n\nPrime Minister Saad al-Hariri said the emergency measures introduced last week \u2013 which included the symbolic halving of the salaries of ministers and lawmakers \u2013 might not meet the protesters' demands but were a start towards achieving some of them.\n\n\"Fundamental reforms are urgently needed in Lebanon in order to restore macro-economic stability, bring confidence back, stimulate growth and provide some solutions to the issues that were raised by the street,\" IMF's Azour said.\n\nThe Lebanese government is planning to accelerate a long-delayed reform of the state-run power sector, which drains $2 billion from the treasury per year while failing to deliver enough power for Lebanese.\n\nAzour said that to restore confidence in the economy some of the long-awaited reforms in the energy and telecom sectors must be \"clearly implemented with a very articulate timetable.\"\n\nHe said the fund was in regular discussions with the Lebanese authorities but that they had not asked the IMF to provide programme funding.\n\n(Editing by Deepa Babington)", "description": "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) said it is assessing an emergency reform package announced by Lebanon's government last week and stressed reforms should be implemented urgently given the country's high debt levels and fiscal deficits.
