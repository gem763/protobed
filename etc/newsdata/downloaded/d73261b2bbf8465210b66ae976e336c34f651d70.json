Mr. Linick, who was not believed to be investigating the Ukraine matter himself, contacted lawmakers early Tuesday afternoon and extended a cryptic and urgent invitation to meet the next day \u201cto discuss and provide staff with copies of documents,\u201d according to an invitation reviewed by The New York Times.\n\nThe invitation noted only that the documents had been shared with Mr. Linick by the State Department\u2019s acting legal adviser.\n\nInspectors general frequently share information with Congress, but lawmakers and other government officials familiar with the process said Mr. Linick\u2019s request was highly unusual, particularly given the extraordinary political pressure surrounding the State Department and Ukraine.\n\nThe draft subpoena circulated by Mr. Cummings, in conjunction with the House Intelligence and Foreign Affairs committees, reads like a dragnet of potential records related to the Ukraine matter and is all but certain to touch off a battle with a White House that has a long history of refusing to comply with congressional requests of this nature.\n\nIt also explicitly asks for records that could indicate whether the White House or other administration officials took steps to conceal or destroy the records to prevent Congress or the public from learning what had happened.\n\nAmong the records requested are any recordings, transcripts, notes or other records related to a July phone call in which Mr. Trump pressed President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine to conduct investigations that would bolster the American leader politically, or an earlier April call between the two men. It asks for a full list of White House staff members involved or aware of the calls, any communications that reference the July call and details about how the White House maintained records of the call.\n\nThe draft subpoena also commands the White House to hand over records of any calls with other foreign leaders referring to the topics Mr. Trump discussed with Mr. Zelensky; records of meetings related to Ukraine; and the decision to temporarily withhold $391 million in security aid from the country this summer at the same time Mr. Trump was pressing Mr. Zelensky.", "description": "\u201cI do not take this step lightly,\u201d said Representative Elijah E.
