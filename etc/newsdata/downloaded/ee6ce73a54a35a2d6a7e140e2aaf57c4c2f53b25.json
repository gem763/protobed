The wider Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index, which tracks the largest digital currencies, advanced to a five-week high on Monday.\n\nThe latest leg of the rally cropped up after China\u2019s President Xi Jinping said Beijing will increase investment in blockchain technology. An official with China\u2019s central bank also said blockchain technology can help with commercial banks\u2019 risk control and ease borrowing difficulties for smaller businesses.\n\nInvestors snapped up blockchain-related stocks on Monday, with more than 60 tech shares surging by the daily limit in Shanghai and Shenzhen. Even equities with more tenuous connections to blockchain, such as baby-food producer Beingmate Co. and selfie-app developer Meitu Inc., got a boost from the news. Hong Kong\u2019s BC Technology Group Ltd., which operates a crypto exchange, jumped the most since May.\n\nBitcoin traded at US$9,424 as of 9:59 a.m. London time, up 9.9 per cent from Friday\u2019s close, according to Bloomberg consolidated pricing.\n\nBloomberg.com", "description": "China's President Xi Jinping said Beijing will increase investment in blockchain technology", "authors": ["Eric Lam", "Bloomberg News"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/china-bitcoin.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
