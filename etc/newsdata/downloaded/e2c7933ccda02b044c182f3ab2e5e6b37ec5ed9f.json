Friends of Grandos set up a GoFundMe page with the help of her twin sister, Rosie Grandos, to help create a memorial fund. \u201cI had the privilege to work with Mary before she started her career at USPS,\u201d a friend wrote. \u201cShe was beautiful inside and out, with a great heart and always ready to be a friend, always had a smile on her face!\u201d\n\nHer sister, with whom she lived, told CNN she was on the phone with Mary when she was killed. \"It was very painful,\u201d Rosie Granados said. \u201cI just wanted to help her and I couldn\u2019t. I thought she had got bit by a dog or something. I tried calling her name and she wouldn't answer.\u201d She knew her sister\u2019s mail route and got in her car and eventually found her.\n\nAlong with three police officers, the injured included 17-month-old Anderson Davis, who was shot in the face and chest, but who is expected to survive. Friends of her family had already raised nearly $115,000 by Sunday through a GoFundMe page to help her family pay for expenses.\n\nHer mother wrote a message for the page in which she explained her daughter\u2019s injuries. \u201cAnderson is 17 months old, has shrapnel in her right chest, which thank God is superficial,\u201d her mother wrote. \u201cShe has a hole through her bottom lip and tongue and her front teeth were knocked out. She is alive. When others today are not alive.\u201d\n\nThe mother then went on to ask for prayers the dead, injured and even the shooter. \u201cI ask you to continue praying for our hearts as we experience this, pray for complete healing of Anderson, pray for every other family in our same situation, or worse, today and pray for the shooters,\u201d she wrote. \u201cPray that whatever is causing them to do this will be defeated by God and they will stop shooting.\u201d (Early reports indicated that there might have been more than one shooter, but that has since been corrected.)\n\nMidland Police Officer Zack Owens was also shot multiple time in his arm and hand as he tried to neutralize the shooter. His own GoFundMe page had already raised nearly $40,000 by Sunday. The page also noted that his worst injury was glass shards in his eye.\n\nOn Sunday night, a vigil for victims was held at the local University of Texas of the Permian Basin (UTPB). Hundreds were in attendance to honor the dead. The university screenprinted t-shirts that read, \"Permian Basin Strong\" and handed them out for free. Meanwhile, the evangelical organization Gideons International was on hand passing out Bibles. For weeks, they'd also been distributing the holy books in El Paso after the mass shooting there earlier this month. One Gideons member remarked, \"Sister cities for all the wrong reasons.\"\n\nTwo friends of Leilah Hernandez, who were attending the vigil, had made a posterboard full of silly and sweet pictures of the teen\u2014the latest victim of America's mass shooting epidemic.\n\nWith additional reporting by Justin Hamel in Odessa", "description": "Seven people were killed and roughly 20 more were injured when a white man in his mid-30s opened fire after being pulled over by police in west Texas on Saturday.", "authors": ["Barbie Latza Nadeau"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_2791,w_4962,x_-1,y_4362/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1567384453/190901-Nadeau-embed-1_uklxjy"}
