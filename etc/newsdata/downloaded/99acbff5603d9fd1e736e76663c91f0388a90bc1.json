Peter Maginnis was in the family car, being a fun dad with his young daughter, when his wife returned from picking up a gift certificate for her best friend\u2019s birthday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018Look, daddy-daughter moment, that\u2019s awesome,\u2019\u201d MaryAnn Maginnis would recall 17 years later.\n\n\u201cI wish she would remember that. She doesn't remember anything. She was 1 year old.\u201d\n\nMaryAnn remembers everything of that September day in 2002. Peter had driven her to get the gift certificate and then dropped her and their daughter, Joli, off at a restaurant for her best friend\u2019s birthday lunch. MaryAnn still was having a great time when she saw that it was nearing 2:30 p.m., the end of the school day.\n\n\u201cOf course, you know girls, we talk way too much and we were late,\u201d MaryAnn later said.\n\nShe repeatedly tried to get Peter on his cellphone to see if he could take the boys home from school.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m calling, calling, calling; \u2018Hey, hon, I\u2019m leaving you messages, could you help me out picking up the kids?\u2019\u201d MaryAnn would recall. \u201cBut he never answered.\u201d\n\nA friend with a minivan told MaryAnn not to worry about it, and drove her to collect 5-year-old TJ and 4-year-old Jonathan. The friend dropped them home. TJ had a playdate and the boys were watching Spider-Man when Mary Ann went upstairs to change.\n\n\u201cI remember the intro, and that\u2019s when everything happened,\u201d TJ later said.\n\nUp in the master bedroom, MaryAnn saw several envelopes on the bed. She figured they must be a surprise from Peter.\n\n\u201cI thought they were all gift certificates to get manicures, pedicures,\u201d she later said. \u201cThat\u2019s what he used to do.\u201d\n\nShe had told him in the past that with three kids they could not afford such extravagances, but he had always insisted she deserved it. She could not help but be pleased and touched.\n\n\u201cI was, \u2018Look at him,\u201d she would recall. \u201cHe was awesome, because my husband loves me and I knew he did.\u201d\n\nShe then began opening the envelopes.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not gift certificates,\u201d she would remember.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re goodbye letters.\u201d\n\nThe letters were addressed to her and to each of the kids and to her parents. She immediately dialed his cellphone. She heard a ringing downstairs.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m calling his phone, and guess what, he left it downstairs,\u201d she would remember. \u201cThe phone\u2019s ringing downstairs. I heard it.\u201d\n\nShe used her cellphone and the landline to call everybody she could think of. The 911 operator could not help. Nobody had seen Peter. Nobody had any idea where he might be.\n\nShe still had no word of him when she stepped outside. She saw two NYPD chaplains, Msgr. David Cassato and Msgr. Robert Romano, approaching the house.\n\n\u201c The world changed. I collapsed. Everything just fell apart. \u201d \u2014 MaryAnn Maginnis\n\n\u201cEverything dropped,\u201d she later said. \u201cThe world changed. I collapsed. Everything just fell apart.\u201d\n\nAfter dropping MaryAnn and Joli off, Peter had driven a few minutes away to Shore Road. He parked the car and crossed a pedestrian bridge over the Belt Parkway. He shot himself at the edge of New York Bay. He was 37. His body was discovered at 2:25 p.m., right about when MaryAnn had been calling to see if he could pick up the boys. Nine months into 2002, Peter had become the year\u2019s first NYPD suicide.\n\nMaryAnn was still struggling with the enormity of that single loss as this current year saw one NYPD member after another after another commit suicide. The total had reached nine in August when the annual average is around four or five. She decided she had to do something.\n\n\u201cWhen I see what\u2019s going on, I\u2019m like, \u2018This isn\u2019t cool. No! It\u2019s not acceptable,\u2019\u201d she told The Daily Beast.\n\nThe people who had come to MaryAnn\u2019s house to offer support on the day of Peter\u2019s suicide included Bob Ganley, then vice-present of the Sergeants Benevolent Association. Ganley had since become deputy commissioner for employee relations and has been in the lead of the NYPD\u2019s increasingly urgent suicide prevention efforts this year. The department has sought to make cops less reluctant to seek counseling and to make therapy more immediately available. Cops are encouraged to keep an eye out for fellow officers who seem to be in distress. Those determined to be a danger to themselves had in the past been relieved of their shield along with their gun. A new policy allowed them to keep their shield, thereby further distinguishing cops with emotional troubles from cops in disciplinary trouble.\n\nMaryAnn now called Ganley and said she wanted to make cops more aware of what suicide does to the survivors. Ganley told her to email him a summary of what she might want to say.\n\nMaryAnn did not pretend to know why so many cops were killing themselves. She still could not fully fathom why Peter had. Yes, he had injured his left hand while working with Brooklyn South Narcotics. Yes, that was his gun hand. Yes, his application for a disability pension had been deferred for six months. Yes, remaining out sick meant no overtime, no night differential, no side jobs. Yes, it made the mortgage and the bills harder to meet. But they were rich by a far more important measure.\n\n\u201cI was wealthy because I had three beautiful, healthy kids,\u201d she later said.\n\nThey had a nice house near her mother\u2019s home in Dyker Heights, one of Brooklyn\u2019s better neighborhoods. And after two sons, they also had a daughter. Peter had been in tears after he saw the sonogram.\n\n\u201cI finally got the baby girl. We tried, tried, tried,\u201d MaryAnn later said. \u201cI thought everything was great; \u2018I know you got hurt, but hon, toughen up and we'll get through this.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhat MaryAnn did know about cop suicide was the impact on the family, particularly when you have young children. She knew what it was to have to pretend all was well even as you feel crushing grief complicated by the stigma that surrounds suicide.\n\n\u201cI had babies,\u201d she said. \u201cI had to take care of them. I had to make everything positive. I had to make sure my kids were happy and healthy and that was my number one.\u201d\n\nShe also knew what it was to wrestle with how to tell the kids why their father was forever gone. The family observed Peter\u2019s birthday and held a remembrance on the day of his death, but she initially told them that he had died in a car accident. She told the boys the truth when they were 10 and 9, old enough that they might see a reference to it online. She explained that a person can have emotional or mental troubles that are not visible like a broken limb would be.\n\n\u201cAnd unfortunately, that was what happened with dad,\u201d she told TJ and Jonathan.\n\n\u201c I thought it was my fault. \u201d \u2014 14-year-old Joli Maginnis\n\nMaryAnn did not tell her daughter until she was 14. MaryAnn again tried to explain about invisible emotional and mental troubles. Joli immediately began to cry hysterically.\n\n\u201cI thought it was my fault,\u201d Joli said. \u201cBecause I was a baby. I was 1 year old and daddy worked all those hours, second jobs and I thought that because I was crying I kept him up at night and he fell asleep at the wheel.\u201d\n\n\u201cJoli, you were the happiest, easiest baby,\u201d MaryAnn truthfully told her.\n\nMayAnn told herself, \u201cAnd I thought I was protecting her all these years.\u201d\n\nMaryAnn could tell people about these moments. She could also tell them about Peter missing birthdays and first communions and confirmations and Joli\u2019s Sweet 16 party. She could also tell them how she struggled to keep things positive.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s almost this black cloud on my shoulder and I feel it,\u201d she later said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not fair. Kids shouldn't be raised that way. They should be happy.\u201d\n\nBut now her kids were grown and she could drop the brave facade and describe exactly how hard things were. She was ready to do so with the hope of dissuading other cops from devastating their families in a moment of unthinking despair.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care what\u2019s going on in your life, what you\u2019re going to end up doing to your family is not acceptable,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\nShe also wanted to tell cops the importance of applying \u201cif you see something, say something\u201d to each other\u2019s mental and emotional state. She was informed after Peter\u2019s suicide that he had come into the stationhouse that very day to get his dress uniform even though he was still sidelined by his hand injury.\n\n\u201cI remember somebody saying to me they thought it was bizarre that he came to get this dress uniform and he was out sick,\u201d she later said.\n\nShe cannot help but wish that somebody had recognized this as a danger sign and said something. The uniform was later found in Peter\u2019s car.\n\n\u201cHe wanted to wear it at his funeral,\u201d MaryAnn later said. \u201cThat\u2019s what they put him in. His dress uniform.\u201d\n\nThe lengthy email MaryAnn sent to Ganley summarized all she had been through and wanted to share. Ganley arranged for her to address a meeting of police organizations at the academy in September. He told her he did not want her just to read from the life story she had written.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018I want you to get up there and I want you to just speak from the heart,\u2019\u201d MaryAnn recalled. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what I did.\u201d\n\nShe saw the effect as she spoke.\n\n\u201cI gotta tell you, I saw men wiping their eyes,\u201d she later said. \u201cWomen were definitely wiping their eyes.\u201d\n\nA number of people approached her afterwards.\n\n\u201cThey actually came over and hugged me and thanked me,\u201d she remembered. \u201cThey were like \u2018 You have given us your side of it.\u2019 I said, \u2018Well, you know what? If I can make somebody feel bad, feel guilty, think and say, Well, if I do this, this is like not cool, because I'm leaving everything\u2026\u2019\u201d\n\nShe was asked to speak again at the NYPD Holy Name Society\u2019s monthly meeting. She had the same effect and afterwards several people came over and joked they had been lied to when they were told she was not a public speaker.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018It\u2019s not that I\u2019m a public speaker, I\u2019m Italian,\u201d MaryAnn said.\n\nOthers who joined the effort to prevent further police suicides included Cardinal Timothy Dolan, who said a Mass for survivors at Saint Patrick\u2019s Cathedral on Oct. 13. MaryAnn was one of more than 100 survivors who attended. She is Catholic and had been raised at a time when church teachings held that suicide was a mortal sin that condemned a person to damnation.\n\n\u201cIs he going to hell?\u201d she remembers asking herself after Peter\u2019s suicide.\n\nThe church had since softened, allowing that most of those who commit suicide are suffering from mental illness, what the catechism terms \u201dgrave psychological disturbances.\u201d MaryAnn had decided Pete had not been consigned to eternal damnation and had asked her dying brother to seek him out in the hereafter.\n\nHer brother had asked her, \u201cYou watch out for my kids.\u201d She had replied, \u201cAbsolutely, and you punch Peter in the face. But hug him after that.\u201d\n\nBut Maryanne had still felt and imbued shame whenever she entered a church. She now listened to the cardinal say what she what she hoped to hear.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of the Catholic family of the archdiocese, we love you and pray with and for you and the ones for whom you rightly continue to mourn,\u201d Cardinal Dolan said.\n\nThe survivors were invited up to the altar and shook. She shook Dolan\u2019s hand.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018I feel like this weight is off my shoulders,\u2019\u201d she recalled.\n\nShe understood this was a weight she should never have felt.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t do anything,\u201d she told The Daily Beast. \u201cMy husband didn\u2019t do anything. My husband was sick.\u201d\n\nTwo days after the Mass, Sgt. Linhong Li of the 24th Precinct shot himself in his Queens home. Aged 33. A Marine who had served in Iraq. The winner of the First Deputy Commissioner's Award for highest academic average in the academy. A top scorer in the sergeant\u2019s exam. Newly married. And now the 10th NYPD suicide of the year, a record.\n\nLi is said to have been in contact with the department's early intervention unit. The particulars of that interaction are now being evaluated in the NYPD\u2019s continuing effort to prevent future suicides.\n\nThe effort also includes MaryAnn Maginnis, who will soon have another opportunity to deliver what she calls \u201cmy speech.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, her elder son, TJ, hopes to be going into the police academy soon.\n\n\u201cI said, TJ, you should be an architect,\u2019\u201d she told The Daily Beast. \u201cThat lasted five minutes.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cIf it makes him happy, I\u2019m for it. As long as he\u2019s happy, I\u2019m happy.\u201d\n\nShe showed The Daily Beast a picture of TJ in a police uniform she made for him to wear as a tyke to his father\u2019s promotion.\n\n\u201cIt takes a lot to become a cop,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you want to be a cop, you're doing it. It's in your bones. It's in your blood.\u201d\n\nUnderlying her message to cops who might fall into despair is what kept her going when she suddenly found herself a widow with three young kids as a result of something nobody felt comfortable talking about.\n\n\u201cLife is tough,\u201d she said. \u201cLife is very hard. You've got to pull up your bloomers and you've got to be a strong person.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cHey, I got news for you, I did a pretty good job.\u201d\n\nBack in 1988 when Peter was 22, he had attended the funeral for a fellow young cop named Edward Byrne, who had been shot to death in his radio car while guarding the home of a witness in a drug case.\n\n''It could have happened to anyone out there, any time,\u201d Pete had told a reporter outside the church. \u201cWe can't let it happen again.''\n\nMore than three decades later, 52-year-old MaryAnn is saying the same about police suicides such as claimed Peter.\n\n\u201cIf I could save one and make one rethink a bad choice, it\u2019s a good thing,\u201d she said.", "description": "MaryAnn Maginnis\u2019 husband took his own life in 2002.
