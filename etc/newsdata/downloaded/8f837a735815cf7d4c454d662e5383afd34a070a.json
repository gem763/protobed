Whistleblowers, specifically within the intelligence community, are vulnerable to retaliation and having their security clearance revoked, which could hinder their ability to secure a job in the IC in the future.\n\nOn Wednesday, attorneys for the whistleblower rejected reports that their client had a \"professional relationship\" with a Democratic presidential candidate. \"First, our client has never worked for or advised a political candidate, campaign, or party,\" they said in a statement. \"Second, our client has spent their entire government career in apolitical, civil servant positions in the Executive Branch. Third, in these positions our client has come into contact with presidential candidates from both parties in their roles as elected officials \u2013 not as candidates.\"\n\nIt\u2019s not clear whether the president knows the whistleblower\u2019s name. His confidants are certainly interested; one person close to the president said he would like to find out the whistleblower\u2019s identity, describing him as \u201ca political operator\u201d who seems to be part of \u201ca coordinated campaign.\u201d\n\nBut if Trump learned the name, he could choose to release it in the name of \u201ctransparency\u201d if he wishes, said McCullough. \u201cIt\u2019d be a gross attack against the intelligence oversight system, especially given the chilling effect that release would create, but it\u2019s within his power to launch that attack.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s little stopping Trump\u2019s congressional allies from revealing it, either. Members of Congress can be held accountable for violating congressional rules\u2014for example, a member of the House Intelligence Committee illicitly disclosing information gleaned by that panel could be censured by the House. But lawmakers \u201ccan\u2019t be legally held accountable for their official actions by any other tribunal,\u201d said Kel McClanahan, executive director of the National Security Counselors law firm.\n\nThe Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act of 1998, which provided a framework for intelligence community whistleblowers to report their concerns to Congress through their agency\u2019s inspector general, didn\u2019t envision a world where a whistleblower seeking anonymity could be exposed online by social media sleuths with tens of thousands of followers.\n\nLongtime intelligence officials say the culture of the CIA, where the whistleblower reportedly worked, is apolitical and it\u2019s considered inappropriate to ask about someone\u2019s partisan leanings. A former Trump NSC official noted the inscription carved in the wall of the agency\u2019s headquarters in Langley, Va., that reads \u201cand you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free.\u201d\n\n\"These are the people who look at that every morning and truly believe that the process was built to work,\" the former official said.\n\nSubstantively, the whistleblower\u2019s identity and claims about his political agenda may not matter much \u2014 not only did the White House release a rough transcript of the president\u2019s call with Ukrainia\u2019s Volodymyr Zelensky that confirmed his account in detail, but the president in subsequent days went on to openly call on the government in Kiev to investigate Joe Biden, one of his chief 2020 rivals.\n\nPolitically, however, Republicans perceive an opening. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California, House Intelligence Committee ranking member Devin Nunes and House Oversight Committee ranking member Jim Jordan, have repeatedly questioned the whistleblower\u2019s credibility and motivations for coming forward, and the RNC has sent out press releases highlighting his attorneys\u2019 alleged ties to Democrats.\n\n\u201cFrankly, any witness, when you're trying to determine credibility, you have to ask two fundamental questions,\u201d Jordan told NPR late last month. \u201cThe first one is, do they have firsthand knowledge? Were they an actual witness? The second question is motivation. This whistleblower comes up short in both areas.\u201d\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201910/2185/1155968404_6093549104001_6093546356001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\"\n\nSouth Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham has called for the whistleblower to be \u201ccross-examined\u201d in public should Trump be impeached over his accusations.\n\n\u201cIf the whistleblower\u2019s allegations are turned into an impeachment article, it\u2019s imperative that the whistleblower be interviewed in public, under oath, and cross-examined,\u201d Graham told Fox on Sunday.\n\nRepublicans have also seized upon a recent New York Times account to accuse the whistleblower of collaborating with House Democrats, who say they merely connected him with an attorney and advised he file a formal complaint.\n\nThere are a couple statutes that could theoretically shield the whistleblower, but each has its own problem.\n\nThe Privacy Act, which does not apply to the White House, might prohibit other executive branch officials from revealing the whistleblower\u2019s identity, according to McClanahan. But finding them liable in court \u201cwould be extremely problematic because the Privacy Act is full of loopholes.\u201d\n\nAnother potential \u201csaving grace\u201d for the whistleblower should Trump\u2019s allies learn their identity is the Intelligence Identities Protection Act, which makes it a federal crime to intentionally disclose the identity of a covert agent to anyone not authorized to receive classified information.\n\nThe legal peril is real: Scooter Libby, a former top George W. Bush administration official, was indicted in 2005 on charges related to his leaks about Valerie Plame, who was then an undercover officer at the CIA. In 2018, Trump pardoned Libby, who was convicted in 2007 for perjury and obstructing justice.\n\nBut McCullough cautioned that the scope of that statute only covers those working within the intelligence community whose identity is classified, and not enough is known about the whistleblower\u2019s status within the intelligence community to determine whether the statute would apply.\n\nDaniel Lippman contributed reporting.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/7e/b8/e1367d7f491ebc10fbfd186eeeb9/191009-trump-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
