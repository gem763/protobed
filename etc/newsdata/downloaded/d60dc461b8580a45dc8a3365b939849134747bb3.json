Justin Amash of Michigan, formerly a Republican.\n\nBy TIME\u2019s count, 16 Democrats have not explicitly said whether they support the inquiry, and at least two have said they oppose it. No members of the Republican caucus have said they support the impeachment investigation.\n\nThe numbers mark a crucial turning point for the impeachment inquiry. In order to pass articles of impeachment\u2014thus impeaching the President and moving the process to the Senate\u2014Pelosi needs a majority: 218 votes. They also exemplify the rapid growth in support for the impeachment inquiry even among moderate Democratic representatives; the number of House Democrats supporting the inquiry grew by more than 80 members since Monday, according to the New York Times.\n\nWhile some House Democrats have called for the President\u2019s impeachment since 2017, the topic gained more attention at the end of July following special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s testimony about his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. By early August, 118 House Democrats said they supported impeachment proceedings, according to Politico.\n\nBut this increase in support doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the President will be removed from office. A smaller number of representatives\u2014at least 44 by TIME\u2019s count\u2014have said they support impeachment, the approval of formal charges, rather than just the inquiry itself. Even if the House passes articles of impeachment, a two-thirds vote of the Senate would still be required. It appears unlikely at this time that the Senate\u2014which includes 53 Republicans\u2014would vote to convict him.\n\nOn Thursday, the House Intelligence Committee released an unclassified version of a complaint filed by a whistleblower that alleged President Trump used \u201cthe power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election.\u201d The complaint alleges the President \u201cpressured\u201d Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, one of the frontrunners of the 2020 presidential election, and his son, Hunter Biden. Trump has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and said there was \u201cno quid pro quo\u201d on the call.\n\nThe complaint was made public a day after the White House released a summary of the July phone call between Trump and Zelensky. Per the White House summary, Zelensky expressed interest in purchasing U.S.-made missiles before Trump asked for a \u201cfavor.\u201d He also asked Zelensky to open investigations into Biden and his son. Zelensky has publicly denied that Trump pressure him on the call, saying \u201cNobody pushed me.\u201d\n\nThe Constitution says the President may be impeached and removed for charges of \u201ctreason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.\u201d The process begins with the majority of the House of Representatives voting to impeach the president, followed by a two-thirds majority of the Senate voting to convict and remove him or her.\n\nOnly three other presidents in American history have faced impeachment: President Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton were impeached but acquitted by the Senate, and President Richard Nixon resigned amid impeachment proceedings.\n\nWith reporting by Nadia Suleman, Kathy Ehrich Dowd, Alana Abramson and Tara Law", "description": "In order to pass articles of impeachment, Pelosi needs a majority of the body: 218 votes.", "authors": ["Madeleine Carlisle"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/hWqcmLhPI5U.mvc5WrDUMA--~B/aD0xNjAzO3c9MjQwNTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/8f9ffba3189d62cbd652e126aaedd5a5", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
