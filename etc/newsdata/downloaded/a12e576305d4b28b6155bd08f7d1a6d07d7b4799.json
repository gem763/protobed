It has put quite a lot of stress on the family.\n\n\"I was absolutely speechless and thought how low can you get.\n\n\"The whole idea was to have a friend do the work because we wanted someone we could trust. Becca saw red. She was absolutely fuming. She was in tears because it was a complete abuse of trust.\n\n\u201cThe sofa is gone. There was no way we could let our kids sit on it again knowing what happened. We gave it away for nothing. We just wanted it out of the house as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cI have asked him if he had a girl round at the house and he has completely denied it all to me. But you can clearly see and hear what is going on.\n\n\u201cYou can hear slapping noises and sex noises. It\u2019s absolutely disgusting to do that in someone else\u2019s house where children live.\"\n\nMichael said he has known old school friend Mike for more than ten years so thought he could trust the plumber to be in his house alone.\n\nHe flew to Antalya with his wife Becca and their four children on September 22 for a seven-night holiday.\n\nMichael said he asked Mike to fit a vanity unit, ceiling lights and floor tiles in the upstairs bathroom of their house while they were away.\n\nThe \u00a3570 job was completed before the family returned home, and Mike updated the family with text messages throughout.\n\n(Image: Facebook)\n\nBut he claims he noticed a crate of beer had gone missing, so checked the CCTV camera that monitors his driveway.\n\nCumbria Police has confirmed officers are investigating the allegations and enquiries are ongoing.\n\nMichael said: \u201cI asked the decorator and he said it wasn\u2019t him. Then he said Mike had a girl in the house and sh***ed her on the sofa.\n\n\u201cI rang Mike straight away to ask him and he said \u2018no I would never do that, you know me, I\u2019m not like that\u2019.\n\n\u201cI watched the videos back and saw the girl arrive. She was here for a good three hours. You can hear them around the house talking and that and then you can hear sex noises.\n\n\"You can hear all-sorts. You can hear slapping noises and groaning. It\u2019s disgusting and I still can\u2019t believe it.\n\n(Image: Facebook)\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s denied it all and has blocked me on social media completely.\u201d\n\nBut Mike did admit in a text message he had a \u201cfriend\u201d round at the house and the pair got \u201camorous\u201d.\n\nMichael found out the name of the woman involved through one of Mike's friends - understood to be a 37-year-old - and confronted her on Facebook.\n\nShe replied in a message that said: \"Thanks for breaking up my family.\"\n\nMichael also sent the recordings to the woman's husband via Facebook messenger. In messages exchanged on Facebook the woman's shocked husband said both Mike and his wife have since admitted it.\n\nWhen Mike was contacted for comment he said \"don't call me again or I'll have to start charging you for my time\" and hung up.\n\nHe was also contacted via text message but refused to respond.\n\nA Cumbria Police spokesperson said: \"Police were contacted on October 2. An allegation of theft of alcohol is under investigation.\"", "description": "Cumbria Police were called as Mike Wilson was warned he will not be getting paid because the owners \"now need a new sofa\"", "authors": ["Jack Longstaff", "Sam Elliott", "Image", "Facebook"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20564280.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_JS195637790-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
