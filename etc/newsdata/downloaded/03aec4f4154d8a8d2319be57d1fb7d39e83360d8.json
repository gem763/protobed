She jumped over the fence and landed with enough force to help free the deer for the second time.\n\nDorsey finished her run and later posted her footage to Instagram, where the viral video has been viewed tens of thousands of times.\n\n\"We were both scared for each other,\" she wrote on Instagram. \"I'm so happy I was at the right place at the right time.\"", "description": "A Georgia jogger paused her morning run to save a deer that got stuck -- twice.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/deer-rescue-20190925_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
