Analysts had questioned the company\u2019s valuation, pegging the firm\u2019s value as low as $10 billion. Oracle co-founder and billionaire Larry Ellison called WeWork \u201calmost worthless\u201d last month.\n\nThere were also questions about CEO Neumann\u2019s abilities, following allegations of drug use and bizarre behavior.\n\nNeumann, who resigned as CEO last month, will leave WeWork\u2019s board of directors as part of the arrangement, the Journal reported. He will continue to own a stake in WeWork and will serve as an adviser to the board going forward.\n\nEarlier this week, the Journal said that WeWork postponed laying off thousands of workers because the company didn\u2019t have enough cash to pay them severance.\n\nFollow David Ng on Twitter @HeyItsDavidNg.
