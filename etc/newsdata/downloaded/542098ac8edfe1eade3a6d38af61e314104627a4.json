Picking England's XI and squad for Euro 2020 1/24 England XI and squad for Euro 2020 Gareth Southgate has the most exciting front line of a generation but has decisions to make in defence and midfield PA 2/24 Bench - Nick Pope The Burnley goalkeeper is an excellent shot-stopper and a very competent backup to Pickford. Getty Images 3/24 Bench - Tom Heaton Another extremely good shot-stopper, Heaton would also be a reliable option to call upon if injuries struck. Action Images via Reuters 4/24 Bench - Kyle Walker Walker\u2019s pace is his best asset, but he has proved at Man City that he is capable of playing in a technical set up. His attributes over that of Aaron Wan-Bissaka are more suited to Southgate\u2019s style of play. Action Images via Reuters 5/24 Bench - Joe Gomez Gomez has been very unlucky with injury, and needs a run of games to remind people that he is a very good centre-back. He is capable of defending, reading the game and at playing out from the back. AFP/Getty Images 6/24 Bench - James Tarkowski His clubmate Ben Mee has somehow alluded an international call up, but Tarkowski is a very talented defender who delivers a 7/10 minimum in almost every game. Action Images via Reuters 7/24 Bench - James Tarkowski Chilwell is still developing as a left-back at Leicester and is good, without excelling, both defensively and offensively. REUTERS 8/24 Bench - Declan Rice Rice is another who\u2019s enjoyed a quick rise to the England squad, and is a promising ball-winning midfielder. Without having top-level experience it is hard to argue for him to start over Henderson. Action Images via Reuters 9/24 Bench - Mason Mount Mount, despite his age, has demonstrated his game-changing ability and possesses excellent decision-making ability that earmarks him ahead of more experienced midfielders. REUTERS 10/24 Bench - James Maddison Maddison perhaps operates best as a no.10, a position Southgate has not really used. However, his playmaking and set-piece abilities are a valuable weapon off of the bench despite not yet being capped. REUTERS 11/24 Bench - Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain Another who needs to prove his fitness to remind people of his talent, Oxlade-Chamberlain is quick, can beat a man, and is capable of playing most midfield positions. Getty Images 12/24 Bench - Callum Hudson-Odoi Hudson-Odoi has displayed a lot of ability in his short career at club and international level, and is another who is an excellent option to have from the bench. Action Images via Reuters 13/24 Bench - Marcus Rashford Rashford\u2019s role in this squad is to provide coverage across the front line, and his pace and attacking versatility could prove very valuable later in the tournament. Getty Images 14/24 GK - Jordan Pickford Pickford has not quite progressed at the rate many thought he would when he first signed for Everton, but he remains a good stopper and his distribution is a useful tool for Southgate. EPA 15/24 RB - Trent Alexander-Arnold Although he is less defensively capable than his right-back contemporaries, Alexander-Arnold\u2019s technical and set-piece abilities are a weapon that England should look to exploit. REUTERS 16/24 CB - Harry Maguire Despite giving away a penalty against Kosovo, Maguire is the most \u2018solid\u2019 out of England\u2019s centre-backs and his aerial presence in both boxes can be game-changing. Action Images via Reuters 17/24 CB - John Stones Centre-back has been England\u2019s Achilles heel for several years, with all of the candidates looking error-prone at times. Stones has experience and ball-playing ability on his side, which suits Southgate\u2019s style of play. PA 18/24 LB - Danny Rose Rose gets the nod over Ben Chilwell because he is slightly more athletic and defensively capable and has the advantage of playing for a top club, making him more suited to the intensity of tournament football. Getty Images 19/24 DM - Jordan Henderson Although he has box-to-box capabilities, Henderson\u2019s ability to sit back and allow other players to be more creative is invaluable and his contributions often go undervalued. Action Images via Reuters 20/24 CM - Ruben Loftus-Cheek Despite being currently injured, Loftus-Cheek at his peak is a devastating midfielder and has a fantastic talent for carrying the ball between the lines. Having said that, he must get fit and start regularly for Chelsea soon. REUTERS 21/24 CM - Dele Alli When England (hopefully) advance to the latter stages, they are likely to line up more defensively, but the dual threat of Alli and Loftus-Cheek in the final third could be very potent for the Three Lions. Getty 22/24 LW - Raheem Sterling Sterling has been in world-class form for the last two seasons and is one of the first names on the teamsheet. Playing in his favoured position on the left allows him to replicate his phenomenal performances for Manchester City. EPA 23/24 RW - Jadon Sancho Sancho is another who possesses frightening natural ability, but is equally capable of coming inside and playing quick passes as he is beating someone for pace and driving in a cross and should be a sure starter next summer. Getty 24/24 ST - Harry Kane Captain Kane is England\u2019s only striker who plays at a high level for club, with Marcus Rashford preferred out wide for United. Kane has already demonstrated his scoring potential at a major tournament...
