REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/File Photo\n\nFRANKFURT (Reuters) - Facebook\u2019s proposed Libra currency could undermine the European Central Bank\u2019s ability to set monetary policy and Europe should ignore its siren call of \u201ctreacherous promises\u201d ECB board member Yves Mersch said on Monday.\n\nFacebook announced Libra \u2014 a new digital coin backed by four official currencies and available to billions of social network users around the world \u2014 earlier this year, saying it hoped to launch next year.\n\n\u201cDepending on Libra\u2019s level of acceptance and on the referencing of the euro in its reserve basket, it could reduce the ECB\u2019s control over the euro, impair the monetary policy transmission mechanism by affecting the liquidity position of euro area banks, and undermine the single currency\u2019s international role,\u201d Mersch added.\n\nLike regular currencies, Libra would be highly centralised, an \u201cextremely concerning\u201d setup since it is not backed by a lender of last resort and it is ultimately accountable to shareholders, who are not seen as repositories of public trust, Mersch added.\n\n\u201cIt is scheduled for release in the first half of 2020 by the very same people who had to explain themselves in front of legislators in the United States and the European Union on the threats to our democracies resulting from their handling of personal data on their social media platform,\u201d Mersch added.\n\nGiven these challenges, European regulatory and supervisory authorities need to assert jurisdiction over Libra and also need global cooperation to mitigate its risks.\n\n\u201cI sincerely hope that the people of Europe will not be tempted to leave behind the safety and soundness of established payment solutions and channels in favour of the beguiling but treacherous promises of Facebook\u2019s siren call,\u201d Mersch added.", "description": "Facebook's proposed Libra currency could undermine the European Central Bank's ability to set monetary policy and Europe should ignore its siren call of \"treacherous promises\" ECB board member Yves Mersch said on Monday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190902&t=2&i=1425321516&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF810KR"}
