The Eagles are still behind the undefeated Dallas Cowboys in the NFC East but have some momentum after Nigel Bradham intercepted Aaron Rodgers inside Philadelphia's 5-yard line in the final minute of the game.\n\nThat, along with a dominant performance from Jordan Howard, was enough to win on the road.\n\nAs for the Packers, they are now 3-1 and still well-positioned for a playoff run, but they lost ground in a daunting NFC North that features four teams above .500.\n\nNotable Fantasy Stats\n\nAaron Rodgers: 34-of-53 for 422 yards, two touchdowns, one interception; 46 rushing yards\n\nAaron Jones: 13 carries for 21 yards, one touchdown; six catches for 37 yards\n\nDavante Adams: 10 catches for 180 yards\n\nJimmy Graham: six catches for 61 yards, one touchdown\n\nCarson Wentz: 16-of-27 for 160 yards, three touchdowns; 13 rushing yards\n\nJordan Howard: 15 carries for 87 yards, two touchdowns; three catches for 28 yards, one touchdown\n\nMiles Sanders: 11 carries for 72 yards\n\nZach Ertz: seven catches for 65 yards\n\nAlshon Jeffery: three catches for 38 yards, one touchdown\n\nDallas Goedert: two catches for 16 yards, one touchdown\n\nEagles Ground Game Provides Blueprint for Future Success\n\nLook out, NFC. The Eagles may have a running game.\n\nBetween Carson Wentz, Alshon Jeffery, Zach Ertz, DeSean Jackson and Nelson Agholor, Philadelphia's aerial attack stands out on paper. That was the case during the first three weeks when Howard failed to top 44 yards on the ground in any game and Miles Sanders averaged 3.1 yards per rush, but the pair\u2014and the offensive line in front of them\u2014had other ideas Thursday.\n\nPhiladelphia consistently opened up holes, which allowed Howard and Sanders to play a game of thunder and lightning that could carry through the rest of the season.\n\nHoward powered his way into the end zone twice, while Sanders eluded tacklers in space and shifted into turbo in the open field. What's more, Howard, who isn't known for his receiving prowess, got involved in the passing game and walked into the end zone on a pass to the flat.\n\nNot only did Philadelphia's rushing game help save a secondary that had no answer for Aaron Rodgers and Davante Adams and watched Sidney Jones exit with a hamstring injury and Avonte Maddox taken off on a stretcher, but it also provided a blueprint for success in the immediate future.\n\nOpponents will find themselves in trouble any time they have to commit additional defenders to the box against an offense featuring that many talented pass-catchers, and Wentz was able to take advantage with an efficient performance and well-timed touchdowns even though he didn't throw for many yards.\n\nPhiladelphia will need a balanced offense in a loaded NFC, and it was on full display Thursday.\n\nAaron Rodgers is Still Superman Even in Defeat\n\nThe Packers of old made an appearance for Thursday's game.\n\nGreen Bay has been known for its offense throughout the majority of Rodgers' tenure, but the defense led the way during the first three wins. It entered this contest 23rd in the league in points per game (19.3) and second in points allowed per game (11.7), thanks in large part to Preston Smith and Za'Darius Smith pressuring the quarterback and Jaire Alexander shadowing receivers.\n\nThat defense was largely missing against the Eagles and went through a stretch in which it allowed four touchdowns on four straight possessions (not counting a kneel-down to end the first half). It also forced its quarterback into the familiar Superman role.\n\nRodgers excelled for much of the game, dropping dimes to Adams against an overmatched secondary and dispersing the ball to different playmakers like a point guard on the fast break.\n\nHe was never better than at the end of the first half when he worked his magic with a 70-yard drive that took just 50 seconds. The quarterback who may be the scariest in league history with the clock running out capped off the drive with a pass to Geronimo Allison that moved him into ninth place on the all-time list for touchdown passes.\n\nThe future Hall of Famer one-upped himself with a fadeaway throw off his back foot to Jimmy Graham that softly fluttered between two defenders late in the third quarter, but his touch ran out with the game hanging in the balance.\n\nRodgers needed to be perfect to overcome the defensive struggles, but he threw four straight incompletions from the 1-yard line to end one possession and tossed an interception to end the next.\n\nEven Superman falls short sometimes.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next?\n\nThe Packers travel to Dallas to face the Cowboys in a high-profile NFC clash in Week 5, while the Eagles host the New York Jets.", "description": "The Philadelphia Eagles are back to .500.
