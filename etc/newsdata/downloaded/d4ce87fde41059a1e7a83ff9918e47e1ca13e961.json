Avenatti has said the case against him emerged after he weighed a possible run for president in 2020.\n\nIn Thursday\u2019s filing, Avenatti cited Trump\u2019s effort to get Ukraine to investigate the president\u2019s top 2020 rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, saying it\u2019s the same kind of abuse of office that he\u2019s dealing with.\n\nA representative for U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman declined to comment. The White House didn\u2019t immediately respond to a message seeking comment.\n\nAvenatti was charged in March. In August, he asked the judge to dismiss the charges, calling it a \u201cvindictive prosecution,\u201d and the filing added to his pending request.\n\nProsecutors say the evidence against Avenatti is overwhelming. The government says it has video and audio recordings of Avenatti demanding Nike pay him more than $20 million to conduct an internal investigation of the company or face damaging claims that he planned to make public in a press conference.\n\nRead More: Avenatti-Nike Extortion Case Isn\u2019t About Trump Feud, U.S. Says\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Erik Larson in New York at elarson4@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: David Glovin at dglovin@bloomberg.net, Joe Schneider\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Celebrity lawyer Michael Avenatti told a New York judge that Donald Trump\u2019s Ukraine debacle is further evidence that the president uses the power of the federal government to target his political enemies.Avenatti, who gained fame as the Trump-bashing lawyer for pornographic-film actress", "authors": ["Erik Larson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
