A COMMUNITY SAFETY MESSAGE FROM BUTTS COUNTY SHERIFF GARY LONG,\u201d on their yards, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.\n\nDeputies either placed the signs on some sex offenders\u2019 lawns or told offenders they would face unspecified consequences if they did not display the signs on their front yards. The practice reportedly began last year.\n\nLong says he plans to fight to keep the signs on sex offenders\u2019 lawns.\n\n\u201cRegardless of the Judge\u2019s ruling this Thursday, I WILL do everything within the letter of the Law to protect the children of this Community,\u201d Long wrote on Facebook.\n\nA court hearing on the motion is scheduled for Thursday morning.\n\nAccording to the complaint, the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys argued that forcing the registered sex offenders to leave the signs up infringes upon their First Amendment rights.\n\nThe practice is not limited to Butts County. Other county law enforcement agencies in Georgia have carried out similar practices, such as Lamar and Monroe counties.\n\nIn Monroe County, if offenders refused to have a sign in their yard, they had to wait in the lobby of the local sheriff\u2019s office during Halloween trick-or-treat hours.", "description": "A group of sex offenders in Georgia are suing the Butts County Sheriff's Office for placing \"No Trick-or-Treat\" signs on their lawns.", "authors": ["Katherine Rodriguez"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/trick-or-treat-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
