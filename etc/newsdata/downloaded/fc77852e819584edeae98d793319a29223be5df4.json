Mike Huckabee said President Trump \u201cmade the right move\u201d when he announced that his administration will no longer consider hosting the 2020 G-7 summit at his personal resort in Doral, Fla.\n\nSpeaking on \u201cFox & Friends\u201d on Sunday Huckabee said, \u201cThey [Democrats] went berserk over this.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the president made the right move to say we are not going to go there. It\u2019s just something he doesn\u2019t need to add to the plate. His plate\u2019s overwhelmed with things he\u2019s being criticized for.\u201d\n\nTRUMP SCRAPS PLANS TO HOST 2020 G-7 SUMMIT AT DORAL RESORT AMID DEM UPROAR\n\nTrump announced on Saturday night that he was scrapping the plans and suggested he might consider Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland instead.\n\n\"Based on both Media & Democrat Crazed and Irrational Hostility, we will no longer consider Trump National Doral, Miami, as the Host Site for the G-7 in 2020,\" the president tweeted. \"We will begin the search for another site, including the possibility of Camp David, immediately.\"\n\nThe announcement followed earlier tweets in which he said he thought he \"was doing something very good for our Country\" by hosting world leaders at his Florida resort next year.\n\n\u201cIt is big, grand, on hundreds of acres, next to MIAMI INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, has tremendous ballrooms & meeting rooms, and each delegation would have its own 50 to 70 unit building,\" Trump tweeted.\n\nThe president followed up by saying he had offered to host the summit at no profit to himself to avoid concerns about \u201cemoluments violations.\u201d He said if it were legally permissible, he\u2019d offer to host the summit at no cost to the U.S.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers claimed Friday that past G-7 summits have cost \"upwards of $40 million.\"\n\nActing White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney announced Thursday that next year\u2019s G-7 meeting would be held at Trump National Doral Golf Club June 10-12, after months of speculation.\n\nMulvaney said the decision would save taxpayers millions because the resort would provide its services at cost.\n\n\u201cThe Trump family made their money before they went into politics,\u201d Mulvaney added later, to assuage any accusations the president might be profiting from his office.\n\nTrump first made the suggestion to have the 2020 G-7 at his Doral resort in August at the 2019 summit in France, sparking controversy over the ethics of a president potentially profiting from an official government event.\n\nDEMS INTRODUCE LEGISLATION TO BLOCK G7 SUMMIT AT TRUMP'S DORAL RESORT\n\nOne day after Mulvaney\u2019s announcement, a trio of Democratic lawmakers introduced legislation to block the president from hosting next year\u2019s summit.\n\nReps. Lois Frankel from Florida, Bennie Thompson from Mississippi and Steve Cohen from Tennessee proposed the Trump\u2019s Heist Undermines the G-7 (THUG) Act. A companion bill sponsored by Sens. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., and Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., will be introduced in the Senate, according to lawmakers.\n\nThe House bill would prohibit funding for the three-day summit in June. It would also require Trump to submit to Congress any documents related to the decision to host the summit at Doral, lawmakers said.\n\nOn Sunday, Huckabee also weighed in on the media blasting the plan to host the 2020 G-7 summit at the Trump National Doral Miami resort.\n\n\u201cFor them [the media] to try to make it that Donald Trump was even considering Doral because he was going to feather his own nest, my gosh, the man gives away every single penny of his entire presidential salary. He\u2019s a billionaire,\u201d Huckabee said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t need the revenue from a G-7 conference to be able to pay his electric bill next month. This is absurd.\u201d\n\nHe went on to say, \u201cThe president is a fighter. He fights the right fight. Sometimes you just say, \u2018This fight isn\u2019t worth the trouble. Let me use my energy to fight something that matters to the American people.\u2019\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cSo now the press will have to find something else and, trust me, they will. It doesn\u2019t matter what this president does, they\u2019re going to find something they don\u2019t like,\u201d Huckabee said.\n\nFox News\u2019 Morgan Phillips, Melissa Leon and Andrew O'Reilly contributed to this report.", "description": "Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee said President Trump \u201cmade the right move\u201d when he announced that his administration will no longer consider hosting the 2020 G-7 summit at his personal resort in Doral, Florida.", "authors": ["Talia Kaplan", "Talia Kaplan Is A Reporter For Foxnews.Com.
