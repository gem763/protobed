Mr. Catron notes that a \u201cfailed impeachment\u201d will weaken Democrats, strengthen the president and further motivate his already loyal supporters.\n\n\u201cTrump will win reelection in 2020 for three reasons: First, the voters are always reluctant to replace a president in a time of peace and prosperity, regardless of his perceived flaws. Second, a transparently partisan impeachment vote in the House followed by a fair trial and acquittal in the Senate, will seriously damage the Democratic brand while sparking an internal civil war between its moderate and leftwing factions. Finally, this ideological conflict within the opposition party will result in the nomination of a weak compromise candidate to face a vindicated and politically stronger incumbent president awash in cash and supported by highly motivated voters,\u201d Mr. Catron writes.\n\nFOR THE LEXICON\n\n\u201cSnit Romney.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a new monicker for former presidential hopeful Sen. Mitt Romney, who has irritated Townhall columnist Kurt Schlichter with his recent public aggression against President Trump.\n\nMr. Schlichter writes that the Utah Republican is an \u201cinsufferable establishment icon,\u201d adding \u201cMitt\u2019s loyalty is to Mitt and the glory that he believes should come from his blazing Mittness.\u201d\n\nALREADY OBSESSED WITH SUPER TUESDAY\n\nDemocratic presidential candidates appear to live in the future. Sen. Bernie Sanders, for example, has hired two dozen staffers in California, Joseph R. Biden is deploying staff to North Carolina, while Sen. Elizabeth Warren has already made stops in Alabama, Minnesota and Tennessee.\n\nAll of the Democratic hopefuls will spend much of the next four months stumping in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina \u2014 the states that jumpstart the 2020 nominating contest next February.\n\n\u201cThe leading campaigns are beginning to look ahead, ramping up their organizations for the 16 contests that are set to take place on March 3, known as Super Tuesday. More than 1,300 pledged delegates will be up for grabs that day \u2014 roughly 40% of the total pot. That\u2019s easily the most of any day of the Democratic primary, meaning the results in those states could provide whichever candidate comes out on top with a clear path to the nomination,\u201d writes David Catanese, national political correspondent for McClatchy DC.\n\nSimple math explains all.\n\n\u201cThe delegates available on Super Tuesday amount to more than eight times the number that can be captured in the first four states. Formidable showings in the two biggest states voting that day, California and Texas, could propel a candidate into a delegate lead. Minnesota, the sixth-most populous Super Tuesday state, still offers more delegates than Iowa and New Hampshire combined,\u201d Mr. Catanese notes.\n\nUNPREDICTABLE IOWA\n\nPete Buttigieg was once was seen as a likable longshot in the Democratic presidential nomination race. Not any more.\n\nThe South Bend, Indiana, mayor is now within striking distance of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren in the first-in-the-nation Iowa caucuses, according to a Suffolk University/USA Today Poll conducted last week and released Monday.\n\nAnd the numbers: Mr. Biden has 18% support, Ms. Warren is at 17% and Mr. Buttigieg at 13% among 500 likely Democratic caucusgoers, the poll found.\n\nGIVE IT A REST\n\nIt plagues the nation\u2019s capital, no doubt. You\u2019ll find it everywhere, however \u2014 and that\u2019s not good. We\u2019re talking \u201coverthinking\u201d \u2014 or endlessly ruminating and mulling over the often normal complexities of human life.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a curse that many of us can\u2019t seem to break, but, it turns out that overthinking is actually really bad for your health. A study conducted at Harvard Medical School found that excessive brain activity could lead to a shorter life,\u201d reports Aisha Victoria Deeb, an analyst for Mashable.com.\n\n\u201cResearchers used a sample of people ranging in age from 60s and 70s and compared their brains to those who lived to be 100 years or older. The results showed study that those who died at younger ages had significantly lower levels of a protein called REST (RE-1 Silencing Transcription), which quietens brain activity. In short, excessive thinking causes excessive brain activity, leading to a depletion in the protein REST,\u201d writes Ms. Deeb.\n\nREST itself has also been studied and results determined that it can protect against Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\n\u201cSo there\u2019s something extra to think about while you\u2019re replaying arguments from five years ago in your head tonight,\u201d she advises.\n\nSTUCK THIRD PLACE SINCE DAN RATHER\n\nA big bet by \u201cCBS Evening News\u201d on anchor Norah O\u2019Donnell is beginning to look shaky.\n\n\u201cThe former \u2018CBS This Morning\u2019 host \u2014 who is getting paid at least $7 million a year by CBS News boss Susan Zirinsky to revive the perennially third-ranked newscast \u2014 is getting hammered in the ratings worse than her predecessors did,\u201d reports the New York Post.\n\nIn the last week alone, the number of Ms. O\u2019Donnell\u2019s total viewers fell 17% to 5.1 million, according to Nielsen Media Research, and the slide has \u201csteadily accelerated\u201d in the last four weeks.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a troubling sign for CBS, whose evening newscast has been stuck in third place since the tail end of Dan Rather\u2019s tenure, which ended in controversy over his reporting about President George W. Bush\u2019s military service,\u201d the Post points out.\n\nPOLL DU JOUR\n\n\u2022 34% of Americans say \u201cgovernment, poor leadership and politicians\u201d is the most important problem in the U.S. today.\n\n\u2022 13% say immigration is the most important problem.\n\n\u2022 6% cite race relations, 5% cite health care.\n\n\u2022 5% cite \u201cunifying the country\u201d as the top problem, 4% cite environmental issues.\n\n\u2022 3% cite lack of ethics and \u201cfamily decline,\u201d 3% cite \u201clack of respect for one another.\u201d\n\n\u2022 3% cite poverty and homelessness, 2% the \u201ccourts and laws.\u201d\n\nSource: A Gallup poll of 1,526 U.S. adults conducted October 1-13 and released Monday.\n\n\u2022 Kindly follow Jennifer Harper on Twitter @HarperBulletin.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
