Barbie will have a traditional scull motif on her face and Monarch butterflies in her hair. Video Elephant\n\nThe last time The Children's Museum of Indianapolis devoted a temporary exhibit to Barbie was for the toy's 50th anniversary.\n\nPeople spent hours inside admiring Barbie's delightful vintage gowns and Andy Warhol's painting of the iconic doll.\n\nIn fact, so many visited that the museum extended the exhibition \u2014 twice, reports the Indianapolis Star, which is part of the USA TODAY Network. Barbie's world remained on display for almost two and a half years, from December 2009 until March 2012.\n\nNow the museum is building a brand new traveling exhibit focused on the toy, called \"Barbie: You Can Be Anything.\" It will open in May and remain in Indianapolis for a year before it tours North America.\n\nA girl with a gavel: Barbie debuts judge dolls\n\nThe 2020 experience will keep the best of its predecessor, like showing generations of Barbies over the decades, but it also will take a close look at the hundreds of careers she's had. The point \u2014 what toy company Mattel calls the Dream Gap Project \u2014 is to remind girls that those possibilities exist for them, too.\n\n\"When you're young and you're playing, you can be a rocket scientist, you can be a teacher, you can be anything. But then at some point, the gap narrows. In particular, we know that after third grade for girls, it narrows more quickly than boys,\" said Jennifer Pace Robinson, the museum's vice president of experience development and family learning.\n\nMore: New Barbie line includes dolls that use a wheelchair, prosthetic limbs\n\nThe Children's Museum of Indianapolis showcased \"Barbie: The Fashion Experience\" as a temporary exhibit in 2009. A new Barbie exhibit is in the works now, which will open in 2020.

Nearby will be a display on the history of Ruth Handler, who developed Barbie for her daughter during the 1950s, when baby dolls flooded the girls' toy market.\n\nMattel: The company that created Barbie is introducing a line of gender-neutral dolls\n\nThe exhibit will tie into Mattel's initiatives to empower girls. The company continues to develop a line of Sheroes, or role models, that comprise athletes, journalists, artists, activists, scientists, filmmakers and more. The Children's Museum will pull from that list to build displays about powerful women, Pace Robinson said.\n\nMany of the Barbies will come from the museum's own collection. Other items will come from Mattel, she said. The 2020 exhibit will be the fourth time the museum has partnered with the toy company. Previous collaborations include the 2009 Barbie exhibit, along with showings of Hot Wheels cars and the science of auto racing.\n\nD\u00cda de Los Muertos: Barbie officially launches a Day of the Dead doll, and she is glorious\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/news/2019/10/29/barbie-museum-exhibit-kicks-off-in-indianapolis-in-2020-mattel/2498467001/", "description": "The Children's Museum of Indianapolis is building a traveling Barbie exhibit.
