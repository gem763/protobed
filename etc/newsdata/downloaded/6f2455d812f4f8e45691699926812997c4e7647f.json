So to ignore it is making a statement there.\"\n\nTeacher Chris Dier says held a mock impeachment trial in his high school history class because he wants the students to understand the history that's being made right now. (Jenna Riess/Submitted by Chris Dier)\n\nChalmette is in St. Bernard Parish just southeast of New Orleans. During the 2016 presidential election, Trump won the parish with 65 per cent of the vote. But teenagers, of course, don't always align politically with their parents' views.\n\nDier says he didn't face any pushback from parents about the exercise.\n\n\"Most parents, I think, want their students to be challenged and engaged on these topics. I think their concern is how the topics are presented,\" Dier said.\n\n\"Once they realize that it's presented in a manner that's not one way or another, then I think most parents are are OK with it.\"\n\n'Senators for the day'\n\nDier says he doesn't tell his students what to think, but rather teaches them how to think critically. And first and foremost, that means getting informed.\n\nThe students' first task was to read the primary sources associated with the impeachment inquiry at the time \u2014 namely the anonymous whistleblower complaint that triggered the whole thing, and the summary released by the White House of the phone call between Trump and Zelensky.\n\nAt the heart of the inquiry \u2014 both in Chalmette and Washington \u2014 is whether Trump committed any impeachable offences by allegedly pressuring Ukraine to dig up dirt that would ultimately harm Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.\n\nUnder the U.S. Constitution, the president can be removed from office for \"treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanours.\"\n\nWhat exactly that means is unclear. Historically, it can encompass corruption and other abuses of the public's trust.\n\nThe students' discussion came before the Bill Taylor, the acting U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, testified that Trump demanded the U.S. withhold vital military to Ukraine unless Zelensky vowed publicly to investigate the Democrats.\n\nChris Dier's high school senior history class at Chalmette High School in Louisiana. (Submitted by Chris Dier)\n\nOnce they had done their homework, Dier divided the classroom into three sections: pro-impeachment, anti-impeachment and undecided.\n\nThe pros and cons then made their cases, inviting the undecided students to get up and join their sides.\n\n\"I told them that they were senators for the day and they had to present their case, one side or the other,\" Dier said.\n\nThe students came armed with a myriad of perspectives.\n\nJihad Thabata was convinced to join the anti-impeachment side of the room, concluding there's no evidence Trump's phone call with Zelensky amounted to misconduct.\n\n\"Show me where this says it's illegal,\" he said, according to the New York Times.\n\nChance Beck, who argued in favour of impeachment, said corruption at the highest office cannot be tolerated.\n\n\"It's not morally or politically correct for a president to be able to use national power or national aid that we give to Ukraine for a personal favour,\" Beck is quoted as saying.\n\nTwo-thirds for impeachment\n\nIn the end, 14 students voted to impeach the president, and seven voted against it.\n\n\"Which, interestingly enough is an exact 67 per cent \u2014 the two-thirds needed,\" Dier said.\n\nCurrently, six committees from the Democratic-dominated House of Representatives are leading the impeachment inquiry behind closed doors.\n\nIf a simple majority votes bring charges against Trump under the articles of impeachment, he will face trial in the Republican-dominated Senate, where it would require at least two-thirds of members to vote to impeach.\n\nWhile the actual impeachment process has seen mudslinging on all sides, Dier said the mock trial was refreshingly civil.\n\n\"They were incredibly cordial with one another throughout the entire process,\" he said.\n\n\"It's fascinating because I go home and I turn on the TV or look at my phone and I just see so much bickering and people attacking one another \u2014 but my students were so respectful.\"\n\nWritten by Sheena Goodyear with files from Reuters.
