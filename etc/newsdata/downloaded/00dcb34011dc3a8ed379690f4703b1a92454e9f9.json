REUTERS/Zohra Bensemra/File Photo\n\nALGIERS (Reuters) - Algerian Prime Minister Noureddine Bedoui will resign soon to facilitate the holding of elections this year that the army sees as the only way to end a standoff over months of protests, two senior sources told Reuters on Tuesday.\n\nBedoui\u2019s departure is a major demand of protesters, who in April forced long-time president Abdelaziz Bouteflika to quit, and who have rejected fresh elections until there is a more thorough change of the power structure.\n\nArmy chief Lieutenant General Ahmed Gaed Saleh said last week that the electoral commission should by Sept. 15 call an election, a move that would trigger a 90-day countdown to the vote.\n\nThe mass demonstrations began in February and have continued since Bouteflika\u2019s departure, with the loose-knit movement demanding that all figures associated with him also leave and that the army play a smaller role in state affairs.\n\nThe election had been scheduled for July, but was postponed as a result of the crisis, leaving oil- and gas-exporter Algeria in a constitutional deadlock.\n\nOver the summer the authorities have made concessions by arresting more prominent figures linked to Bouteflika on corruption charges, while increasing the pressure on protesters with tougher policing.\n\nProtests continue on Tuesdays and Fridays but at a smaller level than during the first months of the year, when hundreds of thousands of people regularly marched through central Algiers.", "description": "Algerian Prime Minister Noureddine Bedoui will resign soon to facilitate the holding of elections this year that the army sees as the only way to end a standoff over months of protests, two senior sources told Reuters on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190910&t=2&i=1428303285&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8910B-OZATP", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
