As momentum from the lows pales in comparison to the decline from 7441 to 7000, the rebound still looks corrective. Furthermore, yesterday\u2019s high is now trading just below the 200-day EMA (and between the 50-200 EMA zone) and stopped just shy of the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level. Therefore upside could be limited unless we see a global rebound across equities. For now, bears could look to fade into an area of weakness and seek signs of a top. After which the 7132 and 7000 lows come into focus for the bear-camp.\n\nAvast PLC Daily Chart\n\nAvast CFD/DFT (AVST): Trading just off its record high after breaking out of a symmetrical triangle, we\u2019re waiting for the price to consolidate or pull back for a better entry. Up 43.5% YTD, the software and security company has outperformed the FTSE 350 this year, and it looks like momentum is just ramping up. However, given the bearish hammer and extended distance from the eMA\u2019s, we\u2019d prefer to see a higher low from before assuming new highs and trend continuation.\n\nBAE Systems PLC Daily Chart\n\nBA Systems CFD/DFT (BA): A potential head and shoulders top is forming, although it\u2019s neckline are just above the 200-day EMA and 530 support. Whilst this means support around 530 could be a tougher nut to crack, it becomes more significant if it does break, or could still provide a bullish setup over the near-term if it bounces instead. Bears could wait for a break below 530 to assume the H&S has been confirmed and target 500, whereas bulls could target the upper gap around 550.\n\nGreggs PLC Daily Chart\n\nGreggs CFD/DFT (GRG): In some ways, Greggs is similar to the setup on Starbucks we highlighted on Monday. It\u2019s recently broken beneath the 200-day EMA and bounced back towards this level. Indeed, bearish swing traders could look for a move towards 1718 low whilst prices hold beneath the 1900 area. Also, note that the 20 and 50-day eMA\u2019s could cap as dynamic resistance and that the recent \u2018rebound\u2019 has been seen in lower volume (meaning it\u2019s more likely corrective). A break below 1718 assumes a run towards 1500.\n\nBulls may point towards a potential inverted H&S, although we\u2019d want to see prices back above 1954 before assuming the corrective low from 2496 high is in.\n\nPRICE ACTION UPDATE: FTSE Pauses At Resistance | CWK, CTEC, IMB\n\nCranswick CFD/DFT: Since breakout out from its 12-month basing pattern, the breakout climbed to a 12-month high. Yet momentum has clearly turned so this on now on the back burner, although we\u2019ll monitor to see if it can build a new level of support above 3116 (breakout level) before reconsidering longs, to target the 3500 high.\n\nConvatec Group PLC CFD/DTF: The break above 188 failed to hold up and by the close, produced a key reversal day back below resistance. This is on the back burner for now but, given its create support around 180 (potential higher low) then we\u2019d reconsider if it were to break back above 191.15\n\nImperial Brands CFD/DFT: It remains on the watchlist as it\u2019s consolidating after a fall to a new cycle low. Traders could look for a break of 1800 to assume a bearish trend continuation. The 1736.2 low is the initial target, although, given the strength of the bear trend overall, an eventual break low remains the bias. Alternatively, traders could fade into moves below the 1929.2 gap high \u2013 above here, and bulls would likely look to close the gap up to the 2000 area.\n\nJD Sports Fashion plc CFD/DFT: Trading just off its record highs in a tight flag pattern and found support at its 10-day EMA. It\u2019s one of the stronger performers this year in the FTSE, and the daily trend remains bullish above 717.\n\nSegro PLC CFD/DFT: It hit an 11-year high on Tuesday but, if you\u2019re not in, it may be time to wait for a retracement given the shooting star on the daily chart. A bullish engulfing candle marks a higher low at 804.6, so we\u2019d like to see a new level of support build above the 800-804 region before reconsidering longs.\n\nAveva Group plc CFD/DFT: After finally breaking out of its corrective (bearish) channel, prices charged for 4,000 on Tuesday. However, a bearish hammer with a wide-body warns of the need for a retracement, so now look for either 3800 to hold as support, or somewhere around a new bullish trendline projected from the September low. Given the longer-term bull trend, it remains firmly on our bullish watchlist.\n\n\"Disclaimer: The information and opinions in this report are for general information use only and are not intended as an offer or solicitation with respect to the purchase or sale of any currency or CFD contract.
