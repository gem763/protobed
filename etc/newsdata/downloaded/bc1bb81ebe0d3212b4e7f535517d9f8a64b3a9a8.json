Our editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner, said: \u201cWe want to ensure that we are being scientifically precise, while also communicating clearly with readers on this very important issue\u201d. These are the guidelines provided to our journalists and editors to be used in the production of all environment coverage across the Guardian\u2019s website and paper:\n\nThe urgency of climate crisis needed robust new language to describe it | Paul Chadwick Read more\n\n1.) \u201cclimate emergency\u201d or \u201cclimate crisis\u201d to be used instead of \u201cclimate change\u201d\n\nClimate change is no longer considered to accurately reflect the seriousness of the overall situation; use climate emergency or climate crisis instead to describe the broader impact of climate change. However, use climate breakdown or climate change or global heating when describing it specifically in a scientific or geophysical sense eg \u201cScientists say climate breakdown has led to an increase in the intensity of hurricanes\u201d.\n\n\n\n2.) \u201cclimate science denier\u201d or \u201cclimate denier\u201d to be used instead of \u201cclimate sceptic\u201d\n\nThe OED defines a sceptic as \u201ca seeker of the truth; an inquirer who has not yet arrived at definite conclusions\u201d. Most \u201cclimate sceptics\u201d, in the face of overwhelming scientific evidence, deny climate change is happening, or is caused by human activity, so \u2018denier\u2019 is more accurate.\n\n3.) Use \u201cglobal heating\u201d not \u201cglobal warming\u201d\n\n\u2018Global heating\u2019 is more scientifically accurate. Greenhouse gases form an atmospheric blanket that stops the sun\u2019s heat escaping back to space.\n\n\n\n4.) \u201cgreenhouse gas emissions\u201d is preferred to \u201ccarbon emissions\u201d or \u201ccarbon dioxide emissions\u201d. Although carbon emissions is not inaccurate, if we\u2019re talking about all gases that warm the atmosphere, this term recognises all of the climate-damaging gases, including methane, nitrogen oxides, CFCs etc.\n\n5.) Use \u201cwildlife\u201d, not \u201cbiodiversity\u201d\n\nWe felt that \u2018wildlife\u2019 is a much more accessible word and is fair to use in many stories, and is a bit less clinical when talking about all the creatures with whom we share the planet.\n\n\n\n6.) Use \u201cfish populations\u201d instead of \u201cfish stocks\u201d\n\nThis change emphasises that fish do not exist solely to be harvested by humans \u2013 they play a vital role in the natural health of the oceans.\n\nToday we pledge to give the climate crisis the attention it demands | Katharine Viner Read more\n\nSince we announced these changes, they have been reported widely, shared across social media channels, and even prompted some other media outlets to reconsider the terms they use in their own coverage.\n\nThe update to the Guardian\u2019s style guide, originally announced earlier this year, followed the addition of the global carbon dioxide level to the Guardian\u2019s daily weather pages \u2013 the simplest measure of how the mass burning of fossil fuels is disrupting the stable climate. To put it simply, while weather changes daily, climate changes over years and decades. So alongside the daily carbon count, we publish the level in previous years for comparison, as well as the pre-industrial-era baseline of 280ppm, and the level seen as manageable in the long term of 350ppm.\n\nIn order to keep below 1.5C of warming, the aspiration of the world\u2019s nations, we need to halve emissions by 2030 and reach zero by mid century. It is also likely we will need to remove CO2 from the atmosphere, perhaps by the large-scale restoration of nature. It is a huge task, but we hope that tracking the daily rise of CO2 will help to maintain focus on it.\n\n\n\nViner said: \u201cPeople need reminding that the climate crisis is no longer a future problem \u2013 we need to tackle it now, and every day matters.\u201d\n\n\n\nAccess the Guardian and Observer style guide\n\n\n\nSign up to the Green Light email\n\n", "description": "A short glossary of the changes we\u2019ve made to the Guardian\u2019s style guide, for use by our journalists and editors when writing about the environment", "authors": ["Sophie Zeldin-O'Neill"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a5653b17b095bae6589269858e7539c2fa1bb04/0_186_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bd63ca61a67603d302dd893d22cb88ad", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
