Warren Davidson (R) has said that Facebook adding Bitcoin (BTC) to its Calibra wallet would be a \u201cway better idea\u201d than creating its new currency, Libra.\n\nIn an interview for the Noded Bitcoin podcast on Oct. 11, the Congressman said that \u201cpart of the beauty\u201d of Facebook\u2019s unveiling its proposed Libra stablecoin is that it crystallized all of the problems that already exist on the social media platform today.\n\n\u201cDo we want filtered transactions or freedom?\u201d\n\nDavidson argued that the Congressional hearings devoted to Libra this July had compounded the intense pressure Facebook is already under, noting that \u201ca lot of the questions weren\u2019t even about Libra.\u201d\n\nHe said that the social media titan\u2019s bid to launch a proprietary cryptocurrency had served to intensify focus on many of the platform\u2019s existing operations, arguing that:\n\n\u201dFacebook already filters content \u2014 some people say with bias, some people say it\u2019s great, they\u2019re protecting my safe space [...] So do we want filtered speech or free speech? Do we want filtered transactions or freedom?\u201d\n\nPodcast host Pierre Rochard argued that the Congressional hearings had nonetheless been an ideal vehicle through which observers \u2014 many of them hailing from the traditional financial sector \u2014 were able to come to a better understanding of Bitcoin through coming to realize the problems inherent to a centralized and private initiative such as Libra.\n\nDavidson agreed that this had been the effect on many he had spoken to, yet also noted that for those convinced of the need for central authorities as stewards of global finance, the hearings only cemented their antagonism toward distributed ledgers and decentralized cryptocurrencies, and intensified their desire to crack down on the space more broadly.\n\nLibra \u2014 as a means of payment \u2014 could undoubtedly destabilize the status quo, Davidson said, pointing to the fluidity with which monolithic tech giants such as Facebook and Google almost begin to acquire quasi-sovereign properties, challenging governments\u2019 authority.\n\nLibra focuses attention on Facebook\u2019s prior failings\n\nDuring the congressional hearings devoted to Libra this July, U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters \u2014 chair of the United States House of Representatives\u2019 Financial Services Committee \u2014 made the explicit connection between concerns raised during earlier Facebook controversies and the platform\u2019s bid to launch a stablecoin.\n\nWaters had already requested that Facebook halt work on Libra in the middle of June, soon after the project\u2019s unveiling.\n\nShe contended that the tech giant had a \u201cdemonstrated pattern of failing to keep consumer data private\u201d and that it had \u201callowed malicious Russian state actors to purchase and target ads\u201d to \u2014 purportedly \u2014 influence the 2016 U.S. presidential elections.\n\nU.S. lawmakers have also pointedly asked Facebook how they could be expected to trust a firm whose collection, storage and misuse of customer data had landed it a $5 billion penalty.", "description": "United States Rep.
