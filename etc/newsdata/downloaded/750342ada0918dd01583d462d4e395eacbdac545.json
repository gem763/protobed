But price hikes on the foods covered by the new tariffs are only part of the story: Ripple effects could mean higher prices on other items at stores or in restaurants, as people up and down the food chain make up for the new costs, experts say.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe vagaries of the marketplace mean the tariff increases won\u2019t result in a uniform price bump. All of which this week sent wine and food buyers, distributors and restaurateurs into a fog of uncertainty that\u2019s thicker than a creamy Greek yogurt (which is also on the list).\n\nAfter markups on a product whose cost is going up by a quarter, retail prices for wine could go up as much as 40 percent on the shelves, predicts Guillaume Touton, who owns New York-based wine importer Monsieur Touton Selection. Touton says French wines made up almost half of the wine he sold last year, but he\u2019s prepared to start looking at wines from other countries if people aren\u2019t willing to pay higher prices.\n\n\u201cI have 220 salespeople, and I have to feed them and find them something to sell,\u201d he says. \u201cIf the customer does not follow the price, then I will buy more from Chile, or Argentina, or New Zealand.\u201d\n\nFor someone like Sebastian Zutant, co-owner and resident wine guy at Primrose in Washington\u2019s Brookland neighborhood, the choices aren\u2019t as vast. His bistro almost exclusively offers French varietals, many obscure, and often at really good prices, which means he operates on margins with little room to absorb price hikes. He joked this week with his colleagues about changing the restaurant\u2019s concept to an all-American one. \u201cI could call it Dump Trump Wines,\u201d he said. But he said he isn\u2019t sure yet how he\u2019ll actually deal with the changes. \u201cWe\u2019ll figure out a way.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTom Wark, executive director of the National Association of Wine Retailers, says, \u201cEverybody gets to share the pain.\u201d That includes consumers, who will see price increases, and retailers, whose sales are likely to go down as a result. Tariffs might be intended to pressure or punish trading partners, but Wark says they will take a toll closer to home. \u201cMy members have told us that there is no doubt tariffs will hurt them because it will hurt their sales.\u201d\n\nOtherwise, there was little certainty to be found. \u201cWe are just in the process of working out the consequences,\u201d said one exporter of French wines. \u201cIt\u2019s very, very complicated.\u201d\n\nFabio Trabocchi, whose Washington-based restaurant group owns five Italian restaurants and a Spanish one, says he has not yet heard from his purveyors what the new tariffs will mean. \u201cIt\u2019s a waiting game,\u201d he says. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a plan, and there might have to be a period of adjustment \u2014 we just don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nEven if your favorite beverage or food wasn\u2019t targeted, its price could still go up.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDean Gold, a retired D.C. restaurant owner and former buyer for grocery giant Whole Foods, says large importers can shift the costs of the new tariffs around. If a company decides, for example, that it doesn\u2019t want to kill demand for Scotch (also among the items set for an increase), it can keep its whisky prices the same and make up the cost elsewhere. \u201cThey might offset it by raising prices of Japanese whiskey or a U.S. product, or something else from a non-tariffed country to manage the overall balance of their portfolios,\u201d says Gold, who also trained as an economist.\n\nBig buyers with enough leverage can also negotiate lower prices with providers, experts say. \u201cIf you have market power, you can go to your supplier and see if you can get them to eat part of it,\u201d says Bill Reinsch, who holds the Scholl Chair in International Business at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cIf you\u2019re Walmart, you can say, \u2018If you want me to keep buying these large quantities, you\u2019re going to have to lower your prices to help make up for it.\u2019 \u201d\n\nPart of the uncertainty swirling around the world of imported food and beverage has to do with how long the new tariffs will stay in place. Reinsch says many observers expect the United States and European Union eventually will negotiate on them, with Europe awaiting a World Trade Organization decision next year in a separate airline dispute that could mean it\u2019s permitted to levy tariffs on U.S. goods.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut such talks could take time \u2014 and there is historical precedent for food-related tariffs that started out as salvos in a trade war but ultimately became permanent fixtures. Just look at the \u201cChicken War\u201d of the 1960s, which started when France and West Germany slapped a tariff on cheap American poultry. The United States responded by levying a similar tariff on products from those countries, including the popular French tipple brandy (also on trucks, in a bid to hurt German imports).\n\nThe matter was never resolved, and the dueling tariffs remain to this day, offering a cautionary tale for anyone waiting for the current food fight to abate. \u201cYou cannot say for certain this will go away,\u201d Reinsch says. \u201cIt could become the new normal.\u201d\n\nMore from Food:\n\nBrad Pitt is \u2018the Laurence Olivier of eating\u2019 on screen.
