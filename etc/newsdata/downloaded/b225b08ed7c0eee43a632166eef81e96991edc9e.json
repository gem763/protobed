Japan's high-tech toilets bemuse fans", "language": "en", "text": "TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan may not win their home Rugby World Cup but they have already proved themselves world beaters when it comes to toilets.\n\nA person presses a button on the control panel of a Japanese toilet, in Tokyo, Japan September 22, 2019. REUTERS/Lucien Libert\n\nGoing to the loo is a much more futuristic experience in the Land of the Rising Sun and touring fans have been fascinated by their visit to these high-tech \u201cwashlets\u201d.\n\nThese Japanese toilets offer a wide variety of functions. Some open automatically when you approach them and many offer a warm seat for a bit of comfort on cold winter nights.\n\nThe numerous options on the control panel, however, can be confusing.\n\nTwo hours after landing at Tokyo\u2019s Haneda airport, French fan Alex Weimer would not call his first experience a great one.\n\n\u201cThere were something like 15 buttons in Japanese and I didn\u2019t know which one to press. there were strange symbols with sprays going into every direction...\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe flush was on the other side, I frantically pressed all the buttons and it made strange noises.\u201d\n\nIt certainly is not to everyone\u2019s liking.\n\n\u201cA bit too sophisticated for me. I just like the simple one, push the button without all the other experiences,\u201d said All Blacks fan Brent York, although his friend Bernard James felt differently.\n\n\u201cI think when you first encounter them it\u2019s a bit intimidating but we\u2019ve been to Japan many times, now we\u2019re used to them,\u201d said James.\n\n\u201cJapan leads the way in toilets technology.\u201d\n\nHygiene is very important in Japan. People wash their bodies before entering a bath and they take off their shoes when entering their home.\n\nWashlets can be found everywhere in Japan \u2014 in public toilets, hotels and in people\u2019s homes.\n\nKnown for being a tech-savvy population of over 126 million, the market for washlets is huge.\n\nSlideshow (3 Images)\n\nAt toilet manufacturer Toto\u2019s showroom in Tokyo, the latest toilet technology is on display. From the bog standard one to the most advanced, there\u2019s a choice for everyone.\n\nBut it can be expensive. From a starting price of around 25,000 JPY (US$232) some go well over 1 million JPY (US$9,300).\n\nIn any case, come the end of the World Cup, some of the expected 500,000 visitors may be wishing they could take a little part of Japanese technology home with them.", "description": "Japan may not win their home Rugby World Cup but they have already proved themselves world beaters when it comes to toilets.", "authors": ["Lucien Libert", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190924&t=2&i=1433292233&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8N0QO", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
