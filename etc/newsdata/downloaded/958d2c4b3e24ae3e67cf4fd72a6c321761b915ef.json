Residential areas near Eskom\u2019s 15 coal-fired power stations have pollution levels that rival the most contaminated cities on the planet. Environmental activists are suing the government over breaching the constitutional right to clean air because of emissions from Eskom and chemicals company Sasol.\n\nWhile the rise in pollution mainly came from the Kendal and Tutuka power plants, two of Eskom\u2019s biggest, equipment that catches the particles, known as fabric filter bags, was damaged at four plants. Poor quality coal also heightened emissions at three stations.\n\nThe company\u2019s particulate emissions surged to a measure of 0.47 kilograms per megawatt hour sent out in the year to March 31, almost double the 0.27 kilograms in fiscal 2018 and well above a 0.33 target. Water consumption jumped 8% to 1.41 liters per kilowatt hour sent out.
