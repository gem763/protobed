Chinese tariffs on U.S. soybeans, pork, corn and other agricultural commodities have had a major impact on U.S. farmers.\n\nStill, Trump told reporters earlier on Wednesday that he welcomed the action.\n\n\u201cI think they did the right thing. I think it was good for them,\u201d Trump said in the Oval Office. \u201cBut they took them off, yeah, I think it was a gesture, OK. But it was a big move. People were shocked. I wasn\u2019t shocked.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s decision to delay his latest tariff increase comes as the two sides prepare to hold face-to-face high-level talks in early October for the first time since a meeting in Shanghai in late July.\n\nTrump\u2019s frustration over the lack of progress in the talks prompted him in August to once again escalate tariffs and Beijing to once again respond.\n\nBefore Wednesday\u2019s announcement, tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods were scheduled to rise to 30 percent on Oct. 1, from 25 percent currently. That has now been pushed back two weeks.\n\nIn addition, Trump has begun to impose a 15 percent duty on a further $300 billion worth of Chinese goods. The first batch was hit on Sept. 1 and the second batch will be hit on Dec. 15 unless a deal is reached to end the trade war.\n\nTrump, in his remarks to reporters, repeated his contention that U.S. tariffs that have hit the lion\u2019s share of Chinese imports are causing Beijing to rethink its hardball approach to U.S. demands on intellectual property, market access and other issues.\n\n\u201cTheir supply chain is breaking up,\u201d he said. \u201cThe supply chain of China, which was this unbreakable, powerful tool that they had, it\u2019s breaking up like a toy. Because companies are moving out, and China wants to make a deal. We\u2019ll see what happens. We have to make the right deal for this country.\u201d\n\nAdam Behsudi contributed to this report.", "description": "The move followed China\u2019s announcement that it was exempting 16 items from the retaliatory tariffs it has imposed on American products in response to Trump\u2019s tariff moves.", "authors": ["Doug Palmer"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/35/63/0b4217714bf081338ca7a95b7b71/190911-trump-oval-office-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
