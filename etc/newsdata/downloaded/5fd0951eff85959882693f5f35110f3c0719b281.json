That\u2019s nothing new. But the last two innings, it\u2019s just not right. It\u2019s not right.\u201d\n\nHarper himself did not directly accuse fans of calling out his family, but alluded to it by saying, \u201cI\u2019ve got 60,000 fans up in Philly that appreciate me as a player, appreciate me as an individual and my family.\u201d\n\nBut Harper\u2019s wife Kayla wrote on social media Thursday morning that Nationals fans mentioned Harper\u2019s infant son as part of their heckling.\n\n\u201cPhillies fans might boo him but they don\u2019t bring his 4 week old son into it. Classless,\u201d Kayla Harper wrote.\n\nWhen you bring his son or family into it, yes you\u2019re crossing a line. Stick to your overused overrated and Harper sucks chants if you\u2019re really that loser that goes to a game to heckle someone. Phillies fans might boo him but they don\u2019t bring his 4 week old son into it.

Harper has been booed and heckled in every appearance he\u2019s made at Nationals Park this year.\n\nThe Nationals eliminated the Phillies from playoff contention on Tuesday while clinching a wild card berth for themselves. They\u2019ll play each other for the final time this season Thursday at 4 p.m.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
