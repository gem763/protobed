REUTERS/Remo Casilli\n\nItaly has long complained that it has been left alone to deal with the hundreds of thousands of migrants who have crossed the sea in recent years looking for a better life in Europe.\n\nThe issue has caused particular tensions between Rome and Paris, with Italy complaining that French non-governmental organizations have been instrumental in rescuing migrants but that France has not done enough to help take them in.\n\nBut French President Emmanuel Macron has leapt on the fact that a new, pro-European government has taken office in Italy to try to reset ties and resolve the long-standing row.\n\n\u201cI do not underestimate what Italy has been experiencing since 2015. It has also suffered many misunderstandings and injustices,\u201d Macron told reporters in Rome, standing alongside Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte.\n\n\u201cI am convinced that an automatic European mechanism is needed for the reception of immigrants,\u201d he added.\n\nConte said he had received French backing for a system to handle the redistribution of migrants, meaning that Italy could rely on the entire 28-nation bloc to accept automatically a share of all the new arrivals as soon as they were rescued.\n\nMacron, speaking through an interpreter, said EU countries that refused to take part in the scheme should be \u201cseriously penalized\u201d. They did not provide further details, saying only that the issue would soon be discussed by EU interior ministers.\n\n\u201cThe issue of immigration must no longer fuel anti-European propaganda,\u201d Conte said, referring to his previous coalition partner, the far-right League, which has seen its popularity surge thanks to its anti-migrant agenda.\n\nENDURING FRIENDSHIP\n\nLeague leader Matteo Salvini, who quit the government last month, enabling the pro-European Democratic Party (PD) to take its place within the cabinet, has accused France of reneging on previous migrant deals and said Conte was being naive.\n\n\u201cConte is being made a laughing stock by Macron,\u201d Salvini told reporters on Wednesday, accusing him of betraying Italy.\n\nRelations between Italy and France, traditionally close allies, disintegrated under the previous government, with the then deputy prime ministers Salvini and Luigi Di Maio repeatedly attacking Macron, mostly over immigration.\n\nIn February, Paris withdrew its ambassador to Rome for the first time since World War Two after Di Maio met members of France\u2019s \u201cyellow vest\u201d movement, which has mounted sometimes violent protests against Macron\u2019s liberal economic reforms.\n\nDi Maio subsequently adopted a less hostile approach to France and his 5-Star Movement remains within Conte\u2019s coalition.\n\n\u201cThe Italian-Franco friendship is indestructible. We do not always agree with each other. We might quarrel or fail to see eye-to-eye. But we always get back together,\u201d said Macron, who is the first EU leader to visit Rome since the new government took office last week.\n\nBesides immigration, the two men also presented a united front on another issue that has long been a bone of contention - Libya. Conte said they had agreed to a \u201cjoint initiative\u201d and wanted to see a meeting of all the various warring parties in the north African state in yet another attempt to forge peace.\n\nItaly has previously accused France of undermining its efforts to end the civil war in Libya, but Macron insisted that the two countries were cooperating closely. \u201cThere is a real convergence between France and Italy,\u201d he said.", "description": "The European Union must introduce a new, automatic system of taking in migrants saved from the Mediterranean, the leaders of Italy and France said on Wednesday, as they sought to patch up bruised bilateral relations.", "authors": ["Crispian Balmer", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190918&t=2&i=1431367450&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8H1XF-OCATP", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
