Uber says that through its Works app, pre-vetted workers can select from a range of shifts and opportunities for temporary roles.\n\nEditor's Note: There is no indication that this service will be launching in Australia.\n\n\u201cUber Works app users can get detailed information about shifts they\u2019re interested in, including information about gross pay, work location and skills, or required attire,\u201d the company wrote. \u201cUber Works also serves as a one-stop shop for all time-tracking needs, allowing users to clock in and out and log breaks.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for the company said Uber Works is as of Friday officially available in Chicago. The program has been operating in the city as a pilot over the last year, the spokesperson said, adding that \u201csome\u201d beta testing also took place in Los Angeles. While limited at launch to a single city, Uber states on the Works website that it has \u201cplans to expand to more areas soon.\u201d\n\nUber said in its announcement that for employers, Uber Works will provide a \u201creliable pool of vetted and qualified workers.\u201d For workers, Uber said the platform will \u201censure timely payments\u201d and provide \u201cmore transparency and opportunities for feedback in the marketplace.\u201d The company spokesperson told Gizmodo that workers are paid out within 48 hours following their completed shift.\n\nIn order to keep both parties accountable, Uber Works stated in its user guidelines that businesses may not require workers to perform jobs or tasks other than what was pre-outlined in the gig description and shouldn\u2019t cancel shifts less than 24 hours before their scheduled to begin unless it\u2019s \u201cunavoidable.\u201d\n\nAs for workers, Uber Works will operate on a kind of strike system, with six strikes within a rolling 30-day window resulting in getting kicked off the app for seven days and 10 strikes within 30 days leading to a permanent ban. Here\u2019s how Uber Works scores attendance and reliability under that system:\n\n2 marks for every 15 minutes late, up to 5 marks\n\n2 marks for cancelling 2 hours to 24 hours before a shift start\n\n3 marks for cancelling 30 minutes to 2 hours before a shift start\n\n4 marks for being sent home early due to behaviour or uniform issues\n\n6 marks for cancelling less than 30 minutes before a shift start or for a no-call, no-show.\n\nUber Works states that two no-shows without notifying the hiring company during a 12-month window will also result in a permanent ban from the app. Workers are expected to show up in \u201cproper attire\u201d and do the work as it was described by the employer, the company said.\n\nUber said it\u2019s partnered with the U.S. staffing agency TrueBlue, which it notes \u201cemploy, pay and handle worker benefits,\u201d among other agencies. The Uber spokesperson said its partner agencies will provide employee benefits to workers as mandated by federal, state and local laws, including for health coverage and workers comp.\n\nThat Uber is seeking to diversify its workforce is not especially shocking given that the company is haemorrhaging money and profitability seems pretty elusive at this stage.\n\nUber Works head Andrey Liscovich told Crain\u2019s Chicago Business that the platform \u201cwill give us a more diverse workforce than our ride-share client base. It will open the platform up to people who want to earn money but who don\u2019t have cars.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the company faces an existential threat in California thanks to the state\u2019s newly passed law, known as AB5, which could reclassify Uber drivers and other gig workers as employees entitled to greater benefits.\n\nUber, which is headquartered in California, dubiously claims that it is a technology company, not a taxi company, and is thus exempt from AB5. The rollout of Uber Works appears to bolster the argument that its primary function is platform development.\n\nNeat as this whole job-on-demand thing sounds on paper, it\u2019s still Uber. And Uber, as history has shown, tends to view human beings as a means of generating more money while it waits out the inevitable automation of service jobs.\n\nIt also hasn\u2019t been entirely forthright or even decent about employee classification for its Uber drivers. Whatever it claims now, there\u2019s little evidence to indicate Uber will go out of its way to do right by its Works gig workers.", "description": "Uber, a company arguably just exploiting human workers while it figures out how to pivot to automation, is evidently looking to expand its labour pool beyond cab drivers and food delivery....", "authors": ["David Nield", "David Tracy"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/f7qpxhtnsbx9kiwesrlb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
