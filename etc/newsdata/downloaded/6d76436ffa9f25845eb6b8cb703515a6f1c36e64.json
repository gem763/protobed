They're afraid others don't take them seriously so they try to overcompensate.\n\nConfident people, on the other hand, aren't afraid to answer questions honestly \u2014 including when they don't know. \"I don't know, but that's a good question\" is a variation of this, as is, \"I'm not sure, but I'll find out.\"\n\nThere's a perception that in order to be a good leader, you need to know the right thing to do all the time. This is a fallacy. You don't need to already know; you need to be willing to discover what it is. You need to be able to listen closely to those who are more educated on the subject than you, and then call the shot.\n\nConfidence isn't about having all the answers; it's about being comfortable seeking them out.", "description": "Truly confident people aren't scared to admit that they don't know something, and don't worry about showing weakness.", "authors": ["Melanie Curtin"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d4adcdb100a24322116d259-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
