(\u201cRoxgold\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) (TSX: ROXG) (OTCQX: ROGFF) is pleased to report its 2019 third quarter (\u201cQ3\u201d) and first nine month ended September 30, 2019 (\u201cYTD 2019\u201d) production results from the Company\u2019s Yaramoko Gold Mine located in Burkina Faso (\u201cYaramoko\u201d).\n\nHighlights:\n\nProduced 33,036 ounces of gold in Q3 for a total of 101,041 ounces YTD 2019\n\nRealized a record quarterly plant throughput of 114,036 tonnes which exceeded increased nameplate capacity of 1,100 tonnes per day (\u201ctpd\u201d) by approximately 13%\n\nCommercial production achieved at Bagassi South in September 2019\n\nCash balance has increased to $29 million at the end of September 2019\n\nJohn Dorward, President and CEO commented, \u201cWe continue to see solid operating performance at Yaramoko with gold production of 101,041 ounces through the first nine months of 2019 driven by consistent outperformance at our processing plant where we achieved record throughput and operated approximately 13% above nameplate capacity in Q3. Over the course of Q3, Roxgold reached a cash inflection point with cash added to the balance sheet following the investment in Bagassi South and the acquisition of our first growth project, S\u00e9gu\u00e9la, earlier in the year. During September, we also achieved commercial production at Bagassi South, our second high grade gold mine at Yaramoko. Increased stoping activity at Bagassi South and higher mined grades are expected to drive a strong fourth quarter of operations with forecast production at the low end of our 2019 guidance.\u201d\n\nOperating Summary:\n\nAt the 55 Zone, 90,311 tonnes of ore were mined at 9.25 grams per tonne (\u201cg/t Au\u201d) and 1,484 metres (\u201cm\u201d) of development were completed. During the quarter, approximately 76% of ore mined came from stoping activities with five open stopes available at the end of the quarter. During the quarter, decline development reached the 4811 level, approximately 511 metres below surface.\n\nAt Bagassi South, commercial production was achieved in September. During the quarter, 41,055 tonnes of ore were mined and 1,679 m of development were completed at Bagassi South. Yaramoko is expected to produce a strong Q4 due to increased stoping operations mining higher grade ore at Bagassi South with forecast production at the low end of our 2019 guidance.\n\nThe plant processed a record 114,036 tonnes at an average head grade of 9.1 g/t Au for the quarter. Plant availability was 93.2% and overall recovery remained high at 98.0%. The plant throughput rate has consistently exceeded the nameplate capacity of 1,100 tpd following the completion of the Bagassi South expansion resulting in throughput rates exceeding nameplate capacity by approximately 13% during Q3.\n\nYaramoko Production Metrics\n\nQ3 2019 Q2 2019 Q1 2019 Q4 2018 Q3 2018 Total Development (metres) 3,163 2,926 2,264 1,785 1,479 Ore mined (tonnes) 131,366 109,840 98,140 88,277 87,975 Ore processed (tonnes) 114,036 113,866 106,816 82,241 78,357 Head grade (g/t) 9.1 9.0 10.0 10.8 12.3 Recovery (%) 98.0 98.2 98.3 98.2 98.5 Gold ounces produced 33,036 34,354 33,652 25,844 30,532\n\nUpcoming Catalysts\n\nQ4 \u2013 Further exploration results from S\u00e9gu\u00e9la\n\nQ4 \u2013 Yaramoko regional exploration results\n\nQ4 \u2013 Results of S\u00e9gu\u00e9la Preliminary Economic Assessment (\u201cPEA\u201d)\n\n2019 Third Quarter Financial Results and Conference Call\n\nThe Company will release its 2019 third quarter financial results after market hours on Tuesday, November 12, 2019.\n\nA webcast and conference call to discuss these results will be held on Wednesday, November 13, 2019, at 8:00AM Eastern time.

Such forward-looking statements include, without limitation: statements with respect to future production estimates, production guidance, anticipated recovery grades, and potential increases in throughput, exploration and development plans, and the expected timing thereof. These statements are based on information currently available to the Company and the Company provides no assurance that actual results will meet management\u2019s expectations. In certain cases, forward-looking information may be identified by such terms as \u201canticipates\u201d, \u201cbelieves\u201d, \u201ccould\u201d, \u201cestimates\u201d, \u201cexpects\u201d, \u201cmay\u201d, \u201cshall\u201d, \u201cwill\u201d, or \u201cwould\u201d. Forward-looking information contained in this news release is based on certain factors and assumptions regarding, among other things, the estimation of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves, the realization of resource estimates and reserve estimates, gold metal prices, the timing and amount of future exploration and development expenditures, the estimation of initial and sustaining capital requirements, the estimation of labour and operating costs, the availability of necessary financing and materials to continue to explore and develop the Yaramoko Gold Project in the short and long-term, the progress of exploration and development activities as currently proposed and anticipated, the receipt of necessary regulatory approvals and permits, and assumptions with respect to currency fluctuations, environmental risks, title disputes or claims, and other similar matters, as well as assumptions set forth in the Company\u2019s technical report dated December 20, 2017,and entitled \u201cTechnical Report for the Yaramoko Gold Mine, Burkina Faso\u201d available on the Company\u2019s website at www.roxgold.com and SEDAR at www.sedar.com.

Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in forward-looking statements include: changes in market conditions, unsuccessful exploration results, possibility of project cost overruns or unanticipated costs and expenses, changes in the costs and timing of the development of new deposits, inaccurate reserve and resource estimates, changes in the price of gold, unanticipated changes in key management personnel, failure to obtain permits as anticipated or at all, failure of exploration and/or development activities to progress as currently anticipated or at all, general economic conditions and other risk factors contained in the Company\u2019s annual information form and other disclosure documents available on SEDAR. Mining exploration and development is an inherently risky business. Accordingly, actual events may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.

These and other factors should be considered carefully and readers should not place undue reliance on the Company\u2019s forward-looking statements.
