Kelly may soon wish he could fly.\n\nThe accused pedophile has been moved to general population in his Chicago lockup at his own request, according to prosecutors.\n\nThe \u201cI Wish\u201d singer was transferred out of a solitary housing unit Tuesday following an emergency motion from his attorneys saying their client had been unfairly treated behind bars because he was a celebrity.\n\nThe transfer sparked an irate letter from Chicago prosecutors, who claimed the embattled R&B legend wanted to be in solitary in the first place.\n\n\u201cDefendant stated that the MCC staff told him that he could \u2018try it [general population] in a couple of days to see what it looked like but they can\u2019t guarantee nothing,'\u201d prosecutors wrote, quoting from a recorded phone call Kelly placed on July 19 from Chicago\u2019s Metropolitan Correctional Center, where he\u2019s awaiting trial on child porn charges.\n\n\u201cYou know, and that\u2019s why, I was like, hmmm, too many people up on you and I done seen too many movies, you know,\u201d the crooner allegedly said on the call.\n\nR.
