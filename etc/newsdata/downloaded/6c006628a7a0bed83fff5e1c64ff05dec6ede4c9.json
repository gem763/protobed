We all have \u2019em, but usually they\u2019re \u201cyuck trackies I\u2019ve owned since 2002 when I was 8\u201d or \u201cweird pyjamas with holes in them\u201d. I\u2019m here to tell you \u2013 treat yourself. Invest in some self-care house clothes you could legitimately wear out in public and not look unhinged doing so.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you have to spend a fortune \u2013 although what did I say about treating yourself \u2013 but it does mean matching (at least a bit) and buying things that feel nice when you wear them. I don\u2019t mean nice like warm-blankie nice, I mean you feel pulled together in these threads.\n\nSee also: good things to wear if you work from home, things to wear if you live in a sharehouse and have a crush on your housemate, things to wear when your new bf/gf is coming over and you\u2019re not ready to reveal your full grot self yet.
