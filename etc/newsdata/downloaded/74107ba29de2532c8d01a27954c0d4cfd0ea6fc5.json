Among arms controllers, Morrison\u2019s name is equivalent to Keyser S\u00f6ze. A former State Department official called him \u201cthe hardlinest of the hardline on nuclear policy.\u201d\n\nLike Bolton\u2014and like Keyser S\u00f6ze\u2014Morrison is effective. From behind the scenes on Capitol Hill, Morrison drove the biggest developments on nuclear weapons issues over the past decade.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever wondered how Barack Obama, who once talked about a nuclear-free world, ended up agreeing to pour cash into nuclear modernization, part of the explanation is that Morrison, then working for Sen. Jon Kyl (R-AZ), ate Obama\u2019s lunch during a treaty negotiation.\n\nMorrison then went over to the House Armed Services Committee, where he pushed new authorities for a nuclear-weapons complex whose budget ballooned, as well as GOP opposition to a host of nuclear-related treaties.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a stridently partisan person who constantly insisted on confrontation with the [Obama] administration,\u201d said a former official at the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA).\n\nA different senior NNSA ex-official said Morrison was needlessly hostile in negotiations: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to uncouple the unpleasant part of Tim from the substantive part, and that\u2019s why you\u2019re hearing this negativity.\u201d\n\nIn addition to his Hill victories, several tweets shared with The Daily Beast from Morrison\u2019s locked account show that he enjoys owning the libs online. His Twitter avatar is a pin showing a red MAGA-style baseball cap reading MAKE DETERRENCE GREAT AGAIN. In one tweet last month, Morrison responded to a tweet from an arms controller about a push from U.S. mayors urging the administration to lead an effort against nuclear war with \u201chahahahahahahahahahahahahaha.\u201d\n\nOn July 9, Morrison departed his longtime perch as policy director for the Republican staff on the House defense panel to work for Bolton as senior director for countering weapons of mass destruction on the National Security Council.\n\nAlthough he called himself \u201cnot one for emotion or sentimentality\u201d in a July 4 email bidding his Hill colleagues farewell, Morrison said leaving the committee was \u201cthe most difficult professional decision I have made to date.\u201d\n\nMorrison\u2019s ascent comes amid a recent senior staff exodus that\u2019s permitting Bolton to reshape the supremely powerful NSC in his own image. Morrison is Bolton without the mustache.\n\nAnd this is their moment. A substantial amount of foreign policy now runs through nuclear-adjacent issues\u2014and some of it through the NSC directly.\n\nThe NSC, not the State Department, is the contact group for dealing with Russia after the Helsinki summit, putting critical arms control issues like a follow-on New START treaty in the portfolio of someone who opposed and then attempted to cripple the arms-reduction accord.\n\nThen there\u2019s North Korea, where some experts expect hawks like Bolton to capitalize on frustration with denuclearization talks.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s Iran and the aftermath of Trump\u2019s breach of the nuclear deal.\n\nIf that wasn\u2019t enough, the Trump administration\u2019s Nuclear Posture Review, which calls for fielding low-yield nuclear weapons, is aligned with Morrison\u2019s way of thinking.\n\nBut a dozen current and former congressional aides, Obama administration officials, and nuclear experts who have dealt with Morrison\u2014allies and adversaries alike\u2014are quick to note a plot twist in Morrison\u2019s ascension.\n\n\u201c He always wanted to be tough on Russia. How will that translate, working in this administration? \u201d \u2014 Former National Nuclear Security Administration official\n\n\u201cHe always wanted to be tough on Russia,\u201d recalled one former National Nuclear Security Administration official. \u201cHow will that translate, working in this administration?\u201d\n\nAnother former senior administration official was blunter: \u201cHe really hates Russia across the board.\u201d\n\nMorrison\u2019s friends profess little insight into how he\u2019ll square the Russia circle with Trump. \u201cFor someone as smart and engaged and gregarious as Tim Morrison is, there has to be a reckoning with what you believe personally and what you\u2019re told to do professionally,\u201d said Thomas C. Moore, a former staffer for Sen. Richard Lugar (R-IN) and a rare on-record source for this piece. \u201cI\u2019d have a lot of trouble saying, \u2018Russia\u2019s great, Russia\u2019s good\u2019 and I\u2019d imagine he would too, but I don\u2019t know if he\u2019ll have to.\u201d\n\nArms controllers take a different view of Russia from much of the #resistance to Trump. To them, the fact that the U.S. and Russia account for the overwhelming majority of the world\u2019s nuclear weapons means that Russia can\u2019t be ignored or isolated. Doing so risks escalating nuclear tensions\u2014which is to say the risk of armageddon\u2014and excessive hostility to Moscow sets back the broader arms-control goal of reducing nuclear weapons and negotiating agreements to constrain various aspects of their operations.\n\nAnd it\u2019s on that point where nuclear hawks like Morrison find endless frustration with arms controllers. According to the State Department\u2014Obama\u2019s as well as Trump\u2019s\u2014Russia is in violation of the Intermediate-Range Forces Treaty (INF), a Reagan-era bilateral accord banning development, testing, and fielding of ballistic and cruise missiles with ranges between 500 and 5,500 kilometers.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the challenge of bilateral agreements left over from the Cold War,\u201d said a congressional staffer who worked with Morrison. \u201cRepublicans are willing to sign, but we don\u2019t have a romantic attachment to them, and we insist they work.\u201d\n\nThis staffer argued that Morrison\u2019s opposition to nuclear arms accords is more pragmatic than ideological. Cold War-era treaties don\u2019t anticipate emerging \u201cholistic\u201d threats like state-sponsored cyberattacks against nuclear command-and-control infrastructure or broader civilian infrastructure.\n\n\u201cIf treaties can help us stop that from happening and disincentivize China and Russia, then by all means, but I think every agreement must be taken into that context\u2014that whole outlook, in a framework of meaningful strategy to bring us back into the peaceful years of the 1990s,\u201d the staffer said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s Tim\u2019s philosophy as well.\u201d\n\nArms controllers see a different pattern. \u201cTim has never met an arms control agreement he liked. He has worked to prevent them from being approved, like New START, and help kill agreements already in place, like the INF agreement,\u201d said Jon Wolfsthal, who had Morrison\u2019s job in the Obama White House. \u201cI worry that he and John Bolton will continue to undermine these agreements instead of using them to help reduce the risk of nuclear conflict and [increase] transparency.\u201d\n\nMorrison declined to comment. A lawyer and Naval Reserve intelligence officer in his early 40s, he came onto the arms-control scene in force while working for Kyl, who in 2010 represented the opposition to the Obama administration\u2019s New START treaty with Russia to cut both nations\u2019 nuclear arsenals.\n\nThe Obama administration badly wanted New START, and its 30 percent cuts to the nuclear stockpile, as a centerpiece of its twin efforts to curb nuclear weapons and engage constructively with Russia.\n\nKyl was its principal GOP interlocutor, and he raised the cost for the treaty. In what pro-treaty Senate staffers from that era remember as a \u201ckabuki\u201d effort, Kyl questioned New START\u2019s impact on missile defense, something the agreement didn\u2019t touch. (The head of the Missile Defense Agency testified in June 2010: \u201cThe New START Treaty does not constrain our plans to execute the U.S. Missile Defense program.\u201d)\n\nBut Kyl won a huge concession in negotiation: $85 billion over ten years for modernizing the aging nuclear weapons stockpile.\n\nSeveral former nuclear-related officials caution that Kyl, and Morrison, had a point on modernization. \u201cThe nuclear complex was really in bad shape,\u201d said one.\n\nTwo former Obama administration officials said that whoever was president at the time would have had to put more money into physical restoration of the nuclear enterprise. But Kyl got a lot, and he knew it.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve probably got all we\u2019re going to get out of them in terms of dollar commitments,\u201d he told The New York Times in November 2010, which described the senator as \u201cexpress[ing] satisfaction.\u201d\n\nKyl, who didn\u2019t respond to a Daily Beast request for comment, got what he wanted\u2014and then voted against New START. The administration managed to pass the treaty in a lame-duck session by a thin margin, and knowledgeable officials don\u2019t think Kyl moved any GOP senators in the treaty\u2019s direction.\n\nAfter the GOP takeover of the House in 2010, Morrison switched over to the House Armed Services Committee. Several current and former congressional aides, as well as administration interlocutors, consider Morrison pivotal to a host of measures, usually in the annual must-pass National Defense Authorization Acts (NDAA), undermining arms control and bolstering nukes.\n\nAmong them were measures to block New START from taking force, including blocking money for treaty-authorized activities. In both 2012 and 2013, the Obama White House issued ultimately empty veto threats over the bill, citing, among other provisions, measures that would \u201cimpinge on the President\u2019s ability to implement the New START Treaty and to set U.S. nuclear weapons policy.\u201d\n\nOne knowledgeable official said that only a provision in a totally separate bill that became law after the 2011-era NDAA passed saved New START. Winning the nuclear funding increase during the treaty passage debate in the Senate clearly wasn\u2019t enough for Morrison.\n\n\u201c It\u2019s Saturday night, have a drink, laugh, tell a dirty joke, something that doesn\u2019t have to do with nuclear weapons for a change. \u201d \u2014 Thomas C. Moore, former staffer for Sen. Richard Lugar (R-IN)\n\nHis friend Moore considers Morrison a workaholic whose face was often glued to his BlackBerry at social events. \u201cIt\u2019s Saturday night, have a drink, laugh, tell a dirty joke, something that doesn\u2019t have to do with nuclear weapons for a change,\u201d Moore said.\n\nSeveral ex-officials, including those who have profound disagreements with Morrison, said he created a legacy on the committee.\n\nThe Department of Energy\u2019s Stockpile Responsiveness Program, a creation of the fiscal 2016 NDAA, is a venue for up-to-date research on nuclear weapons design. A former senior Obama administration official said the program would not exist without Morrison and considered it an incubator for the day when the U.S. will design new warheads.\n\nAs a check on Russia\u2019s INF violations, according to a knowledgeable official, Morrison won authorization for research and development for a mid-range missile unrequested by the Defense Department that would itself violate the treaty.\n\nMorrison also cultivated a constituency within the military\u2019s Strategic Command, the operational end of the U.S. nuclear complex, that sources expect will serve Morrison well at the NSC.\n\nAnd while it would overinflate Morrison\u2019s influence to consider him the critical factor, the nuclear modernization Obama ultimately agreed to spiraled to an estimated cost of $1 trillion over 30 years, and the dynamics of that spending stem significantly from the New START fight.\n\nNot everything Morrison did succeeded. Several current and former Hill and administration officials interviewed for this piece noted that while Morrison frequently got hardline nuclear policies into the House versions of the NDAA, the Senate or conference negotiators often would tone them down. Generally that was the case with what three former Energy Department officials said were Morrison\u2019s efforts to cleave the NNSA from the broader department, which is considered a step to empower nuclear weapons research.\n\nBut Morrison\u2019s allies see his star as unquestionably on the rise.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s part of the next generation of folks who are going to occupy positions in future Republican administrations on nuclear issues,\u201d said Moore, who considers Morrison a likely future undersecretary of defense for policy. \u201cHe carries with him views that are sharp on a number of issues, he has engendered opposition and he\u2019s earned it, if you will, and that\u2019s a hallmark of people who are going on to bigger and better things.\u201d\n\nArms controllers are bracing for that prospect. Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, testified last week that the administration still doesn\u2019t have a position on extending New START. But most people interviewed for this piece believe Morrison will oppose extending or negotiating a follow-on treaty. The NSC declined to discuss Morrison\u2019s new portfolio.\n\n\u201cThe National Security Council staff coordinates the efforts of departments and agencies to support the President. We don\u2019t comment on NSC personnel,\u201d said Garrett Marquis, an NSC spokesperson.\n\n\u201cWhen I heard Tim got the job and was going to NSC, you\u2019re like, \u2018holy shit,\u2019\u201d said a former senior NNSA official, \u201cbut on the other hand, who else are they going to get these days to do that job?\u201d", "description": "Meet Tim Morrison, who\u2019s going to handle arms control\u2014or, rather, stop arms control\u2014for John Bolton.
