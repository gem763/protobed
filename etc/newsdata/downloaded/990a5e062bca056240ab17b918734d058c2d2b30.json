It was not the case. But this record is a great reward after so many years and it\u2019s a great source of huge pride.\n\n\u201cI am emotional every time I put on this shirt. That will not change and I hope to continue doing so for many years.\u201d\n\nRamos is now only eight caps short of the European record held by Italian stopper Gianluigi Buffon (176) and 16 adrift of Egyptian Ahmed Hassan\u2019s world record of 184.", "description": "Oslo (AFP) \u2013 Sergio Ramos broke the Spanish international appearances record on Saturday as he won his 168th cap in a 1-1 draw against Norway to", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/12/b21e89_sergio-ramos-takes-on-norway-defender-omar-elabdellaoui-huge-pride-as-ramos-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
