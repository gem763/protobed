REUTERS/Leah Millis\n\n(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump will announce plans to change healthcare regulations on Wednesday to loosen anti-kickback provisions that restrict the kinds of outside services providers can refer patients to, administration officials said.\n\nTrump will explain how the new rules advance his broader healthcare agenda, which includes reducing regulatory burdens and promoting innovative ways to reimburse healthcare providers, in a speech in Minnesota, the officials said.\n\nThe plan will change how the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) enforces the Physician Self Referral Law, also known as the Stark law, which penalizes healthcare providers for referring patients to outside services that the provider could stand to benefit from financially.\n\nHHS will create exceptions for healthcare providers that enter into agreements with other parties if they are aimed at cutting costs and improving patient health, the officials said.\n\nTrump issued an executive order last week that sought to woo seniors by strengthening the Medicare health program.\n\nThe order was the Republican president\u2019s answer to Democrats like Bernie Sanders, who is running to become the party\u2019s nominee in the 2020 presidential election and is promoting the idea of Medicare for all Americans.\n\nThe Trump administration has also rolled out measures in recent months designed to curtail drug prices and address other problems in the U.S. healthcare system.\n\nPolicy experts say the efforts are unlikely to slow the rise of drug prices in a meaningful way, however.", "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump will announce plans to change healthcare regulations on Wednesday to loosen anti-kickback provisions that restrict the kinds of outside services providers can refer patients to, administration officials said.", "authors": ["Carl O", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1438824782&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF98120", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
