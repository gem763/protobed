Will Hurd calls Trump's China comments 'terrible'", "language": "en", "text": "Rep. Will Hurd, Texas Republican, on Friday criticized President Trump\u2019s suggestion a day earlier that China should investigate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden and his son.\n\n\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s terrible - it\u2019s something that I wouldn\u2019t have done,\u201d Mr. Hurd said on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe also said Mr. Trump\u2019s wishing China \u201ccongratulations on 70 years of communism via tweet\u201d is something he wouldn\u2019t do, either.\n\n\n\nOn Thursday, Mr. Trump had said: \u201cChina should start an investigation into the Bidens, because what happened [in] China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine.\u201d\n\n\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s allies have raised questions recently about Hunter Biden, Mr. Biden\u2019s son, and his role on the board of a Ukrainian energy company.\n\n\n\nAuthor Peter Schweizer has also written about a trip the Bidens made to China in 2013 that preceded a billion-dollar deal Hunter Biden\u2019s firm struck with a Chinese bank.\n\n\n\n\u201cChina is an adversary. China right now has a million ethnic minorities - the Uighurs basically in prison camps,\u201d Mr. Hurd said. \u201cAlso, we\u2019re in a tight and complex trade negotiation with China now, and so you\u2019re potentially giving them something to hold over your head.\u201d\n\n\n\nMr. Hurd, who is not seeking re-election next year, said he also expects China will manipulate its currency or try to do something to affect global markets ahead of the 2020 U.S. elections.\n\n\n\n\u201cI think that is something that a president of the United States shouldn\u2019t be doing,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nHe also said he\u2019s not comfortable with newly released text messages that show American and Ukrainian officials discussing the notion of withholding military aid for Ukraine for political purposes - an issue that\u2019s at the heart of House Democrats\u2019 newly formalized impeachment inquiry.\n\n\n\n\u201cI think some of these things are indeed damning,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, I want to make sure we get through this entire investigation before coming to some kind of conclusions. I think this is serious stuff, these are serious matters, this has long-term implications on our foreign policy.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
