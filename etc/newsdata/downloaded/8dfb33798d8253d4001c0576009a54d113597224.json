On Wednesday, bullion\u2019s hit $1,510.38, its highest price since May 2013.\n\nfor December delivery, traded on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, settled down $10.10, or 0.7%, at $1,509.50. December gold surged to $1,522.35 in the previous session, a peak since Aug 2013.\n\nGold prices had been on a tear over the past four sessions, after China devalued its yuan in response to U.S. President Donald Trump threat to impose from Sept. 1 a 10% tariff on untaxed Chinese imports worth $300 billion. Many investors also went for gold, expecting deeper rate cuts by the Federal Reserve over the coming months as global central banks embarked on easing to try and avert an economic slowdown.\n\nThursday\u2019s decline in gold came after July trade data from China provided some relief to global economic worries. Surprise growth in exports, its biggest since March, and a less-than-expected decline in imports sent an encouraging message to markets. The yuan was, meanwhile, at 7.0452 to the dollar, rebounding from Wednesday\u2019s low of 7.0643.\n\nBut some economists warned that relief could be temporary if Washington follows through with additional tariffs on Chinese goods in September.\n\n\u201cNothing has changed fundamentally with regards to the US-China situation, or the global economic outlook with today\u2019s positive trade figures from China coming in on the back of very weak German industrial data from the day before,\u201d said Fawad Razaqzada, analyst at FOREX.com.\n\n\u201cAlthough the probabilities of a further 25 basis point cut in the Fed\u2019s September meeting as implied by Fed fund futures may have fallen from as much as 85%, the markets are still pricing in a 76.5% chance of a cut. Further rate cuts should help to boost precious metals.\u201d\n\nWith the trade war not appearing to end anytime soon, analysts think gold futures could seek a perch in the $1,800 territory in the coming weeks, closing in on its 2011 record high of $1,911.60.\n\nBullion remains up 4.6% on the week, 6.7% on the month and almost 17.5% on the year.\n\nDecember gold has, meanwhile, carries a gain of 3.6% on the week, 5% on the month and almost 15.7% on the year.", "description": "Gold off 6-Year Highs; Longs Bent on Keeping Rally Going", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEAAH0G6_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-08"}
