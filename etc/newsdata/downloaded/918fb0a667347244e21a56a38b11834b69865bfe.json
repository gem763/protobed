In the Video Op-Ed above, Europeans are shocked to learn that the American government does not guarantee social protections that citizens in other advanced economies take for granted.\n\nTheir reactions reflect how European governments prioritize citizen welfare, offering national assurances like universal health care and affordable education. Americans have grown accustomed to the exorbitant costs of basic human services, the absence of parental leave protection and the unregulated presence of chemicals in food \u2014 things that would \u201ccause riots\u201d in Europe.\n\nIt\u2019s true that the United States grapples with a larger and more diverse population than that of any European country. But with the resources of the world\u2019s largest economy and as keepers of the American dream, can\u2019t policymakers find solutions?\n\nBrendan Miller (@brenkjm) is a filmmaker based in London.\n\nRubina Pabanai (@RubinaPabani) is a filmmaker and podcaster based in London.", "description": "We asked young, ordinary Europeans to take a look at U.S. policies on everything from food to guns.
