This work never ends.\u201d\n\nRussell described Instagram\u2019s new commitment as sincere, but said the company needed to act more swiftly. \u201cI just hope he [Mosseri] delivers,\u201d he added.\n\nSpeaking about his daughter, Russell told the BBC: \u201cI think Molly probably found herself becoming depressed. She was always very self-sufficient and liked to find her own answers. I think she looked towards the internet to give her support and help.\n\n\u201cShe may well have received support and help, but what she also found was a dark, bleak world of content that accelerated her towards more such content.\u201d\n\nHe said the algorithms used by some online platforms \u201cpush similar content towards you\u201d based on what you have been looking at.\n\nHe said: \u201cI think Molly entered that dark rabbit hole of depressive suicidal content.\n\n\u201cSome were as simple as little cartoons \u2013 a black and white pencil drawing of a girl that said: \u2018Who would love a suicidal girl?\u2019 Some were much more graphic and shocking.\u201d\n\nAndy Burrows, the head of child safety online policy at the NSPCC, said the move did not change the fact that the industry as a whole was irresponsible, and called on the government to progress legislation intended to impose a duty of care on social media platforms.\n\n\u201cMolly\u2019s death should be a galvanising moment to act,\u201d Burrows said, \u201cbut the reality is while Instagram has taken positive steps the rest of the tech industry has been slow to respond \u2013 on self-harm, suicide and other online harms.\n\n\u201cAs Ian Russell says there is a pressure of time and there is a price for not moving quickly enough, which is children\u2019s lives.\n\n\u201cThat is why the government needs to introduce a draft bill to introduce the duty of care regulator by next Easter and commit to ensuring it tackles all the most serious online threats to children.\u201d", "description": "Move follows appeal by father of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who killed herself in 2017", "authors": ["Alex Hern"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a330ffbbc44dcbbdec8b3661283f94a6ffb0a162/46_60_1061_637/master/1061.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a60e46e884669332ab5783bfb61141f8", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
