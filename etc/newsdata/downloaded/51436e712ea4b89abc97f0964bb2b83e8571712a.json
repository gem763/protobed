Raqqa was liberated by the SDF and coalition forces in 2017, but ISIS could be attempting to destabilize the area, according to The International Crisis Group.\n\n\"The group is thought to have more sophisticated clandestine networks in al-Raqqa and al-Hasaka provinces, where it perpetrates relatively complex and ambitious attacks,\" according to a report titled, \"Averting an ISIS Resurgence in Iraq and Syria.\" Alleged attacks in Raqqa city, the report says, indicate that Raqqa's security situation is declining, which could be further precipitated by the Turkish incursion.\n\n\"The ISIS attacks in Raqqa, you could think of them destabilizing the security forces in that area because ISIS is intending to destabilize Raqqa,\" Wallace told Insider. \"A stable Raqqa is a political alternative to ISIS\" \u2014 something the group seeks to eliminate. Vehement protests against regime troops, now making their way into the area around Deir Ezzor and other former SDF-held areas, could also open up potential for ISIS recruitment, according to Jason Zhou, the Hertog War Studies Fellow at the Institute for the Study of War.\n\nBut while ISIS attacks may be growing in sophistication, \"the operational environment has changed,\" Wallace told Insider. Less sectarian fighting in Iraq and a stronger security environment there \u2014 not to mention the visceral memories of people living under the caliphate \u2014 would make it harder for the group to resurge.\n\nBut continued chaos in Syria \u2014 demonstrated by Syria envoy James Jeffrey's admission on Wednesday that more than 100 ISIS prisoners had escaped since the Turkish incursion and that the US has no idea where they are \u2014 will inevitably affect Iraq, too.\n\nOne thing is for certain, Wallace told Insider.\n\n\"ISIS absolutely intends to rule terrain again.\"", "description": "\"ISIS absolutely intends to rule terrain again,\" an analyst told Insider, and it's staging attacks on symbolically important places.", "authors": ["Ellen Ioanes"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Mf5cIizERSSqUsFljFWxLw--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/business_insider_articles_888/aea24d8a15f2939035956ccd7bd4e527", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
