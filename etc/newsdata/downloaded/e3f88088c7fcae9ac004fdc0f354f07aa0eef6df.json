At this point in time it is a very, very challenging situation and we are in discussions with the federal government and the state government and our utility providers ... in order to see ways to ensure the long-term viability of those assets,\u201d Jacques said.\n\nSome hold the view there is something more than the usual brinkmanship in this process given the potential for current and future carbon tolls to break the back of viability already stretched by over-supply and unexpectedly low growth across aluminium\u2019s traditional economies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut that has nothing to do with the Tiwai-Meridian story. It is a far more traditional scrap between energy supplier, smelter and a government with an expressed reluctance to throw more taxpayers\u2019 money at the smelting business.\n\nAddressing a hastily assembled investor briefing on Wednesday, Meridian\u2019s Barclay disguised neither his surprise nor irritation with a declaration of possible intent that had already wiped nearly 8 per cent from his company\u2019s market capitalisation.\n\nAhead of Barclay\u2019s briefing Rio released a statement that said: \u201cUnder current market conditions and with high energy costs, we expect the short to medium outlook for the aluminium industry to be challenging and this asset to continue to be unprofitable.\n\n\u201cRio Tinto intends to hold discussions with the government of New Zealand and energy providers to explore options and identify economically viable solutions to find a pathway to profitability for the asset.\u201d\n\nNot going to bend over\n\nAfter making plain his assessment that Rio had simply taken its brinkmanship in NZ to an unprecedented level, Barclay took the unusual step of talking about the way his people assessed the financial state of his customer\u2019s business.\n\nBarclay said that Meridian\u2019s modelling of the forward bauxite, alumina and aluminium pricing suggested that the smelter would be cash flow positive this year, in 2020 and potentially in the year beyond that. He warned, too, that Meridian was not going to \u201ctake one for the team\u201d in any future negotiations with Rio.\n\n\u201cThis is an escalation,\u201d Barclay started. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen them propose a strategic review of this particular facility before and I don\u2019t think they have taken that decision lightly given the amount of disruption that will cause the business,\u201d he conceded.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith that said, Barclay ridiculed the idea that a company so determined to announce climate credibility and its long view on value might close a smelter that produces some of the world\u2019s highest quality aluminium while sitting among the lowest five ranked greenhouse emitters in its global smelter peer group.\n\n\u201cWe are not going to just bend over and write another cheque,\u201d he warned.\n\n\u201cIf they are not viable and they can\u2019t get a reasonable price from the NZ market, they might have to close. That would be an unfortunate outcome. But that is not something we can resile from.\u201d\n\nIt comes down to network costs\n\nHelpfully enough, the Meridian boss went on to identify just who might best resile in the name of securing the side here. After noting that there was \u201cno way\u201d the government would \u201csubsidise them or bail them out in any way shape or form\u201d, Barclay threw the spotlight on transmission costs.\n\n\u201c[They] do pay a greater proportion of the transmission costs in this country than is fair or reasonable,\u201d he said, before recommending that it might be a good idea to speed up the pathway to network cost reduction that is supposed to start in 2024.\n\nIt can be no coincidence that ahead of Barclay\u2019s presentation Rio had already offered estimates that its joint venture with Sumitomo had paid $NZ200 million over the past decade for transmission infrastructure that it does not use in the North Island.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe NZ Electricity Authority has triggered pricing reform that will kick in from 2024 and it will reduce the network component of the smelter\u2019s costs by $NZ11 million annually. The Rio view is that is too little, too late to make any difference in the current negotiations.\n\nThat Tiwai carries an unreasonable share of network cost reflects a failed exercise in equity.\n\nApparently transmission costs in NZ have historically been high (currently $NZ1 billion annually) and spread evenly between islands north and south. Until recently, that subdivision of costs had not been adjusted to reflect a $NZ1.3 billion build-out of the North Island\u2019s network since 2004. So the southerners have been left carrying costs of network they don\u2019t use.\n\nThe data presented to us says that transmission costs have increased by 61 per cent following those upgrades but only 39 per cent of the cost is being carried by customers in the North Island.\n\nEureka all over again\n\nNow, while we are talking Rio, how about those reports of a eureka moment in lithium at its century-old boron mine in the Mojave desert?\n\nThe potential that Rio metallurgists have work out how to extract lithium from the massive waste dumps in the desert goes to the very heart of what Rio is and where it came from.\n\nThis is, after all, a business built on new technology and very, very large waste dumps.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRio\u2019s original Australian forbear was the Zinc Company. It was formed in 1905 by William Baillieu and future US president Herbert Hoover to acquire tailings dumps in Broken Hill and deploy the new flotation technologies to extract zinc from the sulphide ores whose characteristics in the smelting process had forced them to be separated from the lead and silver material and deposited on waste dumps.\n\nThe rest, as they say, is history.\n\nWhile the potential of the latest breakthrough is obviously very exciting for Rio, it will be greeted with less enthusiasm in Serbia and the other frontiers of hard rock lithium mining.\n\nSerbia is home to what was hitherto the host of Rio\u2019s lithium ambitions, the complicated but very large Jadar prospect. Given the current fragility of the lithium market and the fact that production at Jadar would arrive with market disrupting volumes of boron, it is hard to believe Rio will pursue development with the vigour that Serbia is pushing for.", "description": "Power boss says he is not going to \"take one for the team\" after Rio launched a strategic review of one of the world's greenest aluminium smelters.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4056%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_614%2C$y_95/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/07dc02d0b8a65af2cf277d920566426d312e8ed2", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
