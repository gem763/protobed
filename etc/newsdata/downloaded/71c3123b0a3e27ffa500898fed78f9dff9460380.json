Instead of disciplinary action being instituted against Ramovha. Senior council member\n\nThe probe found that as a result of the irregularities, \u201cMillennium Pumps was paid by the municipality a total of about R22 501 346.48 during the period from January 2016 to March this year\u201d.\n\nThe forensic investigation was commissioned in August last year after Obakeng Mashiane, the acting director of technical services, requested an urgent investigation after numerous allegations had been reported to the municipality that \u201cMillennium Pumps was claiming amounts from the municipality in excess of what they were appointed for and/or claimed for work not performed\u201d.\n\nThe report also concluded that the termination of the contract came after Millennium Pumps had already \u201ccharged the municipality a fixed rate for each day including weekends and public holidays [days that were not supposed to be billed for since there was never any work rendered]\u201d.\n\nInstead of taking disciplinary action against Ramovha as recommended, the municipality in July appointed her acting municipal manager, granting her an accounting officer\u2019s powers.\n\nGino Alberts, the municipality\u2019s communications manager, told City Press that the recommendations made in the forensic report had not been implemented because the Millennium Pumps matter had not yet been tabled before council.\n\nHowever, a senior council member who spoke to City Press said: \u201cThe matter is being swept under the carpet. Instead of disciplinary action being instituted against Ramovha she has been promoted without a council resolution being taken.\u201d\n\nThis was disputed by Alberts who said \u201ccouncil resolved during a sitting held on July 9 this year, to appoint Maria Ramovha as acting municipal manager\u201d.\n\nThe council agenda for that day, seen by City Press, does not show any item on the nomination and/or appointment of an acting municipal manager.\n\nSeveral attempts were made to solicit comment from Ramovha but at the time of going to press she had not responded to emails and text messages sent to her.", "description": "The Metsimaholo Local Municipality\u2019s water and sanitation manager, Maria Ramovha, was promoted to acting municipal manager in July, despite a scathing forensic report recommending that disciplinary action be taken against her", "authors": ["Juniour Khumalo"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9353/e385d14bc2fe469990225c8f170876a9.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
