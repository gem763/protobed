Trump has since publicly urged Ukraine, and China, to investigate Biden, without citing any evidence of any wrongdoing.\n\nThe second official considering filing a whistleblower complaint about the president\u2019s dealings with Ukraine has more direct information about the events in question than the initial whistleblower and was interviewed by an intelligence watchdog to corroborate the first report, the New York Times reported late Friday, citing two anonymous sources.\n\nElsewhere, the Washington Post reported accounts of a number of Trump\u2019s calls with foreign leaders, citing an anonymous former White House official. The paper said in one of his first calls with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, Trump fawned over him, and in a call with the former UK prime minister Theresa May, Trump questioned British intelligence\u2019s conclusion that Putin\u2019s government was behind an attempt to kill a former Russian spy on British soil with a nerve agent.\n\nTrump on Saturday hit out at both papers.\n\nThe Media is \u201cFixed\u201d and Corrupt. It bears no relationship to the truth. The @nytimes & @washingtonpost are pure fiction. Totally dishonest reporting! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 5, 2019\n\nThe president has defended his open calls for foreign governments to investigate a political rival by repeating that there was \u201cno quid pro quo\u201d. Text messages between US diplomats and an assistant to Zelenskiy released this week reveal that this was not the understanding of US diplomats dealing with Ukraine.\n\nIn a tweet on Thursday, Trump said the presidency gave him \u201can absolute right, perhaps even a duty, to investigate or have investigated, CORRUPTION, and that would include asking, or suggesting, other Countries to help us out!\u201d\n\nPompeo: \u2018We\u2019ll do the things required by law\u2019\n\nSpeaking to reporters in Greece on Saturday, the secretary of state, Pompeo, did not reference Trump\u2019s admitted desire for Ukraine to investigate Biden, but said the investigation the US sought was related to Ukraine\u2019s possible interference in the 2016 US election.\n\nOn Wednesday, Pompeo admitted he had been on a controversial July call with Zelenskiy in which the president pressured Ukraine, according to a reconstructed transcript released by the White House.\n\nThree congressional committees subpoenaed Pompeo after the state department failed to produce documents related to the Ukraine inquiry.\n\nHe also missed a Friday deadline to turn over documents to the committees, which have scheduled depositions for five state department officials who have been mentioned in relation to the inquiry.\n\nIn Greece, Pompeo said the state department responded to the subpoenas on Friday night, but did not say what the response was. \u201cWe\u2019ll obviously do the things we are required to do by law,\u201d Pompeo said, adding that these inquiries have \u201charassed and abused\u201d state department employees.\n\nIn an effort to shed light on these dealings, House Democrats subpoenaed the White House demanding documents related to Ukraine on Friday night. They have also formally requested documents from the vice-president, Mike Pence, who had a meeting with Zelenskiy on 1 September.\n\nFew congressional Republicans or commentators have spoken against Trump after the president urged two foreign governments, Ukraine and China, to investigate a political rival this week.\n\nAmong those that have are Senator Mitt Romney, of Utah, who said Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine and China were \u201cwrong\u201d and \u201cappalling\u201d.\n\nTrump\u2019s tweets on Saturday targeted Romney saying: \u201cSomebody please wake up Mitt Romney and tell him my conversation was a congenial and very appropriate one.\u201d", "description": "Intelligence official was interviewed by watchdog to corroborate initial complaint about Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine, report saysDonald Trump has defended his open calls for foreign governments to investigate a political rival by repeating that there was \u2018no quid pro quo\u2019.
