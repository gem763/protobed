REUTERS/Andrew Kelly\n\nThe Cupertino, California-based company is widely expected to launch three new iPhones on Tuesday, featuring upgraded processors and new camera functionality, along with a video streaming service that will take on the likes of Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) and Walt Disney (DIS.N).\n\nThe upgrade cycle could translate into roughly 180 million iPhone units sold in the next 12 months with roughly 60 million to 70 million consumers due for an upgrade in China, where Apple struggled with its last launch, Wedbush analysts said.\n\nApple currently has about 900 million active iPhones globally and the combination of slack sales for its iPhone X launches since 2017 and relatively tight control of pricing may spur demand from users who have been holding out previously, several analysts said.\n\n\u201cThese old phones would be candidates for upgrade and we continue to look at fiscal 2020 as a \u2018Trade-in\u2019 iPhone cycle versus 2021 which should be a 5G-driven cycle,\u201d Bank of America analysts said.\n\nThey estimated there were 200 million iPhone 6 and earlier models which were primed for upgrading.\n\nApple\u2019s 2020 fiscal year starts from October and none of the brokerages expected it to launch a 5G-enabled iPhone this time round - in contrast to recent 5G mobile launches by Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) and China\u2019s OnePlus.\n\nAnalysts and other industry watchers expect Apple to launch three smartphones: a 5.8-inch iPhone 11 Pro, 6.5-inch 11 Pro Max and a low-priced 6.1-inch 11R.\n\nThe base model is expected to be priced at $749, the iPhone 11 Pro at $999 and iPhone Pro Max at $1,099, roughly unchanged from last year\u2019s prices, with the company opting to push through any potential tariffs on the devices in favor of boosting sales volumes.\n\nApple faces here levies of 15% imposed by the U.S. government on products made in China including smartwatches and wireless headphones as of Sept. 1, with a tariff on the iPhone to take effect on Dec. 15.\n\nApple has seen bumps in demand in China this year, driven by Chinese online retailers discounting iPhones.\n\n\u201cApple saw meaningful elasticity of demand in China when it lowered the price of iPhone XR, and we expect Apple to potentially lower pricing of some models,\u201d the Bank of America analysts said.", "description": "Apple Inc could sell as many as 200 million of its latest iPhones from existing users upgrading their older devices and much of that demand will come from China despite an ongoing trade war, several Wall Street analysts said on Monday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190909&t=2&i=1428035603&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF881JE-OCATC", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
