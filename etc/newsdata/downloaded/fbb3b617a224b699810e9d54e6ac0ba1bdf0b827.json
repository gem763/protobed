I went 4-3 again, only by yet again picking against the Jets, bringing me to 13-8 on the season with a long way to go. Not terrible, but not particularly awesome. The good news is that the New York Jets are poised to have their best week of the 2019 season so far. Because they\u2019re not playing. These guys actually didn\u2019t look all that bad against New England last week, all things considered. They scored more points against the Patriots than anyone else has so far, even if zero of those points were put up by the offense. But if we don\u2019t stabilize some key positions and firm up the offensive line it\u2019s going to be yet another very long season.\n\nEd: I also went 4-3 last week, so I\u2019m now 10-11 on the season, which is even more meh than Jazz\u2019 season \u2026 but it beats the 2-5 record I had from the week before. At least the Steelers are playing this week, and at least they\u2019re playing this season. Pittsburgh\u2019s still making roster moves hoping to salvage 2019 rather than just going for a rebuilding season, but whether it can help keep Mason Rudolph from having to do it all himself. We\u2019ll see if they can turn the corner this week \u2026 but I\u2019m hoping I can, anyway.\n\nJazz: As I mentioned above, the Jets are staying off the field this week so we can move straight to Pittsburgh\u2019s game. The Steelers welcome the Bengals in the Monday night game (Monday, 8:15 pm, ESPN) and Pittsburgh without Big Ben and a rather porous offensive line hasn\u2019t been particularly impressive. The good news is that the Bengals have been stinking up the joint nearly as badly. If for nothing other than home-field advantage, I\u2019ll take the Steelers over the Bengals 21-17. The Vikings visit the Bears (4:25 pm, CBS) in what may not be that much of a showdown between Kirk Cousins against Mitchell Trubisky because both teams have been running a lot and relying on defense. The Vikings benefit from all the yards running back Dalvin Cook has been putting on the board. Chicago is the slight favorite, but I\u2019ll flip a coin and take Minnesota over Chicago in a defensive battle, 16-12. Since the Jets are out, let\u2019s toss in the Cowboys in our featured games. Dallas plays the Saints in New Orleans (8:20 pm, NBC) and they are somehow favored by less than a field goal. On paper, it looks like the Saints should be better at home but Dallas has been pinning their ears back over the past couple of seasons. I\u2019ll take Dallas over New Orleans 24-16.\n\nEd: On paper, the Steelers and Bengals are pretty evenly matched, which isn\u2019t exactly a compliment. The Steelers have had to face tougher competition this season than Cincinnati has, and they\u2019re playing at home, so Steelers 24-13 over Bengals. The Viking aren\u2019t the same team on the road, and especially not without Dalvin Cook and their running game. Chicago is keeping teams to less than 70 rushing yards a game, which means Kirk Cousins will have to win it against the Bears\u2019 offense at home rather than in Minnesota\u2019s indoor field. I\u2019m rooting for Vikes, but I\u2019ll pick Chicago 20-14 over Minnesota. Normally I wouldn\u2019t bet against New Orleans at home, but without Drew Brees, this is a different team. Teddy Bridgewater\u2019s trying, but Dallas is too much stronger on both sides of the ball. Cowboys over Saints 28-23.\n\nJazz: Here\u2019s our final four games for the week to get us to seven.\n\nPanthers at Texans (1:00 pm, FOX) \u2013 Kyle Allen has been doing an impressive job filling in for Cam Newton so this one will probably be closer than we may think. But Houston has a better looking line on both sides of the ball so I\u2019ll give this one to the Texans over the Panthers 17-12 .\n\nKyle Allen has been doing an impressive job filling in for Cam Newton so this one will probably be closer than we may think.

Redskins at Giants (1:00 pm, FOX) \u2013 This is more of a sentimental pick for me, including a New York team in a classic NFC matchup. The Giants have not looked good this year, but Washington hasn\u2019t put a W on the board yet. That trend continues this weekend. Give me the Giants over the Redskins 27-17 .\n\nThis is more of a sentimental pick for me, including a New York team in a classic NFC matchup.

Titans at Falcons (1:00 pm, CBS) \u2013 Both of these teams are off to a rocky start at 1-2, but it\u2019s way too early to write either of them off. Julio Jones has been putting up some impressive numbers for Atlanta and this match probably won\u2019t be a defensive struggle. (*cough*) I think Atlanta looks a bit better on the offensive side so I\u2019ll take the Falcons over the Titans 27-24 .\n\nBoth of these teams are off to a rocky start at 1-2, but it\u2019s way too early to write either of them off.

Jaguars at Broncos (4:25 pm, CBS) \u2013 Denver is 0-3 but Jacksonville\u2019s obvious weaknesses seem to line up with the few things the Broncos are getting right. This one could be a tossup, but I\u2019ll take the Broncos over the Jaguars 16-9.\n\nEd:", "description": "Feel the burn", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/steelers-bengals.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
