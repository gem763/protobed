Those are the odds of a plane crash in the 21st Century. You have a higher chance of being The President of The United States (1 in 10 million), winning an Oscar (1 in 11,500) or even dating a millionaire (1 in 215).\n\nRadiotopia's Passenger List brings you into the reality of being that one in 11 million, and what happens when the details around the crash are questionable.\n\nCo-written and produced by John Dryden and Lauren Shippen, with voice acting by Kelly Marie Tran (Star Wars: The Last Jedi) and Colin Morgan (BBC's Merlin). Passenger List launches you into the aftermath of the crash of Flight 702, and the investigation of one passenger's sister trying to find out what actually happened to the plane.\n\nPassenger List is one of the best podcasts I have listened to this year, with not only an enticing story but the show also has a great sound scape that immerses the listener into a believable story about an unbelievable journey.\n\n-James O'Dowda, Associate Producer, Podcast Playlist\n\nPodcasts featured this week:\n\nSnap Judgment - Campfire Tales V \u2013 \"When Mark Spencer and his family moved to Monticello, AR, they thought they had found the perfect place.
