This year\u2019s edition \u2014 153 movies, two dozen talks, assorted free events \u2014 offers plenty of chances for mind-and-spirit expansion with new and old movies, short and long. If you\u2019ve never seen Bela Tarr\u2019s seven-hour masterwork, \u201cSatantango,\u201d now\u2019s your chance. The opening-night title \u2014 Martin Scorsese\u2019s \u201cThe Irishman\u201d \u2014 is comparatively fleet at three hours, 29 minutes.\n\nScorsese\u2019s latest revisits the mystery of Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino), the combative Teamster boss who went missing in 1975. It has its world premiere Friday (there will be 10 screenings!) and is, as you would expect, the most frantically anticipated movie at the festival, which runs through Oct. 13. Every new Scorsese movie is an event, this one more than most given that it finds the director again exploring crime in America with some of his legendary, career-defining collaborators: Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci and Harvey Keitel. All the showings are sold out, but the standby lines might answer your prayers. The movie opens theatrically Nov. 1 and starts streaming on Netflix on Nov. 27. (Our review will follow the opening-night showing.)\n\nIdeally, though, try to watch \u201cThe Irishman\u201d on the largest, brightest movie screen you can find, advice that holds true for much of the rest of the selections at the festival. As the new name of its parent organization suggests \u2014 it\u2019s now Film at Lincoln Center, having dropped the charming if fusty \u201csociety\u201d \u2014 the event remains committed to film as an art and a visually driven medium. Even when the image nearly floods over with talking and at times shouting heads, as in Noah Baumbach\u2019s \u201cMarriage Story,\u201d a festival high point about two people\u2019s agonized, self-conscious uncoupling, these are movies to \u00adsee and to see big.\n\nLike some of the other titles in the main slate, \u201cMarriage Story\u201d (another Netflix release) is passing through New York in the middle of a festival run \u2014 it has played at Venice, Telluride and Toronto \u2014 that sometimes feeds right into the long road to the Academy Awards. Don\u2019t hold its awards chances against the movie and its stars, Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver. In its prickliness and insistence on the messiness and ineluctable pain of life, this is very different from the pandering, gold-grubbing titles that tend to hit theaters starting around now.", "description": "This year\u2019s edition includes the latest from Martin Scorsese, Pedro Almod\u00f3var, Kelly Reichardt and Bong Joon-ho.", "authors": ["Manohla Dargis"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/27/arts/26nyff-notebook-pain-glory/26nyff-notebook-pain-glory-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
