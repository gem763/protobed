Joe Biden would be 86. Donald Trump is already declining at 73. We can\u2019t be serious.\n\nIt\u2019s a curious time to discussing anyone else\u2019s inability to serve as president of the United States, when Donald Trump has resorted to Twitter to tout his own \u201cgreat and unmatched wisdom\u201d about foreign policy without a hint of irony.\n\nBut it\u2019s time nonetheless: We can\u2019t be serious about Bernie Sanders prospectively being president until he\u2019s 87 years old or Joe Biden until he\u2019s 86.\n\nEverybody knows\n\nAnyone who has helped care for truly elderly parents knows this.\n\nMany much-older parents \u2014 including 95-year-old former President Jimmy Carter, who said last month he couldn\u2019t have done the job at 80 \u2014 know it, too.\n\nBut we have to talk about it now, with Sanders having had a heart attack last week and Biden struggling daily to defend his integrity against wholly made-up attacks by President Donald Trump. As adult children say to more-ordinary parents than Sanders, Biden or Trump, about more-mundane matters like driver\u2019s licenses and cooking for themselves, it\u2019s time.\n\nI speak from \u2014 perhaps over-extrapolate from \u2014 my experience as a son whose mother died from dementia complications in 2014. My siblings and I had The Talk with each other around my brother\u2019s dining-room table just after Christmas 2006, and should have had it sooner.\n\nMom\u2019s death was long and hard, and while not without its own beauty it\u2019s something you\u2019d never wish on anyone. Things that happen weeks apart for other patients \u2014 not recognizing people, losing the ability to focus on tasks, ceding the capacity to walk unaided \u2014 happened months or years apart for my mother.\n\nAll along the way, the seven of us \u2014 six, after we lost my sister to cancer \u2014 denied what we were seeing, hoped things would improve or at least progress more slowly. Each of us in a mix of our own mind\u2019s creation. People do this.\n\nLying, concealing, denying\n\nAnd do it without the incentives that presidential administrations have to lie (beginning with lying to themselves), conceal, or otherwise obscure the principal\u2019s bad health so an administration\u2019s agenda can move forward.\n\nGiven the awesome responsibilities of the presidency, it\u2019s naive not to talk about it.\n\nThe health issue need not be Alzheimer\u2019s or dementia. The large number of sufferers doesn\u2019t even include those who are simply not as quick or as intellectually nimble as they once were \u2014 signs we see in all three of the oldest presidential candidates, including Trump, if we\u2019re honest.\n\nWe know White Houses do this. Nixon\u2019s covered up his drinking. Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s staff hid his wartime decline into heart failure. John Kennedy\u2019s team concealed his Addison\u2019s disease. Doubts about Ronald Reagan, who died of Alzheimer\u2019s, pervaded Washington throughout his second term.\n\nIn the granddaddy of them all, Woodrow Wilson\u2019s wife moved heaven and earth for more than a year to keep the world from discovering how fully the 28th president was disabled by a stroke.\n\nTough math\n\nSomewhere between one in six and one in four people in their 80s get dementia, according to different sources. Almost one in three presidencies since 1900 have been marred by concealment of serious, debilitating presidential illness (not even counting Dwight Eisenhower\u2019s coverup of the severity of his 1955 heart attack, or speculating about Trump\u2019s mental health).\n\nIt\u2019s tough math, but the calculations need to be made, and realistically.\n\nThe life expectancy of an 80-year old U.S. male is eight years, the length of two presidential terms, according to the Social Security Administration. If Alzheimer\u2019s doesn\u2019t crop up, it could well be something else. And that\u2019s without the stress of the presidency.\n\nYes, we all know of people who work successfully into their 80s. Warren Buffett is an extreme example, pounding steaks and Cherry Cokes and running Berkshire Hathaway at 89. But even Buffett has made no bones about Berkshire being run by heads of its operating companies, with headquarters staff making investment decisions \u2014 relying, increasingly, on younger executives for those.\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing we consistently don\u2019t know, even about our loved ones, it\u2019s when their existing faults (Biden\u2019s loopiness, Sanders\u2019 unwillingness to recognize when opponents make a good point, Trump\u2019s determination not to read) blend into a permanent, age-related problem. If they do cross the line, will they recognize it? Will their teams admit it \u2014 or, like my siblings and I did, spend years in denial?\n\nEven without age-related decline, the presidency\u2019s no ordinary job. We\u2019ve watched its demands for quick adaptation to changing facts flummox George W. Bush \u2014 a Yale and Harvard graduate who was 62 when 2008\u2019s financial crisis hit, and 55 when he decided Saddam Hussein\u2019s Iraq and the terror group al-Qaeda were joined at the hip.\n\nAmericans shouldn\u2019t relish even a healthy 85-year-old trying to manage such fast-moving cross-currents of facts and analysis. Biden or Sanders at that age might be better than Trump at 73, but so would a can of tomatoes.\n\nPerfectly good options\n\nAsking these questions becomes easier when there are perfectly viable options.\n\nOn the Democratic side, Elizabeth Warren, a very young-seeming 70, has organized the most-effective campaign to date, addressing her perceived flaw as a chilly Harvard academic by emphasizing working-class roots, and developing policy proposals around the clear themes that eluded the younger Hillary Clinton.\n\nThere are a half-dozen other plausible presidents. They\u2019re 54 (Kamala Harris), 50 (Cory Booker), 45 (Julian Castro), 47 (Beto O\u2019Rourke), and 59 (Amy Klobuchar) \u2014 and 37-year old Pete Buttigieg.\n\nIt\u2019s too soon to know whether pressure to step aside after his heart attack will drive Sanders from the race, or whether early primary-state voters will force Biden\u2019s hand.\n\nBut we know what it looks like when a president manifestly can\u2019t handle the job \u2014 can\u2019t master or retain the material, can\u2019t weigh pros and cons meaningfully, grunts instead of thinks. That\u2019s Trump.\n\nIt\u2019s a hell of a chance for us to take \u2014 again.", "description": "Bernie Sanders would be 87 years old if he served two terms as president. Joe Biden would be 86.
