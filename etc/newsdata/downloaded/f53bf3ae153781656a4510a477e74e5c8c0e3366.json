Both the stairwell and escape hatch appear to have been blocked by the hot flames, Sheriff Brown said.\n\nFive crew members, including the captain, whose quarters were higher up on the third deck, were able to escape the inferno, he added.\n\nA sixth crew member, the cook, slept downstairs, according to Broc Johnson, who went on three diving trips on the Conception in the past three years, including one just two months ago. Authorities confirmed that one crew member perished in the fire.\n\n\u201cI loved that boat; I loved the crew; I loved that operation,\u201d Mr. Johnson, a contractor and dive master, said. \u201cI\u2019m shocked.\u201d\n\nU.S. Coast Guard Capt. Monica Rochester said rescuers didn\u2019t see any further signs of distress or debris during a 24-hour-long search, indicating there aren\u2019t any remaining survivors. She added that the Conception had passed its most recent inspection for fire-safety equipment, which includes fire extinguishers.\n\nThe first distress call from the ship went out just before 3:30 a.m. Monday, and was picked up by the Coast Guard. The Conception was moored near Platt\u2019s Harbor on the northern side of Santa Cruz Island, a popular destination for divers that is part of the Channel Islands National Park about 25 miles south of Santa Barbara.\n\n\u201cMayday! Mayday! Mayday! Conception. Platt\u2019s Harbor, north side, Santa Cruz,\u201d a man can be heard saying.\n\n\u201cVessel in distress, this is the Coast Guard sector Los Angeles,\u201d another man responded. \u201cWhat is your position and number of persons on board, over?\u201d\n\nThe distressed caller replied in a garbled transmission with what appear to be coordinates, then said, \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d\n\nThe five crew members who escaped the flames got into a dinghy, and paddled to a nearby fishing boat. Shirley and Bob Hansen, the boat\u2019s owners, helped them on board. One of the crew appeared to have a badly broken leg, Ms. Hansen said.\n\nOne of the men told the Hansens that he had heard a noise and gotten up. When he opened the door to the galley, he saw an orange glow, Ms. Hansen said. When he tried to get down to the deck, the flames stopped him, and he saw things falling from the ceiling.\n\n\u201cIt looked like the whole boat from the bow to the stern was engulfed in flames,\u201d Ms. Hansen said.\n\nBecause the bodies recovered from the wreckage were badly burned, investigators will use DNA analysis to identify the deceased, said Sheriff Brown. Officials used the same method to identify those who died in the 2018 Camp Fire in Northern California.\n\nTwo high-school students from a public charter school in Santa Cruz called Pacific Collegiate School were on board with two parents, school officials said Tuesday.\n\nAt the Santa Barbara Harbor, where the Conception was scheduled to return before the fire, a small memorial had popped up Tuesday, with dozens of flowers and candles, as well as messages to some of the victims. One framed photo, showing a picture of a man with his arm around a woman, said, \u201cI love you Allie\u2014and you know I always will! I\u2019ll miss you forever. [Heart] Rob.\u201d\n\nAnother message, written on a red and white flag, said, \u201cWe\u2019ll remember you on every dive.\u201d\n\nChristine Diaz, who has lived in the area for more than 30 years, said she knew the Conception well, though she wasn\u2019t sure if she knew anyone who was on the ship. She worked out of the harbor for eight years on a whale watching boat.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a sad day for all of us here in Santa Barbara,\u201d Ms. Diaz, 55 years old, said. \u201cI just stopped by to see what was going on, just say a prayer for those families.\u201d\n\nShe said the setup of the Conception, with the crew sleeping higher up than passengers, was typical of commercial boats in the area.\n\n\u201cIf there was any issue, they would do their best to provide assistance,\u201d she said. \u201cIf they couldn\u2019t, I can assure you their option was to save themselves.\u201d\n\nKristy Finstad, co-owner of the dive company that chartered the boat for a trip to the Channel Islands, was on board Monday and is presumed dead, her stepfather, Al Harmeling, said. She ran Santa Cruz-based Worldwide Diving Adventures with her husband, Dan Chua, who was leading an expedition elsewhere Monday.\n\nNicknamed \u201cFin\u201d when she was younger, Ms. Finstad always had an affinity for the water and studied marine biology. About five years ago, she and her husband set out in a catamaran from Baja, Mexico, for the islands of the South Pacific. They visited New Zealand, Fiji and other islands, trading fish they caught for vegetables and leading diving excursions. They returned to the states last fall and bought a home near Lake Tahoe.\n\nMs. Finstad\u2019s mother, Rita Harmeling, said her daughter loved that \u201cdifferent world under the water, where it\u2019s quiet except the noise of your breathing.\u201d\n\n\u2014Jimmy Vielkind contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Zusha Elinson at zusha.elinson@wsj.com, Ian Lovett at Ian.Lovett@wsj.com and Erin Ailworth at Erin.Ailworth@wsj.com", "description": "The search for survivors from a diving boat that burned and sank off the coast of California has been called off.
