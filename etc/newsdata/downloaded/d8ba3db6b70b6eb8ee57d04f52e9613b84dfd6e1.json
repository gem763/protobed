Patrick Taylor Jr., who rushed for over 1,100 yards last year, was injured in the season opener and hasn\u2019t played since. That opened the door for Gainwell to step into the spotlight.\n\n\u201cIt just made me a better player, made me a better back, really just learning as much as I could from those guys,\u201d Gainwell said.\n\nGainwell has run for 620 yards and has averaged 124 yards rushing per game to rank sixth among all Football Bowl Subdivision players heading into the Tigers\u2019 Saturday game at Temple (4-1, 1-0 American).\n\nThe redshirt freshman is on pace to deliver the fourth 1,000-yard single-season rushing performance in the last three years for Memphis. That comes after Memphis (5-0, 1-0) didn\u2019t have a single 1,000-yard rusher from 2010-16.\n\n\u201cWe say it all the time - it\u2019s an offense that\u2019s built for playmakers,\u201d Memphis coach Mike Norvell said. \u201cWe try to go out and identify guys who can come into the system and we can really formulate plans that surround their talents and put them in position to showcase them, whether it\u2019s handing the ball to them or throwing the ball to them.\u201d\n\nMemphis\u2018 assembly line of 1,000-yard rushers began in 2017 when Henderson ran for 1,154 yards during the second year of Norvell\u2019s tenure. One year later, Henderson ranked second in the nation with 1,909 yards rushing while Taylor ran for 1,122 yards.\n\nHenderson got drafted in the third round by the Los Angeles Rams . Pollard, who had over 1,000 combined rushing and receiving yards last year while also returning kicks, went to the Dallas Cowboys in the fourth round.\n\nNorvell \u201cdoes a good job of getting his playmakers involved and making sure everybody touches the ball,\u201d Henderson said.\n\nThe departures of the NFL draft picks appeared to leave Taylor as Memphis\u2018 featured back before fate intervened. Taylor rushed for 128 yards in a 15-10 victory over Mississippi to open the season but injured his lower leg in that game.\n\nGainwell wasted no time seizing the opportunity.\n\nThe 5-foot-11, 191-pound Gainwell has rushed for over 100 yards in three straight games, including a 209-yard performance last week in a 52-33 victory over Louisiana-Monroe. He averages 8.2 yards per carry.\n\n\u201cTo be a good back, you have to have great vision, and he certainly has that,\u201d Temple coach Rod Carey said. \u201cThe second thing he has is unbelievable balance. And he\u2019s really strong. He may not seem like it because of his physical stature, that he\u2019s strong, but he\u2019s extremely strong. He\u2019s tough to bring down, and he\u2019s got the speed to go. He\u2019s kind of got the whole package right there.\u201d\n\nGainwell, a former high school quarterback from Yazoo City, Mississippi, says he chose Memphis in part because of all the quality running backs the program was producing. Gainwell played four games while redshirting last year but also learned from watching Henderson, Pollard and Taylor.\n\nHis current and former teammates aren\u2019t surprised at how well he\u2019s performing.\n\n\u201cI used to watch him all the time when I was at Memphis, and he always did the extra work, and you\u2019re starting to see it pay off for him,\u201d Henderson said. \u201cHe\u2019s just doing great things.\u201d\n\nGainwell\u2019s rapid progress has backed up Norvell\u2019s confidence in him. Norvell noted that whenever anyone asked him before the season about a lesser-known player who might step up and emerge as a star, he\u2019d always mention Gainwell.\n\nTaylor also deserves credit for Gainwell\u2019s emergence.\n\n\u201cHe knows my talent, he knows how hard I work, so he always tells me to be great,\u201d Gainwell said. \u201cHe gives me the motivational talks, gives me tips on plays and stuff like that.\u201d\n\nTaylor and Gainwell could be playing together again soon enough.\n\nNorvell says Taylor is gaining strength and that the junior\u2019s status for the Temple game is uncertain. The coach soon could face a bit of a dilemma on how to distribute carries.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been used to having quite a few quality backs around here,\u201d Norvell said. \u201cI think we\u2019ll find a way to get them all the ball.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\n___\n\nAP sports writer Greg Beachem in Los Angeles contributed to this report.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Memphis has cracked the Top 25 behind the emergence of yet another impressive running back.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Steve Megargee"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/10/navy_memphis_football_01195_c0-973-3300-2897_s1770x1032.jpg?3d8d4e9cf8ca34bdb5bcb9ec3dbc47a173422cfd", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
