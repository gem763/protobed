Even his burial place remains a mystery,\" the nephew said.\n\n\"The chiefs and the elders are the ones that determine which cave they are going to put him in and where they are going to bury him.\"", "description": "Close relatives and government officials flew out of Zimbabwe on Monday to collect the body of ex-president Robert Mugabe from Singapore where he died last week, his nephew said.
