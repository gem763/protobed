We Asked an Expert.", "language": "en", "text": "Photo: Fox\n\nThe first episode of The Masked Singer cracked our spirit like so many Eggs. With folk hero Egg out of the picture, how could we go on watching? How could we go on at all? Or so we said, for all of five minutes, before TV\u2019s most Boschian singing competition pulled us right back in. How could we possibly say no to the intrigue? To the pageantry? The show sets itself apart from similar reality shows by disguising its celebrity contestants in elaborate, anthropomorphic costumes, so that any Tori Spelling skeptics find themselves unclouded in their fandom for the Unicorn, to give an example from season one.\n\nFor every Egg that season two has thrown at us, there are also more traditional costume concepts, like Fox and Panda. We won\u2019t know who\u2019s underneath the outfits\u2019 analogue fur technology until the season progresses, but we did want to consult an expert for their initial thoughts and predictions. Mainly, we wanted to know: Is The Masked Singer courting a furry audience?\n\nHow is it that it's been weeks now and virtually none of y'all are talking about Masked Singer and how hot Rabbit and Peacock are?\n\n\n\nAre you sure you're even furries? COME ON MAN pic.twitter.com/VuqKGDmOxZ \u2014 Emotional Support Animal (@microdile) January 31, 2019\n\nFor those who are reading this despite somehow having never been online, furries are fans of anthropomorphic cartoon animals who develop original characters called \u201cfursonas,\u201d which they embody with fan art and fursuits not unlike the larger-than-life costumes on display in The Masked Singer. So we asked Patch O\u2019Furr, the husky behind furry news site Dogpatch Press, to sniff out the new contestants. Patch interviewed furry ally Margaret Cho after she was revealed to be the Poodle during the show\u2019s first season, so he seemed to be the canine to ask.\n\nPatch was of two minds regarding whether The Masked Singer counts as furry crossover culture. Certain elements, like the \u201cgender neutral\u201d design of costumes like Leopard, and the seemingly well thought out backstories and design elements for characters like season one\u2019s Rabbit (Joey Fatone), are pretty damn furry. When asked about the odds that someone on the design or development team might themselves be a furry, Patch said that \u201cthat\u2019s a bit hard to judge,\u201d but noted \u201cat the very least, they\u2019re aware \u2014 they\u2019re very, very aware \u2014 of stuff like Comic-Con and cosplay. And furry would be one part of that.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, Patch made it clear that unlike the contestants on The Masked Singer, \u201cfurries don\u2019t \u2018dress up.\u2019 They actually become what they feel like inside.\u201d He elaborated: \u201cI would rather see a nobody become a something. Not just a celebrity becoming \u2018oh hey, here I am! I was this garish thing and now here\u2019s my attention-getting face.\u2019 I would rather see a nobody \u2014 a plumber, my UPS driver \u2014 become something that doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d\n\nAnd as Patch explained, the very premise of the show, which features the ritual beheadings of the worst singers when they\u2019re sent home each week, is particularly abrasive to a furry palate. \u201cWhen people want to see them take the heads off, that\u2019s a really big deal to furries,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be private. So you know, having the audience demand it, it\u2019s kind of counter-furry, I\u2019d say.\u201d\n\nAnother thing that makes The Masked Singer less than furry? It\u2019s definitely not living up to the high-kink potential of its concept. \u201cThis show is kind of tamed down from what could be if you gave it to a bunch of furries,\u201d said Patch. \u201cBecause celebrities, you know, they\u2019ve got to play safe. And they\u2019re not going to have sexual awakenings with their new selves. They won\u2019t tell you how it feels when the audience is going, \u2018take it off, take it off.\u2019\u201d\n\nPatch still thinks that, at heart, The Masked Singer is \u201cactually a really wholesome show, which I love.\u201d But as for whether it\u2019s specifically a furry show? \u201cYou know, the Monster is a giant ball of fun,\u201d Patch allowed, \u201cBut I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to have a lot of furry crushes on him. You know, having crushes on cartoons is where all the furries come from.\u201d (Patch\u2019s first furry infatuation? \u201cThe easy answer, which is probably the same for almost every furry, is Robin Hood the fox. I mean, Bugs Bunny, too.\u201d)\n\nSo which, if any, of season two\u2019s Masked Singer creatures are going to be some future furry\u2019s origin story? Patch took a look at some of his favorites to determine their crushworthiness.\n\nNote: at the time of this interview, Ladybug and Penguin had not yet been announced, and we were still collectively operating under the very false impression that Thingamajig was an Asparagus. Our sincerest apologies to Thingamajig.\n\nFlower\n\nPhoto: Fox\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s funny. I used to joke about Planties and Plant-suiters. It doesn\u2019t really exist, but I went looking and found a few in the furry world. There\u2019s someone who has like, a really beautiful Audrey suit, from Little Shop of Horrors.\u201d\n\nButterfly\n\nPhoto: Fox\n\n\u201cOh, do Flower and Butterfly have some extra-special energy together?\u201d\n\nEagle\n\nPhoto: Fox\n\n\u201cI think the Eagle looks kind of crushworthy. He\u2019s kind of fierce.\u201d\n\nEgg\n\nPhoto: Fox\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s goofy as hell.\u201d\n\nRottweiler\n\nPhoto: Fox\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s tough, man. I liked his looks.\u201d And as for his backup dancers, \u201cThose actually look like puppy play masks, which is a whole other level of \u2026 Interesting. And I like that he\u2019s dancing in front of a fire hydrant, which is actually a feature at the leather bar the Eagle in San Francisco where we have our furry parties.\u201d\n\n[Author\u2019s note: We\u2019re not going to get into it into it here, but in case you\u2019re that same person from the earlier paragraph who didn\u2019t know what furries are, puppy play is a role-play kink involving leather dog masks. The furry/puppy/leather bar Venn Diagram? Is hearty!]\n\nFox\n\nPhoto: Fox\n\n\u201cFox is definitely going to be popular with the furries. You know, generally, if you step into a room with a bunch of furries in it, and you just yell \u2018ShadowFox!\u2019 [one of the most common names of all fursonas], you\u2019ll get about five heads turning. Foxes are a very popular species.\u201d\n\nThingamajig\n\nPhoto: Fox\n\n\u201cI can imagine jokes about him hanging out by the fire hydrant.\u201d\n\n[Author\u2019s note: Again, this was a hot Asparagus take. We cannot apologize enough to Mister Thingamajig.]\n\nIce Cream\n\nPhoto: Fox\n\n\u201cIce cream\u2019s gotta be a really chill dude.\u201d\n\nTree\n\nPhoto: Fox\n\n\u201cTree is very, very festive. Christmas tree here, but it\u2019s not Christmas. The party\u2019s whenever Tree shows up. Can you imagine them all together in one room? Like having a party with you? I would just think I\u2019d died and just went to furry heaven.\u201d", "description": "Patch O\u2019Furr, the husky behind furry news site Dogpatch Press, sniffs out The Masked Singer\u2019s season 2 contestants, and explains how the show is and is not courting furries.", "authors": ["Rebecca Alter"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/02/masked-singer/02-rottweiler-the-masked-singer-lede.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
