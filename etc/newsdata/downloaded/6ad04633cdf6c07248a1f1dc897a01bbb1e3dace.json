Her latest social-media jab came after Mrs. Clinton claimed Mr. Trump is a \u201cclear and present danger\u201d to the free world.\n\n\u201cThe president of the United States has betrayed our country,\u201d the Democrat tweeted Wednesday in reference to Mr. Trump\u2019s now public phone conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a political statement \u2014 it\u2019s a harsh reality, and we must act,\u201d Mrs. Clinton added. \u201cHe is a clear and present danger to the things that keep us strong and free. I support impeachment.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou idiot,\u201d Ms. Broaddrick replied. \u201cEvery time you open your mouth, another Democrat walks straight to the Republican Party and puts on a red MAGA hat.\u201d\n\nAt issue is the president\u2019s decision to briefly mention an abandoned investigation into Hunter Biden, the son of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, and his ties to a Ukrainian energy company.\n\nMr. Trump said that Mr. Biden \u201cwent around bragging that he stopped the prosecution\u201d and that it should be re-examined.\n\n\u201cSee if you can look into it\u2026 it sounds horrible to me,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\n\nThe Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division determined that no campaign finance laws were broken by the president\u2019s comment.\n\nThe Clinton family has denied the rape allegations for decades and labeled them \u201cfalse and outrageous\u201d in 1999.\n\nYou idiot. Every time you open your mouth, another Democrat walks straight to the Republican Party and puts on a Red MAGA hat. https://t.co/pcsXoQiEdV \u2014 Juanita Broaddrick (@atensnut) September 25, 2019\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
