Cory Booker, shared her thoughts in an article for The Daily Beast in which she pulled no punches speaking about the Trump administration's rhetoric on immigration, directly linking it to the Aug. 3 shooting in Texas.\n\n\u201cThe story that the current administration repeats ad nauseam is about a \u201cviolent invasion\u201d of immigrant hordes \u2014 the exact same words used by the gunman who targeted our Latino community and shot down 22 innocent people in El Paso last month,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThis last week\u2019s denial of refugees from the Bahamas fleeing the destruction of Hurricane Dorian because they could be \u201cvery bad gang members\u201d saw thousands of climate refugees abandoned to squalid conditions.\u201d\n\nROSARIO DAWSON POSTS TOPLESS VIDEO TO MARK 40TH BIRTHDAY\n\nThe star highlighted the importance of telling positive stories about immigrants in the U.S. as well as the consequences of misrepresenting them.\n\n\u201cICE raids and hate crimes don\u2019t happen in a vacuum.

If we want to heal this country\u2019s deep scars on these issues, we need to look at the root causes and treat them at the source. When it comes to immigration, this is more than just a political crisis\u2014we\u2019re suffering a crisis of our very humanity. And one way to change the debate in Washington is by changing the stories we produce and consume in our own lives.\u201d\n\nDawson pointed to a new web series that she helped make and co-stars in titled \u201cThe North Pole\u201d as an example of something telling worthwhile stories about immigrants. The series is set in Oakland, Calif., and follows four young people as they deal with issues such as immigration struggles, wildfires, racial tensions and much more.\n\nThe actress, who fans may know from roles in films like \u201cRent,\u201d \u201cMen in Black II\u201d and \u201cHe\u2019s Got Game,\u201d is also known for her political activism. She backed Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 2016 campaign for president and then endorsed Green Party candidate Jill Stein once Hillary Clinton defeated him.
