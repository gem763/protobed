Doha is keen to show it is tackling allegations of worker exploitation as it prepares to host the 2022 soccer World Cup, which it hopes will boost its economy and development.\n\nThe statement said the cabinet had adopted new legislation related to the draft law on a minimum wage, though it did not disclose what level the wage could be.\n\nIt added it passed another draft law which will lead to the scrapping of exit permits for all workers, adding work was also underway to enable employees to change employers more easily.\n\nQatar last year eliminated exit visas for some foreign migrant workers, but rights groups considered the reform incomplete as it did not apply to domestic workers and allowed companies to keep the visa requirement for up to 5% of staff.\n\nThe International Labor Organization described the measures as \"a momentous step forward in upholding the rights of migrant workers\" and said they were aimed at ending the \"kafala\" (sponsorship system).\n\nThis system is common in Gulf states where large portions of the population is foreign. In Qatar it requires workers to obtain their employers' consent before changing jobs, which advocate groups say leaves them open to abuse.\n\n\"These steps will greatly support the rights of migrant workers, while contributing to a more efficient and productive economy,\" the ILO said in a statement late on Wednesday.\n\nIt said these new reforms were expected to come into force by January 2020.\n\nMany of the workers toiling on Qatar's building sites, sweeping its streets and cleaning private homes come from Asian countries like Nepal, India and the Philippines.\n\nDoha has responded to criticism by rights groups by enacting a broad reform program to guard worker rights and improve its image abroad.", "description": "Qatar, along with other wealthy Gulf Arab states, has come under fire for what rights groups describe as poor labor conditions.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/103202456-1571320624020gettyimages-472143962r.jpg?v=1571320702", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
