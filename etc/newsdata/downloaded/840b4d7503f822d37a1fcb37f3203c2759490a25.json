Packages were also one area of concentration for the Postal Service as it worked on a reform plan to shore up its finances.\n\nThe Postal Service experienced a 1.6 percent decline in revenue across first-class mail \u2013 its primary revenue driver \u2013 as well as a 3 percent decline in marketing mail revenue and an 11.2 percent decline in periodicals revenue.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe continue to face imbalances in our business model that must be fixed through legislative and regulatory change,\u201d Postmaster General and Chief Executive Officer Megan J. Brennan said in a statement.\n\nThe Postal Service ended fiscal 2018 with a net loss of $3.9 billion.\n\nLosses for the latest quarter ($2.26 billion) were up from $1.49 billion from the same period last year. Revenue of $17.1 billion was slightly lower than last year.\n\nLosses at the Postal Service between 2007 through 2018 are about $69 billion. The last time the agency recorded a profit was more than a decade ago. It has also defaulted on more than $40 billion in payments owed to pre-fund retiree health care expenses.\n\nThroughout recent months, the U.S. Post Office has considered a number of reforms to attempt to put itself on firmer financial footing.\n\nBrennan told lawmakers in May the agency is considering scaling back mail deliver to five days per week, from the current six, as it works on a plan to shore up its financial situation. As part of that plan, the Post Office would deliver packages seven days per week.\n\nBrennan credited a \u201cflawed business model\u201d as the root cause of the agency\u2019s financial instability. This model, she says, imposes significant costs \u2013 like an unaffordable retiree health benefit plan and price caps \u2013 on the Postal Service while constraining its ability to raise revenue in order to offset those costs.\n\n\u201cAbsent legislative reform, in all probability we\u2019ll be out of cash in 2024 and that will threaten our ability to meet our obligation to the American public,\u201d Brennan said.\n\nAnd if the agency makes all of its mandatory payments \u2013 including those retiree benefits \u2013 Brennan said the agency would be out of cash in 2020.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX BUSINESS APP\n\nTotal operating expenses for the most recent quarter increased 4.3 percent \u2013 or $797 million \u2013 to $19.3 billion.\n\nLast April, the president created a task force to examine the Postal Service and its operations. In December, the task force released a range of proposals with the aim of placing it on a path to sustainability.\n\nRecommendations included developing a new pricing model, which eliminates across-the-board price caps and suggests charging \u201cmarket-based prices\u201d for both mail and package items that are not considered essential postal services. The report also suggested \u201cfranchising the mailbox\u201d to private shipping couriers, meaning companies like FedEx and UPS could place items in private mailboxes.", "description": "The agency has warned it could be out of cash by 2024.", "authors": ["Brittany De Lea"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/12/0/0/post-office-istock.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"}
