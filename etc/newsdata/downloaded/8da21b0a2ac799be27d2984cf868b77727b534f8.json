But he also said that neither of those possibilities could be ruled out.\n\nAs a precautionary measure, the presence of the army and state police will be ramped up in the region.\n\nPungarabato lies on Guerrero\u2019s border with Michoac\u00e1n in the Tierra Caliente region, which includes parts of inland Guerrero and Michoac\u00e1n. According to state police, the nine Tierra Caliente municipalities in Guerrero are dominated by organized crime groups from Michoac\u00e1n such as the Familia Michoacana and the Caballeros Templarios, and are considered some of the most violent municipalities in the state.\n\nAccording to government sources who spoke to the news magazine Proceso, organized crime groups in Pungarabato and five other nearby municipalities have been imposing a curfew and limiting freedom of movement for several days.\n\nArmed civilians have set up checkpoints on the highway between Arcelia and Ciudad Altamirano, they said.\n\nThe sources said that leaders of the Familia Michoacana and Caballeros Templarios cartels in Guerrero have made a temporary alliance, and are preparing to fend off an attempt by the CJNG to take over.\n\nResidents of the municipalities told Proceso that for the past several days they have been hearing messages played on loudspeakers urging people to stay in their homes because of the violence.\n\nSource: El Universal (sp), Proceso (sp)", "description": "Guerrero is stepping up security in the Tierra Caliente region after a video appeared showing a convoy of armed civilians entering Pungarabato.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://mk0mexiconewsdam2uje.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/security-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-16"}
