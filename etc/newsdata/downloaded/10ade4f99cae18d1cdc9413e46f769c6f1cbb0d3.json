Nori has been stealing the show at Ye's Sunday Services (like literally stealing by grabbing herself a mic and moving it center stage\u2014on multiple occasions!), making videos with her mom Kim Kardashian and fave Jojo Siwa, teaching her brother how to sing, and bringing the dance moves. So like, girl knows how to work the spotlight!\n\nAnd if you needed more proof, Kim just posted some videos from Kanye's concert in Detroit yesterday, and North was singing her heart out\u2014she even knew all of the words to the songs! I mean, she wasn't mic'ed up like all of the other singers (lol), but still, it's super cute:\n\nI'm sorry, can we just look at how invested she is in giving her best performance:\n\nView photos Photo credit: Instagram More\n\nUgh and her missing front tooth I can't! \ud83d\ude29\n\nView photos Photo credit: Instagram More\n\nNorth was also jumping around the stage, following the choreography with the other singers, and not missing a lyric, which is pretty impressive for a five-year-old. Plus, she didn't seem to mind that there was a big crowd, cause clearly she recognizes her own talent and knows that she's meant to be on a stage.\n\nSo while I know that there's a lot of excitement about Kanye's \"Jesus Is King\" album dropping soon, can I please request some original North tracks? It's what the people really want!\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "Giving the people what they want!", "authors": ["Alanna Lauren Greco"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/YuvfLiLA98QqDGfMw6fe5w--~B/aD0xMDIwO3c9MjAzMjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cosmopolitan_438/58730fcc6a74c509169876bc2cc1205a", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
