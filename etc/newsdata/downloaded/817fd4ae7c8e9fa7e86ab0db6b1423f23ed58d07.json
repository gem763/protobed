The winners will be announced next month.\n\nThere is the shrill kerfuffle among European bee eater birds in Croatia and a Richmond Park red deer wearing bracken in London.\n\n(Image: Valtteri Mulkahainen)\n\n(Image: Mike Rowe)\n\nA damselfly in the Norfolk Broads seems to wave and a Lincolnshire grey seal looks like he\u2019s having a belly laugh.\n\nIn Antarctica a seal and penguin square up, and a common jack is chased by a shark in the Bahamas.\n\n(Image: Lloyd Durham Photography)\n\n(Image: Lisa Vanderhoop)\n\nA bashful brown bear hides \u00adbehind a tree in Finland as an Alaskan cousin covers his eyes after a meal.\n\nBut think of the white bird covered by rhino wee. Egrets, he\u2019s had a few, then again too few to mention.\n\n(Image: Anthony N Petrovich)\n\n(Image: Tilakraj Nagaraj)\n\nWorking alongside international wildlife charity The Born Free Foundation, the Comedy Wildlife Photography Awards hopes to share with the public the true playfulness of the animal kingdom.\n\nHowever, there is a serious message behind the competition - to raise awareness of the importance of protecting the environment for the world\u2019s creatures.\n\n(Image: Thomas D. Mangelsen)\n\n(Image: Vlado Pirsa)\n\nThe organisers of the now annual competition say it was \"the result of two factors: Firstly, a need for a photography competition that was light hearted, upbeat, possibly unpretentious and mainly about wildlife doing funny things. Four years on and these objectives seem to have been met. Secondly, and way more importantly, this competition is about conservation.\"\n\nThey add: \"None of us are perfect, all of us at some point will fly somewhere, drive somewhere, cook something, burn something and probably provide some direct input into the general warming of the globe.\n\n\"Indirectly, we will also have some impact on the animals that share this planet with us. So the end result?\n\n(Image: Eric Fisher Photography)\n\n(Image: Kevin Sawford)\n\n\"By entering this competition it gives both Paul and Tom and the rest of you talented photographers a chance to do a little bit for conservation.\n\n\"How? Well\u2026 you are now obviously going to go to your office, home, pub, club or wherever and talk about the dire need for us all to be conservationists in our own little way.\n\n\"Also, perhaps you will go to Born Free\u2019s website and have a look at the work they do and spread that word as well.\n\n(Image: Harry M. Walker)\n\n\"It\u2019s not a lot necessarily but it is the right step forwards. And one step leads to the next step. With your help and the help of Born Free it\u2019s way more than we could possibly have done without them and without you.\"\n\nTo find out more about the Comedy Wildlife Photography Awards visit their website: www.comedywildlifephoto.com", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Some delightful animal antics feature in this fun book", "authors": ["Emma Pryer", "Image", "Peter Haygarth", "Valtteri Mulkahainen", "Mike Rowe", "Lloyd Durham Photography", "Lisa Vanderhoop", "Anthony N Petrovich", "Tilakraj Nagaraj", "Thomas D.
