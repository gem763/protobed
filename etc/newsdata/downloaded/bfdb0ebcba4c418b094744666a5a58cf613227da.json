This year is the 50th anniversary of the sale. (American Association of University Women \u2014 McLean Branch)\n\nColumnist\n\nWashington is a city built on words.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re into words, you may want to head over to the McLean Community Center this weekend. There you will find big words, little words and medium-size words, all stuffed between hard covers and soft covers at the annual used-book sale of the American Association of University Women\u2019s McLean branch.\n\nThis is the 50th anniversary of the book sale. It\u2019s survived the advent of Amazon, the Kindle and other assorted digital disrupters.\n\n\u201cWe were concerned about it, especially when the e-readers came out,\u201d said\n\nBetsy Schroeder, chair of the book sale committee. \u201cHow would it impact us? It has not.\u201d\n\nVolunteers have been gathering books for months. They have at least 30,000, sorted into 32 different categories. This being the Washington area \u2014 full of literate, globe-trotting, policy types \u2014 the Current Affairs, Travel and Military History categories are popular. But so is Cookbooks and a category that didn\u2019t exist 50 years ago: Graphic Novels.\n\nSince the sale has been around so long, veteran volunteers have been able to track trends.\n\n\n\nA brick from the house Francis Scott Key once lived in is on display in the Peabody Room in the Georgetown Public Library in Washington, D.C. The house was torn down in 1947 to make way for the Key Bridge. (John Kelly/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cOne thing amusing to me is that several years after a popular book is published, all of a sudden lots of people get rid of the book at the same time,\u201d Caroline Pickens said in an email. \u201cI can remember one year having dozens of copies of \u2018Coma.\u2019 A few years ago it was \u2018Seabiscuit.\u2019 Always seemed funny to me that so many people were moved to get rid of a book the same year.\u201d\n\nBethany S. Jones has been sorting the History category.\n\n\u201cI stopped counting donated copies of \u2018Team of Rivals,\u2019 \u201d she wrote. \u201cIs there anyone alive who has not read at least one Tom Friedman book? How about Jared Diamond? We have these titles and authors (and similar) in high multiples.\u201d\n\nNina and Tom Mc\u00adVeigh volunteer together. Tom works on the Reference category and is glad to see dictionaries still do well. He\u2019s noticed that every year brings three or four partial sets of Harvard Universal Classics \u2014 \u201cthe five foot shelf of books\u201d \u2014 but never a complete set.\n\nWrote Tom: \u201cHaven\u2019t been able to figure that out yet.\n\nPeople will start lining up hours before the doors open Friday morning. Many will head straight to the Special Price room, which is stocked with interesting and desirable titles, including a first edition of Larry McMurtry\u2019s 1968 \u201cIn a Narrow Grave\u201d ($200) and Gatien de Sandras de Courtilz\u2019s \u201cM\u00e9moires de M. D\u2019Artagnan,\u201d published in 1701 and the inspiration for \u201cThe Three Musketeers\u201d by Alexandre Dumas ($500).\n\nToo rich for your blood? Eight bucks will get you \u201cTugboats of New York: An Illustrated History\u201d by George Matteson.\n\nProceeds from the sale benefit the organization\u2019s scholarships and other charitable activities.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re hoping to break $50,000,\u201d Schroeder said.\n\nThe sale is 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. Friday, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Saturday and noon to 4 p.m. Sunday at 1234 Ingleside Ave. in McLean.

The mistake I made was using \u201conomatopeiac\u201d in reference to \u201cKnitted Northern\u201d when I meant \u201calliterative.\u201d\n\nOf course, the column was about making mistakes.\n\nMighty, mighty\n\nJerry McCoy is a librarian in the Peabody Room at the Georgetown Public Library. There has always been a lacuna among the books, maps and newspaper clippings that comprise the neighborhood history collection and that\u2019s a piece of one of Georgetown\u2019s most famous houses: the Key Mansion.\n\nThe onetime home of national anthem lyricist Francis Scott Key was dismantled in 1947 to make way for the Key Bridge. The idea was to rebuild the house in a new location. But that never happened, and the pile of bricks disappeared, probably finding their way into walls and patios around Georgetown.\n\nEnter Chris Barbuschak of the Virginia Room in the City of Fairfax Regional Library. Last year the family of Charles A. Jensen (1916-2007) of Falls Church, Va., donated a collection of their father\u2019s historic artifacts. It included something that didn\u2019t fit with the Virginia-related collection: a Key Mansion brick.\n\nAs McCoy posted on Facebook: \u201cWhen Chris called me a couple of months ago and asked if I wanted a brick from Key\u2019s Georgetown house, I felt like I had won the lottery!\u201d\n\nThe historic brick is now in a glass case in the Peabody Room.\n\nReunited and it feels so good\n\nClassmates from these area schools are reuniting in the coming weeks.\n\nNorthwood High Class of 1969 \u2014 Oct. 26.
