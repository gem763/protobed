There\u2019s a catch, though. Trump has to resign. Now.\n\nDuring his Friday show on HBO, Maher tossed out an offer to present President Trump with a $1 million check in exchange for his resignation. Maher\u2019s fear is that Trump will lose his bid for re-election and refuse to leave the office.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been saying for a very long time now that I don\u2019t think he\u2019s leaving,\u201d Maher said Friday night. \u201cI mean, he\u2019s wasn\u2019t going to leave the first time, he said it\u2019s all about \u2018it\u2019s rigged.\u2019 He could lose by a landslide in 2020 and I still think he would say \u2018it\u2019s rigged, fake news, deep state.\u2019 I just don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to get him out of there.\u201d\n\nMaher\u2019s opinion is that Trump can be bought, even though he claims he can\u2019t because he is already wealthy.\n\n\u201cThe exact opposite is true. The man is constantly for sale,\u201d Maher said. \u201cHe\u2019s worried about Ukrainian corruption? The only time corruption bothered Donald Trump is when he\u2019s not in on it.\u201d\n\nIn order to appeal to Trump\u2019s love of money, as Maher alludes, he is willing to hand over a personal check for $1 million and he\u2019s willing to bet that lots of his swell rich friends in Hollywood will do the same.\n\n\u201cSo, Mr. President, it is really very simple. You love money. We hate you. Take the money.\u201d\n\nThe HBO show host spitballed some names of entertainment business elites with more money than sense who would pony up plenty of money to oust Trump before the 2020 election.\n\nMaher has voiced his concern many times that if Trump loses re-election, he will refuse to leave office. \u201cHow about this: Just take my check for $1 million and I bet I could get another thousand people just from here to the beach including Malibu, of course, who would pay that much to see you resign,\u201d Maher said into the camera, and, he hoped, to the occupant of the West Wing. \u201cSo, Mr. President, it\u2019s really very simple. You love money, we hate you. \u2026 You could finally be the billionaire you always pretended you were. Yes, I said billionaire because of the kind of money I could get from \u2014 just off the top of my head \u2014 Oprah, Cher, Madonna, Lady Gaga, Bono, Jay Z, Beyonc\u00e9, Pink, Rihanna, Usher, Pharrell, Eminem. And that\u2019s just the ones with one name.\u201d\n\nThe wealthy spend money on crazy things all the time, Maher contends, and this expenditure would allow them to do some good, you see. He really does live in quite a bubble, doesn\u2019t he? With hopes of impeachment fleeting, Maher and his ilk are reaching a new level of desperation. With no other ideas popping into his head, Maher just wants to write a check and make his problem \u2013 President Trump \u2013 go away. The fact that he made such a lame-brained offer out loud and before millions of viewers as though it is a perfectly normal thing to do is the kind of action that makes me just shake my head. What are these people thinking?\n\nMaher has nurtured his fantasy that Trump will try to stay in office forever since before the 2016 election. He told his audience at that time that voters shouldn\u2019t vote for Trump. He said Trump would be president for life.\n\nBut I\u2019ve been doing this for 23 years on TV, I\u2019ve seen a lot, I know politics. This is different. I promise you, this will not make your life better. Once fascists get power, they don\u2019t give it up. You\u2019ve got President Trump for life.\u201d\n\nSurely with all that money, Maher could seek professional help for his terminal Trump Derangement Syndrome. Not only is bribing an elected official \u2013 much less the president \u2013 dumb, it is illegal. There is a little history between Maher and Trump, after all, where Trump held Maher legally accountable for his stunts on-air.\n\nFunny stuff but of course any kind of compensation offered to a sitting president to secure his resignation would not just qualify as an illegal bribe under federal law it would in fact define the offense. However, the quid pro quo as described by Maher was a bit foggy (at first the $1 million check was for a wager, then it was a payment for Trump if he quits his reelection bid, then maybe it was intended to secure a more timely resignation?) but perhaps that will work in Maher\u2019s defense when the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office reaches out to discuss the attempted bribery of a federal official. Scoff if you will but there\u2019s some case history to consider. Back in 2013, Citizen Trump filed a $5 million lawsuit against Maher claiming the comedian was in breach of contract. The reason? During an appearance on The Tonight Show, Maher had offered $5 million for documented proof that Trump was not the offspring of an orangutan (a jab at candidate Trump\u2019s earlier goading of President Obama to produce passport and college records for a similar payout). Trump eventually dropped the suit much to the amusement of Maher.\n\nCelebrity astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson was one of Maher\u2019s guests Friday night. He said something that was meant to be a joke, but it certainly rings true for at least half of the country. If Trump leaves office without incident, Maher would have nothing to make jokes about. He can use some new material, that\u2019s for sure.", "description": "\"We hate you.\"", "authors": ["Karen Townsend", "Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/BillMaher3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
