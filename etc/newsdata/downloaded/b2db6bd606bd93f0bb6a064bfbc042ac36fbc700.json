The problems had been there for a considerable amount of time.'\n\nCouncil prosecutor Roman Micairan said the restaurant was not well-maintained and lacked basic cleanliness.\n\nHe said food and meat were inadequately stored on top of each other, with juices dripping, while curry and rice was seen splashed around the walls of the kitchen.\n\n'Unsuspecting members of the public were exposed to a high risk of eating contaminated food and becoming very sick, or even worse,' Mr Micairan said.\n\nRestaurant owner Baljit Singh pleaded guilty to seven charges each of failing to comply with food business standards and contravening food business licence conditions.\n\nPunjabi Palace had no previous suspensions.\n\nBrisbane City Council found the live and dead insects as well as accumulated dirt on the stove (stock image)\n\nMr Singh, who has owned Punjabi Palace for 18 years, re-opened the restaurant 24 hours after its closure.\n\nHe previously hired a manager to oversee the restaurant while struggling with depression. The manager was sacked and Mr Singh immediately cleaned the restaurant before it was re-opened.\n\nMagistrate Sacker commended Mr Singh's 'very impressive work' in bringing the restaurant back to a standard but said he should have noticed the restaurant slipping into problems while being run by the now removed manager.\n\n'I accept Punjabi Palace is one of the most popular and successful Indian restaurants in Brisbane. That's no basis to not comply with the law,' she said.\n\nMr Singh lost $8,000 during the one-day closure.\n\nHe is now ensuring the venue has regular pest control and installed a CCTV camera in the kitchen.\n\nMr Singh was handed a $16,000 fine, with no conviction recorded. He was also ordered to pay the council $355.", "description": "Punjabi Palace, in South Brisbane, was forced to shut its doors  in June last year after\u00a0Brisbane City Council found the live and dead insects as well as accumulated dirt on the stove.", "authors": ["Zoe Zaczek For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/21/19857392-0-image-a-2_1571345682309.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
