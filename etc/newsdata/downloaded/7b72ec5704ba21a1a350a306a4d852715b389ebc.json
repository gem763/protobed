We all see what that did, not only did for our league but for all of us in America, for people in China as well. Sometimes you have to think through the things that you say that may cause harm not only for yourself but for the majority of people. I think that\u2019s just a prime example of that.\u201d\n\nLEBRON JAMES GRILLED ADAM SILVER ON WHETHER ROCKETS GM WOULD BE DISCIPLINED OVER HONG KONG TWEET: REPORT\n\nHe added in a tweet: \u201cMy team and this league just went through a difficult week. I think people need to understand what a tweet or statement can do to others. And I believe nobody stopped and considered what would happen. Could have waited a week to send it.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nJames said Tuesday he was done talking about the matter and that he was going to focus more on social justice issues in the U.S. rather than geopolitical problems facing other countries.", "description": "Former Golden State Warriors center Andrew Bogut appeared to call out LeBron James for the Lakers star\u2019s criticism of Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey over a tweet supporting pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong.", "authors": ["Ryan Gaydos", "Ryan Gaydos Is A Sports Reporter For Foxnews.Com", "Foxbusiness.Com.
