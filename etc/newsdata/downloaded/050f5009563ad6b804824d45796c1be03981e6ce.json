The jump is part of a global picture, which nations with small, open economies have \u201climited ability\u201d to change, she said.\n\nThe baht has emerged as a haven for some investors, underpinned by a current-account surplus and $220 billion of foreign reserves. The currency\u2019s near 7% climb against the dollar this year, the best in Asia, contributed to a slowdown in the trade-led Thai economy by hurting export competitiveness.\n\nThe resilience of the baht is a \u201cdouble-edged sword\u201d but a high level of economic stability is more important for long-term investors, Hansl said.\n\n\u201cIn that regard the Thai baht is a good sign,\u201d she said. \u201cInvestors are seeing Thailand as stable and safe place.\u201d\n\nThe Bank of Thailand said last month that speculation on the baht has subsided after an interest-rate cut and steps to curb some inflows.\n\nThe currency weakened 0.1% to 30.482 per dollar as of 11:03 a.m. in Bangkok.", "description": "Bank of Thailand Has Limited Scope to Curb Baht, World Bank Says", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic48d83d14fd514b25b61f94ab90d1ced9.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
