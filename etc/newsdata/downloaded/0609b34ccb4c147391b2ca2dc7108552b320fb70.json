REUTERS/Aly Song\n\nWith only 1,000 remaining, the Yangtze finless porpoise is a symbol of the damage done to China\u2019s longest river in a decades-long campaign to tame floods, reclaim farmland and industrialize the regions along its banks.\n\nPresident Xi Jinping\u2019s call for sustainable growth in the Yangtze \u201ceconomic belt\u201d has raised hopes that the river\u2019s last surviving mammal can become an emblem of China\u2019s environmental revival.\n\n\u201cIt has now been scientifically proven that the Yangtze porpoise is a unique species,\u201d said Jiang Meng, who heads a group that oversees the porpoise safe haven at Nanjing.\n\n\u201cIf it isn\u2019t protected well, the Chinese government will be under pressure,\u201d Jiang, secretary general of the Nanjing Yangtze Finless Porpoise Conservation Association, told Reuters.\n\nThe safe zone is tucked behind a \u201cecological red line\u201d that bans construction on 34 sq miles (88 sq km) of territory along the shore.\n\nRows of fish farms have been replaced by lotus ponds teeming with migratory birds. Fishing is restricted and ships are routed away from the zone, which is patrolled daily.\n\n\u201cWe chase them away - this is a core area so we can\u2019t let them fish here,\u201d said Yang Jinlong, a fisherman-turned-conservationist.\n\nChina counted 1,012 Yangtze porpoises in its last census in 2017, down from 2,500 in 1991, and the numbers are falling by about 10% a year, officials said.\n\nThe porpoise can still be saved, Jiang said. \u201cThe numbers are still falling but the rate of decline is slowing.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been done before, activists say. A decades-long conservation effort saved the giant panda, China\u2019s national symbol, from the brink of extinction. There are around 1,900 giant pandas today, and their numbers are rising.\n\n\u201cIt may be too little too late, but what they are doing is unprecedented,\u201d Todd Robeck, author of a recent study into the Yangtze porpoise, said of the effort to save the mammal.\n\n\u201cThey are putting in the right pieces to keep this animal from going extinct,\u201d said Robeck, vice president of conservation research at SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment in Orlando, Florida.\n\n\u201cHUMAN ACTIVITIES\u201d\n\nFrom its origins in the glaciers of Tibet to its delta in Shanghai on the eastern coast, the 4,000-mile Yangtze provides water to a third of China\u2019s population.\n\nIt has been the scene of profound and destructive environmental changes over the past 70 years, caused not only by giant feats of engineering like the Three Gorges Dam, but also a Mao-era campaign to drain lakes and wetlands.\n\nFor decades, its complex ecosystem was sacrificed in a frantic rush for economic growth.\n\nThe \u201cbaiji\u201d or white-finned dolphin, a larger cousin of the porpoise, was declared \u201cfunctionally extinct\u201d in 2006. The Chinese sturgeon is also on the brink of annihilation, with fish stocks plunging 90% in the last few decades.\n\nMany porpoises are killed in collisions with boats because noise pollution affects their echolocation, while a degraded habitat and polluted water exposes them to contagious diseases.\n\nA 10-year government action plan released in 2016 blamed \u201cintensified human activities\u201d for the fall in porpoise numbers and said past protection efforts failed to arrest the decline.\n\nHowever, the action plan was limited in scope, aiming only to \u201cstabilize\u201d porpoise populations, improve monitoring, raise public awareness, and deepen genetic and stem cell research.\n\nSAFE ZONES\n\nNanjing is considered a model protection zone, and it has spent around 30 million yuan since it opened in 2014 on surveillance equipment and a full-time staff of 20.\n\nElsewhere, authorities last month imposed a 10-year fishing ban from 2021 at Poyang, China\u2019s largest freshwater lake and another home to finless porpoises. The ban will affect 100,000 fishermen, Xinhua news agency reported.\n\nAnd a 40-mile (64 km) stretch of the Yangtze at Anqing, in Anhui province, has been declared a porpoise safe haven and off limits for fishing.\n\n\u201cWe are optimistic because the state has made protection a priority,\u201d said Chen Shouwen, a conservation official at Anqing\u2019s rural affairs bureau.\n\nActivists hope publicity will help save the porpoise, but some campaigns can misfire. Conservationists were enraged last year when authorities captured 14 wild porpoises and put them on display in marine parks in Shanghai and along the east coast.\n\nSlideshow (3 Images)\n\nResearchers have had some success in breeding porpoises artificially, but the numbers are small. China may be forced to preserve the species by storing reproductive cells and repopulating the river when conditions improve.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it will ever return to the way it was, but there might be some mitigation efforts where they can thrive quite normally in the Yangtze,\u201d Robeck said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really hopeful their efforts will be an example for what can be done in the future.\u201d", "description": "On a short stretch of the Yangtze river, three sleek grey porpoises twist in muddy waters near the city of Nanjing, protected from passing barges and ships by a row of yellow buoys.", "authors": ["David Stanway", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190908&t=2&i=1427429775&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8700M", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
