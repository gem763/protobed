REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - BP (BP.L) is increasing its Asian presence with an initial agreement, or memorandum of understanding, with China\u2019s Zhejiang Petroleum and Chemical Corporation (ZPCC) to build a 1 million tonne a year acetic acid plant, BP said on Friday.\n\nThe planned production site for acetic acid, which is used in chemical products such as paints and adhesives, would be part of ZPCC\u2019s refining and petrochemical plant in Zhoushan in eastern China, BP said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe potential new plant...would be BP\u2019s largest acetic acid producing site in the world. China is the world\u2019s largest acetic acid market and accounts for more than half of global production capacity,\u201d BP added.\n\nBP plans to sell more U.S. crude to Asia as its shale oil production grows, seeking to capitalise on growth in the world\u2019s key demand region.\n\nIn recent months, the British group deepened its ties with Indian conglomerate Reliance Industries (RELI.NS) by forging a fuel retailing joint venture to capitalise on rising demand in Asia\u2019s third-biggest economy.\n\nBP has also said it would build a network of charging hubs for electric vehicles with China\u2019s Didi Chuxing, betting on the world\u2019s largest market for such cars.\n\nZPCC is a mixed-ownership joint-venture company with private holdings and state-owned enterprises, BP said.\n\nA PetroChina unit has won a license to supply marine bunker fuel in Zhoushan on China\u2019s east coast, as the city\u2019s free trade zone looks to challenge Singapore as a regional shipping fuel hub, according to a company executive and local government official.", "description": "BP is increasing its Asian presence with an initial agreement, or memorandum of understanding, with China's Zhejiang Petroleum and Chemical Corporation (ZPCC) to build a 1 million tonne a year acetic acid plant, BP said on Friday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191018&t=2&i=1442248858&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9H0W7", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
