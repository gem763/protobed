The Japanese 10-year JGB yield rose 1.5 basis point to minus 0.215% JP10YTN=JBTC while the Australian 10-year yield rose more than 5 basis points to a six-week high of 1.142% .\n\nIn Europe, Germany's 30-year benchmark bond yield briefly broke into positive territory for the first time since Aug. 5.\n\nInvestors had bought bonds for many weeks on expectations that the ECB will dole out stimulus, with a cut in interest rates of at least 10 basis points fully priced in.\n\nSome traders also expect more measures including a deeper interest rate cut and a restart of its asset purchase programme.\n\nThe Fed is also widely expected to deliver an interest rate cut next week.\n\nGermany also signalled its readiness for relaxing its staunch opposition to deficit spending to support the economy, leading to speculation Berlin could issue more debt and curbing appetite for German bonds.\n\nFinance Minister Olaf Scholz said on Tuesday the country can counter a possible economic crisis by injecting billions of euros into the economy. the currency market, the dollar traded at 107.72 yen , its highest in six weeks.\n\nThe euro stood little changed at $1.1050 , while the British pound stood at $1.2351 GBP=D4 , near its six-week high of $1.2385 hit earlier in the week.\n\nOil prices rose on Wednesday after an industry report showed that crude stockpiles in the United States fell last week by more than twice the amount that analysts had forecast. Prices hovered near their strongest in six weeks despite small losses on Tuesday after U.S. President Donald Trump fired national security adviser John Bolton. departure of Bolton, who took a strident stance against Iran, raised speculation of improvement in U.S.-Iran relations and an eventual return of Iranian crude exports to the market.\n\nStill, the market was underpinned by Saudi Arabia's new energy minister's assurances of continued output cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.\n\nIn addition, geopolitical tensions in the Middle East are nowhere near subsiding after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced his intention to annex a large swathe of the occupied West Bank, a move condemned by Arab League foreign ministers. crude futures rose 0.7% to $62.80 a barrel while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude gained 0.8% to $57.84 per barrel.\n\n(Editing by Stephen Coates and Jacqueline Wong)", "description": "GLOBAL MARKETS-Rising bond yields support value stocks ahead of c.bank meetings", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEDA21BA_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
