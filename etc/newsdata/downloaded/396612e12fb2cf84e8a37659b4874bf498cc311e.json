As immigrants continue to birth this 'new America', we must remember all versions of our history and take ownership of our past while forging a new legacy,\" Gurung stated.\n\nThe fashion designer added that the aim of his latest collection, which marks the 10th anniversary of his brand, is \"to celebrate hope, courage, and present an ode to the true American dream\".\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
