Those documents, reviewed by the Washington Post, describe crumbling warehouses with \u201cleaking asbestos panel roof systems\u201d; a drone pilot training facility with sinkholes and a bat infestation; and a middle school infested with mould.\n\nThe new analysis of those reports illustrates the scope of the impacts that Mr Trump\u2019s emergency declaration earlier this year could have.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

The current situation exposes the public to an \u201cunacceptable risk\u201d of being exposed to an explosive accident, according to a 2018 report, should a terrorist attack mobilise aircraft at the facility that are kept at-the-ready with munitions on board.\n\nIn declaring that emergency, Mr Trump was able to divert $3.6 billion in construction funds from the Defence Department, saying that the immigration crisis at the US-Mexico border justified it.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
