Trey Gowdy is leaving his job at Fox News to join President Donald Trump\u2019s legal team, the president\u2019s personal lawyer announced Wednesday.\n\nJay Sekulow said said the former South Carolina lawmaker will join the team as an outside adviser.\n\n\u201cI have known Trey for years and worked with him when he served in Congress,\u201d Sekulow said. \u201cHis legal skills and his advocacy will serve the president well. Trey\u2019s command of the law is well known and his service on Capitol Hill will be a great asset as a member of our team.\u201d\n\nA Fox spokesperson told CNBC earlier in the day that Gowdy\u2019s affiliation with the network was terminated amid rumors of his new role. A source said his role on Trump\u2019s legal team would be a conflict of interest to future contributions to Fox News.\n\nGowdy declined to seek re-election in 2018 after four terms in the House. He was first elected to Congress in 2010, and chaired of the House oversight committee and the House Benghazi committee.\n\nHis addition to Trump\u2019s legal team comes as the president prepares for an impeachment battle over his pressure on Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, who is seeking to unseat the president in the 2020 election.", "description": "Oct. 9 (UPI) \u2014 Former U.S. Rep.
