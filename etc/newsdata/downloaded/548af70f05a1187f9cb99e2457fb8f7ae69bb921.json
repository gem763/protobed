They pose a threat to our security. They are unwanted in Denmark.\n\n\u201cThe government will, therefore, do everything possible, to prevent them from returning to Denmark.\u201d\n\nEverything you need to know about the Kurds in one place: https://t.co/EE8rZXJmKj \u2014 Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) October 12, 2019\n\nKurdish forces in Syria are currently holding an estimated 2,000 ISIS militants who have European passports. The Danish government believes that at least 158 Danish citizens have joined forces with Islamist groups in Iraq and Syria since 2012.\n\nAt least 27 are believed to still be in the conflict zone and 12 have been imprisoned by the Kurds.\n\n\u201cThere is a risk that the Kurdish-controlled IS-camps in the border area will collapse and that foreign warriors with Danish citizenship will move toward Denmark,\u201d said Frederiksen on Monday.\n\nThe new law would allow the government to remove citizenship for fighters who have dual citizenship without a court order. However, the legislation would not apply to those who only have Danish citizenship. Other European countries are said to be considering similar proposals, fearing prisoners released in the Syrian conflict may return to Europe to commit acts of terrorism.\n\nDenmark Introduces Permanent Border Controls with Sweden Due to Gang Violence https://t.co/JNjQkevg1o \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 13, 2019\n\nThe United Kingdom has already stripped citizenship from dozens of fighters who travelled to Islamic State-controlled territory to support the terrorist group, with as many as two individuals a week having their passports revoked during 2018. Some have been higher-profile cases than others, with self-confessed \u201cenemy of Britain\u201d \u2018Jihadi Jack\u2019 losing his citizenship this year.\n\nMore controversial was \u201cno regrets\u201d Jihadi bride Shamima Begum, who enjoyed the support of several UK newspapers that argued the government\u2019s decision to remove her citizenship would be inhumane. The young woman, who was reported to have worked as a sharia enforcer for the ISIS administration cooly described seeing a decapitated head and feeling no remorse for the killing because she believed the man had been anti-Muslim.\n\nResponding to the decision by then-home secretary Sajid Javid to revoke her citizenship, Begum said it was \u201ca bit unjust\u201d. The case illustrated the difficulty of revoking dual citizenship status, however, as Bangladesh also renounced its claim on her, leaving the Jihadist potentially stateless.\n\nThe law comes in the wake of news that Denmark will enact permanent border controls with Sweden due to rising gang violence and bombings in the Scandinavian country.\n\nIn June, the Danish Justice Minister S\u00f8ren Pape Poulsen admitted that Denmark has a \u201cbig problem\u201d with migrant criminals and that the government must make the process of deportation easier.", "description": "Denmark has announced plans to revoke citizenship from those who have joined terrorist groups like ISIS in the Middle East.", "authors": ["Kurt Zindulka"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/08/ISIS-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
