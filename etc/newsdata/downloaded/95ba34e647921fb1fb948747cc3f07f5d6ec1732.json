Unfortunately, troubling data from the Center for Retirement Research (CRR) at Boston College shows this often isn't happening.\n\nThe problem, the CRR found, is that in many two-income households, only one spouse has access to a workplace retirement plan and the other doesn't. In these households, the spouse with the workplace plan should be saving more to pick up the slack for the spouse without one -- but this often isn't happening. The result is that the couple isn't ready for retirement when the time comes.\n\nThis doesn't have to happen to you and your spouse if you work together to make a retirement savings plan that makes sense for both of you.\n\nTipped over glass jar full of coins that's labeled 401(k) More\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nToo many workers don't consider their spouse in making 401(k) contributions\n\nAccording to the CCR, workplace retirement plans are available only to around half of all workers in the private sector. When these plans aren't available, most people don't end up saving anything for retirement. The result is that many dual-income couples have just one saver.\n\nUnfortunately, the single saver rarely contributes enough to a 401(k) to ensure that 70% or more of combined household income is replaced in retirement, according to the CRR. In fact, the average contribution rate to a 401(k) by a single saver in a dual-income household is actually below the average contribution that each spouse makes in situations where both members of a couple work and save. In dual-income households where both spouses have a workplace retirement plan, the average contribution rate is 9.4% of income, while the average contribution rate when there's only one saver in a dual income couple is just 8.4%.\n\nOne result is that, when considering total household income, couples with only one saver end up putting just 4.9% of household income away for retirement. This is well below the recommended minimum 10% of income you need to save to have close to enough money to live on in retirement. And in fact, thanks to longer life spans and more-conservative projections for investment returns in coming years, most experts actually advise saving much more than 10%.\n\nWhat to do if only one spouse has a workplace retirement plan\n\nIf only one spouse has a 401(k) plan, it's imperative both partners work together to establish joint goals for retirement savings that ensure sufficient income for the household.\n\nOne of the easiest ways to address the problem is for the worker with a 401(k) to double the contribution to account for the fact the other spouse doesn't have a 401(k) at work. The risk of this is that the spouse without the 401(k) will be left with little for retirement in the event of a divorce. While a divorce settlement agreement can and should ensure both spouses have shared access to retirement assets, this doesn't always happen in practice.\n\nThe spouse making 401(k) contributions for both partners could also end up hitting the 401(k) contribution limit, which is $19,000 in 2019 for most workers or $25,000 for those over 50 eligible to make additional catch-up contributions.", "description": "Troubling research shows many dual-income households are falling short of retirement savings", "authors": ["Christy Bieber", "The Motley Fool"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Vvu0826Z9v3iEyAmRc6VGw--~B/aD00Njg7dz03MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/motleyfool.com/21040faa16ba24723ccf2cb2f94dd42e"}
