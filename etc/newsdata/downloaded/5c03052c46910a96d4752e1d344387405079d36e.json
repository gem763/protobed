Use that energy judiciously by focusing on all that's good and positive in your life. Pluto and Saturn are casting a huge influence from an astrological point of view. They're heavy players that can wreak havoc down here in our human experience. You may notice people snapping under the strain. Last week the Sun met with Saturn in a square. This week the Sun meets up with the volcanic heavyweight, Pluto. These two astrological juggernauts will travel together into next year. It heralds a time of contraction and profound transformation.\n\nOn a personal level, this is very good for you. The ancient Lord of the Underworld, Pluto, is leading you to a moment of reckoning. He'll help you dig deep and discover your life's purpose. A moment will come when truth rises up out of the darkness where it's been hiding.\n\nQuestions will arise about the quality of your life and where it's taking you. Are you getting the most out of your talents and potential? Old long-buried memories will bubble up out of the unconscious that will bless you with moments of enlightenment.\n\nA lovely Mercury trine Neptune on Monday will help you appreciate all the love that it's in your life. The appreciation of all that's wonderful and good is essential. Make it grow.\n\nGrasp the outcome you seek and hang on to it. Your determination will turn it into reality. Trust the rock-solid inner source of wisdom that resides within you. This is a time of rebirth and rejuvenation. The phoenix is rising out of the ashes of the past.\n\nHere is your horoscope for the week of Monday, October 14, 2019.\n\nAries\n\nWhen we respond to failures and disappointments with a bold and determined attitude, they become positive turning points. They're essentially tectonic shifts that force us to rebuild a bigger and better life. The benevolent source that protects and guides you sometimes has to give you a hard shove in order to get you onto the right path. Pluto's powerful influence is showing you how to utilize your creativity and resourcefulness. It must be said that you're doing fabulously well. You're turning your life into a story of success. Big changes are happening and they're all moving you in the right direction.\n\nTaurus\n\nIt's clear now that there's much about your potential that hasn't yet been discovered. Pluto's influence is causing you to look deep into yourself. Not long ago, your life was full of factors that made you feel doubtful and anxious. Pluto is urging you to focus on the positive rather than the negative elements in your life. And as you do, you'll rethink a big plan which is a contender for success. All it needs is a little tweak here and there. An encouraging turn of events will unblock and get you moving forward. You'll find the wisdom and the inspiration to make the right moves at all the right times.\n\nGemini\n\nDon't give up hope concerning a rather daunting romantic entanglement. You've got your pride plus a strong emotional need to not be let down. Be mindful of not isolating yourself and cutting off communication. There'll soon be plenty to celebrate. Pluto is helping you to clear away a cloud of obfuscation allowing you to have an incisive look into your own shadow. A revelation will come that will help you see a soft glow of light at the end of that proverbial long dark tunnel. You're being guided toward the fulfilment of long-held desire. Warmth and love are destined to grace your future.\n\nCancer\n\nYou're a patient and tolerant person. You rarely take umbrage at transgressions made against you. Well, usually, that is, but something that's taken place recently might prove to be the exception. Just as you think everything is settled, it changes. Someone's obdurate attitude is pushing the envelope a little too far. It's time to draw a line in the sand and stand up for what's important to you. Pluto's making it clear that there are people who may not work in the same way as you do. He's teaching you how to be decisive and clear about what you will and will not put up with anymore. All you have to do is be strong within yourself.\n\nLeo\n\nIssues of a practical nature are holding you back from doing what your heart is calling for. A compromise can be struck that will ease your inner tension. There's no need to rush. Pluto's influence will help you get to the heart of a crucial matter fast. You have every reason to expect success. Think in terms of doing things bit by bit, step by step and you'll make constructive progress. By drawing on experience, you'll avoid making the same mistakes again. Where once you were powerless in a sensitive situation, you can now wield more power. Luck is on your side. Sooner or later, and it's more likely to be sooner, you'll get your reward.\n\nVirgo\n\nAfter all you've been through, you're due for a reward. A lottery win would be nice, but the stars can't promise anything that grandiose. Perhaps, your name is on the nominations list for a prize. Something good is in the works. Pluto's influence this week might offer a monetary perk. But perhaps more importantly, something remarkable is going on at a deep psychological and spiritual level. Reassuring news will warm your heart and boost your hope. As you reach a new understanding of what is going on in your inner world, your outer material Universe will reflect that positive shift.\n\nLibra\n\nYou're crossing the threshold into an important new chapter in your life. Pluto is prying open a window of opportunity that will reveal a bright and sunny vista. It's been there all the time, but you just never saw it. The blinkers are coming off. You'll realize that you haven't yet come anywhere close to the peak of your potential. You can now start working toward what you were really meant to accomplish in this lifetime. Dismiss all those negative and discouraging thoughts. Your most wondrous adventures are about to begin. Take a deep breath and move forward with certainty and confidence.\n\nScorpio\n\nYou're a unique individual with a unique mission. You may share similar goals with others in your life, but there are some rudimentary variations in regard to the process that must be followed to get there. Certain heartfelt values must be honoured. Time is short \u2013 it's true, but you mustn't allow a perceived sense of urgency to compel you to make a decision that requires more reflection. Move fast, but not in haste. Pluto will help you cut to the chase on a certain matter that concerns you. You'll get a clear view of what it entails. Go where your heart bids you to go. Follow your true path.\n\nSagittarius\n\nPressures have undermined your optimism and faith in reaching a heartfelt dream. Fitting a square peg in a round hole isn't easily done, but things are changing now in a good way. You'll round off those sharp edges and make a nice fit. The time is rapidly approaching when you'll meet up with something wonderful. Be careful, though, to not think yourself into a state of confusion. Pluto's influence this week will clear the path ahead. You're on a passionate and exciting mission that has every chance of reaching a most fortunate outcome. An intrepid spirit will attract the help of the stars.\n\nCapricorn\n\nIt's amazing how we can be consumed by what appear to be impossible challenges. Yet years, or even just months on, they become insignificant and irrelevant. It only goes to show how quickly things can change. Nothing lasts for ever. Not even our problems. Life's experiences have taught you much. You're an expert at troubleshooting. Despite your concerns, you are on a the quickest and most direct road to success. There are few detours on the way, but you'll get there. Pluto is acting as your personal bodyguard by protecting you against negative encounters.\n\nAquarius\n\nWhatever the turmoil that you're enduring, keep in mind that your outer world is a creation of your inner world. Sages through the centuries have wisely advised us of this. You're the director and producer of your Academy Award winning movie called My Life \u2013 The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. Pluto's prominent position in the astrological drama this week is leading you to a profound insight into your own psychological inner landscape. A deeper self-awareness is bursting into your consciousness. A startling epiphany will mark a positive turning point in your conquest of life.\n\nPisces\n\nWe're often too quick to dismiss ideas as unworkable. This causes us to miss out on unique opportunities. Pluto's influence this week will compel you to be more open-minded about what's feasible. Allow yourself some time to relax. You're fully entitled to have a breathing space from your travails. Your determination and your resilience are virtues to be proud of. They're the tools that have always enabled you to grasp victory from the jaws of defeat. Keep your thoughts focused on what brings inspiration and the road to success will reveal itself.
