Those short clips that make us eager \u2014 or fearful \u2014 to see the films.\n\nNot only are trailers vital to a movie\u2019s opening-day success, but they regularly garner tens of millions of views on YouTube, where they\u2019re dropped with the fanfare of a new Beyonc\u00e9 album.\n\nHere, The NY Post honours the biggest, boldest and most talked-about trailers of the year.\n\nMost likely to cause nightmares: Cats (December 26)\n\nThe movie version of Andrew Lloyd Webber\u2019s musical has been the stuff of legends since the moment it was announced. Every single detail is as unbelievable as the Lost City of Atlantis. The furry Jellicles are played by Taylor Swift, Idris Elba, James Corden, Jennifer Hudson and Judi Dench. And that unlikely bunch are being turned into tiny, CGI human-feline hybrids. It sounds like something out of L. Ron Hubbard\u2019s library. And then we saw the trailer. It\u2019s all true \u2014 and terrifying.\n\nMost damaging to Will Smith\u2019s career: Aladdin (May 23)\n\n\u201cI can show you the world: shining, shimmering, BLUE.\u201d When we got our first look at Will Smith\u2019s genie in Aladdin, our worst fears were confirmed: The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air appeared as though he\u2019d jumped into a vat of indigo dye and strolled onto the set of an old PlayStation game. The internet piled on the mockery; thankfully, the movie itself is more magical than that premature peek.\n\nMost likely to make you cry: A Beautiful Day in the Neighbourhood (January 23, 2020)\n\nMister Rogers and Tom Hanks are the ultimate nice guys. So, having the Forrest Gump actor play the beloved morning-show host promises to be a moving pairing, and the trailer proves it is. \u201cI think the best thing we can do is let people know that each one of them is precious,\u201d Hanks\u2019 Rogers says. If that doesn\u2019t make your eyes well up, they will when straphangers serenade him with his own theme song.\n\nMost improved by muting it: A Dog\u2019s Journey (August 15)\n\nThere wasn\u2019t much in the way of acting prowess or thrills in this one. Josh Gad\u2019s saccharine narration about being a reincarnated canine was weird, and Dennis Quaid goes overboard pretending to be a plaid-clad farmer. There are, however, many puppies. Lots of happy doggies slobbering and wagging and jumping. If you turn off the sound, this clip becomes a masterpiece.\n\nMost shocking transformation: Ma (August 22)\n\nThe sight of Octavia Spencer \u2014 the warm, supportive character in The Help and Hidden Figures \u2014 brings on a Pavlovian smile. So it goes in the first few seconds of the Ma trailer, when she buys a group of local teens some beer. Then the soundtrack quickly shifts to freaky thriller music, and we watch as she turns into a crazed stalker who makes threats, locks high-school kids in her basement and sews their lips together. After that trailer, you scream when you see her coming.\n\nThe year\u2019s happiest: Yesterday (June 27)\n\nWhat would it be like to hear Beatles songs as if they were brand-new? The trailer for the Danny Boyle/Richard Curtis rom-com gives us a perfect snapshot of the humour and emotion (we\u2019re not choked up, you\u2019re choked up) of watching star Himesh Patel perform Yesterday and Let It Be in a world where everyone else\u2019s memory is wiped clean of the Fab Four. If you wanted more, the movie serves it up. But the trailer works pretty well all on its own.\n\nMost outrage-inducing: Joker (October 3)\n\n\u201cAll I have are negative thoughts.\u201d While this line from the film could certainly apply to half of the reactions to the first Joker trailer, from the moment we got the first glimpse of Joaquin Phoenix\u2019s grim origin story, hot takes began to multiply online. It\u2019s a Taxi Driver rip-off! It\u2019s the best supervillain movie ever! It\u2019ll inspire crazies to violence! The furious debate hasn\u2019t stopped since, so you know it did something right.\n\nMost easily confused with a short film: The Lighthouse (Late October)\n\nA foghorn bleats, and Willem Dafoe and Robert Pattinson\u2019s craggy visages stare at the camera in crisp black and white. You could be forgiven for thinking this is a surrealist short film in its own right, or maybe the most confusing perfume ad ever. It certainly had us looking forward to finding out why Pattinson\u2019s character \u201cspilled the beans\u201d.\n\nBetter than the actual movie: Us (March 14)\n\nJordan Peele\u2019s second movie has the impossible task of living up to his near-perfect first film Get Out. And its trailer really did: From the plucky-stringed, goosebump-inducing version of I Got 5 On It to glimpses of a blood-drenched doppelganger family of Lupita Nyong\u2019o\u2019s adorable bunch, this horror preview scares the bejesus out of us. The film was pretty good, too. But not this good.\n\nThe darkest superhero trailer ever: Avengers: Endgame (April 24)\n\nTony Stark is dying. Captain America\u2019s in tears. Jeremy Renner is \u2026 cutting his own arm? The trailer for the final Avengers movie rolls out its grief-stricken plot like a deadly serious drama, rather than the action-packed Marvel extravaganza it was obviously going to be. What a relief, then, for that eleventh-hour appearance by snark ninja Paul Rudd.\n\nThis article originally appeared on The New York Post and was reproduced with permission", "description": "The Oscars, the Golden Globes, the SAG Awards: Movies get plenty of recognition as they commandeer the cultural conversation from December to February.", "authors": ["Sara Stewart", "Johnny Oleksinski"], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/9667a8be92578ae7e1d316db3b2ae85e?width=650", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
