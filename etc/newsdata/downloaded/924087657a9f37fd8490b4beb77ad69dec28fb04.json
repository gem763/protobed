Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., led the elected officials who entered a closed-door deposition with Defense Department official Laura Cooper to expose the secret kangaroo court Schiff is running in an effort to overturn the results of the 2016 election.\n\nHOUSE DEMS' IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY HEARING RESUMES AFTER GOP STORMS SECURE AREA\n\nDemocrats still can\u2019t get over the fact that the American people elected Trump instead of Hillary Clinton. Their unprecedented bitterness marks them as sore losers who reject the fact that elections have consequences.\n\nFor over 1,000 days, Democratic elected officials and their media allies have waged an unrelenting campaign of extraordinary presidential harassment \u2013 doing everything possible to stop President Trump from carrying out his agenda to Make America Great Again and to improve the lives of the American people.\n\nNow Gaetz and his colleagues are finally saying that enough is enough. They deserve the thanks of all Americans for their brave stand.\n\nFirst, the Democrats falsely claimed that Trump was a Russian agent. Then they lied again and said Trump is a racist. Then they warned that Trump would cause a recession. Now the phony scandal the Democrats have trotted out is Ukraine.\n\nNever before in American history has a duly elected president been treated so horribly by a deranged resistance \u2013 with the mainstream media willing accomplices.\n\nEveryone knows what failed investigations look like. Schiff \u2013 with the blessing of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. \u2013 is covering all the bases.\n\nSchiff\u2019s shady inquiry \u2013 being run in secret behind closed doors \u2013 goes against everything our legislative branch of government stands for.\n\nSchiff is running a fairy tale grand jury that has already determined the outcome \u2013 impeachment. There\u2019s no precedent for any of these petty partisan antics. Republicans have every right to protest.\n\nSince 1789, Congress has operated in a fair and respectful manner, where the minority party is afforded rights. Schiff has stripped the minority of its rights. That\u2019s because Schiff knows that if he gives Republicans any rights, they\u2019ll defeat his weak case in the blink of an eye.\n\nThe legislative branch is supposed to operate in an open and transparent manner designed to allow American citizens to look inside to see what\u2019s going on. Schiff is conducting his investigation in the shadows \u2013 the kind of proceeding we expect to find in dictatorships, not democracies.\n\nWhat is Schiff trying to hide? Sunlight is the best disinfectant, but Schiff\u2019s rotten operation smells from one end of Pennsylvania Avenue to the other.\n\nUnder Congress\u2019 constitutionally mandated oversight responsibilities in our system of checks and balances, the legislative branch is supposed to run fact-finding inquiries that seek the truth \u2013 not secret prosecutions weighing criminal charges and jail time.\n\nSchiff is running a fairy tale grand jury that has already determined the outcome \u2013 impeachment. There\u2019s no precedent for any of these petty partisan antics. Republicans have every right to protest.\n\nThe American people understand these basic truths: the presumption of innocence; the withholding of judgment until the facts are known; the right of the accused to question their accusers; and perhaps most importantly, that everyone is entitled to due process and basic fairness.\n\nSchiff doesn\u2019t think the American people are very smart and believes they won\u2019t catch on to his disgraceful witch hunt. He\u2019s wrong.\n\nThanks to courageous Republican members of Congress like Gaetz, Jim Jordan of Ohio and Mark Meadows of North Carolina, the American people are going to learn the truth about the Pelosi-Schiff clown show \u2013 and it will go down in flames in the court of public opinion.\n\nAdam Schiff ought to be ashamed of his disgraceful conduct. He\u2019s carrying out a political hit job for Hillary Clinton and the anti-Trump left who hate President Trump more than they love our country.\n\nThe most important question of the day was asked by President Trump when he tweeted \u201cWhere\u2019s the whistleblower?\u201d As the days and weeks pass by, it\u2019s become obvious that the whistleblower is now an inconvenience for Schiff.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nSchiff would have brought the whistleblower in to testify long ago unless there\u2019s a political downside to doing so. So, what\u2019s Schiff trying to cover up? Maybe his own actions?\n\nSchiff must think that the whistleblower\u2019s testimony and back story would expose this farce of an impeachment inquiry for what it is \u2013 a baseless and venomous political attack.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThis reminds me of the hit job Hillary Clinton and the Democrats hired ex-British spy Christopher Steele to carry out in 2016 by producing a dossier filled with lies about Trump.\n\nThis latest attempt to frame the president will fail as well, and justice will ultimately prevail. History will judge the ceaseless and baseless Democratic attacks on President Trump in the same way it judges the Salem witch trials that began in Massachusetts in 1692 \u2013 a grave injustice that should never have taken place.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY DAVID BOSSIE", "description": "Dozens of Republican House members were correct to courageously protest and fight back Wednesday against House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff\u2019s blatantly partisan and absurdly fact-free impeachment witch hunt of President Trump.", "authors": ["David Bossie", "David N.
