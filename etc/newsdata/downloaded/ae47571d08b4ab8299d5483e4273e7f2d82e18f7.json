Then again and again,\u201d Gale wrote. \u201cHopefully we will see him again tomorrow.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are animal lovers and since hearing about escaped panda we were very concerned so we set up a camera and placed some chopped up bamboo in front of the camera,\u201d Gale told 3FM. \u201cWithin 12 hours we had the footage of the panda. We have been out daily looking around to see if we can spot him and we are so happy that we have found him safe.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe contacted the park straight away and they came over to look where we spotted him,\u201d he said.\n\nPark officials said the search for the panda is ongoing.", "description": "Oct. 22 (UPI) \u2014 A red panda that escaped from a British zoo has been located by a local resident who set up an outdoor camera and placed some bamboo", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
