postmarked from the US Department of Commerce, US Census Bureau, rather than political groups, and never ask for money.\n\n\u201cMontanans need accurate information about the Census to make sure we have a complete count of the folks who live here,\u201d Lieutenant Governor Mike Cooney, a Democratic candidate for governor, said in the release, which was first reported by the Bozeman Daily Chronicle.\n\n\u201cA complete count means the state will get its fair share of federal funding. The official Census is easy to complete, secure, and does not cost money. An accurate and complete Census count for Montana is too important to take lightly.\u201d\n\nThe Republican National Committee did not respond to request for comment.\n\nEmilie Ritter Saunders, a spokesperson for the Montana Department of Commerce, said the forms first popped up this spring, prompting her office\u2019s first response of the year.\n\nSome residents reached out to ensure the department was aware of the impostor surveys, while others were confused as to what they were receiving.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Our job is to make sure Montanans have accurate info about the census,\u201d Ms Ritter Saunders said.\n\nThe \u201cimitation surveys\u201d are cause for concern among state officials tasked with ensuring a complete count in the state: Montana has roughly $2bn (\u00a31.6bn) in federal dollars on the line for everything from highway construction to food programmes, Ms Ritter Saunders said.\n\n\u201cThat funding is critical for a state like Montana that has a relatively small population,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cEstimates show that Montana is also on the cusp of receiving another congressional representative.\u201d\n\nSeats in the US House of Representatives are reapportioned every 10 years based on a state\u2019s growing or declining population.\n\nMs Ritter Saunders said the RNC has sent out lookalike Census forms in at least one prior census.\n\nIn 2010, people \u2013 including the Democratic governor of Montana and a Democratic representative in Georgia \u2013 reported getting such a survey, according to ProPublica.\n\nPhony Census mailers are enough of a concern that Congress in 2010 passed the Prevent Deceptive Census Lookalike Mailings Act.\n\nThe Montana mailers include a letter signed by RNC chair Ronna McDaniel, which says Mr Trump has requested a \u201cCensus of every congressional district be completed immediately to help ensure re-election\u201d.\n\nIt says the information is needed to create voter profiles and \u201ctarget audiences with the truth concerning President Trump\u2019s agenda\u201d.\n\n\u201cIf the Democrats win this battle,\u201d the letter says, \u201cit will prove disastrous for America\u2019s future.\u201d\n\nThe survey itself includes questions such as:\n\n\u201cHow confident are you that America\u2019s economy will continue to improve in the next 12 months?\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you support President Trump in his determination to appoint judges who will adhere to strict constitutional principles and not use the court to advance their personal ideologies?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Democrats\u2019 fixation on \u2018climate change\u2019 has led to costly regulations that are negatively affecting our nation\u2019s economy across-the-board. Do you think climate change is a major threat to our nation?\u201d\n\nTerri Ann Lowenthal, a census expert who served as former staff director of the House census oversight subcommittee in the 1980s, condemned the mailers.\n\n\u201cNo organisation, whether it\u2019s political or a private business, should be using the word \u2018census\u2019 in any of its mailings from now until the 2020 census is complete,\u201d Ms Lowenthal told The Washington Post.\n\n\u201cThey are trying to attract attention and are doing so at the expense of public confidence in a constitutionally required civic activity.\u201d\n\nMailings that mimic the real census have been a problem since at least the 1990s. Congress has passed at least two laws since then \u2013 most recently the Prevent Deceptive Census Lookalike Mailings Act in 2010 \u2013 aimed at curbing mail that impersonates a federal agency.\n\nMs Lowenthal said it is difficult to judge whether the mailers from Montana run afoul of any laws without first seeing the envelope they were sent in to determine if the material gives the impression it is an official government mailing.\n\nAs ProPublica reported, the misleading census forms from 2010 did not violate any laws.\n\n\u201cIn this case, using the word Census, even with a capital \u201cC\u201d does not equate to impersonation of the US Census Bureau,\u201d it reported at the time.\n\nThe Washington Post", "description": "Officials in Montana are warning residents for a second time this year about surveys sent by the Republican National Committee that mimic the look of federal census forms with the goal of soliciting money for Donald Trump\u2018s re-election campaign.", "authors": ["Kim Bellware", "Brittany Shammas"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/01/11/2020-census.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
