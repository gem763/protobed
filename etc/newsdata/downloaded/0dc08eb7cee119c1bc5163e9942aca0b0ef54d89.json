Intellectual property rights and incentives are a big factor, and some want the EU to play an even bigger role. A key piece of unfinished business from the outgoing European Commission is an effort to get EU countries to cooperate on so-called health technology assessment (HTA), the process by which policymakers decide how much money public health systems should pay for a new drug or treatment. Here are five key players to watch as policymakers restart the debate over the cost of cures.\n\nStella Kyriakides, commissioner-designate for Health\n\nA breast cancer survivor and medical psychologist, Stella Kyriakides developed something of a \u201cMother Theresa\u201d reputation in the Cypriot parliament, using a non-ideological style to win fans in both her center-right party and in the opposition. She\u2019ll need that political finesse to polish off a complicated bit of leftovers: The Commission\u2019s proposal for EU-level cooperation on HTA.\n\nHTA refers to the process countries use to evaluate how much a new medicine is worth: How well it works; how many people might need it; and what other treatments might no longer be needed. DG SANTE wants countries to work together on the \u201chow well it works\u201d part, known as a clinical assessment. But critics of Kyriakides\u2019 predecessor, Vytenis Andriukaitis, say he pushed too aggressively for a proposed requirement that countries only use the EU-level scientific assessment. Now the Council is at an impasse, with a powerful block of countries saying they\u2019ll only accept a voluntary proposal.\n\nJens Spahn, federal minister of health, Germany\n\nThe fate of EU-level HTA is in Jens Spahn's hands.\n\nGermany leads a block of countries opposed to the Commission\u2019s proposal. In a letter last year, they insisted that they\u2019re not against working together to evaluate how well new medicines work, in principle. But they stressed that requiring capitals to rely only on this crowd-sourced scientific assessment takes things too far. Backers of the plan, for their part, contend that there\u2019s no point in teaming up if every country goes its own way.\n\nSpahn likely knows that the HTA file is bigger than just HTA. EU countries are already working together voluntarily on assessments on an experimental basis, and there\u2019s a distinct fear in Brussels that if the HTA legislation withers, it\u2019ll be the death knell for any significant pan-European work on health. Spahn will have a chance to play the hero if he brokers a compromise when Germany takes over the Council presidency in the second half of 2020.\n\nThen again, he might already be gone at that point. An intra-party rival of Chancellor Angela Merkel, Spahn is champing at the bit for his next gig. Over just the past year, he\u2019s thrown his hat in the ring to be both Christian Democratic Union leader and defense minister.\n\nTiemo W\u00f6lken, MEP, Socialists and Democrats, Germany\n\nW\u00f6lken is taking over the HTA file in Parliament, making him the top German counterpoint to Berlin\u2019s opposition to EU-level cooperation. His frequent YouTube dispatches on subjects ranging from the burning Amazon rainforests to copyright reform earn tens of thousands of views, and he cites digitization and sustainability as his top priorities. But W\u00f6lken is quickly becoming one of the Parliament\u2019s most influential players on drug pricing policy. At the end of the last Parliament, for example, he overcame objections from the lead rapporteur \u2014 and Big Pharma \u2014 to allow generic drugmakers to stockpile medicines that are still under patent extension \u2014 a provision that could help get cheaper copycats onto the EU market faster.\n\nA lawyer by training, W\u00f6lken is starting his first full term in the Parliament after replacing another MEP in 2016. On HTA, however, his maneuvers in Berlin may be more important than those in Brussels: He\u2019ll be working to persuade his Social Democratic counterparts in the Bundestag to drop their objections to the EU measure.\n\nBruno Bruins, minister for medical care, The Netherlands\n\nWhile Brussels wrangles over how to regulate cooperation, capitals that want work to together are taking matters into their own hands. Bruins is at the forefront of these efforts, spearheading a new transatlantic collaboration to knock down drug prices, taking the fight to Big Pharma in the court of public opinion.\n\nIn October, Bruins plans to formally launch the International Horizon Scanning Initiative with Canada and a few other EU countries. \u201cHorizon scanning\u201d allows health systems to start planning early on how to pay for possibly pricey innovations that have yet to come to market. That, Bruins notes, allows negotiations between governments and drugmakers to start at an earlier stage, to avoid \u201cinexplicably high prices.\u201d\n\nBruins is also putting the drug pricing fight into the headlines. In August, he threatened to name and shame a specific company that increased its prices \u20ac150,000 per patient per year, if they don\u2019t either explain the hike or roll it back. \u201cThe value of a human life is infinite, but the health care budget is not,\u201d Bruins said.\n\nMeindert Boysen, director of the Centre for Health Technology Evaluation, U.K. National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)\n\nThink the U.K. won\u2019t affect EU drug prices after Brexit? Think again. Deal or no deal, England\u2019s NICE is likely to remain one of the most influential drugs gatekeepers in the world and one of the first stops for companies when they roll out new treatments \u2014 and Boysen is the man in charge of overhauling the agency\u2019s HTA process.\n\nBoysen used to work for the Pharma giant Eli Lilly, but he\u2019s been with NICE since 2004, and took the helm of its HTA division in April 2018. Over the next few months, Boysen\u2019s team will wrap up a review of new ways to quantify the value of medicines, such as whether a patient can return to work. His team will also need to navigate how to provide access to the first tumor agnostic drugs and single-use, highly expensive potential cures for inherited diseases. Expect their decisions to reverberate across the Channel.\n\nHelen Collis contributed reporting.\n\nThis article is advertiser-supported editorial content.
