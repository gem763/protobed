He played surveillance video he said showed a drone coming in from the north.\n\n\"This is the kind of weapon the Iranian regime and the Iranian IRGC are using against the civilian ... facilities,\" he said, using an acronym for Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard Corps.\n\nHowever, al-Malki did not directly blame Iran for the attack when asked by journalists. He said once \"the culprits\" were definitively identified they would \"be held accountable\".\n\n'A warning'\n\nIran has denied involvement and warned the United States it would retaliate \"immediately\" if targeted over the attacks.\n\nSaudi Arabia proved \"it knows nothing\", an adviser to Iran's President Hassan Rouhani said, after al-Malki's presentation.\n\n\"The press conference proved that Saudi Arabia knows nothing about where the missiles and drones were made or launched from, and failed to explain why the country's defence system failed to intercept them,\" Hesameddin Ashena wrote on Twitter.\n\nAl Jazeera's Assed Baig said that Iran has already warned the US - via the Swiss embassy - that there would be an immediate response if Washington does attack Tehran.\n\n\"Iran has said that if there is an attack, they won't just target the source of the attack,\" Baig said, speaking from Tehran. \"Now that's an indication that Iran is prepared to target US bases around the Middle East.\"\n\n\"This is also a throw to the countries in the region that have relations with US but also with Iran to say to them, maybe you should get involved and talk to the US and cool the situation down,\" Baig continued.\n\n\"It puts those countries in the Middle East that may host US bases or assets but also have relations with Iran in a very difficult position, because essentially they also may become targets if a conflict breaks out.\"\n\nTehran has stuck with its account that the Houthi rebels were responsible, with Rouhani saying on Wednesday they carried out the attack as a \"warning\" about a possible wider war in response to the Saudi-led intervention in Yemen.\n\nBut al-Malki said: \"Despite Iran's efforts to make it appear so\", the attack did not originate from Yemen, it was beyond the capabilities of the Houthi militia - who have, however, mounted dozens of smaller attacks on Saudi territory.\n\nJournalists film what Saudi Arabia says is evidence of Iranian weaponry used in the attack [Amr Nabil/AP]\n\nAndreas Krieg, a lecturer at King's College London, told Al Jazeera the Saudi news conference was an attempt to explain some of the unanswered questions surrounding the attack.\n\n\"Questions have been asked as to how it was possible for all these strikes to be pinpoint accurate and hit the targets as they did, considering Saudi Arabia has obvious air defence umbrellas in place. One explanation is they were watching out for missiles and incoming fire from the south and not the north,\" said Krieg.\n\nKrieg called the news conference \"a battle of the narratives\".\n\n\"The Saudis are trying to make a case and trying to get sympathy from the international community,\" he said. \"Most importantly, they are speaking out to Washington knowing fully well that the Trump administration does not want to get sucked into a military confrontation in the area.\"\n\n190819143901514\n\nHouthis respond\n\nAt a press conference about 30 minutes after the Saudis', the Houthi rebels threatened to hit major cities in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) - the Saudis' main coalition partner in the war in Yemen.\n\n\"We announce ... we have dozens of targets in the UAE - among them Abu Dhabi and Dubai - and they can be targeted at any moment,\" said Yehia Sarea, a Houthi military spokesman.\n\n\"If you want peace and security for your facilities, and towers made of glass that cannot withstand one drone, then leave Yemen alone.\"\n\nHe also refuted that the rebels were not responsible for launching the strikes from inside Yemen.\n\n\"This operation was an example of how our military plans, develops and executes operations deep inside the aggressors' countries,\" Sarea said.\n\nHe showed satellite images of the stricken Saudi facility and said the damage done was much more extensive than what the Saudis and Americans have claimed.\n\nThe drones deployed were indeed capable of flying 700km and \"very accurate\" in launching precision strikes, he added.\n\n\"The fires burned for 12 hours and the aggressors couldn't control them. The destruction is much bigger,\" Sarea said.\n\n'Locked and loaded'\n\n190916092330241\n\nOn Saturday, the attack struck the world's biggest oil processing facility in Saudi Arabia, as well as an oil field, taking out about six percent of global oil supplies.\n\nCrown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler, said the strike on the heart of the kingdom's oil industry was a \"real test\" of global will.\n\nThe US has said its military was \"locked and loaded\", suggesting it may retaliate against the perpetrators of the attacks on its closest Middle Eastern ally.\n\nUS Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met the crown prince in Saudi Arabia on Wednesday.\n\nThe Saudi news conference came after Iran warned the US it will retaliate \"immediately\" if Tehran is targeted, its state-run news agency reported, further raising Gulf tensions.\n\nIran sent a message through Swiss diplomats in Tehran on Monday, reiterating that Tehran denies being involved in the Saudi attack, IRNA reported. The Swiss have looked after American interests in Tehran for decades.\n\n\"If any action takes place against Iran, the action will be faced by Iran's answer immediately,\" IRNA quoted the message as saying. It added Iran's response would not be limited to the source of the threat, suggesting it would inflict damage beyond what it had suffered.\n\n'Learn the lesson'\n\nIn Tehran, Rouhani told his cabinet Saudi Arabia should view the attacks as a sign to end its devastating war in Yemen, where it has fought the Houthi rebels since 2015 and sought to restore the internationally recognised government.\n\nRouhani said Yemenis \"did not hit hospitals, they did not hit schools or the Sanaa bazaar,\" referring to the Saudi-led coalition's widely criticised air raids on civilian targets.\n\nTens of thousands of Yemenis have died in the disastrous war, which the United Nations has described as the world's worst humanitarian situation.\n\nRouhani said Iran does not want conflict in the region, but it was the Saudi-led coalition that \"waged the war in the region and ruined Yemen\".\n\nReiterating that the Houthis were responsible for Saturday's strike, he said: \"They attacked an industrial centre to warn you. Learn the lesson from the warning.\"", "description": "Defence ministry says no way attacks were launched from Yemen but Houthi rebels boast drones can easily fly 700km.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/9/19/7e6491f7f78d4c3eaf9b1a62b3d89bea_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
