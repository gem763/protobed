China is one of Pakistan's top allies.\n\n\"India and China have a fraught relationship, yet they are also far from being each other's top foreign policy issue,\" said Simon Baptist, global chief economist and managing director at the Economist Intelligence Unit.\n\nIn August, India revoked the special status granted to the territory of Jammu and Kashmir \u2014 a move that angered Pakistan which has fought three wars with India since 1947 over the disputed territory.\n\nAhead of their meeting, Xi said on Wednesday he was watching the situation in Jammu and Kashmir and will support Pakistan in issues related to its core interests, China's state news agency Xinhua reported.\n\nBut Modi will most likely want to reiterate to Xi that the Kashmir issue is an internal matter for India, said Rudra Chaudhuri, director of think tank Carnegie India in a note on Thursday.", "description": "The leaders of India and China are expected to talk about their unsettled border dispute when they meet, and may also address their differences over Kashmir.", "authors": ["Grace Shao Stella Soon", "Grace Shao", "Stella Soon"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106175798-1570759794809gettyimages-842387182.jpeg?v=1570759904", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
