Two-year Treasury yields dropped another 7 basis points.\n\n- On Thursday, a gauge of employment in US services industries swung into contraction for the first time since 2010, after the biggest two-month drop in a decade. Two-year Treasury yields tumbled 9 basis points.\n\nFor those keeping track at home, that's a 23-basis-point swing in three days, to the lowest levels since 2017.\n\nThe Treasury market has seen similar moves twice this year: in August, after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates and President Donald Trump ratcheted up the US-China trade war less than 24 hours later, and in June, when traders freaked out about Trump's threat to impose tariffs on all Mexican goods over illegal immigration.\n\nWhat do both of those have in common? The Fed lowered its benchmark lending rate during the following month.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSimply put, bond traders made up their minds that regardless of what Friday's jobs data showed, the central bank would have no choice but to cut interest rates this month, even though their median projection from last month was for no further reductions through 2020.\n\nAfter all, Fed chairman Jerome Powell has said time and again that his overarching goal is to act as appropriate to sustain the economic expansion. And the data this week flashed clear warnings of a potential slowdown.\n\nMoreover, once the bond market becomes so sure of an impending Fed action, the central bank rarely makes an effort to dissuade traders.\n\nIn early July, I questioned whether anything could delay a rate cut later that month, given the market's certainty that it would happen. A week later, Powell cemented those expectations in prepared remarks to US lawmakers, even though data steadily beat estimates over the course of the month. Effectively, the data-dependent central bank officials cherry-picked their figures.\n\nThere's no question that this past week was a sharp reminder that the US economy is in a somewhat tenuous position after the longest economic recovery on record. Citigroup's economic surprise index is poised for its biggest weekly drop since early June.\n\nWhat Fed officials have to ask themselves is whether further interest-rate cuts will make a difference for the country's economic trajectory. On the one hand, the fed funds rate is the central bank's one main policy tool, and if the economy is screaming out for help, then officials' natural reaction should be to lower it. And yet, it's not as if the cost of capital is what's holding American businesses back from investing or hiring.\n\nDebating about the \"right\" thing for the Fed to do is ultimately an academic exercise. Ascertaining what the Fed \"will\" do is what traders are paid to do. And they made up their minds well before waking up on jobs day.\n\nWashington Post", "description": "September's US payrolls report never had a chance at truly mattering to the bond market, writes Brian Chappatta.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/2dd6e5fec0ab8be8c34250e9472524c272e182c6", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
