Peter Andre's daughter Princess couldn't hide her disappointment after he played a hilarious prank on her\n\nPlayful: The presenter - who is no stranger to sharing posts of his children on social media - posted a clip of the prank on Instagram (pictured above in July 2019)\n\nIn the video, Princess can't contain her excitement as she shows off the sealed Apple box, gushing about the gift from her father.\n\nThe schoolgirl squeals: 'Oh my God, thank you, I am so happy you got me Airpods! I am so happy, thank you so much.'\n\nAs she opens the box, Princess continues to say 'Oh my God in excitement,' but her expression quickly changes when she realises the box is empty.\n\nShe holds up the empty package to camera before saying: 'Dad! That is not funny!'\n\nGiddy: Princess started the video with delight as she thought that Peter had given her a pair of Apple AirPods\n\nNaughty: Peter feigned involvement in the joke as he posted the video with a funny caption\n\nLuckily Peter seemed to find the funny side in the prank, posting the video with the caption: 'These are the kind of random things my kids send me. She does make me laugh. #airpodsnoairpods #gotcha.'\n\nPeter shares son Junior, 14, and Princess with his ex-wife Katie Price, and is also the proud father to Amelia, five, and Theodore, two, with wife Emily MacDonagh.\n\nIn light of Little Mix singer Jesy Nelson's documentary about the impact online trolling can have on people in the public eye, Peter shared his experiences with New Magazine and fears for his children.\n\nI can't wait! Princess rushed to open the package to see the headphones inside, but did not get the result she was hoping for\n\nAnnoyed: She then revealed that the box was empty, and she appeared unimpressed with her father's prank\n\nPeter recalled: 'One of my worst experiences of trolling was around the time Twitter first became a thing, I even had to appear in court to give evidence against someone whose trolling made me physically sick.\n\n'It seriously affected me and I don't think anyone will understand how that made me feel, it took a lot of courage after that to block people who said nasty things about situations they knew nothing about.'\n\nOn having children in the public eye, the singer continued: 'I do worry about my kids being targeted online and receiving harsher trolling than other kids because they're recognised, if you're a parent in the public eye you could bring out a song that's terrible or star in a TV show that gets laughed at but it's your kids who the trolls have a go at.'", "description": "The presenter, 46, led his daughter, 12, to believe that he had bought her a pair of Apple  headphones, but she was disappointed to find that the white box was empty in the video posted to Instagram.", "authors": ["Laura Fox For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/14/19839640-0-image-a-79_1571319713987.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
