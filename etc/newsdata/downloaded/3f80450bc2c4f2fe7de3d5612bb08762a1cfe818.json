No stirrer. No glass. We\u2019re redefining how whisky can be enjoyed,\u201d the venerable Scottish distillery said.\n\nNo ice. No stirrer. No glass. We're redefining how whisky can be enjoyed. Introducing The Glenlivet Capsule Collection #noglassrequired pic.twitter.com/F4MGErsfZM \u2014 The Glenlivet (@TheGlenlivet) October 2, 2019\n\nThe booze-filled capsules, roughly the size and shape of Tide Pods (which, again, you absolutely positively should not eat, no matter what that kid on the playground says), are made from seaweed extract and \u201care popped in the mouth for an instant burst of flavour, and the capsule is simply swallowed,\u201d the company said in a statement.\n\nEach capsule contains 23 milliliters (almost an ounce) of whisky cocktail in one of three flavors, described only as citrus, wood and spice.\n\n\u201cOur founder, George Smith, always went against the grain, bucking tradition and doing things differently,\u201d said Glenlivet, a unit of French beverage giant Pernod-Ricard SA RI, +1.56% . \u201cThe Glenlivet Capsule Collection continues his pioneering spirit today.\u201d\n\nSmith, who died in 1871, did not immediately comment from the grave as to whether he was rolling over or not.\n\nSome whisky fans, however, were apoplectic.\n\nSurely this is a sick joke. Glenlivet is not a tide pod. This is an abomination. What is going on.

In particular, you are cheapening Glenlivet. Scotch is meant to be sipped, it\u2019s complex flavors enjoyed in micro sips. As soon as you treat it like tequila or cheap hooch, your brand is dead.\n\n\n\nEND THIS CAMPAIGN NOW! \u2014 John (@DrJohnDLove) October 5, 2019\n\nSome evil genius marketer produced advertisement that just destroyed the carefully cultivated mystique of The Glenlivet brand.\n\n\n\nThink Goizueta\u2019s New Coke disaster times 100. \u2014 David Cay Johnston (@DavidCayJ) October 5, 2019\n\nNobody:\n\n\n\nAbsolutely nobody:\n\n\n\nNot even some mythical millennial \u201cexperience seeker\u201d demographic invented by vapid marketers:\n\n\n\nGlenlivet: \u201chere\u2019s our Whisky is a mouth-soluble condom\u201d pic.twitter.com/IO7d7PoKO9 \u2014 Joe Fattorini (@joefattorini) October 5, 2019\n\nAnd the conversation inevitably ended up here, because why wouldn\u2019t it?\n\nPeople are totally going to put these up their butts. https://t.co/8bc433QIDn \u2014 Erin Boudreau (@Erin_Boudreau) October 5, 2019\n\nOther critics pointed out that the capsules don\u2019t let imbibers add a bit of water, which enhances whisky\u2019s flavor; that most people enjoy sipping a fine Scotch whisky rather than chugging it; and that the portability of the capsules could be negated by the need to carry it in a hard container so they don\u2019t burst in one\u2019s pocket.\n\nPositive online comments were few and far between, though one offered that the capsules could be good for astronauts who want to get drunk in space, though that would likely be frowned upon by NASA.\n\nThe capsules will be served at Tay\u0113r + Elementary, a London bar whose owner/bartenders collaborated with Glenlivet to create the cocktails, through Oct. 13. They\u2019re not yet available in the U.S., and it is unclear if they\u2019ll ever hit store shelves, or are a one-time concoction aimed at trolling for outrage (cough cough and publicity) on the internet.\n\nAnd if the latter is the case, here\u2019s to you, Glenlivet.
