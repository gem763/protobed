Peaceful demonstration earlier this week were broken up with water cannon, while video footage circulating on social media showed demonstrators being shot with rubber bullets at close range, or being physically attacked by police.\n\n191023215017374\n\nThe INDH said it had compiled 67 legal cases related to five homicides, and 12 alleged instances of sexual violence by police and military personnel, including being forced to undress, threats of rape, and physical harassment.\n\nA special prosecutor has been appointed to investigate alleged human rights violations in 13 districts of Santiago.\n\nThe Inter-American Human Rights Commission (IACHR) has also said it will convene on 11 November in Ecuador to assess the alleged abuses.\n\nThe commission's vice president described the situation as \"critical\".\n\n\"We are very concerned for the situation going on,\" IACHR Commissioner Joel Hernandez said. \"The response by the state should only be under strict international standards, under the principles of proportionality and restraint. We are observing ... an excessive use of force.\"\n\nTeodoro Ribera, the minister for foreign affairs, confirmed on Thursday that the president had invited the UN commission to investigate the situation in Chile.\n\n\"We are interested in maximum transparency and that all necessary safeguards are taken,\" he said.\n\nVehicles are seen driving past a demonstration against toll charges in a roadway on the outskirts of Santiago, Chile [Pablo Sanhueza/Reuters]\n\nNo end in sight\n\nPresident Sebastian Pinera, who has declared a state of emergency over the protests, tried to appease demonstrators earlier in the week by apologising for his \"lack of vision\" and announcing a package of reforms. His proposals include increasing the basic pension by 20 percent, and introducing a minimum wage of 350,000 pesos ($482). He also pledged a tax rise on high earners and a reversal of a recent 9.2 percent hike in electricity bills.\n\nBut the president's words have fallen flat in Chile's capital, with many protesters saying the measures do not go far enough for a crisis this severe.\n\nSixteen cities have been put under military-enforced curfew at night. Graffiti and posters on the walls of Santiago called for the president to resign.\n\nThere appears to be no sign that the unrest will end soon. Truckers staged a strike on Friday over private highway tolls. Protesters are also scheduled to rally in the capital on Friday afternoon in what is expected to be the biggest demonstration to date.\n\n\"The repression we're living won't pass until he gets military off the street. Many people are very scared, but the worst of all the fear I have isn't as bad as the psychological fear of my parents and grandparents who lived through the dictatorship,\" said Camila Dilas, a 27-year-old marching on Santiago's streets, referring to the 17-year dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet, which ended in 1990.\n\n\"I want this inequality to end. Finally, we've woken up and I feel happy that Chile has opened its eyes. These protests will last until Pinera resigns.\"", "description": "UN says it'll probe rights abuse claims as protesters angry over inequality set to rally in biggest demonstrations yet.", "authors": ["Naomi Larsson"], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/25/7969a885a52d425aa2d476bfd0ef930d_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
