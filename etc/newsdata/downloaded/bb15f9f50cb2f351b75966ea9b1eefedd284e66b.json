Predicted England team vs Argentina 1/24 England vs Argentina Who should England team boss Eddie Jones select in his team to face Argentina? We make our selection based on all the latest news during the week. Getty Images 2/24 1. Mako Vunipola If he\u2019s fully fit like we\u2019ve been told, Vunipola could be thrown straight back into the mix. He has all the experience required to deal with such an occasion, and by having his presence from the start, you allow the injection of power and pace off the bench from Ellis Genge. Getty Images 3/24 2. Jamie George He will be crucial to England\u2019s hopes of getting the forward-dominance required at the set-piece, with his lineout and scrummaging skills currently unrivalled in this England squad. PA 4/24 3. Kyle Sinckler Revealed this week that he knew Eddie Jones would not select him to start until he improved his scrummaging to test-level. With Sinckler now promoted to No 1 in the No 3 shirt, there should be no concerns about going up against the Pumas pack. Getty Images 5/24 4. Maro Itoje Itoje was brilliant in the opening outing against Tonga as he dominated the lineout, and after being fully rested against the USA, he slots straight back into the side. Getty Images 6/24 5. Courtney Lawes Lawes appears to have gained a march on George Kruis in the second-row pecking order. AFP/Getty Images 7/24 6. Tom Curry The decision to deploy two openside flankers in the back-row appears to be paying off for Eddie Jones with both Curry and Underhill in good form. Curry may not be as prominent at the breakdown as he is when at seven, but he\u2019s still very early in learning his role on the blindside. EPA 8/24 7. Sam Underhill Underhill looks set to return to the starting XV in the No 7 shirt after sitting out the USA game. AFP/Getty Images 9/24 8. Billy Vunipola A 12th consecutive start beckons for Vunipola to provide the bulk of England\u2019s ball-carrying in an area where they cannot afford to come off second best. Getty Images 10/24 9. Ben Youngs Youngs still appears to be ahead in scrum-half pecking order, though Willi Heinz is giving Eddie Jones plenty to think about. With wet weather expected, Youngs will need to be at his tactical best. Getty Images 11/24 10. George Ford Looks to have emerged as Jones\u2019s first-choice fly-half, at least when the team is expected to be in the front foot. Showed impressive leadership against the USA and his partnership with Owen Farrell is proving key to release the outside backs. Getty Images 12/24 11. Jonny May May is yet to score a try at this World Cup, though twice turned provider against Tonga before being rested against the USA. That said, May is a man who desires to score them himself, and he\u2019ll want to see his name on the scoresheet sooner rather than later. AFP/Getty Images 13/24 12. Owen Farrell Farrell is a certainty on the teamsheet, the question is whether he wears 10 or 12. Jones is likely to stick with the Ford-Farrell axis, and we concur with Farrell filling the inside centre role. Getty Images 14/24 13. Manu Tuilagi After a necessary breather against the USA, Tuilagi returns to the line-up at outside centre in order to maximise the length of time he gets on the ball, giving him a chance to get a head of steam up and deliver another star showing like he produced against Tonga. REUTERS 15/24 14. Anthony Watson Is quietly going about doing his business very well, and looks to be settling on the wing that allows him to make the most of his attacking skills. EPA 16/24 15. Elliot Daly Finds himself under pressure somewhat, though he does at least seem to be Eddie Jones\u2019s first-choice for the foreseeable future in the No 15 shirt. Daly does offer England a third playmaking option, and also possesses the rocket-left boot that keeps team honest around halfway. AFP/Getty Images 17/24 <b>Replacements:</b> 16. Luke Cowan-Dickie Has been one of the stars of the World Cup going under the radar, with tries in both of England\u2019s games so far. Getty Images 18/24 17. Ellis Genge Beats Joe Marler to a place on the bench for the sheer explosiveness that he can offer, as we saw against the US. Can also be relied upon for a long shift if Vunipola isn\u2019t quite up to it. Getty Images 19/24 18. Dan Cole If Genge is youthful aggression, Cole offers experienced prowess in the scrum and the ability to grind down games and keep a calm head as they tick towards the crunch. AFP/Getty Images 20/24 19. George Kruis Kruis is another who will be a huge asset to send on in an attempt to close out the games, with his skills in the lineout and carrying a welcome boost in the closing stages. AFP/Getty Images 21/24 20. Lewis Ludlam Emerging as one of Eddie Jones\u2019s great finds, having starred in the victory over the USA and making a strong cameo appearance against Tonga. EPA 22/24 21. Willi Heinz Could force his way into Jones\u2019s starting XV thanks to his accurate kicking, which will be crucial in the Tokyo rain, but if we\u2019re going to select the current strongest XV Heinz has to make do with a place on the bench. Getty Images 23/24 22. Henry Slade The plan will have been for Slade to have seen a lot more action this World Cup than the 27 minutes he\u2019s seen, but with Ford and Farrell in the starting XV and Slade able to cover both centre and full-back, his presence on the bench is welcome. Getty Images 24/24 23. Joe Cokanasiga Just beats Jack Nowell to a place because of his two-try salvo last Thursday, but will need show a more clinical side to his game to keep Nowell out long-term after wasting a few chances.
