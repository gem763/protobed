She answered her phone\u2014she\u2019s had an iPhone since she was 11\u2014sounding as if she\u2019d just woken up. We chatted about her favorite songs and TV shows, and I asked her what she likes to do with her friends. \u201cWe go to the mall,\u201d she said. \u201cDo your parents drop you off?,\u201d I asked, recalling my own middle-school days, in the 1980s, when I\u2019d enjoy a few parent-free hours shopping with my friends. \u201cNo\u2014I go with my family,\u201d she replied. \u201cWe\u2019ll go with my mom and brothers and walk a little behind them. I just have to tell my mom where we\u2019re going. I have to check in every hour or every 30 minutes.\u201d Those mall trips are infrequent\u2014about once a month. More often, Athena and her friends spend time together on their phones, unchaperoned. Unlike the teens of my generation, who might have spent an evening tying up the family landline with gossip, they talk on Snapchat, the smartphone app that allows users to send pictures and videos that quickly disappear. They make sure to keep up their Snapstreaks, which show how many days in a row they have Snapchatted with each other. Sometimes they save screenshots of particularly ridiculous pictures of friends. \u201cIt\u2019s good blackmail,\u201d Athena said. (Because she\u2019s a minor, I\u2019m not using her real name.) She told me she\u2019d spent most of the summer hanging out alone in her room with her phone. That\u2019s just the way her generation is, she said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have a choice to know any life without iPads or iPhones. I think we like our phones more than we like actual people.\u201d Related Story Your Smartphone Reduces Your Brainpower, Even If It's Just Sitting There I\u2019ve been researching generational differences for 25 years, starting when I was a 22-year-old doctoral student in psychology. Typically, the characteristics that come to define a generation appear gradually, and along a continuum. Beliefs and behaviors that were already rising simply continue to do so. Millennials, for instance, are a highly individualistic generation, but individualism had been increasing since the Baby Boomers turned on, tuned in, and dropped out. I had grown accustomed to line graphs of trends that looked like modest hills and valleys. Then I began studying Athena\u2019s generation. Around 2012, I noticed abrupt shifts in teen behaviors and emotional states. The gentle slopes of the line graphs became steep mountains and sheer cliffs, and many of the distinctive characteristics of the Millennial generation began to disappear. In all my analyses of generational data\u2014some reaching back to the 1930s\u2014I had never seen anything like it. The allure of independence, so powerful to previous generations, holds less sway over today\u2019s teens. At first I presumed these might be blips, but the trends persisted, across several years and a series of national surveys. The changes weren\u2019t just in degree, but in kind. The biggest difference between the Millennials and their predecessors was in how they viewed the world; teens today differ from the Millennials not just in their views but in how they spend their time. The experiences they have every day are radically different from those of the generation that came of age just a few years before them. What happened in 2012 to cause such dramatic shifts in behavior? It was after the Great Recession, which officially lasted from 2007 to 2009 and had a starker effect on Millennials trying to find a place in a sputtering economy. But it was exactly the moment when the proportion of Americans who owned a smartphone surpassed 50 percent.\n\nThe more I pored over yearly surveys of teen attitudes and behaviors, and the more I talked with young people like Athena, the clearer it became that theirs is a generation shaped by the smartphone and by the concomitant rise of social media. I call them iGen. Born between 1995 and 2012, members of this generation are growing up with smartphones, have an Instagram account before they start high school, and do not remember a time before the internet. The Millennials grew up with the web as well, but it wasn\u2019t ever-present in their lives, at hand at all times, day and night. iGen\u2019s oldest members were early adolescents when the iPhone was introduced, in 2007, and high-school students when the iPad entered the scene, in 2010. A 2017 survey of more than 5,000 American teens found that three out of four owned an iPhone. The advent of the smartphone and its cousin the tablet was followed quickly by hand-wringing about the deleterious effects of \u201cscreen time.\u201d But the impact of these devices has not been fully appreciated, and goes far beyond the usual concerns about curtailed attention spans. The arrival of the smartphone has radically changed every aspect of teenagers\u2019 lives, from the nature of their social interactions to their mental health. These changes have affected young people in every corner of the nation and in every type of household. The trends appear among teens poor and rich; of every ethnic background; in cities, suburbs, and small towns. Where there are cell towers, there are teens living their lives on their smartphone.\n\nTo those of us who fondly recall a more analog adolescence, this may seem foreign and troubling. The aim of generational study, however, is not to succumb to nostalgia for the way things used to be; it\u2019s to understand how they are now. Some generational changes are positive, some are negative, and many are both. More comfortable in their bedrooms than in a car or at a party, today\u2019s teens are physically safer than teens have ever been. They\u2019re markedly less likely to get into a car accident and, having less of a taste for alcohol than their predecessors, are less susceptible to drinking\u2019s attendant ills. Psychologically, however, they are more vulnerable than Millennials were: Rates of teen depression and suicide have skyrocketed since 2011. It\u2019s not an exaggeration to describe iGen as being on the brink of the worst mental-health crisis in decades. Much of this deterioration can be traced to their phones. Even when a seismic event\u2014a war, a technological leap, a free concert in the mud\u2014plays an outsize role in shaping a group of young people, no single factor ever defines a generation. Parenting styles continue to change, as do school curricula and culture, and these things matter. But the twin rise of the smartphone and social media has caused an earthquake of a magnitude we\u2019ve not seen in a very long time, if ever. There is compelling evidence that the devices we\u2019ve placed in young people\u2019s hands are having profound effects on their lives\u2014and making them seriously unhappy.\n\nIn the early 1970s, the photographer Bill Yates shot a series of portraits at the Sweetheart Roller Skating Rink in Tampa, Florida. In one, a shirtless teen stands with a large bottle of peppermint schnapps stuck in the waistband of his jeans. In another, a boy who looks no older than 12 poses with a cigarette in his mouth. The rink was a place where kids could get away from their parents and inhabit a world of their own, a world where they could drink, smoke, and make out in the backs of their cars. In stark black-and-white, the adolescent Boomers gaze at Yates\u2019s camera with the self-confidence born of making your own choices\u2014even if, perhaps especially if, your parents wouldn\u2019t think they were the right ones. Fifteen years later, during my own teenage years as a member of Generation X, smoking had lost some of its romance, but independence was definitely still in. My friends and I plotted to get our driver\u2019s license as soon as we could, making DMV appointments for the day we turned 16 and using our newfound freedom to escape the confines of our suburban neighborhood. Asked by our parents, \u201cWhen will you be home?,\u201d we replied, \u201cWhen do I have to be?\u201d But the allure of independence, so powerful to previous generations, holds less sway over today\u2019s teens, who are less likely to leave the house without their parents. The shift is stunning: 12th-graders in 2015 were going out less often than eighth-graders did as recently as 2009.\n\nToday\u2019s teens are also less likely to date. The initial stage of courtship, which Gen Xers called \u201cliking\u201d (as in \u201cOoh, he likes you!\u201d), kids now call \u201ctalking\u201d\u2014an ironic choice for a generation that prefers texting to actual conversation. After two teens have \u201ctalked\u201d for a while, they might start dating. But only about 56 percent of high-school seniors in 2015 went out on dates; for Boomers and Gen Xers, the number was about 85 percent. The decline in dating tracks with a decline in sexual activity. The drop is the sharpest for ninth-graders, among whom the number of sexually active teens has been cut by almost 40 percent since 1991. The average teen now has had sex for the first time by the spring of 11th grade, a full year later than the average Gen Xer. Fewer teens having sex has contributed to what many see as one of the most positive youth trends in recent years: The teen birth rate hit an all-time low in 2016, down 67 percent since its modern peak, in 1991. Even driving, a symbol of adolescent freedom inscribed in American popular culture, from Rebel Without a Cause to Ferris Bueller\u2019s Day Off, has lost its appeal for today\u2019s teens. Nearly all Boomer high-school students had their driver\u2019s license by the spring of their senior year; more than one in four teens today still lack one at the end of high school. For some, Mom and Dad are such good chauffeurs that there\u2019s no urgent need to drive. \u201cMy parents drove me everywhere and never complained, so I always had rides,\u201d a 21-year-old student in San Diego told me. \u201cI didn\u2019t get my license until my mom told me I had to because she could not keep driving me to school.\u201d She finally got her license six months after her 18th birthday. In conversation after conversation, teens described getting their license as something to be nagged into by their parents\u2014a notion that would have been unthinkable to previous generations.\n\nIndependence isn\u2019t free\u2014you need some money in your pocket to pay for gas, or for that bottle of schnapps. In earlier eras, kids worked in great numbers, eager to finance their freedom or prodded by their parents to learn the value of a dollar. But iGen teens aren\u2019t working (or managing their own money) as much. In the late 1970s, 77 percent of high-school seniors worked for pay during the school year; by the mid-2010s, only 55 percent did. The number of eighth-graders who work for pay has been cut in half. These declines accelerated during the Great Recession, but teen employment has not bounced back, even though job availability has. Of course, putting off the responsibilities of adulthood is not an iGen innovation. Gen Xers, in the 1990s, were the first to postpone the traditional markers of adulthood. Young Gen Xers were just about as likely to drive, drink alcohol, and date as young Boomers had been, and more likely to have sex and get pregnant as teens. But as they left their teenage years behind, Gen Xers married and started careers later than their Boomer predecessors had. Gen X managed to stretch adolescence beyond all previous limits: Its members started becoming adults earlier and finished becoming adults later. Beginning with Millennials and continuing with iGen, adolescence is contracting again\u2014but only because its onset is being delayed. Across a range of behaviors\u2014drinking, dating, spending time unsupervised\u2014 18-year-olds now act more like 15-year-olds used to, and 15-year-olds more like 13-year-olds. Childhood now stretches well into high school.\n\nWhy are today\u2019s teens waiting longer to take on both the responsibilities and the pleasures of adulthood? Shifts in the economy, and parenting, certainly play a role. In an information economy that rewards higher education more than early work history, parents may be inclined to encourage their kids to stay home and study rather than to get a part-time job. Teens, in turn, seem to be content with this homebody arrangement\u2014not because they\u2019re so studious, but because their social life is lived on their phone. They don\u2019t need to leave home to spend time with their friends. If today\u2019s teens were a generation of grinds, we\u2019d see that in the data. But eighth-, 10th-, and 12th-graders in the 2010s actually spend less time on homework than Gen X teens did in the early 1990s. (High-school seniors headed for four-year colleges spend about the same amount of time on homework as their predecessors did.) The time that seniors spend on activities such as student clubs and sports and exercise has changed little in recent years. Combined with the decline in working for pay, this means iGen teens have more leisure time than Gen X teens did, not less. So what are they doing with all that time? They are on their phone, in their room, alone and often distressed.\n\nJasu Hu\n\nOne of the ironies of iGen life is that despite spending far more time under the same roof as their parents, today\u2019s teens can hardly be said to be closer to their mothers and fathers than their predecessors were. \u201cI\u2019ve seen my friends with their families\u2014they don\u2019t talk to them,\u201d Athena told me. \u201cThey just say \u2018Okay, okay, whatever\u2019 while they\u2019re on their phones. They don\u2019t pay attention to their family.\u201d Like her peers, Athena is an expert at tuning out her parents so she can focus on her phone. She spent much of her summer keeping up with friends, but nearly all of it was over text or Snapchat. \u201cI\u2019ve been on my phone more than I\u2019ve been with actual people,\u201d she said. \u201cMy bed has, like, an imprint of my body.\u201d\n\nIn this, too, she is typical. The number of teens who get together with their friends nearly every day dropped by more than 40 percent from 2000 to 2015; the decline has been especially steep recently. It\u2019s not only a matter of fewer kids partying; fewer kids are spending time simply hanging out. That\u2019s something most teens used to do: nerds and jocks, poor kids and rich kids, C students and A students. The roller rink, the basketball court, the town pool, the local necking spot\u2014they\u2019ve all been replaced by virtual spaces accessed through apps and the web. You might expect that teens spend so much time in these new spaces because it makes them happy, but most data suggest that it does not. The Monitoring the Future survey, funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse and designed to be nationally representative, has asked 12th-graders more than 1,000 questions every year since 1975 and queried eighth- and 10th-graders since 1991. The survey asks teens how happy they are and also how much of their leisure time they spend on various activities, including nonscreen activities such as in-person social interaction and exercise, and, in recent years, screen activities such as using social media, texting, and browsing the web. The results could not be clearer: Teens who spend more time than average on screen activities are more likely to be unhappy, and those who spend more time than average on nonscreen activities are more likely to be happy.\n\nThere\u2019s not a single exception. All screen activities are linked to less happiness, and all nonscreen activities are linked to more happiness. Eighth-graders who spend 10 or more hours a week on social media are 56 percent more likely to say they\u2019re unhappy than those who devote less time to social media. Admittedly, 10 hours a week is a lot. But those who spend six to nine hours a week on social media are still 47 percent more likely to say they are unhappy than those who use social media even less. The opposite is true of in-person interactions. Those who spend an above-average amount of time with their friends in person are 20 percent less likely to say they\u2019re unhappy than those who hang out for a below-average amount of time. The more time teens spend looking at screens, the more likely they are to report symptoms of depression. If you were going to give advice for a happy adolescence based on this survey, it would be straightforward: Put down the phone, turn off the laptop, and do something\u2014anything\u2014that does not involve a screen. Of course, these analyses don\u2019t unequivocally prove that screen time causes unhappiness; it\u2019s possible that unhappy teens spend more time online. But recent research suggests that screen time, in particular social-media use, does indeed cause unhappiness. One study asked college students with a Facebook page to complete short surveys on their phone over the course of two weeks. They\u2019d get a text message with a link five times a day, and report on their mood and how much they\u2019d used Facebook. The more they\u2019d used Facebook, the unhappier they felt, but feeling unhappy did not subsequently lead to more Facebook use.\n\nSocial-networking sites like Facebook promise to connect us to friends. But the portrait of iGen teens emerging from the data is one of a lonely, dislocated generation. Teens who visit social-networking sites every day but see their friends in person less frequently are the most likely to agree with the statements \u201cA lot of times I feel lonely,\u201d \u201cI often feel left out of things,\u201d and \u201cI often wish I had more good friends.\u201d Teens\u2019 feelings of loneliness spiked in 2013 and have remained high since. This doesn\u2019t always mean that, on an individual level, kids who spend more time online are lonelier than kids who spend less time online. Teens who spend more time on social media also spend more time with their friends in person, on average\u2014highly social teens are more social in both venues, and less social teens are less so. But at the generational level, when teens spend more time on smartphones and less time on in-person social interactions, loneliness is more common. So is depression. Once again, the effect of screen activities is unmistakable: The more time teens spend looking at screens, the more likely they are to report symptoms of depression. Eighth-graders who are heavy users of social media increase their risk of depression by 27 percent, while those who play sports, go to religious services, or even do homework more than the average teen cut their risk significantly. Teens who spend three hours a day or more on electronic devices are 35 percent more likely to have a risk factor for suicide, such as making a suicide plan. (That\u2019s much more than the risk related to, say, watching TV.) One piece of data that indirectly but stunningly captures kids\u2019 growing isolation, for good and for bad: Since 2007, the homicide rate among teens has declined, but the suicide rate has increased. As teens have started spending less time together, they have become less likely to kill one another, and more likely to kill themselves. In 2011, for the first time in 24 years, the teen suicide rate was higher than the teen homicide rate.\n\nDepression and suicide have many causes; too much technology is clearly not the only one. And the teen suicide rate was even higher in the 1990s, long before smartphones existed. Then again, about four times as many Americans now take antidepressants, which are often effective in treating severe depression, the type most strongly linked to suicide. What\u2019s the connection between smartphones and the apparent psychological distress this generation is experiencing? For all their power to link kids day and night, social media also exacerbate the age-old teen concern about being left out. Today\u2019s teens may go to fewer parties and spend less time together in person, but when they do congregate, they document their hangouts relentlessly\u2014on Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook. Those not invited to come along are keenly aware of it. Accordingly, the number of teens who feel left out has reached all-time highs across age groups. Like the increase in loneliness, the upswing in feeling left out has been swift and significant. This trend has been especially steep among girls. Forty-eight percent more girls said they often felt left out in 2015 than in 2010, compared with 27 percent more boys. Girls use social media more often, giving them additional opportunities to feel excluded and lonely when they see their friends or classmates getting together without them. Social media levy a psychic tax on the teen doing the posting as well, as she anxiously awaits the affirmation of comments and likes. When Athena posts pictures to Instagram, she told me, \u201cI\u2019m nervous about what people think and are going to say. It sometimes bugs me when I don\u2019t get a certain amount of likes on a picture.\u201d\n\nGirls have also borne the brunt of the rise in depressive symptoms among today\u2019s teens. Boys\u2019 depressive symptoms increased by 21 percent from 2012 to 2015, while girls\u2019 increased by 50 percent\u2014more than twice as much. The rise in suicide, too, is more pronounced among girls. Although the rate increased for both sexes, three times as many 12-to-14-year-old girls killed themselves in 2015 as in 2007, compared with twice as many boys. The suicide rate is still higher for boys, in part because they use more-lethal methods, but girls are beginning to close the gap. These more dire consequences for teenage girls could also be rooted in the fact that they\u2019re more likely to experience cyberbullying. Boys tend to bully one another physically, while girls are more likely to do so by undermining a victim\u2019s social status or relationships. Social media give middle- and high-school girls a platform on which to carry out the style of aggression they favor, ostracizing and excluding other girls around the clock. Social-media companies are of course aware of these problems, and to one degree or another have endeavored to prevent cyberbullying. But their various motivations are, to say the least, complex. A recently leaked Facebook document indicated that the company had been touting to advertisers its ability to determine teens\u2019 emotional state based on their on-site behavior, and even to pinpoint \u201cmoments when young people need a confidence boost.\u201d Facebook acknowledged that the document was real, but denied that it offers \u201ctools to target people based on their emotional state.\u201d\n\nIn July 2014, a 13-year-old girl in North Texas woke to the smell of something burning. Her phone had overheated and melted into the sheets. National news outlets picked up the story, stoking readers\u2019 fears that their cellphone might spontaneously combust. To me, however, the flaming cellphone wasn\u2019t the only surprising aspect of the story. Why, I wondered, would anyone sleep with her phone beside her in bed? It\u2019s not as though you can surf the web while you\u2019re sleeping. And who could slumber deeply inches from a buzzing phone? Curious, I asked my undergraduate students at San Diego State University what they do with their phone while they sleep. Their answers were a profile in obsession. Nearly all slept with their phone, putting it under their pillow, on the mattress, or at the very least within arm\u2019s reach of the bed. They checked social media right before they went to sleep, and reached for their phone as soon as they woke up in the morning (they had to\u2014all of them used it as their alarm clock). Their phone was the last thing they saw before they went to sleep and the first thing they saw when they woke up. If they woke in the middle of the night, they often ended up looking at their phone. Some used the language of addiction. \u201cI know I shouldn\u2019t, but I just can\u2019t help it,\u201d one said about looking at her phone while in bed. Others saw their phone as an extension of their body\u2014or even like a lover: \u201cHaving my phone closer to me while I\u2019m sleeping is a comfort.\u201d\n\nIt may be a comfort, but the smartphone is cutting into teens\u2019 sleep: Many now sleep less than seven hours most nights. Sleep experts say that teens should get about nine hours of sleep a night; a teen who is getting less than seven hours a night is significantly sleep deprived. Fifty-seven percent more teens were sleep deprived in 2015 than in 1991. In just the four years from 2012 to 2015, 22 percent more teens failed to get seven hours of sleep. The increase is suspiciously timed, once again starting around when most teens got a smartphone. Two national surveys show that teens who spend three or more hours a day on electronic devices are 28 percent more likely to get less than seven hours of sleep than those who spend fewer than three hours, and teens who visit social-media sites every day are 19 percent more likely to be sleep deprived. A meta-analysis of studies on electronic-device use among children found similar results: Children who use a media device right before bed are more likely to sleep less than they should, more likely to sleep poorly, and more than twice as likely to be sleepy during the day. I\u2019ve observed my toddler, barely old enough to walk, confidently swiping her way through an iPad. Electronic devices and social media seem to have an especially strong ability to disrupt sleep. Teens who read books and magazines more often than the average are actually slightly less likely to be sleep deprived\u2014either reading lulls them to sleep, or they can put the book down at bedtime. Watching TV for several hours a day is only weakly linked to sleeping less. But the allure of the smartphone is often too much to resist.\n\nSleep deprivation is linked to myriad issues, including compromised thinking and reasoning, susceptibility to illness, weight gain, and high blood pressure. It also affects mood: People who don\u2019t sleep enough are prone to depression and anxiety. Again, it\u2019s difficult to trace the precise paths of causation. Smartphones could be causing lack of sleep, which leads to depression, or the phones could be causing depression, which leads to lack of sleep. Or some other factor could be causing both depression and sleep deprivation to rise. But the smartphone, its blue light glowing in the dark, is likely playing a nefarious role. The correlations between depression and smartphone use are strong enough to suggest that more parents should be telling their kids to put down their phone. As the technology writer Nick Bilton has reported, it\u2019s a policy some Silicon Valley executives follow. Even Steve Jobs limited his kids\u2019 use of the devices he brought into the world. What\u2019s at stake isn\u2019t just how kids experience adolescence. The constant presence of smartphones is likely to affect them well into adulthood. Among people who suffer an episode of depression, at least half become depressed again later in life. Adolescence is a key time for developing social skills; as teens spend less time with their friends face-to-face, they have fewer opportunities to practice them. In the next decade, we may see more adults who know just the right emoji for a situation, but not the right facial expression.", "description": "More comfortable online than out partying, post-Millennials are safer, physically, than adolescents have ever been.
