Repeat after me: It\u2019s okay.", "language": "en", "text": "Advice columnist\n\nDear Carolyn: My 19-year-old son who just graduated high school has suddenly decided he doesn't want to go to college. He wants to sweat and work hard, learning the electrical trade his father does for a living.\n\nHe worked hard in high school and was accepted into an elite health-care program. After two classes, he told me his heart isn't there anymore.\n\nIt has been hard for me to accept because he is so smart and could do anything. He says he is an adult now. He wants to make adult decisions and make his own money.\n\nOkay, I understand that. But it doesn't help that his girlfriend is always telling him he doesn't make his own decisions and I'm controlling.\n\nYes, I am controlling. I love him and didn't want to see him make the same mistakes I did. I set aside going back to school so I could help support his dreams.\n\nI want him to pay his own bills now. Car insurance, cellphone, credit card. I feel like it is time. My husband says I'm just mad he quit college.\n\nMaybe I am, but he needs to take responsibility. Am I asking too much or just being a controlling mother?\n\n\u2014 Controlling?\n\nControlling?: Maybe both, I can\u2019t tell from here \u2014 they\u2019re not mutually exclusive! \u2014 but I\u2019m with your husband. I see a mom lashing out at the son she believes let her down.\n\nAnd my problems with that are:\n\n\u25cf It\u2019s not about you. You made sacrifices, yes, but those never buy parents a specific outcome. It was and will always be the child\u2019s life to live.\n\n\u25cf It\u2019s prejudicial and unfair. A trade is not a disappointment relative to college, not if your goal is to raise loving, independent-minded, productive citizens who are comfortable in their own skin. A kid can become all those things on the college track, vocational track, military track, track-and-field track, make-it-up-as-you-go track. And \u201canything\u201d includes everything. Please tell me you\u2019ve taken a breath by now and recognized this.\n\n\u25cf It\u2019s not effective. Punishing him for his choices \u2014 emotionally, financially, however else \u2014 is not the path to a college-educated son. More likely, it\u2019s a path to estrangement from your defiantly-closing-his-mind-to-other-options son, since that\u2019s how kids, even grown ones, tend to react to being judged. Be flexible, and he might hear advice to take a year to earn money and think a bit, since quitting can be a good or bad decision but haste is rarely good. Keep being rigid, though, and he might never forget your contempt for his judgment and possibly eventual profession. Ouch.\n\n\u25cf You\u2019re dismissing inherent value. School is an end, not just a means to one. Learning is an end, not just a means to one. Support is an end, not just a means to one. Believing in your son was an end, not just a means to one. Love is an end, not just a means to one. Everything you gave your son to this point still stands as valuable unto itself. Whoever he becomes.\n\nMeanwhile, if you are indeed controlling, then you\u2019ve basically trained him to seek domineering partners and then take orders from them. In case you (or others reading this) need reasons to learn to back off.\n\nI hope you\u2019re just having a temporary freakout; I hope his girlfriend is not his next controller but instead just helping him separate in a developmentally appropriate if somewhat misguided way, and I hope his dropping out is a necessary first step in finding himself.\n\nYou might self-fulfill those prophesies, at least in part, by declaring to your son \u2014 as a unified front with your husband \u2014 that your plan was to support him through college, so you will likewise support him through trade education and/or a \u201cgap\u201d [limited time period] dedicated to figuring himself out and making unrushed decisions. Kids who are \u201cso smart\u201d and \u201ccould do anything\u201d often need time to grasp what that really means.\n\nHi, Carolyn: I had a mammogram and a couple of days later was told there was an abnormality and I needed to come in ASAP. I texted my husband the news, and he called me from work. I told him I had an appointment that afternoon, and he responded by asking me to text him when I got news.\n\nI was hurt he didn't ask to come with me. It was on a Friday afternoon and would have required him missing a few hours of work. He is a very loving husband (otherwise).\n\n\u2014 L.\n\nL.: So he is a very loving spouse who needed to be told outright that you wanted him with you.\n\nThere are a lot of them out there.\n\nPossibly because there are a lot of people who would prefer to go to the appointment solo (including yours truly) and/or who project their own preferences onto others.\n\nOr he was deliberately projecting calm.\n\nWhen in doubt, blame human variety. And when you want something, be prepared to ask.\n\nHope the tests came out okay.", "description": "Punishing him for his choices is the path to estrangement.", "authors": ["Carolyn Hax", "Advice Columnist", "September At Pm", "Carolyn Hax Started Her Advice Column In", "After Five Years As A Copy Editor", "News Editor In Style", "None As A Therapist.
