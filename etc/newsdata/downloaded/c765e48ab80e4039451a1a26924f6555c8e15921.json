It becomes even more weeknight-friendly if you take advantage of store-bought pre-cut vegetables to cut down on prep time. For a more protein-rich dish, season a dozen medium shrimp with olive oil, salt and pepper and nestle them into the paella during the last 5 minutes of baking. If preparing the dish for vegetarians, skip the chorizo, swap in vegetable broth and add an extra pinch of paprika, if desired. The only non-negotiable step is finishing the paella over direct flame on the stovetop so the rice at the bottom of the pan forms a delectable crust, also known as soccarat.", "description": "This weeknight paella comes together in just three basic steps: Sweat the aromatics, bake until tender, then return to the stovetop to cook until the rice becomes crunchy It becomes even more weeknight-friendly if you take advantage of store-bought pre-cut vegetables to cut down on prep time For a more protein-rich dish, season a dozen medium shrimp with olive oil, salt and pepper and nestle them into the paella during the last 5 minutes of baking", "authors": ["Kay Chun", "Sam Sifton", "Julia Moskin", "Sarah Digregorio", "Melissa Clark"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/19/dining/kc-smoky-paella/merlin_150673158_d668aacc-20a3-455b-8138-cadd0f8aba5c-articleLarge.jpg", "published_at": "2019-02-19"}
