Adam Schiff\u2019s (D-CA) Secret Impeachment Star Chamber this week.\n\nBased ONLY on what the partisan Schiff chose to leak, based ONLY on out-of-context information leaked by this partisan\u2019s unprecedented secret hearings aimed at overturning a presidential election, based ONLY on what he has been hand-fed by this partisan who was proven a serial liar during the Russia Collusion Hoax, Kurtz tells us that a few leaked minutes during a hearing that lasted hours \u201ccan\u2019t be dismissed.\u201d\n\nAnd this isn\u2019t far-left CNN, or the far-left Washington Post, or the far-left New York Times\u2026 This is Fox freakin\u2019 News. These are the guys who are supposed to be reasonable, skeptical, and push back against things like \u2014 oh, I don\u2019t know, something as unprecedented as a raging, proven liar going full-banana republic with secret hearings held in a basement to remove a Republican president from office by leaking out-of-context soundbites\u2026\n\nLook at this anti-science garbage Kurtz wrote:\n\nBut this particular bureaucrat was retired and reluctant to take the job that Mike Pompeo offered a few months ago. Taylor fought with the 101st Airborne in Vietnam and did stints in Iraq and Afghanistan overseeing reconstruction aid. He has worked for presidents of both parties since Ronald Reagan. George W. Bush made him ambassador to Ukraine 13 years ago. At 72, he had capped a classic career as a foreign service officer. And we don\u2019t have to rely on Democrats describing what Taylor said, as we have his 14-page opening statement. What made it so effective is that he recalled standing on one side of a damaged bridge in Ukraine last July, looking at \u201carmed and hostile\u201d Russian-backed separatists and concluding, as Washington held up the military aid, that \u201cmore Ukrainians would undoubtedly die without U.S. assistance.\u201d\n\nLet me respond in my own crude way\u2026\n\nAfter three goddamned years of the Russia Collusion Hoax, after three goddamned years of \u201cbombshell testimony\u201d proving the Orange Bad Man was Putin\u2019s puppet, after three goddamned years of Schiff looking newsmen and America in the eye to proclaim \u201cWe\u2019ve got the goods on Trump and Russia,\u201d after three goddamned years of one Deep State Never-Trumping-William-Taylor-Type-Hack offering \u201cbombshell\u201d testimony proving Trump colluded with Russia\u2026 Will you just look at Howie go.\n\nThis is pure useful idiocy, because even if he hates Trump, you would think Kurtz would have enough self-respect as a newsman\u2019s newsman to write the following\u2026\n\nOn top of the appalling spectacle of a serial-fabricator like Adam Schiff \u2014 a man who repeatedly deceived the media with unfounded claims he had evidence proving Trump colluded with Russia \u2014 holding secret hearings designed to overturn a presidential election outside of public view, we also have Schiff selectively leaking to the press. Based on his notorious history and this unprecedented Star Chamber, the idea that any responsible media outlet would lap up his hand-fed leaks, take them seriously, or do anything other than howl about how manipulative, dishonest, and un-American this entire process is, is beyond my comprehension.\n\nWilliam Taylor\u2019s opening statement might look bad for the president, but this is meaningless to anyone who lived through the Russia Collusion Hoax, a three-year process that saw dozens of Deep Staters make statements that appeared to damn the president but were later discredited with the full facts and full context became known.\n\nBecause we know Taylor was cross examined, and we also know Schiff refuses to release the results of this cross examination, no reporter worthy of that title should respond to these selective leaks other than to express outrage over Schiff\u2019s transparent and shameless manipulation of the press.\n\nThat\u2019s it. Until this process is fully transparent, that is the only story here.\n\nAnything else is Fake News.\n\nGood grief, this is not supposed to be hard. Schiff is a proven liar and partisan, William Taylor is a proven Never Trumper, there are three goddamned years of the Russia Collusion Hoax as precedent, and you have only heard one side of the story \u2014 and even that side has come via a selective leak! On top of that, you have three Republican congressmen claiming Taylor\u2019s (third-hand hearsay) testimony completely collapsed when challenged, and Kurtz is falling for it\u2026 in public\u2026 AGAIN!\n\nHey, here\u2019s a spoiler alert, Howie\u2026 But you would think that a newsman\u2019s newsman who was semi-conscious through just one year of the three-year Russia Collusion Hoax would have seen that one coming.\n\nGuys like Howard Kurtz are worse than dishonest and corrupt\u2026 they are utterly useless.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.
