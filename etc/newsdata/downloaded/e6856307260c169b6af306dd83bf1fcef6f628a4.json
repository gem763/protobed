He reminded them about the nature of long-term conflicts in the Middle East, and the toll they take on the U.S. military and American civilians as well.\n\n\u201cThese wars, they never end. And we have to bring our great soldiers back from the never-ending wars,\u201d Mr. Trump told the audience, citing the current disagreement between Turkey and Syria over a 22-mile stretch of land between the two nations.\n\n\u201cLet them have their borders. But I don\u2019t think that our soldiers should be there for the next 50 years guarding a border between Turkey and Syria when we can\u2019t guard our own borders at home,\u201d Mr. Trump advised.\n\nWhich makes some wonder if securing the border will be yet another \u201cendless war\u201d for the Trump administration to address. Numbers suggest this could be a possibility.\n\nThe Federation for American Immigration Reform now says there are 14.3 million people living illegally in the U.S. \u2014 up 2 million people since 2017. The organization blames it on \u201ccoordinated surges of migrant crossing our southern border illegally\u201d plus Obama-era policies that expanded the grounds for seeking political asylum and sanctuary policies that shield immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally from federal enforcement.\n\n\u201cMigrants from just about everywhere on Earth are crossing the border and staying put. Without action in Washington to secure the border and curb the abuses of our humanitarian policies, the dramatic increase in the illegal alien population and the commensurate dramatic increases in costs to U.S. taxpayers will continue unabated,\u201d warns Dan Stein, president of the nonpartisan interest group.\n\nFOR THE LEXICON\n\n\u201cBillionaires should not exist.\u201d\n\nYes, well. This is a new slogan from Sen. Bernard Sanders\u2018 campaign, which is using it as a fundraising tool for donations as high as $1,000 and up.\n\n\u201cNot a single billionaire has donated to our campaign. That\u2019s because our political revolution is powered by the working class. And when we\u2019re in the White House, we\u2019re going to pass a wealth tax that will finally make the billionaire class pay their fair share,\u201d the campaign reasons.\n\nSAVE THE DATE\n\nIt is a reality check of sorts. There really is a presidential election on the way despite shrill, inconclusive, biased and often erroneous media coverage of the event. Now we have something tangible to go on. The Commission on Presidential Debates has revealed the schedule for 2020 debates, all destined to run 90 minutes without commercials.\n\nThe first presidential debate is Sept. 29, 2020, at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana, the second on Oct. 15 at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, and the third on Oct. 22 at Belmont University in Nashville, Tennessee. The running mates will duke it out Oct. 7 at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City.\n\nA FEW MORE \u2018GUTSY WOMEN\u2019\n\nFormer Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and daughter Chelsea Clinton have a new book out titled \u201cThe Book of Gutsy Women,\u201d which lists a hundred women who have inspired them \u2014 a roster that includes former first lady Eleanor Roosevelt and former Democratic congresswoman Bella Abzug.\n\n\u201cThere are no conservative or libertarian women on the list because they don\u2019t embody the identity politics on which Clinton\u2019s failed campaigns have been based,\u201d writes American Thinker columnist Nicholas J. Kaster.\n\n\u201cTo be \u2018gutsy,\u2019 according to the Clintons, is \u2018about never giving up \u2014 and working to pave the way for the next generation.\u2019 With that in mind, here are the profiles of five gutsy women who didn\u2019t make the list because they don\u2019t fit Hillary\u2019s politically correct narrative,\u201d Mr. Kaster says \u2014 listing British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, ambassador Clare Boothe Luce, Eagle Forum founder Phyllis Schlafly, free market icon Ayn Rand and author Laura Ingalls Wilder.\n\n\u201cThere are of course many more women of accomplishment who don\u2019t fit the feminist agenda. More importantly, there are millions of ordinary women who don\u2019t aspire to leadership or fame, but do the vital work that sustains the nation, working and raising families, serving their churches, volunteering in their communities, and homeschooling their children. In 2016, Hillary had a word for those women \u2014 deplorables,\u201d Mr. Kaster concludes.\n\n\u2018PARTISAN POLITICAL THEATER\u2019\n\nWhite House counsel Pat Cipollone recently sent a detailed, eight-page letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi regarding the ongoing \u201cimpeachment inquiry.\u201d The White House also issued a helpful public statement which translates the legal phrases and cuts to the heart of the matter.\n\n\u201cThe president has done nothing wrong, and the Democrats know it. For purely political reasons, the Democrats have decided their desire to overturn the outcome of the 2016 election allows them to conduct a so-called impeachment inquiry that ignores the fundamental rights guaranteed to every American. These partisan proceedings are an affront to the Constitution \u2014 as they are being held behind closed doors and deny the President the right to call witnesses, to cross-examine witnesses, to have access to evidence, and many other basic rights,\u201d the statement said.\n\nThe statement summed it up this way: \u201cIn the process, they are violating civil liberties and the separation of powers, threatening Executive Branch officials with punishment simply for exercising their constitutional rights and prerogatives. All of this violates the Constitution, the rule of law, and every past precedent. For these reasons, the Executive Branch cannot be expected to, and will not participate in, this exercise of partisan political theater.\u201d\n\nPOLL DU JOUR\n\n\u2022 84% of Republicans would vote for President Trump if the GOP primary election was today; 88% of GOP men and 81% of GOP women agree.\n\n\u2022 8% are not sure which candidate they would choose in the primary; 6% of men and 10% of women agree.\n\n\u2022 3% would vote for former Rep.
