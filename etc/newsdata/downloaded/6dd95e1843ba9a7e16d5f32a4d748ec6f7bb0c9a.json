(Colin Hovde/C. Stanley Photography)\n\nTheater critic\n\nThe bloody clash of Prince Hal and Hotspur in \u201cHenry IV, Part 1\u201d is usually the hold-your-breath dramatic apex of Shakespeare\u2019s story of the rise of dissolute-turned-resolute Henry V. On the stage of Folger Theatre, though, the combatants hardly seem more committed to a fight to the finish than college roommates engaged in alcohol-fueled arm wrestling.\n\nIt\u2019s not the lack of physical engagement that drags down the scene; so much energy is expended in the sword fight of Avery Whitted\u2019s Hal and Tyler Fauntleroy\u2019s Hotspur that an actor\u2019s chest heaves uncontrollably for minutes after his \u201cdeath.\u201d What\u2019s missing is a palpable grit, particularly in Whitted\u2019s performance, that would help us to a belief in Hal\u2019s head-spinning pivot from idler and carouser to beloved hero of the realm.\n\nThe sense of squandered opportunity suffuses director Rosa Joshi\u2019s debut production for Folger, and it\u2019s a shame, because the talents of that premier Shakespearean, Edward Gero, are stranded on a middling evening. His Falstaff, a Rabelaisian mountain of self-regard and corruption, should be anchored in a potent tale of casting aside foolishness in favor of duty. Do we credit for a moment this impassive Hal taking pleasure in his escapades with Gero\u2019s transgressive Sir John? Or that Hal grasps in his doleful reply in the tavern scene \u2014 \u201cI do, I will\u201d \u2014 that he is to be the architect of Falstaff\u2019s downfall?\n\n\n\nTyler Fauntleroy as Hotspur, left, Naomi Jacobson as Worcester and U. Jonathan Toppo as Northumberland. (Colin Hovde/C. Stanley Photography)\n\nThe production, with its desperate rummaging for a look \u2014 the costumes by Kathleen Geldard often appear to be modeled on a catalogue for Barbour coats \u2014 is rooted in no discernible reality, an iffy proposition for one of the history plays. Scottish and Welsh characters speak in regional accents, while everyone else communicates in flat American, and the Cheapside scenes in which drunken Falstaff holds court are set in a \u201cMoulin Rouge\u201d-inspired disco \u2014 not a wholly bad idea, just never imaginatively developed. Novel, at least, is choreographer Alice Gosti\u2019s attempt to relieve the tedium of standard-issue Shakespeare battle scenes by reimagining them as cardio kickboxing exercises.\n\nPeter Crook\u2019s titular King Henry IV, meanwhile, seems so churlishly aloof that you can\u2019t find any compelling emotional rationale for Hal\u2019s contrite return. Henry invited deep animus in his kingdom with his usurpation of the throne of erratic Richard II; \u201cHenry IV, Part 1\u201d is an account of the poisonous fallout from a royal seizure that some in the nobility viewed as illegal. The divisiveness of his tenure certainly gives the play a contemporary ring. But aside from Gero\u2019s aptly debauched Falstaff \u2014 whose delivery of the nihilistic \u201cWhat is Honor?\u201d speech is the production\u2019s most effective moment \u2014 only Fauntleroy\u2019s Hotspur feels like a character who leaps from the page.\n\nThe part is made for an actor of bravura inclinations; Shakespeare piled on the pressure for Hal when he created this adversary of pure passion. Fauntleroy radiates the requisite fire even if the character\u2019s prideful stature isn\u2019t thoroughly embodied. Rebellious Hotspur is, after all, the essence of the honor that Falstaff dismisses as mere \u201cair.\u201d\n\nStill, it\u2019s a problem for a \u201cHenry IV\u201d production when the guy who stands in the way of the ostensible hero is the one you wish were left standing.\n\nHenry IV, Part 1, by William Shakespeare.
