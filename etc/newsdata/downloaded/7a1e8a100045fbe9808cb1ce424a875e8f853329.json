Maybe you\u2019ve even jumped on the internet to look for the country that\u2019s best for you.\n\nBig mistake.\n\nYou probably know the old saying: \u201cIf you don\u2019t know where you\u2019re going, how will you know when you get there?\u201d The same logic applies here.\n\nTo find your ideal overseas retirement destination, start by imagining everything you would want in your new 24/7/365 home. Be forewarned: This initial step may prove more difficult than it sounds. It\u2019s possible that you\u2019ve never truly asked yourself, \u201cWhat do I want in a retirement location?\u201d Give yourself permission to dream!\n\nWe\u2019ve been expats for quite a while, and suggest keeping in mind these four key elements when creating your Retire Abroad Wish List:\n\n1. Your cost of living\n\nThere are dozens of fantastic locations around the globe where a couple, for instance, can enjoy a comfortable lifestyle for anywhere from less than $20,000 a year to the sky\u2019s the limit. On which end of the spectrum do your finances fall?\n\nBegin by calculating your retirement budget.\n\nThe Social Security Administration offers a Retirement Estimator that provides an estimate of your future Social Security benefits based on your employment earnings. That figure plus your savings (minus your debt) will give you at least a rough idea of what you can afford to spend each month.\n\nAlso read: Here\u2019s how this CEO says millennials could solve the coming Social Security crisis\n\nThen, you\u2019ll be in a better position to identify locations where you\u2019ll be able to live within your means.\n\n2. Your preferred climate\n\nIf you could choose to live in any climate, what would it be? The heat and sun of the beach? Cool, clean mountain air? Do you enjoy the changing of the seasons or would you prefer year-round springtime?\n\nAll of those choices are available within a range of monthly income. Once you\u2019ve determined your budget, limit your search to places with the weather you want.\n\nSee: Retiring abroad is a lot more than living at the beach \u2014 here\u2019s what you need to know\n\nWe always recommend taking a scouting trip to your favorite location to make absolutely sure the place speaks to your heart as well as your head. Be sure to do this during the area\u2019s worst time of the year, climate-wise, so you know what you might expect should you decide to relocate there. Because if you\u2019re good with the weather then, you\u2019re gonna love it the rest of the time!\n\n3. Distance from your family\n\nYou may be able to adjust your budget and get used to fickle weather after retiring abroad. But before you make the move, make sure you\u2019re honest with yourself about how far away you\u2019d be comfortable living from your family. And how often you\u2019d want to return to the States to visit them.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen too many promising expat experiences go sour when separation from grandchildren proved too emotionally painful. Or when the needs of an aging parent required an immediate return home.\n\nRelated: Here are the countries with the most U.S. retirees collecting Social Security\n\nFortunately, there are plenty of desirable locations only a few hours away from the U.S. on an inexpensive flight. Even better, there\u2019s a good chance your cost of living abroad will be much less than it was in the U.S. In that case, you may be able to afford spending weeks with your loved ones when you visit, not days.\n\n4. Your daily life\n\nIt\u2019s important to envision what your daily life would look like in the country where you\u2019ll retire.\n\nFinding interesting and constructive ways to occupy your time can be challenging, though. A recent retirement study by the National Citizens Service in Great Britain found that one out of three retirees are bored after only a year.\n\nSo, spend some time thinking about what you\u2019ll want to do all day and whether the country you\u2019re considering will let you do it. Fishing? Golfing? Exploring museums? Community theater? Traveling? Volunteering? Only you know best which activities will be most appealing.\n\nAlso read: Retiring abroad: great health care, cheap rent. Here\u2019s the catch\n\nRemember, too, that retiring abroad will give you an opportunity to try new things, not just to do more of whatever you already enjoy.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nWhen prospective retirees assess their relocation needs and desires, they often wind up choosing an overseas location that reminds them of where they like to vacation.\n\nReality check: Vacation is where you go to escape from your daily life. You need to think about where you\u2019ll want to live your daily life.\n\nSo, invest the time and energy to write down everything you want in your new home abroad. Armed with this self-knowledge, you\u2019ll be equipped to find the overseas retirement destination of your dreams.\n\nHappy hunting!", "description": "Expats offer advice on how to find the overseas retirement destination of your dreams.", "authors": ["Edd Staton", "Cynthia Staton"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT456_na_ret_ZG_20191016170904.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
