Democrats are wasting so much time on nonsense.\u201d\n\nWOMAN WHO CONFRONTED O'ROURKE ON GUN CONFISCATION PLANS: 'SHAME ON HIM' FOR EXPLOITING 'OUR TRAGEDIES'\n\nO'Rourke's pointed declaration during a recent debate \u2014 \"Hell yes, we're gonna take your AR-15, your AK-47\" \u2014 stoked longstanding fears among gun owners that Democrats are less interested in safety than they are in seizing firearms.\n\nO'Rourke's remarks came in the wake of several high-profile shootings, including two in his home state of Texas that involved AR- or AK-style guns, which resemble military-style weapons and generally carry more rounds than other rifles. A summer of carnage was marked by shootings in Gilroy, Calif.; El Paso, Texas; and Dayton, Ohio; and over a 10-mile stretch between Midland and Odessa, Texas. In all, more than 40 people were killed and about 100 were wounded in the attacks.\n\nBesides stirring up concerns among Second Amendment supporters, O\u2019Rourke\u2019s comment has also been seen by some political observers as hurting his future in Texas, should he choose to run statewide again.\n\nTexas political activists assert that O\u2019Rourke can't win in Texas anymore with these positions.\n\n\u201cO'Rourke's \u2018hell yes\u2019 to gun confiscation demonstrates how little he knows about Texans and rifles,\u201d said JoAnn Fleming, the executive director of Grassroots America, We the People PAC, a conservative group in Texas. \u201cBy shooting off his mouth, Beto managed to end his political career in Texas, while driving up rifle sales.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFox News' Maxim Lott and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "President Trump on Monday slammed Democratic presidential primary hopeful Beto O\u2019Rourke for his controversial comment from a recent debate about confiscating semi-automatic weapons \u2013 arguing that statements like the one made by the former Texas representative make it more difficult for Democrats to accomplish any meaningful legislation regarding firearms.", "authors": ["Andrew O'Reilly"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/09/13/694940094001_6086089819001_6086072945001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
