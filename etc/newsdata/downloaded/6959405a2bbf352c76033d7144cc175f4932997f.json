If you can just kind of appreciate yourself and know your worth, your value, that you can be a happy person.\"\n\nABC\n\nInstead of consuming yourself with concerns over other people's opinions or waiting on someone else to validate your worth and create joy for you, produce your own positive self-worth and fulfillment, Lopez said.\n\n\"I'm happy. I have a great life. I'm a good person. I live in a good way. ... I have great friends and I can call somebody and go anywhere and do anything. ... I'm healthy.

You decide, I want to get better everyday.\"\n\nLopez and her fianc\u00e9 Alex Rodriguez made things official while vacationing on a beach in March.
