Another told Mr Negroponte to \"shut up,\" adding: \"We've been cleaning up your messes for the past eight years.\"\n\nMIT's Media Lab is an interdisciplinary research centre founded in 1985.\n\nIt has been behind several technological innovations, including the electronic ink used in the Amazon Kindle, and video game Guitar Hero.\n\nMuch of the lab's funding comes from nearly 90 corporate sponsors, though those companies are not allowed to support or direct any of the research.", "description": "Joichi Ito's move comes after claims that MIT tried to conceal gifts from the disgraced financier.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/FC21/production/_108654546_hi056333962.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
