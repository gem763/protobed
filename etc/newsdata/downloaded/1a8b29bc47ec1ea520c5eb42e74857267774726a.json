News insider dished: 'Jenni and Zack spent the day Saturday at Universal Studios in Orlando. They are trying to work things out.'\n\nThe way they were: There may be hope for Jenni 'JWoww' Farley and Zack Carpinello, who according to an E! News insider 'are trying to work things out' a week post-split\n\nJWoww and Zack broke up after last Thursday's episode of Jersey Shore: Family Vacation showed him feeling up her co-star Angelina Pivarnick in a nightclub.\n\nAngelina shared during a confessional on Thursday's episode: 'So we're all dancing and having a great time. Jenni is obliviated drunk, passed out on her man right now. And all of a sudden, I just feel this big hand just, like, right on me.'\n\nWhen JWoww got wind of the incident, she refused to believe Angelina's story, snapping at Angelina on the show: 'How much do you commit to a lie?'\n\nBut after watching the incident play out on MTV, JWoww posted an Instagram statement last Thursday night about Zack's indiscretion.\n\nTrouble: On last week's episode of Jersey Shore: Family Vacation, Zack wrapped his hand around Angelina Pivarnick's waist in a nightclub and touched her bum\n\n'After seeing tonight\u2019s episode I\u2019m pretty hurt. I feel disrespected by someone I called a friend and by someone who stated they loved me,' said JWoww.\n\n'I made mistakes that I cannot take back, which I take full responsibility for,' JWoww's hunk wrote in a lengthy Instagram apology Saturday.\n\nThen on this Thursday's episode, Angelina could be seen arriving drunk at JWoww and Zack's hotel room door and vamping that she wanted a threesome.\n\nFeud: JWoww and Angelina grappled on Twitter after this Thursday's episode showed the latter jokingly asking the former and her beau for a threesome\n\nAngelina responded to the episode by tweeting Thursday: 'when I asked about a three some everyone knew it was a joke. I even knocked on their door and was laughing that scene was after the pool and after the fight him and I had. i never had a three some In my life and I sure as hell wouldn\u2019t want one at 33 years old.'\n\nJWoww quoted that tweet and wrote: 'h ok that makes sense. Glad what you did was a joke, and u grinding on him was a joke\u2026 and u kissing him was a joke. BUT when he joked back, you made it seem like he was a creep and destroyed him in interview. Got it. Makes total sense now.'\n\nShe married truck driver Roger Matthews in 2015 and welcomed two children with him - Meilani, five, and Greyson, three.\n\nThe mother of two filed for divorce last October and by this April it emerged that she was with Zack. Her split from Roger was finalized in August.", "description": "There may be hope for Jenni 'JWoww' Farley and Zack Carpinello.", "authors": ["Sameer Suri For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/20/07/19948690-0-image-a-90_1571553757154.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
