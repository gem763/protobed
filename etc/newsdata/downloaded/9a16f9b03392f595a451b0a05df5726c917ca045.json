Fears over the negative economic impact of the U.S. trade war with China are weighing on Chinese stocks, and recent rumors that the White House is considering limiting U.S. investment in China are making investors uneasy.\n\nCheapest China Stocks\n\nFor investors who are bullish on China in the long-term, the trade war has created plenty of buying opportunities. The following are 11 U.S.-listed Chinese stocks with market caps of at least $2 billion with the lowest forward PE ratios, according to Finviz:\n\nSinopec Shanghai Petrochemical Co. ADR (NYSE: SHI), 5.1 forward PE. China Petroleum & Chemical Corp ADR (NYSE: SNP), 7.4 forward PE. China Telecom Corporation Limited (NYSE: CHA), 9.1 forward PE. Vipshop Holdings Ltd - ADR (NYSE: VIPS), 9.2 forward PE. Momo Inc (NASDAQ: MOMO), 9.7 forward PE. Huaneng Power International Inc ADR Class N (NYSE: HNP), 10.0 forward PE.

Weibo Corp (NASDAQ: WB), 14.7 forward PE.\n\nBenzinga\u2019s Take\n\nMany experts expect the trade war to ultimately be resolved at some point.\n\nIf the U.S. and China ultimately reach a trade deal, there could be a huge relief rally in battered Chinese stocks. China remains the world\u2019s largest emerging market economy, with a $15.5-trillion annual GDP, second to only the U.S.\n\nEven amid the trade war, China\u2019s second-quarter GDP growth rate of 6.2% in the second quarter was more than triple the 2% U.S. growth rate. China also has more than four times the population of the U.S., at 1.43 billion.\n\nDo you agree with this take?
