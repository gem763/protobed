The baby was transported to CHEO in Ottawa and was initially reported to be in critical condition, but succumbed to his injuries later that evening.\n\nMan suffered serious burns\n\nPatrick L'Abb\u00e9e-Chouinard, a man in his 30s, suffered burns to 85 per cent of his body and subsequently underwent surgery in Montreal, according to his mother.\n\nA 20-month-old girl also suffered serious injuries. Both are still in hospital, Gatineau Police Service spokesperson Andr\u00e9e East said Friday.\n\nA 12-year-old child suffered minor burns in the fire, as did the woman police arrested, said East.\n\n\"She was one of the persons who was injured. It was not serious injuries, but she was injured as well. She was in the apartment at the moment of the fire,\" East said.\n\nEast said investigators eventually determined that two vehicles had been set ablaze: one parked outside and one parked inside.\n\n\"This is the only information that we can give at this point. But everything will be released in court,\" she said.\n\nReleased with conditions\n\nThe woman walked into a Gatineau courtroom Friday afternoon in handcuffs, wiping tears from her eyes. She had difficulty speaking as she addressed the judge.\n\nShe was released with a number of conditions, including not having any contact with three people.
