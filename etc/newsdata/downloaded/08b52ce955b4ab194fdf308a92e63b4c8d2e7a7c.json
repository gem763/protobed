We see people urinating against buildings or pulling their pants down and squatting because they have nowhere else to go.\u201d\n\nPeople said they have seen human waste deposits in gutters, planters, doorways, and even in plain sight in the middle of the street\u2014 and they say it is bad for business.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s prolific. It\u2019s on every block and at the base of most trees,\u201d said businessman Gary Ressler. \u201cI can\u2019t bring national tenants here and walk through downtown without having them observe human feces littering the sidewalk.\u201d\n\nThe reason for the increase in defecation on the streets mostly stems from a homelessness crisis throughout the U.S. that is hard to solve, but a critical shortage in public bathrooms available to those who live on the streets or cannot find room at a shelter makes it difficult for these people to maintain personal hygiene.\n\n\u201cMost of us do not want to defecate or urinate in public,\u201d said David Beaty, a homeless man who came to Miami from Wisconsin. \u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019re losing your dignity, your humanity. We\u2019re not animals. I personally use a cup and dump it because I don\u2019t want to smell my urine or anybody else\u2019s while I\u2019m sleeping.\n\nAccording to a survey from the Miami Dade County Homeless Trust, the homeless population in Miami\u2019s central business district soared 16 percent since January.\n\nFour years ago, Miami\u2019s poop problem became so bad that the city\u2019s Downtown Development Authority created a poop map with smiling emojis locating each spot where feces was found over the course of an eight-hour workday.\n\nThe map, meant to shame public officials and to make them pay attention to the issue, was similar to a project San Francisco did in 2013.\n\nA 2018 report found that San Francisco was on track to become one of the dirtiest cities in the world due to the amount of feces and hypodermic needles littered on the ground.", "description": "Homeless people are defecating on the sidewalks and streets of downtown Miami, turning the city into an outdoor wasteland, residents say.", "authors": ["Katherine Rodriguez"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-672574-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
