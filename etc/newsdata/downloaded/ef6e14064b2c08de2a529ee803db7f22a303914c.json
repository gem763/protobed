It includes 9,700 kilometre submarine cable between Japan, Guam, and Australia (JGA), and a 550 kilometre undersea fibre optic cable that will connect the JGA cable to the new landing station.\n\nPremier Annastacia Palaszczuk boasted that when the cable is completed, it will help generate almost AU$1 billion in new investment for the state economy.\n\n\"Better connectivity means faster processing times for bigger data and more jobs,\" she said.\n\n\"The cable will be able to provide Australia's fastest data and telecommunications transmission speeds to Asia and the second fastest to the USA.\n\n\"It pitches Queensland firms to the forefront of the digital economy and will be a major drawcard for businesses and investment.\"\n\nAs for the next steps, the Sunshine Coast Council outlined that construction for the installation of the subsea cable will begin towards the end of the year, which will involve horizontal drilling under the beach dune and approximately 700 metres offshore.\n\nSUBSEA CABLES ACROSS THE GLOBE", "description": "It will house the connection of the AU$35 million Japan-Guam-Australia subsea system.", "authors": ["Aimee Chanthadavong"], "top_image": "https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/09/07/3b9ca7f4-feaf-4bc8-93e4-d5f4aa4e0757/thumbnail/770x578/dd874f4287a7c2b8f8ece8dc05a1f9a3/jga-sunshine-coast.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
