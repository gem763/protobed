(Mike Theiler/Reuters)\n\nMaking the click-through worthwhile: President Trump suddenly realizes that hosting the G-7 summit at his Doral resort is a bridge too far for many of his Republican allies; some new data shows that the Chinese economy is slowing down, suggesting that Beijing may be feeling the pain of the tariffs more than they\u2019re letting on; and a new election security bill would put the federal government into the business of deciding what is and what is not \u201clegitimate\u201d journalism.\n\nIf President Trump Can Change His Mind on the G-7 . . .\n\nFor much of the Trump era, there\u2019s been this recurring qualified defense of the president from his fans: Ignore the tweets, look at the policies. Ignore the nonsensical statements that are beneath the presidency and look at the results. Look past the revolving door cabinet and look at the judicial appointments instead. Don\u2019t stare in bewilderment and exasperation at the president\u2019s furious denunciations of his own appointed officials, and stare at your tax return and low the unemployment rate.\n\nThat was a strong argument for a while. But it was stronger before the tariffs of the trade war started hitting American manufacturing harder, before the president decided to remain quiet about the Hong Kong protests while griping about the NBA, before Turkey invaded Syria in an effort to wipe out Kurds who had fought alongside us against ISIS, before captured ISIS fighters started breaking out of prison, before North Korea started testing missiles again . . .\n\nOh, and the outlook for keeping GOP control of the Senate doesn\u2019t look so hot and the GOP could go 0 for 3 in the governors\u2019 races this year. But other than that, everything\u2019s peachy.\n\nWhen you demand to be graded entirely on results, you had better generate consistently good results. Step one would be to stop stepping on rakes and concentrate your energies and focus on the battles that matter most, and stop dragging your political allies into battles that they have no interest in fighting. A big fight over hosting the G-7 at Trump\u2019s Doral resort would have been the opposite of that. Thankfully, at some point, President Trump realized his party was getting tired of defending him in fights with no public policy gain:\n\nPresident Trump was forced to abandon his decision to host next year\u2019s Group of Seven summit at his private golf club after it became clear the move had alienated Republicans and swiftly become part of the impeachment inquiry that threatens his presidency. In a round of phone calls with conservative allies this weekend, Trump was told Republicans are struggling to defend him on so many fronts, according to an administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal matters.\n\nIf President Trump can recognize his mistake and correct course on this front . . . why can\u2019t he do it on other fronts?\n\nTrump should recognize that Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan doesn\u2019t respect him and stop trying to win him over.\n\nThat goes double for Kim Jong Un in North Korea.\n\nAs the Washington Examiner noted, the president should stop boasting about Chinese trade deals until the Chinese government commits in writing. Beijing has pulled the rug out from under him several times, and he never seems to learn.\n\nTrump wants the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement passed \u2014 and so does the Mexican government! It\u2019s a rare case of the administration working in cooperation with a foreign government, where Nancy Pelosi is being the obstacle to a broadly supported bipartisan deal. Prime Minister Blackface, er, Justin Trudeau reached out to Pelosi to assure her that Canada would hold up its end of the bargain. This is a big legislative accomplishment and campaign promise fulfilled \u2014 if he can just get the House to pass the legislation.\n\nAlso, the president should probably tell Rudy Giuliani to get off the television.\n\nIs China\u2019s Economy Hurting More than Beijing Is Letting on?\n\nAs noted above, we\u2019re getting the worse end of the tariff war, but that doesn\u2019t mean China is escaping unscathed. Back on September 10, I pointed to a Wall Street Journal report and other evidence that the Chinese economy might be feeling more pain from the trade war than they\u2019re letting on.\n\nFriday, the Chinese government announced its economy \u201cgrew by 6 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier. It\u2019s believed to be China\u2019s slowest GDP gain in at least 27 and a half years.\u201d (It\u2019s worth noting that some economists who study China believe the government adjusts the numbers to paint a prettier picture than reality.) And this morning the International Monetary Fund projected even slower growth \u2014 declaring \u201cthe Chinese economy could grow at 5.8 percent next year \u2014 slower than the 6.1 percent forecast for 2019.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Chinese government seems to be getting angrier with the National Basketball Association, not calming down.\n\nNBA commissioner Adam Silver will face \u201cretribution sooner or later\u201d for saying that Beijing wanted him to fire the general manager of the Houston Rockets, state broadcaster CCTV said in a commentary published late Friday. The government-controlled broadcaster said Silver \u201ccrossed the bottom line\u201d by continuing to defend Houston Rockets GM Daryl Morey. \u201cTo cater to the taste of certain American politicians,\u201d CCTV claims, Silver \u201cfabricated lies out of thin air\u201d and portrayed China as unforgiving. \u201cI saw that in the news, and I specifically checked that with the competent authority. The answer is, the Chinese government has never raised such demands,\u201d Geng Shuang, spokesman for the Chinese Ministry, said Friday according to a transcript posted on the ministry website. \u201cSilver is making every effort to portray himself as a defender of free speech and is using so-called \u2018freedom of speech\u2019 to cover for Morey, who voiced support for violent elements in Hong Kong,\u201d CCTV said, in a translation by CNBC.\n\nSure, because the same Chinese government that puts a couple million people in concentration camps would never go so far as to demand somebody be fired and then lie about it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoth Silver and the rest of the NBA \u2014 and the rest of the American business community \u2014 have to be asking themselves, is access to the Chinese market worth the risk of suddenly becoming an enemy of a rather ruthless foreign power over a tweet?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn Election Security Bill That Also Determines \u2018Legitimate\u2019 Journalism\n\nThis week, the House is expected to pass another election security bill, this one called the \u201cStopping Harmful Interference in Elections for a Lasting Democracy, or SHIELD, Act.\u201d\n\nThe bill would require political campaigns to report any attempt by a foreign government or individual to influence an election to the Federal Election Commission and the FBI. It also would apply all of the current FCC rules on political advertising to the Internet and social media, \u2014 meaning disclaimers about who paid for the ad \u2014 but makes an exemption or \u201ca communication appearing in a news story, commentary, or editorial distributed through the facilities of any broadcasting station or any online or digital newspaper, magazine, blog, publication, or periodical.\u201d All online platforms would have to keep records of requests to advertise on their sites and make those records available to the public if the expenditures are $500 or more.\n\nThose records would need to include a digital copy of the ad, \u201ca description of the audience targeted by the advertisement, the number of views generated from the advertisement, and the date and time that the advertisement is first displayed and last displayed,\u201d the ad rates, the candidate the ad or issue refers to, and the name and address of the person purchasing the advertisement.\n\nBut the real wrinkle comes in the section that declares, \u201cNothing in this subtitle or the amendments made by this subtitle shall be construed to impede legitimate journalistic activities.\u201d At some point, the federal agencies enforcing this law would have to determine what is \u201clegitimate\u201d journalism and what is not \u201clegitimate\u201d journalism. And Republican House members are understandably concerned that having the government decide which journalistic institutions are \u201clegitimate\u201d will set up First Amendment challenges down the road.\n\nSeparately, the bill would set penalties of up to five years in prison and fines up to $100,000 for \u201cknowingly disseminating false written, electronic, telephonic, or other statements regarding Federal elections within 60 days of an election.\u201d No word on whether it would apply to the old joke, \u201cbecause of expectations of high turnout, Republicans will vote on Tuesday, Democrats will vote on Wednesday.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe SHIELD Act on elections should not be mistaken for the Strengthening Homeland Security, Intelligence, and Essential Law Enforcement Departments Act of 2019 or the Stopping Harmful Image Exploitation and Limiting Distribution Act of 2019.\n\nRegarding the bill\u2019s title, I\u2019m reminded of the first episode of Marvel\u2019s Agents of SHIELD.\n\nMaria Hill: What does S.H.I.E.L.D. stand for, Agent Ward?\n\nGrant Ward: Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division.\n\nHill: And what does that mean to you?\n\nWard: It means someone really wanted our initials to spell out \u201cshield.\u201d\n\nADDENDUM: You\u2019ve probably heard Bill and Hillary Clinton\u2019s 1992 interview with 60 Minutes\u2019 Steve Kroft, the one where Hillary declared, \u201cI\u2019m not sitting here, some little woman, standing by my man like Tammy Wynette. I\u2019m here because I love him.\u201d What you probably didn\u2019t know was that during the interview, a light fell off the wall and nearly hit the Clintons!\n\nMaybe the light just couldn\u2019t take it anymore. Or maybe the lamp simply refused to be part of an activity whose objective was the opposite of illumination.", "description": "When you demand to be graded entirely on results, you had better generate consistently good results.", "authors": ["Jim Geraghty", "William Z.
