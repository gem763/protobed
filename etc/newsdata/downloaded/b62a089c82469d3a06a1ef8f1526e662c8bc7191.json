(Win McNamee/Getty Images)\n\nPresident Trump lauded the rollout of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's drug pricing plan yesterday without endorsing it.\n\nNow the question is whether the president, Pelosi and top Senate Republican Mitch McConnell can find enough common ground for a grand deal by the end of the year aimed at lowering the prices of prescription drugs. There's overlap among what the House, Senate and White House envision -- and that's where where lawmakers could reach a bipartisan agreement.\n\nTrump seemed eager for movement on the Hill, also praising another bipartisan drug pricing plan written by Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and ranking Democrat Ron Wyden (Ore.):\n\nBecause of my Administration, drug prices are down for the first time in almost 50 years \u2014 but the American people need Congress to help. I like Sen. Grassley\u2019s drug pricing bill very much, and it\u2019s great to see Speaker Pelosi\u2019s bill today. Let\u2019s get it done in a bipartisan way! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 19, 2019\n\nCapitol Hill was abuzz as lawmakers, patient advocates and the health-care industry responded to the speaker\u2019s plan, which would allow the federal government to negotiate the prices of at least 25 and perhaps as many as 250 brand-name drugs in Medicare. Top House committees plan to hold hearings on the measure over the next few weeks, with a goal of an eventual vote in the whole Democratic-led House later this fall.\n\nLarry Levitt, Kaiser Family Foundation executive vice president for health policy:\n\nThere are still big questions about the scope of Speaker Pelosi's drug plan, but what shouldn't get lost is how far-reaching the plan is.\n\n\n\nFederal negotiation of drug prices for everyone, capped at what other countries pay.\n\n\n\nLimiting price increases in Medicare to inflation. \u2014 Larry Levitt (@larry_levitt) September 19, 2019\n\nPolitico's Dan Diamond:\n\n(Pelosi and Democrats put out their drug-price plan two hours ago.) https://t.co/J7qvApUlVX \u2014 Dan Diamond (@ddiamond) September 19, 2019\n\nRachel Sachs, law professor at Washington University:\n\nSpeaker Pelosi's drug pricing package is finally out. If enacted, it would completely reform our drug pricing and reimbursement system. I will have lengthier thoughts later, but a few things for now. https://t.co/TNuQVy6QAw 1/6 \u2014 Rachel Sachs (@RESachs) September 19, 2019\n\nPelosi angered progressives by toning it down from an earlier draft, which would have made 250 drugs the floor instead of the ceiling. Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Wis.), co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, appeared critical of the limits set for how many drugs could be negotiated.\n\n\u201cWe still are watching a few things,\u201d Pocan told my Washington Post colleague Yasmeen Abutaleb. \u201cYou can have everything great in the world, but if you have a few handfuls of drugs negotiated then it\u2019s not going to look the same to the public as something more substantive.\u201d\n\nVia The Hill's Peter Sullivan:\n\nFor the progressives:\n\n\n\nPelosi says she's open to increasing the floor from 25 drugs being negotiated, calls it an \"open point.\"\n\n\n\nHer concern is the \"absorptive capacity of the Secretary's office\" to operationalize it\n\n\n\nThis is big issue for progressiveshttps://t.co/5Y0iGsZF0m \u2014 Peter Sullivan (@PeterSullivan4) September 19, 2019\n\nOn the other end of the political spectrum, Pelosi\u2019s plan was swiftly condemned by Republicans and pharmaceutical companies, who aired their usual message that such negotiations amount to government price-fixing. Even before Pelosi held a news conference announcing her plan, all two dozen of the House Energy and Commerce\u2019s Republicans issued a joint statement criticizing it.\n\nMcConnell, who would play a key role in any final agreement, called the Pelosi bill a non-starter.\n\n\u201cSocialist price controls will do a lot of left-wing damage to the health-care system,\u201d McConnell said yesterday afternoon. \u201cAnd of course we're not going to be calling up a bill like that.\u201d\n\nHouse Energy and Commerce Committee Republicans:\n\nAll 2\ufe0f\u20e34\ufe0f\u20e3 E&C Republicans criticize @SpeakerPelosi for putting \"Politics over Progress\" and call for bipartisan solutions to bring down drug prices for patients.

Instead, policymakers should pursue practical policy solutions...\" full statement below pic.twitter.com/YjkOQvGoX1 \u2014 Jacquie Lee (@_jacquie_lee) September 19, 2019\n\nMeanwhile, America's Health Insurance Plans neither endorsed nor condemned the plan, Bloomberg News's Alex Ruoff notes:\n\nAHIP has a very middle-ground comment on Pelosi's drug pricing bill. They call it \"bold\" and praise the out-of-pocket and targeting list prices, but hold back on endorsing. pic.twitter.com/BFtBVCca5B \u2014 Alex Ruoff (@Alexruoff) September 19, 2019\n\nBut at this point the reactions are political kabuki, because the parties still share strong aspirations to reach a deal. And there\u2019s reason to believe it could still happen.\n\nIf you look at the bipartisan Senate bill co-written by Grassley and Wyden, there\u2019s plenty of overlap with the Pelosi proposal. Both measures would cap out-of-pocket costs for seniors in the traditional Medicare program and would require rebates from drug companies who raise drug prices faster than inflation.\n\nBoth the House plan and a proposal last fall from the Trump administration would draw from lower prescription drug prices in other developed countries. Pelosi is proposing to set a maximum price on negotiated drugs, based on an average of prices paid by six other countries. The administration says it\u2019s working on a proposal to base the price of some Medicare drugs on an average of prices paid in 16 other countries.\n\nRodney Whitlock, former health policy staffer for Grassley:\n\nAs drug pricing policy goes, you can see the opportunity for policy agreement. Political agreement is a totally different conversation. pic.twitter.com/dQurI5fbwy \u2014 Rodney L. Whitlock (@RodneyLWhitlock) September 19, 2019\n\nAnd while Trump says he backs the bill by Grassley and Wyden which notably wouldn\u2019t allow the government to directly negotiate lower prices, the White House has privately told Democrats it\u2019s open to the idea.\n\n\u201cHealth and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and White House domestic policy director Joe Grogan met with a group of moderate House Democrats last week to discuss drug pricing measures,\u201d Yasmeen reported. \u201cThey told the group the White House is open to Medicare drug price negotiations but supported measures that could pass the Republican-controlled Senate.\u201d\n\nThe administration held fire yesterday on Pelosi\u2019s plan; a White House spokesman pointed to Trump's tweet when I asked for a response.\n\nSo the pieces are there for a year-end deal on drug pricing. The question is whether lawmakers will have enough political will to fit them all together.\n\nYou are reading The Health 202, our must-read newsletter on health policy.

(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)\n\nAHH: The Trump administration has formally reversed its plan to cancel a legal protection allowing migrants facing life-threatening illnesses to stay in the United States while they get treatment. The Department of Homeland Security sent a letter to the House Oversight Committee saying it would resume considering all so-called deferred action applications on a case-by-case basis.\n\nThe administration drew backlash when it said last month that it would eliminate protections for critically ill children and their families that allows them to avoid deportation while they receive treatment.\n\n\u201cIf today\u2019s statement is accurate, it appears that the Trump Administration is reversing its inhumane and disastrous decision to deport critically ill children and their families who are receiving life-saving medical treatment in the United States,\u201d House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) said in a statement.\n\n\u201cLast week, the Oversight Committee held a hearing on the policy, where children suffering from cystic fibrosis and other illnesses testified they could die if sent back to their home countries,\u201d NBC\u2019s Heidi Przybyla reports. \u201cThe committee was scheduled to hold an additional hearing on the matter next week, with testimony from Ken Cuccinelli, acting director of the Citizenship and Immigration Services, and the acting ICE Director Matthew Albence.\u201d\n\nThe Purdue Pharma logo is displayed at the drugmaker's offices in Stamford, Conn. (Douglas Healey/AP)\n\nOOF: Purdue Pharma wants to pay \u201ccertain employees\u201d more than $34 million in bonuses for their work over the last three years, citing \u201chighly coveted\u201d skills of some employees working at a company that is going through troubled times. The legal filing asking a judge to authorize the bonuses comes even as Purdue is facing thousands of lawsuits and days after the company filed bankruptcy, our Post colleague Peter Whoriskey reports.\n\n\u201cIt is not clear from the company filings why employees would be eligible for bonuses, because, while the bonuses are supposed to be partly contingent on the company\u2019s financial performance, the company has filed for bankruptcy,\u201d Peter writes. \"At a bankruptcy court hearing in White Plains, N.Y., on Tuesday, Paul K. Schwartzberg, an attorney for the U.S. Trustee, raised objections to some of the bonuses. While it is typical for companies in bankruptcy to try to pay employees as a firm seeks to regain its financial footing, the Purdue Pharma bonuses go 'way beyond' what is typical, he said.\"\n\nConnecticut Attorney General William Tong said in a statement to The Post that the money should go to those affected by the opioid crisis.\n\n\u201cThat $34 million is owed to the victims of the opioid epidemic, and every last cent should be spent on addiction science, treatment and recovery,\u201d Tong said. \u201cPurdue and the Sacklers still don\u2019t seem to comprehend the pain and suffering they have caused. While I am sympathetic to the workers at Purdue, many of whom live in my hometown and state and had nothing to do with the egregious actions of their employer, this not business as usual.\u201d\n\nOUCH: The nationwide outbreak of vaping-related illnesses is growing. Federal officials announced there are now 530 individuals across 38 states that have been sickened by the disease, with all reported cases having a history of e-cigarette or vaping use, our Post colleague Lena H. Sun reports.\n\nOfficials are still not sure what\u2019s been causing the illnesses, and health officials are warning anyone concerned to avoid using e-cigarette or vaping products.\n\n\u201cInitial data shows that most people had a history of using e-cigarette products containing THC, that many people said they used both nicotine and THC, and that some reported using only nicotine products. Many people have also said they used black market or illicit THC products. THC is the active ingredient in marijuana that produces the high,\u201d Lena writes.\n\nNearly 25% of high schoolers are vaping regularly.

We need to get these flavors off the market.\u201d\n\nHEALTH ON THE HILL\n\n\u2014 Late-night host Stephen Colbert gave Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) her latest chance to answer whether she would raise middle-class taxes to pay for Medicare-for-all. And Warren dodged again.\n\nIn the last presidental debate, Warren answered the question by insisting Medicare-for-all would overall lower costs for middle-class Americans. When she did the same with Colbert, the host pushed her on it, saying: \u201cIsn\u2019t Medicare-for-all like public school? There might be taxes for it, but you certainly save a lot of money on sending your kids to school, and do you want to live in a world where kids aren\u2019t educated. Do you want to live in a world where your fellow citizens are dying, even if it costs a little bit of money.\u201d\n\n\"It's valid for Warren to want to refocus the issue on total costs rather than just taxes,\u201d The Post\u2019s Aaron Blake writes. \"This is why Warren supporters hate this question. They view it as an unfair attempt to give Republicans a talking point that \u2018Elizabeth Warren is going to raise middle-class taxes!\u2019 when, in fact, people\u2019s total costs would go down.\u201d Aaron adds it\u2019s important to note studies show that while most people would pay less in such a system, it\u2019s not necessarily consistent for all people.\n\nAt the same time, why not just level with people about it, as Colbert suggests? Warren's responses are opening her up to criticism from Democratic rivals. South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg said this on CNN: \u201cSenator Warren is known for being straightforward and was extremely evasive when asked that question, and we\u2019ve seen that repeatedly.\u201d\n\n\u2014 And here are a few more good reads:\n\nBusiness House passes short-term spending bill, punting shutdown fight to November The legislation extending government funding through Nov. 21 is expected to pass Senate next week Erica Werner\n\nOPIOID OPTICS\n\nPurdue Led Its Opioid Rivals in Pills More Prone to Abuse When taking into account the dosage strength of each pill, Purdue Pharma\u2019s OxyContin represented a market-leading 27% of total oxycodone sold during a seven-year period reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.
