Do you think?\u201d\n\nGingrich tried to defend the president with a big helping of whataboutism.\n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s exactly the same term that [Supreme Court Justice] Clarence Thomas used when he said he was guilty of a white-collar lynching,\u201d Gingrich said before asking Goldberg and the other hosts to put themselves in Trump\u2019s shoes.\n\n\u201cYou got beaten up for over two years with the Mueller thing. You start to relax,\u201d Gingrich said. \u201cAll of a sudden, there\u2019s this whole new wave of things, and I think part of what you have is a guy here who\u2019s just really deeply frustrated that no matter where he turns, you know, the fight keeps going on.\u201d\n\nGoldberg then forcefully but politely explained why she has a problem with the president describing his current political situation in terms of a violent hate crime.\n\n\u201cListen, Newt, you and I have known each other a long time,\u201d Goldberg said, \u201cand when a giant 6-foot white guy says, \u2018I\u2019m being lynched here,\u2019 you understand why it\u2019s a little bit like, \u2018Listen, man, you\u2019re not being lynched here, you are being held to the standard we\u2019re supposed to be holding every president to.\u2019\u201d\n\nGingrich started to speak about the lynching of nonblack people, but the hosts steered him back to the question of whether Trump\u2019s language was appropriate. He eventually acknowledged the president \u201coften uses words more clumsily than he should\u201d and suggested that he personally wouldn\u2019t have made a \u201clynching\u201d comment.\n\n\u201cNo, look, I\u2019ve been comfortable just calling it a \u2018witch hunt\u2019 and a \u2018kangaroo court\u2019 and things like that, I haven\u2019t gone up to that next level,\u201d he said.\n\nYou can see the complete segment below.\n\nAlso on HuffPost\n\nThat giving your wife \"negotiable assets\" is a terrible mistake.\n\n\u201cI would never buy Ivana any decent jewels or pictures. Why give her negotiable assets?\u201d Trump is quoted as saying of his then-wife in a 1990 Vanity Fair piece.\n\nThat women are essentially aesthetically-pleasing objects.\n\nIn his 2006 book Trump 101: The Way to Success, Trump wrote: \"Beauty and elegance, whether in a woman, a building, or a work of art, is not just superficial or something pretty to see.\"\n\nThat women on The Apprentice need to rely on sex appeal.\n\n\"It's certainly not groundbreaking news that the early victories by the women on 'The Apprentice' were, to a very large extent, dependent on their sex appeal.\" -- How To Get Rich, 2004\n\nThat bad press doesn't matter as long as you have a sexy girlfriend.\n\n\"You know, it doesn't really matter what [the media] write as long as you've got a young and beautiful piece of ass.\" -- from an interview with Esquire, 1991\n\nThat pumping breast milk is \"disgusting.\"\n\nWhen a lawyer facing Trump in 2011 asked for a break to pump breastmilk for her infant daughter, The Donald reacted very poorly. \"He got up, his face got red, he shook his finger at me and he screamed, 'You're disgusting, you're disgusting,' and he ran out of there,\" attorney Elizabeth Beck told CNN. Trump's attorney does not dispute that his client called Beck \"disgusting.\"\n\nThat all women hate prenups, because they are gold diggers.\n\n\u201cThe most difficult aspect of the prenuptial agreement is informing your future wife (or husband): I love you very much, but just in case things don\u2019t work out, this is what you will get in the divorce. There are basically three types of women and reactions. One is the good woman who very much loves her future husband, solely for himself, but refuses to sign the agreement on principle. I fully understand this, but the man should take a pass anyway and find someone else. The other is the calculating woman who refuses to sign the prenuptial agreement because she is expecting to take advantage of the poor, unsuspecting sucker she\u2019s got in her grasp. There is also the woman who will openly and quickly sign a prenuptial agreement in order to make a quick hit and take the money given to her.\u201d --Trump: The Art of the Comeback, 1997\n\nThat women have a \"great act\" going on to trick men.\n\n\u201cWomen have one of the great acts of all time. The smart ones act very feminine and needy, but inside they are real killers. The person who came up with the expression \u2018the weaker sex\u2019 was either very naive or had to be kidding. I have seen women manipulate men with just a twitch of their eye \u2014 or perhaps another body part.\u201d -- Trump: The Art of the Comeback, 1997\n\nThat Hillary would be a bad president because her husband cheated on her.\n\nJust... what?\n\nThat Angelina Jolie has dated too many guys to be attractive.\n\n\u201c[Angelina Jolie\u2019s] been with so many guys she makes me look like a baby... And, I just don\u2019t even find her attractive,\" he said in an interview with Larry King in 2006.\n\nThat the best line in any movie is this beautiful gem.\n\n\u201cMy favorite part [of 'Pulp Fiction'] is when Sam has his gun out in the diner and he tells the guy to tell his girlfriend to shut up. Tell that bitch to be cool. Say: 'Bitch be cool.' I love those lines.\u201d -- TrumpNation: The Art of Being The Donald, 2005\n\nThat a journalist who offended him had an ugly face.\n\nNew York Times columnist Gail Collins recalled: \"During one down period, I referred to him in print as a 'financially embattled thousandaire' and he sent me a copy of the column with my picture circled and 'The Face of a Dog!' written over it.\"\n\nThat women fawn all over him because he is rich and powerful.\n\n\"Love him or hate him, Donald Trump is a man who is certain about what he wants and sets out to get it, no holds barred,\" Trump said about himself one time. \"Women find his power almost as much of a turn-on as his money.\"\n\nThat the ladies on 'The Apprentice' are all super in to him.\n\n\"All of the women on 'The Apprentice' flirted with me -- consciously or unconsciously. That's to be expected.\" -- How To Get Rich, 2004\n\nLove HuffPost?
