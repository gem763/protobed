Sure, numerous players have come and gone through the years, but the culture and philosophy \u2014 the \"Patriot Way\" that draws a blank stare from Belichick whenever mentioned \u2014 have been constants. New England has taken game-planning, scouting, cap management, officials' tendencies and so many other components of their success to levels other franchises can only imagine attaining.\n\nNFL power rankings:Surging Vikings crack top five, while three other teams vault into top 10\n\nJets' Gase unhappy with ESPN:For airing Sam Darnold's 'seeing ghosts' comment\n\nCrash and burn:Who's to blame for Jets' 'embarrassing' performance vs. Patriots?\n\nAll the while, strong leaders like Willie McGinest, Mike Vrabel, Tedy Bruschi, Jerod Mayo and \u2014 now \u2014 Dont'a Hightower, Devin McCourty and Matthew Slater have policed the locker room and coaxed buy-in from key teammates who have stuck around ... meaning Belichick and Brady mostly don't have to.\n\n(And, yes, you skeptics will also note the Patriots are so thoroughly dominant, in part, because they've drilled down into the most arcane elements of the game \u2014 perhaps sometimes wading into grayer margins that may or may not allow for filming other teams or assessing the optimal air pressure of a football ... but let's not digress.)\n\nAnd let's not discount another crucial element: self-scouting.\n\nAlong with stability, it's probably an underrated aspect of success in the NFL \u2014 and one that some teams don't have the luxury of devoting adequate resourcing to as they implement the next coaching staff's schemes or integrate the latest franchise quarterback (just ask New England's Monday night victims, the New York Jets, about such matters).\n\nBut the Patriots know exactly who they are \u2014 it's how they're able to leverage what their players do well while masking their weaknesses. It may also be why they were willing to part with a second-round pick for Atlanta Falcons wideout Mohamed Sanu, a deal USA TODAY Sports confirmed even if Belichick wasn't willing to do the same (yet).\n\nMike Jones:QB Jacoby Brissett proves he's the long-term answer for Colts\n\n32 things we learned:From Week 7 of the 2019 NFL season\n\nOn the surface, a Round 2 selection seems like a lot of cheddar for a 30-year-old receiver who's never 1) caught 70 passes in a season, 2) topped 900 receiving yards or 3) or even scored a half-dozen touchdowns in a single campaign.\n\nBut consider ...\n\n\u25ba Getting a second rounder from the Patriots, which will typically falls around pick No. 60 or later, is more like getting a third rounder from most other teams.\n\n\u25ba New England will routinely flip, say, a Round 3 choice in an upcoming draft to a desperate team for a future second rounder, so it's not like Belichick and Co. struggle to stockpile high-end capital.\n\n\u25ba Sanu is under contract this year for the remainder of his $3.5 million base salary and is owed a modest $6.5 million in 2020, not bad when considering the runaway market that's developed for receivers. (Remember, a fairly pedestrian guy like Cleveland's Jarvis Landry now commands more than $15 million annually.)\n\n\u25ba The Patriots have enjoyed the production of Troy Brown, Wes Welker, Randy Moss and Julian Edelman over the years, but receiver depth is typically an area they struggle to fill. Edelman is flanked by unproven youngsters Jakobi Meyers and Gunner Olszewski and veterans Josh Gordon (currently injured) and Phillip Dorsett \u2014 both come with their own drawbacks \u2014 while hoping first-round rookie N'Keal Harry can come off injured reserve at some point and contribute. But Sanu immediately provides reliability, a highly valued trait by Belichick (Sanu has missed two games in the past seven seasons), steady production and, though he won't be mistaken for Rob Gronkowski, a 6-2, 215-pound build that makes him nearly as big a target as Gordon and Harry.\n\n\u25ba While Sanu isn't a burner, he'll move the chains and operate effectively in the short and intermediate parts of the field \u2014 which is where Brady, who never had a Mahomes-caliber arm anyway \u2014 typically operates anymore.\n\n\u25ba And then there is Sanu's arm, arguably stronger than TB12's, and one that the former high school quarterback has used to launch four NFL touchdown passes. (In fact, Sanu owns a perfect 158.3 career passer rating, completing seven of eight attempts for 233 yards and those four scores.) Think the Patriots \u2014 Belichick loves a good gadget play \u2014 won't leverage that?\n\nFinally, back to that self-awareness, which should also include New England's draft tendencies and success rate (or lack thereof).\n\n\u25ba Since Belichick took over in 2000, New England has drafted the following wideouts in the third round or earlier: Harry, Aaron Dobson, Taylor Price, Brandon Tate, Chad Jackson, Bethel Johnson and Deion Branch, who's obviously been the best of the group.\n\n\u25ba And, not to put too fine a point on it, why not spend on Sanu given how poorly the Patriots' second-round picks under Belichick tend to perform. Want names? Welp, do you remember ... Duke Dawson, Cyrus Jones, Jordan Richards, Dobson, Ras-I Dowling, Jermaine Cunningham, Ron Brace, Darius Butler, Terrence Wheatley, Jackson or Johnson? (Yes, Gronk, Branch, Jimmy Garoppolo, Matt Light and Jamie Collins came in Round 2, but the misses \u2014 especially recently \u2014 outweigh the hits by a fair margin.)\n\nAll things considered, while there might have been initial sticker shock reaction to this transaction, it seems like the proverbial win-win for both sides \u2014 and at a fair price \u2014 assuming, of course, long-ago Patriots staffer and current (for now) Atlanta GM Thomas Dimitroff gets to use his newly acquired pick as part of a rebuild that suddenly seems necessary for the crumbling Falcons.\n\nOf course, no such concerns in Foxborough ...\n\n***\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Nate Davis on Twitter @ByNateDavis", "description": "It may have seemed like New England overpaid for veteran Falcons receiver, but dig a little deeper before rendering judgment.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/10/22/USAT/5c30d260-bfa8-4ecf-a3aa-c5250737fbe7-USATSI_13438290.jpg?crop=1070,1427,x483,y484&width=1070&height=1419&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
