She left the chamber and then came back a few minutes later to try again, only to be interrupted one more time. Again, she left. One lawmaker tossed a placard as Lam was leaving.\n\nFinally, 75 minutes after the previously scheduled start of the lengthy address, Lam delivered it via video link, with China\u2019s yellow-starred red flag to her right and Hong Kong\u2019s flag on her left.\n\nDescribing the semi-autonomous Chinese territory as going through \u201cmajor crisis,\u201d Lam said: \u201cPeople are asking: Will Hong Kong return to normal?\u201d\n\nShe appealed for its 7.5 million citizens to \u201ccherish the city,\u201d warning that \u201ccontinued violence and spread of hatred will erode the core values of Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nShe then launched into a detailed explanation of plans to tackle Hong Kong\u2019s shortage of affordable housing, a long-standing source of discontent.\n\nAt an impromptu news conference outside the chamber after successfully thwarting the address there, lawmakers played a recording on a small loudspeaker they said was the sound of police tear-gassing protesters and of protesters screaming.\n\n\u201cThese are the voices of people screaming and they are just ordinary Hong Kong people,\u201d said lawmaker Tanya Chan. \u201cPlease, please, please Mrs. Carrie Lam, don\u2019t let us suffer any more.\u201d\n\nShe and others called for Lam\u2019s resignation. \u201cThis is the only way that we can have a good future,\u201d said Chan.\n\nLam had been bracing for trouble in the chamber as her government battles the protests that started in June over a contested extradition bill and have snowballed into a sustained anti-government, anti-police and anti-China movement.", "description": "HONG KONG (AP) \u2014 In chaotic scenes, furious pro-democracy lawmakers twice forced Hong Kong's leader to stop delivering a speech laying out her policy", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/15/363c4a_hong-kong-protests-68912-carrie-lam-hong-kong-chief-executive-carrie-lam-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
