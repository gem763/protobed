It\u2019s cruel.", "language": "en", "text": "Let this sink in.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSt. Elizabeths, currently serving 273 patients, takes in people with the most serious and persistent mental illnesses who need intensive inpatient care. It\u2019s where the courts commit people for mental-health evaluations and care.\n\nIt is now where the water supply is contaminated with pseudomonas and legionella bacteria.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time such a water crisis has occurred, City Paper noted.\n\nThree years ago, it said, St. Elizabeths had to cut off its water after a pipe ruptured, contaminating the supply. Patients couldn\u2019t wash their hands from the faucets for five days. They couldn\u2019t drink out of the taps for six days.\n\nAdam Kushner, a surgeon who has studied hospitals in developing countries, told City Paper that when patients and staff are not able to keep themselves or the linens as clean as usual, it can lead to hospital-contracted infections. One such infection, MRSA, killed 20,000 people in the United States in 2017.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cNot having any running water is horrible. Can anyone imagine Johns Hopkins or Mass General not having water?\u201d Kushner told City Paper. \u201cMaybe for a day. But then it happening again? It just wouldn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nBut it happened in the District. And it\u2019s going to happen again, because the problem isn\u2019t being permanently fixed. That\u2019s neglect. When the victims are some of the most dependent people in our society \u2014 people with mental illness \u2014 it\u2019s cruel.\n\nIt simply doesn\u2019t have to be this way.\n\nThe city can\u2019t cry poor-mouth, pleading a lack of money as a defense for allowing this outrageous condition to exist.\n\nIt\u2019s not a lack of cash; it\u2019s lack of concern and compassion.\n\nAD\n\nThe city has the money.\n\nHere\u2019s how I know.\n\nThe D.C. public school system, because of poor management and internal controls, found itself facing a $23 million budget shortfall earlier in the year. School leaders said not to worry because they planned to end the fiscal year with a balanced budget.\n\nAD\n\nThat promise was as off the mark as the budget projections that officials asked the D.C. Council to approve. With the fiscal year ending on Sept. 30, the school\u2019s budget hole stood at $10.1 million.\n\nTo balance the budget, Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) robbed Peter to pay Paul. Aided by the city\u2019s chief financial officer, Jeffrey S. Dewitt, Bowser shifted funds to the school system from other city agencies.\n\nAD\n\nOh, the District\u2019s got money. Enough money to fix St. Elizabeths\u2019 pipes, to keep bacteria out of the hospital\u2019s water supply.\n\nPatients are distressed because there\u2019s no running water to wash their hands after using the bathroom; miserable not being able to use the showers. But they have to wait while, as Jones told City Paper, St. Elizabeths works \u201cwith D.C. Water and D.C. Health to evaluate options and solutions.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTo hell with that. Fix the damn problem.\n\nThe District has the money to do it.\n\nHow do I know? The mayor told me so.\n\nIt\u2019s right there in a \u201cLetter from the Mayor\u201d dated Oct. 3.\n\nBowser said with the start of the new fiscal year on Oct. 1, she is going to spend \u201c$2.5 million to ensure every resident is counted in the 2020 Census.\u201d Money is going to be distributed to a select number of community groups to get the word out. Cynics might call it \u201cwalkin\u2019 around money.\u201d But I\u2019m not a cynic.\n\nAD\n\nShe said she is also going to shell out $2.5 million for the Immigrant Justice Legal Services grant program to help fend off anti-immigration forces.\n\nMoney, we got.\n\nEnough, according to Bowser, to spend \u201c$4.7 million for hiring a new bike lane parking enforcement team and other improvements as part of Vision Zero\u201d \u2014 a plan to shore up pedestrian and bicycle transportation safety.\n\nAs for making and keeping St. Elizabeths\u2019 water permanently safe \u2014 well, the vulnerable and dependent patients are just going to have to wait until the city finishes evaluating \u201coptions and solutions.\u201d\n\nNeglect to the point of cruelty.\n\nRead more from Colbert King\u2019s archive.\n\nAD", "description": "St. Elizabeths has been operating without running water due to contamination.", "authors": ["Colbert I.
