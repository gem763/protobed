It\u2019s Been a Wild Five Days for Michael Flynn", "language": "en", "text": "National Security Adviser Michael Flynn arrives in the east Room of the White House in Washington, Monday, Feb. 13, 2017, for a news conference with President Donald Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. . (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)\n\nOn Monday, U.S. District Court Judge Emmet Sullivan, who is presiding over the General Michael Flynn case, cancelled a hearing scheduled for November 5th. He issued a statement which said, \u201cIn view of the parties\u2019 comprehensive briefing concerning 109 Defendant\u2019s Motion to Compel Production of Brady Material, the Court cancels the motion hearing previously scheduled for November 5, 2019.\u201d\n\nSullivan is referring to the bombshell court filing submitted last Thursday by Flynn\u2019s new legal team which is led by Sidney Powell.\n\nIn the filing, Powell accuses high ranking FBI officials of orchestrating an ambush-interview on Michael Flynn, \u201cnot for the purpose of discovering any evidence of criminal activity \u2013 they already had tapes of all the relevant conversations about which they questioned Mr. Flynn \u2013 but for the purposes of trapping him into making statement they could allege as false.\u201d\n\nI posted about this in detail on Saturday here. Powell alleges that then-FBI lawyer Lisa Page and others manipulated the original 302 report. The filing claims that Peter Strzok, the lead agent on the case, suggested using news of the Steele Dossier as a \u201cpretext to go interview people.\u201d It shows that the FBI tried not to give General Flynn the impression they were interviewing him for a criminal matter. The filing also alleges that former DNI James Clapper, who will be interviewed soon by John Durham, alerted Washington Post writer David Ignatius to publish an article about Flynn\u2019s conversation with then-Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Powell has requested that the DOJ hand over a list of documents which may potentially contain exculpatory information, otherwise known as Brady Material. Finally, she asks for the judge to dismiss the charges against Flynn.\n\nPowerline\u2019s John Hinderaker, a lawyer, weighed in on the filing over the weekend. He wrote:\n\nThe Flynn prosecution has lifted the lid on corruption at the Department of Justice and the FBI that few could have imagined. The anti-Trump FBI conducted itself in a way we might associate with a totalitarian state, not the United States of America. For the most part, the people involved have been fired in disgrace. I am no expert in criminal law, but it seems that some of what happened here\u2013for example, the falsification of the Form 302\u2013must be a crime. If crimes were committed, they should be prosecuted. The prosecution of General Flynn should be dismissed, and those involved in it should be, if not prosecuted, censured.\n\nHinderaker\u2019s colleague at Powerline, Paul Mirengoff, is also a lawyer. He explains in laymen\u2019s terms that Judge Sullivan\u2019s cancellation statement means \u201che has all the argumentation he needs to rule on this motion.\u201d\n\nHe wrote:\n\nThe cancellation of oral argument tells us that Judge Sullivan is ready to rule, but not what his ruling will be. I understand, though, that Gen. Flynn\u2019s legal team considers today\u2019s order by Sullivan good news. It\u2019s comprehensive discussion of prosecutorial abuse in this matter stands unrebutted.\n\nWhat a difference a day makes. On Tuesday, the prosecutors shot back at the Flynn team. The prosecutors in this case are the group of DOJ attorneys, led by U.S. Attorney Jessie Liu, who are tasked with completing the work of the Special Counsel. Apparently unamused by Powell\u2019s powerful punch last week, they submitted a pair of filings with the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C. They blasted Flynn\u2019s \u201cextraordinary\u201d new allegations. These filings can be viewed here and here.\n\nOne item that Powell demanded were the two cell phones used by Joseph Mifsud in 2016 which were recently obtained by John Durham. The prosecutors wrote that the material contained on Mifsud\u2019s phones is \u201cnot favorable\u201d to Flynn \u201cor relevant to his case.\u201d\n\nThey excoriated Flynn for claiming to be the victim of an ambush by FBI officials. They wrote: \u201cIn an extraordinary reversal, the defendant now claims that he is innocent of the criminal charge in this case\u2026he makes this claim despite having admitted his guilt, under oath, before two federal judges (including this Court).\u201d\n\nProsecutors also wrote that every new charge contained in Powell\u2019s brief is \u201cunsupported by law or fact.\u201d\n\nPrior to Sullivan\u2019s motion to cancel the next hearing (which apparently does mean what Mirengoff told us it means, that the judge has all the information he needs to rule), they were prepared to file a detailed rebuttal to the Flynn team filing. But, now that he has done so, \u201cthey want to make sure he plans to dismiss the new allegations, or offer prosecutors a chance to respond before he rules.\u201d\n\nThe prosecutors make several references to the Mueller report. \u2018If you look at page such and such in the Mueller report.\u2019 My guess is that the Judge knows better than to rely on information from such a highly partisan document.\n\nI found Powell\u2019s evidence to be extremely convincing and well-documented. The ball is in Judge Sullivan\u2019s court right now. He can decide to offer prosecutors time to prepare a detailed rebuttal or he can issue a ruling. Although Powell\u2019s new filing requests additional Brady Material from the government, her team has been requesting most of this material for a long time and DOJ officials have refused to provide it.\n\nOne thing is for sure. The prosecutors, who have been accused of serious wrongdoing, will not go down without a fight.", "description": "Whiplash!
