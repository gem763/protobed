Dozens of other high-profile gymnasts, including Aly Raisman, Gabby Douglas and McKayla Maroney, all former Olympic gold medalists, also accused him of abuse.\n\nHe was sentenced last year to 40 to 175 years in jail in just one case, but was also sentenced to jail for possession of child pornography.\n\nThe case has prompted firings, resignations and changes across the U.S. Olympic Committee and safeguards such as SafeSport.", "description": "It currently has 1,290 open cases, with 2,237 that have been closed since its inception in March 2017.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/Safesport-ceo-mo_hpMain_20190917-225245_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
