The assailant, freshman athlete Brock Turner, was convicted of three felony sex crimes but drew national outrage for serving only three months in jail.\n\nNow, with the release of a new book, \"Know My Name,\" and an interview with \"60 Minutes,\" Chanel Miller is reclaiming her story\u2014and her identity.\n\n\n\nIn unaired clips from her interview with \"60 Minutes\" correspondent Bill Whitaker, Miller talked about her attempts to separate herself from \"Emily Doe,\" and why she thinks that when it comes to cases of sexual assault, the judicial system is not equipped to find the truth.\n\nFilming the \"60 Minutes\" report also gave Miller an opportunity she had been waiting for: More than four years after that fateful January night, she finally met Peter Jonsson and Carl Arndt, the Swedish graduate students who stopped Turner's assault and held him down until police arrived.\n\n\"That's not me. That's not Chanel.\"\n\nChanel Miller on separating herself from \"Emily Doe\"\n\nChanel Miller first learned the details of her sexual assault by reading about it in the news. Ten days after the assault, press accounts published lurid details obtained from the police report about a female sexual assault victim found in a state of undress: her skirt was hiked up around her waist, her underwear had been removed, and her bra was half pulled out of the top of her dress. Though articles never named Miller, the words \"Stanford,\" \"rape,\" and \"unconscious intoxicated woman\" leapt off the page. She realized she was the unnamed woman who had been assaulted.\n\nMiller told Whitaker she felt she had lost all of her privacy except her name. She came to see \"Emily Doe,\" an alias used to protect her identity, as a different person altogether.\n\n\"She's this abstract entity who belongs to the case,\" Miller told Whitaker in the video above. \"And I thought, 'That's not me. That's not Chanel.'\"\n\nBut compartmentalizing her trauma proved to be too much.\n\n\"It's a very fragmented way of living, and I thought I could do it,\" she said. \"But I quickly realized it's not sustainable.\"\n\n\"We interrogate the victim and go after her character\"\n\n\n\nChanel Miller: The trial was not about truth\n\nMiller told Whitaker she became dismayed with the judicial system as the case worked its way through court proceedings.\n\nThat feeling intensified when she had to testify in court.\n\n\"Instead of investigating the crime that's at hand, we interrogate the victim and go after her character and pick her apart and openly defile and debase her\u2026\" Miller said. \"Nobody can say, 'That's enough.' I can't say, 'Don't talk to me like that.'\"\n\nMiller went on to recall how she answered all the questions she was asked and tried to maintain control of her emotions\u2014until she was asked about waking up in the hospital after the assault.\n\n\n\n\"It's like the lights would go out in my head,\" she said. \"I would lose complete control, begin sobbing.\"\n\nChanel meets the Swedish grad students\n\n\n\nChanel Miller meets the men who stopped her assault\n\nOn that January night in 2015, Swedish graduate students Peter Jonsson and Carl Arndt were biking on Stanford's campus when they saw Turner on top of a woman who was not moving. They stopped him, chased him down, and then held him until police arrived.\n\n\"They changed the story,\" Miller told Whitaker on the broadcast. \"They changed the entire trajectory of my life.\"\n\nMore than four years later, while filming for \"60 Minutes,\" Miller was finally able to meet the two men who rescued her.\n\n\"I kept saying thank you,\" Miller recalled, \"and they kept saying that helping the world is thanks enough.\"\n\nMiller added she was particularly struck when Jonsson revealed that he had continued to inquire about her well-being long after the assault. Jonsson and Arndt later told Whitaker meeting Miller was like meeting family.\n\n\n\n\"It meant a lot that they cared so much throughout the entire process,\" Miller said.\n\n\n\nTo watch Bill Whitaker's 60 Minutes interview with Chanel Miller, click here.\n\nThe videos above were edited by Sarah Shafer Prediger.", "description": "The sexual assault survivor also tells \"60 Minutes\" why she thinks the legal system picks apart victims like her, rather than finding the truth", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/22/ddefca32-2a9f-4561-8a19-612061a5b9e5/thumbnail/1200x630/a5e4fcc67f1c55bfa665f23bd2e63508/ot-chanel3meetingswedesfd.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
