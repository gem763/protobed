She also dropped a few secrets about her \u201chard\u201d marriage to Justin Bieber, a year after the two secretly tied the knot.\n\nBaldwin, who\u2019s been intersecting with members of the KarJenner coven for some time now, has been journeying on her own path to self-acceptance, much like her pop star husband, and talked about how she often feels \u201cinferior\u201d to her modeling contemporaries.\n\n\u201cMy burn in the modelling industry has been slow and I\u2019ve had to learn to be okay with that,\u201d she explained. \u201cI\u2019m shorter than most of the girls. Even though I\u2019m five-foot-eight, I\u2019m not a runway girl and I totally used to feel inferior to some of my friends.\u201d\n\nVogue\n\n\u201cLook at Kendall [Jenner] and Bells [Bella Hadid] and Gigi [Hadid] \u2026 they\u2019re all tall and doing every runway,\u201d Baldwin continued, noting that casting directors never believed she\u2019d be a \u201creal model\u201d because of her height.\n\nBaldwin said she eventually \u201cfound my own lane,\u201d which she described as more commercial than the Jenners and Hadids of the world.\n\n\u201cYou can make it work and not have to do runway, and I\u2019ve done a good job with that,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m proud of myself for building a more commercial career that worked for me and being confident about it.\u201d\n\nBaldwin, 22, also touched on comments she made previously about difficulties in her marriage, and revealed what makes the couple\u2019s relationship work, even when the world is rooting for their downfall.\n\n\u201cLook, marriage is always going to be hard and I think good relationships are the relationships that you put the work into,\u201d she told the magazine, explaining that she and Bieber encountered \u201ca lot of new things\u201d as a couple that initially strained their relationship.\n\n\u201cI had never lived with someone before. I never had to cohabit with somebody in that way, so I was learning how to share space with someone for the first time,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were trying to bend in each other\u2019s direction and learn what was comfortable.\u201d\n\n\u201cCompromise\u201d the way Baldwin sees it, is the trick to a healthy marriage, which she said is at its strongest when the two are out of the public eye and living together privately in Bieber\u2019s native Canada.\n\n\u201cNow it\u2019s easier because we\u2019ve found a rhythm,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have more fun together, which is what should happen when you spend more time with someone you love.\u201d\n\nBieber recently opened up about his mental health struggles stemming from early childhood fame in an Instagram essay, revealing that he had abused \u201cheavy drugs\u201d and was \u201cdisrespectful to women\u201d\n\n\u201cI made every bad decision you could have thought of and went from one of the most loved and adored people in the world to the most ridiculed, judged and hated person in the world,\u201d Bieber wrote. But married life, wrote Bieber, helped him through these dark times, teaching him \u201ccommitment, kindness, humility, and all of the things it looks like to be a good man.\u201d\n\nRead Baldwin\u2019s full interview at Vogue Australia.", "description": "Baldwin opened up about competing with modeling industry pals like Jenner and the Hadid sisters, and navigating a \"hard\" marriage to Justin Bieber.", "authors": ["Entertainment Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7f9e0023000010055519cd.jpeg?cache=9flrgkf2jz&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
