'I just did it as a favor. I showed up, sat down, ate dinner and left. I didn't really speak to anybody because they spoke in a different language,'\n\nRubino added that it was only later that he learned the Ukrainians at the meeting were members of Zelenskiy's team.\n\nFormer Trump campaign advisor Mike Rubino, Matt Mowers (right), who worked for the State Department, and Sean Spicer (left) were present\n\nSpicer said he his appearance was brief and added that he was introduced to a member of Zelenskiy's campaign but did not know if it was their organization's leader.\n\n'They introduced me to the campaign guy,' Spicer said in an interview. 'I had every impression that they [Signal] were trying to impress this client.'\n\nA spokesman for Signal told CNBC that there was no discussion about investigating the Bidens at any of their April meetings with Zelenskiy's advisors.\n\n'Signal Group facilitated a number of meetings for Mr. Cohen and the Servant of the People campaign in Washington,' John Procter, the firm's spokesman, said in a statement. 'At no time during the delegation's April visit was there any mention of an investigation of the Biden family or any related topic.'", "description": "Former senior officials in the Trump administration met with the Ukrainian president's top advisors on April 16.
