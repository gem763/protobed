That\u2019s the truth! I\u2019m telling you.\u201d\n\nThe Trump comment was surreptitiously recorded by a Police Department colleague just months before the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThe recording was played in court last week by prosecutors in an effort to show that the alleged attack in September 2016 by the former chief on a guest \u2014 an 18-year-old black man \u2014 at a Ramada Hotel in Bordentown, New Jersey, was motivated by Nucera\u2019s \u201cintense racial animus.\u201d\n\nIn 2015, Nucera had told a colleague that African Americans were \u201clike ISIS, they have no value,\u201d according to a criminal complaint filed in U.S. District Court in New Jersey. \u201cThey should line them all up and mow \u2019em down,\u201d he said, according to the complaint.\n\nNucera\u2019s lawyer, Rocco Cipparone, said that his client did not commit a hate crime, although he acknowledged that Nucera made the Trump remark and has used \u201cinappropriate language, including derogatory racial terms\u201d in the past.\n\n\u201cThese are embarrassing, ugly words, but if Frank Nucera did not strike this man, then the words are equally irrelevant,\u201d Cipparone said. \u201cIt is not a crime, even for a police officer, to use that language. It\u2019s not socially acceptable, it\u2019s not appropriate, but it\u2019s not criminal.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump gestures towards members on the media on the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, Thursday, Sept. 26, 2019, after returning from United Nations General Assembly.

Aside from the hate crime charge, Nucera is charged with depriving a suspect\u2019s rights and making false statements to the FBI, according to the criminal complaint.\n\nIf convicted, Nucera faces up to 20 years in prison.\n\nOn Tuesday, prosecutors rested their case, and Nucera told the judge that he would not take the stand. A verdict in the three-week trial could come this week.\n\nAccording to court papers, a manager at the hotel had called the police to report that two guests \u2014 the 18 year-old man and a 16-year-old girl, who is also black \u2014 who did not pay for their room the night before were swimming in the hotel pool. When the police arrived, according to court papers, the girl, who was not identified because she is a minor, and the man, identified at trial as Timothy Stroye, resisted arrest.\n\nStroye was eventually handcuffed, the complaint said, and an officer began walking him to a police car. Nucera then approached them from behind and pushed Stroye\u2019s head into a metal doorjamb that separated the hallway from the stairwell at the hotel.\n\nHours later, Nucera, using a racial slur, suggested to a colleague, who was recording the conversation, that Stroye and the girl were from Trenton, according to the complaint. Bordentown, which is about a 15-minute drive south of Trenton, has about 12,000 residents, most of whom are white, census data shows. The nearly 84,000 residents in Trenton are mostly black.\n\nStroye could not be reached for comment.\n\nMichael Theokas, a spokesman for Bordentown Township, would not say whether Nucera had been disciplined by the Police Department as a result of his actions on that night.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.\n\n\u00a9 2019 The New York Times Company", "description": "A former police chief in New Jersey who is on trial on a federal hate-crime charge after he allegedly slammed a black teenager's head into a doorjamb, once called President Donald Trump \"the last hope for white people,\" according to a recording recently played for jurors.In the 2016 recording", "authors": ["Andrea Salcedo"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5SVtNvtaFFfhfiJIgEUoaw--~B/aD0zMjY0O3c9NDg5NjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/29f668b0-e118-11e9-9f7b-53c45de21c2b"}
