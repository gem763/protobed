The president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, who successfully fought the powerful tobacco lobby in the late 1990s, is worried that the progress he and other health advocates have made over the past two decades is being eroded amid the rise of smokeless tobacco and flavored e-cigarettes.\n\n\u201cThe tobacco industry today continues to do what it has always done, which is to prevent the government from taking the action that everyone knows is necessary to protect the public,\u201d Myers said during a recent interview with The Hill.\n\n\u201cIts rhetoric has always been one of an industry that cares about the health of effects of consumers \u2026 even while its actions do the exact opposite,\u201d he added.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMyers helped start the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids in 1996 and has been its president since 2000. The public health group works to reduce tobacco use and highlight its consequences in the United States and around the world.\n\nServing as an adviser to state attorneys general, Myers helped with negotiations that led to the landmark 1998 tobacco master settlement between 46 states, the District of Columbia and the five largest tobacco companies.\n\nThe 25-year, $246 billion agreement was the largest civil settlement in U.S. history. It forbade tobacco companies from directly advertising to children, among many other forms of advertising.\n\nThe settlement helped \u201cchange the world,\u201d Myers said.\n\n\u201cPeople now recognize that the industry deliberately misled us about the health effects of its products, and deliberately undertook a decades-long campaign to prevent the government from acting,\u201d he said.\n\nBut now Myers says the settlement also failed to \u201cfundamentally change\u201d the behavior of tobacco companies.\n\nHe said Congress, the administration and public health advocates all need to work together to keep the industry in check.\n\nOne of the indirect outcomes of the master settlement was the 2009 Tobacco Control Act, which gave the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) the ability to regulate all tobacco products.\n\nThat legislation \u201cwas truly the result of a decade of slow, persistent work building a bipartisan coalition to support it,\u201d Myers said. \u201cIn the atmosphere that exists today, that\u2019s hard to believe, but it passed the Senate with 85 votes and [conservative] members like [Texas Sen.] John Cornyn John CornynGOP braces for impeachment brawl Overnight Health Care \u2014 Presented by Coalition Against Surprise Medical Billing \u2014 Judge blocks Trump 'public charge' rule | Appeals court skeptical of Trump arguments for Medicaid work requirements | CDC offers guidance for treating vaping-related cases GOP requests update on criminal referrals prompted by 2018 Kavanaugh probe MORE helped lead the charge.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut in the two decades since the Tobacco Control Act was passed, new products such as e-cigarettes have flourished in a largely unregulated marketplace.\n\nMyers said the FDA failed to act to protect young people from getting addicted, and the public has suffered for it.\n\n\u201cMany of us had hoped that e-cigarette companies would behave differently, but in the absence of the government exercising its regulatory authority, we\u2019ve learned they have behaved exactly as the tobacco companies, with truly unfortunate consequences,\u201d he said.\n\nYouth use of e-cigarettes has skyrocketed in the past year, driven largely by teenage customers and readily available sweet and fruit-flavored pods.\n\nFederal statistics showed a 78 percent increase in e-cigarette use among high school students from 2017-18, and the FDA said preliminary data showed that number jumped again this year.\n\nThe most recent survey from the National Institute on Drug Abuse, released in September, showed the percentage of teenagers who are vaping has doubled in the past two years, with 25 percent of high school seniors using an e-cigarette in the past month.\n\nActing FDA Commissioner Ned Sharpless acknowledged during a congressional hearing last month that the agency should have acted sooner to stop the youth epidemic. \u201cBut we\u2019re going to catch up,\u201d he vowed.\n\nMyers said the agency can\u2019t act soon enough.\n\n\u201cFDA took five years to assert jurisdiction [on e-cigarettes]. That is unacceptable by any definition. Had it acted in 2012 or 2015, we\u2019d be in a very different position.\u201d\n\nWhen the Trump administration took over in 2017, then-FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb enacted a plan to reduce nicotine levels in traditional cigarettes. He had hoped e-cigarettes could be a tool to help people quit.\n\nBut Myers said there\u2019s no proof that e-cigarettes are safe, and there has been no reliable data indicating they can help people quit. Companies have been allowed to sell their products without providing any \u201csound scientific evidence\u201d behind their marketing claims, Myers said.\n\nThe FDA has tried to assert its influence over e-cigarette and tobacco companies in the past, but Myers said industry lobbying convinced political officials not to enact some of the harshest measures, such as a flavor ban.\n\nEven now, as more teenagers are getting addicted to e-cigarettes and the administration is trying to find ways to crack down, the industry is fighting back hard.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s one of the reasons why FDA was so slow to act to address the issues of e-cigarettes, and one of the reasons the issue has become more partisan in Congress than it has traditionally been,\u201d Myers said, adding that further action is needed from lawmakers as well.\n\n\u201cWe need FDA to use the authority it was given ... but it\u2019s also a mistake to think full responsibility lies just with FDA,\u201d Myers said.\n\n\u201cCongress needs to raise tobacco taxes, close the loophole for online sales and needs to ensure the e-cigarette industry is no longer allowed to market the kinds of flavors that led to this epidemic.\u201d\n\nIn a move long sought by advocates, Congress does look likely to raise the legal smoking age to 21, and some lawmakers want much more.\n\nLast year, the Trump administration said it would require retailers to physically separate e-cigarettes from the rest of the store. While not as strong as a complete ban on selling the products, the move was still opposed by conservatives and small business groups.\n\nLast month, faced with new figures showing the teen vaping epidemic has not slowed, President Trump Donald John TrumpBusiness school deans call for lifting country-specific visa caps Bolton told ex-Trump aide to call White House lawyers about Ukraine pressure campaign: report Federal prosecutors in New York examining Giuliani business dealings with Ukraine: report MORE said he was instituting a total ban on all e-cigarette flavors except tobacco until the companies can clear FDA\u2019s strict new regulatory requirements.\n\nMyers praised the administration\u2019s move, even though it has yet to be implemented.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s an extraordinarily smart policy. Before the introduction of Juul, the most popular flavor was tobacco. If one is concerned about youth use of e-cigarettes, tackling the flavor issue is a priority,\u201d Myers said. \u201cIf industry has evidence that a particular flavor helps smokers quit, there\u2019s a pathway through FDA to evaluate that.\u201d", "description": "Matthew Myers still doesn\u2019t trust the tobacco industry.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/myersmatthew_101419handout.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
