Plus Prof Liz Bentley of the Royal Meteorological Society on the destructive force of Hurricane Dorian, which has been battering the Bahamas and is heading for the US\n\nIt\u2019s another crunch week in parliament. As MPs return to Westminster after the summer recess, they will find themselves faced with potentially life-changing decisions to make \u2013 for the country, their parties and their political careers. The stakes could barely be higher as Boris Johnson and his team use every trick in the book, including suspending parliament, threatening colleagues with deselection and pushing for an early election, to try to enforce their headline promise: for Britain to leave the EU by 31 October.\n\nAnushka Asthana is joined by the Guardian\u2019s political columnist Jonathan Freedland to join the dots in an incredibly complex puzzle. Will Labour vote to bring down the government and force an early election rather than risking a no-deal Brexit? Will Tories opposed to no deal put their principles before their careers? And what does it all look like from Brussels?\n\nAlso today: Prof Liz Bentley, the chief executive of the Royal Meteorological Society, on the destructive force of Hurricane Dorian, which has battered the Bahamas and is on course to hit the US states of Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina.", "description": "Jonathan Freedland joins Anushka Asthana to discuss a pivotal week ahead in British politics.
