Even more so now that flying has become such a burden.\n\nTravelling under your own steam on one of the world's epic road adventures leaves you in charge of the schedule \u2014 stopping to soak up a great view, or checking in to a gorgeous guest house that you may never pass again.\n\nMany memorable road trips are a perfect blend of inspiring landscapes, a convivial driving companion and a never-ending highway that twists and turns to the horizon.\n\nThe Wild Atlantic Way is an epic route that wriggles madly around Ireland's wild west coast. Pictured is Mayo, a county on the route\n\nPlanning a grand tour dates back to the golden age of travel. These days it's much easier to follow in the tyre marks of others, thanks to the internet. But wherever you set as the destination in your satnav, always leave time to get off the road and explore.\n\nAs Jack Kerouac put it in On The Road: 'Nothing behind me, everything ahead of me, as is ever so on the road. There was nowhere to go but everywhere, so just keep on rolling under the stars . . .'\n\nI've just returned from driving Ireland's spectacular Wild Atlantic Way (WAW).\n\nLaunched in 2014, this epic route wriggles madly around Ireland's wild west coast from quaint Kinsale in the south to Malin Head in the north. The 1,500-mile trek is one of the world's greatest drives. As Atlantic breakers crash along Galway Bay beyond, two men are kneeling by the roadside and causing a traffic jam.\n\nThe Daily Mail's Jeremy Taylor says the 1,500-mile trek is one of the world's greatest drives. Pictured is Slea Head\n\nPadraig and Eoin are expert road bowlers \u2014 a sport that involves hurling a 2lb metal ball for miles along a country lane, with the winner making the least throws over a set distance. There seems to be a story at every turn on this panoramic route amid archipelagos and inlets. Dramatic cliffs, surf waves and characters, as well as kamikaze sheep and never-ending rainbows.\n\nA few miles around the coast is the arty town of Roundstone, a straddle of pubs, cafes and galleries blended together by the sweet smell of a peat fire on a brisk westerly. O'Dowd's bar has set up outdoor tables. A local tells me the WAW lures people off the main tourism routes to explore towns and villages rarely ventured. So, instead of stopping at Clifden \u2014 the self-proclaimed capital of Connemara \u2014 he points me towards Omey Island while the tide is out.\n\nForty minutes later I understand why. The tiny island off Claddaghduff is only accessible across a rugged causeway of sand.\n\nPascal Whelan was a professional stuntman who had a stellar career in Hollywood but ended up here. He worked on set with Paul Hogan in Crocodile Dundee and taught Peter O'Toole how to sword fight. Whelan spent his last years living in a mobile home on Omey, growing vegetables and entertaining guests with tales of the island.\n\nThe serene Lough Corrib, pictured, which is close to Ashford Castle in County Mayo\n\nTRAVEL FACTS A ferry to Ireland with StenaLine costs from \u00a3190 return (stenaline.co.uk). For more information visit ashfordcastle.com and wildatlanticway.com\n\nFurther north, Paddy Coyne's pub in Tully Cross serves muscles and crab claws. It would be tempting to doze off over a pint in St Ann's snug.\n\nInstead, I'm heading due east via Leenane \u2014 film location for John Hurt and Richard Harris's powerful drama The Field \u2014 to another famous film set in Cong. John Wayne was best known as a swaggering cowboy, but in 1951 he visited west Ireland. The Quiet Man was a tale of an American-made-good, returning home to his Celtic roots only to fall for actress Maureen O'Hara's terrible 'Oirish' accent.\n\nWayne stayed at Ashford Castle, on the shores of nearby Lough Corrib. The 800-year-old mansion is the former ancestral home of the Guinness family.\n\nThe castle's lodge is the 'newer' bit, tucked away by the waterside on the 350-acre estate. There's a country house vibe and the styling's more contemporary.\n\nUpstairs, make sure to ask for a lough view in Wilde's restaurant and the scallop starter is legendary. Time to reflect on one of the world's greatest road adventures.\n\nAnd here are 10 other epic road trips from around the world...\n\nSpanish sunshine\n\nThe route from the Costa del Sol to the sun-soaked hills of Andalucia runs through the stunning Parque Natural Los Alcornocales, pictured\n\nThe sun-soaked hills of Andalucia are a stone\u2019s throw from the Costa del Sol but a world apart.
