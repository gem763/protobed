That would be $2 trillion less than if we let the system operate as it currently does. However, Mercatus researchers doubt that the Sanders\u2019s plan would ultimately save trillions because they believe Congress would have to increase Medicare rates paid to hospitals and physicians to get the legislation enacted. They may be right \u2014 or wrong. But that is a different argument \u2014 a prediction about the politics of enacting laws \u2014 than that Medicare for All would inherently increase total health care spending.\n\nWe have our doubts about Medicare for All. But unaffordability is not a reason to oppose it. Whether it\u2019s our current arrangement or a future Medicare for All, the per capita cost of our health care system already far exceeds that of any other industrialized country \u2014 including those with single-payer systems. When you hear a health care price tag in the trillions, know that the existing system has already brought us there.\n\nFallacy No. 3: Insurance companies\u2019 profits drive health care costs.\n\nIn the second Democratic presidential debate, Senator Bernie Sanders declared that the health care industry makes $100 billion in profits. He once railed against the insurance company Anthem for denying a claim while noting that it reported \u201cfourth-quarter profits for 2017 had increased by 234 percent to $1.2 billion.\u201d\n\nMany Americans believe that profits have no place in health care. They see for-profit health insurance, like buying and selling kidneys and livers for transplantation, as what the Nobel Prize winner Alvin Roth termed a \u201crepugnant industry\u201d \u2014 something that should not be exchanged in the market.\n\nThat is an important moral stand, but it makes no difference to the claim that eliminating for-profit insurers will reduce high health care costs. The fact is, we could eliminate those profits and it would hardly matter to the cost of health care. You would not notice it in your premiums.\n\nFor the eight largest for-profit health insurance companies, in 2016, their cumulative revenue amounted to nearly $452.2 billion and profits were $22.1 billion, for a profit margin of about 5 percent. By contrast, technology companies, banks and major drug companies generally make more than 20 percent profit.\n\nTrue, $22.1 billion is a lot of money \u2014 but it is 0.6 percent of health spending. And last year alone health care costs increased over $130 billion \u2014 six times insurance company profits. Health care spending would not be significantly cheaper if all insurance companies\u2019 profits were zero.", "description": "Yes, it\u2019s a complicated issue.
