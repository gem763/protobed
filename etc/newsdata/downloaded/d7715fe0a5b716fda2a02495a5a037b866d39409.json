(BIDU): $101 from $269, March 11, 2018\n\nBig Momentum Names\n\nThe big underreported story continues to be the breakdown of big momentum names that carried the stock market for last few years.\n\nIt\u2019s sort of ironic considering all the hype on the way higher. I think these names are oversold but they still look vulnerable near term.", "description": "The market remains cautious this morning after the administration offered .10/01/2019 11:19:36AM EST.", "authors": ["Charles Payne", "Cortney O'Brien", "Leah Barkoukis", "Timothy Meads", "Julio Rosas", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/306/c934caf1-cad5-46eb-900e-6228d8a6ff2e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
