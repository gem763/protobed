The injunction meant that even though the provisions remained in effect, the Obama administration could not sue a hospital or provider for not complying.\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s Department of Health and Human Services initially defended the rule, but the Trump administration decided to drop its defense and argued the rule should be sent back to the agency to be rewritten.\n\nThe Trump administration is working on a regulatory fix and has issued a proposed rule that would scrap ObamaCare's definition of \"sex discrimination\" to remove protections for gender identity.\n\nAdvocates argue removing those protections will allow health care providers, hospitals and insurers to discriminate against transgender patients.", "description": "A federal judge on Tuesday overturned ObamaCare protections for transgender patients, ruling that a 2016 policy violates the religious freedom of Christian providers.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/transgenderrightsprotest_102318getty_1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
