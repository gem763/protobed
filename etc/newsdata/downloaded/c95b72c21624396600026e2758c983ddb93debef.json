Simon makes some sage observations about the proper conduct of foreign policy among great powers in general and, in particular, about the behavior of President Trump with respect to this important arena of human endeavor.\n\nRoger\u2019s first point has two parts, a strophe, as it were, and an antistrophe.\n\nThe strophe involves a patent moral dimension. We should not conceal\u2014from others or from ourselves\u2014the moral caliber of the leaders with whom we deal. Besides the United States, the world\u2019s only other colossus is China. Not only does it preside over the second largest economy in the world, it is also eagerly and aggressively arming itself and asserting its prerogatives throughout Asia and, increasingly, throughout the world.\n\nMoreover, China has a dismal human rights record, a fact that is daily bruited about the Western world by reports of China\u2019s savage treatment of the Uyghurs, for example, their efforts to create a surveillance state by imposing a system of \u201csocial credit\u201d on its citizens, and its militant treatment of the protestors in Hong Kong.\n\nLast week\u2019s flood of stories about the craven behavior of the National Basketball Association, Nike, Apple, and other American business interests that talk woke but act like hypocrites when their bottom line is threatened has simply reinforced what we all knew about those horrible people (I mean those running Apple, Nike, etc.) They wear bluejeans and eschew ties, they talk about love and \u201csaving the environment,\u201d but they instantly kowtow to tyrannical hegemons the moment it will aid their balance sheet.\n\nRoger\u2019s antistrophe is itself in two parts. The first acknowledges all that I\u2019ve just said\u2014China is a Communist tyranny, it treats its people horribly, it is a threat to world peace and stability. The second part begins with a big fat but. \u201cBut,\u201d says Roger, \u201cit\u2019s the most populous country in the world and, even though it brutally oppresses its minorities, not to mention the democracy protestors, many views, submerged as they may be, exist among its people, even among the Communist Party leadership. (Look up Lin Biao, if you don\u2019t believe me.) Xi is the maximum leader for life\u2014until he isn\u2019t.\u201d That codicil \u201cuntil he isn\u2019t\u201d is worth keeping in mind: dictators are like the Michelin Man. They are big and imposing until they deflate, a contingency that is often as sudden as it is unexpected.\n\nWhat all this means is that we turn our backs on China at our peril and, at the end of the day, its detriment. China is a fact of life. We may not like it. We have to deal with it.\n\nThis complicated reality, Roger observes, means that any U.S. president \u201chas to walk a tightrope. . . . It\u2019s incumbent on us to find the better, more moderate parts of the regime and subtly encourage them (forming economic ties that work is one way) while still making sure that as Americans we see and sympathize with the cause of the democracy demonstrators.\u201d\n\nAnd here\u2019s the surprising thing\u2014surprising, anyway, to those representing the establishment consensus about foreign policy\u2014\u201cTrump has done a rather accomplished job of this for a \u2018diplomatic amateur.\u2019\u201d He issues blistering criticisms of \u201cpandering\u201d (Roger\u2019s mot juste), hypocritical mountebanks like NBA managers Steve Kerr and Gregg, putting the world on notice about what he personally thinks about the Chinese regime\u2019s behavior (he abominates it).\n\nAt the same time, just as he did with Kim Jong-un and Vladimir Putin, he publicly makes nice with President Xi and his official representatives. Witness the \u201cmini\u201d trade deal he struck Friday with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He at the White House. (I say \u201cmini\u201d because that\u2019s how the deal was described, but it did send the Dow up more than 300 points. What happens if Trump manages a maxi deal with China?)\n\nA smiling presidential face and kind words for Putin, surprise photo-ops with Kim, this Oval Office honor for Liu He, with a side dish of praise for his \u201cgood friend President Xi\u201d: it drives some people nuts. Roger says it\u2019s the \u201cCNNs of the world,\u201d which is true as far as it goes. But the Left pounces on Trump for such public displays of affection directed at such rogues because they believe it will undermine his authority and, ultimately, his legitimacy. The folks who are really upset whenever Trump plants a metaphorical kiss on the dimple of some dictator are the fraternity of NeverTrump neo-cons (and repentant neo-cons like poor Max Boot).\n\nThe bottom like, however, is this. Trump\u2019s actions are \u201ca strategy.\u201d (\u201cObviously,\u201d says Roger. It is obvious to me. But is it obvious to Bill Kristol, to Pastor David French, to Jonah Goldberg?) It is indeed true, as Roger acknowledges that \u201cIt\u2019s not clear the extent to which it will work.\u201d But here\u2019s payday: \u201cif it does even some of the time, it\u2019s miles ahead of what his predecessors ever did.\u201d\n\nCommit that to memory.\n\nIt\u2019s become a chestnut, part of the folklore about Trump, that while he might Tweet or say incontinently mean or rude things about people, his many detractors swish about the place baying for his blood, plotting impeachment and/or prosecution. As one friend of mine put it, Trump\u2019s only impeachable offense was being elected in the first place. That was the unforgivable tort, the original sin that only political death might wipe away.\n\nLess often commented on is the point that Roger Simon makes here: That Trump\u2019s coddling of the dictatorial mind is not capitulation but a steely eyed gambit to get part\u2014he hopes all, or a lot, but at least some\u2014of what he and what the United States wants. Sure, it\u2019s a risky gambit. But the dismal performance of U.S. foreign policy over the last few decades should make us appreciate Trump\u2019s creativity and cunning.\n\nIt\u2019s especially rich that some of the sharpest criticism of Trump on this issue is coming from some of the architects and enablers of that litany of self-absorption and failure. Meanwhile, what if Trump strikes a big trade deal with China? What if he manages to get Kim to denuclearize? What if he lures the mad mullahs in Iran into the 21st century? He hasn\u2019t managed it yet. But so far he\u2019s had a lot more success than did Obama with his spineless habit of \u201cleading from behind.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://amgreatness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1159107054.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
