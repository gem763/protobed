Australian retail is no different.'\n\nMr Walker said the past couple of years has seen retail stores closing to opening at a ratio of about two to one.\n\nHe cited store saturation and online shopping as two major factors behind the closures.\n\n'If you look at the US, Canada and the US examples, they are quite over-shopped in terms of square meterage, per person,' Mr Walker said.\n\n'Certainly the role of online retail shopping is playing a part... The other aspect with online is that it's a massive research tool.\n\nToday, Melbourne's Debenhams store contains a sad array of empty shelves with products running dry\n\n'Consumers are more informed, they're able to shop from different locations and they're doing that accordingly.'\n\nMr Walker said department stores have also felt the pressure more dramatically than any other category across the globe.\n\n'That's a lot to do with, for the reasons I've given, also specialty retail has improved dramatically,' he said.\n\n'The David Jones and Myers of this world, when they were growing, there was not Sephora, Zara and so forth... they've all taken big chunks out of the classic department store market.\n\n'Department stores have not been getting a share of the business.'\n\nToday, Melbourne's Debenhams store contains a sad array of empty shelves with products running dry.\n\nThe department store announced earlier in the year it would go into administration following a $900m loss.\n\nThe Australian franchise of UK fashion store Topshop entered voluntary administration in May 2017 and was forced to close underperforming stores. Pictured: Topshop in Sydney\n\nTOPSHOP\n\nThe Australian franchise of UK fashion store Topshop faced a similar fate when it entered voluntary administration in May 2017 and was forced to close under-performing stores.\n\nTopshop announced its expansion to Australia in 2011 but now only has one store remaining. Their products have been available on e-retailer The Iconic since October 2017.\n\nMr Walker said Topshop 'haven't done well' and suggested it was to do with their 'heartland' being in the UK.\n\n'Their range of products probably wasn't as deep and impressive as it is back home,' he said.\n\n'They had domestic issues anyway... They were also a licensed model over here. Interestingly, so too are Debenhams.'\n\nMr Walker said the 'general consensus' on Topshop was that their Australian range wasn't as good as what is on offer in the UK.\n\n'You could go to Topshop or Zara online and get a better product shipped out of the UK and Spain than you could physically in the stores,' he said.\n\n'Australians are pretty tech savvy, they're able to look online, compare the product in the store and pick it off online.'\n\nMr Walker said the sheer distance between Australia and the UK can also be a reflection of retail failings.\n\n'You've got different hemispheres in terms of fashion. There core winter season is in our summer and so forth, that's a big challenge,' he said,\n\n'You've got cultural idiosyncrasies as well.'\n\nEsprit announced in May 2018 they would close all of their Australian stores, after selling clothes down under for more than 30 years\n\nESPRIT\n\nMr Walker said Esprit had a similar experience with their Australian offer.\n\nThe American retailer announced in May 2018 they would close all of their Australian stores, after selling clothes down under for more than 30 years.\n\nExecutive director Thomas Tang said the brand had been unprofitable in Australia and made the 'unfortunate but unavoidable' decision to pull out of the market.\n\nIt had 67 outlets across Australia and New Zealand.\n\nMr Walker said: 'They were better in their homeland in terms of their offer.'\n\n'Tyranny of distance... This is the challenge for global retailers coming to our country and yet others do it pretty well.'\n\nUS fashion retailer Forever 21 filed for bankruptcy in September this year\n\nFOREVER 21\n\nUS fashion retailer Forever 21 filed for bankruptcy in September this year.\n\n'We have requested approval to close up to 178 stores across the US,' the company said in an email statement.\n\n'The decisions as to which domestic stores will be closing are ongoing, pending the outcome of continued conversations with landlords.\n\n'We do, however, expect a significant number of these stores will remain open and operate as usual, and we do not expect to exit any major markets in the US.'\n\nThe first Australian Forever 21 opened up in 2014 in Brisbane but the retailer has since shut its three flagship stores across the country.\n\nAfter nearly eight years down under, American retailer GAP closed its last Australian store at the beginning of 2018\n\nGAP\n\nAfter nearly eight years down under, American retailer GAP closed its last Australian store at the beginning of 2018.\n\nOroton Group, who teamed up with GAP in 2013 to launch the other Australian stores, announced they would sever all ties and shut down the six remaining stores.\n\nSUCCESSES\n\nMr Walker suggested it wasn't bad news for all international brands and heaped praise on UNIQLO and Zara.\n\n'I have to say Zara's done it pretty well,' he said.\n\n'UNIQLO is the standout for me. I travel the world a lot and they're consistent everywhere.'\n\nMr Walker said UNIQLO had consistency in delivery, high retail standards around visual merchandising and compliance standards and good consistent pricing policy.\n\nHe described their approached as 'consistently excellent wherever they are'.", "description": "A string of major overseas brands have entered the Australian market with high hopes of retail domination, but few have succeeded.", "authors": ["Zoe Zaczek For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/05/19474526-0-image-a-47_1570595102889.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
