The backlash against the intrusive angles started as soon as athletes started to receive images from the \u201ccrotch cams.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy friends told me the pictures weren\u2019t very flattering,\u201d said Dina Asher-Smith, British silver medalist in the women\u2019s 100 meters.\n\nAn official complaint came from the German track and field federation. It led to the competition organizers rolling back the use of the cameras that were introduced in Doha as part of a technology push to attract new viewers. They\u2019ve also introduced pre-race dimming of the lights and graphics being projected on the track\n\n\u201cWe have noted some specific feedback about the block cameras and we have confirmed we have appropriate measures in place to protect athlete privacy during the process of selecting images for broadcast,\u201d the IAAF said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe also have strict editorial guidelines for what is broadcast and these have been observed since the beginning of the championships.\u201d\n\nThe IAAF installed the two miniature cameras in the starting blocks to capture what it called the \u201cexplosion of energy\u201d from athletes who were only previously seen from above or the side of their heads.\n\nNot all competitors objected to the unfamiliar angles.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty cool for the fan base they get to see us in the blocks,\u201d said Andre de Grasse, the Canadian who finished third in the 100 final behind Christian Coleman and Gatlin. \u201cBut you can\u2019t get distracted by it. You\u2019ve just got to focus on your race and not look too much toward the camera.\u201d\n\nDe Grasse was surprised to be informed by one viewer that his eyes were closed briefly.\n\nFilippo Tortu\u2019s father and coach spotted that, too, during sprints in Khalifa International Stadium.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t know that I start with closed eyes,\u201d the Italian said. \u201cHe saw on the camera and said, \u2018You are the only one in the world that does that. Why? Why? Why?\u2019\n\n\u201cBut I think it\u2019s a very positive thing to do more for television. It\u2019s important for us.\u201d\n\nMimicking the whirring sound, British sprinter Zharnel Hughes welcomed the IAAF innovating but not the execution of the technology.\n\n\u201cSometimes you hear camera inside the blocks,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a cool feature but it\u2019s a bit scary at the same time because it\u2019s looking up your nose. You aren\u2019t looking at it. You know it\u2019s there because when you are set on your blocks you hear it.\u201d\n\nOffering new camera angles, though, will count for little it the actual competition isn\u2019t a spectacle.\n\n\u201cPeople want to see competitive races,\u201d Coleman said after winning the world 100 title. \u201cThat\u2019s what will really promote the sport.\u201d", "description": "DOHA, Qatar (AP) \u2014 With cameras in the starting blocks peering up the legs of athletes into their eyes, television viewers have been taken", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/AP-Photo_Peter-David-Josek-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
