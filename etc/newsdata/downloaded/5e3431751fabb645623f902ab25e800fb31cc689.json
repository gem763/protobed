REUTERS/Susana Vera\n\nUnder this legislation, Lam said she would enact a new regulation banning face masks, which have been widely used by protesters to hide their identities over nearly four months of unrest.\n\nLam said it was a difficult, but necessary decision to take at a time of \u201ccritical\u201d danger for the financial hub. She admitted, however, that there was still a chance the move would escalate, rather than defuse the violence, while not ruling out further measures.\n\nThe former British colony is embroiled in its biggest political crisis since its handover to Beijing in 1997.\n\nWhat began as opposition to a proposed extradition law, that could have seen people sent for trial in mainland courts, has grown into a broad pro-democracy movement and a serious challenge to Chinese leader Xi Jinping.\n\nWHAT ARE THE EMERGENCY REGULATIONS?\n\nUnder the Emergency Regulations Ordinance that was tabled in 1922, a relic of the British colonial era, the laws grant the city\u2019s chief executive the power to \u201cmake any regulations whatsoever\u201d on \u201coccasions of emergency or public danger\u201d.\n\nThe legislation allows \u201ccensorship\u201d of publications including the media, arrest, deportation, detention, seizure of property, and authorizes the entry and search of premises. While Friday\u2019s move involved only the mask ban, Lam did not rule out taking further action if the situation continued.\n\nLam said people should not see this as Hong Kong being in a state of emergency, but a means to end the violence, aid police enforcement and restore order.\n\nWILL IT KEEP PEOPLE OFF THE STREETS?\n\nEarly indications suggest that it may be counterproductive or even inflammatory, at least in the short term. Even before the bill was confirmed on Friday afternoon, thousands were gathering in the central business district and some shopping malls, with many sporting masks and chanting.\n\nSoon afterwards, large crowds gathered and blocked roads in several districts, as people denounced the law and chanted for Hong Kong\u2019s liberty and full democracy. Shops and banks closed early. Bigger protests are expected this weekend.\n\nHong Kong has a deeply-ingrained culture of mask-wearing, stemming in part from public health crises in recent decades, particularly the SARS and bird flu outbreaks. Many people routinely wear masks on trains and buses across the congested city, and teachers and pupils often wear them in schools. Police walking into courts often sport them, too.\n\nOne factor promoting widespread use of masks during peaceful protests is growing fears among workers that, despite the right to protest being a core Hong Kong freedom, they could face trouble with their employers, particularly if business owners have close connections to Beijing.\n\nIS IT CONSTITUTIONAL?\n\nPro-democracy lawmakers criticised the move, saying new laws must involve legislative scrutiny and approval. Lam said while the law would take effect on Oct. 5, it would later be scrutinised in the city\u2019s 70-seat legislature that re-opens in mid-October. Some critics have already said they might seek a judicial review to challenge the anti-mask law.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s mini-constitution, the Basic Law, grants the legislature the power to enact, amend or repeal laws.\n\n\u201cThe new law is clearly in breach of the Basic Law and therefore unconstitutional because as from 1/7/97, only the legislative council can enact laws including subsidiary legislation,\u201d Martin Lee, a veteran democrat and one of Hong Kong\u2019s leading barristers, told Reuters.\n\nProfessor Simon Young, of the University of Hong Kong\u2019s law school, said the government\u2019s move would still need to be squared with the freedoms outlined in 1991 Bill of Rights. That bill allows some freedoms to be effectively suspended if a public emergency threatening \u201cthe life of the nation\u201d is declared, but the government has yet to take that step.\n\nWHAT IS THE ANTI-MASK REGULATION?\n\nThe law prohibits masks or other facial coverings during public meetings and processions, as well as unlawful assemblies and \u201criots\u201d. Offenders could be jailed for up to one year and fined up to HK$25,000 ($3,190).\n\n\u201cFreedoms are not without limits,\u201d said Lam, when asked whether this move would trigger more anger amongst a public already bristling at what many see as a steady erosion of individual liberties under Chinese rule.\n\nHong Kong returned from British to Chinese sovereignty in 1997 with the guarantee of a high degree of autonomy and freedoms not allowed in mainland China, under a so-called \u201cone country, two systems\u201d arrangement.\n\nWAS CHINA BEHIND THIS MOVE?\n\nLam said in a press conference that this was a decision made by the Hong Kong government and a high-level body of government advisors called the Executive Council. She said that during her brief trip to Beijing earlier this week to celebrate National Day, she had not met any Chinese officials to discuss this matter.\n\nChina\u2019s Hong Kong Affairs Office later said it supported the anti-mask law, warning that the protests were evolving into a \u201ccolour revolution\u201d - a term coined to refer to popular uprisings in Ukraine and other former Soviet states that swept away long-standing rulers - with interference from external forces.\n\n($1 = 7.8432 Hong Kong dollars)", "description": "Hong Kong's embattled leader Carrie Lam on Friday invoked colonial-era emergency powers for the first time in more than 50 years in a dramatic move intended to quell escalating violence in the Chinese-ruled city.", "authors": ["James Pomfret", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191004&t=2&i=1437024337&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF930XY", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
