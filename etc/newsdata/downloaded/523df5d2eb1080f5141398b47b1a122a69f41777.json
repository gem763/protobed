(Pius Utomi Ekpei/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nOliver says his father was also heavily influenced by Negritude, a movement founded by African and Caribbean students in Paris to celebrate Africa and blackness.\n\n\"Enwonwu was instrumental in creating visual representations of the philosophy,\" he said.\n\n\"If you look closely at that work on this Negritude theme, you can see how he shows the beauty of the black skin, the beauty of the African woman. He depicts this carefully in the work and it's all about being black and proud.\"\n\nLong-lost paintings selling for millions\n\nEnwonwu is one of Africa's most famous artists, and Oliver says he was one of the most famous artists in the Commonwealth at the height of his career.\n\nBut now, more than a decade after his death in 1994, his art has become highly prized among collectors worldwide, with long-lost portraits fetching millions at auction.\n\nLast year, his painting Tutu, a portrait of the Yoruba princess Adetutu Ademiluy, was discovered in a London apartment and sold for \u00a31,208,750 ($2,038,338 Cdn.).\n\nThat painting, often called \"Africa's Mona Lisa,\" is widely known in Nigeria, where many families keep prints of it in their homes.\n\nNigerian author Ben Okri poses with Tutu, which sold last year for more than $2 million Cdn. (Ben Stansall/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nChristine is seen as a precursor to Tutu, and was also thought lost \u2014 until it turned up in Texas.\n\nThe Davis family left Nigeria during a time of political upheaval in the mid-'70s and took the portrait with them.\n\nAfter Christine and her husband died, it remained in her family, until her grandson recently decided to submit it on a whim to Sotheby's, which conservatively valued it at \u00a3100,000 ($168,934.35 Cdn).\n\nChristine sold for \u00a31,095,000 ($1,853,068.50 Cdn) at auction in London. (Sothebys.com)\n\n\"When I told him it could be worth hundreds of thousands of pounds he couldn't believe it,\" Hannah O'Leary, the auction house's head of modern and contemporary art, told CNN.\n\n\"He couldn't believe it was possible and gasped, 'Who would pay that much for a picture of my grandmother?'\"\n\nIt turns out, someone paid a lot more than that. Christine sold on Tuesday for \u00a31,095,000 ($1,853,068.50 Cdn.)\n\nOliver says it's incredible that Christine has seen the light of day again. His foundation, he said, has been searching for it for years.\n\n\"When it came out at Sotheby's, we were understandably very excited to see it,\" he said. \"I hope a Nigerian bought it and I hope it's coming back to Lagos.\"\n\nWritten by Sheena Goodyear.
