They must attack it, but their attacks risk making them more vulnerable. Yet, even if they try to ignore it, they know it will be turned against them. Their predicament goes beyond being \u201cdamned-if-you-do-and-damned-if-you-don\u2019t,\u201d to \u201cdamned if I know.\u201d\n\nHistory shows no issue works like a good economy when it comes to an incumbent president\u2019s reelection. Over the last century, elected presidents seeking a second term are 11-3. Of the three elected incumbents who lost reelection \u2014 Hoover, Carter and George H.W. Bush \u2014 the economy suffered negative annual growth within a year of that election.\n\nIf history is insufficient evidence, then current events should persuade. In presidential bellwether Ohio, a recent Zogby poll of likely voters vouches for its importance. A plurality of 24 percent said the economy would be the most important issue in 2020 \u2014 and that Trump was more trusted to grow the economy than \u201cDemocratic leaders\u201d at 49 percent to 34 percent.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIt is no surprise the economy is so politically potent. It is the most pervasive one, affecting everyone. It is also the most determinant of most people\u2019s quality of life.\n\nFurther, it plays to Republicans\u2019 generic strength and Trump\u2019s specific one as a successful businessman. Without an answer for it, Democrats are in trouble next year. Their problem is finding an approach that works.\n\nDemocrats cannot disparage Trump\u2019s economy. Doing so will look like sour grapes. Worse, it will open them up to a comparison with Obama\u2019s, which was worse. Just looking at GDP alone, during Obama\u2019s first 10 quarters, the economy averaged growth of just 1.3 percent. Even in Obama\u2019s last 10 quarters it averaged just 2.3 percent. Over Trump\u2019s first t10 quarters, the economy has averaged 2.6 percent growth.\n\nAny evidence Democrats use for disparaging the economy will also betray their rhetoric of championing for the average American. Demeaning wage gains, which to most Americans look pretty good \u2014 especially in comparison to the previous years \u2014 denigrates those receiving them and labels the detractors as elitist.\n\nFurther, the most pronounced means for saying the economy is in trouble \u2014 Wall Street indices \u2014 only reinforces the elitist image. Main Street\u2019s bread and butter indicators favor Trump.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn December 2016, 152.1 million Americans were employed, 7.5 million unemployed (4.7 percent rate) and the labor force participation rate was 62.7 percent. September\u2019s jobs report showed 158.3 million employed, 6.2 million more), 5.8 million unemployed (3.5 percent rate and 1.7 million less) and a labor force participation rate of 63.2 percent (0.6 percent higher).\n\nDemocrats also cannot appear to be cheering against the economy. Such an appearance of rank political opportunism is bad under any circumstances. It would be especially so next year when Democrats\u2019 nominee is likely to advocate the greatest political challenge to what have been America\u2019s most fundamental economic tenets. Even if not defending explicitly the adjective of \u201csocialism,\u201d Democrats\u2019 nominee likely will implicitly have to defend against the charge.\n\nFinally, Democrats cannot count on the economy continuing with only modest growth. Underlying economic fundamentals remain strong. Additionally, Trump has many levers at his disposal, a primary one being trade policy.\n\nThe president\u2019s unilateral ability to negotiate trade deals could strengthen the economy appreciably. Nowhere is this proven truer than with China. Even the Friday announcement of a smaller than originally intended China deal \u2014 and still pending negotiations over the details \u2014 delivered a substantial boost to the markets. A final deal could do the same to the economy at large. It could also help calm markets that have been the daily registers of uncertainty.\n\nLike the porcupines, Democrats find themselves in a very sticky economic situation. The economy is Trump\u2019s greatest asset, which would make it the Democrats\u2019 greatest liability \u2014 even if they were not in danger of making it greater still. They must somehow get America to believe the arguments of Democrats\u2019 nominee instead of the evidence of their own eyes.\n\nJ.T. Young served under President George W.
