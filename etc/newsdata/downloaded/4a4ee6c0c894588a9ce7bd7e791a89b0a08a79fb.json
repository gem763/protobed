But as some of TV\u2019s most famous faces gathered together in a London hotel they knew that ordinary, unknown Brits would be outshining and upstaging them.\n\nSir Trevor McDonald and Susanna Reid were among the celebrities tasked with choosing the winners of the Daily Mirror\u2019s Pride of Britain Awards in partnership with TSB.\n\nThey were joined by Carol Vorderman, the show\u2019s host who has helped judge the awards since they started in 1999.\n\nOther judges included Christine Lampard, Ben Shephard, The Saturdays\u2019 Rochelle Humes, GMTV doctor Raj Singh and Met Police Commissioner Cressida Dick.\n\nAnd even before they had began the daunting task of deciding which deserving hero would take home the prestigious award, the judges had all agreed on one thing - that this year is the most difficult of them all.\n\n(Image: Philip Coburn/Daily Mirror)\n\nGMTV\u2019s Ben Shepherd, who has been a judge for nine years, said: \u201cMost years there is one or two contenders who jump out at you as a worthy winner, but this time everyone seems just as amazing as the others.\n\n\u201cThis is definitely the toughest year. There\u2019s going to be intense debate and I really don\u2019t know how we are going to do it.\u201d\n\nCarol Vorderman agreed: \u201cEvery one of the finalists deserves to win. In the past I would arrive here already knowing most of my winners, but this time the entire shortlist is standout. All the stories are amazing and really strong.\u201d\n\n(Image: Philip Coburn/Daily Mirror)\n\nX-Factor host Dermot O\u2019Leary, joining the panel for the first time this year, admitted he was \u201cnot looking forward to it\u201d.\n\nHe said: \u201cI started looking through the judging pack and the first person I saw I thought should win. But then I read the next and I thought she should win too.\n\n\"It\u2019s far more difficult that I imagined. I\u2019ve gone through the entire pack and scribbled notes on half of them.\"\n\nHe added: \u201cTo be honest it made me feel inadequate.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got the people who have just decided to change the world. And you\u2019ve got those who have dealt with extraordinary circumstances in incredible ways.\n\n\"It makes all of us wonder what we would have done in their place.\u201d\n\n(Image: Philip Coburn/Daily Mirror)\n\nIt took two hours of heartfelt debate before the panel agreed on the winners, from a shortlist whittled down from tens of thousands of nominations of heroism and sacrifice.\n\nThe panel, which met at Grosvenor House hotel in Central London, was chaired by Sunday Mirror editor and Pride of Britain founder Peter Willis.\n\nDebbie Crosbie, chief executive of Pride of Britain sponsors TSB was also on the panel.\n\nAnd the discussions were at times passionate and heated as the judges debated which finalist should take the gong for each of the eight categories.\n\n(Image: Philip Coburn/Daily Mirror)\n\n\u201cIf it were me I would have run the other way,\u201d remarked Sir Trevor MacDonald as the panel discussed one of the entries for the award for Outstanding Bravery.\n\n\u201cShe had such presence of mind at such a young age,\u201d said Susanna about a contender for Child/Teenager of Courage. \u201cI just think she\u2019s extraordinary.\u201d\n\nAnd Eamonn Holmes, commenting on one of the finalists for Emergency Service Award, said: \u201cThat one really stood out to me, I think it\u2019s bloody impressive. I keep asking myself, \u2018if I were there, would I, could I, have got involved?\u2019\u201d\n\nSir Trevor McDonald later said reading the real-life stories of heroism had \u201creaffirmed my faith in humanity\u201d.\n\n(Image: Philip Coburn/Daily Mirror)\n\nHe said: \u201cWe sometimes forget that there are many good and extraordinary people in the world. It has been really nice to stop and see something different to what we are used to, and hear about so many lovely, decent people who have shown such spontaneous courage and bravery.\u201d\n\nEamonn Holmes agreed. \u201cAt a time when the country is so divided over Brexit and people are cynical about the intentions of politicians, it\u2019s absolutely uplifting to hear about such selfless people, some of whom have risked their lives to save others.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re the real stars and the backbone of our country.\u201d", "description": "X-Factor host Dermot O\u2019Leary, joining the panel for the first time this year, admitted he was 'not looking forward to' to separating the heroes", "authors": ["Matt Roper", "Image", "Philip Coburn Daily Mirror"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20691561.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Pride-of-Britain.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
