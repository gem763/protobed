Think through what's meaningful for you and how you might want to spend funds. \"Sit down with your spouse or loved ones and discuss what you would like to do in retirement,\" says Logan Allec, a certified public accountant and creator of the personal finance site Money Done Right based in Santa Clarita, California.\n\nDuring the discussion, map out your values. Try writing down a list of your retirement priorities, such as charity, faith, family and interests. Then narrow down the list to several objectives that are the most important to you and your loved ones. This will help you shape retirement goals and get a realistic picture of how you might spend your time. If traveling is important to you, consider how much touring you would like to do in retirement. If you value living in a cottage on a lake, run the numbers of the cost of living in a location you have in mind.\n\n[See: How Much Should You Contribute to a 401(k)?]\n\nSet Some Retirement Goals\n\nA generic estimate of how much income you'll need during retirement may not be accurate for your particular case. \"Assuming you will need 80% of pre-retirement income because you will have less expenses in retirement is an incomplete estimation that does not take into account your individual situation,\" says Ken Van Leeuwen, managing director and founder of Van Leeuwen & Company in Princeton, New Jersey. Instead, think about what all of your goals will cost. Write down a list of expected expenses or work with an advisor to think through how much income you'll want annually. In addition to Social Security benefits, calculate the amount you'll need from other investments and sources to carry out your goals. You may find you'll be able to live on less than 80% of your current income, or you could realize you'll want additional income during your retirement years.\n\nThink about the age you'd like to stop working. \"When to retire is a personal decision,\" Allec says. Talk to your spouse or a loved one about when to step away from your current job. Also take into consideration your health and retirement plans. If you have an active retirement in mind, retiring early might mean you'll have more years of energy to fulfill your plans. However, keep in mind that retirement could last for decades. \"It would not be unreasonable to expect to be in retirement for 30-plus years,\" Coumanakos says. Once you know when you want to retire, mark it on a calendar or in your office. \"By scheduling your retirement, you are shifting that date from an aspiration to a plan,\" Allec says.\n\n[Read: What Is the Average 401(k) Return?]\n\nKnow How Much Risk You're Comfortable With\n\nSome investments come with high risk, meaning they may help your money grow quickly or you could lose a great deal. Lower risk investments often provide lower rates of return, but also reduce the chance you'll lose money. If you prefer lower risk, you might plan on a 3% rate of return on your investments. If you have a moderate risk tolerance, budgeting a 5% or 6% rate of return may work. \"The risk tolerance of the investor has to come into play because that will define how much money someone needs to save each and every month,\" Coumanakos says.\n\nYou and your spouse may have different tolerances for risk, and one member of a married couple may prefer lower-risk investments than the other. If it's difficult to get on the same page, talk to an advisor about your comfort zones. A financial professional could help allocate funds in ways that provide a compromise so you can both sleep at night.\n\nFactor in Your Age\n\nIf retirement is several decades away, you might try a 50/30/20 strategy. \"Allocate 50% of your after-tax pay toward your needs,\" says John O'Rourke III, vice president at First American Bank in Coral Gables, Florida. Of the remaining income, 30% could go toward entertainment and 20% toward saving. And if you can, save more. \"Young investors should save as much as they can possibly afford to now,\" Coumanakos says.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Your retirement plan needs to be aligned with what you need and want.  \"As a whole, retirement plans can never be one size fits all, because everybody is very different,\" says Ephie Coumanakos, co-founder and managing partner at Concord Financial Group in Wilmington, Delaware.
