Mark Sanford, R-S.C., said on Monday that he is curious to know about former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s son's business dealings in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on there is the proverbial swamp,\u201d Sanford told \u201cAmerica\u2019s Newsroom.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all that irks most normal people about what they don\u2019t like about Washington D.C.,\" said Sanford, who has announced a 2020 presidential primary challenge to President Trump.\n\nFormer Prime Minister of Ukraine Mykola Azarov said last week that authorities must investigate Hunter Biden to establish whether or not his role on the board of a Ukrainian gas company complied with the nation\u2019s laws.\n\nVICTOR DAVIS HANSON: HUNTER BIDEN'S UKRAINE BUSINESS DEALINGS 'LOOK VERY SUSPICIOUS'\n\nAzarov, who served under Ukraine's former pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych, did not specify to which laws he was referring. Trump and his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani have called on current Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the Biden family's dealings with Ukrainian firm Burisma Holdings.\n\nBurisma reportedly paid Hunter up to $50,000 per month to sit on its board at the same time his father was leading the Obama administration's diplomatic dealings with Kiev. A second private equity firm founded by the younger Biden also reportedly received $3.4 million from the same company.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nTrump and Giuliani have alleged that when Ukrainian prosecutors tried to investigate Burisma Holdings for corruption, then-Vice President Biden pressured the government to fire the head prosecutor. Biden has denied knowing about his son's business dealings.\n\nSanford went on to say, \u201cThe fact that, you know, somebody\u2019s son, daughter, relative, friend, ends up with a plum assignment or a plum-paying position just because of where Dad happens to be is everything that\u2019s wrong with Washington, D.C.\u201d\n\nSanford said Democrats' efforts to impeach Trump over the phone call to Zelensky are \"going nowhere\" in the Senate. He said the House should formally \"censure\" Trump, if wrongdoing occurred, and move on.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Former Rep.
