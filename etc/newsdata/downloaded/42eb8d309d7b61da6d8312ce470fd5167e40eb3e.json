Now she has a plan for how to heal them: lose ourselves in nature\n\nNearly two years ago, the artist and academic Jenny Odell gave a keynote address on \u201chow to do nothing\u201d. In it she talked about the impact of modern life\u2019s ceaseless demands on our time and attention, \u201ca situation where every waking moment has become pertinent to our making a living\u201d. And she discussed how she herself had found respite in nature.\n\nHer talk was written for the Eyeo festival in Minneapolis \u2013 described as for the \u201ccreative technology community\u201d and attended by the kind of blue-sky thinkers unlikely to balk at references to concepts like \u201cobservational eros\u201d. Yet, when the 10,000-word transcript was published online, it went viral. Not only that: many people read it to the end.\n\n\u201cIt was really a surprise that it resonated with people outside of that pretty specific context, and that people would have the patience to read something that\u2019s 45 minutes long, online,\u201d says Odell, by phone from her home in Oakland, California. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten a lot of responses from people saying things like, \u2018you\u2019ve put words to a feeling that I\u2019ve had for a long time\u2019.\u201d\n\nThat a lengthy online treatise about shattered attention spans should manage to hold so many of them is ironic, it reflects wider concern. Odell writes of feeling compelled to seek refuge in her local rose garden in the days after Donald Trump became president, \u201clike a deer going to a salt lick\u201d: \u201cIt really did feel necessary, like a survival tactic.\u201d\n\nShe eventually understood the impulse in the words of the French philosopher, Gilles Deleuze: when we are \u201criddled with pointless talk, insane quantities of words and images\u201d, the challenge is to search for \u201clittle gaps of solitude and silence in which [to] find \u2026 the rare, and even rarer thing that might be worth saying\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jenny Odell ... felt compelled to seek refuge in her rose garden after Trump\u2019s election victory\n\nIf that was hard in 1985, when Deleuze was writing, it is next to impossible now. Technology, coupled with economic insecurity, has dissolved boundaries between work, rest and leisure. \u201cWhat we are left with,\u201d Odell writes, with no small sadness, \u201c[are] 24 potentially monetizeable hours \u2026 that we can no longer justify spending on \u2018nothing\u2019. It ...is simply too expensive.\u201d\n\nThis \u201ccrisis\u201d forms the basis of Odell\u2019s new book, described as both a \u201ccritique of the forces vying for our attention\u201d and an action plan for how to resist them. As a title, How to Do Nothing sounds parodic \u2013 I felt a bit self-conscious reading it on the train. Who needs a book to know how to do nothing?\n\nMany of us, it turns out. In the 18-month turnaround from Odell\u2019s keynote to hardback \u2013 warp-speed, for the industry \u2013 publishing has become transfixed by our current way of life and the possibility of a different one, evidenced by Malcolm Harris\u2019s Kids These Days, a social critique of millennials as human capital, Digital Minimalism by Cal Newport, BuzzFeed journalist Anne Helen Petersen\u2019s forthcoming book on \u201cmillennial burnout\u201d , and another on \u201cthe art of rest\u201d by Claudia Hammond.\n\nTogether, these books seem to denote a dawning, collective comprehension that \u201crather than establishing a set of rigorous habits, we may need to rethink our approach to life in general\u201d, as the New Yorker\u2019s Jia Tolentino recently put it (her own new essay collection also deals with these themes). And Odell seems to be proposing a solution.\n\n\u201cI mean, I hope so,\u201d she says. \u201cMy own experience was one of self-observation, which I think is happening to a lot of people right now \u2013 you can only do something that makes you feel so bad, for so long, without starting to ask why. The original talk came out of me wondering why I was going to the rose garden so often, and why that felt necessary \u2013 I think this cultural moment, this kind of reckoning that\u2019s happening, is maybe related.\u201d\n\nMany commentators have zeroed in on our relationship with technology as the source of the problem: Newport advocates a 30-day \u201cdigital declutter\u201d, while others suggest using apps to monitor or restrict screen time. But Odell sees that approach as too limited, not only inadequately isolating tech as the cause but also framing it as the answer. Her proposal is that we train ourselves to assume a different perspective, one that allows us to see familiar things in a new way and in the process find momentary relief.\n\n\u201cWhen I try to articulate it, it sounds really abstract, but I think it\u2019s actually very practical,\u201d Odell says. \u201cIf you think about your mindset when you go to a place you\u2019ve never been, especially on vacation, the way that you look at things is quite different than how you would normally look at things while on your way to work. A lot of what I\u2019m describing is trying to apply that same mindset to things that you\u2019ve seen many times \u2013 you will always be surprised.\u201d\n\nMany will recognise that slightly out-of-body sensation of being confronted by limitless possibilities in an unfamiliar place, and the refreshing, restorative effect it can have; the trick to surviving this modern world, Odell says, is to be able to access that plane as and when necessary. \u201cOnce in a while, I will go and stay in a cabin somewhere for a couple of days, but oftentimes that\u2019s not possible. With a lot of will and effort, you can do that without leaving \u2013 you can make a decision to look at everything a little bit off-kilter. If you just expand out from the 24-hour news cycle, the notifications, even a little bit, it no longer feels like just another day.\u201d\n\nOdell herself finds this state of mind most easily accessed in nature, losing herself in the study of a single leaf or patch of earth, or going on meandering hikes. \u201cI can\u2019t even call it a hike, because some of that is just me sitting on a rock or under a tree somewhere. I\u2019ll be on some other planet in my head, then I\u2019ll see some trail runners who clearly just got off work, and it\u2019s their exercise ... whereas I was having this almost psychedelic encounter with very specific plants.\u201d\n\nIt is a kind of mindfulness that Odell is describing, albeit stripped of any connection to the wellness industry; the practice of simultaneously seeing more and zooming in with hyper-precision. \u201cI think it gets easier, the more you do it. But sometimes it\u2019s the really simple thing of just asking, \u2018OK, what in this scene have I not noticed before?\u2019\u201d\n\nA keen birdwatcher (or, as she puts it, \u201cbird-noticer\u201d), Odell recalls in great detail specific experiences in nature \u2013 happening upon a clearing full of sage plants and its \u201camazing smell\u201d, or seeing a \u201creally amazing warbler\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s not about, at the end of those five hours, thinking, \u2018I\u2019m so glad I got my heart rate up\u2019. Maybe I did, I don\u2019t actually know. But it\u2019s more that. When I got back to my car, it was like that time had just disappeared \u2013 it felt like it had been three days.\u201d It is further evidence of the importance of parks and green spaces in cities, she adds.\n\nFinding solace in nature is not a new idea, but its sense of escape is increasingly necessary for our survival, says Odell. She has previously likened it to \u201ca wastewater treatment for my brain\u201d \u2013 if not clearing it of \u201cdebris and noise and worry\u201d, at least making her conscious of it. \u201cYou really can\u2019t see it unless you step aside,\u201d she says now.\n\nAwareness \u2013 rather than change \u2013 may be the most we can hope for. Odell has said How To Do Nothing is not a self-help book promising simple steps to a lasting new way of life : \u201cYou have to know that you\u2019re going to keep getting sucked back in, and be realistic about that.\u201d\n\nShe hopes, however, that learning \u201chow to do nothing\u201d may serve as self-care in the original sense that Audre Lorde intended it - as a strategy of self-preservation for activism. With inattention at the root of inaction, complacency and even bias \u2013 she draws a link between her ideas and efforts to counter implicit racial prejudice through teaching people \u201chow to see what they\u2019re not seeing\u201d. The mere investment of attention signals intention and invites returns. It is \u201cquite humbling\u201d, she says, to discover how much you have been missing.\n\n\u201cThat decision to pay attention to different things, or to ask those questions \u2013 to me, that\u2019s the beginning of free will. If, in that abstract mental space, you can be reminded that the decision is actually yours to make, that it wasn\u2019t made for you, I think that cascades into all the other areas of your life \u2013 like, for instance, using social media \u2013 where you actually have a choice, where you didn\u2019t think you had one.\u201d\n\nBurned out and overwhelmed: should you embrace the joy of no? Read more\n\nBut paying attention is not easy to do. It demands \u201ca state of openness that assumes there is something new to be seen\u201d, and the discipline to \u201cresist our tendency to declare our observations finished\u201d, writes Odell. What is necessary, she says, is refusal (she reimagines #fomo as \u201c#nomo, the necessity of missing out\u201d) and vigilance, guarding against the burnout or apathy that can result from extreme overstimulation. \u201cIf attention and will are so closely linked, then we have even more reason to worry about an entire economy and information ecosystem preying on our attention.\u201d\n\nIronically, in the wake of Odell\u2019s book, it has been possible to observe those forces\u2019 magnetic pull in action. The social critiques in her keynote have subsequently been bundled in with Silicon Valley- style \u201clife hacks\u201d, such as the idea of meditating for productivity; or proposals to alleviate the effects of capitalism with more capitalism, by working harder or buying more. While mindfulness is often billed as having the revolutionary power to transform the world, Odell\u2019s book makes few promises beyond, perhaps, increased awareness and a possible coping strategy. But it is not hard to imagine her quite academic, unwieldy treatise being tidied up and repackaged as The Life-Changing Magic of Doing Nothing, assimilated by those forces for productivity it tries to resist.\n\nIt may well be already happening. I catch myself asking Odell what she sees as the benefit or the outcome of doing nothing \u2013 is it increased creativity? Greater empathy, improved mental health?\n\n\u201cI think it could lead to any of those things, but I am careful not to instrumentalise it,\u201d she says. \u201cI am genuinely interested in nothing for the sake of nothing, rather than nothing for the sake of something. \u2026 Honestly, it will sound cheesy, but the impetus that is the most obvious for me is that it\u2019s a reminder that you\u2019re alive.\u201d\n\n\u2022 How to Do Nothing, by Jenny Odell, is published by Melville House Publishing (\u00a320).
