He tried valiantly to assist the security guards who were beaten and tied up. He was shot in the process and paid for his courageous actions with his life.\n\n\"The FF Plus will continue to fight to force the government to act against crime in the province and elsewhere in the country and will assist the police in any way possible to arrest the culprits,\" said FF Plus provincial leader, Werner Weber, in a statement.\n\nMpumalanga police spokesperson Brigadier Leonard Hlathi told TimesLive that according to Wade's wife, Lindie, he went to investigate after hearing security guards screaming for help at Tranquilitas Adventure Farm. He was then shot. He died on the scene.\n\nHlathi said that police arrived immediately after the incident with their dogs but were unable to trace the suspects due to the rain.\n\nHowever the Lowvelder reported that the police had to return back to the Waterval Boven police station as angry community members, upset about poor service delivery, had broken windows and damaged vehicles.\n\nWhen police returned to the farm they found the suspects' abandoned vehicle about 500 metres from the entrance.\n\n- Compiled by Vanessa Banton", "description": "Concerns have been raised about the safety of tourists in Mpumalanga following the death of well-known rock climber David Wade.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9531/0dea6ae2cd5842b78365a6bbbcdccee3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
