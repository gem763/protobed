Katrina Group will launch four more of such hotels in Singapore within the next 12 months.\n\nCATALIST-LISTED food and beverage (F&B) player Katrina Group on Wednesday unveiled a hotel in Chinatown through its hospitality arm, as the first in a new line of affordable co-living hotels in the Asia Pacific.\n\nFour more co-living hotels in Singapore under the ST Signature brand will be rolled out within the next 12 months, including the flagship one in Tanjong Pagar which will open its doors later in October.\n\nThis marks the group\u2019s first major expansion since it entered the hospitality segment with its S$358,000 acquisition of serviced residences provider Straits Organization in December last year.\n\n\u201cThe location and easy access to the Chinatown hotel make it an ideal choice for regular business travellers who want both convenience and luxury at an affordable price,\u201d said chief host Ng Xin Fang, who runs the ST Signature line.\n\nsentifi.com Market voices on:\n\nNow fully operational, ST Signature Chinatown features a proprietary smart Chat-In technology with a virtual host to provide concierge services. The multitasking chat platform also allows guests to check-in and check-out efficiently, communicate online with fellow guests without disclosing personal information, and buy e-tickets to tourist attractions.\n\nIts 40 rooms are \u201cintelligently designed\u201d in interlocking S-shapes, making them spacious enough to be comfortable and yet compact enough to reduce the property\u2019s carbon footprint and ensuring no square-inch is wasted, Katrina said. The design also provides pockets of space for co-working and networking.\n\nRoom rates at the Chinatown hotel range from S$60 to S$200 per night.\n\nKatrina, which also owns and operates restaurants such as Bali Thai, Streats and So Pho, aims to become the largest co-living hotel brand in Singapore.\n\n\u201cWe believe the co-living concept will continue to grow within the region, driven by the millennial demographic and with strong growth expected in the global business travel segment,\u201d said Alan Goh, Katrina\u2019s executive chairman and chief executive officer.\n\nWhile flat-sharing or shared housing has been popular among students and young professionals, what differentiates co-living spaces is that they are professionally managed, often offering benefits and services beyond accommodation.\n\nStraits Organization has a portfolio of over 600 serviced apartment units in Singapore and Hong Kong under its ST Residences brand.\n\nIn August, Katrina sank into the red with a net loss of S$2.1 million for the half year ended June 30, compared to a net profit of S$31,000 a year ago, amid higher expenses arising from the Straits Organization acquisition.\n\nIts shares were flat at 16.4 Singapore cents as at 11.03am on Wednesday.", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Companies & Markets - CATALIST-LISTED food and beverage (F&B) player Katrina Group on Wednesday unveiled a hotel in Chinatown through its hospitality arm, as the first in a new\u00a0line of affordable co-living hotels in the Asia Pacific. .
