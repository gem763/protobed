Mr. Trump agreed to withdraw about 50 to make way for a Turkish force. He thus \u201cgreen lighted\u201d Turkey\u2019s invasion of the area and emboldened Mr. Erdogan. A few days later, after Turkish artillery fire bracketed a U.S. outpost there \u2014 intentionally, not accidentally, hitting both sides of it \u2014 Mr. Trump decided to pull all of our approximately 1,000 troops from the area.\n\nMr. Erdogan, riding a wave of popularity at home, believed correctly that he\u2019d won a major confrontation with the United States. He celebrated by revealing that the Turkish invasion of northeastern Syria was, in fact, an ethnic cleansing campaign.\n\nAccording to the Financial Times, Mr. Erdogan said his government was in discussions with Russia \u2014 with which he and Iran had joined in a treaty to protect Syrian leader Bashar Assad \u2014 about the strategic Arab-majority town of Manbij. The FT quoted Mr. Erdogan as saying the town needed to be \u201cemptied\u201d of the Kurdish \u201cterrorist organizations\u201d that control it.\u201d\n\nIn the October 6 call, Mr. Trump couldn\u2019t have been surprised by Mr. Erdogan\u2019s demand that we withdraw from Syria which Mr. Erdogan has been demanding since Mr. Trump became president. That demand, along with Mr. Erdogan\u2019s signing the treaty with Russia and Iran, his purchase of Russian S-400 missile systems \u2014 forbidden by the United States \u2014 and his Islamization of formerly secular Turkey deprived of credibility Mr. Trump\u2019s threat to \u201cobliterate\u201d Turkey\u2019s economy with economic sanctions if it took objectionable action in Syria.\n\nMr. Erdogan\u2019s invasion order \u2014 and that his forces would not stop before all U.S. troops were driven from the area \u2014 were entirely foreseeable.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s decision to impose only minor sanctions against Turkey was a form of vacillation that weakened America\u2019s position. That effect seemed to be worsened by the president sending Vice President Pence and Secretary of State Pompeo to Ankara to plead for a cease fire after Mr. Erdogan rejected the idea.\n\nMr. Trump wants to withdraw U.S. troops from all the conflict zones in the Middle East to end the \u201cendless wars\u201d he campaigned against in 2016. That\u2019s a laudable idea, but he apparently doesn\u2019t understand that you can\u2019t expect a positive result from any war that you abandon to the enemy.\n\nAs I have written on this page, unless America fights a war in a manner calculated to win it decisively, we will lose it inevitably.\n\nThe president\u2019s errors are very serious, but so are Mr. Erdogan\u2019s.\n\nHaving entered into a 2016 treaty with Russia and Iran to defend the Assad regime, and having purchased the highly-sophisticated S-400 anti-missile/anti-aircraft systems, Mr. Erdogan apparently believed he had secured Russia\u2019s cooperation in his ambition to establish Turkey as a major power. But his dreams of a new Turkish caliphate were quashed quickly. Not by us, but by Russia.\n\nMr. Erdogan intended to occupy \u2014 and ethnically cleanse \u2014 an area 32 kilometers deep in Syria. A week into the Turkish invasion, Russia said any such invasion was \u201cunacceptable\u201d and announced that its troops would prevent fighting between Syrian and Turkish forces. Russia thus put an end to Mr. Erdogan\u2019s territorial ambition.\n\nThat action is a blunt message from Russian President Putin to Mr. Erdogan that its territorial gains in Syria are far more important to Russia than Mr. Erdogan pretends it to be. Having established Russian power in the Middle East by its huge footprint in Turkey, Mr. Putin is not about to allow Mr. Erdogan to even slightly whittle away at it.\n\nInstead of Turkish troops eliminating Kurdish people in Manbij, the town is now occupied by Syrian troops. Abandoned by the United States, the Kurds have sought \u2014 and are obtaining \u2014 some protection from the Assad regime.\n\nMr. Erdogan\u2019s \u201cvictories,\u201d small as Mr. Putin is making them, are becoming ever costlier to us, and to him.\n\nOne of the clearly foreseeable results of our abandonment of the Kurds is the release of at least 10,000 ISIS fighters from camps in which they had been held by U.S. and Kurdish forces. There will be a major ISIS resurgence in Syria and wherever those people can travel.\n\nRussia and Iran are \u2014 again, foreseeably \u2014 the other big winners in Syria. Having already established major bases and power centers in western Syria, they are now able to expand into the northeast. Russian troops have already occupied a base abandoned by ours.\n\nSome European NATO members are making noise but will do nothing significant to penalize Mr. Erdogan. That\u2019s because he has threatened to open the gates for hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees to get to Europe, causing another immigration crisis like the one that began in 2015. The Europeans won\u2019t risk that.\n\nThe 120-hour cease-fire agreement with Mr. Erdogan that Mr. Pence announced Thursday enables the retreat of Kurdish forces from a \u201csafe zone\u201d to be occupied by Turkey. However, it does nothing to ensure that the 10,000 ISIS fighters remain in captivity. It also promises that Mr. Trump will not only decline to impose further sanctions on Turkey, he will remove those that had just been imposed. It looks like another costly victory for Mr. Erdogan.\n\n\u2022 Jed Babbin, a deputy undersecretary of Defense in the George H.W.
