They were both sending messages to Teddy without the other one knowing.\n\n\u2018Demi was also thrown into the mix. She was sending texts to Teddy as well.\u2019\n\nThey claimed that after seeing Teddy\u2019s tweet about the love triangle, Towie star Demi sent the tweet to Megan to \u2018stir the pot\u2019.\n\nMegan and Chelcee, 27, soon split after \u2018huge rows\u2019.\n\nDemi Sims was also texting Teddy (Picture: BACKGRID)\n\nTeddy, 29 \u2013 who founded the nightclub for queer women LICK \u2013 alluded to the drama as she tweeted: \u2018How have I been single 5 minutes and already become centre stage of every lesbian drama? Just let me lesbian in peace for gods sake.\u2019\n\nAnd after one person tweeted: \u2018TeddyEdwardes and @ChelceeGrimes both single now they would be major #couplegoals\u2019, Teddy wrote: \u2018She #wishes.\u2019\n\nLove Island star Megan left the 2018 series in a relationship with Wes Nelson, but they split up after six months together in January.\n\nSince then, the reality star briefly found love with Demi, 23, on Celebs Go Dating \u2013 but recently claimed there was nothing sexual about their romance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking to Fabulous, Megan said: \u2018It even got to a point where I was doubting myself, like \u201cdo I like women?\u201d We would just kiss, I couldn\u2019t do anything more.\n\n\u2018I felt I liked her more as a friend. I\u2019d be laying in bed with her and all we could do was kiss.\n\n\u2018We couldn\u2019t get past that point and I was doubting if I\u2019m actually gay. It\u2019s not right. She\u2019s a lovely girl but we didn\u2019t have that spark.\u2019\n\nMetro.co.uk has contacted Megan and Chelcee\u2019s reps for comment.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
