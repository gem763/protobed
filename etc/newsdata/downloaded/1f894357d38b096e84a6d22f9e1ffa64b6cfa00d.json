The additional effort to try and get that number down to zero ... is a vanishing return.\"\n\nThe home affairs head also boasted other countries were envious of Australia's track record.\n\n\"Frankly the reaction we get is the Meg Ryan reaction: 'We'll have what they're having',\" Mr Pezzullo said.\n\nBut Labor's home affairs spokeswoman Kristina Keneally questioned this, pointing to a June report from the US State Department reviewing Australia's border screening processes.\n\n\"(Australia) did not convict any traffickers, initiated fewer prosecutions, did not adequately screen for indicators of trafficking among vulnerable groups and limited some victims' access to services based on their participation in law enforcement investigations,\" the report said.", "description": "Cracking down on the number of people arriving in Australia by air and then seeking asylum", "authors": ["Australian Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
