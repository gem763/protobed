The necklace is a tribute to dad.\n\nOn the starting line, she can almost hear his voice, too: \u201cRun hard. Push yourself. Be your best.\u201d\n\nDaniels is the newest American sprinter on the scene, winning the 100 meters at nationals to earn her place at the world championships and announce her presence less than a year away from the Tokyo Games. It\u2019s just the way her dad envisioned it. Wellice Daniels died of a stroke on Jan. 26, 2018 - a date that\u2019s inscribed on the necklace that she constantly wears.\n\n\u201cMy dad and I bonded through track,\u201d said Daniels , the 22-year-old out of the University of Texas whose event starts Saturday inside Khalifa International Stadium. \u201cI always run for him. I always run for my family.\u201d\n\nA quick story: One of her first competitions was as an 8-year-old while wearing sandals. She lined up against a group of neighborhood boys for a friendly race.\n\nShe lost.\n\nHer mom, Linda Latson, called her over for some advice - go put on some tennis shoes. A re-race was held.\n\nShe won.\n\nAfter that, Daniels was on her way -club teams, helping the Americans to a 4x100 Pan-American Junior title in 2015. High school team, where she captured back-to-back state titles in the 100 and 200 at The First Academy in Florida. On to Texas, where she became an NCAA indoor champion at 60 meters.\n\nThrough all that, her dad had a front-row seat. Daniels\u2018 mom and dad separated when she was young and she went to live with her dad in middle school. Track was their glue.\n\nHe attended practices, standing along the fence and giving pointers.\n\n\u201cI appreciated it. But I was always like, \u2018Dad, go sit down somewhere. Go sit in the stands,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cNow that I think about it, he was just being really supportive in that part of my life.\u201d\n\nThat support meant everything. That\u2019s why she can\u2019t forget that day.\n\nOn Jan. 26, 2018, she was approaching the hotel lobby in Lubbock, Texas, about to go to the track for a pre-meet workout, when her mom called and said her dad died.\n\nImpossible, Teahna remembers saying. She just spoke with him the night before when he wished her good luck and told her she loved him - \u201cthe same stuff he always says to me,\u201d she recounted.\n\n\u201cI just couldn\u2019t believe it,\u201d she added. \u201cMy dad was really gone?\u201d\n\nDaniels crumbled to the lobby floor and had to be helped to her room.\n\nThen, a pledge: He would be as big a part of her journey going forward as he had been up to that point.\n\nSame with her mom and all of her siblings.\n\nFamily first.\n\nA friend made the necklace for her. On one side there\u2019s the word \u201cQueen.\u201d It\u2019s a reminder to act like royalty - mom\u2019s advice.\n\nThere\u2019s also the date of her dad\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cA reminder to keep working hard and keep going,\u201d she explained.\n\nTo get leaner and stronger, Daniels said she dropped 19 pounds. She was among the favorites going into the NCAA championships in June - her final collegiate meet on her home track.\n\nShe wound up a disheartening fourth.\n\n\u201cI thought too much in my head about everything,\u201d explained Daniels, who recently signed a deal with Nike. \u201cI lost my focus.\u201d\n\nIt made her refocus.\n\n\u201cNo winner has ever come up to you saying, \u2018We need to work on this,\u2019\u201d her coach, Edrick Flor\u00e9al said. \u201cThey\u2019re thinking about celebrating. The kid that doesn\u2019t win wants to talk. They\u2019re like, \u2018OK, what do I need to improve on?\u2019\u201d\n\nThat was Daniels. So Floreal gave her a list of little things to accomplish and she\u2019d call him with updates:\n\nMore ice baths? Check.\n\nWalks in the morning as a way to stretch out? Check.\n\nWatch more video? Check.\n\n\u201cShe reassessed,\u201d Flor\u00e9al said. \u201cShe was a different person after that.\u201d\n\nThe results came at nationals, where Daniels was not really on the radar in the 100.\n\nAs she stepped into the blocks that night, she recalled the advice her father always gave her: Just run your race.\n\nFrom lane 4, she fell behind early before surging to the front for the win in a time of 11.20 seconds. She earned a spot to worlds that day along with English Gardner and Morolake Akinosun (Tori Bowie already had an automatic berth as the defending world champion).\n\nAll of the sudden, a deep American field looking to earn a spot for the Tokyo Games next summer just got a whole lot deeper. The win at nationals was highly emotional for Daniels, who after the race found her mom for an moving embrace.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s seen me at some of my lowest moments and to see me win, it meant a lot,\u201d Daniels said. \u201cShe\u2019s always there, supporting me.\u201d\n\nDad, too.\n\n\u201cI always feel close to him,\u201d Daniels said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Before a race, Teahna Daniels instinctively clutches the gold necklace dangling from her neck.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Pat Graham"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/27/worlds-teahnas_time_athletics_47347_c0-153-3658-2285_s1770x1032.jpg?5eed565a6dd600146f94bd00c2df18e1f2d4c269", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
