(AP)\n\nIn California, a man is accused of a series of unprovoked attacks on homeless people. In Arizona, a Democratic congressman\u2019s aide breaks the ankle of a Republican wearing a Make America Great Again hat. In Connecticut, a police officer has a brick thrown through his cruiser\u2019s window; authorities say the suspect talked about hating cops.\n\nAll are acts of violence, but are they hate crimes? In a growing number of states, the answer is yes, as the definition of hate crimes expands well beyond traditional categories such as race and ethnicity, religion, national origin, gender and sexual orientation.\n\nSeven states and the District now consider homeless individuals a protected group, for example. Five states do the same for police; at least four include political affiliation or political beliefs.\n\nUtah goes the furthest, with a new law that establishes a whopping 18 categories. It adds age, service in the military, status as an emergency responder. It even counts \u201cmatriculation\u201d \u2014 legal speak for bad blood between schools.\n\nThe state has a \u201cpretty good rivalry\u201d between the University of Utah and Brigham Young University, explained Republican state Sen. J. Stuart Adams, who introduced the line item. \u201cIf I\u2019m standing outside of a bar and I\u2019ve got my red University of Utah hat on, and a couple of [BYU] guys come beat me up . . . a hate crimes statute would help me.\u201d\n\nThese greater protections come amid sharp increases in hate crime incidents nationwide, as reflected in federal data and outside reports. Civil rights groups are pushing the five states without any hate crime laws to pass legislation.\n\nBut broadening who is covered has divided usual allies and raised thorny questions.\n\nShould a group of individuals qualify if their key characteristic \u2014 such as wearing a police uniform or living on the street \u2014 can change? Who gets to decide when a certain threshold has been met for designating a new category, a move that enables prosecutors to tack on penalty enhancements? And, some leaders ask, at what point do these laws become so broad as to lose all meaning?\n\nKami Chavis, a law professor at Wake Forest University and an expert on hate crime measures, says the continuing expansions run the risk of diluting such statutes\u2019 original intention: to protect historically marginalized or persecuted groups.\n\n\u201cWhen we start broadening those categories, it is almost like the exceptions swallow the rule,\u201d Chavis said. \u201cOur national history is bound up in racial discrimination. . . . When you start giving [protections] to every single vulnerable category, then it could have a negative effect.\u201d\n\nYet times and circumstances change and can warrant a more expansive approach, according to Heidi Beirich, director of the Intelligence Project at the Southern Poverty Law Center. A decade ago, she recalls, some people feared that adding gender to the federal hate crimes statute would defeat its purpose since about half the population is female.\n\n\u201cThe view of the civil rights community was: Well, women actually are targeted in ways that men aren\u2019t,\u201d Beirich said. \u201cThey come from less power historically. And they face particular kinds of violence that other populations don\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\n\nSurrounded by supporters, Gov. Gary R. Herbert (R) signs Utah\u2019s expansive new hate crimes bill in April. It covers 18 categories of people, including members of the military and the elderly. (Rick Egan/AP)\n\nHate crime laws date to the Civil Rights Act of 1968, which made it a crime to attack or issue threats against people based on \u201crace, color, religion or national origin.\u201d President Barack Obama added sexual orientation, gender, disability and gender identity to the list four decades later when he signed legislation specifically named for two men killed during gruesome hate crimes \u2014 Matthew Shepard, who was gay, and James Byrd Jr., who was black.\n\nIn the intervening years, California became the first state to pass its own statute, followed steadily by states across the country. The more recent controversy has been over whom these measures should cover.\n\nThere has been no shortage of attacks to fuel the sharp debate. About 7,100 hate crimes were reported nationwide in 2017, marking the third consecutive year of increases and a 17 percent jump over 2016, according to the FBI\u2019s latest statistics. In the wake of the Aug. 3 mass shooting in El Paso, that trajectory is unlike to reverse in 2019. (Officials are considering federal hate crime charges against Patrick Crusius, who allegedly was targeting Hispanics when police say he opened fire in an El Paso Walmart.)\n\nSince President Trump has been in office, his supporters have repeatedly cited instances of violence against them that they considered hate crimes. Michael Lieberman, the Anti-Defamation League\u2019s Washington counsel, suspects such cases would be difficult to prove.\n\n\u201cIf you have a Make America Great Again hat on or \u2018I wish Hillary would have won\u2019 hat on and you\u2019re beaten up, it would just be hard to say\u201d that the beating was a consequence, he noted. \u201cWhat would be the evidence at the scene of the crime? . . . Usually the hate crimes that are prosecuted are not nuanced.\u201d\n\nThe greater push to expand protections has centered on the homeless and first responders, particularly police.\n\nCivil rights groups such as the SPLC, the ADL and American Civil Liberties Union generally oppose \u201cBlue Lives Matter\u201d laws on the grounds that most states already have penalty enhancements for assaults on public safety workers.\n\nOn the matter of the homeless, however, they are split.\n\nThe ADL is opposed. Lieberman points to a crucial distinction with homeless individuals: Their status isn\u2019t immutable. \u201cYou could be homeless one day and not the next,\u201d he said.\n\nThe SPLC disagrees, with Beirich noting that the immutability standard already flexes. After all, a person\u2019s religious affiliation is also changeable.\n\n\u201cThe homeless are demeaned constantly,\u201d she said, \u201cand often times on the basis of the idea that people think it\u2019s your own fault for being homeless.\u201d\n\nThat rare division emerged this spring during renewed debate about a proposal in California, which the National Coalition for the Homeless says leads the nation in crimes against homeless individuals. The previous year, video footage captured an unprovoked assault as a passerby stopped on a San Francisco sidewalk to twice kick a sleeping homeless man in the face. Police later connected the alleged perpetrator, a 59-year-old computer technician, to the murder of another homeless man in a Chinatown alley.\n\nGiven such attacks, Democratic State Assemblyman Mike Gipson wanted a more encompassing law.\n\n\u201cIf you are singled out because you\u2019re black or because you\u2019re Latino, that\u2019s a hate crime,\u201d said Gipson, an African American who spends one night a year sleeping in homeless encampments in his district in Los Angeles County. \u201cShouldn\u2019t we have that same law for the homeless who are being sought out because they are homeless?\u201d\n\nAlthough his bill died in committee, Gipson plans to try again in 2020.\n\nTragedies typically propel this kind of legislation. Texas became the fourth state to make police, firefighters and emergency medical personnel a protected group under its hate crimes statute a year after a sniper killed five officers and wounded seven more in Dallas at the end of a 2016 rally protesting police shootings. The shooter told a hostage negotiator that he wanted to assassinate white officers before a remote-controlled robot killed him with a bomb.\n\n\n\nPolice officers arrive at a memorial service honoring five slain Dallas police officers.

(Tom Pennington/Getty Images)\n\nSome national law-enforcement organizations are hesitant to discuss Blue Lives Matter laws. The United States Deputy Sheriff\u2019s Association doesn\u2019t take a position, with a spokesman explaining that the group stays \u201cout of the political realm.\u201d Bill Johnson, executive director of the National Association of Police Organizations, said in a short email that the group supports the laws.\n\nAccording to the ADL\u2019s Lieberman, no one in the United States has been criminally convicted of a hate crime against a police officer or homeless person. And in the case of police, prosecutors in most states already can turn to laws that ratchet up penalties for attacks on emergency responders. By contrast, proving that somebody attacked an officer because they were an officer is much more difficult, he said.\n\nConnecticut\u2019s law does not separately cover police, so the 20-year-old accused of hurling a brick at the cruiser in Hartford last year was charged with a hate crime for the racial element of the attack. He talked about targeting officers who were white \u2014 \u201cbecause they shoot black people,\u201d according to the arresting officer\u2019s report. The charge was later dropped.\n\nCritics sometimes point to the political bartering that can play into hate crime laws.\n\nWhen Maryland included the homeless under its statute in 2009, the Republican lawmaker behind the move was the same lawmaker who four years earlier had voiced strong objections to a proposal adding LGBT individuals to the list. Alex Mooney, then a state senator and now a West Virginia congressman, drew colleagues\u2019 ire by trying to tack on a dozen other groups, including teachers, pregnant women, and obese people, according to a news report.\n\nMost of Utah\u2019s nonconventional groups were put on by Republicans who, like Adams, made their support of Senate Bill 103 conditional on the additions. Although Adams acknowledged recently that he isn\u2019t sure what categories such as \u201cmarital status\u201d and \u201cfamilial status\u201d really mean, he would have liked for the language to be even broader \u2014 to cover \u201cheinous crimes . . . that terrorize communities, regardless of the class.\u201d\n\nLauren Simpson, policy director for Alliance for a Better Utah, a progressive advocacy and government watchdog organization, criticizes the measure as overly broad. Some lawmakers even tried to include teachers and ranchers, she says.\n\n\u201cOn the House floor, they added in political expression,\u201d she recalled. \u201cThey said this is a great way to send a message about political civility. But I think penalty enhancements are a really inappropriate tool to try and send that message.\u201d\n\n\n\nA police officer walks near where a homeless man was severely beaten in San Diego in 2016.
