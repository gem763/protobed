They urge Congress to mitigate the worst abuses of our immigration system, from unsafe conditions \u2013 in detention or third countries \u2013 to endless backlogs and convoluted legal processes.\n\nAre we approaching a turning point in US\u2019s immigration crisis? | Jackie Stevens and James Marcus Read more\n\nThe plea is commendable. But where are we as a society if we cannot dream bigger? What does it mean that some of our most beloved writers \u2013 who have laboriously envisioned new and radical worlds \u2013 didn\u2019t imagine a future that respects the right to human movement?\n\nThe writer and political theorist Mark Fisher spoke to the stagnation of our political imagination through what he called capitalist realism. The concept, he wrote, is \u201cthe widespread sense that not only is capitalism the only viable political and economic system, but also that it is now impossible even to imagine a coherent alternative to it\u201d. Following the fall of the Soviet Union, the encroachment of neoliberalism was read as a natural, inevitable progression \u2013 \u201cthe end of history\u201d, the political scientist Francis Fukuyama wrote. Mark Fisher reminds us that this sense of inevitability is no accident, that there is nothing natural about it. Though other systems might be in many ways preferable to capitalism, a lack of coherent alternatives in the public imagination leaves us resigned to a future where we fight each time more desperately for ever-smaller crumbs.\n\nAlthough Fisher tragically took his own life two years ago, his assessment reminds us that there exist futures far more radical and utopian within our reach, should we strive for them.\n\nIt\u2019s far more radical to tolerate borders \u2013 to accept this violence as normal \u2013 than it is to call for their abolition\n\nWhat does a \u201cfair trial\u201d look like on stolen land? Who has the authority to serve as arbiter of life and death? Faced with a system that fetishizes cruelty, our demands are too modest. It\u2019s far more radical to tolerate borders \u2013 to accept this violence as normal \u2013 than it is to call for their abolition.\n\nConsider Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), which has been embroiled in scandals for its treatment of detainees for months on end. Although the agency has been in existence for under two decades, it has been mythologized such that it seems impossible to live without it.\n\nStill, some are bravely calling for just that. While at first glance it may seem an impossible demand, Fisher\u2019s alternative invites us to ask: what is there to salvage in an agency that exists solely to hunt, catalogue and detain the most vulnerable among us? Scandal after scandal has shown that the rot goes far beyond a few bad apples \u2013 Ice violence is as systematic as it is cruel. A child of the war on terror, there is no Ice without a tacit agreement that immigrants present an existential threat to our wellbeing. Calls to abolish Ice challenge us to know better.\n\nThe US spends more than $7bn a year on an agency so universally reviled that even its own agents want to be distanced. What could an alternative vision of justice look like? Republicans have never shied from making policy demands, however harmful and outlandish. Democrats have a singular opportunity to put forth a bold plan for immigration premised on human dignity and the freedom of movement. Abolitionist movements have always been discredited as impossible until they are realized. It is by refusing to concede to a rightwing vision of possibility that unimaginable prospects become reality.", "description": "What is there to salvage in an agency that exists solely to hunt, catalogue and detain the most vulnerable among us?
