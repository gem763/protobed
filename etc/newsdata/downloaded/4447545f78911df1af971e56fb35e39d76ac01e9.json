You don't expect him to be as candid in his memories.\n\nWe already knew that Iger was the first Hollywood exec to work with Apple to offer its movies to digital audiences back in 2001 when the video edition of the iPod was first introduced. (Hollywood has historically been very slow to embrace new technologies.)\n\nDisney CEO Bob Iger has left the Apple board of directors. He gave no reason for his departure, nor did Apple. However, the reasons are clear.

It was a phone call that Iger initiated to request an in-person meeting for his pitch. Instead, the ever-blunt Jobs asked him to state his business, right then and there, over the phone.\n\nIger goes on to describe their negotiations over long walks, and how Jobs turned to Iger, shortly before the Pixar deal was to be announced and told him he was dying. \"I am about to become your biggest shareholder and a member of your board. I think I owe you the right, given this knowledge, to back out of the deal.\"\n\n(Iger recently stepped down from the board of directors of Apple, due to potential conflict with Apple and Disney's upcoming streaming services, which are both set to launch in November.)\n\nMostly it's a book with the inside scoop about the rise and fall of Disney under the previous CEO Michael Eisner and Iger's attempts to revive the brand with a series of massive acquisitions, told, for the first time, from his perspective.\n\nWe get stories about how Iger's breakfast meeting with George Lucas when he got the nerve to ask if the \"Star Wars\" creator would sell Lucasfilm to Disney and how Lucas was vocally upset over the new Star Wars films produced by Disney. We learn how Rupert Murdoch brought up selling 21st Century Fox over drinks at his winery and Iger's move to embrace the streaming world with the new Disney+ service, which is set to debut on Nov. 12.\n\nLeadership lessons? Not exactly. A fun read? Insight into what it's like to run a giant corporation and deal with the fires that pop up every day? Yes, indeed.\n\nAlong the way, Iger does offer some business advice \u2013 focus on the future, not yesterday, be well-read and prepared for everything, be supportive of new technology, even if it looks to disrupt your business and don't dwell on small things, like selling trombone oil, instead, look at the big picture.\n\nIger describes this as a life lesson given to him by Dan Burke, a mentor who ran the Capital Cities/ABC company (which Disney eventually bought) and who promoted Iger several times to leadership roles.\n\n\"You may become the greatest trombone-oil manufacturer in the world, but in the end, the world only consumes a few quarts of trombone oil a year,\" Iger recalls Burke telling him.\n\nIn other words, don't invest your time in small projects that take up too much time.\n\nIf you're hoping to learn more life lessons like this, you'd probably be disappointed in the Ride of a Lifetime. There's not a lot of them.\n\nAnd as candid as Iger is, he doesn't reveal nada about why Disney doesn't have a succession plan in place for a CEO who has delayed his announced retirement, or address concerns about his outsize $65 million yearly compensation compared to the low salaries of rank and file Disney employees.\n\nPerhaps asking him to do so is like wishing upon a star, but it would have been welcome.\n\nFollow USA TODAY's Jefferson Graham (@jeffersongraham) on Twitter.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2019/10/20/disney-ceo-igers-ride-book-has-choice-stories-jobs-and-lucas/3835768002/", "description": "CEO recalls years running ABC and Disney, and acquiring Marvel, LucasFilm, Pixar and 20th Century Fox, with candor, inside stories and leadership tips", "authors": ["Jefferson Graham", "Published A.M.
