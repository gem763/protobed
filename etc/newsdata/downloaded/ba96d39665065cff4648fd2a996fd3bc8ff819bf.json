But it was slammed by Labour\u2019s leadership and the TUC as not worth the paper it\u2019s written on.\n\nBoris Johnson began speaking in the Commons at 9.30am with the final vote expected this afternoon.\n\nIf the motion fails or lapses he must request a delay to the October 31 deadline by 11pm tonight. Read our explainer on what's in the deal here, and our guide to how 'Super Saturday' will pan out here.\n\nWe will also be posting live updates below.", "description": "A huge People's Vote demonstration will be held in Central London as MPs hold their first Saturday session since 1982 to consider Boris Johnson's controversial deal", "authors": ["Ben Glaze", "Mikey Smith", "Nicola Bartlett", "Dan Bloom", "Oliver Milne", "Dave Burke"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20652627.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_BRITAIN-EU-POLITICS-BREXIT.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
