The trouble is, no one seems to care, despite blockchain being touted as \u201cthe next big thing.\u201d\n\nThe biggest blockchain ETF, the Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF (BLOK), is up 24% year to date. The S&P 500, as measured by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY), is up 18.5%. Yet investors have yanked $15 million in net assets from BLOK year to date. The fund has seen only one day of positive flows so far in 2019.\n\nOther blockchain ETFs are also seeing negative net asset flows this year. The Reality Shares Nasdaq NexGen Economy ETF (BLCN) and the Innovation Shares NextGen Protocol ETF (KOIN) are also handily beating SPY this year (as the chart below shows), but both funds are faced with net redemptions year to date.\n\nChart courtesy of StockCharts.com\n\nGood performance has done little to attract investor dollars to this corner of the market.\n\nThis apparent lack of appetite for blockchain funds, most of which debuted about a year ago, could be tied to two main factors:\n\nNo 1: Aversion To Risk\n\nInvestor appetite for riskier pockets of the market has been muted\u2014at best\u2014this year.\n\nBlockchain as a segment of the equity market is perhaps the epitome of growth, as blockchain-linked companies tread the cutting edge of new technology. Many have yet to understand what blockchain is and how it works.\n\nThat\u2019s a segment that doesn\u2019t quite fit the overarching\u2014prevailing\u2014narrative this year: that investors ought to play it safe in the face of global macroeconomic and geopolitical head winds. Growth stocks are risky; technology growth stocks are particularly so.\n\nA look at ETF asset flows this year shows an increasing aversion to risk. U.S. and international equity ETFs faced $22 billion in net outflows last month alone. Year to date, equity ETFs have attracted less than half the fresh net assets U.S. and international fixed income funds have\u2014this has been a year for safety plays.\n\nNo. 2: Lacking \u2018Proof Of Concept\u2019\n\nAlso weighing on blockchain ETFs could be a perceived lack of \u201cproof of concept\u201d when it comes to blockchain\u2019s early-on promise of revolutionizing all sorts of industries.\n\nTo many, blockchain remains the difficult-to-understand technology behind cryptocurrencies, and nothing more. That\u2019s actually not a far-fetched perception, according to Christian Magoon, founder of Amplify.\n\nHe noted that the performance of BLOK this year has been highly correlated to price action in bitcoin, adding to that perception. Bitcoin more than doubled in value this year, and is currently sitting around $10,500 per coin.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of development in blockchain going on,\u201d said Magoon, \u201cbut investors are looking for more projects and application beyond cryptocurrencies.\u201d\n\nHow Will Blockchain Drive Profits?\n\n\u201cFor blockchain to be a viable investment theme, we need two things,\u201d he noted. \u201cFirst, we need to have cryptos stabilize and rally; second, we need blockchain application for companies to become a driver of profits.\u201d\n\nNeither of these things is yet in place. Yes, bitcoin has rallied sharply this year, but many have been looking for a corrective move that took bitcoin off recent highs such as backing up toward support levels around $8,000. It\u2019s a market that\u2019s still very volatile.\n\nStory continues", "description": "These funds have been delivering quite a performance, but demand is not following.", "authors": ["Cinthia Murphy"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/_pIRuS1Qhd6q87tUwiPMwA--~B/aD0zNDY7dz01MjA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/indexuniverse.com/a111b7aac639778511ea615a504c082a", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
