(Rick Osentoski/AP Photo)\n\nBefore Calvin Johnson retired from the Detroit Lions, his nine-year NFL career seemingly over in its prime, he got used to suffering concussions. He conservatively estimates he suffered nine in his career.\n\n\u201cBam, hit the ground real hard. I\u2019m seeing stars; I can\u2019t see straight,\u201d he told Sports Illustrated in an interview published Friday. \u201cBut I know in a couple minutes I\u2019m going to be fine. Because I\u2019ve done that plenty of times before.\u201d\n\nHe says he changed his story about at least one head injury after being pressured by the team, and says he had his choice of drugs to deal with the pain of professional football, telling SI that all manner of narcotics were available in the training room. He chose to smoke marijuana after games.\n\nIn his retirement, Johnson is another former NFL player to relay his misgivings about the league and the game that made him famous, but left him facing an uncertain future.\n\nJohnson told the magazine he retired early, at the same age as Hall of Fame running back and former Lion Barry Sanders, saying there is a \u201cvery strong possibility\u201d he would have kept playing longer if the Lions had been more successful. Detroit asked him to hand back an estimated $1.6 million, a prorated portion of his signing bonus, something the team was fully entitled to do, but Johnson found the request petty. You don\u2019t ask one of your franchise\u2019s legendary players to give back what amounts to a rounding error where NFL salaries are concerned, he reasoned.\n\nNow Johnson said he has no plans to set foot in the Lions\u2019 facility or at a team event. He told Detroit Coach Matt Patricia he would help train the team\u2019s receivers, but somewhere off-site.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t necessarily say I cheer for the Lions,\u201d Johnson told SI. \u201cI cheer for the players.\u201d\n\nHe thought about leaving football a year earlier because of the constant pain he endured, but didn\u2019t feel certain about the decision, so he came back to play one more year.\n\nIn 2012, three years before he retired, he said he suffered a concussion against the Vikings, then reentered and finished the game. The Lions continue to insist Johnson passed the league\u2019s concussion protocol that day. Johnson in the week after the game, apologized and said he used terms \u201cconcussion\u201d and \u201cnerve damage\u201d incorrectly. Now, he\u2019s saying something else.\n\n\u201cI knew I was concussed because I blacked out. I wasn\u2019t seeing straight,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they wanted me to change my story.\u201d\n\nThat was part of the dysfunction, he told SI, that contributed to his departure from football. Now, though, Johnson is in control. He runs Locker Room Consulting, a firm that helps athletes prepare for life after sports, and a cannabis dispensary called Primitive.\n\nWhen Detroit went 0-16 in 2008, the first time an NFL team went winless in a 16-game season, Johnson recalled quarterback Jon Kitna walked out of a meeting with a premonition.\n\n\u201cHe left the meeting room one day, and he told the coaches and the whole team that we\u2019re not going to win a game if we go into the season with [this] system,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cSomebody should have listened. Because we were 0-16 after that.\u201d\n\nRead more from The Post:\n\nHow Michael Vick\u2019s dogfighting case changed animal welfare\n\nKansas to reportedly receive NCAA notice of major violations within basketball program\n\nIranian judo team suspended after athlete pressured to avoid fighting an Israeli\n\nIn diverse Toronto, the Raptors\u2019 sports hijab is hailed as a win for inclusivity", "description": "The six-time Pro Bowl receiver said the Lions \"want to change my story\" on his history of concussions.", "authors": ["Jacob Bogage", "National Sports Writer", "September At Am", "Jacob Bogage Writes About Sports For The Post", "Where He Has Worked Since He Previously Covered The Automotive", "Manufacturing Industries For The Business Section."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/QPoEQtrCdBupiw_xo-edJheDNvc=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/E46JFCW37EI6TINFCYVYVHE4UI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
