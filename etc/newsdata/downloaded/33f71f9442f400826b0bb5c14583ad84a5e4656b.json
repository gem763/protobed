It's one rule for you and another for everyone else.\n\n'You can identify with 100 different genders but as soon as I identify as a two-spirit penguin, you go nuts.'\n\nMr Butterworth claimed Piers' comments on transgender 'make a mockery of a vulnerable minority'.\n\nHe told the programme: 'The way you talk about non-binary and trans people is you mock them, you use them as a form of entertainment.\n\n'Being a penguin isn't a gender, it's not on the gender spectrum.\n\n'There will be people watching this programme, who aren't sure of their identity, who are vulnerable, who are transgender or non-binary and they're going to hear you mocking them.\n\n'I watched GMTV religiously as a child and I was gay. If I'd have seen that it would have been very dangerous.'\n\nBut Piers argued he believes the idea of 100 genders is a mockery of those who have gone through the transition process.\n\nToday gay activist Ben Butterworth (pictured) appeared on Good Morning Britain alongside transgender broadcaster India Willoughby to debate the petition to get Piers Morgan sacked\n\nThe Good Morning Britain presenter was faced with a petition calling for him to be fired after claiming he identifies as a 'two-spirit penguin'\n\nHe said: 'The reason I identified as a two spirit penguin, is not to mock transgender people, but because I think it makes a mockery of people who have transitioned.'\n\nHe turned to Mr Butteworth's fellow guest India Willoughby and said: 'The reason I feel so incensed about the idea of 100 genders is...\n\n'Imagine being India Willoughby, who has gone through transition, which is a long and painful process.\n\n'When you finally get there, having wanted to be there your whole life, it's actually meaningless.'\n\nHe added: 'Near where I grew up in Brighton, there are now 85 kids that identify as gender fluid.\n\n'It's nonsense, it's confusing people. You've got kids watching this problem, hearing there are 100 different ways to identify your gender. It's dangerous.'\n\nMusician Kennedy called for the presenter to be sacked for his 'dangerous dehumanisation of transgender and non-binary individuals'\n\nA counter-petition demanding Piers remain in post for his 'common sense approach to life' has now surpassed it with 25,000 signatories\n\nMs Willougby agreed with Piers, claiming the 'mockery' she thinks some LGBT activists have made of the transgender debate has made her ashamed to identify as trans.\n\nShe told the programme: 'Piers is a beacon of light.\n\n'It took me half a lifetime to become who I am today. Most 'transitioners', which is what I call them now, they have no commitment, they float from this that.\n\n'I no longer identify as trans, because it's become so embarrassing, I'm ashamed. I don't accept there are 100 genders.'\n\nBut Mr Butterworth claimed he has also been mocked his whole life and should be allowed to debate gender identity.\n\nHe said: 'Imagine being criticised from the day you are born, by your friends, your school.'\n\nBut Ms Willoughby interjected: 'I don't need any gay people to represent me. Being trans isn't the same as being gay.\n\n'Have you got any gender issues?'\n\nMr Butterworth replied that he is a cisgender male.\n\nHe continued: 'Piers calls me a snowflake, but there's nothing harder than having the guts to be who you are.'\n\nBut Ms Willoughby said: 'You're not transgender. You have a real transgender person here telling you. My life has been made more miserable because of what you're saying.\n\n'It has affected my career, I've lost work, because of what is happening to the transgender community and debate.'\n\nToday GMB's poll asking if Piers should be sacked over his transgender comments tipped in favour of him being fired.\n\nYesterday, a counter petition to keep him and his 'common sense approach to life' was winning.\n\nPiers's original comments were made in September in response to a BBC film that claims there are more than 100 genders.\n\nThe GMB anchor was further infuriated by a report staff at the London Aquarium have decided the baby of a lesbian penguin couple should be raised gender neutral.\n\nHe responded to calls for him to be sacked on Twitter, posting: 'You can't remove me, I'm currently identifying as a penguin so it would be animal cruelty.'\n\nOn yesterday's programme he asked: 'Why can't I be a two-spirit penguin, why can't I just decide that's what I identity as?'\n\nCo-host Susanna Reid asked if that was how is currently identifying, to which he replied: Yes, I've been a penguin for a week now.'\n\nBut he joked: 'Now I'm a penguin, I don't want anyone to be called he, she, they or them.\n\n'Because you become exclusionary to me as a penguin. I want all the language around this programme to be changed now to reflect the fact I am now identifying as a penguin.'\n\nContinuing on a more serious note he said: I'm not remotely transphobic.\n\n'I do think however having 100 genders is utter nonsense. I think it's going to be extremely dangerous to teach kids this. And I speak as a father-of-four.'\n\nPiers Morgan laughed in the face of a petition calling him to be sacked from Good Morning Britain over comments he made about the transgender community\n\nIndia Willoughby weighed in on the debate yesterday, quipping: ''If the petition succeeds, @PiersMorgan should be replaced by a trans woman #NoLoyaltyInThisBiz #PiersMorgan.'\n\nThe Remove Piers Morgan from Good Morning Britain petition states: 'In being an award-winning breakfast programme with a worldwide reach, one could presume that Good Morning Britain would act as an effective platform to educate the masses on these issues.\n\n'In keeping Piers Morgan as the programme's main draw, however, ITV are actively choosing to promote an insidious agenda against transgender people (and minorities in general), as through his choice of language he regularly berates and mocks those who do not identify in a way he is willing to comprehend.'\n\nBut GMB viewer Margaret Lowry decided to launch a counter petition, writing: 'Keep Piers Morgan for his common sense approach to life. He's also funny!!\n\n'He's not afraid to speak out and says what a lot of us are thinking.'\n\nPiers thanked Margaret for her support on Twitter, writing: 'Please sign it if you wish to repel the snivelling snowflakes & keep me in my job.'\n\nHe later urged his millions of followers: 'Save me as your voice against the shriekingly illiberal liberals who want to cancel everyone who dares challenge them...'", "description": "Good Morning Britain presenter Piers Morgan was yesterday faced with a petition calling for him to be fired after claiming he identifies as a 'two-spirit penguin'.", "authors": ["Lara Keay For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/09/19729992-0-image-a-136_1571127449684.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
