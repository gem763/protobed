We was just talking a bunch of s***. I went home and then he left.\n\n\"I was home sleeping [when he was shot]. They wouldn't let me see him.\"\n\nTyson was rebuilding his career following his shock defeat by James 'Buster' Douglas when he met Tupac.\n\nThen 20, the rapper was attempting to gain entry to a party in Los Angeles hosted by basketball legend Magic Johnson.\n\n(Image: Reuters)\n\nAfter The Bell: Watch Mirror Fighting's new boxing show Mirror Fighting has launched a new weekly boxing show in association with Betfair in which we analyse the latest big fights, play matchmaker, and preview forthcoming bouts.

I didn't know he was famous like that.\"\n\nTupac would visit Tyson repeatedly in prison while the pair also spoke on the phone.\n\n(Image: The LIFE Images Collection via G)\n\nBut during Tyson's spell behind bars, his friend would also be arrested on sexual assault charges and sentenced to his own term inside.\n\nHe would serve nine months before being released in October 1995, 11 months before he was shot.\n\n\"When I came back in 1995 and I was fighting Bruce Seldon, he came to the fight,\" Tyson has said.\n\n\"Man, he was very excited because we had both been incarcerated and we both came out and we were very successful, like we both thought we would be.\"\n\nBut Tupac would never realise his full potential - and Tyson lost his world title in his next fight, the first installment of his rivalry with Evander Holyfield.\n\n\"I\u2019m glad to be a part of his life and to have known him,\" the boxer said. \"Of all the things Mike Tyson can regret in his life \u2013 you know that whole rape thing, the jail thing, the biting the ear thing \u2013 his biggest regret is not smoking with 'Pac.\"", "description": "Tupac Shakur was shot dead following Tyson's heavyweight fight against Bruce Seldon in 1996", "authors": ["Martin Domin", "Image", "Tupac Shakur Instagram", "Reuters", "The Life Images Collection Via G"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20706202.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Tupac-and-Mike-Tyson.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
