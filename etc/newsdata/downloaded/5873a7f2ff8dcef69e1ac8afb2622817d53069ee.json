Ukraine Expert Says White House Sidelined Him", "language": "en", "text": "President Donald Trump listens to Vice President Mike Pence during a ceremony presenting the Presidential Medal of Freedom to former Attorney General Edwin Meese in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, on Tuesday, Oct. 8, 2019. (Doug Mills/The New York Times)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 A senior State Department official in charge of Ukraine policy told impeachment investigators Tuesday that he was all but cut out of decisions regarding the country after a May meeting organized by Mick Mulvaney, the White House chief of staff, describing his sidelining by President Donald Trump\u2019s inner circle as \u201cwrong,\u201d according to a lawmaker who heard the testimony.\n\nThe revelation from George P. Kent, the deputy assistant secretary in the Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs, emerged as he became the latest top administration official to submit to hours of closed-door testimony to the House committees investigating how Trump pressured Ukraine to investigate his political rivals.\n\nDespite an edict by the White House not to cooperate with what it has called an illegitimate inquiry, Kent was one of a procession of top officials who have made the trip to the secure rooms of the House Intelligence Committee on Capitol Hill to sit for hours with impeachment investigators, unspooling a remarkably consistent tale. They have detailed how Trump sought to manipulate U.S. policy in Ukraine to meet his goals, circumventing career diplomats and policy experts and inserting his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani into the process, raising alarms in the West Wing and throughout the government.\n\n\u201cHere is a senior State Department official responsible for six countries, one of which is Ukraine, who found himself outside of a parallel process that he felt was undermining 28 years of U.S. policy and promoting the rule of law in Ukraine,\u201d Rep. Gerald E. Connolly, D-Va., said of Kent, after emerging from the room where he was being deposed.\n\n\u201cAnd that was wrong,\u201d Connolly said. \u201cHe used that word, \u2018wrong.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAfter the May 23 meeting called by Mulvaney, Kent told investigators, he and others whose portfolios included Ukraine were edged out by Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union; Kurt Volker, the special envoy for Ukraine; and Rick Perry, the energy secretary, who \u201cdeclared themselves the three people now responsible for Ukraine policy,\u201d Connolly said.\n\nKent said he was told at another point to \u201clay low\u201d on Ukraine matters.\n\nThe accounts are trickling out even as the White House seeks to block even more information from surfacing in the impeachment inquiry. Vice President Mike Pence on Tuesday defied a request by the investigators for documents related to the inquiry, and the Defense Department, the Office of Management and Budget, and Giuliani all gave notice that they would defy subpoenas to turn over material. All of them cited the lack of a House vote authorizing the impeachment inquiry as grounds for stonewalling.\n\nIn a sternly worded response to an unusual request for documents, Matthew E. Morgan, the counsel to the vice president, accused the committees of requesting material that is \u201cclearly not vice-presidential records\u201d and blasted the investigation enterprise as a \u201cself-proclaimed \u2018impeachment inquiry\u2019 \u201d that was ultimately illegitimate.\n\nBut House Democratic leaders, who spent much of Tuesday privately polling their rank-and-file members about whether to hold such a vote \u2014 a move that could carry political risks and which they have resisted \u2014 said they were not planning one.\n\n\u201cThere is no requirement that we have a vote,\u201d said Speaker Nancy Pelosi. \u201cWe\u2019re not here to call bluffs, we\u2019re here to find the truth.\u201d\n\nKent spent more than seven hours sequestered with investigators, discussing concerns he long ago raised with State Department colleagues about the pressure being directed at Ukraine by Trump and Giuliani to open investigations into the president\u2019s political rivals.\n\nWitness interviews and public records have now confirmed key elements of an anonymous CIA whistleblower complaint that accused Trump of abusing his power to gain an advantage in the 2020 presidential election, though critical questions remain unanswered.\n\n\u201cEvery witness we have heard thus far has corroborated the basic narrative,\u201d Rep. Tom Malinowski, D-N.J., a former State Department official involved in the House investigation. \u201cAt first gradually and then completely, official policy was replaced by a shadow policy run by Giuliani that had as its objective not our national interest but the president\u2019s political interest.\u201d", "description": "WASHINGTON -- A senior State Department official in charge of Ukraine policy told impeachment investigators Tuesday that he was all but cut out of decisions regarding the country after a May meeting organized by Mick Mulvaney, the White House chief of staff, describing his sidelining by President Donald", "authors": ["Nicholas Fandos", "Kenneth P.
