(Jae C. Hong/AP)\n\n\u201cPedo guy,\u201d the insult Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk notoriously slung at a Thai cave rescuer last summer, doesn\u2019t mean what you think it does.\n\nIt does not mean that somebody is actually a \u201cpedophile guy,\u201d or that he is a criminal pedophile who preys on children, Musk explained in court documents filed Monday.\n\n\u201cPedo guy\u201d is a \u201ccommon insult used in South Africa when I was growing up,\u201d the billionaire said in a declaration. \u201cIt is synonymous with \u2018creepy old man\u2019 and is used to insult a person\u2019s appearance and demeanor, not accuse a person of acts of pedophilia.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s now part of Musk\u2019s defense in the federal defamation lawsuit filed against him by the man he called \u201cpedo guy,\u201d Vernon Unsworth, a cave explorer who assisted in the famous rescue of a Thai soccer team from the flooded cave in July 2018. Musk, who attempted to assist in the rescue by building a mini submarine, attacked Unsworth on Twitter after the British man insulted Musk\u2019s rescue plan in a CNN interview.\n\nCourt documents filed Monday reveal the lengths Musk went to prove that he was justified in calling Unsworth a \u201cpedo guy\u201d \u2014 including hiring a private investigator to compile a dossier on him. Musk said in a deposition that he started to fear Unsworth could be the next Jeffrey Epstein, basing his conjecture on unsubstantiated information from the private investigator.\n\n\u201cWhat if we have another Jeffery Epstein on our hands?\u201d he said he thought.\n\n\u201cWhen I said \u2018pedo guy,\u2019 I didn\u2019t mean that he was literally a pedophile; it was just an insult. But after getting this information from this investigator,\u201d Musk said in a deposition, \u201cI was like, well, maybe he is actually a pedophile. Is this possible?\u201d\n\nNo, say Unsworth and his attorneys.\n\n\u201cThe motion filed by Elon Musk today is a disgusting and transparent effort to continue falsely smearing Vernon Unsworth without any credible or verified supporting evidence,\u201d Unsworth\u2019s attorney, L. Lin Wood, said in a statement to BuzzFeed News. \u201cMr. Unsworth\u2019s opposition to Musk\u2019s motion will reveal the whole truth of Musk\u2019s actions and the falsity of his public statements and his motion with respect to Mr. Unsworth will be exposed.\u201d\n\nThe saga began when Unsworth wounded the multibillionaire\u2019s pride during a TV interview with CNN, describing Musk\u2019s efforts to assist with the cave rescue as \u201cjust a PR stunt.\u201d Musk had mobilized more than 50 of his best engineers to put together several strategies about how they could reach the 12 members of the Thai boys\u2019 soccer team and their coach trapped in the pitch-black cavern, one of which involved evacuating them on a mini submarine, Musk explained in court documents.\n\nUnsworth, who assisted in the rescue on the ground, told CNN that Musk could \u201cstick his submarine where it hurts.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt just had absolutely no chance of working,\u201d he said.\n\nMusk said he was shocked by the insult from a person he had never met, so he decided to Google him. He said he found out Unsworth lived in Chiang Rai province in Thailand and read a random article claiming it was a \u201chot-spot for child prostitution and sex-trafficking.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s how Musk decided to send out a tweet that challenged Unsworth\u2019s involvement in the cave rescue and concluded, \u201cSorry pedo guy, you really did ask for it.\u201d\n\n[Elon Musk apologizes for \u2018pedo guy\u2019 comment: \u2018The fault is mine and mine alone\u2019]\n\nSoon, amid mass Internet backlash, Musk got an unsolicited email from a private investigator offering his services to dip into Unsworth\u2019s private life, according to court documents. It apparently sounded like a good idea to Musk.\n\nSo one of Musk\u2019s representatives retained the investigator for more than $50,000.\n\nThe investigator dug up dubious information without citing sources or providing detail about how he learned any of it \u2014 for example, speculating about the age that Unsworth\u2019s younger wife would have been when they met, but cautioning the intel hadn\u2019t been verified. Still, the speculation was enough for Musk to email a BuzzFeed News reporter to accuse Unsworth of being a \u201cchild rapist\u201d who had taken a \u201cchild bride who was about 12 years old at the time.\u201d Musk insists now the comments should have been honored as an off-the-record statement.\n\nBut BuzzFeed went ahead with the story, saying it did not agree to the conversation being off the record. Unsworth cited those comments to BuzzFeed as part of the defamation case.\n\nMusk\u2019s attorneys argue that because he did not intend for those statements to be published, and was only hoping BuzzFeed would investigate them further, it\u2019s not defamation. As for \u201cpedo guy,\u201d his attorneys argue that Musk\u2019s statement should be seen as a \u201cthrowaway insult,\u201d not a factual assertion.\n\nThey admit in their motion for summary judgment filed Monday in the Central District of California that the private investigator\u2019s dossier was not based on \u201csolid evidence,\u201d but say Musk didn\u2019t know that and was justified in basing his \u201cchild rapist\u201d statements on the investigator\u2019s claims.\n\n\u201cAlthough it turns out that the investigator lacked solid evidence of Mr. Unsworth\u2019s behavior, that does not matter here,\u201d the attorneys wrote.\n\nThe case is set for a hearing on Oct. 28 in Los Angeles.", "description": "Elon Musk also hired a private investigator for $50,000 to compile a dossier on the Thai cave diver he insulted, fearing without real evidence the man could be the next Jeffrey Epstein.", "authors": ["Meagan Flynn", "Morning Mix Reporter", "September At Am", "Meagan Flynn Is A Reporter On The Washington Post'S Morning Mix Team.
