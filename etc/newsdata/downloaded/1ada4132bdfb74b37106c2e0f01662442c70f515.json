(TSX VENTURE: GER) (\u201cGlen Eagle\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) is pleased to report that Cobra Oro, a wholly owned Honduran subsidiary of Glen Eagle, continues to export gold at record pace.\n\n\n\nIn terms of production throughput and cash flow, Cobra Oro has realized its best third quarter ever, allowing the Company to improve its balance sheet by paying back all short term debt ($280,000) accumulated from plant improvement and purchases of the chemical supplies to support its operations for an entire year to come.\n\nThe positive cash flow was achieved while processing an average of 2.3 grams of low grade ore and bringing considerable improvement to the plant.\n\nWith the land value having increased threefold over the last four years based on current prices for adjacent properties and with almost no long term debt in its books, Cobra Oro has an enviable balance sheet by mining standards.\n\nThis trend should continue to grow even stronger as the Company expects to process better grade ore by early November, which should have a significant impact on cash flow as fixed costs are well under control and Cobra\u2019s operations are being run close to maximum efficiency.\n\nJean Labrecque, President\n\nGlen Eagle Resources Inc\n\nComplexe du Canal Lachine, Suite 308\n\n4710 St-Antoine Street\n\nMontreal (Quebec)\n\nTel : 514-808-9807\n\n\u201cNeither TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.\u201d Values in the news release are quoted in Canadian dollars.\n\n\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["Glen Eagle Resources Inc."], "top_image": "http://www.globenewswire.com/Attachment/LogoDisplay/523496?filename=523496.jpg&size=1", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
