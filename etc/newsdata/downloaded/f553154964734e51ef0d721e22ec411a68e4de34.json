(Keith Srakocic/AP)\n\nIn an era of launch angle, as hitters try to hit the ball farther and harder and in the air, there\u2019s a renewed emphasis on defense in the outfield. The Washington Nationals outfield is, according to advanced metrics, average at the corners with a star in the middle. It\u2019s taken a lot of work to make it that way, so this week, we\u2019re looking at those three outfield spots by zeroing in on one each morning. We started in left, let\u2019s move to center.\n\nVictor Robles yo-yoed on an invisible string. The Washington Nationals center fielder shaded three steps from dead center toward left field, then toward right, then back again. He moved more than any outfielder Monday against the New York Mets, and though he registered none of the diving catches and cannon throws with which he has stuffed highlight reels this season, the small tweaks he made for the outfield were important.\n\nThe movement was partly from the scouting report and partly necessity \u2014 he can\u2019t see the batter from straightaway center \u2014 but mostly it was because of the pitcher. Robles understood the Nationals\u2019 starter, right-hander Joe Ross, favored his two-seam fastball. He thought the speed and break of the pitch was difficult to pull, so he played almost every batter of Ross\u2019s outing \u2014 save Jeff McNeil and slugger Pete Alonso \u2014 as if they would go opposite field. The Nationals trust Robles to control the outfield, and he truly assumed the responsibility in early June after sitting down with new teammate and two-time Gold Glove award winner Gerardo Parra.\n\n\u201cHe told me I had a lot of ability, a lot of great ability, and to take advantage of it,\u201d Robles said in Spanish through a team interpreter. \u201cEver since then, it\u2019s like an extra boost of confidence \u2026 and [it] helped me with my game overall.\u201d\n\n[Juan Soto is improving his defense one step at a time]\n\nThe wow-worthy moments \u2014 the assist at third against the Cincinnati Reds, the sprint and diving catch against the Chicago White Sox \u2014 don\u2019t happen without these subtle adjustments throughout a game. Neither do the 11 assists, which ties him for third in the majors. The steps to the side in the outfield are steps forward, and they showcase the 22-year-old rookie\u2019s rapid growth from his zealous mistakes of spring, when he overthrew cutoff men or fired toward the wrong base.\n\nThey make him one of the best outfielders in the game, if you listen to the Nationals as well as advanced metrics, and they explain why Manager Dave Martinez said opposing coaches tell him: \u201cMan, your center fielder is unbelievable.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to win a Gold Glove,\u201d Martinez said of Robles. \u201cMaybe two, three, four, five, six.\u201d\n\nThe growth of Robles\u2019s game is \u201cnot magical,\u201d outfield coordinator Bob Henley said. Every afternoon, at 3:30 at home or 2:30 on the road, Robles and Henley meet in the outfield. Robles goes out that early because he likes the quiet of an empty stadium and focuses better without the chaos of batting practice.\n\nRobles sets up about three-quarters of the way between second base and the center field wall, his regular positioning, and fields 25 to 35 balls while acting out different situations. He uses the road work sessions to study the park dimensions and where he wants to position against batters. He plays balls off the wall and watches how they roll through a cut of grass. During the grind of a long season, Henley sometimes suspects Robles might be too tired to field before the game.\n\n\u201cI would throw my hands up and say: \u2018Hey, not a problem. It\u2019s been every day for months, so take a breather,\u2019 \u201d Henley said. \u201cIt\u2019s just not the case. Every day, I hear: \u2018Hey, Bob! Bob!\u2019 \u201d\n\nAs this season wore on, Robles became familiar with the swings of frequent opponents and took it upon himself to adapt the outfield\u2019s approach. He became the point of communication between the outfield and Henley, and he directs his neighbors, usually Juan Soto in left and Adam Eaton in right. Robles and Eaton played normal opposite-field defense against Mets catcher Ren\u00e9 Rivera while shading Soto over even more. For J.D. Davis, Robles and Soto played normal opposite field while Eaton stayed put.\n\nThe entire unit pushed deeper for power hitters such as Alonso and Davis, and they took a few steps in against pitcher Noah Syndergaard. The Nationals mostly calibrate batter to batter, but Robles occasionally does pitch to pitch, as he did Monday by shading McNeil more to pull when he got ahead of Ross.\n\n\u201cYou understand that he\u2019s starting to get that feeling that this is his center field,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cThe two guys in the corners, those are his guys \u2026 It\u2019s really nice.\u201d\n\nSometimes hitters beat the shift by going the opposite direction, like Davis\u2019s pull single to left, or hitting it over their head, like Joe Panik\u2019s double in the right-center gap. But outfielders do what they can to prevent it, including compensating for their own weaknesses. Robles said every outfielder has one direction \u2014 back, forward, left or right \u2014 that they like going in and one they don\u2019t.\n\n\u201cMy cheat side is to the left side, to right-field side,\u201d Robles said. \u201cI feel like I'm not as good covering ground in that direction because of where my glove is positioned.\u201d\n\nStanding at his locker in a tank top and shorts, Robles pantomimed running with his glove tucked into his shoulder, shielded from the ball by his body. Robles likes diving with his wrist up, rather than out. He compensates for this slight discomfort by positioning himself a step or two farther from where he wants to be. He hopes it\u2019ll make it easier to get to a ball in that direction.\n\n[Joe Ross struggles in a loss to the Mets, forcing the Nationals to reexamine a difficult question]\n\nRobles will modify the defense\u2019s approach further depending on the scouting report. If the batter likes to try to leg-out hustle doubles, he might play a step in. If it\u2019s a close game and there\u2019s a runner on second who could score on a groundball up the middle, it might be two or three.\n\nMistakes still pop up occasionally, but Robles prepares for those, too. One of his favorite afternoon drills forces him to pretend he gets a poor read or jump on a flyball and compensate. The familiarity with that situation prevents panic, and it helped Monday. He was in the right spot when, in the seventh inning, Mets shortstop Amed Rosario lined sharply to medium-deep center, just to Robles\u2019s left, his weak side. Robles opened up toward the right just as he realized the ball was slicing back the other way.\n\n\u201cI read it wrong,\u201d he said.\n\nThe young center fielder twisted his body back the other way. He maintained his balance, backpedaled and snared the ball. He had, not for the first time, adjusted on the fly.\n\nRead more on the Nationals:\n\nPerspective: The Nats can\u2019t let Anthony Rendon \u2014 his bat, his glove, his personality \u2014 get away\n\nJuan Soto is improving his defense one step at a time\n\nAnalysis: Sean Doolittle is a great teammate.
