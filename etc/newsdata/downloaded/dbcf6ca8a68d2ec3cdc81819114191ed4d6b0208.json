USA TODAY\n\nThe Los Angeles Rams aren't done dealing.\n\nAhead of Tuesday's NFL trade deadline, the Rams agreed to send cornerback Aqib Talib to the Miami Dolphins, the teams confirmed on Twitter.\n\nESPN's Adam Schefter was the first to report the news. The Rams will also send a fifth-round pick along with Talib in exchange for a late-round future pick, according to Schefter.\n\nThe Rams had already reshaped their secondary by acquiring cornerback Jalen Ramsey from the Jacksonville Jaguars and sending cornerback Marcus Peters to the Baltimore Ravens.\n\nThe move allows Los Angeles to save on the approximately $4.5 million remaining salary on Talib's contract, which expires after this season.\n\nTalib, 33, was placed on injured reserve with a rib injury on Oct. 14 and cannot play again until missing at least eight games, leaving Week 15 as the earliest possible point for a return.\n\nFollow Michael Middlehurst-Schwartz on Twitter @MikeMSchwartz.", "description": "The Los Angeles Rams swung another deal involving a member of their secondary, as they sent Aqib Talib to the Miami Dolphins.", "authors": ["Michael Middlehurst-Schwartz", "Published P.M.
