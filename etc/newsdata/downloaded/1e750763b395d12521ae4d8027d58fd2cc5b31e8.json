Now managing over $150 billion, Dalio has been steadily building a legacy outside of Bridgewater.\n\n\n\n\u201dWell, at every phase in anyone's life there's a difference in what one defines success. For me at this stage, my definition for success is to help people be successful without me. In other words, to pass along. And to watch beauty happen. I'm 70 years old. I don't want any more success myself. I just want to help pass that along. And if I can do that, that'll be success for me. And then I'll go quiet. I'm going to go quiet in about a year, year and a half, I think,\u201d he told Yahoo Finance in an interview at TechCrunch Disrupt in San Francisco.\n\nRay Dalio, founder, co-chief investment officer and co-chairman of Bridgewater Associates, speaks at the 2017 Forbes Under 30 Summit in Boston, Massachusetts, U.S. October 2, 2017.

I want really an idea meritocracy, that's the most important thing. And so the tools allow that.\u201d\n\nOne tool that Dalio wants to pass along is his Dot Collector app, which every Bridgewater employee has on a company iPad. Employees bring the iPad and app to every meeting, giving and receiving public feedback in the form of \u201cdots.\u201d He called it \u201cour most loved and impactful tool.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt has a list of a few dozen attributes, so whenever somebody thinks something about another person\u2019s thinking, it\u2019s easy for them to convey their assessment; they simply note the attribute and provide a rating from one to 10,\u201d he explained in a 2017 Ted Talk.\n\nLine for Ray Dalio's book signing More\n\nSo what about \u201cPrinciples\u201d seems to be resonating with the world? \u201cTo know how to fail well. You know, to realize it's the path to success,\u201d he told Yahoo Finance. \u201cTo know that knowing how to deal with one's not knowing is more important than anything one knows. To know how to have an idea meritocracy. And to know how to have fun and go after your dreams and make that happen. So it's a kick to pass that along,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nMelody Hahm is a senior correspondent at Yahoo Finance, covering entrepreneurship, technology and culture.
