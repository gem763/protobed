Kanter fired off another tweet in the face of James\u2019 comments.\n\nNBA PLAYER ENES KANTER EXPLAINS WHY HE CAN'T LEAVE US\n\n\u201cI\u2019m MORE than an Athlete,\u201d wrote the 6-foot-11-inch Kanter.\n\nKanter, 27, also appeared in front of the Massachusetts state House of Representatives to tell lawmakers about his own fight for freedom from the Turkish government.\n\nIn an op-ed written for the Boston Globe this week, Kanter revealed he was harassed by people he called sympathizers of the Recep Tayyip Erdogan regime in Turkey as he and his teammate Tacko Fall were leaving a mosque in Boston. He vowed he was not going to stay silent even as he continually receives death threats.\n\n\u201cProfessional athletes have an enormous opportunity to be a source of inspiration for the younger generation, lead by example, and prove to them that as long as you stand up for what you believe in, everything is possible,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI am looking forward to giving my best to the Boston Celtics and enjoying this new chapter of my NBA career with people in this great city who have welcomed me warmly.\n\nCELTICS\u2019 ENES KANTER APPEARS TO TAKE SHOTS AT LEBRON JAMES OVER HIS CRITICISM OF HONG KONG TWEET\n\n\u201cI have a prominent platform and I want to use it to promote respect for human rights, democracy and personal freedom. For me, this is bigger than basketball. Being a champion of tens of thousands of voiceless people back in my home country carries a risk that includes death threats and arrest warrants.\u201d\n\nWhile the NBA bickers with China over Morey\u2019s tweet and the economic fallout, Kanter sought this week to remind everyone what he\u2019s facing every day.\n\n\u201cFREEDOM IS NOT FREE,\u201d he wrote at the end of a list he tweeted.\n\nFLASHBACK: PORTLAND TRAIL BLAZERS STAR ENES KANTER, FEARING TURKISH RETALIATION, WON'T GO ANYWHERE ALONE EXCEPT BATHROOM\n\nThe hatred from Turkey stems from Kanter\u2019s support of Fethullah Gulen, an exiled Muslim cleric and Erdogan rival, compounding his status as a political target of the Turkish government. Gulen had been accused of being behind the 2016 coup attempt in Turkey, and Ankara has repeatedly demanded the U.S. extradite him from his compound in Pennsylvania so he can face charges.\n\nWhile the NBA did not strike back against China when the government blacked out games from its social media streaming platforms, the league has shown some support for Kanter.\n\nThe NBA terminated its relationship with a social media vendor in May after the league\u2019s official Turkish social media account omitted Kanter from posts. The NBA\u2019s deputy commissioner and chief operating officer, Mark Tatum, said the Turkish account was managed by a local vendor.\n\nIn March, Kanter admitted he receives death threats on a weekly basis and won\u2019t go anywhere alone aside from the bathroom for fear of Turkish retaliation.\n\n\"It's very sad what's going on with my country \u2026 There is no democracy, there is no freedom, there [are] no human rights in Turkey,\u201d he told FOX 11. \u201cI'm trying to use this platform to talk about the issues going on in my country and they hate that because when I talk, it becomes a conversation and it goes viral.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nWhile Kanter is preparing for his ninth NBA season, it\u2019s clear that he does not intend to be silenced over the matter.", "description": "Boston Celtics center Enes Kanter took another subtle shot at LeBron James on Wednesday declaring himself \u201cmore than an athlete\u201d as the Lakers star took in criticism for calling a pro-Hong Kong tweet by Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey \u201cuninformed.\u201d", "authors": ["Ryan Gaydos", "Ryan Gaydos Is A Sports Reporter For Foxnews.Com", "Foxbusiness.Com.
