The former couple are pictured at their gender reveal party\n\n'She's struggling but she has a lot of support around her,' the insider allegedly told Confidential.\n\nOn Friday, Cyrell shared an image to Instagram cradling her baby bump, and wrote in the caption: 'Even if it's just you and me. We'll create our own happiness.'\n\nShe finished off her post with the hashtags 'my little prince' and 'my one and only'.\n\nClaims: An insider allegedly told The Daily Telegraph on Sunday: 'She's struggling but she has a lot of support around her'\n\n'Even if it's just you and me': Cyrell announced her split from Eden on Instagram on Friday\n\nA representative for Cyrell confirmed the split when approached by Daily Mail Australia, while one for Eden is yet to comment.\n\nShortly after posting her baby bump photo, Cyrell took to Instagram once again to share an emotional message about the demise of her relationship.\n\nIt read: 'You would think people would be happy to heart about my break-up. Are you all not happy. Was this not what you all rooted and prayed for?\n\nVocal: Cyrell took to Instagram later in the evening to share an emotional message about the demise of her relationship\n\n'Or maybe your prayers of me having a miscarriage is what you're hoping for next. We live in a sad, bad world where we wish and pray for misery on others to feel better about ourselves.\n\n'I hope this shows a reflection of the weak, sad individual you are. I may not have a partner. But my son is all I need.'\n\nWhile the brunette bombshell dramatically removed all traces of her ex from her Instagram feed, Eden left images with his former partner firmly on his page.\n\n'Bring on tonight!'

His initial response was shock and disbelief, but he eventually came around to the idea.\n\nWhile the pregnancy is cause for celebration, the couple expressed concerns that some people will dismiss their baby as a 'publicity stunt'.\n\nCyrell admitted the negativity has been 'sad' and 'exhausting', adding: 'I wouldn't be surprised if my child is going to get called a publicity stunt.'\n\nRemember them? Cyrell was paired with electrician Nic Jovanovic (left) on this year's season of MAFS. Unlike Eden and Erin, Cyrell remains on friendly terms with her ex-'husband'\n\nEden echoed similar sentiments, saying: 'I guarantee people will say the baby is a publicity stunt. They'll say we got pregnant to stay relevant or to extend our 15 minutes of fame.'\n\nCyrell began dating Eden earlier this year, months after her 'marriage' to electrician Nic Jovanovic fell apart on MAFS.\n\nBefore dating Cyrell, Eden was in a relationship with Erin Barnett, whom he met on the first season of Love Island Australia last year.", "description": "Married At First Sight's Cyrell Paule, 31, has split from her Love Island Australia star beau Eden Dally, 27.", "authors": ["Kristy Johnson", "Nicole Douglas For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/10/20239368-0-image-a-10_1572171117511.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
