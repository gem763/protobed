The acquisition instantly broadens the cloud services Trend Micro can secure and resolves often overlooked security issues caused by cloud infrastructure misconfiguration.\n\nTrend Micro\u2019s strategy is built to ensure cloud security without disrupting how customers need to do business. This acquisition builds upon Trend Micro\u2019s continuous innovation in cloud security, adding complementary capabilities that automatically identify and fix a range of cloud infrastructure configuration issues. It also optimizes costs and helps ensure compliance with leading industry regulatory standards such as PCI, GDPR, HIPAA and NIST.\n\n\u201cWe have been laser focused on building integrated security for the cloud since its birth over a decade ago, unlike other vendors who are now attempting to stitch together disparate cloud technologies,\u201d said Eva Chen, chief executive officer for Trend Micro. \u201cAs more enterprises move to the cloud, our customers feel they\u2019re operating amid a wild-west approach to cloud implementations that leave them with unmanaged risk. As an AWS technology Partner of the Year for 2019, Cloud Conformity understands these implementations and the risks. Their offering perfectly complements our own portfolio and provides immediate value to customers. Both the people and technology are a great fit for Trend Micro.\u201d\n\nIn purposeful acquisitions, people matter as much as the technology, and Trend Micro will nurture and grow both as part of its market-leading cloud security strategy. The addition of all of Cloud Conformity\u2019s employees brings valuable expertise and experience, along with the technology, to help businesses build in the cloud more effectively, not just build securely.\n\nAccording to Gartner, \u201cThrough 2023, at least 99% of cloud security failures will be the customer\u2019s fault.\u201d1 Gartner also states, \u201cThrough 2024, organizations implementing a CSPM offering and extending this into development will reduce cloud-related security incidents due to misconfiguration by 80%.\u201d1 Trend Micro\u2019s comprehensive set of cloud security services provide assurance for businesses that their risk is effectively managed while simultaneously meeting compliance standards.\n\n\u201cOur rapid expansion with AWS, complemented by our dedication to security and compliance, is made actionable and scalable through the Cloud Conformity tool,\u201d Russell Jones, principal architect for Virgin Australia. \u201cTheir product provides us with greater visibility, the ability to improve performance and optimize costs, assuring continuous resilience as we grow.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur research is clear that organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud-based delivery and, in doing so, are often using not only compute services, but also storage, messaging, and many other services,\u201d said Fernando Montenegro, principal analyst with 451 Research. \u201cWith this acquisition, Trend Micro is able to extend its security offerings to organizations looking for assistance with cloud security beyond securing compute workloads.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are excited for the opportunities that will come from being part of the leading cloud security provider \u2013 amplifying what we do best, while allowing our offerings to expand in ways we couldn\u2019t have done on our own,\u201d said Michael Watts, chief executive officer of Cloud Conformity. \u201cWe think customers will love this simplified approach to security and compliance across their entire cloud environment, including AWS, Azure and Google Cloud \u2013 providing security guardrails to let them go faster and do more.\u201d\n\nTrend Micro is making the Cloud Conformity solution immediately available.
