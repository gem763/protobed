It is the first time that the vote disparity of the election has been judged to be constitutional.\n\nThe Akita branch of the Sendai High Court also turned down a female plaintiff's demand that the election result in the Akita electoral district, northeastern Japan, be nullified.\n\n\"The state of disparity was not to the extent that it would generate an issue of unconstitutionality,\" Presiding Judge Naoyuki Shiomi said in handing down the ruling.\n\nThe plaintiff's side immediately appealed the ruling.\n\nThis month, the Takamatsu and Sapporo high courts ruled the disparity was in a \"state of unconstitutionality,\" but stopped short of nullifying results in their local districts.\n\nIn the July election, Miyagi Prefecture had the largest number of voters per seat, while Fukui Prefecture had the fewest. In Akita, the vote weight disparity was 1.34.\n\nThe overall vote disparity was reduced from 3.08 in the previous upper house election in 2016 after Japan's parliament passed legislation in 2018 to narrow such gaps by adding six seats to the chamber and redrawing constituencies.\n\n\u00a9 KYODO", "description": "A Japanese court ruled Friday that July's upper house election was constitutional despite a disparity of up to 3.00 times in the weight of a single vote between the most and least populated constituencies.
