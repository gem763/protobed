In 2014, the now-defunct Danish game studio Glitchap had a unique idea for their jousting deathmatch project LAZA KNITEZ: price the game at $150, but offer it at a deep 98 per cent discount for the first five years. That five-year sale ends today.\n\nLAZA KNITEZ originally launched on Ouya, the ill-fated, crowdfunded console that\u2019s since been relegated to the dark annals of video game history. When the Ouya tanked, Glitchnap was looking for ways to make the game available elsewhere. They settled on the the itch.io storefront, popular among self-publishing indie creators. But when it came time to settle on a price, they began to think about the value and cost of developing video games, and they decided to create a pricing structure that would make a statement about that.\n\n\u201cWe liked the idea of offering the game on a \u2018perma-sale\u2019 that was a ridiculous deal,\u201d former Glitchnap developer Joon Van Hove told Kotaku via direct message. The studio settled on a $150 price point for LAZA KNITEZ, but would mark it down by 98 per cent, making the game only $3, but again, only for the first five years. Van Hove further described the decision as a \u201csatirical comment on the state of game pricing and sales\u201d that matched the project\u2019s aesthetics.\n\n\u201cAnd then honestly we forgot about it,\u201d Van Hove added.\n\nThe exclusivity deal with Ouya helped the Glitchnap founders get their studio off the ground. They were all university students in Copenhagen at the time, and according to Van Hove, marketing wasn\u2019t their strong suit. LAZA KNITEZ failed to find a wide audience even with the pricing stunt, which began as something of a thought experiment before spinning off into reality.\n\n\u201cIt was basically the end result of a long conversation with a bunch of game designer friends in Copenhagen,\u201d Van Hove explained. \u201cBut the question on our minds was: how do we determine the value, or worth, of something we made? The material cost is intangible, so it came down to our time. But even that is hard to answer, because this was our first game, and we had to learn everything from [the] start. So how much of that \u2018time,\u2019 even if we had logged our hours, are we entitled to recoup? Of course none of that matters because of the realities of the market, but it was still a fun thought exercise.\u201d\n\nUnlike most stories about gimmicky indie games, LAZA KNITEZ wasn\u2019t an overnight success for the folks at Glitchnap. It sold less than 200 copies, Van Hove said, but he still considers the game an \u201camazing project\u201d that helped its creators break into the gaming industry. They even did the \u201cput a competitive indie game on an arcade cabinet\u201d thing before more popular examples like Killer Queen made the scene, schlepping a custom machine cobbled together with IKEA materials to various exhibition and convention spaces around Copenhagen to show LAZA KNITEZ to the public.\n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate that LAZA KNITEZ wasn\u2019t successful, not only because it\u2019s a pretty neat game \u2014 that, I assume, is much more entertaining if you have a full group of friends to play it with \u2014 but because the pricing and discount model on which Van Hove and his fellow developers settled could have spurred an interesting conversation about the value of labour in the video game industry.\n\nGlitchnap\u2019s willingness to take risks and experiment with the pricing of their releases might have provided a compelling wrinkle in today\u2019s world, where support for unionization and workers\u2019 rights are on the rise. With one day left in the sale, it might not be too late for that conversation to start.\n\n\u201cAnd if anybody\u2019s wondering, yeah, we\u2019ll leave it up at $150 until the heat death of the universe,\u201d Van Hove said with LAZA KNITEZ flair. \u201cUntil the four horsemen and women of the ultr-a-pocalypse ride out to do lazer-space-battle for all eternity.\u201d", "description": "In today\u2019s crowded video game market, getting eyes on your product can be a challenge, especially if you develop and publish games independently and with a small team.
