Apple\u2019s colorful new iPhone has two 12-megapixel cameras: one ultra-wide-angle camera, and one wide-angle camera.\n\nLike the pricier iPhones, it also supports Apple\u2019s new night mode, portrait mode, and new smart HDR for photos.\n\nBut the iPhone 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max have a third 12-megapixel telephoto camera in addition to the two 12-megapixel ultra-wide-angle and wide-angle lenses. As such, they offer more advanced zooming \u2013 while the iPhone 11 can zoom out up to 2x and digitally up to 5x, the Pro models can zoom in 2x, zoom out 2x, and digitally zoom up to 10x.\n\nAnd, of course, the Pro models also have the other features available on the iPhone 11, like night mode, portrait mode, and smart HDR.\n\nRead more: The iPhone 11 camera design is being roasted on Twitter\n\nDisplay\n\nsource Business Insider/Lisa Eadicicco\n\nThe most important difference between the displays on Apple\u2019s newest iPhones is that the iPhone 11 features a liquid crystal display, or LCD, while the iPhone 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max include an organic light-emitting diode, or OLED, screen.\n\nThat means the pricier iPhones\u2019 screens should offer better contrast and deeper blacks than the iPhone 11\u2019s.\n\nOf course, the phones\u2019 screen sizes are also different. The iPhone 11 features a 6.1-inch screen, just like last year\u2019s iPhone XR, while the iPhone 11 Pro\u2019s measures 5.8 inches and the 11 Pro Max\u2019s is 6.5 inches \u2013 these, too, echo the screen sizes of last year\u2019s iPhones.\n\nThe more expensive iPhones also support HDR and pack more pixels per inch (458 versus the iPhone 11\u2019s 326).\n\nThe displays on the iPhone 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max have resolutions of 2436 x 1125 and 2688 x 1242, while the iPhone 11\u2019s screen has a resolution of 1792 x 828.\n\nThe iPhone 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max\u2019s screens are also brighter than the iPhone 11\u2019s \u2013 they can reach a peak brightness of 800 nits, compared with the iPhone 11\u2019s 625 nits.\n\nColors and design\n\nsource Reuters\n\nThere\u2019s another big difference between these new phones that you can spot just by looking at them: their design and the colors they\u2019re available in.\n\nThe iPhone 11 is constructed of glass and aluminum and has a slick, glossy feel much like last year\u2019s iPhone XR, while the iPhone 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max have a textured, matte back made of glass and stainless steel.\n\nThe iPhone 11 also comes in more color options than its pricier siblings. The iPhone 11 is available in purple, yellow, green, black, white, and red, while the 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max come in a new midnight-green shade, silver, space gray, and gold.\n\nRead more: Apple is releasing a $39 clear case to show off the gorgeous colors of the new iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro\n\nDurability\n\nsource Apple\n\nApple says the new iPhones come with the toughest glass ever in a smartphone, which should make them more durable than their predecessors.\n\nHowever, there is another key difference in their durability: Apple says the iPhone 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max are water-resistant up to a depth of 4 meters for 30 minutes, while the iPhone 11 is water-resistant only up to 2 meters for the same period of time.\n\nStorage capacity\n\nsource Apple\n\nApple is also offering its iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro models with different storage capacities.\n\nThe iPhone 11 will come with 64 GB, 128 GB, or 256 GB of storage, while the Pro models will be available with 64 GB, 256 GB, and 512 GB capacities.\n\nRead more: Apple is including a new, faster charger with its more expensive iPhone 11 Pro that will charge your phone up halfway in 30 minutes\n\nPricing\n\nsource Apple\n\nAs their names imply, the Pro models are also noticeably more expensive than the iPhone 11.\n\nThe iPhone 11 costs $700 for the 64 GB model, $750 for the 128 GB model, and $850 for the 250 GB model.\n\nThe iPhone 11 Pro is priced at $1,000 for the 64 GB version, $1,150 for the 256 GB edition, and $1,350 for the 512 GB model.\n\nFor the iPhone 11 Pro Max, Apple is charging $1,100 for 64 GB, $1,250 for 256 GB, and $1,450 for 512 GB.\n\nHere\u2019s a more complete look at the iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, and iPhone 11 Pro Max\u2019s specs.\n\nNow tell us what you think!", "description": "Business Insider - Apple's iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, and iPhone 11 Pro Max have some key differences when it comes to their colors, pricing, and specs..
