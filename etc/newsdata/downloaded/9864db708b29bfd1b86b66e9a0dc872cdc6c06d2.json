Clear analysis. Everything you\u2019ve come to expect from the newsroom of The Post -- for your ears.\n\nHouse Democrats move to formalize impeachment inquiry\n\nThe House is expected to take its first vote on the impeachment inquiry, forcing lawmakers to publicly declare whether they support the proceedings.\n\n\n\n\n\nCongressional reporter Mike DeBonis explains that the expected vote is the most tangible step that the House has taken aimed at removing President Trump from office, as the impeachment inquiry begins to move from behind closed doors to a more public forum.\n\n\n\n\n\nRepublicans are denouncing the vote, saying that it signals a flaw in the process in an impeachment that was illegitimate to begin with.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a Ukraine expert assigned to the National Security Council, testified in the impeachment inquiry. He is the first witness to testify who listened in on the July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:\n\n\n\n\n\nD.C. sniper sentence reconsidered\n\nSeventeen years after he assisted in the killings of more than a dozen people, Lee Boyd Malvo\u2019s jail sentence of life without parole is being reconsidered by the Supreme Court.\n\n\n\n\n\nSince the D.C. sniper shootings, the court\u2019s jurisprudence on juvenile murderers has changed, giving the then-minor a chance to ask for leniency in his sentence. Several victims\u2019 families want to see his case reopened, but others who lived in D.C. at the time of the murders are unsettled.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cPeople were scared, and they were scared not just conceptually,\u201d says editor Josh White , who covered the shootings in 2002 and interviewed Malvo 10 years later. \u201cThey were scared every minute of their lives that they were outside of their homes.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2018It\u2019s no fun playing a game you lose all the time\u2019\n\nThe gaming industry is expected to make $152 billion in revenue this year. The prevalence of video games and player competitions has more people turning to coaches to help them level up their gaming abilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOn the higher skill level, there\u2019s amateurs that want to get into the pro space, that can rely on these type of coaches to get them there,\u201d says Post writer Hawken Miller . \u201cAnd then there\u2019s older dads and moms that want to be able to play with their kids but don\u2019t have the skills to do it and need that extra hand, and that\u2019s where coaches come in.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:", "description": "Mike DeBonis on what the upcoming impeachment vote means.
