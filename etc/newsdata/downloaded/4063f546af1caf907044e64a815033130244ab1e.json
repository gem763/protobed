Monzo Plus subscriptions \u2014 which have a \u00a313 ($16) monthly fee \u2014 come with perks like additional ATM withdrawal amounts, travel insurance, airport lounge access, Monzo merchandise, and discounts. Business Insider Intelligence\n\nThere will be a new team dedicated to improving Monzo Plus, which will operate under a new name. As it rethinks the subscription offering, Monzo will hold weekly updates, test by surveying its app users, and continue to develop the product.\n\nNeobanks' ongoing struggle with profitability makes experimenting with different business models critical to identify what will be profitable and sustainable.\n\nMonzo Plus was likely a revenue play by the neobank. In addition trying to drive revenue, the premium account could have been intended to promote primary account status among a more engaged segment of users: Monzo just ended its referral bonus to new customers, suggesting it's relying less on incentives and more on further engaging existing customers. The neobank recently surpassed 3 million users \u2014 counting 1 in 20 UK adults as customers \u2014 just four months after reaching the 2 million user mark; but only 30% of Monzo's active users deposit \u00a31,000 ($1,249) or more per month \u2014 highlighting its continued need to drive deposits. This reflects a hurdle neobanks across the board face in converting users to adopt their offerings as their primary accounts, which in turn has caused obstacles to achieving profitability.\n\nThough Monzo didn't disclose reasons for suspending the service beyond negative user feedback, we speculate that it likely had low adoption or the perks were unsustainable. Some of Monzo Plus' offerings are likely too expensive for it to offer: Airport lounge access, for example, is typically only offered by premium credit cards, which have high annual fees to offset the price of offering the perks, like Chase Sapphire Reserve ($450 annual fee) or American Express Platinum card ($550 annual fee). And no-fee credit cards are generating more revenue than Monzo due to swipe fees: Credit cards generate around 2-3% in per-transaction swipe fees, enabling them to offer perks, even without annual fees. Monzo will ultimately have to gauge which in-demand features it will be able to offer while still generating revenue.\n\nInterested in getting the full story?
