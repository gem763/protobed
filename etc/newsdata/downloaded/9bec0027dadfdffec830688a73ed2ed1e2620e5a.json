This year the statistics are even worse than they were last year.\u201d\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

They have instructed their lawyers at Centre for Women\u2019s justice to issue legal proceedings against Mr Hill.\n\nAndrea Simon, the coalition's head of public affairs, said: \u201cWe need to remember that behind these figures lie real lives, these numbers represent real women subjected to rape, a crime which does enormous harm, who are then further victimised by a system that does not take them seriously.\n\n\u201cThese shocking and unjustifiable failings speak to a clear and concerted shift in how the CPS have decided to prosecute rape.\n\n\u201cThe failure to prosecute rape sends a clear message not only about disregarding justice for survivors, but also signals to rapists that they are safe to continue offending, knowing the likelihood they will be held to account is miniscule. Is this the type of society we want to live in? Is this deemed acceptable by our leaders?\u201d\n\nCampaigners say the CPS has changed its approach in rape cases \u2013 arguing the service has started scrapping so-called \u201cweak\u201d cases to improve notoriously low rape conviction rates.\n\nThe CPS said the \u201cgrowing gap\u201d between the number of rapes recorded by the police, and the number of cases going to court is a \u201ccause of concern for all of us in the criminal justice system\u201d. But the report said it was not indicative of any change in policy, or lack of CPS commitment to prosecute.\n\nIt justifies the fall by saying cases are taking longer due to digital evidence and also drawing attention to the fact it is getting fewer rape referrals from police - a 23 per cent fall from the previous year.\n\nFigures show the charge rate for rape \u2013 essentially the decision to press ahead with a prosecution \u2013 has dropped from 64 per cent in 2014-15 to 48 per cent this year.\n\nIt represents the first time in five years that the percentage of legal decisions made by the CPS in rape cases has dropped below 60 per cent, according to the data, meaning the percentage of decisions not to prosecute also increased to its highest rate in that time.\n\nDespite an increase in the volume of alleged rapes reported to police, the CPS has seen a reduction in the number it decides to charge every year since 2015-16. This is a decrease from 3,910 in 2015-16, to 3,671 the following year, then 2,822 last year, and 1,758 most recently.\n\nMr Hill announced the independent CPS watchdog, Her Majesty\u2019s Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate, will hold a review of rape charging decisions \u201cto increase accountability and reassure victims of sexual offences\u201d.\n\nHe said: \u201cRape is an awful, sickening offence and I completely understand why the fall in charging rates is so concerning.\n\n\u201dPartners across the criminal justice system are coming together to look at how these cases are handled and the CPS is playing its part by opening up our charging decisions to further scrutiny.\n\n\u201cI have every confidence in the work of our dedicated prosecutors but it is important that the public has confidence too. I intend to implement any changes which are recommended if they improve our processes and enable the criminal justice system to deliver swifter, more effective justice.\"\n\nBut the CPS has been facing increasingly fierce criticism for the alarming drop in prosecutions for rape in recent months \u2013 with campaigners saying prosecutors are failing rape victims \u201cat every stage\u201d.\n\nElsewhere in the report, figures show the number of suspects charged by the CPS with offences grouped under the violence against women and girls strand \u2013 such as domestic abuse, stalking, rape, female genital mutilation and child abuse \u2013 dropped 13 per cent from 187,545 to 162,717.", "description": "The head of the\u00a0Crown Prosecution Service\u00a0(CPS) has defended its record as \"appalling\" new figures reveal rape convictions have plummeted despite record volumes of cases being reported to police.", "authors": ["Maya Oppenheim"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/11/13/19/max-hill.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
