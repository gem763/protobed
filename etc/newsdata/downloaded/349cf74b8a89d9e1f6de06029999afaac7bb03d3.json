Here are some of the biggest things that set Southwest Airlines apart from other carriers. USA TODAY\n\nSorry, seniors: Southwest is doing away with its senior fare options.\n\nThe airline quietly announced the news on its website: \"Notice: As of Dec. 11, 2019, senior fares are no longer available for purchase. Our customers mean everything to us. We\u2019re committed to providing friendly, reliable service and low fares with heart. You\u2019ll still get all that with our other fare features.\" Southwest added that refundable fares are still available with its \"Anytime\" and \"Business Select\" fares.\n\nThe news may come as a surprise to loyal Southwest customers who are 65 and older; however, many travelers may not have been aware of the promotion in the first place, as it's not nearly as popular as Southwest's hyped semi-annual sales that have been known to slash prices to $49 for one-way fares. Southwest spokesman Dan Landson told USA TODAY a \"relatively low\" number of customers used the fare choice.\n\nFor those who take advantage of it, though, the senior discount can dramatically cut ticket prices. For a single adult using Southwest's \"Anytime\" fare, for example, round-trip flights from Washington Dulles International Airport to Los Angeles International Airport cost $1,189.38 (the cheapest options). For a single senior, it cost $685.36.\n\nSorry, seniors: Southwest is doing away with its senior fare options.
