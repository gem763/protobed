It\u2019s a number that Jamie Nordstrom, Nordstrom\u2019s president of stores, thinks is on the mark.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d remarked Nordstrom in an interview on Yahoo Finance\u2019s YFI AM about the investment bank\u2019s projection. \u201cManhattan is already our single biggest New York market, and online is over 30% of our business. We know when we have a store in the market such as New York [City], which is the largest retail market in North America, it lifts all boats.\u201d\n\nWithout question, Nordstrom\u2019s New York City store is primed to do its part. By all measures, it\u2019s a true homage to luxury goods shopping in the age of digital.\n\nNEW YORK, NEW YORK - SEPTEMBER 17: Atmosphere at the Nordstrom Ankari Floruss Launch on September 17, 2019 in New York City.

Services \u2014 designed to get New Yorkers into the store more frequently \u2014 include an upscale bar, Italian restaurant and places to get a blowout or Botox.\n\nDefinitely not the boring, standard department store model \u2014 that could be seen nearby at the storied Macy\u2019s Herald Square.\n\nWhile the new shopping hot spot will be a draw for many locals and tourists, Bank of America Merrill Lynch does caution investors on being too upbeat initially.\n\n\u201cWe worry that the NYC flagship store will disappoint bulls who view it as a meaningful earnings and ROIC catalyst,\u201d Bank of America Merrill Lynch\u2019s retail team writes. \u201cWe model the NYC entry as neutral to earnings in year one and think the stores will have to comp on top of grand opening volumes in year two to drive earnings accretion.\u201d\n\nBrian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and co-anchor of The First Trade at Yahoo Finance.
