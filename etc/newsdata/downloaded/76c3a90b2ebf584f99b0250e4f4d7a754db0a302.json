I made a break early in the match and with a break advantage I managed to hold my serve and win the first set 6-3.\"\n\nThe top-ranked Djokovic has not dropped a set in his four singles matches at Ariake Colosseum. None of his eight sets have gone to a tie-break, and he has been broken just twice in the tournament, losing an average of 3.5 games per set.\n\nDjokovic broke Goffin in the first game of the second with a perfectly-placed volley at the net. Down 15-40 in the second game, he fought back to hold serve and never looked back.\n\n\"It was the same scenario in the second set,\" Djokovic said. \"Started off with the break, saved some break points in a really close game - the second game of the second set - then after that I think we both served extremely well and precise.\"\n\nGoffin was the only former champion in the draw. He lost to Nick Kyrgios in the 2016 final before defeating Adrian Mannarino for the title in 2017.\n\nDjokovic retired with a left-shoulder injury during his fourth-round match against Stan Wawrinka at the U.S. Open but has shown no lingering effects in Tokyo.\n\nThe 32-year-old Serb is making a push to finish as year-end No. 1 for the sixth time, which would tie the mark held by Pete Sampras.\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2019 The Associated Press.
