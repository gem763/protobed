The power utility is trying to offload the finance company to \"people who can do it better\", he added.\n\nIn August, Treasury Director-General Dondo Mogajane told the Standing Committee on Appropriations that for Eskom to receive any additional funding from government, the power utility would need to meet a set of conditions. One of these was the sale of non-core assets.\n\n\"They (Eskom) are sitting with a R10bn loan book. Eskom is not in the business of running financial operations. They can sell that off to someone who does that for a living \u2013 not them,\" Mogajane said at the time.\n\n\n\nEarlier this year, Mboweni had tabled a special appropriations bill that would see Eskom receive an additional R59bn over the next two years. This is over an above the three-year allocation of R69bn Treasury made to Eskom at the national budget in February 2019.\n\nThe R59bn is strictly to be used by Eskom to meet its financial obligations \u2013 such as debt repayments and interest payments. If Eskom requires funding for other operations, it needs to first seek approval from Treasury, Mogajane said.\n\nParts of SAA to be sold off\n\nThe Sowetan meanwhile reported that the NEC agreed portions of state-owned airline SAA should be sold off. Godongwana told the Sowetan on the sidelines of the briefing that international carriers might buy parts of the airline. At the time of publishing, Godongwana could not immediately be reached by phone to confirm further details.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday Fin24 reported that the SAA and SA Express'financial reports for the 2018/19 could not yet be finalised due to financial chellenges both airlines are facing. Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan has told Parliament that the annual reports will be tabled once the going concern challenges of the airlines is resolved.", "description": "The ANC's head of economic transformation Enoch Godongwana says that funding plans for Eskom still need to be finalised and are likely to be announced at the mini budget.", "authors": ["- Lameez Omarjee"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8430/6c3a50ebf2674d66bf46d6c15fd5fc1c.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
