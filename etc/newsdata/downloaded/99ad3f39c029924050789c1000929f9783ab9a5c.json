They for the first time allow officials to consider how much it would cost to save a species. They also remove blanket protections for animals newly listed as threatened and make it easier for creatures to be removed from the protected list.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a death by a thousand cuts for the Endangered Species Act,\u201d said Democratic Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson, announcing the lawsuit in a Seattle news conference.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

It requires the government to list species that are endangered or threatened. The law also protects about 1,600 plant and animal species, designates habitat protections for them, and assesses whether federal activities will hurt them.\n\nCritics have long complained that the environmentalists have weaponized the law to block economic activity such as logging and mining, infringing on property rights. The Trump administration and congressional Republicans have said the new rules will improve the law\u2019s enforcement.\n\nThe revisions \u201cfit squarely within the President\u2019s mandate of easing the regulatory burden on the American public, without sacrificing our species\u2019 protection and recovery goals,\u201d U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said when the changes were announced last month.\n\nScientists say that globally about 1 million species are at risk of extinction, mainly because of habitat destruction by humans, overfishing and climate change.\n\nThe states challenging Trump\u2019s rules are California, Massachusetts, Maryland, Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington. The District of Columbia and New York City were also named as plaintiffs.\n\nThey argue that the rules changes contradict the goals of the Endangered Species Act and that the administration failed to provide a reasoned basis for the changes or analyze their environmental impacts as required by federal law.\n\nThe lawsuit cites challenges faced by creatures that include piping plovers in Rhode Island, orca whales in Washington state and desert tortoises in the Mojave Desert in Nevada.\n\n\u201cWe are running out of time,\u201d said Michael Ross, vice chairman of the Snoqualmie Indian Tribe in Washington. \u201cThese changes aren\u2019t in the right direction.\u201d\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "The rules would remove blanket protections for animals newly listed as threatened and make it easier to be removed from the protected list.", "authors": ["Gene Johnson"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/monarch-butterfly.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
