The the biggest coup Australian football has ever made\", while another said: \"If nothing else, the Premier League is a great case study of how to market and brand a competition well.\"\n\nHowever, another suggested he \"give back his \u00a35m leaving gift and donate it grassroots football\".\n\nThe A-League is in the process of transitioning away from the control of Football Federation Australia and towards an independent structure run by the clubs \u2013 much like the transformation of the Premier League back in 1992.\n\nIn quotes reported by the Herald, Scudamore said: \"If anything, Australia has more potential to harness the economic and commercial opportunities available to the game.\n\n\"Certainly all the ingredients are there for significant and rapid development and growth \u2013 most importantly there is a groundswell of shared ambition in the Australian game, and that is as uncommon as it is vital.\"", "description": "Man who headed up the Premier League for 19 years has reportedly been drafted in to help save the competition", "authors": ["Gareth Bicknell", "Image", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article12663446.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Premier-League-Media-Event.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
