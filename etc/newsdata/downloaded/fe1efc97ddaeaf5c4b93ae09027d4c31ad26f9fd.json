His record-breaking hit, \u201cOld Town Road,\u201d featuring Billy Ray Cyrus, has now become the fastest song to be certified diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America, Billboard reported.\n\nThe country trap song reached sales, including equivalent streaming sales, of 10 million units to qualify for the diamond certification, the publication added.\n\nIt\u2019s now only the 32nd song, in over 60 years of RIAA\u2019s Gold and Platinum program history, to reach diamond status, Liz Kennedy, a spokesperson for the organization tweeted. \u201cOld Town Road\u201d hit the unique milestone in just six months after its April release, the official Twitter account for the RIAA tweeted.\n\nLil Nas X released his original version of \u201cOld Town Road\u201d in December 2018.\n\nThe song, which went viral after gaining traction on an app called TikTok, later sparked wide conversations about racism in the country music world after it was removed from Billboard\u2019s Hot Country Songs chart in March.\n\nThe publication claimed the song did not \u201cembrace enough elements of today\u2019s country music,\u201d and later denied that the decision had anything to do with race amid backlash.\n\nCyrus publicly threw his support behind Lil Nas X following the controversy surrounding the removal of \u201cOld Town Road\u201d from Billboard\u2019s country chart. The two then collaborated to release the popular remix of the song with the veteran country music star\u2019s vocals in April.\n\nIn July, \u201cOld Town Road\u201d broke the record for having the longest-running streak at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.", "description": "The country trap song is only one of 32 songs ever to be certified diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America, a spokesperson said.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5db1e185210000432dad3d20.jpeg?cache=6r90dpilg4&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
