We can\u2019t stand for this, the American people are being denied equal justice,\u201d Scalise stated.\n\nHouse Minority Whip @SteveScalise rips into Democratic \"soviet style\" impeachment process: He says that @RepAdamSchiff \"started telling witnesses not to answer questions by certain Republicans.\" pic.twitter.com/5mcEU8NZuq \u2014 Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) October 29, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nScalise\u2019s comments come after the House released a draft resolution instituting a formal process for the inquiry, which includes allowing Republicans to present subpoenas and call witnesses, but only ones that are \u201cauthorized\u201d by Schiff.\n\n\u201cAdam Schiff, among many things, has been trying to claim that this is a fair process by saying that Republicans are allowed to ask questions,\u201d Scalise told reporters alongside Ohio Republican Jim Jordan. \u201cNow he gets to choose all the witnesses, and him and himself only, which means it\u2019s not a fair process on the face. But even his claim now, that Republicans can ask questions, has been undermined, because now he\u2019s directing witnesses not to answer questions that he doesn\u2019t want the witness to answer, if they\u2019re asked by Republicans.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not cut off one Democrat, he\u2019s not interrupted one Democrat and told a witness not to answer Democrat members\u2019 questions, but today he started telling the witness not to answer questions by certain Republicans. That reeks.\u201d\n\nHouse Republicans have been hostile to Schiff\u2019s handling of the impeachment probe, and last week attempted to pass a resolution to censure the California Democrat and demanded his resignation. Following the failed party-line vote, House Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) accused Democrats of electing \u201cto put politics over truth.\u201d\n\nMore from National Review", "description": "House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R., La.) lambasted House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff for allegedly shutting down questions from House Republicans in an impeachment inquiry hearing, calling it \u201ca Soviet-style process.\u201d\u201cThat might be what they do in the Soviet Union, not the United States of America", "authors": ["Tobias Hoonhout"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/SP0VKz3ogPHSNiRgfdawTQ--~B/aD01OTc7dz0xMDIzO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/dbbf6fc893d34d1b8f97bf4ee789d351", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
