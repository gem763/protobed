Raising taxes on the middle class is a political third rail. Other options, like reducing health care benefits or raising payroll taxes are also politically dicey.\n\nSmall wonder then that the top-tier Democrat \u2014 whose motto is that she has a plan for everything \u2014 doesn\u2019t have one yet for how to pay for universal health care. She and other Medicare for All supporters have argued that it doesn\u2019t make sense to fixate on costs with basic questions, like how much doctors would earn, still unknown.\n\n\u201cYou could say \u2026 that we\u2019re spending about $3.5 trillion on health care now and we\u2019re going to move that all onto the federal tab, but I think that\u2019s a little too simplistic,\u201d House Budget Chairman John Yarmuth (D-Ky.), a longtime supporter of single-payer health care, said earlier this year.\n\nBut with Warren\u2019s primary rivals pressuring her for details, lawmakers, health policy experts and academics say she has several credible options for paying to extend government health insurance to all Americans.", "description": "", "authors": ["Politico.Com News"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
