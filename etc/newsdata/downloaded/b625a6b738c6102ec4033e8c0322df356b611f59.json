But during cross-examination, prosecutors cast doubt on Guyger\u2019s grief, wondered why she didn\u2019t call for backup instead of confronting Jean and questioned her attempts to save his life.\n\nGuyger, 31, repeatedly apologized for killing Jean as she spoke publicly for the first time about the events of that night.\n\n\u201cI hate that I have to live with this every single day of my life and I ask God for forgiveness, and I hate myself every single day,\u201d she said as she looked across the courtroom at Jean\u2019s family.\n\nGuyger, who was fired after the shooting, said she wished \u201che was the one with the gun\u201d and had killed her, instead. \u201cI never wanted to take an innocent person\u2019s life. And I\u2019m so sorry. This is not about hate. It\u2019s about being scared that night,\u201d she said.\n\nJean grew up in the Caribbean island nation of St. Lucia before coming to the U.S. for college. His shooting drew widespread attention because of the strange circumstances and because it was one in a string of shootings of unarmed black men by white police officers.\n\nGuyger testified that upon returning home in-uniform after a long shift that night, she put her key into what she thought was her door lock and the door opened because it hadn\u2019t been fully closed. Fearing it was a break-in, she drew her service weapon and stepped inside to find a silhouetted figure standing in the dark.\n\n\u201cLet me see your hands! Let me see your hands,\u201d she said she told the man. But Guyger said she couldn\u2019t see his hands and he began coming toward her at a \u201cfast-paced\u201d walk. She said he yelled, \u201cHey! Hey! Hey!\u201d right before she opened fire.\n\n\u201cI was scared he was going to kill me,\u201d she said under questioning by her lawyers, who called her as their first witness on the trial\u2019s fifth day. She said she intended to kill him when she pulled the trigger because that\u2019s what she had been trained to do as a police officer.\n\nLead prosecutor Jason Hermus suggested that Guyger was less than grief-stricken in the aftermath of the shooting, saying that two days after she shot Jean, Guyger asked her police partner, with whom she was romantically involved, if he wanted to go for drinks.\n\nHermus also asked Guyger why she didn\u2019t radio in for help when she thought there was a break-in at what she thought was her home. She replied that going through the doorway with her gun drawn, \u201cwas the only option that went through my head.\u201d\n\nHermus also grilled Guyger about why she didn\u2019t perform \u201cproper CPR\u201d on Jean after she shot him. He asked about an eight-hour de-escalation training course she had taken that April, but Guyger told the jury she could no longer remember what she learned in the course. She said she performed some chest compressions on Jean with one hand while using her phone with the other, but she also acknowledged stopping several times.\n\nThe basic facts of how Jean died aren\u2019t in dispute. But the jury will have to decide whether Guyger\u2019s actions constitute murder, a lesser offense such as manslaughter or criminally negligent homicide, or no crime at all.\n\nGuyger has said she fired in self-defense after mistaking Jean for a burglar and her lawyers say the identical appearance of the floors at their complex frequently led to tenants parking on the wrong floor or trying to enter the wrong apartments.\n\nProsecutors have questioned how Guyger could have missed numerous signs that she was in the wrong place and suggested she was distracted by sexually explicit phone messages with her police partner. They say Jean was no threat to Guyger, noting that he was in his living room eating a bowl of ice cream when she entered his apartment.\n\nIn a frantic 911 call played in court earlier this week and again Friday, Guyger said \u201cI thought it was my apartment\u201d nearly 20 times.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Jamie Stengle contributed to this report.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A Dallas police officer broke her silence Friday about the night she killed a young accountant who lived in the apartment right above hers, telling jurors that she has to live with the guilt every day and that she wished their roles were reversed.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jake Bleiberg"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/27/dallas_officer_mistaken_apartment_62422_c0-0-6235-3635_s1770x1032.jpg?859bd564a7bec5404ece473c9e9bf4c28156ccf3", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
