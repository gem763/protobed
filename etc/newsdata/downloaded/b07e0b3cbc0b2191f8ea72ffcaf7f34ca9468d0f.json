Chance was sentenced Thursday to 100 years in prison after being found guilty of second-degree murder and other crimes related to Ashley\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cJared Chance, I hate you,\u201d Young told the 30-year-old during her victim impact statement. \u201cI want to rip you limb from limb and discard you, just like you did to Ashley.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou threw her out like trash and she was your friend.

Chance and Young knew each other and were last seen together at a Grand Rapids bar in late November.\n\nThe 100-year minimum sentence given to Chance exceeded state guidelines and is expected to be appealed, the Associated Press reports, but Kent County Judge Mark Trusock said the guidelines don't account for the \"level of brutality\" in Ashley Young's death.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nChance declined to speak in court during the sentencing hearing. His attorney, Andrew Rodenhouse, had argued during trial that no one really knows how Young died.\n\nChance had turned down a plea deal that would have made him eligible for parole after 31 years and instead chose to go to trial.\n\nFox News\u2019 Thairy Lantigua and the Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "The mother of a Michigan woman who was found dismembered last year told her daughter's convicted killer that she wants to rip him \"limb from limb.\"", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/jared-chance.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
