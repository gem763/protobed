And the way the Democrats are conducting this so-called impeachment inquiry on Capitol Hill, behind closed doors, is wrong.\u201d\n\nHe said Democrats \u201cshould open this whole process to the light of day. They should release all of the transcripts.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd they should also respect the due process rights of the president of the United States of America,\u201d the vice president said, noting the last two impeachment inquiries established rules such as allowing presidential counsel in the room.\n\nThe president told reporters earlier Monday that he\u2019s advising Republicans that \u201cI\u2019d rather go into the details of the case rather than process.\u201d\n\n\u201cProcess is wonderful,\u201d the president said. \u201cBut I think you ought to look at the case. And the case is very simple; it\u2019s quick. It\u2019s so quick. I had a great conversation with the Ukrainian president. It was nothing. They tried to take that conversation and make it into a big scandal.\u201d\n\nDemocrats are accusing Mr. Trump of pressuring the Ukrainian president to announce publicly an investigation of Democratic frontrunner Joseph R. Biden.\n\n\u201cThere was no anything. There was no pressure put on him. No anything,\u201d Mr. Trump said of the transcript of the July 25 phone call. Mr. Pence said the unfairness of the closed impeachment inquiry is \u201cwhy so many Americans are so frustrated with this Congress.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause, frankly, for the last three years, Congress has been spending most of its energy trying to overturn the will of the American people in the last election,\u201d he said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
