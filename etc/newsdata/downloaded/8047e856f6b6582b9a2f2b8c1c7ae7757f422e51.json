The largely black and Latino community in Fulton Houses is worth more than the real estate it occupies and forcing the relocation of 72 low income families to build luxury towers is unacceptable,\u201d six elected officials wrote in a letter to Deputy Mayor Vicki Been and New York City Housing Authority Chair Gregory Russ.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nMeanwhile Miguel Acevedo, president of the Fulton Houses Tenant Association, told POLITICO the city\u2019s plan is the residents\u2019 best shot at better living conditions.\n\n\u201cI spoke to many of my residents who know that Fulton Houses has been going downhill for decades,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re living in filth, we\u2019re living with broken elevators, we\u2019re living with flooded roofs.\u201d\n\n\"Why should we continue to be an eyesore if we have an opportunity to be more beautified?\" he added.\n\nA 90-year-old resident who uses a wheelchair and needs assistance breathing was recently stuck in Acevedo\u2019s ground floor office for five hours while mechanics fixed a chronically broken elevator, he said.\n\nThat account is echoed throughout the city\u2019s 325 public housing developments, where some 400,000 New Yorkers live in squalor. A 2018 analysis the city conducted concluded the 5-year backlog of repairs requires $31.8 billion.\n\nWithout sufficient funds, the city is turning to a federal program that converts public housing to private management, enriching developers who receive rental vouchers and are in turn expected to speed up repairs. Opponents say it is tantamount to privatization of a public resource and puts tenants at risk of eviction.\n\nAcevedo disagrees, and said he spoke to staffers for Rep. Jerry Nadler and City Council Speaker Corey Johnson Thursday to let them know he supports de Blasio\u2019s plan for the site. Both had signed onto the letter to Been and Russ.\n\n\u201cI respect what the elected officials do for us, but they don\u2019t live here. I live here,\u201d he said.\n\nThe city wants to demolish and rebuild two of the Fulton complex\u2019s low rises, which house 72 apartments, and erect new apartment buildings on the property for predominantly market-rate renters. Eventually, the entire development would be under the management of a private company, but the city would retain an ownership stake.\n\nFulton and a nearby development, Chelsea-Elliot Houses, have a combined $344 million in capital needs, according to the city\u2019s estimate.\n\nDe Blasio has said no residents would be relocated off campus during the transition \u2014 a promise Acevedo said he would insist be put in writing.\n\n\u201cThe time has long come to save NYCHA and fix these buildings \u2014 our residents deserve nothing less,\u201d mayoral spokesperson Seth Stein said. \u201cNothing has changed in our approach and we look forward to working with our elected partners to improve conditions at Fulton Houses as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nThe plan has stoked opposition among some residents and all elected officials who represent Fulton Houses.\n\nThe politicians asked the city to delay its plans to issue a bid soliciting developers, but Been told them she plans to proceed as scheduled and, in public remarks this week, accused those looking to delay of \u201cmaking a decision to let those buildings fall into more and more disrepair.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd at some point they\u2019ll be beyond repair,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s be honest.\u201d\n\nJohnson on Thursday reiterated his concerns.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to see where we can go, but the elected officials are united. We are together in this, and we are not going to be bulldozed,\u201d he said at an unrelated press conference. \u201cWe are not trying to throw up stumbling blocks, we are trying to work through this in a community-based way where the tenants are listened to.\u201d", "description": "The plan has stoked opposition among some residents and all elected officials who represent Fulton Houses.", "authors": ["Sally Goldenberg"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/9b/08/8153bc46450e8521e2bcb8320e07/fulton-houses-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
