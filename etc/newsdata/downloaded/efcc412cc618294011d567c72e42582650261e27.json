Ramsey reportedly requested a trade from the Jaguars after a Week 2 sideline argument with head coach Doug Marrone in a loss to the Houston Texans. He confirmed the request the next week in a Sirius XM interview.\n\nRamsey played in Jacksonville\u2019s Week 3 win over the Tennessee Titans, but hasn\u2019t suited up since, citing various ailments including a back injury and the flu before taking an indefinite leave from the team for the birth of his daughter.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nRams making big deals\n\nThe deal marks the third of the day for the Los Angeles Rams, who traded cornerback Marcus Peters to the Baltimore Ravens for linebacker Kenny Young and an undisclosed draft pick and sent a 2021 draft pick to the Cleveland Browns for second-year center Austin Corbett to help shore up a porous offensive line.\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, here's how]\n\nThe Peters deal happened a day after the Rams placed starting cornerback Aqib Talib on injured reserve, raising questions about what they planned to do at a suddenly depleted cornerback position.\n\nThe Ramsey deal emphatically answers that question as the Rams have added one of the league\u2019s premier defenders to their secondary.\n\nJalen Ramsey found his way out of Jacksonville, and the Rams found their replacement for Marcus Peters in a blockbuster deal. (Reuters)\n\nWhat does Ramsey provide Rams?\n\nRamsey, 24, is in his fourth NFL season after the Jaguars selected him with the fifth pick of the 2016 draft. He\u2019s lived up to his lofty draft status, earning Pro Bowl nods in 2017 and 2018 and All-Pro honors in 2017.\n\nStory continues\n\nHe\u2019ll be an immediate upgrade to a pass defense that ranks 14th in league and will allow the Rams to play more man-to-man defense. He\u2019s a legitimate lock-down cornerback.\n\nThe Rams have taken a hard slide after a 3-0 start, dropping to 3-3 with Sunday\u2019s 20-7 loss to the San Francisco 49ers marking a new low on the season. The defending NFC champions are in win-now mode, but find themselves in a dogfight in the NFC West with the 5-0 49ers and 4-1 Seahawks, whom they have an 0-2 record against this season.\n\nThere\u2019s a clear hope that Monday\u2019s deal can help the Rams become more competitive in their quest to return to the Super Bowl.\n\nFor the Jaguars, losing Ramsey is a jolt, but he appeared adamant on not playing in Jacksonville again. Getting a package that includes a pair of first-round picks amounts to adequate compensation for the blockbuster level of this deal.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Jalen Ramsey found his way out of Jacksonville, and the Rams found their replacement for Marcus Peters in a blockbuster deal.", "authors": ["Jason Owens"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/17Ij7aDTKVkEKc5MmtiRog--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03NzMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/aurneoJwj0acBzkUrMv23A--~B/aD0xOTkzO3c9MzMwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/65c3c850-efa6-11e9-b79d-ba34f66c6029", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
