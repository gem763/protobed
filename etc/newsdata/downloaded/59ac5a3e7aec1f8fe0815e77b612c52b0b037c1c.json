Its current output would make it OPEC's third-largest producer, far above that of recent new OPEC members such as Congo and Equatorial Guinea.\n\nThe Brazilian president said he would have to consult with his economy and energy ministers to ensure they could follow through if a decision was made.\n\nOutput has been rising rapidly in Brazil from offshore fields and production surged by 220,000 barrels per day (bpd) in August to a record 3.1 million bpd, according to the International Energy Agency.\n\nThat would make Brazil the third-largest OPEC producer after Saudi Arabia and Iraq.\n\nOPEC has seen a number of smaller producers leave and join the group in recent years.\n\nEcuador is planning to exit in 2020, following Qatar which quit this year. Equatorial Guinea joined in 2017 and Congo became a member last year.
