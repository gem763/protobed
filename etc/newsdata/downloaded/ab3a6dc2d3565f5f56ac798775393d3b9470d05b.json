John Kennedy (R-La.) became the latest member of the Senate Judiciary Committee to send up a warning flare that he could vote against one of Trump\u2019s picks.\n\nKennedy said that Steven Menashi, nominated for the 2nd Circuit appeals court, could be \u201cOliver Wendell Scalia\u201d but that he couldn\u2019t vote for him unless he gets a clear picture of how Menashi thinks about legal issues.\n\n\u201cIf someone gets mad at that, they need to call somebody who cares, because that is my job and I\u2019m tired of them playing games,\u201d Kennedy said in an apparent opening shot at potential critics.\n\nMenashi tangled with several senators, including Kennedy, during his confirmation hearing over frustration that he was dodging their questions. At one point, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), a close ally of Trump\u2019s who chairs the committee, appeared exasperated with Menashi, warning it is \u201cimportant that you tell us what you worked on.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["The Hill", "Thehill.Com Homenews Senate"], "top_image": ""}
