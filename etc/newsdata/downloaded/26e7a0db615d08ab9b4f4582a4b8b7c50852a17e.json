REUTERS/Francis Mascarenhas\n\nIn one of the world\u2019s largest apple growing regions, a weeks-old lockdown imposed after Prime Minister Narendra Modi dramatically abolished the state\u2019s special constitutional status has cut transport links with buyers in India and abroad, fruit growers and traders say, plunging the industry into turmoil.\n\nModi sold the move as a way to spur growth by integrating the state with the rest of India. But, for now, the unrest that has come in the wake of his government\u2019s action has upended the economy, further fuelling resentment in the Muslim-majority territory where an armed revolt against India rule has ebbed and flowed over 30 years.\n\nAt dawn late last week the market in Sopore, a town known locally as \u201cLittle London\u201d for its lush orchards, big houses and relative affluence, was deserted, its gates locked.\n\n\u201cEveryone is scared,\u201d a lone trader, rushing to an adjoining mosque for morning prayers, told Reuters. \u201cNo one will come.\u201d\n\nApples are the lifeblood of Kashmir\u2019s economy, involving 3.5 million people, around half the population of the state.\n\nIn a surprise move on Aug. 5, just as the harvest season as getting under way, the government abrogated provisions in India\u2019s constitution that gave the Jammu and Kashmir partial autonomy and stipulated only residents could buy property or hold government jobs. Strict movement restrictions were imposed simultaneously, and mobile, telephone, and internet connections snapped.\n\nThe government said the immediate priority was to prevent an eruption of violence in Kashmir, where more than 40,000 people have been killed since 1989, and that curbs are slowly being eased, including the opening up of landline phones.\n\nFurther out, the government has promised rapid economic development and plans an investor summit later this year to attract some of India\u2019s top companies to the region, create jobs and lure young people away from militancy.\n\nIn the short-term, however, farmers and fruit traders say the clampdown is stopping them from either getting their produce to market or shipping it out to the rest of India. Some say they have also been threatened into stopping work by militant groups.\n\nIn orchard after orchard surrounding Sopore, apples hung rotting on trees. \u201cWe are stuck from both sides,\u201d said Haji, a trader, sitting inside a sprawling two-story house in Sopore. \u201cWe can neither go here, nor there.\u201d\n\nBUSINESSES REELING\n\nBusiness people who spoke to Reuters say it is not just the fruit industry that is reeling - two other key sectors of Kashmir\u2019s economy, tourism and handicrafts, have also been hit hard.\n\nShameem Ahmed, a travel agent who owns a houseboat in the summer capital Srinagar, said this year\u2019s tourist season was completely wiped out.\n\n\u201cAugust was peak season, and we had bookings up to October,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will take a long time to revive, and we don\u2019t know what will happen next.\u201d\n\nThe near complete lack of tourists has also hit carpet traders such as Shoukat Ahmed.\n\n\u201cWhen there are no tourists, there are no sales,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are also unable to sell across India because communication is down.\u201d\n\nAt a major chamber of commerce in Srinagar, some members said the continuing lack of internet and mobile connections had paralyzed their work, including the ability to file taxes and make bank transactions.\n\nSome businessmen have also been among the hundreds of politicians and civil society leaders detained by the authorities since early August to dampen any backlash.\n\nWhile many of those arrested across the region have since been released, Haseeb Drabu, a former state finance minister from a local party once allied with Modi\u2019s ruling BJP, said outsiders were now balking at doing business with Kashmiris.\n\n\u201cWith a few businessmen raided and more under detention, why would anyone from the rest of the country engage with them and subject himself to a possible enquiry of his transaction and opening of his books?\u201d Drabu said.\n\n\u201cIT\u2019S HOPELESS\u201d\n\nIndia and Pakistan have twice gone to war over Kashmir, which is divided between them but both claim in full, and it remains at the heart of decades of hostility.\n\nIn February, the nuclear-armed neighbors engaged in an aerial duel after a deadly militant attack on an Indian paramilitary convoy in Kashmir, raising the fear of a broader conflict.\n\nThe latest bout of instability has been devastating to the likes of Manzoor Kolu, who runs a five-roomed houseboat on Srinagar\u2019s mirror-calm Dal lake, framed by snow-clad mountains.\n\nDays before Aug. 5, Kolu said police had come asking him to move tourists out of the property, fearing unrest.\n\n\u201cThey told me that if anything happens, I would be responsible,\u201d he said. His four guests, all Indian tourists, left shortly after. No guest has come since.\n\n\u201cNow we have to wait until next April. It\u2019s hopeless,\u201d he said, sitting inside the living room of the 35-year-old boat, packed with intricately carved wooden furniture and traditional Kashmiri carpets. \u201cSo many times, I\u2019ve thought of selling, but this is my father\u2019s whole life\u2019s achievement.\u201d\n\nKashmir\u2019s tourism industry has lost momentum in recent years, starting with devastating floods in 2014 and followed by a sustained period of unrest in 2016.\n\nTourist numbers had begun improving between April and July this year, government data showed, only to drop off a cliff in August. Only 10,130 tourists came last month, compared with nearly 150,000 in July and more than 160,000 in June this year.\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\nIn a one-story house in Srinagar\u2019s working-class Zoonimar neighborhood, Abdul Hamid Shah sits beneath a window quietly embroidering a Kashmiri shawl. Each shawl is at least three months\u2019 work, and some take a whole year to complete.\n\nShah is typically paid 35,000 Indian rupees ($490) per shawl, which he often gets in monthly instalments of around 10,000 rupees. Since August, his payments from a shawl trader he has worked with for a decade have shrunk.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s telling me he doesn\u2019t have money because there is no business,\u201d Shah said.", "description": "It's harvest time, but the market in the northern Kashmiri town of Sopore - usually packed with people, trucks and produce at this time of year - is empty, while in orchards across India's Jammu and Kashmir state unpicked apples rot on the branch.", "authors": ["Devjyot Ghoshal", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190919&t=2&i=1431463734&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8I07X", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
