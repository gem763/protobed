There\u2019s no money involved here, no electoral repercussions next fall, nothing that would obviously explain why the White House is completely committed to \u201cwinning\u201d the argument. It\u2019s pure vanity. Trump tweeted on September 1 that Alabama could be affected by the storm; that information was outdated so the Birmingham chapter of the National Weather Service politely contradicted him in its own tweet; and here we are eight days later, with the NYT breaking news about Wilbur Ross warning that heads would roll at NOAA if they didn\u2019t take the president\u2019s side in that dispute.\n\nThere\u2019s no reason for any of it except vanity on Trump\u2019s part and sycophancy on Ross\u2019s. And so it\u2019s become a measure of just how deep the Trump cult of personality within the administration extends. Is it so deep and petty that professional meteorologists will be forced to alter their own forecasts retroactively to protect the president\u2019s ego?\n\nMr. Ross, the Commerce Secretary, intervened \u2026 early last Friday, according to the three people familiar with his actions. Mr. Ross phoned Neil Jacobs, the acting administrator of NOAA, from Greece where the secretary was traveling for meetings and instructed Dr. Jacobs to fix the agency\u2019s perceived contradiction of the president. Dr. Jacobs objected to the demand and was told that the political staff at NOAA would be fired if the situation was not fixed, according to the three individuals, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the episode. Unlike career government employees, political staff are appointed by the administration. They usually include a handful of top officials, such as Dr. Jacobs, and their aides.\n\nJacobs caved. NOAA issued a strange statement on Friday night, just when it seemed like the hurricane story was petering out, criticizing the NWS Birmingham office for having spoken \u201cin absolute terms that were inconsistent with probabilities from the best forecast products available at the time\u201d when it corrected Trump. You see, there was a 5-10 percent chance of tropical-storm-force winds in a tiny corner of Alabama when Trump tweeted on September 1 that the state would \u201cmost likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated.\u201d To Trump and Ross, that means Trump was technically sort of right. To everyone else, it means Trump\u2019s tweet way overhyped the threat to the state based on stale info and the NWS crew in Birmingham tried to calm people by reassuring them there was no threat. NOAA\u2019s managers sided with Trump and Ross because, at the end of the day, they\u2019ve got to pay the rent.\n\nThe chief scientist at NOAA is now promising an internal investigation for the understandable reason that a weather bureau that makes forecasts based on the president\u2019s mood instead of the actual weather isn\u2019t serving the public. Presumably the next phase in this ridiculous story is Trump or Ross firing this guy for daring to try to protect the integrity of the agency\u2019s meteorological methods:\n\n\u201cThe NWS Forecaster(s) corrected any public misunderstanding in an expert and timely way, as they should,\u201d [acting chief scientist Craig] McLean wrote. \u201cThere followed, last Friday, an unsigned news release from \u2018NOAA\u2019 that inappropriately and incorrectly contradicted the NWS forecaster. My understanding is that this intervention to contradict the forecaster was not based on science but on external factors including reputation and appearance, or simply put, political.\u201d He also wrote that \u201cthe content of this news release is very concerning as it compromises the ability of NOAA to convey life-saving information necessary to avoid substantial and specific danger to public health and safety.\u201d \u201cIf the public cannot trust our information, or we debase our forecaster\u2019s warnings and products, that specific danger arises,\u201d McLean wrote. As a result, McLean told his staff that \u201cI am pursuing the potential violations of our NOAA Administrative Order on Scientific Integrity.\u201d\n\nI\u2019d love to hear the conversation in Pelosi\u2019s office about this. The entire saga is so preposterously petty that there may be no way to hold hearings on it without Democrats coming off as ridiculous as Trump. Imagine the casual voter who hasn\u2019t followed the story trying to process it. \u201cThey\u2019re investigating Trump for \u2026 tampering with weather reports? What?\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, you\u2019ve got the Commerce secretary instructing a scientific agency to undermine the conclusions of one of its own branches for nakedly political reasons. If Trump decides tomorrow that the moon is made of green cheese, is NASA duty-bound to issue a statement saying \u201cit\u2019s possible\u201d so that the president doesn\u2019t lose face? Does the CDC have to adjust its conclusions about the safety of vaccines because Trump has expressed skepticism about that in the past? Democrats would be laughed at if they tried to impeach Trump over this. If they tried to impeach Ross, I\u2019m not so sure.\n\nAs chance would have it, the National Weather Association\u2019s annual conference is happening today \u2014 in Alabama \u2014 and the head of the NWS, Louis Uccellini, was invited to speak. Would he side with the Birmingham office of NWS that contradicted Trump or the people at NOAA who criticized the office after being threatened by Ross?\n\n.@NWSDirector offers a very impassioned defense of the @NWSBirmingham, stating they did exactly what they were supposed to do. The office received a standing ovation. So did Louis. The word \u201cintegrity\u201d was used a lot. Kudos to him. #nwas19 \u2014 Matt Lanza (@mattlanza) September 9, 2019\n\nHe asked employees from the Birmingham office to stand for a standing ovation and they got one, so that\u2019s how this is playing within NWS. Fun fact: Jacobs, the NOAA administrator who reportedly bowed to Wilbur Ross, is set to speak tomorrow. So yes, this story will drag on yet another day.\n\n\u201c[I]f #Sharpiegate can be said to serve any non-embarrassing function,\u201d said a columnist at Slate over the weekend, \u201cit\u2019s as a test of another kind, to see which institutions and people have rotted under the president\u2019s hysterical commands and which ones haven\u2019t.\u201d Ross failed the test. Exit question: How come Uccellini or other dissenters haven\u2019t resigned? Is it because they fear they\u2019d be replaced with garbage political cronies who *will* put out the \u201cmoon is made of green cheese\u201d statement if commanded to do so?", "description": "Storms.", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Karen Townsend", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/t-2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
