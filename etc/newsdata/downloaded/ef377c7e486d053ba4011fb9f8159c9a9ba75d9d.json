Instead, what they are doing is angrily, apparently, begging the EU not to support a delay that will be required because of the decision that parliament has taken.\n\n\u201cI would urge the prime minister to take control of this and give us some clarity, dignity and diplomacy on what is taking place.\u201d\n\nIt is unclear whether the view in the memo reflects the wider view of cabinet and other staffers, as divisions remain between the vote leave contingent at No 10, led by Cummings, and the more moderate voices from the ex-city hall staffers who worked for the prime minister when he was mayor of London.\n\nThe transport secretary, Grant Shapps, sought to play down the 400-word memo on the Today progamme, saying the source of it was unknown.\n\nAsked if the UK would withdraw cooperation with EU countries if they sanction a Brexit extension, he said: \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case at all.\u201d\n\nThe note said: \u201cSupporting delay will be seen by this government as hostile interference in domestic politics, and over half of the public will agree with us.\n\n\u201cThey think now that if there is another delay we will keep coming back with new proposals. This won\u2019t happen. We\u2019ll either leave with no deal on 31 October or there will be an election and then we will leave with no deal.\u201d\n\nIn a direct challenge to Brussels, the memo said: \u201cThose who supported delay will face the inevitable consequences of being seen to interfere in domestic politics in a deeply unpopular way by colluding with a parliament that is as popular as the clap.\u201d\n\nRudd suggested Johnson did not have a plan but instead iwas begging Brussels not to countenance a delay.\n\nShe said: \u201cI don\u2019t think this will have any impact at all except make everybody slightly ashamed of the position the UK government appears to be taken.\u201d\n\nDefence and security are two of the areas in which the UK might stop cooperating with the EU if there is a delay to Brexit, according to the memo.\n\n\u201cThose who support delay will go to the bottom of the queue,\u201d it said.", "description": "Former minister Amber Rudd says language in unofficial memo \u2018sounds angry and desperate\u2019", "authors": ["Kate Proctor"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a96e48fbfd1de7788d55cf13282bb8f91fe543e2/0_56_3723_2234/master/3723.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1a1714b9ea027fd8e3e8319a6362bb21", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
