First, we almost lost our heads at her Marie Antoinette-inspired look, and then we lost our minds at her transformation into Pennywise the clown from \"It.\"\n\nTracee Ellis Ross and the \"Black-ish\" cast\n\nRoss and her cast family dressed up as the \"Tethered\" from Jordan Peele's hit horror movie \"Us.\" This creepy costume has been dominating the pop culture-inspired Halloween scene this year.\n\nAshley Graham\n\nThe model stunned in a skin-tight red latex dress as Jessica Rabbit.

I'm just drawn that way.\"\n\nKate Beckinsale\n\nThe internet did a double take when Beckinsale, dressed as Holly Golightly from \"Breakfast at Tiffany's,\" strutted down the aisle of a grocery store on Instagram.\n\nNina Dobrev\n\nYou didn't know she was the bad guy? Dobrev killed at the Casamigos Halloween party with her Billie Eilish costume. If that wasn't enough, she later posted a picture dressed as Marie S'Infiltre, the French comedian and Youtuber who crashed the Chanel runway in September. Dobrev hilariously reenacted the incident with a friend dressed as Gigi Hadid, who escorted the comedian crasher off the stage.\n\nLisa Rinna\n\nIt's two queens colliding. The \"Real Housewives of Beverly Hills\" star paid homage to Jennifer Lopez's iconic green dress from the 2000 Grammys. Suffice to say, the internet is flipping.\n\n(MORE: Dad builds mini-Millennium Falcon for epic trick-or-treating this Halloween)\n\nMissy Elliott\n\nElliott transported us back in time for her Halloween costume as she recreated her first album, \"Supa Dupa Fly,\" from over 22 years ago.

Keeping with the theme, Timberlake complemented his wife's costume by dressing up as a microphone.\n\nKourtney Kardashian\n\nAlthough Kardashian captioned her Instagram photo showing off her Ariana Grande costume with \"No tears left to cry,\" we guarantee you we only shed happy tears when seeing the star's uncanny likeness to the powerhouse singer.\n\nHalsey\n\nWith one of the spookiest costumes on our list, Halsey killed Halloween with her Marilyn Manson costume.", "description": "Halloween 2019: The spookiest and most hilarious celebrity costumes  originally appeared on goodmorningamerica.comHalloween Night hasn\u2019t even rolled by yet, but that hasn\u2019t stopped your favorite celebrities from getting their spook on, Hollyweird style.This weekend, stars everywhere celebrated the fall", "authors": ["Laura Laughead"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/iFt7bYztZqYMm1f5ziOK5A--~B/aD01NTg7dz05OTI7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/gma/us.abcnews.gma.com/demi-lovato-costume-ht-jt-191029_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
