Low rates have also pushed asset prices higher, generating superior returns for speculative investment rather than traditional business investment.\n\nYou cannot manipulate your way to prosperity; it has to be earned. Attempts to do so simply enrich some at the expense of others, and result in distortions and unintended negative consequences.\n\nMark Engelbrecht\n\nFloreat, WA\n\nSolar\u2019s stellar ROI beats the banks and equities\n\nThe AFR View \u2018\u2018When energy tribes fight, the big stick rules\u2019\u2019 (October 10) missed a significant driver behind the uptake of solar power by households. Interest rates are at historic lows and the return on investment of solar panels is, literally, an order of magnitude or more better than anything available through banks, equity or financial instruments. This is the case whether you factor in government subsidies or not. Best of all, it\u2019s a guaranteed return, through power costs avoided, or income from selling power into the grid, or both.\n\nIf you have around $10,000 to invest, forget the stockmarket; these days it\u2019s almost impossible to beat the return you get from the installation of solar panels.\n\nRussell Colman\n\nSafety Beach, Vic\n\nSuper expense ratios are simply profiteering\n\nThe conclusion that the retail super industry is becoming more competitive by reducing its fees (October 8) does your readers a disservice by failing to point out how ludicrously high expense ratios remain across the entire superannuation industry.\n\nTo claim that an average fee (as a percentage of account balance) of 1.11per cent represents a good outcome ignores the reality that the $31.8 billion in fees Australians pay every year are going to the pockets of overpaid fund managers.\n\nAustralians would do well to read the words of the legendary pioneer of index funds, John Bogle, who in the mid 1970s began to offer extremely low-cost funds to mum and dad investors. Today these types of funds are available to all Australians, and they have expense ratios as low as 0.03per cent.\n\nPlease do your readers a favour and report on their interests, not those of the profiteering super industry (both retail and industry).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJack Goodman\n\nMosman, NSW\n\nBetrayal of Kurds is history repeating itself\n\nI enjoyed Phillip Coorey\u2019s article \u2018\u2018America\u2019s allies can\u2019t ignore Trump\u2019s latest message\u2019\u2019, (October 11). He seems to be one of the few commentators who have an understanding of the Kurds beyond superficial media stereotypes.\n\nThe Kurds number well over 35million people, spread over several troubled Middle Eastern countries. The numbers vary because some countries, like Turkey, deny they are a definite ethnic group. Some call them simply Mountain Arabs. They are the largest nation in the world without their own country, despite a broken promise to give them one after World War II. Despite many betrayals, the Kurdish people have remained loyal to supporters such as the US that have let them down so often in the past.\n\nBob Muirhead\n\nPort Melbourne, Vic\n\nReverse factoring isn\u2019t evil but terms can be\n\nDiscussion of reverse factoring is analogous to the gun debate in the US. Clearly the gun isn\u2019t evil, but the way it is used may be.\n\nReverse factoring, provided at a competitive cost and with equitable terms and conditions, used to obtain early payment of an invoice with fair payment terms, should be a useful financial product.\n\nA transaction where unfair payment terms are imposed on a supplier, combined with reverse factoring to bring forward the payment, at the expense of the supplier is \"evil\".\n\nThe real \u2018\u2018evil\u2019\u2019 is unfair payment terms being imposed on suppliers, which should be addressed.\n\nDanny Sargeant\n\nCurtin, ACT\n\nHarvard seems to miss the point of education\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Harvard University study on international trade (October 12-13) omits education as an Australian export, which the Financial Review has previously acknowledged is \u2018\u2018the country\u2019s third-largest export industry and worth $32.4 billion to the economy\u2019\u2019.\n\nPerhaps the study counted education under Travel & Tourism, a \u2018\u2018low complexity\u2019\u2019 category. Whatever the explanation, something seems amiss.\n\nJanet Burstall\n\nLilyfield, NSW\n\nDo NAB\u2019s computers get paid penalty rates?\n\nWhile NAB\u2019s Phil Chronican is cleaning out the Augean stables, can he ensure the computer keeps working on weekends. If I transfer funds on Friday, it doesn\u2019t show up until Monday, whereas if transferred on Monday it will be credited on Tuesday. Must be worth a smidgen of interest to the bank to shut down transfers over weekends.\n\nPaul Everingham\n\nHamilton, Qld", "description": "Interest rates, bank bashing, stimulus, solar power, superannuation, the Kurds, reverse factoring.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2234%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_108/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/b07b6d7fbb5a523a5b19c6db531e3d71e6daa73a", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
