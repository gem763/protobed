REUTERS/Huseyin Aldemir\n\nSplits in the military alliance have emerged after NATO member Turkey began its offensive in Syria last week, with the governments of EU countries that are also NATO members suspending weapon sales to Turkey.\n\nAppearing in London at a plenary session of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, a body made up of delegates from the legislatures of member states, Stoltenberg said he had expressed deep concerns to Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan when he saw him in Istanbul on Friday.\n\nStoltenberg said he had told Erdogan and his foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, that Turkey\u2019s military operations in northern Syria risked further destabilizing the region, escalating tensions and causing more human suffering.\n\n\u201cI expect Turkey to act with restraint and in coordination with other allies so that we can preserve the gains we have made against our common enemy, Daesh (Islamic State),\u201d he said, adding that one imminent concern was that captive fighters from the jihadist group should not be allowed to escape.\n\nBut during a question-and-answer session after his speech, Stoltenberg faced robust remarks from several delegates, particularly those from France and Belgium, both countries where deadly attacks linked to Islamic State have taken place.\n\nChristian Cambon, a member of the French Senate, said the situation was unacceptable and suggested that Stoltenberg was being too soft on Turkey.\n\n\u201cWe were surprised by the tone of your statement in Istanbul, I have to tell you. Was that in consultation with our great American ally?\u201d Cambon asked, to applause from some of the other delegates.\n\nHe was referring to President Donald Trump\u2019s abrupt decision to pull U.S. troops out of northeastern Syria, which was the catalyst for the Turkish offensive. Ankara views the YPG Kurdish militia in northern Syria as terrorists linked to a Kurdish insurgency being waged inside Turkey.\n\nTURKEY\u2019S ROLE\n\nU.S. and Kurdish troops previously fought together against the Islamic State, and the Kurds have accused Trump of stabbing them in the back.\n\nCambon called on the North Atlantic Council, NATO\u2019s main decision-making body, to convene. He said it should \u201cspeak loudly and clearly in defense of the values of democracy and peace that characterize NATO\u2019s work\u201d.\n\nIn response, Stoltenberg reiterated that he had expressed his deep concerns during his meetings in Istanbul.\n\n\u201cThe only way you can understand what is going on there is also to understand the important role Turkey has played,\u201d said Stoltenberg, a former Norwegian prime minister.\n\n\u201cTurkey is important for NATO. It has proven important in many ways, not least in the fight against Daesh. We have used, as NATO allies, the global coalition, all of us have used infrastructure in Turkey, bases in Turkey in our operations to defeat Daesh.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s exactly one of the reasons why I\u2019m concerned about what is going on now. Because we risk undermining the unity we need in the fight against Daesh.\u201d", "description": "NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on Monday defended his stance on Turkey's attack on Kurdish militants in northeastern Syria as he came under pressure from some members of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly to be tougher with Ankara.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191014&t=2&i=1440841567&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9D0U9", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
