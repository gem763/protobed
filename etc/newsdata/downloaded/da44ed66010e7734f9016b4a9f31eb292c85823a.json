I never expected to be assaulted outside my shop. I can\u2019t believe it happened so quickly.\u201d\n\nThe unprovoked assault happened on Friday, May 17 outside the couple\u2019s deli on Pontcanna Street, which they have been running together since November 2016.\n\nDavid was sweeping and arranging a display outside, while Karen was at the back of the shop, preparing for a wine tasting event.\n\nMartin Warnett was clearing his mother\u2019s home next door, preparing for her to move, and saw David move an A-shaped board advertising items like cheeses, wines and charcuterie.\n\nHe moved the board back and told David: \u201cThis is private property.\u201d\n\n(Image: Richard Swingler/Media Wales)\n\nSpeaking at Cardiff Crown Court , prosecutor Pamela Kaiga said David went over to talk to him, then: \u201cWithout warning, the defendant punched him to the face.\u201d\n\nKaren, 55, said she was working in the back of the shop when the incident happened, adding: \u201cThere he was, standing on the step \u2013 all bloody.\u201d\n\nThe incident was caught on CCTV and Karen said she saw her husband spitting his teeth out onto the floor.\n\nDavid went to A&E at the University Hospital of Wales and was treated for the injuries to his mouth, as well as cuts to his nose and lips.\n\nKaren said her husband\u2019s two front teeth were knocked out by the punch and he has already had five or six trips to the dentist.\n\nThe dental treatment has cost more than \u00a36,000 so far and is expected to take another year.\n\n(Image: Media Wales)\n\nShe explained her husband\u2019s teeth were \u201csmashed\u201d and he will have to have dental implants, adding: \u201cHe is still in a lot of pain.\u201d\n\nKaren, who is having tests to be a kidney donor, said David has stage five renal failure and had to delay his treatment while having dental surgery.\n\nIn a statement read out in court, David said he liked to keep the area outside the shop clean and tidy and could not believe he had been punched because of a dispute about the board.\n\nFollowing the assault, Warnett went into another shop and admitted he had just hit someone. That shopkeeper noticed a cut on his hand and thought he looked \u201cedgy\u201d.\n\nPolice officers found the defendant at Sophia Gardens and he told them: \u201cI hit him. I punched him once to the face.\u201d\n\nWarnett claimed: \u201cHe came out shouting and swearing with a broom. I feared I was going to get hurt.\"\n\n(Image: Richard Swingler/Media Wales)\n\nThe defendant told the police he had a previous caution for assault and had tried to stay \u201cout of trouble\u201d, but believed the shopkeeper was going to hit him with the broom.\n\nProsecutors said he did not have any previous convictions, but he was cautioned in November 2015 for common assault in Cathays .\n\nMs Kaiga told the court: \u201cHe had an issue with where the victim had parked her car. He shouted at her and proceeded to kick her car then slapped her in the face.\u201d\n\nWarnett, 47, from Nant y Wedal in Cathays, admitted inflicting grievous bodily harm.\n\n(Image: Richard Swingler/Media Wales)\n\nGareth Morley, defending, said his client had kept out of trouble since his caution four years ago. He pointed out this incident involved a single punch and no weapon was used.\n\nHe accepted the dispute about the A-board was \u201ca very trivial matter\u201d and \u201cabsolutely petty\u201d.\n\nMr Morley said Warnett is not working and has to pay a mortgage, as well as supporting his wife and children, while living on savings.\n\nJudge Eleri Rees replied: \u201cHe is going to have to pay compensation.\u201d\n\nShe noted the assault happened \u201ccompletely out of the blue\u201d and caused injuries that were \u201cunpleasant and distressing\u201d.\n\nThe judge added: \u201cIt seems to me it was completely unprovoked and out of proportion to what should have been a minor irritation.\n\n(Image: Richard Swingler/Media Wales)\n\n\u201cThis was a petty dispute which should never have resulted in violence. You have an issue with your temper, it seems to me, at times.\u201d\n\nWarnett was given a 12-month community order, requiring him to complete 120 hours of unpaid work and 20 days of a rehabilitation activity.\n\nHe will have to pay \u00a38,000 in compensation, plus an \u00a385 victim surcharge within the next year. A two-year restraining order was imposed.\n\nSpeaking after the hearing, Karen said she thought it was important the defendant should pay for the dental work.\n\nShe said she thought it was a \u201clight sentence\u201d and there may be nothing left of the compensation once the dentist bills have been paid.", "description": "WARNING - DISTRESSING FOOTAGE: A Cardiff shopkeeper had his front teeth knocked out in a brawl with his neighbour's son, following a dispute over who's property an advertising board sat on", "authors": ["Liz Day", "Image", "Richard Swingler Media Wales", "Media Wales"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20637893.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_JS1960953201.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
