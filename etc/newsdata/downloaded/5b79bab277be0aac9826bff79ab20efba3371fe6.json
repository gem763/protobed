He threw 34 pitches in that game.\n\nMartinez said Thursday that Strasburg came to him and said he wanted the ball for Game 2 against the Dodgers. The NLDS opened Thursday in Los Angeles. Game 3 is Sunday night in Washington.\n\nThis will allow Strasburg to pitch Game 5 on Wednesday in Los Angeles, if the series goes that far.
