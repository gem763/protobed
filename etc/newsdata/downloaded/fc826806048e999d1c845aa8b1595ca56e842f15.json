He also said that the committee would work through a two-week recess that is slated to start on Friday.\n\nEarly indications suggest that articles of impeachment may be filed by the end of October.", "description": "Just days after announcing a formal impeachment inquiry, Nancy Pelosi says that attorney general William Barr has \u201cgone rogue\u201d to protect Donald Trump\u2019s presidency.", "authors": ["Clark Mindock"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/27/08/nancy-pelosi.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
