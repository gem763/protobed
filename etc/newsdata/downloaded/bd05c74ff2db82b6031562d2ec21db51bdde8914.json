Susie delayed chemotherapy out of fear for her baby, and ended up having to cope with the combination of treatment for cancer, looking after a newborn, and postpartum depression all at the same time.\n\nShe survived, created her company, ECHO VIE, and now shares her story to show others they can make it through their darkest times.\n\n\u2018It was very difficult,\u2019 Susie tells Metro.co.uk. \u2018I have to be honest and say that thoughts of suicide would creep through my brain.\n\n\u2018It was all too much and I felt like I was drowning\u2026 I just wanted it all to stop.\n\n\u2018But I would imagine a black pond and only allow myself to dip my toes into the bad thoughts. I would not allow myself to plunge into the water, for fear that I wouldn\u2019t get out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018The only thing that kept me sane was my baby. He helped me get through that time.\u2019\n\nThe first time Susie was told she had cancer was while she was in university (Picture: courtesy of Susie Lee)\n\nThe first time Susie, from Chicago, was diagnosed with cancer she was 20 years old and between her third and fourth year at university.\n\nShe often had coughs and colds but assumed that was just a symptom of living in dorm rooms among loads of other students.\n\nBut then she noticed a small, painless, swollen bump on the left side of her neck, close to her collarbone. Susie went to get it checked but was dismissed as just getting over another cold.\n\nThat was until one doctor gave Susie a chest x-ray, which revealed a growth in her chest.\n\nShe underwent surgery for the removal of the node as well as radiation.\n\nThe second diagnosis came over a decade later, when Susie was six months pregnant with her first child.\n\nThe second time, she was pregnant with her first child (Picture: Susie Lee)\n\nWhile on a babymoon to Mexico, Susie noticed that the underwire of her bra was poking into her chest and causing her pain. She dismissed it as just your standard irritation from a cheap bra, but days later the bump was still there.\n\nShe made an appointment for a checkup and was diagnosed with breast cancer.\n\n\u2018When I felt a lump in my breast, I thought surely this is something normal that happens to pregnant women,\u2019 says Susie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018But I did have a gut feeling that something was not quite right.\n\n\u2018I went straight away to get it looked at with an ultrasound. In the same afternoon, I had a core biopsy which confirmed that it was breast cancer. I was in complete disbelief and went\n\nnumb. I was absolutely devastated to find out that I had cancer, again.\u2019\n\nBeing pregnant added a new layer to Susie\u2019s concerns.\n\nShe tells us: \u2018Before, I only had to worry about my own body, but this time I had another life to worry about\u2026 it was awful.\n\nThe makeup artist decided to delay chemotherapy until after giving birth (Picture: Susie Lee)\n\n\u2018To add insult to injury, I would have loved to drink myself into a stupor, but my usual coping method was not an option.\u2019\n\nDespite her doctor recommending immediate treatment, Susie made the difficult decision to delay chemotherapy until after the birth of her child.\n\nShe had to have a lumpectomy while pregnant, however, and needed to be awake during surgery.\n\n\u2018I had to really meditate and focus during the surgery because I wanted to keep both our heart rates down, because I could have gone into spontaneous labour,\u2019 Susie explains.\n\nThe doctors ended up inducing her baby two weeks early in order to start treatment. Thankfully the baby was healthy.\n\nA month after her first son was born, Susie began treatment.\n\nThat meant she had to deal with chemotherapy while also raising her first child and facing postpartum depression (Picture: Susie Lee)\n\n\u2018I chose to delay treatment by a month,\u2019 she says. \u2018We were planning a bi-lateral mastectomy after birth, but I wanted to be able to breastfeed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018So a month postpartum, we began chemotherapy. Every step of the way I had to make really difficult choices for treatment.\n\n\u2018Some of my doctors were really pushing me to proceed with chemotherapy during pregnancy, but I just couldn\u2019t allow that to happen. We can only have a glass of wine occasionally, but you can pump me full of toxic chemicals and it\u2019s ok for the baby? I was skeptical. I chose to wait until after birth.\n\n\u2018I knew that it was caught early, so I gambled with time and made the decision to have the experience that I would never be able to have again. I really wanted to breastfeed, and I\u2019m happy that I had the opportunity.\u2019\n\nThe months that followed were hard.\n\nAlongside dealing with all the ways her body had changed thanks to pregnancy and labour, Susie was faced with side-effects from chemotherapy that made her \u2018completely miserable\u2019 \u2013 all while raising a newborn and battling postpartum depression.\n\nThe immense challenges she had faced pushed Susie to make some changes.\n\nGoing through treatment radically changed Susie\u2019s outlook (Picture: Susie Lee)\n\nThe mum had long used makeup as a tool to enhance people\u2019s unique beauty and inspire confidence and was overjoyed to be able to continue her work as a makeup artist after giving birth.\n\nGetting pregnant and dealing with cancer for the second time made her consider the impact of products she was using on health. She changed up her diet, cleaned out her personal care products, and became more critical of everything she purchased, avoiding highly processed food and beauty items containing any dodgy chemicals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPlus, chemotherapy had wrecked Susie\u2019s skin. She needed ultra-nourishing skincare products that were all-natural, actually worked, and that made her feel good.\n\nStruggling to find products that met those requirements, Susie began making her own in her kitchen. At first, these natural skincare items were just for Susie and her family, but soon she began using them on set during work, and people asked if they could get their own.\n\nThat\u2019s how ECHO VIE, Susie\u2019s holistic skincare line, was born.\n\nIt also changed her view on beauty and led to the launch of her skincare business, ECHO VIE (Picture: Susie Lee)\n\nHer experiences with cancer helped not only to create her business, but changed the way Susie sees her own beauty \u2013 and how she views every other part of her life.\n\n\u2018I am trying to be as gentle as I can to myself and my body,\u2019 Susie tells us. \u2018I am not keen on needles and surgery because of all that I\u2019ve already endured.\n\n\u2018My experiences have helped me to create deeper connections to the people around me, especially my son. I spend as much time with him as I can; and not time where he\u2019s doing one activity, and I\u2019m mindlessly on my phone.\n\n\u2018We have conversations, laugh and play together. I\u2019ve spoked to him about cancer and death, which sounds so morbid, but he seems to understand.\u2019\n\nUnfortunately, Susie\u2019s experience with cancer didn\u2019t end after the arrival of her son.\n\nNot long after finishing chemotherapy, Susie felt another lump. It was removed, tested, and came back positive for cancer.\n\nThen, in April 2018, Susie was diagnosed with cancer for the fourth time. More surgery followed.\n\nSusie is now the owner of a business, a mum to a son, and a four-time cancer survivor, (Picture: Susie Lee)\n\nToday Susie continues to live life to its full potential, knowing full well just how fragile it can be.\n\nShe shares her story openly with her Instagram followers in the hope that she\u2019ll show others struggling that they\u2019re not alone and inspire people to live life to the full.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s crazy that it doesn\u2019t matter how many times it happens, nothing can prepare you for the avalanche of thoughts that take over your brain when you\u2019re told you have cancer,\u2019 Susie says.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve learned that no one is guaranteed a long life, so you must live each day. I care less about what people think of me. I try and take care of my mental, emotional, and physical state of being.\n\n\u2018After my second time going through chemotherapy, I felt like time was so precious. I didn\u2019t want to waste any of it.\u2019\n\nDo you have a powerful story to share?
