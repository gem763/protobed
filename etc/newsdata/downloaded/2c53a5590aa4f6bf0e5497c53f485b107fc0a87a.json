Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it\u2026 It sounds horrible to me.\"\n\nFolks, it's all there \u2014 or most of it, anyway.\n\nOne of the reasons why there's so much focus on the process of the impeachment story \u2014 the resolution, the upcoming vote, how the White House is handling the investigation (or not) \u2014 is because we already know most of the story.\n\nAnd that only adds pressure for Democrats to wrap it up ASAP.\n\nAs we assumed, it wasn't a complete transcript after all\n\nLt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the top Ukraine expert on President Trump's National Security Council, told members of Congress Tuesday that the White House's transcription memo of that July 25 call between Trump and Ukraine's president omitted words and phrases, the New York Times first reported, according to three people familiar with his testimony.\n\nThose omissions included:\n\n1. \"Trump's assertion that there were recordings of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. discussing Ukraine corruption.\"\n\n2. \"[A]n explicit mention by Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelensky, of Burisma Holdings, the energy company whose board employed Mr. Biden's son Hunter.\"\n\nThe Times adds that Vindman told House impeachment investigators \"that he tried to change the reconstructed transcript made by the White House staff to reflect the omissions. But while some of his edits appeared to have been successful, he said, those two corrections were not made.\"\n\nAs NBC's Peter Alexander flags, Trump said this about the transcription memo at his Oct. 2 news conference: \"I had a transcript done by very, very talented people \u2014 word for word, comma for comma. Done by people that do it for a living. We had an exact transcript.\"\n\nRemember, when we made a big deal out of those ellipses in that transcription memo? Well, you now know why\u2026\n\nImpeachment inquiry update\n\nTestifying today on Capitol Hill are Catherine Croft (a State Department special adviser for Ukraine) and Christopher Anderson (a former special adviser to Ambassador Kurt Volker), per NBC's Geoff Bennett.\n\nAlso, the House Rules Committee is meeting at 3:00 pm ET to mark up (or debate and amend) the resolution to formalize the next steps of the impeachment inquiry.\n\n2020 Vision: Obama criticizes liberal \"purity\" tests\n\nHe hasn't talked much about the 2020 race, so what Barack Obama said yesterday at his Foundation summit caught our attention.\n\n\"This idea of purity and you're never compromised and you're politically woke, and all that stuff\u2014you should get over that pretty quickly. The world is messy. There are ambiguities. People who do really good stuff have flaws,\" he said, per The Atlantic's Edward-Isaac Dovere.\n\nObama added that he's not impressed with those on Twitter who criticize others for not being good enough. \"That's not activism. That's not bringing about change. If all you're doing is casting stones, you're probably not going to get that far.\"\n\nOn the campaign trail today\n\nJoe Biden stumps in Iowa, holding a town hall in Maquoketa and then a community event in Dubuque\u2026 Elizabeth Warren holds a town hall in Durham, N.H\u2026.

NBC's Benjamin Pu reports: \"One voter specifically asked Warren how she would go after Trump when he calls her 'Pocahontas' - which is the first time I've heard voters reference that in a while - and she got into a fiery answer that resonated with the voters here. 'But we got a lot of America - a lot more than 50 percent of America - that is tired of the ugliness, that is tired of the name-calling, that is tired of the disgusting behavior, that is tired of the fact that we now have a President of the United States who embarrasses us around the world, who cuts and runs on allies who stood with us and fought alongside us,' said Warren.\"\n\nWarren was later asked how she'd break up gridlock in D.C., saying, \"No. 1 in my list is get elected to the White House and No. 2 is to put Mitch McConnell out of a job.\" After the event and during a gaggle with reporters, per Pu, \"Warren was asked that if the impeachment reached the Senate if she would come off the trail to go back to the Hill: 'We have a responsibility here and it's not something that I take any pleasure in, but it's something that has to be done so I'll be there.'\"\n\nData Download: And the number of the day is \u2026 14 days.\n\nFourteen days.\n\nThat was how long ex-Trump adviser George Papadopoulos's prison sentence was in 2018 after he pled guilty to lying to the FBI in the Mueller probe.\n\nNow, Papadopoulos has filed FEC paperwork and launched a website for a congressional run in California's 25th district, just days after Democratic Rep.
