The racist comment sparked outrage among viewers and went viral, and Housden made her on-air apology the following day.\n\n\u201cI want to apologize not only to my co-anchor, Jason, but to our entire community,\u201d she said through tears.\n\n\u201cI said something yesterday that was inconsiderate, it was inappropriate and I hurt people. And I want you to know I understand how much I hurt you out there and how much I hurt you,\u201d she added, turning to Hackett.\n\nShe told the anchor that she loved him, considered him a best friend and knew what she said was wrong.\n\n\u201cI do accept your apology and I do appreciate your apology,\u201d Hackett responded, adding that he considers her a best friend too. \u201cI do appreciate you and I do love you. All that being said ... what [Alex] said yesterday was wrong. It cut deep for me and it cut deep for a lot of you in the community.\u201d\n\nHackett said he wanted this to be a teachable moment for everyone.\n\n\u201cThe lesson here is that words matter,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re becoming a more diverse country. ... We have to understand the stereotypes and each other\u2019s backgrounds and the words that hurt, the words that cut deep. And we have to find a way to replace those words with love and words of affirmation as well.\u201d\n\nKOCO President Brent Hensley told HuffPost the station had no additional statements to make about the \u201cunfortunate incident.\u201d", "description": "KOCO's Alex Housden made the racist comment to Jason Hackett after a story about the primate at the Oklahoma City Zoo.", "authors": ["Senior Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d6561d22500004e00877e45.png?cache=ysomvclhuf&ops=1778_1000"}
