Do you know who the car-finance guys really miss? \u201cSaab,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Saab customer was the best.\u201d The people who bought Saabs turned out to be as sensible and practical as the people who designed them \u2014 good credit, appropriate incomes, sensible down payments. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like Porsche or Land Rover,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody bought a Saab because it fulfilled some fantasy.\u201d But fantasy moves a lot of cars, too. I used to know a guy who owned a used-car dealership, one of those buy here, pay here, your job is your credit! places that cater to the low end of the market. Not the Saab buyer. One afternoon, he sold a flashy 280ZX to an obvious no-money scrub. But he wasn\u2019t worried. \u201cI\u2019ve already sold that car nine times,\u201d he told his friends, \u201cand when this guy misses his payment, I\u2019ll repo it and sell it again.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSaab is long gone, but there are still Saab types out there. A lot of them, in fact, and lenders love doing business with them \u2014 not only automotive lenders but other kinds of consumer lenders, mortgage lenders, credit-card companies, commercial banks, etc. People with banged-up credit, negligible savings, lower incomes, etc. may present more tempting investments on paper, because they pay higher interest rates and more fees, but you have to do a lot of work to collect that extra revenue, and that work costs money \u2014 which is, of course, why it\u2019s only the Saab guys who get to borrow on Saab-guy terms. But not everybody is a Saab guy, and the alternative for the scrubs isn\u2019t some magical regulatory solution that empowers them to borrow on Saab-guy terms \u2014 the alternative is little or no access to credit at all.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nElizabeth Warren has the soul of a Saab guy \u2014 and a constituency of Saab guys who think they know what\u2019s best for the scrubs.\n\nSenator Warren has made a crusade of interfering with the business of payday lending, a high-risk, high-interest portion of the consumer-credit game in which borrowers with few or no alternatives take out unsecured short-term loans intended to tide them over until the next payday. Typically, a payday loan has a repayment period of a couple of weeks. (The term \u201cpayday loan\u201d is a figure of speech, with repayment rarely actually connected to paydays.) The fees may be modest in absolute terms, say $13 on a $100 loan paid back in two weeks, but that $13 two-week fee ends up looking absurdly usurious when expressed as an annualized rate of several thousand percent. It\u2019s especially bad if you assume compounding debt, i.e., that the borrower will go back and borrow again on the same terms every two weeks to cover the principal and accumulated interest. When you read about a payday loan with an APR of 34,125 percent or something approximately that outrageous, that\u2019s what you are reading about.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt looks like a terrible arrangement, until you ask the always-relevant question: Compared with what?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeople do not turn to payday lenders because they temporarily misplaced their American Express Platinum cards. Borrowers turn to payday lenders because those are, as the borrowers calculate, their best alternative \u2014 maybe their best bad alternative, but their best alternative nonetheless. All that silly talk about \u201cpredatory\u201d lenders is little more than rhetorical cover for the patronizing insistence that poor people are too stupid or dysfunctional to make their own financial decisions. (And maybe they are; if that\u2019s your argument, say so.) But first take reality into account: As the payday lenders themselves are eager to point out, their allegedly usurious interest rates compare pretty favorably with the plausible alternatives: bank-overdraft fees, or late fees and penalties on credit-card debt, utility bills, and housing payments. The real-world near competitors to payday lending \u2014 pawn shops and car-title loans \u2014 do not have a great deal to recommend them, and in many cases they are worse for borrowers than payday loans are. And because so many low-income and bad-credit borrowers already have bad debt in collection, gentler and more orthodox alternatives \u2014 lines of credit through a bank or credit union, short-term lending in the guise of \u201coverdraft protection\u201d \u2014 often are off the table. So unless you have something worth selling or borrowing money against, the choice ends up being a payday loan or informal borrowing from friends and family. (That the latter option apparently is unavailable to so many people speaks to a broad and significant failing in American civil society.) Or risking eviction or having the lights turned off. Or not being able to provide something immediately needful to your children.\n\nBeing poor sucks, and no regulation is going to change that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSenator Warren\u2019s immediate target is the likely repeal of a 2017 rule from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the regulatory love child of her and the Obama administration, that requires payday lenders to perform much of the same loan underwriting that a bank would when extending consumer credit: verifying employment and income, analyzing the borrower\u2019s existing obligations and assets, and then lending exclusively to those who meet a certain standard described as \u201cability to repay.\u201d (Willingness to repay is a big part of the lending equation in the real world, but never mind that for now.) The problem is that borrowers who can satisfy ordinary bank-underwriting standards can just go to banks, and those who go to payday lenders do so because they can\u2019t \u2014 and also because the bank-lending process is more invasive, time-consuming, and, in many cases, humiliating, especially for the tens of millions of Americans who have no bank account and rarely if ever set foot in a bank. In fact, the Pew Charitable Trusts \u2014 not remarkably friendly to payday lending \u2014 found in a survey that many borrowers turned to payday lending particularly to avoid those things. (And many of them ended up turning to more conventional lending to pay off their payday loans.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a slavishly cheerleading piece on Senator Warren\u2019s campaign, Emily Stewart of Vox accurately described the senator\u2019s fundamental agenda: empowering a \u201ccadre of energetic, ideologically committed regulators.\u201d (That Vox apparently believes \u201cideologically committed regulators\u201d are to be preferred to regulators whose commitment is to the law rather than to ideology says a great deal about the state of the progressive mind circa 2019.) But ideology does not trump math. Of course, the government can lean on lenders to make more credit available on easier terms to scrub borrowers. That\u2019s a big part of what created the subprime-mortgage meltdown, and what is likely to produce the next one. The same thinking helped create that $1 trillion\u2013plus in student-loan debt and encouraged tuition inflation at the same time. Risk comes with a price, and somebody is going to pay it \u2014 either the borrower, or someone else, or everybody else.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the short term, the question is whether our laws will be made by our lawmakers in Congress or whether they will be cooked up by Senator Warren\u2019s \u201ccadre of energetic, ideologically committed regulators,\u201d which is what the CFPB was designed to be, and is. If the federal government wants to preempt the states in the matter of regulating payday lending (which already is prohibited outright or severely limited in many states), then it should at least go through the motions of passing a law. And then the people\u2019s elected representatives can bear whatever political price there is to pay for cutting poor people off from the credit that, defective though it may be, is what they have.\n\nBut in the long term, we are going to have to answer the question of just how patronizing we intend to be toward people with low incomes and modest means. If we allow the market to produce credit products for them, then we can be quite confident that the market will charge them relatively high prices, reflecting the relatively high risk of lending to people without much in the way of money or good credit. We could enact proactive measures such as forced-savings programs that would tax the earnings of the poor and then make these funds available on an emergency basis subject to the approval of their masters. We could distribute maps to the nearest food pantries and homeless shelters on the theory that would-be payday borrowers are better off relying on philanthropy than on credit.\n\nOr we could have some more vague politicians\u2019 talk about the \u201crigged economy,\u201d as though people could be shriven of responsibility for their own financial condition by the ministrations of senators and presidents. That\u2019s what we\u2019ll get from Senator Warren, and from other patronizing, self-appointed tribunes of the plebs.\n\nOf course, there are a lot of broke-ass suburbanites driving around in Land Rovers they cannot really afford. It is not only the poor who make bad financial decisions. (I could produce a conspectus of my own.) But the poor always have less room for error, and for their errors, as for most things, they pay a proportionally higher price. Simply cutting the poor off from credit is one way to keep them from going more deeply into debt, but that will produce consequences nobody will much like, the poor themselves least of all. If the payday lenders are regulated out of existence, Senator Warren et al. will find someone else to blame, a new scapegoat. They\u2019ll probably end up creating one, in fact, without ever intending to or quite understanding that they have.\n\nThis article appears as \u201cSaab Guys and Scrubs\u201d in the October 14, 2019, print edition of National Review.", "description": "On Saab guys and scrubs.", "authors": ["Kevin D.
