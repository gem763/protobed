I made a mistake, and I unwittingly used hugely culturally insensitive language.\"\n\nBut it did not sate critics, with China's state-run Global Times newspaper claiming that Mr Donovan's apology was \"not sincere\" and reflected \"the deep arrogance of Western elites to Chinese culture\".\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nIt is a delicate time for Western companies operating in China, as Beijing faces an escalating trade war with the US and political unrest in Hong Kong.\n\nIn August, the boss of British-backed Cathay Pacific - Hong Kong's biggest airline - had to step down over his muddled response to pro-democracy protests in the territory.\n\nLast week, the Financial Times reported that a lawyer for investment bank BNP Paribas in Hong Kong had quit after he posted comments on Facebook about the protests.\n\nJason Ng criticised \"pro-Beijing counter-protesters\" caught up in the recent unrest, saying that \"very soon, flag-waving communist party loyalists will be forming human chains across the city and launching their own 'China Way' campaign\".", "description": "Paul Donovan sparked outcry after saying a swine fever outbreak only mattered to \"Chinese pigs\".", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6C74/production/_109046772_gettyimages-148209715.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
