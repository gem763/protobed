Her upbringing has driven her groundbreaking work as a historian, documenting the creation and expansion of border patrol and how Los Angeles came to operate the largest jail system in the world. Her most innovative project, Million Dollar Hoods, has mapped the nearly $1bn cost of incarcerating 17,000 people in LA.\n\nThe 45-year-old University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), professor recently added \u201cgenius\u201d to her r\u00e9sum\u00e9, as a recipient of the prestigious MacArthur Fellowship award. She\u2019s working on a new book about a group of Mexican intellectuals and workers who launched a revolution when they came to the United States in the early 20th century, driven out of Mexico by the dictator Porfirio D\u00edaz.\n\nThe activist scholar talked to the Guardian about challenging the field of history and what prison abolition means to her. The conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity.\n\nCan you tell me about growing up in San Diego and the memories that stick with you in your work today?\n\nOne powerful memory is from elementary school, around third grade. I was on the school yard with a friend who was weeping because her uncle had been taken the night before to be deported. Being with her in her grief and trauma was incredibly impactful. I did not live with that fear because I don\u2019t come from an immigrant family. But that pain ripples across the border. We all live inside of that trauma and we\u2019ve accepted it as normal, but it\u2019s not normal.\n\nHow the US built the world's largest immigrant detention system Read more\n\nThat experience helped me understand what happens when someone is taken away \u2013 the aftermath for the family, for the community. It also helped me to see what was happening in my own community. Every time a young black male in particular, but young women as well, were taken away, I understood it in relationship to our own history as African Americans, but also in terms of the regime that I was watching so powerfully around me disappear people daily through deportation. I\u2019m full of stories of being sat on the curb, being accused of being a gang member, being put on a gang list, having my locker opened up and searched for drugs. All of that drives the work I do.\n\nYou\u2019ve talked about building a \u201crebel archive\u201d to document the history of incarceration. What does that term mean to you?\n\nA \u201crebel archive\u201d includes the voices and the acts of the people who fought the rise of mass incarceration, the rebels themselves.\n\nWe are training a new generation of black, brown, indigenous, first-generation students in the field\n\nIt\u2019s also the set of records that evaded police destruction across centuries. The LAPD and LA sheriff\u2019s department run the jails of LA and have destroyed the vast majority of their records. I had to go and find whatever record did survive \u2013 in newspaper articles, legal battles, in songs that had been written by migrants about their experiences with incarceration, in photographs, in pamphlets, all these different places. The point was to look beyond traditional places, to hear the voices, to incorporate the lives of people who have been rebellious and marginalized.\n\nWhat have been the biggest obstacles in developing Million Dollar Hoods?\n\nMillion Dollar Hoods is a big data project. We map how much is being spent on incarceration per neighborhood in Los Angeles, and we\u2019re now expanding to other jurisdictions. I had to acquire arrest and jail booking data from law enforcement agencies. It was extraordinarily difficult.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A map from the Million Dollar Hoods project. Photograph: Screen shot/Million Dollar Hoods\n\nEvery time a law enforcement agency told me no, that just drove me even more. I knocked on door after door for almost a year just to get first data set. My position is that when we are legally entitled to data, we are going to demand it rather than negotiate for it. A negotiation often involves writing away some of your freedoms.\n\nThis project also thrives, because we are training a new generation of black, brown, indigenous, first-generation students in the field. I\u2019m not sure how many top universities have data science classes that look as diverse as ours.\n\nWhat do you want people to take away from these maps and what you have uncovered so far?\n\nIn some communities in Los Angeles, we\u2019re spending over a million dollars per year locking up local residents and that is money we are throwing away. The vast majority of charges are drug possession and DUI. Those are public health crises. So when you see those neighborhoods light up in red, you know that is a community that needs to have a significant shift in how public resources are spent \u2013 away from policing, incarceration and into social and family support services.\n\nThere is no singular policy solution to the problem of mass incarceration\n\nWhat\u2019s it going to take to have that shift on a large scale?\n\nI think about this over the long arc of time \u2013 understanding that mass incarceration comes out of the colonization of the American west, the occupation of indigenous land, the end of enslavement. These are core problems around belonging and race in the United States.\n\nThere is no singular policy solution to the problem of mass incarceration, mass deportation, the carceral state. We need to have an extensive process of truth, reparation and reconciliation where the world of possibilities is opened anew for us. Right now, I don\u2019t think we have the capacity to imagine the solution to the extraordinary problems. We need a mass public education campaign about the harms that have been done, the assets that have been stripped, the families and communities that have been strategically damaged and ripped apart across the arc of the American story.\n\nYou identify as a prison abolitionist, correct? Can you tell me what that means to you in 2019?\n\nI do consider myself an abolitionist. What I think is most important is to not center on prison but to rather focus on the support services that we need outside of prisons to ensure thriving families and communities. What is happening inside is incredibly important, but I also spend a lot of time talking about what families need. It comes back to housing, employment, education, healthcare, mental and physical wellbeing. My focus is making sure that we amplify what we need so that we can squeeze out what we don\u2019t.\n\nWhat do you think are the biggest stories about the carceral system that the media is missing or that the public doesn\u2019t understand?\n\nWe\u2019ve done a wonderful job of bringing more attention to the crisis at the US-Mexico border and the children and families who are being locked up and impacted and locked out. I hope that we can also use this moment to talk about the children of the imprisoned, and the trauma that the loss of a parent can involve. I hope that we can build from this to consider all of these communities that have been so deeply impacted by the carceral state.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Million Dollar Hoods team.

If every person in the United States could have a sensibility of the history of the land that they occupy, I hope that would open up new opportunities for our conversation about racial justice.\n\nWhat does it mean for the MacArthur Foundation to honor someone like you who is an \u201cactivist historian\u201d or \u201cmovement-driven scholar\u201d?\n\nThe academy has taken great strides in acknowledging and valuing socially engaged, movement-driven work. But there\u2019s a lot more work to be done to actually seed and sustain this kind of work, which is rigorous and scholarly, deeply archival, grounded in the literature \u2013 and is also responsive to concerns and demands of contemporary social movements.\n\nWhen I wrote my first book, Migra! A History of the US Border Patrol, many scholars doubted me and questioned why I wrote this as a story of race in America. Growing up on the US-Mexico border, it never dawned on me there was another way to tell this story. But the academy wasn\u2019t there yet, they were stuck on questions of immigrant incorporation and Americanization. But my own experience was telling me something different.\n\nWhat I\u2019m trying to emphasize is that we should be accountable to the questions that are happening in the public, not just within our peer-reviewed journals. In my work, we are accountable to the communities that are most impacted by mass incarceration and mass deportation, period.", "description": "Kelly Lytle Hern\u00e1ndez, who received the MacArthur \u2018genius\u2019 grant, views prison abolition through the eyes of rebels", "authors": ["Sam Levin"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aae908f7e66291b3eefbc1d351b48032a2a9a83d/0_227_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e0c3f1f98e0be1b1b4a34704c3b5a429", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
