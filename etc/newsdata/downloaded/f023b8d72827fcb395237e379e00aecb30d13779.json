REUTERS/Baz Ratner/File Photo\n\nU.S. travellers should \u201cexercise increased caution\u201d, the State Department said on Friday in an updated travel advisory that cited reports of \u201ca probable Ebola-related death in Dar es Salaam\u201d.\n\nTanzania denies the reports, saying no cases of Ebola have been confirmed, but with transparency key to combating the deadly and fast-spreading haemorrhagic fever, the government is under mounting pressure to provide clarification.\n\nThe foreign affairs ministry was not immediately available on Saturday for comment on the U.S. advisory.\n\nAuthorities in east and central Africa have been on high alert for possible spillovers of Ebola from the Democratic Republic of Congo, where a year-long outbreak has killed more than 2,100 people.\n\nTanzania and DRC share a border that is separated by a lake.\n\nIn a rare public rebuke, the World Health Organisation (WHO) last week said that, contrary to international health regulations, Tanzania was refusing to provide details of suspected cases.\n\nDays earlier, the head of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention travelled to Tanzania at the direction of U.S. Health Secretary Alex Azar, who had also criticised the country for not sharing information.\n\nThe WHO said that, while it was concerned by the lack of transparency, it has no evidence on the presence of Ebola in Tanzania, but ruled out punitive action and reiterated it had advised against travel or trade restrictions.\n\nTanzania on Tuesday summoned the WHO\u2019s local representative over its assertion. In mid-September, the health minister said the government had investigated two recent cases of unknown illnesses, but they tested negative for Ebola.", "description": "The United States has warned its citizens to take extra care when visiting Tanzania\u00a0amid concerns over Ebola, adding to calls for the East African country to share information about suspected cases of the deadly disease there.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190928&t=2&i=1434822737&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8R07C", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
