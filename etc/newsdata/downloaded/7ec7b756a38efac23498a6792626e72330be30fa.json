I hadn\u2019t seen him approach, just the flash of his cape in the corner of my eye.\n\nThen I heard the roar as the chain saw came to life, saw the flash of the blade as he held it high in the air. It slashed downward and into my guts and I fell to the floor. Everyone laughed.\n\nIt was Halloween , 1979, and the chain saw was just rubber, and of course I was fine. What did I think, that my friend John Moynihan was really going to kill me with a chain saw? It was funny, the theatricality of the feint. But what the pirates and sexy nurses and zombies all around me had found especially entertaining was the look on my face, which had clearly betrayed \u2014 just for an instant \u2014 my fear that the chain saw was no toy.\n\nStill: As long as I was not dead it was all a good time.\n\nFear is a thrill right up to the moment you\u2019re in actual danger. Beyond that: not so much. The first time I took my daughter to the Haunted Mansion at Disneyland, I was smiling ear to ear. Pianos playing by themselves! Specters flickering in and out!
