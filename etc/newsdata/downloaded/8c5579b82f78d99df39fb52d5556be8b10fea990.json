The violent street gang, based out of El Salvador, has built a growing army of El Salvadoran illegal and legal immigrants in the U.S.\n\nAccording to prosecutors, Guzman was lured by the two illegal aliens into a remote location for a fight. When the victim arrived, prosecutors said Garcia-Hernandez and Iraheta-Vega beat the 16-year-old boy with a baseball and then tortured him by hacking off his limbs with a machete and leaving his dead body in a nearby river.\n\nThe illegal aliens are each being held in King County Jail on a $3 million bond.\n\nAs Breitbart News has chronicled, King County has routinely shielded criminal illegal aliens from arrest and deportation. In a recent case, an illegal alien rapist was released from prison and allegedly hunted down his victim \u2014 a disabled woman \u2014 and attacked her. The illegal alien is now wanted for the attack and is believed to have fled to Mexico.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.
