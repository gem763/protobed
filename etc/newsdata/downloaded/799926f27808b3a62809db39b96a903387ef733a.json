(AP Photo/Elias Asmare, File)\n\nCAIRO (AP) \u2014 Irrigation ministers of three key Nile Basin countries were meeting Friday in Sudan\u2019s capital, seeking to resolve differences over Ethiopia\u2019s soon-to-be-finished Blue Nile dam, which Cairo claims threatens its water supply.\n\nAccording to the spokesman of Egypt\u2019s irrigation ministry, Muhamed El-Sebai, the meeting of the ministers from Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia would last two days.\n\nEgypt fears Ethiopia\u2019s $5 billion project, which is set to be Africa\u2019s largest hydraulic dam, could reduce its share of the Nile River _ a lifeline for Egypt\u2019s 100 million people.\n\nEthiopia has roughly the same population and says the dam will help its economic development. Egypt seeks Sudan's support in the dispute, as both nations are downriver from the project.\n\nEthiopia has not revealed how quickly it wants to fill the reservoir created by the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, as the project is called, which would affect the amount of water available for Egypt and Sudan.\n\nThe last round of talks held in Cairo last month failed to make any progress and was followed by a verbal feuds between Ethiopian and Egyptian governments. Ethiopia\u2019s foreign ministry released a strongly-worded proposal dismissing Egypt\u2019s proposals on a timetable for filling the reservoir.\n\nEthiopia's minister of water and irrigation, Sileshi Bekele, had said that Egypt wants Ethiopia to fill the dam's reservoir over a longer period of time \u2014 seven years \u2014 and to release 40 billion cubic meters of water every year.\n\nHowever, an Egyptian official later told The Associated Press the two countries had agreed the first of five stages for filling the dam should take two years. After these five stages, all the dam's hydroelectric turbines would be able to operate.\n\nOtherwise, Egypt could lose more than 1 million jobs and $1.8 billion annually, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to reporters.\n\nEgypt\u2019s president Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi brought the issue to U.N. attention while addressing the General Assembly in New York last month.\n\n\u201cWhile we acknowledge Ethiopia\u2019s right to development, the water of the Nile is a question of life, a matter of existence to Egypt,\u201d el-Sissi said, calling on the international community to \u201cplay a constructive role in urging all parties to show flexibility in the pursuit of a solution that satisfies all.\u201d\n\nWhite House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said Thursday that the U.S. supports Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan\u2019s ongoing negotiations to reach a sustainable and mutually beneficial agreement.\n\n\u201cAll Nile Valley countries have a right to economic development and prosperity,\u201d Grisham said. \u201cThe administration calls on all sides to put forth good faith efforts to reach an agreement that preserves those rights, while simultaneously respecting each other\u2019s Nile water equities.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Cara Anna in Johannesburg contributed to this report.", "description": "Irrigation ministers of three key Nile Basin countries are meeting in Sudan\u2019s capital, seeking to resolve differences over Ethiopia\u2019s soon-to-be-finished Blue Nile dam, which Cairo claims threatens its water supply.
