In a tweet, XR said \u201c1000 rebels are finally demanding serious measures from our government\u201d in the fight against climate change. The action continued into the evening with Potsdamer Platz, which was at some point occupied by some 3,000 protesters, according to the local media.\n\nHundreds of protesters attempted to stage sit-ins at the iconic central square, forcing the police to move in to clear the area. Reports said the officers were acting \u201cwith restraint\u201d as they faced little resistance while \u201ccarrying people away\u201d from the area. No information on the number of arrests has yet been released.\n\nMeanwhile, the Metropolitan Police made 276 arrests in London after XR unleashed mayhem in the city, blocking the Westminster and Lambeth bridges and gathering at Downing Street, Trafalgar Square and the Victoria Embankment.\n\nPrevious demonstrations in London in April saw 1,100 arrested \u2014 and XR say the new protests could be five times bigger as they gather steam over the next couple of weeks.\n\nWomen in red costume process through Westminster during #ExtinctionRebellion London on first day of #GlobalRebellionpic.twitter.com/UtNuwTSfdv \u2014 DCMediaGroup (@DCMediaGroup) October 7, 2019\n\nPublic reaction on social media has been mixed. While some applauded the action as a necessary inconvenience, others complained that the eco-activists were causing more pollution by forcing cars to sit in congested traffic for hours, while others said they were wasting police resources as London battles a surge in knife crime.\n\nI'm on the train to London to join the most important mobilisation of my lifetime: #ExtinctionRebellion\n\nWe face the greatest predicament humankind has ever encountered.\n\nAnd we must meet it with the biggest movement there has ever been. \u2014 GeorgeMonbiot (@GeorgeMonbiot) October 7, 2019\n\nExtinction rebellion is going to kill more people than it saves with all the pollution it\u2019s causing with the traffic jams it\u2019s creating. Engines are running in stationery vehicles everywhere \u2014 Austin Mitchell (@AVMitchell2010) October 7, 2019\n\nProtesters also blocked roads across Australia and New Zealand, with police in Sydney arresting at least 30 people. Climate activists in Wellington staged a \"die-in\" at an ANZ Bank branch, demanding that it \u201cdivest away from fossil fuels,\u201d with some protesters even gluing their hands to the windows. Others occupied the lobby of the Ministry of Business and Innovation.\n\nHundreds marching up Pitt Street for the #ExtinctionRebellion protest in Sydney pic.twitter.com/hsHGhAatNC \u2014 Gus McCubbing (@GusMcCubbing) October 7, 2019\n\nWellington Police diplomacy: officers travelled on bikes to this morning\u2019s Extinction Rebellion protest pic.twitter.com/djvBEtXIkL \u2014 Se\u00e1n Gillespie (@SeanDG) October 6, 2019\n\n16 year old Oriah from Hamilton is chained in a circle of climate protestors on the end of Stout Street in Wellington.

On Saturday, hundreds of activists locked themselves into the Italie Deux shopping center in Paris.\n\nNeedless to say, government officials around the world have not been pleased with XR's methods. In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel's chief of staff told ZDF television that while the government shared an interest in climate protection, such actions were \"dangerous\u201d and \u201cnot acceptable.\u201d\n\nAustralia's employment minister even threatened to suspend welfare payments of activists who were \u201ctoo busy protesting\u201d to look for jobs, while New Zealand PM Jacinda Ardern said that blocking cities and preventing people from getting to work \"doesn't necessarily take us closer to the climate action they're calling for.\"\n\nActivists are likely to remain undeterred, however.\n\n\u201cRebellion is the only solution at this point to not prevent ecocide and ecological collapse but to mitigate what's happening and what's on the horizon,\u201d Rory Varrato, a founding member of XR New York, told RT\u2019s On Contact with Chris Hedges.\n\nVarrato defended the group\u2019s methods, saying activists were committed to non-violence, but wanted to engage in action that was \u201cdisruptive to business-as-usual.\u201d\n\nAlso on rt.com Clown world: Extinction Rebellion is a carnival for middle classes who love to dress up as activists\n\nLike this story?
