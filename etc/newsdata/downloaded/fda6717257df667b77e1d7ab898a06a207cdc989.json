Mark Amodei (R-Nev.) participates in a 2017 town hall in Reno. (Andy Barron/Reno Gazette Journal/Associated Press)\n\nA Republican congressman supports an \u201coversight process\" to determine whether President Trump broke the law when he asked a foreign leader to look into a political opponent\u2019s activities.\n\nJust don\u2019t call it an impeachment inquiry.\n\nRep. Mark Amodei of Nevada used language during a phone call with reporters on Friday night that suggested he supported the Democrats\u2019 investigation into Trump.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s put it through the process and see what happens,\u201d Amodei said, according to the Nevada Independent. \"I\u2019m a big fan of oversight, so let\u2019s let the committees get to work and see where it goes.\u201d\n\n\u201cUsing government agencies to, if it\u2019s proven, to put your finger on the scale of an election, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right,\u201d he added. \u201cIf it turns out that it\u2019s something along those lines, then there\u2019s a problem.\u201d\n\nBut after news outlets began reporting that Amodei was the first House Republican to side with Democrats on opening an impeachment inquiry, Amodei and his staff pushed back \u2014 hard. Sure, they argued, the congressman wanted to find out what occurred between Trump and the Ukrainian president. But that\u2019s not the same as wanting the House to begin impeachment proceedings.\n\nTo some, it\u2019s a distinction without a difference. But for Republicans in Congress, it underscores the delicacy of this moment as they balance their allegiance to Trump with their constitutional duties.\n\nFor Amodei, who is in his fourth full term in Congress \u2014 he won a special election in September 2011 and has easily won reelection since \u2014 that tension revealed itself in real time.\n\nReferencing the Trump situation on Friday, Amodei said to \u201cput it through the process.\u201d He also said that he\u2019s a \u201cbig fan of oversight,\u201d and that \u201cthe committees\u201d should \"get to work and see where it goes.\u201d\n\nTo many, including the reporters on the call, that sounded a lot like an endorsement of the Democrats\u2019 investigation. News outlets from Fox News to the New York Times ran headlines saying he\u2019d come out in support of an impeachment inquiry.\n\nHis Wikipedia page now includes the line: \u201cOn 27 September 2019, Amodei became the first Republican member of Congress to back an impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nAmodei\u2019s office went into damage control, quickly issuing a statement denying that the congressman was advocating for an impeachment inquiry. He was, he said, referring to his vote to give the whistleblower complaint against Trump to the intelligence committees to vet. That action was supported unanimously in the House and Senate.\n\n\u201cI now have a full appreciation of how the president feels,\" Amodei said in an apparent dig at the news media.\n\nAmodei\u2019s office also pointed to the congressman\u2019s support twice in the past week for a resolution offered by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) expressing disapproval of how House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) began an impeachment inquiry without a formal vote in the House. Those resolutions were backed by every Republican and voted down by every Democrat.\n\nWhen asked to clarify the congressman\u2019s position further, Amodei spokesman Logan Tucker said that the difference between backing an oversight process and supporting \u201cPelosi\u2019s inquiry\u201d is that \u201cthen you stand with the 223 Democrats who have made clear that if we were to vote right this second today to impeach Trump, they would vote yes before any sort of process has transpired. Again, prior to any such process playing out, the congressman does not support impeachment in any way, shape or form.\u201d\n\nBut 223 Democrats don\u2019t support impeaching Trump without a process. In fact, of the 224 House Democrats who support an inquiry, just 28 say they would impeach the president right now.\n\nWhen that was pointed out, Tucker reiterated Amodei\u2019s support for the resolution releasing the whistleblower complaint and said, \u201cSupporting a process to get to the bottom of what happened in this instance is, yes, something Mark supports right now. I obviously can\u2019t speak for any other Democrats on this issue, only what Mark supports \u2026 which is an oversight process.\u201d\n\nJust don\u2019t call it an impeachment inquiry.", "description": "A GOP congressman had to parse and walk back comments that sounded a lot like he was supporting an impeachment inquiry.", "authors": ["Congress", "Campaigns", "Health Policy", "Pennsylvania Politics", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Y4bv0-4IQFjcQxFFchwa6lo7naY=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5OWIPCXBKYI6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
