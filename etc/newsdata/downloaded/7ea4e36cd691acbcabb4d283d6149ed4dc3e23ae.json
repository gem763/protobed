(Oct. 4) AP, AP\n\nThe White House saw its first subpoena, Vice President Mike Pence got drawn into the fray, and Congress heard its first testimony related to the Ukraine whistleblower controversy that has President Donald Trump facing an impeachment inquiry.\n\nIt all stems from the July 25 phone call in which Trump asked Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky to look into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son. The whistleblower alleges Trump pressured Zelensky and raised concerns about U.S. monetary aid that was delayed to Ukraine.\n\nWe've rounded up the most important developments from this week on impeachment:\n\nWhite House subpoenaed\n\nHouse Democrats issued a subpoena to the White House on Friday evening for documents relating to the president's contact with Ukraine.\n\nThe House Oversight, Foreign Affairs and Intelligence committees notified the White House in a letter to Trump's acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney.\n\nThe letter to Mulvaney includes a warning should the White House not comply with the request: \"Your failure or refusal to comply with the subpoena, including at the direction or behest of the President or others at the White House, shall constitute evidence of obstruction of the House's impeachment inquiry and may be used as an adverse inference against you and the President.\"\n\nRead more:\n\nOfficials began appearing before Congress\n\nHouse Democrats heard from two officials who are key players in the whistleblower controversy. Kurt Volker, who resigned his post last week as the special envoy to Ukraine, was the first State Department worker to be deposed. Volker's private meeting with Congress on Thursday lasted more than nine hours.\n\nThe inspector general of the intelligence community, Michael Atkinson, testified on Friday in another closed-door session. Atkinson received the whistleblower complaint and deemed it urgent and credible after reviewing it for two weeks.\n\nRead more:\n\nDemocrats released text messages of U.S. diplomats\n\nAfter Volker's deposition, House lawmakers released text messages between Volker and U.S. diplomats that show some of them believed Trump would release military aid and agree to a White House meeting with Zelensky in exchange for an investigation into Biden.\n\n\"Assuming President Z [Zelensky] convinces trump he will investigate/'get to the bottom of what happened' in 2016, we will nail down a date for visit to Washington. Good luck!,\" Volker told his Ukrainian counterpart in one text message.\n\nRead more:\n\nTrump asked China to investigate, too\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Thursday, Trump added China into the mix when he said that the trade rival should also look into the Bidens, prompting strong reactions from Democrats. These comments come days before American and Chinese officials are set to negotiate on a proposed bilateral trade agreement.\n\nNews reports revealed a Trump phone call with China's leader was put on a highly classified server.\n\nA piece of advice: You have the right to remain silent. https://t.co/wF6F8O2Iwe \u2014 Rashida Tlaib (@RashidaTlaib) October 4, 2019\n\nRead more:\n\n#TrumpMeltdown trends after bizarre press conference\n\nAt a press appearance alongside the president of Finland on Wednesday, Trump targeted his anger over the Ukraine controversy at Democrats and the news media. He yelled at a reporter who pressed him on his intentions with Zelensky. He attacked the credibility of the whistleblower and called the anonymous individual \"a spy.\"\n\nThe hashtag #TrumpMeltdown began trending on Twitter after the press conference.\n\nRead more:\n\nPublic attitude shifts toward impeachment\n\nBefore details in the summary of Trump's phone call and the declassified whistleblower complaint were revealed, surveys suggested that the majority of Americans opposed impeaching the president. But now, more poll results reveal a shifting attitude with more Americans favoring impeachment than not.\n\nA USA TODAY/Ipsos Poll showed Americans by a 45%-38% plurality now support a vote by the House of Representatives to impeach Trump, with a clear division across party lines.\n\nRead more:\n\nNext week on the Hill\n\nWhat's next in the impeachment inquiry? The House committees leading the impeachment inquiry, despite Congress being on a two-week recess, plan to depose several more officials with knowledge of Ukraine. They include State Department officials and associates of Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani.\n\nHowever, pushback from the administration on the deposition requests has left some of the scheduled meetings in question. One confirmed appearance is set for Oct. 11 with former Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch.\n\nOther reading on impeachment:\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/05/trump-biden-ukraine-impeachment-probe-what-you-missed/3864905002/", "description": "This week in the impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump, two officials testified before Congress, revealing diplomat text messages and more.", "authors": ["Jeanine Santucci", "Savannah Behrmann", "Published A.M.
