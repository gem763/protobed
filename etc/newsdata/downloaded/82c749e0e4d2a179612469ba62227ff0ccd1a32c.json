The impeachment inquiry against him will force American business leaders to pick sides. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nColumnist\n\nUntil recently, the business community\u2019s carefully calibrated waffle on the Trump presidency has been, \u201cWe\u2019ll support him when we agree and oppose him when we don\u2019t.\u201d So, yes on taxes and deregulation, no on trade, immigration, climate and the deficit.\n\nBut with the House of Representatives hurtling toward impeachment, this studied neutrality will no longer be a viable option. The business lobby will be forced to take sides, and neither choice is attractive.\n\nAs things play out, one possible outcome \u2014 the Republican fantasy \u2014 is that President Trump will be impeached but not convicted. The bitter partisan process backfires on Democrats, allowing Trump to win reelection and keep the Senate under Republican control. It\u2019s not hard to imagine what happens after that.\n\n[What\u2019s next in the Trump impeachment inquiry, and will Trump cooperate with it?]\n\nEmboldened by his acquittal and reelection, Trump would claim a mandate to do whatever he wants, without regard for Congress, public opinion or the law. We\u2019ve already seen these autocratic instincts: abrogating treaties, using national security as pretext for raising tariffs, spending money for a border wall without appropriation, selling advanced weapons to Saudi Arabia without congressional approval, selling off public lands and overturning regulations without providing a scientific basis. All that will seem like a warm-up act, however, if Trump is unleashed into a second term.\n\nIf you think that, in response, young people and liberal activists and Democratic politicians are simply going to go home, lick their wounds and wait until the next election \u2014 well, think again. Strikes, lawsuits, street demonstrations and other forms of civil disobedience are the more likely response. Trump\u2019s warning the other day that the impeachment process might lead to a second \u201ccivil war\u201d was menacing and irresponsible, but he wasn\u2019t wrong in anticipating a period of civil unrest that would undermine consumer, investor and business confidence.\n\nAt that point, it will no longer be possible for business leaders to get away with, \u201cWe\u2019re with him when we agree, and not when we don\u2019t.\u201d For autocrats and dictators, you are either friend or foe, ally or enemy, a patriot or a traitor. Just ask Federal Reserve Chair Jerome \u201cBonehead\u201d Powell, who dared to ignore Trump\u2019s demands for zero percent interest rates, or the executives of Honda, Ford, Volkswagen and BMW, who face an antitrust investigation for having the audacity to embrace Obama-like fuel efficiency standards. For business leaders, the unpleasant choice will be to incur the wrath of the bully president for not saluting or to salute and risk losing key employees, customers and investors.\n\nOkay, so maybe that\u2019s not what happens. Maybe impeachment by the House weakens an already unpopular president, allowing Democrats to win the White House, and with it control of both houses of Congress in 2020. That\u2019s the Democratic fantasy, and it would present business leaders with a different but equally challenging dilemma as the new president and Congress go about eliminating all vestiges of the Trump presidency, including the business-friendly tax cuts and industry-inspired deregulation.\n\nTo get it done, Democrats won\u2019t hesitate to eliminate what is left of the Senate filibuster. And that\u2019s before they take up proposals to eliminate private health insurance, impose a wealth tax and a financial transaction tax, break up the big tech companies, embark on a Green New Deal or, heaven help us, pack the Supreme Court.\n\n[Top CEOs are reclaiming legitimacy by advancing a vision of what is good for America]\n\nIf you think I exaggerate, I have only two words for you: Merrick Garland.\n\nThe decision by Republicans to steal a Supreme Court seat from a respected middle-of-the-road nominee is still a gaping open wound for lawmakers on Capitol Hill and for Democratic voters. They see it as part and parcel with Sen. Mitch McConnell\u2019s pledge in 2010 for Republican senators to do whatever was necessary to guarantee that Barack Obama would be a failed one-term president.\n\nAdd that to three years of Trump\u2019s lies and insults, and you begin to understand the Democrats\u2019 appetite for revenge and retribution.\n\nDemocrats will also remember one other thing: that for most of the past 25 years, the business lobby abandoned any pretense of bipartisanship and turned itself into an arm of the Republican Party, which included financing efforts to defeat moderate pro-business Democrats. Having just run the table in the 2020 election, the chance that they will listen to reasoned arguments from business leaders is somewhere between little and none.\n\nI take no pleasure in sketching out these scenarios. No matter whose fantasy prevails, what unfolds will be a political version of the Hatfields and the McCoys. It will be very bad for the country, bad for the economy and particularly bad for American business, which will find itself trapped in a political no man\u2019s land between an angry, intransigent and anti-business Democratic Party on the left and an angry, anti-establishment Republican Party on the right.\n\nGiven that, the best strategy for the business community is to shift gears and use its money and influence to begin rebuilding a bipartisan center in both parties.\n\nFor starters, that would mean providing loud and lavish support to Republicans who dare to break with Trump and party leaders in Congress, not only on impeachment but in support of reasonable initiatives on immigration, gun control, infrastructure, climate, health care, universal pre-K and the minimum wage, all of which are on the business legislative agenda.\n\n[Live updates: Trump impeachment]\n\nAt the same time, this strategy would include providing equally loud and lavish support to moderate Democrats willing to break with their leaders and Democratic interest groups and support reasonable compromise on those issues.\n\nIt would take only a handful of well-publicized wins and defections to change the political calculus, widely embraced in both parties, that the only way to get reelected is by sticking to the party\u2019s talking points and voting the party line.\n\nSome might consider it naive to think that business would consider picking a fight with a president with a well-deserved reputation as a vengeful bully.\n\nIn my mind, however, what is even more naive is believing that our political system will somehow pull itself out of its current tailspin, one in which hyperpolarization and government dysfunction are feeding on each other, threatening our democracy and our economy.\n\nIn thinking about how to deal with a political system spinning out of control, business leaders should recall the wisdom of the ancient Jewish scholar and ask themselves, \u201cIf not us, who? If not now, when?\u201d", "description": "The impeachment investigation is going to force business to take sides \u2014 and there are no easy options.", "authors": ["Steven Pearlstein", "October At Am", "A Washington Post Economics Columnist", "The Robinson Professor Of Public Affairs At George Mason University", "Is The Author Of"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/E5_Uo4dkS8-Xcyznu9ZuOoaE3uI=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KHUVB3XAQ4I6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
