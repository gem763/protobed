Yes, we go wrong at times and destroy things, wipe out entire nations\u2026 but let\u2019s not get into that right now.\n\nThe curtains on blockchain technology were raised back in 2008 in response to the global financial crisis caused by the central banks and government of the United States. It\u2019s a fact \u2014 absolute power corrupts absolutely. Now, more than a decade later, the scene looks like a race to be the best blockchain protocol \u2014 and rest assured, the contenders are many.\n\nWith that said, who deserves the \u201cdigital throne\u201d? Or will it be hard-forked? What\u2019s digital, doesn't burn\u2026 Not even with dragon fire.\n\nLet\u2019s find out by comparing some of the major blockchain protocols. I\u2019ll review transaction time, scalability and purpose, which are the top three that lead to capturing the digital throne.\n\nBitcoin \u2014 the Bran of Cryptocurrency\n\nRemember the One-Eyed Raven? He was old, resilient and seemed immortal. Likewise, so is Bitcoin (BTC). Spoiler alert \u2014 there\u2019s a twist here, just wait for it.\n\nNo matter who gets the crown, there\u2019s one thing we can\u2019t take away from the Bitcoin protocol. If not for its anonymous founder, I wouldn\u2019t be writing this piece. So, all else aside, Bitcoin is \u2014 and will be \u2014 the \u201coriginal blockchain.\u201d\n\nNow, how does Bitcoin fare otherwise? The Bitcoin protocol was conceived as open-source, peer-to-peer money, and that\u2019s basically it. As a cryptocurrency, Bitcoin is still the most popular. However, the platform doesn\u2019t fare well in terms of transactions per second (TPS), which is only seven. Moreover, owing to the resource-intensive mining process that could power entire countries, Bitcoin\u2019s block time is pretty high, at 10 minutes.\n\nSo, like ultra-wise and eternal \u2014 yet crippled \u2014 Bran, our old friend Bitcoin has major scalability issues, preventing it from becoming a mainstream monetary system like Visa, for instance. At present, Bitcoin\u2019s dream seems as far-fetched as Bran\u2019s childhood one of becoming a knight. All in all, as monetary systems have progressed through time, so too will crypto, leaving many to believe that Bitcoin will be the new gold.\n\nRelated: Is Bitcoin a Store of Value? Experts on BTC as Digital Gold\n\nEthereum \u2014 Arya, the No One\n\nCourtesy of the genius Vitalik Butarin, Ethereum burst into the scene around 2013. With this, we began to truly realize the potential of Blockchain technology. The Ethereum protocol enables the creation of decentralized applications, or DApps, using smart contracts. It can be used for a range of purposes, including decentralized finance applications such as MarkerDAO and asset tokenization in the case of Polymath.\n\nWhen I think of Ethereum, I can\u2019t help but liken it to little Arya Stark, who seemed ordinary but was actually brimming with potential. She was faceless, and could morph into anyone. The interoperability of Ethereum is much the same.\n\nEthereum can process around 15 TPS on average. However, despite the faster block time, the scalability issues remain, leading to long queues of pending transactions.\n\nSince its launch, Ethereum actually went up to 20,000 to 25,000 pending transactions in the famous story of Crypto Kitties almost shutting down the entire Ethereum network. \u201cNo risk no reward,\u201d as they say. Currently, the Ethereum team is working on sharding and proof-of-stake implementation to take this protocol into the future. And what do we say to the God of Death? Not today.\n\nRipple \u2014 Daenerys, Breaker of Chains\n\nRipple has been around since 2012 and is a digital payment network. It\u2019s a closed system used to transact any form of fiat, including the United States dollar, the yen, and others. The platform utilizes the cryptocurrency known as XRP.\n\nLike the very popular and exotically beautiful Daenerys, who broke chains and saved thousands of slaves, Ripple doesn\u2019t have a blockchain and has liberated distributed finance from the shackles of blockchain technology \u2014 but not to the fullest scope. It\u2019s more of a distributed finance system, and some even say it\u2019s not decentralized enough. I think those naysayers are as right as the show creators were, who said the last Game of Thrones season was the \u201cbest\u201d one.\n\nThe patented Ripple Protocol Consensus Algorithm replaces mining by implementing a unique distributed consensus mechanism, wherein the nodes participate in a poll to determine the validity of a transaction.\n\nAs Daenerys liked to drop the cloth and highlight her key visual features, mesmerizing her foes into defeat, so does the Ripple protocol. Ripple has been able to flaunt its speed and costs on a regular basis to woo banks into submission. It\u2019s much faster than the previous two protocols, and can handle up to 1,500 TPS, with a transaction time of around three to five seconds.\n\nPresently, RippleNet is one of the most scalable digital assets, surpassing 200 global customers in January 2019.\n\nStellar \u2014 John Snow of Blockchain, ice meets fire\n\nThe Stellar protocol is an open-source digital payment network that mainly targets developing markets and can be used for transfers, money remittance and bank loan distribution to those without bank accounts.\n\nI think Stellar is doing what Ripple has failed to do. Although I\u2019ve likened the platform to John Snow (the hero for the many), I don\u2019t think it would prove to be as worthless in the end as he was. Anyway, just like John being something brand new created from fire and ice, Stellar is a combination of the best of the two \u2014 blockchain and Ripple.\n\nStellar uses the Stellar Consensus Protocol, which uses quorum slices and the Federated Byzantine Agreement algorithm. As a result, transactions on the Stellar blockchain are even faster. However, there is some confusion as to its TPS metric.\n\nApparently, Stellar handles 10 TPS. But what constitutes a transaction here isn\u2019t the same as for the others. Each transaction can contain hundreds of \u201coperations,\u201d and it\u2019s the operations that matter in this case. That said, the protocol handles up to 1,000 operations per second on average, though the maximum potential is much greater.\n\nOver time, prominent firms such as IBM (in 2017) and Deloitte (in 2016) have partnered with the Stellar team and are using its protocol.\n\nCorda \u2014 summon the bannermen\n\nUnlike all others discussed so far, Corda is an enterprise blockchain conceived by R3 primarily for the finance industry, and has now diversified into other industries such as health care. However, given the structural underpinnings, I\u2019d rather call Corda a distributed ledger technology rather than an actual blockchain.\n\nLike the bannermen who follow their leader\u2019s orders methodically into the depths of battle, Corda\u2019s consortium network consists of about 300 companies working together to develop apps on Corda for their specific industries. Among them, we have BMO Financial Group, Danske Bank, Intesa Sanpaolo and Natixis.\n\nThe consensus mechanism for Corda is a bit complicated. Its purpose is to maintain a shared ledger for its members, so they uphold a common layer of standards, supported by open, transparent governance over transactions. The members don\u2019t necessarily need to know about each and every transaction on the network, as it only concerns the parties directly involved.\n\nAlthough the platform can handle 1,678 TPS for a single node being updated on a local system, the overall TPS metric involving two parties is 600.\n\nThe verdict\n\nSo, who wins? It isn\u2019t as obvious as you think. I\u2019d like to rewrite the story for who wins the digital throne.\n\nNow, I\u2019d declare Stellar as the runner-up in this game, the first commander\u2026 maybe. After all, it\u2019s the closest so far when it comes to working as a mainstream financial system. It still has time to prove if it will turn out like John Snow \u2014 overhyped at the end of it all. It takes a lot more than birth rights, good looks and how many bodies you leave behind in your path.\n\nAs for the crown, I give it to Ethereum. The nobody who could be anybody it wants, like Arya. There\u2019s no other platform as diverse. It\u2019s a currency and most importantly, a highly flexible, robust, optimally decentralized and modular platform. Yes, it lacks scalability, but that\u2019s solvable. Just because Buterin looks perpetually tired from living on planes flying from conference to conference as a speaker, doesn\u2019t mean he isn\u2019t doing anything to solve problems. In fact, that\u2019s what he is always doing, and work is well on the way in this regard.\n\nThe fact remains, however, that the game is far from over. But, as life imitates art or vice versa, Cersei says, \u201cWhen you play the game of thrones, you win or you die.\u201d Contenders such as Tron and EOS are making significant inroads in the market, challenging the supremacy of Ethereum when it comes to DApps.\n\nWith that, I conclude this piece and wait to see how the old and new protocols face the test of time. As we push further into mass adoption and capturing the digital throne, the possibilities are endless in this game of nodes.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author\u2019s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.", "description": "With over a decade of blockchain, the scene has become a fierce battle of protocols in this game of nodes.
