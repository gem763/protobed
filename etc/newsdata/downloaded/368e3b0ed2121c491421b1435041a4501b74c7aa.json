It\u2019s been awesome to see so many people change their lives!\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nEarly on, however, I noticed a pattern with the people I was counseling and the callers on my radio show. The thought of getting out of debt was overwhelming to them. The pile of debt in front of them seemed too big, and they didn\u2019t know how to start.\n\nThat\u2019s why I created the Baby Steps. These seven money markers are designed to get you out of debt and show you how to build the kind of wealth you always dreamed of. But taking control of your money doesn\u2019t happen overnight. The Baby Steps are based on the idea that you can accomplish anything if you take it one step at a time.\n\nBaby Step 1: Save $1,000 in a Beginner Emergency Fund\n\nLife happens. Transmissions blow and dryers burn out. An emergency fund takes care of these not-so-happy surprises. Don\u2019t be one of the 60 percent of Americans who can\u2019t cover unexpected expenses. Having $1,000 set aside just for emergencies puts a little buffer between you and the \u201cCheck Engine\u201d light on your dashboard.\n\nStep 2: Pay Off All Debt with the Debt Snowball\n\nList all your debts except your house from smallest to largest by balance. Make minimum payments on all of them except the smallest one, and attack that one with a vengeance! Put every dollar you can get your hands on toward that smallest debt and get it out of your life for good!\n\nOnce the first one is out of the way, take that money and add it to the next debt on the list. Keep going all the way down the list, one debt at a time. Every time you pay off one debt, you have more money to throw at the next one.\n\nThat\u2019s what we call it the Debt Snowball: As the snowball rolls over, it picks up more snow. By the time you get near the bottom of your debt list, it starts to look like an avalanche! You\u2019ll be debt-free faster than you ever thought possible!\n\nStep 3: Build a Fully Funded Emergency Fund of 3\u20136 Months Expenses\n\nOnce you\u2019re out of debt except for your house, go back to that little emergency fund and beef it up to a full 3\u20136 months of expenses. At that point, you have no debts other than the mortgage, and you have $10,000\u201315,000 in the bank just for emergencies. Life starts to feel a little different here, doesn\u2019t it?\n\nStep 4: Invest 15 Percent of Household Income Into Retirement\n\nWith no debt and a big emergency fund, you\u2019ve finally freed up your greatest wealth-building tool: your income. So now it\u2019s time to focus on your retirement dream. Once you hit Baby Step 4, I want you to start investing 15 percent of your income into your 401(k) and Roth IRA.\n\nStep 5: College Funding for Children\n\nAfter you\u2019ve gotten your retirement fund going strong, it\u2019s time to think about college for the kiddos. I recommend the Education Savings Account (ESA). Most families can save up to $2,000 a year in an ESA. If you want to do more, you can also check out a 529, but only choose a 529 that leaves you in control of your investments.\n\nStep 6: Pay Off Your House\n\nNow it\u2019s time to reach for the golden ring. Keep going! Don\u2019t stop now! How cool would it be if you actually owned your home instead of the bank? Then do it! Put every extra dollar in the budget toward paying off the mortgage early.\n\nStep 7: Build Wealth and Give\n\nBaby Step 7 is my absolute favorite because it\u2019s the most fun. With zero debt and a big emergency fund, you can now build wealth, give like crazy to good causes, and leave an incredible legacy for your family. This is the goal!\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve learned from working with millions of families, it\u2019s this: Your situation isn\u2019t hopeless. With a lot of hard work and determination, anyone can get out of debt and build wealth. Because when you live like no one else, you can truly live and give like no one else.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET MORE FOX BUSINESS", "description": "Here are seven money markers that are designed to get you out of debt and show you how to build the kind of wealth you always dreamed of.", "authors": ["Dave Ramsey"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/Dave-Ramsey-headshot-001.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"}
