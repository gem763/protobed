Council and elsewhere fervor for the Nationals has taken hold as the city prepares to host a World Series game for the first time since 1933. What was a baseball desert until just 15 years ago will host the sport\u2019s marquee event this weekend when the Nationals and Houston Astros continue their series in Washington.\n\nGames 3, 4 and 5 are slated for Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights at Nationals Park. The first pitch is scheduled for just after 8 p.m. With the Nationals leading Houston two games to none, there might not be a need for Game 5 in the best-of-seven series. World Series sweeps are rare \u2014 the last one was in 2012 \u2014 but Washington is halfway there.\n\nThe weather forecast calls for some rain Saturday evening and Sunday, but the extent to which that could delay the games is unknown. That is the only potential complication threatening to dampen a weekend of baseball festivities. The Metro will be open late after games for fans\u2019 commute, the crack of the bat again will echo over the Anacostia River and tens of thousands of people will converge on Nationals Park to witness local history.\n\n\u2018Common language\u2019\n\nThe Nationals team is primed to be one of the most lasting pieces of Anthony A. Williams\u2019 legacy as the District\u2019s mayor from 1999 to 2007. Having led the city\u2019s efforts to bring the Montreal Expos to town, and after overcoming council opposition to build Nationals Park, Mr. Williams became known as one of Washington\u2019s biggest baseball fans.\n\nMr. Williams said he plans to attend each World Series game at Nationals Park this weekend.\n\n\u201cYou walk down the street, and everybody is saying, \u2018Go Nats,\u2019\u201d Mr. Williams told The Washington Times. \u201cA lot of these folks, I\u2019m sure, weren\u2019t baseball fans two or three years ago, but they\u2019re baseball fans now. That\u2019s good for the city. It\u2019s good for baseball. It\u2019s good for overall civic life.\u201d\n\nHosting a World Series would have seemed like a dream for the District in 2005, when the Nationals began play at RFK Stadium before the ballpark was built. Mr. Williams said a Series wasn\u2019t initially on his mind.\n\nBut as he watched the Nationals invest in becoming a top-flight ballclub \u2014 one that soon competed for division titles year in and year out with players like Ryan Zimmerman and managers like Matt Williams and Dusty Baker \u2014 the mayor felt it was only a matter of time before the Nationals would make a World Series.\n\nMr. Williams\u2019 successors on the D.C. Council have baseball on the brain, too. At a legislative meeting Tuesday, council member Mary M. Cheh, Ward 3 Democrat, twice asked the council to sing \u201cBaby Shark\u201d to wish the Nationals good luck for Game 1. Chairman Phil Mendelson denied the request, but someone played the children\u2019s song over the hearing room\u2019s loudspeaker after the meeting.\n\nCouncil member Elissa Silverman, at-large independent, said she has fond memories of attending baseball games with her father and brother. She said they plan to attend Game 4 of the World Series together on Saturday.\n\n\u201cThe reason I like sports is it\u2019s a common language you can speak,\u201d Ms. Silverman said. \u201cIt\u2019s something I do think ties people together from different backgrounds, different ages, different incomes. It\u2019s something we can all get behind and talk about.\u201d\n\nTime to party\n\nD.C. sports fans are using words such as \u201cinconceivable\u201d and \u201celectric\u201d to describe what the Nationals are doing. But they also compare it to a recent benchmark of Washington sports fandom: the Capitals\u2019 Stanley Cup victory in 2018, the city\u2019s first major NHL championship in 26 years.\n\n\u201cI would kind of equate it to the same joy that the city felt when the Caps did their Stanley Cup run,\u201d said Laura Habberstad, a manager at Dacha Navy Yard, which sits between Nationals Park and the Anacostia. \u201cFor so many times, we were so close, but it was just outside of our grasp. So then to finally have whatever come together, just the right pieces fit so that we can just have this really great run where it\u2019s just so exciting. You feel fans are coming out, the city\u2019s coming together. \u2026 It\u2019s just a unifying moment where we all get to be so proud.\u201d\n\nChristian Hunt, a bartender and manager at Blackfinn Ameripub DC and trivia host at Atlas Brew Works in the Ivy City neighborhood, is a lifelong Washingtonian and die-hard D.C. sports fan. He celebrated the local narrative of Ryan Zimmerman, a native Virginian and University of Virginia product who has played for the Nationals since they came to Washington.\n\n\u201cTo watch [Zimmerman] finally break through, not only win past the wild card game but win two playoff series and get all the way to the big show, is something special,\u201d Mr. Hunt said.\n\nMr. Hunt rattled off the important Nationals games that he made sure to attend: the first and last games they played at RFK, the first game at Nationals Park, their first home playoff game, even the MLB All-Star Game and Home Run Derby last year.\n\nDid he have those coveted World Series tickets yet? \u201cNot quite,\u201d Mr. Hunt laughed. \u201cI\u2019m watching [the market] very closely.\u201d\n\nLast-minute tickets will be harder than ever to come by: At one point Thursday afternoon, the cheapest ticket for Game 3 available on StubHub was $1,100.\n\nThe inside of Nationals Park won\u2019t be the only place for fans to cheer and celebrate. Watch parties have popped up around the Navy Yard neighborhood, including Yards Park.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re blocking off the streets,\u201d Ms. Habberstad said, \u201cso it means it\u2019s going to be really a big kind of a street party that\u2019s going to happen over the next week.\u201d\n\n\u2981 Sophie Kaplan contributed to this report.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
