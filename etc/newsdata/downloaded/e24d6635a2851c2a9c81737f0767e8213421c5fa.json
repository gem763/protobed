Keep Going.\u2019\n\nMike also posted a series of post-trek videos to his Instagram story, including a photo of him staring across the ocean, as well as a well-deserved massage on the beach.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Cooler Than Me singer was trekking from the east to west coast in honour of Mac Miller, Avicii and his own late father.\n\nLast week, he posted a video explaining exactly how he wanted the last day to go down.\n\nWhile trekking through the Californian desert, he revealed he wanted to do the last day alone.\n\n(Picture: Mike Posner / Instagram)\n\nHe explained: \u2018You guys have been asking about the last day. I\u2019m doing the last day alone so I\u2019m not going to tell you what time on Sunday I\u2019m getting to Redondo Beach, I\u2019m not gonna tell you my route.\n\nTaking his last day very seriously, he revealed the moment is going to be \u2018one of the most sacred\u2019 of his life.\n\nHe said: \u2018Don\u2019t try to walk with me, I\u2019m going to be in the zone. I\u2019m not gonna be talking, I\u2019m taking a vow of silence.\u2019\n\nIt took him six months to complete the journey and it certainly had its highs and lows.\n\nThe biggest low came about when he was bitten by a baby rattlesnake and had to be airlifted to hospital to get the antidote.\n\nHe explained: \u2018I had just crushed 16 miles and was going for 8 more when I got bit by a baby rattlesnake!\n\n\u2018That venom is no joke! I got to the hospital and got the anti-venom in time. Shout outs to G and Mike from the chopper team and Bo and Cassie and Whitney (my nurses),\u2019 he added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou\u2019re a real inspiration, Mike!\n\nGot a showbiz story?
