It was initially scheduled to take place in March, but was scrapped then due to availability issues of spacesuits.\n\n\n\nThis news came as part of the agency\u2019s briefing which offered a preview of 10 upcoming spacewalks on the International Space Station. Astronauts Christina Koch and Jessica Meir will be taking the mission.\n\n\n\nKoch is scheduled to conduct several other walks in October apart from the all-female one. She is already on the International Space Station since March 14, and is slated to stay there until February 2020. This makes her time on the station the longest single spaceflight by a woman.\n\nLIVE NOW: Experts provide updates about a series of complex spacewalks by @NASA_Astronauts during the next three months, a cadence that has not been experienced since assembly of the @Space_Station was completed in 2011.
