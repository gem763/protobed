That\u2019s the terrifying high-concept premise behind her latest single, \u201cImperfections,\u201d and it\u2019s an unsettling speculation that we don\u2019t even want to consider. Lucky for us, we don\u2019t have to. Because in the bop\u2019s music video, queen Celine does a frankly abysmal job convincing us that she\u2019s anything but perfect, singing in a perfect voice about her inadequacies while stunting in couture perfectly. The drama of her body language in billowing sleeves? Heaven. Her stripes and oversize polka dots and large hat wide-stanced Cirque du Soleil fashion narrative? Art. Her running, Bird Box blindfolded, toward the camera in black-and-white like a high-glamour human embodiment of that old-timey movie of the train driving toward the audience? The Lumi\u00e8re brothers wish! We know she\u2019s perfect. She knows she\u2019s perfect. You have your own imperfections? Celine, where?\n\nThe cognitive dissonance demanded by Celine here is the equivalent of Sutton Foster singing \u201cI don\u2019t wanna show off\u201d at the Tony Awards while putting her 10,000 talents on display, or Corbin Bleu insisting \u201cI Don\u2019t Dance\u201d in High School Musical 2 while doing a quite good baseball dance. After all, this is the benevolent legend who stopped an entire Las Vegas show to let a fan pee without missing a moment. This is the wise goddess who shuts down disastrous tattoo concepts. No amount of emerging out of an inky pool of Under the Skin abyss-water or giving us your best impression of Millie Bobby Brown\u2019s nighttime skin-care routine will convince us otherwise, Celine! That goes for you too, fantastically Quebecois music video director, Guillaume Coutu Dumont. The jig is up!", "description": "Watch the new music video for Celine Dion\u2019s latest single, \u2018Imperfections,\u2019 in which the legendary singer sings about being imperfect, a blatant lie immediately disproven by the high-fashion black and white video itself, in which she poses in couture", "authors": ["Rebecca Alter"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/26/26-celine-dion.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
