The \u201cepic moments\u201d of Japan\u2019s famous win four years ago were replayed on the stadium screen during the break but it seemed only to remind the South Africans of what was at stake in the second half.\n\nFlyhalf Handre Pollard landed three penalty goals from the 44th to the 64th minutes to extend the margin to 14-3 before the South Africans finally opened up.\n\nScrumhalf Faf de Klerk scooted over in the 66th after a powerful driving maul from the Springboks had Japan on the back foot, and Makazole Mapimpi added his second try of the match by finishing off a long-range movement in the 70th to put the result beyond doubt.\n\nCaptain Michael Leitch and his Japanese squad won millions of converts to the sport for their high-intensity brand of running rugby, but were unable to cross South Africa\u2019s line in what was their first ever trip to the knockout stages of the tournament.\n\nThe two-time champion Springboks are old pros at this end of the tournament, improving to 5-2 in Rugby World Cup semifinals and setting up a meeting against Wales next Sunday for a place in the final. England plays New Zealand in the other semifinal next Saturday.\n\nThe South Africans had to defend for most of the first half, were a man down for 14 minutes and only had 30% of the field position, but held their composure despite a mounting tally of handling errors.\n\nMapimpi gave South Africa a 5-0 lead in the 4th, easily beating an attempted tackle from Yu Tamuru on the short side after a big shove from the Springbok scrum and outpacing the cover defense to the left corner.\n\nBut Japan absorbed the early pressure from a much bigger Springboks pack and started to take control when veteran South Africa prop Tendi Mtawarira was yellow-carded in the 10th minute for a tip-tackle.\n\nHe immediately put his hands up to acknowledge the mistake, but left his team with 14 men for the next 10 minutes and Japan attacked relentlessly - even taking a scrum against the head.\n\nThat led to Japan\u2019s points, from a calmly taken penalty goal by Tamura in the 20th minute.\n\nJapan had done most of the running in the first half and went close after a Kenki Fukuoka surge on the left wing, but wasn\u2019t able to turn almost 70% of possession and territory into a try.\n\nThat hurt after the break. Eventually the battering took a toll on the Japan side and possession and territory stats ended about even.\n\nThe Japan team did a lap of Tokyo Stadium, where die-hard fans stayed long after fulltime to celebrate their team.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "There was no great shock this time, regardless of how much Japan threw at the Springboks.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "John Pye"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
