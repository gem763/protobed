She also earned $3.85 million US for the victory and improved to 8-0 against top 10 opponents \u2014 all this year.\n\nShe the North indeed\n\nAndreescu put her hands over her mouth in awe after the match when the on-court interviewer mentioned that she was the first Canadian to win a major.\n\n\"It's so hard to explain in words but I'm beyond grateful,\" Andreescu told him. \"I worked really hard for this moment.\n\n\"This year has been a dream come true and being able to play on this stage against Serena, a true legend in this sport, is amazing.\"\n\nAndreescu's father, teary-eyed in the crowd, was shown filming the post-match interview and trophy presentation on his cell phone.\n\nWhile there was a loud applause from the crowd when Andreescu was introduced before the match, the ovation for Williams was deafening.\n\nAndreescu said she had to fight off the crowd noise at times, especially when she saw her 5-1 lead evaporate in the second set.\n\n\"I know you guys wanted Serena to win so I'm so sorry,\" she said on the court.\n\nIt wasn't a pretty match for Williams, who struggled on her serve throughout, with her first-serve percentage dipping to 25 at one point in the second set.\n\nBut the 23-time Grand Slam champion showed fight late, staving off one championship point and breaking Andreescu two straight times to tie the set 5-5 and send the crowd of 26,191 at Arthur Ashe Stadium into a frenzy.\n\nWatch Championship Point:\n\nBianca Andreescu defeated Serena Williams 6-3, 7-5 to capture the women's singles U.S. Open title at Arthur Ashe Stadium. 1:09\n\nThe No. 8-seeded Williams won her first U.S. Open title here 20 years ago \u2014 before Andreescu was born.\n\nSaturday's match lasted 1 hour 40 minutes, about 80 minutes longer than their last meeting, at the Rogers Cup final in Toronto last month.\n\nAndreescu won that title when Williams retired with a back injury. The Canadian was leading 3-1.\n\nWatch as Andreescu consoles Williams after Rogers Cup win:\n\nBianca Andreescu and Serena Williams shared an emotional embrace after Williams was forced to retire from the Rogers Cup final due to injury. Andreescu is the first Canadian woman to win the Rogers Cup since Faye Urban in 1969. 2:14\n\nAndreescu, who began the year ranked No. 152, headed into the U.S. Open after a stellar season that included her first two titles.\n\nShe has been one of the best Canadian sports stories of the year, garnering praise from the likes of Wayne Gretzky, Sidney Crosby, Steve Nash, and Kia Nurse. Even Billie Jean King, whose name adorns the tennis centre where the U.S. Open is played, has tweeted about Andreescu multiple times.\n\nAll this for a player who didn't even make it out of the qualifying round at Flushing Meadows in 2018.\n\nA year later, Andreescu rode her aggressive style to a championship, downing Katie Volynets, Kirsten Flipkens, No. 19-seed Caroline Wozniacki, Taylor Townsend, No. 25-seed Elise Merten and the No. 13 Belinda Bencic to become the first teenager to win the U.S. Open since Maria Sharapova in 2006.\n\nShe attacked from the beginning Saturday, breaking Williams twice in the first set \u2014 in the first game and on a double fault to end the set \u2014 while facing just one break point.\n\nAfter Andreescu won, she pumped her fists and congratulated Williams on a well-played match. Then she lay on the court and covering her face as she processed the win. (Danielle Parhizkaran/USA TODAY Sports)\n\nWilliams double-faulted again to give Andreescu another break and a 2-0 lead to start the second set. The American responded by breaking Andreescu for the first time, but then lost her next serve as the Canadian built a 5-1 advantage.\n\nWilliams, whose disappointment was etched on her face during parts of the match, remains one major victory short of tying Margaret Court's 24 titles.\n\nShe is also still looking for her first championship \u2014 major or otherwise \u2014 after returning from the birth of her daughter. Williams had won the 2017 Australian Open while pregnant and returned to the WTA tour at Indian Wells in March of 2018.\n\nWilliams had looked otherworldly throughout the U.S. Open, carving up opponents starting with Sharapova in the first round. She also notched the quickest victory of the tournament, a 44-minute one-sided quarterfinal win over China's Wang Qiang.\n\nAndreescu was the first Canadian woman to play in a Grand Slam final since Eugenie Bouchard competed for the Wimbledon title in 2014.\n\n#SheTheNorth was trending on Twitter during and after the match. Andreescu's achievement was recognized by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, among others.\n\nCongratulations <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Bandreescu_?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Bandreescu_</a>! \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udde6 You\u2019ve made history and made a whole country very proud. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/SheTheNorth?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#SheTheNorth</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/W98v1lUN9o\">https://t.co/W98v1lUN9o</a> \u2014@JustinTrudeau\n\nThe 2019 NBA Champion Toronto Raptors, who use 'We The North' as their team hashtag, also congratulated Andreescu with a tweet that read 'She The Champ' accompanied by a photo of an Andreescu Raptors jersey laying next to the Larry O'Brien trophy.", "description": "Bianca Andreescu has become the first Canadian to win a Grand Slam singles title.
