Business Insider Intelligence\n\nThe summit was hosted by Alphabet's R&D lab X and smart city subsidiary Sidewalk Infrastructure Partners. According to attendees cited by CNBC, Alphabet representatives seemed mostly interested in predictive analytics. However, the summit also covered order fulfillment, package tracking, Bluetooth usage, and drone delivery.\n\nAlphabet is likely looking to expand its logistics offerings to claim a share of the fast-growing e-commerce market. E-commerce sales are expected to generate $5 trillion globally on an annual basis by 2021, up from an estimated $3.5 trillion in 2019, according to eMarketer.\n\nAs the e-commerce market grows, logistics companies and retailers have been strained to fulfill orders in a timely manner, spurring them to turn to technology for assistance. Alphabet is in a unique position to offer major logistics companies and e-commerce retailers multiple new technologies to handle growing volumes of e-commerce packages. Here's how:\n\nDrones: Alphabet's drone delivery subsidiary Wing can help retailers and logistics providers offer innovative last-mile delivery solutions. Wing's drones \u2014 currently in commercial use with FedEx and Walgreens in Christiansburg, Virginia \u2014 deliver two- to three-pound packages to customers' doorsteps, sometimes within minutes. Delivery drones will substantially reduce the cost of the last mile of the delivery process, which accounts for 41% of delivery costs.\n\nSelf-driving trucks: The Silicon Valley titan's self-driving car company Waymo can enable retailers and logistics providers to ship and deliver packages for less. Waymo is currently in the headlines for its robotaxi service, but the company is also innovating a self-driving truck solution. The company's autonomous truck solution has been tested on public roads with modified Peterbilt 18-wheelers, though it's not yet commercially available. In the future, Waymo's self-driving trucks could be used to move packages between facilities without requiring drivers, helping logistics companies save on labor costs.\n\nRouting data: Sidewalk Infrastructure Partners can give retailers and logistics providers access to a host of data to improve last-mile delivery in cities. Data points from smart cities can be used to identify potential delivery barriers, such as heavy traffic or accidents, and enable trucks to reroute to avoid delays. In June, Sidewalk released a proposal for an ambitious smart city district in Toronto.\n\nAlphabet's tools and services could enable major logistics companies and e-commerce retailers to better compete with Amazon's growing logistics footprint. Amazon has invested significantly in delivery infrastructure to challenge legacy logistics providers, particularly in last-mile delivery \u2014 the company plans to operate a drone delivery service and has ordered 100,000 electric delivery vans to build out its delivery service.\n\nAlphabet could leverage its deep background in predictive technologies, like AI and machine learning, as well as its offering of drones and autonomous technology to help logistics companies and retailers compete from a technical standpoint with Amazon as e-commerce order volumes grow.\n\nWant to read more stories like this one?
