Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on Thursday. In case you\u2019ve been living under a rock and somehow missed it, a woman wearing a \u201cSave the Planet, Eat the Children\u201d t-shirt interrupted the proceedings and demanded that people \u201cstart eating babies\u201d in response to climate change.\n\nStating that we only have \u201ca few months left\u201d to save the planet, the woman immediately fast forwarded to the most extreme of \u2018solutions.\u2019\n\n\u201cWe have to start eating babies,\u201d she said. \u201cWe do not have enough time. There\u2019s too much CO2. All of you, you are polluting. Too much CO2. We have to start now ... Even if we bomb Russia, we have too many people, too much pollution. So we have to get rid of the babies. That is the big problem. Just stopping having babies is not enough. We need to eat the babies.\u201d\n\nEven before we knew the woman wasn\u2019t a constituent or likely even an AOC supporter, babies on the menu to save the earth did seem a bit extreme, even by today\u2019s absurd, climate change cult standards. So it was no huge surprise when the whole thing turned out to be a stunt put on by a right wing political cult once led by Lyndon LaRouche. Even so, the real news wasn\u2019t just simply what the woman said, but also how Ocasio-Cortez responded:\n\n\u201cOne of the things that\u2019s very important to us is that we need to treat the climate crisis with the urgency that it does present,\u201d she said calmly, almost meekly. \u201cLuckily, we have more than a few months. We do need to hit net zero in several years, but I think we all need to understand that there are a lot of solutions that we have, that we can pursue. And that if we act in a positive way, there is space for hope. We are never beyond hope.\u201d\n\nThe New York congresswoman wrote later she thought the woman was suffering from some sort of \u201cmental condition,\u201d so she wanted to \u201cde-escalate\u201d the situation. Fine, but for gosh sakes, mental condition or not, a person just stood up in public and asked you to endorse literally murdering babies and, uh, eating them. Wouldn\u2019t a nice, calm, de-escalating go a little like \u2018Uh, no, we definitely aren\u2019t condoning eating children, but thanks for your comments and please see the nice men with the straight jackets to the left\u2019 have been way better?\n\nPut it this way. What if a white male had stood up at Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s town hall and openly called for, say, discriminating against a minority group to save the planet. (No, that doesn\u2019t make sense, but neither does killing babies. Work with me here!) How do you think she would have reacted, even if the man had seemed mentally disturbed. Obviously, any politician, from the most conservative Republican to the most liberal Democrat, would have immediately and rightly refuted that person with a strong, \u2018No, we\u2019re not going to discriminate against anyone!\u2019\n\nSo no, AOC doesn\u2019t get a pass because she thought the eating baby woman was mentally disturbed. Quite the contrary, the \u2018logic\u2019 behind her actual response is disturbing. If you read between the lines, Ocasio-Cortez basically lauded the woman for her sense of urgency, then merely walks it back a few notches by contending that we have \u201cmore than a few months.\u201d (Twelve years, to be specific, but we won\u2019t quibble.) And we have \u201clots of solutions,\u201d so let\u2019s not resort to eating our young just yet.\n\nFrom her reference to Swedish professor Magnus S\u00f6derlund, whose actual plan to fight climate change involves developing a taste for human flesh, to simply condensing AOC\u2019s 12 year timeline to \u201ca few months,\u201d the woman\u2019s crazed rant actually turned out not to be mental illness, but rather troll job of epic proportions.\n\n\u201cAOC doesn\u2019t rule out eating babies,\u201d LaRouche PAC tweeted after the stunt, taking credit for what they fully expected to happen.\n\nIf the LaRouch political cult (of which, for the record, I\u2019m not a fan) wanted to show that eating babies is really only a few steps away from current insane leftist environmental policy proposals, they certainly succeeded. In the name of \u2018saving the earth,\u2019 these climate-change lunatics want to take us beyond the stone age, to a place where human life is secondary not just to their warped view of what a sustainable planet looks like, but to leftist power and control.", "description": "Sometimes truth is stranger than fiction, and so it was .10/05/2019 0:46:26AM EST.", "authors": ["Scott Morefield", "Beth Baumann", "Katie Pavlich"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/207/2b15e07f-ab31-4f66-af06-6f9fbc4920ed.png", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
