Best of all, it was the inspiration behind the much-loved 19th century children's book Goldilocks and the Three Bears.\n\nLooking for a quaint new family home with plenty of history? Well, this picture-perfect four-bedroom cottage is just the place for anyone who loves a fairy tale story.\n\nThis beautiful cottage was once home to Goldilocks author poet laureate Robert Southey, who wrote the novel whilst living here (it was the cottage that sparked the idea for the Three Bears Cottage in the story). Some of the main selling points new homeowners will love include exposed wooden timber beams, wooden flooring, spacious rooms and many modern technological must-haves.\n\nDownstairs, there is a lovely entrance hall (which is currently being used as a study), a dining area, kitchen and a family reception room. One of our favourite spots is the large living room. Here, you'll find a beautiful log burner, wonderful mantelpiece and useful alcove.\n\nThe dining room has space to seat up to 10 people, so it's perfect if you love to have friends over to share food with. From the kitchen, there's also a door to the patio and a spacious laundry room on the side.\n\nPhoto credit: James Oliver/Fine & Country More\n\nHead upstairs, and you'll discover spacious bedrooms with luxurious en-suites, storage space and contemporary furnishings. One of the bathrooms on this floor is certain to be a favourite with new owners, as it has been modernised with underfloor heating, his-and-hers vanity basins and heated mirrors.\n\nAnd that's not all: the outside of this charming fairy tale cottage is as beautiful as can be. A raised decking area towards the back of the property provides a place to dine alfresco in the summer, while tall trees and well-kept hedges gives an element of privacy. Children especially are certain to love it here.\n\nTempted? This property is currently on the market for \u00a3995,000 via Fine & Country.\n\nTake a tour of the stunning property below...\n\nPhoto credit: James Oliver/Fine & Country More\n\nPhoto credit: James Oliver/Fine & Country More", "description": "It really is a fairy tale cottage full of character", "authors": ["Lisa Walden"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/XO9Hp475tuEy3fEjhhMb4w--~B/aD03MjI7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/country_living_645/b7df63bbe6572e96819b2f583f92c7d2", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
