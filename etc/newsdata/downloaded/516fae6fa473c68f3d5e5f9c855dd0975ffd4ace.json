(Jeremie Richard, AFP)\n\nEnvironmental groups, including Extinction Rebellion, said on Wednesday that they would shut down traffic in Washington, DC, on September 23 and bring daily life to a standstill to demand that political leaders tackle climate change.\n\nThe announcement mirrors disruptive aspirations in London for later this week.\n\nREAD | SA govt lacking 'vision and urgency' on the climate crisis - Greenpeace\n\nThe roughly 15 United States groups planning the protest include traditional environmental groups like 350 DC and Friends of the Earth Action, as well as groups that focus on other issues, such as Black Lives Matter and Code Pink, a women-led group promoting peace and human rights.\n\nKaela Bamberger, an activist aligned with Extinction Rebellion DC, said the coalition plans to ratchet up pressure on US policymakers by shutting down traffic at major intersections.\n\nShe said rallies, marches and petitions have simply not worked.\n\n\"This is definitely a next-level action. The urgency of climate change warrants such an attempt to disrupt business as usual,\" Bamberger said.\n\nGlobal climate strike\n\nThe activists aim to \"make it impossible for people with decision-making power to go about their daily lives as if we are not in the climate emergency\", she added.\n\nAlaina Gertz, a spokesperson for the DC Metropolitan Police Department, said it was aware of the planned environmental protests and that it is \"equipped to handle any-sized First Amendment demonstration\".\n\nThe events are timed to draw attention to a global climate strike on September 20 and the United Nations climate summit in New York City on September 23.\n\nEmployees of large US companies are also participating in the strike.
