It is also a source of public grievances. I have never taken this matter lightly.\u201d\n\nMs Lam said more than 1100 people had been injured and more than 2200 arrested since demonstrations over her government's proposed extradition bill first broke out in June. Violence has gripped the city almost every weekend since then, with police using tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters.\n\nPro-democratic legislators are blocked by security officials as they follow Carrie Lam out of the Legislative Council. AP\n\nThe demonstrations have become increasingly violent in the past month. Smaller groups of protesters have vandalised train stations and mainland Chinese banks, and used petrol bombs when confronted by police.\n\nHowever, on Monday night tens of thousands of people protested peacefully to urge the US government to support proposed laws to protect human rights in the city.\n\nThe US House of Representatives passed legislation this week allowing a review of Hong Kong's human rights record to determine whether the territory can still be treated separately from China on trade and other issues. The Senate would still need to pass the legislation and president Donald Trump would have the final say on any action related to Hong Kong.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChina's trade war with the US is also hurting Hong Kong's economy, on top of the damage inflicted by more than four months of unrest.\n\nTourist numbers have plunged, leaving hotels empty and forcing restaurants to close. Even some high-end fashion labels, long a symbol of the city's wealth, are threatening to close their doors.\n\nThe first meeting of the city's Legislative Council since the summer recess was also adjourned early. Plans to formally abolish the extradition bill, which would have allowed criminals and suspects in Hong Kong to be sent to mainland China, were deferred until next week.\n\nMs Lam's package included 10,000 homes for the poor, first home-owner mortgage perks and subsidies for students and low-income families. The government also plans to reclaim more land in the harbour city, which has one of the highest population densities in the world.\n\nHowever, the package did not address any of the protesters' demands as expected. It was Ms Lam's third policy address in her five-year term.\n\n\"We must reverse the prevalent pessimistic sentiments and stop the disorderly behaviour. We have to put aside differences and stop attacking each other, so that we could set sail again based on the values upheld by all,\" she said.\n\nBernard Chan, a prominent businessman and politician who has been tipped as a potential successor to Ms Lam, told The Australian Financial Review last month he hoped the policy address would be a circuit-breaker to the protests.", "description": "Hong Kong\u2019s embattled chief executive was forced to retreat from the city\u2019s parliament and deliver her annual policy address on television after being shouted down by pro-democracy politicians.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.461%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_832%2C$y_335/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/ad575e5c53c352e4d4119fbdbb56c86f3b9a827c", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
