Dubbed the \u201cMason-Dixon\u201d line, it became the unofficial boundary between North and South.\n\nIn 1851, Moby-Dick by Herman Melville was published. A small band of Herman Melville devotees orated their way through the 135-chapter opus, which took 22 hours and 38 minutes to complete.\n\nIn 1867, the United States completed its purchase of Alaska for $7.2 million, taking possession of the territory from Russia.

In 1987, a former Mexican spy claimed his intelligence unit stole the Soviet satellite while it was on tour in Mexico in 1959, providing the United States with valuable intelligence.\n\nIn 1974, the jury in the Watergate cover-up trial heard a tape recording in which U.S. President Richard Nixon told aide John Dean to try to stop the Watergate burglary investigation before it implicated White House personnel.\n\nIn 1991, Israel and the Soviet Union agreed to renew full diplomatic relations for the first time since 1967.\n\nIn 2002, North Korea revealed it was working on a secret nuclear weapons program. U.S. intelligence officials concluded critical equipment for it came from Pakistan.\n\nIn 2007, former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto returned home after eight years in exile to triumphant fanfare that gave way to panic when a suicide bomber killed more than 140 people in her convoy. She wasn\u2019t hurt in that attack but was assassinated on Dec. 27 of that year in Rawalpindi.\n\nIn 2011, Gilad Shalit, a 25-year-old Israeli soldier kidnapped by the militant Palestinian group Hamas in a high-profile incident, was freed after being held for more than five years. His release came in exchange for 1,000 Palestinians who had spent years in Israeli jails.\n\nA thought for the day: \u201cWe tell ourselves stories in order to live \u2026 . We look for the sermon in the suicide, for the social or moral lesson in the murder of five.\u201d \u2014 American author Joan Didion", "description": "Today is Friday, Oct. 18, the 291st day of 2019 with 74 to follow.
