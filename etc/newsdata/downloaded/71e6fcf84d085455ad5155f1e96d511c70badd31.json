(Chris Hondros/Getty Images)\n\nEleven years after the Lehman Brothers collapse precipitated the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d financial institutions are alive, well, and \u2014 thanks to Trump-era deregulation \u2014 getting more dangerous.\n\nThat\u2019s the view financial watchdog Better Markets lays out in a new report, and it\u2019s one shared by many of the former regulators who helped write the post-crisis Wall Street rulebook.\n\n\u201cThe most dangerous systemic and moral hazard risks in the financial system from [too big to fail] have been increased \u2014 some significantly \u2014 and the overall resilience of the financial system in the US and globally has been reduced,\u201d Better Markets president Dennis Kelleher writes in the report, which he is presenting today at a workshop at the New York Fed.\n\nKelleher, whose nonprofit group advocates tougher restrictions on the indusry, points to a slew of moves by Trump officials to ease strictures on the industry: Weakening capital requirements for big banks; watering down the stress test and living will requirements they face; allowing more risky trading; relaxing enforcement; and rolling back consumer protections, among others \u2014 and those public moves are just the \u201ctip of the deregulatory iceberg.\u201d\n\nThe big banks, of course, disagree. The Financial Services Forum, which represents eight CEOs of the largest banks, argued over the summer that post-crisis rules ended the \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d problem, and with the banks on stable footing, now policymakers should \u201ccontinue to work to improve efficiency, promote economic growth, and create level playing fields within the global financial system.\u201d\n\nThat process of paring back the rules continues today, as the Commodity Futures Trading Commission meets to finalize changes to the Volcker Rule, designed to keep banks from making certain risky bets for their own profits with their customers\u2019 deposits.\n\nFormer Fed chair Paul Volcker. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke)\n\nFormer Fed chair Paul Volcker himself has spoken out against the Trump team\u2019s push to limit the rule's reach. In a late August letter to Fed chair Jerome Powell, Volcker argued \u201cthe new rule substantially narrows the proprietary trading prohibition, enabling banks to speculate freely for their own profit with financial instruments previously under the Volcker Rule's constraints.\u201d\n\n\"These measures appear far afield from the regulators' stated objective of mere simplification,\u201d he wrote, according to Politico\u2019s Victoria Guida.\n\nVolcker isn\u2019t the first former regulator to criticize the deregulation. Back in May, two of his successors atop the central bank \u2014 Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen \u2014 and Jack Lew and Tim Geithner, both Treasury secretaries, went public with a warning about a growing systemic risk they see emerging. They coauthored a letter calling out the Trump administration\u2019s decision to stop designating non-bank financial giants for stricter federal oversight. \u201cThough framed as procedural changes, these amendments amount to a substantial weakening of the post-crisis reforms,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThese changes would make it impossible to prevent the buildup of risk in financial institutions whose failure would threaten the stability of the system as a whole.\u201d\n\nAnd Daniel Tarullo, the Fed governor who spent eight years after the crisis heading up the central bank\u2019s regulatory response, delivered a speech in May raising alarms about how the Trump team\u2019s \u201clow-intensity deregulation\u201d of the financial industry could exacerbate the next meltdown.\n\nKelleher in his presentation will say whether the system is safer and sounder today than in 2008 is the wrong question. \u201cWe better be better off than that!\u201d He argues for a higher standard that assures the rules in place will keep taxpayers off the hook if another Wall Street mega-giant fails. And have the rules met that standard? \u201cGiven the actions of the Trump administration,\u201d he writes, \u201cthe answer is an undeniable and emphatic \u2019no.\u2019\u201d\n\nYou are reading The Finance 202, our must-read tipsheet on where Wall Street meets Washington.

WSJ's Liyan Qi, Grace Zhu, Lin Zhu: \"Economic activity in China cooled further in August, testing Beijing\u2019s tolerance for slower growth as it seeks to ease trade tensions with the U.S. Softness was visible last month in nearly every aspect of the Chinese economy, with industrial output and retail sales data pointing to sluggish demand and low confidence among businesses and consumers.

But so does anxiety among farmers and manufacturers about the economic fallout from the tariffs Mr. Trump has imposed,\u201d the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Lindsay Wise report.\n\n\u201cMr. Moran and some other Republicans\u2014including Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee\u2014are searching for ways to team up with Democrats to reassert congressional authority over the levying of tariffs. They aim to curb the type of tariff-by-tweet policy-making that has whipsawed markets and stressed U.S. businesses in recent months \u2026 Legislation reclaiming congressional trade authority isn\u2019t likely to get far, however, in part because most Republicans are loath to challenge the president and because Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has refused to bring bills to the floor without some certainty that Mr. Trump would sign them.\u201d\n\n\u2014 U.S. envoy takes aim at EU\u2019s next trade chief: \u201cThe United States has fired the first warning shots at the EU's next trade commissioner before he's even taken office,\u201d Politico\u2019s Cristina Gonzalez and Ryan Heath report.\n\n\u201cGordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the EU, branded comments about [Trump] from Commissioner Phil Hogan \u2018unhelpful\u2019 and \u2018very condescending.\u2019 Speaking to POLITICO's EU Confidential podcast, Sondland warned of the dangers of \u2018someone handling the EU trade portfolio whose sole approach is belligerence ... Hogan, the current European agriculture commissioner who is slated to take over the trade portfolio on November 1, told Ireland\u2019s RTE radio last week he would do everything he could \u2018to get Mr. Trump to see the error of his ways\u2019 on trade. The veteran Irish politician said he hopes the U.S. president will \u201cabandon some of the reckless behavior that we have seen from him in relation to his relationship with China and describing the European Union as a security risk.\"\n\n\u2014 Some manufactures are defending Trump\u2019s tariffs: \u201cWhile many American businesses are calling on the Trump administration to end the trade war against China, Wilson Electronics and other manufacturers say that tariffs, if they are targeted in scope, will help address longstanding unfair trade practices used by China,\u201d CNBC\u2019s Spencer Kimball reports.\n\nPOCKET CHANGE\n\nFlint resident Jashanti Walker, who has been a first shift team leader in the body shop for two years, demonstrates with more than a dozen other General Motors employees outside of the Flint Assembly Plant on Sunday.

The company\u2019s move to seek financial shelter, part of a tentative settlement with thousands of litigants, will shift the focus to new wrangling over how potential proceeds will be divvied up by communities reeling under the burden of addiction and overdose deaths.\"\n\n\u2014 Gucci\u2019s 'blackface' sweater cost company: \u201cGucci boosted its brand and sales by using social media to flaunt its connections with hip-hop artists and promote its theatrical fashion shows, but that momentum reversed in February, after the release of a sweater that critics likened to blackface,\u201d WSJ\u2019s Eric Sylvers and Suzanne Kapner report.\n\n\u201cThe result: Gucci lost the top spot among luxury companies for social-media engagement in March, according to Tribe Dynamics, and in July it reported its first quarterly drop in North American sales since early 2016. The retreat shows how luxury companies that thrive on Instagram and other social-media outlets can just as quickly stumble because of them. Such platforms have become the lifeblood of the attention-seeking fashion business, a marketing strategy that Gucci built around its star designer Alessandro Michele.\u201d\n\nCHART TOPPER\n\nVia The Economist's Simon Rabinovich, a look at China's ongoing move to a state-led economic model:\n\nRegression of China's economy towards more of a state-led model continues.
