The case is fraught with changing testimony, and authorities still haven't recovered the body of Arieanna Day, who vanished last year.\n\nArieanna's mother, Jessica Day, testified she repeatedly lied to police, saying at different times that Arieanna was kidnapped by an adoption agency, smothered while breastfeeding and given away to Terry's cousin.\n\nShe said Thursday that Terry actually took away Arieanna. Terry previously admitted, recanted and admitted again to burying Arieanna. Defense attorney Angi Simpkins questioned if Arieanna had actually died.\n\nProsecutor Mary Pettitt says she hasn't decided on a retrial.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
