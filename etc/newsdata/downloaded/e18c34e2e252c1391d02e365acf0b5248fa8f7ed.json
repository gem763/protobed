In fact, direct property makes up about 15 per cent of all SMSF assets. This has been the case consistently over many years, even as the total value of assets owned by SMSFs has increased.\n\nThe split between commercial and residential direct property has been fairly consistent, too, with about 10 per cent invested in commercial property and 5 per cent in residential (based on published annual ATO statistics).\n\nOwning direct property may have been the motivation to set up an SMSF initially. Or it may be the opportunity to have rental income received by the fund from a related business leasing commercial property owned by the fund, which adds to the retirement savings of the members of the SMSF who also own the business.\n\nThe clear advantages of owning direct property in your SMSF include receiving the rental income paid to the SMSF for use of the asset and a lower capital gains tax rate on disposal of the property. The rental income adds to your retirement savings and is taxed at the concessional rate of 15 per cent. Where the property is owned for greater than 12 months before sale, then only two-thirds of the resulting capital gain is taxed at the 15 per cent fund tax rate. Expenses of owning and deriving the rental income are tax-deductible, just as they are for any other rental property investment.\n\nHowever, unlike owning rental property personally, there are some specific rules and potential limitations about owning and renting property in your SMSF.
