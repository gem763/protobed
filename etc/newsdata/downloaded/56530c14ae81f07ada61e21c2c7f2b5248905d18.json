And here I thought the Senate was dull.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nDuring a CNN interview on Thursday, Paul questioned the allegiance to Trump of both Cheney \u2014 who is considering a Senate bid next year \u2014 and her father, the former vice president Richard B. Cheney.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI guess the problem with the Cheneys, both Dick and Liz, is that they\u2019ve always been Never Trumpers. They hate President Trump\u2019s foreign policy, they want to stay in Afghanistan forever.\u201d\n\nPaul then brought up John Bolton, Trump\u2019s hawkish national security adviser who parted ways with the president this week after clashes with Trump on an array of issues.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re apologizing for John Bolton, they love John Bolton,\u201d Paul said of the Cheneys. \u201cSo really they\u2019re part of this foreign policy swamp that\u2019s trying to undermine President Trump.\u201d In an earlier tweet, Paul accused the congresswoman, who holds a position in House Republican leadership, of \u201cpro-Bolton blather.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nA Liz Cheney vs. Rand Paul spat epitomizes the GOP\u2019s increasingly Trump-ified foreign policy\n\nCheney responded shortly afterward on Twitter, referring to Paul\u2019s Republican bid for president in which he was eclipsed by Trump in the primaries.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHi @RandPaul I know the 2016 race was painful for you since you were such a big loser (then & now) with a dismal 4.5% in Iowa,\u201d Cheney wrote of Paul\u2019s fifth-place finish in the nation\u2019s first caucus state.\n\nCheney also tacked on a 2015 tweet from Trump about his then-rival Paul.\n\n\u201cTruly weird Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky reminds me of a spoiled brat without a properly functioning brain. He was terrible at DEBATE!\u201d Trump said.\n\n\u201cNo truer words were ever spoken,\u201d Cheney added in her own voice.\n\nPaul didn\u2019t take long to fire back.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHey @Liz_Cheney I feel like you might just be mad still about when Candidate Trump shredded your Dad\u2019s failed foreign policy and endless wars,\u201d Paul wrote in a tweet, attaching a news article about a GOP primary debate in which Trump decried the U.S. intervention in Iraq during Cheney\u2019s vice presidency.\n\nAD\n\nLiz Cheney, in response, pointed to the photo of candidates that accompanied the article.\n\n\u201cWeird. I don\u2019t see you on stage here, @RandPaul,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cOh, right. My bad - you had already lost.\u201d\n\nShe added a hashtag: \u201c#weirdRand.\u201d\n\nPaul later fired back at Cheney with several more tweets in which he shared news stories about Cheney\u2019s criticism of Trump on various foreign policy topics, such as the importance of NATO. Paul also added a few hashtags of his own, including \u201c#WarmongerCheneys\u201d and \u201c#NeverTrumpCheneys.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe tone of the exchange between Paul and the younger Cheney was noted by CNN anchor Brianna Keilar as she interviewed Paul. Keilar noted that both the congresswoman and the senator had been critical of Trump at times in the past and asked if Paul worried that the spat had devolved into a competition for Trump\u2019s attention \u201cthat\u2019s a little unbecoming of two members of Congress?\u201d\n\nAD\n\nPaul, who\u2019s repaired his relationship with Trump enough that they sometimes golf together, insisted his differences with Cheney were rooted in genuine policy differences, including how quickly the United States should withdraw troops from Afghanistan.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t just about me butting heads with the Never Trumpers in the Cheney family,\u201d Paul said.\n\nAD\n\nHe echoed that sentiment in a statement on Friday, saying: \u201cFew people have been as wrong on foreign policy over the last few years as the neocons and Liz Cheney. The Twitter exchange represents a real and significant debate on the future of our foreign policy between realists like myself and NeverTrumper neoconservatives like Cheney.\u201d\n\nDuring Friday\u2019s news conference, Liz Cheney also sought to make the case that important policy issues underlie her feud with Paul.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere are issues that surround whether or not you put America first, as President Trump does, or blame America first, as Rand Paul does and has for years,\u201d she said.\n\nCheney then turned to Trump\u2019s efforts to boost spending on the military.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cOne of the most important things this president has done since he\u2019s been in office is devote the resources we need to rebuild our military, an effort that Senator Paul has not supported,\u201d she said.\n\nCheney\u2019s relationship with Trump could be particularly important to her political future if she moves forward with a Senate bid next year in Wyoming, which in 2016 was the most pro-Trump state in the nation. Trump prevailed there over Democrat Hillary Clinton, 67 percent to 22 percent.\n\nMike DeBonis and Felicia Sonmez contributed to this report.\n\nRead more at PowerPost\n\nAD", "description": "A feud between the Kentucky senator and Wyoming congresswoman moved from exchanges over foreign policy to other more snarky topics on Thursday.", "authors": ["John Wagner", "National Reporter Leading The Post'S Breaking Political News Team"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Oo254dapSxxYmCrDNyHlBNRjbRo=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/E7NRJMGWHII6TFQQ7NLMKURODQ.jpg"}
