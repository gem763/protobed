Rand Paul (Ky.) and Rep. Liz Cheney (Wyo.) escalated on Thursday, with the two Republicans trading insults as they both sought to position themselves as more aligned with President Trump.\n\nWhat began as an exchange of different views on Afghanistan policy moved on to other subjects during several tweets and an afternoon television appearance by Paul. During a CNN interview, he questioned the allegiance of both Cheney and her father, the former Republican vice president Richard B. Cheney, to Trump.\n\n\u201cI guess the problem with the Cheneys, both Dick and Liz, is that they\u2019ve always been Never Trumpers. They hate President Trump\u2019s foreign policy, they want to stay in Afghanistan forever.\u201d\n\nPaul then brought up John Bolton, Trump\u2019s hawkish national security adviser who parted ways with the president this week after clashes with Trump on an array of issues.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re apologizing for John Bolton, they love John Bolton,\u201d Paul said of the Cheneys. \u201cSo really they\u2019re part of this foreign policy swamp that\u2019s trying to undermine President Trump.\u201d In an earlier tweet, Paul accused the congresswoman, who holds a position in House Republican leadership, of \u201cpro-Bolton blather.\u201d\n\n[A Liz Cheney vs. Rand Paul spat epitomizes the GOP\u2019s increasingly Trump-ified foreign policy]\n\n\n\nRep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) pauses as she and other Republican leaders speak to reporters at the Capitol last week. (J. Scott Applewhite/AP)\n\nCheney responded shortly afterward on Twitter, referring to Paul\u2019s Republican bid for president in which he was eclipsed by Trump in the primaries.\n\n\u201cHi @RandPaul I know the 2016 race was painful for you since you were such a big loser (then & now) with a dismal 4.5% in Iowa,\u201d Cheney wrote of Paul\u2019s fifth-place finish in the nation\u2019s first caucus state.\n\nCheney also tacked on a 2015 tweet from Trump about his then-rival Paul.\n\n\u201cTruly weird Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky reminds me of a spoiled brat without a properly functioning brain. He was terrible at DEBATE!\u201d Trump said.\n\n\u201cNo truer words were ever spoken,\u201d Cheney added in her own voice.\n\nPaul didn\u2019t take long to fire back.\n\n\u201cHey @Liz_Cheney I feel like you might just be mad still about when Candidate Trump shredded your Dad\u2019s failed foreign policy and endless wars,\u201d Paul wrote in a tweet, attaching a news article about a GOP primary debate in which Trump decried the U.S. intervention in Iraq during Cheney\u2019s vice presidency.\n\nLiz Cheney, in response, pointed to the photo of candidates that accompanied the article.\n\n\u201cWeird. I don\u2019t see you on stage here, @RandPaul,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cOh, right. My bad - you had already lost.\u201d\n\nShe added a hashtag: \u201c#weirdRand\u201d\n\nPaul later fired back at Cheney with several more tweets in which he shared news stories about Cheney\u2019s criticism of Trump on various foreign policy topics, such as the importance of NATO. Paul also added a few hashtags of his own, including \u201c#WarmongerCheneys\u201d and \u201c#NeverTrumpCheneys.\u201d\n\nThe tone of the exchange between Paul and the younger Cheney was noted by CNN anchor Brianna Keilar as she interviewed Paul. Keilar noted that both the congresswoman and the senator had been critical of Trump at times in the past and asked if Paul worried that the spat had devolved into a competition for Trump\u2019s attention \u201cthat\u2019s a little unbecoming of two members of Congress?\u201d\n\nPaul, who\u2019s repaired his relationship with Trump enough that they sometimes golf together, insisted his differences with Cheney were rooted in genuine policy differences, including how quickly the United States should withdraw troops from Afghanistan.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t just about me butting heads with the Never Trumpers in the Cheney family,\u201d Paul said.\n\nCheney\u2019s relationship with Trump could be particularly important to her political future. She is considering running for the Senate next year from Wyoming, which in 2016 was the most pro-Trump state in the nation.\n\nAs he kicked off the House Republican retreat in Baltimore late Thursday afternoon, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) was asked about the spat. He pushed back against the notion that the argument between Paul and Cheney is indicative of a broader split within the Republican Party over Bolton\u2019s exit.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a difference of opinion when it comes to national defense, and it\u2019s simply that. People can have a discussion about policy. That\u2019s healthy. ... The Republicans have never been more united.\u201d\n\nFelicia Sonmez contributed to this report.\n\nRead more at PowerPost", "description": "A feud between the Kentucky senator and Wyoming congresswoman moved from exchanges over foreign policy to other topics on Thursday.", "authors": ["John Wagner", "National Reporter Leading The Post'S Breaking Political News Team", "September At Pm", "John Wagner Is A National Reporter Who Leads The Post'S New Breaking Political News Team.
