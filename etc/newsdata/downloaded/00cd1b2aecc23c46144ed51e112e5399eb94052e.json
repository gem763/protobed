The researchers claim to have found evidence, in mice, that e-cigarette vapour is capable of causing certain kinds of cancer. But there\u2019s still a long way to go before we can know if the same is true in people and how large of a cancer risk it could pose.\n\nThere\u2019ve been hints that e-cigarette vapour, much like tobacco smoke, could be carcinogenic. In an earlier study by the same team of researchers, all based at New York University\u2019s School of Medicine, they found that vaping could damage DNA in the bladder and lung cells of both mice and people enough to increase their risk of turning cancerous. And other scientists have found the presence of chemicals known to be carcinogenic in e-cigarette vapour, especially from flavoured products.\n\nBut the new study, published in the Proceedings of the U.S. National Academies of Science, is perhaps the first to so directly tie e-cigarettes to cancer.\n\nFor their study, the researchers experimented with mice for little over a year. Over a period of 54 weeks, they exposed groups of mice to three different conditions, each lasting four hours a day, five days a week.\n\nOne group of mice spent time in a chamber filled with e-cigarette vapour created by a machine that mimicked a typical vaping product, meaning that nicotine was heated and aerosolised from a liquid containing the solvents propylene glycol and vegetable glycerin. Another group was exposed to vapourised air just containing the solvents, and the third simply spent their time breathing filtered air.\n\nBy the time the experiment ended, nine of the 40 mice (22.5 per cent) exposed to typical e-cigarette vapour developed lung cancer, while only one of the mice in either control group did the same. More than half of the e-cigarette vapour group also developed an enlarged bladder (a condition called hyperplasia), a risk factor for bladder cancer, compared to a single mouse who did the same across both control groups.\n\nAccording to lead author Moon-Shong Tang, a molecular biologist at NYU, the team also found that certain cancer-causing compounds, called nitrosamines, are formed in the bodies of mice when exposed to vapour filled with nicotine. These nitrosamines are known carcinogens in both mice and humans.\n\n\u201cSo, the probability is very high that e-cigarette vapour is a human carcinogen,\u201d Tang told Gizmodo via email.\n\nThe team\u2019s findings, scary as they are, do carry some important limitations. Mice aren\u2019t people, of course, but the type of mouse used by Tang and his team is more susceptible to cancer-causing chemicals over its one-year life span than other mice.\n\nThese mice are often used in cancer research because it usually takes a long time to spot whether any particular thing can cause cancer (that said, they aren\u2019t genetically predisposed to lung cancer). So while this study might show that e-cigarette vapour can be cancerous, it can\u2019t predict how carcinogenic it could be in humans.\n\nThere\u2019s a similar gap when it comes to figuring out how much of a cancer risk e-cigarettes are compared to traditional tobacco smoking. At this point, Tang said, there isn\u2019t any sense of how relatively carcinogenic vaping might be when stacked up against smoking. And the authors wrote that their results shouldn\u2019t lead the public to \u201cequate the risk\u201d of vaping to smoking.\n\nAt the same time, some health experts and organisations have been vocal in pronouncing e-cigarettes to be around 95 per cent less harmful than tobacco cigarettes. Much of that calculation has weighed on evidence that nicotine itself isn\u2019t carcinogenic, or that vaping barely exposes people to its cancer-causing byproducts, the nitrosamines. But if Tang and his team are really onto something here, then that 95 per cent figure might lie on shaky ground.\n\nIn any case, the debate is unlikely to be settled anytime soon, even as research in both mice and humans continues.\n\n\u201cIt takes two decades or more for a life-time smoker to develop lung cancer,\u201d Tang noted. \u201cIf tobacco smoke-induced lung carcinogenesis is a paradigm for e-cig carcinogenicity, then it will take at least another decade to have e-cig-related human lung cancer to show up.\u201d\n\nIn other words, it\u2019s going to take a long time studying people who vape to truly know how much risk there is \u2014 and that\u2019s leaving aside the more immediate, potentially fatal dangers of using unregulated vaping products.", "description": "A new study out Tuesday is yet more evidence that vaping isn\u2019t the completely safe alternative to smoking it was once thought to be.
