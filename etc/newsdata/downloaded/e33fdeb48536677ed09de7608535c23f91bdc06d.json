I\u2019m just thinking of the bigger picture and trying to protect my eyes.\u201d\n\nThe eyewear, which is designed to be safe for both the player wearing them and opposition players, was approved by World Rugby in May following extensive development and trialling.\n\nSavea tested the goggles during All Blacks\u2019 training in Beppu this week without any apparent impairment to his game.\n\n\u201cIn terms of vision and seeing, it\u2019s pretty sweet, and it\u2019s now just a matter of getting used to them,\u201d he said.\n\nAll Blacks doctor, Tony Page, said the 25-year-old was ready to run out against Canada with the goggles on, having successfully tested them in challenging conditions on the training ground.\n\nWhat the All Blacks can hope to gain from their remaining World Cup pool matches | Matt McIlraith Read more\n\n\u201cHumidity at up to 90%, 20C or so, and hard All Blacks training, and he\u2019s done pretty well,\u201d Page said. \u201cIt\u2019s great to see someone like Ardie putting them on and being proud of it.\u201d\n\nThe Hurricanes star will become the first player to wear goggles in a World Cup, but not the first at international level: Italy\u2019s Ian McKinley wore a pair in a Test match against Ireland in Dublin in August.\n\nSavea said he hoped his decision would give confidence to visually-impaired children around the world to take up rugby.\n\n\u201cIf by me wearing these inspires them to get some, and for them to try out the game of rugby, then it\u2019s a positive all round for our sport.\u201d", "description": "Ardie Savea will become the first player to wear goggles in a Rugby World Cup match, a move he said could save him from going blind", "authors": ["Guardian Sport"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a9d31fc4207e9fab590448b9fde4fd15b097fb7/0_158_4772_2864/master/4772.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9b5b87fa29c9a71fc6f2d60e0461dd0c", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
