A bunch of people around the world making idiots of themselves with the help of a giant flexible ring with a Joy-Con in it. A Ring-Con, if you will.\n\nOn their left thigh is a holster with the other Joy-Con. They run in place in impeccably dressed living rooms, their faces scrunched as they rapidly squish and pull the ring. Safe at my desk, ignoring my Apple Watch\u2019s pleas to get up and stand, I had the same reaction watching the trailer as I do watching someone play a VR game in real life. I shoved some Pop Chips in my mouth and said, \u201cNerds.\u201d\n\nAs as a willing fitness tech guinea pig, I jumped at the chance to try it out for myself though. Despite my initial prejudices, I have to admit a 20-minute demo was not only fun, but it also left me feeling the burn. Turns out, when a game is fun you really don\u2019t care how stupid you look playing it.\n\nThe game has a few modes. There\u2019s a traditional story mode in which you try to defeat your arch-nemesis, Dragaux, a buff dragon in a leotard. Nintendo told me the dragon was meant to represent the \u201cnegative aspects of gym culture.\u201d He does, indeed, look like every gym bro who\u2019s ever flexed on you for using their favourite machine.\n\nRunning in place will make your character move in the game, and how fast you go actually depends on how much you hustle. At the optimal speed, your character\u2019s hair lights on fire. You can also squeeze the ring to shoot obstacles or pull to suck up coins and other items. Pointing down with the ring while running will let you jump.\n\nBattling baddies involves using certain exercises as attacks. For example, 20 squats will beat up an enemy; to defend yourself you squish the Ring-Con into your abs in a move called \u201cAb Guard.\u201d It takes some mild coordination \u2014 I had a hard time remembering how to jump in the moment. The Ring-Con is also much harder to manipulate than Nintendo\u2019s trailer would lead you to believe. I played three levels total and my arms are still tingly as I type this.\n\nBehold, the one Ring-Con. (Photo: Victoria Song, Gizmodo)\n\nYou can also play some sweet Wario Ware-esque mini-games, or if you\u2019d rather stick to the basics, you can do set exercises that target a specific muscle group. Of the ones I tried, the Squatter\u2019s Wheel was the most challenging. You\u2019re basically given a shape, which you then have to recreate on a potter\u2019s wheel by squatting and manipulating the Ring-Con. Nintendo had me try working my pectorals by squishing the ring as many times as I could in a 20-second period. It sounds easy, but 70 reps left me out of breath and reaching for some water.\n\nAnother feature is that after each exercise, you have the option of sticking your finger over the Joy-Con\u2019s IR sensor to get a reading of your heart rate. I\u2019m not terribly sure how accurate it or the estimated calorie counts are.\n\nWe\u2019ll need more testing but I did happen to be wearing an Apple Watch Series 5 at the same time and the Joy-Con\u2019s measurement seemed to average about 10 beats per minute more. That said, you\u2019re definitely not going to burn as many calories as you would playing Dance Dance Revolution on hard. (You don\u2019t need as much coordination either.)\n\nAs for the hardware itself, the Ring-Con is sturdily built. It basically functions as a sort of resistance band, though it\u2019s impressive that Nintendo\u2019s managed to stick a bunch of sensors inside it. I noticed some slip and slide with the leg strap, but not enough to actually detract mid-game.\n\nPhoto: Raul Marrero, Gizmodo\n\nSo, can you work your puff into tuff with Ring Fit Adventure? Ehh. It\u2019s more like a spiritual successor to Wii Fit than a viable replacement for the gym. That said, it did get my heart rate up to about 130bpm (as measured by the seemingly more accurate Apple Watch), which definitely counts as cardio. It\u2019s also nice that you get guided visuals for doing various bodyweight exercises like squats, chest-to-knee presses, and planks.\n\nAs someone who absolutely hates strength training, Ring Fit Adventure seems like it could be a fun way of tricking myself into doing some bodyweight and resistance exercises for an afternoon.\n\nIt\u2019s available October 18 for $124.95. That gets you the Ring-Con, leg strap and the game itself. It\u2019s pricier than your average Switch game, but you are getting hardware with it. Nintendo also told me that if you played an hour a day in the story mode, you\u2019d still get about 3 months of play before finishing the game. And trust me, an hour of play a day is more than enough.", "description": "If you watch the trailer for Ring Fit Adventure for the Nintendo Switch, it looks silly.
