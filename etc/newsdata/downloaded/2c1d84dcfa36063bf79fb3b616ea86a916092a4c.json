He made the admission on ABC\u2019s Good Morning America in a wide-ranging interview, his first on-camera appearance since news broke weeks ago that President Donald Trump urged Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate his work for the company.\n\nIn the interview, ABC News\u2019 Amy Robach asked Biden if he would have gotten the board position if he hadn\u2019t been the son of the vice president.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cProbably not, in retrospect. But that\u2019s\u2014you know\u2014I don\u2019t think that there\u2019s a lot of things that would have happened in my life if my last name wasn\u2019t Biden.\u201d\n\nHe said it was a mistake because it gave Republicans material to use to criticize his father.\n\n\u201cDid I make a mistake? Well, maybe in the grand scheme of things, yeah,\u201d he said. \u201cBut did I make a mistake based upon some ethical lapse? Absolutely not.\u201d\n\nBiden also said he had no extensive knowledge of Ukraine\u2019s natural-gas industry, but that other members of the board also lacked expertise. He cited his work as vice chairman of Amtrak, chairman of the board of the UN food program, and his work as a lawyer for white-shoe law firm Boies Schiller as his qualifications.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t regret being on the board,\u201d he continued, \u201cbut what I regret is not taking into account that there would be a Rudy Giuliani and a president of the U.S. that would be listening to this ridiculous conspiracy idea which has again been completely debunked by everyone.\u201d\n\nGiuliani, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, spent months traveling around Ukraine and Europe, trying to find dirt on Hunter Biden to boost Trump\u2019s electoral prospects. In the process, he essentially conducted shadow foreign policy for Trump. And according to the White House memo of a call between Trump and Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump urged him to talk with Giuliani about his Burisma Holdings investigation. The revelations kicked off an impeachment inquiry by House Democrats. And they disturbed many Republicans as well.\n\nThe Trump family, meanwhile, has stayed focused on Hunter Biden. In the process, he\u2019s become a prominent national figure.\n\nHe said he would never go to rallies and criticize Trump\u2019s children, alluding to Eric Trump recently leading \u201clock him up\u201d chants about Biden. But later in the interview, he still took a shot at the president\u2019s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., who tweeted numerous times about Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings, and referred to the former vice president as \u201c#QuidProJoe.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been through some sh-- stuff in my life,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI\u2019ve been through some real, real stuff. This isn\u2019t real stuff. It isn\u2019t. It truly isn\u2019t. That part of it, that Barnum and Bailey\u2014you know, say anything, do anything you want, you know, I mean, like, you know, Donald Prince Humperdinck\u2014Trump Jr. is not somebody that I really care about.\u201d", "description": "The former vice president\u2019s son denied that his position on the board of a Ukrainian natural-gas company was unethical.", "authors": ["Betsy Swan", "Political Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_519,w_922,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571140150/Screen_Shot_2019-10-15_at_7.47.35_AM_rwxoog", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
