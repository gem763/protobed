Francophones control Cameroon's government, which has been assigning French-speaking judges and teachers to courts and schools in Anglophone regions. Some English speakers say they're denied equal representation and access, and the debate has escalated to a violent internal conflict that has claimed hundreds of lives.\n\nIn this episode of The Take, we look at how Al Jazeera has covered the conflict on the ground and what they've learned from the hundreds of WhatsApp messages the network's Newsgrid programme has exchanged with Cameroonians. And we check in with an Al Jazeera English correspondent covering the coup in Sudan, which this week saw the overthrow of longtime dictator Omar al-Bashir.\n\nFor more:\n\nA look at Cameroon's language divide\n\nIs Cameroon persecuting its English-speakers?\n\nDozens of Anglophone separatists killed in Cameroon\n\nCameroon displaced speak of death, displacement, trauma\n\nThe Team:\n\nNey Alvarez produced this episode with Priyanka Tilve, Jasmin Bauomy, Alexandra Locke, Dina Kesbeh, Morgan Waters and Amy Walters.
