Canopy Growth CGC, +0.73% and Tilray TLRY, +3.25%, two bellwethers, had plummeted even more \u2014 by 54% and 64%, respectively. The popular ETFMG Alternative Harvest exchange traded fund MJ, +1.88% had fallen 45%.\n\nBut cannabis investors, take heart. Cannabis stocks are about to get higher valuations. That\u2019s because the selling became so extreme last month, marijuana stocks hit capitulation lows Aug. 28, the Bear Traps Report\u2019s Larry McDonald wrote on that day.\n\nHe suggested investors take opening, one-third positions in the ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF as a contrarian bet on the group. McDonald made a good call, even if he stopped short of saying go all in. Since then, cannabis stocks have rallied nicely.\n\nBut they have more to go. Capitulation lows are blow-off events in which most of the losers and weak hands finally throw in the towel. As such, they can punctuate a bottom by clearing the negativity, and serve as the starting point for a sentiment reset. All the bad news \u2014 and there is plenty of it \u2014 seems to be priced in. Yet several catalysts loom. They will continue to fire up sentiment.\n\nCannabis stocks do not have the insider buying I normally like to have on my side, but they\u2019re disliked enough to give them the out-of-favor contrarian profile I like to see to put names in my stock letter, Brush Up on Stocks.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at what\u2019s gone wrong \u2014 and what could go right \u2014 to continue driving marijuana stocks higher, even if it won\u2019t be straight up.\n\nCatalyst No. 1: Branded edibles begin to take off in Canada\n\nA big knock on cannabis companies is that weed is a boring commodity, much like corn or wheat. This is such a common gripe, it\u2019s a mere clich\u00e9 by now. But publicly traded cannabis suppliers do need to break out of commodity jail. To do so, they have to learn how to be to marijuana what Coca-Cola KO, -0.22% and Pepsi PEP, -0.40% are to sugar water. They have to develop powerful brands in higher-margin derivative products such as edibles, vapes and drinks that consumers love.\n\nThey\u2019re about to get their first big shot on goal in Canada, which has been paving new ground in legalized cannabis.\n\nUntil recently, Canada had only approved the sale of bud, oils (tinctures) and gel caps. Now that\u2019s changed. Canada recently cleared the way for legal edible products, vapes and cannabis drinks. They will start hitting the shelves in December. This development \u2014 and the buildup to it between now and then \u2014 will generate a lot of buzz among cannabis investors, and shift the sentiment needle back toward bullish. That will push cannabis stocks higher between now and year-end, and beyond.\n\n\u201cWe will see a slew of new products hitting the market,\u201d says Korey Bauer, portfolio manager of the Cannabis Growth Fund CANNX, +1.49%. \u201cWe think this is going to be massive for these companies.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m personally really excited about edibles legalization in Canada,\u201d says Motley Fool investment analyst Emily Flippen, who studies the cannabis space. She says it will give companies the chance to sell higher-margin products, and shake off their commodity status. The edibles and vape breakthrough will also broaden the appeal of cannabis among consumers.\n\nTo understand why, consider how popular these products are in the U.S. market. Derivative cannabis products \u2014 as opposed to plain old bud \u2014 account for roughly 60% of sales in the legal U.S. markets and a disproportionate percentage of growth, says Stifel analyst W. Andrew Carter.\n\nIn a follow up column on cannabis names, I\u2019ll present the companies most likely to benefit from the changes in Canada and the all-important brand development opportunity coming down the tracks as a result.\n\nCatalyst No. 2: Trump (potentially) comes to the rescue\n\nPolitical analysts claim to be unsure about President Donald Trump\u2019s views on cannabis. But there are plenty of signs that Trump doesn\u2019t have the typical New Yorker\u2019s \u201clive and let live\u201d outlook. He hired (and then fired) an attorney general who vowed to enforce federal prohibition of cannabis. Surgeon General Jerome Adams just published a scathing report on the very real health risks of weed, which I have also written about. Trump himself is donating part of his salary, about $100,000, to fund a media campaign on marijuana risks.\n\nAt the same time, though, Trump loves being president. So he is going to do what it takes to stay in office. That may mean a quick reversal on marijuana. Democratic presidential candidates are tripping over themselves to endorse progressive views on weed legalization. It would be just like Trump to undercut them by deciding to work toward legalization, or endorse states rights on the issue. Such a high-profile tactical move by our teetotaler president would boost sentiment on cannabis stocks, driving them higher.\n\nCatalyst No. 3: Companies get more venues to sell their wares\n\nMarijuana smokers love their bud tenders. \u201cPeople really like to go to stores and see the product and talk about what it does,\u201d says Bauer at the Cannabis Growth mutual fund. \u201cIt is crucial for these stores to educate people on what they are buying.\u201d\n\nIn other words, the number of stores is key to sales, and it turns out there aren\u2019t enough of them in Canada. But that will soon change. Canada has recently conducted lotteries to license stores to developers. \u201cThe store shortage is going to be corrected,\u201d says Bauer. \u201cWe think this is going to be absolutely huge in the next 24 months. As more stores roll out, this will be a tail wind for licensed producers.\u201d\n\nThe Canadian market is the key piece of the puzzle here because virtually all of the publicly traded cannabis suppliers are based in Canada, selling into that market. They are loathe to sell in U.S. markets since that would violate U.S. law, which could get them kicked off their stock exchanges.\n\nCatalyst No. 4: Less Sturm und Drang for the industry\n\nA big reason why marijuana stocks have been weak is the perfect storm of disasters that hit this summer. It\u2019s been enough to put the enthusiasm of the most ardent bull in couch lock \u2014 and that\u2019s exactly what happened.\n\n\u2022 The supplier CannTrust CTST, +1.82% was caught growing in illegal labs. That helped push the stock down to $2 from $12 a year ago. A lot of investor wealth and enthusiasm got burned in the process. \u201cIt really shook confidence in the sector because they were considered safe and vetted,\u201d says Todd Harrison, the chief investment officer at CB1 Capital, which invests in the industry.\n\n\u2022 Suppliers Canopy Growth, Tilray and HEXO HEXO, +0.45% all reported lousy quarterly results. So did Charlotte\u2019s Web CWBHF, +0.72%, which sells cannabidiol (CBD) for purported medical use.\n\n\u2022 Canopy\u2019s board kicked out CEO and marijuana-sector apostle Bruce Linton in a surprise move that shook a lot of investors.\n\n\u2022 Quebec announced tight restrictions on edibles based on concerns they might appeal too much to children.\n\nIn short, investors got rattled. That\u2019s a bunch of bad stuff at once, and in a kind of mean reversion to the norm, a stretch of time without a lot of disasters will heal the wounds, and boost sentiment toward the group.\n\nCatalyst No. 5: Investors get clarity on the regulatory front\n\nThe cannabis sector is a regulatory briar patch. In the U.S., the drug is illegal at the federal level but increasingly legal among states. The FDA discourages CBD-infused products, yet they continue to be readily sold and openly promoted on Facebook FB, -1.37% and Twitter TWTR, -2.28%, complete with exaggerated and false claims of medical efficacy. Canada legalized derivative products, but Quebec said \u201cnot so fast\u201d to sweets that would appeal to children.\n\nProgress toward regulatory clarity in any of these areas will reassure investors and boost enthusiasm toward cannabis stocks.\n\nIn the U.S., a proposed Secure and Fair Enforcement (SAFE) Banking Act would let banks legally get involved in the sector. A proposed Strengthening the Tenth Amendment Through Entrusting States (STATES) Act would recognize the legalization of cannabis in states. No one expects those bills to be approved soon. \u201cBut as long as they are moving in the right direction, the market will see this as a positive catalyst,\u201d says Bauer.\n\nAs for Quebec, Flippen at the Motley Fool thinks the province might not harsh on sweetened edibles as much as a lot of investors believe. \u201cI think it is all going to come down to packaging,\u201d she says. \u201cQuebec may allow edibles that are sweet, but packaged in way that does not appeal to children.\u201d\n\nThen there\u2019s the Big Lebowski of breakthroughs in weed regulation \u2014 legalization at the federal level.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of if, but when, the federal government legalizes,\u201d says Flippen. Former Republican House Speaker John Boehner, who is on the board of the cannabis company Acreage Holdings ACRGF, +4.38%, \u201ccontinues to say that representatives are coming around to legalization,\u201d says Flippen. He sees legalization or decriminalization on the federal level by 2020 or 2021.\n\nProgress here would really light up the group.\n\nAt the time of publication, Michael Brush had no positions in any stocks mentioned in this column.
