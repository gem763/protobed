Trump encouraged mediation efforts by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and French President Emmanuel Macron, but those were spurned by Tehran, as was Trump\u2019s suggestion of a meeting this month in New York with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani.\n\nAgainst a cocky Iran, the Trump administration continues its relatively soft line. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said this week that last Saturday\u2019s attacks were an \u201cact of war.\u201d But Thursday, he blandly countered Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif\u2019s threat of \u201call-out war\u201d against any retaliation with the assurance that his goal was \u201cachieving peace and peaceful resolution.\u201d\n\nThe Iran confrontation converges on three painful realities: Iran is now a full-fledged menace to security and oil shipments in the region; any military action against Iran must include some Saudi forces for it to be politically acceptable in the United States; Saudis and Emiratis, seeing anew their vulnerability, are wary of open conflict.", "description": "", "authors": ["David Ignatius", "Washingtonpost.Com Opinions Global-Opinions The-Escalating-Crisis-With-Iran-Is-Trumps-Self-Inflicted-Wound"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
