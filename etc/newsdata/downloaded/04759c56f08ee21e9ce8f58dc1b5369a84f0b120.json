The inferno also became an emblem of the rising cost of living in the Bay Area, which led so many people to seek shelter in a run-down building.\n\nThe two men on trial were Derick Almena, 49, the master tenant and leaseholder, and Max Harris, 29, described by prosecutors as Mr. Almena\u2019s right hand in managing the warehouse, who collected rent from tenants and arranged events. They each were charged with 36 counts of involuntary manslaughter and faced a maximum of 39 years in prison.", "description": "A 2016 blaze at a converted warehouse in Oakland, Calif., killed 36 people.
