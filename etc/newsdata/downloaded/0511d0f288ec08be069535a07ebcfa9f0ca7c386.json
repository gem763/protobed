It fell below 50 percent for the first time in the last elections in 2014.\n\n- 'Massively rigged' -\n\nThe three-party UDC, which has posed the greatest challenge so far to BDP dominance, claimed the election was \"massively rigged\" and riddled with irregularities around voter registration which \"undermine the credibility\" of these elections.\n\n\"Throughout, the IEC has shown grave incompetence and could not have delivered a free and fair election,\" UDC leader Duma Boko told AFP\n\nThe election outcome \"does not deserve any respect,\" Boko charged.\n\nBoko also fingered the ruling party for a \"deliberate and well-orchestrated plan to steal this election\", after it realised that it was on \"very shaky ground\".\n\nThe UDC won 17 out of the 57 seats in the last election five years ago.\n\nOn Friday an observer mission from the regional bloc, the Southern African Development Community (SADC), declared the pre-election and voting phases had been well organised and conducted in a \"peaceful and free atmosphere\".\n\nDespite numerous opposition party disputes, SADC observers have endorsed elections in Malawi, Zimbabwe and Mozambique in recent years, declaring them all to be free and fair.", "description": "Incumbent president Mokgweetsi Masisi on Friday won a five-year term in Botswana's elections which saw his ruling party secure more than 51 percent of parliamentary votes, the chief justice said.  \"Dr. Mokgweetsi Eric Keabetswe Masisi is elected President of the Republic of Botswana,\" chief", "authors": ["Onalenna Dube"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/vqytkmSBDmoKqzFLlnvXaw--~B/aD01MTI7dz03Njg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_sg/News/AFP/d47fa5975443e53df3e57d138d8e46e49e124d97.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
