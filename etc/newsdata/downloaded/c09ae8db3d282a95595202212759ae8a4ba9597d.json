The arrests come two years after the club was fined and ordered to play a match with one of the main sections of its stadium closed for selling tickets to \u201cultras\u201d and encouraging scalping.\n\nJuventus president Andrea Agnelli was fined for the sales to \u201cultras,\u201d but his one-year ban was lifted by an Italian soccer federation appeals court in December, 2017.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Police have arrested 12 hardcore Juventus \"ultra\" fan leaders for a series of accusations, including making illegal demands to the club to obtain more tickets.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/16/italy_juventus_fans_arrested_03314_c0-185-4254-2665_s1770x1032.jpg?a23776567db0b02dde735892f946c9b1eb949a6f", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
