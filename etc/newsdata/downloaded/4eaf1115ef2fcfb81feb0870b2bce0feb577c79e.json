These negotiations that he\u2019s talking about are a sham. All he\u2019s doing is running down the clock.\u201d\n\nJohnson repeatedly taunted the Labour leader over backing an election: \u201cI know he\u2019s worried about free-trade deals with America, but there\u2019s only one chlorinated chicken that I can see in his house, and he\u2019s on that bench.\u201d\n\nThe government has tabled a motion under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act seeking a poll next month, but it needs a two-thirds Commons majority to pass, requiring opposition support. Labour has said it will not back the plan on Wednesday, as it first wants a guarantee that a no-deal Brexit will not take place.\n\nPMQs verdict: Johnson resorts to machismo and cheap jibes Read more\n\nThe backbench bill to delay the UK\u2019s departure from the EU until at least 31 January will also be debated by MPs on Wednesday, before heading to the Lords.\n\nJohnson repeatedly referred to it as a \u201csurrender bill\u201d, a No 10-devised populist term intended to draw attention to the fact that the EU can mandate an alternative extension date \u2013 albeit only with the approval of the Commons.\n\nHe reiterated his charge that in backing the bill Labour was undermining the government\u2019s Brexit negotiating position. Corbyn responded: \u201cI really fail to see how I can be accused of undermining negotiations, because no negotiations are taking place.\u201d\n\nIn his questioning, Corbyn repeatedly sought details of what, if any, new proposals Johnson and his team had presented to Brussels to seek a revised Brexit deal, particularly over a replacement for the backstop insurance policy for the Irish border.\n\n\u201cIf the prime minister thinks he\u2019s making progress, will he publish those proposals he\u2019s put forward to replace the backstop?\u201d Corbyn asked. Johnson replied, prompting Labour jeers: \u201cAs the right honourable gentleman knows very well, we don\u2019t negotiate in public and we are making substantial progress.\u201d\n\nCorbyn also pushed Johnson to publish the government\u2019s official predictions on the impact of no deal, saying the public had the right to know about likely food price increases and medicine shortages.\n\nJohnson replied: \u201cI\u2019m afraid that the right honourable gentleman is guilty of the most shameless scaremongering. We have made ample preparations for coming out of the EU. What his party is recommending is yet more dither, yet more delay, yet more uncertainty for business.\u201d\n\nCorbyn said: \u201cIn his third day in office, after five questions from me, we haven\u2019t had an answer to any of them. I can see why he\u2019s desperate to avoid scrutiny. He has no plan to get a new deal, no authority and no majority.\n\n\u201cIf the prime minister does to the country what he has done to his party in the past 24 hours, I think a lot of people have a great deal to fear from his incompetence, his vacillation, and his refusal to publish facts that are known to him about the effects of a no-deal Brexit.\u201d\n\nJohnson replied: \u201cI really don\u2019t see how, with a straight face, the right honourable gentleman can accuse anybody of being unwilling to stand up to scrutiny when he will not agree to submit his surrender bill to the verdict of the people in an election. He\u2019s frightened.\u201d", "description": "Prime minister accuses Labour leader of running scared of a snap election in pair\u2019s first PMQ clash", "authors": ["Peter Walker"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ac51f36853649aeb7528a065eb272abf2a2e01e/0_253_5334_3200/master/5334.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=963344bc242897a49dfb9518d4ebfd40"}
