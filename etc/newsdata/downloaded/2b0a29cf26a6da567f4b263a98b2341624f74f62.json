Photo-Illustration: by Stevie Remsberg; Source Imagery: New York Public Library\n\nDoing the Most \ufeffis a special series about ambition \u2014 how we define it, harness it, and conquer it.\n\nIt\u2019s fascinating how mundane places, objects, and habits can inspire ideas that eventually shape our cultural landscape. Below, 25 famous women including J.K. Rowling, Toni Morrison, and Taylor Swift discuss the rituals that get their creative juices flowing \u2014 from people-watching on the subway to certain types of tea.\n\n1) J.K. Rowling\n\n\u201cI try to start work before 9 a.m. My writing room is probably my favorite place in the world. It\u2019s in the garden, about a minute\u2019s walk from the house. There\u2019s a central room where I work, a kettle, a sink, and a cupboard-sized bathroom. The radio is usually tuned to classical music, because I find human voices the most distracting when I\u2019m working, although a background buzz, as in a caf\u00e9, is always comforting. I used to love writing in caf\u00e9s and gave it up reluctantly, but part of the point of being alone in a crowd was being happily anonymous and free to people-watch, and when you\u2019re the one being watched, you become too self-conscious to work.\u201d \u2014 her website\n\n2) Taylor Swift\n\n\u201cThere are definitely moments when it\u2019s like this cloud of an idea comes and just lands in front of your face, and you reach up and grab it. A lot of songwriting is things you learn, structure, and cultivating that skill, and knowing how to craft a song. But there are mystical, magical moments, inexplicable moments when an idea that is fully formed just pops into your head. And that\u2019s the purest part of my job. It can get complicated on every other level, but the songwriting is still the same uncomplicated process it was when I was 12 years old writing songs in my room.\u201d \u2014 Harper\u2019s Bazaar, July 2018\n\n3) Marie Kondo\n\n\u201cI drink multiple cups of tea a day \u2026 After I\u2019ve accomplished a few things or start to feel tired, I\u2019ll get up and make another cup. I probably have about 15 different kinds of tea in my cupboard at any given time. I usually have herb tea when I wake up in the morning, green tea with breakfast, black tea in the afternoon, and herb tea again in the evening.\u201d \u2014 The Cut, March 2018\n\n4) Maya Angelou\n\n\u201cI do still keep a hotel room in my hometown, and pay for it by the month. I go around 6:30 in the morning. I have a bedroom, with a bed, a table, and a bath. I have Roget\u2019s Thesaurus, a dictionary, and the Bible \u2026 I have all the paintings and any decoration taken out of the room. I ask the management and housekeeping not to enter the room, just in case I\u2019ve thrown a piece of paper on the floor, I don\u2019t want it discarded. About every two months I get a note slipped under the door: \u2018Dear Ms. Angelou, please let us change the linen. We think it may be moldy!\u2019 But I\u2019ve never slept there, I\u2019m usually out of there by 2. And then I go home and I read what I\u2019ve written that morning, and I try to edit then. Clean it up. And that\u2019s how I write books!\u201d \u2014 The Daily Beast, April 2013\n\n5) Whitney Wolfe Herd\n\n\u201cI really try to ask myself the question of nine. Will this matter in nine minutes, nine hours, nine days, nine weeks, nine months, or nine years? If it will truly matter for all of those, pay attention to it. If it isn\u2019t going to matter in nine minutes, nine hours, or nine days from now, you need to not pay attention to it. I think it\u2019s extremely easy to become distracted by noise, by things that might upset us or set us off track.\u201d \u2014 Entrepreneur, June 2017\n\n6) Donatella Versace\n\n\u201cWell, my muse changes all the time because I think every designer is a bit of a muse for themselves in a way \u2014 they just don\u2019t want to say it \u2026 But as a designer, you always take facets of different people and you mix them together with your own thoughts and information and creativity and passion \u2014 because I think fashion has a lot to do with passion \u2014 and that\u2019s where you get your inspiration.\u201d \u2014 Interview, November 2011\n\n7) Reese Witherspoon\n\n\u201cI think incubating the idea, then writing a business plan are really important. If you\u2019re a creative, find a business person. If you\u2019re a business person, find a creative. It\u2019s the blend of the two that creates success, and the two of you will sort of police each other and beat [the idea] out pragmatically. I started as the creative and have now become more of the business person, and my business partner has become more of the creative.\u201d \u2014 Man Repeller, December 2017\n\n8) Hannah Gadsby\n\n\u201cI generally take all the things that have been preoccupying my thoughts and there\u2019s usually more than I can poke a stick at \u2026 I just sort of start writing them down and seeing how they connect. But really, my stand-up shows get written \u2014 I do a fair bit of mucking about on the page, but they really are written onstage. An audience is the best editor, for comedy.\u201d \u2014 Seattle Pi, June 2019\n\n9) Amy Poehler\n\n\u201cWhat I have discovered is this: You can\u2019t do it alone. As you navigate through the rest of your life, be open to collaboration. Other people and other people\u2019s ideas are often better than your own. Find a group of people who challenge and inspire you, spend a lot of time with them, and it will change your life.\u201d \u2014 Harvard Class Day Speech, May 2011\n\nI can just get lost in a Pinterest hole and not be heard from for hours. \u2014 Audrey Gelman\n\n10) Audrey Gelman\n\n\u201cWe do a lot of work and concepting on Pinterest. I can just get lost in a Pinterest hole and not be heard from for hours. Also our members, honestly \u2014 we have such a dynamic, rich, interesting group of women who are a part of the Wing. Having a coffee with a member and picking their brain about things they want to see us do, and then going back to the office to figure out what of those things is possible and what would be the steps we\u2019d need to take to do it? That\u2019s a big, ripe, fertile area of inspiration for me. I respond to every email from members and spend a lot of time in face-to-face interactions with them.\u201d \u2014 The Cut, April 2019\n\n11) Erykah Badu\n\n\u201cMusic is what brings it out of me. I\u2019ve never written lyrics without music \u2014 that would be poetry. It\u2019s the music first, then I hum in a rhythmic, syncopated way. The next part is listening to it and decoding what I\u2019m saying. It\u2019s almost like a lump of clay and carving away at it, revealing what\u2019s under it.\u201d \u2014 Vulture, March 2010\n\n12) Mindy Kaling\n\n\u201cI will never let myself now sit in front of a blank screen. I\u2019ll always sit down with an idea or something to say. Sometimes, I\u2019m scrambling to open it so I can get an idea down, because I hate the blank page so much.\u201d \u2014 Parade, June 2019\n\n13) Kate McKinnon\n\n\u201cSo many YouTube videos. Me, alone in my office, talking back to YouTube videos \u2026 I like to devise axioms and notice patterns of what works and what doesn\u2019t so I can codify those into little rules I can use. If someone has a vocal tic or an accent, it\u2019s so much easier to hook into something. It always starts with the way they talk, and then you add the layer of their energy.\u201d \u2014 Glamour, August 2018\n\n14) Carine Roitfeld\n\n\u201cLots of people, they feel anxious because they think I\u2019m judging them. No! I\u2019m just looking, observing what they\u2019re wearing, what they\u2019re doing, because my inspiration comes from the street, from other people. You know, I\u2019m just curious and I have a good sense of observation. And I can immediately transform this observation into ideas for fashion. That\u2019s always how I work. I\u2019m not going to books, I\u2019m not going to reference a vintage shop. I\u2019m not going to the past. I\u2019m most inspired by what\u2019s happening around me.\u201d \u2014 The Cut, June 2019\n\n15) Ilana Glazer\n\nOn weed: \u201cI guess it\u2019s a hit here and there for writing. Usually 80 percent of the day I\u2019m straight, and then by the end of the day I could use a \u2018mind plane change.\u2019 I\u2019ll take a little hit after lunch or something out the window of this midtown editing office \u2026 I go up and I\u2019m like \u2018Oh my god!\u2019 and then I come down and I\u2019m like \u2018Ah! I just had an experience, and now I can focus again and be still in this process that we have.\u2019 That\u2019s how it helps me in writing and editing.\u201d \u2014 The Verge, April 2016\n\n16) Dolly Parton\n\n\u201cMy favorite thing, if I have the time, is to take a couple weeks and take off and go somewhere to just write songs. That\u2019s not as apt to happen these days as it was in the past, but I can write songs anywhere. I always keep a notepad by my bed at night and a tape recorder. I\u2019ve always got a notepad everywhere. I do my best thinking when I\u2019m traveling. I can write anywhere, and I never know when a song is gonna hit me. I write a little bit of something every day. Either an idea or a title, a few lines. If I\u2019m lucky, I can write a few songs in a week.\u201d \u2014 Rookie, November 2017\n\n17) Toni Morrison\n\n\u201cI always get up and make a cup of coffee while it is still dark \u2014 it must be dark \u2014 and then I drink the coffee and watch the light come \u2026 Writers all devise ways to approach that place where they expect to make the contact, where they become the conduit, or where they engage in this mysterious process. For me, light is the signal in the transition. It\u2019s not being in the light, it\u2019s being there before it arrives. It enables me, in some sense.\u201d \u2015 The Paris Review, 1993\n\n18) Kristen Wiig\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t try to make jokes. You shouldn\u2019t try to be funny. Well, you shouldn\u2019t try try. Effortless comedy is what you want to go for \u2026 With the Groundlings, I learned how to collaborate, how to give and take. It\u2019s important to set other people up and make them look good. I learned what works by laughing at someone else\u2019s character and being like, \u2018Why is that funny to me?\u2019\u201d \u2014 Esquire, October 2017\n\n19) Jenny Han\n\n\u201cI still do my writing retreats, which I\u2019ve been doing my whole writing career. I rent a house and gather a bunch of writer friends together and go work. It\u2019s to get outside of my own everyday routine and immerse myself in the work.\u201d \u2014 Refinery29, April 2019\n\nI love going on the subway in the morning. There are so many wonderful people on the subway. \u2014 Grace Coddington\n\n20) Grace Coddington\n\n\u201cI think you have to live a little bit more in the moment and appreciate and see. It is what I\u2019ve always done in my life \u2014 just look at where I am. That\u2019s why I love going on the subway in the morning. There are so many wonderful people on the subway. I\u2019m often sad that I only live three stops away from the office in Times Square, because I\u2019m usually just working out who that crazy person is in the corner when I have to get off.\u201d \u2014 Interview, November 2012\n\n21) Judy Blume\n\n\u201cIdeas seem to come from everywhere \u2014 my life, everything I see, hear, and read, and most of all, from my imagination. I have a LOT of imagination \u2026 I keep a notebook and jot down everything that comes to mind about characters and places and anything else. That notebook is my security blanket. That way I never feel alone with a blank page or a blank screen \u2026 Observe. Make notes. Listen carefully. Listen to how people talk to one another. A good writer is always a people-watcher.\u201d \u2014 Scholastic\n\n22) Phoebe Waller-Bridge\n\n\u201c[At the end of Fleabag] I was like, \u2018God, it\u2019s been amazing, but I\u2019m never going to have another idea,\u2019 and then I went to sleep. I woke up and I had this idea for this movie in my head \u2026 I\u2019ll be in the shower and suddenly it\u2019ll be like, \u2018I should go and write that down.\u2019 It\u2019s very strange, which probably means it\u2019s going to be awful.\u201d \u2014 Deadline, June 2019\n\n23) Shonda Rhimes\n\n\u201cI never put pen to paper to write the script or book or anything until I really know what I\u2019m going to write. And then the writing is quick: Sometimes it can take a year of me thinking, and I can then write a script in three days. \u2018It\u2019s never, I took six months to write this script, or I took six months to write this book.\u2019 It\u2019s all happening inside my brain \u2026 There\u2019s a moment when I can\u2019t not talk about it anymore. I can\u2019t not write about it anymore. I\u2019m sitting in story meetings for other things, thinking, why am I talking about this when I should be talking about that. My brain is just excited to tell that story.\u201d \u2013 Thrive Global, November 2017\n\n24) Annie Leibovitz\n\n\u201cI do my homework. When I was preparing to photograph Carla Bruni, the wife of Nicolas Sarkozy, the president of France, in the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, I looked at pictures of the palace. I looked at pictures of other people who had lived in the palace. Pictures of couples in love. Pictures that other photographers had taken of Bruni. She had been photographed many times before. I thought Helmut Newton had seen something in her that other photographers hadn\u2019t. I knew she was a popular musician, and I listened to her music.\u201d \u2014 Artspace, January 2019\n\n25) Elizabeth Gilbert\n\n\u201cMy life is divided into times when I\u2019m actively writing a book and times when I\u2019m not. I\u2019m only actively writing a book once every three or four years, and when I am, my day is very simple. I get up at 4:30 or 5 a.m. and I write nonstop until midmorning. Then I spend the rest of the day staring at a wall because my brain is like a fried egg. I\u2019ll have an early dinner and an early bedtime, by 7 or 8 p.m., and I\u2019ll do it again the next day and the next until the book\u2019s finished. It\u2019s a very militaristic thing, the early hours. But I really want to be uninterrupted and the world doesn\u2019t wake up in a way that bothers you till about 9 a.m. That\u2019s when the phone starts ringing, emails and texts start coming in. If you can get a four-hour jump on that, it\u2019s incredible how productive that time is.\u201d \u2014 The Cut, May 2019\n\nStay in touch.
