Publicly, politically run for president. And keep going. Just get up every day and keep going,\" Clinton said.\n\nIn response to the question, Chelsea said, \"I think I\u2019m so overwhelmed by my mother\u2019s answer that I\u2019m a bit out of words,\" and now that she is a mother of three, she tries to be a \"gusty\" woman every day.\n\nIn an essay for Vanity Fair published in 2018, Lewinsky wrote how she wanted to apologize to Clinton for her role in the extramarital affair.\n\n\"My first public words after the scandal \u2014 uttered in an interview with Barbara Walters on March 3, 1999 \u2014were an apology directly to Chelsea and Mrs. Clinton,\" she wrote. \"And if I were to see Hillary Clinton in person today, I know that I would summon up whatever force I needed to again acknowledge to her \u2014 sincerely \u2014 how very sorry I am. I know I would do this, because I have done it in other difficult situations related to 1998. I have also written letters apologizing to others\u2014including some who also wronged me gravely.\"\n\nJuanita Broaddrick, who has accused Bill Clinton of raping her in 1978 when he was Arkansas' Attorney General, tweeted how it is actually \"GUTLESS\" to stay married to a \"rapist.\" Clinton has denied the accusation.", "description": ".10/01/2019 20:33:54PM EST.", "authors": ["Julio Rosas", "Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa", "Cortney O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/images/2019/274/98437835-a962-4d91-8c30-ad28656ec0cb.png", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
