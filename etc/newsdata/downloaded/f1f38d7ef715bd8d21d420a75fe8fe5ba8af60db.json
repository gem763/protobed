But the US Congress has resisted pressure in recent years by activists out of a desire not to inflame tensions with a Nato ally. Support for a resolution grew, particularly among Democrats, after Trump enabled the Turkish offensive against the Kurdish groups.\n\nThe US had previously allied with Syrian Kurdish forces against militants of the Islamic State group. The Turkish offensive left scores of Kurdish fighters and civilians dead and displaced hundreds of thousands more.\n\n\u201cIf we ignore history, then we are destined to witness the mistakes of the past be repeated,\u201d the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, said, urging support for the resolution on Tuesday. \u201cRecent attacks by the Turkish military against the Kurdish people are a stark reminder of the danger in our own time.\u201d\n\nThe California Democrat Adam Schiff, a sponsor of the resolution, said in a statement: \u201cThe House declared that it will no longer be party to the cause of genocide denial. This is a vote I have fought for 19 years to make possible, and one that tens of thousands of my Armenian American constituents have worked, struggled, and prayed for decades to see.\u201d\n\nThe vote on the bipartisan resolution came on the heels of House passage of economic sanctions against Turkey.\n\nThere is a bipartisan resolution in the Senate but it is unclear if the chamber will bring the measure to the floor.\n\nIn a statement, the Turkish foreign minister, Mevl\u00fct \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu, condemned the move, which he called \u201ca meaningless political step\u201d and an \u201cattempt to rewrite history\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe US Administration and politicians as well as the American people are best placed to consider the damages this resolution seeking to disrupt Turkey-US ties does and will inflict upon the US interests at an extremely fragile time in terms of the international and regional security,\u201d the statement said, adding: \u201cUndoubtedly, this resolution will negatively affect the image of the US before the public opinion of Turkey as it also brings the dignity of the US House of Representatives into disrepute.\u201d", "description": "Resolution comes at delicate time in US-Turkey relationship, shortly after House votes to impose sanctionsPeople take part in a torchlight procession as they mark the 104th anniversary of the killing of 1.5 million Armenians by Ottoman forces, Yerevan, Armenia.
