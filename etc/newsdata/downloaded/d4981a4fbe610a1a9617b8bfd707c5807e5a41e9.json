But she was very choosy in inviting people here, so only a few were aware of her secret passion.\n\n\u2018She never played for money, she played for diamonds. And they were not just any diamonds but pure water diamonds, the best.\u2019 The expression water diamonds dates back to medieval times when jewellers would drop a diamond into a glass of water to see if they could see any flaws.\n\n\u2018The players would sit around the table, the bowl with diamonds would be in the centre, and the winner would get a few diamonds,\u2019 our guide continued. \u2018At the end of the game, whatever was left in the bowl would be shared equally. So even when you lost, you won.\u2019\n\nStairway to heaven: Inside St Petersburg's lavishly decorated Winter Palace, above\n\nClaudia's ship went through 17 locks \u2013 'the scariest was 58ft wide, barely 3ft more than the ship' \u2013 and crossed the largest lake in Europe, Lake Ladoga (pictured)\n\nSo I was following in illustrious footsteps when I walked through the hallowed halls of the famous Winter Palace and Hermitage art galleries, overlooking the River Neva, which have become the legacy of the woman who ruled Russia for 34 years and became its most prolific art collector. She sent emissaries across Europe to scout for artworks for what is now the second-largest museum in the world. \u2018As far as art is concerned, I\u2019m not an amateur, I am a glutton,\u2019 she once said.\n\nThe Hermitage was one of the highlights of my trip to Russia on Viking Akun.\n\nI was one of 204 passengers on Viking\u2019s 13-day trip along the Waterways Of The Tsars, which sails from Moscow to St Petersburg, and I could not wait to find out more about the woman, played by Helen Mirren in the forthcoming Sky mini-series Catherine The Great.\n\n\u2018I am very excited to embody a woman from history who grabbed and then wielded great power,\u2019 the actress has said. \u2018She rewrote the rules of governance by a woman.\u2019\n\nCrown jewels: Russia's glittering Imperial Crown\n\nOur cruise began in Moscow, a city described by my guide as \u2018an architectural salad of styles\u2019. It did not disappoint. Not only did I visit Red Square, home to Lenin\u2019s Mausoleum, travel on the Metro (one of the most beautiful in the world) and to the GUM shopping mall (as opulent as Fortnum & Mason) but I dined at the Grand Cafe Dr Zhivago, a gastronomic hotspot \u2013 the crab dumplings, mushroom pierogi and chicken Kiev were exquisite.\n\nHowever, no trip to Moscow would be complete without a visit to the Kremlin\u2019s Armoury, which houses Russia\u2019s Imperial Crown: it is a must for fans of the Tower of London\u2019s Crown Jewels.\n\nFirst used by Catherine the Great at her coronation, the crown was worn by every Emperor until Nicholas II, the cousin of King George V, who was executed by the Bolsheviks in 1918.\n\nBut, although the jewels were spectacular, it was the fashion which caught my eye \u2013 the museum contains Catherine\u2019s wedding dress and her coronation gown, both of which I coveted \u2013 although it was pointed out that they would be unlikely to fit me.\n\n\u2018When she came to Russia [she was born in what is now Germany] she was only 15 years old,\u2019 said my guide, \u2018and her waist was 18in. But she loved living in Russia and really enjoyed her food. By the time of the coronation, her waistline had expanded.\u2019\n\nYou cannot fail to put on weight on a Viking cruise and by the time I stepped off the ship 13 days later, I was as rotund as the late empress, who lived on beluga sturgeon, saut\u00e9ed cuckoo, nightingale tongue, elk lips and hedgehog liver.\n\nA forthcoming Sky miniseries will focus on Catherine the Great, pictured here in her coronation robes\n\nI could not find any of those 18th Century delicacies on Viking Akun, but I worked up quite an appetite as we wound our way from Moscow to St Petersburg, stopping off at villages along the way. As well as sampling the buffet and three-course lunch and dinner menus, I tasted many Russian specialities such as borscht soup (a beef broth with beets, carrots and sour cream), stolichni (salted herring) salad, mushroom blinis with a truffle cream sauce, salmon gravlax and beef stroganoff. I even learned to make pelmeni dumplings with the obligatory smetana sour cream.\n\nNeedless to say, we had many a glass of vodka and the drinking toast \u2018nostrovia\u2019 rang out daily in one of the ship\u2019s two bars.\n\nSo, with a glass in hand, I gazed out of the window as we sailed 1,100 miles along the Moscow Canal, down the Volga River and into the Volga-Baltic Canal.\n\nWe went through 17 locks \u2013 the scariest was 58ft wide, barely 3ft more than the ship \u2013 sailed past belfries and churches, and crossed the largest lake in Europe, Lake Ladoga.\n\nBut it was the Cathedral of Our Saviour\u2019s Transformation that I found most surprising with its nudes of Adam and Eve on the walls.\n\n\u2018This church was built during the reign of Catherine II where liberty came everywhere,\u2019 said our guide.\n\nFinally we arrived in St Petersburg. There I joined Viking\u2019s \u2018privileged access tour\u2019 of The Hermitage Behind Closed Doors, which included a visit to the palace, before it opened to the masses, and a tour of the storage facilities, which houses the Hermitage\u2019s \u2018most beautiful\u2019 works of art.\n\nWho says that gluttony doesn\u2019t pay?", "description": "Viking's Waterways of the Tsars cruise travels from Moscow to St Petersburg, sailing past belfries and churches and crossing the largest lake in Europe, Lake Ladoga.
