His favorite target was Fuller, who had a career-high 217 yards receiving to more than double his output from the first four games combined on Sunday after entering the day with 183 yards receiving.\n\nA frustrated Quinn seemed as if he might consider personnel changes after his team\u2019s performance on Sunday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll obviously look into everything in terms of how we played,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no excuse for having a performance like that.\u201d\n\nHouston got things going in the second half when Watson hit Keke Coutee on a 51-yard catch-and-run. The Texans regained the lead four plays later when Carlos Hyde scored on a 1-yard run to make it 23-17.\n\nThe Texans tacked on a field goal later in the third before Darren Fells caught an 8-yard touchdown pass from Watson to extend the lead to 33-17. Watson completed two long throws on that drive, finding Fuller for a 32-yard gain before connecting with DeAndre Hopkins for 29 yards.\n\nSafety Ricardo Allen said everyone on the defense needs to be better to turn things around.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been inconsistent,\u201d he said of their play. \u201cIt just wasn\u2019t good. It wasn\u2019t good at all.\u201d\n\nDeAndre Carter muffed a punt on the first play of the fourth quarter and it was recovered by Atlanta.\n\nThe Falcons cashed in on that mistake when Matt Ryan crashed into the end zone for a 1-yard score with about 11\u00bd minutes left. It was first ruled that he fumbled, but it was reviewed and determined that Ryan got into the end zone before fumbling to give Atlanta the touchdown. Ryan found Austin Hooper for the 2-point conversion to cut the lead to 33-25.\n\nAtlanta cut the lead to eight points with about 11\u00bd minutes to go before Watson\u2019s second TD pass to Fells pushed the lead to 40-25 about five minutes later.\n\nThe Falcons cut the lead to one score again with 3\u00bd minutes left when Ryan threw a 29-yard pass to Calvin Ridley to get them within 40-32. But Watson and Fuller struck again, with Fuller grabbing a 44-yard touchdown reception to make it 47-32 with about two minutes remaining.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a number of reasons why we haven\u2019t played as well as we should,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cI think everybody needs to take a look in the mirror and take ownership for what you\u2019re doing. That\u2019s a good way for all of us to improve, collectively.\u201d\n\nThe Texans added another score when Tashaun Gipson returned an interception 79 yards for a touchdown in the final minute.\n\n\u201cThat was a tough one,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cTo sit here 1-4 after five games is difficult. It\u2019s not what we wanted, but we\u2019re going to be the ones to have to dig ourselves out of it.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Atlanta's secondary couldn't do anything to contain Houston's Deshaun Watson on Sunday as the third-year quarterback finished with as many touchdown passes as incompletions to send the Falcons to yet another loss.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Kristie Rieken"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/06/falcons_texans_football_84811_c0-106-2541-1587_s1770x1032.jpg?bf579ca26faa8d76e0c083c5cf572e960ef76198", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
