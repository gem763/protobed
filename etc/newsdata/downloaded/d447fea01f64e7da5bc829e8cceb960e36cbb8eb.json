Now that the wartime portion of Trump's presidency is in full swing, the lack of any established process will prove even more damaging. And that's especially true as the president begins to layer a $US1 billion ($1.5 billion) reelection campaign on top of his impeachment-minded White House.\n\nImpeachment owns you, all day long.\n\nNor is there a lot of legal brainpower on call. While impeachment is, at its core, largely a political battle, you cannot win without a sound legal strategy. Trump has nothing like that, beyond the idea of just stonewalling Congress, outlined last week in the letter by White House counsel Pat Cipollone. But he needs one. His lawyers are disappearing: Michael Cohen was sentenced to three years in jail late in 2018. Another, Rudy Giuliani, is reportedly now under federal investigation. It is no wonder that there is talk of bringing back Emmet Flood, who helped Trump through the investigation conducted by special counsel Robert Mueller. The President could use a legal grown-up in the West Wing.\n\nDonald Trump is entering a world where new facts come out every day, weakening his position. Bloomberg\n\nIt is probably difficult to imagine this, but when you are in the middle of impeachment, most of the White House staff has only the thinnest understanding of the facts of the case. Yes, the lawyers might know the whole story, or large parts of it. But\n\nthe people who make the presidency work day to day know little more about the real facts of the case than the rest of the country. As Clinton aides, we learned to trust but verify everything we were told. Nothing was ever what it initially appeared to be. We only found out what Clinton was going to say to the grand jury an hour or two before he appeared in August 1998.\n\nAs we go deeper into the impeachment process, the interests of the vice president, current and former Cabinet officials, as well as those of Trump's outside advisers and political allies, will be increasingly at odds with those of the president. We are already seeing these splits becoming public.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll this means that Trump's control of his own destiny is decreasing. He is entering a world where new facts come out every day, weakening his position. The law of unintended political consequences takes over; the more he tries to control events with a tactical, day-trader approach, the more likely the opposite will occur.\n\nIn this environment, Trump is now dependent on others for his political survival. And this is not the environment that a sitting president wants when beginning his reelection campaign.\n\nDoug Sosnic, a Democratic political strategist, was a senior adviser to President Bill Clinton from 1994 to 2000.\n\nWashington Post", "description": "When you are in the middle of impeachment, most of the White House staff has only the thinnest understanding of the facts of the case.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1964%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/08a3676cb376cc0871b76b8dbb3d9364dfdecd69", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
