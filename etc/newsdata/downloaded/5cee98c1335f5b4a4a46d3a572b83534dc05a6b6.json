USA TODAY\n\nA man in China has been arrested after he threatened to burn the national flag on social media while wearing a Houston Rockets jersey, according to reports.\n\nHoward Wang, 25, was taken into custody Tuesday and is accused of publishing \"insults directed against the national flag\" on Weibo, which is China's version of Twitter, on Sunday, according to CNN, which cited authorities. The arrest comes amid a week of fractured relations between the NBA and China, due to a tweet from Rockets general manager Daryl Morey that expressed support for human rights protests in Hong Kong, which are considered anti-government. (Morey later deleted the tweet and offered an apology).\n\nThe post includes Wang with a photo of himself appearing on the verge of burning the flag, with the caption \"I live and die with the team.\" According to CNN, Wang told police to \"come and arrest him.\" Flag desecration is illegal in China and violators could face up to three years in prison. Comments reacting to his post included, \"He has committed crime of splitting the state, he deserves a life sentence, he will keep creating troubles to society.\"\n\nOPINION: It's time for LeBron James to speak out on China, regardless of Nike ties\n\nA 25-year-old Houston Rockets fan in China was arrested after threatening to burn the Chinese flag in protest at the ongoing dispute between Beijing and the NBA team https://t.co/EMBOXsduqD \u2014 CNN (@CNN) October 9, 2019\n\nThe controversy has led to the possible cancellation of preseason games in China, with the media sessions for the Brooklyn Nets and Los Angeles Lakers already postponed.
