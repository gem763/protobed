Yet the scandal\u2019s fallout may be limited in a country without the harsh and still-divisive racial history of the neighboring United States.\n\n\u201cI hurt people who in many cases consider me an ally,\u201d Trudeau told a news conference Friday. \u201cI let a lot of people down.\u201d\n\nTrudeau, 47, is seeking a second term as prime minister in an Oct. 21 election. His leading opponent, Andrew Scheer of the Conservative Party, has assailed him as \u201cnot fit to govern\u201d because of the revelations. But key figures in the prime minister\u2019s Liberal Party have stuck by him, including Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, who would be a favorite to replace Trudeau as Liberal leader if he lost the election.\n\nMany minority Canadians, increasingly active in politics and government, seem ready to forgive Trudeau.\n\n\u201cAs I have gotten to know Justin, I know these photos do not represent the person he is now, and I know how much he regrets it,\u201d Defense Minister Harjit Sajjan, a Sikh, said on Twitter.\n\nNelson Wiseman, a political science professor at the University of Toronto, predicted Trudeau would easily weather the scandal.\n\n\u201cIndeed, I think he is drawing some sympathy,\u201d Wiseman said. \u201cThis affair is a media bombshell that is bombing with the public \u2026 The international media love this story because it goes against type.\u201d\n\nWiseman also disputed the assertion that Trudeau is a hypocrite when it comes to race and diversity, noting that his cabinet is the most diverse in Canadian history in terms of gender and ethnic background.\n\nTrudeau\u2019s brownface controversy has drawn some comparisons with developments earlier this year in the U.S., where Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam withstood intense pressure to resign after a racist picture surfaced from his 1984 medical school yearbook.\n\nQuentin Kidd, a political science professor at Virginia\u2019s Christopher Newport University, said the revelations were \u201ca shock and disappointment\u201d to supporters of both Trudeau and Northam, whom they viewed as compassionate politicians.\n\nHowever, Kidd sees big differences in how the two politicians handled the situation.\n\n\u201cTrudeau has expressed genuine contrition and willingness to accept what he did as racist,\u201d Kidd said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen that from Ralph Northam.\u201d\n\nKidd also cited the divergent racial histories of the two countries.\n\n\u201cCanada has its issues dealing with racial inequities, but nothing like the American South. There\u2019s no legacy of slavery, of Jim Crow or huge gaps in wealth and poverty,\u201d he said. \u201cNortham has to carry the baggage of that history, whereas Trudeau doesn\u2019t have to carry similar baggage.\u201d\n\nAccording to recent census figures, Canada\u2019s population is about 73% white, compared with 77% in the U.S. Many of the nonwhites in Canada are from Asia. Only about 3.5 percent of the population is black.\n\nIn Trudeau\u2019s multiethnic parliamentary district in Montreal, some residents questioned about the scandal offered a collective shrug.\n\n\u201cIt was no big deal, it was a long time ago,\u201d said Zahid Nassar, an immigrant from Pakistan. \u201cWhen we\u2019re young, we all do stupid things.\u201d\n\nNassar said he voted for Trudeau in 2015 and will likely do the same next month. If he does not, he said, it will be because he\u2019s worried about safety in his neighborhood.\n\nThe brownface controversy surfaced Wednesday when Time magazine published a photo from a yearbook from the West Point Grey Academy, a private school in British Columbia where Trudeau worked as a teacher. It shows the then-29-year-old Trudeau at an \u201cArabian Nights\u201d party in 2001 wearing a turban and robe with dark makeup on his hands, face and neck. Trudeau said he was dressed as a character from \u201cAladdin.\u201d\n\nTrudeau said he also once darkened his face for a performance of a Harry Belafonte song during a talent show when he was in high school. In a third incident, a brief video surfaced of Trudeau in blackface. He said it was taken on a costume day while he was working as guide for a river rafting company.\n\n\u201cI have been forthright about the incidents that I remembered,\u201d he said Friday. \u201cI did not realize at the time how much this hurt minority Canadians, racialized Canadians.\u201d\n\nSunny Khurana, who was photographed with Trudeau for the 2001 yearbook, said no one had a problem with Trudeau\u2019s get-up at the event.\n\n\u201cIt was a costume party, Arabian nights, Aladdin,\u201d said Khurana, a Sikh Indian who had two children at the school at the time. \u201cThat\u2019s it. People dress up. It was a party. It was never meant to put down anybody.\u201d\n\nIn Washington, U.S. President Donald Trump was asked by a reporter about the Trudeau controversy.\n\n\u201cI was hoping I wouldn\u2019t be asked that question,\u201d Trump replied. \u201cI\u2019m surprised. And I was more surprised when I saw the number of times.\u201d\n\nTrudeau later asked if his standing internationally is damaged.\n\n\u201cMy focus is Canadians who face discrimination every day,\u201d he replied. \u201cI\u2019m going to work very hard to demonstrate as an individual and as a leader I will continue to stand against intolerance and racism.\u201d\n\nTrudeau said he would call the leader of the opposition New Democrat party, Jagmeet Singh, and apologize for wearing brownface. Singh is also a Sikh.\n\nAs for Trudeau\u2019s main election rival, his denunciation of the prime minister was undercut by comments he made shortly before the brownface photo surfaced. Scheer said he would stand by other Conservative candidates who had made racist or anti-gay comments in the past, as long as they apologized and took responsibility for those remarks.\n\n\u201cI accept the fact that people make mistakes in the past and can own up to that and accept that,\u201d Scheer said. \u201cI believe many Canadians, most Canadians, recognize that people can say things in the past, when they\u2019re younger, at a different time in their life, that they would not say today.\u201d\n\n___\n\nCrary reported from New York.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau acknowledged that he let down his supporters - and all Canadians of color - by appearing years ago in brownface and blackface.
