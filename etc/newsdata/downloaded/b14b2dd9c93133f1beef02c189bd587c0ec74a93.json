A previous version of this video misidentified Jenna Dewan. USA TODAY\n\nJenna Dewan is reflecting on her devastating 2018 split from Channing Tatum.\n\nThe dancer/actress, who is expecting a baby with her actor/singer boyfriend Steve Kazee, opened up to People magazine about the ending of her marriage. The former couple met while filming the 2006 feature \"Step Up.\"\n\n\u201cI always say no one gets married to hopefully get divorced,\u201d Dewan, 38, said. \u201cPeople grow and they change and sometimes they don\u2019t grow and change together. So it wasn\u2019t a overnight thing that happened.\"\n\n\"There was no one event,\" she added. \"I think it was just a slow realization that we wanted different things.\u201d\n\nStill, their decision to separate was agonizing for Dewan.\n\n\u201cI was just gutted. It was so difficult for me,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was the loss of an idealistic future for myself and my life. What does that now look like for me? Where do I begin? I met him when I was 24, I didn\u2019t know life without Chan.\u201d\n\nJenna Dewan and boyfriend Steve Kazee are expecting first child 17 months after Channing Tatum split\n\nJenna Dewan shows off baby bump, calls dad-to-be Steve Kazee a 'gift from above'\n\nChanning Tatum and Jenna Dewan in London in 2015.

I\u2019m in a place of joy,\u201d she said.\n\nDewan admitted \"it wasn\u2019t easy necessarily, to get here,\" and that she \"had to put in the work\" to get to where she is today.\n\n\"This doesn\u2019t just happen overnight,\" she said. \"But just to know that it\u2019s possible, and your perspective on life can change. It can change for the better, and you\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\n\nLast month, Dewan shared her excitement about her current stage in life with her Instagram followers.\n\nCuddled up next to Everly, with a tiny bump visible, Dewan raved about motherhood.\n\n\"Becoming a mother is quite simply the absolute best most incredible thing that has ever happened to me,\" she wrote. @stevekazee you are a gift from above and i couldn\u2019t be more excited to be expanding our family together...!
