I want him to be facing the goal, I want to be direct and attacking quickly, so at the moment I see him coming in off the left or as part of a two up front.\n\n\u2018Marcus\u2019 movement is great, but maybe we just need to give him a game or two of rest because he\u2019s played a lot. Sometimes, because he\u2019s a young boy with lots of expectations on his shoulders, he\u2019s played four or five seasons now, and yet he\u2019s still not even 22 yet.\n\n\u2018He\u2019s a scorer of great goals, as he did for England. I want him to become a great goalscorer \u2013 and that\u2019s a different mentality. At the moment, he\u2019s learning his trade.\u2019\n\nRashford has scored three goals in the Premier League so far this season and netted for England in the 6-0 win over Bulgaria earlier this week.\n\nThe discussion over his best position arose again ahead of the clash with Liverpool at Old Trafford on Sunday afternoon when he lined up with Andreas Perreira and Daniel James in a front three.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe trio were somewhat interchangeable, but Rashford did largely line-up on the left, James on the right and Perreira slightly behind, but through the middle.\n\nGary Neville concurred with the assessment of Mourinho during the match, commenting on Sky Sports: \u2018Playing as a central striker doesn\u2019t suit him [Rashford], he\u2019s better coming in from out wide, he\u2019s more free.\u2019\n\nMORE: Jose Mourinho wants a job \u2018like Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has got where you are protected\u2019\n\nMORE: Jose Mourinho rates Man Utd\u2019s chances against Liverpool and reacts to Mohamed Salah\u2019s absence", "description": "Former Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho does not believe Marcus Rashford should play as a central striker and is better suited to play on the left wing.
