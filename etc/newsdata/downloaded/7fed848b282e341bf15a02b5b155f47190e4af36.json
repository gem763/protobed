Photo: Jeff Kravitz/FilmMagic\n\nIn one of the best installments in recent years, the Comedy Central Roast of Alec Baldwin assembled a dais of Robert De Niro, Blake Griffin, Caitlyn Jenner, Chris Redd, Jeff Ross, Ken Jeong, Nikki Glaser, Caroline Rhea, and Adam Carolla, all under the helm of the evening\u2019s Roast Master Sean Hayes. Other than muting the word \u201ccunt\u201d on two occasions, the network seemed to censor very little as the cast punched up, down, left, and right while rarely losing any steam. Hayes deserves a lot of credit, as his composure was a biting blend of dignity and dirt that set the perfect tone for the proceedings.\n\nWith such a diverse cast, pretty much every joke category had an easy target. Considering recent news in the world of SNL casting, while listening to the jabs hurled at Sean Hayes, Ken Jeong, and Caitlyn Jenner I had to wonder if the line of what is and isn\u2019t appropriate is blurred when a charity is involved.\n\nBlake Griffin was an unexpected standout, and Caroline Rhea reminded us just how funny she can be. But the real star of the night was Robert De Niro, who sat cooly on the couch, squinting through most of the show, until it was his turn to take the mic and let loose.\n\nMost of the jokes aimed at Baldwin revolved around his temper, flickering career, and lack of healthy personal relationships with friends and family. The latter were the jokes that seemed to sting Baldwin the most, considering that he didn\u2019t have many friends or family in the crowd. The knife was twisted even further with a surprise, incredibly personal roast set from his daughter Ireland, of \u201cangry voicemail\u201d fame. But Alec Baldwin got not only the last laugh, but also the last song, as the show closed with he and Paul Anka performing a duet of \u201cMy Way.\u201d If you\u2019ve already read our recap of the taping and are looking for more, below are ten of the best burns from the roast.\n\nSean Hayes: \u201cAlec\u2019s true passion has always been the theater. Alec loves to hit the stage, because it can\u2019t press charges.\u201d\n\nNikki Glaser (to Blake Griffin): \u201cBlake, you look like a black guy that got made by a printer running out of ink.\u201d\n\nBlake Griffin: \u201cCaroline Rhea from Sabrina is here. Caroline, if you\u2019re here that means Salem the Cat must have turned this down, huh? Sorry Mr. De Niro, we know how much you love that black pussy.\u201d\n\nCaroline Rhea: \u201cAlec, where are your brothers tonight? God knows they\u2019re not working.\u201d\n\nChris Redd (to Caitlyn Jenner): \u201cYou did open the door for trans people. But then you ran in and slammed that shit shut right behind your flat ass.\u201d\n\nIreland Baldwin: \u201cA lot of people only know my dad as an angry guy, but he\u2019s more than some lunatic who loses his temper. He also loses Emmys and Oscars and custody of his first-born child, am I right? Shit.\u201d\n\nAdam Corolla (to Sean Hayes): \u201cI\u2019ve always kind of wondered what it\u2019d be like being blown by a guy. I imagine it would be a lot like wearing Crocs. Sure it feels great \u2026 until you look down.\u201d\n\nJeff Ross (to Ken Jeong): \u201cYour wife and you just had identical twin daughters. Congratulations. Ken told me he can\u2019t tell them apart. Well, now you know how the rest of us feel. You\u2019re a good guy, Ken. Thank you for letting them live.\u201d\n\nRobert De Niro: \u201cCaitlyn Jenner, there\u2019s something different about you, but I can\u2019t put my finger in it.\u201d\n\nAlec Baldwin: \u201cBlake, tonight you demonstrated what you do best: sitting while others score.\u201d", "description": "A roundup of ten of the best jokes from Comedy Central\u2019s \u2018Roast of Alec Baldwin,\u2019 featuring Sean Hayes, Nikki Glaser, Blake Griffin, Chris Redd, Robert De Niro, and more.", "authors": ["Isaac Kozell"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/16/16-alec-baldwin-comedy-central-roast.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
