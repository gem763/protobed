Made with a recycled polyester fill, it insulates your body even when wet, so it\u2019s great for chilly, damp days or during physical activity on freezing cold ones. Reviewers also say it packs down to a fraction of its actual size, which is handy for traveling. \u201cRecently took this jacket with me on a two-week trip through the southern region Japan (warm climate) to the northern island of Hokkaido (snow),\u201d writes a reviewer. \u201cFirst up, it packs down quite nicely making it great for travel as its footprint becomes the size of a stuffed sandwich bag and weighs next to nothing. I never felt overheated wearing the jacket in mid-60\u00b0 weather or too cold wearing the jacket out on an icy morning in the mid-30s while wearing just a flannel underneath.\u201d\n\nThe Patagonia Nano Puff Jacket comes in men\u2019s and women\u2019s sizes XS to XXL and is true to size.\n\nGet the Men\u2019s Patagonia Nano Puff Jacket from REI for $199\n\nGet the Women\u2019s Patagonia Nano Puff Jacket from REI for $199\n\n2.
