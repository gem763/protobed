Assistance Mission in Afghanistan reported in its third quarter figures, marking the highest number of civilian casualties in a single quarter that UNAMA has recorded since it began systematically documenting such figures in 2009.\n\nThese civilian casualties included 1,174 deaths and 3,139 injured.\n\n\u201cCivilian casualties at record-high levels clearly show the need for all parties concerned to pay much more attention to protecting the civilian population, including through a review of conduct during combat operations,\u201d Tadamichi Yamamoto, the secretary general\u2019s special representative for Afghanistan and head of UNAMA, said in a statement Thursday. \u201cThe harm caused to civilians by the fighting in Afghanistan signals the importance of peace talks leading to a cease-fire and a permanent political settlement to the conflict; there is no other way forward.\u201d\n\nMore than half of civilian casualties so far this year have been in the third quarter with 8,239 casualties documented in the first nine months of the year, including 2,563 people killed and 5,676 injured.\n\nCivilian casualties increased by 42 percent in the third quarter this year over the same period last year.\n\n\u201cThe third quarter of 2019 proved to be particularly turbulent, with civilians gravely affected by the escalation of violence,\u201d the third quarter report said. \u201cAs talks between the United States and the Taliban progressed in Doha throughout July and August, violence causing casualties soared.\u201d\n\nIn the first nine months of this year, 41 percent of all civilian casualties were women and children.\n\n\u201cThe combined use of suicide and non-suicide IEDS (improvised explosive devices) was the leading cause of civilian casualties, making up 42 percent of the overall total,\u201d during the nine-month period, the UNAMA statement said.\n\nThe UNAMA report added that \u201canti-government elements\u201d caused the majority of civilian casualties and \u201cslightly more civilian deaths\u201d over the nine months \u201cthan pro-government forces.\u201d", "description": "Oct. 17 (UPI) \u2014 The United Nations stressed Thursday the need to do more to protect civilians in Afghanistan as new figures show a record-high", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
