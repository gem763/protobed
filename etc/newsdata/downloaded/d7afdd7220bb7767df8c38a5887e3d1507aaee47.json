Who\u2019s Caring for Us?", "language": "en", "text": "Working as a secretary by day, Aunt Evelyn took college courses at night to increase her earning power. After graduation, she got a teaching job at a community college in Wilmington, Del., where she moved the household. Friends visited, my mother drove down from Philadelphia weekly; we all did our best. But my grandmother\u2019s life shrank. \u201cSit down here,\u201d she\u2019d say when we came, \u201cand tell me what\u2019s going on in the outside world.\u201d\n\nShut away from work that generates money and social capital, caregivers like my aunt and grandmother make up a barely visible secret society. AARP\u2019s Public Policy Institute has estimated the annual economic value of unpaid caregiving at $470 billion. If you paid everyone for a year\u2019s worth of caring for loved ones \u2014 cooking, washing, transporting, giving pills and shots and rubs, taping together torn oxygen tubes, changing adult diapers, bringing wanderers back home, reading to those who can\u2019t anymore and whose minds beg for the refreshment of new ideas, tucking the pain-ridden into bed at night and prying them out in the morning \u2014 it would use up almost all the revenue of Walmart worldwide.\n\nNaturally, people have looked for ways to turn that work into money. A handful of states offer some form of limited paid leave to workers to care for a family member, but for the rest of the country, the Family and Medical Leave Act, which applies only to immediate family members, allows for up to 12 work weeks of unpaid leave. Like my grandmother, the more than 40 million Americans who are working as family caregivers often have no choice but to lose income \u2014 more than $300,000 on average in lifetime wages and benefits for people over 50 who leave work to reorganize their lives around a loved one\u2019s disability .\n\nAs nursing home costs rise, insurance companies and legislators have approved funding for modifications that let older people stay at home longer, such as chair rails, braces, walkers, oxygen tanks, potty chairs and my favorite, the flyweight 19-pound wheelchair. But our mental, emotional and spiritual needs are just as difficult to manage as we age, harder to expense and easier to ignore. Governments have created programs to get \u201chelping hands\u201d and \u201cangels\u201d into the homes of older people, but navigating the confusing national map of options is overwhelming, and millions who may be eligible for services cannot figure out how to benefit from them.\n\nBecause we do not prioritize psychological well-being, we don\u2019t ask how keeping the elderly and disabled in good spirits could make us a stronger, better, happier country. Instead, we ask home care workers to provide, often for little more than minimum wage, very subtle, tailored companionship \u2014 call it care or friendship or even love. With longer life expectancies, the need for caregiving in later life is increasing. How we update care systems will affect not only this often hidden sector of American life but also our national debt, and, if we had one, our Gross National Happiness Index.", "description": "Too many people have no choice but to reconfigure their lives around a loved one\u2019s disability.", "authors": ["Lorene Cary"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/27/opinion/sunday/27cary/27cary-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
