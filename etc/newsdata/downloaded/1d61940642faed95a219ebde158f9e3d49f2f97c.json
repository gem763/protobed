The president also took aim at several of the network\u2019s anti-Trump personalities, including legal analyst Andrew Napolitano and daytime anchor Shepard Smith.\n\nThe president wrote on Twitter:\n\nFrom the day I announced I was running for President, I have NEVER had a good @FoxNews Poll. Whoever their Pollster is, they suck. But @FoxNews is also much different than it used to be in the good old days. With people like Andrew Napolitano, who wanted to be a Supreme Court Justice & I turned him down (he\u2019s been terrible ever since), Shep Smith, @donnabrazile (who gave Crooked Hillary the debate questions & got fired from @CNN), & others, @FoxNews doesn\u2019t deliver for US anymore. It is so different than it used to be.\n\n\u201cOh well, I\u2019m President!\u201d he added.\n\n\u2026Court Justice & I turned him down (he\u2019s been terrible ever since), Shep Smith, @donnabrazile (who gave Crooked Hillary the debate questions & got fired from @CNN), & others, @FoxNews doesn\u2019t deliver for US anymore. It is so different than it used to be. Oh well, I\u2019m President! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 10, 2019\n\nThe poll comes as House Democrats move swiftly with an impeachment inquiry against President Trump that was launched in the wake of a partisan CIA officer\u2019s so-called \u201cwhistleblower\u201d complaint claiming the president pressured the leader of Ukraine to look into allegations of corruption against former vice president and 2020 candidate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky vehemently deny any pressure was applied to look into the Biden family. To underscore no wrongdoing occurred, the White House released a transcript of the July 25th telephone call.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s Thursday tweets are not the first time he\u2019s criticized Fox News in recent months. In August, the president blasted the network for letting \u201cmillions\u201d of Americans down by allowing Democrat panelists and guests to push their talking points unchallenged.\n\n\u201cWe have to start looking for a new News Outlet. Fox isn\u2019t working for us anymore!\u201d he tweeted.\n\n\u201cJust watched Fox News heavily promoting the Democrats through their DNC Communications Director, spewing out whatever she wanted with zero pushback by anchor, Sandra Smith,\u201d he added.", "description": "William Barr and Rupert Murdoch reportedly met privately on Wednesday evening as President Trump ratchets up attacks on Fox News.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/William-Barr-Rupert-Murdoch-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
