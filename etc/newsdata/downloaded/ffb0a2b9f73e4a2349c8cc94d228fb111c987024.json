REUTERS/Hannah McKay\n\nPARIS (Reuters) - French literary types aghast at the political turmoil engulfing Britain as it seeks to leave the European Union launched a tongue-in-cheek Twitter campaign on Wednesday to add \u2018Brexit\u2019 to the national lexicon.\n\nFrench commentator Bernard Pivot\u2019s proposed dictionary entry for \u201cbrexit\u201d, as a common noun with a small \u201cb\u201d describing an insoluble mess, was re-tweeted 2,700 times within six hours.\n\n\u201cIt would signify a cacophonous and insoluble debate or a shambolic meeting,\u201d wrote Pivot, chairman of the panel that awards France\u2019s prestigious Goncourt Prize for fiction.\n\nThe term might even replace \u201cbordel\u201d, as several of his followers suggested - a word of similar metaphorical meaning but which literally designates a brothel. Exasperated compatriots would then exclaim \u201cQuel brexit!\u201d instead of \u201cQuel bordel!\u201d\n\n\u201cExcellent,\u201d another replied approvingly. \u201cMore violent and less vulgar.\u201d", "description": "French literary types aghast at the political turmoil engulfing Britain as it seeks to leave the European Union launched a tongue-in-cheek Twitter campaign on Wednesday to add 'Brexit' to the national lexicon.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190911&t=2&i=1428672913&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8A0WT", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
