When asked in a television interview 10 days ago about the Trump conversation with Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Pompeo had looked quizzical and implied he was hearing about it for the first time.\n\nWhen asked again on Wednesday, after a visit to the Vatican and meetings with Italian leaders, the secretary of state said: \u201cAs for was I on the phone call? I was on the phone call.\u201d But Pompeo presented the conversation as part of normal state department business, trying to bolster a new Ukrainian government against the threat of Russia.\n\nHe did not explain how Trump asking Zelenskiy for an investigation into the business dealings of the son of Joe Biden, a frontrunner for the Democratic nomination in the 2020 US presidential election, helped strengthen Ukrainian security.\n\nBut he referred dismissively to the growing scandal engulfing the Trump administration as \u201call this noise\u201d.\n\nPompeo\u2019s admission comes amid a struggle between the secretary of state and Congress over the demands of three House committees to see documents related to Trump administration contacts with Zelenskiy and his government, and to depose five current and former state department officials to testify on Capitol Hill.\n\nOn Wednesday, Pompeo argued that the congressional demands violated the constitutional separation of powers, as he claimed the officials deposed were advised not to contact the state department\u2019s legal office, or have anyone from the state department with them at their appearance before the congressional committees.\n\n\u201cThis has been reported to us,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Tuesday Pompeo dismissed summonses from the Democratic committee chairmen for the five witnesses, accusing Democrats of \u201can attempt to intimidate, bully, and treat improperly\u201d the officials. The requested dates were \u201cnot feasible\u201d, he said.\n\nThe chairmen fired back, warning anyone trying to impede witnesses that such behavior could constitute obstruction of an impeachment inquiry.\n\nThe speed of the investigation raises \u201csignificant legal and procedural concerns\u201d, Pompeo wrote to the foreign affairs committee. \u201cI will not tolerate such tactics, and I will use all means at my disposal to prevent and expose any attempts to intimidate the dedicated professionals.\u201d\n\nHowever, it soon became clear that Pompeo had only limited power to stop the congressional committees from gathering evidence for an impeachment inquiry. One of the five witnesses deposed, Kurt Volker, former special envoy for Ukraine who resigned last week, confirmed he would speak to the committees in closed session on Thursday, according to the Associated Press.\n\nHouse sources were quoted as saying that a second witness, Marie Yovanovitch, former ambassador to Kyiv, would appear on 11 October, nine days later than originally scheduled.\n\nAnd perhaps most damaging of all, the state department\u2019s inspector general, Steve Linick, who acts as an independent watchdog, informed the House committees that he wanted to brief them on Wednesday on documents concerning relations with Ukraine that had been obtained from the department\u2019s legal adviser. That will also take place behind closed doors.\n\nIt was unclear whether Pompeo had been warned of Linick\u2019s move.\n\nPompeo, speaking further in Rome on Wednesday, tried to deflect questions about the appropriateness of his and Trump\u2019s conduct concerning the Zelenskiy call when he said he just wanted to help Ukraine \u201cget graft out, and corruption out of their government\u201d and that he wanted to \u201chelp a new government\u201d be successful, with a thriving economy.\n\n\u201cIt was taking down the threat that Russian poses there in Ukraine,\u201d Pompeo said. \u201cIt is about helping Ukrainians get graft out, and corruption out of their government, and to help this new government in Ukraine build a successful, thriving economy.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s what we will continue to do, even while all this noise is going on,\u201d he said.", "description": "Secretary of state made admission in Rome, after his participation had been reported in the US press", "authors": ["Julian Borger", "David Smith", "Michael H Fuchs"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/204117d66341ec81deea2a523d57a3855b8f16af/0_205_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=61b73229ba92b3072b37332488ed641b"}
