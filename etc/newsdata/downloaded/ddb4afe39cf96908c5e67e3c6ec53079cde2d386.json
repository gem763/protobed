Earbuds (I still can\u2019t write \u201chearables\u201d without cringing a bit) are the clearest path to making Alexa work outside of the home. Amazon, after all, has been unable to crack the smartphone category. Half a decade later, the Fire Phone is little more than a historical curiosity, while Google and Apple have had massive mobile footprints to spread their smart assistants.\n\nAmazon has dabbled in mobile, with a downloadable Alexa app and Fire Tablet functionality. Last year, the company announced the Alexa Mobile Accessory Kit, which is designed to bring the AI to more devices. Certainly it makes sense as a third-party partner for companies that don\u2019t have the resources or desire to develop their own assistant. The latest Fitbit Versa might be the best example of such an alliance.\n\n\n\nFrom a pure user experience standpoint, however, headphones are the most logical conduit. They\u2019re positioned closest to the mouth for voice commands via microphone and, obviously, offer a direct route into the ear for Alexa responses. In waiting to see how the market shakes out, the company has ceded potential market share.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot about the Echo Buds that would have made them an excellent addition to the category two or three years ago. But the category is among the fastest moving in consumer electronics. Samsung, Sony and Apple/Beats all have excellent offerings, and Amazon opening up Alexa to hardware companies has all but assured that third-party products from companies will eclipse the Echo Buds shortly.\n\nThe company does get some things right on its first go. If there\u2019s one thing the Echo Buds really have going for them, it\u2019s customization. For the earbuds themselves, that means not only the customary replaceable silicone tips, but also wings to help them stay in place in the ear. I\u2019ve never been a fan of the hard plastic wings, but the soft silicone covers that slip over the buds are a nice touch.\n\nThey\u2019re available in three sizes, so you should be able to find a decent fit. Once everything is in place, the buds should form a nice seal to keep sound in and unwanted ambient noise out. For my money, though, the PowerBeats Pro are still the best on the market when it comes to fit. The over-the-ear design keeps them from straining your ears after an extended period. Amazon\u2019s solution is fairly elegant, as well.\n\nThe rest of the customization \u2014 and just about everything else, for that matter \u2014 is done in the app. Without its own operating system, the Echo Buds don\u2019t have quite the same out of the box pairing experience as first-party Apple or Android headphones. That said, once you\u2019ve downloaded the app, pairing is painless. For those who have other Echo devices, there\u2019s probably something to be said for having all of your Echo devices in a single spot.\n\nFrom here, you can customize the touch gestures. By default, a double tap on the left or right ear toggles between active noise reduction (not full-on cancelation) and pass-through modes, while pressing and holding fires up Alexa. The nice thing about this is the ability to reduce accidental triggers. That\u2019s probably my biggest complaint with the Galaxy Buds \u2014 the slightest adjustment triggers the touch. The app also offers a built-in equalizer, with sliders for bass, mid and treble, along with a five-level slider for the pass-through ambient mode.\n\nThe sound isn\u2019t bad for the price, once you\u2019ve got a nice seal and a the settings to your liking. Sony\u2019s spring to mind both for the quality of the audio and the active noise canceling, but they\u2019re priced at nearly double Amazon\u2019s. I suppose we\u2019ll be able to compare it to Apple\u2019s in the near future, but again, pricing is a major consideration. I like the idea of pass through mode more than the actual implementation. The concept is a nice one \u2014 the ability to let in your surroundings. The ambient sound feature leans a little too heavily on the microphones. I wouldn\u2019t recommend having it anywhere above a one out of four. Things like an AC unit were amplified to a point that was overwhelming.\n\nAlexa, meanwhile, is still very much a home assistant, but Amazon should be building upon that as it makes a more aggressive push. This early implementation was a little buggy in the first go. Asking for the news, Alexa had trouble connecting to NPR, and instead just gave me the weather. Trying to get the assistant to fire up noise reduction with my took a couple of goes, but in both cases, I eventually got them to work. On a whole, however, the microphone did a good job recognizing commands.\n\nThe design of the buds themselves is fairly generic, but that\u2019s perfectly fine. The charging case, meanwhile, is a pretty reasonable size, somewhere between the AirPods\u2019 little dental floss case and the massive PowerBeats Pros. It\u2019s small enough to carry around in your pocket \u2014 one of my biggest issues with Beats\u2019 otherwise terrific earbuds. The materials are certainly on the cheap size, and the inclusion of a microUSB slot in 2019 certainly gives the industry of a company working hard to keep prices down.\n\nAt $130, they\u2019re priced $30 less than the standard AirPods 2. Amazon would have done well to go all in on pricing here \u2014 $99 would have been a really solid sweet spot for the company \u2014 well below other premium earbuds. That\u2019s still a decent premium over off-brand buds, but a familiar name \u2014 and assistant \u2014 would surely carry some weight with Amazon shoppers. And given that much of the market has settled at between $150 and $250, they\u2019re a downright deal by comparison.\n\nAmazon will almost certainly sell plenty, and knowing Amazon, we may see some decent discounts around the holidays. And hey, with Apple\u2019s recent announcement of $249 AirPod Pros, that $130 price tag just got a whole lot more appealing.", "description": "It\u2019s a wonder that Echo Buds didn\u2019t arrive sooner.
