Airports in Halifax, Montreal, Toronto, Calgary, Edmonton and Winnipeg will integrate the technology in the coming months. The facial-recognition kiosks are replacing iris scanners Nexus uses at its check-in stations, and CBSA says the new system will speed up check-in for travellers. (The Logic)\n\nTalking point: Facial-recognition technology is becoming standard in international airports. U.S. President Donald Trump issued an executive order in March 2017 to have the technology in place by 2021 for all passengers at the 20 biggest U.S. airports, many of which already use it. The prevalence of facial recognition has sparked concerns about data privacy\u2014a BuzzFeed News article cites documents that show the U.S. government may be skirting privacy laws to expedite the technology\u2019s roll-out. The CBSA said the Nexus system follows Canada\u2019s Privacy Act, and that no personal information will be stored on the kiosks themselves. \u201cThe only information retained is saved securely on CBSA systems,\u201d the agency said in a notice to members. While most airports in the U.S. let travellers opt out of facial recognition check-ins, Nexus travellers, who join the program for its convenience, won\u2019t have that choice.", "description": "", "authors": ["Catherine Mcintyre"], "top_image": "https://thelogic.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/WP_Logo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
