DragonImages\n\nIt has plenty to offer on the long-term benefits of challenging professional orthodoxy and even a few tips on managing household expenditure. \u201cHer budget is blessedly free of those two core expenses, entertainment and status,\u201d Powers tells us about one of the main characters, Patricia Westerford.\n\nBut the central point is that the modern economy is yet to find an accommodation with the natural world, a failure that may ultimately condemn us humans \u2013 the trees will survive as they are apparently smarter.\n\nThe book is also a rebuke on the idea of consumption being the \u201csole end and purpose\u201d of economic activity, as Adam Smith told us in 1776. This radical idea of buying less stuff, or at least appearing to, is the modern mantra for the eco-conscious. But it\u2019s not that easy as I\u2019ve recently discovered.\n\nWhen my kids ask what I did to stem climate change, I\u2019ll tell them I tried to get the vacuum fixed.\n\nHave you tried getting something fixed these days? Short of being an electrical engineer the idea of keeping consumer goods beyond a few years is impossible. Take my Dyson vacuum cleaner \u2013 a purchase that provided both entertainment and status. It\u2019s headed for landfill as $700 does not buy you a conveniently located service centre.\n\nRather in Sydney, it\u2019s a 50-minute drive to an industrial park only open between 8:30am and 4:30pm on weekdays. That\u2019s a stretch for us wage slaves, but I did convince my wife\u2019s aunt she would benefit from a voyage of discovery to Sydney\u2019s Taren Point.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThose repairs lasted a week and then I did what any man who appreciates a clean floor would do \u2013 outlaid $199 for a new one. It\u2019s not a Dyson so will have to be hidden from public view.\n\nDitto the coffee machine, which lasted five years but is also on its way to landfill as there\u2019s no one around to fix it. But don\u2019t worry, when my kids ask what I did to stem climate change, I\u2019ll tell them I tried to get the vacuum fixed and hand them a copy of The Overstory.", "description": "It's not fair dinkum fiction, but The Overstory, by Richard Powers, has plenty of lessons for us wage slaves.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2163%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_12/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/0b604e176ca810476517353db6450ecbf008cb16", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
