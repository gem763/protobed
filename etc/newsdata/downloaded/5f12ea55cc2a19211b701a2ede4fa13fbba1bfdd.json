Outgoing Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker also criticized the name on Thursday.\n\nSassoli didn't criticise the name of Schinas' portfolio openly. But he said he had noticed that \u201cfundamental\u201d portfolio names like \u201cimmigration,\u201d \u201cculture\u201d and \u201cresearch\u201d were missing, adding: \u201cI think that these words are very important.\"\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not enough to say innovation and youth to talk about culture and research. And we at the Parliament, we know this well because we know these words and what they mean,\u201d Sassoli said.\n\nHe was likely referring to the portfolio of Mariya Gabriel, the commissioner-designate for \"innovation and youth,\" whose responsibilities also include research and innovation. Previous commissioners with this portfolio have had the word \"research\" in their titles.\n\nCommenting briefly on Brexit, Sassoli said the Parliament was open to an extension of Article 50 but \u201conly if justified.\u201d", "description": "David Sassoli said Ursula von der Leyen would explain her decisions at a meeting next week.", "authors": ["David M.
