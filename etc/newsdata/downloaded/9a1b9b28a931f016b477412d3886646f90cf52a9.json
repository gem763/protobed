Don't be these people.'\n\nShe then posted a follow-up tweet of her children sitting cramped, with her 12-year-old 'staring the couple down'.\n\nShe added: 'I would always give up a seat, reserved or not, for someone who needed it more. But for her to tell me that my tickets meant nothing and then refuse to acknowledge me? Do people just expect you to slink away?'\n\nSpeaking to the Sun, a spokesperson for CrossCountry trains said the family had been 'let down by others who ignore the labels'.\n\nHer original tweet has since received nearly 2,000 comments and nearly 17,000 likes.\n\n** Did you see what happened yesterday on the Crosscountry train?

I didn't feel it was my responsibility to acquiesce to that kind of behaviour.\n\nAmanda set out her case against the couple in a series of tweets (pictured above)\n\nPeople on Twitter were quick to jump to Amanda's side with many saying the family had worked out better off as they had been upgraded to first class\n\n'I was shocked and tired. Any mother who travels with bags and children knows how your mind is in a thousand places, so things like reserved seats are something you count on.\n\n'They make your journey manageable. I'd booked a table so the children could do their schoolwork.'\n\nThis is while many social media users were quick to jump to Amanda's defence with some saying respect works both ways.\n\nOne user said: 'We are all, rightly, taught to respect our elders. Respect works both ways! I would have sat on the table and peered into her eyes.'\n\nThis is while another added: 'Pleased to see the conductor sorted it. The comments about bad manners from the young are frequent. I often find the older generation can be just as guilty. Not all of course, but some stubborn cretins.'\n\n** Did you see what happened yesterday on the Crosscountry train?
