Morgan (JPM.N) as joint lead managers on the deal.\n\n(This story corrects pricing to 24 basis points over mid-swaps, not 26, in paragraph three; adjusts yield in paragraph four and first bullet point)", "description": "Ireland raised 2 billion euros on Thursday from the sale of green bonds at a yield well below a debut sale a year ago, highlighting the growing popularity of the bonds which provide cash for projects with environmental benefits.", "authors": ["Padraic Halpin", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
