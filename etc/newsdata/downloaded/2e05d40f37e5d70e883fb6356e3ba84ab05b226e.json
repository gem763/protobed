The vehicles were designed by the same engineer behind the Vespa motor scooter, and soon became popular on cramped roads thanks to their compact size. The vehicle famously featured in 1983 film Octopussy, which saw it involved in a classic James Bond chase scene through the streets of Udaipur in India. The tuk tuk chase scene in the 1983 Bond film Octopussy The vehicle was built upon the frame of a 1982 Honda 250R ATC three-wheeler, and featured in the film when 007, played by Roger Moore, had just beaten the exiled Afghan prince in a game of backgammon. In May this year, a freight firm boss from Essex set a new tuk tuk land speed record, having purchased the three-wheeled vehicle during a 'boozy night on eBay'. Matt Everard, 46, of Billericay, set a speed of 74.306mph in the 1971 Bangkok taxi in North Yorkshire, having been set a target of 68.35mph by Guinness World Records.\n\nThe Duke also raised the issue of climate change in his speech, saying that the country's glaciers were under threat and as a result its water supply.\n\n'For a country so young, Pakistan has endured many hardships, with countless lives lost to terror and hatred.

Thank you Tom for that kind introduction. Ladies and gentlemen, it is our great pleasure to join you here this evening on our first official visit to Pakistan. Already, Catherine and I have been honoured by the hospitality you have shown us, and we have certainly managed to make our way through a record breaking amount of food so generously offered by our hosts. I would like to begin by saying bahut shukriya to you all for making us so welcome in your country. Stood here with this magnificent monument behind me, I am struck by the great strides Pakistan has made since its birth seventy-two years ago. The view from this hill would have been quite different when my grandmother, The Queen, first visited over half a century ago. Looking out, one would have seen the beginnings of a city under construction, yet to become the great capital that it is today. In his address to the reception, arranged to showcase the best of Pakistani culture, the duke recognised the troubled past of Pakistan. 'Delivering a future where Pakistan's great potential can be realised will not be easy or without sacrifice,' he said. And with successive visits by my mother and my father, this view has continued to change, with the city constantly growing and with it my family's affection for Pakistan. This is the world's sixth largest country by population. It has an unbelievably diverse geography that spans deserts to glaciers and everything in between. It is the birth place of the youngest ever Nobel peace prize winner. And I am told that it hosts not just the second highest mountain in the world, but also its highest cash machine! It is also home to one of the youngest populations in the world, with an average age of just 24 \u2013 almost half that of the UK. In a public school not far from where we gather this evening, Catherine and I saw young children learning and playing, aided by an inspiring teacher, trained through the Teach for Pakistan programme. We spoke with ambitious young women finishing their schooling and planning for university and work. As Muhammed Ali Jinnah said, 'No struggle can ever succeed without women participating side by side with men'. It was good to hear from President Alvi and Prime Minster Khan, earlier today that education will continue to be an important priority for Pakistan. We also saw the brilliant work taking place in the Margalla Hills, where young children were being taught the importance of protecting and caring for the world around them. The education of Pakistan's next generation will be the key that turns the country's growing population into an engine of growth and helps unlock this country's enormous potential. A rapidly growing population presents you with an enormous opportunity, but also significant challenge. During his keynote speech, Prince William highlighted the relationship between the UK and Pakistan - and also referred to when his grandmother the Queen (picture during a visit to Karachi in 1961) visited more than fifty years ago The UK and Pakistan share unique bonds and so it will always be in our best interests for you to succeed. Not least because of the 1.5 million people living in the UK with Pakistani origin and the fact that the UK is one of the biggest investors in your economy. You can rely on us to keep playing an important role as a key partner and your friend. Delivering a future where Pakistan's great potential can be realised will not be easy or without sacrifice. For a country so young, Pakistan has endured many hardships, with countless lives lost to terror and hatred. Tonight I want to pay tribute to all those who have endured such sacrifice and helped to build the country that we see today. Whether in Pakistan or the UK or elsewhere on our planet \u2013 we face shared global challenges. The effects of climate change threaten the present and the future \u2013 and therefore demand a concerted effort by everyone. In Pakistan, your spectacular glaciers \u2013 and those of the wider Hindu Kush-Himalaya region \u2013 serve as a critical water store for a quarter of a billion people; and over 1.6 billion people rely on the great rivers that flow from the mountains in this part of the world. Yet, because the effects of global warming at altitude, a one and a half degree Celsius temperature increase overall could mean warming of over two degrees Celsius for northern Pakistan's highest mountains. This could lead to a loss of over a third of these vital glaciers in less than a century, with enormous impacts not only on the availability of water, but on agriculture and hydropower generation. Tomorrow we will be seeing some of these impacts first hand and meeting some of the communities adjusting to the new realities and new challenges that climate change has brought to their towns and villages. I hope to learn what more we all can do to help prevent and mitigate this impending global catastrophe. Ladies and gentlemen, given the scale and complexities of the challenges that future generations will face, it is clear that we all need to work together. And whether it's this generation or the next, I know that the UK and Pakistan will continue to exemplify the very best in international cooperation. Yes, the challenges ahead are great. But we cannot be daunted, nor distracted. Instead we should draw strength from our shared bonds and heed the words of Muhammed Ali Jinnah as we do so, 'My message to you all' he said 'is of hope, courage, and confidence'.\n\nEarlier, the Duke shared a touching exchange with schoolgirls in Pakistan about their love for his late mother Princess Diana today as he also met the country's Prime Minister on a royal tour with wife Kate.\n\nThe couple visited the Islamabad Model College for Girls in the capital, touring classrooms and posing for a group picture with some of the young students, ranging from kindergarten age students to sixth formers.\n\nWilliam was told the girls were 'big fans of your mother'. He gave a broad smile and said: 'You were, really? Oh that's very sweet of you. I was a big fan of my mother too. She came here three times. I was very small.'\n\nThe couple later had lunch with Prime Minister Imran Khan, with William changing into a smart suit, and Kate wearing trousers by Maheen Khan, a tunic by Catherine Walker, a scarf by Satrangi and earrings by Zeen.\n\nThe five-day visit to Pakistan, following in Diana's footsteps in 1997, is designed to champion the importance of quality education, and highlight how girls benefit from pursuing higher education and professional careers.\n\nThe visit is the first time a Royal Family member has set foot in Pakistan for 13 years due to violence and terrorism that has blighted the country, including the assassination of former prime minister Benazir Bhutto in 2007.\n\nFormer international cricketer Mr Khan was a friend of Diana, Princess of Wales - who visited a cancer hospital in Lahore as a guest of him and his then wife, Jemima Goldsmith, in May 1997, just three months before her death.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge visit the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Imran Khan, in central Islamabad today\n\nThe Duchess of Cambridge laughs while playing a game with pupils at the Islamabad Model College for Girls today\n\nWilliam and Kate meet the President of Pakistan Arif Alvi and his wife Samina at the Presidential Palace in Islamabad today\n\nThe couple are visiting the Islamabad Model College for Girls in the capital, touring classrooms and posing for a group picture with some of the young students, ranging from kindergarten age students to sixth formers\n\nKate looked relaxed as she stepped out of the royal car wearing a stunning blue traditional kurta and a pair of nude heels\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge pose for a group photo as they visit a school today in Islamabad, Pakistan\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge visit the Prime Minister of Pakistan Imran Khan in central Islamabad today\n\nPrincess Diana poses with Education Minister for Punjab Province Iqbal Chaudhary (second left), Jemima Khan, holding her son Sulaiman Isa, son of Jemima and Imran Khan, and her former husband, Imran (right), at Lahore Airport in Pakistan in 1997\n\nWho is Maheen Khan? Fashion Pakistan Week boss who designed Kate's kurta for historic trip The Duchess visits Margalla Hills in Islamabad today Kate dazzled crowds as she stepped out in a traditional blue kurta and scarf by Maheen Khan, an international Pakistani designer and costume designer. The kurta is a long loose-fitting collarless shirt, with the style originating in India. The clothing has its roots in Central Asian nomadic tunics. Ms Khan opened her first shop in Lahore, 'The Seamstress', in 1972 and has since taken part in 20 international shows. She is the chief executive of Fashion Pakistan Week and has had her collections featured at Milan Fashion Week as well. Designer Maheen Khan, at Fashion Pakistan Week in 2009 Ms Khan was recently dubbed the 'Coco Chanel of the East' and is renowned for her flattering cuts and mastery of the use of chiffon. She was commissioned by Harrods to make a replica of the Queen's coronation dress for the 60th anniversary celebrations, but ultimately it wasn't used so she presented it to the British High Commission in Karachi instead.\n\nThe Duke reminded Mr Khan how the then cricketer told him he wanted to be Pakistan's Prime Minister years ago.\n\nWilliam recalled how everyone laughed at a gathering in Richmond-upon-Thames in 1996 when the former Sussex and Worcestershire cricketer announced his political ambition to the then teenage Prince William and Diana.\n\nDiana had taken him to see Mr Khan and his then wife, Jemima Goldsmith, at the Goldsmith family home in Richmond.\n\nMr Khan, who was finally elected Pakistani Prime Minister in July 2018, suggested it had been as hard a slog as his earlier career as a Test cricketer.\n\n'When I went with my mother to see a Test match my cousin was playing and he scored a century and I told my mother I wanted to be a Test cricketer,' he said.\n\n' I never realised how difficult it was to eventually become one. Similarly, when I told you that I wanted to succeed I didn't realise it would take me 22 years.'\n\nWilliam, 37, replied: 'Sure. It's not so easy.'\n\nHis wife Kate, who was wearing white trousers by the Pakistani designer Maheen Khan, an emerald green tunic by Catherine Walker and a navy patterned scarf by Satrangi, another local designer, and earrings by the Pakistani firm Zeen, interjected: 'You stuck with it.'\n\nThe Prime Minister was recalling his friendship with Diana when journalists were allowed into his chamber for a few seconds to see the royal couple meeting him today at his official residence in Islamabad.\n\nThey spoke about one of the places that the royal couple will visit tomorrow - the destination is currently under wraps - and Mr Khan said he thought Diana might have been there before.\n\nMr Khan, who was married to Jemima Goldsmith between 1995 and 2004, uses the residence - known simply as The Prime Minister's House, for official entertaining but actually lives in his private house on the outskirts of the capital.\n\nThe Oxford-educated politician studied politics, philosophy, and economics at Keble College in the city of dreaming spurs between 1972 and 1975 before becoming a professional cricketer.\n\nPrince William smiles as he speaks to with the Prime Minister of Pakistan in central Islamabad today\n\nWilliam and Kate meet with Prime Minister Imran Khan before having lunch with him in Islamabad today\n\nPakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan welcomes Prince William and Kate to his residence in Islamabad today\n\nWilliam and Kate meet with Prime Minister Imran Khan before having lunch with him in Islamabad today\n\nPrime Minister of Pakistan Imran Khan waited to greet Prince William and Kate in Islamabad today\n\nThey spoke about one of the places that the royal couple will visit tomorrow, but the destination is currently under wraps\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge greet Prime Minister of Pakistan Imran Khan after arriving for a meeting today\n\nThe Duke of Cambridge reminded Mr Khan how the then cricketer told him he wanted to be Pakistan's Prime Minister\n\nMr Khan uses the residence for official entertaining but actually lives in his private house on the outskirts of the capital\n\nKate wears white trousers by the Pakistani designer Maheen Khan and an emerald green tunic by Catherine Walker today\n\nThe visit came more than a year after Mr Khan was finally elected Pakistani Prime Minister in July 2018\n\nKate leaves after meeting Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan at his official residence in Islamabad today\n\nMr Khan suggested that becoming prime minister had been as hard a slog as his earlier career as a Test cricketer\n\nFrom cricket legend to Pakistan's PM: How Imran Khan became leader of his home nation Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan in Islamabad today Former Pakistan international cricket captain Imran Khan was elected as prime minister of the country in July 2018 Mr Khan had been pursuing power in his homeland since leaving London in 1996 to enter politics, putting such a strain on his marriage to the British heiress Jemima Goldsmith that they divorced in 2004 after nine years together. The Oxford-educated former London playboy pledged to build a 'new Pakistan' when he addressed the nation on TV following his victory. He also vowed to tackle corruption that was 'eating our country like a cancer', pledged good ties with neighbour India and said he would seek 'a more equal relationship' with the US. His election victory followed a tumultuous campaign - capped by a suicide bomber killing 31 at a ballot booth on polling day \u2013 which was also marred by reports of meddling and intimidation by the military. Known mainly in the West as a talented sportsman and infamous playboy, he presented a significantly more conservative and devout face to Muslim-majority Pakistan. His Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, founded in 1996, governed northwestern Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province for five years but had to settle for a handful of seats nationally after the 2013 election. However, he took advantage of the fall of Nawaz Sharif and a poor campaign by the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) to become prime minister last year.\n\nHe comes from a family of distinguished sportsmen: eight of his cousins have played first class cricket and two of them, Javed Burki and Majid Khan were also leading lights of the national Test team.\n\nWilliam and Kate and their entourage stayed at the residence for lunch.\n\nThe couple also met with President Arif Alvi who recalled how as a boy he ran along a street in Karachi to catch a glimpse of the Queen during her 1961 state visit to his country. 'It was miraculous to see her' he said.\n\nWilliam and Kate joined President Arif Alvi, first lady Samina Alvi, the foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi and his wife Mehreen, at the Presidential Palace in Islamabad.\n\nWilliam spoke of the Prince of Wales's visit to Pakistan in 2006, while the duchess sat and chatted with the first lady, who asked her about their first engagement of the day at the Islamabad Modern College for Girls. 'It's really great, a very positive environment for children,' Kate said.\n\nDuring their meeting, the President and first lady also exchanged gifts with William and Kate.\n\nEarlier, at the school, Kate dazzled crowds as she stepped out in a traditional blue kurta and scarf by local designer Maheen Khan, while William opted for a casual shirt and trousers to stay cool in the Pakistan heat.\n\nThe Cambridges pulled up tiny chairs so they could sit and chat to pupils in their classroom at the school, which also teaches young boys - and they also used the occasion to talk about the importance of mental health.\n\nSitting in the classroom with a group of teenagers, Prince William - who will, of course, be king one day - was asked what he had wanted to do when he was younger after Aima, 14, told him that she wanted to be a brain surgeon.\n\nHe said: 'Actually I changed a lot as I got older but I always wanted to learn to fly. I was flying for a while actually.\n\n'I love flying, I feel very free, I like learning a skill, I enjoy that. I can relate the science of what you do.'\n\nWilliam recalled at the meeting today how everyone laughed in 1996 when Mr Khan announced his political ambitions\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge smile during their visit today to the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Imran Khan\n\nPrince William and Kate leave after meeting Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan at his official residence today\n\nMr Khan, pictured today, had been pursuing power in his homeland since leaving London in 1996 to enter politics\n\nMr Khan is known mainly in the West as a talented sportsman for Pakistan and an infamous Oxford-educated playboy\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge leave after meeting Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan at his official residence today\n\nPrince William, Duke of Cambridge meets the President of Pakistan, Dr Arif Alvi, at the Presidential Palace in Islamabad today\n\nThe Duchess of Cambridge stands next to Samina Alvi, wife of the President of Pakistan, at the Presidential Palace today\n\nThe Duchess of Cambridge smiles as she meets with the President of Pakistan at the Presidential Palace in Islamabad today\n\nPresident Arif Alvi who recalled how as a boy he ran along a street in Karachi to catch a glimpse of the Queen during her 1961 state visit to his country (pictured). 'It was miraculous to see her' he said\n\nThe Queen's two trips to Pakistan: Monarch toured streets in open-top car in 1961... but her 1997 visit proved controversial Queen Elizabeth II in 1961 at a costume parade in Karachi The Queen has made two visits to Pakistan - with her first in 1961 a triumphal trip which saw huge crowds gather as she was driven through the streets of Lahore and Karachi. She shook hands with members of Pakistan's cricket team after a match against England, attended a gala wearing a fabulous ball gown and met the then-president Muhammad Ayub Khan. Her last visit to Pakistan in 1997 was rather more controversial, when she called on Pakistan and India to settle their differences during an address to the country's parliament. But she also swapped white-heeled shoes for navy blue socks when she visited the Faisal Mosque in Islamabad to show her respect. That visit came less than two months after Diana's death and the Queen paid tribute to the Princess of Wales's charity work in Pakistan in a speech.\n\nInside the school the couple first sat with a group of kindergarten children, aged around four, as they learnt about numbers and counting under a sign which read: Work Hard, Be Smart.\n\n'Well done, very good,' said the prince, who introduced himself by shaking each of their hands, as they chatted.\n\nThey also met a class of youngsters aged 10 to 12 who were told by their teacher: 'We have some guests in our class, can we welcome them?'\n\n'Hello, welcome, nice to meet you,' the children chorused.\n\nIn the science room, William and Kate chatted at length with a group of 14-year-olds wearing headscarves. 'This is the science class, yes? Some of the girls were saying that science is their favourite subject at school,' asked the duchess.\n\nWilliam added: 'Do you remember the periodic table? I know that a long time ago, but Catherine you remember it well, don't you?'\n\n'Do you get to do a lot of experiments?' Kate asked, 'your English is all so good.'\n\nHer husband added: 'We are trying to learn Urdu as we go on, we only know a few words now, but we hope to get better. '\n\nAsked by the chattering group of girls what they thought of Pakistan so far, Kate beamed and replied: 'It's fantastic, this is only day one for us.

Security in Pakistan prepare for the Cambridges' visit today The couple are even taking their own medic for the first time, on what is the first royal visit since Prince Charles and Camilla undertook a lengthy tour in 2006. All details of their engagements will be released by Kensington Palace on the day due to security considerations. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office says in its official travel advice: 'Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Pakistan.' It adds that British nationals of Pakistani origin 'are at particular risk of kidnap for ransom', warning some were released but others have been killed. The FCO says people 'should avoid large organised gatherings which may expose you to higher risk, such as public protests, religious gatherings and processions, and political rallies'. The trip by William and Kate, at the request of the FCO, comes during heightened tensions between Pakistan and India over the disputed region of Kashmir. Authorities in Delhi and Islamabad both claim the Himalayan region in full, but each controls a section of the territory, recognised internationally as 'Indian-administered Kashmir' and 'Pakistan-administered Kashmir'. Skirmishes between the two sides at the de-facto border have increased this year, causing troop and civilian casualties.\n\n'Very much so. This is day one but we have been wanting to come (for a long time) so it's nice to finally be here.\n\n'My mother was here a long time ago, so it's very nice, my grandmother was here, my father's been here....a lot of my family members have been here...'\n\nKate added: 'This part of the visit is really important to us, the issue of girls and education.'\n\nWilliam interjected: 'How easy is it for girls to get access to education in Pakistan? Is it easy for girls to be educated in Pakistan.'\n\nHe seemed delighted to hear that Aima wanted to be a brain surgeon and her friends armies to be poets, lawyers, army officers, teachers - and even a famous cricketer.\n\nAfterwards Aima said: 'It was very interesting it was a real honour. We are big fans of the king and queen. We learnt all about his mother, Diana, the princess.\n\n'In the UK we're trying to make sure mental health is part of education as well,' the duke told a teacher.\n\nHe said students from disadvantaged backgrounds do not have a 'stable health platform to build on' and that education in this area is important.\n\nWilliam has frequently spoken out on mental health, including recently lending his voice to a promotional video for Every Mind Matters, an initiative by Public Health England and the NHS.\n\nHe and Kate heard how students are benefiting from the Teach For Pakistan programme, a fast-track teacher training scheme modelled on the UK's successful Teach First.\n\nMohammed Sohailkhan, area education officer, explained that the quality of education, particularly for girls, varied across the country.\n\n'In recent years there has been gradual progress in understanding how important education is for girls and young women. There is a realisation of what it can mean in terms of jobs and prospects,' he said.\n\n'I can't paint you an entirely rosy picture. It does still fluctuate wildly, particularly in rural regions, where there has traditionally been cultural barriers towards this, notably in terms of sending girls away to college. But these barriers are slowly being broken down. '\n\nThe couple's next engagement was at the Margalla Hills National Park, north of Islamabad, where security officials were seen tightening up operations this morning in preparation.\n\nContinuing the theme of education, the couple were meeting children from three local schools in the hills, which sit in the foothills of the Himalayas.\n\nWilliam and Kate also had lunch with Prime Minister Imran Khan and are attending a special reception at the National Monument in their first full day of engagements.\n\nThe royal couple continued the second day of their stay in Pakistan with a visit to the Margallah Hills National Park today\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge talk to local people on a visit to the Margalla Hills on the second day of the visit today\n\nPrince William, Duke of Cambridge and Kate, Duchess of Cambridge arrive for a visit to Margalla Hills in Pakistan today\n\nThe Duchess of Cambridge holds flowers given to her by local people during a visit to the Margalla Hills today\n\nThe couple joked with conservation workers that their son George would love one of the lizards found in the national park\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge talk to local people during a visit to the Margalla Hills in Pakistan today\n\nThe Duchess of Cambridge speaks to a ranger at Margallah Hills National Park during her visit to Pakistan today\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge talk with local schoolchildren during their visit to the Margallah Hills today\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge arrive for a visit to Margalla Hills today as their tour of Pakistan continues\n\nThe Duke of Cambridge talks to a ranger at Margallah Hills National Park in Islamabad today\n\nThe couple arrived at a visitor centre nestled at the foot of the hills to hear about the park's conservation work today\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge walk with an unidentified man during a visit to the Margallah Hills today\n\nThe couple were shown a camera trap strapped to a tree designed to take pictures of animals during their visit today\n\nThe couple got to meet a group of children who had been chosen from nearby poor villages for the royal visit today\n\nThey couple met children who learn about conservation and environmental protection at regular activity classes at the site\n\nKate gesticulates (left) and shakes hands with a park ranger (right) during the royal visit to the park in Islamabad today\n\n'It was such a pleasure to meet him and talk about school.

Ingrid Seward, editor of Majesty magazine, said that while Kate Middleton, 37, hadn't had an easy time at the beginning of her time with the royal family, she has 'won people over' by working hard and making few mistakes. The royal commentator also suggested the royal tour of Pakistan, which starts today, was an indication of the respect the Queen had for Kate. She told Hello! magazine: 'The Pakistan Tour is very serious and politically sensitive and it's a great honour that she and William have been asked to do it. The Queen has obviously got a terrific faith in their ability to do it brilliantly.' And Ingrid suggested the royal trip was coming at a very happy time in the Duchesses' life, pointing to her 'family unit' and successful summer of projects as evidence.\n\nThey will also cover how communities in Pakistan are responding and adapting to climate change, and are due to spend time understanding the 'complex security picture' of the region.\n\nTheir tour of Pakistan comes more than 13 years since the last royal visit, seen as one of the most perilous royal foreign tours for some time, when the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall travelled to the country in 2006.\n\nWilliam and Kate are following in the footsteps of both his parents, as Diana, Princess of Wales, made the journey several times through her charity work.\n\nAn image of the Princess cuddling a gravely ill seven-year-old boy was among Diana's favourites and she kept a copy of it always.\n\nIt was taken amid the chaos of a Pakistan cancer hospital in 1996 and was a reflex action on her part.\n\nThe little boy did not once look at her because he was blind and had just weeks to live.\n\nTo Diana, the picture represented everything about how she wished to be seen: compassionate and ready to break down the barriers of protocol.\n\nThe Princess visited the country three times, once when married to Prince Charles and twice more after her separation when she was in love with the Pakistan-born heart surgeon Hasnat Khan.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are embarking on the first full day of their tour of Pakistan by highlighting the importance of education for girls after arriving in Islamabad last night\n\nThe Kensington Royal Instagram released this picture of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge arriving in Pakistan last night and it immediately had thousands of likes\n\nKate (left) and William will be following in the footsteps of both the Duke of Cambridge's parents, as Diana (right), Princess of Wales, made the journey several times through her charity work.
