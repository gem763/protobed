REUTERS/Aly Song\n\nSince trade negotiations between the world\u2019s largest economies broke down in May, both countries have added tariffs on billions of dollars of the others\u2019 goods, broken good faith promises and traded public insults.\n\nWashington accused Beijing of reneging on commitments to change its laws to enact economic reforms, while Beijing called U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff\u2019s \u201cbarbaric.\u201d Leaders from both countries are now vowing a long fight, despite slowing domestic economies.\n\nHere is the state of play:\n\nMEETING AMID BROKEN PROMISES\n\nDeputies from the U.S. and China trade teams will talk in mid-September to prepare for negotiations between U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, and China\u2019s Vice Premier Liu He in early October. Both sides agreed to take actions to create favorable conditions, but gave no details.\n\nNeither side has signaled it would shift from positions that led to the impasse in May, when Beijing revised a draft of the trade deal, removing references to changes in Chinese law.\n\nU.S. officials have previously said that the resumption of talks would depend on China returning to the original May deal text, but there has been no sign that China has agreed to take that step.\n\nBeijing has cited three main sticking points in the trade negotiations. They are the removal of tariffs imposed in the trade war, reduction of the scale of U.S. goods purchases that China will make to help reduce the trade imbalance between the two, and the need for a \u201cbalanced\u201d text for any trade deal.\n\nWhen Chinese President Xi Jinping and Trump met in Osaka, Japan in June, Beijing committed to buying 20 million tonnes of U.S. soybeans, but has only purchased half that amount since. Washington pledged to ease restrictions on blacklisted Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL], but has not issued waivers.\n\nHUAWEI AND HONG KONG\n\nBeijing is smarting from Trump\u2019s decision to blacklist Huawei, the world\u2019s largest telecommunications equipment maker, which effectively banned U.S. firms from doing business with the company. It has prompted many non U.S.-based companies to cut their own ties to the firm.\n\nChina wants the United States to lift those restrictions, trade deal or no, but Washington is lobbying other countries to reduce dealings with Huawei, and has threatened to blacklist other Chinese firms.\n\nTrump\u2019s comments Aug. 14 linking successful trade talks with Beijing\u2019s \u201chumane\u201d handling of protests in Hong Kong could also fuel tensions between the two sides, particularly if the demonstrations heat up further.\n\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER\n\nBefore the talks broke down in May, U.S. officials had said the two side made progress on intellectual property protection and that China made proposals on a range of issues that went further than Beijing had gone before.\n\nChina for the first time discussed forced technology transfer as a widespread problem, U.S. officials said then. U.S. companies complain they are pressured to hand over their competitive secrets as a condition for doing business in China.\n\nU.S. officials cited progress on cyber theft, services, currency, agriculture and non-tariff barriers to trade.\n\nChina, they said, offered to bring subsidies in line with World Trade Organization guidelines but had not detailed how it would do that.\n\nFor its part, the United States weakened demands China end industrial subsidies, which would require a change in China\u2019s state-driven economic model.\n\nBut after the deal fell apart, Lighthizer told a congressional hearing that China had also backtracked on commitments on digital trade issues, including U.S. access to cloud computing services in China.\n\nU.S. officials said China offered to make purchases of over $1 trillion worth of goods over the next six years, including agricultural and energy products as well as industrial goods. China has said, however, that there is still disagreement between the two sides on the actual purchases.\n\nTARIFFS AS A NEGOTIATING TOOL\n\nOne of the key sticking points before talks broke down in May was whether the Trump administration would remove 25% tariffs it had imposed on $250 billion worth of imported goods from China. The United States wanted to keep some tariffs in place to ensure that China met the terms of the deal, but China demanded all tariffs be lifted immediately.\n\nThings have escalated since. Those U.S. tariffs are now due to rise to 30% from Oct. 1, the 70th anniversary of the current Chinese state. Another $300 billion of Chinese imports face 15% U.S. tariffs, some of which began Sept. 1, with the rest to start Dec. 15.\n\nWashington could agree, as a sign of goodwill toward Beijing, to delay the 5% tariff increase, and possibly the 15% tariffs due to begin in December, analysts say.\n\nChina, which slapped 5% tariffs on U.S. crude oil Sept. 1, could postpone additional tariffs due Dec. 15. Those include a 25% tariff on U.S.-made vehicles and a 5% tariff on auto parts that it had suspended last December.\n\nSTOKING TRADE WAR FIRES AT HOME\n\nTrump has repeatedly insisted that China is paying the cost of U.S. tariffs, a claim rejected by U.S. retailers and manufacturers, although he has recently begun to concede that the trade war could also harm the U.S. economy in the short-term.\n\n\u201cChina has been ripping this country off for 25 years, for longer than that and it\u2019s about time whether it\u2019s good for our country or bad for our country short term. Long term it\u2019s imperative that somebody does this,\u201d he said in August.\n\nChina\u2019s Liu, also the chief trade negotiator, on Thursday also spoke about downward pressure on the Chinese economy, but said Beijing had sufficient policy tools to deal with any difficulties.\n\nMany of China\u2019s analysts believe Beijing will roll out more measures to boost the economy, minimizing the impact of the trade war.\n\nUNUSED WEAPONS\n\nChina has said it would draft its own list of foreign companies that it deems had harmed Chinese companies. That could serve as the basis for retaliation against U.S. companies for action against Huawei.\n\nChina has also indicated it may strike back through limiting rare earth supplies to the United States. Rare earth are minerals important to manufacturers of high-tech consumer goods and China is the dominant supplier.\n\nIt could also revoke orders for airplanes built by Boeing Co (BA.N), the No. 1 U.S. exporter.\n\nTrump is calling for U.S. companies like General Motors Co (GM.N) to pull manufacturing facilities out of China.\n\nTHE BACKDROP\n\nChina is determined to upgrade its industrial base in 10 strategic sectors by 2025, including aerospace, robotics, semiconductors, artificial intelligence and new-energy vehicles.\n\nOne of the biggest U.S. complaints is that China has used coercion and outright theft to systematically obtain American intellectual property and trade secrets and advance its standing in many high-technology industries. China\u2019s subsidies to state enterprises, including at the provincial and local government levels, have led to a build up in Chinese industries like steel that has depressed global prices and hurt producers in the United States and elsewhere.\n\nU.S. officials argue that makes it hard for U.S. companies to compete on a market-driven basis.\n\nThey say they do not have a problem with China moving up the technology ladder, but they do not want it to happen with stolen or unfairly obtained American know-how or in a market in which Chinese firms have an unfair advantage.\n\nChinese officials generally view the U.S. actions as a broad effort to thwart the Asian country\u2019s rise in the global economy. They previously denied China required or coerced technology transfers, saying that any such actions are commercial transactions between American and Chinese firms.\n\nThe Trump administration has aggressively stepped up prosecutions of intellectual property cases, and scaled back visas for Chinese students and researchers. U.S. lawmakers are writing bills that further limit visas, banning students with ties to the Chinese military.\n\nChinese authorities reject such accusations. In June Beijing warned students and academics about risks in the United States, pointing to limits on the duration of visas and visa refusals. It also warned companies operating in the United States they could face harassment from U.S. law enforcement, gun violence, robberies, and thefts.", "description": "Senior U.S. and Chinese officials have pledged to meet in October to settle their ongoing trade war but a lasting peace seems more elusive than ever.", "authors": ["Andrea Shalal", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190905&t=2&i=1426692910&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8425E", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
