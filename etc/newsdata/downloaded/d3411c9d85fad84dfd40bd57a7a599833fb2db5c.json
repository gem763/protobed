Neumann has cited \u201cenergy and spirituality\u201d as more relevant metrics for its potential on public markets than measures of its revenue and losses. The company was supposed to reinvent work itself, after all. Neumann\u2019s leadership oversaw massive, rapid growth for the company\u2014but it also seems to have been motivated largely by personal benefit rather than spiritual enlightenment.\n\nThe We Company\u2019s Form S-1 outlined a labyrinthine ownership scheme that would have given Neumann more than half of the company\u2019s voting power. Multi-class stock has caused problems for Facebook, Google, and other tech firms, but Neumann\u2019s attitude was more brazen. He used his authority as CEO to pay himself $5.9 million for rights to use the new name, a change he had championed (he later returned the money under pressure of scrutiny before the IPO). He poured tequila shots for employees after announcing layoffs. He bought stakes in real estate that WeWork later leased. He declared WeWork \u201cmeat-free\u201d by fiat in 2018, but failed to outline what that meant for its hundreds of offices and thousands of tenants. Rebekah Neumann, a WeWork co-founder and its former CEO\u2019s wife, served as both brand chief and impact officer\u2014a title that underscores the company\u2019s proselytic ambitions\u2014and also as CEO of The We Company\u2019s private elementary school WeGrow, which is charging $42,000 in tuition for this school year (I swear I am not making this up).\n\nBoth Adam Neumann and another WeWork co-founder, Miguel McKelvy, grew up, in part, in cooperatives. Neumann spent time on an Israeli kibbutz, and McKelvy on an Oregon commune. Some have speculated that those backgrounds helped draw them to co-working as a business, evangelizing collaboration through collectivism for the digital age. But Neumann, who has reportedly declared that he wants to live forever, has acted in a way that betrays his distaste for common goals and benefits\u2014or at least an interest in them only insofar as they accrue wealth, power, and influence back to him. There\u2019s another name for that kind of collective: It\u2019s called a cult.\n\nRead: Curse of the Cult of the Founder\n\nAs a consequence of his departure, the power of Neumann\u2019s voting shares will be reduced, ending his majority control. Neumann hasn\u2019t spun his ouster as martyrdom, perhaps because he\u2019ll still serve as non-executive chairman of The We Company, and perhaps because all the attention became personally irritating. In some ways, we should be encouraged that Neumann relented, and so quickly. In tech, even this scrap of hypothetical humility feels invigorating, like an afternoon office IPA.\n\nBut then again, WeWork\u2019s recent troubles might only entrench its ironic, anticollectivist, winner-take-all market position. Much of the pressure to unseat Neumann came from SoftBank, the Japanese holding company that invested in WeWork via its $100 billion vision fund. That capital was raised partly from sovereign wealth funds (including from Saudi Arabia, which wants to diversify its economic prospects, currently bound largely to fossil fuels). SoftBank had the most to lose from WeWork\u2019s more than halved valuation in advance of the IPO, and it might have made new promises to the board in exchange for delaying a public offering. Neumann\u2019s resignation also gives SoftBank more time to regroup\u2014replacing a CEO will take time, and the company probably won\u2019t take another swing at an IPO before next year.", "description": "WeWork was supposed to reinvent office life.
