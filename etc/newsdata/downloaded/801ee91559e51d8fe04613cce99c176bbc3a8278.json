The offer had a retail value of more than $400, according to StubHub\u2019s FAQ page on the program.\n\nJust 500 \u201cseasoned tickets\u201d were made available to the public, and they didn\u2019t last for long. By Thursday afternoon, would-be purchasers who clicked a link to buy a ticket were directed to a message indicating the deal is already sold out.\n\n\u201cNo tickets...now what? We\u2019re all out of KFC Seasoned Tickets,\u201d the message reads, directing customers who missed out to place standard orders for KFC wings.\n\nThe \u201cseasoned ticket\u201d itself smells like fried chicken, according to KFC. Customers who managed to buy a ticket can also pick up their wings in-store, but can only get one order at the discounted rate per week.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if KFC and StubHub plan to offer additional \u201cSeasoned Tickets\u201d at any point. A standard order of 48 wings from KFC costs $36.99.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "Just 500 \u201cseasoned tickets\u201d were made available to the public, and they didn\u2019t last for long.", "authors": ["Thomas Barrabi"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/KFC-Seasoned-Tickets-GIF.gif?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
