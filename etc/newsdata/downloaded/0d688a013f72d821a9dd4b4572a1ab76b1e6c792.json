The photographer has been married to the novelist and travel editor Lee Tulloch for more than 30 years but says he proposed because marriage was \u201cthe most uncool thing you could do.\u201d\n\nThe couple were introduced by the late photographer Stuart Campbell in 1982. Amos was 19, Tulloch was 27 and Campbell was quite the matchmaker. \u201cHe called himself the Dolly Levi of Rose Bay,\u201d says Tulloch with a smile.\n\nHow we stay together: productive conflict, commitment and 48-hour holidays Read more\n\nAmos was in Sydney for some modelling and met Campbell on a photo shoot. Due to return to Melbourne, he dropped in to see the photographer at his home studio. Campbell was shooting a rock band, then a pair of drag queens showed up, followed by some film producers. \u201cStuart says \u2018these people are never going to leave\u2019.\u201d He offered to set Amos up with Tulloch, offering a description that didn\u2019t leave much to the imagination. \u201cAnd I\u2019m a 19-year-old boy so I go \u2018well that sounds alright.\u2019\u201d\n\nCampbell called Tulloch, insisting she come over. She was reluctant but eventually gave in. \u201cSo I arrived to see the rock band had gone and there were these two gay guys. And Tony. I thought, he\u2019s done it to me again, it\u2019s a room full of gay guys, because your gay best friends often do that. And I was so annoyed with him.\u201d\n\nHowever, she realised Amos wasn\u2019t gay, and soon the crowd trickled away. Campbell cooked dinner for the pair \u2013 then promptly went to bed, leaving them staring at each other.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Lee Tulloch and Tony Amos, photographed by Stuart Campbell in 1984. Photograph: Stuart Campbell\n\nAmos suggested they rearrange everything in the house as payback. For the next few hours, they took pictures off the walls, emptied out drawers and moved everything around. \u201cThe next day Stuart wakes up and asks \u2018What have you done to my house?\u2019,\u201d says Tulloch. \u201cThe fact that we had the same sense of humour, that immediately bonded us.\u201d\n\nThey became inseparable and, after two months of interstate visits, moved in together. It was risky but worth it, says Tulloch. \u201cEven though we hardly knew each other, there was some kind of faith [and a] common humour was established right then.\u201d\n\nAmos agrees. \u201c[There was] this very clear sense of being complicit in adventure, or misadventure. For me, I was just smitten.\u201d They were married two years later.\n\nThey were an unlikely couple. Their childhoods, for instance, were very different: Amos \u201cwent to school just to torture teachers\u201d, while Tulloch was \u201cMiss Goody Two Shoes\u201d. But his disdain for authority was attractive, says Tulloch. \u201cI was always being the good one. And I think he was being the bad [boy].\u201d\n\nAlthough they are very different people with different tastes, their personalities complement the other. \u201cSomeone who\u2019s like [Tony] does need a consistency somewhere in their life,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd from my point of view, I could really be a stick in the mud. But he\u2019s more adventurous ... his highs and lows are quite good for me, because I never know what he\u2019s actually going to do.\u201d\n\nAnother reason their relationship worked was because they were \u201cinterested in doing more than just sitting around establishing careers.\u201d At the time, Tulloch was working in fashion magazines while he was working at Speedo and dabbling in photography. Then Tulloch was appointed editor of Australian Harper\u2019s Bazaar. The job didn\u2019t last \u2013she was fired after nine issues for, in her words, \u201cbeing a little too creative\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s one of those things where you go, if you\u2019re not looking after this person, who are you looking after? Tony Amos\n\nThe couple decided to move overseas, so Amos could assist and learn from international photographers while Tulloch wrote her first novel. Their shared sense of adventure cemented their relationship. Says Tulloch: \u201cMy feeling has always been, if you want to do something, work out what it is, and then just do it. There is no reason not to do it, and you\u2019ll regret it if you don\u2019t. And sometimes it seems foolish in some ways. Years later I think, oh, maybe we should have done something else. But of course, we shouldn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThey settled in New York in 1985 and their daughter Lolita was born in 1988. \u201cThat\u2019s probably the most challenging time for a couple,\u201d says Tulloch. With their creative jobs, they could organise their lives around their child but it was tough on the relationship. \u201cYou\u2019re both concentrating on the baby. So of course there\u2019s less time you give to each other. And I think a lot of couples, when they\u2019re so bound up with each other, that\u2019s when it all can fall apart.\u201d\n\nAmos, who was 26 at the time, found it difficult. \u201cWhen [Lolita] was a baby, it was detrimental to my work at that point, because I was interested in watching this little thing grow.\u201d Eventually the couple returned to Australia, which added to the pressure. Says Amos: \u201cEverything for me was New York at that point, so when I came back out here, I went from New York to \u2018where am I?\u2019\u201d The only way through it was just to go through it. \u201cTime,\u201d says Amos. \u201cIt\u2019s just time, it\u2019s not optional.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Lee Tulloch and Tony Amos in New York\u2019s East Village in 1985. Photograph: Tony Amos\n\nThe couple learned how to deal with conflict, giving each other space and time when needed. Tulloch scoffs at that well-worn advice not to go to bed on an argument. \u201cForget that,\u201d she says. \u201cSometimes poking a nest with a stick is not a good idea. You are individual people, and you really just have to go away from each other. I guess it\u2019s a little bit of confidence that you\u2019ll come back.\u201d Amos agrees: \u201cI was raised with that [idea] if you love something, you have to give it room.\u201d\n\nBut they don\u2019t let the silences go on for too long. \u201cWe probably had to have little sessions to discuss it. And knowing that one will be upset that it\u2019s being raised, but usually, because we care about each other, we\u2019re trying to make it work.\u201d\n\nThey returned to New York a few years later and were living there on 11 September 2001. It was a devastating event for both of them. Their Chambers Street apartment was in the middle of ground zero and Tulloch witnessed the planes hitting the towers. \u201cI realised that I had PTSD. I really did, I was the one who saw it happen. I was the one who ran through the streets,\u201d she remembers.\n\nRelationships: tell us how you stay together Read more\n\nMeanwhile Amos, who had been away, couldn\u2019t get back into Manhattan. Tulloch couldn\u2019t get hold of him: \u201cWe were so apart. I remember going, where is he? I couldn\u2019t even phone him till the end of the day, because the phones went down. But I was probably a little bit like, \u2018why isn\u2019t he as upset as I am?\u2019 But he probably was in his own way, he was handling it differently.\u201d\n\nThe decision to move back to Australia again was difficult. \u201cThat was probably the toughest one because I think Tony was willing to give it a chance, and I was like, \u2018no, I can\u2019t see how it\u2019s going to work.\u2019\u201d In the long run, it brought them closer together. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those things where you go, if you\u2019re not looking after this person, who are you looking after?\u201d says Amos. \u201cIf you can\u2019t do that, what are you?\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Tony Amos, Lolita Amos and Lee Tulloch. Photograph: Robert Rosen/Tony Amos\n\nThey couple have always supported each other\u2019s careers. \u201cTony often says to me, whatever you need, if you have to do that now, that\u2019s what we are going to do,\u201d says Tulloch. And while they are individuals, they are also a team. \u201cI often look at other [successful] couples [who] are in the creative industry, it\u2019s very much the same thing. They totally respect each other\u2019s thing that they do, they allow them to do it.\u201d\n\nThey also work together on travel stories \u2013 she writes and produces while he shoots. She doesn\u2019t boss him around: \u201cThat wouldn\u2019t work,\u201d says Amos quickly. Instead she lets him get on with it \u201cBecause I know that he\u2019s good enough to do it himself. He doesn\u2019t need to be micromanaged.\u201d\n\nSo what\u2019s their secret for staying together? \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be looking for a life partner who is going to be your soulmate twin, a do-everything-together kind of love,\u201d says Tulloch. \u201cI think you really just have to say \u2018I like this about [this person], I can\u2019t change them and I\u2019m not going to try and change them, can I live with it?\u2019 That can be the decision.\u201d\n\nSign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\n\nAmos agrees: \u201cOne of the first things I recognised about Lee was that she\u2019s not interested in telling me what to be.\u201d He says there also has to be chemistry \u2013 both physical and intellectual \u2013 and curiosity. \u201cKnowing the other person is still curious and hungry in some way. I couldn\u2019t be with someone if I felt they had switched off.\u201d\n\nTheir advice is to get away from each other once in a while. Says Tulloch: \u201cJust go away and have another perspective and come back. A changing perspective is a very good thing, you get so familiar with each other, you know your own smell, you know what kind of things you\u2019re probably going to say. You have friends in common, what you like to eat. You need to have a break, you need to actually look at the person again in a fresh way.\u201d\n\nTulloch, who travels often in her job, says she misses Amos but it\u2019s worth it. \u201cI don\u2019t miss him when I\u2019m home, because he\u2019s in the next room working. But I certainly miss him when I\u2019m waiting to come home. So I think that\u2019s OK, you always look forward to coming home to that person. And unless you go away, you don\u2019t have that wonderful feeling.\u201d\n\nWe want to hear your stories about staying together.
