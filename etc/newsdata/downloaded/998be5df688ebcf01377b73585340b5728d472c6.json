Multiple witnesses can corroborate that,\u201d Etzebeth said in a statement following the incident.\n\nThe SAHRC believes he has a case to answer and on the day the South Africa lock plays against Italy it will lay a formal complaint with the Equality Court, which hears matters relating to unfair discrimination, hate speech and harassment.\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) has had a completed docket from a police investigation into the incident for over a month, but has not said if it will press charges.\n\nThe Equality Court can hear cases if the NPA does not prosecute and usually hands out fines or community service.\n\nSouth African Rugby, the sport\u2019s national governing body, has stood behind Etzebeth, with Springboks coach Rassie Erasmus saying he had accepted the player\u2019s version of events.\n\n\u201cAfter speaking to Eben and hearing his side of the story, there is obviously trust between a coach and a player,\u201d Erasmus told reporters before the team left for Japan.\n\n\u201cI must trust him to do some stuff on the field for me and win Test matches for us, and he must trust me to believe him when he tells me something.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty comfortable with what he\u2019s told me and obviously you can\u2019t just believe what someone else says on social media.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m confident that that\u2019s not the truth and if anything like that happens and it is the truth, then somebody like that would not be part of our team and would not go to the World Cup.\u201d", "description": "Springboks rugby player Eben Etzebeth could face legal action over an alleged assault after the South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) said on Wednesday it would ask the country's Equality Court to institute proceedings against him.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191003&t=2&i=1436549435&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF920F9-OZASP"}
