We have contributed China's wisdom and approach to the development and global governance of Internet.\n\nIn response to the expectations of all parties, Jointly Build a Community with a Shared Future in Cyberspace fully expounds on the background, fundamental principles, path to realization, and governance framework of the vision of building a community with a shared future in cyberspace. It calls on the international community to work together to promote development, address security challenges, and build cyberspace into a community where we can jointly advance development, safeguard security, participate in governance, and share the benefits.\n\nAs the Internet is developing at an amazing speed, the endeavor to build a community with a shared future in cyberspace must also move forward with the times. We encourage all parties to continue contributing their insights and efforts to enriching and developing this vision, and join hands to create an even brighter future for all human beings.\n\nOrganizing Committee of the World Internet Conference\n\nOctober 2019\n\nThe Internet today is growing at an incredible speed in ways that have enormously expanded people's work and living spaces. Cyberspace has become a new homeland for human beings, a place where all countries are getting increasingly interdependent, and a community of intertwined interests and shared future. It is therefore imperative for the international community to strengthen communication, broaden consensus, deepen cooperation, and embrace extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits in global governance. On matters that involve us all, we should discuss and look for a solution together. We should work hand in hand to build a community with a shared future in cyberspace where the Internet can deliver greater benefits to all the people.\n\nBackground\n\nToday's world is undergoing major development, adjustment and transformation. A new round of technological and industrial revolution is gaining momentum. Emerging markets and developing countries are rising rapidly. The exponential growth of the Internet has created an unprecedented opportunity for the progress of human civilization.\n\nIn the meantime, such problems as unbalanced development, inadequate rules and inequitable order have become more evident in the field of the Internet. Hegemony and power politics persist in cyberspace. Protectionism and unilateralism keep rearing their heads. The digital divide among countries and regions is widening. Privacy infringements, intellectual property rights violations, the rise of racism, spread of disinformation, Internet fraud, cyberterrorism and other illegal and criminal activities have become a global scourge.\n\nIn the face of these opportunities and challenges, the international community is committed to improving the use, development, and governance of the Internet and has made tireless efforts toward this end. China has not only benefited significantly from the global Internet development, but also made unremitting efforts to safeguard peace, promote development and maintain order in cyberspace. As a responsible major country of Internet development, China is always committed to the path of peaceful development and an open-up strategy featuring mutual benefits and win-win results. China advocates safeguarding sovereignty, security and development interests of all countries in cyberspace and has taken an active part in the process of global governance in cyberspace. China continues to promote international dialogues and exchanges in cyberspace and has engaged in experience sharing and practical cooperation through the Belt and Road Initiative. Through the World Internet Conference and other platforms that have been successfully built, China is playing an active role in building consensus and exploring good practices, so as to promote fairer and more equitable global Internet governance.\n\nTo build a community with a shared future in cyberspace is to make cyberspace a community where we can jointly advance development, safeguard security, participate in governance, and share the benefits. We call on the governments and people of all countries to follow the trend of the information age, seize the opportunities offered by digital, network and smart technologies, and tackle risks and challenges in cyberspace proactively, so that we can achieve shared development, ensure common security, realize joint governance, and enjoy benefits together.", "description": "Chinese President Xi Jinping unveiled the vision of building a community with a shared future in cyberspace at the second World Internet Conference in 2015.
