But in his hands, old, discarded hoses become works of art.\n\n\n\n\"The best way I know to put it is that's the one piece of equipment that's gonna go into the fire every time,\" he said.\n\n\n\nPaul, who served as a first responder in the aftermath of Hurricane Michael, first started turning strips of hoses into stars and stripes in 2015. It was a simple firehouse decoration that caught on like wildfire.\n\n\n\nNow, they are displayed all across the country, including the local burger joint where Paul takes his family. He's made more than 100 flags, many commissioned and each unique. One commemorates a firefighter's life, using a hose he once used.\n\nArtwork by Florida firefighter Daryl Paul. Daryl Paul\n\n\"You get these tears in the hose, you get burn marks in the house,\" Paul said. \"I really love the character.\"\n\n\n\nCharacter and a call to duty are attributes he feels everyone can get behind.\n\n\n\n\"In the country, there's a lot of divide. You got the left, you got the right. Really, that's the thing that unites us all. That's the banner we fly under,\" he said.", "description": "Daryl Paul first started turning strips of hose into stars and stripes in 2015", "authors": ["Manuel Bojorquez"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/15/e965535e-ac78-4ef5-8e7a-8059aaa1745f/thumbnail/1200x630/980ff21481c476dbfd60c024f4a6bd07/bojorquez-firefighter-intv-b-cam-rem302-frame-57776.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
