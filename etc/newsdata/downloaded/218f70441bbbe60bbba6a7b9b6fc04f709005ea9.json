Apple's decisions last week to accommodate the Chinese government by taking down HKMaps is deeply concerning,\" the septuplet wrote.\n\n\"We urge you in the strongest terms to reverse course, to demonstrate that Apple puts values above market access, and to stand with the brave men and women fighting for basic rights and dignity in Hong Kong.\"\n\nSee: China has Apple by the iPhones\n\nThe letter pointed out that Apple has censored over 2,200 apps in China, including removing VPN apps from its Chinese app store two years ago and apps designed to help the Uyghur and Tibetan people.\n\nIn removing HKmap.live, Apple claimed the app was being used to endanger law enforcement, an assertion rejected by the senators and congresspeople.\n\nThe letter also questioned Apple's stated intent of being in China, and that it could help change the country for the better.\n\n\"We, too, believe that diplomacy and trade can be democratizing forces. But when a repressive government refuses to evolve or, indeed, when it doubles down, cooperation can become complicity,\" it stated.\n\nThe septuple said the case raised concerns whether Apple and large US corporations would \"bow to growing Chinese demands rather than lose access to more than a billion Chinese consumers\".\n\nApple makes around $3 billion in revenue from China each month.\n\nAt the same time, a quintet of US politicians, including Wyden, Rubio, Ocasio-Cortz, Gallagher, and Malinowski, penned a similar letter [PDF] to Blizzard, over the company's decision to strip Ng Wai Chung of prize money and suspend the player after he expressed support for the Hong Kong protests.\n\n\"As China amplifies its campaign of intimidation, you and your company must decide whether to look beyond the bottom line and promote American values -- like freedom of speech and thought -- or give in to Beijing's demands in order to preserve market access,\" the quintet said.\n\n\"You have the opportunity to reverse course. We urge you to take it.\"\n\nBlizzard is partially owned by Chinese giant Tencent.\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nHong Kong protesters warn of Telegram feature that can disclose their identities\n\nMessage shared on discussion boards sparks panic among protesters.\n\nHong Kong ISPs oppose any government plans to restrict internet network\n\nIt has requested for government to seek industry consultation before any internet restrictions are made.\n\nTwitter steps in as China-backed accounts try to sway public opinion on Hong Kong\n\nTwitter has banned 936 accounts managed by the Chinese state and it will stop accepting ads paid for by state-run news agencies.\n\nTwitter bans 936 accounts managed by the Chinese state, aimed at Hong Kong protests\n\nTwitter will also stop accepting ads paid for by state-run news agencies.\n\nApple pulls HKmap.live from app store\n\nCupertino joins the likes of the NBA and Blizzard in kowtowing to Beijing.\n\nApple can uphold basic human rights or become a Beijing accomplice: HK lawmaker\n\nCharles Mok says HKmap.live is used by innocents to avoid police violence.", "description": "Apple told actions matter far more than words in a letter signed by four US Senators and three Congresspeople.", "authors": ["Chris Duckett"], "top_image": "https://zdnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/10/c55debf0-7fb8-4d13-82a1-8fba82d63b0b/thumbnail/770x578/c33d5d5dc9a0013483a76f67b19ec7dc/china.png", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
