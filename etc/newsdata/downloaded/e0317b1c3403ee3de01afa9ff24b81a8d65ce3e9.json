Hussam Al-Heraki is now living in Germany. He has starred in a short film, Halbnah which illustrates the challenges young refugees face in a new country.\n\nCunningham said Hussam had had a very difficult journey from Syria to Stuttgart and his positivity was incredible.\n\n\"This is the result of help. You have a bringing together of creativity, of art, of cross cultures. And when we cross cultures, everybody benefits,\" he explained. \"Separating people is a disaster, labelling people is a disaster. When you put people together, it takes away fear, it takes away distrust and this is why this man is my friend.\"\n\nHussam Al-Heraki is one of more than five million Syrians who have fled the country since war broke out in 2011.\n\nThe short film centrs around a refugee whose new German friends turn on him when they suspect him of stealing a bike. It will soon be available on YouTube.", "description": "Game of Thrones actor Liam Cunningham was reunited with a young syrian refugee he first befriended in Jordan in 2016", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/03/23/61/60/1000x563_cmsv2_a9d0f579-4098-59b7-a327-d527e23f8e71-3236160.jpg", "published_at": "2018-07-26"}
