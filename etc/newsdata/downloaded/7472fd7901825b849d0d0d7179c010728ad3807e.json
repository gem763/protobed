But there is no easy way back. It has to work. For Germans, the necessary realisation has to be that the euro is already working to their benefit, by stabilising their economy, despite its huge savings surpluses.\n\nIt cannot make those surplus savings highly remunerative, too, because the market does not need them. That is what it means to be in a global \u201cliquidity trap\u201d, with weak investment despite ultra-low interest rates: savings are not scarce but superabundant.\n\nWhat are the euro\u2019s benefits to Germany? An answer comes from a comparison with the economy that it most closely resembles: Japan\u2019s. Both were reborn from the ashes of the second world war as allies of the US and dynamic exporters of manufactures. They are the world\u2019s third and fourth largest economies. They also have the world\u2019s second- and third-highest median ages.\n\nGermany\u2019s fertility rate ranks 204th in the world, while Japan\u2019s ranks 209th. These then are relatively large and rapidly ageing high-income countries, with strong manufacturing.\n\nIn Japan, net capital outflows absorbed just a third of the private surplus, with the rest ending up in fiscal deficits. In Germany, capital outflows absorbed all the private surplus, since the government too ran fiscal surpluses. Financial Times\n\nNot surprisingly, both countries also have huge surpluses of private savings over investments. Between 2010 and 2017, the surplus of private savings over investment averaged some 7 per cent of gross domestic product in Germany and 8 per cent in Japan. The composition was different, however: the savings surplus of households was 72 per cent of Germany\u2019s overall private surplus, while the corporate sector\u2019s surplus was 76 per cent of Japan\u2019s.\n\nEven at ultra-low interest rates, domestic private investment fell far short of private savings. As a matter of arithmetic, either fiscal deficits or capital flows abroad had to absorb these excess savings.\n\nHere is where the difference emerged. In Japan, net capital outflows (by definition, the mirror image of the current account surplus) absorbed just a third of the private surplus, with the rest ending up in fiscal deficits. In Germany, capital outflows absorbed all the private surplus, since the government, too, ran fiscal surpluses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe difference was not German fiscal virtue and Japanese fiscal vice. Japan was, instead, compelled towards fiscal deficits, because generating and sustaining current account surpluses of 8 per cent of GDP, which would have been required otherwise, was unworkable: the real exchange rate was too unstable and foreign partners too hostile.\n\nGermany, however, has a stable and competitive real exchange rate. Close to 40 per cent of its exports of goods go to other eurozone countries. Here, the competitive position that Germany achieved in the early years of the eurozone is mostly still locked in.\n\nMoreover, the euro\u2019s exchange rate reflects the competitiveness of a weighted average of its users. These benefits have greatly facilitated Germany\u2019s desired combination of private, fiscal and trade surpluses. The euro made prudence work.\n\nJapan was compelled towards fiscal deficits because generating and sustaining current account surpluses of 8 per cent of GDP, which would have been required otherwise, was unworkable. Financial Times\n\nWhat would have happened if the German economy had not been sheltered by the eurozone? The Deutschemark would surely have appreciated hugely, this time in a low-inflation world. That would have pushed German domestic inflation below zero, damaged the profitability and performance of exports and inflicted losses on German financial institutions, with their huge foreign assets.\n\nIt would have made it impossible to preserve strongly positive nominal interest rates and probably impossible to avoid persistent fiscal deficits, too. In brief, the eurozone protected Germany from becoming another Japan. Germans should be thankful for what the euro has given them, praise Mario Draghi, outgoing ECB president, for his brave decisions to save the system from calamity and hope his successor Christine Lagarde will follow suit.\n\nInterest rates on German savings could not be significantly higher, whether it was inside or outside the eurozone. In today\u2019s economy, the only way for German savers to enjoy higher returns is for them to take more risk.\n\nAs a country, however, Germany could help to shift the balance of desired savings and investment worldwide. As the world economy slows and even Germany\u2019s economy shows signs of weakness, as foreign demand lags, the case for this grows.\n\nPolicymakers in Germany and elsewhere should promote public and private spending \u2014 investment, above all. Huge opportunities do seem to exist. Moreover, the chance to borrow at today\u2019s ultra-low long-term interest rates is a blessing, not a curse.\n\nBe ambitious. In today\u2019s economy, it is the only prudent thing to do. martin.wolf@ft.com\n\nFinancial Times", "description": "Rather than complaining about ECB policy, the Germans should be thankful for what the single currency, and Mario Draghi, have given it.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2648%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_109/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/fd1bc5c1e44b8cf0659eb7734c6dd0f9ebd8902a", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
