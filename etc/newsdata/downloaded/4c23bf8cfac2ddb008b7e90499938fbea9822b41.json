The president\u2019s (still) acting chief of staff briefed reporters Thursday and, in flagrante delicto, admitted Trump committed the sine qua non of a quid pro quo.\n\nMulvaney said there was \u201cno question\u201d that one of the reasons Trump withheld military aid to Ukraine was to force Ukraine to investigate \u201ccorruption\u201d related to the Democratic Party. \u201cAnd that is absolutely appropriate,\u201d Mulvaney argued. \u201cWe do that all the time with foreign policy.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThus did the White House admit \u2014 ipso facto \u2014 to the exact crime Trump is accused of in the impeachment inquiry. \u201cNo quid pro quo\u201d became \u201cquid pro quo \u2014 so?\u201d (a.k.a. quid apropos).\n\nMulvaney\u2019s modus operandi is clear enough: The White House must be in extremis realizing that depositions to Congress by administration officials are proving a de facto quid pro quo. Trump needs a new defense.\n\nTo be fair, Mulvaney didn\u2019t admit a quid pro Joe (trading military aid for dirt on the Democratic front-runner) but a quid pro down-low (trading military aid for dirt supporting a conspiracy theory about Democrats). Still, the transcript of Trump\u2019s call with the Ukrainian president makes clear it was a quid pro combo.\n\nAD\n\nIn a sense, Mulvaney is correct when he says \u201cwe do that all the time.\u201d Trump\u2019s tenure has been one big quid pro. He decreed Thursday that next year\u2019s Group of Seven gathering of world leaders must be at the Doral resort he owns in a clear quid pro cash flow for the Trump Organization. His funneling of government business to Mar-a-Lago has been a quid pro chateau. Having the U.S. military patronize his Scotland property is a quid pro Glasgow, and Vice President Pence\u2019s hawking of Trump\u2019s Ireland property is a blatant quid pro brogue. Trump\u2019s Washington hotel rakes in lobbyists\u2019 and foreign governments\u2019 cash in a quid pro dough, and government funds paid to his New York and New Jersey properties complete the quid pro portfolio.\n\nAD\n\nThis benefits not only Trump but his sons, in what might be called a quid pro slow (or a quid pro I dunno). Donald Trump Jr.\u2019s protests about Biden family nepotism this week, while ignoring his own, can only be termed a quid pro bozo. Trump\u2019s national security adviser, Robert O\u2019Brien, last week, floated a quid pro whistleblow: He\u2019s clearing out career professionals (prospective whistleblowers) by slashing the NSC staff. The administration also tried to block cooperation with the inquiry, in a quid pro Pompeo. And then there\u2019s Trump\u2019s decision to let Rudy Giuliani take over U.S. foreign policy: a quid pro schmoe.\n\nMulvaney, in his appearance Thursday, attempted a quid pro John Doe, pretending that he didn\u2019t know the names of the officials testifying to Congress. The attorney general, William Barr, has trashed his principles to give Trump a quid pro ego.\n\nAD\n\nTrump has been doing this sort of thing since a quid pro big toe kept him out of Vietnam. He abandoned gun-safety plans after meeting with the NRA, a quid pro ammo. His voter-suppression efforts are a quid pro Jim Crow. In a quid pro Kudlow, he convinced free-market conservatives to embrace a trade war. His tax cut, a quid pro CEO, ballooned the debt in a quid pro borrow. Evangelical Christians tolerate his immorality in exchange for his judicial nominees, a quid pro Roe . He paid hush money to Stormy Daniels, a quid pro lie low. Much of his presidency has been a quid pro Moscow.\n\nAD\n\nHe trades in false claims (quid pro Pinocchio) and plugs for friendly Fox News hosts (quid pro puppet show). And his requiring of constant flattery from underlings (quid pro braggadocio) has turned the West Wing into a quid pro freak show.\n\nBecause impeachment has made us all Latin speakers, I asked my longtime classics consultant, Vanessa, to translate into genuine Latin some of Trump\u2019s trade-offs:\n\nAD\n\nQuid pro impendio (this for payment).\n\nQuid pro deverticulo (this for a resort).\n\nQuid pro luto (this for dirt).\n\nQuid pro vitio (this for a crime).\n\nQuid pro reo (this for a sinner).\n\nQuid pro imperio (this for power).\n\nGiving Giuliani responsibility for anything? A blatant quid pro asino (this for a fool). But that\u2019s pro forma for a president who sold his soul (quid pro animo) and made his office a quid pro mimo: this for a farce.\n\nAD\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Trump is going to need a new defense.", "authors": ["Dana Milbank", "Op-Ed Columnist Covering National Politics"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/R5y0tUMY9Qgnogx0eGytnAFbq0I=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/D4FGHXXRZMI6TNSIO26PQ3VWPY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
