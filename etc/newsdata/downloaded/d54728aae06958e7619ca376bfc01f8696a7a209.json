The deal could ease North Korea\u2019s chronic power shortages.\n\nAccording to the Association of China Rare Earth Industry, building a solar power plant capable of producing 2.5 million kilowatts of electricity each day in inland areas like North Pyongan would cost around $2.5 billion. China\u2019s reward for investing would be mining rights to a rare earth mine on the province\u2019s borders.\n\nA source close to the Chinese rare earth industry told Reuters that this type of agreement is \u201cwishful thinking\u201d on behalf of North Korea. The source was skeptical about the real level of Chinese interest in the project.\n\nAlso on rt.com What are rare earth metals & why they are China's \u2018nuclear option\u2019 in trade war with US\n\n\u201cInvesting in North Korea is not safe. Its international reputation is poor and many companies will not necessarily be interested,\u201d the source said.\n\nUN Security Council resolution 2270, adopted shortly after North Korea\u2019s fourth nuclear test in 2016, bans the country\u2019s exports of gold, titanium ore, vanadium ore, and rare earth minerals.\n\nRare earths or rare metals are a group of 17 chemical elements with special characteristics. They are actually not rare, despite their name, but they are difficult to find in desirable concentrations and are hard to process, as the ores often contain naturally occurring radioactive materials such as uranium and thorium.\n\nAlso on rt.com US & Australia to unveil rare earths plan to challenge China\u2019s dominance\n\nMetals and alloys that contain them are used in many devices that people use every day, such as computers, DVDs, rechargeable batteries, cell phones, catalytic converters, magnets, and fluorescent lighting.\n\nThe escalating US-China trade conflict has raised concerns about the measures each side could end up taking, including Beijing\u2019s option to restrict the export of rare earth metals. This is considered one of Beijing\u2019s nuclear options in its battle with Washington, as China is the world\u2019s top producer of rare earth metals and holds the largest reserves.\n\nFor more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section", "description": "North Korea to give China right to mine rare earths in return for investment in solar plants \u2013 report", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdni.rt.com/files/2019.10/article/5db17bad85f54024b241359f.JPG", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
