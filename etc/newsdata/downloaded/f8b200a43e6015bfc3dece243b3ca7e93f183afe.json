And consumption is going up all the time.\n\n\u201c(There\u2019s) a conundrum \u2013 how do we shift ourselves from consuming? We need to do more about learning to live sustainably. We talk about sustainability but we don\u2019t really know what it means.\u201d\n\nSir Ian also called for the creation of a \u201cnet zero ministry\u201d, which he said could work across government to vet the policies of all departments to ensure they are working to a common environmental framework. He noted this type of cross-departmental arrangement already exists with the Brexit ministry, which vets Brexit decisions.\n\nSir Ian said technology would be an essential element in reducing our impact on the planet, but indicated the biggest challenge would be in reducing rates of consumption.\n\nHe added: \u201cWe\u2019ve got to reduce demand to a much greater extent than we have in the past, and if we don\u2019t reduce demand we\u2019re not going to reduce emissions.\n\n\u201cEmissions are a symptom of consumption and unless we reduce consumption we\u2019ll not reduce emissions.\u201d\n\nBut Josh Burke, a policy fellow at LSE\u2019s Grantham Institute for Research told The Independent their research has indicated achieving net zero and maintaining economic growth are not mutually exclusive.\n\n\u201cWe probably shouldn\u2019t scrap GDP entirely, but it is a fairly blunt instrument in that it doesn\u2019t take into account natural capital or social capital for example,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIn New Zealand they decided to augment GDP with these additional metrics, so they record natural and social capital and those are the kinds of things we can do too.\u201d\n\nHe said the institute\u2019s research concluded it was possible to have sustainable growth at the same time as transitioning to a low-carbon economy.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the pace of technological change, in particular the falling cost of renewables, and lessons from past technological transformations, then it does appear possible to reduce carbon and maintain growth.\u201d\n\nHe also warned against placing too great a burden on consumers, and instead said policy must lead the way towards net zero rather than trying to make people feel guilty about their habits.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to consumers there will have to be some changes in lifestyle, but the emphasis that we place on the consumer in this debate is a red herring,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWith other social issues we don\u2019t place as much emphasis on individuals for inequality or homelessness. When it comes to climate change we always think of the consumer as having a huge role to play. They have a role to play, but we should place the emphasis on the role of government, institutions and the private sector. For me they are going to deliver this change.\n\n\u201cConsumers will have to fly a little bit less, eat 20 per cent less red meat, and do those kinds of things, but that doesn\u2019t mean doom and gloom. A lot of these changes will benefit them. We\u2019re going to have to stop driving combustion engine vehicles, but ultimately the cost of that will be a lot less in the future. We\u2019ll have to heat our homes less, but then our bills will be less, because we\u2019ll have better insulation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite difficult for governments to tell consumers what to do. There\u2019s a moral quandary in all this in that, it\u2019s easy for us to say to people \u2018don\u2019t buy the cheap things\u2019, but there are also lots of people who can\u2019t afford to buy alternatives.\n\n\u201cDo we have a right to say to consumers who can\u2019t really afford to buy greener alternatives to go and do so?\u201d\n\nSpeaking about Sir Ian\u2019s suggestion of a net zero ministry, Mr Burke said social scientists would back the creation of such a body.\n\n\u201cOne of the problems with climate policy and with policy more generally is there\u2019s a lack of cross-departmental collaboration and people tend to work in silos. So we fully endorse a broader working group\u2026 There is precedent for such a thing and it\u2019d be welcome.\u201d\n\nThe Independent contacted Defra for comment, and was given the same quote as the BBC, which despite asking does not address many of the issues raised by Sir Ian including measuring societies\u2019 success by GDP, or whether it supported the creation of a \u201cnet zero ministry\u201d.\n\nA Defra spokesperson said: \u201cThe impact of climate change is clear and demands urgent action from countries around the world. The UK has already shown global leadership by becoming the first major economy to legislate for net zero emissions by 2050 \u2013 but we know there is more to do.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re reforming farming policy to reward environmental actions, reviewing our food system to ensure it is more sustainable, taking steps to accelerate tree-planting and peatland restoration, and introducing a flagship Environment Bill to address the biggest environmental priorities of our age.\u201d", "description": "The UK cannot reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by the target of 2050 while ministers remain fixed on growth as measured by GDP, the government\u2019s chief environment scientist has warned.
