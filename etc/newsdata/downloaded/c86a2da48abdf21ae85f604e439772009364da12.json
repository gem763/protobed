It did for the hotel clerk - a young Korean man in his 30s - at the Westin Chosun Hotel in central Seoul, who was checking Rainer Fried in, the associate director of the \u201cPhantom of the Opera\u201d last week after he realized that the show was coming to Korea for the first time in seven years.Fried calls this \u201cphenomenon,\u201d a \u201clove affair.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s like Koreans have had an ongoing and continuing love affair with \u2018Phantom,\u2019 and in between they have flings with other shows, but always come back to \u2018Phantom,\u2019\u201d said Fried, chuckling. \u201cIt\u2019s like coming back to their ex because they know that this is the best. That is why we are unable to get away from each other. We might as well get married now.\u201dThe original production of the \u201cPhantom of the Opera,\u201d which premiered in Korea seven years ago, is making a comeback with some new cast members, premiering in Busan first on Dec. 13 and arriving at Seoul\u2019s Blue Square next March. It will then move down to Daegu in July for about two months. To announce that the longest running show on Broadway is coming back to tour three different cities in Korea for nine months starting in December, the show\u2019s three lead actors - Jonathan Roxmouth playing the Phantom of the Opera, Claire Lyon playing Christine Daae and Matt Leisy playing Raoul - as well as Associate Director Fried and Musical Director David Andrews Rogers visited Seoul for a press conference on Oct. 10 and a showcase held for fans at Everland in Yongin, Gyeonggi, the following day.Lyon is familiar to Korean musical fans as she played Christine in 2012 when \u201cPhantom of the Opera\u201d premiered in Seoul to celebrate the show\u2019s 25th anniversary. As an experienced performer in Korea, she told her colleagues that \u201cKoreans know how to do musical theater,\u201d and that Korea has \u201csuch an educated audience,\u201d intensifying her co-stars\u2019 excitement.\u201cI\u2019ve been looking forward to coming to Korea for a very, very long time,\u201d said Roxmouth. \u201cOne of my other colleagues back home who also experienced Korea said to me that performing in Korea will change the way I think about theater, so I am very much looking forward to [it].\u201dRoxmouth, who has played at least six different lead roles in Andrew Lloyd Webber\u2019s musicals, describes \u201cThe Phantom of the Opera\u201d as a show that\u2019s \u201cgenuine.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s very rare to see a show of this scale that presents a genuine acting challenge that isn\u2019t rooted in stage tricks,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about what the actor can do to expose vulnerabilities as opposed to relying on sets and things that don\u2019t involve storytelling. It\u2019s very important for the actor to get the balance right in telling the story as well as giving the audience their money\u2019s worth in what they see and what they feel. But if the actor isn\u2019t the main conduit of the truth of the story, it\u2019s not the great piece of theater. \u2018Phantom\u2019 gets all of that right.\u201dPlaying Phantom may be intimidating for some actors because they are inevitably compared to Michael Crawford, the original star of the Phantom. \u201cIf you can be sure what you are doing is something that only you can do, then that is what you should be doing,\u201d said Roxmouth. \u201cThere are certain moments in the show that you realize they are written that way for the Phantom because of Michael Crawford. But that\u2019s it. The writing is strong enough to withstand anybody doing that role and the story will come out exactly the same.\u201dSince it\u2019s coming to Korea for the second time, will there be any changes?\u201cNo,\u201d Fried confirms.\u201cWhat\u2019s really miraculous about this show is that it opened in London in 1986 and moved to Broadway, but it actually never changed,\u201d he said. \u201cThat rarely happens with any show that opens. Usually, you have an opening night, you take it to West End, and then to Broadway, for example, and usually there are a lot of changes. That\u2019s a good thing too. I\u2019m not saying one thing is better than the other. But the special thing about \u2018The Phantom of the Opera\u2019 was that it actually never really changed. They just got it right from the start.\u201dFried says he almost feels like the show \u201cresists change\u201d - whenever the creative team tried to make slight changes, \u201cit [is] as if the show is telling us \u2018leave me alone.\u2019\u201d\u201cUsually the show is right, because it just works better when it\u2019s left as it is,\u201d he added.That is why the actors and the creative team believe the show has become the longest-running musical on Broadway, and can be enjoyed by all generations.\u201cIt\u2019s like a family heirloom for many people,\u201d said Roxmouth. \u201cIt\u2019s passed down and our story is no different to my grandfather\u2019s.\u201dLeisy believes the reason why the musical \u201ccan stay relevant and in the hearts of so many fans for over 30 years is because it speaks so many universal themes like love, loss, betrayal, jealousy - which human beings can connect to.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s something for everyone,\u201d he said, \u201cwherever you are in your life. It just speaks to everybody and it\u2019s a great treat to be a part of something that is so epic.\u201dOne thing is brand new though, says Fried, and that is the set. \u201cSo basically, it\u2019s a new set [that looks] exactly like the old set,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s technically reworked so it can now, finally, after all these years, travel to cities that we were never able to go to before because of technical requirements that were too complex for those theaters.\u201d\u201cSo what the audience in Korea will see is exactly what they\u2019ll want to see in \u2018The Phantom of the Opera.\u2019\u201dBY YIM SEUNG-HYE [sharon@joongang.co.kr]Tickets for the Busan show at Busan Dream Theatre went on sale on Oct. 16, while tickets for the Seoul show go on sale today.
