It houses private office suites, networking lounges and collaborative work spaces.\n\nWith more than 80 per cent of units in Midtown Bay allocated to one- and two-bedroom apartments, Guocoland general manager Dora Chng said this makes up for the lack of smaller units in the area.\n\nAnalysts expect the development to be well-received due to its location and quality of the homes.\n\n\"I think anything below S$2 million in the city area is considered affordable,\" said Eugene Lim, key executive officer of marketing agent ERA Realty.\n\n\"People will see the value for money because of the attention to detail given to the apartments of Midtown Bay,\" he added.\n\nMeanwhile, PropNex Realty's head of luxury team Dominic Lee said that Midtown Bay has positioned itself as a unique product.\n\n\"It's exciting as we have not seen many products like this. It caters to a new generation of people who don't have to work in the office, and gives them the opportunity to work within a network to meet new people,\" said Mr Lee.\n\nGuocoland has also been awarded the Tan Quee Lan Street site in September for S$800.19 million (S$1,535 per square foot per plot ratio), adding close to 1.5 million sq ft of total gross floor area on top of Guoco Midtown.\n\nAnd with the site sitting above Bugis MRT station, it gives the developer more flexibility to build a link between the MRT station and Guoco Midtown.\n\nThe upcoming development at the Tan Quee Lan site will focus on luxury family apartments, given its connectivity to several schools in the vicinity, said Mr Cheng.\n\nGuoco Midtown and Midtown Bay are set to be completed in 2022.\n\nGuocoland's last residential development launch was Meyer Mansion, which has sold 31 units to date and continues to see consistent sales, said the developer.", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Real Estate - GUOCOLAND will open the sale and viewing of units for its 99-year leasehold Midtown Bay on Oct 5, with prices starting from S$1.38 million for a one-bedroom unit and S$2.08 million for a two-bedder.\u00a0 .
