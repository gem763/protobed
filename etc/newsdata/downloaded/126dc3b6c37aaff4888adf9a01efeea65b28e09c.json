Oil majors Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp advanced more than 3.4%.\n\nFrom a stock perspective, the supply disruptions should put a bid into U.S. energy stocks, which have meaningfully lagged the broader market, JPM analysts wrote in a note.\n\n\"In particular, we could see a positive move in the oily small and mid-cap group,\" the analysts wrote.\n\nThe S&P 500 energy sector's 5.6% rise this year was much below the 20% climb for broader S&P 500.\n\nMeanwhile, shares of airlines and cruise line operators dropped in anticipation of higher fuel costs. American Airlines Group Inc, Delta Air Lines Inc and Carnival Corp fell between 3% and 5%.\n\nInvestors' flight to safety lifted gold prices, the Japanese yen and sent the U.S. benchmark 10-year Treasury bond yields down sharply from their multi-week highs.\n\nInterest-rate sensitive banks such as Bank of America Corp , Citigroup Inc, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Morgan Stanley were down more than 1%.\n\nThis week's centerpiece is the Federal Reserve's monetary policy decision on Wednesday where the central bank is widely expected to deliver the second interest rate cut this year of a quarter basis points.\n\nHints on whether the central bank will keep easing its monetary policy will be crucial in determining how long Wall Street's strong rally will last.\n\nCooling trade tensions between the United States and China last week has brought the benchmark S&P 500 less than 1% below its record high.\n\nAt 8:26 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were down 89 points, or 0.33%. S&P 500 e-minis were down 9.25 points, or 0.31% and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 39.75 points, or 0.5%.\n\nAmong other movers, General Motors Co fell 2.4% after the United Auto Workers (UAW) went on strike on Sunday, the first nationwide strike at GM in 12 years.
