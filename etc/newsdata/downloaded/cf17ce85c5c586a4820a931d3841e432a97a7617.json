Elijah Cummings said somebody once told him he would see one guy when he sat down with President Donald Trump \u201cand then you might see another guy\u201d the next day.\n\nCummings eventually saw that other side of Trump \u2014 the one who called the longtime Baltimore-area congressman a \u201cbrutal bully\u201d and his district a \u201cdisgusting, rat and rodent infested mess.\u201d That was after the burley Cummings, as chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, angrily berated a Homeland Security official at a congressional hearing on the administration\u2019s policy of separating migrant families at the southern border.\n\nCummings, who died Thursday at age 68 of complications from chronic health issues, refused to respond in kind. Instead, he invited Trump to come see the district for himself.\n\nTrump on Thursday had nothing but praise for Cummings, tweeting that he was a \u201chighly respected\u201d leader whose voice \u201cwill be very hard, if not impossible, to replace.\u201d He ordered that U.S. flags fly at half-staff through Friday out of respect for the congressman.\n\nRelations between the veteran Democratic lawmaker and the Republican political newcomer seemed to get off to a positive start just a few weeks after Trump took office.\n\nThe two met in the Oval Office in March 2017 to discuss legislation Cummings and other lawmakers planned to offer to help lower prescription drug prices, an interest the two men shared. Cummings told reporters afterward that the issue had come up when he ran into Trump at the president\u2019s inaugural lunch in January and they agreed to talk more.\n\nTrump was \u201centhusiastic\u201d about the proposal, Cummings said , and Trump tweeted about the \u201cGreat discussion!\u201d they\u2019d had. A White House statement said Trump had expressed to Cummings his interest in working in a \u201cbipartisan fashion\u201d to help make prescription drugs more affordable.\n\nBut the relationship collapsed after the drug proposal stalled, voters put Democrats in control of the House in the 2018 elections and Cummings, in his new role as chairman, ramped up oversight of a White House that had faced scant scrutiny when Republicans ran the chamber.\n\nAt the time of his death, Cummings was among the House committee chairmen leading an impeachment inquiry Trump has denounced as \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d\n\nOn its own, Cummings\u2019 committee was examining conflict-of-interest issues involving Trump\u2019s hotel in Washington and family members serving in the White House. It also was looking into how the White House, and Trump, approved security clearances, including for Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner.\n\nThe committee also heard testimony from Michael Cohen, Trump\u2019s former personal attorney, a key figure in federal law enforcement probes of potential coordination between Russia and Trump\u2019s campaign, and campaign finance violations involving hush money paid to women who said they had had intimate relationships with Trump. Trump has denied those relationships.\n\nCummings had also reviewed the administration\u2019s treatment of migrant children after they were separated from adults who brought them to the border.\n\nRep. Brenda Lawrence, D-Mich., who served on Cummings\u2019 committee, said the chairman believed in his constitutional responsibility to keep watch over the executive branch.\n\n\u201cHe was so committed to protecting our democracy,\u201d Lawrence told The Associated Press in a telephone interview Thursday. \u201cHe did not take his role lightly.\u201d\n\nIn response to the series of July attacks by Trump, Cummings invited the president to tour his district , from the poorest parts of the majority-black city of Baltimore to the more well-off areas in suburban Baltimore and Howard counties.\n\n\u201cCome to Baltimore. Do not just criticize us, but come to Baltimore and I promise you, you will be welcomed,\u201d the lawmaker said in August in his first public comments about the president\u2019s criticism. Trump had also complained about other cities run by Democrats he did not name. The comments were widely seen as a race-centered attack on big cities with minority populations.\n\nTrump defended his comments, which were widely condemned, before moving on from Cummings. He also said he would visit Baltimore \u201cat the right time.\u201d\n\nThat turned out to be in September, when he addressed House Republicans holding their annual retreat in the city . But Trump did not meet with any city officials or otherwise tour the city while there.\n\nIn a subsequent August appearance at the National Press Club , Cummings recalled being interviewed by a newspaper reporter who said he was Trump\u2019s \u201cworst nightmare.\u201d Cummings, the son of sharecroppers who rose to become a civil rights champion and leading member of Congress, said he explained that that was not his intention.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018You know, I\u2019m doing my job,'\u201d Cummings said. \u201cI said the president is probably a nice guy but I love my democracy. I love my country and I love my countrymen more.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Darlene Superville on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/dsupervilleap", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Rep.
