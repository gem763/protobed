The below hourly chart of the Wall Street 30 highlights the \u2018whipsaw\u2019 type index price behaviour post the release of these minutes.\n\nDOW - FOMC minutes\n\nSome key takeaways from the FOMC meeting are as follows:\n\nAt the last meeting, the economic outlook was viewed as positive\n\nThe ongoing trade war is increasing the downside risks to the economic outlook\n\nData post the meeting has deteriorated slightly\n\nThe FED did not give a firm indication of further easing\n\nMarkets are however pricing in a rate cut at this monthly meeting, 25 basis points (0.25%) moving the Federal Funds rate range to 1.5% to 1.75%\n\nWhat to watch when trading the Wall Street 30 today\n\nWall Street 30 daily chart technical view\n\nWall Street 30 daily chart\n\nToday will mark the start of renewed talks between the US and China around trade policy. Trade negotiations have been a key narrative in markets for more than a year now and if there is one thing markets have learnt, it\u2019s that the uncertainty relating to talks provide a greater propensity for volatility. Traders will want to keep a close eye on the talks for signs of trade progression (positive for equity markets) or digression (negative for equity markets).There has also been a tendency for US President Donald Trump to provide an off-script narration via Twitter to these events. In turn, day traders might find merit in following the @realDonaldTrump handle for real-time intraday directional catalysts on the Wall Street Index.This afternoon will also see the release of the month on month (CPI) data, another key market data point. US policymakers have been trying to stimulate stagnant inflation within the region. Forecasts suggest CPI data will be realised at 0.1% month on month and core CPI at 0.2% month on month.\n\nThe Wall Street 30 is currently consolidating between the 25970 (support) and 26650 (resistance) levels. Circled red we see a bullish engulfing candle pattern forming off the support of this range. The reversal (should it confirm with a close) suggests a move back to resistance at 26650. A break above this level (confirmed with a close) would call for a move to the next level of resistance considered at 27060. Should the index price instead move to close below range support (25970) the bullish range setup would no longer be valid and a move towards the next level of support at 25730 would then be favoured.\n\nOriginal post", "description": "Market Overview Analysis by Shaun Murison covering: .
