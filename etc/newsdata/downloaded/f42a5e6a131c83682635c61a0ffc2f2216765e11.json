It was not a flippant, one-off comment, as the prime minister has used the words at least eight times in the House of Commons. He also told Conservative MPs that he was determined to continue using those words.\n\nLabour MPs are wise to this but fear that it is already \u201ccutting through\u201d to voters, as electoral strategists say, not just through the traditional media but clipped versions of Johnson\u2019s speeches spreading through social media.\n\n'Man with no shame': the papers on Boris Johnson's performance in the Commons Read more\n\nThousands of comments below the prime minister\u2019s Facebook posts congratulate him for his approach to Brexit, while pro-Brexit commentators and even some far-right activists such as Tommy Robinson and Katie Hopkins amplify his message.\n\nThe rhetoric is also spreading throughout the media via anonymous \u201csenior government source\u201d quotes distributed variously to political journalists. Using outlandish, eye-catching metaphors, these sources try to make the phrase \u201csurrender bill\u201d enter the public consciousness in the same way that the Vote Leave slogans about \u201ctaking back control\u201d and spending \u201c\u00a3350m on the NHS\u201d.\n\nThis is the hallmark of Dominic Cummings, the former Vote Leave architect who is now Johnson\u2019s most senior adviser. Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, has also highlighted its similarities with the language of rightwing populist demagogues such as Donald Trump. \u201cHe is whipping up division with language that\u2019s indistinguishable from the far right,\u201d the Labour leader said in his conference speech this week.\n\nAfter Wednesday night\u2019s fractious debate over Johnson\u2019s inflammatory language, several MPs say death threats and abuse got worse overnight. An explanation of what is occurring came from Jess Phillips, the Labour MP and women\u2019s rights campaigner.\n\n\u201cThe use of language yesterday and over the past few weeks, such as the surrender bill, such as invoking the war, such as betrayal and treachery, it has clearly been tested, and workshopped and worked up and entirely designed to inflame hatred and division,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI get it, it works, it is working. It is not sincere, it is totally planned, it is completely and utterly a strategy designed by somebody to harm and cause hatred in our country.\u201d\n\nNo 10 is now entirely in campaign mode, with every action designed to get Johnson closer to securing a mandate to carry out the type of Brexit that he wants. His aggressive language now looks to have put paid to the chances of finding any consensus across the Commons with Labour MPs on a Brexit deal, even if he were to bring back a fresh offer from Brussels. He may even ramp up his clash with the judiciary by refusing to seek an extension in line with the Benn bill and forcing the courts to impose one on him.\n\nAfter that, the opposition have said they will give him the election that he now appears to be intent on. But his culture war on MPs is a high-risk strategy for the Conservatives that could end up backfiring if outrage over his divisive behaviour starts to overshadow his messaging on Brexit and domestic policies.", "description": "Boris Johnson\u2019s rhetoric part of strategic push to whip up public anger and force election", "authors": ["Rowena Mason"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/102522559cf20a3cb89e6fa879fd5826aee04825/94_410_2711_1626/master/2711.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f79d9ef0e2ea055e7de74e23671723c2", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
