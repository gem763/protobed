USA TODAY\n\nFrom appearing to confuse Buenos Aires with the Falkland Islands to mistaking a falafel for a loofah, former Fox News host Bill O'Reilly has had his share of factual fumbles through the years. Tuesday, the conservative commentator was shredded on social media for questioning the existence of a woman who turned out to be very real.\n\nO'Reilly was sharing his thoughts about the Democratic debate in Ohio on his Twitter feed \u2013 calling it a \"Trump bashing festival\" and accusing former Vice President Joe Biden of sleeping \u2013 when he expressed doubts over former Rep. Beto O'Rourke's claim that he met a woman working four jobs to try to make ends meet.\n\n\"Beto says he met a woman working FOUR jobs. And raising a special needs child. I don\u2019t believe him.

One Fox News analyst settled her case for $32 million.\n\n'We'll do it live!': Famous and infamous moments from Bill O'Reilly's career\n\nMore: Bill O'Reilly is 'mad at God' for sexual harassment scandal\n\nThis is her.
