The attorneys representing Braid are from the New York-based Center for Reproductive Rights.\n\nThe measure requires medical providers to tell women who are taking medication to end their pregnancies that the process can be reversed after they take the first of two pills.\n\nThe lawsuit contends the claim isn\u2019t supported by scientific evidence.\n\nThe law goes into effect Nov. 1. A federal judge in North Dakota blocked a similar law earlier this month.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "An abortion rights group is challenging a new law in Oklahoma that would allow doctors who perform medication abortions to face felony charges for not informing women about the possibility of reversing the process.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
