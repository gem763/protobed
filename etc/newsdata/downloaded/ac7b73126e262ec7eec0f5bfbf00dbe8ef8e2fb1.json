We all are.\u201d\n\nHe added that hospitals \u2013 desperate for income \u2013 were discharging patients who need to stay in the hospital system back to GPs so they can boost their income.\n\nDr Richard Vautrey, BMA GP committee chair, said: \u201cRecruitment efforts have been significant over recent years, but despite these efforts, we are still desperately short of GPs across the UK.\n\n\u201cDespite their best efforts, surgeries are struggling to fill vacancies making it hard to cope with growing patient demand.\n\n\u201cThis leaves teams demoralised, and communities frustrated as they wait longer to get the care they need.\n\n(Image: Adam Gerrard/Daily Mirror)\n\n\"It\u2019s encouraging that more junior doctors than ever before are choosing to specialise in general practice, but it\u2019s important to realise they cannot be trained overnight.\n\n\u201cMore work needs to be done to retain existing, hard-working GPs while we wait for reinforcement.\n\n\u201cThe BMA has long called for more resources to encourage GPs to stay. So every effort must be made to ensure general practice, and patient care, is protected now and in the future.\u201d\n\nThe Labour Party is already committed to ending the crisis that is only going to get worse.\n\nThe party took a big step at its party conference by pledging to launch a recruitment drive, aiming to restore the 1,600 axed local doctors by introducing thousands more GP training places every year.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nShadow Health Secretary Jon Ashworth said: \u201cYears of Tory cuts have been piling the pressure on our exhausted GPs and patients have been left waiting longer and longer just to see a doctor.\n\n\u201cFixing the crisis in the NHS starts with training more doctors and nurses and making sure our NHS has all of the cash it needs.\n\n\u201cWe will expand GP training places to 5,000 a year helping deliver 27 million extra GP appointments there for you and your family when needed.\u201d\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nWest Yorkshire Labour MP Yvette Cooper said: \u201cPeople are waiting far too long for GP appointments.\n\n\u201cOne of my constituents was told he had to wait eight weeks for an appointment even though he had possible cancer symptoms. It\u2019s not good enough.\n\n\u201cOur NHS is vital and only Labour will stand up for the NHS\u201d.\n\nOAP was left deaf for three months after waiting list shock at surgery\n\n(Image: Internet Uknown)\n\nA pensioner threatened to sue his GP after learning he faced a 12-week wait for treatment that left him almost deaf.\n\nGraham Jones, 76, says he has needed ear irrigation for over a decade to help with a hearing problem but was left stunned when he was told there was a waiting list.\n\nThe retired councillor said: \u201cIt was horrendous. I had to try to lip-read. My hearing aid wouldn\u2019t even work.\n\n\u201cIt made me really angry. Over the last 10 years I\u2019ve just made an appointment, gone in and it\u2019s been done. Suddenly I was told there was a three-month waiting list.\u201d At one point Mr Jones \u201cseriously considered\u201d suing the practice if he had had an accident as a result of his deafness.\n\nHe said government funding to his local practice in North Norfolk had been cut in the past five years, as patient numbers rose after new homes were built. Mr Jones said his surgery had been left more than \u00a3400,000 short of the funding it needed.\n\n\u201cI know two ladies in their 80s who have had to pay \u00a380 to have their ears irrigated privately. I got an appointment after three months. I refused to pay \u2013 I believe strongly in the NHS.\u201d\n\nAfter Mr Jones complained, his surgery laid bare the pressure they were under.\n\nTheir astonishing response to him said: \u201cWe have to balance the staff we have, the hours they work, their skills, our available space and the overall demand for all services we offer.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate ear irrigation is very important for you, but the same applies in respect of anti-coagulation, phlebotomy, post-operative care, complex drug monitoring, taking and interpreting ECGs, tending to minor injuries, monitoring patients with eating disorders, PSA monitoring, diabetes and COPD care, supporting patients with mental health problems, dementia identification, cancer care, chronic kidney disease, epilepsy monitoring, fitting and removing contraceptive implants to name but a few \u2013 all in respect of many of our other patients.\u201d", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: New figures reveal some patients are waiting fifteen days for an appointment - the first time it has gone over a fortnight", "authors": ["Alan Selby", "Image", "Getty", "Adam Gerrard Daily Mirror", "Internet Uknown"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20468216.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_JS190355918.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
