The New York Times ran an excerpt from your book over the weekend, in the opinion section, that included a new allegation of sexual misconduct against Brett Kavanaugh, but you guys left out a key detail.\u201d\n\nTRUMP RIPS NEW YORK TIMES OVER KAVANAUGH PIECE, CALLS FOR RESIGNATION OF ANYONE INVOLVED IN 'SMEAR STORY'\n\nThe now-revised piece was adapted from Pogrebin and Kelly\u2019s book, \"The Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation,\" and alleged that there was corroboration of an incident in which Kavanaugh, as a college student at Yale, exposed himself to a female classmate at a party. But the paper was forced to issue an update clarifying that several friends of the alleged victim said she did not recall the purported sexual assault.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, there was no desire to withhold important information from our readers. We have all of it in the book,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cThe essay is an adaptation of the book that, of course, we had to edit for length and clarity.\u201d\n\nKelly went on to say \u201cthe thrust of the essay was about,\u201d before stopping herself and awkwardly noting that \u201cthrust\u201d was a poor choice of words. She then said the focus of the Times story was about a different Kavanaugh accuser, but the new allegation was added because it was relevant to the subject.\n\n\u201cDuring the editing process there was an oversight and this key detail, about the fact that the woman herself has told friends she doesn\u2019t remember it, and has not wanted to talk about it, got cut,\u201d Kelly said as she smirked. \u201cIt was an oversight and the Times adjusted it and we\u2019re very sorry that it happened.\u201d\n\nNYT REPORTERS BEHIND KAVANAUGH STORY SUGGEST KEY INFORMATION WAS REMOVED BY EDITORS\n\nMcCain said this is an example of why so many people \u201cdon\u2019t trust the media.\u201d\n\nCo-host Abby Huntsman then questioned why the Times did not initially disclosed the political ties of a Clinton-linked nonprofit CEO, Max Stier, who was named as a witness to the alleged misconduct.\n\n\u201cI understand, it\u2019s relevant background; in this case it was a very short mention and we only talked in brief terms about what he\u2019s doing right now,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t see all of that context to be necessary.\u201d\n\nMcCain then grilled the authors about a recent MSNBC appearance in which they blamed Gray Lady editors for omitting key details.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a team at The New York Times. We have processes in place. We wrote this, it was edited, there was back-and-forth as there always is, it\u2019s kind of a team effort, frankly, to make sure that everybody\u2019s comfortable with the final product and there was just an oversight here,\u201d Kelly said.\n\nNEW YORK TIMES DELETES TWEET CALLING UNPROVOKED PENIS THRUSTING 'HARMLESS FUN'\n\nPogrebin and Kelly reiterated that the key details are in their book and it was only cut from the Times\u2019 excerpt.\n\n\u201cWe first had it in the piece so it\u2019s about an editing process which is iterative, it has a lot of different drafts and actually, I think, the way it happened was the editors being concerned about naming [the alleged victim] because the Times has a tradition of not naming victims and really has to deliberate whether or not to do that,\u201d Pogrebin said. \u201cIn that sentence, that had her name, it also had that she does not remember it. They took out the whole sentence in removing her name in order to kind of protect her.\u201d\n\nPogrebin and Kelly were then asked if they read the edited version before it was published in Sunday\u2019s New York Times.\n\n\u201cWe thought we had,\u201d Pogrebin said. \u201cAnd as soon as we realized this, we corrected it.\u201d\n\nMcCain then pressed, asking if they understood why critics are so upset about the Times piece but Pogrebin pivoted to why they wrote the book in the first place and added that \u201cKavanaugh has been a better man\u201d in the 36 years since the allegations.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cHe has been an exemplary judge,\u201d Pogrebin said.\n\nPresident Trump issued a full-throated call for resignations and changes in management at the paper over the essay during a fiery rally in Democratic-leaning New Mexico on Monday night. The authors downplayed Trump's rhetoric when asked during their appearance on \"The View.\"\n\n\u201cWe appreciate that the president of the United States is paying attention to our book,\u201d Pogrebin said. \u201cWhat we tried to do is what we always do as reporters, which is seek the facts and put them out there and let people come to their own conclusions.\u201d\n\nPogrebin also said that Trump and 2020 Democratic candidates have \"jumped on\" specific aspects of the book but it was not her intent to have an agenda.\n\nFox News\u2019 Joseph A.
