The school in Tumba has become a model of excellence, not only in Rwanda, but in the whole of East Africa.\n\nIts strength lies in its ability to teach specialist techniques, which perfectly meet Rwanda\u2019s needs, supporting and developing its economic growth, creating jobs and last, but not least, careers.\n\nJapan\u2019s cooperation with the school in Tumba dates back to the early 1990s.\n\nAfter the genocide, JICA, the Japan International Cooperation Agency, relaunched projects here in key sectors: information technology, electronics, telecommunications and renewable energy. Between 2007 and 2018, Japanese technicians came here regularly and nearly 2,000 young people have graduated.\n\nThe exchange has been a real success. Not only have the Japanese shared technical know-how, they have also instilled a culture of learning.\n\nA number of Tumba\u2019s alumni have also taken the opportunity to go to Japan as part of the ABE Initiative, a Japanese government programme which allows young Africans to obtain a master's degree and do internships with companies.\n\nThe project has been an outstanding success. The employment rate is more than 75 percent and the employers' satisfaction rate is more than 85 percent.\n\nJICA\u2019s projects aim to be both economic and social; two vital ingredients for this country, which has seen annual growth of nearly eight percent since 2000. JICA\u2019s projects have also contributed greatly to the national reconciliation effort.", "description": "The Global Japan team has come to Tumba in northern Rwanda to discover a school which trains high-level technicians to meet the economic needs of the country.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/03/43/42/84/1000x563_cmsv2_2cdaaccb-8fda-5517-96cb-8d3451ec5d00-3434284.jpg", "published_at": "2018-11-22"}
