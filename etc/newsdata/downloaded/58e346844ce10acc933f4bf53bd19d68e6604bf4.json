In September a Labour MP received a round of applause for demanding an apology from the Prime Minister for his comments comparing Muslim women who wear a hijab to bank robbers and letterboxes.\n\nDuring PMQs, Labour MP for Slough Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi - the first turban-wearing Sikh in the Commons - called on Boris Johnson to apologise for his 'derogatory' comments immediately.\n\nJust four years ago Scottish National Party MPs were warned to 'show some respect' after they clapped on at least three occasions as their Westminster leader Angus Robertson delivered his response to the Queen's Speech.\n\nCommons Leader Jacob Rees-Mogg said: 'The general feeling that clapping is not welcome in this chamber is one that is widely shared'\n\nIt occurred shortly after the party's Westminster ranks were boosted in a strong showing in the 2015 General Election.\n\nThe scenes forced the Commons Speaker John Bercow to step in \u2013 rebuking the MPs for their un-Parliamentary behaviour.\n\nAddressing the issue raised by Dame Cheryl today, Commons Leader Jacob Rees-Mogg said: 'I will certainly take up her suggestion with the House's diversity and inclusion team to see if there is more that we can do to make autistic visitors feel more welcome. And indeed in the restoration and renewal (of Parliament) project.\n\n'Mr Speaker, orderly matters are a matter for you, but I think the general feeling that clapping is not welcome in this chamber is one that is widely shared.\n\n'Though it may simply be on my part the sadness that nobody has ever bothered to clap me.'\n\nSome Tory backbenchers then proceeded to applaud Mr Rees-Mogg.", "description": "Tory Dame Cheryl Gillan, an autism campaigner, said that the rules banning applause should be enforced, as it can cause distress to people with the disorder.", "authors": ["David Wilcock", "Whitehall Correspondent For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/15/20136872-0-image-a-5_1571927570399.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
