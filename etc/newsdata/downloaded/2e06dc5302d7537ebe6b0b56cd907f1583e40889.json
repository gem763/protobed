section 14 of the Public Order Act, for which the police do not require the approval of the home secretary.\n\nThis allowed police to clear numbers of activists from Trafalgar Square and Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens.\n\nBut it also means any small groups of protesters affiliated with Extinction Rebellion, congregating anywhere in London, are now in breach of the law.\n\nAccording to legal experts The Independent spoke to, there is little precedent for the use of section 14 for a peaceful protest, and legally it must be balanced against the rights to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly, which are protected under the European Convention of Human Rights. The experts also suggested the police may have recognised such a ban was unlawful, but used it as a rapid means of clearing protesters.\n\nThe police claim previous conditions on the protests had already been imposed and those have not been adhered to, and that is what has led to them taking this step. However, it is not clear exactly what those conditions were.\n\nLiberty, the human rights and civil liberties organisation, said the Met\u2019s decision had grave consequences for future protests.\n\nGracie Bradley, the organisation\u2019s advocacy and policy manager, said: \u201cBanning Extinction Rebellion from protesting in London is a grossly disproportionate move by the Met, and an assault on the right to protest.\n\n\u201cTheir heavy-handed use of this power sets a dangerous precedent. Freedom of expression and assembly are fundamental rights, protected by domestic and international law. The courts have made clear that a protest is not unlawful just because it\u2019s disruptive.\u201d\n\nThe police have said the ban was made \u201cto get London moving again\u201d.\n\nDeputy assistant commissioner Laurence Taylor said: \u201cI want to be absolutely clear, the conditions ... do not in any way ban protests from London, nor do they ban the activities of Extinction Rebellion as a group. These conditions specifically state that any assembly linked to Extinction Rebellion\u2019s Autumn Uprising must now cease.\n\n\u201cPrevious conditions which stated Extinction Rebellion could lawfully protest in the pedestrianised area of Trafalgar Square were repeatedly breached. The decision to impose further conditions was made in order to help us get London moving again. It is a lawful decision which we felt is entirely proportionate and reasonable to impose after nine days of sustained, unlawful assembly and protest by Extinction Rebellion.\n\n\u201cIf Extinction Rebellion or any other group come to us with a proposal for a lawful protest, which does not cause the serious disruption to London we have witnessed over the past nine days, then of course we will discuss that. But what we cannot allow is for central London to be brought to a standstill.\u201d\n\nIn response to the ban, Extinction Rebellion said in a statement: \u201cThe climate and ecological emergency isn\u2019t going away and we remain resolute in facing it.\n\n\u201cWe urge the government and the authorities to join us in doing the same. We cannot do it alone.\u201d\n\nSo far around 1,500 people have been arrested in connection with the protests, and before the legal foundation of the Met\u2019s ban is tested in court, there are likely to be many more.", "description": "By their very nature, protests are designed to cause inconvenience.\u00a0While this will inevitably prove to be awkward or frustrating for some, the right to peacefully protest is protected by the European Convention on\u00a0Human Rights.
