Instead, they have sought to portray these rate reductions as \u201cinsurance\u201d cuts that are meant to give the economy extra protection in a world of rising uncertainty.\n\nThe central bank lowered the benchmark interest rate a quarter of a percentage point to a range of 1.5 percent to 1.75 percent. The move should trigger mortgage, auto and personal loan rates to fall, making it cheaper to borrow money. Home prices and home sales have ticked up somewhat since the Fed began lowering rates in late July.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWeakness in global growth and trade developments have weighed on the economy and posed ongoing risks,\u201d Powell said.\n\nHe stressed that the three rate cuts have added \u201csignificant\u201d stimulus to the economy and he suggested that the central bank would likely stand pay and not cut rates further unless the economy deteriorates substantially.\n\n\u201cWe see the current stance of monetary policy as likely to remain appropriate as long as incoming information about the economy remains broadly consistent with our outlook,\" Powell said. \u201cIf developments emerge that cause a material reassessment of our outlook, we would respond accordingly. Policy is not on a pre-set course.\"\n\nAD\n\nStocks ended the day higher, with the Dow Jones industrial average climbing 115 points.\n\nPresident Trump and Wall Street are looking for signals of how much more the Fed will lower rates heading into the presidential election, but Powell suggested on Wednesday that it was pausing for the foreseeable future.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis is the clearest signal we\u2019ve gotten that the time for action is over for the Fed,\u201d said Mike Loewengart, vice president of investment strategy at E*TRADE.\n\nFed leaders signaled Wednesday that they are going to wait and see what happens to the economy and trade talks before they commit to another cut. All summer, Powell stressed that the Fed would \u201cact as appropriate to sustain the expansion,\u201d but that phrase was scrapped from the statement announcing the latest decision.\n\nAD\n\nThe U.S. economy is growing at a \u201cmoderate\u201d pace, and hiring remains strong, the Fed said, but business investment is weak, and \u201cuncertainties about this outlook remain.\u201d Growth in the third quarter slipped to 1.9 percent, the Commerce Department reported Wednesday, one of the slowest paces in recent years.\n\n\u201cAlthough household spending has been rising at a strong pace, business fixed investment and exports remain weak,\u201d the Fed wrote in the statement.\n\nAD\n\nFed leaders anticipated that growth would cool this year and next to around 2 percent, a level they considered the long-run trend pace for the economy. The rate cuts are meant to prevent growth from slipping much below that pace. There is concern that businesses have slashed spending in recent months and that they could turn around and cut workers next, but so far hiring has remained solid.\n\nAD\n\nTrump has repeatedly bashed the Fed, even labeling them \u201cboneheads,\" for not cutting interest rates more. Trump tweeted five times about the Fed\u2019s September rate cut and this week\u2019s in an attempt to jawbone the Fed for more stimulus ahead of the presidential election, but the president\u2019s efforts were noticeably less than the 43 times he tweeted or retweeted about the Fed before the September interest rate decision.\n\nThe president blames the Fed for raising interest rates four times last year \u2014 to a level close to 2.5 percent \u2014 which Trump argues caused companies to pull back on spending. After the Fed\u2019s move Wednesday, U.S. interest rates are now at the same level as they were in spring 2018.\n\nAD\n\nMost business leaders say trade uncertainty has caused them to scale back investment as they wait and see what happens with talks between the world\u2019s two largest economies. But the stock market remains very high, the unemployment rate is low, and the housing market in some parts of the country has shown new signs of life, offering a mixed picture of the economy\u2019s broader performance.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe are not calling for a recession near term, but clearly the global and U.S. economies are slowing and recession risks as a result are rising,\u201d said Owen Thomas, chief executive of Boston Properties on an earnings call Wednesday. \u201cCentral bank action in the U.S. and around the world should help, and low interest rates are a clear tailwind for commercial real estate.\u201d\n\nRelated:\n\nAD", "description": "Fed leaders anticipated that growth would cool this year to around 2 percent.
