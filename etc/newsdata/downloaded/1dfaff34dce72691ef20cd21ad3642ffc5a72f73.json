USA TODAY\n\nYahoo users can now file a claim for a piece of the $117.5 million class-action settlement related to massive data breaches.\n\nIf you had a Yahoo account between Jan. 1, 2012 and Dec. 31, 2016 \u2013 including traditional Yahoo email or accounts on Yahoo Fantasy Sports, Yahoo Finance, Tumblr and Flickr \u2013 you can get two years of free credit monitoring services by AllClear ID or up to $358.\n\nThe website to file a claim is www.yahoodatabreachsettlement.com, and the deadline to file is July 20, 2020.\n\nTo get a cash payment, which may be $100 or less, you have to verify you already have credit monitoring or protection services and say you will keep them by filing an \"Alternative Compensation Claim,\" according to frequently asked questions on the settlement website.\n\nSigning up for Equifax settlement: Consumers must deal with more red tape to get cash\n\nFrom Capital One to Equifax: A look at the biggest confirmed data breaches ever\n\nThe amount for alternative compensation payments is listed as $100 on the website with a note that the \"amount could decrease if the amount of all valid claims exceeds the amount of the Settlement Fund, or the payment could increase to as high as $358.80 if there are remaining funds after all claims for Out-of-Pocket Costs, Paid User Costs, and Small Business User Costs are paid.\"\n\nThe website notes \"nobody can know in advance how much the payment will be.\"\n\nBut based on past class action settlements, it is expected to be less than initially announced.\n\nIn July when the Equifax settlement was announced and the website to submit claims launched, consumers were told they could receive free credit monitoring for 10 years or up to $125.\n\nAccording to the Federal Trade Commission, because the response to the settlement \"has been overwhelming,\" consumers will get \"nowhere near the $125 they could have gotten if there hadn\u2019t been such an enormous number of claims filed.\"\n\nThe free credit monitoring services in the Equifax settlement has also changed and the website now says it will provide \"at least 4 years of three-bureau credit monitoring\" and that consumers \"can also get up to 6 more years of free one-bureau credit monitoring through Equifax.\"\n\nCLOSE So remember that gigantic Equifax data breach in 2017? And how consumer credit reporting agencies were trying to get everyone to lock or freeze their credit reports to stop the problem from snowballing? Buzz60\n\nWho is affected?\n\nIf you had a Yahoo account during the time frame, your information was affected. In August 2013, \"malicious actors were able to gain access to Yahoo\u2019s user database and took records for all existing Yahoo accounts,\" which was approximately 3 billion, according to the settlement website.\n\nThis data breach wasn't disclosed until years later 2016 and is considered the largest hack in history.\n\nRecords taken included names, email addresses, telephone numbers, birth dates, passwords, and security questions and answers of Yahoo account holders, according to the settlement website.\n\nThe website outlines smaller breaches in the time frame including a 2014 incident revealed two years later, when Yahoo said information from at least half a billion accounts was stolen.\n\nFiling a claim\n\nThere are two ways to file a claim. You can file online at www.yahoodatabreachsettlement.com or by mail. If by mail, you can download and print the claim form, fill it out and mail it with any supporting documentation.\n\nYou also can request a claim form be mailed to you by calling 1-844-702-2788 or emailing info@YahooDataBreachSettlement.com.\n\nFill out your claim form and mail it (including postage) to: In re: Yahoo! Inc. Customer Data Breach Security Litigation, c/o Settlement Administrator, PO Box 1760, Philadelphia, PA, 19105-1760.\n\nThe deadline to file is July 20, 2020. If you want to be excluded from the settlement, you need to send a written request postmarked no later than March 6.\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Kelly Tyko on Twitter: @KellyTyko\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/10/14/yahoo-data-breach-117-5-million-settlement-get-cash-monitoring/3976582002/", "description": "Yahoo users can now\u00a0file a claim\u00a0for a piece of the\u00a0$117.5 million class action\u00a0settlement related to data breaches between 2012 and 2016.", "authors": ["Kelly Tyko", "Published P.M.
