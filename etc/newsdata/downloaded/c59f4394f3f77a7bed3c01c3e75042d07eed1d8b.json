But Trump has since admitted that he \u201clargely\u201d spoke about corruption and the Bidens in his July phone call. He may have used withheld military funds as leverage.\n\n\u201cWhy would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt?\u201d Trump asked Monday.\n\nTrump\u2019s apparent attempt to use his presidential power to harm the Democrat who could face him in the 2020 election has sparked calls for the president\u2019s impeachment.\n\n\u201cThe president apparently directly solicited the Ukrainian government for what some would say [is] assistance in the upcoming federal elections,\u201d said Johnson, who served in President Barack Obama\u2019s Cabinet. \u201cOne would argue there\u2019s the collusion, the conspiracy, right there. The president himself is directly soliciting.\u201d\n\nCheck it out in the video above.", "description": "\u201cOne would argue there\u2019s the collusion, the conspiracy, right there.
