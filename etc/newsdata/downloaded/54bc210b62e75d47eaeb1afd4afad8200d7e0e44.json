Of that group, 16% said they experienced significant or moderate impact from trade tensions.\n\n\u201cWhether this drop in optimism is a trend is a matter of whether global trade tensions, Brexit fears and unemployment will continue,\u201d said Bob Sannerud, chairman of the organization\u2019s Americas Regional Advisory Panel and chief financial officer of Life Link III, a Minneapolis-based air medical transportation company, in an interview.\n\nU.S. businesses have suffered from the prolonged U.S.-China trade battle, which has prompted escalating tariffs.\n\nAccording to the outlook survey, the biggest challenge facing companies in the third quarter is the availability of skilled personnel. But that challenge, which has topped the list for nine consecutive quarters, could be less of a concern if executives\u2019 optimism continues to evaporate.\n\nIn the latest survey, optimism about employment dropped to the lowest level since the end of 2016. And 60% of respondents said they either had the appropriate number of employees or too many employees, the highest percentage since the end of 2017.\n\nThe second-biggest challenge, according to the survey, is the condition of the domestic economy, which had previously held the No. 6 spot for three consecutive quarters.\n\nWrite to Mark Maurer at mark.maurer@wsj.com", "description": "Finance executives\u2019 faith in the U.S. economy has reached a three-year low amid concerns over higher tariffs and economic uncertainty.", "authors": ["Mark Maurer"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-104473/social", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
