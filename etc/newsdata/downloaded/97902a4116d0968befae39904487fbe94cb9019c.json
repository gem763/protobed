Several ministries last week approached both coal and renewable energy producers to ask for lower-cost supplies as the government scrambles to rescue the unprofitable state-owned utility.\n\n\u201cWe are talking to them, we are not instructing them,\u201d Mantashe said. \u201cThe steps are, one you talk to coal producers, they make a commitment, talk to renewables, they make a commitment.\u201d\n\nCoal producers plan more talks with the government over the supply and cost of the fuel, according to the Minerals Council South Africa, the country\u2019s mining lobby.\n\n\u201cCareful consideration is being given to being mindful of competition regulation,\u201d it said in a statement.\n\nEskom\u2019s primary energy costs increased by 17% in its most recent financial year, due to higher coal charges and increased production from independent power producers.\n\nMantashe said the government is also worried that Eskom\u2019s value could be destroyed should the transmission business be split off. \u201cIf you sell transmission, you are saying close down Eskom,\u201d he said at the Joburg Indaba conference.\n\nUnbundling\n\nOver recent months, president Cyril Ramaphosa and finance minister Tito Mboweni have repeatedly confirmed that Eskom will be restructured into three entities \u2013 generation, distribution and transmission.\n\nAt his Budget presentation in February, finance minister Tito Mboweni said a separate transmission company with its own board operational would be set up.\n\nMantashe said South Africa\u2019s resources plan will be presented to Cabinet next week, adding that calls to abandon coal immediately show \u201cshortsightedness.\u201d\n\n\n\nMining executives, investors and officials are gathering in Johannesburg for the second day of to discuss the industry\u2019s investment prospects after years of regulatory uncertainty.\n\nOverall, it\u2019s been a good year for South African miners as the rally in iron ore, gold and platinum-group metal prices boosted earnings and put dividends back on the agenda. Still, looming labor disputes, a reliance on a weak currency and the slow demise of gold mining leave the industry with plenty of challenges.\n\n- Additional reporting by Fin24", "description": "Government is pushing coal producers to cut prices to help save struggling power utility Eskom.", "authors": ["- Felix Njini", "Paul Burkhardt"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7752/a1c7c9e7d88a49d5b6d6b2cf82159cb8.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
