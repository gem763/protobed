The president has faced stringent attacks from both sides of the aisle, including Republican senators usually resolutely supportive.\n\nIn Washington on Saturday night, Trump told the conservative Values Voter Summit he was \u201can island of one\u201d on Syria.\n\n\u201cWe have to bring our great heroes, our great soldiers, we have to bring them home,\u201d he insisted. \u201cIt\u2019s time. It\u2019s time.\u201d\n\nIf we don\u2019t keep the pressure on, then Isis will resurge. It\u2019s absolutely a given that they will come back James Mattis\n\nTrump announced the withdrawal on Monday, after a call with Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan and prompting widespread accusations of a betrayal of Kurds allied to the US in war-torn Syria whom Turkey, which regards some as terrorists, swiftly attacked. The president also said Erdo\u011fan would visit the White House.\n\nUS forces are not out of harm\u2019s way. On Saturday, the Washington Post reported that Turkish forces which shelled an area where US special forces troops remained on Friday had known for months they were there.\n\nBrett McGurk, the former US envoy to the global coalition against Isis who resigned last year over Trump\u2019s attempts to withdraw from Syria, told the Post: \u201cTurkey wants us off the entire border region to a depth of 30km [20 miles]. Based on all the facts available, these were warning fires on a known location, not inadvertent rounds.\u201d\n\nAirstrikes and shelling continued in Kurdish areas and harrowing scenes among panicked and grieving refugees were reported and broadcast worldwide. More than 130,000 people have been displaced from rural areas around Tel Abyad and Ras al Ain as a result of the fighting, the United Nations said.\n\nTurkish forces and their Syrian allies seized large parts of the town of Suluk, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said on Sunday, the fifth day of the offensive.\n\nOn Saturday, CNN reported that earlier this week Gen Mazloum Kobani Abdi, head of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, told a senior US diplomat: \u201cYou have given up on us. You are leaving us to be slaughtered.\u201d\n\nRelated: Betrayal on the border: Kurds fear future as Turkish assault intensifies\n\nAlso on Saturday, another SDF commander told a press conference: \u201cThe protection of Isis prisons will not remain our priority. The defence of our soil will be prioritised if [the] Turkish military continues its attacks.\u201d\n\nTurkey is facing threats of US sanctions \u2013 reiterated by Trump in his speech on Saturday night \u2013 unless it calls off the incursion. Two of its Nato allies, Germany and France, have said they are halting weapons exports and the Arab League has denounced the operation.\n\nMattis discussed the threat of an Isis resurgence on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press with Chuck Todd, in an interview to be broadcast in full on Sunday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s in a situation of disarray right now,\u201d he said in excerpts released by the broadcaster. \u201cObviously, the Kurds are adapting to the Turkish attacks. And we\u2019ll have to see if they\u2019re able to maintain the fight against Isis. It\u2019s going to have an impact. The question is, how much?\u201d\n\nAsked if the US would regret Trump\u2019s decision, Mattis said: \u201cWe have got to keep the pressure on Isis so they don\u2019t recover.\n\n\u201cWe may want a war over. We may even declare it over. You can pull your troops out as President Obama learned the hard way out of Iraq, but the \u2018enemy gets the vote\u2019, we say in the military. And in this case, if we don\u2019t keep the pressure on, then Isis will resurge. It\u2019s absolutely a given that they will come back.\u201d\n\nTrump said this week any militant prisoners escaping from camps guarded by Kurds \u201cwill be escaping to Europe\u201d. He also said the Kurds \u201cdidn\u2019t help us in the second world war, they didn\u2019t help us in Normandy, for example\u201d.", "description": "* Ex-defense secretary calls resurgence of Isis \u2018a given\u2019  * Kurds say 785 Isis affiliates escape camp after Turkish shellingJames Mattis declined the opportunity to directly criticise his former boss, Donald Trump.
