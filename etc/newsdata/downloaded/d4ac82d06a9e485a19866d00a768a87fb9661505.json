But not a single one addressed how any of the candidates running for president of the United States would empower workers to organize in a union. The issue could not be more urgent for Americans at a time when politicians are relentlessly giving handouts to rich and powerful corporations, all while pointing the finger at immigrants and people of color for our hard times.\n\nBut just three years later, it is a different world.

These plans are not just words on a page. Candidates are hitting the campaign trail to underscore their proposals to ensure that every worker has the opportunity to join a union.\n\nThis past weekend, the leading Democratic presidential candidates spoke at a Unions for Al summit in California hosted by more than 1,000 janitorial, security, fast food, health care, and gig workers who are organizing to win a union on the job. It is no accident that the issue of worker power is now emerging as a top issue in the 2020 election, even after it remained on the sidelines of the presidential debate three years ago. It is happening because workers across the country are demanding it.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nStrikes have broken out in nearly every corner of the country, spanning red states and blue, and hitting powerful corporations across a range of industries. In 2018, more workers in the United States went on strike than in any year since 1986. This wave of walkouts has continued to roll into 2019. Thirty thousand public school teachers in Los Angeles went on strike in January. Thirty-one thousand workers at Stop N Shop did in April. Forty-six thousand workers at General Motors are still on strike today. Cooks and cashiers at McDonald\u2019s and drivers at gig companies like Uber and Lyft waged historic strikes this year.\n\nThis action is translating into breakthrough victories. The mere threat of a strike by 85,000 workers at the healthcare giant Kaiser Permanente earlier this month resulted in a landmark agreement on a new contract. Following determined and persistent organizing, more than 40,000 child care workers across California now have a path to join together in a union thanks to legislation signed by Governor Gavin Newsom Gavin Christopher NewsomHillicon Valley: Zuckerberg to testify on Libra | Extremists find home on Telegram app | Warren blasts Facebook for not removing anti-Biden ad | California outlaws facial recognition in police body cameras | China rips US tech sanctions Newsom mocks photo of Defense officials with Trump: 'The diversity is truly overwhelming' California blocks police body cameras from using facial recognition MORE just last week.\n\nBut unfortunately, too few working people are represented by forward-thinking elected leaders like those in California. Across the country, many lawmakers at the state level and in Washington are waking up every day trying to put more power in the hands of corporations instead of working people. These attacks hurt all workers, not just the one-in-ten who have a union today. A recent study by the International Monetary Fund found that up to 30 percent of the record inequality in the United States today is due to sinking union membership.\n\nThat is why the two million members of the union I lead are conditioning their endorsement in the 2020 presidential election on support for Unions for All, a far-reaching demand to overhaul America\u2019s 80-year-old labor laws and empower every worker, regardless of where they work, with the opportunity to join a union. Our demand for Unions for All includes four parts.\n\nFirst, the next president needs to bring employers, workers and government together at industry-wide bargaining tables to negotiate wages, benefits, and working conditions nationwide. Second, states and cities must be allowed to innovate and find new ways to empower workers to organize in unions above the limits of federal labor laws today. Third, federal government workers and contractors, as well as all private sector workers in jobs supported by taxpayer dollars, must be paid at least $15 an hour and have the opportunity to join a union. Fourth, every major economic plan, including proposals like the Green New Deal and Medicare for All, must have good union jobs at the center.\n\nThere\u2019s no question that our demand for Unions for All is ambitious. But with hundreds of thousands of working people walking off the job all across the country, it\u2019s clear that big, bold change is needed to address this country's crisis of racial and economic inequality. Until elected leaders take action, it\u2019s also clear that this demand for Unions for All echoing across the country will only grow louder.\n\nMary Kay Henry is president of the Service Employees International Union.", "description": "During the primary races in 2016, there were nearly two dozen televised debates, plus another three debates during the general election.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/labor_wages.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
