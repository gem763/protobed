Sanctions bar U.S. companies from selling technology to Huawei without government approval, though there are 90-day exemptions for a narrow list of products and services.\n\nYu revealed little about the Mate 30 as he showcased the company\u2019s other products. He touted the new chip\u2019s lower energy use and superfast 5G download speed.\n\n\u201cThis is the latest semiconductor technology,\u201d he said.\n\nHuawei has developed its Kirin line of chips to power some of its phones and reduce reliance on U.S.-based Qualcomm Corp.\u2019s Snapdragon and other foreign suppliers. It has also built its own operating system, Hongmeng, though executives have said they hope to be able to keep using Android.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Chinese tech giant Huawei unveiled its latest advanced chipset Friday ahead of the upcoming launch of its latest flagship smartphone, even as uncertainty hangs over whether the device can use Google's Android.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/06/germany_ifa_tech_fair_40200_c0-71-4176-2505_s1770x1032.jpg?ca26d2c41ba80bafff245fa6191b16529b27ee46", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
