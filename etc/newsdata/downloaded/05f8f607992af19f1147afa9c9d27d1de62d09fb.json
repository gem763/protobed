The verdict has garnered criticism due to it falling on the same day as the horrific synagogue attack in Halle.\n\n'I did not do anything wrong,' Ms Mensah-Schramm, who was born in Stuttgart at the end of World War II, told local broadcaster MDR Th\u00fcringen.\n\nThe pensioner has since decided to appeal against the ruling, with supporters crowdfunding to raise money for her court costs.\n\nWhen handed the fine, the pensioner was told she could avoid it by paying \u00a3440 to a local charitable organisation.\n\nThe pensioner - who described herself as a 'political cleaner' - was slapped with a fine for property damage by police\n\nBut Ms Mensah-Schramm has since refused, arguing that to do so would be an admission of guilt.\n\nThe activist always carries spray paint, nail varnish and a scraper to paint over the work left by vandals - and has since won awards and commendations for her activism.\n\nShe has even kept a detailed file of every act of graffiti she has removed, being first inspired to take up her decade-long mission when she saw a flyer supporting World War II Nazi criminal Rudolf Hess in a local bus stop.\n\nAfter seeing the poster still there when she returned home from work, she she took out her keys and quickly scratched the message off.\n\nThe former teacher was charged four times in December 2018 for spray painting over a sign translating as 'Nazi Zone'\n\nShe always carries spray paint, nail varnish and a scraper wherever she goes - and has since won awards and commendations for her activism\n\n'I just scrubbed the hate away until it was all gone It was a fantastic feeling afterwards. This mind pollution was gone!', She told CNN in a 2016 interview.\n\n'The threshold on the misuse of freedom of speech has deteriorated over the last few years. I think it has now reached rock bottom\n\n'People tell me I am intolerant, that I don't respect the far-right's freedom of speech. But I say: Freedom of speech has limits. It ends where hatred and contempt for humanity begins.'\n\nMs Mensah-Schramm replaced 'Merkel muss weg' (Merkel must go) with 'Merke! Hass weg' (Remember! Away with hate) during the refugee influx in 2015.", "description": "Irmela Mensah-Schramm, 74, has spent more than three decades removing far-right symbols littered across her home-town of\u00a0Eisenach in Germany.", "authors": ["Sophie Law For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/16/19698208-0-image-a-87_1571065354006.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
