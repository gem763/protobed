U.S. crude inventories rose 3.1 million barrels last week, more than forecast.\n\n\u201cIt is simply impossible to predict where the next significant price support will come from as the focus is firmly on economic developments,\u201d said Tamas Varga of oil broker PVM.\n\n\u201cAnd those are anything but optimistic,\u201d he added.\n\nBrent crude oil futures LCOc1 fell 33 cents to $57.36 a barrel by 0910 GMT, after tumbling 2% in the previous session. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc dropped 1 cent to $52.63.\n\nLending oil some support were hopes that the United States and China might make progress in resolving their trade dispute and figures showing output in the United States - which has been the fastest source of supply growth - fell in July.\n\n\u201cNext week U.S.-China trade talks remain the unknown variable which could lend a modicum of support,\u201d said Stephen Innes, market strategist at AxiTrader. The talks are set to resume on Oct. 10.\n\nThis year, Brent has risen about 7%, supported by supply cuts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies including Russia, plus involuntary outages such as a drop in Iranian exports due to U.S. sanctions.\n\nNonetheless, concern about the worsening economic outlook has overshadowed support from the supply side and the prospect of further output disruption in the Middle East appears of limited concern to investors.\n\nBrent spiked to $72 a barrel on Sept. 16 following attacks on Saudi Arabian oil installations that shut more than half of the country\u2019s output. But Brent is now below the pre-attack level after the Saudi authorities resumed output.\n\n\u201cCrude oil does not want to price a geopolitical premium,\u201d said Olivier Jakob, analyst at Petromatrix. \u201cWith the lack of strong economic data it is difficult to develop a bullish theme.\u201d", "description": "Oil slipped further below $58 a barrel on Thursday, pressured by concerns about global economic growth, oil demand and signs of excess supply despite OPEC-led cuts.", "authors": ["Alex Lawler", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191003&t=2&i=1436472489&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9201N"}
