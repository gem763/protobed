Social media monitoring firm Storyful found the posts that reportedly feature ISIS songs and show Islamic State fighters with weapons, corpses being displayed in streets, and women saying they are \u201cjihadist and proud.\u201d Some videos reportedly included basic TikTok editing like filters and floating hearts and stars.\n\nAll the videos and accounts found by Storyful were reportedly removed by TikTok after WSJ flagged the videos.\n\n\u201cContent promoting terrorist organisations has absolutely no place on TikTok,\u201d a TikTok spokesperson told Gizmodo in a statement. \u201cWe permanently ban any such accounts and associated devices as soon as identified, and we continuously develop ever-stronger controls to proactively detect suspicious activity.\u201d\n\nThe spokesperson added that terrorist propaganda is an \u201cindustry-wide challenge,\u201d and the company, which is owned by the China-based ByteDance, has a team dedicated to \u201caggressively protecting against malicious behaviour on TikTok.\u201d\n\nElisabeth Kendall, an Oxford University professor who researchers extremism, explained to WSJ that one reason why the peppy and catchy short-video app may be an effective tool for ISIS is because the group aims to rouse potential recruits instead of preach to them.\n\n\u201cThe rhyme, beat, evocative lyrics and punchy delivery are especially appealing to youth,\u201d Kendall told WSJ. \u201cThis catchy sing-along method for propagating ISIS ideology means it spreads quickly and sticks in the collective memory. It tends to be far more effective than sermons or theological debate and treatises.\u201d\n\nAs WSJ points out, ISIS\u2019s embrace of TikTok follows an audio message purportedly recorded by the group\u2019s leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, that was released last month. The message reportedly commands his supporters to escalate their efforts after losing their territory in Iraq and Syria.", "description": "For years, the Islamic State has used popular social media platforms networks Facebook, Telegram,\u00a0Twitter and YouTube to recruit across the world \u2014 so of course, TikTok, one of the fastest-growing platforms, has been used to push ISIS propaganda....", "authors": ["Alex Choros", "Matt Novak"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/nr1hjjooflmsk5yun2rx.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
