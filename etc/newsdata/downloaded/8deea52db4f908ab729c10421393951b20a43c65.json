Just last week, for example, Hillary Clinton claimed without evidence that the Russians were grooming Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard for a third-party run aimed at damaging the eventual Democratic nominee.\n\nSeeing the full ideological array of conspiratorial thinking and understanding its deep history are essential to understanding how paranoid thinking about Russian conspiracies, which so troubled the McCarthyites in the 1950s and 1960s, could jump from right to left in the wake of the 2016 election.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nConspiracy theories \u2014 or allegations that secret agents were working together for a hidden (typically sinister) purpose \u2014 are older than the nation, and have been voiced by every party that ever took part in the country\u2019s politics.\n\nThe paranoid style in American politics, a phrase coined by historian Richard Hofstadter, originated from the 18th-century political ideology of republicanism, which viewed power as ambitious and grasping and accordingly saw liberty as always on the defense. Republican fears of power\u2019s expansionist tendencies spurred the revolutionary generation to regard British taxation after 1763 as not simply a deviation from prior norms, but as the first step on a swift descent toward political enslavement. American revolutionaries were not simply whiny about taxes, they were paranoid.\n\nWinning independence didn\u2019t soothe their anxieties.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe first bipartisan political divide in the United States emerged from conspiratorial anxieties. In the 1790s, conservative Federalists worried that their more democratic Jeffersonian rivals wanted to bring French-style revolution to the United States. At their most extreme, archconservatives such as Timothy Dwight warned that Jeffersonians were under the sway of the Bavarian Illuminati, an international conspiracy aiming to overthrow Christianity.\n\nThe Jeffersonians claimed that the Federalists were conspiring to destroy the republic and erect an aristocracy in the United States. The degree to which either side believed what they were saying about their rivals has been hotly debated by historians ever since. Did Federalists just use the specter of the Illuminati to tar their rivals? Or did they mean it? Did the Jeffersonians really think the Federalists were conspiring to bring back monarchy as they alleged? Or were they just trying to win elections? The answer depends on who and when, but it\u2019s safe to say that some did believe these theories.\n\nAmerican partisans continued to find conspiracies at work throughout the 19th century. Supporters of President John Quincy Adams (Adams\u2019s son) believed that a secret cabal had contributed to Adams's 1828 defeat at the hands of Andrew Jackson. The author of an 1835 political history of Jacksonianism warned on the first page, \u201cWe are admonished by history, that the principal dangers to popular governments arise from the interference of foreign nations, either by force or fraud, in their concerns; or from the corrupt ambition of their own citizens seeking exclusive and forbidden powers.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut this conspiracy theory itself spawned others: One angry reader accused the book of being \u201ca hodgepodge of misrepresentation + invective,\u201d written by \u201cthe most abandoned malignant slanderers ever sold to perdition.\u201d To this reader, the book must have been \u201cbrewed in Wall-street, that hotbed of bank tyranny.\u201d Only a conspiracy, ginned up for partisan effect, and personal profit, could have led to such ideas about Jackson.\n\nConspiracy theory after theory, Americans cast a paranoid eye on their partisan opponents throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the phrase \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d first appeared in the early 20th century United States, in the context of political histories of the 19th century. The phrase increased in popularity during the McCarthy era that inspired Hofstadter to coin the term \u201cparanoid style\u201d during lectures he gave at Cambridge University in 1958 and 1959 and expanded upon the concept in a November 1964 essay in Harper\u2019s Magazine on the rise of the far right wing of the Republican Party.\n\nDemocrats\u2019 anxieties about Russian conspiracies to interfere in the 2016 campaign cannot be extricated from this historical context of paranoia just because they have a significant basis in fact. As Joseph Heller wrote, \u201cJust because you\u2019re paranoid doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not after you.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNow Democratic charges of a Russian conspiracy have provoked Republican countercharges of a Ukrainian conspiracy tied to former vice president Joe Biden. This new conspiracy theory, which makes false claims about the vice president\u2019s interference in Ukrainian politics to protect the business interests of his son, appears to skeptics to be the malicious invention of Republican political hacks, designed to weaken Biden\u2019s presidential candidacy.\n\nAccording to recent reporting, tales of corruption by Biden and his son Hunter originated with Peter Schweizer, a conservative writer and editor at large for Breitbart. Schweizer is also president of the Government Accountability Institute, an opposition-research operation founded by Stephen K. Bannon and funded by the billionaire hedge-fund magnate Robert Mercer, President Trump\u2019s largest contributor. Schweizer is a longtime pusher of conspiracies about liberals. He published a book in 2018 titled \u201cSecret Empires,\u201d which included a chapter about the Bidens in Ukraine.\n\nThe most eager consumer of this new Ukrainian conspiracy theory featuring the Biden family has been Trump, who has endangered his own presidency with his efforts to promote it. With Trump\u2019s apparent approval, his personal lawyer and political operative Rudolph W. Giuliani has not only worked with journalist John Solomon, a former Washington Post writer who was just hired by Fox News Channel, to spread the story, but also with two Soviet-born business executives, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, to encourage Ukrainian connections to generate more information to feed the conspiracy theory.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSome commentators view Trump as breaking from the past, with his ready willingness to fuel conspiracy theories to motivate voters to support him and his party. They point to how much this diverges from presidents in recent decades.\n\nBut a more nuanced appraisal would situate Trump in the long history of peddling conspiracy theories in American politics. Instead of representing a massive departure, Trump\u2019s deviation from the past is far more slight: He\u2019s conspiracy mongering while his party largely controls power. Typically it is members of the party out of power who push conspiracies.\n\nThe republican political theory underlying the American paranoid style had its origin in the writings of opposition politicians in 18th-century Britain. Since then, conspiratorial thinking, has remained most attractive to opposition parties seeking to discredit their establishment rivals. This is the nature of Trump\u2019s criticism of Democratic investigations of Russian conspiracies to hack the 2016 campaign. They\u2019re just whining because they lost, Trump has said repeatedly.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis may be the norm, but Trump\u2019s ongoing embrace of conspiracy theories while in office can still be explained by the history of political conspiracy thinking. When parties in power \u2014 like the Federalists in the 1790s \u2014 start to feel their grasp on power slipping, they, too, travel down the road of conspiracy peddling.\n\nAnd today, Trump and his supporters may be right to perceive themselves on the defense, as changing demographics and social norms make the ongoing domination of American politics by white men like themselves less assured. If Trump\u2019s embrace of the Ukraine conspiracy doesn\u2019t sink his political future by leading to impeachment, it may nonetheless signal that his political future is bleak.\n\nAD", "description": "Conspiracy theories have been a central feature in American politics since before the Revolution.", "authors": ["Rachel Hope Cleves", "Rachel Hope Cleves Is Professor Of History At The University Of Victoria", "In British Columbia", "The Author Of Two Books Of U.S. History", "A Forthcoming Book About The Writer Norman Douglas."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/VVOPDLuirlpWmLezD1QV2-hGP28=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WSVFBJUVYAI6RAML5G3TJDGYPU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
