ABC News correspondent Linsey Davis asked Joe Biden how he would address the lingering legacies of slavery and Jim Crow in American communities, and he started out with the typical and anodyne Democratic response \u2014 throw money at it. By the time Biden finished, however, he had insinuated that black parents didn\u2019t know how to raise their children and what they really needed was, um \u2026 record players.\n\nYikes:\n\nDAVIS: Mr. Vice president, I want to come to you and talk to you about inequality in schools and race. In a conversation about how to deal with segregation in schools back in 1975, you told a reporter, \u201cI don\u2019t feel responsible for the sins of my father and grandfather, I feel responsible for what the situation is today, for the sins of my own generation, and I\u2019ll be damned if I feel responsible to pay for what happened 300 years ago.\u201d You said that some 40 years ago. But as you stand here tonight, what responsibility do you think that Americans need to take to repair the legacy of slavery in our country? BIDEN: Well, they have to deal with the \u2014 look, there\u2019s institutional segregation in this country. And from the time I got involved, I started dealing with that. Red-lining banks, making sure that we are in a position where \u2014 look, you talk about education. I propose that what we take is those very poor schools, the Title I schools, triple the amount of money we spend from 15 to $45 billion a year. Give every single teacher a raise, the equal raise to getting out \u2014 the $60,000 level. Number two, make sure that we bring in to help the teachers deal with the problems that come from home. The problems that come from home, we need \u2014 we have one school psychologist for every 1,500 kids in America today. It\u2019s crazy. The teachers are \u2014 I\u2019m married to a teacher. My deceased wife is a teacher. They have every problem coming to them. We have \u2014 make sure that every single child does, in fact, have 3-, 4-, and 5-year-olds go to school. School. Not daycare. School. We bring social workers in to homes and parents to help them deal with how to raise their children. It\u2019s not want they don\u2019t want to help. They don\u2019t \u2014 they don\u2019t know quite what to do. Play the radio, make sure the television \u2014 excuse me, make sure you have the record player on at night, the \u2014 the \u2014 make sure that kids hear words. A kid coming from a very poor school \u2014 a very poor background will hear 4 million words fewer spoken by the time they get there. DAVIS: Thank you, Mr. Vice President. BIDEN: There\u2019s so much we \u2014 no, I\u2019m going to go like the rest of them do, twice over, OK?\n\nFortunately for Biden, he stopped there; he switched topics completely and started talking about Venezuela for some reason. Had he continued, Biden might have started extolling Victrolas and bedtime stories by candlelight. As it is, a few people watching light night may have wondered if they\u2019ve even seen a record players since the mid-1990s.\n\nAs for the insinuation that African-American parents don\u2019t know how to raise their children, Time Magazine editor-at-large Anand Giridharadas calls it \u201cappalling \u2014 and disqualifying.\u201d Furthermore, Giridharadas commented on Twitter, it might have set a new low for racism in a Democratic presidential debate, and pointed to what might be a huge problem for Biden if Giridharadas is correct:\n\nThe record player moment may be what finally reveals Biden's bankruptcy. A staggering two minutes in our politics. America's gravest, most persistent injustice recast as parental ignorance. \u2014 Anand Giridharadas (@AnandWrites) September 13, 2019\n\nThis is easily the defining moment of today\u2019s #DemDebate, and it deserves more media scrutiny. This is the frontrunner. Currently, the most likely nominee. This is how he talks about African-Americans, who are the beating heart of his party. \u2014 Anand Giridharadas (@AnandWrites) September 13, 2019\n\nIs this the way African-American voters will take this, though? Biden has a good relationship with this \u201cbeating heart of his party,\u201d which is of course why his competitors have taken shots at his record on issues like busing and reparations. He has a long track record of relative goodwill on which to rely when interpreting stream-of-consciousness ramblings like this one. Giridharadas imputes racism when simple ignorance might be a better explanation. Or Biden just being the crazy-but-benign grandpa that Biden has been for a very long time.\n\nIf those voters do share Giridharadas\u2019 interpretation of this answer, watch out. Biden\u2019s large and stable polling lead in the race has come in significant part from loyalty by black voters to Biden and the Obama legacy. Telling them that they\u2019re confused as parents and really need more record players to raise their kids correctly as an answer to \u201cinstitutional racism\u201d is almost certainly not the change they\u2019ve been waiting for, and they may start looking for Option Two. Kamala Harris might be their next choice if Biden flames out; this could rehabilitate her earlier attack on Biden over busing, which ended up backfiring on her over the summer. Tulsi Gabbard\u2019s no longer around to provide Biden debate-stage muscle, too.\n\nPerhaps the biggest takeaway is this: don\u2019t let Joe Biden go past two hours on stage. And \u2026 we\u2019re gonna need a whole lot more popcorn to pass.", "description": "\"Make sure you have the record player on at night.\"", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw", "John Sexton", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/biden-racism.png", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
