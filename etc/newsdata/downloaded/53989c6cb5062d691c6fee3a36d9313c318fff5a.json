Photos include a cold-looking but stoic resident standing before her worn wooden house; the utilitarian d\u00e9cor inside the irradiated homes; and the shabby kitchen of an octogenarian Chernobyl stalwart.\n\nThese pictures show the hardy citizens who decided to stay in Chernobyl despite all government and safety advice telling them to leave. They stayed as the homes had been in their families for generations\n\nBetween 150 and 300 people remain in the Exclusion Zone, which covers an area of approximately 1,000 square miles around the remains of the Chernobyl nuclear plant in northern Ukraine\n\nMaria Masha, the last person in her remote village, can be seen reading the daily newspaper in her home which is more remote than all others. The Chernobyl nuclear disaster of 1986 left uninhabited villages in the Exclusion Zone. Clouds carrying radioactive material carried across Europe and wreaked havoc on thousands of people, even those thousands of miles away\n\nThe Chernobyl nuclear disaster of 1986 left a ring of ghost villages as residents fled, fearing radiation poisoning. But some people - around 150-300 - refused to go.\n\nOn 26 April 1986, Chernobyl suffered the world's worst nuclear disaster. An experiment designed to test the safety of the power plant went wrong and caused a fire which spewed radiation for 10 days. Clouds carrying radioactive particles drifted across Europe, causing decades of havoc for hundreds of thousands of people, both near the epicentre and thousands of miles away.\n\nThose living close to Chernobyl - over 100,000 people - were quickly rushed from the scene. A 20-mile exclusion zone was imposed around the damaged reactor. This was later expanded to cover more affected areas.\n\nIvan Ivanovich (pictured) sits in his bedroom in the home he refused to leave after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in 1986. After those close to the epicentre of the blast were evacuated, a 20-mile exclusion zone was imposed around the damaged reactor. This was later expanded to cover more affected areas\n\nSophia Biz outside her threadbare property. Almost 250,000 more people were moved out over the years but the people pictured here refused to leave\n\nCanadian photographer Robyn Von Swank, ventured into the depths of the Exclusion Zone to obtain these never before seen photographs of the individuals who defied government warnings to leave. The Zone has been deemed unfit to live in and it is against the law to do so. However, dozens of people still live out their daily lives in the prohibited area\n\nOver the next few months a further 234,000 people were moved out. Almost all left in a hurry. Some were given just a few hours to pack up all their belongings. Others were told they would only be gone a few days, but were never allowed back. Some simply locked their doors and waited for the fuss to die down.\n\nOver recent years, Canadian photographer Robyn Von Swank adventured into the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone. Initially she expected to photograph a town full of ghosts but was surprised to find that not all have deserted the toxic zone, even though it has been deemed unfit for human habitation. Ignoring safety concerns and the fact it's actually illegal to live in the red zone, dozens of people still go about their daily lives in the shadow of the forsaken reactor.\n\nAfter Robyn's first trip in 2016, she wanted to return to document those that defied the government and never left. She hired a private guide and he took her into parts of the Exclusion Zone that not many people can go to and she saw many abandoned villages.\n\nRobyn said that the people she met, who were largely in their 80s, were warm and welcoming when she arrived there\n\nDuring her visit, Robyn said that the main risk to her safety was wild animals. She added that the area has become a breeding ground for wolves and other species as there is no risk of them being shot and eaten by humans\n\nBizarrely, it was not the radiation that posed the biggest threat to the Canadian photographer even though thousands of people have died as a result of the nuclear disaster (estimates vary from 4,000-27,000 dead).\n\nAs Robyn was exploring one of the abandoned towns, she noticed footprints behind her and discovered that a pack of wolves were following her.\n\n'Thankfully, the predators have a bounty of prey to eat already, because the Zone continues to grow as a biodiverse forest where animals don't worry about being killed by humans anymore,' she recalled with a smile.\n\nThe individuals who decided to stay in the exclusion zone have little access to support and services in Ukraine and live in crumbling and dilapidated homes\n\nMany of the residents are older, in their seventies and eighties, but some are much younger.\n\nTravelling to the local grocery store for a bottle of vodka by bus can take the residents hours. Several families have relocated to the quiet, overwhelmingly cheap neighbourhoods surrounding Chernobyl in recent years\n\nSome residents survived Nazi invasion during WW2, the Chernobyl accident and Soviet rule over Ukraine. Radiation is estimated to have killed between 4,000 and 27,000 people since the disaster blast Some residents survived Nazi invasion during WW2, the Chernobyl accident and Soviet rule over Ukraine.\n\nRobyn visited the re-settlers who were all over the age of 80, except for two who were in their 50s. The Canadian arrived just in time for Russian New Year and was invited into the local's homes to enjoy a feast of cabbage rolls, pork fat, pickled mushrooms, blinis, potatoes and more Ukrainian cuisine.\n\n'The people were warm and welcoming and spoke openly about their histories. Some sobbed when speaking of the incident, having been affected so personally,' Robyn added.\n\nOne of the residents, Maria, is the only living person in her village and is miles away from anyone else - but she will never leave her home. She survived the Nazi invasion in World War 2, the Chernobyl accident and lived under Soviet rule. Another resident, Baba Olga was an old woman who never had any children so she had few visitors. But she once had a vibrant social life with the other residents. When Robyn left her house, Baba Olga stuffed her pockets full of candy and apples and hugged and kissed her affectionately.\n\nSomewhat paradoxically, the population of the exclusion zone is growing. Several families have relocated to the quiet, overwhelmingly cheap neighbourhoods surrounding Chernobyl in recent years, many fleeing the war that rages between Ukraine and Russia to this day.\n\nBaba Olga (pictured) was an old woman who never had any children so she had few visitors.
