Subscribe to the newsletter here .\n\nThe Interface is hosting its first live event on October 22nd at Manny\u2019s in San Francisco. Verge Silicon Valley editor Casey Newton will be speaking to misinformation researcher Renee DiResta about Facebook\u2019s efforts to shore up its defenses ahead of the 2020 election as well as the toll that policing the platform has on the contractor workforce that is largely responsible for it.\n\nDiResta is a 2019 Mozilla Fellow in media, misinformation, and trust who is investigating how fake news spreads across social networks. Onstage, Newton and DiResta will discuss the steps Facebook has taken to arm itself against malicious attacks as well as areas where it\u2019s currently vulnerable. As a bonus, they\u2019ll discuss how to spot misinformation on social networks.\n\nIt\u2019s the first live event for The Interface, and we hope it will lead to more talks around the country as we prepare for the 2020 US presidential election.\n\nJoin us on Tuesday, October 22nd, from 6PM to 9PM PT. We\u2019ll all be hanging out afterward to chat and answer questions if you have them.\n\nManny\u2019s\n\n3092 16th Street\n\nSan Francisco, CA, 94103\n\nTickets start at $5, and space is limited.
