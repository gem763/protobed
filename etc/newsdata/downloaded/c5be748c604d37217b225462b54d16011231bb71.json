It also inspired protests outside the conference, which was attended by people who paid a $13,500 fee to join Fortune\u2019s Most Powerful Women membership.\n\nAt the end of the heated 15-minute interview, Nielsen said she had originally come to the event to discuss cybersecurity, her area of expertise. PBS\u2019s Nawaz, however, was relentless in holding Nielsen to account for her role in family separation.\n\nNawaz pressed Nielsen on reports that staff in her own department and the health department, which took custody of the separated children, raised concerns about family separation.\n\nNielsen denied being told by staff that family separation could harm children and deflected a follow-up question about warnings from child welfare experts, which were made public months before zero tolerance was implemented.\n\nThe former secretary of state and 2016 presidential candidate, Clinton, said a scheduling conflict prevented her from attending the summit, though sources told reporters that Nielsen\u2019s appearance at the event was crucial to her deciding not to attend.\n\nHampton, executive producer of the documentary Surviving R Kelly, pulled out of the event last week and said: \u201cWhen every infant, toddler, child and teenager Nielsen is responsible for ripping from their families is released and reunited, when attempts at restitution are made, then perhaps she can face one of them for a public \u2018interview\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe rebellion against Nielsen\u2019s appearance at the forum was led by Credo Action, a progressive activist group, which organized multiple protests to target Nielsen with immigration groups Families Belong Together and Define American.\n\nAt the conference on Tuesday, Credo Action drove a van with a billboard featuring Nielsen\u2019s face and the words: \u201cPowerful women don\u2019t put kids in cages\u201d. The group also tried to hand conference attendees pamphlets explaining why they opposed Nielsen speaking at the event and encouraged people to protest with signs inside the conference.\n\nEarlier this month, Nielsen\u2019s successor, Kevin McAleenan, walked out of an immigration conference in Washington without delivering his scheduled speech when multiple protesters, including some from Credo, chanted over him. He resigned four days letter.\n\nAlison Klooster, a Fortune spokeswoman, said they brought in Nawaz to do the interview with \u201cthe clear understanding that this would be a no-holds-barred interview\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe believe that the most powerful women in business, who also happen to be some of the most powerful women in the world, have strong views about how the US administration has handled its immigration policy,\u201d Klooster said in an email. \u201cWe sought out an opportunity to bring the woman who was effectively responsible for that policy to ask her tough questions publicly and on stage about that policy.\u201d\n\nThe interview was bookended by Fortune moderators who acknowledged the controversy surrounding Nielsen\u2019s appearance and that the interview had been \u201ctense\u201d.", "description": "In a heated 15-minute public interview, the former US homeland security secretary defended her decision as protests raged outside", "authors": ["Amanda Holpuch"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98a944d4397fce5bd516757fe044635ccf88a573/446_358_4065_2439/master/4065.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0d57356fc9de5d4b74c6c0073b3a42a0", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
