Gaza\u2019s Hamas rulers are facing a rare and growing chorus of criticism, with little to show after 18 months of mass protests along the Israeli border organized by the Palestinian militant group. Gazans are increasingly questioning the high number of casualties and lack of success in lifting the Israeli blockade. Against this backdrop, Artima has launched his own peaceful version of the protest. (AP Photo/Adel Hana)\n\nGAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) \u2014 Ahmed Abu Artima was one of the founders of the \"Great March of Return,\" the weekly protests along Gaza's frontier with Israel meant to draw attention to the plight of the territory's 2 million people. But these days, he mostly avoids the demonstrations.\n\nHe is among a growing number of Gazans who believe the protests have lost their way. With little to show from 18 months of demonstrations beyond the hundreds of people killed or wounded by Israeli fire, many Gazans are beginning to question and even criticize the Hamas-led protests, a rarity in a territory where dissent is barely tolerated by the ruling Islamic militant group.\n\nFor several months now, Abu Artima has organized his own alternative protest. On a recent Wednesday, dozens of Palestinians gathered near the separation fence between Israel and Gaza, performing traditional dances and ballads between poem recitals and speeches by local community leaders. Children gathered around two camels decorated with embroidered saddles.\n\nAbu Artima's eyes sparkled as he watched. This is the kind of demonstration he envisioned when he and other young grassroots activists came up with the idea of building mass encampments along the fortified frontier. He calls it a protest that \"tries to deliver our message as safely as possible.\"\n\nHeld every two weeks, these events are in dramatic contrast to the main Friday protests.\n\nDirected by a committee comprised of Hamas and other Gaza militant groups, the Friday demonstrations are held against a backdrop of black smoke from burning tires. Protesters hurl rocks at Israeli troops, who respond with clouds of tear gas and gunfire. Ambulances scream back and forth, ferrying the wounded to field clinics and hospitals.\n\nWhen the protests began, Hamas quickly seized upon the popular idea and transformed the quiet gatherings into violent confrontations.\n\nUnder its direction, thousands of Palestinians have gathered at five sections of the fence each week, facing off against Israeli forces perched on earth mounds and in sniper positions. The Israeli troops fire live shots, rubber-covered steel pellets and tear gas, in what Israel says is a legitimate tactic to defend against attacks and border infiltrations.\n\nHamas says the violent protests, which are still attended by a few thousand people every Friday, are meant to force Israel to ease its crippling blockade. But the demonstrations have done little to improve conditions in Gaza, and have come at a high human cost.\n\nThe Gaza-based al-Mezan Center for Human Rights says 211 Palestinian protesters, most of them unarmed, have been shot dead during the demonstrations, including 46 under the age of 18. More than 18,000 have been wounded. The Health Ministry says 124 had amputations in lower limbs. One Israeli soldier has also been killed.\n\nWith Hamas dedicating this week's protest to \"child martyrs,\" U.N. Humanitarian Coordinator Jamie McGoldrick urged both sides to protect children. \"Boys and girls must never be targeted, put at risk or encouraged to participate in violence,\" he said.\n\nCalling his event \"The Return Journeys,\" Abu Artima says he is focused on his original idea of highlighting the desire of Palestinian refugees and their descendants to return to the lands they fled or were forced from during the 1948 war surrounding Israel's establishment. Some two-thirds of Gaza's population are refugees.\n\n\"We want to present a model for the people that we can send our voice by art and national songs,\" he said. \"Our presence here even without direct confrontation is a message of determination.\"\n\nWhile the \"right of return\" was the original message of the demonstrations, Hamas quickly turned the focus to the 12-year-old blockade imposed by Israel and Egypt after the Islamic militant group seized control of Gaza in 2007.\n\nThe blockade has devastated Gaza's economy and caused the unemployment rate to skyrocket to over 50%. Israel says the closure is needed to prevent Hamas from arming.\n\nHamas views the protests as a key form of leverage in getting the closures lifted, so it urges maximum participation. On days before protests, vehicles with loudspeakers mounted on their roofs tour Gaza streets and mosques urging families to head to the fence. On Friday, buses pick up participants from across the strip.", "description": "Ahmed Abu Artima was one of the founders of the \"Great March of Return,\" the weekly protests along Gaza's frontier with Israel meant to draw attention to the plight of the territory's 2 million people.
