What about a picture of an old horse and two tired, barefoot boys laboring in a stony field, backlit by the late afternoon sun?\n\nIf you think these scenes do sound sentimental, I think you\u2019re spot on. You might decide you wouldn\u2019t like them on that basis. After all, in some circles calling a painting \u201csentimental\u201d is just about the most damning thing you can say about it.\n\nYet, the pictures described above are by Winslow Homer \u2014 an artist with unrivaled prestige in the history of American art. It\u2019s just not cool to call Homer sentimental.\n\nSo, take a closer look. Painted in 1865, Homer\u2019s \u201cThe Brush Harrow\u201d is a very famous Civil War picture that shows those barefoot boys doing the work of men. They are doing the work of men because the men \u2014 more than 600,000 of them \u2014 did not return from war, leaving their families brokenhearted and often near-destitute.\n\nHomer painted the other picture \u2014 the boy looking out to sea \u2014 several years later, during a long summer stay in the port of Gloucester, Mass. This was in 1873. Homer was making his first serious foray into watercolors, the medium in which he made arguably his greatest work. He treated the subject of the boy waiting for his father\u2019s return first in watercolor, then in oil (the painting is in the National Gallery of Art), and then as a wood engraving.\n\nGloucester, at that time, was pulling in more fish than any port in America. But fishing out of Gloucester (as readers or watchers of \u201cThe Perfect Storm\u201d could appreciate) was a deadly business. The mortality rate for Gloucester fisherman was higher than for Union soldiers during the Civil War. Between 1866 and 1890, more than 380 schooners and 2,450 Gloucester men never returned from the fishing grounds.\n\n[I\u2019ve seen plenty of beautiful artworks. But the Matisse Chapel overwhelmed me.]\n\nIn a single storm on Aug. 24, 1873, nine Gloucester vessels and 128 fishermen were lost. Homer was there. He digested the news: \u201cDay by day the sad news came,\u201d read one report, \u201cand there is mourning throughout the town as we pen this article. Wives are weeping for their husbands \u2026 sisters are mourning for brothers, and little children ask, in plaintive voices, \u2018Why does not father come home?\u2019 \u201d\n\nHow many of the dozens of children Homer rendered in watercolor that year might have been fatherless? It\u2019s impossible to know.\n\nTwentieth century critics who sensed both the greatness and the modernity of Homer strenuously denied what was in front of their eyes. They tied themselves in knots trying to explain why his art was not sentimental, why his vision was actually manly, modern, clear-eyed and tough.\n\nThey were wasting their energies, as Rebecca Bedell explains in her wise and brilliant 2018 book, \u201cMoved to Tears: Rethinking the Art of the Sentimental in the United States.\u201d Bedell describes Homer as \u201camong the greatest, if not the greatest, of American sentimental artists.\u201d He was, she continues, \u201cdeeply and profoundly empathetic, often tender, as well as broadly and pervasively nostalgic.\u201d\n\nThere are different ways to define \u201csentimental.\u201d But if it means \u201cfull of feeling,\u201d Homer had every right to respond to his subjects with feeling. He had lived and worked through the Civil War, seen it up close. In Gloucester, he had endured that storm, witnessed its aftermath.\n\nTwo Homer exhibitions in Massachusetts \u2014 worth traveling to see \u2014 present an opportunity to think not only about why we like Homer so much but about what we want, fundamentally, from art. How much feeling \u2014 not false feeling but powerful emotion tethered to reality \u2014 can we take?\n\nA lot, Bedell would argue. And it might be good for us. Sentimentality may have become a dirty word in the 20th century. But \u201cfor more than a hundred years,\u201d writes Bedell, \u201cfrom the late 18th century to the late 19th century, the sentimental was one of the most vital, protean, productive forces shaping the nation\u2019s art.\n\n\u201cIt defined for art an activist, interventionist role in the public realm,\u201d she continues. And it gave art \u201cthe power to touch, educate, and transform its audience\u2019s feelings, to connect them to others, and, through these means, to effect social change.\u201d\n\nHomer is associated with the Civil War, with children (especially boys) and with the sea. What makes these two shows so stimulating is that, in unexpected ways, they connect all three. In fact, the more you think about both shows, the more they overlap.\n\nThe more notable of the two is \u201cHomer at the Beach: A Marine Painter\u2019s Journey, 1869-1880\u201d at the Cape Ann Museum in Gloucester. The setting is apt. Between those years, Homer made the majority of his marine pictures (including his first big burst of watercolors) in Gloucester. Organized by William H. Cross, the show is just upstairs from permanent galleries filled with the luminous marine paintings of Fitz Henry Lane, a generation older than Homer. It boasts terrific loans, including two versions of \u201cWaiting for Dad (Longing)\u201d and its companion engraving, \u201cDad\u2019s Coming!,\u201d and is accompanied by an excellent catalogue.\n\n\n\n\u201cWaiting for Dad (Longing),\u201d 1873. (Winslow Homer/Mills College Art Museum/Jane C. Tolman)\n\n\u201cDad's Coming!,\u201d 1873. (Winslow Homer/National Gallery of Art)\n\nThere are oil paintings, wood engravings, drawings, maps, costumes and photographs, but the show is especially rich in Homer\u2019s ravishing watercolors. Overall, it offers an intimate, textured sense of the many aspects of coastal life that appealed to Homer in the first decade of his career as a painter.\n\nDespite his proven skills as an illustrator, Homer\u2019s first beach paintings, made at Long Beach, N.J., in 1868-1869, were not especially promising. Yet critics who faulted them still registered how much feeling Homer had in him. \u201cFeeling cannot be learned; execution can,\u201d wrote one. \u201cMr. Homer is full of the former.\u201d\n\n\u201cWinslow Homer: Eyewitness\u201d at Harvard Art Museums is drawn almost entirely from the university\u2019s collection. Its focus is the Civil War years, which Homer spent as a \u201cSpecial Artist\u201d on assignment for Harper\u2019s Weekly. The show is rounded out by some wonderful late watercolors, including \u201cSailboat and Fourth of July Fireworks\u201d and \u201cSea Garden, Bahamas.\u201d\n\nThe show\u2019s curators, Makeda Best and Ethan Lasser, are interested in the tension in Homer\u2019s work between eyewitness reportage and pictorial storytelling. Like today\u2019s front line photojournalists, Homer and his competitors were trying to forge a kind of \u201ceyewitness aesthetic.\u201d They filled their illustrations with telling details and looked for ways to emphasize the immediacy and credibility that their own presence at the scene gave them.\n\nAt the same time, they were telling stories. And the stories they told inevitably appealed to sentiment. Stories are mired in subjectivity, compromising their claims to truth. They transform real people (who are complex and unknowable) into types, and real situations (which are messy and fluid) into legible tableaux. Juggling all this, for both artists and writers, is endlessly challenging. There is always a cost; there are always complicating factors.\n\n\n\n\u201cFive Boys at the Shore, Gloucester,\u201d 1880. (Winslow Homer/Jamie Wyeth)\n\nSentimentality is one issue. There is also the question of tact. When you are covering war for an audience including children, wives and mothers, for instance, how much of the reality of the battlefield should you show? In Homer\u2019s judgment, very little. He was more interested in the amusements and vexations of camp life, in scenes of preparation and aftermath. But he brought tremendous subtlety and interest to these subjects.\n\nRace came into it. If the art of illustration involves \u201ctypes,\u201d when does a recognizable \u201ctype\u201d become a degrading caricature? How clearly did Homer see the distinction?\n\nMoreover, if the Civil War was about slavery, what were the wider implications of a Union artist showing freed black people\u2019s labor, thereby acknowledging their contribution to the common cause? And what might this mean for their citizenship rights? Homer\u2019s war pictures can seem evasive on these points, as if he didn\u2019t want to tell stories that might make his audience uncomfortable.\n\nHomer was, as Bedell points out, part of a group of painters who specialized in scenes of nostalgia. The qualities that made him different, she writes \u2014 his ability to distill and concentrate scenes by the judicious removal of detail and his feeling for narrative ambiguity (is the boy\u2019s fisherman dad visible on the horizon or not?) \u2014 actually encourage the viewer\u2019s involvement and urge to identify. These qualities, she writes, make Homer \u201ca better sentimental painter not an unsentimental one.\u201d\n\nThere should be a premium on truth in art. But there should also be no such thing as too much feeling.\n\nHomer at the Beach: A Marine Painter\u2019s Journey, 1869-1880 Through Dec. 1 at the Cape Ann Museum, Gloucester, Mass. capeannmuseum.org.
