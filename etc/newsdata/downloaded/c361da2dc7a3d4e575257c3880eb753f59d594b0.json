You'll float, too... wearing this creepy clown costume based on the new IT movies. Freak your fellow party guests out by wearing this Pennywise latex mask. The outfit also includes a clown shirt with ruffle neck collar, so all you need to add is trousers. Complete the look with a red balloon if you're going all-out.\n\nWith the the second installment based on Stephen King's horror novel, IT Chapter Two earning rave reviews when it was released in September, Pennywise is surely a favourite outfit choice to shock this Halloween.\n\nBuy now\n\nIt's been three years since Margot Robbie graced our screens as Harley Quinn in Suicide Squad. But in case you didn't know, Robbie is reprising her role as the femme fatale for spin-off film Birds of Prey, which is set to be released next February.\n\nDue to the buzz around the film, the iconic red and blue outfit is having a resurgence. This Harley Quinn official licensed costume includes a jacket, shirt, shorts, belt and tights.\n\nAmazon also sells the Harley Quinn wig starting from \u00a311.99, and grab a blow up baseball bat to complete the look for just \u00a34.99.\n\nBuy now\n\nEmma Stone is set to play a young Cruella de Vil in the upcoming live action remake of 101 Dalmatians, so this Disney villain is another hot trend for Halloween 2019. Unfortunately, we'll have to wait until May 2021 to see Stone on-screen as the movie is being filmed as we speak.\n\nBut in the meantime, channel your inner Cruella with this dalmatian 'kit', which includes the all-important two-tone wig. It also comes with a fancy cape, bag, red gloves and cigarette holder. Bringing your own dog to the party is optional.\n\nBuy now\n\nWith Season Three of the cult Netflix show airing this summer, it's no surprise Stranger Things is a top choice for Halloween inspiration this year. You're spoilt for choice for characters, but Eleven in her pink Peter Pan dress and tube socks is a strong look and a sure winner if you're off to a Halloween party.\n\nIt's also a really easy look to pull off if you're feeling a bit lazy with your outfit choice. The blonde wig isn't included with this dress, but you can buy one that would fit the bill on Amazon. Prices start from \u00a312.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe new Joker movie is released in the UK on October 4, so it seems right that we should include this classic costume on our list. While we all loved the late Heath Ledger's version, this time the Joker mantle has been handed to Joaquin Phoenix. If the eight-minute standing ovation it got on its premiere at the Venice Film Festival is anything to go by, it looks set to earn rave reviews.\n\nThis Joker outfit comes with a jacket with attached vest and bow tie, trousers, gloves and a mask. But if might be scarier and more effective to do your own Joker make-up...\n\n\n\n\n\nBuy now\n\nPinterest recently revealed mermaids are a top trend for Halloween this year, and with the Disney live action remake in the pipeline, there's no better time to channel your inner Ariel. While we may have to wait a little to see The Little Mermaid hit cinemas (filming is rumoured to start in April 2020) it's a great choice for those who are planning to dress up on October 31.\n\nOf course, Halloween is all about the make-up, so you can make your Ariel as spooky as you want. Check out the great tutorials online for some seriously cool mermaid make-up ideas. A top tip is to use fishnet tights for the scales.\n\nThis outfit includes the shell top and shiny blue fishtail skirt. All you need to do is add an Ariel wig. Buy one with shells for just \u00a311, also available on Amazon.\n\n\n\n\n\nBuy now\n\nFor just \u00a312, this is a bargain outfit and also a genius one. Actor Andrew Scott made women across the country swoon with his portrayal of the Hot Priest in the second season of Fleabag. You could even turn up with some Marks and Spencer gin and tonics, which saw a surge in sales when the priest drank them on the show.\n\nThe priest costume includes robe with attached dog collar. If you're in a couple, your other half could dress like Fleabag in a black jumpsuit similar to the one she wore for the infamous family dinner. Just add a slick of red lipstick and a cigarette to complete the look.\n\n\n\n\n\nBuy now\n\nIt might be a bit tricky to bring a dragon along as an accessory, but turning up to the party as Daenerys Targaryen from Game of Thrones is a definite winner. This Dragon Mother cosplay costume includes a blue floor-length dress and belt. If you've got long blonde hair anyway, all you need do is curl it. Adding a crown is optional.\n\nIf you need a wig to complete the look, you can also buy one from Amazon, with prices starting from just \u00a312.99. Bonus points if you can remember Daenerys' full name, which is Daenerys of the House Targaryen, the First of Her Name, The Unburnt, Queen of the Andals, the Rhoynar and the First Men, Queen of Meereen, Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, Protector of the Realm, Lady Regent of the Seven Kingdoms, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons.\n\n\n\n\n\nBuy now\n\nMailOnline may earn commission on sales from the links on this page.", "description": "Whether you want to go full on horror or at the very least raise a laugh, we've rounded up some of the best fancy dress ideas for 2019 which are guaranteed to get you spooked this Halloween.", "authors": ["Katie Wilson For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/03/20/19269494-0-image-a-127_1570132726043.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
