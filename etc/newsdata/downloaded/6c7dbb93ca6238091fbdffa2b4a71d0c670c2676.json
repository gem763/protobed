Wilson also denied the allegations. According to Us Weekly, Jim filed divorce papers on Friday.\n\nIn her blog post, titled \"Broken,\" Meghan discussed the hurt she felt over her husband's \"sexting\" scandal in June. The former baseball player admitted that he \u201cengaged in an inappropriate conversation\u201d with another woman who was not the nanny, but denied physical infidelity.\n\nMEGHAN KING EDMONDS AND JIM EDMONDS TO DIVORCE AFTER FIVE YEARS OF MARRIAGE\n\n\u201cOut of respect for my children and my family, I find it unnecessary to go into all the gritty details,\" Meghan said. \"What I will say is that, in the wake of the sexting situation, my husband was drinking and partying with much younger women, including several of our babysitters, and I found this galavanting inappropriate, immature and downright odd.\"\n\nShe continued: \u201cWhile I initially wrote it off because during several of these outings, his 22-year-old daughter was present, given his previous indiscretions, I was uncomfortable. Even more so when he started lying about where he was going or who he was going with -- and deleting entire text conversations on his phone with several of these young women.\n\n\"For the record, after the sexting affair he had agreed with our therapist that he would be totally transparent and never delete messages or conversations and he would also keep his location available on his phone,\" Meghan pointed out.\n\nMEGHAN KING EDMONDS' NANNY SPEAKS OUT ABOUT ALLEGED AFFAIR WITH STAR'S HUSBAND JIM\n\nShe then addressed a photo of her husband and the nanny at a hockey game, according to People.\n\nMeghan, 35, claimed that \"Jim repeatedly lied about\" the outing, so she asked her husband to include her on texts he sent to the babysitter, to which he said \"no.\"\n\n\"Another major red flag,\" she said. \"To be clear, I don\u2019t know if Jim slept with our babysitter or whether they were just being exceedingly inappropriate by hanging out socially without either of them telling me (and Jim expressly lying to me about it). I\u2019ve gone back and forth with my thoughts for a couple [of] days but as I write this, I don\u2019t think he did. But I still don\u2019t understand why he\u2019d lie. And why would she lie?\u201d\n\nMeghan also recalled tabloids finding out about her divorce proceedings, despite never making a public statement.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cI am broken for my family,\" she said. \"I am buried in despair. I cry at the drop of a hat. But I am enduring. I will set an example for my children and I will teach them to love and respect people while also knowing how to condone unethical or wrong behavior. I will facilitate healthy, consistent and ongoing relationships with their father and with his family despite the hurt I feel from them because my children should not reap the karma of my personal situations.\u201d\n\nA rep for Jim Edmonds did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment.", "description": "Meghan King Edmonds, star of \"Real Housewives of Orange County,\" addressed her husband's alleged cheating scandal in a lengthy blog post\u00a0on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Nate Day"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/07/edmonds-getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
