What it has created is uncertainty in the market and perhaps a certain worry amongst equipment suppliers,\" he told Reuters. \"So if we see anything, it's some short-term headwind rather than something positive\".\n\n($1 = 9.7799 Swedish crowns) (Reporting by Helena Soderpalm and Johannes Hellstrom; Editing by Simon Johnson and Mark Potter)", "description": "Telecoms equipment maker Ericsson beat quarterly core earnings expectations on Thursday and lifted its market forecast for this year and its sales target for 2020, saying demand for superfast 5G networks was taking off earlier than expected.  5G networks are at the centre of a brewing technology war", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
