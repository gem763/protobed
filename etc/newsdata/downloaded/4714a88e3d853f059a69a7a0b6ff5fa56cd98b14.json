Both children were believed to be under the age of 12 and both were killed, he said.\n\nHe portrayed Baghdadi as isolated at his Syrian compound, just four miles from the Turkish border, saying fighters from other militant groups nearby probably did not even know he was there. McKenzie suggested it was unlikely that Baghdadi used the Internet or had digital connections to the outside world.\n\n\"I think you'd find (he was using) probably a messenger system that allows you to put something on a floppy or on a bit of electronics and have someone physically move it somewhere,\" he said.\n\nMcKenzie said Islamic State would likely try to stage some kind of retaliatory attack.\n\n\"We suspect they will try some form of retribution attack. And we are postured and prepared for that,\" he said.\n\nWHIMPERING AND CRYING?\n\nMcKenzie did not back up or knock down Trump's dramatic account of Baghdadi's final moments, which the president delivered during a televised address to the nation on Sunday. Trump said Baghdadi \"died a coward \u2014 crying, whimpering, screaming.\" https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-death-isis-leader-abu-bakr-al-baghdadi\n\nAsked about Trump's account, McKenzie said: \"About Baghdadi's last moments, I can tell you this: He crawled into a hole with two small children and blew himself up as his people stayed on the ground.\"\n\n\"So you can deduce what kind of person he is based on that activity... I'm not able to confirm anything else about his last seconds. I just can't confirm that one way or another.\"\n\nOn Monday, Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, also declined to confirm Trump's account, saying he presumed Trump got that information from his direct conversations with members of the elite unit that conducted the operation. Milley had not yet spoken with them, he said.\n\nMcKenzie suggested the U.S. military had secured a large amount of intelligence about Islamic State's activities during the raid.\n\n\"While the assault force was securing the remains, they also secured whatever documentation and electronics we could find, which was substantial,\" McKenzie said, declining to provide further details.\n\nMcKenzie said Turkey's incursion into Syria this month, and the U.S. pullback from the border, was not a factor in deciding the timing of the raid. Instead, McKenzie pointed to a host of other factors, including the amount of moonlight.\n\n\"We struck because the time is about right to do it then, given the totality of the intelligence and the other factors that would affect the raid force going into and coming out,\" McKenzie said.
