The result was a scale of \u201cwater stress\u201d \u2014 how close a country comes to draining its annual water stores in a typical year.\n\nOf course, many years are not typical, and unpredictable weather patterns of a changing climate can have drastic consequences. In areas of high or extremely high water stress, said Betsy Otto, director of WRI\u2019s Global Water Program, \"if you then hit a drought ... you\u2019re really in trouble, because you\u2019re already using most of what you have.\u201d\n\nThe United States ranked 71st of 189 countries, and low-medium on the stress scale, meaning we are pulling out just under 20 percent of our available water.\n\nExtremely high risk of water stress States with higher water use per day NM High CA AZ CO NE Medium to high WY NJ TX FL NC DE RI MA KS NV AR VA GA ID Low to medium ND SC MT NH WI MN OR SD CT IN PA AK MO OK OH UT LA VT NY KY Low WA WV MD IL MS IA TN AL MI ME DC Circles are sized to population Extremely high risk of water stress States with higher water use per day NM High CA AZ CO NE Medium to high WY NJ TX FL NC DE RI MA KS NV AR VA GA Low to medium ID ND SC MT NH WI OR MN SD CT IN PA AK MO OK OH UT LA VT NY KY Low WA WV MD IL MS IA TN AL MI ME DC Circles are sized to population Extremely high risk of water stress NM States with higher water use per day High CA AZ CO NE Medium to high NJ WY TX FL NC DE RI KS MA AR NV VA Low to medium GA ID MT ND SC MN NH OR WI CT SD IN AK MO PA OK OH UT LA VT KY Low NY WA WV MS MD IA IL TN AL MI ME DC Circles are sized to population Extremely high risk of water stress NM States with higher water use per day High CA AZ CO NE Medium to high NJ WY TX FL NC DE RI KS AR MA NV VA Low to medium GA ID MT ND SC MN NH OR WI CT SD IN PA AK MO OK OH UT LA VT KY Low NY WA WV MS MD IA IL TN AL MI ME DC Circles are sized to population\n\nBut within the country, the push-and-pull for water varies greatly. Paul Reig, an environmental scientist who leads Aqueduct, helped explain why.\n\nThe southwest is most stressed\n\nBecause much of the territory is naturally arid, southwestern states are in the most precarious positions when it comes to water, Reig said.\n\nNew Mexico, for instance, was the only state in the \u201cextremely high\u201d category, earning the same alarming score (4.26 on a five-point scale) as the United Arab Emirates, which was the 10th most-stressed in the world.\n\nNew Mexico\u2019s demand sucks up more than 80 percent of the largely arid state\u2019s annual supply. That leaves 20 percent, but such a narrow margin means that it may have trouble withstanding an extended drought or an increase in demand from population or industry growth.\n\nNeighboring Arizona was among four states in the somewhat-less-perilous \u201chigh stress\u201d category.\n\nCalifornia uses more water than any state\n\nAmple water resources in northern areas of California are balanced by huge demands from Central Valley agriculture and the large populations in hotter, drier southern areas such as Los Angeles and San Diego.\n\nCalifornia uses the most water of any state, according to the U.S. Geological Survey, up to 9 percent of all withdrawals from the national supply.\n\nCentral Florida is straining its aquifer\n\nOn the other coast, Florida demonstrates that a state surrounded by seas and perforated by lakes and rivers can still have a water problem.\n\nDesalinization of saltwater is expensive and often not practical. The enormous Floridan aquifer provides most of the area\u2019s freshwater, but demand is high. Florida uses the fourth-most water of any state. Reig said it also supplies up to 7 percent of the water used for the country\u2019s thermoelectric power.\n\nStress appears in seemingly unlikely areas\n\nOnly part of Colorado is snowy peaks and mountain streams. Much of the eastern half of the state is largely flat, fairly dry agricultural land that uses an enormous amount of water for irrigation. Same for Colorado\u2019s northeast neighbor, Nebraska.\n\nEven the \u201cLand of 10,000 Lakes\u201d can have water issues. Parts of Minnesota and Wisconsin border Great Lakes, and in those places water is plentiful, Reig said. But other heavily agricultural parts of the states rely on limited resources that tend to fluctuate.\n\nMuch of the world is worse\n\nThe U.S. water picture is far less grim than that of other places.\n\nSeventeen countries ranked in the \u201cextremely high stress\u201d category, and they are home to about a quarter of the world\u2019s population.\n\nASIA Qatar Israel Extremely high risk of water stress AFRICA Lebanon Libya Eritrea EUROPE AMERICA India San Marino Chile Mexico High Spain Egypt OCEANIA Medium to high China Australia France Indonesia U.S. Low to medium UK Russia Low Norway China and India are not displayed to scale.

After two straight unusually weak monsoon seasons, taps in the city of Chennai ran dry in June.\n\nIn South Africa, Cape Town only narrowly avoided Chennai\u2019s fate in 2018 after drastically curbing water use. Mexico City, meanwhile, is sinking because so much groundwater is being pulled out, Otto said.\n\nNot all the news is bad\n\nFourteen countries had a score of 0.0, meaning either supply is very high, demand is very low or both. Those include countries such as Uruguay, Norway, Jamaica and Equatorial Guinea.\n\nAnd in the United States? Many places are in good shape, but this may be the only metric ever in which D.C.'s stress level ranks lowest in the country.\n\nNote: Reig said that small islands are very difficult to model because they\u2019re not part of a watershed. So Hawaii and some island nations are not included in the data.", "description": "Pockets in several U.S. states \u2014 and across the globe \u2014 are draining their limited water supplies.", "authors": ["Bonnie Berkowitz", "Graphics Reporter", "Adrian Blanco", "Graphics Intern"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/W6ulK_XmqyXALMELTfD2VmXM9eg=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FJAAAF3HXJE27PIQZSZKLPQYBI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-06"}
