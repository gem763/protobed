It's too hard for me now. I get more and more depressed.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n(Image: Isopix/REX)\n\n\"I never had these feelings before. I cry a lot. A neurologist stayed with me the whole night while I had one spasm after another.\n\n\"She said it wasn't an epileptic seizure but just the body screaming, 'I'm in so much pain. I'm done.'\"\n\nVervoort, the face of the Rio Olympics where she took a silver medal, says she has been left deeply depressed by excruciating pain.\n\nShe suffered from a form of progressive tetraplegia which has left her doctors mystified. One of her few comforts is her loyal Labrador Zenn, who was rarely far from her side.\n\nAnd despite her terrible condition, she retained a sense of humour, mocking Donald Trump and laughing at her dog from her hospital bed in Brussels University Hospital when she had surgery.\n\nHer book, The Other Side of the Coin, captured the hearts of the Belgian public and saw her rival even Manchester City star Kevin De Bruyne for sporting popularity.\n\nWhat is progressive tetraplegia?\n\nThe debilitating physical condition is also known as quadriplegia and is a paralysis that takes away the use of all four limbs and the torso.\n\nVervoort's condition began in her Achilles and reportedly stemmed from a rare deformity between her fifth and sixth cerebral vertebrae.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nShe previously said: \"I'm a Taurus. If I want something, I go for it. I never give up easily. I didn't want to accept that I would end up in a wheelchair. But in 2000 I couldn't do it any longer.\n\n\"I'm paralysed all the way to my breasts. My finger function is going down as well. I have such a strong heart, but the pain medication is doing nothing any more.\"\n\nVervoort's honours\n\nParalympics: 1x gold (London 2012, T52 100m), 2x silver (London 2012, T52 200m and Rio 2016, T52 400m), 1x bronze (Rio 2016, T52 100m)\n\nWorld Championships: 3x gold (Doha 2015, T52 100m, 200m, 400m)", "description": "London 2012 gold medallist had incurable degenerative muscle disease which caused constant pain", "authors": ["Gareth Bicknell", "Image", "Photonews Via Getty Images", "Getty Images", "Isopix Rex"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article8777125.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/Marieke-Vervoort.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
