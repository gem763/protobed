REUTERS/Umit Bektas\n\nAll four measures passed by unanimous voice vote, as members of Congress - Democrats and Republicans - said they wanted to take an aggressive stance on China and show support for Hong Kong following four months of unrest in the city.\n\nThe measures come as the White House engages in delicate talks with Beijing to resolve a crippling trade war, with U.S. Treasury yields edging lower on Tuesday as investors pared back expectations that an agreement was at hand.\n\nOne of the measures, the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, would require the U.S. secretary of state to certify every year that Hong Kong retained its autonomy in order to keep receiving the special treatment that has allowed it to be a major financial center.\n\nA second, the Protect Hong Kong Act, would bar commercial exports of military and crowd-control items that Hong Kong police could use against demonstrators.\n\nChina\u2019s foreign ministry accused the U.S. lawmakers of \u201csinister intentions\u201d to undermine Hong Kong\u2019s stability and warned that bilateral relations would be damaged should the measures become law.\n\n\u201cChina must take effective measures to firmly safeguard its sovereignty, security, and development interests,\u201d ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said in a statement.\n\nThe Senate has not yet scheduled votes on the legislation, which would send the measures to the White House for Trump to sign into law or veto. However, a Foreign Relations Committee aide said votes on Hong Kong-related measures were expected in the chamber in the coming weeks.\n\nThe third measure passed by the House is a non-binding resolution recognizing Hong Kong\u2019s relationship to the United States, condemning Beijing\u2019s \u201cinterference\u201d in its affairs, and supporting the right of the city\u2019s residents to protest.\n\nThe Hong Kong government expressed regret over the passage of the legislation and reiterated that foreign legislatures should not interfere in the city\u2019s internal affairs.\n\nThe fourth measure was another non-binding House resolution commending Canada for its actions related to a U.S. request to extradite Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of Chinese telecom giant Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL], who was arrested in Canada in December.\n\nMeng is charged in the United States with bank fraud and is accused of misleading HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA.L) about Huawei\u2019s business in Iran, which is under U.S. sanctions. Meng has said she is innocent and is fighting extradition.\n\nThe United States has accused Huawei of stealing American intellectual property and violating Iran sanctions. Many Republican and Democratic members of Congress say they view the company as a security threat.\n\nHong Kong has been rocked by at times violent protests over concerns Beijing is tightening its grip on the former British colony and eroding its democratic system.\n\nBeijing rejects the charge and accuses Western countries, like the United States and Britain, of stirring up trouble.\n\nThe unrest poses the biggest popular challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012. He has warned that any attempt to divide China would be crushed.", "description": "The U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday passed four pieces of legislation taking a hard line on China, three related to pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong and one commending Canada in its dispute over the extradition of a Chinese telecom executive.", "authors": ["Patricia Zengerle", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441323100&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E24O", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
