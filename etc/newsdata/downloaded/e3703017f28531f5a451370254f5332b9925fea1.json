Clay and DePrimo served together in Marja, Afghanistan, and now, almost a decade later, live down the street from each other. (Eamon Queeney/For The Washington Post)\n\nRyan Clay and Anthony \u201cRocco\u201d DePrimo were in different places in life when they met as Marines more than 12 years ago.\n\nClay was a combat instructor who already had seen war in Afghanistan and Iraq, where he earned a Purple Heart.\n\nDePrimo was fresh out of high school and boot camp, a self-described former \u201cpretty-boy dude\u201d who followed in his father\u2019s footsteps to become a Marine.\n\n\u201cRocco used to hate me,\u201d Clay said, smirking slightly.\n\n\u201cYeah!\u201d DePrimo responded, his face lighting up. \u201cThere was probably some hatred there.\u201d\n\nThat was before they served together in the largest single battle of the Afghan war, in which more than 15,000 U.S., British, Afghan and other coalition troops fought to take control of the Taliban stronghold of Marja nine years ago.\n\nThat was before they lost brothers in arms together. Before DePrimo struggled with transitioning out of the military and drinking too much, and Clay survived an explosion that knocked him off his feet in Afghanistan and later a stroke.\n\nNow the two are friends and part of a generation of war veterans who are waiting to see how the United States\u2019 longest conflict might end.\n\nSome 775,477 U.S. veterans and service members have deployed to Afghanistan since the U.S. war there began after the 9/11 terrorist attacks 18 years ago this week, including 28,267 who have gone five or more times, according to Pentagon statistics released to The Washington Post. Nearly 2,400 American troops have died there, including 16 in combat action this year, and more than 20,000 have been wounded.\n\nPresident Trump repeatedly has vowed to bring the troops home. But on Saturday, he abruptly called off negotiations between U.S. diplomats and Taliban leaders and canceled a secret meeting planned at Camp David. It is not clear if Trump will remove some of the more than 14,000 U.S. troops who are deployed without a deal, or if talks can be jump-started.\n\n\n\nStaff Sgt. Ryan Clay, left, and Cpl.

Tommy Bellegarde/U.S. Marine Corps)\n\nThe span of the conflict has prompted some veterans to question what has been accomplished. The nonpartisan Pew Research Center reported in July that 58 percent of veterans it surveyed said the war in Afghanistan was not worth it.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of mixed feelings, and just feeling, \u2018I don\u2019t know how I feel about it,\u2019 \u201d DePrimo said. \u201cMaybe this is how the Vietnam vets felt. I\u2019d like to think that\u2019s possibly true \u2014 having the same feelings.\u201d\n\n'My nightmare'\n\nOn a cold morning in February 2010, Clay, DePrimo and the rest of their unit \u2014 the 3rd Platoon of India Company, 3rd Battalion, 6th Marines \u2014 landed in helicopters near Marja, in the southern province of Helmand. The rural, largely desert area was home to hundreds of Taliban fighters and fields divided by muddy canals and fields that grow opium poppies in the spring.\n\nFor days, the Marines hiked to get closer to the enemy, uncertain when the fighting would start. They dug holes and shared them at night to escape the brutal cold.\n\n\u201cWe had Marines burning their own socks to stay warm,\u201d Clay recalled.\n\n\n\nOn Feb. 13, they crossed the \u201cline of departure\u201d on the map marking the Marja boundary. Gunfire punctuated the air. Two explosives disposal technicians fighting alongside the platoon, Gunnery Sgt. Ralph E. Pate Jr. and Sgt. John Morris, disarmed more than 20 bombs early in the operation, Clay said.\n\nThe platoon escaped without any fatalities, but four Marines in the battalion of 1,000 were killed between Feb. 17 and Feb. 21.\n\n\n\nA U.S. Marine of 3rd Battalion, 6th Marines, holds a dog tag of a fallen comrade as he gives his final respects during a memorial ceremony for four fallen comrades, at their base in Marja on March 26, 2010.

(Mauricio Lima/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nIn March, the platoon was assigned to take over a dilapidated yellow schoolhouse, which was inside a walled courtyard the size of a football field in northern Marja. Clay, a staff sergeant, was put in charge of operations on site, while his platoon commander, 1st Lt. Jackson Smith, led another part of the unit nearby.\n\nThe attacks began immediately. Squads of Marines, including one led by DePrimo, a corporal, were repeatedly ambushed with machine guns, rifles and rocket-propelled grenades a few hundreds yards from their base. Several were wounded in murky fights in which friend and foe were hard to discern, and Taliban fighters zoomed away on motorcycles.\n\nIn one hair-raising battle, insurgents shot Lance Cpl. Matthew T. Earle, puncturing both of his lungs. Navy Petty Officer 3rd Class Matthew A. Dishmon, a hospital corpsman, dragged him to safety under gunfire, earning a Bronze Star with V for his valor.\n\n\u201cThe yellow schoolhouse, in my opinion, was my nightmare,\u201d Clay said. \u201cEvery night I\u2019d go to bed and no one was killed, I\u2019d thank God and hope that tomorrow was not worse than today.\u201d\n\nBy the end of the deployment in August, nine Marines in the battalion had been killed. At least 86 earned Purple Hearts for being wounded in combat.\n\nComing home\n\nWhen the unit returned home to Camp Lejeune in North Carolina, the Marines began scattering.\n\nDePrimo left the military in May 2011, disillusioned with his options. He bounced around community colleges in South Carolina and Florida and learned to operate a crane in Georgia, though by the time he finished training he didn\u2019t want to do that anymore.\n\nHe also drank too much, to the point that he eventually quit hard alcohol, he said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that there was anything easy about getting out,\u201d DePrimo said of leaving the military. \u201cI can\u2019t ever say I felt alone, but I secluded myself a lot just to kind of get away from a lot that was going on and what had transpired. A lot of it was me just not taking the right steps. It was all of the things I knew I shouldn\u2019t be doing, but it was like, \u2018Okay, whatever.\u2019 \u201d\n\nClay continued his career and graduated from drill instructor school in Parris Island, S.C., in June 2011 with DePrimo watching. But a few weeks later, his life changed.\n\nWhile barking orders to recruits, he felt a \u201cpop\u201d in his head and crushing pain. He was having a stroke.\n\nFor six weeks, Clay underwent physical therapy, walking with a cane and learning how to do basic tasks such as buttoning his clothes. He recovered, but his Marine Corps career was over. Doctors told him the explosion in Marja could have been responsible.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no sense in fighting it when they\u2019re going to retire you anyway,\u201d Clay said. \u201cSo be grateful and thankful that I\u2019m still here.\u201d\n\nBack in Marja, violence was plummeting, but the war raged on in other parts of the country.\n\n\n\nRyan Clay (Eamon Queeney/For The Washington Post)\n\nRocco DePrimo (Eamon Queeney/For The Washington Post)\n\nOn June 26, 2011, Pate, the Marine so admired for his work disarming bombs, was killed in an explosion in Sangin, about 70 miles northeast of Marja.\n\nA couple weeks later, Sgt. Ian McConnell, 24, another Marine who served at the schoolhouse, died by suicide in California. Afghanistan weighed on him heavily, said his sister, Meg Schellinger, of Eagan, Minn.\n\n\u201cEven today, I\u2019m still shocked,\u201d she said. \u201cYeah, he\u2019d been pulling back and not really talking with me as much lately, but it just wasn\u2019t Ian, you know?\u201d\n\nAs the years passed, Marja again largely fell to the Taliban.\n\nKeeping a boundary in place\n\nSince returning home, some former members of the platoon have flourished, and others have struggled. Lance Cpl. Dominic Draper died in a car wreck in 2016, after surviving a roadside bomb in Marja that destroyed his vehicle while he was in its gun turret.\n\n\n\nSmith, 34, who is now a lawyer in New Orleans, said he is proud that every member of his platoon survived the deployment and tries to remind them that they have no control over how the war has gone. He recently got engaged.\n\n\u201cIf you try to zoom out any further in terms of, \u2018What\u2019s our mission here?\u2019 you get very quickly into the realm of things over which you have absolutely no control,\u201d he said. \u201cKeeping that boundary in place is very important in terms of dealing with the bitterness that some guys may have.\u201d\n\nDePrimo and Clay settled near each other and took jobs in Statesville, N.C., a small city north of Charlotte with an old-fashioned downtown. That they live near each other happened by coincidence, but they spend time together frequently.\n\nDePrimo, who turns 31 this month, married a woman from his hometown of Lake Wales, Fla., becoming a stepfather to three girls before having a son in 2018. He sold cars for a while, and moved on recently to taking horticulture classes and farming. He\u2019s proud of what he and the Marines he served with did in Afghanistan.\n\n\u201cThey were getting shot at, and they were running and shooting back at them,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s where the pride comes in for me: to know that these guys at one time all stood for the exact same thing, and they went out and they did it, and they accomplished what they were supposed to accomplish.\u201d\n\nSince leaving the military, Clay, 36, has found happiness after divorce and remarrying, he said. He became a patrol deputy and dog handler with the Iredell County Sheriff's Department, and is quick to tell those he served alongside that he loves them.\n\n\u201cThe sacrifices that were made, it\u2019s not that they were made in vain as long as they\u2019re not forgotten,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the best way to put it. Things have to change. Times have to change.\u201d", "description": "More than 775,000 U.S. troops have served in the longest war in U.S. history.", "authors": ["Dan Lamothe", "Reporter Covering The Pentagon", "The U.S. Military", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/F8wawQ1wk3Rkj0rjBlb6dtL3j7E=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KACWEBC3YYI6TBBNPU7NP2ZZK4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
