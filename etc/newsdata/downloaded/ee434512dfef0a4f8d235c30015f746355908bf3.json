That made him painfully aware of the sheer noise a diesel engine makes when out on safari.\n\n\"We have actually surprised some animals as we move through the bush,\" he said of the new vehicles.\n\nThe newly launched Cheetah Plains is a luxury private game reserve adjacent to the Kruger National Park, with rooms that cost R90,000 per night and include your own butler, spa therapist and field tracker. A state-of-the-art game-driving experience was the next logical step \u2013 and so these custom-made prototypes were built out of of Toyota Cruiser bodies.\n\n\n\n\u201cBringing this technology to the luxury safari industry is incredible, as it allows for a far more tranquil & immersive safari experience,\u201d said Van Niekerk.\n\nJustin Glanvill\n\nThe secret to cruising around silently in the bush is Tesla batteries under the hood.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe original engine was removed and replaced with an electric motor driven by Tesla batteries. The three Cruisers we currently have are operational and working brilliantly. However, they are still \u2018prototypes\u2019,\u201d said Van Niekerk.\n\nThe vehicles also come with modified suspension to allow for a softer and smoother ride, as well as heated seats for those chilly winter mornings in the open air, plus USB charging ports to ensure guests capture every moment of their ultimate game driving experience on their smartphones without fear of running of out power.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are still testing the full range, but currently [they can go] about 50km per charge,\u201d said Van Niekerk.\n\nMeanwhile the wildlife is starting to get used to the silent vehicles, which means closer encounters.\n\n\u201cWe do not push boundaries with the animals within the reserve; we maintain a safe and responsible distance. But, we do find that they are slightly more relaxed with our presence in a sighting, especially with the antelope species,\u201d said Van Niekerk.\n\nAnd guests are loving it.\n\n\u201cBecause these vehicles are virtually sound-less, I felt like I was a part of the natural landscape, not intruding in it. We were able to drive closer to animals, like a pack of impalas, without alarming them or scurrying them off. Plus, as an eco-conscious traveller, it felt especially important to be driving a vehicle with minimal waste emissions. I really hope electric game drive vehicles are the future of South African game lodges - for the sake of the experiences and, most importantly, the Earth,\u201d said travel journalist Olivia Balsinger.\n\nBy the end of December, Van Niekerk says, the vehicles will be partially charged via solar panels.\n\nNow read: These ultra-luxury villas near the Kruger will cost R90,000 a night \u2013 but you get your own butler, spa therapist, and field tracker\n\nReceive a single WhatsApp every morning with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "Thanks to custom-made motors based on Tesla batteries, these open-top viewing vehicles are sneaking up on animals near the Kruger.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8299/646baa05aea44dd5a71bc2396dee424d.jpeg", "published_at": "2018-12-12"}
