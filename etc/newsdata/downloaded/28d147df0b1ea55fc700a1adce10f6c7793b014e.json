While European leaders have expressed ongoing concern about the Amazon\u2019s fires, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s right-wing government has empowered the business interests linked to the fires, prioritizing agriculture over the environment. And Bolsonaro has an ally in President Donald Trump, who himself missed a G7 climate change meeting earlier in the day, citing \u201cscheduled meetings.\u201d\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said Monday that G7 powers would commit $20 million to assist Brazil and its neighbors in their efforts to protect the Amazon. That group \u2014 consisting of France, Canada, the United Kingdom, Italy, Japan, Germany, and the United States \u2014 meets annually to discuss global economics and policy. Macron said that the initiative had U.S. support, but noted that Trump missed Monday morning\u2019s climate meeting.\n\nThe meeting focused on biodiversity and oceans, as well as climate issues in general. White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham told reporters that Trump had previously scheduled commitments and that \u201ca senior member of the Administration\u201d attended in his stead.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe $20 million commitment marks a victory for Macron, who has fought to make the wildfires a central issue at the summit in Biarritz, France. But it is unclear what impact the aid will have, given the scope of the problem.\n\nBrazil has seen more than 74,000 fires this year, according to the country\u2019s National Institute for Space Research, with 41,000 in the Amazon. Wildfires are a naturally occurring phenomenon that scientists say are growing more common and more devastating as global temperatures increase. But the Amazon\u2019s fires are not an act of nature gone awry. Instead, the blaze was caused by intentional efforts to clear the land for ranching and farming \u2014 efforts that have spiraled out of hand. Now, the world is facing a staggering problem.\n\nThe Amazon \u2014 referred to by some as the \u201cworld\u2019s lungs\u201d \u2014 is a crucial carbon sink and provides 20% of global oxygen. Without it, fighting climate change will be much harder \u2014 and that\u2019s to say nothing of the blow to biodiversity found nowhere else in the world along with the overall cost to humanity. Some three million species of plants and animals are found in the Amazon, where around one million indigenous people also live.\n\nMacron called the situation an \u201cinternational crisis\u201d and has taken aim at Brazil\u2019s leadership over the fires.\n\nThis political dynamic has underscored tense G7 talks. When he took office in January, Bolsonaro almost immediately made good on his campaign promises to support agricultural and mining businesses in the Amazon at the expense of the environment and indigenous communities. While the fires have sparked international concern, Bolsonaro has downplayed the situation and accused his political foes of sabotage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOn the question of burning in the Amazon, which in my opinion may have been initiated by NGOs because they lost money, what is the intention? To bring problems to Brazil,\u201d the president said earlier this month, a claim for which he later admitted he had no evidence.\n\nBut Bolsonaro has risen to power largely by positioning himself in contrast to Western leaders, a distinction he has driven home as the fires have worsened.\n\nBolsonaro recently accused Macron and the G7 of interfering in Brazil\u2019s affairs and having \u201ca misplaced colonialist mindset.\u201d This came after Macron called for G7 leaders to prioritize the issue during the current summit. \u201cOur house is burning. Literally. The Amazon rain forest \u2013 the lungs which produces 20% of our planet\u2019s oxygen \u2013 is on fire,\u201d the French leader wrote in a tweet last week.\n\nOn Sunday, however, the Brazilian leader bowed to growing international pressure and authorized the military to combat the flames.\n\nOur house is burning. Literally. The Amazon rain forest \u2013 the lungs which produces 20% of our planet\u2019s oxygen \u2013 is on fire. It is an international crisis. Members of the G7 Summit, let's discuss this emergency first order in two days! #ActForTheAmazon pic.twitter.com/dogOJj9big \u2014 Emmanuel Macron (@EmmanuelMacron) August 22, 2019\n\nOn the sidelines of the dispute, meanwhile, is the United States. Like Brazil, the United States has taken an increasing backseat on global climate leadership. Under Trump, the United States is set to exit the Paris climate agreement next year, while bolstering support for fossil fuels and slashing environmental protections.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump has also maintained friendly ties with Bolsonaro and has largely supported his Brazilian counterpart as the Amazonian fires have worsened.\n\nLast week, the U.S. president tweeted about an exchange with Bolsonaro and offered Brazil his support. \u201cI told him if the United States can help with the Amazon Rainforest fires, we stand ready to assist!\u201d Trump wrote.\n\nTrump\u2019s absence at the G7 climate meeting, however, further highlights the gap between the United States and many of its allies, as does the president\u2019s rapport with Bolsonaro. This contrast is only set to deepen as climate action becomes a bigger priority for many world leaders. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned Monday that the world is facing \u201ca dramatic climate emergency.\u201d\n\nAnd in a seeming nod to the United States, Guterres also emphasized that smaller actors, like cities and states, have \u201cthe capacity to deliver in relation to climate action.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-1163960520.jpg?w=1920&h=1080&crop=1"}
