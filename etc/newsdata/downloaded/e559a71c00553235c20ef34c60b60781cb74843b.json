A speech later by Fed hawk , whose opposition to further interest rate cuts is already on the record, is unlikely to change much.\n\nSterling tumbles to 3-year low on political turmoil\n\nThe fell below $1.2000 to its lowest in three years after opposition lawmakers started a move to force Prime Minister Boris Johnson to abandon his plans to take the U.K. out of the EU at all costs on Oct. 31.\n\nThe opposition, led by the left-wing Labour Party, will try to pass a procedural motion later on Tuesday taking control of the daily agenda from the government. If it passes, that could lead to a vote forcing the government to request another three-month extension to the Brexit deadline from the EU.\n\nJohnson said on Monday that he would see such a move as a vote of No Confidence and call an election (analysts suggest it would take place on Oct. 14, two weeks ahead of Brexit day).\n\nPMIs head light day for data\n\nA generally light day for data is set to be dominated by the , which is due at 10 AM ET (1400 GMT).\n\nLast month\u2019s index reading of 51.2 was the lowest since President Donald Trump was elected in 2016. Analysts expect it to inch down to 51.1, still just above the 50 level that separates growth from contraction.\n\nIHS Markit\u2019s for U.S. manufacturing, which already last month suggested the sector was in recession, comes out 15 minutes earlier.\n\n4. Saudi Arabia replaces al-Falih as Aramco chair\n\nSaudi Arabia relieved Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih of his duties as chairman of Saudi Aramco, replacing him with the head of the country\u2019s sovereign wealth fund. The removal of a serving minister as chairman appears aimed at facilitating the initial public offering for Aramco, which was shelved last year due to governance concerns from potential western investors.\n\nReports have suggested that the kingdom\u2019s revived IPO plan revolves around an initial domestic listing, to be followed by an international listing in Tokyo.\n\n5. Oil falls as Hurricane Dorian aims at east coast\n\nOil prices fell, consistent with the broader risk-off mood elsewhere. On Monday, Bloomberg reported that OPEC members had increased their oil production for the first time this year in August, casting a shadow of doubt over the bloc\u2019s self-imposed production restraints (official Russian data last week also showed an increase in output for August).\n\nThe U.S. benchmark blend fell 1.5% to $54.26 a barrel, while the international benchmark fell by 1.1% to $58.02.\n\nOn Friday, Baker Hughes\u2019 fell by another 12 to 742, the lowest since November 2017, pointing to increasing strains on shale producers. However, even though the rig count peaked nearly nine months ago, U.S. production still hasn\u2019t started declining.\n\nHurricane Dorian, which briefly threatened the Gulf of Mexico last week, is meanwhile set to turn north, hitting the northeast coast of Florida, along with Georgia and South Carolina, according to the National Hurricane Center.", "description": "Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Tuesday", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEC6H0BP_L.jpg"}
