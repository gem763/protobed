His record-breaking rise from a bootstrapped entrepreneur working out of his apartment in 1999 to jet-setting e-commerce mogul is one for the history books, mirroring China\u2019s own evolution from technological backwater to world\u2019s No. 2 economy.\n\nOver two decades, Ma and his co-founders built a business-to-business marketplace into a $460 billion titan that bested EBay Inc. and Amazon.com Inc., operates one of the world\u2019s largest cloud computing businesses, and runs a logistics network that delivers millions of parcels every day. Now the country\u2019s most recognizable businessman, he hands the helm on Tuesday to finance maven Daniel Zhang -- a momentous transition for Asia\u2019s largest corporation.\n\nRead more: New Alibaba Chief Explains Why He Wants to Kill His Own Business\n\nMa became Asia\u2019s richest person in 2016, overtaking Dalian Wanda Group Chairman Wang Jianlin. The title now belongs to Reliance Industries Ltd. Chairman Ambani, who\u2019s worth $47.4 billion, according to a Bloomberg ranking of the world\u2019s 500 wealthiest individuals.\n\nThe Alibaba co-founder has become the face of Chinese business even while a member of the ruling Communist Party. Ma, who recalled in a 2015 interview how KFC once rejected his job application, currently owns a 5.3% Alibaba stake worth $24.6 billion, or about 10-fold the $2.6 billion his 7.4% slice in 2012 was worth. Since taking over as executive chairman in 2013, Alibaba\u2019s revenue has surged about 1,100% to 378.8 billion yuan ($56.2 billion) in the year ended March 2019. His fortune doesn\u2019t count shares in the company held by his foundation, or the value of stock he\u2019s sold over time.\n\nMa isn\u2019t the only person to derive fabulous wealth from the Alibaba empire. The company\u2019s trajectory at one point spawned at least 10 other billionaires across its ecosystem, from a parcel delivery company and supermarket to an online payments affiliate. Despite stepping down, Ma is expected to remain pivotal to a sprawling industrial machine with e-commerce at its heart.\n\n\u201cAt this point, it\u2019s still unlikely that Zhang would make important decisions without Ma\u2019s support,\u201d said Brock Silvers, managing director at Shanghai-based Kaiyuan Capital, an investment advisory firm.\n\nRead more: Alibaba\u2019s rise creates 10 billionaires not named Jack Ma\n\n--With assistance from Pei Yi Mak.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Venus Feng in Hong Kong at vfeng7@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Pierre Paulden at ppaulden@bloomberg.net, ;Peter Elstrom at pelstrom@bloomberg.net, Peter Eichenbaum, Edwin Chan\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Jack Ma is giving up the reins of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. after presiding over one of the most spectacular creations of wealth the world has ever seen.The former English teacher steps down as executive chairman of China\u2019s largest company on his 55th birthday after amassing a $41.8 billion", "authors": ["Venus Feng"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/osppa_2HP7GVOSV84eIn2A--~B/aD03Mzg7dz0xMjk2O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/d4c9bfa4f7a0d7f3ba8d130fa5c92332", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
