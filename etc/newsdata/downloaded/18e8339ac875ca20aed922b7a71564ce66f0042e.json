She uses a wheelchair and mobility scooter, and is missing her working life.\n\nAlan, who works as a roofer, said: \u201cShe\u2019s at the stage where she can take care of herself in short bursts.\n\n\u201cBut she\u2019s depressed because she likes her work and can\u2019t do that anymore.\n\n\u201cShe isn\u2019t the same person anymore.\n\n\u201cBut when you\u2019ve been through something like that you take it day by day.\n\n\u201cAll our lives have changed dramatically. The kids are helping a lot more and I\u2019m trying to stick to working just six days a week.\"\n\nWith four children between them aged 25, 18, 16, and their nine-year-old who has autism, helping around the house, and with Alan often working seven days a week, the family has struggled through their most difficult time.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve got through the worst of it but we\u2019re trying to catch up with bills now,\u201d he added.\n\nThe money raised will go towards the bills the family has fallen behind on as well as travel costs getting Emma to and from Queens Medical Centre.\n\nFriend Laura Smart, 35, said: \u201cShe struggles getting around and she gets confused.\n\n\u201cEmma was really bubbly and outgoing. Always up for a laugh, always out with friends and family.\n\n\u201cShe was a carer for young vulnerable adults, and used to care for her husband's uncle too.\n\n\u201cBut now she can\u2019t do any of that.\n\n\u201cWe hope to raise \u00a32000 but whatever we can raise will be great.\u201d\n\nDonations to Emma\u2019s GoFundMe page can be made here .", "description": "Emma Bateman's life has changed as she now uses a wheelchair and mobility scooter, and is missing work", "authors": ["Kerry Bayliss"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20662072.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Emma-Bateman.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
