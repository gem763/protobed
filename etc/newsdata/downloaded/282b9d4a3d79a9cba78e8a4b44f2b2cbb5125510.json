Russian outlets, including business daily Kommersant, tied the exfiltration to the 2017 disappearance of a former Russian government official and his family on a vacation to Montenegro. Reporters, first from NBC, sought him out at his home in the Washington area that was purchased using his real name. Several Russian outlets as well as the Post published his name.\n\nThe disclosure of the source\u2019s escape along with the publication of his personal details has raised concerns among current and former intelligence experts about the ease of identifying sources in the digital age, and the ability of the CIA to keep its assets safe.\n\nProtecting assets has always been a CIA priority, but the march of technology and social media has made hiding former spies and their families vastly more complicated.\n\n\u201cNowadays, there are so many electronic connections; the kids are on social media,\u201d said John Sipher, a former CIA officer stationed in Moscow. \u201cYou can\u2019t hide someone\u2019s complete identity anymore.\u201d\n\nAccording to Joe Augustyn, a former CIA officer who managed the agency\u2019s resettlement program for three years, the CIA is allowed, based on the law, to extract 100 people a year \u201cbased on their contributions to U.S. security.\u201d The agency has never reached that number, but holds it in reserve for particularly valuable and noteworthy assets who are in imminent danger of exposure.\n\nIn most cases, Augustyn told Yahoo News, the CIA strongly recommends that the source and his or her family change their names and begin new lives in the United States. However, the agency, which provides resources such as legal assistance, language education, job training and other services, has to balance the source\u2019s need for protection with the desire to live a full life and maintain some level of freedom for his or her family. And once the source becomes an American citizen, the CIA has little authority over his or her life.\n\n\u201cI cannot imagine that the agency did not try to dissuade him [from] keeping his true identity,\u201d said Augustyn. \u201dBut when it comes down to it, it\u2019s his decision.\u201d\n\nWhile he was not aware of the specifics, Augustyn speculated that the spy\u2019s children and their difficulties in adjusting to a new country may have entered into the family\u2019s decision.\n\nDecisions to uproot a spy\u2019s life aren\u2019t made lightly. Former CIA officers who spoke with Yahoo News also said that the agency likely did not choose to exfiltrate the spy in 2017 based purely on the president\u2019s handling of intelligence.\n\nAccording to one former CIA officer familiar with the matter, the potential for exposing the spy was considered in January 2017, when the intelligence community decided to publicize details about the community\u2019s assessments into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.\n\n\u201cWhen they decided to make the [intelligence community assessment] public, they knew it would come with a huge risk to the source,\u201d the former officer said. \u201cAnalyzing what we would lose from collection versus threat to the source \u2026 it\u2019s a whole process to do that analysis.\u201d\n\nHowever, if Trump\u2019s handling of intelligence was a factor in the decision, that would be all the more troubling, experts told Yahoo. One foreign intelligence official said they would be most worried if Trump was the reason the source was exfiltrated: \u201cIf that\u2019s true, then it\u2019s obviously worrying for U.S. intel as well as partners.\u201d\n\nBut the official expressed doubt that Trump\u2019s behavior was the key factor behind the removal.", "description": "The exposure of a highly placed Russian asset, which has ignited renewed debate over President Trump\u2019s relationship with the intelligence agencies, has also highlighted the challenge of rescuing and resettling foreign spies in the U.S.", "authors": ["Jenna Mclaughlin", "National Security", "Investigations Reporter"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/DJFGAnWwRrEDRMFR92Izjg--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/fbc3d410-d4cd-11e9-9fdd-564a14283f73", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
