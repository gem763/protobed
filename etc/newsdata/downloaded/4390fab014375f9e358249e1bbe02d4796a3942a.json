Another Benedict student, sophomore Nia Byas, described the campus as being on \u201clockdown.\u201d\n\nThe request that students stay in their dormitories was part of a \u201csafety plan\u201d that Benedict College officials reportedly created with the assistance of the Secret Service, according to the school\u2019s spokesperson, Kymm Hunter, who added that classes had also been cancelled, but that \u201cif anyone needed to go to work or to another building, it was not a problem.\u201d\n\nThe report added that students said they were told to stay inside their dorms from 3:00 to 4:00 p.m.\n\nSome may find the dormitory request by Benedict College officials bizarre, given that President Trump\u2019s popularity among black Americans has reportedly been surging since the 2016 election, with the executive director for the National Diversity Coalition for Trump, Bruce LeVell, predicting the president will win even higher levels of support among the black community in 2020.\n\nReese, who said he is neither a supporter nor an opponent of the president, told the State that while he understood the school\u2019s desire for security, he saw no reason why officials couldn\u2019t secure a small campus such as Benedict, given that the president is always speaking at massive events in other venues.\n\n\u201cSure, I would love to go to the event,\u201d said Reese. \u201cJust to hear a sitting president, I wouldn\u2019t want to miss that.\u201d\n\nYou can follow Alana Mastrangelo on Twitter at @ARmastrangelo and on Instagram.", "description": "Students at Benedict College, one of 100 historically black colleges and universities (HCBU) were reportedly told to stay in their dormitories during President Donald Trump's visit to campus on Friday, while the president was honored with the \"Bipartisan Justice Award\" for his work on criminal justice reform.", "authors": ["Alana Mastrangelo"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/trump-at-benedict-college-700x420-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
