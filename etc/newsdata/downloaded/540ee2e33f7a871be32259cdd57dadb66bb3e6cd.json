A message posted on the union's Twitter account said it was \"just asking that the mayor stop contradicting herself and the platform she campaigned on.\"\n\nEXPERTS TO CHICAGO TEACHERS UNION: CHANGING UP PENSIONS COULD FEEL LIKE A RAISE\n\nLightfoot, a former federal prosecutor, was elected on promises to invest in poor neighborhoods, address Chicago's troubled finances and improve schools. As a candidate, she said she supported moving to an elected Board of Education rather than the mayor-appointed model that gives the city's top elected official enormous control over the school district.\n\nShe said Tuesday that the legislation that union leaders back is \"fundamentally flawed\" but didn't provide details.\n\nBoth sides have said in recent days that they made progress on the teachers' top priorities, including stricter limits on class sizes and additional staffing. Talks resumed Tuesday, hours after a 16-hour bargaining session wrapped up without a tentative agreement.\n\nHOW CHICAGO'S TEACHER STRIKE IS AFFECTING KIDS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS\n\nA representative for the teachers union suggested after the late-night session ended early Tuesday that Lightfoot could settle the dispute by committing to more resources for schools.\n\nGeneral Counsel Robert Bloch said the union representing 25,000 teachers is awaiting the city's response. He says the parties have narrowed their differences, \"but we're not there yet.\"\n\nBut Lightfoot and the district's CEO, Janice Jackson, said Tuesday that union leaders are to blame for the impasse.\n\nSTUDENTS OF STRIKING CHICAGO TEACHERS BARRED FROM TRACK MEET\n\nJackson called the union's demand for more preparation time \"a last-minute grab to take away precious instructional time.\"\n\n\"There is no justifiable reason that kids should be prevented from going back into class tomorrow because we refused to reduce the length of the school day or the length of the school year,\" she said.\n\nAdding preparation time has been among teachers' demands since negotiations toward a new contract began months ago. But as they prepared to strike and set up picket lines, union officials and teachers more often spoke about reducing the size of classes and adding staff, including librarians, social workers and nurses.\n\nUnder the 2012 deal that ended the last major teachers' strike in the city, teachers surrendered some paid preparation time.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nThey now want 30 minutes restored for elementary school teachers, who were guaranteed at least 15 minutes at the beginning of the school day under the contract that expired this summer. The union argues that teachers need that time to prepare lessons and says it's unfair to expect educators to do that work unpaid outside of school hours.\n\n\"One of the great things about collective bargaining is that it gives the parties a chance to really figure out what's working and what isn't working,\" said Robert Bruno, a professor of labor and employment at the University of Illinois Chicago. \"So, they agree to a contract, live with it for a while and then say this isn't working the way we thought it would, or here are the unintended consequences.\"\n\nIn a 2017 analysis of teachers' labor contracts, the National Council on Teacher Quality found teachers in large school districts typically get 45 minutes per day to plan.\n\nSome of the contracts also specify the amount of time teachers have to collaborate with colleagues.\n\nThe district has reached a tentative agreement with a separate union representing thousands of school support staff who went on strike alongside the teachers union. Leaders of that union have said staff won't return to work until teachers get a deal too.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/Lori-Lightfoot-Getty.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
