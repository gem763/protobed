In addition, the Marine Corps\u2026shall perform such other duties as the President may direct. However, these additional duties may not detract from or interfere with the operations for which the Marine Corps is primarily organized.\n\nTogether, the U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Navy constitute American naval power. The ability to project ground combat power by sea is what differentiates the Corps from the Army. Without this capability, there is not much reason to maintain a Marine Corps.\n\nThe Corps is currently very good at land-based crisis response missions, contributing to America\u2019s special operations community, conducting sustained land operations in support of U.S. partners, and supporting regional combatant command requirements to work with partner nations to improve mutual capabilities. However, it lacks meaningful experience in and relevant organizations and capabilities for its primary role: contributing to the prosecution of a naval campaign.\n\nThe Corps has developed an array of relevant concepts for conducting operations in contested littoral environments, but it has yet to translate its ideas into the appropriately robust training, exercise, and experimentation efforts that are needed to inform the development of material, organizational, and major procurement efforts.\n\nThe Corps\u2019 high operational tempo has taken and continues to take a damaging toll on its people and equipment, creating pressures that make retention of skilled Marines more challenging and that rapidly age basic equipment, primary platforms, and major weapons. Unfortunately, very few of its operational commitments have anything to do with ships, conducting amphibious operations, or contributing to a naval campaign.\n\nThe Corps\u2019 immersion in \u201cother duties\u201d to the neglect of its primary mission has created a dangerous shortfall in America\u2019s ability to respond effectively to China\u2019s emergence as the major power to be reckoned with in the Indo-Pacific region.\n\nThe Marine Corps Operating Concept, published in 2016, established the framework for the Corps\u2019 current thinking about the nature of anticipated operating environments and corresponding implications for Marine Corps capabilities. It also assessed the Corps\u2019 current condition relative to what it needs to be and to do and concluded that \u201c[t]he Marine Corps is currently not organized, trained, and equipped to meet the demands of a future operating environment characterized by complex terrain, technology proliferation, information warfare, the need to shield and exploit signatures, and an increasingly non-permissive maritime domain.\u201d\n\nTwo follow-on concepts\u2014Littoral Operations in a Contested Environment (LOCE) and Expeditionary Advanced Base Operations (EABO)\u2014furthered the discussion, restating key tenets of naval power as it pertains to control of essential maritime geography and thereby revalidating the importance of the Corps\u2019 role in contributing to the prosecution of a naval campaign. LOCE assumes that \u201cfuture adversaries may be capable of controlling choke points, holding key maritime terrain, or denying freedom of action and maneuver within the littorals by imposing unacceptable risk to forces at ever increasing ranges.\u201d Thus, the Corps needs forces that can:\n\n\u201cSeize and defend advanced naval bases or lodgments to facilitate subsequent joint operations\u201d;\n\n\u201cConduct complex expeditionary operations in the urban littorals\u201d; and\n\n\u201cConduct amphibious operations\u2026to assure access\u201d for naval and follow-on forces.\n\nAs explained in the LOCE paper, \u201cThe EABO concept further distributes lethality by providing land-based options for increasing the number of sensors and shooters beyond the upper limit imposed by the quantity of seagoing platforms available.\u201d It also \u201cespouses employing mobile, relatively low-cost capabilities in austere, temporary locations forward\u201d in the contested littorals.\n\nTaken together, the Corps\u2019 concepts and assigned primary role clearly indicate that the Marines would contribute to the prosecution of a naval campaign by denying the enemy the ability to use the littorals while making it possible for the U.S. Navy to do so. The challenges for the Marine Corps (and the Navy) become inserting forces into areas where the enemy does not want them to be; operating in ways that minimize the ability of the enemy to detect and interrupt operations; resupplying forces that will likely be widely separated (or distributed); reinforcing those forces; repositioning forces as operational conditions demand; understanding what the enemy is doing; and coordinating all friendly activities so as to defeat the enemy\u2019s plans. This implies the ability to:\n\nMove and operate with minimal signature,\n\nBe tactically effective in many locations at once,\n\nSustain the overall operation even as combat attrition takes a toll on force capacity, and\n\nLeverage technologies so that the human component of the force is optimally employed.\n\nAs currently structured, manned, equipped, and supported, the Marines have significant shortfalls in all of these areas.\n\nThe supporting amphibious fleet is limited to a small number of large ships, and only a portion of these would be available for an operation in one part of the world.\n\nThe Marines have few options for inserting and sustaining forces.\n\nThe organizational structure of the Corps may have relevance (platoons and companies), but until tested, the service cannot be sure of this.\n\nThe Corps does not yet possess sufficient weapons or surveillance systems that would help a naval force to gain and exercise sea control in littoral/archipelagic waters.\n\nThe Corps has minimal short-range and no medium-range air defense capabilities.\n\nThe Corps has only one small boat company, stationed in Japan and associated with the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU), and it has no real-world combat mission experience.\n\nThe Corps\u2019 ability to move combat vehicles and heavy-fires capabilities (such as artillery) is limited to what can be loaded internally or carried externally by a helicopter or carried to shore by current landing craft.\n\nNon-material elements\u2014tactics, doctrine, organizational designs, training protocols, and institutional knowledge\u2014are effectively nonexistent.\n\nThe Corps must reorient its efforts to solve these shortfalls.\n\nIn \u201cRebuilding America\u2019s Military: Thinking About the Future,\u201d we argued that revolutionary outcomes are achievable through evolutionary improvements that focus on solving actual problems against known or presumed adversaries and, further, that such problems and possible solutions are determined with aggressive and repetitive experimentation. Solutions to problems are found in many forms and include changes in organizations, equipment, and doctrine, among others. Provided below is a set of recommendations that would enable the Corps to prepare itself more effectively for the prosecution of a naval campaign in contested littorals, with a particular focus on Asia as the region of primary interest and China as the pacing threat.\n\n1. Commit to intensive and sustained experimentation.\n\nThe Corps has undertaken relevant experimentation many times since the 1990s, but this experimentation has always been limited in scope, scale, and duration. The Corps\u2019 current efforts are problematic, constrained by time and opportunities. The Marines need to determine what their most important role is and allocate their efforts accordingly. They need to commit to an Advanced Base Force\u2013like development effort to solve the LOCE problem, making a clear statement that this is their top priority. Amphibious operations are a singular specialty that only the Corps can provide and one that the U.S. will desperately need should conflict in the Asian littorals occur.\n\n2. Develop new ranges for experimentation and training.\n\nExperimentation and consequent training is most effective when it is most realistic: undertaken in settings that most closely resemble anticipated operational environments. The Corps should expand its settings beyond those available at its primary bases in the continental U.S. and the occasional deployment. The Corps should look to U.S. territories in the Pacific because they most closely reflect the archipelagic and congested littoral waters that it would encounter in the Indo-Pacific region.\n\n3. Adjust acquisition efforts to account for tools and platforms directly related to conducting distributed operations in a contested littoral/archipelagic environment.\n\nThe Marine Corps should be acquiring anti-ship and anti-air systems and the landing craft, small boats, and combat vehicles that are most useful in getting Fleet Marine Forces ashore and positioned so that they can contribute to a naval campaign. Additionally, logistics is always the linchpin for sustained operations of any sort, and the Corps must continue its efforts to field new capabilities in this area: more resilient and flexible sources of power, unmanned options for resupply, local manufacturing of critical parts and material enablers, and an ability to harvest raw materials locally rather than have finished supplies delivered from external sources.\n\n4. Redefine amphibious shipping and support capability requirements to account for combat operations in a contested littoral environment in support of a naval campaign.\n\nThe Corps must work with the Navy to develop smaller, lower-cost ships that are better suited to the type of dispersed operational posture implied by LOCE. The Corps also needs to regain its ability to conduct small-boat operations, a capability that has eroded to near-irrelevance within the service.\n\n5. Create relief in the operating forces.\n\nThe Corps must discipline its appetite for action, learn how to say \u201cno\u201d to requests for support when they begin to prevent the service from redeveloping its naval warfare capabilities, and reduce its habit of offering capabilities for use that could otherwise be used to prepare for its primary role.\n\n6. Recoup resources currently committed to secondary, collateral, and additional duties or functions.\n\nThe Corps\u2019 relentless workload, high operational tempo, and small size (relative to workload) have combined to consume the service\u2019s limited resources and prevent it from adequately preparing for its most likely and obligatory contributions to future operations. Current challenges to securing adequate funding to expand the Corps imply that the Marines must reevaluate how and where they are committing the resources they have in order to free them for use in preparing for the future. With this in mind, the Marine Corps should:\n\nStrongly consider disestablishing Marine Corps Special Operations Command (MARSOC). MARSOC, while a boon to U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM or SOCOM) and doing good work for the country, is an opportunity cost for the Corps. The Marines consistently resisted creating a special operations component until directed to do so in 2006, driven by a shortage of special operations teams needed to prosecute the global war on terrorism following the attacks of September 11, 2001. That national emergency has long been over, and the Corps should redirect its efforts to its primary role.\n\nMARSOC, while a boon to U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM or SOCOM) and doing good work for the country, is an opportunity cost for the Corps.

That national emergency has long been over, and the Corps should redirect its efforts to its primary role. Review its level of investment in Marine Forces Cyberspace Command (MARFORCYBER). Cyber capabilities are essential to current military operations and will be even more so in the future, but this does not necessarily mean that the Corps must have this capability organic to the service. It could seek such support from the Navy or any other military service or Defense organization. The manpower commitment to MARFORCYBER might be better reallocated to the Corps\u2019 unique role if the function/support can be obtained elsewhere.\n\nCyber capabilities are essential to current military operations and will be even more so in the future, but this does not necessarily mean that the Corps must have this capability organic to the service.

The manpower commitment to MARFORCYBER might be better reallocated to the Corps\u2019 unique role if the function/support can be obtained elsewhere. Reconsider its Special Purpose Marine Air-Ground Task Force (SPMAGTF) commitment. As with its other non-amphibious/non-naval warfare commitments, the Corps should reassess the value it gains and provides from permanent SPMAGTF commitments when compared with the challenge it faces in readying for future war in the contested littorals.\n\nAs with its other non-amphibious/non-naval warfare commitments, the Corps should reassess the value it gains and provides from permanent SPMAGTF commitments when compared with the challenge it faces in readying for future war in the contested littorals. Reevaluate its investment in specific types of climate-specific warfighting. Changing geostrategic conditions often call for changes in force preparation and focus. The Corps has a history of fighting in cold weather and mountainous terrain, and war plans during the Cold War anticipated the Marines fighting in Norway or on the Korean Peninsula. Given the relatively small size of the U.S. military and the multitude of challenges the Joint Force must consider in its efforts to prepare for the future, the Corps should carefully assess whether its investment in cold-weather training in places like Norway is more opportunity cost than warfighting benefit when compared with the imperative to prepare for naval warfare in the Indo-Pacific region.\n\n7. Expand integration with the Navy.\n\nThe Corps should work with the Navy to establish a formal office, with permanently assigned personnel, that is highly visible to the Commandant of the Marine Corps and Chief of Naval Operations and has as its specific purpose the developing of solutions to the challenges of conducting a distributed naval campaign in contested littoral waters. The Marine Corps and the Navy will have to work together to prosecute any naval campaign in the coming decades. Developing relevant equipment, platforms, tactics, organizations, and procedures must therefore be a highly focused, intentional effort for both services, working in intimate collaboration.\n\nThe reemergence of great-power competition will demand the full attention of each of the services. For its part, the Corps must be as focused and disciplined in attending to the challenges of contributing to naval campaigns in the contested littoral waters of the Indo-Pacific region as it was during the interwar period of the 1920s and 1930s when it developed the concepts, capabilities, and competencies for amphibious warfare that were crucial to victory in World War II. It must make the hard decisions that are required to ensure that it succeeds in the one area for which it is obligated and uniquely qualified and in which it can act as no other service can.\n\nIn every decision to commit its limited resources, the Corps must return to its \u201cmission statement\u201d and ask two fundamental questions:\n\nDoes this commitment contribute to the ability of the Corps to prosecute a naval campaign?\n\nDoes this commitment help or hinder development of the capability to fight and win in the contested littorals of the Indo-Pacific region?\n\nIf the answer is \u201cyes,\u201d then the Corps should move ahead as aggressively as possible. If the answer is \u201cno\u201d or is in that muddling, ambiguous middle of \u201cmaybe,\u201d then the Corps should dispense with it and redirect those resources where they will matter most.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis Special Report is one of a series from The Heritage Foundation\u2019s Center for National Defense that addresses the U.S. military\u2019s efforts to prepare for future challenges. Heritage\u2019s Rebuilding America\u2019s Military Project (RAMP) means to assess the ability of the United States military to protect the country\u2019s national security interests from threats as they and the environment and conditions within which the military will operate change over the next two decades or so.\n\nPreparing for the future is hard even in the best of circumstances: when one is free of distractions, has plenty of resources, and is blessed with talented people working diligently to ensure that the organization is accounting for evolving trends, technological breakthroughs, and expected competitions. But \u201cbest conditions\u201d rarely exist, and in trying to predict the challenges of the future, they never do. As Lawrence Freedman has observed:\n\n[The] future is not preordained. This is the main reason why prediction is so difficult. There are decisions yet to be made, even about challenges that are well understood, along with chance events that will catch us unawares and developments already in train that have been inadequately appreciated. REF\n\nThus, the actual task of preparing for the future becomes enormously difficult because circumstances are so unhelpful in the present and the details of the future are patently unknowable. Yet the services have to try because the capabilities they have now grow old and perhaps less effective, new opportunities emerge as conditions change, and opponents are always working to blunt one\u2019s strengths and exploit vulnerabilities.\n\nAt present, the military services are constantly engaged in operations that consume time, attention, and resources; are too small and inadequately funded relative to their workload; and are beset with aging equipment, delayed or truncated modernization programs, and creaky supporting infrastructure. The men and women who have volunteered to serve their country in uniform are doing extraordinary work to accomplish the mission in spite of all of this, but their leadership has a maddening preference for betting the future of their services on \u201cbig leaps\u201d in capability premised on the promise of some technological advance that has yet to be proven in real-world use.\n\nGiven what is at stake\u2014namely, the future security of the United States\u2014this is a high-risk approach to preparing the military for future battle.\n\nIn our first Special Report for RAMP, \u201cRebuilding America\u2019s Military: Thinking About the Future,\u201d we made the case that there is a better way, that \u201crevolutionary outcomes [are achievable] at less risk through evolutionary improvements that build on each other until transformative tipping points are reached.\u201dREF We highlighted the work of military historians who have documented that:\n\n[P]reparation for the future works best when specific problems are identified and the services focus their efforts on solving them, employing an iterative approach over many years so that pieces of the problem are solved bit by bit and robust experimentation and force exercises discover what can (and cannot) be done, usually leading to revelations that could not have been known beforehand. REF\n\nThis approach has been adopted in the past, producing extraordinary results in the two decades between the great World Wars and at times during the Cold War when a service would focus on solving current problems\u2014for example, how to defeat Soviet forces poised to invade Western Europe (i.e., threat-based planning)\u2014rather than engage in speculative thinking about what might be possible, as was often the case during the 1990s when capabilities-based planning dominated thinking in the Department of Defense.\n\nThis report focuses on the U.S. Marine Corps, its current status, and its efforts to prepare itself for future challenges. It is not our intent to predict specific outcomes, the pace at which adjustments to the force might occur, or how competitors might change their focus and approaches to conflict. Rather, the objective of this paper is to take cues from history, geography, fielded technologies, and what the actual use of force in real-world conditions implies for Marine Corps capabilities in future war\u2014in this case, the realm of naval warfare particularly as manifested in the littorals, the imperative to distribute military power and risk as broadly as possible, and the profoundly important role of the Corps in contributing to the prosecution of a naval campaign.\n\nI. Naval Power and the U.S. Marine Corps\n\nThe primary role of the U.S. Marine Corps is established by U.S. law and Department of Defense (DOD) directive:\n\nThe Marine Corps shall be organized, trained, and equipped\u2026for service with the fleet in the seizure or defense of advanced naval bases and for the conduct of such land operations as may be essential to the prosecution of a naval campaign. In addition, the Marine Corps\u2026shall perform such other duties as the President may direct. However, these additional duties may not detract from or interfere with the operations for which the Marine Corps is primarily organized. REF\n\nIn a seminal essay published in 1954, noted political scientist Samuel Huntington described the importance of a defining purpose for a military service: \u201cThe fundamental element of a military service is its purpose or role in implementing national policy,\u201d the \u201chow, when, and where the military service expects to protect the nation against some threat to its security. If a military service does not possess such a concept, it becomes purposeless, it wallows about amid a variety of conflicting and confusing goals\u2026.\u201d Further:\n\nA military service may at times, of course, perform functions unrelated to external security [but these are] subordinate and collateral responsibilities. A military service does not exist to perform these functions; rather it performs these functions because it has already been called into existence to meet some threat to the national security. REF\n\nHuntington was specifically addressing the U.S. Navy, urging it to recognize and embrace its essential purpose: constituting naval power for the nation. But his general point that each service has a defining purpose clearly applies to the Marine Corps too, especially since it is an essential element of naval power, working in concert with the Navy to project national will across and by way of the seas.\n\nThe Corps has not entirely forgotten this foundational aspect of its purpose, but since September 11, 2001, it has been focused on the demands of current operations and has both been pulled and become distracted by a range of \u201cadditional duties,\u201d \u201ccollateral responsibilities,\u201d and the allure of new operational challenges like special operations and cyber warfare.\n\nThe terrorist attacks on 9/11 spurred the U.S. to mount a full-scale response, sending substantial forces to Afghanistan. While this did not place extraordinary demands on the Corps per se, it did have the effect of focusing the U.S. military on counterterrorism operations. Absent a competing demand for attention, given the collapse of the Soviet Union a decade earlier and Russia and China not yet on the world scene as major competitors, combat operations in Afghanistan captured the full attention of the Pentagon and the military services (though less so for the Navy). A year later, planning for the invasion of Iraq and the overthrow of the Saddam Hussein regime was in full swing, which did place a substantial burden on the Corps since it called for a large-scale conventional war against a sizeable state military.\n\nAs Afghanistan and Iraq shifted to protracted counterinsurgency and security/stability operations, both the Marine Corps and the Army became hard-pressed to sustain repeated deployment cycles. The constant use of principal major equipment items, the burden of repeated deployments, and the challenges of maintaining readiness levels while also pursuing modernization programs (needed far earlier than would otherwise be the case due to the constant operational workload) left little time, attention, or resources for thinking about and preparing for any other type of conflict.\n\nBut things change. Over the past few years, as operations in Afghanistan and Iraq have waned, freeing Marine Corps units from the incessant toll of constant deployment, emerging geostrategic challenges from Russia and China have spurred the Corps to rediscover its past and consider the role it should play in projecting combat power abroad via the seas. While the Corps has embraced the challenge intellectually, it has found that returning to the sea after so many years ashore is harder than it had perhaps anticipated. Marines who came of age during the 1990s routinely deployed with relatively small (2,200 personnel) Marine Expeditionary Units (MEUs) embarked aboard three amphibious ships that constituted an amphibious ready group (ARG). These MEU/ARG deployments served as crisis response forces useful for evacuating U.S. citizens from threatening security situations abroad, reinforcing embassy and consulate facilities when local security was deemed insufficient, establishing a U.S. military presence in locales of interest as directed, and providing assistance when humanitarian crises arose due to a natural or man-caused catastrophe.\n\nHowever, in the post-9/11 world, the Marines, like the Army, needed to focus on counterterrorism and counterinsurgency operations, and this left little room for thinking about their naval future. Complicating matters further, the Navy shrank in size, to include the number of amphibious ships it operated, leaving few opportunities for Marine Corps units to gain shipboard experience. In short, for nearly 20 years, the Corps had less opportunity to gain experience in naval matters and invested little intellectual effort in exploring its role in future naval campaigns.\n\nThe Corps recognizes this and is trying to find its way back, but its intellectual rebound has yet to be matched by significant changes in fielded capabilities. This is the Corps\u2019 primary purpose after all. It is something all Marines learn on becoming Marines, and it infuses all of its public statements, key documents, and the stories it tells itself and external audiences. Of late, however, it has not truly manifested this \u201ctruth\u201d as a programmatic, organizational, or exercised reality\u2014at least not at a level that reflects the importance of its historical, and once again needed, contribution to national naval power.\n\nThe point to executing a naval campaign is to harness naval power to promote and protect U.S. security, economic, and diplomatic interests in ways that are not possible with other forms of military power. Naval power is one of the hallmarks of a global power. A land power can extend its will into contiguous territory, but unless it possesses a navy, its influence and ability to determine its destiny stop at the water\u2019s edge. Conversely, a naval power can go wherever the seas permit (which is most of the world) and can control a land power\u2019s access to raw materials and markets that are beyond its natural reach by land. A naval power can constrain the reach, and therefore the growth, of a land power, something that is very hard for a land power to do to a naval power.\n\nNaval power creates and maintains options for a country that is able to leverage it. A landlocked country is limited to the resources it possesses within its borders or that it can trade for or seize from others contiguous to its borders. It has a very limited ability to ensure its current and future security unless it has overwhelming military power relative to its immediate neighbors.\n\nBy contrast, a naval power is less constrained by terrain or the goodwill of neighbors through which goods and materials must pass on land. The exceptions to this inherent advantage usually involve maritime chokepoints and near-seas where a competing land power can threaten seaborne transit. A naval power can reach the world if it has a fleet able to sail to distant places and ensure safe passage for materials heading to and from markets. A naval power also has options should a competing power attempt to block it from land access in its home region, as it can trade in other regions via the seas.\n\nA naval power has the advantage of \u201cexterior lines\u201d (broad expanses outside of the enemy\u2019s reach) that enable it to reposition forces in ways that create multiple options of attack for which the enemy must account. A naval power fighting a land power can prevent the flow of goods, materials, and resources that come by sea, restricting its land-power enemy to dependence on overland transport that is subject to terrain, fixed transportation networks, and interdiction by long-range fires and airpower.\n\nThe ability to use the seas and control access to them on a global scale is a strategic advantage that few countries enjoy. Operating at sea is hard. Winds, waves, currents, and the corrosive effects of saltwater and sea spray play havoc with ships. Operating at sea far from home and for extended periods is even harder. Warships need access to ports to reprovision, refuel, repair, and replenish expended stores such as ammunition and parts, although replenishment at sea can mitigate some of these requirements. Ports that can handle large, deep-draft vessels and that have all of the resources a warship might require are few and far between and must depend on the host country\u2019s willingness to approve access.\n\nThe farther a warship gets from home, the more dependent it becomes on foreign ports and the more risk it must accept if its access to such ports is threatened. Even if access is assured by an alliance or a partner state willing to provide support, there is still the matter of how close the port is to the scene of action. The farther a ship has to travel, the longer it is unavailable for use in combat. After replenishing, it must then transit back to the battlespace, burning fuel and consuming stores it would otherwise have used to conduct the operations for which it was deployed. This is the chief reason the U.S. Navy maintains currently unmatched at-sea or underway replenishment capabilities designed to keep combatants \u201cin the fight\u201d while the logistics ships make transits to and from port.\n\nTime and distance also affect the ability of the logistics fleet to keep the battleforce fleet in the fight, and the fewer logistics ships there are, or the more dispersed the battle fleet might be, the harder it is to keep naval combat power applied against the enemy. Options become important, and the ability to operate closer to the enemy, when possible, improves the ability to keep the pressure on him and to sustain fleet activities that improve one\u2019s own position while degrading and reducing his.\n\nDistance matters more to a naval power than it does to a land power. A land power at war is challenged by terrain, but its forces can scavenge necessary resources (fuel, food, water, etc.) from occupied terrain. It can also mobilize and send forward reinforcements as long as population and industrial capacity are available. Naval forces operating far from home cannot scavenge resources while at sea and are very hard to reinforce when thousands of miles away. They fight with what they bring and have few options available should supporting fires be needed from outside the fleet. Since the fleet is fixed in size for all practical purposes, any loss from combat action or mechanical failure has a profound effect on the ability of the force to remain effective in a fight.\n\nConversely, a country that is able to operate close to its own shores has an easier time maintaining presence and supporting naval actions with shore-based capabilities like long-range missiles and maritime patrol aircraft. It has the advantage of \u201cinterior lines,\u201d able to shift resources as needed quickly and efficiently with minimal interference by an enemy; it can operate within a tight sphere that it controls. But its resources are not infinite, and the more coastline and area of interest it must address, the more thinly its capabilities must be spread.\n\nThese competing realities of expeditionary and coastal navies matter a great deal in designing and employing naval forces and have a direct bearing on the role of the Marine Corps as an instrument of naval power. This is where the Corps is an essential contributor: It enables a naval force to secure access to supporting facilities close to the scene of action, to deny an enemy such capabilities, and to project combat power ashore to accomplish military objectives necessary to obtain the political win for which the war is fought. This also includes controlling key maritime terrain from which freedom of action at sea can be enabled or denied.\n\nTogether, the U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Navy constitute American naval power. To be sure, each service performs tasks unrelated to the other\u2019s. For example, the Navy\u2019s submarines collect intelligence and provide one leg of the nuclear triad, among many other things they can do from below the sea, and appropriately configured surface ships have been tasked with ballistic missile defense responsibilities and have conducted more cruise missile strikes against land targets than have confronted an enemy navy since the end of the Cold War. Quite separately, the Corps has conducted sustained ground combat operations in places far removed from the seas (for example, in Afghanistan and western Iraq) and can fly from shore bases directly to scenes of crisis without ever touching a ship or drawing on sea-based support. But throughout their history, both services have melded their capabilities to generate combat power that would otherwise have been impossible without such collaboration.\n\nFrom the founding of the country, U.S. Marines have sailed with the Navy to protect U.S. interests and exert America\u2019s will in distant lands. In various instances stretching from \u201cthe shores of Tripoli\u201d (in modern-day Libya) to Inchon, South Korea, Navy ships have delivered Marine Corps forces to foreign locales when U.S. citizens, alliance obligations, and unilateral security or economic interests were threatened. In similar manner, the Corps\u2019 expertise in amphibious warfare has made it possible to seize key terrain from which naval and air power could be projected still farther.\n\nThe Pacific campaigns of World War II are the most obvious examples of the importance of this capability, with land combat forces (the Corps through the Central Pacific and the Army along a southern path), delivered by the Navy, seizing islands and their critical ports and airfields that were leveraged as support bases for further operations against the Japanese. More recently, in November 2001, Naval Expeditionary Task Force-58, under the command of then-Brigadier General James N. Mattis and comprised of amphibious ships carrying the 15th and 26th Marine Expeditionary Units, launched the most distant amphibious assault in Marine Corps history, delivering a combat force 441 miles to secure Forward Operating Base Rhino, a desert airstrip in Afghanistan to be used to conduct operations against the Taliban.REF\n\nConducting such operations is not a simple matter. Arguably, amphibious operations are the most difficult of military operations, especially when the likelihood is high that they will be opposed by an enemy whether at the beach, on the way to the beach, or after the landing force has made its way inland. Even under the best of circumstances, it is a complex choreography of Marines and sailors attempting to get themselves, their equipment, and supplies from a ship, through the sea, and onto a beach to push relevant combat power ashore and into a hostile land. It takes an enormous effort to become competent in this specialty, and few forces in history have ever managed it well. Historically, it has defined the Corps and its contribution of an unmatched capability to the U.S. arsenal, something about which Marine Corps General Alexander A. Vandegrift reminded Congress at a pivotal point in the Corps\u2019 history, just after World War II.REF\n\nThis is not to say that the Corps should not do things other than amphibious operations or has been wrong to engage in sustained land operations ashore, whether in Korea and Vietnam or, since September 2001, in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria. In war, operational commanders do what needs to be done to accomplish objectives, often using forces designed primarily for one purpose to do something else that is of higher priority. The services reorient to the demands of war accordingly.REF More forces were needed for operations in Afghanistan and, later, in Iraq than the U.S. Army or U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM or SOCOM) could field on their own; thus, the U.S. Marine Corps contributed essential combat power alongside its fellow ground combat forces. It was wholly appropriate to do so since the whole purpose of the Corps is to fight battles on land with its unique role being to provide this ability by getting to the fight by sea, not simply to ride around on ships as an end in itself.\n\nThe ability to project ground combat power by sea is what differentiates the Corps from the Army. Without this capability, the U.S., like nearly all other countries, would be limited to moving forces overland (by road or rail) or delivering them to a deep-water port or flying into an airfield and then traversing overland to get to the fight. Without this capability, there is not much reason to maintain a Marine Corps. With this in mind, the Department of Defense has explicitly directed the Marine Corps to develop the tools necessary to fulfill its role within the Joint Force:\n\n(1) Seize and defend advanced naval bases or lodgments to facilitate subsequent joint operations.\n\n(2) Provide close air support for ground forces.\n\n(3) Conduct land and air operations essential to the prosecution of a naval campaign or as directed.\n\n(4) Conduct complex expeditionary operations in the urban littorals and other challenging environments.\n\n(5) Conduct amphibious operations, including engagement, crisis response, and power projection operations to assure access. The Marine Corps has primary responsibility for the development of amphibious doctrine, tactics, techniques, and equipment.\n\n(6) Conduct security and stability operations and assist with the initial establishment of a military government pending transfer of this responsibility to other authority.\n\n(7) Provide security detachments and units for service on armed vessels of the Navy, provide protection of naval property at naval stations and bases, provide security at designated U.S. embassies and consulates, and perform other such duties as the President or the Secretary of Defense may direct. These additional duties may not detract from or interfere with the operations for which the Marine Corps is primarily organized. REF\n\nAs noted, however, it is hard to do several different missions equally well. Time spent gaining competence in one must necessarily be taken from efforts to get and maintain competence in others. If the Corps is forced to shift its focus and efforts from one thing to another as dictated by circumstances and the needs of the nation, it risks being consumed by current demands for duties that are \u201cother\u201d or \u201cadditional\u201d to its primary function and thus losing touch with the purpose for which the Corps exists: contributing amphibious combat power to the prosecution of a naval campaign.\n\nThis is where the Corps currently finds itself: very good at land-based crisis response, making important contributions to America\u2019s special operations community, conducting sustained land operations in support of U.S. partners in various theaters, and supporting regional combatant command requirements to work with partner nations to improve mutual capabilities but lacking meaningful experience within the current force at doing the one thing that it is supposed to do and no other force can do: amphibious operations.\n\nMarine Corps officials have repeatedly expressed their concern about the need to regain skills in amphibious operations, but the Corps has yet to translate its concerns into appropriately robust training, exercise, and experimentation efforts that would inform the development of material, organizational, and major procurement efforts and expose a larger part of the Corps to shipboard operations at sea. This is unfortunate, as the Corps is the only service able to support the Navy\u2019s efforts to rediscover what it means to prosecute a naval campaign against an enemy in and through lethally contested waters.\n\nCaptain Wayne P. Hughes, Jr., USN (Ret.), has long documented the importance of naval power and has intently studied the criticality of various factors that are fundamental to victory at sea, to include the characteristics of ships, the size and design of fleets, the purpose for which fleets are deployed, naval tactics, and how changes in technology affect all of this as they pertain to naval campaigns undertaken for the larger purpose of influencing events ashore. In his landmark treatise Fleet Tactics,REF Hughes methodically makes the case for naval forces, of which the Corps is an essential part, to focus on the specialized platforms and tactics necessary to win in naval warfare.\n\nSpecifically, Hughes goes to great lengths to illustrate how scouting (reconnaissance); concealment (signature reduction); magazine or munitions capacity distributed across the force; fleet size (the numbers of platforms or units); and dispersion of the force itself are not only essential to combat effectiveness, but increasingly so as a consequence of the impact modern technologies are having on the precision and range of weapons and increased battlespace awareness for the forces employed. The Corps has a key role to play in all of these areas, and if properly focused on this role, it makes possible the effective application of U.S. naval power to secure strategic security interests.\n\nIn an era of renewed competition among great powers (the U.S., Russia, and China) and moderate powers that possess important advantages due to geography and relative military power (Iran and North Korea), the ability to project and sustain naval power is a crucial capability, but the dominance the U.S. once enjoyed has eroded since the end of the Cold War. From a fleet of nearly 600 ships in 1987, including 59 amphibious ships, the Navy has shrunk to a battle force of 286 combatants, of which only 32 are amphibious.REF Similarly, the Marine Corps has lost capacity, practical experience, and even institutional understanding relevant to the conduct of amphibious operations. It must regain its expertise in this function if the U.S. is to prevail as a global power.\n\nBefore addressing the specific implications of naval maneuver warfare and the corresponding contributions the Corps can make in the prosecution of a naval campaign, we should review the Corps itself: how it organizes for battle and how this helps or hinders its efforts to prepare for the future.\n\nII. The Corps: An Overview of the Service\n\nThe active duty Marine Corps is composed of 185,000 Marines distributed across three divisions of 24 battalions; three air wings of fixed-wing, rotary-wing, and tiltrotor aircraft; an operational/combat logistics element that makes it possible to conduct operations abroad; and a large supporting establishment that includes service headquarters, recruiting, initial training and various technical schools, and all of the supporting infrastructure (bases, air stations, and maintenance and supply depots) without which one could not have a Marine Corps in the first place. The Marines have also established a special operations component (the Corps\u2019 contribution to U.S. Special Operations Command) and a cyber command that both links the Corps with the higher-order capabilities of U.S. Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM) and provides operational and tactical-level capabilities to field commands.\n\nThe Corps\u2019 structure is consistent with that of other land and air forces. Its ground combat component is arranged in divisions, regiments, battalions, and companies, and its aviation community is composed of wings, groups, and squadrons, all of which are familiar to any military professional. But it has long adhered to an organizing principle\u2014the Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF)\u2014that is unique to the Corps and mystifying to just about everyone outside of the service, at times even causing frustration with other military organizations and certainly for non-Marine senior military leaders in operational commands.\n\nThe Corps is dogmatic in organizing and deploying its units as MAGTFs.REF The MAGTF concept rests on the idea that any operational unit will have ground combat, air combat/support, and logistics capabilities organic to it, represented in individual units or detachments but all reporting to a single common commander.\n\nA significant selling point for MAGTFs is that all personnel are in the same service and thus share a common culture and history and are rooted in the same doctrine. This enables a MAGTF to provide a full range of capabilities\u2014from those normally associated with combat operations to logistical support functions like power generation, water purification, food services, engineering capabilities, and medical support\u2014with minimal internal friction that would otherwise arise from dissimilar service backgrounds, The MAGTF also reflects the Corps\u2019 culture and operational experience, which prizes the ability to operate independently in remote, austere combat environments with minimal reliance on external support, especially at the outset of an operation.\n\nThis organizing principle has enabled the Corps to execute operations quickly, especially when delivered by amphibious shipping, without the delay or frictions that accompany the formation and employment of a joint task force (JTF) with capabilities contributed by the various services. Unlike a JTF\u2014which must be defined, its components identified, notified and mobilized, and brought together under a common command element and then deployed and employed, all while the elements are getting to know one another\u2014a MAGTF arrives ready for action with all of the assets it typically needs and can provide a theater commander with an operational capability within hours of notification. It has proven quite successful in numerous cases, from deploying ashore in Lebanon during the 1980sREF to its deep insertion into Afghanistan in late 2001,REF from providing security support to U.N. humanitarian operations in Somalia in December 1992REF to conducting disaster relief operations as exemplified most recently when the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit anchored U.S. relief operations on Tinian in the wake of Typhoon Yutu.REF\n\nEven small packages of Marine Corps units are organized around the MAGTF construct. When a deployment calls for something less than a battalion or heavily favors a particular aspect of capability, the Corps will deploy a Special Purpose MAGTF (SPMAGTF).REF Examples of this can currently be seen in Special Purpose MAGTF\u2013Crisis Response\u2013Central Command (SPMAGTF-CR-CC)REF and Special Purpose MAGTF\u2013Crisis Response\u2013Africa (SPMAGTF-CR-AF),REF the SPMAGTFs permanently organized for crisis response missions in the U.S. Central Command and Africa Command areas of responsibility, respectively. With the nearly complete fielding of the MV-22 Osprey, a small MAGTF can self-deploy a thousand miles or more on very short notice. If accompanied by KC-130 cargo/refueler aircraft, the unit can deploy with more equipment and supplies at even greater ranges. Regardless of its size, however, or the weighting of the force among its ground, air, and logistics components, it is always referred to as a MAGTF.\n\nTo be clear, the MAGTF construct has proven effective, cohesive, and reliable in innumerable instances, both before its formal adoption in 1962REF and since then. Its single service culture and familiarity among the constituent parts, gained through habitual affiliation and carefully programmed training iterations, makes planning and executing tactical actions more efficient than would otherwise be the case with an ad hoc task force.\n\nAs good as the MAGTF has proven to be, however, the Corps still needs to broaden its thinking about organizational design so that it is at least willing to explore ideas that do not fit neatly into the MAGTF model or perhaps even the long-established internal structures of companies, battalions, and regiments. For example, future battlefields, especially if part of a naval campaign that includes the littorals or archipelagic waters of much of the Indo-Pacific region, may be dealt with more effectively by combat formations that are \u201cflatter\u201d and possess many more employment elements capable of pseudo-independent operations, reporting to a single higher headquarters.\n\nThe Corps\u2019 insistence on maintaining an organic capability set in every functional area for every deployment can create obstacles to thinking about different organizational constructs that might be better suited to different tactical settings. At times, an operational commander may want just a piece of what a MAGTF would normally bring, perhaps just a platoon or company of infantry Marines or a detachment of helicopters. The Corps typically pushes back against such requests, citing its longstanding practice of providing a \u201ccomplete package.\u201d\n\nIt could also be that a specific mission or a particular approach to arraying military power lends itself to discrete elements drawn from one or more services depending on which can provide the best option for the task. Historically, when a force is \u201ctask organized\u201d for a particular mission, it is constructed to possess the things that must be organic to get the job done, while various supporting functions are provided by other forces as needed. These \u201ctask forces\u201d are understood throughout the U.S. military, are highly flexible by definition, and are structured to accomplish a specific task with specific tools or capabilities.\n\nIf the Corps is to determine what it needs to succeed in warfare in the littorals, especially as a key contributor to the prosecution of a naval campaign\u2014its primary function\u2014then it must approach concept development and experimentation with an open mind, unconstrained by its dogmatic adherence to the MAGTF organizing and employment principle or established forms of basic combat units. It could very well be that Marine Corps forces employed as Fleet Marine ForcesREF (i.e., integral components of an operational naval force) contributing to a naval campaign are organized and employed as air\u2013ground task forces after all, but the Corps should not presume this before experimentation proves the efficacy of the approach.\n\nOrganizational issues aside, the Corps maintains a steady operational tempo that it says is unsustainable, although it has maintained it for 15 years or more.REF The service prefers a deployment-to-dwell ratio of 1:3 for its units and individual Marines,REF which means that for every period of time operationally deployed, three are spent back home. However, for several years, the Corps has dealt with a ratio of 1:2,REF with its units constantly engaged in being deployed, recovering from deployment, or getting ready to deploy. This leaves almost no time for anything else like training on skills other than those most likely to be needed during the next deployment, engaging in larger experimentation efforts, or relearning what it takes to operate at sea and conduct amphibious missions.\n\nThis constant operational footing takes a toll on people and equipment, creating pressures that make retention of skilled Marines more challenging and that rapidly age basic equipment, primary platforms such as planes and vehicles, and major weapons. Both of these situations generate large costs: in manpower, the cost to recruit, train, and retain people, and in mat\u00e9riel, greater costs in maintenance, operating expenses, and premature replacement of worn-out gear.\n\nThe Corps\u2019 challenges are not unique; rather, they reflect the challenges with which all of the services are struggling. Where they are unique to the Corps is in the impact they have on the Corps\u2019 ability to focus on its primary mission. As noted, the Corps is very busy trying to fulfill an insatiable demand for its forces. SPMAGTFs for Europe, Africa, and the Middle East; rotational training/presence forces regularly cycled to the Black Sea region and Australia; cold-weather training in Norway; Marine Expeditionary Unit deployments to the Mediterranean, Indian Ocean, and the Western Pacific; ongoing operations in Syria; special operations in Africa, the Middle East, and the Indo-Pacific region; bilateral training events with partners in the Americas\u2014the list is long.\n\nBut very few of these have anything to do with ships or conducting amphibious operations, especially with a focus on warfighting, which calls to mind Huntington\u2019s caution about subordinate and collateral duties crowding out a service\u2019s primary function or role. The Corps does all of these missions very well, but in practical terms, they are tasks that are also performed by elements of the Army and special operations community. Where the Corps is not spending much time is in amphibious operations, the one area for which it is obligated and uniquely qualified and in which it can act as no other service can.REF\n\nThe Corps\u2019 immersion in \u201cother\u201d tasks to the neglect of its primary mission has created a dangerous shortfall in America\u2019s ability to respond effectively to China\u2019s emergence as the power to be reckoned with, both in the Indo-Pacific region now and possibly on a global stage in the near future. Lacking a credible ability to contest swathes of strategic maritime geography that are critical to China\u2019s rise, the U.S. will find itself ceding influence within and, in practical terms, the ability to shape a region that has every potential to be the center of economic activity for the next century and thus essential to the long-term viability of the United States.\n\nThe Corps has adapted to changes in its environment in numerous instances over its 243-year history. It is on the cusp of another dramatic change, and its attention, focus, and investments over the next several years will mean the difference between success and irrelevance. Given the stakes in play, it is useful to review how the world around the Corps is changing and how these changes should be affecting its thinking about its own efforts to adapt.\n\nIII. Environments and Threats: The Changing Strategic and Operational Context\n\nIn January 2018, Secretary of Defense James Mattis released the 2018 National Defense Strategy (NDS), setting the tone, focus, and foundation for the Department of Defense in general and the military services in particular.REF The most important sentence of the document is this: \u201cThe reemergence of long-term strategic competition, rapid dispersion of technologies, and new concepts of warfare and competition that span the entire spectrum of conflict require a Joint Force structured to match the reality.\u201dREF In addition:\n\nLong-term strategic competitions with China and Russia are the principal priorities for the Department, and require both increased and sustained investment, because of the magnitude of the threats they pose to U.S. security and prosperity today, and the potential for those threats to increase in the future\u2026.\n\nModernization is not defined solely by hardware; it requires change in the ways we organize and employ forces. We must anticipate the implications of new technologies on the battlefield, rigorously define the military problems anticipated in future conflict, and foster a culture of experimentation and calculated risk-taking. REF\n\nThe NDS reflects both the cyclical nature of geopolitical affairs\u2014the \u201creemergence of long-term strategic competition\u201d\u2014and the imperative to put serious, thoughtful effort into understanding how the world of military affairs changes and to invest commensurate resources, notably in experimentation, to find solutions to real rather than imagined problems.\n\nThis reminder that the world changes and that the military must be able to adapt as necessary is itself a cyclical issue. The U.S. military, and especially the Marine Corps, has regularly had to assess changes in geopolitical affairs, technologies, and U.S. interests for their implications for military affairs, and conditions can change dramatically between and even during wars. The forces that best figure out what it all means win, and those that fail to do so suffer defeat.\n\nIn December 2011, the last U.S. military units completed the withdrawal of the United States from Iraq, ending eight and a half years of combat operations.REF During the period, Marine Corps units, alongside the Army, engaged in intense ground combat as occurred in Fallujah and Ramadi, but most combat actions were skirmishes with insurgents and counterattacks in response to ambushes incident to security patrols. In fact, skirmishing characterized the majority of military actions over the past two decades. The last major, conventional combat action involving combined arms maneuver against a heavily armed state military was the invasion of Iraq in 2003.\n\nBoth types of military action\u2014conventional war and irregular conflict\u2014are challenging, risky, and lethal, but they differ significantly in the types of activities a force must undertake, and neither can be approached half-heartedly. As the U.S. military painfully learned between 2003 and 2006, counterinsurgency is every bit as complex and lethal as \u201cbig war\u201d (for those directly involved) and demands a service\u2019s full attention. Such shifts between forms of war are highly disruptive and generate a great deal of debate within and around the affected services.REF\n\nBig conventional wars do not occur often even if they do occur regularly. In \u201cbig war,\u201d the stakes are high, the weapons employed are extraordinarily destructive, and the complexity of orchestrating the large forces involved places great demands on the people involved. It is a form of war at which the U.S. excels, and its scale and intensity define the generation that wages it. The experience is so profound that it shapes one\u2019s perspective with regard to what war is. The U.S. military acquires such experience in large-scale combat (and what it takes to execute it) about once every generation, but in the intervening years, such knowledge is lost in practical terms and has to be regained. Those with personal experience leave the military and are replaced by those whose only knowledge may come from the classroom and limited field exercise. Even for those who do spend a lengthy career in service after such a war, their personal understanding is framed by their status at the time of action: A Marine may be promoted three or four times in the 15 or 20 years between major conflicts, so when the next war occurs (if the Marine is still on active duty), his or her practical reference point is an experience that likely occurred two decades earlier.\n\nOf course, the way to mitigate this problem is to study and exercise the skills needed for \u201cbig war\u201d as a matter of routine, but the U.S. military has a hard time doing this because of the different demands placed on its time and an unfortunate tendency to get distracted by preferred matters and lose its proper focus on necessary matters like the continued study of war, intensive experimentation, and realistic training for tasks other than those of immediate concern on the immediate battlefield. In our current times, the vast majority of Marines are consumed by operations against irregular forces for nearly the entirety of an average military career.\n\nNot surprisingly, the same condition accompanies experience in irregular warfare, especially given its duration due to its nature. It extends far longer than a conventional war and is frustrating because of its difficulty to resolve, and the percentage of a force exposed to it over time is arguably higher because of the rotational nature of force employment, thus making the experience of the force as a whole more protracted. As is the case with \u201cbig war\u201d for those who wage it, irregular wars define the view of those who are veterans of them. In either case, it makes shifting from one type of conflict to another quite difficult.\n\nSpecific to the Marines, the last time major amphibious operations were planned occurred nearly 30 years ago in 1991 when the U.S. previously engaged Iraqi forces in battle. At that time, the Corps was tasked to plan for a major amphibious assault into Kuwait, which was occupied by Iraq. Executed as a demonstration operation\u2014that is, going through all of the motions one would normally expect for such an assault without actually landing in order to deceive the Iraq military into reacting to it, which it did, thereby tying up 10 Iraqi divisionsREF that otherwise would have been available to respond to the main effort\u2014the U.S. Army\u2019s flanking movement launched out of Saudi Arabia. The action involved 18,000 MarinesREF spread across 36 amphibious shipsREF and an extraordinary amount of planning and coordination involving all of the services and various senior operational commands. There are few Marines still on active duty who can cite that as a personal experience.\n\nBefore Operation Desert Storm, the reference for sustained operations ashore was Vietnam, but it ended nearly 20 years before the Gulf War, 30 years before Operation Iraqi Freedom, and almost a half-century ago for those who are busy in current operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and elsewhere.\n\nIn the years between wars, and even during their run, conditions change dramatically. New technologies are developed that change what military forces are able to do; major states rise and fall; crises occur in different parts of the world and carry with them implications for force posture, terrain, and participants. U.S. security interests shift accordingly. Thus, what is learned in one major war may or may not be relevant to the next and may have little applicability in the multitude of minor crises that keep the military busy in between wars, and vice versa.\n\nThe size of the military changes as well, with profound implications for today\u2019s Corps. Vietnam and even the Gulf War took place when the U.S. military was sized for global operations against the Soviet Union. The U.S. had to be in many places and in sufficient numbers to counter Soviet activities, deter the Soviets from acting opportunistically, and strengthen and reassure allies. The U.S. Army was nearly 800,000 soldiers strong in its Active component, large enough to maintain 200,000 soldiers in Europe in addition to forces maintained in South Korea and Japan in the 1960s, \u201970s, and \u201980s.REF Although the Marines were part of all major war plans, the Army carried the primary burden in multiple theaters for land combat, thus freeing the Corps to handle mobile naval forward-presence and crisis response missions with the U.S. Navy. The Army held terrain and deterred the Soviets while the Corps responded to emergent crises.\n\nFollowing the Cold War, even though U.S. forces were reduced in size, they were sufficient in size to deal with numerous crises because there were no major competitors capable of seriously challenging U.S. interests. The Soviet Union was gone, China had not yet emerged as a significant power, and North Korea had not yet acquired nuclear weapons. As was much reported at the time, the U.S. stood alone as the \u201chyper-power,\u201d a rare occurrence in world history.\n\nTo repeat, during the Cold War and the 20 years or so that followed, the Army was large enough to credibly deter major competitors in at least two theaters, making it possible for the Corps to support other national security interests in concert with the Navy.REF As noted, however, following the end of the Cold War, the U.S. military underwent a substantial reduction in size. The U.S. Army presence in Europe was reduced from nearly 200,000 to just 26,500.REF The Soviet Union collapsed, and with it the Warsaw Pact coalition, but so too did the size and quality of NATO militaries as member states shifted their investment in forces necessary to defeat a Soviet invasion to domestic social programs.\n\nUnfortunately, the reemergence of Russia as a serious military presence in European affairs in the past few years has not been met by a corresponding increase in NATO forces and capabilities. The result is a weak posture that is worsened by the minimal presence of U.S. forces. Meanwhile, the Marines not only shrank along with the other services, but took on additional missions even while the bulk of the force continued to focus almost exclusively on irregular warfare.\n\nTurning back to the NDS, world affairs have come back around to competition among major state powers at a time when the U.S. military is much reduced in size; its presence abroad in key regions is similarly reduced (and that of allied forces even more so after years of neglect); and U.S. operational experience is framed by military action against irregular forces that lack any of the capabilities possessed and being modernized by China and Russia.\n\nIt has taken almost the entirety of the U.S. military, including National Guard and Reserve elements, to sustain unit rotations for large-scale operations against insurgents and terrorists in Iraq and Afghanistan. A war with Russia in Europe would likely consume everything the present Army has, including forces committed elsewhere as in South Korea. In a world of greatly increased tensions involving both Russia and China, U.S. leadership would have to decide where to commit the Army and probably much of the Air Force. The geography and terrain of Europe would be handled best by Army forces, and this is where the Army should focus its war preparation efforts.\n\nIn like manner, a war with China would involve competition across vast stretches of ocean and archipelagos in the Indo-Pacific, and this should attract the full attention of the Navy and Marine Corps, which are best suited to operating in this environment. While the defense community has discussed the potential for Army contributions in this theater\u2014theater missile defense, short-range missile and rocket fires, and perhaps developing a modern version of coastal defense capabilities\u2014it would necessarily detract from the force capacity desperately needed to counter Russia in Europe.\n\nThe Pacific region, especially all of its many islands, is an area within which the Corps (and even the Navy) has had limited numbers and experience for a considerable period of time, notwithstanding the contributions made by naval forces in numerous disaster relief operations and the III Marine Expeditionary Force\u2019s work with Japan, South Korea, and other allies and partners in the region. The Corps still deploys MEUs with Navy ARGs, but in relation to the size of the Corps and the experiences accrued by most Marines over the past two decades, amphibious operations, exercises, training, and even education are in short supply. Very little of the present Corps has direct experience with shipboard deployments and meaningful time at sea. The state of the Navy\u2019s amphibious fleet is a major contributor to this shortfall.\n\nIn 1990, the U.S. Navy had 59 amphibious ships,REF making it possible for the Marines both to operationally deploy and to conduct unit training and force exercises. Today, the Navy has 32 amphibious ships,REF of which approximately half are available for use (globally) at any one time, and then only for preparation for deployment and actual deployments. This shortage of ships was cited by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) as \u201cthe most prevalent factor\u2026that hampered training completion\u201d for Marine Corps forces attempting to regain amphibious warfare skillsREF and was a major factor in the Corps\u2019 decision to field crisis response forces that were not dependent on the availability of amphibious ships.REF\n\nThis also has a bearing on connecting the Corps institutionally and culturally to operations at sea, on Marines gaining a feel for and experienced-based understanding of amphibious operations. It is one thing to study amphibious operations in school and quite another to earn the experience of embarking aboard ship, becoming part of the routine of a ship underway. Commanders and planners need to practice the skills needed to move a force from ship to shore and to understand how the Corps contributes to the exercise of naval power in a campaign against a major enemy: using the sea and maritime geography to deny the enemy freedom of movement, the ability to sustain his operations, and the ability to project power at range while providing these advantages to the U.S.REF\n\nTo provide some historical context, it is perhaps useful to note that between Desert Storm and Iraqi Freedom, the Marine Corps fully focused on MEU deployments and the routine rotation of units between the U.S. and Okinawa, Japan, committing 18 of its 27 battalions (and associated aviation and logistics units) to this effort roughly every 18-month period or six battalions in an active, planned deployment on any given day.REF\n\nThe Corps can do many things and has performed all of its assigned tasks quite well. But, recalling Huntington, it should not allow its \u201cother\u201d tasks to distract from its primary function as \u201cfleet marine forces\u201d tasked \u201cfor service with the fleet in the seizure or defense of advanced naval bases and for the conduct of such land operations as may be essential to the prosecution of a naval campaign.\u201dREF To the extent that it does allow itself to be so distracted, it contributes capacity to roles being performed by other forces, like the Army and special operations community, but loses its ability to perform a role that only it and no other force can perform.\n\nWhich brings us to today\u2019s Marine Corps and its efforts to transition from one era to another. Historically speaking, this is not an unusual challenge for the Corps.\n\nA Brief History: The Corps\u2019 Adaptation to Changing Conditions\n\nIn his sweeping history of the U.S. Marine Corps, Allan R. Millett characterized four major phases of primary activity and focus for the Corps:REF\n\nPhase I: Continental, stretching from the opening of the American Revolution through the early 20th century. During this phase, Marines served primarily as ship guards and secondarily as infantry useful for boarding ships, repelling boardings, and carrying on land actions as deemed necessary by the ship\u2019s captain.\n\nstretching from the opening of the American Revolution through the early 20th century. During this phase, Marines served primarily as ship guards and secondarily as infantry useful for boarding ships, repelling boardings, and carrying on land actions as deemed necessary by the ship\u2019s captain. Phase II: Colonial, beginning with the Philippine\u2013American war in 1899 through Shanghai in 1941. U.S. Marines served as naval forces engaged in prolonged overseas interventions ashore.\n\nbeginning with the Philippine\u2013American war in 1899 through Shanghai in 1941. U.S. Marines served as naval forces engaged in prolonged overseas interventions ashore. Phase II: Amphibious Assault, from after the Spanish\u2013American War of 1898 until the present (as of 1991 when the history was published). During this period, the Corps\u2019 signature role was to seize and defend advanced bases to contribute to a naval campaign, a purpose formalized by creation of the Fleet Marine Force.\n\nfrom after the Spanish\u2013American War of 1898 until the present (as of 1991 when the history was published). During this period, the Corps\u2019 signature role was to seize and defend advanced bases to contribute to a naval campaign, a purpose formalized by creation of the Fleet Marine Force. Phase IV: Force-in-Readiness, subsequent to World War Two and running until the present. This is the daily work undertaken by the Corps in periods between major wars, \u201cparticularly outside the European continent.\u201d\n\nA variety of factors drove the Corps to be what it was and to do what it did during each of these periods. On some occasions, it was a specific need that was not being met or could not be met with Army or Navy forces as they were constituted at that time. At other times, it was an external threat that had to be addressed, accompanied by the opportunity for the Corps to further its service interests. More often, it was simple competition with the Navy and Army, which often attempted to have the Corps disbanded or relegated to duties that posed less of a threat to their own funding and influence. Chance also played a role in bringing attention to the Corps, and with it came important public support that translated into funding and influence (much to the frustration of the Navy and Army).REF But on each occasion, the Corps assessed its situation and, through hard work, imagination, determination, and no small amount of swagger, did what it needed to do to succeed in spite of the challenges before it.\n\nLast updated in 1991, Millett\u2019s history does not account for the many events that have occurred since then, including the breakup of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War; the United States\u2019 unipolar moment during the 1990s (and a bit beyond); or the attacks of September 11, 2001, and the subsequent global war on terrorism. It also predated the overthrow of Saddam Hussein and the subsequent sustained operations in both Afghanistan and Iraq. Nor does it account for the rise of competing powers addressed in the 2018 NDS\u2014Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea\u2014or the dramatic expansion of Special Operations Command and the related consistent use of special operations forces globally and how all of this has affected the Marines, as well as the reduction in size of the U.S. military following the end of the Cold War and the toll that post\u2013September 11 operations have taken on the equipment and personnel of the military.\n\nYet Millett\u2019s history of the Corps\u2019 ups and downs could easily extend to describe the current phase of Marine Corps activities: a mixture of small wars and force-in-readiness posture as the Corps tries to determine the implications of the return of great-power competition and how the service might contribute to naval power in a highly contested operating space.\n\nAs it did as the 19th century turned to the 20th, the Corps is once again assessing the implications of a naval campaign across the vast stretches of the Pacific. Though China possesses modern weapons of great range and precision and is investing heavily in hypersonic weaponry and endeavoring to amplify the effectiveness of its current capabilities with artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and cyber, this challenge in many ways is no different from the challenges the Corps assessed during the 1920s and 1930s, because competition between forces is always relative. Sensors, range, accuracy, and mobility were less than their counterparts today, but both sides were dealing with the same technologies. These attributes are more advanced today, but both sides seek to exploit them. China has a better ability to detect enemy forces at greater ranges and to deliver weapons at those ranges with extraordinary accuracy, but its inventory of such weapons is limited. And U.S. forces have better mobility than they did nearly 100 years ago; their weapons are cutting-edge; they are able to leverage their own cyber capabilities to frustrate China\u2019s command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems; and if employed properly, they can overwhelm China\u2019s ability to focus its efforts in any one area by presenting a variety of threats from many different directions.\n\nThat is what competition in warfare is all about: not ceding any advantage to one\u2019s opponent, making necessary investments in operational concepts and related capabilities that give one advantages and deny the same to the enemy, and being willing to adapt organizationally so as to align the institution and operational units with the tools and techniques that are best suited to winning in combat.\n\nUnfortunately, the Corps is perhaps challenged more by self-generated constraints that inhibit its willingness and ability to adapt as it must. In its efforts to do everything, it has spread its finite resources (time, attention, units, platforms, and budget) across so many things that it cannot focus sufficiently on any one area. It lacks a unifying vision or purpose\u2014the very thing that is most important when circumstances are least certain.\n\nIf there is one thing that the Corps can do to posture itself most effectively to prepare for the future, it is to define what it can (and should) contribute to U.S. military power that no other service can contribute. It should not attempt to be a contributor in all areas of military operations. Regional combatant commanders will always have validated requirements that exceed what our current force structure can satisfy, because such demands are insatiable. Special operations forces have never before been in such demand as they are today, and cyber seems to be regarded as the must-have organic capability without which a force is doomed to fail in war. More can always be done to improve the capability of partners, shape security environments, preclude minor challenges from becoming major national security problems, forestall the expansion of a competitor into some new area, or gain better awareness of some region. But by trying to do everything, to respond to as many requests as it has resources, the Corps is failing to assess risk to strategic national security interests, determine what is necessary to generate and maintain its unique ability to contribute to naval power, and differentiate itself from the Army and the special operations community.\n\nMuch as it is today, the Marine Corps found itself on two distinctly different paths during the two decades between World War I and World War II. By the late 1930s, the Corps had been fully engaged in its Colonial Phase for 40 years, punctuated by its 15-month involvement in World War I (June 1917\u2013November 1918).REF The exploits of the 4th Marine Brigade,REF in particular, became part of the Corps\u2019 legend even though the vast majority of the Corps\u2019 experiences was in \u201csmall wars\u201d stretching from the Philippines to Nicaragua and to Shanghai. Yet as significant as World War I was for the Corps\u2019 coming of age in a \u201cbig war\u201d role, and as busy as the Corps was kept with deployments to various smaller-scale conflicts around the world,REF it was also aware (along with the Army and Navy) of Japan\u2019s growing imperial interests in the Western Pacific. The Corps joined its sister services in considering what would be necessary to project naval power across the Pacific should the U.S. determine that its own interests were at stake, and it invested substantial resources in trying to figure out how to solve the problem of landing combat forces on a foreign shore.\n\nTwo key documents took shape during the 1930s that reflected these two tracks\u2014landing or amphibious operations and \u201csmall\u201d or expeditionary wars\u2014with both initial editions published within a year of each other. In a sense, one looked back to capture lessons from the Corps\u2019 decades of experience in \u201csmall wars,\u201d while the other looked forward, capturing insights from a range of experiments and exercises undertaken to determine new methods for executing the amphibious operations needed to move naval power forward across oceanic distances. Tentative Manual for Landing Operations (1934)REF and Small Wars Operations (1935, later revised and issued as Small Wars Manual in 1940)REF were the products of intensive study, institutional focus, and a commitment to figuring out how to solve very difficult problems. In both cases, the Corps set aside the resources necessary to develop practical doctrine grounded in proven techniques. This led to organizational designs, employment methods, and related material requirements from the care, use, and feeding of horses and the utility of automatic weapons to landing craft and amphibious combat vehicles that made possible the seizure and defense of advance naval bases. The Corps was successful in bridging current and future demands because it made the commitment to do so, to invest the necessary resources in solving problems, and to avoid the temptation either to remain comfortable in what it knew best (small wars) or to allow what had so recently made it famous (its exploits during World War I) to constrain its future.\n\nToday, the Corps has earned accolades for its sustained performance in land operations since 2001, first in Afghanistan and later in Iraq, in establishing crisis response units oriented on Africa and the Middle East, and its contributions to special operations activities in Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. It has articulated a need to rediscover amphibious operations originating and sustained from at-sea platforms as well as the implications for widely distributed operations in a contested littoral zone, but it has spent a great deal of time and garnered more attention for its deployments to Norway for cold-weather operations on NATO\u2019s northern flank, with Russia the presumed catalyst for action,REF and Darwin, Australia, a signal of America\u2019s increased interest in the Indo-Pacific region and hedge against China\u2019s expansionism and North Korea\u2019s aspirations.REF\n\nWhat the Corps needs to do is invest the time, effort, and resources necessary to figure out how to facilitate a naval campaign against China in the Indo-Pacific region and to do so at a scale and with the intensity it devoted to figuring out how to conduct landing operations during the 1920s and 1930s. If the U.S. has indeed found that history has returned with a vengeance and that it is once again in competition with major powers on a global scale, then the U.S. military must do its part to ensure that national interests can be protected at that scale. The Marine Corps can lead the way by focusing on its unique role, prescribed by law,REF clarified by directive,REF and implemented in practice.REF\n\nIntellectually, it is off to a good start, which is hardly surprising given the Corps\u2019 recent history of conceptualizing its role in contributing to naval power since the mid-1990s. It has long appreciated that advances in various technologies (sensor, data analysis and resulting information sharing, precision weaponry) and the most likely environments for combat (the congested littorals) suggest that Fleet Marine Forces will need to operate more dispersed, move with less signature, and avoid an enemy\u2019s massed capabilities so that it can frustrate the enemy\u2019s efforts by presenting multiple problems and thereby thin the enemy\u2019s resources and restrict its options in the battlespace.\n\nIn 1992, the Navy and Marine Corps jointly published a White Paper entitled \u201c\u2026From the Sea.\u201d The paper was spurred by the collapse of the Soviet Union and the consequent rethinking of its implications for U.S. national security interests and related military capabilities. Its context so neatly resembles today\u2019s challenge of considering the implications of a return to \u201cgreat power competition\u201d that a good portion of the Introduction bears repeating:\n\nThe world has changed dramatically in the last two years, and America\u2019s national security policy has also changed. As a result, the priorities of the Navy and Marine Corps have shifted, leading to this broad assessment of the future direction of our maritime forces.\n\nThe fundamental shift in national security policy was first articulated by the President at the Aspen Institute on August 2, 1990. The new policy is reflected in the President\u2019s National Security Strategy and the \u201cBase Force\u201d concept developed by the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n\nThis National Security Strategy has profound implications for the Navy and Marine Corps. Our strategy has shifted from a focus on a global threat to a focus on regional challenges and opportunities. While the prospect of global war has receded, we are entering a period of enormous uncertainty in regions critical to our national interests. Our forces can help to shape the future in ways favorable to our interests by underpinning our alliances, precluding threats, and helping to preserve the strategic position we won with the end of the Cold War.\n\nOur naval forces will be full participants in the principal elements of this strategy\u2014strategic deterrence and defense, forward presence, crisis response, and reconstitution.\n\nWith a far greater emphasis on joint and combined operations, our Navy and Marine Corps will provide unique capabilities of indispensable value in meeting our future security challenges. American Naval Forces provide powerful yet unobtrusive presence; strategic deterrence; control of the seas; extended and continuous on-scene crisis response; project precise power from the sea; and provide sealift if larger scale warfighting scenarios emerge. These maritime capabilities are particularly well tailored for the forward presence and crisis response missions articulated in the President\u2019s National Security Strategy.\n\nOur ability to command the seas in areas where we anticipate future operations allows us to resize our naval forces and to concentrate more on capabilities required in the complex operating environment of the \u201clittoral\u201d or coastlines of the earth. With the demise of the Soviet Union, the free nations of the world claim preeminent control of the seas and ensure freedom of commercial maritime passage. As a result, our national maritime policies can afford to de-emphasize efforts in some naval warfare areas. But the challenge is much more complex than simply reducing our present naval forces. We must structure a fundamentally different naval force to respond to strategic demands, and that new force must be sufficiently flexible and powerful to satisfy enduring national security requirements.\n\nThe new direction of the Navy and Marine Corps team, both active and reserve, is to provide the nation:\n\nNaval Expeditionary Forces\n\nShaped for Joint Operations\n\nOperating Forward from the Sea\n\nTailored for National Needs\n\nThis strategic direction, derived from the National Security Strategy, represents a fundamental shift away from open-ocean warfighting on the sea toward joint operations conducted from the sea. The Navy and Marine Corps will now respond to crises and can provide the initial, \u201cenabling\u201d capability for joint operations in conflict\u2014as well as continued participation in any sustained effort. We will be part of a \u201csea-air-land\u201d team trained to respond immediately to the Unified Commanders as they execute national policy. REF\n\n\u201c\u2026From the Sea\u201d highlighted the ability to reduce capabilities in open-ocean naval warfare as a consequence of gaining \u201cpreeminent control of the seas\u201d once the Soviet Navy had effectively ceased to exist, and it noted a strategic shift from \u201ca global threat to a focus on regional challenges\u201d driving a focus on operating in complex littoral areas. Today, the U.S. is not concerned with a single global challenger like the Soviet Union, but the aggregate of several major regional challengers poses the same type of problem when it comes to the capacity of the force to be in many areas at once, operating against major state competitors that are fielding advanced military capabilities.\n\nThough this shift to contested littorals is the same today as it was in 1992, the advancements of many weapons and sensors, to include longer range and greater precision, make coastal and archipelagic waters much more lethal. Neither China nor Russia is yet able to compete for dominance on the high seas, but neither needs to do so. Rather, they seek to control maritime areas of immediate importance to their national security interests, and these lie in coastal areas and include shipping lanes through which raw materials, finished goods, and sources of energy (petroleum products and liquefied natural gas) are moved. In short, the challenges and opportunities for the Corps and the Navy are similar in focus today as they were during the last great shift in strategic focus, but they are more severe and more important given the greater complexity and capabilities of America\u2019s competitors.\n\nIn fairly short order, the Corps responded with a number of concepts intended to explain how it would meet the challenge articulated in \u201c\u2026From the Sea,\u201d and these informed its programmatic efforts to equip its forces accordingly.\n\nIn Operational Maneuver from the Sea (OMFTS),REF published in 1996, the Marines described how amphibious forces would leverage the sea as a giant maneuver area that would enable them to gain positional advantage over an enemy. Its companion concept, Ship-to-Objective Maneuver (STOM),REF made the case for launching amphibious assaults from over the horizon, thought to be necessary by the increasing ranges of enemy surveillance systems and anti-ship weaponry. Among the key programs directly related to this concept were the Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle (EFV), MV-22 Osprey, and F-35B Joint Strike Fighter.\n\nThe Navy and Marine Corps continued the conversation with \u201cForward\u2026From the Sea,\u201dREF published in 1997, the same year STOM was published. \u201cForward\u2026From the Sea\u201d again emphasized the importance of being able to operate in the littorals for the specific purpose of projecting power inland and dictating how the maritime environment in proximity to shore could be used. It did not have a meaningful impact on the Navy\u2019s shipbuilding program, which continued to emphasize large, multipurpose warships that favored long-range strike missions executed by cruise missiles and strike aircraft operating from carriers.\n\nThe efforts to further develop near-shore operational concepts and capabilities were interrupted by the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. As noted, the Corps turned to the immediate demands of operations in Afghanistan and Iraq and developed a special operations capability as its contribution to USSOCOM efforts. It was not until 2005 that the Corps published its next paper on operating in a highly contested space against an adversary with substantial capabilities. \u201cA Concept for Distributed Operations\u201dREF discussed the importance of being able to operate in a way that caused problems for an enemy while generating advantages for Marine forces. It implied new organizational designs at the tactical level and certainly better capabilities with which to coordinate and support small units operating at distance from each other, but little was seen programmatically to turn the idea into reality.\n\nThe next several Navy\u2013Marine Corps papers emphasized such questions as presence, alliances, and confidence building to the detriment of focusing the Navy on warfighting, its chief purpose as a military service. However, they did highlight the importance of establishing control of the sea, which \u201cmay require projecting power ashore to neutralize threats or control terrain in the landward portion of the littorals,\u201dREF and emphasized a regional focus on \u201cthe Western Pacific and the Arabian Gulf/Indian Ocean.\u201dREF Naval Operations Concept 2010 was much more explicit about the warfighting purpose of sea power and the necessity of controlling the seas, as \u201cit allows naval forces to close within striking distance of land to neutralize land-based threats to maritime access, which in turn enhances freedom of action at sea and the resulting ability to project power ashore.\u201dREF\n\nThis raises the obvious question of how to gain sea control in the littorals when enemy forces now have the ability to influence the maritime domain from shore, using long-range anti-ship cruise missiles (ASCMs), shore-based maritime patrol aircraft capable of carrying torpedoes and ASCMs, and fighter/attack aircraft capable of delivering other types of ordnance against naval targets. This role for amphibious forces\u2014supporting sea control in the littorals\u2014was acknowledged in subsequent Marine Corps and naval papers:\n\nMarine Corps Operating Concept (MOC); REF\n\n(MOC); Littoral Operations in a Contested Environment (LOCE); REF and\n\n(LOCE); and Expeditionary Advanced Base Operations (EABO). REF\n\nThe Marine Corps Operating Concept established the framework for the Corps\u2019 current thinking about the nature of anticipated operating environments. It characterizes enemy threat capabilities and discusses related implications with which Marine forces will have to contend as well as major themes that should guide the Corps\u2019 development of its own capabilities, among which is a unit\u2019s ability to manage its electromagnetic or energy signature so that it will be able to reduce the chances of detection and survive on the modern battlefield.\n\nMost important, the MOC asserts that \u201c[t]he Marine Corps is currently not organized, trained, and equipped to meet the demands of a future operating environment characterized by complex terrain, technology proliferation, information warfare, the need to shield and exploit signatures, and an increasingly non-permissive maritime domain.\u201dREF This is a profound indictment of the Corps\u2019 shortcomings in fulfilling its primary and historically rooted warfighting role: \u201c[F]ighting at and from the sea was, is, and will remain a core competency that the Nation requires.\u201dREF By this, the MOC clearly means that the Corps must provide this warfighting competency.\n\nFinally, the MOC strongly implies the need to experiment, hinting at the utility of unmanned systems in various applications.REF\n\nLOCE takes the discussion further, adding details to the outline created by the MOC. As with the MOC, it restates (but more explicitly) key tenets of naval power, especially as it pertains to control of essential maritime geography, and thereby revalidates the importance of the Corps\u2019 role in contributing to the prosecution of a naval campaign: \u201c[F]uture adversaries may be capable of controlling choke points, holding key maritime terrain, or denying freedom of action and maneuver within the littorals by imposing unacceptable risk to forces at ever increasing ranges.\u201dREF Without actually saying so, this reveals the importance of U.S. forces being able to control choke points, hold key terrain, and deny freedom of action to the enemy.\n\nThus, it is imperative that Fleet Marine Forces be able to fulfill their amphibious role as part of a naval force to deny these advantages to the enemy by:\n\nSeizing and defending \u201cadvanced naval bases or lodgments to facilitate subsequent joint operations\u201d;\n\nConducting \u201ccomplex expeditionary operations in the urban littorals\u201d; and\n\nConducting \u201camphibious operations\u2026to assure access\u201d for naval and follow-on forces. REF\n\nLOCE also raises the idea of an alternative force structure for both the Corps and the Navy. Noting the risk to sustainable, resilient naval power, LOCE explains how the Navy\u2019s current fleet design relies too heavily on a limited number of large, multipurpose warships so that the loss of one \u201cwould degrade the force\u2019s ability to accomplish the mission.\u201dREF This has substantial implications for the Navy\u2019s (and thus the Marine Corps\u2019) 30-year shipbuilding plan, which includes a 38-ship objective composed of large, multipurpose amphibious warships and no alternative platforms or fleet architecture of the type implied by LOCE. Thus, it appears that the analysis and ideas woven into the most current naval conceptual documents are at odds with current Navy\u2013Marine Corps primary fleet programs that are the heart of naval power.\n\nFinally, the Marine Corps has been developing a concept that harkens back to the Corps\u2019 effort in the 1930sREF to envision how amphibious forces might establish advanced bases to \u201c\u2018turn the sea denial table\u2019 on potential adversaries.\u201dREF As explained in the LOCE paper, \u201cThe EABO concept further distributes lethality by providing land-based options for increasing the number of sensors and shooters beyond the upper limit imposed by the quantity of seagoing platforms available\u201d and \u201cespouses employing mobile, relatively low-cost capabilities in austere, temporary locations forward\u201d in the contested littorals. In addition:\n\nExpeditionary advanced bases may be used to position naval ISR assets, future CDCMs [coastal defense cruise missiles], anti-air missiles (to counter cruise and ballistic missiles as well as aircraft), and forward arming and refueling points (FARPs) and other expedient expeditionary operating sites for aircraft, critical munitions reloading teams for ships and submarines, or to provide expeditionary basing for surface screening/scouting platforms, all of which serve to increase friendly sensor and shooter capacity while complicating adversary targeting. They may also control, or at least outpost, key maritime terrain to improve the security of sea lines of communications (SLOCs) and chokepoints or deny their use to the enemy, and exploit and enhance the natural barriers formed by island chains.\n\nTo accomplish all of this, the EABO discussion within the LOCE paper suggests that:\n\n[T]he Navy and Marine Corps must pursue the ability to network sea-based and land-based sensors and shooters. Additionally, the Navy should determine what current or planned sensors and weapons can be fielded in an expeditionary variant while the Marine Corps should determine what changes to existing Marine systems can enhance their utility in a sea denial or sea control fight. Furthermore, new initiatives, such as fielding a common anti-ship missile that can be launched from existing surface combatants, submarines, manned (and perhaps unmanned) aircraft, and mobile ground launchers, should be explored. REF\n\nAcross these documents, published between 1992 and 2018, both naval services have repeatedly emphasized the importance of being able to win the naval battle in complex, littoral waters. The various concepts acknowledge the advancements made in sensors and weaponry that make operating within the enemy\u2019s range of weaponry\u2014increasingly large as the range of weapons improves\u2014a high-risk proposition. The services assess that this means naval forces will have to operate in a more dispersed manner; that numbers matter both to offset combat losses and to complicate the enemy\u2019s efforts (he has to account for more threats in more places); and that \u201csignature management\u201d will be increasingly important to preserve combat power (minimize combat losses from enemy attack) and enhance the effectiveness of U.S. forces when sensors of all types are better able to detect things.\n\nFinally, all of these concepts emphasize the necessity of adapting to evolving conditions. The global geostrategic picture changes. State powers rise and fall, affecting U.S. interests in various regions in various ways. Where the U.S. once had many allies with substantial capabilities and itself possessed a military structured for major conflict on a global scale, it now has a greatly reduced military, less of a military presence based abroad, allies that have neglected their militaries even more than the U.S. has, and more competitor", "description": "Executive Summary \n\nThe primary role of the U.S. Marine Corps is established by U.S. law and Department of Defense (DOD) directive:", "authors": ["Dakota Wood"], "top_image": "https://www.heritage.org/themes/heritage/src/images/bell.png"}
