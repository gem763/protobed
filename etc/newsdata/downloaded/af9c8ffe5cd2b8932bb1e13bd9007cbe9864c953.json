It is not available to landlords who self-manage their investment properties.\n\nTo date, more than $60 million of tradie jobs have flowed across the app, representing more than 51,000 individual transactions. Managed takes a small fee on each successful job.\n\n\"We're similar to Airtasker [an online marketplace that enables users to outsource everyday tasks] but we take a much smaller clip of the ticket,\" Mr Whitlock said.\n\nHe said REA Group's investment was sizeable, with the funds to be used to grow its team and introduce new bolt-on services.\n\n\"We won't have to do a capital raising for the forseeable future,\" he told The Australian Financial Review.\n\nAndrew Rechtman, chief customer product officer at REA Group, said the investment reinforced its commitment to its property management customers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"By working with new software providers, such as Managed App, we will increase operating efficiencies for property managers, helping streamline the number of systems required to complete their work,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Bouris said the app\u2019s integrated payment system is helping tradies get paid quickly and keeping tenants happier \"with speedier attention to any issues\".", "description": "Tenants use the managed platform to pay rent and lodge requests for maintenance and repairs.
