Not just holidays, but even mundane matters like taking care of the car. When a pipe broke in her toilet, spraying water all over, Ms. Zawadzki, 68 , didn\u2019t know what valve to turn off or whom to call. Mail for him kept coming.\n\nWhat she didn\u2019t expect, though, was how difficult it would be to turn on her stove. Or how hard it would be to go to a restaurant with their friends and be the only one driving home by herself at the end of the night. Or how it would feel to walk supermarket aisles, past the foods he loved.\n\nIn the checkout line, she\u2019d watch the clerk scan produce she knew would rot, and bread she knew would go stale; she was still shopping for two, but eating for one. When her freezer filled with excess food, she started throwing out meals \u2014 throwing out his portion, really, because he wasn\u2019t there to eat it.", "description": "New attention is being paid to the role of food and cooking in grieving for a lost partner.", "authors": ["Amelia Nierenberg"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/30/dining/28widows6/28widows6-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
