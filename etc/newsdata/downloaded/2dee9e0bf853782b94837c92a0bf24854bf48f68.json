The rest could be marsquakes \u2014 or something else. The French seismometer is so sensitive it can hear the Martian wind as well as movements by the lander's robot arm and other mechanical \" \" as the team calls them.\n\nInSight arrived at Mars last November and recorded its first seismic rumbling in April.\n\nA German drilling instrument, meanwhile, has been inactive for months.
