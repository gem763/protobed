Talk about the eww factor.\n\nThis guy\u2019s whacked. That\u2019s all there is to it.\n\nSoderland, a behavioral scientist and marketing strategist, brought forth the idea in a talk bluntly titled, \u201cCan you Imagine Eating Human Flesh?\u201d\n\nUmm, no. Not without gagging, that is.\n\nAmong the talking points from his presentation, as reported by The Standard: \u201cAre we humans too selfish to live sustainably? Is cannibalism the solution to food sustainability in the future? Does Generation Z have the answers to our food challenges? Can consumers be tricked into making the right decisions?\u201d\n\nThat last question sounds some alarms because it brings with it this followup: Tricked?\n\nGod forbid government \u2014 any government \u2014 gets it in its governing mind to \u201ctrick\u201d the people into eating chopped up human flesh. It\u2019s bad enough the United Nations wants us to eat bugs. But people? Perish the thought. It\u2019s enough to make a meat-eater turn vegetarian.\n\nSoderland said it\u2019s all a matter of overcoming the gross factor.\n\n\u201cI feel somewhat hesitant,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d have to say [though] \u2026 I\u2019d be open to at least tasting it.\u201d\n\nDisease much?\n\nDespicable.\n\nHonestly, it just doesn\u2019t get much more immoral than this. Think about it: If we have to do a Jeffrey Dahmer to defeat climate change \u2014 there might be something wrong with this picture.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
