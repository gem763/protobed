Today seems to be another 'China Is Great' day, but future talks face a higher risk.\"\n\nExpectations have been high that the two sides could announce some kind of mini deal that would delay a U.S. tariff increase set for next week.\n\nMnuchin said U.S. and Chinese officials \u201chave had a productive two days of discussions\u201c but declined to confirm anything on the status of the talks.\n\n\u201cWe will be meeting with the president shortly. We will be updating the president on those, he\u2019ll then be meeting with the vice premier,\u201d he said Friday afternoon during a press briefing threatening new sanctions on Turkey. \u201cWe\u2019ll be making more announcements after we meet with the president.\u201d\n\nLiu on Friday morning warmly greeted Lighthizer and Mnuchin outside the USTR building. Trump was also in an upbeat mood Friday, writing on Twitter: \" Good things are happening at China Trade Talk Meeting. Warmer feelings than in recent past, more like the Old Days. I will be meeting with the Vice Premier today. All would like to see something significant happen!\"\n\nLiu and Trump will meet this afternoon, and it's likely that the details of any potential short-term agreement \u2014 if one is reached \u2014 would not be announced until after that event.\n\nTrump on Friday also seemed to be taking a longer-term view, looking ahead to a day when he could sign a more comprehensive agreement \u2014 the kind of deal that would require negotiators to settle the tougher issues at the heart of the trade war. That type of deal \u2014 as long as it would not require changes to U.S. law \u2014 would not need congressional approval, unlike the new North American trade deal the Trump administration negotiated with Canada and Mexico last year.\n\n\"One of the great things about the China Deal is the fact that, for various reasons, we do not have to go through the very long and politically complex Congressional Approval Process,\" Trump tweeted. \" When the deal is fully negotiated, I sign it myself on behalf of our Country. Fast and Clean!\"\n\nOptimism that the two sides are headed toward some sort of partial deal boosted Asian markets overnight and led U.S. markets to open more than 1 percent above Thursday\u2019s close. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 400 points by 1:30 p.m., while the broader Standard & Poor\u2019s index also climbed 1.5 percent.\n\nA deal to at least partially address U.S. concerns and provide more time for negotiations on harder issues would help Lighthizer, who turned 72 on Friday, focus his attention on other trade matters, such as finishing talks with Democrats on issues blocking congressional approval of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement.\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS Morning Trade A speed read on global trade news \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

China previously had been a top market for U.S. farm exports, but sales have plummeted because of Chinese retaliation to tariffs that Trump began imposing in the summer of 2018.\n\nThe Agriculture Department reported Thursday that China bought 2.09 million metric tons of U.S. soybeans and 130,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat during the week of Sept. 27 to Oct. 3. Altogether, China has bought a total of 4.79 million metric tons of U.S. soybeans for delivery in the 2019-2020 marketing year, up sharply from just 1.08 million at the same point last year.\n\nBeijing has also bought 142,000 tonnes of pork for delivery in 2019 and 2020, providing some relief to U.S. pork producers who also have been hit hard by the trade war, USDA said.\n\nStill, a partial deal could carry political risk for Trump if the terms provide an opening for Democrats to accuse him of caving to Beijing. One particular area of concern is Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications giant currently subject to U.S. sanctions due to national security concerns.\n\n\"A China mini deal?\" Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer wrote on Twitter. \" It must not include concessions on Huawei. That\u2019s what China wants most, and it would show tremendous weakness.\"\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/58/8a/d2daf87f40efb6659b806130f7dc/190821-trump-jinping-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
