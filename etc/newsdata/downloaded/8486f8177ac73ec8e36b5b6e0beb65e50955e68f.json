The European Council\u2019s decision to delay our departure until the end of October gives us a fantastic opportunity to drive through to victory.\n\nThe European Parliament elections on 23 May will be a perfect platform to say why staying in the EU is in the national interest \u2013 and how giving the people the Final Say is the best way to cancel Brexit. The elections will be seen as a dry run for a referendum. If patriotic pro-Europeans turn out in force, the momentum in favour of a new vote could be unstoppable.\n\nNothing, of course, is in the bag. The prime minister still hopes to avoid the European elections by cutting a deal with Labour \u2013 and using its votes to get Brexit through parliament.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nBut why should the opposition play ball? Most Labour MPs are adamant that any Brexit deal \u2013 even a so-called softer one that involves us staying in the EU\u2019s customs union \u2013 should be put to the people in a confirmatory ballot. If Jeremy Corbyn went against their wishes, he\u2019d split the party and get the blame for ushering in a Tory Brexit.\n\nTheresa May wanted to scare Corbyn with the bogeyman of European elections. But the Labour leadership seems to have clocked the fact that they could actually be in its interests. It would get 38% of the vote, while the Tories would get only 23%, according to a poll yesterday for Open Europe.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. \u2018Brexit is like...\u2019 The Top 20 Twitter analogies Show all 20 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

Ironically Brexit also sounds like a constipation relief medicine.\" Shutterstock / sasha2109\n\nNot surprisingly, John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, told ITV on Wednesday night that he doubted a deal would be done with the Conservatives before the European elections. With the Tories running scared, why would Labour avoid a date with the electorate?\n\nWell, there is one reason. Unless Labour comes decisively off the fence on whether it is committed to a referendum on any Brexit outcome, many pro-Europeans (including EU citizens living here) will vote for other parties \u2013 such as the Liberal Democrats, Greens and The Independent Group. Conversely, if Corbyn stops his umming and ahhing and says clearly he wants a referendum, Labour could clean up.\n\nEither way, pro-Europeans are likely to do well in the election. We are passionate. We have the wind in our sails. Around a million people marched for a People\u2019s Vote last month. Over 6 million signed a petition calling for Brexit to be cancelled.\n\nBy contrast, Brexiters are down in the dogs. Many won\u2019t turn up to vote \u2013 according to both the Open Europe poll and a similar one by YouGov. It suggested that 55% of those who backed Remain in 2016 would definitely vote in the European elections, whereas only 40% of those who voted Leave would.\n\nAssuming pro-Europeans do well, the political landscape will look different after the elections. More MPs will back a People\u2019s Vote if they sense public opinion has shifted. The media will give us more airtime \u2013 and the oxygen of publicity will help our cause. More Brexiters will recant \u2013 following in the footsteps of U-turns from LBC radio\u2019s Nick Ferrari and the Daily Mail\u2019s Peter Oborne.\n\nMPs may also shift into our camp as the flaws of various forms of \u201csoft\u201d Brexit, especially a customs union, become apparent. The scheme being pushed by Ken Clarke, the Tory MP, is staggeringly vague. It is also unpopular with the vast chunk of the Conservative Party.\n\nFortunately, Labour is in no mood to sign up to a pig in a poke. McDonnell told ITV that if the party did manage to do a deal with the Tories, this would require legislation which has been \u201cproperly scrutinized, that is effective, that will stand the test of time\u201d.\n\nAs a customs union is examined, it is likely to fall apart like a chocolate orange. There are a host of problems including the one that Liam Fox, the pro-Brexit trade secretary, has put his finger on \u2013 namely that the EU could sell access to our market to other countries without us having a say.\n\nThe prime minister has tried three times to get her miserable deal through parliament \u2013 and failed every time. She may have another go before the summer break. Given the Speaker\u2019s ruling that she can\u2019t keep putting the same vote to MPs again and again, she could try another approach, introducing legislation rather than just having a \u201cmeaningful\u201d vote.\n\nBut May\u2019s chances of getting MPs to back this deal are small. The hardliners in the ERG show no desire to fall into line. Her erstwhile partners in the DUP are adamantly opposed. And any Labour MPs tempted to support her must be worried that she could be kicked out and replaced by somebody like Boris Johnson who would then go for an even harder form of Brexit.\n\nThe one way the prime minister could get her deal through is by agreeing to put it to a public vote. There would be an overwhelming majority in parliament for that. May herself may finally come to the conclusion that this is the path of least resistance \u2013 as it would cause a smaller split in the Tory party than embracing a customs union. Unlike various softer forms of Brexit, it also doesn\u2019t contradict the last Conservative Party manifesto.\n\nBut it\u2019s also possible that the prime minister will do what she so often does \u2013 kick the can. Just because the European Council president warned her last night not to waste the extra time doesn\u2019t mean that she won\u2019t try.\n\nBut MPs can stop her. They have shown this week that they can pass emergency legislation against the government\u2019s wishes. If she dithers, they could force a referendum, perhaps even on her deal.\n\nThere is much speculation that hardline Tories will kick the the prime minister out because she has agreed another Brexit delay which will involve holding the European elections. But it\u2019s not easy to do that since nobody can challenge her until December under Conservative Party rules.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, May is clinging onto office like a limpet \u2013 and there\u2019s no consensus on who would take her place. The more pro-European wing of her Cabinet meanwhile seems to be rallying around \u201cnurse, for fear of finding something worse\u201d, to quote Hilarie Belloc.\n\nThe EU\u2019s decision to set a new Brexit day at the end of October makes it even harder to remove the prime minister. Even if her rivals crowbar her out of office, it will be difficult to get anybody else in place soon enough to conduct meaningful talks with the EU.\n\nOf course, one way of getting rid of May would be for her own MPs to join Labour in a vote of no-confidence against the government. But this would trigger a general election which Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, rightly says would be \u201ccatastrophic\u201d for the Tories.\n\nOne can never completely discount the possibility that some Conservatives could behave like lemmings and charge over the cliff. But even if they do, that will be good for pro-Europeans. Provided Labour pinned its colours firmly to the pro-referendum mast, we would have a good shot at getting a government committed to a public vote.\n\nThere will not be time to hold European elections, a general election and a referendum, all by the end of October. But an incoming Labour government could ask the EU for yet more time. Alternatively, it could argue that a general election gave it a mandate to cancel Brexit.\n\nEven without throwing a general election into the mix, it will be hard to hold European elections and a referendum in six and a half months. But provided MPs decide they want to give the public the final say by early June, it should be possible.\n\nIf we need a little bit extra of time, the EU would probably agree. But we shouldn\u2019t count on it. Last night\u2019s European Council decision gives us a marvellous opportunity. We need to get cracking.\n\nHugo Dixon is chair of InFacts", "description": "MPs and the public are already shifting in favour of a new Brexit referendum.
