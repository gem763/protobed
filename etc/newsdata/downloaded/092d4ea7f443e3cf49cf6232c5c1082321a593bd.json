Similar to Florida's \"stand your ground\" law, the Castle Doctrine allows people to use lethal force to defend themselves from harm that presents itself in the comfort of their own home.\n\n\"Of course that's tricky because we know Amber Guyger was not in her own home,\" Merritt said.\n\nHe said if the judge refuses to instruct the jury on the Castle Doctrine, Guyger is likely to be convicted.\n\nOpening arguments in the case are expected to begin Monday after a jury was picked earlier this month to hear the case.\n\nTom Fox/The Dallas Morning News via AP, File\n\nJean's family, including his parents, brother and sister, are expected to hold a prayer vigil on the steps of the Dallas courthouse Monday morning before the trial begins, Merritt said.\n\n\"We're hoping to see a diverse jury that's able to critically analyze testimony from law enforcement officers,\" Merritt said.\n\nGuyger, 31, was fired from the Dallas Police Department 18 days after she fatally shot Jean. She had been a member of the department for four years.\n\nShe told investigators she arrived home about 10 p.m. after working a 15-hour shift and parked her car on the fourth floor of the building instead of the third floor, which corresponded to her apartment, according to an arrest warrant affidavit by investigators from the Texas Rangers, a division of the Texas Department of Public Safety.\n\nGuyger's apartment was directly beneath Jean's fourth-floor unit.\n\nMesquite Police Department via AP, FILE\n\n\"Guyger entered the building and walked down the fourth-floor hallway to what she thought was her apartment,\" according to the arrest warrant. \"She inserted a unique door key, with an electronic chip, into the door keyhole. The door, which was slightly ajar prior to Guyger's arrival, fully opened under the force of the key insertion.\"\n\nWhen the door opened, she saw a \"large silhouette\" in the nearly completely dark apartment and believed it was a burglar, according to the warrant.\n\nGuyger told investigators she drew her firearm, gave verbal commands that were ignored and fired twice, hitting Jean, who lived alone, in the torso, according to the document.\n\nShe was still in her uniform at the time of the shooting.\n\nShaban Athuman/The Dallas Morning News via AP, File\n\n\"Due to the interior darkness of the apartment, Guyger turned on the interior lights while on the phone with 911. Upon being asked where she was located by emergency dispatchers, Guyger returned to the front door to observe the address and discovered she was at the wrong apartment,\" according to the arrest warrant.\n\nBOOKED: As Botham Jean was laid to rest at his funeral today, authorities released booking video of Dallas police officer Amber Guyger, who claims she mistook his apartment for hers before fatally shooting him; she currently faces a manslaughter charge. https://t.co/wpgejkGJIh pic.twitter.com/bYTYe4LbHb \u2014 World News Tonight (@ABCWorldNews) September 13, 2018\n\nDuring his funeral, Jean, who was an accountant for PricewaterhouseCoopers, was recalled by mourners as a man of many talents: a strong Christian, a beloved friend, dependable work colleague and a gifted singer. Jean's uncle said he had aspirations of becoming a politician in his native country of Saint Lucia.\n\nRyan Tarinelli/AP, FILE\n\n\"The sound of gunshots did not have the resonance to be heard on our small island, but their impact was of nuclear proportions,\" Jean's uncle, Ignatius Jean, told mourners at the funeral. \"A nuke had been unleashed on our family by someone charged to protect and serve.\"\n\nGuyger was initially arrested and charged with manslaughter. But a Dallas County grand jury later indicted her on one count of murder.\n\nGuyger's defense team had requested a change of venue for the trial, arguing Guyger couldn\u2019t get a fair trial in Dallas County because of the publicity surrounding the case.\n\nA judge rejected the request.", "description": "Botham Jean was shot to death in his own apartment in September 2018.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/amber-1-ap-er-190922_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
