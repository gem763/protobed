But we allow the homophobes to be able to control the agenda,\" he said.\n\nDetails: Biden said he would have an office in his administration's State Department that would promote LGBTQ rights globally.

Cory Booker\n\nHis big picture: Booker referred to his own experience with discrimination as the background for his passion for the issue, saying he was \"a kid who was raised to understand that my rights and privileges are not enshrined in the Constitution originally.
