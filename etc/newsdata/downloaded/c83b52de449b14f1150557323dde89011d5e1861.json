What about the giant diamond Hunter Biden received from a wealthy Chinese businessman?", "language": "en", "text": "Forget Ukraine and Hunter Biden. There\u2019s another story we should be paying attention to and the best part is that Hunter has admitted to it, which just raises more questions.\n\nVia an interview he gave to the New Yorker and published in July, what\u2019s the deal with the giant diamond he received from a wealthy Chinese businessman? Did he pay taxes on it as income?\n\nSomeone please ask Joe Biden if his son paid taxes on the giant diamond he received from the Chinese businessman. pic.twitter.com/zmPvT5Lbyr \u2014 Greg Pollowitz (@GPollowitz) September 21, 2019\n\nFrom the New Yorker. This happened in 2017 and Hunter says it\u2019s not a big deal because Joe Biden wasn\u2019t in office:\n\nOne of Kathleen\u2019s motions contains a reference to \u201ca large diamond\u201d that had come into Hunter\u2019s possession. The motion seems to imply that it was one of Hunter\u2019s \u201cpersonal indulgences.\u201d When I asked him about it, he told me that he had been given the diamond by the Chinese energy tycoon Ye Jianming, who was trying to make connections in Washington among prominent Democrats and Republicans, and whom he had met in the middle of the divorce. Hunter told me that two associates accompanied him to his first meeting with Ye, in Miami, and that they surprised him by giving Ye a magnum of rare vintage Scotch worth thousands of dollars.\n\nHunter claims he gave the $80,000 diamond to his associates:\n\nHunter was on the board of the World Food Program USA, a nonprofit that generates support for the U.N. World Food Programme, and he had hoped that Ye would make a large aid donation. At dinner that night, they discussed the donation, and then the conversation turned to business opportunities. Hunter offered to use his contacts to help identify investment opportunities for Ye\u2019s company, CEFC China Energy, in liquefied-natural-gas projects in the United States. After the dinner, Ye sent a 2.8-carat diamond to Hunter\u2019s hotel room with a card thanking him for their meeting. \u201cI was, like, Oh, my God,\u201d Hunter said. (In Kathleen\u2019s court motion, the diamond is estimated to be worth eighty thousand dollars. Hunter said he believes the value is closer to ten thousand.) When I asked him if he thought the diamond was intended as a bribe, he said no: \u201cWhat would they be bribing me for? My dad wasn\u2019t in office.\u201d Hunter said that he gave the diamond to his associates, and doesn\u2019t know what they did with it. \u201cI knew it wasn\u2019t a good idea to take it. I just felt like it was weird,\u201d he said.\n\nYe then introduced Hunter to Patrick Ho who was later sentenced to three years in prison \u201cfor his role in a multiyear, multimillion-dollar scheme to bribe top government officials in Chad and Uganda\u201d:\n\nIn the summer of 2017, Ye talked with Hunter about his concern that U.S. law-enforcement agencies were investigating one of his associates, Patrick Ho. Hunter, who sometimes works as a private lawyer, agreed to represent Ho, and tried to figure out whether Ho was in legal jeopardy in the U.S. That November, just after Ye and Hunter agreed on the Monkey Island deal, U.S. authorities detained Ho at the airport. He was later sentenced to three years in prison for his role in a multiyear, multimillion-dollar scheme to bribe top government officials in Chad and Uganda in exchange for business advantages for CEFC. In February, 2018, Ye was detained by Chinese authorities, reportedly as part of an anti-corruption investigation, and the deal with Hunter fell through. Hunter said that he did not consider Ye to be a \u201cshady character at all,\u201d and characterized the outcome as \u201cbad luck.\u201d\n\nThe whole New Yorker interview is worth a read. It\u2019s got everything, including a crack pipe left in a rental car, Hunter\u2019s romantic relationship with his brother\u2019s widow and a new tattoo that reads, \u201cshalom.\u201d\n\nWhen I asked him about it, Hunter Biden told me that he had been given the diamond by the Chinese energy tycoon Ye Jianming, who was trying to make connections in Washington among prominent Democrats and Republicans.https://t.co/X9dIKxkMcO \u2014 Robert Faturechi (@RobertFaturechi) July 1, 2019\n\n***", "description": "\"I knew it wasn\u2019t a good idea to take it.
