The Silent Beacon, officials say, can help survivors get immediate, discreet help in life-threatening situations.\n\n\u201cWhen you are a survivor [of domestic violence], you are on edge, looking over your shoulder,\u201d Ms. Lemp said. \u201c[The Silent Beacon] gives you some sense of comfort and safety, just a mind-set change.\u201d\n\nThe Bluetooth-connected device, a small plastic disk, can be attached to a key chain or purse, or worn on the pants or around the neck. With the simultaneous click of two buttons, the device can text and call a pre-set number \u2014 perhaps a friend or the 911 emergency service \u2014 and instantly activates a GPS tracker.\n\nThe Rockville, Maryland, firm that makes Silent Beacon is donating enough devices for all the clients at My Sister\u2019s Shelter for the next year, and since it does not have a subscription fee, the devices are theirs to keep.\n\n\u201cEmergencies don\u2019t happen and you have your phone in your hand,\u201d said Kenny Kelley, founder and president of the Silent Beacon LLC. \u201cThey happen when you can\u2019t get to your phone or when you are being kept from your phone.\u201d\n\nMany survivors can see their abusers often, especially if they have shared custody of their children or, as in some cases, they continue their relationship with them.\n\nMs. Lemp said studies show it can take about eight attempts for a survivor to finally leave their abuser.\n\nThe beacon device also has a silent mode as to not alert people the device has been activated. Mr. Kelley said he got the idea for it because of his own family member\u2019s experience with domestic violence.\n\nMr. Kelley, who is from Montgomery County, was motivated to make the device after he was in two serious car accidents and wasn\u2019t able to reach for his phone to call for help.\n\nMy Sister\u2019s Place provides transitional and emergency housing for survivors of domestic violence and their families as well as social services to help them get back on their feet.\n\nIn its last fiscal year, the shelter housed 139 survivors and 41 children and provided support for an additional 124 survivors who are apart of the shelter\u2019s community. The shelter also trained 300 community members in how to intervene as a bystander and offered help to 95 survivors with a legal clinic.\n\n\u201cDomestic violence encompasses a lot of things; so a lot of times people think of it as physical,\u201d said Ms. Lemp. \u201cBut it can also be emotional and financial.\u201d\n\nAbuse occurs, she said, \u201cany time when there\u2019s somebody who is trying to control somebody else in a way that is limiting their freedom.\u201d\n\nThe District\u2019s hotline number for victims of domestic abuse is 1-(844) 443-5732 and can help place survivors and their families in housing immediately.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
