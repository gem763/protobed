USA TODAY\n\nIt's the most wonderful time of the year. That is, if you like scares, costumes and candy.\n\nHalloween has arrived, a bit awkwardly on a Thursday this year, but that's just an excuse to celebrate the silliest of holidays all weekend long, whether through trick-or-treating, costume parties or Halloween-themed movie and TV binge-watching.\n\nIf the third option is up your alley, we have quite a few choices for you to create any kind of Halloween party, whether you want to be properly scared or you just want to wear a cute costume and laugh.\n\nFrom the \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" episode \"Once more with Feeling\": James Marsters, Emma Caulfield, Amber Benson, Anthony Stewart Head, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Nicholas Brendon, Alyson Hannigan. (Photo: MITCHELL HAASETH, XXX UPN)\n\nIf you want a classic TV series to binge: 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer'\n\nIf you've never seen \"Buffy,\" there has never been a better time to watch, considering a mysterious reboot of the series is in the works. But if you want something to occupy your time for this weekend and beyond, enjoy seven seasons of quips, fights and vampiric romance in this seminal teen horror dramedy. Bonus: the series has three excellent Halloween themed episodes (in Seasons 2, 4 and 6) if you want to skip ahead to trick-or-treating.\n\nStream it on Hulu.\n\nSissy Spacek and Andre Holland in a scene from Castle Rock . (Photo: Hulu)\n\nIf you're in a Stephen King kind of mood: 'Castle Rock'\n\nThere are an incredible number of TV and film adaptations of King's beloved work, and some are better than others (sorry, \"Under the Dome\"). Hulu's latest take on his world of horror combines characters from various stories into a slightly new take on one of his most iconic locales: Castle Rock, Maine. It feels enough like a classic King story to be familiar, but it also has plenty of surprises. The second season, which just debuted, sees Lizzy Caplan stepping into Kathy Bates' iconic role from \"Misery.\"\n\nStream it on Hulu.\n\nJosh Hartnett as Ethan Chandler in Penny Dreadful (Photo: Pat Redmond, Showtime)\n\nIf you want something gothic: 'Penny Dreadful'\n\nIs your idea of horror all black dresses, high towers and candlelit corridors? Showtime's series combines characters from classic Gothic novels like \"The Picture of Dorian Grey\" and \"Frankenstein\" into one story. The familiar characters, superb production and costume design, and fabulous performances from the likes of Josh Hartnett and Eva Green, make the series a delight, even when it's a bit horrifying.\n\nStream on Showtime or Netflix.\n\nMaja (Isabelle Grill, center) and the Harga have some strange traditions in their isolated Swedish village in \"Midsommar.\" (Photo: A24)\n\nIf you want to be in on this year's horror sensation: 'Midsommar'\n\nEvery year has its own horror film breakout, be it the Oscar-nominated \"Get Out\" in 2017 or last year's familiar nightmare \"Hereditary.\" Ari Aster, who disturbed us all with \"Hereditary\" a year ago, returned in 2019 with \"Midsommar,\" about a group of young people who travel to a mysterious, folky \"festival\" that is not quite what it seems. With more flowers and pastel colors than you'd expect, the film gets under your skin and doesn't let go.\n\nAvailable to rent or buy.\n\n(l-r) Nicole Kidman, Goran Visnjic and Sandra Bullock in a scene from the Warner Bros. movie \"Practical Magic.\" (Photo: SUZANNE TENNER, XXX WARNER BROS.)\n\nIf you like not-scary witches, but you're all 'Hocus Pocus'-ed out: 'Practical Magic'\n\nLet's face it: There's too much \"Hocus Pocus\" in pop culture right now. During the month of October you can't turn on cable TV without running into it, or check out Twitter without hearing about it. As much as the classic film is a campy, Halloween feast for the eyes, it's also just a bit played out at this point. Turn instead to Nicole Kidman and Sandra Bullock at their 1990s best in \"Practical Magic,\" another campy witch tale with sisters, only this time there's considerably more drunken \"lime in the coconut\" antics.\n\nAvailable to rent or buy.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2019/10/26/halloween-2019-5-tv-shows-and-movies-binge-watch/2453129001/", "description": "From \"Buffy\" to \"Midsommar\" to \"Practical Magic,\" watch anything horror and campy this Halloween that isn't \"Hocus Pocus,\" OK?", "authors": ["Kelly Lawler", "Published A.M.
