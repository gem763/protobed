But the four successful hacks did not belong to a presidential campaign.\n\nTim Murtaugh, the Trump campaign\u2019s communications director, said in a statement that \u201cwe have no indication that any of our campaign infrastructure was targeted.\u201d Representatives for other presidential candidates said on Friday that their campaigns had not been targeted.\n\nFor weeks, officials from the F.B.I., the Department of Homeland Security and the National Security Agency have said they are particularly concerned about Iranian-backed attacks. Their worries stemmed from rising tensions over new sanctions on Iran and nascent Iranian activity in the 2018 midterm elections.\n\nWhile the officials said they believed that all the presidential campaigns were likely targets, Mr. Trump\u2019s has long been considered a prime one.\n\nIt was Mr. Trump who abandoned the nuclear deal and ramped up sanctions. The United States has also designated the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps a terrorist group. The guard corps oversees the nuclear program and, by some accounts, Iran\u2019s best hacking group, its Cyber Corps.\n\nBut it is not clear whether the group that Microsoft identified reports to the Cyber Corps or is made up, deliberately, of freelancers and others whose affiliations are harder to trace.\n\nWhen Iranian officials are asked about cyberattacks, they admit nothing but note that attacks have been two-way. Three times in the past decade, the United States has directed cyberweapons against Iranian targets. The most famous attack, code-named Olympic Games, wiped out about 1,000 centrifuges at the Natanz nuclear enrichment site.", "description": "The news, according to two people with knowledge of the attacks, followed a Microsoft report that said hackers had targeted a campaign, U.S. officials and journalists.", "authors": ["Nicole Perlroth", "David E.
