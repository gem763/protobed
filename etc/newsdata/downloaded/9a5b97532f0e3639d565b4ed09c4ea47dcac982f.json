I could see her skin colour had changed and her eyes were closed,\" Shannon told Exeter County Hall.\n\nIn his statement, Ben said he was awoken by Lyla-Rae crying at between 3am to 3.40am on July 13, 2018, and took her out of her basket and gave her a feed.\n\nHe said: \"She did not want to go back to sleep. She was wide awake so I put the TV on and put her on her back in the crook of my right arm.\n\n\"She was lying between my body and inside my right arm, and Shannon was to my right. She had not woken.\n\n\"I had not intended to sleep with Lyla-Rae in my bed.\"\n\nWhen Ben then woke up a few hours later he said he saw she was unresponsive.\n\nHe said: \u201cShe was still in the same position and so was l, although her head had moved slightly. She felt cold and she was not breathing.\u201d\n\nBen told how he carried out CPR after calling for an ambulance but she was later pronounced dead at North Devon District Hospital.\n\n(Image: www.devonlive.com)\n\nRecording an open conclusion, coroner Philip Spinney said: \u201cIt simply means the evidence does not fully explain how Lyla-Rae came about her death.\u201d\n\nPaying tribute to her after the inquest, Lyla-Rae's nanny Emma Ayres said: \"She was a beautiful happy baby. She brought joy to all who knew her. I and the rest of the family miss her like crazy.\n\n\"Please be aware of the risks of co-sleeping, especially when you smoke as the risks are higher.\n\n\"We never thought something like this would happen to our family and the pain and anger of losing our beautiful angel will never go away. We will love you forever Lyla.\"\n\nThe inquest heard Shannon, Ben and his young son, lived in a three-bedroom terraced house in Bideford, Devon, with her mum and five siblings.\n\nThey slept on cushions from the sofa in the lounge with Ben\u2019s son by them in a travel cot and Lyla-Rae in a Moses basket.\n\nThe inquest heard she met Ben on the internet while she was pregnant and he moved into her mum\u2019s house in July 2018 with his son. They had been waiting for a private rental property to become available.\n\nShe told how, despite suffering with her own health during the pregnancy, Lyla-Rae was born healthy and was bottle fed and was doing well.\n\n(Image: Lewis Clarke)\n\nIt was also heard how Shannon and Ben were both smokers, but did not smoke in the house, and had smoked a joint of cannabis the evening before her death.\n\nA pediatric post mortem examination examination was carried out by Dr Andrew Bamber who concluded the cause of death was unascertained.\n\nHe told the inquest he could not rule out \u2018risk factors\u2019 such as accidental suffocation due to overlying, but there were plausible alternatives which could have contributed to her death.\n\nHe added there was evidence of a mild viral infection, but confirmed it would not have caused her death.\n\nDr Bamber said: \u201cWe are left with no definite reason why she passed away.\u201d\n\nWhen asked by the coroner how common it was for deaths in similar circumstances to be unascertained, he said: \u201cIn deaths of co-sleeping and sleeping in the same bed, somewhere in the region of 50 to 60 per cent won\u2019t find a specific reason.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an area being actively researched in lots of different places.\u201d\n\nPolice confirmed there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding her death and no evidence of neglect was found.", "description": "Lyla-Rae Ayres, described as a \"beautiful happy baby\", died at the home in Bideford, Devon", "authors": ["Anita Merritt", "Bradley Jolly", "Image", "Devon Live Ws", "Www.Devonlive.Com", "Lewis Clarke"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20637569.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Lyla-Rae-Ayres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
