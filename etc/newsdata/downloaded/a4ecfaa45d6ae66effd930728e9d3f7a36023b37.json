While the price tag on the pillow can appear steep, I have since learned that beauty sleep is priceless.\n\nWhat sets The Original Casper Pillow apart is its unique design. When you unzip the tube-packaged pillow, you will find another hidden inner pillow layer. This innovative \u201cpillow-in-pillow\u201d construction delivers the best of both worlds to satisfy any sleeper\u2019s taste, combining the feel of both a down pillow and a memory foam pillow. The inner pillow is supportive and firm, while the outer pillow adds a soft touch of fluff.\n\nCasper\u2019s product may contain two layers, but the brand\u2019s signature pillow is designed as a \u201cone size fits all\u201d bedroom product that adapts to any sleeping position. Created with nearly a billion coated fibers individually blown into the cover, the pillow seamlessly responds to your natural sleep movements. As a belly sleeper who tends to shift into side sleeping throughout the night, this pillow stands up to both positions with zero need to readjust or snag a second pillow in the middle of the night. This advanced coated fiber construction also makes the pillow resistant to clumping, meaning it can bounce back to life with just a quick fluff instead of losing it to a quick toss in the trash can.\n\nImportantly, the pillow is also designed with an intelligent gusset construction, meaning that the product has two inches along the sides that allow for better neck alignment (and your overall morning happiness when you wake up with full neck mobility). This construction also keeps the pillow\u2019s fill evenly distributed, so your fluff isn\u2019t concentrated on one side of it after a night\u2019s rest - no matter how often you move around.\n\nAs Casper claims, the Original Pillow is incredibly breezy and breathable. The 100% cotton cover features a percale weave that increases airflow, so both sides of the pillow are perpetually the cool side. Casper ensures that you won\u2019t have to flip over your pillow in the middle of the night to feel comfortable.\n\nWhile washing bedding - pillows, in particular - can feel intimidating, the Original Casper Pillow\u2019s double-layer is easy to clean. Simply unzip the outer pillow, and remove the inner pillow. Both parts go into your washing machine. The pillow also provides easy, clear instructions on how to properly fluff a pillow after a wash (or anytime you feel the pillow needs a little extra love).\n\nWhen I initially purchased the Original Casper Pillow, I knew I could always return the product with the brand\u2019s 100-day trial offer. Nine months, zero strained neck muscles, and completely increased productivity levels later, this pillow is still occupying its trusty spot on my bed and is the key to my personal beauty sleep. | Get it on Amazon >\n\nNEWSLETTERS The Scouted Newsletter Product recommendations that'll make your life better and tips to help you shop smarter.
