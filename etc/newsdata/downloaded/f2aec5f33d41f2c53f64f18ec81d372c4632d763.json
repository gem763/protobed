The terms of the SEIU agreement were not immediately available.\n\nOn Friday, officials had been more optimistic for children to be back in school after the weekend, with the leader of the Chicago Teachers Union saying he was hopeful the previous day's talks had given the path towards a settlement.\n\n\"Right now I\u2019m guardedly optimistic,\" President Jesse Sharkey told a news conference.\n\nStriking teachers rallied again later on Friday at Chicago's Buckingham Fountain, however.\n\nThe strike is the latest in a wave of teacher work stoppages across the United States, some of which, such as a six-day work stoppage last winter in Los Angeles, have involved similar demands for more school resources.\n\nIt has lasted longer than walkouts elsewhere, except for a three-week strike by teachers in Union City, California in June.\n\nPresident Donald Trump plans to be in Chicago on Monday for a speech and fundraiser for a grouping of international police chiefs that is expected to draw thousands of protesters as well as supporters, Politico and other media said.\n\nBut it was unclear how the planned protests and picket lines of the striking teachers would affect traffic and police resources.\n\nLightfoot, a political newcomer elected in April, faced her first major test after Chicago teachers voted to strike following the failure of contract talks to strike a deal on pay, class overcrowding and a lack of support staff.\n\nShe has said the district could not afford the union's full demands, estimating they would cost an extra $2.4 billion each year for an increase of more than 30% in the current $7.7-billion school budget.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Rich McKay in Atlanta; Additional reporting by Brendan O'Brien in Chicago; Editing by Clarence Fernandez)", "description": "Each side blamed the other for the impasse in the United States' third-largest school district, where the strike began on Oct. 17, and the union, which represents the city's 25,000 teachers, has been without a contract since July 1.
