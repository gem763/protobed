So this could have a really big impact if immigrants are not participating in the census in 2020.\"\n\nThe last time a question about citizenship was included in the census questionnaire for all U.S. households was 1950, although the question was asked only of people born outside the United States. Such a question is posed in the annual American Community Survey, which covers about 3.5 million people.\n\nCalifornia Attorney General Xavier Becerra said in a statement that the state will sue the Trump administration over its decision to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census.\n\n\"Having an accurate census count should be of the utmost importance for every Californian. The census numbers provide the backbone for planning how our communities can grow and thrive in the coming decade. California simply has too much to lose for us to allow the Trump Administration to botch this important decennial obligation. What the Trump Administration is requesting is not just alarming, it is an unconstitutional attempt to discourage an accurate census count.\"\n\nAnd, Democratic Rep. Grace Meng of New York issued a statement: \"I am deeply disappointed with Secretary Ross, and I will now look to introduce legislation to stop this question from being included on the census.\"\n\nAs Hansi reported in January, civil rights groups dispute the Justice Department's need for the data from a citizenship question to help enforce the Voting Rights Act.\n\nIn his memo, Ross rejected arguments that asking about citizenship will dampen the likelihood that undocumented residents will choose not to be counted for fear that their personal information could be used for law enforcement purposes.\n\n\"The reinstatement of a citizenship question will not decrease the response rate of residents who already decided not to respond. And no one provided evidence that there are residents who would respond accurately to a decennial census that did not contain a citizenship question but would not respond if it did (although many believed that such residents had to exist). While it is possible this belief is true, there is no information available to determine the number of people who would in fact not respond due to a citizenship question being added, and no one has identified any mechanism for making such a determination.\"\n\nHe concluded saying that in order to minimize an impact on census response rates, \"I am directing the Census Bureau to place the citizenship question last on the decennial census form.\"", "description": "Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross says the question will help the Justice Department enforce the Voting Rights Act.
