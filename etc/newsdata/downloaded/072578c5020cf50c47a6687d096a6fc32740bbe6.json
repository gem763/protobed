Just not the one you might expect.\n\nJohn Carlson had a goal and two assists, giving the defenseman 14 points, and the Capitals beat the Toronto Maple Leafs 4-3 Wednesday night for their first home win of the season.\n\n\u201cJust getting lucky I think,\u201d said Carlson, on pace to double his career high of 70 points from a season ago. \u201cGuys are making some good plays to me, and the guys I\u2019m passing to are scoring right now.\u201d\n\nCapitals teammate Alex Ovechkin, a three-time MVP who has paced the league in both points (2007-08) and goals (eight times) during his illustrious career, garners much of the attention on offense in Washington. But it\u2019s been Carlson at the forefront early this season. His 11 assists have come while the club awaits the return of Michael Kempny from offseason hamstring surgery.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s playing really well, and that\u2019s something that we talked about this summer with the departure of some other guys,\u201d coach Todd Reirden said. \u201cHe\u2019s been a big reason why we\u2019ve been able to get through this time without Kempny.\u201d\n\nNicklas Backstrom added a goal and an assist, and Jakub Vrana and Evgeny Kuznetsov also scored for Washington, which lost its first three home games for the first time since October 1983. Two of those defeats came in overtime.\n\nRookie goaltender Ilya Samsonov made 29 saves in his first home start to earn his third career win after going down 2-0 early. His last stop came as Washington killed off Carl Hagelin\u2019s third-period penalty for hooking.\n\n\u201cIt was a really good game for a young goaltender, because things probably didn\u2019t go exactly how he wanted in the first, and he made an adjustment,\u201d Reirden said. \u201cHe completely settled down and let pucks begin to start to hit him.\u201d\n\nKasperi Kapanen scored short-handed and assisted on Ilya Mikheyev\u2019s goal as Toronto grabbed the first-period lead. John Tavares scored late in the third to cut the deficit to 4-3.\n\nMichael Hutchinson stopped 28 shots in his second start for the Maple Leafs, who lost on the road for the first time this season. Toronto has given up 10 goals in two games played as the second of a back-to-back set.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is we\u2019ve got to do a better job of keeping it out of our net,\u201d coach Mike Babcock said. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing if they\u2019ve made a play that\u2019s unbelievable. But if you\u2019re not standing next to your guy, that\u2019s on you.\u201d\n\nToronto still led after the first intermission, but that turned into a 4-2 deficit during a 68-second stretch of the second period.\n\nFirst, Kuznetsov took Carlson\u2019s pass on the break, cut in from the left and wrapped a backhand around Hutchinson\u2019s left pad with 14:53 left in the period. Just 11 seconds following the restart, Backstrom\u2019s one-timer off T.J. Oshie\u2019s feed beat Hutchinson to give Washington the lead.\n\nWithin 30 seconds of that, Nicholas Shore and Codi Ceci both took minor penalties to give the Capitals a 5-on-3. And with 13:35 remaining in the period, Carlson scored off Ovechkin\u2019s feed for Washington\u2019s seventh power-play goal of the season.\n\n\u201cWhen other teams have gifted offensive players, they\u2019re going to have a push at some point in the game,\u201d Hutchinson said. \u201cIt\u2019s just unfortunate they were able to bury their chances on their push.\u201d\n\nUp next, the Capitals host the New York Rangers on Friday.\n\nNOTES: The Capitals lost D Jonas Siegenthaler (left shoulder) and RW Richard Panik (upper body) to injury following the second period. They will be evaluated Thursday. \u2026 The WNBA champion Washington Mystics were on hand. League MVP Elena Delle Donne dropped the ceremonial first puck prior to the game, and Mystics forward Aerial Powers rode on a Zamboni while toting the championship trophy during the first intermission. \u2026 Kapanen\u2019s short-handed goal was the first scored by the Maple Leafs and first allowed by the Capitals this season. \u2026 After scoring five goals in Toronto\u2019s first three games, Auston Matthews has gone without a point in three of his last five. He has seven goals overall.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "John Carlson had a goal and two assists, giving the defenseman 14 points, and the Capitals beat the Toronto Maple Leafs for their first home win of the season.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Ian Quillen"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/16/maple_leafs_capitals_hockey_47339_c0-64-1539-961_s1200x700.jpg?0e2c5b75e9614f452182d99494e6ad8ca0fa541d", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
