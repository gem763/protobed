But even his bongo playing and shimmying in a ruffled neon green blouse and tight-fitting white pants wasn\u2019t a big enough distraction from the casting controversy, viewers expressed.\n\nBefore the season even started, \u201cDancing with the Stars\u201d host Tom Bergeron condemned Spicer\u2019s casting saying that the show is meant to be a \u201cjoyful respite from our exhausting political climate\u201d and wants it \u201cfree of inevitable diverse bookings.\u201d\n\nSpicer, who accused the media of downplaying the size of President Trump\u2019s inauguration, defended his decision to join the show: \u201cI\u2019ve been living this for a while. I expect it,\u201d he told The Hollywood Reporter of the backlash. \u201cBut if people could tune in tonight and say, \u2018Look at this diverse cast. They\u2019re rooting for each other, they\u2019re having a blast with each other,\u2019 and we can, for two hours, put policy and policies aside, have fun, relax,\u2019 then that\u2019s what we should do more of.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpicer did not immediately return a FOX Business request for comment.\n\nIt didn't take long for the internet to spew out memes and judgemental tweets about Spicer's performance.\n\n\u201cClearly the Costume designer on #dwts is a Democrat. #Nicelydone,\u201d actress Nancy Lee Grahn tweeted.\n\nOthers, like comedian Samantha Bee, skewered: \u201cWe can\u2019t wait to see how flexible Sean Spicer is on Dancing with the Stars since he had his spine removed years ago.\u201d\n\nTrump, meanwhile, tweeted his support in August following the casting announcement: \u201cJust heard that Sean Spicer will be on \u2018Dancing with the Stars\u2019 He will do great. A terrific person who loves our Country dearly!\u201d", "description": "Sean Spicer's \"Dancing with the Stars\" performance was met with backlash by some critics.", "authors": ["Jeanette Settembre"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/sean-spicer-abc-1.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
