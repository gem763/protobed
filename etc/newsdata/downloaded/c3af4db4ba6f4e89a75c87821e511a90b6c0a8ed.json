She has fended off questions about when she might stand down so far, and she has asked to speak to representatives of her party\u2019s MPs on Thursday to explain herself.\n\nAs we report today, Sir Graham Brady, the genial figure struggling to be impartial at the head of the mob with the pitchforks, said: \u201cWe have asked a question. She\u2019s coming, I assume, to answer it.\u201d\n\nIt is true that the prime minister has handled the central task of her administration badly. So much so that Donald Tusk, the president of the European Union, said this week there was a 30 per cent chance of Brexit not happening. Yesterday, Guy Verhofstadt, the European parliament Brexit coordinator, said \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d when asked if the UK would actually leave.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nIt might be argued, then, that The Independent should support the prime minister and encourage her in her excellent work in failing to take Britain out of the EU. However, as there is no evidence that an alternative Conservative leader could do a more effective job in delivering Brexit, there is no pressing need to take a view \u2013 except to point out that a leadership contest now would be a distraction from the real issues facing the country.\n\nBrexit is obviously important, but it seems clearer now that the only way it will be resolved is through a fresh referendum. This is no longer a matter of supporters of EU membership, such as The Independent, trying to frustrate Brexit. The Leave movement has crashed its own project. By failing to unite behind the prime minister\u2019s withdrawal agreement it has prevented the UK from leaving.\n\nThere is no majority either in parliament or in the country for a no-deal Brexit, which is what the candidates in a Conservative leadership contest are likely to advocate. Therefore, it seems that a majority in the House of Commons must eventually come round, one way or another, to giving the people a final say on the Brexit question.\n\nIt is encouraging that David Lidington, the prime minister\u2019s deputy, appears to have given some thought to the practicalities of a referendum, as we also report today.\n\nMeanwhile, there are more urgent issues for the government to address, and The Independent is constantly trying to draw attention to them. Climate change; housing; the health service, including mental health care and care of the elderly; and prisons. All of these need sustained, creative ministerial attention; and instead they have all benefited from fitful fine words and piecemeal good intentions.\n\nAnd what have we heard from the candidates to succeed Ms May? A penny off the rate of income tax from Dominic Raab and bluff and bluster from The Daily Telegraph\u2019s well-paid colour writer.\n\nA Conservative leadership contest is not the answer to the country\u2019s problems. Theresa May might as well stay in office and use her remaining time to make a late start, at least, on tackling the real burning injustices of which she once spoke so well.", "description": "The more the Conservative Party obsesses over Theresa May\u2019s future, the more it seems to be focusing on the wrong issue.
