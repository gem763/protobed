So that\u2019s one theory.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I mean, I was smoking and doing a lot of drugs and a lot of everything. But at the same time, my lungs are totally clear. This is just my own theory, but the doctors say it\u2019s possible.\u2019\n\nHowever, Eddie has yet to comment on the reports made by multiple outlets.\n\nVan Halen released their self-titled album in 1978 and proceeded to become one of the biggest rockbands in the \u201980s.\n\nThey were best known for Jump and Why Can\u2019t This Be Love.\n\nMetro.co.uk have contacted reps of Eddie for comment.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
