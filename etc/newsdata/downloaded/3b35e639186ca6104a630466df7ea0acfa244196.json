Eisenhower, Ronald Reagan and the Bush family. Then Donald Trump, a political idiosyncrasy running as a Republican, blew up the right-wing takeover.\n\nToday we have a more relevant story line: The Democratic Party of Woodrow Wilson, FDR, JFK, Bill Clinton\u2014even Barack Obama \u2014is being taken over by the far left.\n\nUnlike the presumed capture of the Republicans by a mishmash of disorganized groups and intellectuals, the Democrats today are making the public\u2019s perception of their party easier by defining themselves from now until Election Day with their treatment of one person\u2014 Brett Kavanaugh. \u200b\u200b\n\nWithin hours of publication of the New York Times\u2019s tissue-thin piece on Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s years at Yale, a succession of Democratic presidential candidates posted denunciations on social media.\n\nElizabeth Warren: \u201cLike the man who appointed him, Kavanaugh should be impeached.\u201d\n\nKamala Harris: \u201cHe must be impeached.\u201d\n\nBeto O\u2019Rourke: \u201cHe should be impeached.\u201d\n\nJuli\u00e1n Castro: \u201cHe should be impeached.\u201d\n\nBernie Sanders: \u201cI support any appropriate constitutional mechanism to hold him accountable.\u201d\n\nImpeachment, until now, has been a grave step in the American political process. But impeachment has become like popcorn for Democrats. They can\u2019t get enough of it.\n\nThis extraordinary exercise in instantaneous groupthink by so many of the party\u2019s presidential candidates is disturbing. There are several ways to interpret it, and the first requires diving to untouched depths of cynicism.\n\nBy midevening Sunday, the Times had issued a clarification of the original piece by two of the paper\u2019s staff writers, Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly. In what now appears to be an editing fiasco of historic proportions (almost on a scale with the Washington Post\u2019s epic and must-read correction of a recent piece about racism in the paper\u2019s food section), the Times acknowledged that the woman involved in the purported Kavanuagh episode \u201cdeclined to be interviewed and friends say that she does not recall the incident.\u201d\n\nBut Democrats seem to live in a political world now whose standard of proof for judicial confirmations or any public- policy proposal is \u201cwhatever.\u201d On Monday morning, well after the Times\u2019s clarification of the original piece, the Harris campaign sent out an email grinding through \u201cBrett Kavanaugh\u2019s illegitimate nomination.\u201d Then it asked for money: \u201cCan you add a contribution of any amount to Kamala\u2019s campaign?\u201d The short distance from moral high horse to money grovel is breathtaking.\n\nAbout 3 p.m., Mr. Castro asked the people on his email distribution list to sign a self-promoting \u201cemergency petition calling for Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s removal.\u201d\n\nStill, something more serious than back-alley political cynicism is reflected in the statements from these Democratic presidential candidates. An issue raised by the entire Kavanaugh process is whether the Democratic Party as defined by its current generation of party activists is willing to conduct politics outside any conceivable definition of acceptable behavior.\n\nJustice Kavanaugh was confirmed by a Senate vote nearly a year ago after a hearing process of unprecedented political bitterness. This New York Times article and the piling on by five Democratic presidential candidates amount to a ritualistic stoning of Brett Kavanaugh. If the established system doesn\u2019t go their way, they\u2019ll conduct politics outside the system. Whatever it takes.\n\nThe day after Donald Trump\u2019s victory in 2016, left-wing activists took over streets throughout Manhattan and shut down commuter traffic. It always struck me as a telling event, insofar as most of the New York workers these activists were shafting voted for Hillary Clinton. But their point was clear: We\u2019ll disrupt and even smash the system when we want to. This is becoming the ethos\u2014a politics without norms or boundaries\u2014that now defines the Democratic Party.\n\nAn argument against such a dire interpretation is that the activists\u2019 anything-goes politics is precisely what is at stake in the struggle between the party\u2019s left and \u201cmoderates\u201d such as Joe Biden and Amy Klobuchar. I\u2019m not sure I believe that now, and the reason is Minnesota\u2019s Sen. Klobuchar.\n\nAfter the Times piece appeared Saturday and her fellow candidates outputted their serial impeachment demands, Ms. Klobuchar somehow felt compelled to say the Kavanaugh confirmation \u201cprocess was a sham.\u201d This from a candidate who has tried, like Mr. Biden, to present herself as the adult in the room. That Ms. Klobuchar caved says a lot about the requirements of party membership now.\n\nIt raises the question of how real the whole \u201cmoderate\u201d Democratic phenomenon is, or whether Ms. Warren has accurately identified the party\u2019s near-term future\u2014progressivism without nuance or quarter.\n\nIf Mr. Biden somehow got elected, the pressure from the far left to conform his administration\u2019s policy to its agenda would be overwhelming and relentless. That\u2019s the lesson of the Kavanaugh stoning. Today Brett Kavanaugh, tomorrow whoever gets in the way, including a moderate Democratic president.\n\nWrite henninger@wsj.com.", "description": "If Joe Biden wins, the left will use the same tactics against his presidency.", "authors": ["Daniel Henninger", "Dan.Henninger Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/ED-AY984A_WL091_SOC_20190918153559.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
