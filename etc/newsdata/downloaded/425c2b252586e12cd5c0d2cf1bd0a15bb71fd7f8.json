Last week, pilots and its airline customers left a Federal Aviation Administration meeting with no idea when the grounded model would fly again. \u201cWe\u2019ve taken off our watches and put the calendars in the drawer,\u201d American Airlines pilot Dennis Tajer said after the meeting.\n\nWhat\u2019s taking so long?\n\nFixing software, it turns out, is no easy task. \u201cAny time you change software code, it\u2019s a major issue,\u2019\u2019 said Clint Balog, an Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University professor who studies the interaction between humans and computers in planes. \u201cIf you change even one small thing in a code, it can have downstream implications.\u2019\u2019\n\nIn a video message Wednesday night, Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg said the company had finished its last test flight and was prepared to move forward with certification. The goal, he said, is to make the 737 Max \u201cone of the safest airplanes ever to fly.\u2019\u2019\n\nHis company needs to convince the now heavily scrutinised FAA - as well as skeptical international regulators - that the fix is safe and capable of being used in the Max 8 without requiring costly flight-simulator training for pilots, as the company has promised customers. That could prove tricky in the current environment, said Richard Aboulafia, an aircraft consultant and vice president at Teal Group in Fairfax, Virginia.\n\n\u201cI suspect the time spent so far is less about creating optimal software and more about proving to regulators that it\u2019s OK,\u2019\u2019 Aboulafia said. The tradition of non-US aircraft regulators deferring to the FAA\u2019s judgment calls is \u201changing by a thread. The system now has many agencies who are determined to show that they have independent oversight.\u2019\u2019\n\nCracks are already showing. On Wednesday, a day after an FAA-appointed pilot board\u2019s recommended that the US not mandate simulator training for the Max 8, Canada\u2019s transport minister said the training should be required no matter how long the planes remain grounded.\n\nComplicating Boeing\u2019s task is the increasingly complex interplay between artificial intelligence, hardware and humans, aerospace and computer experts say.\n\nSoftware engineers need to ferret out ripple effects and unintended consequences, said Eric Feron, an aerospace software engineer at the Georgia Institute of Technology. \u201cYou have to look at the way the human is going to operate the plane. You have to consider the interactions with hardware, and other software,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cWe want to be sure, if we can be sure, that we have no negative interactions between software systems.\u2019\u2019\n\nMCAS proved vulnerable to those kinds of interactions. It relied on data from just one piece of hardware - a sensor that malfunctioned - before putting a plane into a dive that pilots didn\u2019t see coming.\n\nAI expanding\n\nThe use of software, artificial intelligence and automation systems continues to expand, not only to fly planes but to drive cars (and even decide who gets parole or a mortgage). When designed well, such systems can prevent fatigue and help humans make better decisions.\n\nRisks emerge when they aren\u2019t designed to manage the back-and-forth between human and machine, particularly when automation changes in ways the user doesn\u2019t expect. In the case of the Max 8, pilots initially weren\u2019t told the MCAS existed.\n\n\u201cHuman-AI teams perform better than either alone, but when the AI is updated its behaviour may violate human expectations,\u201d according to a January paper published by researchers at Microsoft., the University of Washington and the University of Michigan. \u201cThe system can\u2019t be the same and also have a new button,\u201d said Walter Lasecki, a University of Michigan professor and one of the study\u2019s co-authors. \u201cIf you add a new button, you have to teach people how to use it.\u201d\n\nBalog, the Embry-Riddle professor, said aircraft automation introduces complications such as complacency, with pilots relying too much on computers, as well as a lack of transparency, where pilots don\u2019t know what the computers are doing or why.\n\n\u201cI believe in the pilot understanding what is going on in the cockpit,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nSoftware distrust\n\nMany pilots distrust software, said John Barton, who flies the Max for a major airline. \u201cSoftware by definition gets in between pilots and the airplane,\u2019\u2019 he said in an email. \u201cMost pilots would prefer to fly the airplane mechanically, where we can feel what\u2019s actually going on with the flight controls and with the airplane.\u2019\u2019\n\nUnlike rival Airbus, Boeing has preferred to give pilots, not automation, the final word on flying its planes. The MCAS software on its Max 8 was an exception.\n\nAccording to Boeing, the software helped the Max 8 handle like earlier 737s. With a bigger engine, positioned differently, the Max 8 nose can tilt up more than pilots expect, risking a stall. The MCAS system was designed to push it back down automatically. That proved disastrous when malfunctioning sensors on the Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines flights incorrectly assumed the plane was aimed so high it was in danger of stalling, and pointed it down. The resulting crashes killed a total of 346 people.\n\nThe 737 Max should have been grounded after the first crash, said Tom Demetrio, a Chicago lawyer who is suing Boeing on behalf of Lion Air families. \u201cThat was the time to tell airlines, do not fly this plane until you hear from us that we know the cause and the cause has been corrected,\u201d he said.\n\nBoeing has said it began working on its software fix immediately, but that the work proved more complicated than initially thought, since the software hovers in the background of critical flight controls.\n\nBut some Boeing critics said the company might have moved faster if the first crash hadn\u2019t involved Lion Air, a young airline with a history of maintenance and other troubles. \u201cThere were just so many factors that contributed with Lion Air,\u201d said Hans Weber, an aerospace engineer with FAA experience.\n\nWorking for months\n\nThen came the March 10 disaster, which involved widely respected Ethiopian Airlines. Two days later, Boeing\u2019s Muilenburg said the company had been working for months on \u201csoftware enhancements\u2019\u2019 designed to \u201cmake an already safe aircraft even safer.\u2019\u2019 On March 13, the U.S. joined the rest of the world in grounding the Max 8.\n\nTwo weeks after that, Boeing unveiled its software fix to hundreds of pilots and airline executives in Seattle, saying the company would submit it to the FAA by month\u2019s end, a timeline the company walked back within days.\n\nIn his video message Wednesday night, Muilenberg said the company had completed 120 test flights, spending 203 hours in the air checking the reworked system.\n\nThe updated software will assess readings from two sensors, turn itself off if they don\u2019t agree and nudge the plane\u2019s nose down if they do. To test the new system and convince regulators, the company ran computer models subjecting the fix to multiple speeds, angles and potential human or machine failures in the lab, in simulators and in a jet outfitted with flight-test equipment.\n\nTo Weber and Teal Group\u2019s Aboulafia, the fix only highlights the original software\u2019s flaws.\n\n\u201cIn retrospect,\u2019\u2019 Aboulafia said, \u201cthere were some bad calls.\u2019\u2019", "description": "In the days after a Boeing's 737 Max 8 jet plunged into Indonesia\u2019s Java Sea last October, company officials said they were moving quickly to update plane software suspected in the crash.
