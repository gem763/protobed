Given that Quake 2 has already gotten the ray-traced treatment, another game that would make sense would be Doom 3 or another iD tech title like the original Quake. But something like Unreal or Unreal Tournament 99 would be fantastic.\n\nAlternatively, I'd absolutely fire up Battlefield 1942 again just to see what it was like with ray-tracing. Or Enemy Territory: Quake Wars, if anyone wants to bring that game back. (Dear Bethesda: just bring Quake Wars back anyway.)\n\nIf you are the kind of person who has the requisite experience, you can put your hand up over here. The listing asks for a lot of AAA experience, which probably goes against a lot of Australians given the nature of local game development.\n\nBut let's fantasy remaster for a second. What would you bring back if you just wanted to remaster a game to show off fancy new lighting? Thief: The Dark Project? Deus Ex?", "description": "Minecraft creators are having a blast with their fancy new ray-traced reflections and lighting, but there are plenty more classics that would be well served with a fresh coat of RTX-powered paint.
