It\u2019s also Snoop Dogg, why WOULDN\u2019T he have a professional blunt roller?\n\nThe news broke in a recent episode of Howard Stern\u2019s radio show, where Snoop and fellow weed-smoker Seth Rogen were discussing the topic.\n\nSnoop Dogg revealed that the employee makes a whopping $40,000-$50,000, which equates to $58,557-$73,197 AUD. For context, the minimum wage in Australia is approximately $38,000, so this lucky employee is getting paid pretty comfortably.\n\nHonestly, the lucky staffer is living the dream. Snoop elaborated on the employment situation, stating that the employee gets free marijuana for himself, as well as other perks like free clothes that Snoop receives. Obviously, I\u2019m not condoning smoking weed in Australia because it\u2019s still a crime, but if you live in America, the blunt-rolling game sounds pretty damn lucrative.\n\nThe rapper also complimented his employee on his exceptional blunt-rolling skills. Snoop said the employee gives him precisely rolled blunts whenever he needs one, which I\u2019d assume is quite often.\n\n\u201cThat motherfucker is like Lurch from the Addams Family. \u2018You rang?\u2019\u201d Snoop said. \u201cThat motherfucker\u2019s timing is impeccable.\u201d\n\nHoward Stern, who likely doesn\u2019t employee his own full-time blunt roller, questioned Snoop on the employment.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s his J-O-B \u2014 his occupation,\u201d Snoop said. \u201cOn his resume, it says, \u2018what do you do? I\u2019m a blunt roller. P-B-R, professional blunt roller.\u201d\n\nSnoop has previously claimed he smokes up to 81 joints per day in a 2012 Reddit AMA interview, so it\u2019s probably worth his while to pay someone to roll them on his behalf.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re great at something I need, I\u2019m hiring you,\u201d the artist said.", "description": "Rap icon Snoop Dogg has revealed in a Howard Stern interview that he employs a full-time blunt roller for his marijuana habits.", "authors": ["Lavender Baj"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1179454673.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
