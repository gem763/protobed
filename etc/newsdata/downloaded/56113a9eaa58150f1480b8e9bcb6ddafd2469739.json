He warned that a \u201chealthy amount of skepticism\u201d is necessary when dealing with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\n\u201cThey did that with the president on a couple of occasions, to persuade him that \u2018we\u2019re the good guys, they\u2019re the bad guys,\u2019\u201d Tillerson said at a panel discussion Tuesday at Harvard University.\n\n\u201cWe later exposed it to the president so he understood: \u2018You\u2019ve been played,\u2019\u201d Tillerson added. \u201cIt bothers me that an ally that\u2019s that close and important to us would do that to us.\u201d\n\nTillerson did not detail specific situations when he believed the president was \u201cplayed.\u201d\n\nIn \u201cdealing with Bibi, it\u2019s always useful to carry a healthy amount of skepticism in your discussions with him,\u201d said Tillerson, who was fired by Trump via tweet last year. He described Netanyahu as \u201can extraordinarily skilled\u201d politician and diplomat, but also called him \u201ca bit Machiavellian.\u201d\n\nTillerson said he supported a two-state solution involving Palestinians, which Netanyahu opposes.\n\n\u201cI did believe that we were at a moment in time where perhaps we could chart a way where the Arab world could support an outcome that the Palestinians might not think was perfect ... but with enough encouragement, pressure from the Arab world, that we could get it close enough that the Palestinians would finally agree,\u201d he said. \u201cIn my view, it was a two-state solution.\u201d\n\nBut Tillerson said his plans were thwarted when Trump put his son-in-law Jared Kushner in charge of drafting a Middle East peace plan.\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s office tweeted in response to Tillerson\u2019s revelations that Israel \u201cis the good guy.\u201d\n\nSecretary Tillerson, Israel *is* the good guy. pic.twitter.com/rgaVgQgWi9 \u2014 PM of Israel (@IsraeliPM) September 19, 2019\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s future is uncertain after rival Benny Gantz declared victory on Thursday, following close parliamentary election results in Israel.\n\nTillerson also weighed in on the attack of Saudi Arabian oil facilities last weekend, saying, \u201cI have no doubt we\u2019re going to find Iran\u2019s fingerprints on this attack, but we may not find their hands on it.\u201d\n\nHe cautioned that Iran\u2019s involvement will be difficult to prove, and said that the U.S. should take its case to the United Nations Security Council to forge an international coalition of sanctions, rather than imposing unilateral penalties, which, he said, Iran can handle.\n\nTillerson also explained his very un-Trump-like view of negotiating: \u201cEvery successful negotiation is defined as both parties leaving with an acceptable outcome. If you ever think about a negotiation as a win/lose, you\u2019re going to have a terrible experience, you\u2019re going to be very dissatisfied, and not very many people are going to want to deal with you.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery successful negotiation is defined as both parties leaving w an acceptable outcome. If you ever think about a negotiation as a win/lose, not very many people are going to want to deal w you,\u201dsaid fmr Secretary Tillerson @Harvard.
