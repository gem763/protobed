And none of them turned out to be true\n\nWhy Eric Reid wasn\u2019t playing football at the start of 2018 was as obvious to his detractors as anyone. But with each passing week, with each snap, with each dynamic swoop to close on a quarterback or break up a pass, that eight-month stretch out of the NFL takes on a darker, more sinister tone.\n\nTo recap, Reid knelt alongside his friend Colin Kaepernick in 2016 when they played together at the San Francisco 49ers. And, just like Kaepernick, he soon found himself without a job despite being a solid pro and in the prime years of his career. Detractors hit Reid with the same nonsense that they used to justify Kaepernick\u2019s exile. A rebuke of his political beliefs dressed up as football commentary: he couldn\u2019t find a team because he wasn\u2019t very good; players of his type, at his position, were dying out; he would be a distraction.\n\nUnlike Kaepernick Reid eventually found a team willing to take him on \u2013 he signed for the Carolina Panthers four months after filing a grievance against the NFL alleging teams colluded to keep him out of the league. Reid plays at safety and teams want linebacker-safety hybrids, guys who are comfortable playing the run and turning and running in coverage. Reid is the prototype.\n\nAnd, in some ways, Reid has been a distraction. He speaks freely and openly about politics, and continues to kneel for the anthem. He has accused \u2013 with some justification \u2013 the NFL of singling him out for drug tests. He has got into a pre-game scuffle with another player campaigning for social justice, Malcolm Jenkins.\n\nAnd guess what: Reid\u2019s on-field play continues to make a mockery of fears about those distractions. He is one of the five most impactful, consistent defenders on one of the top-10 defenses in the league. Through four weeks of the 2019 season he has played 100% of the team\u2019s defensive snaps. His head coach, Ron Rivera, one of the sharpest defensive minds in the league, has built a defensive scheme with Reid as one of its tentpoles \u2013 he is as important as the team\u2019s other defensive stars, Luke Kuechly, James Bradberry and Gerald McCoy.\n\nAnd, besides, are Reid\u2019s storylines any more of a distraction than the Panthers\u2019 run on a behind-the-scenes documentary? Or star quarterback Cam Newton\u2019s new vegan diet? Or whether this is Newton\u2019s last year in Charlotte or not?\n\nSunday saw Reid\u2019s best performance of the season so far, his best since his return. He rattled Texans quarterback Deshaun Watson physically and mentally. Reid was here there and everywhere, in coverage and in the backfield. He finished the game with a tackle for a loss, a fumble recovery, and a sack.\n\nThe Checkdown (@thecheckdown) Eric Reid brought the pressure and came up with the fumble recovery \ud83d\udcaa @E_Reid35 pic.twitter.com/SM7m8Moxeb\n\nReid was forced to play a pair of quarters on Sunday. He left the stadium in a walking boot. He hobbled from play to play, with an obvious, pronounced limp. \u201cIt would have been easy for him not to go back into the game but he gutted it out,\u201d Rivera said post-game. \u201cThat\u2019s the kind of young man he is.\u201d\n\nReid wanted to play football and to help people. For that, he was shunned, ostracized. Now, given an opportunity to play, he has thrived. And his play serves as a snap-to-snap reminder of that period in league history when teams chose cowardice over what was right and just \u2013 and good for them.\n\nStat of the week\n\nAt half time of the Bears-Vikings game, Chicago\u2019s backup quarterback Chase Daniel was 16/21 passing, with 138 yards and a touchdown. That\u2019s more passing yards than Mitchell Trubisky has had in seven of his 29 career starts. The Bears have a Trubisky problem and it\u2019s time to admit it.\n\nChicago have the best defense in the league, by a pretty decent distance. Historically, defensive performance varies year-to-year. If you stumble upon a franchise quarterback, you have a good offense for a decade, but keeping a great defense together is hard: free agency, injuries, and age all sap a unit of its talent. That\u2019s not the case in Chicago though \u2013 they were the top unit in the NFL last year and have somehow improved.\n\nNot cashing in on this window would be a crime. The pride of a GM \u2013 and the organization as a whole, who traded up to get Trubisky in a draft that also contained Patrick Mahomes and Deshaun Watson \u2013 cannot cost the team a legitimate shot at a Super Bowl.\n\nMVP of the week\n\nMinshew Mania is here to stay. Gardner Minshew inspired the Jaguars to their come from behind victory on the road in Denver with his patented blend of machismo and swagger and odd, off-script playmaking. I mean, what even is this?\n\nSportsCenter (@SportsCenter) WHAT CAN'T GARDNER MINSHEW DO \ud83d\ude31#JAXvsDEN (via @thecheckdown)pic.twitter.com/FYJpoRemZm\n\nThe NFL\u2019s Next Gen stats system paints an even more bonkers portrait:\n\nNext Gen Stats (@NextGenStats) Gardner Minshew evaded three Broncos defenders to find Ryquell Armstead in the end zone for a 7-yard touchdown.\n\n\n\nMinshew held on to the ball for 7.51 seconds, the longest time to throw on a TD pass this season.#JAXvsDEN | #DUUUVAL pic.twitter.com/1qiS9Y7XSg\n\nMinshew finished the day 19/33 passing for 213 yards, two touchdowns, and no interceptions. Leonard Fournette and the Jaguars defense played well too (Fournette had the best game of his career), but it was Minshew\u2019s fearlessness that eventually wore down the Broncos defense and got the Jags over the line. Minshew continues to defy his pre-draft expectations: he\u2019s an instant star.\n\nQuote of the week\n\n\u201cNot all of Mozart\u2019s paintings were perfect\u201d \u2013 Chiefs coach Andy Reid following the team\u2019s 34-30 win over the Lions in Detroit.\n\nThere has never been a better distillation of what it means to be a \u2018football guy\u2019. Reid doesn\u2019t know nor care if Mozart was a painter, decorator, composer or bank robber. Tell him tonight and he\u2019ll forget by tomorrow. Unless Mozart can do a job on special teams \u2013 unlikely \u2013 Reid\u2019s not interested.\n\nVideo of the week\n\nVontaze Burfict\u2019s hit on a defenseless Jack Doyle was barbaric:\n\nFootball Is Life (@FootbaIl_Tweets) Raiders LB Vontaze Burfict has been ejected for this hit \ud83e\udd10 pic.twitter.com/Gdx4xMp3Uf\n\nBurfict\u2019s play, dating back to his days in college and through his pro career in Cincinnati and Oakland ranks among the dirtiest of any sports figure anywhere at any time. He isn\u2019t looking to tackle opponents, he\u2019s looking to do serious harm.\n\nThe NFL has enabled Burfict long enough, we are only a week removed from Burfict randomly punching players at the end of a play. His career with the Bengals was marred with grizzly hits and cowardly acts. Cincy finally had enough. Oakland decided to reward his actions with a fat free-agent deal and a team captaincy. It\u2019s time for the league to step in and levy a long-term ban.\n\nElsewhere around the league\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Bears\u2019 1936 uniforms caught the eye this weekend. Photograph: Matt Marton/AP\n\n- The Dallas Cowboys lost their unbeaten record with a 12-10 lost to the Saints in New Orleans. Teddy Bridgewater, in for the injured Drew Brees, hasn\u2019t exactly shone at quarterback for the Saints but he has won both his games as the temporary starter. He was also, correctly, quick to thank his defense and the team\u2019s excellent kicker, Wil Lutz, who was successful on all four of his field goals.\n\n- Your Defensive Player of the Year through a quarter of the season: Tampa Bay\u2019s Shaquil Barrett. Barrett is the first player since sacks were officially recorded in 1982 to have at least eight sacks (!) and one interception in his team\u2019s first four games of a season. Barrett was a former rotational rusher with the Broncos who would flash in short stints but racked up most of his production against back-ups and weaker offensive lineman. A move to Tampa, where he\u2019s now an every-down player, has allowed him to fulfill his potential.\n\n- Jared Goff may have produced the least inspiring 500-yard performance in NFL history. The Bears clearly have a quarterback problem, and the Rams may have one too. Since 2017, when Goff entered the league, only two other quarterbacks \u2013 Jameis Winston and Kirk Cousins \u2013 have turned the ball over more. Goff has coughed up 49 turnovers over his career, and has fumbled 14 times in his last 13 games. That\u2019s not exactly the production you want from a QB making in excess of $110m guaranteed over the next four years.\n\n- Dan Quinn\u2019s job is in danger after another lackluster performance from the Falcons. Slow starts on offense and a leaky defense have become hallmarks of the Quinn era. Who\u2019s excited for Jay Gruden v Quinn in the inaugural XFL Bowl? Count me in.\n\n- Larry Fitzgerald passed Tony Gonzalez as the second all-time leader in receptions in NFL history during the Cardinals\u2019 loss to the Seahawks. The Hall of Fame awaits.\n\n- Austin Ekeler finished his month as the Chargers\u2019 starting running back with 490 yards from scrimmage and six touchdowns. Melvin Gordon hasn\u2019t topped those figures over a four-week span at any time during his first three seasons as a pro. Gordon\u2019s holdout was so ineffective that it feels almost mean to mention it.\n\n- The Bears\u2019 1936 inspired throwback uniforms were beautiful. There should be a nationwide movement to lobby the team to make them their full-time getups. The story behind them is even more interesting. The uniform was used to address one of the darkest periods in the team\u2019s \u2013 and league\u2019s \u2013 history: that the NFL was a segregated, all-white league in 1936, thanks to a 12-year ban on black players that ran from 1934 through 1945. That means the black players currently on the Bears roster were the first ever permitted to wear the uniform on the field.", "description": "The usual excuses were trotted out when Colin Kaepernick\u2019s fellow protestor found himself out of a job.
