Brown played in 81.7 percent of the Eagles\u2019 defensive snaps on Sunday and graded out as the team\u2019s fourth-worst starter, per PFF.\n\nZach Brown has had better weeks.

With Nigel Bradham dealing with an ankle injury, the Eagles\u2019 healthy linebackers are Nate Gerry, Kamu Grugier-Hill, T.J. Edwards and Duke Riley.\n\nStory continues\n\nThrough six games with the Eagles, Brown posted 29 total tackles, two tackles for loss and two passes defended. Even though Brown had a rough game against the Vikings, he\u2019s still a starting-quality inside linebacker, something many teams can use.\n\nPer ESPN\u2019s Adam Schefter, Brown figures to have multiple teams interested in his services as a free agent. Just don\u2019t expect the Vikings to be one of them.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Zach Brown called out Kirk Cousins ahead of Sunday's Eagles-Vikings game.
