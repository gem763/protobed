REUTERS/Mike Segar/Files\n\nIndividual and business customers will be charged a rate of -0.75% on cash balances above 2 million Swiss francs ($2.02 million), Switzerland\u2019s second biggest lender said. Balances of less than 2 million francs will be unaffected.\n\nA rate of -0.85% will be imposed on business customers with balances above 10 million francs.\n\nThe new rules take effect from Jan. 1 for individual customers and Nov. 15 for business customers.\n\nCredit Suisse\u2019s cross-town rival UBS (UBSG.S) in July said it would charge a -0.75% rate on deposits above 2 million francs, while Postfinance charges fees to private customers with balances above 500,000 francs.\n\nSeveral banks in Switzerland, including private bank Julius Baer (BAER.S), and the eurozone also pass on the cost of negative official rates to corporate depositors, though most large players have refrained from doing so with individual clients.\n\n\u201cAs other banks have been doing for some time, Credit Suisse is introducing negative interest rates for clients with very high Swiss franc cash holdings,\u201d Credit Suisse said on Friday.\n\n\u201cThe reason for this is the persistent negative interest rate environment.\u201d\n\nThe Swiss National Bank (SNB) has charged a negative rate of -0.75% since January 2015 on deposits parked with the central bank by commercial banks overnight, one of the tools the SNB uses to deter investor appetite for the Swiss franc.\n\nMany economists expect the SNB to take the interest rate lower next year to prevent further strengthening of the safe-haven currency, which could damage Switzerland\u2019s export-reliant economy.", "description": "Credit Suisse will start charging wealthy clients with large cash deposits in Swiss francs, the latest Swiss bank to pass on negative interest rates to customers.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191018&t=2&i=1442193351&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9H0GO", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
