Ben Cardin (D-Md.) said in a statement. \u201cI am deeply saddened by his passing, and my prayers today are with his family and loved ones \u2014 and the people of Baltimore.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe death of Chairman Cummings leaves an irreplaceable void in our hearts, in our Maryland and in our Congress. Quite possibly no elected official mattered so much to his constituents. Chairman Cummings guaranteed a voice to so many who would otherwise not have one, and stood as a symbol for the heights one could reach if they paid no mind to obstacles, naysayers and hate. His commitment to his city and country was unwavering, as will be my lasting respect for him.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMy heart is heavy this morning hearing of @RepCummings passing. He was a leader, innovator, and chairman truly #ForThePeople. My deepest condolences to his wife and family during this difficult time. #RestInPower \ud83d\udd4a\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe pic.twitter.com/DwRdX1Xmnw \u2014 Brenda Lawrence (@RepLawrence) October 17, 2019\n\n\u201cWhen our nation can ill-afford to lose such a kind, principled leader, one of my dearest friends and mentors has left us,\u201d Rep.

Cummings always gave reporters respect and time. He was a very nice man. To say he\u2019ll be missed by Rs and Ds is a massive understatement. https://t.co/sK5AFpyZ2h \u2014 Jake Sherman (@JakeSherman) October 17, 2019\n\nI am deeply saddened to learn of the passing of my friend and colleague @RepCummings.
