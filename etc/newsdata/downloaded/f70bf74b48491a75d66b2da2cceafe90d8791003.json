Barr, left, could help with the inquiries Trump sought. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nJustice Department officials took less than a month to abandon an inquiry into President Trump\u2019s communications with his Ukrainian counterpart about investigating former vice president Joe Biden \u2014 reigniting concerns among Democrats and legal observers that the law enforcement agency is serving as a shield for the commander in chief.\n\nJust weeks after intelligence leaders asked the Justice Department and FBI to consider examining a summer phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, the head of the department\u2019s criminal division determined there was not sufficient cause to even launch an investigation, senior Justice Department officials said.\n\n[The full Trump-Ukraine timeline \u2014 as of now]\n\nDepartment officials and career public integrity prosecutors reviewed a rough transcript of the call and verified its authenticity, but \u2014 because a case was not opened \u2014 took no other steps, such as conducting interviews, the officials said. They looked only at whether Trump might have violated campaign finance laws, not federal corruption statutes, even though some legal analysts said there seemed to be evidence of both.\n\nRepeatedly in the July 25 phone call, Trump pressed Zelensky to launch an investigation into Biden and his son, and to greenlight another inquiry into the origins of the special counsel probe that once dogged Trump\u2019s presidency, according to a rough transcript released by the administration Wednesday. He interspersed his demands with casual references to help that the U.S. government had given Ukraine, and a vague promise of how Zelensky might one day be able to meet Trump at the White House, the document shows.\n\nTrump also mentioned that his attorney general, William P. Barr, and his personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, could aid the inquiries he wanted.\n\n\n\nOfficials say that Barr wasn\u2019t involved in the decision to not investigate President Trump\u2019s phone call. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nLegal analysts said that was suggestive not only that Trump was seeking a contribution from a foreigner \u2014 which would violate campaign finance laws \u2014 but that he also seemed to hint at a corrupt bargain in which Zelensky would get a White House meeting or other help in exchange for digging up dirt on Trump\u2019s political foe.\n\n\u201cI was really startled that they put this out there with the spin that they thought it was somehow exculpatory,\u201d said Randall Eliason, a former federal prosecutor in Washington. \u201cWhen I look at it, I\u2019m like, \u2018Holy cow.\u2019 \u201d\n\n[Some Senate Republicans stunned, question White House\u2019s judgment after release]\n\nSenior Justice Department officials defended their handling of the matter, saying that campaign finance laws required them to \u201cquantify\u201d the value of what Trump was seeking for his campaign, and that was impossible to do with the investigations Trump had requested. They said they were examining what was referred, and the rough transcript of the call was the \u201cbest evidence\u201d to help determine what to do.\n\nThe officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. Kerri Kupec, a Justice Department spokeswoman, said in a statement that the head of the Justice Department\u2019s criminal division determined that \u201cthere was no campaign finance violation and that no further action was warranted.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll relevant components of the Department agreed with his legal conclusion, and the Department has concluded the matter,\u201d Kupec said. She said that although Trump mentioned Barr in the call, the president had \u201cnot spoken with the Attorney General about having Ukraine investigate anything related to former Vice President Biden or his son,\u201d nor had Barr discussed Ukraine with Giuliani.\n\nThe department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel has opined that a sitting president cannot be indicted \u2014 although officials said that was not a part of the calculus in this instance. A president can be charged after leaving office.\n\nEven before the Justice Department\u2019s decision was made public, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said Democrats would conduct an impeachment inquiry into Trump \u2014 which need not find technical violations of campaign finance or bribery laws.\n\n\u201cIt is still within Congress\u2019s power to impeach and remove by viewing this as an abuse of power,\u201d said Richard L. Hasen, a University of California at Irvine law professor specializing in election law. \u201cWhether it\u2019s a crime is secondary to the impeachment inquiry. It could be relevant if Trump is out of office and somebody wants to try to prosecute him.\u201d\n\nThe matter first came to the Justice Department\u2019s attention in late August, soon after the inspector general for the intelligence community gave to the acting director of national intelligence a whistleblower complaint alleging that unnamed White House officials had expressed concern about Trump\u2019s call.\n\nThe inspector general determined that the complaint represented an \u201curgent\u201d concern, and should be forwarded to the congressional intelligence committees. But the acting director of national intelligence contacted the Justice Department, wondering whether the unusual circumstances warranted something else.\n\nThe Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel and its head, Steven A. Engel, soon began exploring what to do. According to senior Justice Department officials, the acting director of national intelligence around the same time made a criminal referral, passing to the department the inspector general\u2019s concern that campaign finance laws might have been violated.\n\nOn Sept. 3, Engel issued a classified memo declaring that the acting director of national intelligence need not turn over the complaint to Congress. Such a step would be taken only if the complaint was about an intelligence activity, Engel wrote in a later, public version of the document. The whistleblower\u2019s secondhand allegation about Trump\u2019s call, he wrote, would be more properly referred to the Justice Department.\n\nRep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), the chair of the House Intelligence Committee, said that decision \u201cthrows the leadership of that department into further ill repute.\u201d\n\nOn Sept. 4, the inspector general made a separate, written referral to the FBI, senior Justice Department officials said. By that time, the officials said, the Justice Department already had assigned its criminal division and public integrity prosecutors \u2014 which normally handle campaign finance cases \u2014 to explore whether there was enough evidence to open an investigation. The FBI, the officials said, deferred to the Justice Department. An FBI spokeswoman declined to comment.\n\nOn Sept. 9, the inspector general notified Congress of the complaint, but did not share its contents. A day later, Schiff demanded to see it. On Sept. 18, The Washington Post reported that it involved Trump\u2019s communications with a foreign leader and some kind of \u201cpromise.\u201d\n\nThat very week \u2014 unbeknown to the public \u2014 the Justice Department decided there was not enough evidence to proceed with a campaign finance investigation. The decision, senior Justice Department officials said, was made by Brian Benczkowski, who heads the Justice Department\u2019s criminal division. They said career prosecutors agreed with the decision.\n\nThe officials said Barr was \u201cgenerally knowledgeable\u201d of discussions about the Office of Legal Counsel decision, but was not involved in making the call not to move forward with an investigation. Legal analysts and Democrats said Wednesday that Barr should step aside from the matter entirely.\n\n\u201cThe President dragged the Attorney General into this mess,\u201d Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), the chair of the House Judiciary Committee, wrote on Twitter. \u201cAt a minimum, AG Barr must recuse himself until we get to the bottom of this matter.\u201d\n\nBarr has previously faced criticism from Democrats for shielding Trump, especially in his descriptions of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s report on whether the president had conspired with the Russians to influence the 2016 election. Before the report was released, Barr offered what he termed its \u201cprincipal conclusions\u201d and hewed closely to Trump\u2019s favorite talking points on the special counsel investigation: no collusion, no obstruction. Mueller complained later that Barr\u2019s characterization \u201cdid not fully capture the context, nature, and substance\u201d of his work.\n\nThe criminal divisions\u2019s analysis of Trump\u2019s call essentially started and ended with the decision that a Ukrainian investigation into Biden could not be assigned a specific value.\n\n\u201cIf you cannot quantify what the thing of value would be, then it\u2019s fatal,\u201d a senior Justice Department official said.\n\nMueller had to wrestle with a similar question as he examined the Trump campaign\u2019s July 2016 meeting at Trump Tower with a Russian lawyer who had offered derogatory information on Hillary Clinton, Trump\u2019s opponent in the presidential race. Mueller\u2019s team wrote in its report that \u201ccandidate-related opposition research\u201d could be a contribution and potentially break the law, if it came from a foreign source. But they also noted that \u201cno judicial decision has treated the voluntary provision of uncompensated opposition research or similar information as a thing of value that could amount to a contribution under campaign-finance law.\u201d\n\nHasen, the law professor, said he thought the Justice Department\u2019s determination that Trump\u2019s request could not be quantified was \u201claughable.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re talking about information on a potential rival that could be used in a presidential campaign, a presidential campaign which likely would run into the billions of dollars,\u201d Hasen said. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any question that a prosecutor could go forward with the theory.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Trump seemed to focus on another allegation that legal analysts said he might have faced: trying to extort or solicit a bribe from Ukraine\u2019s government. The president insisted he had not offered a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d to his Ukrainian counterpart, which is an aspect of a federal corruption case.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all a hoax, folks, it\u2019s all a big hoax,\u201d he said in New York on Wednesday. \u201cNo push, no pressure, no nothing . . . There was no quid pro quo.\u201d\n\nLegal analysts noted that the context of Trump\u2019s call \u2014 at the time, the administration was withholding hundreds of millions of dollars in aid from Ukraine at Trump\u2019s direction \u2014 suggests he was trying to strike a bargain. Eliason, the former federal prosecutor, noted that in most bribery cases, those accused seldom offer an explicit bargain.\n\n\u201cYou normally don\u2019t have a quid pro quo stated expressly,\u201d Eliason said. \u201cThis is almost as close as you can get.\u201d", "description": "Legal analysts say there was enough evidence to investigate the president for multiple crimes, but the department\u2019s criminal division found insufficient cause.", "authors": ["Matt Zapotosky", "National Security Reporter Covering The Justice Department", "Devlin Barrett", "Reporter Focusing On National Security", "Law Enforcement", "September At Pm", "Matt Zapotosky Covers The Justice Department For The Washington Post'S National Security Team.
