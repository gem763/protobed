ALV has increased its DPS from \u20ac3.5 to \u20ac9 in the past 10 years. During this period it has not missed a payment, as one would expect for a company increasing its dividend. These are all positive signs of a great, reliable dividend stock.\n\nAllianz has a trailing twelve-month payout ratio of 49%, meaning the dividend is sufficiently covered by earnings. Going forward, analysts expect ALV's payout to remain around the same level at 49% of its earnings. Assuming a constant share price, this equates to a dividend yield of 5.0%. In addition to this, EPS should increase to \u20ac19.43.\n\nIf you want to dive deeper into the sustainability of a certain payout ratio, you may wish to consider the cash flow of the business. A company with strong cash flow, relative to earnings, can sometimes sustain a high pay out ratio.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nAllianz's strong dividend attributes make it, without a doubt, a stock dividend investors should be considering for their portfolios.
