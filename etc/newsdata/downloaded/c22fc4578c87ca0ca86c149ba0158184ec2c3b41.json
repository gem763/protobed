The event center housed many vendors during the fair, including those for hot tubs.\n\nThose sickened were more likely to say they walked by the hot tub display compared to those who were not sickened, health officials said in an Oct. 3 update. Testing identified Legionella bacteria in at least one water sample taken from the Davis Event Center.\n\n\u201cLow levels of Legionella present were able to grow in hot tubs or possibly some other source in the Davis Event Center leading to exposure through breathing in aerosolized water that contained the bacteria,\u201d authorities said at the time.\n\nLegionnaires\u2019 disease is a severe form of pneumonia. People contract the disease when inhaling Legionella bacteria; it\u2019s not spread via person-to-person contact. Legionella pneumophila, a bacterium, is usually the cause of the illness, per the Mayo Clinic. It can be found in soil and water, but more commonly causes infection when it multiplies in water systems (e.g., hot tubs and air conditioners).\n\nLEGIONNAIRES\u2019 OUTBREAK IN NORTH CAROLINA LINKED TO HOT TUBS AT STATE FAIR, OFFICIALS SAY\n\nThe disease is treatable with antibiotics and those who are sickened typically recover in full. Symptoms often include fever, chills, cough, and shortness of breath.\n\nThe news comes after health officials in Georgia this past August responded to a massive Legionnaires\u2019 outbreak linked to a hotel in Atlanta. At the time, a state health official told Fox News that the Legionella outbreak was the largest ever recorded in Georgia.", "description": "A third person has died following an outbreak of Legionnaires\u2019 disease in North Carolina.", "authors": ["Madeline Farber", "Madeline Farber Is A Reporter For Fox News.
