Less than a month into the NFL season, the Miami Dolphins have shredded their roster to such bare bones that it\u2019s giving Philadelphia 76ers fans flashbacks.\n\nThe start of Miami\u2019s rebuilding process appears to involve a high-end quarterback targeted through the NFL draft. And a quick peek around the league shows that the quarterback-needy Denver Broncos and Cincinnati Bengals could end up competing to join them there. (And perhaps the Tennessee Titans, Los Angeles Chargers, Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Oakland Raiders eventually maneuvering in.)\n\nThe early drumbeat of the 2020 NFL quarterback debate revolves around two players \u2013 Oregon\u2019s Justin Herbert and Alabama\u2019s Tua Tagovailoa. It would be surprising, at this juncture, if both didn\u2019t end up in the top 10 of the NFL draft. There\u2019s still a chance for a handful of other quarterbacks to join them in the first-round conversation: Utah State\u2019s Jordan Love, Georgia\u2019s Jake Fromm, LSU\u2019s Joe Burrow, Colorado\u2019s Steven Montez, Oklahoma\u2019s Jalen Hurts and Washington\u2019s Jacob Eason.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nBut for the next eight months, it\u2019s hard to imagine the high-end debate not revolving around some form of Justin vs. Tua. Yahoo Sports polled nearly a dozen scouts and analysts on the two quarterbacks, and the results were nearly split. Tua\u2019s feel, production and accuracy were brought up and juxtaposed against Herbert\u2019s body prototype, cannon arm and intellect.\n\nWho you like depends on who you ask.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cI like Tua a lot,\u201d said one scout. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have an elite arm, but he\u2019s so damn instinctive. What separates him is the production, instincts and accuracy.\u201d\n\nOregon's Justin Herbert (L) and Alabama's Tua Tagovailoa appear to be the top two NFL quarterback prospects. (Getty)\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s so much to like about Herbert because of his skill set,\u201d said longtime NFL executive Mike Tannenbaum, now a draft analyst for ESPN. \u201cHis ceiling is so high, character is so good. If you are building a quarterback, he really checks every box from a measurables standpoint.\u201d\n\nHow close is it? Consider it a coin flip at this point. Those who like Tagovailoa point to his 67.7 percent completion percentage last year, while Herbert finished at just 59.4 percent. (Oregon receivers dropped 52 passes last year, which didn\u2019t help.)\n\nSo far this season, both have thrived. Herbert has ripped off a 74.4 percent completion rate and 14 touchdowns with zero interceptions. Tagovailoa has completed 77.7 percent of his passes and has 17 touchdowns and zero interceptions.\n\nWhere do they differ? From a purely physical standpoint, Herbert has a distinct edge. He\u2019s 6-foot-6 and 237 pounds, a body type that long-time NFL executive Mike Williams compares to Ben Roethlisberger and Josh Allen.\n\nTagovailoa is 6-foot-1 and 218 pounds with a frame that\u2019s solid but may make NFL executives wince when they think of the pounding that position tends to take.\n\n\u201cIf I had to give the edge to one right now, it\u2019d be Herbert because of his build,\u201d said Williams, a former NFL personnel director who worked in front offices for 18 years. \u201cBut I could change my mind this afternoon.\u201d\n\nThere are, of course, drawbacks to each as well. With Tagovailoa, the first negative point mentioned is that he\u2019s left-handed. There are currently no lefty quarterbacks in the NFL.\n\nDrafting a left-handed quarterback involves a directional reversal of how an offense would work, which is much more complicated in reality than many would perceive. (The last lefty in the NFL was Kellen Moore, now Dallas\u2019 offensive coordinator, and the last lefty touchdown pass was from Dez Bryant on a trick play.)\n\nFrom there, the other big knock on Tagovailoa comes from him wheezing through the end of last season, as he struggled in the SEC title game against Georgia (10-for-25 passing) and threw two interceptions in the national title game, including a horrific pick-six. (He was 24-of-27 against Oklahoma in the CFP semifinals, so it wasn\u2019t a total dud.)\n\nOne NFL scout was quick to point out that Tagovailoa\u2019s injured ankle shouldn\u2019t be discounted when his late-season performance from last year is assessed. But Williams added: \u201cWhen the big games have come so far, he hasn\u2019t performed as well. There\u2019s still time for him to make up for that or prove people wrong on that point.\u201d\n\nHerbert, conversely, hasn\u2019t had as many big stages. Oregon went 9-4 last season, including an unsightly 7-6 bowl victory against Michigan State. The Ducks also gave away their opening game to Auburn this season, although Herbert was 28-of-37 passing for 242 yards. Herbert lacks an alpha personality, though coaches have been complimentary with his evolution as a leader.\n\nMechanically, Herbert isn\u2019t particularly fluid. \u201cHe\u2019s a little bit long with the delivery,\u201d Williams said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have an especially quick delivery, but to offset that I think his motion is really efficient.\u201d\n\nWho is the best bet to unseat one of those two at the top of the draft? That would be Utah State\u2019s Love, who has become a darling of the scouting community. Love is a 6-foot-4, 225-pound redshirt junior, and his frame still has plenty of room to fill out. He threw 32 touchdowns and six interceptions last season and has completed 68 percent of his passes this season. Love had no other FBS scholarship offers when Matt Wells\u2019 staff offered him at Utah State. He didn\u2019t get any after, either.\n\nAnother player gathering buzz is Fromm, who is considered a tick under NFL prototypes at 6-foot-2, but is a solidly built 220 pounds. Tannenbaum compares him to former Jets quarterback Chad Pennington.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s super efficient,\u201d said Blake Anderson, the Arkansas State coach who faced Fromm earlier this year. \u201cHe\u2019s big enough, he\u2019s not a 6-foot-5 dude, but he\u2019s put together and a good-looking athlete. He\u2019s just so calm and poised and can make all the throws, and while he doesn\u2019t move a whole lot, he does it in a way that keeps him available to throw for a long, long time.\u201d\n\nMany of the intangibles also impressed Anderson, who saw Fromm telling players to tighten their splits or widen them out, moving them off the line and keeping the entire offense in sync. \u201cYou could tell he\u2019s in complete control of what\u2019s going on,\u201d he said.\n\nThe buzz from Fromm has been tempered some because scouts really haven\u2019t started to dig in to him until this season because he\u2019s a true junior. There\u2019s a good chance he stays for a fourth year, as he\u2019s a local kid who clearly relishes playing college football. Burrow has been a rocket ship this season, completing a mind-bending 80.6 percent of his passes and has 17 touchdowns. Montez may have the draft\u2019s biggest arm, and both Hurts and Eason have the potential to soar if they continue their hot starts after transferring.\n\nBut for now, the debate starts with Tua vs. Justin. The next few months will give a talented field a chance to join them.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "The early drumbeat of the 2020 NFL draft quarterback debate revolves around two players.
