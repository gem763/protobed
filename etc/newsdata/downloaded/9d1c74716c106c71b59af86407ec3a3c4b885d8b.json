Her emergence on the world stage coincides with the United States' withdrawal from the Paris Agreement and other multilateral and global accords and institutions that have greatly undermined the global climate cause.\n\nOn Sunday, just a day before the UN Climate Action Summit, top climate scientists issued a stern warning that sea-level rise, global warming, melting ice sheets and carbon pollution have accelerated in the past several years.\n\nThey highlighted in their report the urgency of fundamental socioeconomic transformation and carbon-curbing actions in areas such as land use and energy to avert dangerous global temperature rise.\n\nSpeaking at the summit, Thunberg admonished world leaders saying: \"How dare you continue to look away, and come here saying that you are doing enough, when the politics and solutions needed are still nowhere in sight... And if you choose to fail us I say we will never forgive you. We will not let you get away with this.\"\n\nIn February, while asking two interns to cover the School Strike for Climate demonstration led by Thunberg in Brussels, I had told them that they would meet a future world leader. I was wrong. Thunberg is already a world leader.\n\nHer message, each and every word, at the climate summit was powerful. Her glare at the US leader when the latter walked into the UN summit venue briefly is worth more than a thousand words. The US leader and many of his key administration officials are stout climate deniers and have refused to admit that humans have caused climate change despite the overwhelming evidence scientists around the world have produced.\n\nThe sad truth about the current US administration officials is in line with their political base. A Pew survey last month showed that 84 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents say climate change is a major threat to the country's well-being, while only 27 percent Republicans and Republican-leaning individuals say so.\n\nBesides denying climate change and withdrawing from the Paris climate accord, the US leader has also made it difficult for other countries to tackle the climate crisis by waging rampant trade wars. The disruption in global supply chains means more carbon emissions. China has so far been the main target of the US trade war.\n\nChina has embarked on an ambitious and arduous agenda to transform its economic development model into a more sustainable one. It has greatly cut down its carbon intensity and invested aggressively, more than any other country, in renewable energy and electric cars.\n\nBut China can and should do more to tackle the challenges even though its per capita emission is still much lower than that of other major economies including the US, Canada, the Republic of Korea, Russia, Japan and Germany according to the International Energy Agency and the International Monetary Fund.\n\nWhile the US government's disruptive actions have impaired the global momentum in the fight against climate change, Thunberg has injected the much-needed energy into it. Despite this, the US leader has shamelessly claimed he deserves the Nobel Prize for a lot of things. However, it is the young Thunberg who deserves the Nobel, for she acts much more like an adult and a true world leader than the US leader.\n\nThe author is chief of China Daily EU Bureau based in Brussels.\n\nchenweihua@chinadaily.com.cn", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201909/27/5d8d4d79a310cf3e979e4063.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
