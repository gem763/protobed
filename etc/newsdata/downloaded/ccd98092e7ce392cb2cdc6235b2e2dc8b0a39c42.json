They would never give it away, never give away that power. It was the last thing he had,' she said.\n\n'He was never going to give that death bed confession that many of us were hoping before because we believe he had other victims. Someone like him won't give them away.'\n\nMilat's seven victims were Melbourne couple Deborah Everist (top left) and James Gibson (bottom right), both 19, English backpackers Joanne Walters (bottom left) and Caroline Clarke (bottom second from right), and German backpackers Anja Habschied (top centre), Simone Schmidl (top right) and Gabor Neugebauer (bottom second from left)\n\nIn this November 1997 photo, Ivan Milat smiles in a police car after attending a court in Sydney, Australia\n\nMilat was convicted in 1996 for the murder of seven backpackers in the Belanglo State Forest, south of Sydney.\n\nHis victims were English backpackers Caroline Clarke, 21, and Joanne Walters 22; Melbourne couple James Gibson and Deborah Everist, both 19; and German backpackers Simone Schmidl, 20, Gabor Neugebauer, 21, and Anja Habschied, 20.\n\nHe stabbed most, decapitated one whose head has never been found and shot another 10 times in the head as if using her for target practice.\n\nMany were knifed so savagely their bones were chipped, some had been gagged or bound, and some were suspected of having been sexually assaulted.\n\nWhile cancer took the elderly prisoner's life, his victims were slaughtered in the prime of youth.\n\nHow the killer was caught: Milat snared after victim got away Milat tried to kidnap British hitch-hiker Paul Thomas Onions, who he picked up in January 1990 near a turn off to the Bengalo forest. Mr Onions said he was so scared he bolted into oncoming traffic after Milat pointed a gun at him and reached for some rope. Onions got away and identified Milat from photos show to him by the police in 1994. Milat was arrested on 22 May, 1994 and Mr Onions was a key witness at his trial.\n\n'These seven young persons were at the threshold of their lives, with everything to look forward to - travel, career, happiness, love, family, and even old age,' said Justice David Hunt who jailed Milat for life in 1996.\n\n'It is clear that they were subjected to behaviour which, for callous indifference to suffering and complete disregard of humanity, is almost beyond belief.\n\n'They would obviously have been absolutely terrified, and death is unlikely to have been swiftly applied.'\n\nMilat was born two days after Christmas 1944, one of 14 children of Australian-born Margaret and Yugoslavian-born Steven Milat who lived in Sydney's west.\n\nHe left school at 15, had minor dealings with the police and worked on the roads for years, around Sydney and country NSW.\n\nThe self-confessed gun enthusiast was regarded as a conscientious employee, with one boss saying he was 'the best worker we ever had'.\n\nHis former wife Karen, who left him in 1987 after four years of marriage, described him as 'gun crazy', recalling him killing kangaroos on a visit to Belanglo State Forest.\n\n'Ivan pulled out a rifle, shot the first kangaroo, shot the second kangaroo, slit its throat and kicked it to make sure it was dead,' she said.\n\nMilat also was found guilty of kidnapping British backpacker Paul Onions who escaped his clutches in January 1990, near the turn-off to the forest.\n\nMr Onions said he was so scared he bolted into oncoming traffic after Milat pointed a gun at him and reached for some rope.\n\nThe crimes made headlines around the world, shattering Australia's standing as a safe haven for budget-conscious young travellers.\n\nMilat passed away at 4.07am on Sunday morning in the hospital section (pictured) of Sydney's Long Bay jail\n\nMilat - Australia's worst serial killer - has died aged 74 of cancer which riddled his bodies\n\nOver the years, Milat has been linked to the disappearance of other young men and women in areas where he worked with a road gang.\n\nJustice Hunt had commented it was 'inevitable' Milat was not alone in committing the murders.\n\nIn 1974, he was cleared of raping one of two young hitchhikers he picked up three years earlier near the same highway where the seven murdered backpackers were picked up.\n\nMilat had denied one woman's evidence he produced two knives, threatened to kill them if they did not have sex with him, and had two lengths of pink nylon cords.\n\n'He said he made a habit of picking up hitchhikers and was always prepared with the knives,' she testified.\n\nHe told them he was going to kill them, saying: 'You won't scream when I cut your throats, will you?'\n\n'Bloody beauty': Victims' families react to news of Milat's death By Kylie Stevens Melbourne woman Deborah Everist was just 19 when she went missing with boyfriend James Gibson, 19, in late December 1989. Their parents reported the pair missing to police a week later but their bodies weren't found in Belanglo State Forest almost four years later. 'Yes!' was Deborah's brother Tim Everis's initial response on Facebook after learning of Milat's death. Mr Everist also expressed his relief to Channel Nine crime reporter Simon Bouda. Deborah Everist (left) and her boyfriend James Gibson (right) were among Ivan Milat's seven victims 'He just said to me 'bloody beauty'. He was very, very, happy,' Bouda told The Today Show on Sunday. 'I think what they see it as is the end of a chapter, they can now move on and continue with their lives. Ian Clarke, the father of Caroline Clarke, one of the two British backpackers killed by Milat in 1992 also welcomed the news. 'My immediate reaction is that any decent person would not wish this disease on anyone but I find it hard not to make an exception in his case after the terrifying experiences to which he subjected all those fine young people,' he said. The Welsh parents of Joanne Walters who was murdered with her friend Caroline, said they didn't wish to comment. The parents of German Gabor Neugebauer, 21, who was gagged and shot six times after he and his girlfriend Anja Habschied, 20, disappeared in January 1992 also declined to comment. 'We will not comment further these horror of our lives,' his father told The Daily Telegraph. The family of Anja Habschied could not be contacted recently while the father of German backpacker Simone Schmidl's father took his grief to the grave. Mr Gibson's family were also unable to be contacted, with his father Ray 'not to be in the best of health'.\n\nBut Milat told the jury that her 18-year-old friend agreed to have sex with him in the front seat of his car on a dirt road.\n\n'It was a friendly trek down there and afterwards when I run them back to the shops, she was real friendly, she was okay, and everything seemed to be alright.'\n\nMilat gave evidence at his 1996 trial, coming across as cool as a cucumber, as he denied the overwhelming evidence against him.\n\nHundreds of pieces of information linked him to the murders including property of the victims: a jersey worn by Ms Clarke resembled one Milat gave his girlfriend.\n\nThe prosecutor accused him of 'incredible arrogance and unbelievable self-confidence'.\n\nSimone Schmidl (pictured) from Germany had last been seen leaving Sydney for Melbourne\n\nHe'd tuck a pistol into one of his well-polished boots when he went to the movies, kept a pistol under his car seat and a 'friendly machete' in his vehicle.\n\nKaren Milat said her 'very fit' ex-husband made a leather holster for a revolver and 'ran around like a cowboy and called himself Tex'.\n\nHe even posed in his lounge room as an armed cowboy wearing a sheriff's badge, telling the jury 'I was trying to make up some cowboy pictures just to put in my album'.\n\nMilat watched cricket, had a cat called Gizmo, had a beloved Harley-Davidson motorcycle and used to paint model trucks and planes in camouflage colours.\n\nBehind bars, Milat remained in the headlines.\n\nA decade ago, he ended a hunger strike days after cutting off his little finger and handing it to prison officers inside an envelope padded with newspaper.\n\nHe severed the finger with a serrated plastic knife and addressed the envelope to the Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia.\n\nIn early 2001, Milat swallowed razor blades, paper staples and a tiny metal chain, and then later that year he swallowed part of the flushing mechanism from the toilet in his cell.\n\nShockingly, his terrible legacy continued in 2010 when his great-nephew, Matthew Milat, lured his 17-year-old friend into Belanglo and murdered him with an axe.\n\nThe next day, he boasted: 'You know me, you know my family. You know the last name Milat. I did what they do.'\n\nMilat's victims were variously shot and stabbed and one of the bodies was found decapitated.
