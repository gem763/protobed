His native Turkey has been turned into a \u201ctotalitarian prison\u201d under president Recep Tayyip Erdogan, according to the Washington Post\u2019s editorial board, and Kanter has effectively lost his country by speaking out against the dictator.\n\nHis passport has been cancelled, his father has been imprisoned, he is no longer able to play outside the U.S., he has had youth basketball camps threatened, he has been accosted at a mosque and he sleeps with a panic button due to a truckload of death threats.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nMeanwhile, the NBA and its players are dealing with an authoritarian problem of their own. Of course, rather than face the stick from Turkey as Kanter has, they are instead being incentivized by the carrot of Chinese revenue to stay silent about the country\u2019s human rights violations and suppression of democracy in Hong Kong. China\u2019s threat to erase the league from the country like it has the Rockets and so many other dissenters has been effective; no major NBA players have publicly supported Daryl Morey\u2019s tweet of \u201cFight for Freedom, Stand with Hong Kong,\u201d lest they lose a significant portion of their paycheck.\n\nLos Angeles Lakers superstar LeBron James went so far as to call Morey \u201cmisinformed\u201d on Monday for tweeting such a thing about a city where police have arrested thousands of protesters pushing for democratic elections and against a bill that would allow criminal suspects to be extradited to mainland China.\n\nEnes Kanter has some things to say, probably about LeBron James\n\nStory continues\n\nJames\u2019 complaints of a \u201cterrible week\u201d in which the Lakers nearly had preseason games cancelled, lamenting how \u201cpeople could have been harmed, not only financially but physically, emotionally spiritually\u201d by Morey\u2019s tweet \u2014 \u201churt feelings\u201d are a frequent trope used by Chinese propaganda against dissent \u2014 and refusal to discuss the politics of a country where he makes millions predictably drew some prime subtweeting from Kanter late Monday night.\n\nWow dude! \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f \u2014 Enes Kanter (@EnesKanter) October 15, 2019\n\nSMH \u2014 Enes Kanter (@EnesKanter) October 15, 2019\n\n\ud83e\udd22 \u2014 Enes Kanter (@EnesKanter) October 15, 2019\n\n-Haven\u2019t seen or talked to my family 5 years\n\n-Jailed my dad\n\n-My siblings can\u2019t find jobs\n\n-Revoked my passport\n\n-International arrest warrant\n\n-My family can\u2019t leave the country\n\n-Got Death Threats everyday\n\n-Got attacked, harassed\n\n-Tried to kidnap me in Indonesia\n\n\n\nFREEDOM IS NOT FREE \u2014 Enes Kanter (@EnesKanter) October 15, 2019\n\nKanter didn\u2019t immediately denounce the NBA\u2019s reaction to Morey\u2019s tweet either, though he probably shouldn\u2019t have to be the league\u2019s singular anti-authoritarian mouthpiece at the end of the day. He instead said that he hoped the league could \u201cbuild bridges.\u201d Monday\u2019s sub-tweeting might be a signal he\u2019s becoming less confident in that happening.\n\nThe @NBA stands with me for freedom and democracy.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s made all the difference.\n\n\n\nI hope we can build bridges, instead of breaking them. https://t.co/6Y8V16lP7j \u2014 Enes Kanter (@EnesKanter) October 7, 2019\n\nJust what the Celtics-Lakers rivalry needed: geopolitical intrigue.\n\nLeBron James toed the company line on China.
