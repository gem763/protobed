New discoveries or studies often lead to changes in old theories and sometimes even invalidate them altogether. That means some of the \"facts\" you learned in school aren't necessarily true anymore.\n\nFor example, dinosaurs probably didn't look the way your textbook depicted them. The origins of Homo sapiens aren't as neat as the timeline you might have learned. And many of the nutrition and exercise guidance from your health classes has been debunked.\n\nHere are some science facts you may have learned in school that aren't true anymore.", "description": "Neanderthals were more advanced than you think, and the speed of light isn't absolute.
