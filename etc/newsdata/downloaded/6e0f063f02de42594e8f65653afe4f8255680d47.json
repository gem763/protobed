And rare. According to the World Wildlife Fund, there are only about 3,900 wild tigers in the entire world. Some 60 to 62 of them roam within the 400-square-kilometer (154-square-mile) core of India's Ranthambore National Park in the state of Rajasthan. Easily camouflaged, tigers move freely through the park's dry deciduous forest, bush land and rocky hills, and among the hauntingly beautiful stone ruins that allude to the ancient kingdoms that once thrived there.\n\nDeer grazing at the Ranthambore National Park.

She saw a tiger and it changed her life. She has since been to Ranthambore more than 150 times and was even inspired to write a book \u2014 \"Looking at the Tiger.\"\n\nGetting around\n\nA fixed number of vehicles are permitted in the park for a morning and an afternoon tracking session each day. Visitors must remain inside the vehicles for their safety \u2014 tigers are powerful carnivores, after all. Each of the 40 gypsies (or jeeps) and open-sided canters (or mini-buses) must be accompanied by an English-speaking guide, though what matters most is their ability to track a tiger.\n\nA tiger in Ranthambore National Park.

Guides like Himmat Singh of Ranthambhore Safaris & Tours grew up in the area and know the park intimately. A guide for more than 25 years, it's Singh's job to scan the ground for pug marks (footprints) and listen for the short high-pitched alarm call of the sambar deer and langur monkeys, warning one another that a predator \u2014 a tiger \u2014 is near.\n\nSpotting a tiger\n\nThere are of course no guarantees, but the hope is a tiger will saunter past your canter or jeep, rewarding you with an up-close look at its muscular body, long powerful tail and handsome face. Males can easily weigh more than 400 pounds, yet these huge cats in their silky, striped orange and black coats are exceedingly graceful. While the elusive tiger is what draws people to Ranthambore, visitors are equally as lucky to encounter an evasive caracal \u2014 a lithe cat with a flamboyant tuft of hair on its head \u2014 or a leopard or sloth bear. Sambar deer, wild pigs, and peacocks, on the other hand, are ubiquitous.\n\nA peacock in Ranthambore, India.

Tree removal for firewood remains one of the most challenging issues for India's wildlife.\n\nIt's estimated around 60 wild tigers roam within Rajasthan's Ranthambore National Park.

In 1980, it was made a national park. Despite the challenges, the tiger numbers at Ranthambore have been holding steady. In fact, a July New York Times article claims India's tiger population has actually increased.\n\nVisitors must remain inside vehicles for their own safety.
