The Dealmaster is back with another round of deals to share. Today's list is headlined by a pre-order deal for Google's Pixel 4 smartphones, which were formally unveiled earlier this week. Various retailers\u2014including Best Buy, Amazon, and Google's online store\u2014are currently bundling a $100 gift card with pre-orders of the new devices at their standard MSRPs. The 5.7-inch Pixel 4 starts at $799 for a 64GB model, while the 6.3-inch Pixel 4 XL starts at $899. All of these gift cards are specific to a given retailer, so if you plan to take advantage of the deal, be sure to pick the store you're most likely to use again.\n\nThe Dealmaster wants to be clear here: you should only take advantage of this offer if you're already dead set on upgrading to a Pixel 4 at launch. If you're still on the fence, you may be better off waiting to see if Google drops the price of its new phones for the holidays; last year, for instance, Google cut the price of an unlocked Pixel 3 by $150 for Black Friday, less than two months after the phone first hit shelves. There's no guarantee that will happen again\u2014or that the Pixel 4 will not launch with niggling bugs the way the Pixel 3 did out of the gate\u2014but we'd be remiss if we didn't mention it. It's also worth reiterating that this is a pre-order deal: while the Pixel 4's 90Hz display and camera upgrades look promising and its guaranteed software upgrades are great, there are still questions we won't be able to answer until we finish fully reviewing the phones.\n\nThat said, if you're sold on getting a new Google phone right away\u2014the Pixel line does have a history of great cameras, after all\u2014we think this deal is worth highlighting for those who would rather not tie themselves to a mobile carrier or \"bill credits\" discounts that won't fully pay off for several months. Just be aware of the context. And if you don't need a new phone, we also have a ton of video game deals, a rare Nintendo Switch discount, and more.
