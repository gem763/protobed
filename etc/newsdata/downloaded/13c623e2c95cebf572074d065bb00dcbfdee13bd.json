REUTERS/Stringer\n\nPresident Xi Jinping will oversee a massive parade of the armed forces through central Beijing on Oct. 1 to mark 70 years since the establishment of Communist China, with state media promising that new missiles, aircraft and drones will be shown.\n\nXi has overseen an ambitious military modernisation programme and rising defence spending since he took power in late 2012. China has been frequently criticised by Washington and its allies for being overly secretive and a threat to regional stability.\n\nChinese Defence Ministry spokesman Wu Qian, speaking at a news conference about the parade, said there were always certain people and forces who \u201cliked to hype things up untruthfully\u201d about the country\u2019s military.\n\n\u201cIn their heads they have an extremely strange logic: if the Chinese armed forces show off arms and equipment then it\u2019s a \u2018show of force\u2019, and if they don\u2019t then they \u2018lack transparency,\u2019\u201d Wu said.\n\nIn the last seven decades, China\u2019s military development has been plain for all to see, he added.\n\n\u201cWe have no intention, and no need, to use a military parade as a \u2018show of force,\u201d said Wu. \u201cThe stronger we are, the more positive energy we can bring to world peace.\u201d\n\nChina has been coy about exactly what new equipment it will put on display at the parade.\n\nAttention in state media has focused on the Dongfeng-41 intercontinental ballistic missile that may be able to carry several nuclear warheads and reach the United States, supersonic drones and stealth fighters.\n\nTan Min, one of the senior officers overseeing parade preparations, told the same news conference that people would have to \u201cwait and see\u201d exactly what China would put on show.\n\nTan promised the equipment would all be made-in-China and show off the country\u2019s prowess at innovation.\n\nService personnel taking part all have to reach exacting standards, including their absolutely loyalty to the party and to Xi, he added.\n\nThe youngest soldiers would be around 20, while the oldest - the more senior officers - would be around 60 and above, Tan said.\n\nAround 15,000 personnel and more than 160 aircraft are taking part and the parade will last around 80 minutes, added Cai Zhijun, another senior officer helping oversee preparations.", "description": "China's military complained on Tuesday that if it displayed new weapons at next week's huge military parade in Beijing it would be seen as a \"show of force\", and if it didn't then it would be blamed for a lack of transparency.", "authors": ["Ben Blanchard", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190924&t=2&i=1433492391&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8N25T", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
