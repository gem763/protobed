It's not a risk if you know you're going to be arrested. It's something I'll do if I need to.\n\n\"We've got extremely good legal support and it's a very well set-up organisation so I feel like I'll be supported all through the way. An arrest doesn't mean a conviction.\"\n\nAnother young activist added that there was no pressure from the movement to protest in a particular way.\n\n\"Just because you're being arrested doesn't mean you do or don't support Extinction Rebellion any more than the next person,\" she said.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\"There are people within this group that support this group very much and they won't be getting arrested, but they support everybody.\"\n\nAround 200 protesters are thought to have camped in tents overnight on Horseferry Road and the surrounding area.\n\nMetropolitan Police officers have been deployed throughout the night across central London.\n\nThe force said: \"There continues to be a 24 hour policing plan in place. As of 00:01hrs this morning there have been 319 arrests in relation to the Extinction Rebellion protests.\"\n\nThere are expected to be more arrests today, possibly numbering in the hundreds again.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nLast night Boris Johnson dismissed the protesters as \"uncooperative crusties\" who should abandon their \"hemp-smelling bivouacs\" and stop blocking roads.\n\nTraders at Smithfield Market also expressed anger about cost to business from the protests.\n\nJames Burden said that missing one day of trade would cost the 31 meat companies \"millions\" of pounds collectively.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nOne trader said: \"It's a joke. Vehicles can't get in to collect the meat and it means we can't serve as many of our customers. It will cost our business alone \u00a310,000 in one night\".\n\nThere were fewer protesters than the 30,000 forecast yesterday but they set up roadblocks on Westminster and Lambeth Bridges, Victoria Street, Whitehall, Horse Guards Road and The Mall.\n\nThey plan to grind the city over the next fortnight.", "description": "Met Police demands for protesters to move to Trafalgar Square have been ignored by the climate change activists", "authors": ["Tom Davidson", "Image", "Ben Cawthra Lnp", "Pa", "Getty Images", "Afp Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20535592.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Extinction-Rebellion-Protesters-Launch-Planned-Central-London-Blockade.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
