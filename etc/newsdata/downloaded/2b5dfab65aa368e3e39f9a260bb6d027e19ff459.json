Orb\u00e1n\u2019s Fidesz won its third consecutive term in office at parliamentary elections last year and controls much of the country\u2019s media landscape.\n\n\u201cWe have destroyed the myth that Fidesz is unbeatable, and this has massive significance for the whole country,\u201d Kar\u00e1csony said in an interview on Thursday morning at a central Budapest cafe before he cycled to city hall for an official handover ceremony.\n\nKar\u00e1csony said once he took office he would increase cooperation with the liberal mayor of Warsaw, Rafa\u0142 Trzaskowski, and other central European mayors to counterbalance the confrontational stance that Hungarian and Polish governments have taken with Brussels in recent years.\n\nI was once Orb\u00e1n\u2019s ally. I despair at what he has done to Hungary | Zsuzsanna Szel\u00e9nyi Read more\n\n\u201cThe governments of these countries are taking us away from the core of Europe, when this is the region that should be the most interested in not having a two-tier Europe,\u201d he said.\n\nOn his first day in office on Friday, Kar\u00e1csony plans to send two letters, one to Orb\u00e1n asking for a meeting, and the other to the rector of Central European University asking the institution to keep as many courses as possible in Budapest.\n\nThe university, which teaches master\u2019s degrees in English to students from across the world, has been forced to move some of its courses to Vienna after the government refused to accredit it to issue US degrees in Hungary. The university was founded by the billionaire financier and philanthropist George Soros, whom Orb\u00e1n\u2019s government has depicted as an enemy who wants to destroy the country.\n\nKar\u00e1csony said that while he had no power to change the legal framework, he would assure CEU it was welcome in the city and would propose the establishment of a new scientific academy devoted to research and innovation based at the university.\n\nHe said he and Orb\u00e1n\u2019s government would look to see if there was a way to work together. \u201cMy political philosophy is all about compromise and building consensus. Sometimes I wish I was a politician in a Nordic country where you could govern by consensus, but now my job is to fight for peace,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile he wanted a constructive relationship, there were values he would not compromise on, and he said if Fidesz decided to go down the route of confrontation, \u201cwe are ready to pick up the gauntlet\u201d.\n\nHe said priorities for his first year in charge were to improve the social safety net for low-income families, divert more funding to homeless shelters and make improvements to public transport. He has promised to boost Budapest\u2019s green credentials and to attend the city\u2019s annual pride march.\n\nPro-government media has claimed Kar\u00e1csony only won with the votes of foreigners living in Budapest. Orb\u00e1n has downplayed the results, pointing to a strong showing in the countryside and a small increase in the number of votes gained by Fidesz overall. Zolt\u00e1n Kov\u00e1cs, Orb\u00e1n\u2019s spokesman, wrote on his blog in the aftermath of the result: \u201cWinning more than 50% of all votes, [Fidesz] has once again shown that it\u2019s still by far Hungary\u2019s strongest political force.\u201d\n\nHowever, analysts say wresting the capital from Fidesz\u2019s control will be a huge psychological boost for the Hungarian opposition, riven by years of infighting and irrelevance. The next nationwide elections are due in 2022.\n\nKar\u00e1csony said people in Budapest and other big cities were no different to other Hungarians but had access to \u201ca totally different media landscape\u201d that helped to puncture government propaganda.\n\nAdditional reporting by Flora Garamvolgyi.", "description": "Gergely Kar\u00e1csony was elected on Sunday, beating prime minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s candidate", "authors": ["Shaun Walker"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a2484be935d6b1eeb5698cea5b54a69299434f7/485_801_2656_1594/master/2656.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=540d0a5eb3ab1d0484b4efd36d44cf78", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
