Some of the charts saw technical improvements, but none violated resistance levels.\n\nThe data remain neutral across the board, although we got a notably higher opening Friday. That suggests a possible shift in trend.\n\nHowever, intraday volatility has increased over the past several sessions, with the slightest trade-war comments having significant near-term influence. This suggests said possible shifts in trend would need to be present at the close to be considered valid. As there's no assurance of that, I'm maintaining my near-term \"neutral/negative\" outlook until closing prices warrant a change.\n\nAlthough no resistance levels were violated, the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite all managed to close above their 50-day moving averages. Here's the S&P 500's chart:\n\nAnd here's the Dow Jones Industrial Average:\n\nAnd the Nasdaq Composite:\n\nCumulative breadth saw no notable changes, leaving the All Exchange and Nasdaq cumulative advance/decline ratio negative and the New York Stock Exchange's A/D neutral. High \"volume at price\" levels (or \"VAPs\") are supportive on the S&P 500, Dow industrials and Nasdaq and resistant on all others.\n\nShould the charts see violations of trend and resistance on the close (as implied by Friday's strong opening), I'll likely alter my outlook. However, that will only occur if said violations exist on the close.", "description": "The stock market's charts are 'Neutral/Negative,' but could turn positive on a strong Friday close", "authors": ["Guy Ortmann", "Charts Are 'Neutral Negative ' But Could Turn Positive On A Strong Friday Close", "We'Ll Have To See If The Major Indexes Manage To Cross Key Resistance Levels.", "Bruce Kamich", "Jim Collins", "Carolyn Boroden", "Bob Lang", "Helene Meisler", "Doug Kass", "Jim Cramer"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/e1f79ce2-7e29-11e8-9292-035d646ca9bb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
