You might want to try a facial cleansing brush, which helps to remove dirt, oil, and makeup more effectively than other methods, leaving your skin feeling oh so soft and clean. The Clarisonic is the most well-known brand out there for these types of brushes, and right now, you can get the best model we've ever tested for an amazing low price.\n\nThe Mia Smart cleansing brush is currently on sale on Amazon for just $135.20, which is $33 off what it normally retails for. A sale on any Clarisonic product (let alone one of their expensive devices) is hard to come by, so we're pretty excited to share this incredible deal with you.\n\nWhat's so special about the Mia Smart? Well, first of all, it's the best face cleansing brush of 2019. Our tester loved the gentle oscillation of the motorized brush head, and oohed and aahed at the Bluetooth technology, which allows you to sync the Mia Smart to the Clarisonic app on your phone, keep track of how often you wash your face, and take before-and-after photos to see your skin's progress. Not only that, but there's a little light that turns red to indicate when it's time to replace your brush head. The Mia Smart is also compatible with all Clarisonic brush heads, including the cleansing, anti-aging, exfoliation, and makeup ones.\n\nIf you're looking to revolutionize your skin-care routine, the Mia Smart might just be a great solution. This could be a big seller for the holidays and even on Black Friday if this deal persists, so if you want to beat the scores of shoppers and snag it in advance, don't pass this deal up.\n\nThe product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered.
