But a new article in The Atlantic reveals the depth of the obsession.\n\nIn his graduation speech as valedictorian of Miami Palmetto Senior High School's class of 1982, Bezos proclaimed his vision was for millions of humans to relocate to colonies in space.\n\nA local newspaper reported that his intention was 'to get all people off the Earth and see it turned into a huge national park.'\n\nAmazon CEO Jeff Bezos (left) idolizes Captain Jean-Luc Picard (right) from Star Trek: The Next Generation, according to a new report\n\nWhen reporters tracked down Bezos's high-school girlfriend in recent years, she said, 'The reason he's earning so much money is to get to outer space.'\n\nBezos is also an unabashed fan of the many Star Trek series and films, and in particular Picard, the captain of the USS Enterprise-D, the Atlantic reports.\n\nHe initially considered naming Amazon MakeItSo.com, after Picard's signature catchphrase. He has a holding company called Zefram, named after the the character who invented warp drive.\n\nBezos also named his dog Kamala, after a woman who appears in a TNG episode as Picard's 'perfect' but unattainable mate.\n\nHe even persuaded the makers of the film Star Trek Beyond to give him a cameo as a Starfleet official.\n\nBezos has even adopted Picard's look over the years, shaving his balding pate and sporting a gleaming chrome-dome.\n\nWith an overall net worth of about $114 billion, Bezos has funded Blue Origin by selling about $1 billion in Amazon stock a year, according to the Atlantic.\n\nIn May, he laid out his grand vision for humanity in an impassioned speech, showing concept art for space colonies that could house billions of humans.\n\nJeff Bezos, owner of Blue Origin, speaks about his dream of colonies in outer space in May\n\n\u201cWe can have a trillion humans in the solar system, which means we\u2019d have a thousand Mozarts and a thousand Einsteins. This would be an incredible civilization,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon has expanded aggressively across many sectors of commercial life, and is simultaneously a retail, entertainment and cloud computing titan with increasing ties to the federal government, and its sights set on a massive new headquarters outside of Washington DC.\n\nTech analyst Ben Thompson, the founder of Stratechery, argues that Amazon's master plan is to provide logistics 'for basically everyone and everything,'\n\nIf everything flows through Amazon, the company will be positioned to collect a 'tax' on a stunning array of transactions, Thompson writes.\n\nAtlantic staff writer Franklin Foer says that ambitions like that conjure a different image from the Star Trek universe.\n\n'The man who styles himself as the heroic Jean-Luc Picard has thus built a business that better resembles Picard's archenemy, the Borg,' Foer writes, 'a society-swallowing entity that informs victims, You will be assimilated and Resistance is futile.'", "description": "Bezos has invested billions in his aerospace company Blue Origin and his spacefaring ambitions are far from a secret.
