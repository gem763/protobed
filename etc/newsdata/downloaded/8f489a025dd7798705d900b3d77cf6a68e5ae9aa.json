USA TODAY\n\nARLINGTON, Texas \u2014 Jerry Jones hoped NFL official Scott Edwards wasn\u2019t too upset.\n\nThe referee penalized Cowboys coach Jason Garrett toward the end of the third quarter for unsportsmanlike conduct, his colleague saying after the game that Garrett used \u201cabusive language toward an official\u201d while throwing a flag.\n\nAbusive language?\n\n\u201cI hope the little darlin\u2019 didn\u2019t hear something he hadn\u2019t heard before,\u201d Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said after the Packers' 34-24 win. \u201cWe should all have stopped the wheel over there if he got [upset] over abusive language.\u201d\n\nJones\u2019 tongue-in-cheke remark characterized the team\u2019s reaction to a penalty enforced on an important play in Dallas\u2019 comeback effort.\n\nDallas trailed 31-10 with 19 seconds to play in the third quarter. Prescott found star receiver Amari Cooper 27 yards down the field with just enough time for Cooper to secure the ball and tap two feet in bounds before stepping past the sideline, cornerback Jaire Alexander inches away.\n\nHere's Amari Cooper with the unreal catch that was overturned after being ruled incomplete.\n\n\n\nAnd Jason Garrett getting the \"Oh he hurt the ref who was wrong feelings\" unsportsmanlike penalty pic.twitter.com/6L93Ft4aeL \u2014 Tom Downey (@WhatGoingDowney) October 6, 2019\n\nThe officials ruled the pass incomplete.\n\nGarrett hurled his challenge flag to the ground, he and offensive coordinator Kellen Moore animated as they reacted to a play they felt was obviously a completion. On Fox\u2019s broadcast, ex-Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman was surprised.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve known Jason Garrett a long time and that\u2019s not how he conducts himself,\u201d said Aikman, whom Garrett once backed up. \u201cI know that\u2019s what\u2019s so maddening right now for him to draw that penalty.\u201d\n\nGarrett broke down his challenge after the game.\n\n\u201cObviously on that play, we had a great view of it and they called it an incompletion, so it was such a big play in the game, you have to use your flag there \u2026 to get the call correct,\u201d Garrett said. \u201cI knew we were going to have to use it again to correct the error.\n\n\u201cApparently he didn\u2019t like how I threw the flag.\u201d\n\nMore: 32 things we learned from Week 5 of the 2019 NFL season\n\nOfficial Ron Tolbert told a pool reporter after the game that Garrett\u2019s language, not the flag throw, warranted the 15-yard penalty enforced on an otherwise 27-yard gain.\n\n\u201cObviously,\u201d Garrett said, \u201cI didn\u2019t handle the situation as well as I should have.\u201d\n\nHis players could not have handled the accompanying penalty yards much better.\n\nFacing first-and-25, Prescott completed a pass 27 yards deep left to running back Ezekiel Elliott as time expired in the third quarter. He hit Tavon Austin and tight end Jason Witten on the two next plays for 13 yards a piece. Prescott lucked out with a false start that negated a fumble by him and two defensive penalties that negated an end zone interception on a pass intended for Randall Cobb. The Cowboys capitalized on the Packers' mistakes as Elliott punched in a 2-yard score to narrow what earlier had been a 28-point deficit to 14.\n\nPrescott lauded his teammates\u2019 response but said he wouldn\u2019t speak much on the penalty his coach incurred.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got our coach\u2019s back,\u201d Prescott said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say too much on that. That\u2019s a guy being passionate about his team, passionate about the play. All I saw was him, \u2018Hey, here\u2019s the challenge flag. I know that\u2019s a catch.\u2019 A flag comes after that.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve just got to be careful what I say.\u201d\n\nElliott said even though the officials \u201cweren\u2019t perfect\u201d and \u201cweren\u2019t great,\u201d he doesn\u2019t believe they shoulder any share of blame for the outcome of the game.\n\n\u201cHonestly, just don\u2019t ask me about any officiating questions,\u201d Elliott said after posting 91 total yards and a touchdown. \u201cI\u2019m never going to be the guy to go out there and be like, \u2018Hey, we lost because of the refs.\u2019\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, we\u2019ve got to look in the mirror as a team and realize that we shot ourselves in the foot too many times.\u201d\n\nFollow Jori Epstein on Twitter @JoriEpstein.\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.
