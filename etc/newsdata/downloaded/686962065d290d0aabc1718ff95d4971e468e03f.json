I used to take her to play neighbourhood teams on Sundays,\" he said.\n\nsentifi.com Market voices on:\n\n\"Most teams refused to play against her.

Both of them are inspired by their sister. I just hope she plays for national team for a long time and is part of the first Indian women's team to win the World Cup,\" he said.\n\nAFP", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Life & Culture - [NEW DELHI] India's 15-year-old women's cricket sensation Shafali Verma had to get her hair cut like a boy so that she could get into the local academy to train, her father told AFP. .
