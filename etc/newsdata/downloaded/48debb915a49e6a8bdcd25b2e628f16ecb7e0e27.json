(AP) - When musician and historian Mike McCarthy parked his car outside The Antenna Club, Memphis\u2019 first venue dedicated to fans of underground and hardcore rock, for the first time, he was a wayward rural teen, well out of his element.\n\n\u201cThis guy with a mohawk, we see him turn the corner at Avalon, and he walked into the club,\u201d McCarthy said.\n\n\u201cAnd we think, \u2018Oh, wow! Look at that guy. That guy\u2019s going to beat the hell out of us tonight. I know it.\u2019 That guy ended up being our waiter, serving us drinks.\n\n\u201cWe thought we were punk rock in Mississippi. When we got to The Antenna Club, it was another step on the way to understanding what the culture was like.\u201d\n\nMcCarthy, now 56, was instrumental in coordinating with the Shelby County Historical Commission to honor the club where he came of age. With the commission, the club\u2019s former owner Steve McGehee, musicians and fans, McCarthy helped unveil a marker outside the former club, which is now events space The Renaissance.\n\nThe opportunity to commemorate the history while major players were still alive and the structure still stands was a major sticking point for McCarthy.\n\n\u201cMy affiliation with historic markers, as I\u2019ve seen in the last 30 years, is that you put up a historic marker when it\u2019s too late - when there\u2019s nothing there but a parking lot,\u201d McCarthy said.\n\nShelby County Historian Jimmy Rout III announced in front of a crowd of onlookers at the marker dedication ceremony that the commission jumped at the opportunity to honor the former punk rock palace with a marker.\n\n\u201cThis is culturally significant. It has a definite cultural, historical value in this county,\u201d Rout said. \u201cWe, of course, unanimously approved it.\u201d\n\nMcGehee opened The Antenna Club in 1981, three years after the Sex Pistols performed in the nearby Taliesyn Ballroom. The concert signaled, for many Memphis music fans, a change in tastes. And bands interested in playing the cutting-edge style of music were looking for places to play.\n\n\u201cAfter the Sex Pistols played, it spawned a new generation of music that was DIY,\u201d McGehee said.\n\n\u201cI would go to clubs in Atlanta and New York and see that it didn\u2019t have to be polished and clean with tablecloths and all that. The punk and new wave scene, whatever you wanted to call it, were in mostly little (holes in the wall), and I knew I could do that.\u201d\n\nWhen popular underground music club The Well was going out of business, McGehee took the opportunity to start his own venue in the building, catering to a similar demographic.\n\n\u201cThe idea was to have TVs all around the room and have Rock American video tapes,\u201d McGehee said.\n\n\u201cThose were very instrumental in shaping a lot of musicians around town, because they were able to see stuff going on around the world. Thus, the name The Antenna.\u201d\n\nMcGehee ran the establishment for a decade, before passing it on to his brother. In 1995, the doors would close.\n\n\u201cTen years of dealing with all that and really not making any money, when you\u2019re single, you can squeak by. But when you\u2019re married, you start having burnout. That was the determining factor for me,\u201d McGehee said.\n\nOther factors included new clubs drawing their crowd and their acts and, according to McGehee, a recurring battle with authority.\n\n\u201cI had constant problems with the cops. A lot,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe were very vilified back then by the government and the police. As you could imagine, in \u201881, kids with mohawks and colored hair wearing black leather and all that hanging out in front of the club, they were scared of us. They thought we were in there killing each other.\u201d\n\nDespite what might have been a contentious relationship in the 1980s, police blocked through traffic on Madison in order to facilitate the dedication of The Antenna\u2019s historical marker, guiding vehicles around the mass of partygoers who attended the event.\n\nU.S. Rep. Steve Cohen (TN-D), who provided legal counsel for the club during the years of its operation, spoke to its place in Memphis\u2019 rock and roll history.\n\n\u201cThis was Sun Records of the 1980s,\u201d Cohen told the crowd. \u201cThis was a change in music that wasn\u2019t accepted by Memphis, but came here and gave Memphians and Midtowners a music that otherwise they wouldn\u2019t have had, that was going around the country.\u201d\n\nMcCarthy, who in June unveiled a statue of Johnny Cash outside the site of his first paid performance, told guests at the ceremony he will continue his charge to preserve Memphis\u2019 music history.\n\n\u201cThe more history that we save, the more respect that we earn,\u201d he said, \u201cespecially since we created rock and roll.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Daily Memphian, http://https://www.dailymemphian.com/\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "When musician and historian Mike McCarthy parked his car outside The Antenna Club, Memphis' first venue dedicated to fans of underground and hardcore rock, for the first time, he was a wayward rural teen, well out of his element.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jared Boyd", "The Daily Memphian"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/12/exchange-punk_bar_18828_c0-195-3300-2120_s1200x700.jpg?cb9eebe07484759fb66ed10f73d4fca3f6ae98e9", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
