But it was Nadella\u2019s interview with Wired that really stood out. \u201cWhat is most important for us is the app model and the experience,\u201d revealed Nadella, further cementing that Windows has slipped down the importance list at Microsoft. \u201cHow people are going to write apps for Duo and Neo will have a lot more to do with each other than just writing a Windows app or an Android app, because it\u2019s going to be about the Microsoft Graph.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s right, of course, and it\u2019s something that Microsoft has been signaling since Nadella took over as CEO more than five years ago. Nadella reshuffled Microsoft\u2019s Windows division last year, leading to the departure of former Windows chief Terry Myerson and the core development of Windows being moved to a cloud and AI team. I wrote \u201cMicrosoft is ready for a world beyond Windows,\u201d last year, and many of the points are even more relevant today.\n\nWindows is still a significant part of Microsoft\u2019s business, but it\u2019s not the future of it. Nadella is signaling that by focusing on the Microsoft Graph, a collection of APIs that connects devices to Microsoft\u2019s cloud services and acts as an important gateway into Windows, Office 365, and Azure. It looks like Microsoft is partnering with Google to connect this Graph deeper into Android.\n\nMicrosoft was vague on the details of its partnership with Google during its Surface event, but the company did announce a new Surface Duo phone running Android. It\u2019s a significant shift, and a return to smartphones for Microsoft, just without Windows this time. Microsoft is now an Android phone maker, and the company\u2019s chief product officer, Panos Panay, was happy to reveal why during an episode of The Vergecast this week. \u201cBecause there [are] hundreds of thousands of apps, and you want them,\u201d explained Panay. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty simple. Like, literally, you need the apps.\u201d\n\nAnother smartphone running Windows would have flopped without these key apps, and Microsoft has now turned to Google to get access to the Play Store and perhaps a little more. Microsoft has hinted that it\u2019s working directly with Google on dual-screen devices for Android, and some additional API work to improve the experience.\n\nThat could mean Microsoft is adopting Android in a way that it will contribute back to the Android Open Source Project (AOSP), similar to how the company has adopted and is improving Chromium. If that\u2019s the case, then it really looks like Microsoft\u2019s future is built on Google\u2019s code, but Panay doesn\u2019t seem to think Windows isn\u2019t important anymore.\n\n\u201cNo, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,\u201d says Panay in response to the possibility of Android being the future for Microsoft. \u201cYou want to give customers what they want in the form factor that they\u2019re using. We\u2019ve learned this \u2014 let\u2019s put the right operating system on the wrong product or the other way around. But what\u2019s the right operating system for the form factor? And in this case, on mobile devices, Android\u2019s the obvious choice. But anything [bigger than] that, Windows is everything.\u201d\n\nWindows is still important for people using it right now, but Nadella knows it won\u2019t be soon. Corporate customers still rely on Windows for legacy desktop apps, Microsoft Office, and much more, but elsewhere the majority of computing has shifted to mobile. Apps are increasingly becoming more cross-platform, and relying on web technologies instead of native operating system hooks. Microsoft followed this trend with its many Android and iOS apps, and by bringing Office to the iPad nearly five years ago.\n\nMicrosoft is now focused on ensuring things like Office and Microsoft Teams shine on every operating system. That does mean that developing and improving Windows is less important for the company, but improving Android and Chromium so that Microsoft\u2019s apps and services can run better is an obvious move. Panay calls this \u201ccreating APIs that create magical experiences across dual screens,\u201d and if Microsoft is successful, then it could mean we\u2019ll see far greater integration between Windows and Android than exists today.\n\nHow Microsoft achieves that with Google remains to be seen, but Nadella is describing it as \u201can app model that spans experiences across devices.\u201d Microsoft revealed the bare minimum of details at its Surface event, promising more software information in the coming months and at the company\u2019s Build developer conference. If Google is willing to open up Android to more Windows integration, then you can guarantee it will want more access to Windows as part of the deal.\n\nMicrosoft has already embraced Android as the mobile equivalent of Windows, so if this partnership is done correctly then maybe we\u2019ll see better Google apps on Windows, or Microsoft allowing Windows 10 users to search Google from Windows search. Microsoft has tried to force its defaults in Windows for many years, and Google went out of its way to thwart Windows Phone and Microsoft\u2019s Edge browser work. It\u2019s about time both Google and Microsoft offered the best solution for its mutual customers.\n\nNadella\u2019s not-so-subtle hints about the future of Windows won\u2019t mean much right now, but it\u2019s clear Microsoft will increasingly partner and make sure its apps, services, and even hardware work best no matter what operating system runs underneath. Windows is by no means dead, but it\u2019s gradually slipping down Microsoft\u2019s list of priorities.", "description": "Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has signaled that the operating system is far less important than apps and services.
