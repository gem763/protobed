A public consultation started last Friday.\n\nThe Real Estate Developers Association has urged the government to consider putting the tax on hold, saying it would intensify a slowdown in the property market already buffeted by the US-China trade war and social turmoil which looked set to enter its 16th consecutive weekend.\n\nRazack said the bill had been under scrutiny in a Legco committee since before the anti-government protests broke out in June, and lawmakers had raised different suggestions.\n\n\u201cWe have called for them not to use the one-size-fits-all approach, particularly for flats priced over HK$10 million (US$1.3 million), \u201d he said. \u201cBut they haven\u2019t listened \u2026 what is Legco in eyes of this government?\u201d\n\nHe decried what he called an exercise in \u201cfake democracy\u201d, with the executive branch ignoring the legislature, and said he would write to Legco president Andrew Leung Kwan-yuen, also his party colleague, demanding more time for scrutiny of the bill.\n\nThe vacancy tax was announced in Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor\u2019s policy address last year, and is seen as a populist measure in a city that struggles to provide affordable housing.\n\nIt would target all newly completed flats left unsold and not rented out for more than six months in a year. Flats would be considered finished a year after the developer obtained an occupation permit. The proposed tax rate is equivalent to two years of rental income, calculated by government specialists and based on market rates.\n\nOfficials plan to bring the law into effect three months after Legco passes it, but the date is yet to be confirmed.\n\nThe controversial bill has gained support from pan-democrats, though they did not give full support to the government, which is under intense pressure over the protests, sparked by opposition to an extradition bill which it has since suspended and pledged to fully withdraw.\n\nCivic Party leader Alvin Yeung Ngok-kiu earlier said the developers\u2019 call for a pause on the tax ignored the severe housing crisis afflicting the general public.\n\nThis article Hong Kong government ignoring Legco on vacancy tax, says developers\u2019 lawmaker Abraham Razack first appeared on South China Morning Post\n\nFor the latest news from the South China Morning Post download our mobile app. Copyright 2019.", "description": "The man representing Hong Kong housing developers in the city\u2019s legislature has blasted the government for pressing ahead with a vacancy tax, saying it was not allowing adequate oversight.Abraham Razack said he would write to the president of the Legislative Council demanding more time for scrutiny.Razack", "authors": ["Kimmy Chung"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/vX18fhudpjj5YwrnxjdBvQ--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/south_china_morning_post_621/dcfdcdb26ee9154417b7750eb1c8148d", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
