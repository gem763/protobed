Major holiday destinations including Turkey and Greece also warned their hoteliers would suffer.\n\nTour operators selling customers transport, accommodation and excursions in a single package have been struggling for years due to the rise of budget airlines and cheap online competition from the likes of Airbnb.\n\nSome have carved out a niche in specialist trips such as safaris. But Thomas Cook struggled to adapt due in part to a $2.1 billion debt pile built up over a series of ill-fated deals. It had to sell three million holidays a year just to cover interest payments.\n\nThe company had agreed a 900 million pound rescue package with its banks and largest shareholder, China\u2019s Fosun (1992.HK), but lenders asked for an additional 200 million pounds to keep it operating through the winter.\n\nIn desperate meetings over the weekend, it failed to secure more funds, with the British government also refusing a bailout, judging it was not a good long-term bet.\n\nSecond largest shareholder Neset Kockar, a Turkish businessman, said the company would now be sold as a whole or in parts.\n\nEMERGENCY FLIGHTS\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson pledged to get stranded British travelers home, another headache for his government as it tries to negotiate a fiendishly complicated withdrawal from the European Union.\n\n\u201cIt is a very difficult situation and obviously our thoughts are very much with the customers of Thomas Cook,\u201d Johnson told reporters on a plane as he headed to the U.N. General Assembly in New York. \u201cWe will do our level best to get them home.\u201d\n\nThe UK\u2019s Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) said it had a fleet of planes ready to bring home the more than 150,000 British customers over the next two weeks.\n\nThomas Cook\u2019s German airline subsidiary, Condor, said there were 240,000 people booked on its flights awaiting a return home. Its flights are still operating for now, and it has asked the German government for a bridging loan. In Germany, insurance companies coordinate any repatriation.\n\nThere are around 50,000 holidaymakers affected in Greece, and around 35,000 from Nordic countries using Thomas Cook.\n\n\u201cI would like to apologize to our millions of customers, and thousands of employees, suppliers and partners who have supported us for many years,\u201d Thomas Cook Chief Executive Peter Fankhauser said.\n\nGrounded airplanes with the Thomas Cook livery are seen at Manchester Airport, Manchester, Britain September 23, 2019.

That was after some customers were briefly held in a hotel in Tunisia when staff asked for additional payments to be made.\n\nBut top destinations such as Spain, Greece, Turkey and the Canary Islands, where some hotels work exclusively with Thomas Cook, warned of a likely hit to their tourism industries.\n\n\u201cThis is an earthquake on a scale of seven, now we are waiting for the tsunami,\u201d Michalis Vlatakis, president of the Association of Travel Agents of Crete, told the Athens News Agency.($1 = 0.8016 pounds)", "description": "Hundreds of thousands of holidaymakers were stranded on Monday by the collapse of the world's oldest travel firm Thomas Cook , sparking the largest peacetime repatriation effort in British history.", "authors": ["Kate Holton", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190923&t=2&i=1432851222&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8M0CR", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
