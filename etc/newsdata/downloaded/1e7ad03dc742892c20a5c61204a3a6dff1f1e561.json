Our leaders\u2019 official actions should not be about politics. Those two things need to remain separate. Once those in control of our government use it to advance their political goals, we become just another of the world\u2019s many corrupt countries.\n\n'America is better than that,' Carlson and Patel wrote.\n\nDespite the critique of Trump's actions, Carlson said that 'it's hard to argue' that Trump's call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky is an impeachable offense.\n\nDespite saying that Trump (left) shouldn't have asked Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky (right) to investigate Joe Biden, Carlson and Patel said it was not an impeachable offense\n\n'The president did not, as was first reported, offer a quid pro quo to the Ukrainians. He did not condition any U.S. support on a Biden investigation. The Justice Department has already looked at the totality of the call and determined that Trump did not break the law,' Carlson and Patel wrote.\n\nCNN analyst Abby Phillip said that the op-ed was 'a pretty transparent effort to provide a roadmap for Republicans looking for a way to publicly condemn Trump's actions but still oppose impeachment.'\n\nCarlson and Patel's op-ed was posted just hours before prominent Republican Mitt Romney criticized the president on Twitter, saying that asking the Ukraine and China to investigate Joe Biden was 'wrong and appalling.'", "description": "'Donald Trump should not have been on the phone with a foreign head of state encouraging another country to investigate his political opponent, Joe Biden,' Tucker Carlson wrote in an op-ed.", "authors": ["Maxine Shen For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/01/19348092-0-image-a-5_1570323170036.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
