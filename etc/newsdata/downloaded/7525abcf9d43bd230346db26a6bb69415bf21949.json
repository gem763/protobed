It lost some 11,000 fighters in the years-long war before recapturing the last piece of Isis territory in March.\n\nThere are now grave concerns that Turkey\u2019s offensive could affect the security around Isis prisons and camps, home to some 18,000 militants and more than 70,000 refugees.\n\nThe SDF has said it is has had to withdraw some soldiers and redeploy them to defend against Turkey, raising fears that Isis sleeper cells could try to attack the prisons and liberate those inside.\n\nA spokesperson from the group called Mr Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw a \u201cstab in the back\u201d.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

AFP/Getty\n\nMr Trump\u2019s abrupt policy shift, announced following a late night phone call with Mr Erdogan on Sunday, surprised even close allies and set into motion a new round of conflict that most US military officials had thought unavoidable. The president did not give advance notice of his policy shift to Washington\u2019s allies in the anti-Isis coalition.\n\nDespite calls for caution from the international community, Turkey quickly pressed ahead with preparations for a military operation.\n\nDefending his decision on Wednesday, Mr Trump said that \u201cfighting between various groups that has been going on for hundreds of years. USA should never have been in Middle East.\u201d\n\n\u201cMoved our 50 soldiers out. Turkey MUST take over captured ISIS fighters that Europe refused to have returned. The stupid endless wars, for us, are ending!\u201d he wrote.\n\nAs the Turkish military amassed on the other side of the border, the Syrian Democratic Forces called on the US-led anti-Isis coalition to implement a no-fly zone over northeast Syria.\n\n\u201cTo protect people of NE Syria from an imminent humanitarian crisis, we call on the coalition and the international community for the implementation of a No Fly Zone as was done in the past for the people of Iraq,\u201d said a statement from the SDF\u2019s official Twitter account.\n\nThe civilian administration affiliated with the group called for a \u201cgeneral mobilisation\u201d along the border with Turkey.\n\n\u201cWe call upon our people, of all ethnic groups, to move toward areas close to the border with Turkey to carry out acts of resistance during this sensitive historical time,\u201d said the local authority, known as the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria.\n\nIt remains unclear exactly how far the Turkish operation will go. Ankara says it aims to implement a \u201csafe zone\u201d some 20 miles deep into Syria, stretching from the Euphrates river to the eastern border with Iraq.\n\nWestern diplomats have told The Independent that they expect a Turkish operation may at first be limited to a smaller geographical area between the towns of Tal Abyad and Ras al-Ayn. But some believe Mr Erdogan may go further.\n\nThough the speed of Turkey\u2019s preparations have taken the international community by surprise, a Turkish incursion into Syria has been on the cards for some time.\n\nThe alliance between the US and the Kurds has always infuriated Ankara, which considers the SDF a terrorist organisation for its links to a banned Kurdish separatist organisation inside Turkey. It has pressured the US to drop its commitment to the group and allow it to take responsibility for ensuring the complete defeat of Isis.\n\nThe presence of some 1,000 US troops in northeast Syria, working alongside the SDF, had acted as a deterrent for any Turkish attack. Mr Trump\u2019s decision to move those troops away from the border and make it clear that the US would not stand in the way of a Turkish offensive has accelerated Turkey\u2019s plans.\n\nUS allies were apparently caught off-guard by Mr Trump\u2019s announcement. British officials told The Independent that they had no advance warning of the withdrawal. Coalition forces on the ground also said they heard about the policy change in the news.\n\nThe British government said on Tuesday that it opposed any Turkish operation inside Syria, and denied a claim by Mr Trump that the UK was \u201cthrilled\u201d with the president\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cWe have been consistently clear with Turkey that unilateral military action must be avoided as it would destabilise the region and threaten efforts to secure the lasting defeat of Daesh [Isis],\u201d foreign office minister Andrew Murrison told parliament.\n\nThe move has drawn heavy criticism from senior Republicans. Senator Lindsey Graham, a strong Trump ally, accused the president of \u201cabandoning\u201d the Kurds. Following the start of the Turkish bombing, Mr Graham said he would lead efforts in congress \u201cto make Erdogan pay a heavy price\u201d.\n\nIran\u2019s president, Hassan Rouhani, also called on Turkey to show restraint.\n\n\u201cWe have openly said that the only solution to ensure safety and security in southern Turkey and northern Syria is the presence of the Syrian army,\u201d state news agency IRNA quoted him as saying on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWe are calling on our friendly and brotherly neighbour Turkey to act with more patience and restraint, and to revise its decision and chosen path,\u201d he said.\n\nVideo from near the border on Wednesday showed large tents being erected to deal with an anticipated wave of displacement from the fighting.", "description": "Turkish jets launched a barrage of airstrikes against Kurdish fighters in\u00a0Syria\u00a0on Wednesday, as the country\u2019s president announced the beginning of a long-threatened offensive.\u00a0 As the first bombs hit their targets,\u00a0Turkey\u2019s\u00a0Recep Tayyip Erdogan took to Twitter to declare the start of an operation he said was aimed at destroying a \u201cterror corridor\u201d across his", "authors": ["Richard Hall"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/09/10/turkey-syria.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
