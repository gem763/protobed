After the first day, Johnson instead became the Invisible Man. Facing protests outside the building, Johnson walked away from a joint conference with Luxembourg\u2019s prime minister Xavier Bettel, who proceeded to give Johnson the empty-chair treatment:\n\nSky News reports that Johnson had thought the presser would be canceled if he declined to participate. The protests outside would make it impossible for their discussion to be heard:\n\nHis no-show, he claimed, was because he didn\u2019t want his points or that of Prime Minister Bettel to be drowned out by the noisy crowd. Number 10 sources claim they repeatedly asked for the press conference to be moved inside. Luxembourg said no. Why so? Did Mr Bettel see an opportunity? He certainly got one. \u2026 Mr Johnson was not there to challenge, to retort, to hit back or proffer a positive spin. The optics for the British were miserable.\n\nTom Newton Dunn, the political editor for the Tory-friendly Sun, also couldn\u2019t believe the optics. He also noted that Johnson had asked for the presser to be moved inside, and offered a more sympathetic take than the also-Tory-friendly Sky News:\n\nHaven\u2019t ever seen this before. Hard to think of anything more provocative by Xavier Bettel than pressing ahead with a press conference with two lecterns that you know Boris Johnson has pulled out of. pic.twitter.com/74Dh9N9y3k \u2014 Tom Newton Dunn (@tnewtondunn) September 16, 2019\n\nMaybe Johnson should have confirmed that cancellation, eh? Bettel looked genuinely bemused to be out there by himself, but even if Bettel snookered him, that was an amateurish mistake on the British PM\u2019s part. Never cede the optics, especially if one wants to look Hulk-ish in front of foes like Bettel:\n\nThe British leader told the Mail on Sunday that Britain would be like Bruce Banner, the mild-mannered physicist who can transform into the Hulk when angered. \u201cBanner might be bound in manacles, but when provoked he would explode out of them,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cHulk always escaped, no matter how tightly bound in he seemed to be \u2014 and that is the case for this country. We will come out on 31 October and we will get it done.\u201d \u201cThe madder Hulk gets, the stronger Hulk gets,\u201d he said.\n\nThe less-friendly Daily Mirror has a new nickname for Johnson: \u201cThe Incredible Sulk.\u201d They gave sharply critical report of Johnson\u2019s withdrawal and his overall mien at the EU meetings:\n\nBottler Boris Johnson was \u2019empty chaired\u2019 today at a humiliating Brexit press conference amid noisy protests following meetings with EU chiefs in Luxembourg. Protesters cheered and applauded as Luxembourg\u2019s PM Xavier Bettel challenged the absent Johnson over the UK\u2019s failure to produce practical solutions to the Irish border. Cowardly Johnson, who just yesterday compared himself to the Incredible Hulk, abruptly withdrew from the planned outdoor press conference, complaining it would be \u201ctoo noisy.\u201d Earlier, Johnson\u2019s motorcade was forced to crawl away from the PM\u2019s meeting with Jean-Claude Juncker, amid a hail of boos from protesters lining the narrow streets of Luxembourg.\n\nRegardless of how it came about, the optics of the empty podium were terrible for Johnson, especially given the rhetoric he used before the meetings began. He came to Luxembourg bragging about his ability to go toe-to-toe with the EU\u2019s assembled leadership. Instead, he got outboxed by Luxembourg, perhaps the first major world leader to have done so in a very long time, if ever.\n\nThe substance of the meetings weren\u2019t much better, either. Bettel ripped Johnson for demanding agreement on ideas without any actual proposals on the table, and insisted that the Theresa May Withdrawal Agreement is still the only formal proposal on the table. European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker seconded that sentiment, warning Johnson that the Irish backstop would remain until the UK solved the Irish border problem:\n\nJuncker told Johnson over lunch that he must present workable proposals to replace the Brexit backstop. \u201cPresident Juncker recalled that it is the UK\u2019s responsibility to come forward with legally operational solutions that are compatible with the Withdrawal Agreement,\u201d the European Commission said in a statement, referring to the deal struck by May. \u201cPresident Juncker underlined the Commission\u2019s continued willingness and openness to examine whether such proposals meet the objectives of the backstop. Such proposals have not yet been made.\u201d\n\nAs a parting shot, Bettel advised Johnson to emulate his hero Hulk. A little less talk and a little more action might be a better way to go, Bettel scolded:\n\nE.U. leaders have been sensitive to the idea that Johnson is laying the groundwork to blame them for the failure of Brexit. Bettel preemptively pushed back: \u201cNow it\u2019s on Mr. Johnson \u2014 he holds the future of all U.K. citizens and every E.U. citizen living in the U.K. in his hands. It\u2019s his responsibility.\u201d \u201cWe need written proposals and time is ticking. So stop speaking and act,\u201d Bettel said.\n\nIt\u2019s been well over three years since the Brexit referendum, and the Tories still don\u2019t have a plan to execute it, other than May\u2019s WA and crashing out. Despite all of Johnson\u2019s talk, it appears he doesn\u2019t have any other firm ideas about how to proceed either except to default to a no-deal Brexit and blame everyone else for it. Now that Parliament appears to have precluded the default, Johnson has walked himself into a trap of his own making.", "description": "EU to Boris: Maybe pipe down and propose a solution.", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/johnson-empty-podium.png", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
