Biron\n\nALEXANDRIA, Virginia, Oct 21 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - O n a recent Sunday, across the Potomac River from the U.S. capital, two pre-teen girls were dusting off a refurbished dresser near a busy road, stocked with fruit, canned goods, toothpaste, children's books and more.\n\nAmanda Santana and Anna Rissi, both 12, had placed the dresser in their Alexandria neighbourhood last year and attached written instructions: \"Take what you need, leave what you can\".\n\nAnd to their surprise, many have been doing just that. The area's residents regularly fill up the \"pantry\" with non-perishable food items, toiletries and toys to make them readily available - for free - to anyone who needs them, the girls said.\n\nTheir local project is part of the global Little Free Pantry movement, which gives those in need 24-hour access in their neighbourhood to food and other basic necessities they may not normally be able to afford.\n\nThe initiative's founder, Jessica McClard, modelled it off of the Little Free Library project, in which community members and businesses in more than 90 countries have built freestanding boxes in cities where the public can leave and take books.\n\nMcClard built the international project's first free pantry box in 2016, on the grounds of a church in Fayetteville, Arkansas, a state she said is perpetually one of the most food-insecure in the country.\n\nMany emergency meal providers have irregular hours, but the free pantries are open all day, every day, she said.\n\nAnd people can use the pantries privately and anonymously, avoiding the \"shame\" of using federal vouchers at a grocery store - something McClard remembers from having relied on food stamps earlier in her life.\n\n\"On the one side, there's need and shame and judgment,\" she said.\n\n\"And on the other, there's trust and compassion \u2014 more of a focus on community as opposed to individual responsibility.\"\n\nAs Santana and Rissi tidied their pantry in Alexandria, they recalled meeting a man who was using it recently.\n\n\"He said, 'Today for the first time in a very long time, I had a fresh tomato,'\" Santana told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. \"That made me smile.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nROOM FOR INNOVATION\n\nHunger in the United States spiked during the 2008 recession and has only barely recovered to previous levels, according to government data released in September.\n\nThe report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) showed that more than 11% of the population lived in \"food-insecure\" households last year.\n\nAnd the rate of hunger in the country is likely being exacerbated by other costs: According to 2017 research by Harvard University, households considered \"severely burdened\" by housing costs spend half of what other households do on food.\n\nIn the four years since McClard launched the Little Free Pantry movement - with the motto \"Feeding Neighbours, Nourishing Neighbourhoods\" \u2013 it has grown to 670 recorded projects, she said, adding the real figure could be triple that.\n\nThe idea has since been picked up across the country and abroad, with projects in Europe, Canada, South Africa, the Philippines, New Zealand and Australia, she said.\n\nLittle Free Pantries work best when built on private land that is publicly accessible, she added.\n\nNot only does such property often have fewer regulations than public land, but many churches, schools, businesses and community centres also have ample parking, an element of privacy and a built-in support network.\n\nNational anti-hunger organisations have taken notice.\n\n\"We appreciate that (the project) not only supplements our efforts, but also helps to raise awareness about the issue of hunger in America,\" said Zuani Villarreal, spokeswoman for Feeding America, a network of 200 food banks which in 2018 distributed 4.3 billion meals.\n\nPUSHBACK\n\nOne of the larger Little Free Pantry networks is in South Carolina, where two years ago Katie Dahlheim, motivated by what she said was a polarised atmosphere nationally, built four pantries out of old cabinets.\n\n\"I was trying to find something that was universal and everyone can agree on \u2014 and everyone has to eat,\" she said.\n\nSince then, the Lowcountry Blessing Box project has \"exploded,\" she said, and today numbers nearly 100 boxes spread throughout a third of South Carolina; two sister projects cover the rest of the state, Dahlheim noted.", "description": "Amanda Santana and Anna Rissi, both 12, had placed the dresser in their Alexandria neighbourhood last year and attached written instructions: \"Take what you need, leave what you can\".
