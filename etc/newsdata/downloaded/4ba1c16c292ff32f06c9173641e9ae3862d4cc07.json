There\u2019s a range of views in the parliamentary Labour party. But if we are going to have control of the date we\u2019ve got to bring the other opposition parties with us. I think we\u2019ll reach a consensus. But we\u2019ve got to block a no deal.\u201d\n\nMcDonnell said Labour wanted to back an election once the Benn bill seeking an extension to the 31 October Brexit deadline, had passed into law. He said: \u201cJeremy has said once the legislation is through we want a general election ourselves. We are consulting now, so it is all about timing. There\u2019s no tug of war within the Labour party. We are consulting now the other opposition parties.\u201d\n\nHe also accused Boris Johnson of behaving like a toddler in demanding an election now. He said: \u201cIf you\u2019ve been a parent, this is like dealing with two or three year old having a tantrum.. So you let them have their tantrum and you you have to be the grown up in the room. And the grown up in the room is saying, \u2018fine, have your tantrum, but we are not going to allow you take this country out on a no-deal Brexit, because you will undermine our economy", "description": "Late-night Lords vote commits peers to passing Benn bill by end of Friday, before parliament is suspended.
