the problem is that things are not getting better, at least not discernibly.\n\nHowever, I must say that, although this year has had many gloomy moments, a number of recent events have given me hope that we will turn the corner and create a society founded on mutual care and human solidarity.\n\n\n\nAs we climbed towards the summit of Kilimanjaro last month, I experienced and witnessed depths of human solidarity and generosity I had forgotten existed.\n\nAs a child growing up between Soweto and a small village in eSwatini, I was raised with the idea that it takes a village to raise a child.\n\nOur lives overflowed with experiences of kindness and generosity from neighbours.\n\nIn Soweto, when my mother was arrested for trading without a licence, leaving me with a newborn baby, the entire neighbourhood showed up to help look after us.\n\nAs we journeyed on Kilimanjaro, the experiences overflowed with similar boundless generosity and care.\n\nThe expedition itself was inspired by human solidarity \u2013 it was about inspiring the nation to donate sanitary pads to keep girls in school.\n\nClimbing for dignity and social justice, as we called it, was about ensuring that girls from disadvantaged families were not forced to leave school due to a lack of access to sanitary items during menstruation.\n\nI recall an incident on the mountain when a request for Diamox, a drug said to diminish the risk of altitude sickness, elicited half a dozen or so offers from fellow mountaineers.\n\nThis was a daily occurrence \u2013 every time you asked for a hand, you got an arm.\n\nSometimes you didn\u2019t even have to ask as an offer would be made purely because someone sensed your need.\n\nThis year\u2019s Social Justice Summit was another moment that renewed my hope regarding our commitment to ubuntu and related harmonious coexistence.\n\nThe Social Justice M-Plan was endorsed without reservation.\n\nA fourth key result area requiring leadership at all levels of society, incorporating societal contribution to building a capable state, was added.\n\nIf I\u2019m correct, we have reason to hope that tomorrow will be better than today, and that a caring society based on human solidarity will be a reality sooner than we think.\n\nThe first heart-warming surprise during the summit was an agreement between Professor Ben Turok, known for his left-wing leanings, and former president FW de Klerk about the ferocious impact of apartheid and its legacy.\n\n\n\nThen there was an agreement between fiery Wits University vice-chancellor Adam Habib and former Western Cape premier Helen Zille about the look and feel of the South Africa we want.\n\nZille had said that South Africa should reflect inclusiveness at all levels and all areas of life, and that, to achieve such, the legacy of apartheid needed to be dismantled.\n\nA third moment of hope came from two constitutional dialogues organised by students at Fort Hare and Rhodes universities.\n\nThere were no scenes of shouting and labelling like the ones we have come to expect in Parliament.\n\nI was struck by the quality of sociolegal analysis and rational discourse.\n\nI was also impressed by student concerns being beyond justice for themselves, or justice as \u201cjust us\u201d.\n\nThe themes were transformative constitutionalism and the impact of political party funding on democracy.\n\nThe deliberations transcended matters directly impacting on students, and mostly showed solidarity with groups and communities that are left behind.\n\nI was struck by an emerging sense of human solidarity that embraces diversity. At the core of these moments was transcending the devaluing of those who are not like us.\n\nI got a sense that we were turning the corner.\n\nI sense an emerging trend towards engaged citizenship with a global citizenship twist.\n\nI also sense emerging civic activism that transcends demanding accountability from the state, with citizens taking action to fix what they can while exercising social accountability to ensure government operates constitutionally.\n\nThe hope-inspiring moments also suggest the emergence of transformative constitutionalism beyond the courts.\n\nIf I\u2019m correct, we have reason to hope that tomorrow will be better than today, and that a caring society based on human solidarity will be a reality sooner than we think.\n\nMadonsela is a professor and Law Faculty Trust chair in social justice at Stellenbosch University, and founder of the Thuma Foundati on and the Social Justice M-Plan", "description": "The prevalence of civic activism is transcending the need to demand accountability from the state.", "authors": ["Thuli Madonsela"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9360/3cddb3eca4b847709a25ccc38f9f24cd.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
