But we talked about Ellen [DeGeneres] at the end. And I know what the point of the question was, but we keep leaving some of these huge issues that impact families off of the question agenda at these debates. And really, it\u2019s journalistic malpractice to do that.\u201d\n\nCNN faced widespread criticism following the three-hour debate after Anderson Cooper used his last question to cite Ms. DeGeneres\u2019s recent dust-up with the left because of her friendship with former Republican President George W. Bush.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d like you to tell us about a friendship that you\u2019ve had that would surprise us and what impacts it\u2019s had on you and your beliefs,\u201d Mr. Cooper asked.\n\nMr. Castro and fellow candidate Sen. Kamala Harris called out the question on Twitter, complaining that more significant topics like climate change and immigration had been ignored.\n\n\u201cThree hours and no questions tonight about climate, housing, or immigration. Climate change is an existential threat,\u201d Mr. Castro wrote. \u201cAmerica has a housing crisis. Children are still in cages at our border. But you know, Ellen. #DemocraticDebate.\u201d\n\nMs. Harris wrote, \u201cThree hours. Not one question about the climate crisis. Not one question about LGBTQ+ rights. Not one question about immigration. These issues are too important to ignore. #DemDebate.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
