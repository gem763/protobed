He was very shy.\u201d\n\nInstead, Harry Kane decided to make his acquaintance with his new team-mates out on the football pitch. \u201cIt was a long throw from the goalkeeper,\u201d Dunne recollects of a cold winter\u2019s training session that still burns bright in his memory. \u201cI misjudged it slightly and the ball went over my head. And the next thing I know, he had volleyed it. Struck it in one clean movement. You know that Marco van Basten goal, in the Euro 1988 final, against the Soviet Union? It was like that. Straight into the top corner.\u201d\n\nDunne was by that point 29-years-old. He had played more than 300 professional matches for Millwall, across two different divisions. And he had seen dozens of loan players come and go. Yet he will always remember 2 January 2012. \u201cIt was one of the greatest goals I have ever seen in my life,\u201d he adds. \u201cAnd it was only his second day at the club.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

The hastily-arranged moves can be the making of young players. More often than not, they break them. But, in the winter of 2011, Leyton Orient had done their homework. \u201cOur training ground was very close to Tottenham\u2019s, so we always had a very good idea of the kind of young players they had coming through,\u201d Russell Slade, manager between 2010-2014, tells The Independent. \u201cAnd we already knew that he had serious potential.\u201d\n\nKane had been impressing the right people. The season previous, he scored 18 goals in 22 appearances for Alex Inglethorpe\u2019s Under-18 team, attracting the attention of Harry Redknapp, who twice named him on his first-team bench. But his path to senior football was blocked by the likes of Jermain Defoe, Peter Crouch, Roman Pavlyuchenko and Robbie Keane. And so, on 7 January, he agreed to make the five-mile journey from White Hart Lane to Brisbane Road on a short-term loan.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. 100-81: Century countdown Show all 21 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

His defensive capabilities brought him to the fore at Barcelona before his attacking prowess made him such a weapon for Manchester City. He won two Ligas, three Premier Leagues, one Champions League, captained Ivory Coast to the Africa Cup of Nations and was African Player of the Year four times. LO Getty Images 3/21 99. Harry Kane His raw statistics are simply phenomenal. 130 Premier League goals for Tottenham Hotspur, in just 186 appearances. 27 in 42 for England. Twice a Premier League Golden Boot winner. A World Cup Golden Boot winner. Tottenham\u2019s talisman. England\u2019s captain. And still just 26 years old. In 10 years\u2019 time, expect to see Kane in the top 20 of a similar list. LB Getty Images 4/21 98. Daniele De Rossi A ferociously competitive and combative midfield hard man, who made over 600 appearances for his beloved Roma and over 100 for his national team. A complete midfielder, who could in one passage of play win the ball, race forward and either release a team-mate with a pinpoint pass or score himself. And do not be fooled by his combustible reputation: in 2016, he placed his treasured World Cup winner's medal in the coffin of Pietro Lombardi, Italy\u2019s kit man at the tournament. LB AFP/Getty Images 5/21 97. Bastian Schweinsteiger The meticulous German orchestrated Bayern Munich's midfield to eight Bundesliga titles and a Champions League, making over 500 appearances for the club. He was also one of the leaders in Germany's 2014 World Cup-winning campaign and carried an aura in the centre of the pitch few players can claim to have replicated. TK Bongarts/Getty Images 6/21 96. Vincent Kompany It\u2019s difficult to define his importance to both Manchester City and Belgium but it\u2019s safe to say he was one of the most important players of a generation. There may well be a handful of technically better centre-backs but his intangibles were vital to the culture at club and country where there was not a legacy of winning previously. JR Getty Images 7/21 95. Karim Benzema One of the few strikers on this list who can truly claim to be the complete forward, able to play wide or central, deep linking play or on the shoulder of the last defender, with the ability to sniff out scrappy goals and score beauties too. His medal haul speaks for itself, and he is approaching 300 career goals. But for his strained relationship with the French national team, he would have scored even more. LO Getty Images 8/21 94. Sol Campbell The heartbeat of Arsenal's defence in the Invincibles season, a double-winner in 2002 and a mainstay of the England team for almost a decade, Campbell is one of the defining defensive figures of the Premier League era. TK AFP/Getty Images 9/21 93. Pepe One of the great villains of the game but a nasty, hard centre-back that would be very high on any great striker\u2019s list of defenders he least wanted to play against.

JR Getty Images 10/21 92.

TK Getty Images 11/21 91. Arturo Vidal Only the finest players in the world enjoy long and fruitful stints at clubs such as Juventus, Bayern Munich and Barcelona. Il Guerriero has matured into a splendid holding midfielder, aggressive and dominant in the middle of the pitch but equally as effective arriving late into the box to complete attacks. A hero in his native Chile, for his role in the 2015 Copa Am\u00e9rica victory. LB Bongarts/Getty Images 12/21 90. Angel di Maria A key player in the glorious Real Madrid side that won La Liga in 2011/12 and the Champions League two seasons later. Widely considered a flop when he left Manchester United after only one miserable season, but the Argentine completely reinvented himself at Paris Saint-Germain, the starring attraction in one of the most expensive squads ever assembled, containing the likes of Neymar, Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 and Edinson Cavani. LB AFP/Getty Images 13/21 89.

LO AFP/Getty Images 14/21 88. Radamel Falcao In his pomp Falcao was probably the best striker on the planet. In a prolific four-year spell playing for Porto and Atletico Madrid he scored 142 goals in 178 games, and had injuries not hindered his career there is little doubt that Colombia's record scorer would be much higher up this list. LO Getty Images 15/21 87. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang Has excelled in a thoroughly mediocre Arsenal side for two seasons now, scoring at a rate better than a goal every other game in a side that has struggled since the departure of Ars\u00e8ne Wenger. But it is primarily for his achievements at Borussia Dortmund that he makes this list. He scored close to 150 Bundesliga goals for that wonderfully attacking team \u2013 including 31 in one season \u2013 winning the Bundesliga Player of the Year and Top Goalscorer awards. There have been few strikers as rapid or as decisive in front of goal in the last two decades. LB Bongarts/Getty Images 16/21 86.

LO Getty Images 17/21 85. Carlos Tevez A real pest of a striker who thrived in the hottest atmospheres and regularly overcame adversity.

JR Getty Images\n\nIt was his first spell away from Tottenham Hotspur since the age of 11. Kane\u2019s long and winding journey through the depths of English football was about to begin.\n\nSlade wanted to know what the quiet kid with a big reputation was made of. So he threw him in at the deep end. One week after arriving at the club, Kane was handed his first-team debut, replacing the 36-year-old veteran Scott McGleish away at Rochdale. \u201cI don't know what colour boots he had on, but let me tell you, the pitch was that much of a quagmire that by the time he came off it didn\u2019t matter, because you couldn\u2019t see his feet. It was an incredible experience for him and I am sure it really benefited him in the long run.\u201d\n\nIn the muddy trenches of third-tier football, Kane was forced to learn new skills to survive. Key to his current success is his unrelenting physicality \u2014 which helps to compensate for his relative lack of pace \u2014 but as a skinny teenager playing against grown men, Kane had to locate slithers of attacking space through different means.\n\n\u201cHe hadn\u2019t yet filled out physically and was probably eight stone wet through, but he could still lose somebody in a telephone box,\u201d Slade explains. \u201cAnd that\u2019s because his speed was in his head. He would lose defenders by a yard not through raw pace, but by thinking. If the defender marking him just peeked towards who was crossing the ball \u2014 even for a split second \u2014 he would lose them. Even at that age. He was so intelligent like that.\u201d\n\nHis uncanny ability to disappear into a defender\u2019s blindspot was something Dunne would learn in dramatic fashion on Millwall\u2019s Calmont Road training ground some twelve months later. He had done well on loan at Orient, scoring five times in 18 League One appearances and earning the trust of Slade, but it was at Millwall that his development really began to accelerate.\n\nKane may have kept himself to himself off the football field, a polite kid who would quietly slip away after training sessions, but playing regularly at The Den did not faze him. Twenty-seven appearances in all competitions. Nine goals. And winner of Millwall's Young Player of the Year award. The boy was growing into a man.\n\n\u201cHe was still a quiet lad even though he had been to Orient before he had come to us,\u201d Dunne says. \u201cBut he was a good lad, an honest lad, and you could tell that he had been brought up well. Sometimes you get lads who come in from other clubs who think that they are better than it all. But he knew what he wanted to do and did his talking on the pitch.\n\n\u201cThe Den can be an intimidating ground and players can freeze, especially young kids who come in and don\u2019t realise that the level you are playing at is actually very high and very competitive. But he had a special talent. You could just see it. He was a real old-fashioned centre-forward and the fans loved that, and even though he was never the quickest he had the brain. He had the intelligence and maturity of a player with so much more experience.\u201d\n\nKane returned to north London with very real hopes of breaking into the club\u2019s first team under new manager Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas. His summer started well enough, with a hat-trick against Southend United in a pre-season friendly and his first taste of Premier League football, as a late second-half substitute against Newcastle United. But following the arrivals of Emmanuel Adebayor and Clint Dempsey, for a combined \u00a311m, the club decided to send him back out on loan.\n\nOne week later, on 31 August, Kane joined Premier League rivals Norwich City for the rest of the 2012/13 campaign. Things went wrong almost immediately. He fractured the fifth metatarsal in his right foot on his second appearance, a Capital One Cup match against Doncaster Rovers, and was sent back to Tottenham to undergo his rehabilitation. He returned to Carrow Road after Christmas, only for Spurs to almost immediately recall him when it became clear they were not going to be able to sign a new striker in the January market.\n\nKane played just 226 minutes of competitive football for Norwich, failing to score a goal. But he nevertheless left a lasting impression in East Anglia.\n\nLeon Barnett, an experienced Premier League defender who joined Norwich from West Brom, often found himself pitted against the teenager in training. And, despite Kane\u2019s numerous struggles, Barnett found it impossible to assert his dominance over the 19-year-old.\n\n\u201cI would say I was always able to block a fair amount of shots that were hit towards goal, but I so rarely had the chance to block Kane\u2019s,\u201d he tells The Independent. \u201cHe was always taking such awkward shots. He would shoot early, and the ball would squirm through your legs, or deflect off your right toe or something. I could just never get to grips with him. I was never able to master where he was going to shoot, which meant I couldn\u2019t defend properly against him.\n\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t quick. He wasn\u2019t big. But he was difficult. And if you gave him the tiniest bit of space, he would kill you. To be honest, the level I was playing it, I just couldn\u2019t defend against him. And it\u2019s funny now, because not many defenders in the entire world can defend against him. He is one of the most deadly strikers in Europe.\n\n\u201cBut, to be honest, it was a frustrating time for him. And it was unlucky for us, because we never got to see the full potential of Harry Kane.\u201d\n\nFor all his potential, Kane returned to Tottenham with his tail between his legs. Yet he did not stick around for long. Ignored by Villas-Boas (\u201cI was not the best coach for Harry Kane,\u201d the Portuguese would later reflect), Kane agreed to his fourth final loan deal. In February, he joined Nigel Pearson\u2019s Leicester City, to assist the club\u2019s push for promotion.\n\n\u201cWhen he came to us, he was actually subbed quite a bit,\u201d remembers Paul Konchesky, an England international and Leicester City regular ever since his move from Liverpool, in 2011. \u201cBut he chipped in and worked so hard on his finishing every single day in training.\u201d\n\nIt was to prove another frustrating spell for Kane, who only scored twice as Leicester lost out to Watford in the Championship play-offs, but a player of Konchesky\u2019s immense experience recognised that Kane was a young loan player worth taking an interest in. \u201cIt can be tough for the loanees and often they keep their head down,\u201d he says. \u201cBut you never know, maybe a loan move will turn into a permanent deal. And I am sure, looking back, that Leicester would have liked to sign Harry Kane. As a senior player, it was your responsibility to help look after them. Especially somebody like Harry, who absolutely everybody could see worked very hard and wanted to be in the team. It was impossible not to want him to do well and be a part of it.\u201d\n\nKane\u2019s fourth loan move was to prove his last. The following season he was kept at White Hart Lane, eventually breaking into the first team under interim manager Tim Sherwood. He has never looked back. But those whose paths briefly crossed with the Tottenham talisman and England captain often do.\n\n\u201cLook, I never thought he would go on to do everything that he has achieved quite this quickly,\u201d adds Dunne, almost eight years on from the best goal he has ever witnessed. \u201cBut, yeah. I guess he was always special.\u201d", "description": "He barely spoke at first, an 18-year-old out of his comfort zone, thrown into an unfamiliar dressing room full of senior professionals he had never met. \u201cHe was a very quiet lad,\u201d Millwall\u2019s captain at the time, Alan Dunne, reflects now. \u201cHe didn\u2019t say much. He was very shy.\u201d", "authors": ["Luke Brown"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/14/09/harry-kane-orient.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
