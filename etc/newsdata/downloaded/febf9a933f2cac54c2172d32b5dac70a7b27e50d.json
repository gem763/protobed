Olsen Cruise Lines, made history on Wednesday as it became the largest ship to cross the Corinth Canal.\n\n(Image: Fred. Olsen Cruise Lines/Youtube)\n\n(Image: Fred.

Olsen Cruise Lines announced, \u201cThis is such an exciting sailing and tremendous milestone in Fred. Olsen\u2019s 171-year history and we are thrilled to have been able to share it with our guests.\n\n(Image: Fred. Olsen Cruise Lines/Youtube)\n\n(Image: Fred.

Olsen, we strive to create memories that last a lifetime, and with guests onboard Braemar able to get so close to the edges of the Corinth Canal that they could almost touch the sides, we know that this will be a holiday that they will never forget.\n\n\u201cWe have already had exceptionally high interest in our second Corinth Canal cruise, in Spring 2021, and we can\u2019t wait to do it all over again.\"", "description": "Passengers on the MS Braemar cruise ship could reach out and touch the sides of canal - which is 24 meters wide at its narrowest point", "authors": ["Rachel Endley", "Image", "Fred.
