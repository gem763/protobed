Just don\u2019t think he\u2019s sore over missing out on a deep October run.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n\u201cI made my decision, and that was my decision,\u201d Harper said, via The Athletic. \u201cYou know, jealousy isn\u2019t good. For me, it\u2019s about having the gratitude to go out and do what I do each day and not having an attitude towards anybody else.\u201d\n\nOf course, Harper has 330 million reasons to not feel jealous about his former team, but this is the most healthy way to deal with an assuredly awkward moment. Harper played with almost all of Washington\u2019s current players, and it\u2019s hard not to want the best for your friends, as he told Jayson Stark.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s about being able to be the person that I am and not saying to myself, \u2018Oh my gosh, I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m not a National.\u2019 Or, \u2018Oh my gosh, those guys are doing what they\u2019re doing. I can\u2019t believe it. I\u2019m so jealous.\u2019 No. I\u2019m so happy for them. You know how hard it is to get into the postseason and win games. For them to be able to put it together this year the way they have, it\u2019s an amazing thing.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning that the Nationals did not make the World Series because Harper left \u2014 even if the Ewing Theory may be funny here \u2014 they did so in spite of him being gone.\n\nThe Nationals made an effort to retain their star in the mildest way possible, offering him a $300 million contract that was filled with so many absurd deferrals lasting until 2052 that the present value was only $244 million. They felt able to do so because they already had three above-average outfielders in house, including one of baseball\u2019s best prodigies, Juan Soto, and another elite prospect, V\u00edctor Robles.\n\nThe Nationals may have been stronger this season with Harper but are probably better off in the long-term spending that money to retain Rendon or Strasburg. This is no case of addition by subtraction. It\u2019s the Nationals finally meeting the sky-high potential of their team after years of misfortune in the unforgiving and seemingly random MLB playoffs.\n\nPhillies right fielder Bryce Harper spoke publicly about the Nationals making the World Series for the first time.
