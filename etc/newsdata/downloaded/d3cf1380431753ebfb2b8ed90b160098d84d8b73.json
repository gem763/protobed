The youngest Hanson suffered three broken ribs, a broken collarbone and a cracked scapula.\n\nIn an Instagram photo, Zac is shown lying in a hospital bed with his eyes closed and his legs elevated. His brother Isaac has a reassuring hand on his leg\n\n\u201cWednesday I was involved in a wreck on my motorcycle while preparing for an upcoming cross-country ride,\u201d Hanson wrote. \u201cThough I ended up with three broken ribs, a broken collarbone, and a cracked scapula, nothing is injured that won\u2019t heal with a little rest and time, and a healthy dose of gaming!\u201d\n\nWhile Zac didn\u2019t share details of the crash, he counted his blessings, writing, \u201cThankfully with good quality protective gear, I was able to walk away, even if very slowly with the help of Isaac, Taylor, and a few of a Tulsa fire fighters.\u201d\n\nZac, 33, the youngest of the three brothers, shared that the band\u2019s upcoming concerts will not be cancelled, and instead rely on a replacement drummer, so that he can continue to heal from the incident.\n\nHe explained, \u201c We will not be canceling any concerts. Instead, I will be handing over the drum sticks to our good friend Dash Hutton @dashdrumdude for the next few weeks, and I will be giving my full attention to singing while my shoulder is on the mend.\n\nAccording to WebMD, scapula (shoulder blade) fractures occur more frequently in young men (25-45) \u2013 the primary causes of scapula fractures are athletic activities, motor vehicle accidents, and other forms of blunt trauma. Most fractures are treated without surgery, but can see the shoulder in a sling for three to four weeks \u2013 but with a broken collarbone, that treatment could extend to six to 12 weeks. Broken ribs can take about six weeks to heal, reports WebMD, and all of Zac\u2019s injuries require rest and lessened movement \u2013 which obviously means he\u2019ll have to put down the sticks for a few months.\n\nTwenty-two years ago, the band released one of the catchiest songs of the 90\u2019s, the irrepressible \u201cMMMBop\u201d. At the time of the release, Zac was only 11-years-old (his brothers Issac and Taylor were 16 and 14, respectively). They were actually even younger when they wrote the song, and released three records locally before landing a record deal with a major label.\n\nLast year Hanson spoke to Yahoo Entertainment about their career-retrospective double-album String Theory, and Zac opened up about growing up as a famous musician.\n\n\u201cWe had already experienced some trauma,\u201d Zac, said, referring to the challenges and sacrifices the brothers made to become famous. \u201cWe were seeing that we were outcasts.\u201d\n\nConsidering all the well-wishes from fans about his accident, it seems that Zac is just as beloved as he was in his youth.\n\n\u201cSo glad you\u2019re ok! Please get the rest you deserve,\u201d wrote one fan on Instagram.\n\nAnother wrote, \u201cThankful you\u2019re ok and that you have awesome people around you to help out. And super glad you\u2019re smart enough to get all the right gear for riding.\u201d\n\nSeemingly aware of the goodwill out there for him, Zac ended his post with a simple wish, writing, \u201cThank you for all the thoughts and prayers, hope to see many of you soon! -Z\u201d\n\nRead more from Yahoo Entertainment:\n\nWant daily pop culture news delivered to your inbox?
