USA TODAY\n\nFLORHAM PARK, N.J. \u2014 Kelechi Osemele says he\u2019s getting surgery, whether the Jets authorize it or not. It\u2019s just the latest development in a complicated injury dispute between the offensive lineman and the Jets.\n\nOsemele said he got a third opinion on the shoulder Tuesday in Boston, and that the doctor recommended immediate surgery on his torn labrum.\n\n\u201cHe informed me that it\u2019s pretty bad,\u201d Osemele said. \"It\u2019s torn off the bone and he needs to operate. So that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s scheduled an operation for Friday.\n\nOsemele hasn\u2019t played or practiced since Week 3 and requested the Jets authorize surgery on the shoulder weeks ago.\n\nThe Jets denied the request and since last week they\u2019ve been fining him for conduct detrimental to the team because he\u2019s missing practice. A source said the Jets believe Osemele is healthy enough to play through the injury and delay surgery until after the season.\n\nThe Jets did not comment on Osemele\u2019s decision to have surgery. Osemele said he still hasn\u2019t heard back from the team since he informed them of his decision to undergo surgery.\n\n\u201cWe sent them the full doctor\u2019s report this morning, so we don\u2019t know yet,\u201d Osemele said. \u201cThey have been cooperative, they have sent worker\u2019s compensation forms needed to get the surgery. So it is moving forward.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019re doing the best to do the right thing. So now that they\u2019ve done that it\u2019s really their decision whether or not they choose to authorize it or not, but I\u2019ve got to take care of my body, I\u2019ve got to take care of my health, I\u2019ve got a family, so I\u2019ve got to take care of myself.\u201d\n\nNFL TRADE DEADLINE: Seven deals that teams should make in 2019\n\nCOUNTDOWN IS OVER: Here are the top 100 players to ever play in the NFL\n\nKelechi Osemele of the New York Jets (Photo: AP)\n\nOsemele confirmed that the Jets have been fining him the maximum amount under the NFL\u2019s collective bargaining agreement: his entire game check, in excess of $579,000 per week. But Osemele said he\u2019s filed a grievance against the Jets through the NFLPA, and that he\u2019s confident he\u2019ll get his money back.\n\n\u201cLegally, when a player can\u2019t go and he\u2019s in pain and he has multiple doctor\u2019s opinions that say he needs surgery, a team can\u2019t just be like, \u2018You can\u2019t have surgery.\u2019\u201d Osemele said. \u201cYou can\u2019t do that. It\u2019s just ethically and morally wrong.\u201d\n\nIf the Jets don\u2019t authorize the surgery, Osemele would have to pay for it himself. Osemele\u2019s agents issued a statement to ESPN on Wednesday, saying that the Jets\u2019 insurance provider has approved the surgery and that if the team doesn\u2019t give the green light, \u201che will have all of his rights under the CBA enforced through the legal process.\u201d\n\nOsemele initially had two opinions on his injured shoulder, one from the Jets team doctor and another from an independent doctor. Osemele confirmed that the Jets sent a blank MRI to the independent doctor and then sent the wrong MRI, before finally getting the correct images there.\n\n\u201c(GM Joe) Douglas Tod me that was a mistake \u2026 it wasn\u2019t intentional or anything like that,\u201d Osemele said. \u201cIt was just an honest mistake trying to send the MRI, is what I was told.\u201d\n\nOsemele was adamant he needed surgery after the first two opinions. But got he got a third opinion earlier this week because he wanted to give the team a \u201cmore definitive opinion\u201d and be examined by a doctor in person.\n\nThe Jets wanted Osemele to keep playing because they believed his injury was a pre-existing condition and he\u2019d been playing through it all season, according to a source.\n\nOsemele said he first had pain in the shoulder Aug. 5, during training camp. He said he\u2019d been getting treatment on the shoulder ever since, even though he never showed up on the Jets\u2019 injury report. He also said he\u2019s been taking injections of the pain killer Toradol to play through the pain, but that the injections stopped working and he couldn\u2019t continue.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re at a point where it\u2019s like, \u2018Now what do I do? \u2018Do I take Vicodin?\u2019\u201d Osemele said. \u201cLike, where is the line? How much should a player play through pain? Where is the limit? Is there a limit? Like, am I just supposed to be in pain and miserable every day? Does my health not matter?\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s suspicion within the organization that Osemele only decided to have the surgery once he lost his starting job to Alex Lewis. Osemele flatly denied that.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d he said. \u201cThe decision was made before that (lineup decision) even happened, like during the bye week the decision was made. So that had nothing to do with it. And Alex is my best friend on the team. Like, we\u2019re boys. So it definitely has nothing to do with that.\u201d\n\nOsemele admitted it\u2019s been \u201cawkward\u201d coming to the facility every day while he\u2019s engaged in a dispute with the team. He compared it to \u201cwalking into a home where you\u2019re not supposed to be there and they don\u2019t really want you there.\u201d\n\nBut he said his teammates have been supportive of him throughout this strange situation.\n\n\u201c[They\u2019re] saying like, \u2018It\u2019s (expletive), sorry for what you\u2019re going through, I can\u2019t believe this is happening.\u2019 (Expletive) like that,\u201d Osemele said.\n\nAs for his future with the Jets, Osemele is certain there isn\u2019t one. Considering the injury-dispute animosity and Osemele\u2019s massive, $11.7 million in non-guaranteed salary in 2020, Osemele expects to be cut after the season.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d he said laughing. \u201c100 percent.\u201d\n\nFollow Andy Vasquez on Twitter @andy_vasquez", "description": "In the latest development in a complicated injury dispute between offensive lineman Kelechi Osemele and the Jets, he will have surgery no matter what.", "authors": ["Andy Vasquez", "Published A.M.
