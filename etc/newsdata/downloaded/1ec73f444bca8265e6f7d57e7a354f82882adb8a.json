The investigators were interested in what the ambassador knew and what his role was in the president\u2019s efforts to get Ukraine to probe former Vice President Joe Biden, Trump\u2019s political rival.\n\nSondland had apparently agreed to testify without a subpoena. Through his lawyer on Tuesday, he said he hoped \u201cthe issues raised by the State Department that preclude his testimony will be resolved promptly.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe stands ready to testify on short notice, whenever he is permitted to appear,\u201d Sondland\u2019s lawyer, Robert Luskin, said in a statement.\n\nState Department officials could not be immediately reached to comment on what issues had blocked his testimony.\n\nThe impeachment probe is focusing on a whistleblower\u2019s allegations that Trump used nearly $400 million in U.S. military aid to secure a promise from Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate Biden, a leading candidate for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. The whistleblower\u2019s legal team was in the final stages of talks for the intelligence officer to speak to both Democratic and Republican-led congressional intelligence committees as early as this week, congressional officials said.\n\nRepresentative Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House intelligence committee spearheading the impeachment probe, told reporters the move to block Sondland from testifying or turning over his text messages or emails was obstruction.\n\n\u201cWe will consider this act today ... to be further acts of obstruction of a coequal branch of government,\u201d Schiff told reporters.\n\nSondland was a key witness for the House Foreign Affairs, Intelligence and Oversight Committees, whose staff had been expected to ask him why he became involved in dealings with Ukraine, which is not a member of the EU.\n\nTrump has derided the impeachment inquiry and has denied he did anything wrong in a July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in which Trump pushed for an investigation of Biden and his son.\n\n\u201cI would love to send Ambassador Sondland, a really good man and great American, to testify, but unfortunately he would be testifying before a totally compromised kangaroo court, where Republicans\u2019 rights have been taken away, and true facts are not allowed out for the public....to see,\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter.\n\nAccording to text messages released by House committee leaders last week, Sondland was heavily involved in contacts with Zelenskiy as he sought a meeting with Trump, and Ukrainian officials expressed concern at the administration\u2019s decision to block U.S. military assistance for Kiev.\n\nIn one of the texts, for example, Sondland emphasized that Trump \u201creally wants the deliverable.\u201d\n\nFollowing the allegations that Trump pressured Zelenskiy to investigate Biden while withholding the military aid, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced a formal impeachment investigation last month.\n\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. Ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland poses ahead of a meeting with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and White House senior adviser Jared Kushner (unseen) at the EU Commission headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, June 4, 2019.

On Sunday, lawyers said a second whistleblower had come forward to substantiate that complaint.\n\nNEGOTIATIONS ON WHISTLEBLOWER TESTIMONY\n\nSondland\u2019s appearance would have followed officials, including the former U.S. special envoy for Ukraine, Kurt Volker, and Michael Atkinson, the inspector general of the U.S. intelligence community.\n\nAnother career diplomat, Marie Yovanovitch, is scheduled to meet with the committees behind closed doors on Friday. Yovanovitch was the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine until Trump recalled her in May before her term was up, after the president\u2019s supporters questioned her loyalty.\n\nCongressional staff and lawyers for the first whistleblower, a U.S. intelligence officer, are close to making final arrangements for the witness to speak to Congressional investigators away from Capitol Hill as early as this week, a source close to the parties said on Tuesday.\n\nThe first whistleblower\u2019s lawyers are in discussions with the Democratic-led House and Republcan-led Senate intelligence committees, a Congressional official said. All the talks include efforts to keep the whistleblower\u2019s identity concealed from committee members and the public.\n\nTrump has called for the whistleblower to be publicly identified.\n\nAsked whether House Republicans could take legal action to unmask the whistleblower\u2019s identity, Republican Representative Jim Jordan said: \u201cI think the American people have the right to know who the whistleblower is. But we\u2019re not going to do that.\u201d\n\nSlideshow (5 Images)\n\nThe impeachment inquiry has heightened bitter partisan divisions in Congress. Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans control the Senate where a trial on whether to oust the president would be held if the House ultimately votes to impeach him.\n\nThe White House was expected to tell Pelosi this week that it would ignore lawmakers\u2019 demands for documents until the House holds a vote to approve the impeachment inquiry.\n\nPelosi says a vote is not needed, although Democrats say the House would back the inquiry if there were a vote.", "description": "The Trump administration on Tuesday blocked an ambassador from testifying to the U.S. House of Representatives' impeachment investigation of President Donald Trump's dealings with Ukraine, drawing condemnation from Democrats leading the probe.", "authors": ["Richard Cowan", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191008&t=2&i=1438467686&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9710C", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
