In September, however, retail sales signaled a loud warning.\n\nSales at U.S. retailers fell in September, dropping 0.3 percent compared with the previous month, the Commerce Department\u2019s Census Bureau said Thursday. That ended a streak of six months of strong gains that fueled economic growth while exports declined and the U.S. manufacturing sector may have contracted.\n\nEconomists had forecast sales to grow 0.3 percent compared with a month earlier.\n\nSome of the expectations miss may be explained by the upward revision in the August figure, which now stands at a 0.6 percent monthly gain compared with the previously reported 0.4 percent gain. That indicates that some of the sales that were expected for September occurred a month earlier.\n\nA few economists have argued that the announcement of higher tariffs coming in September may have caused consumers to make purchases in August. That seems unlikely because consumer awareness of the coming tariff hike was unlikely high enough to significantly affect purchases.\n\nRetail sales were flat excluding gasoline and auto sales. That figure also missed expectations for a 0.3 percent gain.\n\nThanks to several months of strong gains, retail sales look less dire on an annual basis. Sales were up 4.0 percent compared with a year ago.\n\nSales at so-called \u201cnonstore retailers\u201d fell three-tenths of a percentage point but are up 12.9 percent from September 2018. These are mostly online retailers, indicating that Amazon and Walmart\u2019s website continue to gain against their traditional competitors. Some economists think the official retail sales numbers may be undercounting online retail sales and therefore undercounting overall sales in the official figures, although evidence for that is mixed.\n\nThe online sales could also be pulling down the overall numbers because of heavy discounting. The Census Bureau\u2019s figures do not take into account price changes. So if a consumer buys $100 of groceries in August at a traditional grocery store and then buys the same set of groceries the following month from, say, Amazon, for $95, retail sales will record a decline in total sales.\n\nSales fell 0.7 percent at gas stations. But that reflects a decline in the price of gasoline and can boost other segments of the economy, often with a lag, as households find they have more money to spend on other items.\n\nSales at car dealerships fell almost one percent, seemingly confounding reports that automakers have been selling more cars. The most likely explanation is that dealers have been heavily discounting cars.\n\nSales were down almost across the board with the exception of clothing retailers, where sales jumped 1.3 percent, healthcare stores and pharmacies, and furniture stores. The category of \u201cmiscellaneous stores\u201d\u2013which includes pet stores, thrift shops, and florists\u2013saw a half a percentage point rise in sales.", "description": "An unexpected decline in sales in September is a warning signal about the strength of the U.S. consumer. | Economy", "authors": ["John Carney"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-2108362-e1571237989332-638x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
