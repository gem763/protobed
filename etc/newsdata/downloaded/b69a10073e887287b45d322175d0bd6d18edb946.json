USA TODAY\n\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 As LeBron James spoke, the frustration in his tone and body language increasingly grew.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers star spent the past week on a preseason trip in China, and the concerns went beyond basketball. It also included the Chinese government and citizens taking offense to Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey tweeting out support for Hong Kong pro-democracy protesters just before the trip started.\n\n\"I don\u2019t want to get in a word or sentence feud with Daryl Morey. But I believe he wasn\u2019t educated on the situation at hand and he spoke,\" James said before the Lakers\u2019 preseason game against the Golden State Warriors on Monday at Staples Center. \"So many people could have been harmed, not only physically or financially, but emotionally and spiritually. Just be careful what we tweet, what we say and what we do. We do have freedom of speech, but there can be a lot of negative things that come with that too.\"\n\nLeBron James on how he felt the NBA handled the situation in China and why he didn\u2019t speak out pic.twitter.com/6DYCAs96IW \u2014 Mark Medina (@MarkG_Medina) October 15, 2019\n\nLeBron James on if Daryl Morey should be reprimanded for his tweet pic.twitter.com/6hCE8vCyNn \u2014 Mark Medina (@MarkG_Medina) October 15, 2019\n\nJames stressed that he did not consider Morey to be \"misinformed\" about his understanding of the Hong Kong protests. Instead, James believed Morey remained \"misinformed\" on how China would react to his tweet. James reiterated that message in a pair of tweets shortly after speaking to reporters.\n\n\"I believe he was misinformed or not really educated on the situation,\" James said of Morey. \"If he was, so be it. I have no idea, but that\u2019s my belief. When you say things or do things, you\u2019re doing it and know the things that can be affected by it and the families and individuals that can be affected by it. Sometimes it can be changed as well. Sometimes social media is not a proper way to go about things as well. That\u2019s just my belief.\"\n\nLet me clear up the confusion. I do not believe there was any consideration for the consequences and ramifications of the tweet. I\u2019m not discussing the substance. Others can talk About that. \u2014 LeBron James (@KingJames) October 15, 2019\n\nMy team and this league just went through a difficult week. I think people need to understand what a tweet or statement can do to others. And I believe nobody stopped and considered what would happen. Could have waited a week to send it. \u2014 LeBron James (@KingJames) October 15, 2019\n\nNBA Commissioner Adam Silver initially apologized for Morey\u2019s tweet and stressed that his remarks did not capture the league\u2019s views. Later on, however, Silver also defended Morey\u2019s freedom of speech.\n\nChina did not like the NBA\u2019s reaction. CCTV, a Chinese state-run television station, declined to broadcast the Lakers-Nets games in Shanghai and Shenzhen. Telecom company Tencent canceled Rockets coverage and all NBA preseason games. The Chinese government pressured the NBA to cancel an NBA Cares event with the Nets. Various Chinese companies have announced they will end partnerships with various NBA stars. Although the NBA still played a pair of preseason games, the league did not have any press conferences for Silver or either team.\n\n\"When you\u2019re misinformed or not educated about something \u2014 I\u2019m just talking about the tweet itself \u2014 you never know what the ramifications that can happen,\" James said. \"We all saw what that did.\"\n\nJames represented one of many NBA players that fielded criticism for refusing to condemn China\u2019s poor human rights record after being increasingly outspoken in recent years about President Donald Trump and his divisive rhetoric as well as when unarmed black men have been killed by law enforcement. James also opened the \"I Promise School\" in 2018, \"a public elementary school that his foundation supports for at-risk children\"\n\nCLOSE SportsPulse: Former NBPA Executive Director Charles Grantham lends his expertise while dissecting the situation between the NBA and China that has dominated the headlines in recent days. USA TODAY\n\nAs for China? The Hong Kong protesters have called for reforms within the police, government and voting system so they can choose their own representatives. Hong Kong became semi-autonomous in 1997 after it was no longer considered a British colony. The Chinese government remains concerned what the protests do to the country\u2019s national sovereignty. Meanwhile, China does not have a stellar human rights record.\n\nStill, James defended his silence on something he called a \"very delicate situation and sensitive situation.\"\n\n\"When I speak about something, I speak about something I\u2019m very knowledgeable about or something that hits home for me,\" James said. \"I felt like with this particular situation, not only was I not informed enough about it, I just felt like it was something that not only myself and teammates and organization had enough information to talk about in this point in time. We still feel the same way.\"\n\nJames spoke for the first time about the incident partly because of how the NBA responded to the controversy. The NBA declined to have any media availability leading up to and after the exhibition games in Shenzhen and Shanghai. During that time, James and a handful of other players spoke to Silver about their concerns.\n\n\"Adam has always been receptive about what the players, coaches and owners have comments about our league,\" James said. \"At that particular time, I thought he was very receptive as well. It\u2019s a tough situation for Adam. He had to put out a fire that he didn\u2019t create.\"\n\nThe unspoken reality: The NBA has built a lucrative business partly because of its business relationship with China after hosting preseason games there since 2006. USA TODAY Sports recently estimated the NBA makes about $500 million with this partnership, which ranges from ticket purchases, merchandise sales and television rights.\n\nAs for James? He just made his 15th trip to China after making annual visits with Nike to Beijing, Guangzhou, Shenzen, Shanghai, Wuhan and Xi\u2019an to promote both his shoe and the game. He has also hosted a coaching clinic (2011), a Nike event that encouraged sports participation (2012), the Nike Rise program (2014-15) and a clinic for China\u2019s Under-23 national team (2016).\n\nHas Morey\u2019s tweet put his potential earnings in China in jeopardy?\n\n\"That\u2019s not for me to understand or for me to worry about,\" James said. \"We have a hierarchy and we hired someone to figure that out. At the end of the day, only time will tell. None of us know. We\u2019re all in the unknown. We\u2019ll see what happens.\"\n\nFollow Mark Medina on Twitter @MarkG_Medina.", "description": "LeBron James said Daryl Morey was \"misinformed\" in his tweet about Hong Kong protesters, but clarified he meant in regards to the reaction.", "authors": ["Mark Medina", "Published P.M.
