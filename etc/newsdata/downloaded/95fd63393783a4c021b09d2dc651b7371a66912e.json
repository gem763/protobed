Underwear = not pants but long slips for under black tie dresses, as I understand.\u201d\n\nScottish Conservative Glasgow MSP Annie Wells said: \u201cFor any politician to think they can claim something like this on expenses is a joke.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not even one or two misdemeanours \u2013 these revelations show a pattern of behaviour which will be completely unacceptable to council tax payers in Glasgow.\n\n\u201cShe must now do the right thing and stand down \u2013 there\u2019s simply no way she can continue in this senior role after these reports.\n\n\u201cShe also owes the people of Glasgow an almighty apology.\u201d", "description": "Eva Bolander claimed \u00a3479 for 20 nail treatments among other spending.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/12/wire-19440790-1570535322-500_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
