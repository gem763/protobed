This follows a slew of disparate estimates on when the 5.7 million barrels per day of disrupted output would come back online. Reports of attacks on key production centers in Saudi Arabia had previously pushed oil prices to post their biggest intraday price gain on record on Monday.\n\nMeanwhile, analysts have debated whether the weekend\u2019s oil shock would give more or less room for the Federal Reserve to ease monetary policy further, with central bank officials set to kick off the first of two days of policy-setting deliberations Tuesday.\n\nMarket participants largely expect central bankers will deliver a second 25 basis point cut to benchmark interest rates at the conclusion of the September meetings on Wednesday. However, the probability investors have priced in for this outcome has trended lower in recent days, according to CME Group data.\n\nHigher oil prices put pressure on inflation overall, which has already shown signs of edging higher based on the most recent producer price and consumer price indices, Beth Ann Bovino, chief U.S. economist for S&P Global Ratings, said in a note.\n\n\u201cWhile the push-through of inflation from oil prices to core prices is small, the jump in overall prices, in combination with signs that core inflation is already heating up, may make it more difficult for the Fed to cut rates further,\u201d Bovino said. \u201cThey had a cushion to fall back on with lower inflation.\u201d\n\nTraders work on the trading floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., September 3, 2019. REUTERS/Andrew Kelly More\n\nOthers, however, argued that the fact that the circumstances generating the oil price rise \u2013 namely, heightened and now ongoing geopolitical tensions and uncertainty \u2013 creates, on net, a case for the Fed to cut rates further.\n\n\u201cAs with any supply side shock, including the ongoing tariffs the Fed is wrestling with, higher oil prices create a tension in the Fed\u2019s dual mandate,\u201d Matthew Luzzetti, Deutsche Bank chief U.S. economist, wrote in a note, referring to the Fed\u2019s mandate to promote both maximum employment and stable prices.\n\n\u201cHigher oil prices should, at least at the margin, exert a net drag on growth while at the same time lifting inflation and inflation expectations,\u201d he said. \u201cWith the Fed worried about too-low inflation and inflation expectations and downside risks to the growth outlook, on balance these effects should reinforce the Fed\u2019s already dovish bias.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, government data Tuesday showed the U.S. manufacturing and industrial production rebounded in August, helping stave off some concerns of further deterioration in the sector and pointing to resilience in even the more vulnerable patches of the domestic economy. Industrial production rose 0.6% during the month, versus a 0.2% gain expected. July\u2019s print was upwardly revised to show a reading of -0.1%, from -0.2% previously.\n\nSTOCKS: WeWork delays IPO, major Kraft Heinz investor sells more of its stake\n\nThe We Company, the parent-company of the shared-space leasing firm WeWork, has delayed plans to go public after struggling to drum up sufficient investor support.\n\nThe company issued a statement Tuesday saying that its initial public offering (IPO) would \u201cbe completed by the end of the year.\u201d\n\nPrior to the company announcement, recent reports had suggested WeWork was set to push ahead with an IPO as soon as this month, even after one of its biggest investors SoftBank lobbied the company to put off its go-public plans. WeWork was reportedly set to hit the public markets at a valuation of as low as $10 billion, according to Reuters, after earlier this year being valued at $47 billion following a private funding round from SoftBank.", "description": "U.S. stocks ended slightly higher while crude oil prices plunged nearly 6% at settlement after Saudi Arabia said it was on track to restore much of the oil production lost during a weekend attack on key facilities in the country\u2019s oil infrastructure.", "authors": ["Emily Mccormick"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/AX_eTwJDMrzke7VsA66sWg--~B/aD00NDgwO3c9NjcyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/dac40c20-d4d3-11e9-aff3-f827828cd63b", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
