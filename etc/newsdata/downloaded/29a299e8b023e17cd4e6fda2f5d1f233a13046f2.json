The outage affects mostly Northern California and parts of the San Francisco Bay Area. (Oct 9) AP, AP\n\nREDDING, California \u2013 The state's largest power company was turning the lights back on for more than 100,000 homes and businesses Thursday as improving weather conditions eased the wildfire risk in some areas.\n\nBut power remained out for almost 700,000 customers of Pacific Gas & Electric \u2013 about 2 million residents \u2013 as high winds and hot, dry conditions conspired to raise fire concerns through much of Northern California.\n\nThe utility warned that many of those homes and businesses might not get power back for several days. And power may be cut to more customers if weather forecasts and fickle Santa Ana winds start to shift.\n\n\"PG&E has now restored power to approximately 50,000 customers in the Sierra Foothills since the shutoff began,\" the utility said in a statement. \"Improving weather means patrols in some areas of Humboldt County have started. PG&E anticipates being able to restore power to 60,000 to 80,000 customers\" at some point Thursday.\n\nPreemptive outages are not entirely new. The California Public Utilities Commission this month shows that across all three utilities it regulates in California there have been more than 4 million customer hours of preemptive outages since the end of 2017.\n\nThe blackouts began early Wednesday with more than 500,000 homes. Almost 250,000 more homes were added later in the day and night.\n\nFor many, losing electricity is more than just an inconvenience. In nearby Anderson, Lisa Round started her car before going to bed so she could power her sleep apnea mask through the night. Without it, there\u2019s a chance she could stop breathing, she said.\n\n\u201cI ran my car so that I wouldn\u2019t die in my sleep,\u201d she said.\n\nAt Regency Place Senior Apartments, residents \u2013 some of whom are more than 100 years old \u2013 were told to ask their oxygen providers for extra supplies. Other residents have a variety of special needs, according to community manager Janet Applegarth-Yarbrough.\n\n\u201cI check on them several times a day because you just never know,\u201d she said.\n\nThe rolling blackouts could still expand. A third phase is being considered for portions of Kern County, home to Bakersfield. The improving weather conditions meant that only about 4,000 customers were involved, down from an estimated 43,000 earlier in the week, the company said.\n\nMillions more Californians were on edge as multiple utility companies weigh the risks of active transmission lines sparking a wildfire vs. the burden that shutting down those lines places on customers.\n\nPG&E is particularly sensitive to wildfire issues. The utility was forced to declare bankruptcy this year after being held liable for tens of billions in damages resulting from many of the dozens of deadly wildfires that flared in recent years because of downed power lines or other utility equipment.\n\nOutages: Here's what you need to know\n\n'PG&E clearly hasn\u2019t made its system safe: California lawmakers slam utility\n\nSouthern California was not exempt. Southern California Edison was considering plans to cut power to almost 180,000 homes and businesses, including almost 50,000 in Los Angeles County. San Diego Gas and Electric notified 30,000 customers that outages could be coming.\n\nDifficulties obtaining the latest information on outages was adding to concerns. Thousands of residents clicked links to utility company websites only to find them inaccessible. Pacific Gas & Electric alleviated some of its website overload by setting up an alternative page where people could find out their status.\n\nWebsites also flared up to the south, where Southern California Edison was considering plans to cut power to 18 communities.\n\n\"We're aware of intermittent issues,\" Southern California Edison said in a note on its website. \"If you experience an issue, please try again later. We're working to resolve the issue as soon as possible and apologize for any inconvenience.\n\nLate Wednesday, Cal Fire expanded its red flag warning toward the state's Central Valley, a 450 mile long stretch of the state's interior.\n\n\"There is a #RedFlagWarning that has expanded towards the central valley and is issued for most of Northern CA and the southernmost portion of CA from today until lateThursday evening, and even into Friday for some areas, due to strong winds/low humidity,\" Cal Fire tweeted.\n\nBacon reported from McLean, Va.\n\nA sign at Mary's Pizza Shack informs customers of the eatery's closure because of a PG&E power shutdown in Sonoma, Calif., on Oct. 9, 2019.
