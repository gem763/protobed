Adding to the good news for investors, one of the best-performing analysts believes that several catalysts could drive even more gains for semiconductor stocks.\n\n\u201cOur prevailing takeaway is that the multi-quarter inventory correction, which started in earnest in July 2018, is largely over and inventory levels have bottomed. Despite the near-term macroeconomic volatility, we believe there will be a number of catalysts in 2020 that will have a positive impact the semiconductor industry,\u201d Needham\u2019s Rajvindra Gill wrote in a note to clients on September 11.\n\nBearing this in mind, we used the TipRanks Stock Comparison tool to take a closer look at how a few of the stocks in this space stack up against each other. Our comparison was based not only on yearly gain, but also analyst consensus and average analyst price target.\n\nHere\u2019s what we found out.\n\nMicron Technology Inc.\n\nDespite widespread volatility throughout the semiconductor space, shares of memory chip provider Micron (MU- Get Report) have climbed 59% year-to-date, the highest out of the stocks on the list. Based on the improved outlook for the sector, even more gains could be on the way.\n\nAccording to Gill, the primary catalyst expected to drive growth for MU is an improvement in the memory cycle. Recently, MU experienced issues related to weaker DRAM and NAND demand and pricing as a result of higher inventories. DRAM, dynamic random-access memory, is used in desktop computers and servers, while NAND is flash memory that\u2019s typically found in smartphones and solid-state hard drives.\n\nIt should be noted that Needham\u2019s research suggests that while NAND and DRAM supply levels remain higher than normal, the memory cycle is improving. Additionally, while price declines are slowing down, the deceleration hasn\u2019t bottomed out with a normal supply and demand balance mostly likely expected through the first half of 2020. That being said, investors can expect a turnaround in 2020 thanks to several demand catalysts such as normalized hyperscaler spending, specifically at Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon Web Services (AMZN), with the most notable driver being 5G.\n\n5G smartphones represent a major upgrade cycle in 2020. According to Gill, the amount of 5G smartphones could reach 120 million to 140 million units at the mid-point in 2020. With every original equipment manufacturer (OEM) looking to get in on the trend, 5G creates several growth opportunities for MU.\n\nWhile some investors have expressed concerns regarding MU\u2019s dependence on Huawei, Gill believes MU has \u201cde-risked\u201d its exposure going into Q3. As a result of all of the above factors, the five-star analyst kept his Buy rating and $50 price target.\n\nAll in all, the Street takes a cautiously optimistic stance on MU. With 14 Buy ratings vs 5 Holds and 2 Sells assigned in the last three months, MU is a \u2018Moderate Buy\u2019. It has an average price target of $51, suggesting 0.04% upside. The low upside potential makes sense given the fact that share prices have soared year-to-date.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Despite concerns that problematic inventory levels as well as flaring trade tensions would weigh down the semiconductor industry, the sector has still been able to grow with the VanEck Semiconductor ETF up 40% year-to-date.
