I\u2019ll have a green juice,\u201d she adds. \u201cCan I have a green juice as well? The green whatever it is. Thank you. I\u2019m trying to fix myself.\u201d\n\nThe Irish writer-director-actor-producer is a regular at the private club where we meet, and so, it appears, is a very sweaty Richard Madden, whom I glimpse jogging through the lobby before Horgan and I enter the too-dark, too-small lift. I expect Horgan, with her acerbic wit and refusal to take anything seriously, to mock the luvvie venue a bit, but when I tell her it\u2019s my first time visiting, she is genuinely surprised: \u201cI thought everybody came here.\u201d\n\nHorgan, 49, is the busiest woman in British television. In the past 15 years, she has written the TV series Pulling, Dead Boss, Catastrophe, Divorce, Motherland and Women on the Verge. She has starred in four out of six of those, as well as Psychobitches, BoJack Horseman, Disenchantment and the films Game Night and Military Wives. And those are just the highlights.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nShe is best known for Catastrophe, the hilariously ribald sitcom co-starring and co-written by comedian Rob Delaney, about a pair of thirtysomethings whose week-long fling results in accidental pregnancy and then marriage. Her character, also called Sharon, has an edgy, colourful wardrobe, and when I tell my Irish mother I\u2019m meeting Horgan, her reaction is, verbatim: \u201cJeez, where and when and what are you wearing?!\u201d Today, Horgan is embracing clashing patterns with checked trousers and a stripy vest top. Her jewellery bears the names of her two daughters, a necklace for the eldest, Sadhbh (pronounced Sive) and a ring for Amer.\n\nHorgan is a fidgeter. Twiddling her hair and necklace constantly, she gets her chain completely tangled at one point. \u201cIt gives me something to do,\u201d she shrugs, amused.\n\nModern Love is Horgan\u2019s latest project, an Amazon anthology series based on eight essays submitted to the eponymous New York Times column. It has a terrific cast, from Anne Hathaway to Andrew Scott, and under showrunner John Carney (Sing Street, Once), Horgan has written and directed one episode: \u201cRallying to Keep the Game Alive\u201d. It follows a couple going through marriage counselling and playing tennis together, portrayed by Tina Fey and John Slattery \u2013 \u201cthe funniest f***ers\u201d, according to Horgan, who proceeds to show me a selfie of Slattery on the set of his new show Mrs America, sporting a comb over and brown teeth. She hoots with laughter at the ridiculous image.\n\nSo many of Horgan\u2019s shows revolve around strong, passionate yet deeply fractured relationships, and she admits she is somewhat of a \u201cwatcher\u201d. \u201cIn a slightly creepy way, I\u2019m always watching couples,\u201d she says. \u201cI find the whole dynamic pretty compulsive viewing.\u201d\n\nHorgan also uses herself as a \u201cweird sort of muse\u201d. The most obvious example of this is in Catastrophe, in which Horgan and Delaney both use their real names. In the show, she has an extremely competitive relationship with her brother Fergal, which draws from her own experience of growing up with four siblings on a turkey farm in Ireland.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. 10 best black comedy films of all time Show all 10 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch. Shape Created with Sketch. 10 best black comedy films of all time 1/10 Bad Santa (directed by Terry Zwigoff, 2003) The perfect antidote to the usual Christmas slush-fest, Bad Santa has an outrageously profane and debauched Billy Bob Thornton using his seasonal job as a shopping mall Santa Claus to rob the mall\u2019s stores. A needy child latches on to him, thawing the misanthropic alcoholic only slightly, but Zwigoff makes no compromises, and leaves no yuletide convention unscathed. One can only guess at how many unsuspecting families have had their festive celebrations scarred after innocently viewing just a smidgen of this disgusting but hilarious monument to bad taste. 2/10 Monsieur Verdoux (Charles Chaplin, 1947) Hugely controversial on release, the hostile reception garnered by Monsieur Verdoux helped precipitate Chaplin\u2019s eventual exile to Europe. The years between 1940\u2019s The Great Dictator and Chaplin\u2019s most polarising film hadn\u2019t been kind to Chaplin thanks to scandal in his private life and the increasing perception of his supposed communist sympathies. Chaplin\u2019s subsequent feelings of isolation and alienation informed this pitch black tale of a bluebeard who woos and murders a series of wealthy women so that he can support his own family. Chaplin\u2019s satirical social commentary and his character\u2019s defence that his crimes paled into insignificance in comparison with the horrors of the real world found no favour either at the box office or with critics, and the little tramp\u2019s journey from the world\u2019s most loved entertainer to public enemy number one was complete. 3/10 The Heartbreak Kid (Elaine May, 1972) Forget the wretched Ben Stiller remake and try and view a (very rare) copy of this superb comedy of embarrassment and while you\u2019re about it, go for a double header of the oft overlooked Miss May\u2019s work with 1971\u2019s A New Leaf. A Jewish boy (Charles Grodin) marries a gauche young woman in haste (Jeannie Berlin) and decides to end the marriage when he falls for and woos alluring blond goddess Cybill Shepherd whilst on honeymoon, to the uncomprehending disbelief of Shepherd\u2019s Wasp father, Eddie Albert. There are superb performances all round, with Oscar nominated Berlin (May\u2019s daughter), a stand out. In other hands the whole premise could have dissolved into bathos, but May and screenwriter Neil Simon produced a film that is wise, funny and true, and in the restaurant scene when Grodin dumps his new bride, well... heartbreaking. 4/10 Withnail and I (Bruce Robinson, 1987) A British movie that inspired a student drinking game and has its\u2019 many hilarious lines quoted verbatim by fans (\u201cDon\u2019t you threaten me with a dead fish!\u201d etc.) must have something going for it, and Withnail and I certainly does. Paul McGann and a marvellously wasted and acerbic Richard E Grant make the most of Robinson\u2019s terrific semi-autobiographical script in this hilarious tale of two base, out of work actors living in squalor who drown themselves in a diet of booze, pills and lighter fluid on a disastrous holiday in the country circa 1969. The whole movie is basically one long bender followed by the mother of all hangovers, (\u201cLook at my tongue, it\u2019s wearing a yellow sock.\u201d) and stands as a perfect farewell to the flip side of the so-called swinging Sixties. 5/10 Harold and Maude (Hal Ashby, 1971) A cult favourite dismissed and panned by critics on its\u2019 release, Harold and Maude\u2019s reputation has grown immeasurably over the years. The story revolves around the tender romance between Harold (Bud Cort), a death obsessed 20-year-old and 79-year-old Maude (Ruth Gordon), a holocaust survivor whose joie de vivre stems from that experience. Critics and cinema goers couldn\u2019t get past Harold\u2019s elaborately staged fake suicides and the love story between the pair, (If it had been a 79-year-old man and a 20-year-old woman, would there have been so much resistance?), but beneath the gallows humour lies a rather warm and moving film. Paramount Pictures 6/10 The Ladykillers (Alexander Mackendrick, 1955) Mackendrick was soon to depart for America to make the very dark Sweet Smell of Success and The Ladykillers was his final film at Ealing and a fitting swansong. Mackendrick himself viewed the film as an ironic joke about the condition of a decaying post war England and the breakdown of the old order. A gang of thieves rent a room in a sweet old lady\u2019s house (a scene stealing Katie Johnson), and masquerade as musicians while they plan and execute their latest caper. When the indomitable old lady threatens to reveal all to the police, the gang decide they have to kill her. The gang, a marvellous gallery of grotesques played by Alec Guinness, Peter Sellers, Cecil Parker, Herbert Lom, and Danny Green then have to decide who\u2019s going to do the dirty deed but only end up offing each other in a series of gruesome but highly amusing vignettes. The movie\u2019s plot supposedly arrived fully formed to screenwriter William Rose in a dream, and The Ladykillers remains one of Ealing\u2019s greatest works. 7/10 Fargo (Joel Coen, 1996) One of their finest achievements, and one of the standout films of the 1990s, Fargo put the Coen brothers in the major league, winning a best screenplay Oscar. Frances McDormand lifted the best actress award for her role as the heavily pregnant Minnesota police chief who hides a razor-sharp mind behind her congenial, homely persona. This quality allows the chief to piece together the convoluted tale of a kidnapping for ransom that goes disastrously wrong. Jarringly violent in places and with an other-worldly ambience, Fargo is shot full of the brothers\u2019 trademark dark humour and lives up to its\u2019 blurb: \u201ca lot can happen in the middle of nowhere\u201d. Chris Large 8/10 MASH (Robert Altman, 1970) MASH fully deserves its\u2019 exalted status as the landmark antiwar film of its\u2019 time or indeed of any time. Made at the height of the Vietnam War but set during the Korean War, the parallels between the two conflicts couldn\u2019t have been clearer. The audience was left in no doubt about MASH\u2019s intended targets \u2013 the horrors and absurdities of war which in real life were being beamed from Vietnam into a weary nation\u2019s living rooms, bungling military bureaucracy, the head nurse who is immune to the suffering around her, Uncle Sam, God, the whole nine yards. The outrageous practices and cruel capers perpetrated by Trapper, Hawkeye, et al on their victims, the jokes and ad libs in the operating theatre while the surgeons are covered in blood and gore, are a coping mechanism, a way of staying sane in an insane world. In other words, we laugh, lest we cry. 9/10 Kind Hearts and Coronets (Robert Hamer, 1949) Alec Guinness famously played eight roles in this very dark comedy of manners and is of course, brilliant, but he is matched all the way by a marvellously urbane and detached Dennis Price as the serial killer who calmly murders his way to a dukedom. The film takes barbed pot-shots at the aristocracy and the class divide and the talented but troubled Hamer directs with a sureness of touch that does full justice to the billboards declaring the film \u201ca hilarious study in the gentle art of murder\u201d. Price\u2019s exquisite voiceover and the savage twist in the tail are the icing on the cake in a film with no room for sentiment or remorse, the pinnacle of Ealing\u2019s wonderful body of work, and one of the greatest British films ever made. 10/10 Dr Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (Stanley Kubrick, 1964) A deranged US general deliberately launches a nuclear bomb on the Soviet Union and the hapless American President (\u201cDimitri, we have a little problem...\u201d) has to deal with the fallout. Possibly only Kubrick would dare make a film about a nuclear attack on the USSR while the Cuban Missile Crisis was still fresh in many people\u2019s minds, but he created an instant classic in this justly famous and celebrated example of his dark art. Dr Strangelove boasts a wonderful screenplay by Kubrick and Terry Southern that aptly sums up the warped rationale of the so-called nuclear deterrent and has a uniformly brilliant cast, including Peter Sellers playing three roles. It is a film that has to be watched time and time again to marvel at how Kubrick finds humour in an unthinkably horrific situation and if anything, this devastating and timeless cold war satire has improved with age and is just as relevant today. 1/10 Bad Santa (directed by Terry Zwigoff, 2003) The perfect antidote to the usual Christmas slush-fest, Bad Santa has an outrageously profane and debauched Billy Bob Thornton using his seasonal job as a shopping mall Santa Claus to rob the mall\u2019s stores. A needy child latches on to him, thawing the misanthropic alcoholic only slightly, but Zwigoff makes no compromises, and leaves no yuletide convention unscathed. One can only guess at how many unsuspecting families have had their festive celebrations scarred after innocently viewing just a smidgen of this disgusting but hilarious monument to bad taste. 2/10 Monsieur Verdoux (Charles Chaplin, 1947) Hugely controversial on release, the hostile reception garnered by Monsieur Verdoux helped precipitate Chaplin\u2019s eventual exile to Europe.

Dr Strangelove boasts a wonderful screenplay by Kubrick and Terry Southern that aptly sums up the warped rationale of the so-called nuclear deterrent and has a uniformly brilliant cast, including Peter Sellers playing three roles. It is a film that has to be watched time and time again to marvel at how Kubrick finds humour in an unthinkably horrific situation and if anything, this devastating and timeless cold war satire has improved with age and is just as relevant today.\n\nThe second of five children, Horgan went to convent school, which she has said in the past she \u201cdidn\u2019t enjoy at all\u201d. She told The Guardian: \u201cIf you\u2019re taught about the wrath of God when you\u2019re little, it\u2019s not good, especially if you\u2019re a bit of a brat and you think you\u2019ve sinned.\u201d\n\nOne of her two brothers, Shane, was an international rugby star. She describes her siblings as \u201cmagic, brilliant people who are ridiculously successful in their lives\u201d.\n\nIn previous interviews, Horgan has spoken about wanting to appear accomplished so her parents would have something to tell their friends, which she believes must be partly rooted in growing up in such a big household. \u201cWe\u2019re all incredibly needy,\u201d she admits, with a grin. \u201cWe all know how much we want that praise, that attention. It\u2019s kind of crazy to be the age that I am and still really desire it, still really go out of my way to make my parents proud.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a failing, it\u2019s pretty handy. I have my own drive for myself though, too, a natural competitiveness with myself and with other people. A sort of, \u2018What are you going to do next? Is it as good as what you just did? Or better?\u2019\u201d\n\nWith Fergal in Catastrophe, Horgan explains, she wanted to explore the idea of the Irish son, the golden boy. \u201cHow can you ever really compete with that?\u201d she asks. \u201cYou just can\u2019t, and you just have to let it be and keep waving your arms around in the background, saying, \u2018Look at me.\u2019\u201d\n\nHas she ever felt afraid to use her personal life as material for her work? \u201cThe only thing that bothers me about it is sometimes I feel like I\u2019ve got one foot in real life and one foot on a page,\u201d says Horgan. \u201cThat\u2019s not great. It doesn\u2019t happen all the time and it does make me sound like a bit of a sociopath, and I don\u2019t think I am.\u201d She corrects herself, \u201cI know I\u2019m not. But sometimes I\u2019ve had to catch myself and go, \u2018What the f*** are you doing?\u2019\u201d\n\nMining her own experiences for her work does have its benefits in breaking taboos, however. \u201cNot being afraid to have dark thoughts and say them out loud, people really appreciate that,\u201d she muses. \u201cPeople have friendships and relationships, but weirdly seeing someone on a TV screen in the same situation and dealing with it badly or honestly or truthfully, that\u2019s the thing that makes people think, \u2018I\u2019m not a monster.\u2019\u201d\n\nA classic line in Catastrophe, for example, sees Sharon\u2019s friend suggest she treat her pre-cancerous cervical dysplasia with homeopathy, prompting Rob to scream: \u201cIf I thought for a second that I could just rub a blueberry on her vagina and fix her, I would, but I can\u2019t because it\u2019s BULLS***.\u201d\n\nHorgan contrasts the positives of showing the harsh realities of life on TV to the negatives of people only sharing an \u201cidealised version\u201d of their lives on social media. \u201cYou never see the s*** fits in between the picture-perfect moments,\u201d she says. \u201cYou see people picking blackberries with their kid and these gorgeous moments of unity and harmony but you don\u2019t see the kid going apes*** five seconds before. That can really affect people and make them go, \u2018What\u2019s wrong with me? Why doesn\u2019t my life look like that?\u2019\u201d\n\nHorgan, who has a teenage daughter, says that for adolescents, this feeling of inadequacy \u201cmanifests 100-fold\u201d as they strive for the \u201cperfection\u201d they are under pressure to achieve.\n\nApart from childbirth, Horgan says it\u2019s the experience of raising a teenager that makes her think about her mother the most. \u201cI was a real s*** of a teenager, complicated and wild, and yet I don\u2019t ever remember it stressing her out to the extent that she fought back,\u201d she says. \u201cWhereas I fight back\u2026\n\n\u201cI think and hope I\u2019m a good mother, but I know that my work is a big part of my life and sometimes I\u2019ve made choices that haven\u2019t always necessarily been the best for the family. Not often, but occasionally.\u201d\n\nA few days before we meet, Horgan posts an Instagram picture of herself on the front cover of a weekend supplement, with the caption: \u201cHere I am wearing a couple of good suits and sounding on the verge of a breakdown. I\u2019m not, but f*** it, some days happen to be tougher than others and sometimes you happen to be talking to a journalist on those very same days.\u201d\n\nShe has mixed feelings about it now. \u201cI suppose my slightly paranoid brain was like, I don\u2019t mind sounding like a f*** up because I often am, but I don\u2019t want to sound incapable\u2026 I was just suddenly protective of myself and what it is that I do,\u201d she explains. \u201cBut then at the same time it\u2019s not a bad thing to sound a bit messy, because often it is all about looking nice in your photographs and actually there\u2019s all sort of s*** going on up here,\u201d she says, pointing to her head.\n\nThere does seem to be a lot of solipsistic angst pinballing around Horgan\u2019s mind, and it\u2019s this that defines the self-questioning, guilt-ridden kind of comedy she is famous for. For example, a character in Horgan\u2019s Women on the Verge reminds her friend, who is considering getting back with her ex: \u201cYou used to fantasise about him dying in an avalanche. You used to encourage him to go climbing on his own. Without his phone. You told him ropes were for wimps, remember?\u201d\n\nHorgan, who had a supporting role as a therapist in that show, tells me she feels \u201cless and less comfortable\u201d acting \u2013 which she ideally wants to spend \u201c20 per cent\u201d of her time doing \u2013 because she doesn\u2019t \u201clove looking at myself on screen much anymore\u201d.\n\nThe reason for this is a \u201cmixture of insecurity and vanity because I shouldn\u2019t necessarily give a s***\u201d, she says. Horgan is especially unnerved when she is starring in a show or a film and has no say over the final edit.\n\n\u201cThe decision about what is the best, funniest take is out of your hands and you\u2019re not in control,\u201d she says, trying to escape from a knot she\u2019s somehow managed to tie in her hair. \u201cIt just makes me a bit anxious. But I still am addicted to acting, because, in a way, it\u2019s really nice to pretend to be someone else. You\u2019re in this little make-believe world for a while. You can get it from your writing, go into a world that takes you away from day to day life and that is escapism, but there is something about putting on a costume and being braver, smarter, cooler \u2013 just not being yourself for a while \u2013 that is addictive.\u201d\n\nShe may find it hard watching herself these days, but Horgan believes 2019 is a great time for \u201cwomen of a certain age carrying films and TV series\u201d. Not so much behind the camera, though. A producing partner recently sent her an all-male list of directors for a new project, \u201cand just to be f***ing contrary, I sent my list and it was all-female\u201d.\n\nWhen gender equality\u2019s in the spotlight, she continues, \u201ceveryone\u2019s on their best behaviour, but as soon as the spotlight is taken off it, things go back. It\u2019s about perseverance now, not resting on your laurels and continuing to be an a******e about it because it\u2019s so easy for the lazy lists to come back around.\n\n\u201cFemale stories sell now and really it does come down to that, economics, which is incredibly positive. It\u2019s just f***ing annoying that it took a sexual assault apocalypse to create that change.\u201d\n\nOur conversation turns to Phoebe Waller-Bridge\u2019s recent $20m deal with Amazon. \u201cI just f***ing love female creators making that kind of money,\u201d she says. \u201c Apart from Shonda Rhimes, it\u2019s the guys that make the big Marvel movies who are associated with that kind of money, so yeah, fair play to her.\u201d Horgan herself signed a two-year overall deal with Amazon in 2018.\n\nShe is \u201cgutted\u201d her production company Merman didn\u2019t get in there with Waller-Bridge early enough to make TV together. They met just as Waller-Bridge was starting Crashing and \u201cI knew we\u2019d come in too late\u201d, she says.\n\nAs we get up to leave, Horgan tells me she\u2019s still feeling a little worse for wear. \u201cIt was my business partner\u2019s birthday drinks,\u201d she explains, \u201cbut I\u2019d been out with someone from Channel 4 just before so I got half tanked with him, then I met her and we finished on whiskies and I had to get up at half six to get my kid to school, and I tried to get back to sleep but it was a fractured and awful sleep, then I remembered I was meeting you and had a panic attack at 9.30am.\u201d\n\nHorgan sighs. \u201cBut I\u2019m glad it got me up and moving.\u201d\n\nModern Love arrives on Amazon Prime on Friday 18 October", "description": "Sharon Horgan is hungover. \u201cI\u2019ll have a mint tea, please,\u201d she tells the waiter in the dining room of an east London members\u2019 club, her fingers pressed to her temples. \u201cYou know what? I\u2019ll have a green juice,\u201d she adds. \u201cCan I have a green juice as well? The green whatever it is. Thank you. I\u2019m trying to fix myself.\u201d", "authors": ["Ellie Harrison"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/11/16/sharon-horgan.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
