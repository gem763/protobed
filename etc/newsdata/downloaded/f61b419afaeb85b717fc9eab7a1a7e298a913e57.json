George W. Bush won.\n\nIn 1968, Democrats had a similarly narrow lead on prosperity, but Vietnam topped the agenda and Richard Nixon opened up a 19-point advantage over Hubert Humphrey on peace.\n\nIn this sense (only) 2016 was a \u201cnormal\u201d election: The Republicans led, albeit narrowly, on both peace and prosperity and won the White House, while of course losing the popular vote.\n\nWhat\u2019s striking today is that the GOP still leads on both indicia, but President Trump Donald John TrumpTrump says he doesn't want NYT in the White House Veterans group backs lawsuits to halt Trump's use of military funding for border wall Schiff punches back after GOP censure resolution fails MORE is polling well behind his well-known Democratic rivals. Both clauses in the preceding sentence may result in some head scratching.\n\nIn Gallup\u2019s September reading, Republicans have a 4-point advantage as the party of prosperity and a 6-point lead on peace/security.\n\nThe first figure will only come as a shock to Democrats who see the economy as a key GOP vulnerability.\n\nI\u2019ve argued here that while voters are distraught by inequality, in relative terms, they are happy with their economic lot and the condition of the country as a whole \u2014 a fact reflected in the GOP advantage on prosperity.\n\nIt\u2019s more surprising that a party constantly criticized for an erratic and unskilled foreign policy is perceived to be stronger in that arena than Democrats.\n\nMore shocking still, while the GOP is the party of both peace and prosperity (albeit narrowly), voters like the Democrats better.\n\nIt\u2019s not that people love either party\u2014both are net unfavorable according to Gallup. But while Democrats are net unfavorable by two points, the GOP is net unfavorable by 12.\n\nWhy?\n\nIt\u2019s pretty simple, really. While the GOP may be the party of peace and prosperity, it is also the party of Trump.\n\nRealClearPolitics shows the president is now 15 points net unfavorable. In match-ups, on average, he\u2019s running 7 points behind Joe Biden Joe BidenTrump says he doesn't want NYT in the White House Warren to protest with striking Chicago teachers Schiff punches back after GOP censure resolution fails MORE and 5 points behind both Sens.

Yes, we now see lots of positive data. But parties don\u2019t lose presidential elections when they lead on both peace and prosperity.\n\nRepublicans should realize that Donald Trump is the cause of their failure, not the key to their success.\n\nThe GOP did far less well than it could have in 2018 because of Donald Trump and will likely underperform at every level in 2020 because of Donald Trump.\n\nNarcissist that he is, he\u2019d like hearing this, though it\u2019s actually bad news for him, but Trump\u2019s become more important than peace and prosperity.\n\nMellman is president of The Mellman Group and has helped elect 30 U.S. senators, 12 governors and dozens of House members.
