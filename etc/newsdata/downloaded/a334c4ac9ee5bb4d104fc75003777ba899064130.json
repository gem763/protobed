Ostensibly, yes. Ulta missed on everything. In the quarter, comparable sales came in shy of estimates, as did revenues, margins and profits. Management also cut the guide everywhere, citing weakness across the entire cosmetics industry. The company also significantly reduced the sales, comps, margin and profit guides.\n\nBroadly speaking, it was about as bad a quarter as Ulta could\u2019ve reported. Also, heading into the print, ULTA stock was trading at a historically rich 27-times forward price-to-earnings multiple.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nConsidering all that, the 30% post-earnings plunge in ULTA stock shouldn\u2019t be too surprising. This was an overvalued stock that reported miserable numbers.\n\nBut, I think this huge selloff in Ulta stock is an opportunity. Why? Two big reasons.\n\nFirst, near-term headwinds in the cosmetics industry won\u2019t last. They will pass. When they do, Ulta\u2019s numbers will improve. Second, considering its long-term growth potential, ULTA stock is now undervalued, and the stock has sizable upside in the event the numbers do improve from here.\n\nI think it may be time to buy the dip in ULTA stock. The quarter was ugly, but this is still a winning stock with a ton of long-term growth firepower.\n\nNear-Term Cosmetics Industry Headwinds Won\u2019t Last\n\nAll the growth trends at Ulta are going in the opposite direction. Comparable sales growth is slowing. Store growth and revenue growth are slowing, too. Expanding margins are turning into compressing margins. Big profit growth is turning into markedly smaller profit growth.\n\nThe theme of Ulta\u2019s Q2 conference call was that this adverse growth trend reversal is being driven by a slowdown in the macro U.S. cosmetics industry. Specifically, according to management, what was red-hot growth across the entire U.S. cosmetics category earlier this decade, has slowed meaningfully over the past two years, and actually turned negative in 2019.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of this slowing growth industry, Ulta\u2019s top- and bottom-line momentum is similarly slowing.\n\nThis all makes a ton of sense. The cosmetics industry has been very hot for a long time. It needs to cool off, and as the market goes through this necessary cooling period, Ulta\u2019s growth rates will naturally take a hit. Importantly, though, this slowdown won\u2019t last.\n\nHistory shows us that any and all slowdowns in the U.S. personal care industry over the past two decades have been small and short-lived. During that stretch, personal care sales have risen at a fairly steady 4% compounded annual growth rate, and there have never been back-to-back years of declines.\n\nThere\u2019s no reason to believe this slowdown will be the exception to the longer running trend. The secular drivers here \u2014 mainly, the proliferation of visual-first social media wherein consumers are sharing pictures and videos of themselves all the time \u2014 imply that consumers still want (need?) to look good, and will continue to spend big on cosmetics.\n\nAs such, near-term macro U.S. cosmetics headwinds aren\u2019t here to stay for the long run. They will pass. When they do, this whole market will resume on its secular march higher.\n\n\n\n\n\nUlta Is Now Undervalued\n\nDespite the horrible quarter, Ulta is still a growth company in a growth industry. For a growth company in a growth industry, ULTA stock is materially undervalued at the current moment \u2014 leaving room for substantial upside when the numbers improve.\n\nEverything is slowing at Ulta right now. Yet, the company is still projected to grow sales at a 10%-plus rate this year alongside 10%-plus profit growth. To be sure, most of this growth is driven by unit growth (7% unit growth projected this year), and margins are in decline. But, management projects that comps will remain solidly positive (5% for the year), and margins should rebound when the cosmetics industry rebounds.", "description": "Shares of Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) plunged in late August after the cosmetic retailer's second-quarter earnings report missed estimates across the board.
