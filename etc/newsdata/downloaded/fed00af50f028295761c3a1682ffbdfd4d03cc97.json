As competitors on Canada\u2019s version of \u201cThe Amazing Race,\u201d to fulfill their next challenge they had to assemble an eight-foot-tall Muskoka chair. Makokis is the type to screw things on backward, but Johnson used to build Ikea furniture as a university side hustle. So Makokis followed his husband\u2019s lead as Johnson went to work with a power drill.\n\nLater, Makokis told the cameras, \u201cAnthony does home renovations. He\u2019s so butch,\u201d his voice sounding proud and enamored.\n\nThe pair completed the task, and the following two, on their way to being crowned victors of the show\u2019s seventh season. Sure, a round-the-world trip, two new Chevrolet Blazers and $250,000 are winnings to celebrate. But for them, the biggest perk was the show\u2019s national platform. It was a chance for the country \u2014 and the world \u2014 to witness a bold example of a gay, indigenous couple, the first to compete on the show. The prevalence of LGBTQ relationships on reality TV has grown in recent years, most notably with the Bachelor franchise featuring its first same-sex engagement (of Demi Burnett and Kristian Haggerty) on Tuesday.\n\nJohnson is a project consultant hailing from the Navajo Nation in Arizona. Makokis is a family physician specializing in transgender care from Alberta\u2019s Saddle Lake Cree Nation. They both identify as two-spirit, an umbrella term that indigenous people use to describe people in their communities who are gender-nonconforming. \u201cWe jump between \u2018male\u2019 roles and \u2018female\u2019 roles,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cWe just do what needs to be done so that life doesn\u2019t stall.\u201d\n\nFaced with a gantlet of activities, including digging for clams, getting remote-control robots through a maze and racing on Flyboards (a type of hoverboard), the duo says that willingness to do what was required gave them their edge.\n\nThe final challenge was to construct an irrigation system. Again, Johnson took the reins.\n\n\u201cWhen you grow up on the [reservation], if you don\u2019t know how to do it, it doesn\u2019t get done,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cWe had to irrigate our cornfields, and we didn\u2019t have running water.\u201d\n\nThey named themselves Team Ahkameyimok, spotlighting the Nehiyawewin that means \u201cnever give up.\u201d They sported colorful clothing as they traversed six provinces, one territory, 14 cities and more than 20,000 kilometers, attire loaded with LGBTQ and environmental symbols. Their red, knee-length skirts sewn with rainbow ribbons stood out amid the dry-fit crew necks and tights other competitors wore. The skirts also represented missing and murdered indigenous women, Johnson said, as well as transgender and two-spirit people. In one episode, they donned blue T-shirts proclaiming \u201cWater Is Life.\u201d\n\nThey met in a two-spirit Facebook group. A moderator shared an Out magazine article about the Montana Two Spirit Society featuring a photo of Makokis, and Johnson was intrigued. He contacted Makokis while Makokis was on a book tour around Australia. Five hours flew by as they talked over the phone, Makokis on a white-sand beach in Fiji, Johnson in his exposed-brick Brooklyn apartment. Makokis later visited Johnson in New York City, where they biked, grabbed dinner in Little Italy and saw the Brooklyn Bridge.\n\nThe two are used to being in the spotlight: They had their wedding in the middle of running the 2017 Vancouver Marathon, staging the ceremony on English Bay Beach before finishing the race as a married couple.\n\nTheir resilience and trust in one another carried them through the tougher aspects of the race: chronic stress, restlessness, the selfish desire to take ownership of a task. They each had to learn when to fall back and let the other shine, or at least try their best, Makokis said.\n\nWhen they crossed the finish line, social media erupted with cheers. Johnson and Makokis were fan favorites, beloved for their wholesome personalities, bubbly humor and inspiring messages. Their advocacy made them a lightning rod for praise and hope.\n\nLoved that they wore their skirts for the finale and that they brought messages concerning #IndigenousPeoples to the race\n\n\ud83e\udde1\ud83e\udde1\ud83e\udde1\n\n\n\n\ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08\ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udde6\ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08 \u2014 \ud83c\udf3fFern\ud83c\udf3f (@ItmustbeBunneez) September 11, 2019\n\nSuch Canadian heroes!

The prize money will go toward dreams yet realized, like the cultural healing center in Kehewin Cree Nation they want to create.\n\nUntil then?\n\n\u201cOur last challenge is to get on \u2018Ellen\u2019!\u201d Johnson said, citing the couple\u2019s favorite daytime talk show.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nFacebook\u2019s new dating feature: Your burning questions, answered\n\nThe viral Caroline Calloway essay hit a nerve because so many of us have had toxic friendships\n\n\u2018Bachelor in Paradise\u2019: Demi Burnett\u2019s girlfriend joins the cast, giving the show its first same-sex couple", "description": "Slowly, reality TV is becoming more diverse.", "authors": ["Travis Deshong", "Features Reporting Intern", "Travis Deshong Is A Reporter Writing For The Features Desk."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/SjnU-Twq45ma5EbLsALxIO542Nc=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MMTZEA6ENRF5VDMQGGPXL7WJUU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
