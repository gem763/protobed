It\u2019s being republished today for the 25th anniversaries of Friends and ER. Photo: Maya Robinson\n\nNBC\u2019s storied \u201cMust-See TV\u201d Thursday lineup has seen various iterations over the decades. While the network\u2019s marketing execs didn\u2019t actually coin the phrase until 1993, sitcom triumphs from the 1980s \u2014 The Cosby Show, Cheers, Family Ties \u2014 have retroactively become part of the Peacock pantheon. Likewise, although 21st-century Thursday shows such as The Office, 30 Rock, Parks and Recreation, and Community never reached a broad audience in the way their predecessors did, they\u2019ll very likely be remembered in the same paragraph (if not the same sentence) as their ancestors. And then there is that one NBC Thursday lineup from the past three decades that stands apart\u2014 the One Must-See TV Lineup to Rule Them All. It\u2019s the schedule NBC birthed in the fall of 1994, when established blockbuster Seinfeld was married with newcomers Friends and ER. Almost literally overnight, the TV world changed: Superstars were born, network fortunes changed. NBC, which had established a tradition of both qualitative and commercial success a decade earlier, transformed into an unstoppable Thursday juggernaut. It became immune, at least on one night, to whatever rivals threw at it. And after finishing in third place the season before, it suddenly found itself challenging ABC for the overall Nielsen crown, particular with younger viewers.\n\nThings are much different for NBC on Thursday nights now, of course. The Peacock long ago surrendered its ratings crown to CBS, which has dominated the night in recent years with mass-appeal half-hours such as Two and a Half Men, The Big Bang Theory, Young Sheldon, and Mom. At one point five years ago, the situation on the yuks front grew so dire that NBC began the fall season without a single returning comedy on Thursday night, the first time that had happened in three decades. NBC\u2019s Thursday fortunes have improved since then. Superstore launched in 2015, with The Good Place following a year later. Neither show is a ratings smash, but they\u2019re both critical hits with solid core audiences, particularly among younger viewers. While NBC doesn\u2019t use Must-See TV in its marketing anymore \u2014 the new branding is \u201cComedy Starts Here\u201d \u2014 the network is still leaning in to the idea that Thursday is the home of some of its best shows, particularly comedies.\n\nThat\u2019s because the halo of that 1994 schedule still hangs over the network. When this story was first published back in 2014, ahead of the 20th anniversary of the debuts of Friends and ER, Vulture decided to find out how that most epic of Thursday schedules came together. When did NBC execs know Friends and ER might be worthy of Thursday berths? How did they make the gutsy decision to shift two very successful Thursday comedies, Frasier and Wings, to Tuesdays in order to make room for the newcomers? And why did they decide to make another big move just a year later? For the answers, we got together with former NBC Entertainment president Warren Littlefield (who had just won an Emmy for his role as exec producer of FX\u2019s Fargo and would go on to produce Hulu\u2019s The Handmaid\u2019s Tale) and former Peacock scheduling guru Preston Beckman (who was then at Fox Networks Group and is now a consultant). Ahead of the 25th anniversary of that storied NBC lineup, here\u2019s a look back at the edited and annotated transcript of our nearly 90-minute conversation with the two men.\n\nThe Road to Thursday\n\nBefore they were megahits, Friends and ER started out like most TV shows back then (and even now): one of a couple dozen projects lucky enough to film pilot episodes in consideration for a spot on a network\u2019s schedule. Of the two, ER had the bigger auspices: It was based on a novel by superstar author Michael Crichton (Jurassic Park), and Steven Spielberg was attached as a producer. The creators of Friends, meanwhile, were best known for their work on HBO\u2019s Dream On (at a time when pay-cable shows didn\u2019t have the same cachet they do now).\n\nHow early in the development process did you start thinking Friends and ER might be worth scheduling on Thursday?\n\nWarren Littlefield: I would say that both of them were targeted to go into Thursday night. With Friends, as we went through the casting process, we got more and more excited. Not because there were any household, super-well-known star names. We just thought, Man, this is a fun, attractive cast. And then Jimmy Burrows signed on [to direct]. Going into screenings, there was a certain patina, a hope to it. There was a feeling that if we did it right, this belonged on Thursday night. That was very much kind of a goal, and a target.\n\nPreston Beckman: But honestly, before we even considered Friends for Thursday, we had a bigger decision, which was whether to split up Thursday. I don\u2019t think the the big focus, at least in terms of the comedies, was on Friends. It was \u2014 you know, are we gonna make this move?\n\nRight. You were heading into fall 1994 with a 10 p.m. opening, since L.A. Law was wrapping its run. But your Thursday comedy block was working pretty much perfectly: Mad About You, Wings, Seinfeld, Frasier.\n\nLittlefield: That\u2019s your Must-See TV lineup.\n\nExactly. Anyone looking at that schedule now, or even then, would say \u2026\n\nLittlefield: Don\u2019t mess with this.\n\nBeckman: We started off believing that that\u2019s what we were gonna do. Just leave Thursday night \u2014 at least the comedies \u2014 as is.\n\nLittlefield: But the feeling was, this is how we become the No. 1 network. That if we don\u2019t get into Tuesday night, then we\u2019re gonna get blocked out. The only comedy competition on Tuesday night was from ABC. And so that\u2019s why we took that risk.\n\nOnce you opened up two comedy slots on Thursday, it then came down to whether Friends should fill one of those two holes, and if so, whether it should air at 8:30 p.m. behind Mad About You, or at 9:30 p.m. behind Seinfeld. You also had Dabney Coleman returning to TV in Madman of the People, and also headed to Thursday. How did you decide which show went where?\n\nBeckman: The reality was, Friends was a mediocre-testing pilot.\n\nLittlefield: It was a \u201chigh weak\u201d in the testing. Seinfeld was absolutely disastrous. Weak, weak on all levels. But Friends was a high weak, because there was a bubbling young-adult 18-to-34-year-old audience that got its sensibility. And so, it wasn\u2019t considered, like, a full-on 18-to-49 show. They found it moderately funny, [with an] attractive, young cast. But it was really \u2014 it wasn\u2019t overly emotionally involving. And there wasn\u2019t a single star that jumped out. It was, by definition, what we set out to do: an ensemble. Madman just felt a little more adult. We thought, Well, it\u2019ll play a little older, and we\u2019ll put it a little later. And Friends will play younger. And, you know, being sandwiched between Mad About You and Seinfeld, that was a pretty great opportunity.\n\nBeckman: Madman of the People was a higher-testing pilot. It\u2019s that simple. It\u2019s really that simple. We liked Friends. Friends was actually liked more [by NBC execs] than the testing indicated. But, you know, in the real world, we don\u2019t know what we have a lot of the time. We didn\u2019t know what we had with Friends. We didn\u2019t know what we had with Seinfeld. You don\u2019t know. If we knew, we would probably be gazillionaires now, and Warren would not be freezing his ass up in Calgary.\n\nWas it an easier call to schedule ER at 10 p.m. on Thursday?\n\nLittlefield: We didn\u2019t have many choices.\n\nL.A. Law was over, and you had to find something to replace it.\n\nLittlefield: You know, Steven [Bochco, executive producer of L.A. Law] said to me, \u201cHey, I can give you another half-season.\u201d But I just thought it was time.\n\nWhat were the possibilities for the slot?\n\nLittlefield: We had done an experiment with a Robin Williams episode of Homicide and played that on Thursday. And as powerful and as wonderful as that was, it didn\u2019t seem like Homicide was destined to be the show that could hold up on Thursday. And we had probably placed a Law & Order there a couple times. But Law & Order was doing very, very nicely, holding up our Wednesday.\n\nBeckman: Law & Order was also a show we didn\u2019t feel was really a young-appealing show. It was more 25-to-54.\n\nSo that left ER.\n\nBeckman: ER just \u2014 you know, it had an attractive cast. It had George Clooney about to explode. It just felt younger.\n\nLittlefield: And it was more exciting.\n\nBeckman: Also, I will say this. With ER, I think we knew what we had. ER was like \u2014 we gotta be out of our minds not to put this Thursday at 10.\n\nLittlefield: That\u2019s true.\n\nWaiting to Launch\n\nBy mid-May, just before NBC officially unveiled its new lineup to advertisers, industry trades were already reporting its bold scheduling ploys. \u201cIn what would be a stunning move \u2026 Peacock web officials have talked about shifting Frasier to Tuesday opposite Roseanne \u2014 a development that would surely bring howls of protest from the show\u2019s supplier, Paramount Network TV,\u201d Variety reported at the time. \u201cSeveral observers questioned the merit of putting a year-old hit against one of TV\u2019s most resilient sitcoms.\u201d NBC also made it known that it would schedule ER in the L.A. Law time slot, even though there had already been buzz, CBS was eyeing Thursdays at 10 for Chicago Hope. Initially, ABC and CBS didn\u2019t react to NBC\u2019s shuffle: The Alphabet announced a new schedule with Roseanne still on Tuesdays, while the Eye went ahead and put Hope against ER. And then came the four-month wait until September.\n\nAfter you saw your competitors\u2019 schedules, did you worry at all about whether you had made the right moves? Any second thoughts over the summer, particularly when ABC decided to replace Roseanne with Home Improvement on Tuesdays opposite Frasier?\n\nLittlefield: We were confident. We were very confident. [With ER], we had a research document that confirmed our greatest hopes and dreams \u2014 five legitimate series stars in this pilot, record-breaking testing versus most every drama that was tested previously. We ran a 60-second spot in the finale of LA Law, and the reaction from the audience, because we were monitoring them \u2014 the reaction to that spot was basically, Get the fuck out of my way. When can I see this show? I can\u2019t wait. I mean, it was that powerful.\n\nAnd so we looked at Chicago Hope, and we said, \u201cYou know, that\u2019s not a bad show. However, it ain\u2019t ER.\u201d We just had such great confidence as we lived with the decision. And each week, the intent-to-view data that was coming in continued to give us more confidence.\n\nBeckman: I remember sitting next to you at the TV Critics Association press tour, when John Wells and the group did their TCA session. And I turned to you after the end of the session and I said, \u201cI\u2019ve never heard a producer or a showrunner talk like that.\u201d I mean, I was so impressed with him.\n\nLittlefield: Yes. Yes.\n\nBeckman: Just how he envisioned the show. I mean, all the years I\u2019d been in the business, if there was ever a slam dunk \u2026 God could have done a talk show [opposite ER]. It didn\u2019t matter. I remember showing Chicago Hope and ER to my wife. She didn\u2019t know which network they were on. Afterwards, I said, \u201cWell, which one would you watch?\u201d And she didn\u2019t even say. She looked at me and she said, \u201cAre you even kidding me?\u201d One show was these young, idealistic doctors in a struggling inner-city hospital, with multiple stories going on in that pilot. Then the other was this pristine, squeaky-clean hospital with these high-paid doctors separating conjoined twins. Come on. What are people gonna watch?\n\nLittlefield: The other thing that came out of test audiences is, they perceived ER to be an action hour. That\u2019s what they called it. Because of the camera work. I mean, the density to the storytelling, the active use of the camera. It was very, very innovative \u2014 and the audience gobbled it up. They were saying, \u201cWell, it\u2019s not really a medical drama. It\u2019s an action hour.\u201d And we just kind of smiled: Okay.\n\nWhat were you thinking about Friends over the summer? As you noted, the pilot hadn\u2019t tested all that well. And there were some other Gen X\u2013targeted sitcoms announced by the other networks: Wild Oats, The Boys Are Back \u2026\n\nBeckman: Friends and Wild Oats kind of got lumped together during the summer: \u201cGee, these two networks made the same show.\u201d They weren\u2019t going head to head, but it was kind of like ER [and] Chicago Hope.\n\nLittlefield: They put Wild Oats on Sunday night, after Married With Children. It was, you know \u2014 not a very good pilot. And it died quickly.\n\nFriends definitely suffered from being lumped in with those other youth comedies. USA Today\u2019s Matt Roush was particularly harsh: \u201cNBC\u2019s Friends and Fox\u2019s sex-crazed Wild Oats pander to Generation X singles. Reality Bites with gingivitis.\u201d So the buzz headed into fall wasn\u2019t great, certainly not compared to how quickly the show exploded with audiences.\n\nLittlefield: It wasn\u2019t a perfect pilot. It was a young cast. They needed more time together to jell. But I would say first, for us, internally, six scripts in, we were like, \u201cWow. This is really absolutely heartfelt, emotional, compelling. And, by the way, it\u2019s pretty funny.\u201d And then, as we started to shoot those episodes, we said, \u201cYou know, this thing is bubbling. We could feel that.\u201d\n\nBeckman: By episode two or three, it was like, Wow. This is funny. It very quickly topped the pilot. Very quickly.\n\nLittlefield: It\u2019s what most pilots are supposed to be. Potential \u2014 when you get in business with the right people, that potential is realized. ER, The Cosby Show, Golden Girls \u2014 they were anomalies. They were fully realized in a pilot. It\u2019s just so rare in a broadcast life that that kind of quality is achieved in a pilot. Mostly, you\u2019re saying, \u201cWhere does the series go? Who am I in business with? What is the potential, and do we bet on this?\u201d And with Friends, the execution of the series was the fulfillment of that bet.\n\nThe Rollout\n\nAs much confidence as Littlefield and Beckman had in their new lineup, and whatever the advance word from critics, both shows still had to face the judgement of viewers. While ER would end up spending its entire 15-year run in the 10 p.m. Thursday slot, the show\u2019s very first episode actually aired on Monday, September 19 as a two-hour NBC movie. Four days later, on September 22, Friends finally premiered at 8:30 p.m Thursday, along with the second installment of ER.\n\nWhy did you choose to run the ER pilot on a Monday rather than Thursday?\n\nLittlefield: It was a two-hour premiere. And we [in the entertainment division] were not allowed to play anything on Thursday night that would cut into the comedies, even repeats of the comedies. Finance wouldn\u2019t let us.\n\nBeckman: And it was premiere week. It would have preempted the premiere of Seinfeld.\n\nLittlefield: That would have been financially painful. But we still had a Monday movie, so ER went in against a unbelievable [Lions versus Cowboys] Monday Night Football game. I had seen the ER pilot probably 26 times. And that night, I\u2019m going back and forth between ER and the NFL. And I\u2019m like, \u201cWe\u2019re screwed. We\u2019re dead. This is \u2014 this is Dallas, America\u2019s team. It\u2019s a nail-biting game. It\u2019s going right down to the final seconds. With my luck, it\u2019ll go to overtime. So it doesn\u2019t matter what time zone you\u2019re in. We\u2019re screwed.\u201d And we woke up the next day, and it was like, \u201cThese look like they\u2019re pretty good numbers.\u201d\n\nBeckman: It did really well. And you know, we had a regular Monday movie then. So it wasn\u2019t like we put this on Monday night without a history of having solid numbers, even against Monday Night Football, with female-oriented movies.\n\nIt was a logical place for it.\n\nBeckman: Oh, yeah.\n\nThen came Thursday. Back then, network execs and journalists would call in to a ratings hotline for numbers early in the day. That Friday morning, how did you find out how Friends and ER did?\n\nBeckman: When I came out [to Los Angeles] in \u201991, things weren\u2019t going all that well. So I kind of stayed in the habit of not looking at ratings until I got to the office. Because I was always afraid if I called up for them, I\u2019d go back to bed and just not want to go work. So I got to the office. And I remember \u2014 it looked like I was opening up a deck of cards. I\u2019d just go down the column. And Friends did okay. I think it did better than we expected; it did fine. Seinfeld was freaking huge. Madman dropped off some kind of acceptable number. But the key number, really, for me, wasn\u2019t Friends. It was ER versus Chicago Hope.\n\nLittlefield: Unlike Preston, I couldn\u2019t wait. I got the numbers at 6 a.m. Mad About You continued to be everything we wanted it to be. Friends was glass-half-full. We expected that there would be a little drop-off; there was some drop-off. It wasn\u2019t terrible. It wasn\u2019t great. It was in the range of acceptability \u2014 but by no means [did we] jump for joy. Seinfeld was, yet again, a resounding tower of strength. Madman of the People was okay. And then ER was very satisfying. It was, Okay. You know what? We hoped and believed we would win this. We felt strongly that we would.\n\nBeckman: And we beat Chicago Hope. There were a lot of people who didn\u2019t think we could beat Chicago Hope.\n\nWhat happened the next week?\n\nBeckman: They both shot in different directions. Chicago Hope took a big dip. And we just blew \u2018em out of the water. It was like, Holy shit.\n\nLittlefield: The second week, literally chills went up my spine.\n\nBeckman: The gap between the two shows was scary. And scary good for us. I remember looking at that number \u2026\n\nLittlefield: \u2026 and it was over for them.\n\nMaking Friends and Influencing Ratings\n\nAfter ER crushed Hope in their second week opposite each other, CBS execs threw in the towel. As late New York Newsday TV columnist Marvin Kittman colorfully described the fallout, Hope, which \u201clooked like it was run over by a truck\u201d was \u201cnow in ICU.\u201d After just two scalpel-to-scalpel showdowns, CBS shifted Hope back an hour to 9 p.m. Thursday, subbing in Connie Chung\u2019s Eye to Eye news mag (and thus making it even easier for ER to gain momentum.) Hope didn\u2019t float opposite Seinfeld, either, and was pulled in the middle of the November sweeps, returning in a new time slot \u2014 Mondays at 10 \u2014 in January 1995. (It ended up lasting six seasons and won multiple Emmys.)\n\nWith Hope gone, ER built up even more momentum at 10 p.m, regularly attracting more than 40 percent of all TV viewers by the end of its first season. There was nothing left to do but enjoy the ratings, the acclaim, and the huge profits. Friends, too, was picking up steam at 8:30 p.m. After initially losing a bit of its Mad About You lead-in, it started building upon the 8 p.m. show. Beckman and Littlefield saw an opportunity. Friends seemed destined not just to be a hit, but an anchor.\n\nWhile you never again moved ER from 10 p.m. Thursday, you obviously shifted Friends. And not just to 8 p.m., where we all remember it. In February of 1995, it got the 9:30 p.m. slot behind Seinfeld.\n\nBeckman: When we were at TCA in January, we had already decided we were gonna do it. Our scheduling grids reflected that. I remember at the TCA party, somebody introduced me to Courteney Cox. She knew who I was, and of course, she immediately started in with me. She said, \u201cOh, you know, you should put us behind Seinfeld.\u201d And I said to her, \u201cWell, that\u2019s what we\u2019re gonna do.\u201d She kind of looked at me like she thought I was bullshitting her. And I\u2019ll never forget, I looked at her \u2014 she was there with her boyfriend then, Michael Keaton \u2014 and I innocently said, \u201cWell, if you wanna come to my car, I\u2019ll show you the grids.\u201d As soon as I said it, I looked at her and I said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I really \u2014 I really didn\u2019t mean [it like] that.\u201d\n\nWhat was the thinking behind the shift to 9:30?\n\nLittlefield: We had seen the episodes. We had so much belief in Friends: The more we shot, the more we watched, the more we believed. And we knew that the future for the show was it was gonna go to Thursday at 8. It was gonna be that kind of cornerstone \u2014 Thursday at 8. Seinfeld would be 9 o\u2019clock, ER at 10. That was the future we were looking at. And therefore, it was like, So, what\u2019s the greatest thing you can now do to ensure as great a number of people come to Friends as we\u2019re planting it for next season? Sandwich it between Seinfeld and ER. I don\u2019t think we had many debates about that one, Pres. We were like, \u201cUndeniable. Let\u2019s do it.\u201d\n\nBeckman: Warren\u2019s right. Remember, this was the era of our imperialist march through the schedule with comedy. [Laughs.] And I think we had also already decided we were gonna move Mad About You to Sunday night the next fall.\n\nLittlefield: Yes, we did. Sunday at 8.\n\nWas putting Friends behind Seinfeld a way to be doubly certain the show had the goods before you put it in a lead-off slot the next season?\n\nBeckman: No. We knew.\n\nLittlefield: There was no second guessing.\n\nEven if Friends made sense at 8 p.m., it was still pretty ballsy that you were even thinking about moving Mad About You off the night. You had just airlifted Frasier and Wings from Thursday to Tuesday, and it worked. You then more than made up for it on Thursdays with Friends and ER. You wanted to shake things up again?\n\nBeckman: We were like, \u201cWe\u2019re just gonna conquer!\u201d We were just gonna conquer the schedule with comedy.\n\nSo replacing seaQuest, which had been airing Sundays at 8, with Mad About You gave you another sitcom block.\n\nLittlefield: We got up to 18 comedies. And we were a business. We were not a nonprofit company. We wanted to use that asset [Mad] to help open up and build another front and become a destination for advertisers as well. The older the show gets, the less you\u2019re able to move it. There was still real strength left in Mad About You. We may have accelerated its decline by the move. But comedies help keep the schedule young. They repeat well. And the highest-viewed hour in television was Sunday night at 8. Mad About You had the strength to go over into one of the most competitive time periods in network television, in that era and still today. It went in, turned on the lights, and established a strong young-adult presence for us. We also thought Friends had the strength to go into 8 o\u2019clock and stay there. And on that guess we were right. It never moved again.\n\nAnd you would dominate on Thursdays well into the next decade.\n\nLittlefield: These three pillars were in place on the night that guaranteed \u2014 no matter how bad we could screw up in the 8:30 or 9:30 time period, those three shows were bulletproof. Regardless of what a local station was doing leading in [at 7:30 p.m.], Friends was a destination. Regardless of what was happening at 8:30, Seinfeld was a destination. The same for ER. And so, through the height of the Must-See years, 75 million Americans were watching at least some of Thursday night on NBC. If you didn\u2019t, you absolutely felt left out. You just didn\u2019t want to show up at work the next day if you couldn\u2019t talk about what was on NBC the night before. It was the place to be in the television universe. And it just was the last time that one network had the best of the best, and everybody wanted to be there.\n\n* This article previously stated that The Cosby Show debuted in 1994.
