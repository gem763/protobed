The actress shared the news in an Instagram post with a series of photos from their trip.\n\n\u201cHe took me to France and made a picnic and made me feel happy and free and then he asked me to marry him and i screamed YES. I love you @benshattuck_art, you are the kindest and brightest and I am so grateful and here we go and keep going,\u201d Slate wrote. In one of the photos, the bride-to-be showed off her ring, which appears to be a dark-colored stone in an antique setting.\n\nShattuck, an artist and writer, also posted the news on his Instagram, with a photo of Slate. \u201cIn an abandoned castle in southern France, I asked this woman to marry me. Here she is in front of a door the color of her soul,\u201d he wrote. It\u2019s all very sweet!\n\nAccording to Us Weekly, Slate and Shattuck made their first debut as a couple at the Sundance Film Festival in January of this year. Prior to dating Shattuck, the 37-year-old actress, who will star in the upcoming Sofia Coppola film, On the Rocks, had dated Chris Evans on and off for two years. She was also married to editor and director Dean Fleischer-Camp for four years, before splitting in 2016.\n\nDuring an episode of Refinery29\u2019s Unstyled podcast back in June, Slate said she \u201creally needed to figure out what I thought about myself when a man was not defining that for me\u201d and described her past relationships as being unhealthy. \u201cI have this faith now \u2014 I do \u2014 that I can have this beautiful relationship with this man that I deeply love,\u201d she said. \u201cThat I can have a full life, that I can live on this peninsula in Massachusetts where I live right now, and have my career, and that I can feel beauty in myself in so many ways.\u201d\n\nAww.
