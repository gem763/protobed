In return, the lawsuit said, MIT leveraged millions of dollars in donations from Fidelity.\n\nMIT and Fidelity have said the allegations have no merit.\n\nThe lawsuit said Fidelity executives took MIT officials on lavish outings, including an NBA Finals game. Court documents show that in 2015, when the university considered other options, an MIT dean emailed the head of an MIT committee overseeing the plan: \"If we're not switching to Vanguard or TIAA Cref, I am going to expect something big and good coming to MIT,\" according to the court records.\n\nJerry Schlichter, the attorney for the plaintiffs, said that soon afterwards, \"Fidelity donated $5 million to MIT.\"\n\nIn a court filing, MIT said the dean who wrote that email \"never had any fiduciary responsibility for the plan.\"\n\nIn a letter to faculty and staff Thursday, MIT Provost Martin Schmidt wrote: \"Although MIT believes firmly that it has managed the 401(k) Plan in careful compliance with the law and in the best interests of its participants, the continued cost and distraction of litigation are likely to be significant. In order to avoid that continued drain of MIT resources, we have reached an agreement to settle the dispute.\"\n\nSchlichter has made a career of suing big company and university retirement plans, claiming they charge excessive fees and hurt workers. He sues to try to force the companies and universities to offer better plans. That has earned him the nickname \"the 401(k) Lone Ranger.\"\n\nGiven that history, assuming the settlement deal holds together and is approved by the court, it could include agreements from the university to change the way it manages its retirement plan.\n\nIn his letter, MIT's Schmidt says, \"We are proud of the retirement benefits offered to our employees and the processes in place to oversee those benefits. MIT is unique among our peers in offering employees both a supplemental 401(k) plan, with an MIT contribution match up to the first 5% of an employee's pay, and a traditional defined-benefit pension plan, paid in full by the Institute.\"\n\nFidelity, which is a financial supporter of NPR, is not named in the case. The company has said that the assertions in the lawsuit \"are completely fictional and wholly irresponsible.\"\n\nExperts say lawsuits like this one have made big companies and universities much more aware of their legal duty to protect their workers' interests in retirement accounts. They say that has helped reduce fees that workers pay in retirement plans at the largest companies. But they say many smaller organizations still have very high fees and bad investment options.", "description": "The lawsuit claimed MIT got millions of dollars in donations from financial giant Fidelity Investments while allowing the firm to charge workers excessive fees.", "authors": ["Chris Arnold"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/09/12/gettyimages-1096028034_wide-e21e42d5fa33767993cdc07c14dac892d2788436.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
