It is unclear if the injury will require the 22-year-old to miss time, though it remains a possibility.\n\nGuice, who had 10 carries for 18 yards against the Eagles, felt discomfort in his right knee on the team bus following the game, coach Jay Gruden said Monday. Gruden left open the possibility of Guice playing in next week\u2019s home opener against the Dallas Cowboys.\n\nGuice\u2019s injury, however, is not to the same knee in which the running back tore his ACL last season. The 2018 second-rounder spent all of last offseason rehabbing from a torn ACL, finally being cleared for contact in Week 3 of the preseason.\n\nIf Guice can\u2019t go, Adrian Peterson will take over as the Redskins\u2019 lead back once again after the 34-year-old was inactive in Week 1.\n\n\u201cI have no problem with that,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cWe\u2019ll find out what happens though. We\u2019re going to check this MRI out. We\u2019re hopeful and there\u2019s a chance they could both be up this week. We\u2019ll make that determination later.\u201d\n\nGuice seemed to be in an upbeat mood when talking to reporters following Sunday\u2019s loss. At one point during the game, the running back went into the team\u2019s medical tent in the second quarter, but later said he went because \u201cnature called.\u201d Guice returned to the field on the next possession.\n\nGruden said Monday that Guice was evaluated for an in-game injury and was cleared to return.\n\nIn total, the running back played 24 snaps \u2014 or just 36% of the team\u2019s offensive plays. Gruden said that was based on the flow of the game, noting the Redskins struggled to run the ball.\n\nLast week, Gruden had expressed great confidence in Guice \u2014 telling reporters the offense would \u201cgo through\u201d the LSU product in terms of carries. The Redskins felt Guice had returned to form following his ACL tear and Gruden then made the choice to keep Peterson inactive in Philadelphia, partially because of the veteran\u2019s inability to play special teams.\n\nGruden\u2019s decision, however, proved to be controversial within the Redskins\u2019 locker room. In a radio interview Monday, right tackle Morgan Moses called the benching a \u201cslap in the face,\u201d adding he plans to talk to his coaches about it. Running back Chris Thompson told reporters, \u201cI think that one decision just changed everything for a lot of people,\u201d though he noted it didn\u2019t change anything for him.\n\nAsked about Moses\u2019 comments, Gruden again defended sitting Peterson, citing the team\u2019s needs for help on special teams.\n\nGruden said he \u201cfor sure\u201d wants Peterson to remain on the Redskins. He repeatedly mentioned Peterson could be active at some point this season, even as soon as next week.\n\n\u201cWe have 15 games left,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of the season left. I expect Adrian Peterson to play and play well when he does play. It could be this week. And Adrian is ready to go. He\u2019s got a great attitude about it. I know he\u2019s not happy about it, but when his number is called, he\u2019ll be ready to go.\n\n\u201cAnd his number will be called.\u201d\n\nPeterson\u2019s number, of course, could be called against Dallas if Guice isn\u2019t healthy enough to play. Guice\u2019s injury also prompts more questions. Namely, can the running back handle a full workload as the Redskins want him to do? Will this injury, should he miss time, make them reconsider?\n\nGruden said the Redskins will make those decisions once learning Guice\u2019s MRI results.\n\n\u201cThe whole point of having one lead down back is making sure that guy can handle the carries,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cIf he can\u2019t handle all the carries, then you\u2019ve got to have two. And so, that could alter your plans a little bit. So we\u2019ll make adjustments as need be. Fortunately, we have AP in the building.\n\n\u201cHopefully, Guice will be OK. We\u2019ll make that tough decision when it needs to be made.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
