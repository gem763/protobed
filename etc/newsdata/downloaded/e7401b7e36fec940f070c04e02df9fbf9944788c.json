The son of one of the missing men and a bystander on a weekend away with friends had initiated a search, but only the missing men\u2019s fishing gear and personal items could be found on rocks where they had been fishing, read the statement.\n\nNSRI Gordon\u2019s Bay sea rescue craft were launched and rescue swimmers in sea rescue vehicles from both NSRI Kleinmond and the local base responded, as well as the provicnial government\u2019s Health EMS rescue squad and GBMed ambulance services.\n\n\u201cOn arrival on the scene, a sea and shoreline search commenced for the two adult males who were suspected to be missing in the surf after their fishing gear and personal items were found where they had been fishing indicating that they may have been swept off rocks by a wave,\u201d said Bauser.\n\nIn an extensive sea and shore search joined by NSRI Kleinmond and Simon\u2019s Town, both fishermen were located off-shore in the surf and cardio pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was performed continuously on the boat and en route to the NSRI Gordon\u2019s Bay base. Sadly after all efforts were exhausted, the men were declared deceased.\n\nIt remains unknown if the men had both been swept off rocks by a wave as no eye-witnesses have come forward.\n\nPolice have opened an inquest docket.\n\nThe bodies of the two deceased fishermen were taken into the care of the government Health Forensic Pathology Services.\n\nPaul described his cousin Rodney, whom he regarded a brother because of their tight bond, as a well-loved community member who befriended many including his four children\u2019s friends.\n\n\u201cHe was a loving patriarch who served as father figure to many others. Rodney was also popular at work, so much so that his employer at Supergroup in Strand enquired about considering the possibility to bury him in his work attire,\u201d said Paul.\n\nThe bereaved relative said Rodney was a passionate hobby fisherman who frequented Dappat se Gat, the nostalgic spot where he and his late father used to fish.\n\nRodney was also an avid rugby player who back in the day played as wing for the then Somerset West Rugby Club.\n\nPaul said Rodney will be remembered for his helpfulness, compassion and unique friendship.\n\nRodney is survived by his wife, Genevieve, and four children, sons Morn\u00e9, Shuaib and Ruben, and daughter Farren.\n\nA memorial service for Rodney will be held at the Macassar High School hall at 19:30 today (Thursday), followed by another to be held at the Firgrove Primary School hall, at 19:30 on Wednesday 16 October. A funeral service will take place at the Macassar High School hall at 09:00 on Saturday 19 October.\n\nYusuf\u2019s wife, Ina, shared the memories of their last moments together, saying that she last saw him when he had dropped her off at work minutes before 07:00 on Saturday.\n\n\u201cWe were jovial and enjoyed conversations. We were looking forward to camping in the Northern Cape during the festive holidays and spending time with my father, who my husband adored,\u201d said an emotional Ina who had to formally identify her husband\u2019s body on Monday.\n\nShe admired Yusuf as someone who would put everything including work aside for the opportunity to lend a helping hand to others.\n\nShe said he had an admirable passion for children to whom he gifted his love and guidance regardless of who their parents are.\n\nThe self-employed electrician was also known for his involvement in the community and local schools.\n\n\u201cHe will be remembered for the straight, humoristic person he was,\u201d she added.\n\nA funeral service for Yusuf will be held at the Victory Praise and Worship church on Saturday 12 October.", "description": "Two Macassar families have been thrust into mourning following the tragic drowning of two beloved fishermen at the weekend.", "authors": ["Jamey Gordon"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9455/b3f33508b0d84f9cba0511d0e67b95e5.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
