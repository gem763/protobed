That percentage constituted about 40 of the 659 overnight stays.\n\nIt was unclear whether the spending amounts disclosed by the Pentagon were a direct match for those 40 overnight stays or involved additional flights and personnel. A Defense Department spokesperson did not immediately return comment.\n\nCommittee chairman Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., and subcommittee chairman Rep. James Raskin, D-Md., said in a new letter to the Pentagon that the new figures revealed that \"far more taxpayer funds have been spent at the President\u2019s resort than previously known.\u201d\n\n\"Unfortunately, the Department\u2019s response has been woefully inadequate,\" Cummings and Raskin wrote. \"To date, the Department has produced only 21 pages of material\u2014half of which appear to be publicly available on government websites. The Department failed to produce any underlying invoices or travel records relating to spending at Trump Turnberry or Prestwick Airport. It is unclear why the Department has taken so long to produce such rudimentary and deficient information.\"\n\nHenry Nicholls/Reuters\n\nBoth congressmen asked the Pentagon for additional information about how many rooms had been booked by U.S. military personnel at the government rate noting that the dollar amounts provided by the Pentagon suggested that more than 650 rooms had been booked at the resort.\n\nAccording to Air Force statistics provided to reporters last week, the number of U.S. refueling stops at Prestwick and overnight stays in the Glasgow area has increased year by year since 2015. That year there were 95 refueling stops with 40 overnight stays. In 2016 there were 145 refueling stops with 75 overnight stays; in 2017 there were 180 refueling stops with 116 overnight stays; and in 2018 there were 257 refueling stops with 208 overnight stays in Scotland. Through August of this year there have been 259 refueling stops with 220 overnight stays.\n\nAir Force officials said the increase in refueling stops is due to the airport's 24 hour-a-day operations and better weather than other airports in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe Air Force is now reviewing its overnight lodging guidelines for pilots on layovers in light of the attention raised by a C-17 crew's stay at the Trump Turnberry resort in March.\n\nAccording to Air Force officials, a local contractor was unable to find closer lodging accommodations for the C-17 crew and found cheaper government rates at the Trump property.\n\nThe Trump property nightly rate of $136 was less expensive than the $161 charged by a nearby Marriott property. Both of those rates were below the per diem rate of $166.\n\nOn the return flight from Kuwait, the C-17 crew stayed at the nearby Marriott property.", "description": "Pentagon tells Congress that review of records shows military personnel have spent at least $184,000 at the Trump Turnberry resort in Scotland on layovers.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/turnberry-1-gty-er-190909_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
