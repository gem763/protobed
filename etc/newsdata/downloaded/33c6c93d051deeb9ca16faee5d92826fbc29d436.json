Lindsey Graham about his lack of action in Syria to protect the Kurds.\n\n\u201cLindsey Graham would like to stay in the Middle East for the next thousand years with thousands of soldiers, fighting other people\u2019s wars,\u201d Trump said, criticizing the South Carolina senator\u2019s position.\n\nTrump spoke about Graham in response to a question from ABC News reporter Jonathan Karl during a press conference at the White House with Italian President Sergio Mattarella.\n\nGraham voiced his strong opposition to Trump\u2019s lack of action in Syria, publicly criticizing the president for suggesting countries like Russia, Iran, and Turkey should secure Syria and protect the Kurds.\n\n\u201cI firmly believe that if President Trump continues to make such statements this will be a disaster worse than President Obama\u2019s decision to leave Iraq,\u201d Graham said on Wednesday.\n\nTrump suggested that Graham was overreaching his authority.\n\n\u201cI think Lindsey should focus on Judiciary,\u201d Trump replied.\n\nThe president even hinted that Graham was out of step with his constituents, as the senator faces reelection in 2020.\n\n\u201cThe people of South Carolina don\u2019t want us to get into a war with Turkey, a NATO member, or with Syria. Let them fight their own wars; they\u2019ve been fighting for a thousand years,\u201d Trump said.\n\nThe president reminded the press that he campaigned on bringing the troops home from the Middle East.\n\n\u201cI won an election on that, and that\u2019s the way it is, whether it\u2019s good or bad. That\u2019s the way it is,\u201d he said.", "description": "President Donald Trump responded Wednesday to criticism from Sen.
