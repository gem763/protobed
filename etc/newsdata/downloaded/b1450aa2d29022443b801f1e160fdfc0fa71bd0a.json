I didn't realize how horrible mine where until I purchased these. They're a favorite of anyone who comes by for a visit. My parents loved the look, durability and sharpness and went out and bought the same ones.\u201d\n\nSays another: \u201cI had some very nice culinary knives but my ex took them when he left (you know how that goes). I was worried that these would not be that great since they\u2019re so inexpensive but they\u2019re awesome! They look beautiful on my countertop. I chose the white and they\u2019re so stylish. I think they also cut better than my culinary knives! I love these.\u201d\n\nShop it: Cuisinart C77WTR-15P Triple Rivet Collection 15-Piece Cutlery Block Set, White, $58 (was $160), amazon.com\n\nRead More from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.\n\nWant daily pop culture news delivered to your inbox?
