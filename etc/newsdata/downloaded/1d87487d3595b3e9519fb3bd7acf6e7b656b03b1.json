Next, when enough fungi have been collected, comes a session of boiling, mashing and patting, and the addition of colourful leaves and flowers until the mixture is ready to place in a mould.\n\nThe final result, some hours later, will be a colourful and individual sheet of mushroom paper \u2013 along with a beneficial sense of wellbeing, calm and peace.\n\n\u201cPeople tell me the whole process is quite meditative and mindful,\u201d says Fergus Drennan, who teaches hugely popular mushroom-paper-making classes at Coleman\u2019s Hatch village hall in East Sussex. Nearby Ashdown Forest is, he says, a \u201cparadise of fungal opportunities\u201d.\n\nHis regular sessions are just one of a booming number of unusual and quirky arts and crafts workshops capturing people\u2019s imaginations across Britain and fuelling record participation.\n\nFrom the Japanese art of Kintsugi to macram\u00e9 masterclasses and lingerie sewing, classes across the country have doubled in the past year to more than 7,500. And it\u2019s the eco-conscious younger set driving demand, says Sam Richards, UK director of Eventbrite, the website where users post details of their workshops.\n\nTwentysomethings want hobbies stressing their \u201cindividuality and creativity\u201d, she said. \u201cSo it\u2019s all about the satisfaction of making something that\u2019s uniquely you.\u201d\n\nFor Drennan, a self-declared forager, mushroom paper-making started as a bit of fun. The classes then evolved on a whim, but gathered momentum from the surge in demand for more unusual types of arts and crafts.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the most wonderful, bonkers, craziest use of mushrooms,\u201d says Drennan, who has even created a 150-page book made entirely of fungi.\n\nAt \u00a370 a time his lessons are not cheap, but they fill up almost as soon as they get announced \u2013 and it\u2019s not just the locals, either. Drennan says people travel from all over the country to take part in his sessions. Next month he\u2019s taking the class on the road with a workshop at the Heckfield Place hotel in Hampshire.\n\nThe growth of craft classes is also about finding \u201ctherapeutic respite\u201d from the stresses of a competitive digital and work culture, says Richard Cope of Mintel, \u201cand a way to sidestep untrustworthy, unethical and unsustainable manufacturing\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A book made out of mushrooms made by Fergus Drennan, who runs paper making classes in Sussex.

It\u2019s not a cheaper option than high street retailers, because the workshops use high-end fabrics such as laces and silks, but \u201cit\u2019s an incredibly satisfying and creative way to use your mind\u201d.\n\nStudents are normally stunned by the hard work and detailed stitching that goes into a simple pair of pants. \u201cAnd making a bra to your own size is even more complex,\u201d she says.\n\nA few streets away, in a back room of the Islington Townhouse pub, Zack Mclaughlin, 36, is setting up an altogether different type of workshop. It\u2019s sort of \u201cethical taxidermy\u201d he jokes, pointing to wire-based sculptures depicting humming birds, owls, hares and butterflies.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re what I\u2019m inspired by, so that\u2019s what I make and teach,\u201d he says.\n\nAn illustrator by training, Mclaughlin never really thought of himself as having any skills worthy of passing on. But a one-off workshop five years ago (that sold out) spiralled into regular monthly and then weekly classes \u2013 and it\u2019s been a big boost to his income.\n\nNext week alone he\u2019s running three classes \u2013 typically with 18 to 30 people signed up, all paying \u00a325 each (\u00a375 for the butterfly class, which has more involved processes, he says).\n\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s got different skill levels, and they come in with different ideas of what they want to make. Normally they go away very happy \u2013 but it\u2019s a social thing too. You meet new people and have a few drinks while you\u2019re making stuff,\u201d he says.\n\nIn Bristol, 27-year-old Farah Merali has turned the social side of craft classes into a brand new business, by opening a cafe themed entirely around them.\n\nThe idea, she says, is that the cafe \u2013called Farahway \u2013 will become a hub for ethical craft workshops, offering everything from how to make a baby\u2019s turban to tutorials on creating reusable face cloths, all with coffee and cake on the side at the same time.\n\n\u201cFor my generation especially, a lot of it is about picking up a practical new skill and hanging out with likeminded people,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cAlso, it\u2019s just nice to make something.\u201d", "description": "Quirky arts and crafts workshops are booming across Britain as eco-conscious millennials seek out new ways to unwind", "authors": ["Rob Walker"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/adc4d0ac6755f626c4df6f64be36dd3e3270b5d7/0_345_1936_1162/master/1936.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f21be5187fd39c17c634f997a124b960", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
