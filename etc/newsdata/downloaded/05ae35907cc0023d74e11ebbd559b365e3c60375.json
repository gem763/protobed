Here\u2019s What to Expect", "language": "en", "text": "Bakkt is finally here.\n\nAfter two delays and 13 months of questions, the Intercontinental Exchange-backed bitcoin warehouse and futures contract facilitator is launching Monday, opening the door for institutional investors to take positions on the cryptocurrency in a federally regulated venue.\n\nTrading is set to open at midnight UTC and close at 22:00. For the first time, interested observers will be able to see just how much pent-up demand there is among big-money traders for this hotly anticipated service. Bakkt\u2019s data feed will be freely available through June of next year, after which it will require a subscription, according to a company FAQ.\n\nAs often noted, Bakkt\u2019s futures will be physically settled, meaning buyers receive bitcoin at expiration, whereas the futures available since 2017 at the Chicago exchange CME Group are cash-settled \u2013 essentially side bets on the cryptocurrency\u2019s price.\n\nBut what may be most unique about ICE\u2019s bitcoin futures contracts is that they expire after a day. According to the daily contract\u2019s specifications, the bitcoin will be delivered on the second business day after the contract\u2019s date.\n\nFor most commodities \u2013 frozen concentrated orange juice, cocoa, what have you \u2013 the underlying asset is typically not delivered for at least 30 days (although ICE also offers one-day contracts for silver and gold).\n\nWhile Bakkt is also offering a 30-day bitcoin futures contract, the one-day version will essentially allow institutions to buy or sell bitcoin in a way that\u2019s more familiar to them than the helter-skelter world of crypto exchanges.\n\nAs Lanre Sarumi, CEO of crypto derivatives exchange operator LevelTradingField, put it:\n\n\u201cThe dailies make their offering like the cash market, but with the ability to short. That\u2019s huge.\u201d\n\nThe contract is \u201cwell-designed,\u201d Sarumi added. \u201cThe basis to the cash market would be very tight. It\u2019ll be interesting to see if it\u2019s the lead or the follower. In theory the cash market should dictate the price of the derivatives [futures] market. In practice, it\u2019s the other way around for a lot of commodities.\u201d\n\nFor this reason, Sarumi said he believes the daily contract \u201cwill come out of the gate strong.\u201d\n\nRemain calm\n\nThat being said, it is unlikely that ICE\u2019s new futures contracts will have a significant near-term impact on the general crypto market, particularly given the company is not looking for retail customers, who make up the bulk of traders still.\n\nBakkt anticipates significant institutional demand for its futures contract, though it remains to be seen how significant it actually is.\n\n\u201cWe could see decent trading volumes for the product,\u201d said John Todaro, director of research at TradeBlock, a provider of institutional trading tools. \u201cI would expect, however, that the demand would be somewhat in line with current cash-settled contracts, such as those offered by the CME.\u201d\n\nTrading volumes for derivatives contracts traditionally outpace trading volumes seen in the underlying spot market, Todaro told CoinDesk.\n\n\u201cAs the digital currency space continues to mature we should see an increase in volumes for these products relative to spot over time,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, it is unlikely that there will be an immediate surge in demand. Institutional adoption won\u2019t occur with a single catalyst, Todaro said, adding:\n\n\u201cIt will take time for these entities to become comfortable with the asset class, identify strategies that are best used to trade the space, understand crypto market liquidity, and also understand the different regulatory and tax obligations across jurisdictions they operate in.\u201d\n\nIt is unclear how much bitcoin has been sent to Bakkt since the New York Stock Exchange\u2019s sister company opened its warehouse up for customers to deposit bitcoin on Sept. 6. Each customer must pledge a minimum $3,900 of assets in collateral to purchase a contract. (Speculators must pledge nearly $4,300.)\n\nBakkt has not disclosed any addresses for its custodian\u2019s wallet or said how much bitcoin has been deposited since the warehouse opened this month. A spokesperson did not answer questions about the matter by deadline.\n\nBroader impact\n\nCaveats aside, ICE launching futures contracts is a significant move for the industry. Todaro noted that \u201ctraditional financial institutions are quite conservative.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe offering demonstrates that more and more Wall Street institutions are taking a close look at digital currencies and want to gain exposure to this new asset class,\u201d he said.\n\nIt is possible that \u201csome of the recent positive market moves across digital currencies have been from traders acting on the Bakkt launch,\u201d Todaro said.\n\nBakkt\u2019s launch may be a positive sign for other highly anticipated products in the U.S., such as a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). Last week. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Jay Clayton expressed concerns with the cryptocurrency market\u2019s maturity.\n\nDerivatives products, like futures contracts, are more tightly regulated than the underlying spot market, and may be more comforting to regulators and potential institutional customers alike.\n\nTodaro concluded:\n\n\u201cThis offering, in addition to the CME\u2019s, can help regulators become more comfortable with digital asset trading and market infrastructure.\u201d\n\nBakkt CEO Kelly Loeffler image via CoinDesk archives", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.coindesk.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kelly-Loeffler.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
