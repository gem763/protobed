China has denied these claims.\n\n'It's Hong Kong, not China'\n\nThe rallying cry of the protesters was also for the protection of \"Muslims, journalists and the people\".\n\nLast Sunday, a police water cannon fired bursts of blue-dyed water at a small group of people outside a mosque during protests in Tsim Sha Tsui, drawing criticism from some in the Muslim community.\n\nBilly, 26, a salesman, who did not want to give his full name, said he turned out on Sunday because he was angry at the spraying of the mosque.\n\n\"Hong Kong people, regardless of our religion ... we come here to say no to our totalitarian government,\" he told Reuters news agency, adding he wanted to protest peacefully.\n\n\"I have a little bit of fear ... because our police sometimes are uncontrollable and they threaten the safety of our people.\"\n\nCindy Chu, 65, a retired nurse, said she was there to support journalists. When asked if she really wanted to give her full name, she told Reuters: \"I am not afraid. If Hong Kong people are afraid of things like that, then the ending is not good.\"\n\nPolice brutality\n\nHong Kong police have faced criticism for responding with heavy-handed tactics including tear gas, pepper spray, rubber bullets and water cannon to subdue protesters.\n\nPolice dogs have been seen at protest clearance operations without any protective gear while riot officers wearing respirator masks fired tear gas.\n\nThe movement's supporters say exposing dogs to tear gas amounts to animal cruelty and threatens their lives.\n\nPolice deny accusations of brutality, saying they have shown restraint in life-threatening situations.", "description": "Police detained some protesters who converged to denounce perceived police brutality over months of unrest.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/27/f56ff5f9a6ae4bdd804f9c3af4468bee_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
