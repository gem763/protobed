Police recovered a metal pipe that was still in the suspect\u2019s hands when he was arrested after fleeing following the attacks.\n\nThe chief said he also is homeless.\n\n\u201cThe motive appears to be right now, just random attacks; it doesn\u2019t seem any of them (the victims) was targeted by race, age anything of that nature,\u201d Baldassano said.\n\nTwo witnesses told responding officers that the suspect was wearing a black jacket and black pants, which helped police find him quickly just a few streets away.\n\nTwo of the men were killed on the Bowery, which cuts through the heart of Chinatown and has for decades been known as New York\u2019s skid row, inhabited by homeless people who misuse drugs and alcohol.\n\nDuring the day, the increasingly gentrified neighborhood is bustling with small businesses and street vendors offering discount goods, its sidewalks packed with pedestrians.\n\nLate at night, when the shops close, it turns into a quiet, desolate neighborhood that was the setting for Saturday\u2019s attacks.\n\nThe victims were attacked in three different locations near the intersection of the Bowery and East Broadway. One died of blunt trauma to the head. A second man was attacked nearby but survived. He was hospitalized in critical condition. Police planned to question him as soon as possible.\n\nThe other three victims, attacked about a block away, also died of head trauma.\n\nThe identities of the victims have not been released.\n\nBaldassano said police were searching the neighborhood for any other possible victims.\n\nAnother homeless man who had slept in the area, Stephen Miller, said he knew one of the victims as kind and quiet.\n\n\u201cNo one knew him by name, but we saw him every day,\u201d Miller said. \u201cAt this point, I\u2019m just sad. This guy never did anything. Just had a life to live. It sucks that he\u2019s out here in the rain and everything but it doesn\u2019t mean he doesn\u2019t have a life to live.\u201d\n\nUptick in homelessness in New York\n\nNew York City\u2019s homeless population has grown in recent years, to a great extent because of the lack of affordable housing.\n\nHomeless people remain among the city\u2019s most vulnerable residents. Over the last five years, an average of seven have been slain each year.\n\nThe city, which has a population of more than 8 million and is the largest in the US, has a variety of shelters and services, including around the Bowery area of Manhattan, close to Chinatown.\n\nMore than 133,200 different men, women and children slept in the city\u2019s shelter system, according to the Coalition for the Homeless, in the 2018 fiscal year.\n\n\u201cIt should serve as a reminder to all of us that our homeless neighbors live without the protection and privacy of a home,\u201d the organization said in a statement about the murders. \u201cThey are our fellow human beings and deserve the dignity and safety that a home assures.\u201d\n\nThe organization also found that more than 63,000 people slept in a shelter each night in February 2019, up 150% from 2009.\n\nThe Bowery Mission, an advocacy group, said nearly 4,000 sleep each night on the streets, other public spaces or in the the subway, which runs 24 hours a day.\n\nThis week, the city\u2019s public transit body, the Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA), said the number of homeless people living in the subways jumped 20% from last year to 2,178 people.\n\nFollowing an uptick in homelessness under the mayor, Bill de Blasio, advocates for the homeless have ramped up calls for more affordable housing in the city. The last significant reduction in homelessness in New York took place just before the economic recession.", "description": "A 24-year old suspect is in custody after series of attacks in New York\u2019s Chinatown neighborhood, police say", "authors": ["Amanda Holpuch", "Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ad6968d6c1763d58cf9169a24ba347565840acd/0_54_1694_1016/master/1694.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5b71900ec786e5b1b1ecea4d6b60b7fe", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
