As we found out with the RTX 2080 Max Q and the $2,999 MSI GS75, gaming laptops equipped with the new cards are considerably more expensive than laptops with the last generation cards were.\n\nFortunately, thanks to the wide spread of RTX configurations that Nvidia is offering, it is possible to get the new platform\u2019s features without buying the top-spec options. The RTX 2060 GPU is both the lowest ranking GPU and least expensive in Nvidia\u2019s lineup, yet it has many of the same capabilities that improve graphics quality, such as ray tracing (DXR) and deep learning super-sampling (DLSS). Compared to its four counterparts \u2014 the RTX 2070, 2080, and their Max Q variants \u2014 the lower priced RTX 2060 is best positioned to be an affordable solution.\n\nTo see how the mobile 2060 compares to the more expensive options, I\u2019ve been using Acer\u2019s Predator Triton 500. It\u2019s a relatively lightweight gaming laptop that retails for $1,799.99, which is considerably less than the other RTX laptops I\u2019ve tested. It comes with promising specs and a design I\u2019ve grown fond of. But what really stands out about the Predator Triton 500 is its performance per dollar.\n\nOur review of Acer Predator Triton 500 Verge Score 7 out of 10 Good Stuff Excellent gaming performance\n\nInoffensive design\n\nFast, bright display\n\nStays cool Bad Stuff Fans are very loud in normal / Turbo modes\n\nWeak speakers\n\nAwful boot-up sound Buy for $1,799.99 from Amazon Buy for $1,869.99 from Walmart\n\nCompared to the 2070 and 2080 GPUs, the RTX 2060 has 1920 CUDA cores, 6GB of GDDR5 memory, a base clock of 960MHz, a boost clock of 1200MHz, and it draws anywhere from 80 to 90 watts of power. Those numbers may rank lower than its counterparts, but it\u2019s the only real-world performance that really puts the RTX 2060 in perspective.\n\nAcer Predator Triton 500 specs 15.6-inch 144Hz IPS LED 1080p display with 300 nits brightness and 3ms response time\n\nIntel Core i7-8750H (2.2GHz, Turbo Boost up to 4.1GHz)\n\nNvidia RTX 2060 graphics with 6GB of dedicated GDDR6 VRAM with overclocking\n\nTwo stereo speakers with Waves MaxxAudio enhancements\n\n16GB DDR4 RAM\n\n512GB PCIe NVMe solid state drive (SSD)\n\nPrecision touchpad\n\nWiFi / Bluetooth 5.0 / Ethernet port\n\nWeighs 4.41 pounds\n\nMeasures 14.11 (x) x 10.04 (d) x 0.7 (h) inches\n\nTwo-year warranty\n\nIn my testing, Battlefield V\u2019s Firestorm battle royale mode ran smoothly at 70 fps, on ultra settings with DirectX 12, DLSS, and DXR (ray tracing) enabled. Forza Horizon 4, an open-world racing game with great visuals, runs like butter at the 98 fps mark with graphics set to ultra. Rainbow Six: Siege, a competitive first-person shooter title scored 101 fps on Ultra.\n\nThe point is, even if this Acer\u2019s RTX 2060 graphics card doesn\u2019t have quite enough power to push games to the display\u2019s native 144Hz refresh rate, it provides enough performance to deliver a rich experience in those games. Compared to the RTX 2080 Max Q, the RTX 2060 is usually 30 to 40 fps slower, but it can still maintain at least 60 fps or more in demanding games.\n\nAnother first-person shooter, Call of Duty: Black Ops IV, ran at a steady 83 fps with its graphics settings maxed out as well. While playing Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice maxed out isn\u2019t the most graphically intense benchmark out there, it performs steadily at 60 fps, which is the frame rate limit of the game.\n\nLike virtually every other gaming laptop, the Triton 500\u2019s fans always kick on while gaming, but what I didn\u2019t expect is that that they could be heard by everyone within earshot of my desk. The searing heat coming off the sides (near the fan vents) and near the top of the keyboard is noticeable, as is the underside. I would not recommend using the Triton 500 on your lap for long periods of time, as the heat can get uncomfortable.\n\nThankfully, you can manually control fan speeds (and mitigate some of that heat) using PredatorSense, a preloaded Windows 10 app that lets you enable performance features, such as enhanced cooling (Acer calls it \u201cCoolBoost\u201d) and GPU overclocking. The boosted fan mode creates even more noise than \u201cAuto\u201d or \u201cMax\u201d modes so I avoid using it; GPU overclocking is a different story.\n\n\u201cLoud and powerful\u201d sums up the Triton 500\n\nThe Acer has a trick up its sleeve in the form of a very prominent \u201cTurbo\u201d button on the upper left margin of the keyboard. Pressing it boosts the RTX 2060\u2019s core clock speed from 960MHz to 1060MHz \u2014 a 100MHz overclock \u2014 which is something you can set in the PredatorSense app, too. Doing so results in a real-world performance boost of around 10 to 15 fps in the games that I tested. A caveat of using this feature is that you\u2019ll be forcing the fans to run at high speeds, creating enough noise that you\u2019d still be able to hear them even while wearing headphones. Ultimately, I\u2019d say only use Turbo mode if you\u2019re not getting the performance numbers you want, or if the sound of spinning aeroblades isn\u2019t bothersome.\n\nWithout a doubt, the RTX 2060 is a graphics card capable of playing the latest games at their highest settings with playable frame rates. Meanwhile older, less graphics-intensive games like League of Legends, Counter-Strike: GO, and Overwatch all return similar results (maxed-out settings with playable frame rates well beyond 80 fps).\n\nAs a productivity machine, the Triton 500\u2019s has been satisfying to use. Our unit\u2019s configuration weighs 4.41 pounds and doesn\u2019t weigh my backpack down too much during commutes. The low-profile keyboard works well, has comfortable key travel at 1.6mm, comes with keycaps that are larger than you\u2019ll find on a Razer Blade, and features three-zone RGB backlighting that you can make use of in a dimly lit room. There are also dedicated hardware control keys on the right side that I really appreciate. Volume, playback, power, and \u201cPredatorSense\u201d are all easily distinguishable and best of all, don\u2019t interfere with other keys in the Triton 500\u2019s keyboard layout. I wouldn\u2019t be able to stand another laptop with an unusually placed key.\n\nWindows Hello is missing from another $1,000-plus laptop\n\nInterestingly, Acer includes anti-ghosting tech \u2014 which allows you to rapidly press the same key without \u201closing\u201d the input \u2014 but for only 18 keys out of the whole keyboard. (The Q, W, E, A, S, D, Z, X, C, V, Left-Shift, Left-CTRL, Left-ALT, space, and four arrow keys support anti-ghosting.) I\u2019m not sure whether Acer is trying to be cost-effective by not including the feature for all of the keys, like the \u201cR\u201d key, for example, which is frequently used in PC gaming as an \u201cultimate\u201d move or a reload button.\n\nMoving away from the keyboard to the touchpad, I\u2019m happy to say it uses Windows Precision drivers, works smoothly, and is reliable to use. It might be a bit on the small side, but gestures and multitouch actions work well and without any issues. If you\u2019re going to be serious about playing games, you\u2019ll need an external mouse anyway.\n\nWhile the keyboard and touchpad situation is great, the speakers are another story. They\u2019re tinny, lack the sort of bass that would give the speakers presence in a room, and perform worse at higher volumes. Playing a game with the fans on full blast means you won\u2019t even hear the speakers over the cacophony of the cooling system. If you plan on gaming, watching movies, or listening to music on the Triton 500, just use headphones instead.\n\nThe Predator Triton 500\u2019s battery life while browsing the web (using Chrome exclusively) isn\u2019t great, clocking in at four hours and 15 minutes. While this is the norm for most lightweight gaming laptops, I was hoping the Triton 500\u2019s energy-conscious graphics would make some sort of a difference. With the display set to 50 percent brightness, no Bluetooth, the \u201cBetter Battery\u201d power plan enabled, and overclocking set to off, I could never reach the five-hour mark.\n\nIt\u2019s a great value if you can ignore the fans\n\nThe Triton 500 has a few annoyances that I wish it didn\u2019t have, but none of them are bad enough to be deal-breakers. The webcam is particularly awful, there\u2019s no Windows Hello login support, all of the ports are toward the middle of the computer instead of more conveniently positioned toward the back, and, worst of all, there\u2019s an obnoxious racecar boot-up sound effect that plays when you turn the system on, which I haven\u2019t figured out how to disable.\n\nBased on my experience with the Triton 500, it appears that the RTX 2060 is the sweet spot for performance and value for this graphics generation. Its gaming performance holds up to the higher-end mobile RTX cards at a significantly lower cost while also staying energy conscious, making it suitable for OEMs to use in thinner, lightweight machines, like the Triton 500.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking at the new field of RTX laptops and wincing at the price tags, my suggestion would be to go with the models using the 2060 chip, which still provide top-tier performance and are significantly less expensive than the higher-end configurations.", "description": "You don\u2019t need to spend top dollar for top performance \u2014 at least, that\u2019s what Acer is pushing with the Predator Triton 500 gaming laptop. It has an RTX 2060 chip that is capable of DLSS and RTX, and it can push games past 60 fps on a 144Hz screen.", "authors": ["Stefan Etienne", "Apr"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2vUiKF_YLPiyiYnfw3tUJEc4Gok=/0x255:2040x1323/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16001460/akrales_190329_3269_0121.jpg", "published_at": "2019-04-09"}
