He spoke from a jail in Iraq, where he has been sentenced to death, reports the New York Times.\n\nBaghdadi, 48, blew himself up with a suicide vest after being cornered in Syria by US special forces, the president said.\n\nThe operation was first suggested roughly a month ago when the US began to receive intelligence on the whereabouts of Baghdadi, including 'helpful' information from the Kurds.\n\nTwo weeks ago intelligence officials were about 'scope out' the ISIS leader's exact whereabouts.\n\n(Image: AL-FURQAN MEDIA/AFP via Getty Im)\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nBut it was only three days ago that Trump became aware of the plans to take out Baghdadi.\n\nAs part of the plan the US had to secure permission from Russia to fly over its airspace.\n\nTrump said the White House did not disclose the nature of the operation to Russia, but told Russian officials they would \"like\" it.\n\nOn Saturday, Trump arrived back at the White House at roughly 4.30pm local time (10:30pm in Syria) after a round of golf in Virginia, according to his official schedule.\n\nAt around 5pm, he gathered in the White House Situation Room with Vice President Mike Pence, Defense Secretary Mark Esper, national security adviser Robert O'Brien, and other intelligence officials.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nThey watched the raid unfold live \"as if you were watching a movie,\" said Trump.\n\nThe raid soon got underway with US military personnel and military dogs lifted-off in eight helicopters from an as-yet unidentified military base in the Middle East.\n\nA US official told Reuters the operation was staged from an airbase in western Iraq.\n\nThe on-the-ground operation in the Idlib region of Syria was supported by military aircraft and ships, said Trump. The soldiers were also equipped with a military robot but did not ultimately use it.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nWhen they arrived at Baghdadi's compound the helicopters came under gunfire but US forces were able to quickly suppress the assault and land safely.\n\nBelieving the main compound door to be booby trapped, they entered in just seconds by blasting through the wall, said Trump.\n\n\"We were getting full reports on a minute-by-minute basis,\" he added.\n\nUS forces quickly cleared the compound \"with people either surrendering or being shot and killed,\" said Trump.\n\nEleven children were removed, uninjured, and taken into care by a third party whom the president declined to name.\n\nSoldiers captured and later imprisoned several Islamic State fighters.\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nBaghdadi fled into a subterranean area of the complex and into a tunnel, dragging three of his young children with him.\n\nEsper told CNN's Jake Tapper on Sunday that US forces called for Baghdadi to surrender but the world's most wanted man refused.\n\nChased by the dogs and confronted by a dead end, Baghdadi - \"whimpering and crying and screaming,\" according to Trump - ignited his suicide vest, killing himself and his children and causing the tunnel to collapse.\n\nNo military personnel were hurt although one dog was badly injured.\n\n(Image: Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)\n\n(Image: Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)\n\nWith Baghdadi's body \"mutilated by the blasts,\" US forces used a DNA test onsite to confirm his identity in around 15 minutes.\n\n\"The test results gave certain, immediate and totally positive identification. It was him,\" said Trump.\n\nMilitary, intelligence and counter-terrorism officials told the New York Times that raid was a success 'in spite' of Trump's actions in pulling US forces out of Syria.\n\nThe soldiers searched the compound, taking \"highly sensitive material\" including information on Islamic State's origins and its future plans.\n\nIn total, US forces were in the compound for around two hours before flying back out via the same route they flew in.\n\nBaghdadi's body will be \"disposed of properly,\" Robert O'Brien said, adding that he expected it to be the same protocol followed in 2011 for Osama bin Laden.\n\nThe al Qaeda leader was buried at sea after U.S. officials consulted with experts in Islamic law and ritual.", "description": "The United States were tipped off about the whereabouts of the ISIS leader roughly one month ago and started planning the operation", "authors": ["Tom Davidson", "Image", "Al-Furqan Media Afp Via Getty Im", "Reuters", "Instagram", "Afp Via Getty Images", "Anadolu Agency Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20734614.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_FILES-IRAQ-CONFLICT-BAGHDADI-IS.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
