The move comes as the administration is struggling to combat an intensifying investigation into President Donald Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine.\n\nEach of the districts on Pence's itinerary were won by Trump in 2016, making them potent targets for Republicans. The vice president will travel Wednesday to the southwest Iowa district of Rep. Cindy Axne, and Thursday he\u2019s slated to visit the suburban Twin Cities district of another freshman Democrat, Minnesota Rep. Angie Craig. The vice president is then scheduled to barnstorm an array of battleground districts, including those held by Michigan Rep. Elissa Slotkin and Virginia Rep. Abigail Spanberger.\n\nThe deployment comes as the White House has been flailing for a focused response to the escalating probe into whether Trump improperly pressured Ukraine to investigate Joe and Hunter Biden. The president veered wildly over the weekend, accusing Democrats of \u201cinterfering in the 2020 Election\u201d and calling Republican Sen. Mitt Romney a \u201cpompous \u2018ass\u2019\u201d who failed to understand that \u201cmy conversation with the Ukrainian President was a congenial and very appropriate one.\u201d\n\nBut Republicans are eager to get in sync, saying the impeachment push has given them a powerful argument to use against Democrats. At each stop, Pence is expected to paint Democrats as being more focused on destroying the president than on solving the problems of their constituents.\n\n\u201cWhile the \u2018Do Nothing Democrats\u2019 attempt to distract with their endless investigations, the vice president and this administration are laser focused on policies that put Americans first and make our country great,\" said Katie Waldman, a spokeswoman for Pence.\n\nDemocrats, Republicans point out, successfully prosecuted a similar case during the House GOP-led impeachment of Bill Clinton. Republicans suffered in that year\u2019s midterm election, losing five congressional seats.\n\nWhile national surveys show growing support for impeachment, Republicans contend it's far lower in the Democratic-held swing districts they\u2019re targeting. The National Republican Congressional Committee released a polling memo last week that argued that two-thirds of voters in those districts \u201cagree that Democrats in Congress are too obsessed with impeaching the president and should be working on\u201d other issues.\n\nRoughly two dozen of the 31 House Democrats who hail from districts Trump won in 2016 have expressed support for the impeachment inquiry.\n\nThe House GOP campaign arm has been running digital commercials in over a dozen districts and the pro-Trump outside group America First Priorities is expected to begin a seven-figure advertising offensive later this month targeting those Democrats. The Republican National Committee, meanwhile, is spending $2 million on ads and has used Slotkin\u2019s support for the inquiry to raise money for her eventual GOP opponent. The committee also has deployed field staffers to Democratic-held districts to organize protests during the two-week congressional recess.\n\nRNC officials briefed major donors at a New York City retreat this weekend on the impeachment-focused media blitz.\n\nPence himself has been under the microscope over the Ukraine matter. House Democrats have pressed Pence to clarify how much he knew about Trump\u2019s apparent effort to pressure Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky and has requested the vice president turn over documents related to the inquiry by Oct. 15.\n\n\u201cAt every stop Vice President Pence makes he\u2019ll have to answer for his own role in this growing scandal,\u201d said Cole Leiter, a Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spokesman, \u201cand any candidate who is still willing to appear publicly with Vice President Pence will have made it clear that they accept the Trump administration\u2019s wholesale eagerness to betray the office of the American president.\u201d", "description": "The White House wants to make vulnerable House Democrats pay for impeachment.
