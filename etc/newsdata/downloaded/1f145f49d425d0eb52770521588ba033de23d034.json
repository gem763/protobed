Here's how...", "language": "en", "text": "From Good Housekeeping\n\nWhen Killing Eve made its debut on the BBC in 2018, it quickly became the most talked about shows in offices and pubs alike. A cat-and-mouse thriller centred around heartless assassin Villanelle and MI5 agent Eve Polastri, both the first and second season, which came out in May this year, had us all hooked.\n\nBut before it was a buzzy BBC drama starring Doctor Foster\u2019s Jodie Comer and Grey\u2019s Anatomy\u2019s Sandra Oh, Killing Eve was actually a book by author Luke Jennings. Here\u2019s everything you need to know about the novels that inspired the Killing Eve series.\n\nWhat are the Villanelle novels?\n\nThe original Killing Eve books were written by Luke Jennings as a series of four self-published e-book novellas called Codename Villanelle, Villanelle: Hallowpoint, Villanelle: Shanghai and Odessa. They were published between 2014 and 2016, and were later compiled into one book which came out in 2018.\n\nIn March 2019, Jennings followed up with a sequel Killing Eve: No Tomorrow, and the third and final book in the series Killing Eve: Endgame is due to be published in March 2020.\n\nWho adapted the Villanelle novels into Killing Eve for TV?\n\nWhile the Villanelle novellas didn\u2019t become bestsellers at the time, television producer Sally Woodward Gentle spotted the potential for a TV show. She approached Fleabag\u2019s Phoebe Waller-Bridge to bring her on board as the writer. It was later commissioned by BBC America.\n\n\u201cSally actually put the novellas in front of me, which is how the conversation started,\" Waller-Bridge said at a Television Critics Association Press Tour in January 2018. \"I read the first novella and just fell in love with these characters, thought they were just wild. I hadn\u2019t seen them before and just was desperate to stand them up.\u201d\n\nWaller-Bridge adapted the first season for TV, then handed the baton on to Emerald Fennell. In April, it was announced season three of Killing Eve will be written and adapted by Suzanne Heathcote.\n\nHow different are the Villanelle to the Killing Eve show?\n\nThe creative team behind Killing Eve\u2019s TV show have described Jennings\u2019 novellas as an inspiration and start-off point, rather than something they follow closely.\n\nThat means there are quite a few differences between the show and the books. Here\u2019s how the Villanelle books are different:\n\nVillanelle has much more of a backstory\n\nWe learn some major things about the Villanelle in Jennings\u2019 books. We know her as Oxana from the first few pages and that her father was a wealthy war veteran who turned to crime later in life.\n\nAfter her mother died from cancer when Oxana was young, she became very close with her father, but he was killed by rival criminals. Vowing revenge, Oxana murders her father's killers \u2013 and that\u2019s what ends her in prison.\n\nHer merciless murders caught the attention of The Twelve, though, who rescue her from prison and give her a whole new persona. She\u2019s known as Villanelle from then on.\n\nPhoto credit: BBC America More\n\nEve Polastri isn\u2019t American\n\nWhile MI5 agent Eve Polastri is from the US in the show, in Jennings\u2019 novellas she\u2019s British.\n\nAs well as this, Sandra Oh who plays Eve said at the Television Critics Association panel: \u201cEve was, as I interpreted the novella, white. I am not white. I am Asian. And I will say that I was extremely pleased that that was taken into consideration in the casting.\u201d", "description": "We deep-dive into the books that inspired the hit BBC series", "authors": ["Anna Bonet"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/jJfugM.XFDrLA_16N8Qn2Q--~B/aD01MDA7dz0xMDAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/good_housekeeping_uk_129/efd104bf5830eec71baf1e650e130542", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
