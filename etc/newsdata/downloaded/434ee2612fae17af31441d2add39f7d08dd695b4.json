There was no immediate comment from Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) on the deal.\n\nBut if the agreement holds it means Turkey will not restart its military offensive, which many feared would resume as soon as an earlier ceasefire ended at 10pm on Tuesday.\n\n\"According to this agreement, Turkey and Russia will not allow any separatist agenda on Syrian territory,\" Mr Erdo\u011fan said.\n\nThe talks in Sochi underscore how quickly Russia has replaced the US as the main powerbroker in northeast Syria in the days since Donald Trump, the US president, pulled American forces out of the region.\n\nRussian forces will now stand guard in areas that only a few weeks were ago were being patrolled by US troops.\n\nThe evening agreement between Russia and Turkey capped a dramatic day as the world counted down the hours until the end of the ceasefire brokered last week by US vice president Mike Pence.\n\nThe US said earlier in the day that it believed that Kurdish forces had fulfilled their obligations to withdraw from a key 120km stretch of the border and warned Turkey that it would impose sanctions if the Turkish military resumed attacks.\n\nThe Russian-Turkish deal appears to expand on the earlier American agreement and ensure that Kurdish forces will leave the entire length of the border.\n\nTurkey will maintain control in areas it has already seized while Russian and Syrian regime forces will hold the rest of the border.\n\nThe agreement also states that the Kurds will withdraw from two holdout towns in western Syria, Kobani and Tel Rifaat, which Turkey has been trying to dislodge them from them for more than a year.\n\nSergey Shoygu, the Russian defence minister, said up to 500 Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isil) members had escaped from Kurdish-run prisons in northeast Syria amid the chaos of the Turkish offensive.\n\nUS troops are withdrawing from northeast Syria Credit: DELIL SOULEIMAN/AFP via Getty Images More\n\nMeanwhile, confusion over the US plan to withdraw forces from Syria deepened on Tuesday after Iraq\u2019s government said the retreating troops did not have permission to stay in Iraq.\n\n\u201cThere is no permission granted for these forces to stay inside Iraq,\u201d the Iraqi military said.\n\nThe comment appeared to contradict claims by the Pentagon that the roughly 1,000 soldiers would stay in Iraq to continue fighting Isil. Mark Esper, the US defence secretary, said he would try to smooth the issue during a visit to Iraq and added that the additional American forces did not plan \u201cto stay in Iraq interminably\u201d.\n\nThere was a bleak reminder of the threat from Isil inside Iraq when it emerged Tuesday that a senior Iraqi police commander had been killed in an ambush by jihadist fighters.\n\nBashar al-Assad visited his forces in Idlib for the first time in years More", "description": "Turkey and Russia announced last night they had reached a deal to avoid a return to fullscale fighting in northeast Syria, just hours before a US-brokered ceasefire between Turkish and Kurdish forces was due to expire.\u00a0 Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan and Vladimir Putin emerged from marathon talks in Sochi with", "authors": ["Raf Sanchez"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/XmfAfcZaqd_FmpvViayFUQ--~B/aD0xNTYzO3c9MjUwMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_258/2eb15fbbc7e35ea27cb2e33bc7b09237", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
