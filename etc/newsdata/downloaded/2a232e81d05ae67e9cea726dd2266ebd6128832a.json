Now, if you already pay $12.99 a month (or $119 a year) for Prime, you\u2019ll also be able to get Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods Market grocery deliveries free of charge. Existing Fresh subscribers can benefit from the new pricing immediately, while new customers will have to register their interest and wait for an invite.\n\nVox notes that your order will need to be of a certain size before Amazon will allow it to be delivered for free. In most places the minimum order amount is $35, but in New York City it rises to $50. Amazon Fresh is currently available in over 2,000 cities across the US.\n\nAmazon Fresh is just one of the services now included for free with Prime\n\nThe price change is Amazon\u2019s latest move as it competes with traditional grocery stores like Walmart and Target. Back in June, Walmart announced an unlimited grocery delivery service called Delivery Unlimited, which costs $98 a year or $12.95 a month with no additional delivery fees, while Target offers free deliveries for orders over $35 to customers subscribed to its $99 a year Shipt service.\n\nAmazon Prime may be around $20 more expensive than both competing services, but it bundles together a large range of different services, including Prime Video, Prime Music, and Twitch Prime. Now, some of you can add free grocery deliveries to that list.", "description": "Amazon will no longer charge a $14.99 monthly fee for Amazon Fresh on top of your Prime subscription.
