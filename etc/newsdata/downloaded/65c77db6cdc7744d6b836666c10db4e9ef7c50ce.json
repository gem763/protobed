A bill to do so was authored by Vermont Sen. Sanders is supported by Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren.\n\nAn estimate from the Mercatus Center at George Mason University has pegged the cost of Sanders\u2019 bill at about $32 trillion.\n\nClimate change continued\n\nCalifornia Sen. Kamala Harris released her own climate change plan, which would cost an estimated $10 trillion.\n\nFormer Texas lawmaker Beto O\u2019Rourke released a $5 trillion plan in May.\n\nNew Jersey Sen. Cory Booker unveiled a $3 trillion plan.\n\nStudent loan debt forgiveness (Sanders)\n\nSanders\u2019 $1.6 trillion student loan forgiveness program, which also calls for making U.S. public colleges tuition-free at an estimated total cost of $2.2 trillion, would be financed through a tax on Wall Street transactions, according to the Vermont senator.\n\nFree college and student debt forgiveness (Warren)\n\nWarren\u2019s proposal for canceling student debt for some, and providing a universal free college program, carries an estimated price tag of $1.25 trillion during the course of a decade. She has said her ultra-millionaire tax could help fund the proposal.\n\nExpanding Social Security\n\nWarren also unveiled a plan to expand Social Security benefits, immediately giving all beneficiaries an extra $200 per month.\n\nEstimates peg the cost of the proposal, which includes other measures to shore up the solvency of the program, at $1.1 trillion over a decade. It would also involve a $4.2 trillion tax hike over the same time period.\n\nInfrastructure plan\n\nMinnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar detailed a $1 trillion plan to reform the nation\u2019s infrastructure, in her first policy announcement after announcing her campaign for president.\n\nThe proposal calls for the use of federal money, tax subsidies and loans.\n\nPresident Trump and Democrats came together around a $2 trillion infrastructure overhaul goal, though no progress has been made.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Trump passed a $1.5 trillion tax cut, which he signed into law at the end of 2017.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nMany of the proposals rely on raising taxes on the country\u2019s wealthiest residents and corporations for funding. However, as previously reported by FOX Business, the rich do not earn enough to fund progressive promises.\n\nCurrently, federal spending figures for 2020 through 2029 sit at $57 trillion, or 22.5 percent of GDP. Taking into account progressive promises, federal spending could rise to between $105 trillion to $149 trillion during the same time period \u2013 to as much as nearly 59 percent of GDP.\n\nTaking every dollar earned by people with incomes above $200,000 would not be enough to pay for the proposals that have been floated, the report found. A flat tax rate of 100 percent on those with incomes of $1 million or more would not even raise enough to eliminate the current federal deficit.", "description": "From climate change to free college, a look at what candidates are planning to spend on.", "authors": ["Brittany De Lea"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/06/0/0/debate-feat-Getty.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
