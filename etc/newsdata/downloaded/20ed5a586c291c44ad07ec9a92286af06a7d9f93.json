Anyone that says he\u2019s been asking for \u00a3600,000-a-week is wrong and it\u2019s a surprise to us when someone in the game like Karren Brady [West Ham vice-chairman] refers to it.\u2019\n\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer\u2019s side take on Newcastle on Sunday. It is unclear whether Pogba will be fit enough to start for the Red Devils.\n\nMORE: Sean Longstaff told to ignore dream Manchester United transfer\n\nMORE: Paul Merson warns Arsenal, Man Utd, Spurs and Chelsea over Leicester\u2019s top-four chances", "description": "Manchester United have been angered by claims that Paul Pogba is asking for a \u00a3600,000-a-week contract to stay at Old Trafford and have insisted the midfielder has not made any...", "authors": ["Metro Sport Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1178207676_1570351453.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
