But the 29-year-old Mexican insists that the hunger still burns inside him, and that he is intent on proving everyone wrong for a second time.\n\nSportswashing: how Saudi Arabia lobbies the US's largest sports bodies Read more\n\n\u201cI know Anthony Joshua is coming hard, and I know he is going to be preparing really good,\u201d Ruiz said in a press conference in Diriyah, on the outskirts of the Saudi capital Riyadh.\n\n\u201cBut so am I. I\u2019m really hungry. A lot of people saying that I\u2019m not training, that I\u2019m not taking it serious. Come on, I got all these belts. There\u2019s a lot of responsibilities to this. And I\u2019m going to win here in the same fashion as I did on 1 June. And I\u2019m going to prove everybody wrong.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to just have 15 minutes of fame. I want it to last. I want to be a champion for more years. He\u2019s going try to try to take these belts but we\u2019re going to be training really hard for 7 December.\u201d\n\nVasiliy Lomachenko the three-weight genius wows London with his boxing arts | Sean Ingle Read more\n\nRuiz admitted he was likely to face a tougher test in the rematch in Saudi Arabia, which has been criticised by groups such as Amnesty International because of the country\u2019s appalling human rights record. But the Mexican also pointed out he would be much better prepared too given he only had five weeks\u2019 notice for the first fight.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s more hungry,\u201d Ruiz said. \u201cHe wants his belts back. I want to train even harder, you know, because he\u2019s training even harder too. I only had a month and a half to train for the first fight. This time we have a whole camp so it benefits me as well. It\u2019s going to be an explosive fight, two big heavyweights punching each other in the face. It\u2019s going to be exciting.\u201d\n\nJoshua, meanwhile, promised that Ruiz\u2019s reign would be a short one. \u201cI\u2019m really looking forward to the challenge,\u201d he said. \u201cAndy is the champion right now, but that will last until 7 December until he has to put his titles in the air. Two warriors will go to war, and the best man will walk out victorious.", "description": "Andy Ruiz Jr is confident he will repeat his shock June victory over Anthony Joshua when the two meet again in Riyadh in December", "authors": ["Sean Ingle"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b275512df4461b1aba80a9fdb9e27365244dc87/0_108_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=657534d6881fb1d61f8c8422fcf51fd0"}
