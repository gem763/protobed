(AP) - The California Golden Bears have faith in quarterback Devon Modster, not just out of necessity with Chase Garbers out, but because they\u2019ve seen firsthand what he can do.\n\nModster was UCLA\u2019s quarterback two seasons back when the Golden Bears visited Pasadena and fell 30-27 to the Bruins. Modster passed for 191 yards after replacing Josh Rosen at halftime, and he moved the Bruins into scoring position before J.J. Molson\u2019s game-winning field goal.\n\nModster will take over as Cal\u2019s starter Saturday when the Golden Bears (4-1, 1-1 Pac-12) visit No. 13 Oregon (3-1, 1-0)\n\n\u201cAnyone who has been here long enough remembers two years ago and we were down at UCLA, Josh Rosen went down and Devon came in and pretty much torched us up,\u201d right tackle Jake Curhan said. \u201cWe all know he\u2019s plenty capable. We don\u2019t feel like there\u2019s too much we all have to do to get him there because he\u2019s been there and he\u2019s done it. There\u2019s plenty of confidence in what he\u2019ll be able to do.\u201d\n\nModster, who had to sit out of Cal\u2019s first three games after committing to the Golden Bears in December, was pressed into service when Garbers was injured during last weekend\u2019s 24-17 loss at home to Arizona State. Garbers is out indefinitely.\n\nModster was 5 of 14 for 23 yards and an interception in the end zone against the Sun Devils.\n\n\u201cHonest, I think I played terrible,\u201d he said. \u201cI could have played a lot better, just missing a lot of receivers.\u201d\n\nThe Ducks had last weekend off after a 21-6 victory on the road against Stanford in their Pac-12 opener. Oregon, which lost the first game of the season to Auburn, hasn\u2019t given up a touchdown in three straight games for the first time since 1933. At the same time, Ducks quarterback Justin Herbert has thrown 13 touchdown passes over the last three games.\n\nCoach Mario Cristobal was eying Cal\u2019s defense earlier in the week. The secondary, which has been dubbed \u201cThe Takers,\u201d has amassed 26 career interceptions. The Golden Bears have allowed just two passing touchdowns this season.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s linebacker Evan Weaver, who leads the nation with 78 tackles. He\u2019s had 12 straight games with 10 or more tackles, the longest streak in the country.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re hard-nosed, they\u2019re tough, they\u2019re disciplined. They\u2019re also very talented,\u201d Cristobal said. \u201cI think that gets lost a little bit; people just say, well, they\u2019re tough - they\u2019re really, really talented and they\u2019re coached really well.\n\nOther items of note when the Ducks host Cal on Saturday:\n\nHERBERT WATCH: Herbert\u2019s draft stock continues to rise with each game, and his stats are certainly impressive. He\u2019s one of just four quarterbacks nationally with two five-touchdown games this season. He\u2019s thrown a touchdown pass in 32 straight games, the longest streak in the nation. He\u2019s had 174 consecutive passes without an interception, also longest in the nation. This season he has 14 total touchdown passes to rank seventh nationally.\n\nBOUNCING BACK: Modster wasn\u2019t the only Cal player upset about the loss to the Sun Devils. Cal was undefeated heading into the game and ranked No. 15 - the team\u2019s highest spot in the AP Top 25 since 2009. Weaver was particularly vocal after the game, suggesting that if his teammates weren\u2019t willing to put in the work, he didn\u2019t want them there.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re upset with how we showed out for that last game. Weaver\u2019s not the only one that\u2019s been upset,\u201d nose tackle Luc Bequette said. \u201cEvery single one of us has been outspoken amongst ourselves. We\u2019re all ready to attack this week and try to get back on track.\u201d\n\nDEPTH HIT: Oregon third-string quarterback Cale Millen will miss the rest of the season after shoulder surgery on his throwing arm. That leaves the Ducks with Herbert, backup Tyler Shough and walk-on Bradley Yaffe at QB.\n\nOFFICIALLY A DUCK: Oregon officially announced this week that receiver Devon Williams had transferred into the program, thus ending a strange saga that involved Oregon State.\n\nThe former four-star recruit played for USC last season and appeared in a game for the Trojans this year before entering the transfer portal. The Beavers announced last week that he had enrolled there. But last Friday Williams announced he had changed his mind and was headed for Eugene.\n\nWilliams was at practice with the Ducks this week, making it official. However, he won\u2019t be able to play for Oregon until next season under NCAA rules.\n\n___\n\nAP freelancer Michael Wagaman in Berkeley, California, contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The California Golden Bears have faith in quarterback Devon Modster, not just out of necessity with Chase Garbers out, but because they've seen firsthand what he can do.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Anne M.
