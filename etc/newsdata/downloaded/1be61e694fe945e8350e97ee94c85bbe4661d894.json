Moreno has cast the dispute as a battle between Venezuela and other left-leaning forces and more market-friendly ideologies.\n\nNearly 60 roads in the city were closed, the municipal government said, without elaborating.\n\n\"Blocking roads is punishable by law and even more so during a curfew,\" said councilman Bernardo Abad.\n\nRiot police engage with protesters in Quito. (Henry Romero/Reuters)\n\nIndigenous protesters vowed to continue protests across the country until Moreno reinstates fuel subsidies, a sign that a potential breakthrough in the dispute announced on Saturday might fade under the government crackdown.\n\nThe first round of talks between indigenous leaders and the government was set to begin at 3 p.m. local time in Quito, although no announcement had been made yet on who would take part or where exactly it would be held.\n\nMoreno signed a $5.5 billion Cdn deal with the IMF earlier this year, angering many of his former supporters who voted for him as the left-leaning successor of his former ally, Rafael Correa.\n\nMoreno has defended his decision last week to slash fuel subsidies as a key part of his bid to clean up the country's finances, and denies it was required by the IMF.\n\n'Murderers'\n\nAmid widespread defiance of the curfew by ordinary citizens, the military said it had partially lifted the emergency measure in the city until 8 p.m. local time on Sunday, but stressed it would remain in place in northern parts of the city near points of unrest.\n\nThe militarization of the city has fuelled criticism that the government's handling of the protests has been too heavy-handed, with human rights groups urging security forces to use restraint.\n\nAt least seven people have been killed, several hundred wounded and more than 1,000 people arrested in the unrest since it began on Oct. 3, according to the ombudsman's office, which monitors conflicts.\n\nRiot police line up as demonstrators take part in a protest against Ecuador President Lenin Moreno's austerity measures in Quito. (Ivan Alvarado/Reuters)\n\n\"Murderers!\" one woman shouted from her window in the northern district of Mariscal as helicopters droned overhead and sounds resembling shots and explosions were heard.\n\nNearly all outgoing flights from the city were cancelled on Saturday and Sunday. The airport said it was feeding stranded travelers snacks and beverages as surrounding areas were restricted.\n\n\"We made our reservations and two days after we had everything booked, this problem exploded,\" said Rodrigo Gomez, a Chilean tourist who ventured out of his hotel for food despite the crackdown. Gomez said he and his family had hoped to see the highland city's famed lookout point \"el Panecillo,\" considered a pre-Colombian sun temple.\n\nMoreno has blamed the unrest on \"dark forces\" linked to Correa, now a fierce critic of the government who has been churning out videos showing police attacking people.\n\nEcuador President Lenin Moreno addresses the Climate Action Summit in the United Nations General Assembly on Sept. 23. (Jason DeCrow/The Associated Press)\n\nAs evidence, Moreno's government has pointed to repeated attacks on the comptroller's office, where documents related to an investigation into the misuse of funds under Correa are stored.\n\nCorrea denies the charges and has called Moreno a sellout for turning to the right after being elected on a leftist platform.\n\nBut Conaie, an umbrella group for indigenous peoples across Ecuador and the chief organizer of anti-austerity protests, has slammed Correa as an \"shameless opportunist.\"\n\n\"Correa's movement criminalized and killed our people for 10 years,\" Conaie said on Twitter. \"Today he wants to take advantage of our platform for struggle.\"", "description": "Ecuadoreans posted videos on social media of burning road blockades and standoffs between crowds and security forces in downtown Quito ahead of the first round of talks aimed at ending 11 days of unrest.", "authors": ["Thomson Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5320180.1571006145!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/ecuador-political-crisis.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
