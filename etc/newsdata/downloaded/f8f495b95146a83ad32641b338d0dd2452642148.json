We are now dealing with it with our lawyers.'\n\nLizzie has now told MailOnline: 'I was surprised to hear Danny wants to sue my publishers for saying he was good in bed. I was very complimentary and kind in my book about Danny. We had great chemistry.\n\nDetails: The ex WAG rated her saucy romp with the rugby star as 'nine out of ten on the naughty scale' and also claimed that he gave her 'the greatest kiss of all time'\n\nResponse: Danny's lawyers have stated that he did not give his consent for the material to be published and is now demanding up to \u00a350,000 worth of damages from Lizzie's publishers\n\n'I helped him tremendously and he got me through a tough divorce. It\u2019s in the hands of lawyers now who have all the proof but as Danny was such a big part of my life at one time I couldn\u2019t not mention him in my book.\n\n'I only told half of the story as we were together on and off for four years. I only have nice things to say about him and always will.\n\nMailOnline has contacted representatives for Danny Cipriani for further comment.\n\nIn her book, which was released in June, Lizzie claimed she had secret sex with rugby player Danny while his mum was in the house, and had to sneak out when she called him for dinner.\n\nThe television personality said she hooked up with the athlete, who has also dated Kelly Brook and Caroline Flack, after her split from former Chelsea and Spurs footballer Jason Cundy in 2010.\n\nShe said: 'He sent me his address, though bizarrely telling me at the same time to \"Gently tap on the door\" when I arrived and \"be a bit quiet\" when I pulled up outside. I soon found out why. He still lived with his mum.\n\n'Breaching right to privacy': In paperwork filed at the High Court in London, Danny's lawyer's Clintons have now filed for a gagging order against Lizzie's publishers, Soho Friday Media\n\n'Now I saw this right away as endearing and if truth be told what did I really expect? He was still just in his early 20s after all. I was double his age. I was in my forties, but it didn't matter at all to me. Nothing did, ever, when it related to him.\n\nLizzie said Danny was there to quietly open the door of the house just as she approached it, so that he could sneak her to his room under his mum's nose.\n\nTalking about their romp further, Lizzie continued: ' Twenty minutes or so into our naughty nine rated extravaganza, Danny whispered suddenly \"Be quiet\", it had to be said, rather loudly, and I thought he was talking to himself for a moment as I rarely made any \"noise\" in bed.\n\n'Naughty scale': The brunette, who recently split from nightclub boss Jeremy Gordeno, detailed her alleged romps with Danny in her book\n\n'But then I suddenly realised he was talking to me and the \"noises\" were indeed mine. Blimey, that's a turn up for the old books I said to myself as I carried on being noisy, and sodded the shameful consequences of a noisy discovery by Mummy C.'\n\nElsewhere in her book, Lizzie claims Danny also smuggled her into the England rugby team hotel at Pennyhill Park so that they could have sex and she 'hid behind a plant pot' so that the rest of the squad did not see her leaving the next morning.\n\nThe television personality said it was 'dangerously exciting' as the pair would 'regularly meet up at hotels or at his mum's house with his mum still not knowing'.\n\nLizzie has recently split from Jeremy Gordeno amid claims he developed a close friendship with his ex fianc\u00e9e's 21-year-old daughter.", "description": "Danny Cipriani, 31, is suing Lizzie Cundy ,51, for detailing their alleged sex life in her new memoir, Tales From The Red Carpet.", "authors": ["Jabeen Waheed For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/09/19915358-0-image-a-39_1571474766652.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
