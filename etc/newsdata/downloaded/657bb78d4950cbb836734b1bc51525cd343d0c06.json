Cate Blanchett admitted during a chat with Harper's Bazaar that she isn't interested in playing a version of herself on-screen, in favour of delving into other people's perspectives\n\nCate stunned in the dress which was covered in pearl beading across the semi-sheer top half of the stunning garment, before flowing out into the striped, pleated skirt.\n\nShe teamed her dress with a pair of chic court shoes, and kept the attention on her clothing by forgoing any additional accessories.\n\nThe Armani Beauty ambassador sported a perfectly applied coat of make-up, including a flawless coat of foundation and a subtle smokey-eye look.\n\nShe styled her platinum tresses in an elegant up do, leaving some curled strands to frame her striking features as she posed for a selection of glamorous shots.\n\nWhat a beauty! Alongside the interview the Blue Jasmine star, 50, posed for an array of sensational snaps in eye-catching beaded gowns\n\nCate admitted that she wouldn't like to play a character close to her own personality, she said: \u2018I\u2019m never interested in portraying myself. For me, selfishly, it\u2019s always about trying to understand someone else\u2019s perspective.'\n\n'Often the further from my own experience and my set of values, the more fascinating it is. And the only way we can move forward is to learn from history.\u2019\n\nCate, who has also been a powerful advocate for the rights of women through her commitment to the #MeToo and Time\u2019s Up movements suggested that the feminist movement isn't making enough progress.\n\nShe said: 'We\u2019re still talking about same-sex restrooms, we\u2019re still talking about women in the military, we\u2019re still talking about reproductive freedom. And how many years ago was that? It really has been Groundhog Day.\u2019\n\nAs well as fighting for women's right, Cate is also heavily involved as as a Goodwill Ambassador for UNHCR, highlighting the plight of refugees.\n\nShe said: \u2018When I came onboard, there were about 61 million displaced people around the world, and now there are over 70 million...\n\n'And that\u2019s in just a handful of years. The size and scale of the crisis is so overwhelming that it\u2019s difficult to relate to.\u2019\n\nRead the full interview in the December issue of Harper\u2019s Bazaar, on sale from 30 October", "description": "Cate Blanchett admitted during a chat with Harper's Bazaar that she isn't interested in playing a version of herself on-screen, in favour of delving into other people's perspectives.", "authors": ["Charlotte Dean For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/00/20305760-0-image-a-1125_1572308821123.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
