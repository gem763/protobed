But the virus is very smart and it can mutate its way around it. What we do is make the host inhospitable for these viruses. So it's much more difficult for these viruses to mutate around.\"\n\nABC News\n\nThink of it like a lock and key, Ashton said.\n\n\"If the lock is actually the cell that gets infected, and the key is the virus, instead of disabling this, they disabled the protein on the cell that is found to be nonessential so that virus cannot infect those cells.\"\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\nWhile this testing is not yet a cure, scientists would have to develop a drug that blocks that protein in cells. At that point any drug would need to be tested further.\n\nIn the meantime, Dr. Ashton suggested washing hands regularly and sneezing into your arm.", "description": "Scientists at Stanford and UCSF made a discovery that could help lead to a cure for the common cold.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/GTY_flu_kab_150105_hpMain_2_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
