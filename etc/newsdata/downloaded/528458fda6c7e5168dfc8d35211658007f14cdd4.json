To mark the occasion, Intelligencer is publishing \u201cState of the World,\u201d a series of in-depth interviews with climate leaders from Bill Gates to Naomi Klein and Rhiana Gunn-Wright to William Nordhaus interrogating just how they see the precarious climate future of the planet \u2014 and just how hopeful they think we should all be about avoiding catastrophic warming. (Unfortunately, very few are hopeful.)\n\nJames Lovelock turned 100 this year and celebrated by publishing a new book \u2014 on artificial intelligence. But he is known as much more of an old-fashioned scientist and compares himself to Darwin and Faraday in that he also likes to work alone, outside of institutions. Nevertheless, though you may not know his name, he is among the most influential scientists of the 20th century, having developed \u2014 and then, over the course of decades of writing, refined and refashioned \u2014 what is called the \u201cGaia theory,\u201d or the principle that Earth\u2019s ecosystem is a single, living, self-regulating entity. In early September, just a few months after his birthday, I met Lovelock one morning at his home on Chesil Beach in southern England, where we talked about nuclear power, his hope that AI might save the planet from catastrophic warming, and just how to integrate the disruptions and disturbances of climate change into a Gaia worldview.\n\nAt 100 years old, you\u2019ve been alive for something like 90 percent or more of all the carbon emissions that have ever been produced from the burning of fossil fuels.\n\nExactly. Well, I hope you don\u2019t blame me for that.\n\nBut the world really has changed an enormous amount in your lifetime.\n\nYes. I grew up from 6 till about 14 years old in an area of London which was probably more polluted than anywhere in the world. Particularly vile air. It was so thick that not only could you not see a hand in front of your face, but people were dying on railroad platforms because they couldn\u2019t see where the platform ended. That\u2019s coal for you.\n\nOn climate, your views have changed over time, I know. You were for a period more alarmed, and then you grew a little bit less alarmed. How do you see the big picture at the moment? Where do you think we are, and where do you think we\u2019re heading?\n\nThe big picture is that everything is continuing more or less as predicted by climate scientists. But the exact course, of course, depends on all sorts of things.\n\nBut taking seriously the main proposition of Gaia theory, if the whole Earth system is a kind of living, self-regulating entity of which human activity is also a natural part and one we shouldn\u2019t be trying to exclude, what is concerning about climate change? Why shouldn\u2019t we just accept that as being part of the same system?\n\nUp to a point, we have to, and we do, wrongly. I mean, if you\u2019re an ordinary man with a family, you\u2019ve got to have an income. You\u2019ve got to work for somebody on something and that determines what you do, rather than any environmental concern.\n\nBut thinking more globally, people like you and me, who think about these things in somewhat bigger terms \u2014 how concerned should we be?\n\nWell, at first you get into a panic. At least I did. And then eventually you realize that there\u2019s not a lot you can do about it. I mean, did you ever read that book by Martin Rees, Our Final Hour? Well, that was written quite a while back and I think he\u2019s right.\n\nThe warm-up of the sun is quite remorseless, and it will continue. Unless we do something like [physicist Edward] Teller\u2019s idea of putting up sunshades in the heliocentric orbit, we\u2019ve had it. That\u2019s it. There isn\u2019t any way you could survive if the sun continues to warm up.\n\nBut nobody can predict the climate in two or three years\u2019 time. It could be almost anything. For example, there was news of a very large volcano eruption emerging in the middle of the Pacific, from below. Well, of course, if that develops and magma starts coming up, that could change the whole picture. I\u2019m hoping it won\u2019t happen and probably it won\u2019t.\n\nWhen you allow yourself to be optimistic, how do you see the next few decades unfolding?\n\nWell, I won\u2019t be here for one, so I won\u2019t see them. But I think we will have to curb our tendency to burn fossil fuels. And I think the big companies are beginning to realize themselves that you can\u2019t make money that way. What replaces it, I hope, is nuclear, but probably they\u2019ll mess about with renewables for awhile until they find their way to nuclear.\n\nWhy do you think it has been so difficult to get nuclear power going again?\n\nBecause there\u2019s propaganda. I think the coal and oil business fight like mad to tell bad stories about nuclear.\n\nWhy is that? Because historically they haven\u2019t seen renewables as the same scale of threat?\n\nYeah. I mean, when you look at the death rates in the nuclear industry, it\u2019s almost ludicrously low. In this country, I think, it doesn\u2019t exist at all. Nobody\u2019s been hurt.\n\nAnd even if you look at the worst disasters, they\u2019re nothing compared with the damage that\u2019s done by burning coal.\n\nThat\u2019s right. It\u2019s a fake business. And it\u2019s amazing that people have been persuaded by it. I wish you journalists would write out what happened, because just after World War II, there was a lot of interest in using nuclear power and the politicians are all for it. In fact, one of them said, it\u2019ll be so cheap, it will be impossible to meter it. Which is \u2014 would that it were true! But the people with loads of money in the oil industry made sure that never happened. And of course the greens played along with it. There\u2019s bound to have been some corruption there \u2014 I\u2019m sure that various green movements were paid some sums on the side to help with propaganda.\n\nJust the word nuclear conjures such fears now. It\u2019s almost as though, if it had just been called a different thing, the public would have been much more receptive to it. And if we don\u2019t move into nuclear more aggressively, do you think there\u2019s any hope that we avoid, say, two degrees of warming? Or is that basically inevitable?\n\nI wish I knew. People have to ask the questions of the financial people \u2014 there\u2019s the real driver. The reason we\u2019re continuing to burn fossil fuels is that all the money\u2019s invested in it, right? I find it almost hilarious.\n\nIt seems to me that the public is slowly waking up to this story. Especially over the past couple of years, there has been a kind of a change.\n\nWell, I hope you\u2019re right. I look at those affairs like the Paris conference more as parties. So, great, get together, you\u2019ll have a great time. But the conferences are not serious.\n\nAnd no country in the world is honoring the pledges it made during the Paris accords. But in your new book, you put a lot of faith in the possibility that superintelligence will arrive and, among other things, address this problem \u2014 and maybe save us from ourselves.\n\nThe reason I speculated along those lines was that Darwin has been an amazingly right during his lifetime. And it is a natural follow-on from Darwinism that we don\u2019t just stay still as humans. There\u2019s this extraordinary belief amongst most people, that future humans are going to be just like us. We\u2019re beginning to see things like AI developments yielding the possibility of existing as the independent life forms, in which case you\u2019ve got a new kingdom of life. That\u2019s the way I see it.\n\nI owe this to my colleague Lynn Margulies. She likes to divide life up into the kingdoms \u2014 vegetable, animal \u2014 it\u2019s almost childish, but I think it\u2019s absolutely solid. The AI stuff represents a new kingdom. They\u2019re about 10,000 times faster than we are, so it would look on us much in the way that we look on plants, which are 10,000 times slower than us. It\u2019s just another kingdom. But we\u2019re all needed \u2014 we\u2019re all part of the same system, or that\u2019s how I think. Which is how you get Gaia.\n\nBut if you think about our relationship to plant life as having not exhibited what you could call a perfectly responsible relationship to the natural world, why should we expect better from a superintelligence?\n\nBecause they need us.\n\nBut we need plant life, right?\n\nWe do need plant life. We can\u2019t go to war with it.\n\nSo why should we expect it to be more responsible toward humans and the natural world than humans were to the plant world? As you say, we\u2019re much more impressive cognitively than other animals, and certainly more than plant life, yet in many ways we\u2019ve managed the planet much less well than those kingdoms did.\n\nIt\u2019s a good point.\n\nSo why do you think AI would be a better steward of the planet than humans?\n\nI have a feeling that stewardship doesn\u2019t come into it. It\u2019s just what they will have to do to survive. It\u2019s nice to think that stewardship is important, but I rather suspect we talk about it but we don\u2019t practice it.\n\nWhat\u2019s a better model for how we should relate to the natural world?\n\nAccept it.\n\nAnd you think AI would take that view?\n\nThe reason they would limit warming is quite simple: the properties of water. That\u2019s the deadly thing, which you\u2019ve written about in your book. The ocean, at the moment, an awful lot of it is approaching 15 Celsius. Now that, what could be harmful about that? Everything. If you go anywhere in the world where the temperature is, the water is 15 and looked down, it\u2019s beautifully clear and you can see down to 100 fathoms down, because there\u2019s no life in that water. It\u2019s a complete desert. And the reason for that is that the nutrient-rich lower waters can\u2019t get to the top.\n\nYou\u2019ve always written about the human role as being part of the greater Gaia ecosystem. But the theory of Gaia as I\u2019ve seen it picked up by environmentalists often sets human activity against the rhythms of the natural world \u2014 as though we are outside the natural world, in fact its enemies.\n\nThat\u2019s absolutely right. They\u2019ve gotten it dead wrong.\n\nWhy do you think that is? Why do you think they\u2019ve been so blind to the sort of basic formulation you put forward?\n\nI think it\u2019s a series of reasons. I think it\u2019s high time that science was treated in much the same way as the church was treated in the Middle Ages. You need a dissolution of the universities, because it\u2019s quite ridiculous \u2014 taking students and teaching them a single subject, with no idea what\u2019s going on in the rest of science. But that\u2019s what goes on. And you kind of cannot possibly understand a complex system like Gaia unless you\u2019re looking at not just one, but the great bulk of the sciences, together. And that may seem a dreadful task, but it isn\u2019t really because you don\u2019t have to understand the whole of all of the sciences \u2014 there\u2019s a sort of crossover. You can in your mind cross over between the various parts and understand much more than you might think was possible.\n\nBut let me tell you just the story of how it all started. I was invited to go to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, to NASA, only three years after NASA had formed. Soon after I was there, I was deposited for a bit in a meeting with a great group of biologists. Quite a few of them had Nobel Prizes in various things. They\u2019d been picked up by NASA to design a life-detection experiment. I was asked what I thought of that, and it was appalling. Most of them went out into the Mojave Desert and said, \u201cMars is just like this, so if we can grow something here, we can do it there.\u201d Which was just crazy. What little we knew about Mars even then suggested it was totally different. It was a daft assumption. They got very cross with me \u2019cause I kept on saying, \u201cYou know, you\u2019re wasting your time on that.\u201d And I got called to see one of the head what you might call rocket scientists. He said, \u201cWhy are you upsetting all these biologists? You go on like this and he\u2019ll be out of a job.\u201d But then he added, \u201cWell, what would you do to detect lives?\u201d And I\u2019d just read that little book by Schr\u00f6dinger called What Is Life? I said, \u201cIf you read that, that offers a good standard.\u201d \u201cOh my God,\u201d they said, \u201cgive me a practical example that we can put on a rocket.\u201d\n\nI said, \u201cI\u2019ll have to think about it, you can\u2019t ask me a question like that across the table.\u201d They said, \u201cWell, you\u2019ve got till Friday.\u201d I was pretty worried! Thursday night I could see my job going down the tubes. But then suddenly it came to me. God, dead easy. All I have to do is measure the composition of Mars\u2019s atmosphere. If it\u2019s made of gases that react with each other chemically and produce heat or products or whatnot, then that fulfills the definition of life, according to Schr\u00f6dinger \u2014 entropy. And you could do the same thing for the surface: If the surface reacts with the atmosphere or the ocean and you get heat produced, then the planet\u2019s alive, because that can never happen by chance. And he said, \u201cAh, now you\u2019re talking.\u201d And that became Viking.\n\nAnd then you just applied the same perspective to Earth. It may be that I\u2019m too worried about climate change, but I have a hard time adopting the same point of view.\n\nI think we can extend the lifespan of the current system using nuclear power. But we are near the edge, in terms of keeping the thing going.
