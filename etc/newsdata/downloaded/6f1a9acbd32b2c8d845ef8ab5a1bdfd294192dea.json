I'm at war with my past and the scars that they still leave on me everyday. I will continue to fight against biases and advocate for those facing this same issue. I'll do what do what I plan to make it up to y'all.\"\n\nDon Q, whose real name is Lequincy Anderson, said misinformation is the reason he's not allowed to perform.\n\n\"THIS IS MY HOMETOWN. I just found out I can't perform at @RollingLoud tomorrow in my home city due to misinformation, I love my city and i never been in any gang activities or never had issues at any of my previous shows,\" he posted on Instagram. \"I hope the city will wake up and see that cancelling me and my fellow NY artists isn't the solution, we just love what we do and want to perform for our fans.
