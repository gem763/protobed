The actress was candid about the end of her relationship with her ex-beau Micheal Corsale.\n\nShe went on to add she is on the lookout for \"that one great love.\" Shruti, however, confessed that her relationship with Corsale was a \"very good experience \"for her.\n\nShruti and Michael were dating for a number of years. They went public about their relationship on Instagram in 2016. The relationship was pretty hectic as the two were working thousands of miles apart. They perforce had to shuttle between Los Angeles, Mumbai, and Chennai to be in each other's company.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the latest news! Click on the topic you interest most. We'll keep you updated with all the news you shouldn't miss. Film\n\nFilmbeat.com has reported that Micheal has confirmed the breakup.

Despite his stature, he remained second fiddle to Rajinikanth, whose film \"Petta\" proved his position. Shruthi will have time to reflect on her relationship and breakup with Michael Corsale. Shruthi, who had deleted all her photos with Micheal on social media, feels she is free and can get back to her passion for singing and acting.", "description": "The daughter of famed actor Kamala Haasan was in a relationship with the British actor for years has now announced that she has broken up with him.", "authors": ["Read More On The Same Topic Mg Singh", "Shooting Down Own Chopper In Srinagar Was A 'Big Mistake'", "Say'S Iaf Chief", "Paris Police Headquarters Is Scene Of A Knife Attack", "Four Are Killed", "Bihar Dropout Techie Planned An Unclad Party In Goa Arrested For 'Hoax Event'"], "top_image": "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/photogallery/2019/10/10/os/b_1200x630/shruti-haasan-who-recently-broke-up-with-boyfriend-photo-image-credit-bollywoodnewsyoutube_2336843.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
