If the White House does not comply, Democrats have said they would not consider contempt or any other penalties, instead using the non-compliance as evidence of obstruction for impeachment.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, Trump's personal lawyer Jay Sekulow criticized Democrats' strategy.\n\n\"Now, as the White House decides to exercise its constitutional right, they're going to turn that into an impeachment article. That's absurd,\" Sekulow told NBC News.\n\nTrump said last week he would let his lawyers decide whether to he would cooperate with the congressional investigation.\n\nWhile the administration has refused to cooperate, Democrats have continued to ratchet up their demands. House Democrats on Monday issued a pair of subpoenas to Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Office of Management and Budget Acting Director Russell Vought demanding documents and communication regarding Trump's decision to suspend U.S. aid to Ukraine.\n\nSo far, Democrats have issued six subpoenas as part of the impeachment probe. The others target Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani. Democrats have also requested documents from Vice President Mike Pence, but not yet issued a subpoena for the material.\n\nCongress has limited ability to enforce those subpoenas, with potential penalties for noncompliance ranging from holding them in contempt to issuing daily fines. More than a century ago, Congress sent its sergeant-at-arms to arrest a witness for non-cooperation, but that scenario is viewed as an extremely unlikely move in the present day.\n\nHouse Democrats launched the impeachment inquiry last month amid reports of Trump's July phone conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, during which he asked Zelenskiy to \"look into\" former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Trump's decision to unexpectedly freeze nearly $400 million in military aid to the Ukraine days before the call has led to allegations that he was attempting a quid pro quo arrangement.", "description": "The move comes hours after the administration blocked the testimony of U.S. ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/4218062/1000x563_nbc-191003-donald-trump-al-1103_d5b4bde3068ab075b9119e6ea612f5a2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
