And when nearly half of US couples argue about money, it's hardly surprising that employment status and salary rank among those factors.\n\nOf course, salary and job stability have a lot to do with one's career path and employer, which is why certain fields seem to have a more favorable association with lasting marriages \u2014 and others don't. To that end, statistician Nathan Yau recently took data from the US Census Bureau's American Community Survey from 2015 in order to determine the occupations with the highest and lowest divorce rates.\n\nCareer may not be the No. 1 determining factor in whether a person will get a divorce, but financial stability and overall satisfaction with life are important contributors. Workplace atmosphere could also influence whether one goes through a divorce. Yau's research found that gaming and casino managers have the highest divorce rates in America, at 52.9%. Bartenders are close behind, with a 52.7% divorce rate.\n\nConversely, salaried positions tend to fare better for lasting marriages, with positions in the medical and financial fields ranking among the careers with the lowest divorce rates.\n\nSo, what are the final results?\n\nThe 10 occupations with the highest divorce rates:", "description": "If you're a casino or gaming manager, or a bartender, you may want to focus on your relationship more.", "authors": ["Leah Thomas"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d35c5af8d664249c743a91f?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
