They would also have control of 45 percent of the seats on the board of directors at corporations.\n\nSanders\u2019 agenda would also raise the corporate tax from 21 percent to 35 percent, which was the rate before the Republicans passed the 2017 tax cut. He vows to review the mergers approved by President Donald Trump\u2019s administration and undo any that were \u201cimproper,\u201d lays out a proposal to combat offshore tax havens, and promises to treat large stock buybacks \u201clike stock manipulation\u201d as well.\n\nSanders\u2019 aides estimated that Amazon would have paid as much as $3.8 billion in taxes last year if his policies had been in effect.\n\nHow would it work?\n\nCompanies that meet Sanders' guidelines \u2014 ones that are publicly traded or bring in $100 million or more in annual revenue \u2014 would be required to give at least 2 percent of their stock to their employees every year, until they reach 20 percent.\n\nThose businesses would also need to put aside 45 percent of their corporate board seats to be elected by the company's employees.\n\nSanders would also create a $500 million \"U.S. Employee Ownership Bank\" that would give loans to workers who want to buy their businesses.\n\nWho opposes it?\n\nConservatives say that raising the corporate tax would eliminate jobs, reduce wages and hurt the economy.\n\nHow does it compare?\n\nEarlier this year, Elizabeth Warren released a plan to require that 40 percent of seats on corporate boards be elected by workers. As Warren has risen in the polls, Sanders and his aides have begun to draw contrasts between the two candidates.\n\nSanders' worker ownership proposal is the latest example. His wealth tax also goes beyond what Warren called for, and he has said that his agenda to fight climate change is the \u201cmost comprehensive\u201d ever.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/e4/01/d751bfa5498ea3ac777e2b3f122b/20191014-bernie-sanders-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
