But sometimes it doesn't come easily.\n\nAnd research shows that today\u2019s kids are getting less sleep than children from past generations.\n\nMost parents know that not getting enough sleep can make kids moody and irritable. But do you know why? One big reason is stress. Lack of sleep reduces children\u2019s ability to deal with stress, and is in fact a stressor itself.\n\nWant to read more expert advice about sleep? Check out: Active Minds, Restless Sleep \u2014 An Expert\u2019s Advice For Making Bedtime Sleep Time\n\nHow Do You Help?\n\nA recent research review conducted at the University of British Columbia found that two of the best strategies to help children and youth get more sleep are establishing sleep routines and limiting technology before bedtime.\n\n\u2022 Set regular bedtimes and consistent bedtime routines. This not only gives you the best chance of getting your kids to bed at a decent time, it also helps young children develop rhythms for sleep and waking.\n\n\u2022 Help your child wind down before bedtime with a bath, stories, quiet music or by doing some relaxed belly breathing together.\n\n\u2022 Get kids off computers, tablets and cellphones at least an hour before bedtime. Device screens, and the light they emit, stimulate the brain in ways that make it harder for children \u2014 and adults \u2014 to feel ready for sleep.\n\n\u2022 No cellphones in bed. A surprising number of teens and preteens send and receive text messages when they should be sleeping. Make night time the time when everybody recharges their cellphones.\n\nPhysical activity and sleep\n\nWe often think that physical activity will help \u201ctire children out.\u201d And it can. But physical activity during the day also results in the release of hormones called endorphins, which reduce feelings of pent-up tension or anxiety. This will also help improve a child\u2019s mood, and that lessened stress could help them sleep better.\n\nTalk About It\n\nParents and children often talk about sleep in moments of disagreement.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s past your bedtime!\u201d\n\n\u201cNoooo! None of my friends have to go to bed this early!\u201d\n\nSometimes Parents Think of Their Own Tricks: The 3-Minute Sleep Trick That Saved My Son From Sleepless Nights\n\nTry to have positive conversations about sleep, too. It\u2019s important to teach and remind children that sleep is good for us. Sleep helps us feel good physically and mentally, restores our energy and, generally, helps us be our best selves. Use examples from the child\u2019s own experience to illustrate these points, but try to do that in a positive way.\n\nThese conversations are most likely to be helpful when everyone is a good mood and when sleep is not an immediate issue. In other words, kids will be much less open to positive ideas about sleep when we\u2019re struggling to get them to go to bed.\n\nWhat sleep tricks have been most successful for you?
