For Tony Traina, 27, an associate lawyer in Chicago, however, it would have been difficult to find a more casual timepiece than the $399 Apple Watches his firm\u2019s higher-ups tend to favor. He didn\u2019t bother. As a watch-lover, he ignored protocol, showing up at work in a $1,500 mechanical watch by German brand Nomos Glash\u00fctte. But it barely went noticed.\n\nIn the past, one\u2019s shoes, one\u2019s suits and, yes, one\u2019s watch spoke volumes about one\u2019s place at work. Even though some believe status watches still send signals, today\u2019s office has drastically evolved: CEOs wear sneakers and tell time with their smartphones; many people work remotely; wristwatches are less commonly remarked upon. \u201cYou\u2019re more likely to get comments on a new iPhone\u201d than a new watch, said Ryan Cecil Smith, 33, a designer at an animation studio in Los Angeles. In January, he purchased a Rolex and braced for snipes from his Apple Watch- and Casio-wearing co-workers, but so far no one has even acknowledged the pricey timepiece.\n\nOften, wrist real estate that once held introductory-level luxury timepieces like Tag Heuers is occupied by smartwatches\u2014which themselves quietly telegraph modernity, youth, humility, tech-smarts. Most of Matthew Marcus\u2019s millennial co-workers at NCC Media, a TV-advertising sales company in Bethesda, Md., wear Apple Watches. \u201cThey kind of treat it as an extension of their phone,\u201d said Mr. Marcus, 30, who is an outlier with his no-texting, no-emailing Grand Seiko watch.\n\nFans of status watches, however, still subscribe to the view that their timepieces can skew impressions. Kevin Weinman, 34, a CFO for a luxury retail company in New York City, believes his 18-karat gold Rolex GMT Master II \u201ccreates a better perception of experience and authority,\u201d that matches his executive title.\n\nWhen Mr. Weinman was undergoing multiple interviews for a position at a startup, he swapped that flashier watch for quieter options including a vintage Rolex Datejust. \u201cI was very conscious of not wearing extremely expensive watches during the interview process\u2026I didn\u2019t want to seem as if I was priced out of a competitive compensation package.\u201d\n\nGriffin Caprio, 39, a founder of a podcast production company in Chicago, similarly changes his watch depending on whom he is meeting with. If he\u2019s facing a potential investor, he skips the eye-catching green Rolex. Instead he\u2019ll wear a watch from \u201cunder the radar\u201d brands like local Chicago brand Oak and Oscar or a Glash\u00fctte Original which is actually more expensive than his Rolex but \u201cis not as known to as many people outside of the watch industry.\u201d Mr. Traina, the lawyer in Chicago, speculated that, at his firm, people don\u2019t wear \u201cflashy\u201d watches in front of clients \u201cfor fear of them wondering where all of the money they\u2019re spending is going.\u201d\n\nBut there is more-objective evidence that status watches can cause waves. Mr. Caprio once worked as an engineer at software and technology companies, where he discovered that curious co-workers were googling his watches and learning that they went for five figures. \u201cYou almost kind of want to hide a watch a little bit,\u201d said Mr. Caprio, who felt his colleagues looked down on watch collecting as a \u201cstupid\u201d way to spend money.\n\nThe idea that a watch reflects one\u2019s place in the hierarchy definitely persists in more traditional workplaces. Myles Fennon, 40, a commercial real-estate broker in Manhattan, noted there are certain watches, including a ceramic Rolex Daytona and an Audemars Piguet Royal Oak, that his co-workers buy when they\u2019re thinking, \u201cI just made a lot of money, I\u2019m going to go light some of it on fire.\u201d He prefers more-discreet watches \u201ca couple layers deeper\u201d than the common Rolex, like a modern Tudor Blackbay stainless-steel sports watch. He can recall a recent deal with three other brokers who all wore various Daytonas (which can retail for $10,000 and up): \u201cOn the elevator ride down I was like, \u2018Sorry I didn\u2019t get the memo that it was Daytona day.\u2019\u201d\n\nWRIST MANAGEMENT // FIVE WATCHES THAT SPEAK MORE LOUDLY THAN YOUR LINKEDIN PROFILE\n\nPhoto: Bryan Gardner for the Wall Street Journal, Styling by Anne Cardenas\n\nFor the sporty striver who may or may not have kayaked to work\n\nApple Watch Series 4, $399, apple.com\n\nPhoto: Bryan Gardner for the Wall Street Journal, Styling by Anne Cardenas\n\nFor the discreet cubicle drone with tastes beyond Timex\n\nGrand Seiko SBGE205, $5,400, Seiko, 212-355-3718\n\nPhoto: Bryan Gardner for the Wall Street Journal, Styling by Anne Cardenas\n\nFor the low-key lawyer\n\nNOMOS Glash\u00fctte Tangente Neomatik 41 Update Ruthenium, $4,100, London Jewelers, 212-381-9455\n\nPhoto: Bryan Gardner for the Wall Street Journal, Styling by Anne Cardenas\n\nFor ABC Guy (Always Be Closing)\n\nRolex Cosmograph Daytona, $12,400, Tourneau Time Machine, 212-758- 7300\n\nPhoto: Bryan Gardner for the Wall Street Journal, Styling by Anne Cardenas\n\nFor the richer, more original ABC Guy\n\nPatek Philippe Nautilus Reference 5711, $79,000, Michael Ashton, 212-517-6655", "description": "Even in the age of the Apple Watch and casual everything, your timepiece is sending certain signals to colleagues in the know.", "authors": ["Jacob Gallagher", "Jacob.Gallagher Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-101746/social"}
