(Photo: DAVID HINDLEY/SHOWTIME)\n\nHow much of a stage mom was Judy Garland\u2019s mother?\n\nIn \u201cSid & Judy,\u201d Garland says this in an interview about her mother: \u201cShe was truly a stage mother, a mean one (who would say), \u2018You get out and sing or I\u2019ll wrap you around the bedpost and break you off short.\u2019 \u201d\n\nShe continued: \"(My parents) would argue and fight, and my mother would always use me as a pawn.\" By the time Garland's mother, Ethel, died in 1953, \"their relationship had deteriorated so badly,\" according to Luft. Less than two months earlier, Garland had prevented her mother from meeting newborn daughter Lorna.\n\nWhat was Judy's real history with prescription meds?\n\nIn \u201cJudy,\u201d Darci Shaw plays a young Garland who takes appetite-suppressing \u201cpep pills,\u201d and Zellweger shows an adult Garland who swallows pills to help her sleep.\n\nThe star\u2019s real addiction was so serious that as a teenager she was amped on benzedrine to fight exhaustion as she shot musical numbers for Busby Berkeley productions. According to Luft in the documentary, even as an adult, Garland had Tuinal capsules sewn into the lining of robes in an effort to hide her habit. Her drug use led to numerous sick days and at least one near-fatal hospital visit.\n\nHow did her London shows really go?\n\nIn \u201cJudy,\u201d Zellweger plays a Garland who skips rehearsals and stumbles through a final run of Talk of the Town performances in the months leading up to her death. In real life, Garland\u2019s shows did deteriorate over the five-week gig, with her arriving terribly late and getting booed by audiences. The shows were a far cry from Garland\u2019s 1960 London Palladium performance that got raves and was followed in 1961 by a Grammy-winning stint at Carnegie Hall.\n\nSid Luft looks on as Judy Garland holds their son, Joey. (Photo: SHOWTIME)\n\nWhat happened to Judy\u2019s husbands and children?\n\nThough only two of Garland's husbands, Luft and Mickey Deans, get major airtime in \"Judy\" and \"Sid & Judy,\" she married five times.\n\nHer first husband, Emmy-winning composer David Rose (married 1941-44), who was 12 years Garland\u2019s senior, remarried and died in 1990. Her \u201cMeet Me in St. Louis\u201d director Vincente Minnelli (1945-51), who fathered Liza Minnelli, remarried three more times and died in 1986. Producer Luft (1952-65 and stoically played by Rufus Sewell in \u201cJudy\u201d), who wrote about his relationship with Garland, fathered Lorna and Joey Luft; he married twice more and died in 2005. Actor Mark Herron (1965-69), who had a lengthy relationship with fellow actor Henry Brandon, died in 1996.\n\nShe married her last husband, club promoter Deans (played by a flirty Finn Wittrock in \u201cJudy\u201d), who was 12 years her junior, in 1969. They were married just three months before her death; he died in 2003.\n\nGarland\u2019s kids didn't shy away from show business: Liza Minnelli, 73, has won an Oscar, Emmy and numerous Tony Awards; Lorna Luft, 66, is a singer and actress; and Joey Luft, 64, has also done some performing.\n\nCLOSE At the Los Angeles premiere of the remake of \"A Star Is Born,\" Judy Garland's daughter - actress Lorna Luft - says her mother would have enjoyed the new incarnation of the film. (Sept. 25) AP\n\nWhy did the LGBTQ community embrace Garland?\n\nIn \u201cJudy,\u201d Garland visits the home of two male fans, and sympathizes with them and their fight for gay rights. That scene was contrived for the movie, but in reality, Garland did become an LGBTQ icon.\n\nIn \u201cSid & Judy,\u201d real fans \u2013 mostly men and women in Dorothy attire \u2013 explain their love for Garland at a screening of \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d: \u201cShe\u2019s timeless.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s the epitome of hope.\u201d \u201cShe had a lot of struggles, but she overcame a lot of them.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s an amazing believer in people.\u201d And \u201cshe did love the gays. Married a few gays, right?\u201d\n\nCLOSE \"Judy,\" star Renee Zellweger says she didn't think of winning an Oscar while prepping for the part and is happy that the film celebrates Judy Garland's life. (Oct. 1) AP Entertainment\n\nWhat did Garland say about the tribulations of fame?\n\nIn Garland\u2019s words, per \u201cSid & Judy,\u201d being a living legend is \u201clonesome.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with Jack Paar, she says that it\u2019s \u201clike a Statue of Liberty, or something like that, who doesn\u2019t breathe. And so no one calls you on the phone and asks you to dinner. So I just sit by the phone.\u201d\n\nLater, she says, \u201cI\u2019ve sung, I\u2019ve entertained, I\u2019ve pleased your children, I\u2019ve pleased your wives. \u2026 I tried my damnedest to believe in that rainbow that I tried to get over and I couldn\u2019t. So what!\"\n\nJudy Garland with fifth husband Mickey Deans. She died three months after they married.

As shown in \"Sid & Judy,\" the star's arrival was celebrated with a \"Wizard of Oz\" screening at the cemetery on what would've been the star's 95th birthday.\n\nHer final resting place is in the mausoleum, renamed the Judy Garland Pavilion, which has room for family members. Noelle Berman, a Hollywood Forever spokeswoman, told the Associated Press that the move was made after Garland\u2019s fifth husband Deans, who controlled her affairs, died. Garland\u2019s three children live nearby in Southern California.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2019/10/17/what-happened-judy-garland-renee-zellweger-biopic-showtime-documentary-explain/3946009002/", "description": "Fifty years after Judy Garland's death, the biopic \"Judy\" and Showtime documentary \"Sid & Judy\" answer these burning questions about the star's life.", "authors": ["Carly Mallenbaum", "Published P.M.
