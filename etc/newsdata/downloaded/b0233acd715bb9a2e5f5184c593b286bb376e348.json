One EU official described that meeting as \u201csuccessful (at least for Putin).\u201d\n\nHowever, most of the cables consist of low-level classified documents detailing the often mundane communications between EU officials. The content does not appear to be of similar sensitivity to the U.S. diplomatic cables published by WikiLeaks in 2010 or the Democratic National Committee emails published in 2016.\n\nWatch: This Is How Easy It Is To Get Hacked\n\nOf greater concern to the EU and the west is China\u2019s demonstrable ability to infiltrate secure networks yet remain hidden.\n\nAccording to Area 1, the hackers were able to penetrate the system without the need for sophisticated tools or techniques, relying instead on human error.\n\nA Cypriot official clicked on a phishing email, which was enough to let the hackers gain access to the entire network, the company said.\n\n\u201cAfter over a decade of experience countering Chinese cyberoperations and extensive technical analysis, there is no doubt this campaign is connected to the Chinese government,\u201d Blake Darche, one of Area 1\u2019s experts, told the Times.\n\nThe company added that the networks of the UN, the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO), and ministries of foreign affairs and finance worldwide had also been compromised.\n\n\u201cThe core targets mentioned in the report so far, communications from the EU and the United Nations, are a high priority for many attackers and this is unlikely to be the last time they are compromised,\u201d Chris Doman, security researcher for AlienVault, told VICE News\n\nThe EU hack is the latest evidence that the People\u2019s Liberation Army has been conducting widespread cyber espionage campaigns targeting governments, businesses, and individuals around the globe.\n\nJust last week the U.S. government publicly blamed China for the recent breach of the Marriott reservation system, which saw 500 million customer records compromised, including credit card information and passport details.\n\nThe Department of Justice is expected to announce indictments against several Chinese government hackers later this week.\n\nBeijing has been conducting cyber espionage campaigns for years, including the theft of huge amounts of valuable intellectual property, which has been used to help the country\u2019s indigenous businesses, as well as aid its military develop advanced weaponry.\n\nA landmark agreement signed by Chinese President Xi Jinping and then U.S. President Barack Obama in 2015 was meant to signal an end to such operations \u2014 but in the last 12 months, officials have seen an increase in cyberattacks.\n\nThe EU has said that its most classified documents \u2014 designated \u201ctres secret\u201d \u2014 are held on a separate more secure system that is currently being upgraded.\n\nHowever, human error can always render even the most sophisticated systems redundant.\n\n\u201cInternational institutions are often only as strong as their weakest members,\u201d Doman said. \u201cIt's hard to get the balance right between a communication system that enough people can access to be useful and is secure enough. As mentioned in the report there are multiple levels of communication systems used at an institution like the EU with increasing security and decreasing accessibility.\u201d\n\nLast week it was revealed that Albania was posting sensitive intelligence information online, opening up the opportunity for hackers to infiltrate NATO\u2019s network.\n\nThis article originally appeared on VICE News.", "description": "\"There is no doubt this campaign is connected to the Chinese government.\u201d", "authors": ["Talia Slonim", "Meera Navlakha"], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5c1a31d71854f30006cb14aa/lede/1545223084259-hacking.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.84375xh;center,center&resize=1200:*"}
