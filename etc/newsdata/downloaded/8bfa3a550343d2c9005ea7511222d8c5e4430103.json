To tackle that question, we need to go back to the royal basics and explore the Queen's relationship with parliament.\n\nSo what does the Queen do, exactly?\n\nQueen Elizabeth II wears a lot of hats: she is the head of state of the United Kingdom and also the head of the Commonwealth. She is head of the armed forces and the Church of England.\n\nAged 93, she has reigned for 67 years.\n\nImage copyright PA Image caption The Queen's coronation in 1953\n\nHer role is constitutional, not political, meaning that an elected government has the power to pass new laws and make important decisions for the country. Her duties are largely ceremonial.\n\nThe Queen formally appoints the prime minister of the day but must remain neutral when it comes to political matters.\n\nThat is why it would be deeply controversial for Mr Cameron to have used the Queen for his own political gain.\n\nWhat is the Queen's relationship with the prime minister?\n\nThe Queen has worked alongside 14 leaders, from Sir Winston Churchill in the 1950s to Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s to Boris Johnson today.\n\nAfter appointing the prime minister, she holds a regular audience with them, meaning she meets them or speaks to them on the phone on a weekly basis.\n\nThese meetings are an opportunity for her to express her views on political matters.\n\nImage copyright PA Image caption Despite rumours she disapproved of Margaret Thatcher's policies, the Queen has always stayed neutral on politics\n\n\"There has always been an understanding between the Prime Minister and the Queen that an audience with the Queen in private remains private,\" says Dickie Arbiter a royal commentator.\n\nMr Cameron's exposure of details of their conversation goes against all protocol.\n\nFollowing his revelations, Mr Cameron admitted: \"I've already said perhaps a little bit too much.\"\n\nWhat happened in the Scottish referendum?\n\nThe referendum took place in September 2014 and asked voters in Scotland: \"Should Scotland be an independent country?\"\n\nThe Queen was reportedly concerned about the possibility of Scotland opting to sever the 300-year union with England and Wales.\n\nLeading up to the vote, one poll predicted a Yes victory, which threw then-Prime Minister David Cameron into a panic.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The Yes side of the Scottish referendum gained momentum in the lead up to the vote\n\nThat's why Mr Cameron said he asked the Queen for \"just a raising of the eyebrow even... a quarter of an inch\" - a strong statement, by royal standards.\n\nFour days before the vote, the Queen told a well-wisher outside church near her Balmoral estate in Scotland that she hoped people would \"think very carefully about the future\".\n\nScottish citizens ultimately voted in favour of staying part of the United Kingdom by 55.3%.\n\nMr Cameron said he did not ask \"for anything that would be in any way improper or unconstitutional\".\n\n'Displeasure' - how angry is that?\n\nA source has told the BBC that the comments have caused displeasure at Buckingham Palace.\n\nLike Queen Victoria's famous expression \"we are not amused\" - which she was rumoured to have used when angry - the word \"displeasure\" will probably be quite an understatement.\n\nBBC Royal correspondent Jonny Dymond said the source's words suggested \"something coming pretty close to real anger\" at what Mr Cameron said.\n\nIt is difficult to imagine anything other than horror in the palace at David Cameron's revelations, he added.\n\nWhy can't the palace just say the Queen is angry?\n\nBuckingham Palace policy is not to comment on private matters. Even when it does offer statements, these remain neutral and emotionless.\n\nEven in person the Queen avoids an emotional response.\n\n\"She doesn't react to anything. Her face is very bland,\" said Mr Arbiter.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The Queen with her grandchildren Zara and Peter Phillips on board HMY Britannia, which was retired in 1997\n\nHe said the only time he could remember a reaction from the Queen was at the decommissioning ceremony for Her Majesty's Yacht Britannia, when the monarch was said to have shed a tear.\n\nThe word \"displeasure\" is telling and hints at real agitation in the palace, but linguistically does not betray emotion and avoids scandal.\n\nWhere does this leave the relationship between Queen and the PM?\n\nThe Buckingham Palace source that spoke to the BBC said \"it serves no one's interests\" for conversations between the PM and the Queen to be made public.\n\n\"It makes it very hard for the relationship to thrive,\" they added.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The Queen invited Boris Johnson to become prime minister in July\n\nJust as the first rule of Fight Club is that you do not talk about Fight Club, says the BBC's Jonny Dymond, the first rule of the relationship between the prime minister and the Queen is that you never, ever talk about the relationship between the PM and the Queen.\n\nIt's significant that breaking this rule ties in with her suspension of Parliament on the instruction of Prime Minister Boris Johnson - a move which is under unprecedented scrutiny in the UK Supreme Court.\n\nThe two cases are very different, our correspondent says, but they both highlight the dark greys of the Queen's constitutional position, the discretion she has or lacks, under extraordinary circumstances, to speak out and act.", "description": "If the Queen is really that angry with David Cameron, why is Buckingham Palace's statement so muted?", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/114E6/production/_108868807_gettyimages-477218432.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
