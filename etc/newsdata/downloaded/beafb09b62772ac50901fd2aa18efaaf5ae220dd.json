That may seem like a small thing, but to people who have used this laptop in the past it\u2019s the main thing. It\u2019s the main thing because that seemingly minor complaint was the only real knock on an otherwise excellent laptop. Now that the webcam is above the screen instead of below it, I don\u2019t have to talk about the XPS 13 as an \u201cotherwise excellent\u201d laptop.\n\nI can just call it an excellent laptop.\n\nThe 2019 version of Dell\u2019s nearly iconic XPS 13 has another update compared to the previous version, an updated 8th Gen Intel Whiskey Lake processor. Though that\u2019s a nice thing to have, it\u2019s not as important as the fact that Dell has nailed most of the fundamentals that make a good laptop.\n\nOur review of Dell XPS 13 (2019) Verge Score 8.5 out of 10 Good Stuff Proper webcam placement\n\nExcellent keyboard\n\nBeautiful design Bad Stuff Only touchscreen option is the 4K screen\n\nTouchpad on the small side\n\nFans are sometimes loud Buy for $899.99 from Dell\n\nEven though the XPS 13 has a strong pedigree, it\u2019s worth talking about again. It was one of the first mainstream laptops with a nearly edge-to-edge screen. It doesn\u2019t go in for 360-degree hinge tricks \u2014 there\u2019s the XPS 13 2-in-1 for that \u2014 it was just always a good, well-built laptop. It has become something of a default alternative to the MacBook Air for Windows users \u2014 something thin, light, stylish, and also reliable. Windows has many more such laptops available now (the Surface Laptop 2 is a good choice), but the XPS 13 is still at or near the front of that pack.\n\nI really like the white version of this laptop. The top has a sort of silvery depth to its finish and the keyboard deck consists of woven carbon fiber. That extra touch makes it feel much more comfortable and I prefer it to the Surface Laptop\u2019s fabric finish. Based on what people have said about the last XPS model, it should also hold up well over time. It\u2019s a very nice-looking laptop.\n\nThe 2019 version of the XPS 13 starts at $899, but I think most people will want to step up to the $1,199 (as of this writing) version. That will get you a Core i5 processor, 8GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, and the 1080p screen. Unfortunately, the only way to get a touchscreen is to jump all the way up to the $1,799 (as of this writing) model, which has a 4K screen, more RAM, and a faster processor. That\u2019s the model I\u2019ve tested here.\n\nMost people probably won\u2019t miss the touchscreen, especially since this is a traditional laptop form factor, but I find it super convenient to have. Because the touchpad is smaller than on a lot of other modern laptops, I often find myself quickly reaching up to dismiss a notification or tap an icon on the taskbar. I wish Dell offered a touchscreen option on the 1080p screen \u2014 which costs less, has better battery life, and is available on most of its competitors.\n\nBut if you\u2019re willing to spend the extra money (and take the battery life hit) to get the 4K screen, you\u2019ll find it to be excellent. The 13.3-inch screen does go nearly edge-to-edge on the top, left, and right, but there\u2019s a large-ish bezel on the bottom. Along with a lot of other people, I prefer a 3:2 aspect ratio for productivity work on laptops, which the XPS 13 does not have; it makes do with a traditional 16:9 screen. Dell has also put an anti-reflective coating on the screen which really helps with using it in a bright room.\n\nThe keyboard on this machine is excellent, with a very good balance of key travel, firmness, and thinness. I don\u2019t love that the page up and page down buttons are crammed in next to the arrow keys and I generally find that white keyboards make finding the right backlighting in a dim room a hassle. Those are minor complaints, though, and if you opt for the black and silver color, the keys come in black.\n\nAs an aside, it\u2019s weirdly hard to judge laptop keyboards in a world where the butterfly keys on MacBooks are so untrustworthy. Everything feels great and reliable by comparison. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m grading on a skewed curve here, though: it\u2019s a good keyboard.\n\nYou can log in with the fingerprint sensor on the power button \u2014 it\u2019s fast and accurate, but you have to wake the computer first and then tap it instead of just pressing down on it in a single step. It\u2019s not as seamless as a camera-based Windows Hello system, but it\u2019s still a lot more convenient than typing in a password every time you open the lid.\n\nAnd as I said, Dell moved the webcam to up above the screen so that it\u2019s not looking up your nose. That apparently took a lot more work than you might guess. Dell even had to make its own custom 2.25mm camera module to make this work. It\u2019s genuinely tiny, but just as good as larger laptop cameras I\u2019ve used \u2014 at least for the purposes of video conferencing. Here\u2019s a shot I took in a situation where there\u2019s a ton of backlighting and my face is clear and visible.\n\nPerformance is great \u2014 as it should be, with a quad-core Core i7 processor. I haven\u2019t had to limit myself when it comes to opening apps and tabs at all. Don\u2019t expect that you\u2019ll be doing much gaming, though, as it still uses an integrated graphics card. If there\u2019s a downside, though, it\u2019s the fans. They\u2019ve settled down a bit, but in the first couple of days they were spinning up way louder than I want. It has meant that the machine never gets too hot (Dell did some extra work on the internal thermals), at least.\n\nDell quotes up to 21 hours of battery life with the 1080p screen and around 12 for the 4K. As usual, I think those estimates are super optimistic, but that doesn\u2019t mean I think the battery life on this laptop is bad. In active use with battery-hogging apps like Chrome, Slack, and Tweetdeck I\u2019m getting over eight hours \u2014 that\u2019s really solid considering I\u2019m using the 4K display and haven\u2019t been too shy about cranking the brightness up.\n\nI am mostly pleased with the port choices: there are two Thunderbolt ports on the left, one USB-C port on the left, a headphone jack, and a microSD card slot. It would have been nicer if Dell had found a way to bring back a USB-A port, but it at least includes a dongle in the box.\n\nThere are just a dozen little things that this Dell XPS 13 does right. There\u2019s a little set of LED lights and a button on the side that serve as a battery meter. And the USB-C power brick is just plain thoughtful in its design: it\u2019s easy to wrap the cord around it cleanly and compactly.\n\nAlso, take a moment to see how Dell has completely whomped Apple when it comes to designing a power brick. Dell\u2019s is a joy, Apple\u2019s is a pain. pic.twitter.com/0k6ToGSNds \u2014 Dieter Bohn (@backlon) March 29, 2019\n\nThe Dell XPS 13 is designed for actual user needs, thoughtfully addressing the practical things you worry about when using a laptop. It seems a little weird to gush about the placement of the webcam or the power brick or even glare on a screen, but those are real hassles and it feels nice to have a laptop quietly solve them.\n\nThe 2019 edition of the Dell XPS 13 is great all around, and it\u2019s sort of a relief to have my biggest complaints be about configuration choices or page down buttons instead of nosecams, build quality, or unreliable keyboards. Dell took an iconic laptop design and refined it, powered it up, and made it better.", "description": "The camera is in the right place on the new Dell XPS 13.
