Mandatory credit Kyodo/via REUTERS\n\nCHIBA, Japan (Reuters) - The second round of the Zozo Championship finally started in funereal silence on Saturday morning in conditions more suitable for ducks than golfers at Narashino Country Club.\n\nSix inches (150 mm) of rain on Friday left part of the course under water, literally, with the par-four 10th hole shortened to 140 yards (128 metres) because the fairway had turned into a lake during the incessant downpours.\n\nPlay on Friday was completely washed out and even though players were allowed preferred lies, otherwise known as \u201clift, clean and place\u201d, the soggy conditions were destined to make for a trying day for competitors on Saturday. However, despite the deluge, the greens appeared in surprisingly good condition.\n\nNo spectators were allowed on the premises, due to what the tournament said were safety concerns, which created a weird atmosphere in the wake of the sellout crowd that had the course bursting at the seams on Thursday.\n\nTiger Woods, who shared the first-round lead with fellow American Gary Woodland, was scheduled to start his second round at 11.40 a.m. local time (0240 Sunday GMT).\n\nWoods is playing in Japan for the first time in 13 years, giving fans a rare opportunity to watch the 15-times major champion.\n\nBut those who did not come on Thursday might be out of luck. The tournament has yet to announce whether spectators will be permitted for Sunday\u2019s third round or Monday\u2019s final round.", "description": "The second round of the Zozo Championship finally started in funereal silence on Saturday morning in conditions more suitable for ducks than golfers at Narashino Country Club.", "authors": ["Andrew Both", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191026&t=2&i=1445070714&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9P03P-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
