When the \"Real Housewives of Beverly Hills\" star was taping the cast's reunion show, viewers noticed that her neck seemed a bit swollen. Instead of mulling it over in front of their TVs, they grabbed their phones and shared their concerns on Richards's Instagram page, and she acted on their warnings.\n\nThe grateful actress thanked her supporters on social media. Since reading their messages, Richards says she's gone for check ups and has switched to a gluten-free diet, which she says has already had positive effects.\n\nRichards's enlarged thyroid appears to have been a benign case. But as a medical expert on ABC recently noted, in other cases, an enlarged thyroid can be signs of something more serious, like an infection or cancer.\n\n\"Inside Edition\" host Deborah Norville also recently benefitted from some observant and active fans. Viewers, she said, alerted her to a lump on her neck during one broadcast.\n\n\u201cWe live in a world of see something, say something, and I\u2019m really glad we do,\u201d she explained in April. \u201cWhen you work on television, viewers comment on everything. Your hair, your makeup, the dress you\u2019re wearing. And a long time ago an Inside Edition viewer reached out to say she\u2019d seen something on my neck. It was a lump. Well, I\u2019d never noticed the thing, but I did have it checked out and the doctor said it was nothing, a thyroid nodule.\u201d\n\nIt then turned out to be cancerous, and she quickly had surgery to remove it.\n\nThank goodness for eagle-eyed fans!", "description": "Actress Denise Richards successfully treated an enlarged thyroid, and she .09/02/2019 3:15:36AM EST.", "authors": ["Cortney O'Brien", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/220/8ead389a-012b-4031-a3ed-750270a8c7df.png"}
