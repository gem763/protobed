These metal-and-silicone employees will speak and understand Chinese, Japanese, Korean and English, ensuring that tourists near and far can interact with the startlingly human-like maids, receptionists, and porters. They look human, if a little addicted to Botox and fillers.\n\nThe plans, announced by the Japanese government at the end of January, show off a prototype check-in counter lined with identical female bots.", "description": "Nagasaki\u2019s Henn-na Hotel will feature ten robotic, but startlingly human-like, members of staff.
