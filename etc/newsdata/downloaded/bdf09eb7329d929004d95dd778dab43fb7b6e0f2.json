Andy Levin (D-MI) and Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD) said their letter to Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos was meant to address accusations of censorship within the Department of Education.\n\nThe lawmakers accused her of turning a blind eye to university campuses that violate Executive Order 13864, a directive that threatens to withhold federal funding on college and university campuses that censor free speech.\n\nAlso, Levin and Raskin claimed Liberty University had violated the First Amendment and Title IX.\n\nFalwell responding by saying the lawmakers made \u201cfalse statements and erroneous conclusions.\u201d\n\nThe Democrats also accused Liberty University of \u201cextreme restrictions on student free speech and association rights\u201d and suggested the administration was doing so based on politics.\n\n\u201cLiberty reportedly bans LGBTQ relationships and places content restrictions on media students can view,\u201d the lawmakers wrote.\n\nThe also accused Falwell of personally censoring students by blocking a student-written column from being published in what they called the \u201cstudent-run newspaper.\u201d\n\nFalwell addressed the scurrilous charges in a prepared statement \u2013 pointing out that \u201cas a private university, Liberty University simply cannot violate the First Amendment of its students because the First Amendment is a limitation on the government\u2019s power to regulate private speech and association.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo the behavioral limitations Liberty University places on students through its conduct code, such as prohibiting viewing pornography and sex outside of biblical marriage, are fully consistent with the proper role of a Christian institution of higher education in the US and are what both its students and their parents expect,\u201d Falwell said.\n\nFalwell also refuted allegations that he censored the \u201cLiberty Champion\u201d newspaper. He pointed out the university \u201cowns, publishes and pays the staff.\u201d And as such the university was simply exercising its editorial control of the paper.\n\nThe Democrats also suggested that Liberty\u2019s rules regarding religious conduct violate Title IX, another accusation swatted away by Falwell.\n\n\u201cTo the extent Liberty University\u2019s code of conduct furthers its founding religious tenets, Congress wisely included a religious exemption in Title IX to protect the University\u2019s right to do so,\u201d Falwell said. \u201cIt is indeed a shame that two federal legislators can be so out of touch with the basic civics concerning the laws about which they wrote the Secretary.\"\n\nThat\u2019s a polite way of saying the congressmen are uninformed pinheads.\n\nMSNBC\u2019s Rachel Maddow lobbed uneducated criticism when she told a podcaster that Liberty was not a real university.\n\nIn truth, Liberty University is a well-respected, and academically rigorous institution that actually promotes free speech and free expression. They have invited a range of speakers to address students - from Sen. Bernie Sanders to President Trump.\n\nRegardless, this attack on a private Christian university must not go unanswered. The congressmen must retract their false statements and apologize to Liberty University.\n\nIt\u2019s one thing when the host of a low-rated, leftwing cable television program hurls unfounded smears. But when members of Congress do so, it comes perilously close to an abuse of power.", "description": "A pair of Democrat congressmen took cheap shots at Liberty .10/09/2019 14:35:24PM EST.", "authors": ["Todd Starnes", "Cortney O'Brien", "Julio Rosas", "Timothy Meads", "Guy Benson"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2017/133/bd6f8b0d-7af2-4cef-82a0-0b1d9a8b2d25.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
