The warring came to a brutal end in 1968, when an attack by the Kayap\u00f3, who came armed with guns, left 26 Panar\u00e1, who only had arrows to defend themselves, dead.\n\nTensions remained high for years but according to those gathered in Kubenkokre, the two sides have now overcome their animosity for a greater goal.\n\n\"Today, we have only one enemy, the government of Brazil, the president of Brazil, and those invading [indigenous territories],\" Kayap\u00f3 leader Mudjire explained.\n\n\"We have internal fights but we've come together to fight this government.\"\n\nHis words were echoed by Panar\u00e1 leader Sinku: \"We've killed the Kayap\u00f3 and the Kayap\u00f3 have killed us, we've reconciled and will no longer fight.\"\n\n\"We've got a shared interest to stand together so the non-indigenous people don't kill all of us,\" he said, referring to the threats posed by the arrival of miners and loggers carrying out illegal activities in their area.\n\n'69,000 football fields lost'\n\nMore than 800,000 indigenous people live in 450 demarcated indigenous territories across Brazil, about 12% of Brazil's total territory. Most are located in the Amazon region and some groups still live completely isolated and without outside contact.\n\nPresident Jair Bolsonaro, who took office in January, has repeatedly questioned whether these demarcated territories - which are enshrined in Brazil's constitution - should continue to exist, arguing that their size is disproportionate to the number of indigenous people living there.\n\nHis plans to open up these territories for mining, logging and agriculture are controversial, and any change to their status would need to be passed by the Brazilian Congress.\n\nImage copyright Lucas Landau/Rede Xingu+ Image caption Indigenous groups performed traditional dances and songs during the meeting\n\nBut it is something that worries the indigenous leaders gathered in Kubenkokre. \"Other presidents had more concern for our land. [Mr Bolsonaro] isn't concerned about this, he wants to put an end to what our people have and to how we live,\" explains Panar\u00e1 leader Sinku.\n\n\"That's why I have a heavy heart and that's why we're here talking to each other.\"\n\nIn some demarcated areas, loggers and miners are already at work after some local indigenous leaders granted them permission.\n\nIndigenous leader Bepto Xikrin told the gathering how some 400 miners and loggers had illegally entered the Bacaj\u00e1 territory since the start of the year. He said that members of his indigenous group were scared and did not know what to do.\n\nAnd according to a network of 24 environmental and indigenous groups, Rede Xingu+, an area equivalent to 69,000 football fields was destroyed between January and June of this year alone in the Xingu river region.\n\nImage copyright Lucas Landau/Rede Xingu+ Image caption Kayap\u00f3 leader Doto Takakire shows some of the destroyed areas in the Xingu basin\n\nHeavy machinery has caused major damage and the Fresco and Branco rivers that run through the region have been contaminated with mercury.\n\nKayap\u00f3 leader Doto Takakire said illegal mining had been further encouraged by the fact that it often goes unpunished.\n\nAnalysis by BBC Brasil shows the number of fines handed out by the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (Ibama) for environmental violations has dropped significantly since President Bolsonaro took office on 1 January.\n\nMr Bolsonaro has in the past pledged to limit the fines imposed for damaging the Amazon and many blame the president for Ibama's current weak position.\n\n'We won't repeat the past'\n\nAt the meeting - which was held in both Portuguese and Kayap\u00f3 - participants discussed projects for their region's economic developments which do not contribute to deforestation, such as handicrafts and the processing of native fruits.\n\n\"[I'm concerned] about the trees, water, fish, the non-indigenous people who want to enter our land,\" explained Sinku. \"I don't want to contaminate the water with [toxic products from] mining... That's why I'm here.\"\n\nIndigenous groups which have allowed miners on to their land were not invited, an omission which some of those attending described as a missed opportunity.\n\n\"There's no-one here who wants agribusiness or mining in their villages, so are we just going to talk amongst ourselves?\" Kayap\u00f3 leader O\u00e9 asked.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Why the Amazon rainforest helps fight climate change\n\nThe fires which have been burning across the Amazon were not a big topic of debate at the gathering, in part because they have mainly happened outside protected indigenous reserves but also because those gathered consider illegal mining and logging as more pressing threats.\n\n\"We won't repeat the past,\" Kayap\u00f3 leader Kadkure concluded. \"From now on, we'll be united.\"", "description": "Rival indigenous groups say they have a common enemy: Brazil's President Bolsonaro and his policies.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/14C02/production/_108749948_panara_kayapo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
