The company has now moved more than $26 million USD in XRP units to a wallet held by one of the company\u2019s founders, Jed McCaleb, the same man who co-founded Stellar and the now defunct Mt. Gox exchange in Japan in 2011.\n\nRipple Keeps Making Questionable Moves\n\nMt. Gox is one of the most notorious platforms in cryptocurrency history. The company lost more than $400 million USD in BTC units in February 2014 following an overnight breach that to this day, still hasn\u2019t been fully understood or explained. It was the largest cryptocurrency theft in history until Coincheck came along in early 2018 (four years later).\n\nThat exchange lost more than half-a-billion USD in assorted crypto funds. Ironically, that exchange is also stationed in Japan, which has given the country a reputation for invoking relatively weak regulation and storage tactics.\n\nRipple has garnered its fair share of controversy over the years given that many retail customers and industry experts alike deem it to be a centralized currency. This is because more than 50 percent of available XRP units are still locked up in the accounts of the platform\u2019s executives, meaning they still hold heavy control.\n\nMany individuals claim this goes against the basic ideas of cryptocurrency, which is allegedly designed to be decentralized and lie more in the hands of the people that utilize it, whether it be for speculation or everyday payments.\n\nA class-action lawsuit is also brewing against the falling company. Many traders believe executives have lied about the status of XRP and say it should stand as a registered security.\n\nMcCaleb has a known history of dumping large amounts of XRP. The co-founder initially earned more than nine billion XRP units when the company was created as an initial \u201cthank you\u201d gift for his hard work. The problem is that the dumping or sale of funds that size could easily spell the end for the world\u2019s third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap.\n\nSo Much Money, So Much Temptation\n\nAt press time, it doesn\u2019t look like McCaleb is taking this threat too seriously. At first, the co-founder was under a strict agreement \u2013 that he couldn\u2019t sell more than $520,000 worth of XRP per year. However, those limitations have since dissipated, and McCaleb has taken full advantage of the situation, now selling vast amounts of XRP per day.\n\nPerhaps he just doesn\u2019t care about the market he\u2019s created now that he\u2019s super rich, given that he\u2019s dumped several XRP in the past and XRP has crashed before. At press time, the amount of XRP he holds is worth more than $2 billion, which is a tempting sum to say the least.", "description": "Ripple has moved more than $26 million USD in XRP to the wallet of its co-founder Jed McCaleb, who continues to dump vast amounts of XRP.", "authors": ["Nick Marinoff"], "top_image": "https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/https://s3.amazonaws.com/lbn-s3/2019/02/ripple.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
