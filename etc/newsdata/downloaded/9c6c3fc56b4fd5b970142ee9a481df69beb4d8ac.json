He also said that most U.S. media has a \u201cconsistently blinkered view\u201d of Saudi Arabia, one that portrays negative events in the kingdom as \u201cbeing the norm.\u201d\n\nThe murder last year of Khashoggi, a U.S resident and Washington Post columnist, as well as the long-running war and humanitarian crisis in Yemen and the detention of Saudi female activists have all strained the kingdom\u2019s relations with much of the Washington establishment outside the White House. Senior lawmakers in both parties remain unified on the issue of punishing the kingdom.\n\nPrince Turki spoke at an event in Washington about a week before Saudi Arabia hosts its annual investment forum, the Future Investment Initiative. The Oct. 29-31 event is set to attract some of Wall Street\u2019s top dealmakers, as well as representatives from major institutional investors across the globe, after many skipped the forum last year.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Jared Kushner, a White House adviser and President Donald Trump\u2019s son-in-law, plan to attend the investment event. Mnuchin last year boycotted the investment meeting after Khashoggi was killed and dismembered by Saudi agents in Turkey.\n\nHow many congressional leaders \u201chave deigned to pay a visit to the kingdom?\u201d Prince Turki said at the event. \u201cShould they visit Riyadh they may learn something about universal health care, which the kingdom has provided for its citizens since its establishment\u201d or \u201cthey may get an insight into our improving and evolving educational system.\u201d\n\nSaudi Arabia has been working hard to remake its image since the Khashoggi killing, marketing it as a tourist destination. It is building major tourism projects, transforming its Red Sea coastline to bring in holidaymakers and developing an entertainment city near the capital of Riyadh. The kingdom also said it plans to drop a requirement for men and women who visit to prove they\u2019re related in order to share a hotel room.\n\nLast month, Saudi Arabia announced it would drop its strict dress code for foreign women, who will no longer be required to wear an abaya, the flowing cloak that\u2019s been mandatory attire for decades. \u201cModest clothing\u201d will still be called upon, according to Ahmed Al-Khateeb, chairman of the Saudi Commission for Tourism and National Heritage.\n\nChanges introduced by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman were praised on Thursday by Timothy Lenderking, the deputy assistant secretary for Arabian Gulf Affairs.\n\nPrince Mohammed is leading \u201cvery dynamic change\u201d inside Saudi Arabia, Lenderking said at the same event as Prince Turki on Thursday. \u201cThe change is real, it\u2019s beneficial. The Saudi population, by and large, is responding very positively to it.\u201d\n\n(Updates to add State Department official\u2019s comments in final two paragraphs.)\n\n--With assistance from Patrick Donahue.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Glen Carey in Washington at gcarey8@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Bill Faries at wfaries@bloomberg.net, Elizabeth Wasserman\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Prince Turki Al-Faisal, a former Saudi intelligence chief and an influential royal family member, told U.S. lawmakers to get off their \u201chigh moralistic horses\u201d as ties between the historical allies remain frayed a year after the murder of columnist Jamal Khashoggi.Prince Turki criticized", "authors": ["Glen Carey"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Fg0B2FhcY4nOj2m7RfkVEw--~B/aD0xMzUyO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/0afce9e98d8eaddcc8fd0794a4a9958d", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
