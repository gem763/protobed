Inside him are two tiny pellets, shining somewhere under the muck. They are shutting down his organs. Above him, his mother is terrified, defending the work her personal healer is doing. \u201cYes, they\u2019re necessary,\u201d she barks, speaking of the crystals on his forehead and presumably still in his armpits. \u201cThey\u2019re just some shiny stones.\u201d\n\nThey are harmless, unless you assume they\u2019re all that\u2019s necessary for his recovery. And that\u2019s not her assumption. She keeps talking, suggesting they check for poisons, acknowledging that would be strange, two poisonings in one week. But it\u2019s possible, she says. \u201cHe\u2019s a very divisive figure.\u201d\n\nIn \u201cThe Assassination of Payton Hobart: Part II,\u201d he certainly is. His life is saved as his dream is dashed, he goes from liked and respected to reviled with a few words from Dusty Jackson\u2019s mouth. There\u2019s a lot of that kind of parallel storytelling in this episode: crystals and pellets, Ricardo turning on Dusty and Dusty on Payton, Payton\u2019s disgrace and Skye\u2019s arrest, Infinity\u2019s many photocopies and Andrew\u2019s \u201creceipts.\u201d\n\nSo yes, bad times reveal false friends, and that\u2019s what Payton discovers (or will soon discover) in the penultimate episode of The Politician\u2019s first season. But being a divisive figure means people split to different sides. James walks away. Alice draws back her hand. Skye, who for sure poisoned him, couldn\u2019t be more thrilled to be president. And all those bedside vigils earned Payton nothing, as his mother\u2019s failure to meet Brigitte and run away \u2014 an appointment she missed because of his collapse \u2014 resulted in the horse trainer calling Mr. Hobart and spilling her guts. So the deal is off, and the faux-Winklevii are back in the will, with both Payton and Georgina cut off for good. No class presidency, no Harvard, no team, no First Lady-To-Be, no fortune, no father, no plan, and no way to do the one thing he really wants to do: help people.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t like those parts of me, and I don\u2019t either,\u201d he unloads on the principal. \u201cBut that might be what I\u2019m stuck with, so that might just be who I am.\u201d Later, he adds: \u201cI may not be a good person, but I wanted to do good things. I still do.\u201d\n\nMuch of this first season, including those gorgeous credits, has concerned Payton\u2019s two selves. There\u2019s the person he\u2019s building, and the person hiding inside. Peyton doesn\u2019t seem to like either of them. But there\u2019s another split in him, made clear by that last line. He sees a good person and a person who wants to do good things as totally separate entities, but luckily, he still has people in his circle who can see otherwise \u2014 even if one of them is a Dream Ghost.\n\nFirst, there\u2019s River. (Welcome back, David Corenswet! You were missed!) In a too-brief scene, River (and writers Ian Brennan and Brad Falchuk) get a lot accomplished. Payton says River\u2019s death makes no sense, because he had everything; River says he got all the help possible, and it just wasn\u2019t ever going to be enough. \u201cI feel everything. There just wasn\u2019t enough positive emotion to balance me out.\u201d Then he turns his attention to Payton, and gives him something vital he\u2019s lacked all season: a reason to be president. It is Payton\u2019s great task in life to try to restore balance, not in a crystals and essential oils kind of way, but in trying to ensure the good does not outweigh the bad.\n\nNext is Infinity. After Ricardo, who seems like he could possibly be a little bit remorseful, tells Infinity what\u2019s happening to Payton, she races to the hospital, no hesitation. He saved her life, though he took way too long to do so, and now she gets to return the favor \u2014 though it takes her a minute to get the doctors to the word \u201csepsis.\u201d That settled, she plans to leave Dusty and Ricardo behind and head for Paris, but first she stops to tell Nana that she\u2019s called the cops, who made her repeat it all a bunch. Dusty is going down, and the knowledge seems to prompt an apology, and the confession that she \u201cmight have some psychological problems,\u201d a line that wouldn\u2019t be at all funny if Jessica Lange didn\u2019t time that pause just right. It\u2019s gratifying to Infinity, who clearly still loves her grandmother, but as they embrace, Dusty starts going on and on about all the spa treatments that are going to help her. And that\u2019s all she wrote.\n\nOne Ricardo arrival, two hapless suicide attempts, and an accidental shooting later, Ricardo\u2019s trading what he knows for two Filets-O-Fish and a shake. Then Dusty\u2019s telling tales on Payton. And while Infinity still seems to be firmly in Payton\u2019s camp, she also inadvertently set off the chain reaction that gets him shunned by everyone, including his intended college.\n\nIt isn\u2019t actually everyone, though. While James and Alice jump ship, the person he\u2019d already thrown overboard seems to be holding on all the same. We learn that McAfee went dumpster diving for clues at Skye\u2019s house, finding the evidence that Payton was poisoned, and she proves that at least one member of Team Payton has learned from their Munchausen debacle: She calls the cops. This is a great little scene, with Rahne Jones and Laura Dreyfuss both doing solid, subtle work. And what her relationship with Payton might look like moving forward is one of the more intriguing threads left dangling in this episode.\n\nFor a penultimate episode, this hour sure does feel like a finale. Astrid calls the FBI on the dad who thinks she\u2019s a loser, thereby rendering herself a winner in his eyes. Then she packs a bag, rejects financial help, tells her mom she can\u2019t come with her, and heads for New York and a hopeful job at Bubba Gump\u2019s. Georgina, the fourth person still on the pro side of the Payton divide, auctions off her only remaining assets \u2014 jewels and caftans, as Payton puts it \u2014 and donates the money (spitefully thrown down by a spitting Bob Balaban) to charities helping victims of Munchausens by proxy, in Payton\u2019s name. Then they climb in Payton\u2019s gorgeous car and head for the train station, and Georgina heads for an ashram somewhere.\n\nThe scene in the train station is the main Paltrow event in this episode, though she does trot out a few great line readings in those early scenes. She leaves Payton with advice that can best be summed up as \u201cbe a person, starting now.\u201d He cries as she leaves, and the most interesting moment in that cry is the moment it stops. It\u2019s not stifled or shoved down. It just gently survives, still living with him.\n\nStill, I\u2019m nearly as taken with the drive itself, Paltrow and Platt side by side, Sufjan Stevens\u2019s \u201cChicago\u201d playing. That scene made me wonder if the title sequence\u2019s seemingly inexplicable music choice makes some sense after all. Sure, all things grow, but the real power of that song isn\u2019t the lyrics. It\u2019s the fact that it\u2019s a song seemingly designed for a good cry, if you\u2019re willing to let one slip out.\n\nTalking Points\n\n\u2022 Written by Brennan and Falchuk, directed by Gwyneth Horder-Payton, who also directed part one.\n\n\u2022 Costume of the episode: January Jones\u2019s all-white sweater ensemble is great.\n\nIn crisis?
