Bielsa\u2019s team went on to win the Clausura title and reached the final of the Copa Libertadores where they were only beaten by Sao Paulo on penalties.\n\n\u2018In six months, we changed completely the perception,\u2019 said Pochettino. \u2018I remember Bielsa talking to us individually and talking to the collective, making changes and slowly turning around the situation. That is the most important thing.\n\nSpurs boss (centre) worked with Marcelo Bielsa at Newell's Old Boys and the Argentina team\n\n\u2018We need to be clever and learn from this. But we will have to do it in a different way. That was 27 years ago. This is a different era.\u2019\n\nNo grenades, then. No threats. No over-reaction.\n\nThat was the message from the Tottenham camp and the manager pointed out his team had played their best football of the season during a half-hour spell in the first half against Bayern. \u2018We lost 7-2, but we were always alive,\u2019 said Pochettino. \u2018The last 10 minutes was a massive hit for us and left us very disappointed. But the performance was very good. One bad result is not going to change our plans. We are so strong in our mentality and ideas.\u2019\n\nTottenham have been misfiring. They were knocked out of the Carabao Cup by Colchester United of League Two. They have not won away in the Premier League since January and face another awkward away fixture at Brighton today with Serge Aurier banned after his red card against Southampton last weekend.\n\nPochettino, however, fiercely rejected theories that his players \u2014 three of them in the final year of their contracts \u2014 were no longer playing for him or that he might be looking for a way out.\n\n\u2018Three days before (the Bayern defeat) they beat Southampton with 10 men,\u2019 he said. \u2018They are committed whether they have four years or one year left on their contracts. No doubt.\n\nPochettino has backed Dele Alli after the star was omitted from the latest England squad\n\n\u2018I am not happy with this type of result. I am responsible for the situation of the team. I cannot escape or run away like a kid. You need to behave like a man, be the leader the team needs.\n\n\u2018In five-and-a-half years we talk about my future in every single press conference. And we are still talking. I hope that means I spend five years more at least.\u2019\n\nThe Spurs boss also backed Dele Alli to reclaim his England place after his omission from Gareth Southgate\u2019s latest squad.\n\n\u2018Dele is focused on trying to recover his best,\u2019 said Pochettino. \u2018He only needs time. For different reasons he is below his best but he is going to be an important player for the club this season.\n\n\u2018Two weeks working here is going to be good for him to improve.\n\n\u2018He is still 23 years old. Very young. I have no doubt he is going to be at his best again.\u2019", "description": "Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino returned to his native Argentina and a tale of Marcelo Bielsa threatening to pull the pin on a grenade as he sifted for positives in the wreckage of a thrashing.", "authors": ["Matt Barlow For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/19/19310864-0-image-a-16_1570214592176.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
