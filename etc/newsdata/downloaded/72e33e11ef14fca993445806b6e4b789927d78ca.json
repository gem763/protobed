Its parent, We Co., officially cancelled its IPO on Monday. The next day, Fitch Ratings downgraded WeWork\u2019s bonds two notches to CCC+, pointing to the company\u2019s heavy cash-burn and \u201cprecarious liquidity position\u201d due to its canceled IPO.\n\nFitch thinks WeWork has about four quarters of liquidity left, based on its recent cash-burn, the $2.5 billion of unrestricted cash on hand as of June 30, and SoftBank\u2019s expected contribution of $1.7 billion next year.\n\nInitially, WeWork\u2019s plan was to raise at least $3 billion through the IPO, $4 billion through the sale of additional bonds and up to $2 billion in letters of credit, per Fitch.\n\nBut concerns already were swirling in the run-up to WeWork\u2019s anticipated Nasdaq listing due to its high losses, lofty $47 billion private valuation and the management of its controversial co-founder, Adam Neumann, who stepped down last month.\n\nIncoming co-CEOs Artie Minson and Sebastian Gunningham have since vowed to cut costs and focus on the company\u2019s core business. On Thursday, Business Insider reported that WeWork plans to lay off up to 25% of its workforce.\n\nStill, top brass will need to steer a loss-making company with $50 billion of long-term leases on properties in 111 cities in 29 countries, with no track record of operating outside of a booming U.S economy.\n\n\u201cIf we have a recession, or a bit of a dramatic downturn, their business models is unproven,\u201d said Jason Callan, head of structured assets at Columbia Threadneedle, in an interview.\n\nNew economic data this week put fears of a looming U.S. recession back into focus. Stocks closed higher Thursday, but not before the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.47% and S&P 500 index SPX, +0.80% recorded their worst start to a quarter since the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nCheck out: WeWork is a symptom of a disease that may not have a cure\n\nCallan\u2019s biggest concern is what happens to office-property markets in New York and London, where WeWork made its biggest splash and which could be hurt if the company pulls back on its prolific leasing activities.\n\n\u201cThe reality is their growth rate going forward is going to be dramatically different,\u201d he said.\n\nWeWork did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nRead: IPO market has begun pushing back on growth-at-all-costs private companies", "description": "Office-sharing venture WeWork is burning through cash, has tens of billions in outstanding leases and debt investors who are worried.", "authors": ["Joy Wiltermuth", "Markets Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HN987_wework_ZG_20190723184956.jpg"}
