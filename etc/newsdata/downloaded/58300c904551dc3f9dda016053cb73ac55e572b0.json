But you don\u2019t really need a recipe to make fridge pickles; you just need an old pickle jar.\n\nThis idea, which comes to us from our creative producer, Heather, is elegant and ensures you end up with just the right amount of brine. Take your empty jar, and fill it with cucumbers or any other vegetable you wish to pickle. Then \u2014 leaving the veg in the jar \u2014 fill it with a mixture half vinegar and half water (eyeballing is fine).\n\nPour the mixture into a sauce pan, and add your sugar and salt. For medium jars, start with a ratio 1/4 cup of sugar and 1 tablespoon of salt, but feel free to adjust that if you like. Add garlic, seasonings, or herbs and bring everything to a boil.\n\nPour the (perfect amount of) hot liquid back into already filled pickle jar. Let cool on the counter and transfer to the fridge. You can enjoy them as soon as they\u2019re cold, but try to let the flavours develop at least overnight.", "description": "Most pickle recipes \u2014 even fridge-pickle recipes \u2014 are for making many jars of pickles, but if you live in a tiny space, or want many jars of several different types of pickled vegetables, these large-format ratios can be kind of annoying to scale down.
