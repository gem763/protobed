Officers took away the driver\u2019s licence of 254 of those alleged offenders, according to CNN.\n\nPolice also reportedly interceded in 32 cases to stop drunk driving. As CNN points out, e-scooters are classified as motorised vehicles in Germany, so driving an e-scooter while intoxicated violates drunk-driving laws.\n\nGermany legalised e-scooters in June of this year. Electric scooter sharing companies quickly seized the opportunity. And by August, politicians were already raising concerns about how the blossoming industry could cause issues when Oktoberfest rolled around, calling for restrictions on use during the festivities.\n\nAt that point, Munich police had caught 418 people for e-scooter drunk driving, according to The Guardian.\n\n\u201cThere are people who enjoy using these vehicles, but many regard them as toys rather than means of transport,\u201d head of the Association of German Cities Helmut Dedy told the German newspaper consortium Redaktionsnetzwerk Deutschland at the time. \u201cWe need clear rules of play and they must be binding.\u201d\n\nIt seems those legislators were right to fret considering officers interceded with hundreds of drunk riders over the course of the 16-day celebration of beer, food and lederhosen.\n\nIn an effort to hinder users from leaving scooters behind, CNN reports that riders were restricted from checking out on e-scooter apps while they were on the premise of the festival location. Piles of e-scooters reportedly had to be cleared out around the city every night.\n\nPerhaps next year Munich will heed the calls to enact restrictions so the city won\u2019t have to deal with an invasion of e-scooters and a plague of inebriated Bavarian-costume-donning carousers at the same time.", "description": "German police reportedly reprimanded hundreds of revellers driving e-scooters under the influence of alcohol during the Munich Oktoberfest....", "authors": ["Tegan Jones", "Alex Cranz"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/sunpmgjwzn0qlkyqztrb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
