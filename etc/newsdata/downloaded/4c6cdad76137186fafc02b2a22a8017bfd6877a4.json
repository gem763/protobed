company.\n\nLies included not telling them that the overloaded aircraft he was operating had previously been involved in three fatal crashes.\n\nRobert Murgatroyd, 53, narrowly missed the M62 when he took off in his Piper Cherokee plane from Barton Aerodrome on September 9, 2017.\n\nHe was trying to fly three bird watchers to the Isle of Barra in the Outer Hebrides to see a rare bird which had been spotted on the island for the first time in 30 years.\n\nThe plane crashed into a potato field just minutes after taking off, but none of the passengers was seriously hurt.\n\nDuring a police interview after the crash, Murgatroyd tried to describe himself as the \"hero of the moment\", Manchester Evening News reports.\n\n(Image: GMP)\n\nFollowing a trial, he was jailed for three and a half years.\n\nMurgatroyd, of Poulton-le-Fylde, Lancashire, was back in Manchester Crown Court on Friday, where he pleaded guilty to an offence of fraud, of making a false declaration to obtain insurance.\n\nIn April 2017, five months before the crash, the pilot was taking out insurance on the 45-year-old Piper Cherokee with Sydney Charles Aviation Insurance.\n\nHe was asked standard questions, such as whether the aircraft had been involved in any accidents or whether the customer had ever had any insurance cancelled or declined.\n\nA subsequent letter sent to Murgatroyd from the company stated: \"It is your duty to make a fair presentation of the risk and to disclose all material circumstances.\n\n\"A material circumstance is one that would influence the judgement of a prudent insurer in determining whether to accept a risk or not and upon what terms.\"\n\n(Image: GMP)\n\nMurgatroyd took out the policy, which cost him \u00a3965.25.\n\nProsecutor Henry Blackshaw told the court that police investigations have subsequently revealed information that the pilot should have disclosed to the insurers.\n\nHe added that this additional information would likely have increased the price of the premium or meant Murgatroyd would have been refused insurance altogether.\n\nIn February 2007, an aircraft operated by the pilot crashed into the sea at Blackpool, killing the two occupants.\n\nIn September 2016, Murgatroyd had an insurance policy cancelled because he failed to keep up with payments.\n\nIn June 2014, Murgatroyd was convicted of flying an aircraft without a valid certificate of airworthiness and was fined \u00a3300.\n\n(Image: GMP)\n\nIn May 2013, an aircraft operated and insured by him was hired out to a pilot and crashed in Caernarfon, Wales, killing one and seriously injuring two others.\n\nA similar incident happened in October 2011, when another aircraft operated and insured by him crashed in Switzerland killing both occupants.\n\nAn investigation by the police revealed that in the hours before taking out the insurance policy with Sydney Charles Aviation Insurance, Murgatroyd had been declined insurance from another firm.\n\nMurgatroyd had previously operated under the name Fly Blackpool (Flybpl).\n\nReplying to the insurers after his insurance had been declined, he wrote: \"What a crock of s***, flybpl has not had a claim on their policy and in any event the last known incident was GATRR on May 19 2012, a D*** Head Pilot who crashed my aircraft and killed his son, I perused [sic] him through the Courts privately and I got \u00a317000 pay off, no help from you or your company!!!\n\n(Image: Manchester Evening News)\n\n\u201cYou guys need to get real any one can insure this aircraft and anyone can fly it under club use, what D*** Head Pilot\u2019s do after they depart is down to them, not the owner, Operator, Not the club, not the CFI (Certificated Flight Instructor) and definitely not the Authorising Instructor, Insurance companies and the shambles we call the CAA (Civil Aviation Authority) need to address this instead of pointing the finger at one or two individuals.\"\n\nJudge Michael Leeming sentenced Murgatroyd to a further 22 weeks in prison, to run consecutively to his three and a half year term.\n\nThe judge told him: \"I am satisfied you were financially motivated to act in the way you did, to secure for yourself a reduced premium.\n\n\"This is a serious fraud.\n\n\"These were deliberate lies told in order to achieve a financial advantage.\"\n\nAfter the sentence, Murgatroyd asked whether he could address the court, but the Judge said he could not.", "description": "Robert Murgatroyd tried to portray himself as the \"hero of the moment\" during a police
