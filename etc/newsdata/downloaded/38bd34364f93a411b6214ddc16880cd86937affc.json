Not even close!\u201d\n\nIn suing Vance last month to block the subpoena, Trump said he was immune from criminal probes while in the White House and that the U.S. Constitution required Vance to wait until after he left office.\n\nHOUSE PROBE\n\nThe Constitution does not say whether sitting presidents can be indicted, and the Supreme Court has not decided the issue.\n\nFederal prosecutors cannot charge sitting presidents, the Department of Justice says, because presidents have temporary immunity, but that does not block state-level prosecutors like Vance or even federal prosecutors from criminal investigations.\n\nVance issued the subpoena four weeks after issuing another subpoena to the Trump Organization for records of hush money payments, including to two women prior to the 2016 election who said they had sexual relationships with Trump, which he denies.\n\nThose payments were made to Stormy Daniels, a porn star whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, and former Playboy model Karen McDougal, with the involvement of Trump\u2019s now-imprisoned former lawyer Michael Cohen.\n\nTrump is separately trying to block Deutsche Bank AG (DBKGn.DE) from handing over financial records, which the bank has said include tax returns, sought by multiple U.S. House of Representatives committees.\n\nThose probes are separate from the debate over whether Trump should be impeached because of his dealings with Ukraine.\n\nThe 2nd Circuit appeals court heard oral arguments in the Deutsche Bank case on Aug. 23. It has yet to rule.\n\nJay Sekulow, a lawyer for Trump, said he was pleased the New York subpoena would not be enforced immediately. Danny Frost, a spokesman for Vance, declined to comment. Both sides proposed schedules to allow Trump\u2019s appeal to be heard this month.\n\nMazars did not respond to requests for comment, but has said it would comply with its legal obligations. The Justice Department, which opposed dismissing Trump\u2019s challenge to the subpoena, declined to comment.\n\n\u2018OVERREACH OF EXECUTIVE POWER\u2019\n\nMarrero, who was appointed by Democratic President Bill Clinton, declined to assert jurisdiction over the Vance subpoena, saying Trump should have brought his case in a New York state court.\n\nThe judge, however, made clear that if the appeals court disagreed with that finding, Trump should lose.\n\nMarrero said Trump failed to show that enforcing the subpoena would interfere with his presidential duties, cause irreparable harm or be against the public interest.\n\nHe also rejected as too broad the idea that the president, his family and his businesses should be shielded from criminal process.\n\n\u201cThe expansive notion of constitutional immunity invoked here to shield the President from judicial process would constitute an overreach of executive power,\u201d Marrero wrote.\n\nMarrero said even President Richard Nixon had conceded during the Watergate scandal that he would be required to produce documents in response to a judicial subpoena.\n\nIn seeking a stay, Trump\u2019s lawyers said the case raised \u201cmomentous\u201d questions about the president\u2019s immunity and that complying with the subpoena would cause irreversible damage.\n\n\u201cThere will be no way to unscramble the egg scrambled by the disclosure,\u201d Trump\u2019s lawyers said.\n\nTrump is running for re-election. His current term ends on Jan. 20, 2021.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "A federal judge on Monday said U.S. President Donald Trump must hand over eight years of tax returns to Manhattan prosecutors, forcefully rejecting the president\u2019s argument that he was immune from criminal investigations.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arynews.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Trump-3-750x369.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
