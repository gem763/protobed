Even the big-stick wielders in this government won't be unsubtle enough to dub an extension of the Banking Executive Accountability Regime into super, insurers and the Australian Securities Exchange the \u201cFinancial Executive Accountability Regime\u201d.\n\nNow bureaucrats want to take the place of boards in creating incentives. Arsineh Houspian\n\nThe less draconian-sounding Financial Services Executive Accountability Regime (FSEAR) is likely to be the new tag. But the idea is the same, and it is a fundamentally bad one. Recall that BEAR can be used by APRA to run executives or board members out of the banking industry for good. Now ASIC wants to get the same powers for big non-prudentially regulated financial firms. Under BEAR, the threat of a lost career can be for things as vague as not doing enough to prevent damage to the prudential reputation of a bank. And APRA alone gets to decide whether a suspect executive has been talking to them in an \u201copen, constructive and co-operative way\u201d, which could involve intrusive levels of proof. Pay will be held back against good behaviour.\n\nMany problems identified by the Hayne royal commission were to do with a culture of indifference to customers rather than Wall Street-style recklessness driven by the prospect of higher pay. But bankers already have to obey the law, and they were reminded by commissioner Kenneth Hayne that customer interest always comes first. But the first two post-Hayne cases against IOOF and Westpac were thrown out by sceptical judges because ASIC and APRA didn\u2019t appear to know the law. Now they both want to be judge, jury and executioner of individuals in their own system of pre-emptive, prescriptive controls on internal culture.\n\nBut if you cannot successfully interpret something as relatively clear cut as the law, then how are you supposed to dictate something as abstract as culture and reputation? What happens then is that a whole raft of non-financial criteria will be adopted. In effect, bureaucrats start taking the place of boards, setting incentives based on nebulous cultural goals and against the wishes of shareholders. How does this make banking safer, more responsive to customers or prepared to take the prudent risks required to finance economic growth and prosperity?", "description": "Now regulators want to be judge, jury and executioner on individuals across all the financial industries.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.43%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/56f7021934baf703c401857392cc78fff3600c1f", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
