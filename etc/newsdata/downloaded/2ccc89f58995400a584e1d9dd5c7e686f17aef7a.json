Paul Oetken to block the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act's limit on how much people can deduct in state and local taxes (SALT). The provision effectively raised the tax burden on citizens of high-tax states.\n\nNew York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Maryland brought the suit in July 2018, claiming the tax deduction limit was a way for the Trump administration to stick it to blue states. The judge ruled that the limit did not violate the 10th Amendment, which says that powers not delegated to the federal government in the Constitution are left to the states.\n\n\"The cap, again like every other feature of the federal Tax Code, is a part of the landscape of federal law within which states make their decisions as to how they will exercise their own sovereign tax powers,\" Oetken wrote.\n\n\"Because the States have failed to plausibly allege that the cap, more so than any other major federal initiative, meaningfully constrains this decision-making process, this Court has no basis for concluding that the SALT cap is unconstitutionally coercive,\" he continued.\n\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act limited the state and local tax deduction at $10,000, which is below the average of what individuals claim in states like New York and Connecticut. Before the cap, the average deduction claimed in California, for example, was $22,000, according to Kevin de Leon, a Democratic member of the California state Senate.\n\nAs a result, wealthier taxpayers have left these states for no-income tax destinations like Florida.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nNew York had the third-largest outflows of any state, with 452,580 people moving out within the past year. California, another high-tax state, had the largest outflow of domestic residents \u2013 with the highest proportion of people headed to Texas, Arizona and Washington.\n\nNew York's government estimated in February that tax payments were $2.3 billion below forecasts.\n\nFOX Business' Brittany De Lea contributed to this report.", "description": "The lawsuit asked U.S. District Judge J.
