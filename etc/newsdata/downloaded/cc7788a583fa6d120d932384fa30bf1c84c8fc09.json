USA TODAY\n\nShea Patterson slipped into the background, content to be the supporting actor on this night. He was upstaged by the five large men crouched before him. They go by the names Mayfield, Onwenu, Ruiz, Bredeson and Runyan.\n\nFor more than three hours Saturday, they were the star attractions, keeping a soggy but boisterous crowd at Michigan Stadium in their seats and cheering until the final whistle.\n\nThroughout No. 20 Michigan's 45-14 rout of No. 7 Notre Dame, they supplied the horsepower for the Wolverines' offense.\n\nThey opened gaping holes, freeing Michigan\u2019s stable of running backs to rip through Notre Dame\u2019s front.\n\nMichigan Wolverines running back Zach Charbonnet celebrates his touchdown with lineman Jon Runyan Jr. against Notre Dame during the first half Saturday, Oct. 26, 2019 at Michigan Stadium in Ann Arbor.

They conquered.\n\nBy the end, Notre Dame had been obliterated, reduced to bits by the Michigan\u2019s five-man sledgehammer.\n\nFor those who prefer their Michigan football simple and direct, this brute display of force was a thing of a beauty.\n\nForget Josh Gattis\u2019 speed in space. The style of offense Saturday was smash-their-face, brought to Brian Kelly\u2019s unsuspecting Notre Dame squad by Michigan\u2019s line coach, Ed Warinner.\n\nJim Harbaugh's 50-something assistant orchestrated a plan that allowed the Wolverines to overcome the one-loss Fighting Irish and undefeated Mother Nature as they rolled their way to 303 rushing yards.\n\nPatterson, the Wolverines' senior quarterback, didn\u2019t complete a pass until early in the second quarter and instead spent the bulk of his time behind center sticking the ball into the gut of the running back lined up beside him. His right arm, on this night, was not really needed.\n\nBy the time he connected with Mike Sainristil for a 13-yard gain that represented the first successful play through the air, the Wolverines had already built a ten-point lead. It would grow soon thereafter, when Patterson scampered 22 yards to the edge of Notre Dame\u2019s end zone and Zach Charbonnet busted through a crowd of bodies as he crossed the goal line.\n\nRight tackle Jalen Mayfield exulted and the Michigan crowd roared, thrilled their team was now ahead, 17-0, as halftime loomed in the distance.\n\nThe team that a week before fell three yards short of the end zone in a crushing loss to Penn State found no distance too great to cover.\n\nSeven days after a pass from Patterson slipped through the hands of receiver Ronnie Bell during that defeat's deflating denouement, Michigan showed little interest throwing the ball in any region of the field, at any time during the first 40 minutes of its slugfest with Notre Dame.\n\nTwenty of Michigan\u2019s first 22 plays were runs, as Charbonnet and Hassan Haskins took turns working over Notre Dame\u2019s defense.\n\nThe approach, as unbalanced as it was, was sound considering the weather conditions. An 18-mph wind whipped through the stadium as rain soaked the field \u2013 conditions that were all but certain to short-circuit the passing offenses attached to Michigan and Notre Dame.\n\nBut whereas Michigan adjusted, Notre Dame didn\u2019t. It stubbornly leaned on quarterback Ian Book, who threw the ball on 13 of the Fighting Irish\u2019s 28 plays in the first half and produced only 32 yards through the air during that stretch.\n\nMichigan\u2019s defense, of course, did its part to sully Book\u2019s stat line by consistently invading his pocket and pushing him off his mark.\n\nIt was another example of the Wolverines controlling the line of scrimmage and exerting their dominance.\n\nBut it was on offense where Michigan showed its true might.\n\nThe rushing attack splintered Notre Dame before Patterson broke the Fighting Irish in two when he completed a pair of touchdown passes to Donovan People-Jones and Nico Collins within a seven-minute span that bled from the third quarter into the fourth. After the throw to Collins, Patterson leapt into the arms of one of Michigan's linemen.\n\nWas it Mayfield, Onwenu, Ruiz, Bredeson or Runyan? It didn't really matter because they each earned top billing on a night when Michigan demolishe Notre Dame under the lights.", "description": "Michigan entered its game against No. 7 Notre Dame with one top 10 win under Jim Harbaugh, but the Wolverines dominated with their offensive line.", "authors": ["Rainer Sabin", "Published P.M.
