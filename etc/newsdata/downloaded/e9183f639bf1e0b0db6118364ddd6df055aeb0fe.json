He replied: \u201cWe\u2019re having it in a little while.\u201d He did not appear to hear when a reporter told him it had just taken place.\n\nThe French president, Emmanuel Macron, confirmed Trump had not personally attended the climate session but that Trump\u2019s team had been present.\n\nHe said he had held long and in-depth talks with Trump on the Amazon fires and that the US president \u201cshares our objectives\u201d and was \u201cfully engaged\u201d in the joint G7 effort to help Brazil put out the fires and reforest.\n\nMacron had placed the climate emergency and protection of biodiversity at the heart of the summit, even before the Amazon rainforest fires.\n\nBut just before the session began on Saturday, it appeared that Trump\u2019s entourage felt discussing climate was of little importance, compared with the economy. Reports in the US said senior Trump aides felt Macron was seeking to embarrass his US counterpart by making the summit focus on \u201cniche issues\u201d such as climate change or gender equality.\n\nIn 2017, Trump pulled the US out of the Paris climate accord.\n\nMacron announced that the G7 had agreed to an immediate fund of at least $20m (\u00a316m) to help Amazon countries fight wildfires and launch a long-term global initiative to protect the rainforest.\n\nHe said the Amazon was the \u201clungs\u201d of the planet and leaders were studying the possibility of similar support in Africa, also suffering from fires in its rainforests.\n\nAll G7 countries \u2013 the US, Japan, Germany, France, Italy, Britain and Canada \u2013 would give technical and financial help to fight the Amazon fires.\n\nMacron had shunted the Amazon fires to the top of the summit agenda after declaring them a global emergency, and kicked off discussions about the disaster at a welcome dinner for fellow leaders on Saturday.", "description": "US president misses key G7 meeting as summit agrees \u20ac20m fund to fight wildfires", "authors": ["Angelique Chrisafis", "John Crace", "Simon Tisdall"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d3bb98b144dd069a1257e02282093cfde80fc99/0_91_971_583/master/971.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4fb5b6390395a565ba1823178e7034ae", "published_at": "2019-08-26"}
