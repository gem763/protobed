About an hour later, Birmingham's NOAA office tweeted \"Alabama will NOT see any impacts from #Dorian,\" emphasising that it the storm would remain too far east to affect the state. This was correct.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

It was still not hit.\n\nAccording to three people who spoke with the Times, Mr Ross threatened high level employees on Friday, two days after the president displayed the altered hurricane map, which the president has denied defacing himself.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. \"Huge damage\" as record Hurricane Dorian hits Bahamas: In pictures Show all 15 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

Mr Ross was on vacation in Greece at the time.\n\nWhen Dr Jacobs objected, he was told that the staff appointed by the administration at NOAA, or the political staff, would be fired if a vindication of the president's lie was not made.\n\nThe president has been focused on the Alabama tweets since he was rebuked. On Tuesday, his daughter Ivanka will travel to Alabama for an announcement. Dr Jacobs is scheduled to speak in the state on the same day, some twenty miles away from Ms Trump, at a weather industry conference.", "description": "Wilbur Ross, the US secretary of commerce,\u00a0threatened to fire top employees at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration after\u00a0the agency\u2019s Birmingham, Alabama office contradicted Donald Trump's tweet claiming that Hurricane Dorian would likely\u00a0hit Alabama, according to", "authors": ["Lily Puckett"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/09/21/gettyimages-1172289651-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
