Like awful. But finally a TD! #UFCSingapore \u2014 Aljamain Sterling (@funkmasterMMA) October 26, 2019\n\nAskren's longest fight in the UFC. \u2014 Jed I.

Hold me, Jesus. \u2014 Luke Thomas (@lthomasnews) October 26, 2019\n\nMaia is slowing down, Ben can scramble all day.

Maia with the 1 handed RNC\ud83e\udd2f Surprised Askren wanted to go for the takedown when he was actually winning the striking exchanges and considering how dangerous Maia is.
