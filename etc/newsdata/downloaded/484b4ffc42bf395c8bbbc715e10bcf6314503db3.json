It would increase the GDP, to sound like a wonk here, by about eight-tenths of one percent. It would grow the economy.\"\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census, there are 330 million people living in the country.\n\nBIDEN'S GAFFES, STUMBLES, AND FITNESS TO LEAD FOR OFFICE UNDER FIRE IN NEW TRUMP CAMPAIGN VIDEO\n\nBiden's gaffes have recently been targeted by the Trump campaign in a new video questioning his fitness to lead.\n\nThe web video, tweeted Tuesday morning by campaign manager Brad Parscale and shared first with Fox News, stitches together everything from his recent debate-stage musing about \"record players\" to his statement that \"poor kids\" are just as talented as \"white kids.\" Interspersed with the clips of the 76-year-old Biden's comments are those of pundits wondering about his stumbles, shakiness, mental and physical stamina, whether he\u2019s \u201clost a step\u201d and whether he\u2019s \u201cequipped for a very grueling campaign.\u201d\n\nThe former vice president\u2019s age and mental acuity have been questioned ever since he launched his 2020 presidential campaign in late April. Last week, the front-runner in the Democratic nomination race faced repeated attacks from rivals over his memory.\n\nFormer Housing Secretary Julian Castro, who served in the Obama administration with Biden, landed arguably the lowest blow when he swiped at Biden\u2019s memory -- accusing him of contradicting himself on whether Americans would have to buy into his health care plan.\n\n\"You just said two minutes ago they would have to buy in. Are you forgetting what you said two minutes ago?\" Castro asked, in what appeared to be a reference to past senior moments by Biden.\n\nIn that case, as the Biden campaign later noted, Castro was wrong. Biden did not say during the debate that individuals would have to buy in. Instead, he said that individuals would automatically be enrolled if they lost their jobs.\n\nBut Biden has drawn criticism for other stumbles. And another rival, Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, backed Castro after the debate and raised further questions about Biden\u2019s ability to carry the banner for the Democrats into 2020.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"I think we are at a tough point right now, because there\u2019s a lot of people concerned about Joe Biden\u2019s ability to carry the ball all the way across the end line without fumbling,\" Booker told CNN in an interview. \"And I think that Castro had really legitimate concerns about can he be someone in a long grueling campaign\u2026 and has every right to call out.\"\n\nA clip of that Booker interview appears in the Trump campaign video.\n\nFox News' Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.", "description": "Former Vice President Joe Biden made another blunder on Tuesday, this time for suggesting that his child tax credit plan will put \"720 million women\" back into the workforce.", "authors": ["Joseph Wulfsohn", "Joseph A.
