Then the plant was to shift its equipment to the new version.\n\nTicker Security Last Change Change % GM GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY 33.88 -0.87 -2.50% FCAU FIAT CHRYSLER AUTOMOBILES N.V. 12.27 -0.16 -1.29% F FORD MOTOR COMPANY 8.54 -0.14 -1.61%\n\nNow, Rinna wrote, GM will either have to delay the new car's launch or retool the plant faster.\n\nGM made a confidential offer to the UAW on Monday morning, but the two sides have yet to reach an agreement.\n\nPart of the holdup is GM's desire to transition away from traditional products to electric and autonomous vehicles, which clashes with the union's desire to maintain the status quo and job security.\n\nThe United Auto Workers were frustrated by GM's idling of plants in the Midwest even before negotiations began, and the two sides are at odds over pay and healthcare benefits.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Dealers still have enough inventory to get by for several more weeks.", "authors": ["Evie Fordham"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/chevrolet-dealership-iStock.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
