It said sales in September were adversely affected by unusually warm weather, while it saw a significant improvement in October when temperatures fell.\n\n\u201cWe believe the improved sales growth in October recouped some of the lost sales in September and we do not expect sales growth for the rest of the year to be as strong as October,\u201d it added.", "description": "British clothing retailer Next kept its profit guidance for the full 2019-20 year on Wednesday, as it reported third quarter sales growth slightly ahead of guidance given in September.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446442507&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9T0E6", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
