That\u2019s why I prefer to say that we are much more than timekeepers, we are time tellers.\u201d\n\nThe unique three-dimensional time display uses the brand\u2019s trademark capillary system filled with colored liquids to indicate the hours.\n\nIn the H5, a tiny tube wraps around the top of the massive sapphire crystal dome, which evokes a bell jar in a science lab. The tube holds two liquids, one black (or green) and one clear. The colored liquid is continually pumped through the tube around the dial to indicate the hour, while minutes appear on a sub-dial at 12 o\u2019clock, and seconds on a sub-dial at 10 o\u2019clock. There is also a power reserve display at 2 o\u2019clock.\n\nThe system divides the day into two 12-hour segments. Starting from the arrow on the left side of the HYT logo at the 6 o\u2019clock position, the colored liquid advances with the hours around the perimeter as your day progresses from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. Its position correlates to the hour numbers around the flange of the crystal dome.\n\nThe new Calibre 501 movement. HYT\n\nWhen the colored liquid reaches 6 p.m. to the right of the HYT logo at the bottom, it drains back into a reservoir, or bellows, over the course of a minute to start tracking the hours for the second half of the day.\n\nDuring the rewind process, the mechanical movement continues to beat and keep time so accuracy is assured. And each time the liquid returns to the bellows it is remixed, so it is ever-changing in molecular structure.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to rethink and propose a new way to tell the time,\u201d Dourde says. \u201cPeople\u2019s perception of time is that there is the future, which becomes the present, as the present becomes the past. It\u2019s an unstoppable flow.\u201d\n\nIn other words, the colored liquid represents time that has passed and the clear liquid represents time in the future, while the point where they meet is the present\u2014or the current time.\n\nThe new Calibre 501 movement is the brainchild of a collaboration with TEC Group and visionary watchmaker Eric Coudray. \u201cIt basically integrates all the components that have been developed in order to synchronize the best of the two universes,\u201d Dourde says, referring to the hydro and mechanical aspects of the system. \u201cWe wanted to create a new horology that not only mixes, but marries them.\u201d\n\nOn the back of the movement, he explains, there is a large cam and lever, and these two components are oversized and enhanced because they are essential to unifying the two mechanisms into one.\n\nThe black fluid model. HYT\n\nThe elaborate cam works to precisely synchronize the minutes display with the liquid hour indicator. The mechanical movement operates a device that moves the liquid, a process that requires remarkable precision and perfect integration since an advance of one minute requires a move of only 1.5 microns in the movement.\n\nThe cam has 13 settings that allow a watchmaker to adjust it very precisely to sync the time determined by the mechanism and the time displayed by the liquid.\n\nThe H5 is available in two versions, each limited to 25 pieces. The black fluid model is paired with a black perforated rubber strap, and the green fluid model is fitted with a gray strap.\n\nAt night, the version with the black liquid is visually enhanced by a channel filled with luminous green Super-LumiNova underneath the capillary. In addition, the carved-out numbers on the resin-like neoralite flange are filled with glowing Super-LumiNova, lighting up the entire dome after dark.", "description": "The $55,000 watch is available in two versions, each limited to 25 pieces", "authors": ["Laurie Kahle"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-119957/social", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
