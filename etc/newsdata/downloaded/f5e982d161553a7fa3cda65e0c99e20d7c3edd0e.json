The founder, Alex Jones, was one of the people banned by Facebook Friday, along with his website, Watson, alt-right speakers Milo Yiannopoulos and Laura Loomer, and anti-Semite Louis Farrakhan.\n\nFacebook's decision to remove the accounts is powerful, as deplatforming has been an effective measure in reducing the exposure and spread of misinformation. Yiannopoulos has gone into millions of dollars worth of debt and canceled several speaking tours after his removal from several platforms.\n\nTwitter, which has been applauded for its ability to remove propaganda from ISIS quickly and effectively, has struggled to do the same with white nationalist content. A recent report from Motherboard read that Twitter's struggles in doing so are tied to the fact that an all-out ban of white nationalist content like it does for ISIS posts and videos would result in the suspension and deletion of Republican politicians' accounts.", "description": "President Donald Trump retweeted several far-right personalities Saturday morning, including a Canadian activist who wrote a book titled \"Barbarians: How Baby Boomers, Immigrants, and Islam Screwed My Generation.\"", "authors": ["Bradley Saacks"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5ca01f3d569b55658d7b3b52?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-05-04"}
