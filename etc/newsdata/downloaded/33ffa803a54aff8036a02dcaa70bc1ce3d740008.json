Both sides had chances to win it, with Gareth Bale hitting the bar for Wales just before Moore's goal, and Robert Mak three times coming close for the home side.\n\nWales coach Giggs said: 'Kieffer was a handful all night. He occupies centre-halves and gives us an option. He took a few knocks tonight. We could have won, we could have lost, but overall I'm happy with the draw.'\n\nRyan Giggs hailed Kieffer Moore after the former lifeguard kept Wales' Euro 2020 hopes alive\n\nWales are three points behind Slovakia in their qualifying group, with a game in hand. They face group leaders Croatia in Cardiff on Sunday.\n\nGiggs' team need to finish in the top two to qualify automatically for the Finals, though their second-placed finish in Nations League Group B could also be enough to secure a play-off in the spring.\n\nWales now have a better head-to-head record than Slovakia thanks to their 1-0 win at home earlier this year.\n\nMoore gave Wales the lead in the first half, only for Juraj Kucka to equalise soon after the break\n\nGiggs added: 'We have a better head to head than Slovakia but you still have to capitalise on that. It could have gone either way but we probably created the better chances.'\n\nMoore, who worked as a part-time lifesaver earlier in his career, was contracted to Forest Green Rovers, then in the National League, when Wales made their famous run to the Euro 2016 semi-finals. But he never looked out of his depth here.\n\nBale stayed down for a lengthy spell towards the end of the game after tangling with Milan Skriniar but Giggs is confident he will be fit to face Croatia.", "description": "TOM COLLOMOSSE IN TRNAVA: Ryan Giggs hailed Kieffer Moore after the former lifeguard kept Wales' Euro 2020 qualifying hopes alive with a goal on his competitive debut.", "authors": ["Tom Collomosse For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/22/19561316-0-image-a-75_1570744760117.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
