For the uninformed, this fun little Excel command allows you to extract a value based on the position of another value. So, for example, suppose you had a spreadsheet that looked like this:\n\nIf you run a vlookup, then you can tell the cell (f5) to look for a value in a column (let\u2019s say, \u201cbus\u201d), and then return a value from another column in the same row (green). Hlookup functions the same way, just reverse the row/column designations: you\u2019re looking up a value in a row and then returning a value from another row further down.\n\nAnd now we arrive at xlookup, the \u201csuccessor to the iconic vlookup function,\u201d as Microsoft\u2019s Joe McDaid describes. Here\u2019s how it works:\n\nXLOOKUP is named for its ability to look both vertically and horizontally (yes it replaces HLOOKUP too!). In its simplest form, XLOOKUP needs just 3 arguments to perform the most common exact lookup (one fewer than VLOOKUP). Let\u2019s consider its signature in the simplest form: XLOOKUP(lookup_value,lookup_array,return_array) lookup_value: What you are looking for lookup_array: Where to find it return_array: What to return\n\nSo, back to my example, if you wanted to find what colour is associated with the word \u201chouse\u201d and extract that information into a cell, you\u2019d simply have to type in:\n\nxlookup(\u201chouse\u201d,a:a,d:d)\n\nEasy.\n\nXlookup, in addition to being a shorter command to have to mess with than vlookup, also gives you access to a feature astute vlookup\u2019ers have dreamed about for years: reverse searches. In other words, you can now also pull in value that are left of an anchor point, rather than the default right. It\u2019s practically magic.\n\nUnfortunately, not everyone is going to get to play with xlookup today. Microsoft is rolling out the function to Office 365 Insiders first. So, you better get in the beta if you want to master xlookup before everyone else.", "description": "I still remember the first day I figured out how to run a vlookup command in Excel; I was sitting at my coffee table wondering what the point of this silly little command was.
