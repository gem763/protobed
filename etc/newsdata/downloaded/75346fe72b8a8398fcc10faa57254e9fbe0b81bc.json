But it lagged rivals facing similar headwinds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCredit Suisse on Wednesday reported a rise in third-quarter earnings buoyed by higher revenue in markets and international wealth management. Standard Chartered's profits rose 16 per cent helped by rising income from corporate and private banking clients.\n\nRevenue at Deutsche's cash-cow bond-trading division fell 13 per cent, highlighting continued weakness at its investment bank.\n\nUS banks' fixed income revenues rose 10 per cent in the third quarter, according to Goldman Sachs.\n\nCitigroup said that Deutsche's weak revenue in the quarter would be likely to result in a downgrade in analysts' profit forecasts.\n\nDeutsche, founded in 1870, is considered one of the global financial system's most important banks, along with JPMorgan , Bank of America and Citigroup.\n\nBut after a string losses and scandals, Deutsche is going through one of the biggest overhauls to an investment bank since the aftermath of the financial crisis.\n\nOut of a planned 18,000 job cuts, Deutsche eliminated 1500 in the third quarter, though the number of employees in its investment bank rose as an intake of new graduates offset staff cuts in equity trading.\n\nThe bank said revenue at its private bank, which focuses on retail clients and Germany and is the bank's largest division, would be \"slightly lower\" in 2019, due to lower interest rates. That is a downgrade from earlier expectations for little change from 2018.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDeutsche highlighted some progress in winding down \u20ac74 billion of risk-weighted assets, a pillar of its restructuring plan.\n\nDeutsche financial chief James Von Moltke said the bank had auctioned off three books of less complex equities derivatives, which was \"quite successful\".\n\nThe focus will now turn to more complex derivatives, which will take place slowly over coming years, he said.\n\nReuters", "description": "The bank earlier flagged it would make a loss this year and announced restructuring plans worth billions of dollars including the elimination of 18,000 jobs.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/b4373cac7f25fe565985939042aac9529b544bb2", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
