Everyone in politics flocked to social media to acknowledge the terrorist's death. Rep. Omar was a little slow to respond to the news, only doing so after many people called her out on Twitter.\n\nBut on Instagram, she did manage to post a photo of herself in a CAIR t-shirt right away. CAIR, the Council on Islamic Relations, has supported terrorist groups like Hamas and continues to discourage Muslim-Americans from assisting the FBI in counter-terrorism efforts.\n\nSebastian Gorka, the host of \"America First\" on Salem Radio, brought up an important point about Omar's tweet:\n\nWhy oh why would @IlhanMN post this picture THIS morning after the announcement that we killed Baghdadi, wearing a shirt from @CAIRNational, the un-indicted co-conspirator in the largest terrorism financing trial in US history??https://t.co/3j7g2LPy3s pic.twitter.com/N61kihOWM0 \u2014 Sebastian Gorka DrG (@SebGorka) October 27, 2019\n\nGorka was referring to the Holy Land case, in which CAIR founder Omar Ahmad was implicated.\n\nBefore caving in and acknowledging the ISIS leader's death, Omar was quick to respond to the killing of two other people last night. Not the children of the terrorist, who the ISIS leader murdered by detonating a suicide vest, but two people killed at a homecoming party in Texas. Omar blamed Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for their deaths because the senator did not pass gun control legislation that would have done nothing to stop it anyway.\n\nLast night, two people were shot to death at a homecoming party in Texas.\n\n\n\nAs Mitch McConnell lets the House\u2019s gun legislation die outside his door, innocent people are dying, too.\n\n\n\nHe must bring this legislation to the Senate floor. Before we see more senseless deaths. https://t.co/IxlSQoWkYb \u2014 Ilhan Omar (@IlhanMN) October 27, 2019\n\nTo be fair, the terror-sympathizer and anti-Semitic congresswoman did finally post about al Baghdadi's death:\n\nAbu Bakr al Baghdadi was an evil man and a terrorist, who terrorized the world with violence and a message of hate.\n\n\n\nThe world is a safer place without him.\n\n\n\nWe have deep gratitude for the brave men and women who carried out this dangerous operation. \u2014 Ilhan Omar (@IlhanMN) October 27, 2019\n\nShe then immediately denounced the \"hateful ideology of white nationalism,\" in reference to the Tree of Life Synagogue shooting that happened a year ago today.", "description": "The news cycle has been inundated with coverage of ISIS leader al-Baghdadi's killing by U.S. forces in a top-secret raid..10/27/2019 20:22:48PM EST.", "authors": ["Bronson Stocking", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/46/cd0e24e1-ecb2-4649-ba32-601eb2239fca.png", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
