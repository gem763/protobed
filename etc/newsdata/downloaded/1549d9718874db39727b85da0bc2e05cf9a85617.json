REUTERS/Amit Dave/File photo\n\nSINGAPORE (Reuters) - India\u2019s overall fuel demand will rise by more than 4% a year to 2030 as the country\u2019s improved road transport network stokes demand for gasoil, the head of oil and gas group Nayara Energy said on Tuesday.\n\nChief executive B. Anand said he expects India\u2019s fuel demand to grow 4.7% a year to 5.5 million barrels per day (bpd) through fiscal year 2025, and then 4% per year to 6.6 million bpd through 2030.\n\nDemand for gasoil will rise by an average 5.3% per year through the 2025 fiscal year and by an average 4.5% through 2030, he told the Asia Pacific Petroleum Conference in Singapore.\n\nIndia would continue to rely mainly on road transport to move freight around the country, while the number of passenger cars would steadily increase in coming years with rising vehicle ownership, Anand said.\n\nGasoline and gasoil will continue to benefit from rising car sales and a stronger manufacturing industry, but faster than expected penetration of electric vehicles could pose a risk to demand growth, he added.\n\nWhile the share of renewables, including solar, wind and natural gas, was likely to increase in the next 10 years, absolute oil demand would still rise strongly over the next decade, he said.\n\nNayara, which operates a 400,000-bpd refinery in western India, is capable of producing new low-sulphur specifications for marine fuels starting in 2020, Anand said.\n\nThe refiner, which procures 85% of its crude requirement from international markets, usually looks for so-called heavy crude oil grades from Europe, West Africa, Latin America and also Canada.\n\nNayara, however, hasn\u2019t yet sourced any of its crude oil from the United States, Anand said, \u201cFor us, it has to be the economics that has to be right.\u201d", "description": "India's overall fuel demand will rise by more than 4% a year to 2030 as the country's improved road transport network stokes demand for gasoil, the head of oil and gas group Nayara Energy said on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Nidhi Verma", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190910&t=2&i=1428241571&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF890AH", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
