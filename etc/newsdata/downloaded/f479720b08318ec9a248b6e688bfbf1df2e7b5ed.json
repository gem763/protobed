This is being offset by weakening business sentiment and capital expenditures mostly driven by increasingly complex geopolitical risks, including tensions in global trade,\u201d said CEO Jamie Dimon.\n\nThe stock, traded on the New York Stock Exchange, jumped more than 3.6% from Monday\u2019s close to trade north of $120.70 per share.\n\nJPMorgan maintained its No. 1 spot for global investment banking fees, with 9.3% of the wallet share this year. Dimon noted that the firm had a record quarter for investment banking fees with \"particularly strong performance in [Debt Capital Markets] and [Equity Capital Markets].\" Banking revenue for the quarter was $3.3 billion, up 2% from the same quarter a year ago. Investment banking revenue was $1.9%, up 8% on higher underwriting fees.\n\nIMAGE DISTRIBUTED FOR JPMORGAN CHASE & CO- Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase, speaks at the Chase NYC Flagship, Tuesday, June 25, 2019 in New York.

Fixed income revenue rebounded 25% to come in at $3.6 billion, \"driven by strong client activity across products.\" Equity markets revenue slipped 5% to $1.5 billion \"reflecting lower revenues in derivatives.\"\n\nElsewhere, in the consumer and community bank, credit card sales volume rose 10% in the quarter, while merchant processing jumped 11%.\n\nJPMorgan kicked earnings season off for the big financials. Goldman Sachs (GS), Wells Fargo (WFC), and Citigroup (C) reported results on Tuesday. Bank of America (BAC) will report on Wednesday and Morgan Stanley (MS) on Thursday.\n\n\u2014\n\nJulia La Roche is a finance reporter at Yahoo Finance.
