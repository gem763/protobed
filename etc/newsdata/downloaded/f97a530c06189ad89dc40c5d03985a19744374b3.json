It just took a lot of time and growth to get to that place.\u201d\n\nHe said \u201cBlurred Lines,\u201d in particular, \u201copened me up.\u201d And it started with the way the song was deemed misogynistic by some.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t get it at first. Because there were older white women who, when that song came on, they would behave in some of the most surprising ways ever. And I would be like, wow,\u201d Pharrell explained. \u201cThey would have me blushing. So when there started to be an issue with it, lyrically, I was like, \u2018What are you talking about?\u2019 There are women who really like the song and connect to the energy that just gets you up. And I know you want it \u2014 women sing those kinds of lyrics all the time. So it\u2019s like, what\u2019s rapey about that?\u201d\n\nPharrell Williams performs during the 2019 Essence Festival on July 7 at the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans.

While Pharrell didn\u2019t agree at first, his thinking evolved. \u201cI realized that there are men who use that same language when taking advantage of a woman, and it doesn\u2019t matter that that\u2019s not my behavior. Or the way I think about things,\u201d Pharrell said. \u201cIt just matters how it affects women. And I was like, \u2018Got it. I get it. Cool.\u2019 My mind opened up to what was actually being said in the song and how it could make someone feel. Even though it wasn\u2019t the majority, it didn\u2019t matter. I cared what they were feeling, too. I realized that we live in a chauvinist culture in our country. Hadn\u2019t realized that. Didn\u2019t realize that some of my songs catered to that. So that blew my mind.\u201d\n\nPharrell earlier defended the song in a 2014 interview with Pitchfork, insisting that the song was about women claiming their independence. \u201cWhat I was trying to say was: \u2018That man is trying to domesticate you, but you don\u2019t need no papers \u2014 let me liberate you.\u201d\n\nSix years after \u201cBlurred Lines\u201d was released, Pharrell is the face of the \u201cNow Is Her Time\u201d campaign for Adidas. He reiterated something he\u2019s said before, that he believes now is the time for women to lead.\n\n\u201cMan, what would the world be like if women held all of the highest positions worldwide?\u201d Pharrell said. \u201cWomen are waking up every day, more and more, to the fact that they have the power. Women, millennials, and the Gen-Zers have the power. And there are a lot of men who recognize their privilege, and they use it for good. We\u2019re such a capable species. We have the ability if we can just galvanize for good. The only thing we got to do is balance the scales. We have to understand power. And who has it.\u201d\n\nRead more from Yahoo Entertainment:\n\nWant daily pop culture news delivered to your inbox?
