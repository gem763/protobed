It\u2019s one of those sales that truly gives everyone and anyone options to choose from. Get up to 60% off top brands like Levi\u2019s, Madewell, PAIGE, AG, and more.\n\nA personal favorite of mine, the Levi\u2019s Wedgie Straight Crop Released Hem Jeans are down to $40 during the sale. These jeans give you the perfect shape, dark denim, and a released hem detail to give any outfit a little edge. Or go for the KUT from the Kloth Boyfriend Jeans that are made of a great cotton/polyester/rayon/spandex blend to give you the right amount of structure but with some stretch. They\u2019re on sale for $30. Guys can grab the Joe\u2019s Jeans Athletic Faded Slim Fit Jeans for $60. These have the right amount of fade and whiskering to feel like you\u2019ve already lived in them, even if you just put them on. This sale has denim for everyone, so if you\u2019re in need of jeans, this is your one-stop-shop. | Shop at Nordstrom Rack >\n\nScouted is internet shopping with a pulse.
