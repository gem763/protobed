I came to that school, I\u2019m a kid from the city of Pittsburgh. I\u2019m a Pittsburgh born-and-bred dude. That\u2019s city, that\u2019s urban. You come to this school and, now you\u2019re not allowed to wear earrings, you\u2019re not allowed to have facial hair.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThe ideology of, if it doesn\u2019t fit the mold of what it is that is acceptable, then it\u2019s disgusting. Then it is inappropriate. It is incorrect, it\u2019s not right. The reason why it\u2019s been so embraced and became such a fabric of Penn State is because of the type of success Penn Staters have been able to have outside of the game of football.\u201d\n\nArrington suggested that the new regime run by James Franklin creates a divide with fans who grew up watching Paterno\u2019s teams on the field.\n\n\u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing here is a disconnect,\u201d Arrington said. \u201cThose kids, young men, who saw the letter and were offended by the letter \u2014 which they should\u2019ve been offended by the letter \u2014 they know nothing about Joe Paterno. Joe Paterno\u2019s been gone. They may know some of the things that happened in that past, but they\u2019re not connected to that past. The coach is not connected to that past.\u201d\n\nPENN STATE'S JONATHAN SUTHERLAND RECEIVES LETTER FROM 'ALUMNI' LAMBASTING HIM OVER HAIRSTYLE\n\nThe letter criticized Sutherland's dreadlocks and yearned for years past when players didn\u2019t have \u201cdisgusting tattoos, awful hair and immature antics in the end zone.\u201d\n\nSutherland commented on the letter.\n\n\u201cAlthough the message was indeed rude, ignorant, and judging, I've taken no personal offense to it because personally, I must respect (him) as a person before I respect your opinion,\u201d Sutherland wrote in a statement posted onto his Twitter account. \u201cAt the end of the day, without an apology needed, I forgive this individual because I'm nowhere close to being perfect and I expect God to forgive me for all the wrong I've done in my life.\u201d\n\nDave Peterson, who signed the letter, told the Tribune-Democrat that he didn\u2019t intend his letter to be a cultural or racial statement.\n\nSutherland\u2019s teammates Antonio Shelton and C.J. Holmes denounced the letter on Twitter on Tuesday.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nPenn State is 5-0 this season and is set to take on Iowa on Saturday.", "description": "Former Penn State football star LaVar Arrington addressed a letter an alumnus of the school wrote to a current player objecting to his dreadlocks.", "authors": ["Ryan Gaydos", "Ryan Gaydos Is A Sports Reporter For Foxnews.Com", "Foxbusiness.Com.
