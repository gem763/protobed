As a result, Uhana was labelled as being a great fit for the firm's future aspirations in this area.\n\n\"Our discussions around incorporating Cellwize's technology into VMware Smart Assurance have the potential to further extend these capabilities for our customers,\" Ayyar continued.\n\nAt MWC in Los Angeles, VMware displayed a solution preview, which highlighted Cellwize RAN automation and orchestration technology with VMware Smart Assurance.\n\nThe announcement follows VMware in August making its presence known in the telecommunications world, unveiling an expanded Telco and Edge Cloud portfolio that it said will drive real-time intelligence for telco networks, as well as improve automation and security for telco, edge, and IoT applications.\n\nVMware is already serving as an infrastructure provider for most communications service providers, and according to Rajiv Ramaswami, VMware COO of Products and Cloud Services, the telco space is a huge opportunity for the company.\n\n\"There's a big trigger happening in telcos which is they're at the early stages of deploying 5G, which is a massive capex investment that comes about every generation, every seven-eight years ... like the previous generation of 4G with LTE,\" Ramaswami told media during VMworld in San Francisco at the time.\n\n\"Now, as they do this, they're also looking to modernise their infrastructure, and go with a much more virtualised platform that they can run their virtual network functions on, as opposed to going and building dedicated boxes, like they have done in the past, for every application that they need to run.\n\n\"So this is obviously a huge opportunity.\"\n\nVMware also used MWC to touch on its partnership with Swedish equipment manufacturer Ericsson that was announced in February at MWC in Barcelona.\n\nThe companies had the goal of enabling CSPs to deploy and operate virtualised networks, with VMware at the time investing in a certification lab where Ericsson's VNFs running on VMware vCloud NFV were put through testing.\n\nVMware said over 50 CSPs worldwide are running 567 VNF deployments on its platform, and over 70 CSPs using Ericsson's Business Support Systems (BSS) are also running on VMware.\n\nAlso at MWC LA, Nvidia unveiled its Nvidia EGX Edge Supercomputing Platform, which the company touted would act as a high-performance, cloud-native platform to make use of the increasing amount of data that is being gathered by organisations.\n\nIt also made a handful of announcements centred on its move into 5G, partnering with Ericsson, Red Hat, and Microsoft, with a spotlight on the telecommunications industry.\n\nSimilarly to VMware, Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang announced during his keynote that Nvidia and Ericsson had been \"secretly\" working together on technologies to allow telco operators to build high-performing, efficient, and completely virtualised 5G RAN.\n\nRELATED COVERAGE", "description": "The company said it will allow CSPs to have a holistic view of the network from core to the edge, to the radio access network.", "authors": ["Asha Barbaschow"], "top_image": "https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/08/23/d049a015-a087-44ef-84d2-e54b2c0171ca/thumbnail/770x578/19bb28f388b237ad9e09585eca6e5c17/istock-474325206.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
