Pictured right: Brigadier Christopher Coles\n\nMr Hoole, pictured with his long-term girlfriend Rachael McKie, was described as 'determined'\n\nAt a 2015 inquest into the SAS selection march deaths, Birmingham coroner Louise Hunt concluded there had been a lack of awareness about key health and safety documents, including one called JSP 539.\n\nHighlighting the Army's 'continuing' failure in that field, at Cpl Hoole's inquest today, she said: 'There was a very serious failure on the part of the Army to ensure the Rifles' training team were familiar with improvements in JSP 539 and how they applied to the AFT.'\n\nShe added: 'There was a report to prevent future deaths issued in July 2015 following inquests which specifically raised concerns about lack of awareness of JSP 539.\n\n'I consider the continuing lack of awareness and failure to follow up to be a very serious failing which directly impacted on the safety of the AFT.\n\n'The failure of the Army to learn from previous mistakes is a very concerning matter for me.'\n\nCpl Hoole, pictured with Miss McKie, collapsed near the end of the 'eight-miler' loaded march\n\nCpl Hoole's father Phillip Hoole (pictured on October 1), who successfully applied to have the hearing resumed\n\nA 2017 Defence Safety Authority report concluded Cpl Hoole died as a result of an undiagnosed underlying medical condition, 'within the definition of sudden arrhythmogenic death syndrome' and 'did not die as a direct result of doing the annual fitness test'.\n\nBut that conclusion was rejected by Mr Hoole's father Phillip, who successfully applied to Ms Hunt for the inquest to resume.\n\nCpl Hoole collapsed at 8.52am near the end of the 'eight-miler' loaded march over hilly ground, having earlier been described as 'panting' and 'staggering'.\n\nEarlier on, two other soldiers had collapsed after showing symptoms of heat illness.\n\nBut the exercise continued, despite the inquest hearing about a health and safety document directing march commanders to assess whether activities should be halted when heat injuries are suspected.\n\nThe inquest has also heard a key temperature gauge used to determine if it was safe to start outdoor activities had been 'erroneously' located in the shade of the base's gym at Dering Lines, meaning it gave low readings in the morning.\n\nCpl Hoole died within an hour of collapsing just 400 yards from the end of a fitness test\n\nExercises are not supposed to go ahead if the wet bulb globe thermometer hits 20C (68F), the coroner heard.\n\nWhen the march started at 7am the gauge was reading 17C (62.6F), but by 10am it had risen to 25.5C (77.9F).\n\nSpeaking after Mr Hoole, Brigadier Christopher Coles said: 'I would like to begin by saying how very much I regret Corporal Joshua Hoole's death while training for a career course in July 2016.\n\n'Having myself given evidence to the coroner, and having spoken with members of Corporal Hoole's family, I know that he was an able, talented, and dedicated and highly-promising junior NCO with a bright career ahead of him.'\n\nExtending his condolences to the soldier's family and friends, Brig Coles added: 'The MoD has acknowledged that aspects of the policy in place which governed the training Corporal Hoole was undertaking could have been better, and was in areas inconsistent.\n\n'While much work has already been done to address this, we will seek to ensure that it is refined and improved to help ensure a tragedy like Corporal Hoole's death is not repeated.\n\n'While demanding training is always a requirement of Army life, I am clear that reducing risk in all dangerous activity is essential.'", "description": "Corporal Joshua Hoole, described as 'fit, capable and determined', died within an hour of collapsing just 400 yards from the end of an annual fitness test (AFT) at Brecon on July 19, 2016.", "authors": ["Mark Duell For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/15/20182334-0-image-a-11_1572012699848.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
