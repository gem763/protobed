This is [up to] your prime minister to deliver now a vote at your parliament.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Economic disruption \u2013\n\nBritain and the EU reached a divorce deal in November last year but it was rejected by the House of Commons three times, mainly over objections to the Irish border plans.\n\nAll sides agree they do not want the return of infrastructure on the frontier, to avoid exacerbating tensions over Britain\u2019s control of Northern Ireland that caused decades of deadly violence up until the 1990s.\n\nThe previous \u201cbackstop\u201d would have effectively kept the UK in the EU\u2019s customs union if and until another way was found to avoid checks on the Northern Ireland-Ireland border.\n\nThe new plan would see Northern Ireland remain British legal territory but trade under EU regulations.\n\nBut, because it would involve some customs and tax checks with the rest of the UK, it raised the hackles of the DUP.\n\nLocal authorities would be given a new say, with Northern Ireland\u2019s regional assembly given a vote every four years on whether to maintain the arrangements.\n\nIf the assembly votes them down, Barnier explained, there will be a \u201ccooling-off period\u201d of two years to work out what to replace them with.\n\nBut the DUP warned that did not go far enough.\n\nIf Johnson cannot get his own deal through by Saturday, he will be forced by law to ask the EU to postpone Brexit \u2014 the third time it will have been delayed.\n\nHe has repeatedly said he will not do that.\n\nburs-ar/dc/rlp", "description": "Brussels (AFP) \u2013 Britain and the European Union reached a new divorce deal Thursday that could allow Brexit on October 31, but faced immediate", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/17/a594d3_britain-voted-narrowly-in-2016-referendum-leave-eu-britain-eu-strike-brexit-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
