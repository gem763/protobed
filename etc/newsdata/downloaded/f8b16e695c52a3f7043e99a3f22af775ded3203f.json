Pete Sessions (R-TX) included huge ad buys that appear to have pushed the boundaries of laws restricting super PAC coordination with political campaigns, according to a Daily Beast review of federal campaign finance and television broadcasting records. And they could severely complicate the former congressman\u2019s attempt to win back office in 2020.\n\nThe expenditures made by America First Action came during the 2018 election cycle, during which Sessions was fighting desperately to hold on to his House seat in a race he would go on to lose to Democrat Colin Allred. The PAC, which has President Donald Trump\u2019s official imprimatur, has raised millions of dollars to fulfill that task. And during that election season, $325,000 of that came from a company called Global Energy Producers LLC, a firm run by Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman.\n\nThe Soviet-born businessmen were, at the time of their donation to the PAC, helping Giuliani solicit dirt on President Donald Trump\u2019s political opponents from officials in Ukraine. That work, which is now at the center of an impeachment inquiry against the president, included trying to get the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, removed from her post on grounds that she was badmouthing Trump.\n\nTrump allies have also alleged that Yovanovitch was blocking key corruption investigations in the country\u2014most importantly, for their purposes, a probe into the Ukrainian business activities of Hunter Biden, the youngest son of Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden. According to the Associated Press, the Giuliani clique continued pressed for Yovanovitch\u2019s removal early this year. She was recalled from her post in May.\n\nSessions\u2019 role in the saga began in the spring of 2018. On May 11, Parnas posted photos to Facebook showing him and a business associate, David Correia, posing with the then-congressman in the Capitol complex. On the very same day that Parnas posted the photos to Facebook, Sessions shot off a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo questioning the fitness of Yovanovitch.\n\n\u201cI have received notice from close companions that Ambassador Yovanovitch has spoken privately and repeatedly about her disdain for the current administration,\u201d he wrote in claims that mirrored allegations from Giuliani and his associates.\n\nSix days after the letter was sent, Global Energy Producers made its donation to American First. The following month, Parnas and Fruman each donated the legal maximum to Sessions\u2019 campaign.\n\nSessions\u2019 campaign did not respond to a request for comment on this story. But the former congressman has denied that he pressed for Yovanovitch\u2019s removal at the behest of Giuliani, Parnas, or anyone else.\n\n\u201cI do know both these gentlemen,\u201d Sessions told BuzzFeed News and the Overseas Crime and Corruption Reporting Project in response to a joint investigation into Giuliani, Parnas, and Fruman. \u201cThey are Republicans. They are people who have an interest in foreign affairs. They have a strong interest in America not backing away from Ukraine.\u201d\n\nAmerica First spokesperson Kelly Sadler said there was no understanding when GEP donated to the group that it would be supporting Sessions\u2019 candidacy, or that the money provided by Parnas\u2019 and Fruman\u2019s company would go towards a specific candidate.\n\nBut as investigations into what Trump and Giuliani were doing in Ukraine continue to ramp up, Sessions\u2019 opponents are demanding that he further explain the reasoning for his letter to Pompeo and whether he was rewarded financially for writing it.\n\n\u201cAt the moment, it seems to me he was playing the role of the useful idiot,\u201d his Democratic opponent this time around, businessman Rick Kennedy told The Daily Beast in an email. \u201cSessions and the incumbent Bill Flores represent everything that is wrong with our politics today. They\u2019re both ordained by big donors to sit in a seat in Congress to represent [the donors\u2019] interests. The donors move candidates around like pieces on a chess board to try to get their representatives in and their agendas through.\u201d\n\nKennedy said he doesn\u2019t buy Sessions insistence that he was not doing Giuliani\u2019s bidding. \u201cHe wrote a letter without understanding the broader context or strategy, and he got a couple of big donations for it,\u201d the Democrat said in his email.\n\nSessions, who was one of the most endangered Republican incumbents during the 2018 cycle, was one of fifteen House candidates that benefited from America First\u2019s eight-figure independent expenditure campaign. The group ultimately dropped more than $3.1 million supporting Sessions and attacking Allred, according to Federal Election Commission data. Only one other House candidate got more America First air support last year.\n\nSuper PACs are legally prohibited from coordinating with the campaigns of federal political candidates they support. But America First\u2019s extensive television ad buys on Sessions\u2019 behalf appear to have employed a tactic that good government groups say pushes the boundaries of\u2014and could even violate\u2014federal laws barring such coordination.\n\nThe tactic revolves around the use of a shared vendor. The Sessions campaign employed an ad-buying firm called America Media & Advocacy Group, while America First used a company called Red Eagle Media Group. Public records indicate that the groups are effectively the same entity, with shared staff and office space.\n\nIn fact, the same official, America Media executive Jon Ferrell, signed Federal Communications Commission paperwork for both entities as they took out late-October ad buys in an effort to shore up Sessions\u2019 political prospects. Vendors are legally permitted to work for both a political campaign and a supportive super PAC provided they \u201cfirewall\u201d off the services they provide to eac h, and Sadler said that the group had taken pains to establish just such boundaries.\n\n\u201cWe have hired political professionals, both in-house and externally, who have worked in this field for years and take these obligations seriously,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAny suggestion otherwise is false and likely politically motivated.\"\n\nThe Campaign Legal Center, a nonprofit campaign finance watchdog, filed an FEC complaint against the National Rifle Association last year under similar circumstances, arguing that the legally required firewall is farcical when the same executive oversees ad buys for both a campaign and an allied super PAC.\n\n\u201cIt appears that the coordination scheme pioneered by the NRA has also been adopted by the president\u2019s super PAC,\u201d said Brendan Fischer, CLC\u2019s director of federal and FEC reforms. \u201cThe NRA used common vendors to coordinate potentially tens of millions of dollars with the Trump campaign in the 2016 election, and Trump\u2019s super PAC appears to have replicated the scheme in 2018.\u201d\n\nIndeed, even as he was approving America First ad buys supporting Sessions\u2019 candidacy, Ferrell was signing other FCC forms as an \u201cagent for Pete Sessions for Congress.\u201d", "description": "Pro-Trump group America First appears to have pushed the legal limits with a seven-figure ad campaign on behalf of Pete Sessions.", "authors": ["Lachlan Markay"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_2488,w_4424,x_0,y_439/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570571933/GettyImages-656468184_opbqxt", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
