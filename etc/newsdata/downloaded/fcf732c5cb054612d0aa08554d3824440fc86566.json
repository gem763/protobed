The first owners, the Morosini family, sold the residence in 1661 to Nicol\u00f2 Sagredo. It is said that Galileo went to the palace to visit with his friend, mathematician Giovanni Francesco Sagredo.\n\nWalking into the enormous lobby, guests are greeted by friendly staff and two marble cherubs by sculptor Francesco Bertos. The youthful angels welcome visitors to climb the grand staircase to view the \u201cFall of the Giants.\u201d Completed in 1734, the Rococo painting is the only existing fresco by Venetian artist Pietro Longhi (1701-1785).\n\nThe hotel\u2019s other objets d\u2019art and antiquities are equally eye-opening. Highlights include the music room featuring frescoes by Gaspare Diziani, the Murano glass chandeliers and the terrazzo floors adorned with the Sagredo family\u2019s coat of arms.\n\nFind dining\n\nVisitors have many dining options along the Grand Canal while at the Ca\u2019 Sagredo, which offers its own al fresco experience at its Zac Patio in Santa Sofia square. (It is open April through October.)\n\nChef Damiano Bassano, born in the southern Italian port town of Puglia, has returned to Italy after having worked in Paris, Strasbourg, the United States and Spain, where he spent time at Chef Ferran Adria\u2019s erstwhile three-star Michelin restaurant in Catalonia.\n\nThe Grand Canal boasts a dinner menu rooted in traditional Venetian dishes with fresh fare from land and sea \u2014 and exceptional service, as expected.\n\nChef Bassano adds his own flair to the traditional offerings. A Venetian favorite is creamy codfish; Chef Bassano serves codfish with polenta, flavored with herbs and rosemary, and calls the dish il baccala mantecato, polenta alle erbette e olio al rosmarino.\n\nMeanwhile, il risotto asparagi features carnaroli risotto with scallops and lemon \u2014 familiar but surprising in its creaminess, with the tart burst of lemon and sweet scallops shining through.\n\nMeat courses include a rosemary beef fillet with cinnamon potatoes and green pepper hummus. The sweet fillet is perfectly accented with the tart green peppers and savory cinnamon.\n\nThe menu also features a robust vegetarian selection.\n\nFind Venetian history\n\nCa\u2019 Sagredo not only has the Grand Canal at its front door but also sits across from the world-famous Rialto Fish Market and northwest of the Rialto Bridge.\n\nTime your visit to catch the fishermen returning from Venice Laguna with their cries of \u201cfresh fish!\u201d to locals and restaurants. The neo-Gothic market is full of live eels, crabs, swordfish and brilliant pink-red tuna.\n\nThe Rialto is a perfect example of commerce in Venice, as it has been since its earliest days (1097). In Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cThe Merchant of Venice,\u201d Shylock opens the play with the questions \u201cWhat news on the Rialto?\u201d In her \u201cSonnets from the Portuguese,\u201d Elizabeth Barrett Browning writes \u201cthe soul\u2019s Rialto hath its merchandise.\u201d\n\nWhile browsing the stalls, look for glass beads \u2014 some from Murano, others in the Murano style. Venetian marbled papers, lace and linens are on display, waiting to go home as gifts and souvenirs.\n\nThe buildings in the area, however, date back only to the 16th century. A 1514 fire burned the Rialto down. Still, locals say that nothing has changed at this iconic marketplace, except for the awnings \u2026 and the addition of technology.\n\nCall in advance to visit the Scuola Grande di San Giovanni Evangelista (1261), a building for charity work by lay brethren where visitors will find Gothic, Renaissance and Venetian baroque art and architecture. An 90-minute tour moves quickly through the building and includes the Campiello San Giovanni Evangelista, which consists of the remodeled 10th-century church and the Scuola Grande (or \u201cgreat school\u201d).\n\nIn 1454 the building was enriched with a lateral facade in Flamboyant, or late-Gothic, style.\n\nVisiting any of Venice\u2019s 139, primarily Catholic, churches is a treat, as they are repositories of Venetian Renaissance art, sculpture and architecture. Today only 88 of these structures still operate as churches. Some have become meeting places or repositories of the arts, providing venues for museums and concert-style performances.\n\nThe Basilica di Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari\n\nLocated in the heart of the San Polo district, the church is dedicated to the Assumption of Mary and is one of the largest basilicas in Venice. The Frari is one of Venice\u2019s most sacred destinations.\n\nFranciscans started building the Italian Gothic-style church in 1250 and took more than a century to complete the construction. The campanile, or bell tower, is the second tallest in the city, after San Marco\u2019s.\n\nSome items not to miss reside in the Dettagli Dell\u2019opera chapel. On the altar one will find a triptych signed by Bartolomeo Vivarini of Mirena (1474). The center image is of St. Mark, offering a blessing while surrounded by angels. On the left side are St. John the Baptist and St. Jerome. On the right are Saint Nicholas and Saint Peter.\n\nIn the Frari sacristy of the Pesaro chapel stands a Giovanni Bellini painting in three, hinged parts with a center image that is grander than its wings. The colors of this piece are remarkable, from the deep blue of the Madonna\u2019s robes to the alabaster skin of the Christ child, all beneath a golden barrel vault.\n\nThe artist has given this piece remarkable depth and clarity through details such as the marble veining and the angels that serenade the mother and child. The figures in the side panels are given depth through the use of slivers of a landscape that place the imagery in a dimensional place.\n\nThe San Polo sestiere is full of great churches, art and history, all just steps away from the Ca\u2019 Sagredo Hotel \u2014 itself a destination for grandeur.\n\n\u2022 Jacquie Kubin is an award-winning travel and food writer and travel editor at Communities Digital News.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nWHEN YOU GO\n\nTips for touring Venice\u2019s church history:\n\n\u2981 Visit Venipedia. orgto review a list of churches and their locations.\n\n\u2981 Take change. Many churches ask for a donation, if not an admission fee. Cash on hand helps.\n\n\u2981 Be respectful in tone and tenor. Dress modestly. Bare shoulders (men or women), short shorts (men or women) or revealing clothing is not allowed. If you must wear that shoulderless sundress, carry a large scarf that you can wrap around your shoulders or cover any d\u00e9colletage.\n\nCa\u2019 Segredo Hotel\n\nAddress: Campo Santa Sofia, 4198/99, 30121 Venezia VE, Italy\n\nPhone: +39 041-241-3111\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
