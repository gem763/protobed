A big value-added tax would be especially misguided.\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at Yang\u2019s plan. As I noted in the interview, the Tax Foundation crunched the numbers.\n\nAndrew Yang said he wants to provide each American adult $1,000 per month in a universal basic income (UBI) he calls a \u201cFreedom Dividend.\u201d He argued that this proposal could be paid for with\u2026a combination of new revenue from a VAT, other taxes, spending cuts, and economic growth. \u2026We estimate that his plan, as described, could only fund a little less than half the Freedom Dividend at $1,000 a month. A more realistic plan would require reducing the Freedom Dividend to $750 per month and raising the VAT to 22 percent.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested, here are more details about his plan.\n\n\u2026individuals would need to choose between their current government benefits and the Freedom Dividend. As such, some individuals may decline the Freedom Dividend if they determine that their current government benefits are more valuable. The benefits that individuals would need to give up are Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP), Temporary Assistance for Needed Families (TANF), Supplemental Security Income (SSI), and SNAP for Women, Infants, and Child Program (WIC). To cover the additional cost of the Freedom Dividend, Yang would raise revenue in five ways: A 10 percent VAT\u2026A tax on financial transactions\u2026Taxing capital gains and carried interest at ordinary income rates\u2026Remove the wage cap on the Social Security payroll tax\u2026A $40 per metric ton carbon tax.\n\nBy the way, Yang has already waffled on some of his spending offsets, recently stating that the so-called Freedom Dividend wouldn\u2019t replace existing programs.\n\nIn any event, the economic and budgetary effects would be bad news.\n\n\u2026his overall plan would reduce the long-run size of the economy and the tax base. The three major taxes in his plan (VAT, carbon tax, and payroll tax increase), while efficient sources of revenue, would tend to reduce labor force participation by reducing the after-tax returns to working. Using the Tax Foundation Model, we estimate that the weighted average marginal tax rate on labor income would increase by about 8.6 percentage points. The resulting reduction in hours worked would ultimately reduce output by 3 percent. We estimate that Yang would lose about $124 billion each year in revenue due to the lower output.\n\nHere\u2019s how the Tax Foundation scores the plan.\n\nAs you can see, the VAT, the financial transactions tax, the higher capital gains tax, and the increase in the payroll tax burden don\u2019t even cover half the cost of the universal handout.\n\nP.S. When the Tax Foundation say a tax is an \u201cefficient source of revenue,\u201d that means that it would result in a modest level of economic damage on a per-dollar-collected basis. This is why they show a rather modest amount of negative revenue feedback (-$124 billion).\n\nI think they\u2019re being too kind. Extending the Social Security payroll tax to all income would result in a huge increase in marginal tax rates on investors, entrepreneurs, and other high-income taxpayers. As explained a few days ago, those are the people who are very responsive to changes in tax rates.", "description": "While he\u2019s not as outwardly radical as\u00a0Elizabeth Warren,\u00a0Bernie Sanders, and\u00a0Kamala .10/25/2019 19:49:21PM EST.", "authors": ["Daniel J.
