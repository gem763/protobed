Don\u2019t worry, there\u2019s something for your feline, too.\n\nIt\u2019s not a mince pie, but Sainsbury\u2019s is selling festive chicken, duck and cranberry-flavoured products, as well as deli sticks that taste like turkey, duck and goose.\n\nThere are 13 Christmas food lines in total, with prices ranging from 90p to \u00a35.\n\nSee, you no longer need to feel guilty as you munch on festive treats (though, let\u2019s face it, you\u2019ll probably still sneak them some turkey now and then).\n\nMORE: When are the H&M dog and owner jumpers on sale and how much do they cost?\n\nMORE: Deaf and blind puppy named Piglet teaches kids about special needs pets\n\nMORE: Lidl is selling a heated dog bed which keeps four-legged friends warm during winter\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "The supermarket has 13 festive, animal-friendly products to choose from including mince pies with turkey biscuit stars for man's best friend.", "authors": ["Almara Abgarian"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_89411750_1570788856.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
