To check, follow the pattern over your whole chest, up to your collarbone and under your armpit. (The checking itself should be done with the bra off, once you\u2019ve familiarised yourself with the pattern.) There is a choice of three patterns. There is no better or worse one to follow \u2013 each of them provides a different way of checking and learning about what feels normal for you. Which is important, because when you know what feels normal, you can tell when something doesn\u2019t. Once you\u2019ve checked once, remembering to do it again should be easier, because the pattern will remind you to every time you pick up the bra.\n\nThe designs include a black bralet with a star pattern, bandeau bralet with zig zag pattern, both \u00a315, and a bralet with a zebra pattern for \u00a314.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe star pattern comes with Brazilian knickers, the zig-zag with high waist knickers and the zebra print comes with a thong.\n\nThe zebra pattern (Picture: Boohoo)\n\nCarol Kane, joint founder of Boohoo said: \u2018We have worked with CoppaFeel! In the past and it is a charity close to our hearts. We were delighted to have been chosen as the e-commerce partner for the \u2018Life Saving Lingerie\u2019 project and hope we can help spread the positive message around the importance of checking your breasts through our platforms.\u2019\n\nKris Hallenga, founder of CoppaFeel! added: \u2018We\u2019re really pleased for the opportunity to spread our message with Life Saving Lingerie.\n\n\u2018CoppaFeel! Exists to stamp out the late detection of breast cancer by educating young people about their boobs and encourage them to get anything abnormal checked out.\u2019\n\nYou can also find more information about checking your boobs on the Coppafeel! website.\n\nMORE: Woman confuses shoppers by posing with coffin in Amazon dress review\n\nMORE: Fashion Nova is selling some odd leggings with an open crotch\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "The life-saving lingerie bras come in three patterns to help you familiarise yourself with checking your boobs.", "authors": ["Laura Abernethy"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_91398626_1571819867.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
