(Reuters)\n\nFitzpatrick wasn\u2019t happy with Dolphins\n\nA versatile defender capable of playing multiple positions in the secondary, Fitzpatrick has lined up primarily at strong safety this season, a position even his mother complained about during the preseason.\n\nAt 6-foot-1 and 207 pounds, Fitzpatrick presumably feels he\u2019s better suited to play in the secondary rather than line up in the box to battle with bigger offensive players.\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, here's how]\n\nFitzpatrick\u2019s departure further depletes an already talent-thin Dolphins roster that has started the season with a 59-10 loss to the Baltimore Ravens and a 43-0 loss to the New England Patriots.\n\nFitzpatrick is the second high-profile player the Dolphins have traded since the preseason after dealing left tackle Laremy Tunsil to the Houston Texans on Aug. 31.\n\nStockpile of draft picks in Miami\n\nThe Dolphins continue to compile draft assets as they face the prospect of posting the worst record in the league.\n\nMiami acquired Houston\u2019s first-round picks in 2020 and 2021 in the Tunsil trade that also saw it part with wide receiver Kenny Stills.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith the Fitzpatrick trade, Miami now possesses its own 2020 first-round draft pick in addition to the Texans\u2019 and the Steelers\u2019. Due to previous deals, the Dolphins also own the New Orleans Saints\u2019 second-round pick, the Tennessee Titans\u2019 fourth-round pick, the Dallas Cowboys\u2019 sixth-round pick and the Kansas City Chiefs\u2019 seventh-round pick in 2020.\n\nSteelers pick could be valuable\n\nThey have a strong likelihood of landing the No. 1 overall selection with their own pick. With the news of Ben Roethlisberger\u2019s season-ending elbow injury, the Steelers\u2019 selection could also end up being a premium pick.\n\nThat the Steelers were willing to part with a first-round pick after learning of Roethlisberger prognosis speaks to how highly they value Fitzpatrick\u2019s talent.\n\nThe Dolphins drafted Fitzpatrick with the No. 11 pick in the 2018 draft out of Alabama and could end up with a pick in the same range or better in return.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nJason Owens is a writer for Yahoo Sports.
