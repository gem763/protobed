And we have the capability of putting hundreds of thousands of people in space in the years to come. And that's ridiculously exciting,\u201d said Branson, who founded the company in 2004. \u201cSo here we are, on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, launching the first spaceship company.\u201c\n\nIn an interview with Yahoo Finance\u2019s On the Move, Branson said taking the company public would give them the resources to do \u201cwondrous things.\u201d Virgin Galactic plans to take people to space as early as next year.\n\n\u201cWe like to do things with a little bit of splash. We've got something quite exciting happening, which we will be announcing soon as to who's coming with me,\u201d Branson said, referring to the inaugural flight, which will carry six passengers. \u201cAnd so watch this space.\u201d\n\nSir Richard Branson stands outside the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) ahead of the Virgin Galactic (SPCE) IPO in New York, U.S., October 28, 2019. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid More\n\nVirgin Galactic completed its merger with Social Capital Hedosophia last week to create Virgin Galactic Holdings, Inc. which is now trading on the NYSE under the ticker symbol \u201cSPCE.\u201d The company, 15 years in the making, cost more than $1 billion to build.\n\nCurrently, traveling to space on a Virgin Galactic flight will cost a hefty $250,000 per seat. The company expects that cost to come down over the next five to 10 years as the business becomes more cost effective. According to Chamath Palihapitiya, Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings founder, the company has about 70% operating margins, \u201cwhich means it\u2019s as good of a business as a Google or Apple or a Facebook.\u201d\n\nVirgin Galactic expects to have five spaceships operating by 2023, shuttling approximately 1,500 customers annually. From there, the sky is the limit for those who can pay. And for those who can\u2019t, the company plans to bring costs down by building spaceships faster, cheaper, and more efficiently. It has already started instituting manufacturing efficiencies in the spaceship and rocket production process, said George Whitesides, Virgin Galactic CEO.\n\nSo, how much will a ticket eventually cost once the Virgin Galactic reaches scale?\n\n\u201cI think, you know, if we have 20 or 30 spaceships or something, we will, you know, in 20 years time, the price will come down dramatically,\u201d said Branson, declining to specify.\n\nYvette Killian is a producer for Yahoo Finance\u2019s On The Move.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nForget FAANG, investors should consider MANG\n\nShaq on investing: 'I don\u2019t ever think about making money'\n\nWeWork 'has to give us a valuation that's reasonable': IPO expert\n\n5G will make devices more vulnerable to cyberattacks: Akamai CEO\n\nUS bankruptcy filings rose in July 2019 \u2014 what does that mean?\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, SmartNews, LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit.", "description": "Sir Richard Branson's spaceship tourism company Virgin Galactic started trading on the New York Stock Exchange Monday.", "authors": ["Yvette Killian"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/QVszaBdHAv30UriXOvUIIw--~B/aD0zODQwO3c9NTc2MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/7770d0b0-f9c0-11e9-aded-c744a7213746", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
