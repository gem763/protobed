The 27-year-old Muslim woman had not been to the beach in years, despite living in a state with over 40 beaches. Ever since she started wearing a hijab as a teenager, she never went swimming.\n\nUntil now.\n\nDressed in the new burkini she bought earlier this year \u2014 black leggings, a bright pink long-sleeved swim tunic, topped with a built-in black hijab \u2014 Hussein pushed away her fears and looked ahead, ready for the muscle memory to kick in.\n\nShe tried not to pay attention to fellow swimmers nearby. She tried not to worry that someone might harass her, or even worse, physically attack her. It wouldn\u2019t be the first time it happened.\n\nMuslim women like Hussein have long been persecuted and intimidated for wearing a modest bathing suit. They have been kicked out of pools and beaches. They have been told that their bathing wear wasn\u2019t suitable. Pool- and beachgoers have even told them to go back to their country. Some have called the police on them.\n\nKholood Eid for HuffPost Manar Hussein at a beach in New Jersey, June 26, 2019. This was Hussein's first time wearing a burkini in the water.\n\nSwimming is one of America\u2019s greatest pastimes, but due to their visibility, Muslim women who wear a burkini face a huge risk of harassment.\n\nHuffPost spoke to over 30 Muslim women across the country who described a wide range of experiences swimming in America. Not all of their encounters were negative, but the vast majority of interviews uncovered a pattern: Muslim women are still fighting for their right to swim. Often they are confronted in public, humiliated and abused. They face decades of entrenched prejudice from people who view their modesty as oppressive and unfeminist.\n\nIt is not just happening in America. Three years ago, at least 20 French towns adopted a burkini ban, forbidding Muslim women from swimming in public pools and beaches if they dressed fully covered. The ban has since been overturned, but similar bans continue to happen, despite a rise in burkini sales.\n\nBack in the U.S., anti-Muslim hate crimes accounted for over 18% of religiously motivated hate crimes in 2018. No organization tracks hate crimes faced by Muslim women specifically, but HuffPost has documented the intersections of sexism and Islamophobia on the road, in politics, at schools and beyond. Being visibly Muslim by wearing the burkini \u2014 or the hijab \u2014 often makes Muslim women a target.\n\nMuslim Women On The Frontline Of Hate\n\nHussein, who grew up in Ventor, a coastal city less than five miles from Atlantic City in southern New Jersey, was often at the beach as a child. She regularly visited Egypt with her family, where she swam in the Mediterranean. As a teen, before she started wearing the hijab, she spent hours at her local pool in South Jersey.\n\nBut one day when Hussein was swimming, she noticed a commotion. Several poolgoers were harassing a burkini-wearing Muslim woman. They demanded that the lifeguard kick her out, saying her clothing was unhygienic and unsanitary.\n\nKholood Eid for HuffPost Manar Hussein at a beach in New Jersey, June 26, 2019.\n\n\u201cNo one stood up for her. No one did anything,\u201d recalled Hussein, who said the incident was one of the reasons why she chose not to swim for so many years. Hussein, a research assistant and education doctoral student at Montclair University, worried that if she did, she would be at the center of public humiliation like that Muslim woman she witnessed as a young girl.\n\nHussein\u2019s fears aren\u2019t unfounded. One burkini-wearing Muslim mother told HuffPost about an incident at a waterpark in Toledo, Ohio. She was there with her children two years ago, when she was approached three times by three different staff members who questioned her about her outfit. One manager even asked to see the tag on her burkini to confirm it was indeed swimsuit material. In New York, a 25-year-old Muslim woman was swimming at her neighborhood pool in Staten Island when a fellow poolgoer began to take photos of her and her sisters and complained out loud about their attire. \u201cThis is why I\u2019m with Trump,\u201d the photo-taking poolgoer allegedly told the Muslim women.\n\nThe incidents are not occurring in a bubble. Although there are no set rules that prohibit Muslim women from swimming in burkinis, many women say they are criticized or harassed.\n\nKholood Eid for HuffPost Manar Hussein at a beach in New Jersey, June 26, 2019.\n\n\u201cClothing is a really interesting entryway into a larger conversation about Islamophobia and misunderstandings about Islam in general,\u201d said Liz Bucar, a professor of religion at Northwestern University and the author of \u201cPious Fashion,\u201d a book examining Muslim fashion trends across the globe.\n\nBucar said one of the reasons why Muslim women who cover up experience more backlash than other communities like conservative Jewish women is because of the \u201cmisconception and stereotype that Islam is just more patriarchal than other faith groups\u201d and that \u201cthe headscarf is a sign that Muslim men are controlling Muslim women, or that the tradition itself is patriarchal and misogynistic.\u201d\n\nBut Muslim women are changing that every day, through entrepreneurship, social media and resisting the pushback in person.\n\n\u201cClothing becomes an example of Muslim women\u2019s empowerment, not their oppression,\u201d said Bucar.\n\nModernizing The Rules For Inclusivity\n\nDananai Morgan, a 34-year-old avid swimmer, was doing laps at her local YMCA in Dorchester, Massachusetts, last summer when the lifeguard stopped her. The lifeguard told her it was \u201cunsafe\u201d to swim in her burkini and that she was required to wear \u201cappropriate attire.\u201d\n\nMorgan explained to the lifeguard and subsequently the fitness center\u2019s manager that her swimsuit was indeed appropriate attire and further explained that the fabric made for her modest swimwear was the same as any other bathing suit. She explained that her choice to wear a burkini did not break pool rules and eventually she was allowed back in the water.\n\nKholood Eid for HuffPost Dananai Morgan at a YMCA in Boston July 2, 2019.\n\nMorgan was grateful the situation didn\u2019t escalate, but she said it highlighted the need for institutions to host cultural sensitivity training and not put the burden and attention on swimmers.\n\n\u201cTo be treated like that in a space where they\u2019re trying to have more people of color swimming, to have more women swimming, to increase healthy habits and make sure everyone feels included and have access to that part of the community, this was a negative experience for me, and I needed to name that,\u201d Morgan told HuffPost.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Muslim women have had sour experiences at their local YMCAs. Last year, a Charlotte-based YMCA employee called the police on a Muslim mother because she wore a burkini when she took her children to the pool. But the mother, Fatima Najjati, refused to leave.\n\nKholood Eid for HuffPost Dananai Morgan swims at a YMCA in Boston on July 2, 2019.\n\n\u201cI took my time and just stood there walking around. I\u2019m just not going to pack my stuff and leave,\u201d Najjati told HuffPost at the time, who said it was important for her to set an example for her daughter.\n\nThe YMCA has since apologized to Najjati, calling the incident a \u201cmisunderstanding,\u201d at the time. Almost a year later, a spokesperson for that YMCA told HuffPost that changes have been made since the encounter.\n\n\u201cThe incident forced us to reexamine not only our swimwear policy but also how we equip our staff \u2014 from lifeguards to service representatives to aquatics leaders \u2014 to better understand and to facilitate an environment where everyone can be and feel respected, supported, valued and welcomed to fully participate,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nKholood Eid for HuffPost Dananai Morgan at a YMCA in Boston, July 2, 2019.\n\nThe updated policy, reviewed by HuffPost, now explicitly allows \u201cspecialized swimsuits designed with modesty in mind, such as a \u2018Burqini\u2019 which traditionally includes three separate pieces: pants, a long t-shirt, and a headcover and head coverings/headscarves no longer than shoulder length.\u201d\n\nModest Swimwear On The Rise In America\n\nThe rise of modest swimwear expands beyond just Muslim women. Men and women from other faith groups including Orthodox Jewish women and Mormon women all subscribe to modest dress, which includes longer garments at the beach. Individuals with skin sensitivity also dress to cover up to avoid sun damage and other ailments.\n\nHistorically, Muslim American women have purchased burkinis from Muslim-majority countries such as Turkey and Egypt, but recently they have now turned to American-based companies who offer manageable shipping rates and sizes.\n\nCoolibar, a Minnesota-based clothing company that specializes in sun-safe apparel, has been selling swimwear for over 20 years. The company recently launched Swim Hijab, a line of modest swimwear. Soon after the launch, the company received requests for more colors and patterns. The company is \u201cvery pleased with how people are responding to it,\u201d said a spokesperson.\n\nBucar said big brands have only recently been paying attention to the modest fashion market and that most retailers assumed \u201cpeople who are religious don\u2019t consume,\u201d which, in reality, is far from the truth.\n\nModanisa, an online Turkish-based modest fashion clothing company that ships worldwide and is among the top sellers for American Muslim women, said burkini sales have increased over 80 percent since last year. Their largest buyers are in Germany, the U.K., France and Jordan.\n\nHalima Aden, an American-Muslim fashion model who made headlines as the first woman to wear a hijab in the Miss Minnesota USA pageant, broke yet another fashion glass ceiling when she made her debut on the cover of the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit edition as the first Muslim model to wear a hijab and burkini \u2015 made by Modanisa \u2015 in April 2019.\n\nModest Muslim fashion isn\u2019t a foreign idea in the United States. Some of the earliest documented businesses of modest fashion started with Nation of Islam women in the \u201960s, according to Kayla Wheeler, an assistant professor at Grand Valley State University and the author of an upcoming book documenting black Muslim fashion in the United States.\n\n\u201cA lot of women in the Nation created small businesses around fashion where they would make clothes for their friends and family, but then also sell it to Muslims in the Nation as well as non-Muslims throughout the local Chicago area,\u201d Wheeler said.\n\nThe legacy of these women continued to carry with modern black Muslim women designers today who have taken their designs outside the U.S. and to Europe and beyond.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s really interesting, at least since the 2000s, is how this community has begun to grow outside of just Muslims and included other women who are interested in modest dress like Orthodox Jewish women, women who are Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, or Pentecostals, or other conservative Christians, who are just interested in dressing in particular ways,\u201d Wheeler said. \u201cYou see that definitely with the swimsuit, as well.\u201d\n\nSetting An Example As Modest Muslim Mom\n\nFousia Abdullahi, a 35-year-old Texas resident, is a full-time podcast producer who documents the challenges and accomplishments of Muslim moms in America. She\u2019s also a part-time pharmacy technician. Between it all, she is a mother of four children, ages 13, 11, 8 and 4 years old.\n\nKholood Eid for HuffPost Fousia Abdullahi swims with her son at her home in Texas.\n\nBefore having children, Abdullahi hadn\u2019t been swimming since she herself was a child. Growing up, burkinis were not popular and so Abdullahi would swim in a long-sleeved top and leggings. But the outfits brought uncomfortable stares and remarks, so she stopped swimming.\n\nBut after having children, Abdullahi\u2019s kids begged her to play in the water. The Dallas-based mom didn\u2019t want to prevent her children from the leisure activities she once enjoyed solely because she didn\u2019t have options for swimwear. So she began to shop online.\n\n\u201cI think anytime that we\u2019re raising kids, we\u2019re constantly pushing ourselves out of our own comfort zone. So whether it\u2019s going to the beach or going to the pool, that\u2019s something that I\u2019m doing for them so that they know that that\u2019s a space that they can take up. It\u2019s a space where they can be comfortable and have fun and enjoy it,\u201d Abdullahi told HuffPost.\n\nKholood Eid for HuffPost Fousia Abdullahi swims with her daughter.\n\nAlthough Abdullahi now swims with her children, she can\u2019t help but constantly look over her shoulder. During the 2017 summer when she took her kids to a water park, she noticed a man staring at her and taking pictures of her without her permission. The incident reminded her of why she stopped swimming in the first place.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a woman, I\u2019m a black woman, and I\u2019m Muslim,\u201d said Abdullahi. \u201cI\u2019ve always been super hyperaware of that prior to [the Trump] administration, but even more so now. Being part of a marginalized community has this level of fear to it and a level of hypervigilance.\u201d\n\nKholood Eid for HuffPost\n\nBack in New Jersey, Hussein recalled all the moments she missed out on swimming. There was the time she didn\u2019t swim at her university pool. Or the time she was on a hiking trip with friends and everyone jumped into the lake while she watched from afar.\n\nShe decided she wasn\u2019t going to sit on the sidelines anymore.\n\n\u201cI kept on my hijab as a form of resistance but that\u2019s not always easy. If I am going to truly commit to this resistance, I also have to do it for not just the revolution, but I have to do it for my own joy,\u201d said Hussein. \u201cI deserve that.\u201d\n\nHussein took her first dive into the encompassing ocean water. She floated for the first time on her back and grinned up at the sky. It was so easy. She missed having sand stuck in her ears and missed the sound of being underwater. \u201cThe muffled sound, it\u2019s so peaceful,\u201d she told her friends once she was back on the sand.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to have to worry about my burkini,\u201d she said. \u201cI just want to wear it, be happy with it and just go to the beach.\u201d\n\nMuslim women across the globe have been subject to an increasing amount of harassment when swimming \u2014 all for wearing modest swimsuits.
