If speaking out helps one other person from falling for the same thing then I'll be pleased I've done it.'\n\nMr Thompson was targeted on a Friday evening back in May, when he was called by a main claiming to be from the security department of his bank.\n\nDespite using software to screen out unwanted phone calls, the scammers were able to round the technology to make it look like they were calling from his local bank.\n\nFormer fire and police officer Mr Thompson (right in his fire uniform) says he feels 'foolish' for being scammed (pictured right at home in Doncaster)\n\nBeing wary of scammers, Mr Thompson said he had put the phone down the first time they had called, but when they called again 20 minutes later and said he was the bank manager in Doncaster, Mr Thompson stayed on the line.\n\nDuring the call the man told Mr Thompson that there had been a security breach on his account and that he needed to transfer the funds into a safer one.\n\nHow to spot fraud before it's too late The Take Five campaign has provided some tips and advice to help spot fraudulent messages. A genuine bank or organisation will never contact you out of the blue to ask for your PIN, full password or to move money to another account. Only give out your personal or financial details to use a service that you have given your consent to, that you trust and that you are expecting to be contacted by. Never automatically click on a link in an unexpected email or text. If you're approached with a request for personal information, do not provide it. Instead, contact the company directly using a known email or phone number.\n\nEven though Mr Thompson hadn't given the man any information, he was able to recite recent bank transactions as well as Mr Thompson's account balance, and even his late mother's maiden name.\n\nMr Thompson then went on to transfer a total of \u00a314,700 and afterwards said he thought it could have been a scam.\n\nHe added: 'I called in to my local branch the following day and sure enough, they informed me it was a scam.'\n\nDespite being a victim of a scam, Mr Thompson has been unable to reclaim his money.\n\nThis is due to the fact that he moved the money himself rather than it being stolen out of his account, this is known an 'authorised push payment'.\n\nA crowdfunding campaign has now been set up in order to help Mr Thompson to reclaim the lost funds.\n\nIt has so far raised nearly \u00a33,000.\n\nBoth Action Fraud and South Yorkshire Police have been assisting Mr Thompson since the incident.\n\nSouth Yorkshire Police's Fraud Protect Officer Andy Foster said that unfortunately, Mr Thompson's situation was all too familiar and that there had been countless amount of similar victims.\n\nMr Foster added: 'These fraudsters are professionals, using increasingly sophisticated methods to trick people out of their hard-earned money and life savings.\n\n'The fact they are now able to make it look like they are calling from a local number, or the number of your bank, makes their devious schemes even more convincing.\n\n'A legitimate bank would never contact you to ask you to transfer your money into another account. If you are in doubt, hang up the phone, leave it for a few minutes and then call your bank for advice.'\n\nIn a statement Nationwide said the building society was 'not responsible' for the loss of Mr Thompson's lost funds.\n\n'Mr Thompson was unfortunately the victim of a safe account scam.\n\n'To convince him he was calling from the Society the scammer would have de-registered him from online banking. They then called Mr Thompson and got him to re-register, which he did.\n\n'Once back in, Mr Thompson initiated three separate payments and warnings about scams would have been shown to him for each.'\n\nThe spokesperson claimed that each time Mr Thompson selected a payment option he chose the 'pay a friend or family' button.\n\n'To initiate payments to a new payee, members are required to authorise the payment using their card and PIN in their card reader to generate a unique code, which Mr Thompson put in to authorise the payments.\n\n'In total, payments of \u00a314,700 were made. By the time Mr Thompson realised he was the victim of a scam and contacted us, all money had been withdrawn. As he authorised the payments, Nationwide is not responsible for his loss.'\n\nThe banking industry launched a new code of conduct on May 28 this year - just days after John was duped by fraudsters.\n\nThe spokesperson added: 'On 28 May 2019, the industry launched a new code of conduct to help victims of scams, including supporting the 'no blame' fund to help victims, which Nationwide has signed up to.\n\n'Under the new code the Society has increased the warnings on the Online Bank, Mobile Banking App and in branch.\n\n'One of the best defences against scams is education, which is why the Society does a lot to warn people about scams including education events in branch and at Talkback events, information in branches, online and on social media as well as regular mailings to customers.'", "description": "Former firefighter and police officer John Thompson (pictured at home in Doncaster) lost almost \u00a315,000 after transferring three payments of \u00a34,900 out of his bank account.", "authors": ["Terri-Ann Williams For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/10/19531638-0-image-a-14_1570699457933.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
