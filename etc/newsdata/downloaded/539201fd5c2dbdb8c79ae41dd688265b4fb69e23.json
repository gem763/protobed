Reddit users discovered the Yandhi ringtone snippets, which linked back to West\u2019s artist page on iTunes, prompting reports from outlets like Vulture and Heavy to speculate that this is how Kanye intended his new project to roll out. Unfortunately, evidence suggests the ringtones are a scam, scraped from leaked copies of the original tracks, with none of the money headed back to West himself. The ringtones were recently removed from iTunes, likely because they were not official.\n\nThere has been incredible anticipation around Yandhi, with people going as far as to crowdfund the purchase of song leaks, encouraging those with access to works in progress or a studio session to illicitly distribute them. West also has a history of sharing works in progress and bucking industry norms when it comes to releasing music, so the idea that he could have uploaded Yandhi as ringtones wasn\u2019t impossible.\n\nThe clue that suggests these ringtones weren\u2019t official is in the metadata. They all listed ENZO Label as the copyright holder, an unknown entity that isn\u2019t associated with any of the usual players West releases music through, like Def Jam Music Group or Roc Nation Records.\n\nENZO Label also appears to have a history of populating Apple Music and other streaming services with illegal copies of existing songs. The label\u2019s pattern is to keep the song name intact but tweak the artist name, and label all of its releases as \u201calternative,\u201d regardless of genre.\n\nKanye isn\u2019t the first artist that ENZO Label seems to have ripped off\n\nIn fact, Kanye isn\u2019t the first artist that ENZO Label seems to have ripped off. The Verge was able to find ENZO Label attached to a rip of the classic \u201880s rock song \u201cRock You Like a Hurricane\u201d by Scorpions under the artist name \u201cFelix,\u201d as well as a copy of \u201cJunk of the Heart\u201d by The Kooks under the artist name \u201cTony Hoffer\u201d (who actually is a real producer and songwriter that worked with The Kooks). Here are many other examples of dubious ENZO Label releases on Apple Music.\n\nWhile Genius picked up on the unusual label name associated with the ringtones, it pointed out that there\u2019s also a label named Enzo Recordings, run by British musician Chicane, but there doesn\u2019t seem to be a connection \u2014 Enzo Recordings operates as an above board label for Chicane\u2019s own releases. It\u2019s common for artists create their own label in order to put out and distribute their own songs, and Chicane is an acclaimed dance music producer with top ten hits in Europe and Australia. But there\u2019s no reason Chicane would be releasing ringtones for Kanye or renamed songs for the Kooks \u2014 he\u2019s never worked with either artist. Additionally, his label as a company is registered as Enzo Recordings, not ENZO Label.\n\nIs it possible that these were legitimate releases? Perhaps, but that chance is very, very slim. One of ENZO Label\u2019s listings on Apple Music is \u201cGud Vibrations (Nitti Gritti Remix)\u201d by Nghtmre and Slander, labeled instead as \u201cGud Vibrations\u201d by Nightmare. The Verge reached out to Will Runzel, co-founder of Prodigy Artists, the company that manages both Nghtmre and Slander. When asked if this could be a legitimate licensed version of the song, Runzel said it was \u201ctotally impossible.\u201d\n\nSo, how does an entity like ENZO Label upload these songs to services? Probably through any normal distribution service like TuneCore. \u201cJust give it a new code and upload it,\u201d Kevin Casini, Entertainment Law Professor at the Quinnipiac School of Law, tells The Verge:\n\nWhatever you input is whatever they have. I could rip a CD my mom has of Huey Lewis and the News, pretend it\u2019s a completely different band, change all the metadata, upload it, and it\u2019s out there. It\u2019s up to the content rights holder to find this thing and tell the streaming service or distribution channel, \u201cHey, that\u2019s mine.\u201d And changing the artist name is indicative that [ENZO Label] know[s] what they\u2019re doing.\n\nEven though Kanye West\u2019s Yandhi hasn\u2019t been officially released, the album has been incrementally leaking online for some time. According to Highsnobiety, this is reportedly due to a \u201cmovement of Kanye fans crowdfunding to leak unreleased demos from the upcoming album.\u201d So, it\u2019s not entirely far-fetched to see the tracks appear on iTunes, especially as ringtones, which only require a clip of each song and not the entire thing.\n\nThe Verge has reached out to Apple Music and Universal Music for comment.", "description": "Kanye West\u2019s Yandhi briefly appeared online after its release was pushed back multiple times in 2018, but in an unlikely place: as iTunes ringtones.
