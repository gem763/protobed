Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.\n\nIn one of the most notable exchanges of the night, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro accused Biden of \"forgetting what you said two minutes ago\" as they sparred on health care, but he later denied in an interview with ABC News that it was an attack on the 76-year-old's age.\n\nJulian Castro goes after Joe Biden on health care: \"I'm fulfilling the legacy of Barack Obama, and you're not.\"\n\n\n\n\"That'll be a surprise to him,\" Biden responds. https://t.co/Et1vHu3PU0 #DemDebate pic.twitter.com/34MOxRXDGK \u2014 ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) September 13, 2019\n\n\"That's the question, is Biden past it?\" ABC News Senior National Correspondent Terry Moran says on the \"Start Here\" podcast. \"[Castro] took what was either a fair shot or a cheap shot, depending on how you see Joe Biden.\"\n\nTrump didn't tweet during the debate, but his campaign's communications director Tim Murtaugh told ABC News last night, \"Unimpressive roster of Dems up there tonight. Nothing new. President Trump will dominate any of them.\"\n\nListen to today's special edition of the \"Start Here\" podcast for more of the debate's top takeaways and complete analysis of the night.\n\nEric Gay/AP\n\n\"Start Here,\" ABC News' flagship podcast, offers a straightforward look at the day's top stories in 20 minutes.
