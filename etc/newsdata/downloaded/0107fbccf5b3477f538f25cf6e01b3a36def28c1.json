At the very least, Castro suggested, \u201cwe need to get universal background checks done, a renewed assault weapons ban, and limiting the capacity of these magazines.\u201d\n\nMany Republicans also said they hoped to take action to curb gun violence. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said his party has been interested in \u201ccommon sense solutions to prevent this from happening in the future while at the same time protecting due process for anyone who is a law-abiding citizen.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton told Fox News\u2019 \u201cSunday Morning Futures\u201d that state officials including Gov. Greg Abbott got together as part of a domestic terrorism task force to address the issue. Paxton said he would like Congress do the same to try determining \u201cwhat kind of practices would change this from happening or at least allow us to respond more quickly.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump tweeted Sunday morning, \u201cGreat job by Texas Law Enforcement and First Responders in handling the terrible shooting tragedy yesterday. Thank you also to the FBI, @GregAbbott_TX and all others. A very tough and sad situation!\u201d\n\nFox News' Mike Emanuel contributed to this report.", "description": "Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary\u00a0Juli\u00e1n Castro\u00a0outlined what he would do about gun control if elected president, in the wake of a shooting rampage that killed seven people in his home state of Texas over the weekend.", "authors": ["Ronn Blitzer"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/06/Julian-Castro-9.jpg"}
