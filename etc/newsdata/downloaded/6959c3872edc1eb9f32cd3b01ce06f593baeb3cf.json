(The article reported that the whistle-blower is a C.I.A. officer who was previously detailed to work at the White House and had expertise on Ukraine.)\n\nMany readers, including some who work in national security and intelligence, have criticized The Times\u2019s decision to publish the details, saying it potentially put the person\u2019s life in danger and may have a chilling effect on would-be whistle-blowers.\n\nWe took their concerns to Dean Baquet, The Times\u2019s executive editor, who responded to them in a discussion with the Reader Center:\n\nThe president and some of his supporters have attacked the credibility of the whistle-blower, who has presented information that has touched off a landmark impeachment proceeding. The president himself has called the whistle-blower\u2019s account a \u201cpolitical hack job.\u201d\n\nWe decided to publish limited information about the whistle-blower \u2014 including the fact that he works for a nonpolitical agency and that his complaint is based on an intimate knowledge and understanding of the White House \u2014 because we wanted to provide information to readers that allows them to make their own judgments about whether or not he is credible.", "description": "Our executive editor, Dean Baquet, addresses readers\u2019 concerns about the decision to publish information on a person who is central to the Trump impeachment inquiry.", "authors": ["The New York Times"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/26/us/politics/26readers-whistleblower/26readers-whistleblower-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
