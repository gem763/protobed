The Republican National Committee said that it and Donald Trump\u2019s re-election campaign raised a stunning combined total of $125 million in the third quarter, a presidential fundraising record.\n\nBiden, whose campaign has struggled to retain pole position over the past month, announced Thursday that he had raised $15.2 million for the quarter, behind Sanders, Warren and South Bend, Indiana\u2019s centrist Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who raised over $19 million.\n\nBiden in recent weeks has been caught in the maelstrom as Trump faces an impeachment inquiry over accusations he pressed Ukraine for damaging information on the former vice president and his son.", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 Democrat Elizabeth Warren raised a solid $24.6 million in third-quarter contributions to her 2020 White House campaign, her", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/06/93cdec_us-democratic-presidential-hopeful-elizabeth-warren-raised-24-million-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
