They came within a field goal of beating Oklahoma State on the road in 2010.\n\nOh, and they beat Missouri 24-14 some 15 years ago.\n\nNow, the school just about equidistant from Alabama and Auburn has a chance to take down the Tigers again. Troy heads to Missouri on Saturday for what new coach Chip Lindsey _ a former Auburn offensive coordinator _ hopes is a statement game against an SEC foe.\n\n\u201cThe opportunity to play in these games is what makes Troy a special place for our players to come to,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously each year is different because the team is different, and I wasn\u2019t here the last couple of years, but I know our players are excited about this opportunity.\u201d\n\nMissouri coach Barry Odom knows better than to overlook the Trojans (2-2), though. The Tigers lost to Middle Tennessee in 2016, his first season in charge, and at Wyoming this season.\n\nBoth of those games the Tigers were expected to win.\n\nBut a big difference this week: Missouri is coming off three straight wins and a bye.\n\n\u201cIn a way we\u2019re as healthy as a team as we\u2019ve been since we started, which is awesome,\u201d Odom said. \u201cWe had bonus practices on our next opponent. Really a very thorough self-evaluation and self-analysis on all three phases of our game on where we are and what we need to do to improve, and the reasons we haven\u2019t had success in some areas, how we can have success in those things.\u201d\n\nOne area where it will be hard to improve is consistency on offense. The Tigers (3-1) have won their last five home games by a combined 193-49 dating to last season, and they have scored at least 31 points in nine consecutive games _ the school\u2019s longest such streak since the 2006-07 seasons.\n\nBYE, BYE, BYE\n\nMissouri has struggled following byes under Odom, getting pounded by Florida in 2016, losing at Kentucky the following year and dropping a nail-biter at South Carolina last season.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve learned just to deal with it,\u201d Odom said. \u201cYou know, don\u2019t run from the fact of what it is. Address it with the team. They understand where we are and what we need to do. And they\u2019ve responded in the way that we want them to respond.\u201d\n\nGETTING DEFENSIVE\n\nFor all of Missouri\u2019s recent offense, it was the defense that made the two defining plays of its win over the Gamecocks. Cale Garrett recovered a fumble in the end zone for a touchdown to make it 7-0, and Ronnell Perkins returned an interception 100 yards for a touchdown later in the game. It marked the first time since 2014 the Tigers had fumble and interception touchdowns in the same game.\n\nTROJAN HORSES\n\nThere\u2019s a good argument to be made that Troy has the most dynamic offense that Missouri has faced this season. The Trojans are ranked 32nd nationally and have scored at least 40 points in both of their losses. Their quarterback, Kaleb Barker, has thrown for 1,367 yards with 13 TDs and two interceptions.\n\nDIFFERENCE-MAKER\n\nTroy is allowing 29.5 points per game, which is not particularly good. But that doesn\u2019t mean there is no talent on that side of the ball. Odom highlighted Trojans linebacker Carlton Martial, who has 43 tackles and 7 1/2 tackles for loss already this season.\n\nBIG-PLAY BRYANT\n\nClemson transfer Kelly Bryant has been making plays for Missouri all season, but he\u2019s starting to come into his own the last couple weeks. He was 19 of 33 for 227 yards and two touchdowns in a win over South Carolina before the bye, and ran 11 times for another 77 yards.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a fantastic player,\u201d Lindsey said. \u201cI coached against him when he was at Clemson, and I thought he always threw the deep ball well, but it looks like he\u2019s developed even further since then. He\u2019s a very good athlete who can hurt you with his feet as well.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Among the many reasons former Troy coach Neal Brown earned the job at West Virginia was his success against programs from Power Five conferences, including a win at Nebraska last season.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Dave Skretta"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/21/south_carolina_missouri_football_69723_c0-102-2476-1545_s1770x1032.jpg?25a5360059e21a2fffd60f6face68b65d24d7684", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
