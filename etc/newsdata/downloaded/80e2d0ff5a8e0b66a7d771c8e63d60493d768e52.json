Not the last episode \u2014 it sent him off on the right note, as far as things were going \u2014 but the final season as a whole. Jesse\u2019s humanity ultimately became more important than the wreck that was Walter White, but the show didn\u2019t care to recenter our interest around the one flawed character who still deserved sympathy. (At least, as far as I remember from watching this in 2013.)\n\nEl Camino is something of an attempt to fix that. It\u2019s a totally unnecessary, but entirely fun return to Breaking Bad\u2019s world. It\u2019s hardly a movie in the traditional sense; and even if you remember Breaking Bad reasonably well, you may (as I did) find yourself looking stuff up afterward. But it\u2019s worth watching for any fan.\n\nI still feel a little like Jesse was slighted again, though, with El Camino leaving the character in roughly the same place we last saw him. The film seems to be more interested in taking a trip back through our memories of the show than really moving Jesse forward. With that said, El Camino\u2019s best moment is one in which we get to see the full range of Jesse\u2019s character, with Aaron Paul perfectly popping back into an earlier incarnation of his role in a flashback. Maybe it\u2019s not the attention he deserved, but it\u2019s still a fun trip for fans.\n\nCheck out 11 trailers from this week below.\n\nDolittle\n\nOne day you\u2019re playing Iron Man, the next you\u2019re playing a doctor who talks to animals who has to look swashbuckling and lightly sweaty at all times and only talks in a sexy, comforting whisper. What is happening here? This thing comes out January 17th.\n\nAmerican Son\n\nKerry Washington and Steven Pasquale bring their performances from the stage to the screen for this adaptation of the play American Son, which opened on Broadway nearly a year ago. The film really seems to be interested in keeping the play at just that: a play, giving the actors room to do their thing, with the camera nice and close. It comes out November 1st.\n\nLady and the Tramp\n\nTalking dog movies are extremely in right now (I\u2019m sorry!), and yet Disney is sending its live-action Lady and the Tramp remake (which is a whole lot more live action than Disney\u2019s entirely CGI \u201clive-action\u201d Lion King remake) straight to streaming. But I guess that\u2019s a good way to help send subscribers to Disney+ on day one. The film premieres November 12th.\n\nThe Man Without Gravity\n\nThis feels like a film from a decade ago: unapologetically twee, and potentially even charming enough to pull it off. Maybe I\u2019m just buying in because the whole thing\u2019s in Italian, but I\u2019m pulling for Netflix on this one. The film comes out November 1st.\n\nThe Laundromat\n\nIt seems like every single person involved in this movie just goofed around the whole time... and maybe it\u2019s great because of that. The film, from Steven Soderbergh and starring Meryl Streep, came out Friday.\n\nBombshell\n\nSomehow, the director behind the Austin Powers trilogy is now making this film about sexual harassment at Fox. It\u2019s a huge, serious story to unpack, and while this film has some big star power behind it, I\u2019m not entirely convinced from the trailer that this kind of playful tone is exactly what the story needs. The film comes out in December.\n\nDollface\n\nOkay, look. There\u2019s a talking cat who drives a bus that takes Kat Dennings to relationship purgatory, or something like that, as well as literal Instagram cops policing accidental likes. I need to know at least a little bit more. The show comes out November 15th.\n\nBeanpole\n\nI am completely absorbed by this trailer: the sound, the color, the shapes of people\u2019s faces. Even just the first 45 seconds \u2014 it switches from oddly hilarious to darkly serious in an instant, balancing those feelings the rest of the way through. The film, which won Cannes\u2019 top directing prize, follows two young women in Leningrad in the immediate aftermath of World War II. It comes to the US in limited release on January 29th.\n\nThe Imagineering Story\n\nGee, I wonder how the documentary crew got behind-the-scenes access for this one? As much of a Disney puff piece as this is likely to be, The Imagineering Story still takes viewers into parts of Disney\u2019s parks that most don\u2019t get to see \u2014 and I\u2019m sure for a lot of people, that\u2019ll be worth checking out nonetheless. It comes out November 12th on Disney+.\n\nThe Outsider\n\nFortunately, Stephen King has enough material to sustain nonstop adaptations for the next several decades. The latest is The Outsider, a 10-episode series about an unexplainable murder. It starts January 12th on HBO.\n\nMarriage Story\n\nNetflix put out a full-length trailer this week for Marriage Story, the latest film from Frances Ha director Noah Baumbach. The film tells the story of a relationship through a divorce proceeding, which is something I haven\u2019t seen done before and could make for a very emotional film. It comes to theaters on November 6th and hits Netflix exactly a month later.", "description": "Watch this week\u2019s best new trailers from Netflix, Hulu, HBO, and more, including two trailers from Disney\u2019s upcoming streaming service, Disney+.", "authors": ["Jacob Kastrenakes", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tGOl55yiF28eSlSFeEswKuRBKfI=/0x258:3600x2143/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19299877/AMERICANSON_Unit_00061RC3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
