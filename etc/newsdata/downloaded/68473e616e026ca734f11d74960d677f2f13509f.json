But prices came off their peaks after U.S. President Donald Trump authorized the use of the country\u2019s emergency stockpile to ensure stable supply.\n\nBy 0823 GMT, Brent futures were up 8.75% at $65.49 per barrel, while U.S. light crude was up 7.8% at $59.13.\n\nThe upheaval in the oil market and poor economic data from China bolstered investors\u2019 demand for safe-haven assets, pushing the Japanese yen and Swiss franc higher and sending core euro zone bond yields lower.\n\nWorld stocks halted a four day winning streak and were down 0.16%. European shares fell 0.55% and Wall Street signal a weak start, too, with E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 off 0.34%.\n\nThe surge in crude prices comes at a time when central banks in the United States, Europe and Asia are easing monetary policy to fight a slowdown in the global economy amid a drawn out trade war between Washington and Beijing.\n\n\u201cSpikes in oil prices when the global economy is already flirting with the idea of recession is not ideal and, if repeated and sustained, could ultimately be what tips us over the edge,\u201d said Craig Erlam, analyst at OANDA in London.\n\nData from China further underscored worries about the slowdown in the world\u2019s No. 2 economy. Industrial production grew at its weakest pace in 17-1/2 years amid rising U.S. trade pressure and softening domestic demand.\n\nTrump also said the United States was \u201clocked and loaded\u201d for a potential response to the strikes on the Saudi facilities, after a senior official in his administration said Iran was to blame.\n\nThat inflamed fears about Middle East tensions and worsening relations between Iran and the United States, powering safe-haven assets, with gold up 0.92% to $1,502.1 per ounce.\n\n\u201cThe bigger issue is what premium markets will build in to reflect the risk of further attacks,\u201d said Kerry Craig, Global Market Strategist, J.P. Morgan Asset Management.\n\nFILE PHOTO: The German share price index DAX graph is pictured at the stock exchange in Frankfurt, Germany, August 20, 2019. REUTERS/Staff\n\n\u201cIn the very near-term, we may also see a pick-up in safe-havens,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cCentral banks are likely to look through the inflationary impact of higher oil prices but the added geopolitical risk to an already fragile backdrop will not go without notice.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve is due to hold its policy meeting on Wednesday, at which it is widely expected to ease interest rates and signal its future policy path.\n\nSAUDI BONDS HIT\n\nDollar-denominated bonds issued by Saudi Arabia\u2019s government and state-oil firm Saudi Aramco tumbled to multi-week following the attacks.\n\nSaudi Aramco\u2019s longer-dated bonds bore the brunt of the falls with the 2049 issue dropping nearly 3 cents in the dollar to touch their lowest since early August, data from Tradeweb showed.\n\n\u201cMarkets had become too sanguine over the last few months about the geopolitical risks facing countries allied with the US against Iran, with Saudi Arabia particularly vulnerable,\u201d said Patrick Wacker at UOB Asset Management.\n\n\u201cWhile Saudi Arabia\u2019s sovereign fundamentals are still firm, bond prices will need to factor in higher geopolitical risk going forward,\u201d he added.\n\nIn currency markets, the Saudi news pushed the yen up 0.2% to 107.88 per dollar, while boosting currencies of oil-exporting countries.\n\nThe Norwegian crown surged as much as 0.7%, then settled at 8.9517 crowns against the dollar, up 0.37% on the day, while the Canadian dollar rose 0.23% to C$ 1.3253. The Russian rouble was also higher.\n\nThe currencies of oil importers such as Turkey and India underperformed.\n\nFILE PHOTO - Passersby are reflected on a stock quotation board outside a brokerage in Tokyo, Japan, August 6, 2019.
