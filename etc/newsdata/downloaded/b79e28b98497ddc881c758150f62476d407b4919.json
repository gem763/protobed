REUTERS/Rebecca Naden\n\nThe two-time World Player of the Year was a surprising choice to start the Pool B clash in Oita on Wednesday given Hansen had chosen just two flyhalves for the World Cup and said before the tournament he might rotate them during pool matches.\n\nHansen, who has preferred the pair to operate in tandem as dual playmakers in recent matches, played them together in the opening match against the Springboks with Barrett at fullback.\n\nThe expectation was that only one would be in the match-day squad against Canada and for the following match against Namibia.\n\nHansen, however, said on Monday he wanted to give the pair as much game time as possible in tandem.\n\n\u201cI just want them to be on the park together,\u201d Hansen said. \u201cThey haven\u2019t had a lot of test matches together so they just need some more time.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying they\u2019re not clicking or anything like that, it\u2019s just time (together).\u201d\n\nThe Barretts will become the first trio of brothers to appear for the All Blacks in a World Cup match and first trio of brothers to start a World Cup game since Elisi, Manu and Fe\u2019ao Vunipola represented Tonga against Scotland in 1995.\n\nThe three Pisi brothers - Ken, Tusi and George - all played for Samoa against South Africa in 2015 but only Ken started that match.\n\nJack Goodhue has returned from a hamstring injury that kept him out for almost two months and will link with Sonny Bill Williams in the midfield.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t need to show us he is an international rugby player, we already know that,\u201d Hansen said of Goodhue\u2019s return.\n\n\u201cWhat he needs to do is get some minutes into his legs. He hasn\u2019t played for six weeks so he may only play 30, 40, 50 minutes and it\u2019s important that he gets through that and he gets through it well.\u201d\n\nRieko Ioane, who has scored 23 tries in 26 tests, also returns on the left wing after being dropped for the Bledisloe Cup match against Australia in Auckland last month.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s in a contest against two other guys who are playing wonderful rugby,\u201d Hansen said, referring to Sevu Reece and George Bridge.\n\n\u201cWe know that he can also play wonderful rugby. It\u2019s important that he doesn\u2019t come out and get too caught up in the contest and that he does the small things well and the big things will come for him.\n\n\u201cOnce he does that, and I\u2019m sure he will, the pressure will come back on to the selectors to pick him.\u201d\n\nTeam: 15-Beauden Barrett, 14-Jordie Barrett, 13-Jack Goodhue, 12-Sonny Bill Williams, 11-Rieko Ioane, 10-Richie Mo\u2019unga, 9-TJ Pereira, 8-Kieran Read (captain), 7-Matt Todd, 6-Shannon Frizzle, 5-Scott Barrett, 4-Patrick Tuipulotu, 3-Angus Ta\u2019avao, 2-Liam Colt man, 1-Atu Moil\n\nReplacements: 16-Codie Taylor, 17-Ofa Tuungafasi, 18-Nepo Laulala, 19-Sam White lock, 20-Ardie Save, 21-Brad Weber, 22-Ryan Clotty, 23-Ben Smith", "description": "Beauden Barrett will start at fullback for the All Blacks, alongside brothers Jordie and Scott, against Canada in Oita as coach Steve Hansen continues to develop his dual playmaker role with Richie Mo'unga.", "authors": ["Greg Stutchbury", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190930&t=2&i=1435460030&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8T0FG-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
