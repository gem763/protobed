To replace a veteran coach in Jay and to be asked to lead a program, now, in Week 6. Unchartered waters for me, real privilege and an honor to lead this team.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nCallahan, 63, begins his second stint as an NFL head coach under less-than-ideal circumstances, after Gruden was fired with a 35-49-1 career record. He will face the task of coaching a team still searching for its first win and featuring an unsettled quarterback situation involving veterans Colt McCoy and Case Keenum and first-round rookie Dwayne Haskins.\n\nAD\n\nPreviously Washington\u2019s offensive line and assistant head coach, Callahan was head coach of the Oakland Raiders from 2002 to 2003, including a Super Bowl appearance, before spending four seasons as the head coach of the University of Nebraska. He returned to the NFL in 2008 as an assistant with the New York Jets before moving on to the Dallas Cowboys in 2012 and joining the Redskins in 2015.\n\nBrewer: Another Redskins coach fired, and his successor already is destined to fail\n\nThe decision to go with Callahan marks a bit of a shift in coaching styles. One current player, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that while Gruden\u2019s firing was \u201csad\u201d and the coach hadn\u2019t lost the locker room, many players could welcome the hard-charging style of Callahan, whom the player referred to as a \u201chard a--.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThat change in style might be what\u2019s needed for a team seeking its first victory ahead of a road game against the winless Miami Dolphins. Gruden was known as a player\u2019s coach and not necessarily a disciplinarian, though players noted a more intense Gruden this season.\n\nAD\n\nCallahan is known for pushing his players aggressively. The offensive linemen are routinely the last position group on the field after Washington practices \u2014 something that elicits different opinions. Some believe the extra work is positive, while others wonder if it leads to increased injuries. The offensive line has been one of the more injury-prone positions on a team that has had 20-plus players on injured reserve the last two seasons. Pro Bowl guard Brandon Scherff and starting center Chase Roullier have both missed the last two games.\n\nA change in offensive philosophy could also be on the horizon. The Redskins have the third-fewest rushing attempts in the NFL (88), something Callahan criticized during an offensive meeting last week.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI envision ourselves as a running team,\u201d Callahan said Monday. \u201cI\u2019d like to get our run game going. That\u2019s important because everything else is complementary off it.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe biggest decision Callahan faces may be centered on Haskins. With the team unlikely to compete for a playoff spot, many have called for the team to play Haskins in hopes of evaluating him and accelerating his development. However, the coaching staff previously didn\u2019t deem him ready to play, and Allen said in remarks Monday that Callahan has free rein to choose his starting quarterback.\n\nCallahan said that while he doesn\u2019t know who will start against Miami, he isn't ready to start Haskins.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe will be at some point in time,\u201d Callahan said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to develop him and heighten his maturation process. Try to get him on schedule so he is prepared.\u201d He added that Haskins could be active or inactive on game days. \u201cWe\u2019ll see as we move along.\u201d\n\nCallahan declined to detail all of the changes he would like to make, but he did say there would be adjustments to schedules, the way the team practices and what will be demanded in meetings. He said he will keep the current defensive staff and that offensive coordinator Kevin O\u2019Connell will call plays.\n\nAD\n\nCallahan would not say if he wanted the job permanently, saying, \u201cI\u2019ve been auditioning for over 20 years in the National Football League. I\u2019m not auditioning [for] nothing but trying to get our team better. \u2026 I\u2019m not worried about me.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBoth Callahan and Allen were adamant Monday about wanting the team to improve and have immediate success.\n\n\u201cAs we go forward, I\u2019m going to rely on the staff \u2026 and the leadership of our team to change the course,\u201d Callahan said. \u201cThere\u2019s no magic formula to all of a sudden go into a winning team. But I do think the formula of working hard and preparing hard and preparing better, I think those things are in the control of the staff and players. \u2026 We need more consistent effort.\u201d\n\nMore Redskins coverage:\n\nRedskins players react to Jay Gruden\u2019s firing: \u2018Sorry we couldn\u2019t get the job done for you\u2019\n\nThe Redskins are starting over after firing Jay Gruden, but in what direction are they headed?\n\nAD", "description": "The 63-year old takes over as Washington's interim head coach following Monday morning's firing of Jay Gruden.", "authors": ["Kareem Copeland", "Reporter Covering The Washington Redskins"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/i31r83iBvOLlb-0Br61w-78CzeU=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/36D3DCXJG4I6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
