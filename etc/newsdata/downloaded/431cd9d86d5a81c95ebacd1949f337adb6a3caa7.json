(AP) - The New York Jets have activated tight end Chris Herndon after he completed a four-game suspension and waived linebacker Frankie Luvu.\n\nThe Jets had a roster exemption for Herndon that expired Monday, causing them to make a move to clear a spot for him on the active roster. Herndon was banned for the first four games of the regular season for violating the NFL\u2019s substance abuse policy.\n\nHe was eligible to practice with the team last week, but is sidelined by a hamstring injury. The team is hoping Herndon, who had 39 catches for 502 yards and four touchdowns as a rookie, will return to practice this week.\n\nLuvu was signed last year as an undrafted free agent out of Washington State. He had three sacks and 26 tackles in 18 games the past two seasons for New York.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The New York Jets have activated tight end Chris Herndon after he completed a four-game suspension and waived linebacker Frankie Luvu.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/09/jets_herndon_sidelined_football_66352_c0-166-3987-2491_s1200x700.jpg?c974247f6752d4800706a4c3978675eac84f6031", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
