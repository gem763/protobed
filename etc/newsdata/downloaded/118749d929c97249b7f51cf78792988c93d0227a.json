This time it\u2019s for Google\u2018s latest voice assistant device, the Google Nest Mini. As far as we can tell, it looks a whole lot like the original Google Home Mini, except it has a wall mount. That\u2019s something, I guess.\n\nGoogle has slowly been renaming its Home devices under the \u2018Nest,\u2019 bringing some cohesion to its home hardware lineup. WinFuture acquired what appear to be official marketing images of the device, showing the new, single screw mount to easily attach the device to a wall. The device is purported to be made out of more recycled materials and come in at least one new color \u2013 a neat sky blue.\n\nThe wall mount is a nice touch; the Mini is a small device that actually looks quite nice, as far voice assistants go. I wouldn\u2019t mind posting one somewhere unobtrusive, and the wall placement would probably have the side benefit of making audio more intelligible, as sound would have a more direct path to your ears. The new Mini also has a 15W charger, as opposed to a 9W one on the original, which could suggest a more powerful speaker.\n\nUnfortunately, there does not seem to be an aux jack on board, unlike Amazon\u2019s Echo Dot. With Google phasing out the Chromecast Audio, connecting your old speakers to Google\u2018s wireless system is still something of a pain.\n\nThe new Mini is expected to retail for the same $49. We\u2019ll likely find out more at Google\u2018s big Pixel event tomorrow.\n\nFor more gear, gadget, and hardware news and reviews, follow Plugged on Twitter and Flipboard.", "description": "", "authors": ["Napier Lopez", "October"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/plugged?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2FSnag_14fe3a00.png&signature=8fcecf6ca3ef6b7b126914e758bb1f1c", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
