But Kerr threw up an air ball when he was asked if he had an opinion on the pro-Democracy protests and subsequent turmoil in Hong Kong, the autonomous Chinese territory.\n\nCHINESE GOVERNMENT CANCELS NETS EVENT, WON'T BROADCAST NBA PRESEASON GAMES AFTER TWEET FALLOUT: REPORT\n\n\u201cActually I don\u2019t,\u201d Kerr said, according to NBC Sports Bay Area. \u201cIt\u2019s a really bizarre international story. A lot of us don\u2019t know what to make of it. It\u2019s something I\u2019m reading about like everybody is, but I\u2019m not gonna comment further.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWhat I\u2019ve found is that it\u2019s easy to speak on issues that I\u2019m passionate about and that I feel like I\u2019m well-versed on and I\u2019ve found that it makes the most sense to stick to topics that fall in that category. So I try to keep my comments to those things and so it\u2019s not difficult. It\u2019s more I\u2019m just trying to learn.\u201d\n\nKerr said his brother-in-law happens to be a Chinese history professor and noted he's been emailing him to gain a better understanding of the issues at play.\n\nCHINESE BASKETBALL ASSOCIATION CANCELS HOUSTON ROCKETS G-LEAGUE TEAM'S GAME AMID ROW: REPORT\n\nBut Kerr\u2019s uncharacteristic non-answer didn't come in a vacuum. Instead, Kerr chose the path of least resistance after seeing how his league's leadership reacted to Houston Rockets GM Daryl Morey tweeting a pro-Hong Kong slogan. Rockets star James Harden and Brooklyn Nets owner Joseph Tsai were among those who either distanced themselves from Morey's sentiment or discounted his opinion altogether.\n\nHarden on Monday apologized for Morey\u2019s tweet, saying \u201cWe love China.\u201d\n\nTsai, an Alibaba co-founder, lectured and ranted in a Facebook post about China\u2019s sovereignty. He called supporting the Hong Kong protesters a \u201cthird-rail issue\u201d for the Chinese government and Chinese citizens. He said Morey was not informed enough when he tweeted his support for Hong Kong protesters. What has gone unsaid by NBA officials is the league's significant business interests in China \u2013 via means such as manufacturing, television rights and exhibition appearances \u2013 and the NBA brass' stated desire to grow the league's presence in the communist country.\n\nWhile NBA Commissioner Adam Silver has vowed not to punish anyone for speaking up about the issues in Hong Kong and China, discussing domestic political issues \u2013 never mind foreign ones \u2013 can have a negative effect on teams and players\u2019 businesses. The Rockets are already feeling the consequences.\n\nSeveral Chinese sportswear brands have suspended operations with the organization while Chinese sports channels have vowed not to show their games. The Chinese Basketball Association reportedly canceled an exhibition game involving the Rockets\u2019 G-League affiliate. A Nets event was also abruptly canceled ahead of Brooklyn's game against the Lakers.\n\nAnd so with huge sums of money hanging in the balance, senior members of a league praised for producing the most political athletes in sports, have instead chosen to walk a tightrope.\n\nHOUSTON ROCKETS' JAMES HARDEN APOLOGIZES TO CHINA AMID ROW OVER TWEET: 'WE LOVE CHINA'\n\nSan Antonio Spurs head coach Gregg Popovich, who has routinely criticized Trump, endorsed former Democratic congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke for U.S. Senate and praised Kaepernick for his patriotism, has yet to wade into the geopolitical waters.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nLeBron James, perhaps the biggest star in the entire sports universe, whose Los Angeles Lakers play the Nets in China this week, also has yet to say anything about the Hong Kong protests. James has mostly been vocal in his career about social and racial justice issues where he feels he can give a voice to typically overlooked people or events. A decade ago, however, James refused to sign a teammate\u2019s letter condemning China for its role in the genocide in Darfur because he said he didn\u2019t know enough about the issue.", "description": "In the era of \"woke\" athletes, the NBA has staked its claim as the most vocal and progressive among\u00a0the major American sports -- yet many of those same outspoken athletes and coaches praised by the media for their strong, unequivocal pronouncements\u00a0on everything from gun control to\u00a0civil rights to\u00a0President Trump are suddenly silent when it comes to China.", "authors": ["Ryan Gaydos", "Ryan Gaydos Is A Sports Reporter For Foxnews.Com", "Foxbusiness.Com.
