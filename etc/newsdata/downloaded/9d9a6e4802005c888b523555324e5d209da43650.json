She was as startled as I was.\"\n\n(Image: SWNS)\n\nCustomers have previously reported paranormal activity including hearing a child crying in the room upstairs.\n\nLee is more convinced after Molly said she 'felt someone behind her'.\n\n\"I don't believe in ghosts but that footage is pretty convincing,\" he added.\n\n\"A lot of people are saying it's the light glaring through the window and someone said it could be cobwebs but there aren't any.\n\n\"It looks like a small girl in a dress. It was very strange, especially with Halloween this weekend.\n\nHe also claimed a few other colleagues have reported ghost sightings in the past.\n\nThe clip has clearly left some viewers shaken including Tasha Cushley-Gee who wrote on Facebook : \u201cAlways thought this place was haunted.\n\n(Image: SWNS)\n\n\u201cWhen I worked as a night porter here at around 2.30/3am all the foot lock doors would shut one by one and would happen once or twice a night.\u201d\n\nMichael Thornton added: \"It always intrigues me how entities can walk through solid objects, and yet don\u2019t fall through the floorboards and are able to stand on solid ground.\"\n\nShane Sayner said: \"Sounds like the pub should hold an event where people can spend a night there to see if they can see anything.\"\n\nLouise Fillingham added: \"That's exactly what I saw when I worked at Clifford's Tower. Black shadow with the outline of a human.\"\n\nThe Lamb and Lion is made up of two Grade ll Listed buildings.\n\nNumber 2 and 2A is understood to be previously a house and shop, dating back to circa 1840, while number 4 was a house that was constructed in 1782 and was formerly the Bootham Bar Hotel.", "description": "A ghostly child-like figure was seen wandering by the entrance while waitress Molly was clearing the tables", "authors": ["Nathan Sandhu", "Tiffany Lo", "Image", "Swns"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20749940.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_SWNS_PUB_GHOST_005.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
