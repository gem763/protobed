Photo: Kena Betancur/AFP/Getty Images\n\nPresident Trump made fun of 16-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg in a late-night tweet Monday, mocking the emotional plea she made to world leaders earlier in the day.\n\n\u201cPeople are suffering,\u201d Thunberg said through tears. \u201cPeople are dying. Entire ecosystems are collapsing. We are at the beginning of a mass extinction and all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth. How dare you.\n\n\u201cHow dare you continue to look away and come here saying that you are doing enough when the politics and solutions needed are still nowhere in sight,\u201d she said.\n\nHer speech brought out the worst is some conservative commentators, who called her \u201carrogant\u201d and a \u201cfreak\u201d and compared her to Nazi propagandists.\n\nVery normal reaction by conservatives to Greta Thurnberg pic.twitter.com/oXSk5GDDOV \u2014 jordan (@JordanUhl) September 23, 2019\n\nBy late Monday, Trump decided to get in on the fun, although he wasn\u2019t quite as explicit in his mockery. \u201cShe seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future. So nice to see!\u201d he tweeted.\n\nShe seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future. So nice to see! https://t.co/1tQG6QcVKO \u2014 Donald J.

He crossed paths with Thunberg, and while it\u2019s not clear if he saw her, she definitely saw him.\n\nGreta Thunberg\u2019s glare at Donald Trump is giving me the energy to get through this Monday pic.twitter.com/xdM0rdI2ln \u2014 Sam Stryker (@sbstryker) September 23, 2019", "description": "Donald Trump made fun of Greta Thunberg\u2019s emotional climate-change speech at the United Nations in a late-night tweet Monday.", "authors": ["Adam K.
