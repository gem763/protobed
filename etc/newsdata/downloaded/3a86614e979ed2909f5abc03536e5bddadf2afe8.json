I can manoeuvre the hallways to radiotherapy with my eyes glued to a phone; I know which seat to occupy in the specialist waiting area to catch the oncologist\u2019s eye as they emerge from their dens; and I remember that only the ground-floor cafeteria stocks the fruit-flavoured water that quells the numbness in my mother\u2019s mouth after a chemotherapy session.\n\nDespite this tenuous acceptance of the new normal that sickness brings, what rarely feels familiar are the relationships with the people entrusted to alleviate your suffering \u2013 those in charge of delivering the worst news of your life: the doctors.\n\nAs an oncologist I trade in bad news of the worst kind, but giving it is still stressful | Ranjana Srivastava Read more\n\nWhich begs the question, how would you want the news of your mortality to be delivered?\n\nMy mother was diagnosed with breast cancer twice in the span of three years. Like most women, she\u2019s no stranger to pain; and growing up in the throes of China\u2019s political upheaval and later immigrating to a foreign country with no language or cultural knowledge, she is powered by struggle and wears trauma like a second skin. But cancer was a new beast.\n\nSo when the oncologist called us in for the first meeting and proceeded to dispassionately plow through the treatment plan \u2013 surgery, a year of aggressive chemotherapy and radiation, debilitating side effects and odds of recurrence \u2013 the weight of the diagnosis was stifling. My mother\u2019s English is limited but her fear was palpable. I tried my best to voice her concerns: what will the drugs do to her body? When will her hair fall out? Will she still be able to feel like herself? Why was all this happening?\n\nOur questions were met with furrowed brows and defensive rebukes, as if to say, it\u2019s cancer, haven\u2019t you heard? He seemed to view her trepidations as direct challenges to his expertise. The oncologist couldn\u2019t understand why my mother failed to grasp the details of his well-rehearsed monologue, one he had given hundreds if not thousands of times before. Moreover, he was disappointed that she hadn\u2019t accepted her fate and moved on to thinking about recovery. She was being \u201cdifficult\u201d. While I translated these grievances, he took a personal call, replied to a text message and glanced furiously at his watch. We had overstayed our welcome, the obligatory 15 minutes per patient. That was how long it took to deliver the worst news of my mother\u2019s life and what it was going to cost her.\n\nWe were ushered from his office in a daze. Our encounter bore no resemblance to the tales of transformative cancer journeys that adorned the hospital brochures. There were no magnanimous surgeons and smiling oncologists to steer us forward. Our clinical reality was bodies from wall to wall in varying stages of ruin, all waiting for their 15 minutes.\n\nMy mother\u2019s story is not unique. Numerous global studies have explored the harmful effects of corrosive doctor-patient relationships, including the challenges faced by those with language and cultural barriers, many of whom, unlike my mother, don\u2019t have a loved one helping to ask the pertinent questions, who don\u2019t have people fighting for them. Similar studies have also shown that good communication from doctors greatly aids a patient\u2019s recovery and quality of survivorship.\n\nYet it\u2019s hard for sobering data sets to compete with the romantic notions of rebirth and transcendence that often drive our public appetite for rousing cancer stories. The sick are reimagined as heroes of their own fate and doctors are lionised as the saviours who hold their hands in partnership. It\u2019s an impossible standard to aspire to, and for those who fail to live up to it, the burden feels as insurmountable as the disease they are trying to conquer.\n\nTalking about death isn\u2019t easy, but doctors have to get better | Luisa Dillner Read more\n\nThe truth is, it doesn\u2019t take much for pragmatism to eclipse empathy. Doctors are overworked, resources are strained, and it\u2019s a struggle for patients just to get in the room, let alone feel like they\u2019re being seen. As a caregiver, it\u2019s equally curious how easily you become accustomed to seeing your loved one being poked and prodded like a specimen, her humanity slowly eroded by those working to save her life.\n\nEventually, my mother\u2019s oncologist stopped seeing us altogether. Even as our questions dwindled and we received the setbacks with docile nods, we were still pawned off to an assistant. But perhaps what is most telling was that we welcomed this desertion, as it absolved my mother from feeling like she had to perform the role of the model patient, from feeling like she was failing him. She could focus on tackling the cards she was dealt on her terms, human and flawed.\n\nIt\u2019s undisputed that we have admirable cancer professionals doing lifesaving work; one of them writes for this very publication. But while not all of us are blessed with our own Ranjana Srivastava, a modicum of self-awareness and humility from those charged with our health can do wonders to help ease even the most intense pain. After all, that\u2019s why we value doctors. Because more often than not, they do make us feel better. So I ask again, how would you want the news of your mortality to be delivered?\n\n\u2022 Yang Tian works for the digital community team at Guardian Australia", "description": "After my mother\u2019s cancer diagnosis, our questions were met with defensive rebukes.
