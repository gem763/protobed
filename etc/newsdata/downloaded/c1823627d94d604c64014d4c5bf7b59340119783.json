Wilcox, \u201cstopped his association\u201d with the Proud Boys in February, about five months before the Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law inquired about his social media connections with other group members, Police Chief Dennis Woessner said.\n\nIn a letter to the Washington-based civil rights group, the police chief acknowledged that Wilcox had been a Proud Boys member and made online payments to a group leader. The rights group described those publicly visible, online transactions as monthly dues that helped fund the Proud Boys\u2019 \u201cviolent or otherwise illegal\u201d activities.\n\nBut the chief said he reviewed the matter, received an \u201cexplanatory report\u201d from Wilcox and closed the department\u2019s inquiry as being \u201cunfounded,\u201d with no evidence to support a policy violation. Wilcox \u201cadamantly denies being associated with white supremacists\u2019 groups,\u201d the chief wrote in a letter dated Sept. 13.\n\nKristen Clarke, the civil rights group\u2019s president and executive director, said she was \u201castounded\u201d by the police chief\u2019s refusal to take action against the officer.\n\n\u201cIn an era where we are seeing a spike in white supremacist activity, this should sound an alarm. It should not be business as usual,\u201d Clarke said during an interview Tuesday.\n\nWilcox didn\u2019t immediately respond Tuesday to a message left at the town\u2019s police station or a text message and voicemail left at an apparent telephone listing for him.\n\nHe has been an East Hampton police officer since 1999 and never had any complaints of racial bias made against him, according to Woessner. The chief said department records show Wilcox, who patrols a town with an overwhelmingly white population, has stopped only white people between January 2018 and September 2019.\n\n\u201cThere is no question that he is not a white supremacist,\u201d Woessner said Tuesday.\n\nAsked what he knows about the Proud Boys, the chief said, \u201cOnly what I searched on the internet.\u201d\n\nEast Hampton has roughly 13,000 residents and is about 20 miles southeast of Hartford. On its website, the town\u2019s police department says it currently has 11 officers and four sergeants.\n\nAn initial letter from Clarke to Woessner, dated July 24, noted that a federal jury in 2008 awarded more than $27,000 in damages to a man who accused Wilcox and other East Hampton officers of using excessive force during an arrest.\n\nThe plaintiff, Alan P. Clark, claimed Wilcox repeatedly struck him in the head with a metal flashlight while trying to subdue him. Clark said he needed about 14 staples to close his head wounds.\n\nJurors concluded that Wilcox violated Clark\u2019s constitutional right to be free from excessive force and decided the officer was liable for just over $11,000 in damages to compensate Clark for his injuries. An attorney who represented Clark said Tuesday that the parties reached a confidential settlement less than two months after the trial.\n\n\u201cOfficer Wilcox\u2019s association with white supremacists on public platforms, as well as his history of violence, risks interfering with your department\u2019s operations by disrupting the working relationships between the East Hampton Police Department and the community it serves,\u201d Clarke wrote in her July 24 letter to the chief.\n\nIn a Sept. 26 response to the chief\u2019s Sept. 13 letter, Clarke wrote that the police department should immediately review any stops, arrests or investigations by Wilcox \u201cto determine whether or not they were infected with racial bias.\u201d She also asked for a list of any complaints against the officer involving allegations of racial bias, discrimination or harassment.\n\nThe chief hasn\u2019t responded to the letter, Clarke said.\n\nWilcox isn\u2019t the first law enforcement officer linked to the Proud Boys, a group started in 2016 by Vice Media co-founder Gavin McInnes.\n\nLast year, a Louisiana sheriff\u2019s department fired a deputy who had publicly identified himself as a Proud Boys member and was an administrator of the Facebook page for the group\u2019s local chapter. The Plaquemines Parish Sheriff\u2019s Office said its deputy violated an internal policy prohibiting employees from engaging in social media activity that \u201cnegatively affects the public perception\u201d of the department, The New Orleans Advocate reported in August 2018.\n\nMcIness and the Proud Boys have described the group as a politically incorrect men\u2019s club for \u201cWestern chauvinists\u201d and deny affiliations with far-right extremist groups that overtly espouse racist and anti-Semitic views. In February, McInnes sued the Alabama-based Southern Poverty Law Center for labeling the Proud Boys as a hate group.\n\nIn response to the lawsuit, the law center said Proud Boy members often spread \u201coutright bigotry\u201d over the internet and have posted social media pictures of themselves with prominent Holocaust deniers, white nationalists and \u201cknown neo-Nazis.\u201d\n\n\u201cSoon after McInnes unveiled the Proud Boys to the world, the group began making headlines for its members\u2019 involvement in often-violent, ideological street confrontations with other groups,\u201d law center attorneys wrote in a court filing.\n\nIn New York City in October 2018, police arrested several Proud Boys members who brawled with anti-fascist protesters following a speech by McInnes at a Manhattan Republican club. Proud Boys members also have frequently clashed with counterprotesters at rallies in California and Oregon.\n\nClarke noted that the Philadelphia Police Department placed 72 officers on administrative leave in June after a nonprofit group published a review of personal Facebook posts or comments by officers in several U.S. police departments, including messages that were racist, Islamophobic and identified with right-wing militia groups.\n\n___\n\nFollow Michael Kunzelman on Twitter at: https://twitter.com/Kunzelman75 .", "description": "A Connecticut police officer's membership in the Proud Boys, a far-right group known for engaging in violent clashes at political rallies, didn't violate", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/15/e79ddd_proud-boys-police-officer-19022-in-nov-14-2018-photo-east-hampton-conn-police-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
