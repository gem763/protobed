I do not have further details to share on the meeting,\" said State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus, who is travelling with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Rome.", "description": "North carries out ninth launch since June, with one projectile said to have fallen into Japanese waters", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/2/67ec4061314641d099c8df26d7f6aaab_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
