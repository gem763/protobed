It's really unbelievable. This is a Democrat party that increasingly is at war with the American constitution,\" Hawley said.\n\nHawley, who sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee, was responding to a number of Democratic presidential candidates and members of Congress who have called for Kavanaugh's impeachment in recent days. The calls come after a since-corrected report in The New York Times alleging sexual misconduct by the Supreme Court justice when he was a student at Yale University.\n\nThe report was adapted from a story in a soon-to-be-published book by New York Times reporters Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly. It was based on the account of a witness and did not initially disclose that several friends of the alleged victim of the misconduct, who did not speak to The Times, said she did not recall the incident.\n\nHawley did not address the specifics of the Kavanaugh report, instead focusing his ire on what he called the broader assaults against the Judiciary.\n\n\"I mean they\u2019re willing to destroy an entire branch of government, the independent judiciary they want to destroy it why? Because it won\u2019t rule the way they want it too. I mean is there anything more dangerous to constitutional government than that way of thinking.\"\n\nThe Missouri senator continued, \"My message to my Democrat colleagues would be look its an independent judiciary, sooner or later you\u2019ll have your chance to appoint judges to the bench and you should appoint qualified judges to do so but don\u2019t destroy people and institutions in order to try and get your way. I mean that\u2019s just not who we are as Americans.\"", "description": "Missouri Senator Josh Hawley ripped Democratic calls to impeach Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh during an exclusive interview with Hill.TV.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/hawleyjosh_061119gn_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
