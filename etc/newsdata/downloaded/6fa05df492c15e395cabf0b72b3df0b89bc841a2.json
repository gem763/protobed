In Q2, personal consumption expenditures \u2013 which represents 70% of GDP \u2014 jumped 4.7%. And bolstering the consumer has been a labor market creating over 100,000 jobs almost every month for nearly a decade.\n\nBut that narrative may be changing.\n\nIn August, the U.S. economy added just 130,000 jobs. The three-month moving average now sits at 156,000, down from 241,000 a year ago.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a deceleration in job growth,\u201d Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAML) economist Joe Song said on Yahoo Finance\u2019s The Ticker. \u201cWe are starting to see some concerning signs that the economy is starting to slow. And we are returning back to trend... We\u2019re already in a fragile environment, and you have concerns about the trade war actually spilling over into the broader domestic economy. So we\u2019re a bit concerned.\u201d\n\nCiting new spending data on Wednesday, BAML economists wrote: \u201cThe consumer is beginning to worry.\u201d BAML\u2019s economics team sources their insights from the bank\u2019s credit and debit card activity.\n\n\u201cAfter a strong month of spending in July, consumers tightened the strings of their wallets in August,\u201d they said. \u201cBased on the aggregated BAC credit and debit card data, retail sales ex-autos fell 0.5% month-over-month seasonally-adjusted.\u201d\n\nAugust had its fair share of distortions. July promotions \u2014 highlighted by Amazon Prime Day \u2014 likely pulled forward some sales out of August. And the threat of Hurricane Dorian had consumers hoarding more essentials than usual. The underlying data is still worrisome.\n\n\u201cBottom line: our data show that August was a difficult month for the retailers,\u201d the economists said.\n\nThis puts all eyes be on the official August retail sales report, set to be published by the Census Bureau on Friday morning.\n\nBy Sam Ro, managing editor.
