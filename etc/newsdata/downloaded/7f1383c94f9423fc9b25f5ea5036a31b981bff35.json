Rather, it shoots whatever you feed it, free of hiccups, misfires, or misfeeds.\n\nAnd the pistol is accurate. The precision trigger, X-Ray3 sights, and G-10 grips, all work together to deliver rounds on target down range time after time after time.\n\nThe P938 Legion is a great option for someone looking for refinement combined with unquestioned reliability in a micro-compact 9mm pistol.\n\nAWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.
