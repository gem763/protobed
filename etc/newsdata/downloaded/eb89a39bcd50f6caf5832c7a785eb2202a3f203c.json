There are a lot of loopholes and the rules aren\u2019t strictly enforced,\u201d said Shirley Platzer, a Solana Beach resident.\n\nHow much would you wager that Shirley\u2019s never actually been to a gun show at the Del Mar Fairgrounds, or any other gun show in California? There are no \u201cloopholes\u201d at the Crossroads of the West Gun Show. Not only does every gun sale go through a background check, but every sale is subject to California\u2019s 10-day waiting period for firearms. Nobody is walking out of the gun show with a new firearm unless they actually went through the background check and purchased the firearm from a retailer at least a week and a half earlier, and made arrangements to pick it up at the gun show. Gun control activists like Shirley should be praising the laws surrounding California\u2019s gun shows, but instead they\u2019re still trying to shut down gun shows entirely.\n\nThese efforts by gun control activists, including lawmakers who are attempting to ban gun shows through legislation, are blatant attempts to erode a culture of lawful gun ownership in the state. Make it as hard as possible to own a gun, to buy a gun, and to train with a gun, and you\u2019ll have fewer Californians who make the effort to exercise their constitutional rights.\n\nWith the gun show returning to the Del Mar Fairgrounds, Assemblymember Todd Gloria, who issued legislation that would ban the sale of guns and ammunition at the Del Mar fairgrounds, released the following statement: \u201cThe return of the gun shows to the Del Mar Fairgrounds is disappointing despite overwhelming community concern, consistent support from California voters for tighter gun restrictions, and the increase in mass shootings throughout the country. This is emblematic of the \u2018guns over people\u2019 mentality that I believe must be addressed. Fortunately, the fight is not yet over. I believe the misguided court decision that led to the return of the gun show will be overturned and I am hopeful Governor Newsom will sign into law our bill to end the gun shows at the Fairgrounds once and for all. The time for thoughts and prayers are over. It\u2019s time for action and for us to prioritize people over guns.\u201d\n\nAgain, there is no difference between someone selling a gun at a gun show in California and someone buying a gun at a gun store in California. Gloria\u2019s being incredibly disingenuous here, and he veers into outright dishonesty when he claims that allowing a gun show to take place at a government-owned facility is somehow indicative of \u201cguns over people\u201d. What he and other protestors really want is to put gun prohibitionists ahead of supporters of the 2nd Amendment, and to put insurmountable barriers between Californians and the rights they hold dear.", "description": "The Crossroads of the West Gun Show returned to southern California's Del-Mar Fairgrounds this weekend, with crowded aisles and protests outside.", "authors": ["Cam Edwards", "Author'S Bio", "Cam Edwards Has Covered The Amendment For More Than Years As A Broadcast", "Online Journalist", "As Well As The Co-Author Of", "Heavy Lifting", "Grow Up", "Get A Job", "Start A Family", "Other Manly Advice"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2016/37/dcf3aa6e-ca3e-45f0-bb29-2fe6b6d9c0e6.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
