At Snap, the common shares offered as part of its IPO had no voting rights at all; its 2018 annual report said its co-founders controlled 97 percent of the voting power. Neumann\u2019s shares at one point granted him 20 votes per share; that figure dropped to 10 votes per share before he stepped down as CEO.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe exit package is largely about control, said corporate governance experts. The buyout offer and hefty consulting fee from SoftBank, WeWork\u2019s largest outside investor, likely helped to loosen Neumann\u2019s iron grip. The leasing start-up has seen its valuation implode, scrapped its ill-fated initial public offering and is preparing to layoff at least a couple thousand employees, according to reports.\n\n\u201cAdam Neumann will essentially get a king\u2019s ransom for grossly mismanaging the company on his way out,\u201d said Amy Borrus, deputy director of the Council of Institutional Investors. \u201cThis is a cautionary tale about the dangers of the dual-class share structure.\u201d\n\nThe package includes the ability for Neumann to sell up to $970 million of his shares as part of a tender offer and receive a $185 million consulting fee over four years. He will also get access to a $500 million loan to repay a credit line, said a source familiar with the package granted anonymity to speak about the terms of the deal.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCompanies that have multi-class share arrangements argue they protect long-term strategies and insulate founders from early meddling by activist investors. But shareholders say founders who hold these high-voting shares can control the outcome of any investor vote, and decide who gets on the board. Investors who want to oust a founder would have a hard time unless they bought out his or her stock, lowering their voting power.\n\nLast year, the Council of Institutional Investors, which primarily represents investors such as state and local pension funds, foundations and endowments, petitioned the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq to automatically convert listed companies to a one-share, one-vote structure no more than seven years following the IPO. This summer, it also began calling out directors who were on boards of companies at the time of an IPO that had unequal voting rights and no \u201csunset provision\u201d on the multi-class structure.\n\nSuch share arrangements also give CEOs much more power when it comes to negotiating their exits, said Charles Elson, the executive director of a corporate governance center at the University of Delaware. In a typical CEO departure, you\u2019re \u201cnegotiating with someone who has a few cards,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a time where you\u2019re negotiating with someone who holds the whole deck.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nElson noted that Neumann\u2019s ability to sell $970 million of stock in the tender offer is more of a buyout than a payout. \u201cThey\u2019re buying his stock \u2014 that\u2019s what they\u2019re doing. They\u2019re buying out his interest.\u201d\n\nthe $185 million consulting fee, which will be paid out over four years and includes a noncompete agreement, raised eyebrows from Elson and other governance experts. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the most significant severance packages I\u2019m aware of,\u201d he said.\n\nSoftBank declined to comment about criticism over the size of the package. In a news release, it said Neumann will become a \u201cboard observer,\u201d that the size of the board will be expanded, and the board will receive voting control over Neumann\u2019s shares. WeWork declined to comment.\n\nAD\n\nLaurie Hays, a spokeswoman for Neumann, said in a statement that Neumann \u201cwill recognize the same value for his shares as every other employee and investor tendering into the SoftBank $3 billion offer. He will use a portion of his potential proceeds to pay down debt, some of which was incurred on behalf of the company. WeWork is a company with close to $4 billion in revenue that without Adam would not exist.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nShe said that Neumann has not decided how much stock he will sell and that a condition of the loan is that it will be repaid with proceeds from any stock sales, noting he has drawn down $395 million from the credit line. Regarding the consulting fee, she said, \u201cthat is the price the board decided was worth Adam staying close and not starting a competing business\u201d and noted the board voted on management decisions.\n\nWeWork is a private company, but Neumann\u2019s \u201cconsulting fee\u201d blasts past the value of most severance payments bestowed on public company CEOs. An analysis of all change-in-control payments made to CEOs between 2005 and 2015 by the research firm Equilar found that the highest potential payment amid a merger was to former Gillette CEO James Kilts, at $165 million.\n\nAD\n\nMeanwhile, at $185 million \u2014 or $46 million a year \u2014 Neumann\u2019s fee would be nearly four times the median S & P500 CEO\u2019s annual full-time compensation of $12 millionin 2018. In addition, consulting or advisory fees paid to departing CEOs of public companies are typically a fraction of the one being paid to Neumann, Equilar data showed.\n\nAD\n\nNell Minow, vice chairman of the governance consulting firm ValueEdge Advisers, said SoftBank was likely to face questions from investors about the deal with Neumann, and \u201cthey deserve answers,\u201d she said. \u201cThat will be a very tense conversation, I think.\u201d\n\nRosanna Landis Weaver, an executive compensation expert for the nonprofit As You Sow, said her questions weren\u2019t just about the new deal, but about how such outsized voting rights were originally granted.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cNo board should agree to 20-to-1 voting rights. No investor should invest in something where someone has that much control,\u201d she said. It\u2019s an illustration, she said, of \u201cwhy you want to have good corporate governance \u2014 so you\u2019re not painted into a corner.\u201d\n\nRead also:\n\nAD", "description": "Despite its stunning collapse, the company\u2019s unorthodox and charismatic founder and former CEO, Adam Neumann, could still walk away with up to $1.2 billion.", "authors": ["Jena Mcgregor", "Reporter Covering Leadership Issues In The Headlines"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/a34gmlPeXdU3pL_fR4IbysiZVQY=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4UW46LXVGEI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
