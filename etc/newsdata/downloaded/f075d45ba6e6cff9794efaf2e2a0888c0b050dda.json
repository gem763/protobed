The letter cites concerns that Waterfront is under \u201cimmense pressure\u201d to hatch a deal behind closed doors to satisfy Sidewalk\u2019s proposal to build beyond the allotted piece of Waterfront land, which Diamond said in his letter to the company was \u201cpremature.\u201d (The Logic)\n\nTalking point: Waterfront Toronto has until October 31 to decide whether it will keep working with Sidewalk as an \u201cinnovation and funding partner\u201d for the waterfront development. The open letter, spearheaded by resident-led group #BlockSidewalk, notes that the extra public land Sidewalk requested\u2014and at a discount\u2014isn\u2019t Waterfront\u2019s to give. And while negotiations are wrapping up, the group criticized Waterfront for closing the public out of the process that will determine the fate of the publicly funded lands.", "description": "", "authors": ["Catherine Mcintyre"], "top_image": "https://thelogic.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/WP_Logo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
