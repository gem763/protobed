Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), who represents much of the city.\n\nTrump attacked Cummings\u2019 7th Congressional District after his comments about inhumane conditions at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nAs the president geared up on Thursday to make his first visit to the city since his slew of insults, protesters prepped the downtown streets for his arrival, inflating a giant depiction of Trump as a rat and changing the name of Baltimore\u2019s President Street to President Barack Obama Avenue.\n\nThe Trump rat balloon was placed in view of the Waterfront Marriott, where the president spoke Thursday evening as part of his two days attending the House Republican Conference retreat.\n\nAs Trump\u2019s motorcade sped through the streets, dozens of protesters jeered and waved rat-themed props.\n\nOne woman posted a video on Twitter saying the president waved in response:\n\nBREAKING: Trump has arrived. He, ummm, waved at the protestors.

According to the White House, the president had no plans in Baltimore beyond his speech, which ended up mostly being about his accomplishments as president.\n\nThe Baltimore Sun reported that Trump rehashed his criticisms of the city toward the end of his speech, saying, \u201cWe\u2019re going to fight for the future of cities like Baltimore that have been destroyed by decades of failed and corrupt rule.\u201d\n\nHe also called the \u201cgreat American cities\u201d of Los Angeles and San Francisco \u201can embarrassment\u201d at the hands of Democratic officials and said \u201cRepublicans want to rebuild our inner cities and provide a future of limitless opportunity for all Americans.\u201d", "description": "Donald Trump infamously called the city a \"disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess.\"", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7ade4c3b00002b88d1dbb6.jpeg?cache=x29jczewa0&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
