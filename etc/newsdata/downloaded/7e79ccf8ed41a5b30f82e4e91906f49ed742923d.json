(AP) - Most of the focus on Denver heading into the season opener was on how coach Vic Fangio and quarterback Joe Flacco would fare in their Broncos debut.\n\nThere seemed to be few questions surrounding the strength of the team in star pass rushers Von Miller and Bradley Chubb.\n\nBut with that dangerous duo neutralized by an improved Oakland offensive line led by big-ticket free agent Trent Brown, the Broncos came out flat in the opener and lost 24-16 to the Raiders on Monday night, ending the NFL\u2019s longest opening week winning streak at seven games.\n\n\u201cI was extremely disappointed in the loss but not discouraged,\u201d Fangio said after his first game as an NFL head coach. \u201cOnce you see some of the mistakes we made, or plays we didn\u2019t make, that we can see we can be better than we played tonight.\u201d\n\nThe offense led by Flacco struggled to close out drives and didn\u2019t reach the end zone until the closing minutes, settling for field goals on three earlier trips to the red zone. The special teams allowed a long kick return that set up Oakland\u2019s last score.\n\nBut the most surprising aspect of the game was the lack of pass rush from Miller and Chubb. The Raiders allowed 52 sacks last season and it figured they would have trouble dealing with that tandem, even after adding Brown at right tackle in free agency to team with second-year left tackle Kolton Miller.\n\nBut Miller and Chubb never even got close to Derek Carr as the Broncos recorded no sacks and no quarterback hits the entire game. Carr mostly got rid of the ball quickly but did hold onto it for a few deep shots and went 22 for 26 for 259 yards against a defense that should be one of the better ones in the league.\n\n\u201cMy job is to sack the quarterback and I didn\u2019t get to him once, not even a quarterback hit,\u201d Miller said. \u201cDisappointed in myself on an individual level. They were throwing the ball quick, but we have to find a way to get there.\u201d\n\nThe offense predictably struggled at times as Flacco looked more like the quarterback who wore out his welcome in Baltimore the last couple of years than the one who was a Super Bowl MVP following the 2012 season. Denver struggled to get much going at all early in the game, going three-and-out on its first drive and failing to score any points in the first half.\n\nFlacco took a sack to knock Denver out of field goal range in the second quarter and a holding penalty late in the half on rookie tight end Noah Fant forced Brandon McManus into a 64-yard try off the infield dirt that fell short.\n\nThe offense picked it up in the second half with scores on four of five possessions. But an inability to finish those drives with touchdowns ultimately proved to be the difference.\n\n\u201cAs ugly as it was for us in the first half, we fought really hard,\u201d Flacco said. \u201cAt the end of the day it ended up being they were able to score when they got the ball down there and keep the momentum of the drive and we weren\u2019t.\u201d\n\nDenver drove down to the 6 on the first drive of the third quarter before Flacco was sacked by Benson Mayowa on third down, leading to a field goal.\n\nThe Broncos drove inside the 10 again on the next drive but DaeSean Hamilton dropped a pass in the end zone on third down, leading to another field goal.\n\nFlacco took a third sack on third-and-2 from the 14 in the fourth quarter, leading to Denver\u2019s third field goal of the night and by the time the Broncos finally scored a touchdown on Flacco\u2019s 1-yard pass to Emmanuel Sanders with 2:15 to play it wasn\u2019t enough.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t see much that was good obviously,\u201d Fangio said of the red-zone offense. \u201cWe didn\u2019t make the plays down there. That was really a big difference in the game in spite of everything else. They scored touchdowns and we didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nFangio opted to kick it deep with his team trailing by eight and holding three timeouts, but the Raiders converted two first downs and ran out the clock.\n\n\u201cDisappointed but we\u2019re not discouraged,\u201d Miller said. \u201cFirst game of the season. Hats off to the Raiders, they outplayed us today.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Most of the focus on Denver heading into the season opener was on how coach Vic Fangio and quarterback Joe Flacco would fare in their Broncos debut.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Josh Dubow"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/10/broncos_raiders_football_35100_c0-125-3000-1874_s1770x1032.jpg?f52fad753beb582a85b1710fc9f6c2ec1ddbd99f", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
