The pages discussed politics in various regions, including the U.S.\n\nFacebook was tipped off to the fake accounts by FireEye, a U.S. cybersecurity firm.\n\nChina: While neither platform has uncovered a misinformation campaign originating from China targeting the U.S., experts say we should be prepared for something along those lines.\n\nIn August, both Facebook and Twitter said that they uncovered hundreds of accounts originating from inside China that were a part of a coordinated effort to undermine political protests in Hong Kong. China is also blatantly intervening in elections in Taiwan.\n\nChris Johnson, a former top CIA China analyst now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, says there's no evidence China plans to intervene in the U.S. election on the scale of Russian in 2016, though.\n\nHe says we're more likely to see \"the usual\" from China, meaning efforts to influence Chinese-language audiences and the business community without taking drastic measures.\n\nThat's in part because Chinese leaders want to avoid the type of backlash Russia now faces, but also because they seem \"ambivalent\" about the prospect of Trump's re-election, Johnson says.\n\nBetween the lines: There are potentially billions of dollars at stake in 2020 for Iran, which is suffocating under U.S. sanctions and knows Democrats are keen to re-enter or renegotiate the 2015 nuclear deal.\n\nSaudi Arabia, Iran's rival, could have precisely the opposite incentive to intervene. It has close ties with Trump's White House but is viewed with hostility by leading Democrats.\n\nBut China sees the U.S. as \"dysfunctional\" internationally under Trump, Johnson says, and despite Trump's trade war, leaders in Beijing are unsure whether they'd be better off without him in the White House.\n\nWhat to watch: Still, there's reason to watch China's misinformation efforts closely. Researchers worry Beijing could leverage the growth of TikTok to spread misinformation in the U.S.\n\nGo deeper:\n\nThe misinformation age\n\nWelcome to our new synthetic realities\n\nMisinformation haunts 2020 primaries", "description": "Keeping a wary eye on China and Iran.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/lEoLjYo31O3vE3fWYObqqlvBHLQ=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/09/17/1568679335358.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
