Miller's book of the same name, the show will follow American bomber pilots of the US Eighth Air Force who, on a daily basis, risked flying at 25,000 feet in freezing air \u2014 in broad daylight \u2014 to bring the fight to Hitler's doorstep.\n\nThree years (1942-1945) of death-defying bombing runs by the Eighth's Flying Fortresses over cities like Berlin, Dresden and Hanover were, for much of the war, the only battles Allied forces waged inside the territorial borders of Nazi Germany.\n\nThe Eighth's effort to pry Europe from the claws of the Third Reich \u2014 one that included unleashing 697,000 tons of bombs \u2014 proved to be overwhelmingly costly. By war's end, over 47,000 of the 115,000 US Army Air Force casualties were from the Eighth.\n\nIn the summer of 1943, Oscar-winning director William Wyler (\"Ben-Hur\") and a film crew embedded with men from the Eighth to film air combat missions aboard Boeing B-17s. The footage Wyler's group captured would eventually become the 1944 World War II documentary, \"The Memphis Belle: A story of a Flying Fortress.\"\n\nOne of Wyler's own camera crew, Harold Tannenbaum, was killed during the filming process.\n\nMost recently, director Erik Nelson resurrected Wyler's footage for a new documentary, \"The Cold Blue,\" a film dedicated to the heroic actions of the men of the \"Mighty Eighth\" who stared down death each time they climbed into their cockpits and bombardier enclosures and took to the sky.\n\nJoining Spielberg and Hanks on the aviation-centered series is \"Band of Brothers\" writer John Orloff, who also served as a consultant on \"The Pacific.\"\n\n\"Masters of the Air\" is projected to run about eight episodes long, according to Deadline, with production costs that could exceed $200 million.\n\nThe trilogy's first two installments, \"Band of Brothers\" and \"The Pacific,\" earned over 40 Emmy nominations, taking home 14 of the awards.", "description": "\"Masters of the Air\" will follow bomber pilots of the US Eighth Air Force who conducted dangerous daylight bombing raids on Germany from 1942 to 1945.", "authors": ["J.D.
