A second policeman was recently discovered to have been injured in the attack.\n\nTwo Russian agents, Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, were identified as the likely culprits. However, they later appeared on Russia\u2019s state-funded TV station RT, claiming they visited the \u201cwonderful\u201d English city as tourists to see its cathedral.\n\nPlanes, trains and fake names: the trail left by Skripal suspects Read more\n\nTrump has been pursued over his relationship with Russia ever since allegations emerged that the country colluded with the Trump presidential campaign in 2016. The Robert Mueller report, which examined the claims, concluded Russia had been attempting to swing the presidential election in favour of Trump, but did not say whether there had been collusion.\n\nStephen Gethins, a Scottish National party member of the foreign affairs select committee, said: \u201cThe evidence of Russian involvement in the poisoning of Mr Skripal and his daughter is overwhelming. It was an appalling chemical weapons attack that should horrify us all.\n\n\u201cWhat is just as worrying is that Boris Johnson wants to align the UK closer to Donald Trump with his discredited foreign policy. Our closest foreign policy partners are and should remain those in the EU. We need to work with our partners in Europe to stand up to Putin\u2019s bullying of Russia\u2019s neighbours as well as attacks on human rights and democracy activists domestically.\u201d\n\nAt the time of the Skripal poisoning, Jeremy Corbyn caused a backlash among his own MPs after appearing to question the evidence that Moscow was behind the Salisbury attack. Corbyn warned that the government should not be \u201crushing way ahead of the evidence\u201d over the poisoning and warned of a drift towards a \u201cnew cold war\u201d with Russia.", "description": "The US president reportedly disputed UK\u2019s \u2018overwhelming evidence\u2019 of Russian involvement in Salisbury attack", "authors": ["Michael Savage"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc00e4c604ef02496a5ef92dcd2647ed2bdf2a08/0_303_1764_1058/master/1764.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b40929a983f1399e95edf2124601d466", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
