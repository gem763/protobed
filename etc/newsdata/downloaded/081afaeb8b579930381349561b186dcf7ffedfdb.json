The systems allow for early spotting of intercontinental ballistic missiles.\n\nChina celebrates 70th anniversary as Xi warns \u2018no force can shake great nation\u2019 Read more\n\nSpeaking at an international affairs conference in Moscow on Thursday, Putin said Russia had been helping China develop such a system. He added that \u201cthis is a very serious thing that will radically enhance China\u2019s defence capability\u201d.\n\nHis statement signalled a new degree of defence cooperation between the two former Communist rivals that have developed increasingly close political and military ties while ties between Beijing and Washington have been strained by the trade war. In June, Chinese president Xi Jinping called Putin his \u201cbest and bosom friend,\u201d adding he cherished their \u201cdeep friendship.\u201d\n\nEarlier this week China debuted new military hardware including a \u201chypersonic\u201d missile experts believe could be difficult for the US to counter. The missile, known as the DF-17, can in theory manoeuvre sharply at many times the speed of sound, making it extremely difficult to defend against.\n\nIn August China and Russia accused the United States of stoking a new arms race by testing a cruise missile, just weeks after Washington withdrew from a cold-war era missile control treaty that would have barred the test launch.\n\nNow that Putin is Xi\u2019s \u2018best and bosom friend\u2019, where does that leave the west?
