REUTERS/Maxim Shemetov\n\nBEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanon\u2019s President Michel Aoun warned on Friday that Israel would bear the consequences of any attack, days after a flare-up at the border between Israel and Iran-backed Hezbollah.\n\nThe frontier between the two countries has remained calm since Israel and Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah traded fire on Sunday.\n\nIsrael\u2019s military said it had responded with fire into south Lebanon after anti-tank missiles targeted an army base and vehicles. Hezbollah said its fighters destroyed an Israeli armored vehicle, killing and wounding those inside, though Israel said there were no casualties.\n\nHezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said this week that the episode had ended but had launched a \u201cnew phase\u201d in which his Shi\u2019ite Muslim movement would target Israeli drones that breach Lebanon\u2019s airspace.\n\nThe long-time enemies, who last fought a month-long war in 2006, had been on alert after two drones crashed in a Beirut suburb that Hezbollah largely dominates. Nasrallah deemed the Aug. 25 incident an Israeli attack.\n\nAoun, a political ally of Hezbollah, has likened the crash of the drones, including one that exploded, to a \u201cdeclaration of war\u201d.\n\n\u201cAny attack on Lebanon\u2019s sovereignty ... will be met with legitimate self-defense which Israel will bear all the consequences of,\u201d Aoun\u2019s office cited him as saying on Friday in a meeting with U.N.
