Bernie Sanders. | Scott Eisen/Getty Images 2020 Elections Sanders unveils plan to tax companies with high-earning CEOs\n\nBernie Sanders has a new plan to reduce the widening gap between the rich and poor.\n\nThe presidential candidate and decadeslong crusader against income inequality unveiled a proposal Monday to raise taxes on businesses whose CEOs make at least 50 times more than their median workers.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe boost in corporate taxes would be imposed on companies that bring in $100 million or more in annual revenue.\n\n\u201cThe American people are sick and tired of corporate CEOs who now make 300 times more than their average employees, while they give themselves huge bonuses and cut back on the health care and pension benefits of their employees,\u201d Sanders said in a statement. \u201cIt is time to send a message to corporate America: If you do not end your greed and corruption, we will end it for you.\u201d\n\nAccording to government data released this month, income inequality in the U.S. is at its highest point in at least 50 years.\n\nSanders also introduced a wealth tax plan last week in hopes of lessening the nation\u2019s divide in fortunes. His presidential primary opponent Sen. Elizabeth Warren proposed a wealth tax early this year. Both candidates have expressed support for wealth taxes before this year.\n\nCOUNTDOWN TO 2020 The race for 2020 starts now. Stay in the know. Follow our presidential election coverage.
