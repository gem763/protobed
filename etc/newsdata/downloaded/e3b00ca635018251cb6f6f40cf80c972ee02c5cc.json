Treasuries fell Thursday amid a global government bond rout triggered by a combination of US-China trade calm and Brexit optimism which sent the Pound soaring.\n\nThe pain trade is a point of reaction and how the market reprices both the Fed and the ten-year U.S. Treasury yields on a positive trade talk outcome.\n\nOil markets\n\nCrude rose after OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo said members and allies including Russia would do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to prevent another oil slump as the global economy weakens.\n\nJawboning aside, at a minimum it reaffirms OPEC + position and supply discipline to do what is necessary to support oil prices that have been severely undermined by slowing global growth.\n\nAlso, OPEC reported that oil markets were in the most considerable supply deficit since 2007 as OPEC exacted deeper production cuts.\n\nBut its possible optimism around trade talks is what continues to steer the tanker. The US is the largest global consumer of oil while China, the biggest driver of year-on-year oil demand growth. So, it would seem logical that the most significant sentiment driver hinges on the outcome of the trade talks which if end on a positive note could go along way to begin to repair the economic damage done as a result of the protracted US-China trade war and these economic powerhouses would need more oil .\n\nGold markets\n\nGold has lost a lot of momentum as we await the outcome of the U.S.-China trade talks\n\nTrade talk optimism, rising U.S. Treasury yields and a divided Fed which suggests October rate cut might not be such a done deal, continues to lean on record long ETF gold-backed investor positions.\n\nA worst-case scenario for gold?\n\nAnd while the market current base-case scenario suggest a pre-emptive 2019 Fed interest rate cut is in the cards, the issue for Gold markets is if we are entering the first phase of a tariff unwind, the Fed could still cut in October but reiterate this is still a mid-cycle adjustment implying a hawkish cut which could seriously undermine gold market.", "description": "As US-China trade negotiators are about to order the last call at the Last Chance Saloon, the fog of trade war is beginning to lift giving way to an air of trade optimism sweeping through global capital markets.", "authors": ["Stephen Innes"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/jmxW97RGCfBneDTFW0ETUQ--~B/aD00NjA7dz04MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/fx_empire_176/6bfee895e20919b81f250a0b5f3cc18a", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
