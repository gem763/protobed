From the re-drawn lips to the massive beehive hair and the elaborate corset, it\u2019s a costume that Antoinette herself \u2014 the Austrian wife of King Louis XVI in the late 18th century \u2014 would surely have approved of, given the ill-fated historical figure\u2019s known penchant for pastels and hyper-feminine attire.\n\nAntoinette\u2019s character in history is clouded by her unique predilections \u2014 crystallized in pop culture in the Sofia Coppola movie starring Kirsten Dunst \u2014 and her demise; she was famous for supposedly saying \u201cLet them eat cake!\u201d to the starving citizenry of her country, before she was executed and the French Revolution took hold. Perhaps that makes it all the more appropriate as a Halloween costume, then, with its allusions to troubled grandeur and a scary end.\n\nAs for Lovato, she switched things up on the next evening of her Halloween festivities, opting for a clown costume as the terrifying Pennywise from It for a party she hosted \u2014 with full face makeup to match once more. We do love an adaptable queen. And there are still a few days until the actual day of Halloween, which means plenty more costume changes could be in store. Lovato, whose last album Tell Me You Love Me came out in 2017, has been slowly returning to the spotlight this season after taking time away.", "description": "Marie Antoinette and Pennywise have arrived", "authors": ["Raisa Bruner"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/YkP9cjKlx4fbNkEpdKXUnw--~B/aD02ODM7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/53c5655633bc070627560b5635769b98", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
