Not the latest kale salad,\u201d Peter Luger co-owner Jody Storch said on Tuesday in the wake of the blistering critique by Times restaurant reviewer Pete Wells.\n\nWATCH: RESTAURANT PATRON WRAPS PORTERHOUSE IN NAPKIN, LEAVES WITHOUT PAYING BILL\n\nThe searing review began trending nationwide on Twitter on Tuesday after Wells gave the fabled institution an abysmal zero-star review \u2014 describing the South Williamsburg eatery\u2019s porterhouse as \u201cfar from the best New York has to offer.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd after I\u2019ve paid, there is the unshakable sense that I\u2019ve been scammed,\u201d Wells wrote on Tuesday under the headline \u201cPeter Luger used to sizzle. Now it sputters.\u201d\n\nBut Storch said the Times had reviewed the restaurant many times in the past \u2014 sometimes giving them four stars, sometimes less.\n\n\u201cWhile the reviewers and their whims have changed, Lugers has always focused on doing one thing exceptionally well \u2014 serving the highest quality of steak \u2014 with a member of our family buying every piece of USDA Prime beef individually, just as we have done for decades,\u201d Storch said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\nAnother waiter who has worked at the restaurant for three decades told The Post he thought the Times had nothing nice to say about Peter Luger for 50 years.\n\n\u201cNothing is good enough,\u201d said the man, who declined to be named. \u201cWhen [Wells] was here taking pictures, we had bets in the back on how much garbage he was going to write.\u201d\n\nThe man said the food was \u201cbetter than ever\u201d and called the owners \u201cmeticulous\u201d about the quality of the meat.\n\n\u201cThe meat has always been our prime objective. We only have steak. If you go to a steakhouse to eat fish, then what are you doing?\u201d he asked, referencing Wells\u2019 review of the \u201cdry and almost powdery\u201d sole.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe review sparked a chorus of consensus online from other unsatisfied diners, who agree the lauded steak icon, which opened in 1887, is no longer worth the long waits and seismic bills.\n\n\u201cI feel like that Peter Luger review has been coming for a while now,\u201d wrote Phil Hughes on Twitter, calling the restaurant \u201cwildly forgettable in every way.\u201d\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Post.", "description": "The New York Times' restaurant review of the steakhouse started trending on Tuesday, after restaurant critic\u00a0Pete Wells gave the fabled institution an abysmal zero-star review", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/PeterLugerPatCarrollNYDailyNewsArchiveviaGettyImagesCROP.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
