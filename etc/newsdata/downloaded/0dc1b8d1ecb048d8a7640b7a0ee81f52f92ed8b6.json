Learn the techniques and make some for your halloween party this year. Grateful\n\n\u2018Tis the season for pumpkin spice, candy corn, hayrides, spooky stories and, of course, Halloween costumes. Whether you like dressing up to take your kids trick-or-treating or you have a slew of Halloween parties to attend, coming up with a good costume can be overwhelming. Why not let your star sign guide you? Use your astrological sign to find your perfect Halloween costume.\n\nARIES\n\nTap into your loud and proud side this Halloween. Aries know what they want and go after it, and you can let your costume reflect that. Dress up as your favorite superhero or in one of fellow Aries Lady Gaga\u2019s iconic looks. Rolling up to a party in a meat dress would definitely scratch that itch for attention you sometimes feel.\n\nTAURUS\n\nTaureans are traditional, romantic, strong and stable people. A classic Halloween costume can highlight those qualities. Channel your inner romantic and dress up as a princess, queen or Venus herself. Your sign is ruled by her after all.\n\nGEMINI\n\nGeminis are multifaceted, smart and witty. Your choice of Halloween costume could really play this up and get people talking to you when out and about celebrating. Use that cheeky love of pop culture and dress up as your own version of \u201cHot Girl Summer.\u201d Or emulate some Gemini icons and dress up as the Olsen twins or Stevie Nicks.\n\nMore:Mister Rogers gets sexy in booty shorts with Halloween costume. Consider childhood ruined\n\nCANCER\n\nCancers are sweet and emotional, and they love nostalgia. If you have enough people in your family or group of friends, be the Scooby Doo gang for Halloween. If you\u2019re a solo millennial, dress up as the iconic \u201890s heroine Sailor Moon (she was a Cancer herself). Or go as the Sailor Scouts with a group of friends if you feel like being sentimental together.\n\nLEO\n\nLeos love a chance to shine, and Halloween is no exception. It\u2019s the perfect time to be dramatic, attention-grabbing and fun. The best way to do this is with a well-executed costume of someone everyone knows and loves and will be excited to see. Think Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen, Harry Potter or Wonder Woman.\n\nVIRGO\n\nVirgos are precise, detailed, and bookish, so why not use that and be Virgo icon Hermione Granger for Halloween? She embodies all that is wonderful about the Virgo spirit. Or if you\u2019re looking for something with a bit more flair, channel another Virgo queen and dress up as Beyonc\u00e9. Flawless.\n\nMore:10 family Halloween costume ideas that are easy\n\nLIBRA\n\nLibras love romance, balance and partnership, making it the perfect sign to tackle a couple\u2019s costume. You and your boo can be an iconic couple like Jim and Pam from The Office (very little effort required), Shrek and Fiona, or a prince and princess if you\u2019re feeling conventional. If you\u2019re doing Halloween solo, get your girl gang together for a group costume like the Spice Girls or the cast of GLOW.\n\nSCORPIO\n\nScorpios, this is your season. Halloween is the perfect time to showcase all that makes you dark, powerful, sexy and intense. A classic vampire or devil would be a fantastic costume for you. Or if you\u2019re feeling a little kookier, dress up as someone from The Addams Family.\n\nMore: Skeleton Halloween makeup: A step-by-step tutorial\n\nSAGITTARIUS\n\nSagittarians can really display their fun, free-spirited, wild and adventurous nature with their Halloween costumes. Think Amelia Earhart, Indiana Jones and Princess Leia. Or use your love of laughter and be something a bit more playful but equally free-spirited like Beetlejuice. Want to scare people? Try this can-in-head makeup costume.\n\nCAPRICORN\n\nCapricorns, you are strong and powerful. Let your costume show that off. Try Rey from Star Wars, Katniss Everdeen from The Hunger Games, or one of the Starks from Game of Thrones.\n\nAQUARIUS\n\nAquarians are futuristic and humanistic, if a bit offbeat. Space and technology are all considered Aquarian realms, so why not use that in your Halloween costume and be a character from Star Wars or Star Trek? Or if you aren\u2019t feeling the whole space theme, be someone quirky and sweet like Edward Scissorhands.\n\nPISCES\n\nPisces are emotional, dreamy creatures who can often find themselves lost in their own fantasy worlds. Put that to good use in your Halloween costume. Dress up like a fairy or a mermaid, or the ultimate dreamer herself, Dorothy from The Wizard of Oz (which will also hit you with that nostalgia you love so much).\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/grateful/2019/10/09/halloween-costume-ideas-2019-horoscopes/3920578002/", "description": "Coming up with a good costume can be overwhelming.
