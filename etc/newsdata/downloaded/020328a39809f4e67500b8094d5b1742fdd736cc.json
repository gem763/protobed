The two other cases challenging the CFPB\u2019s structure are making their way through circuit courts.\n\nAs a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, current Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote an opinion in October 2016 declaring the agency\u2019s leadership structure unconstitutional.\n\n\u201cBecause the Director alone heads the agency without Presidential supervision, and in light of the CFPB's broad authority over the U.S. economy, the Director enjoys significantly more unilateral power than any single member of any other independent agency,\u201d Kavanaugh wrote in the opinion for a three-judge panel.\n\nKavanaugh advocated severing the for-cause removal provision from the law rather than striking down Dodd-Frank in its entirety. The agency\u2019s constitutionality was later upheld in an banc rehearing of the case, meaning it was decided by all the circuit court's judges.\n\nConsumer Bankers Association President and CEO Richard Hunt cheered the news that the high court would consider the Seila Law case.\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court will finally put the constitutionality of the CFPB\u2019s leadership structure to rest, but regardless of the outcome, a sole director calling all the shots will never provide the long-term stability consumers deserve and the well-regulated financial sector needs,\u201d Hunt said. \u201cFor that, Congress must create a bipartisan, Senate-confirmed commission to lead the Bureau.\u201d\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/37/d3/89803c464c578e43f79e192604d0/191-18-supreme-court-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
