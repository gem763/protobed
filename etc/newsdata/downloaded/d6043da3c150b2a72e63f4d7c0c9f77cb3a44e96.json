AAP\n\nThe last time the two leaders met was on the sidelines of the G20 in June. The FTA was discussed then too and both agreed to try to get it signed into law by the end of this year. But it is only this week the legislative path has become clear.\n\nIn Canberra, enabling bills are due to be voted on in the House of Representatives next week and will be debated in the Senate next month. Labor had pledged to renegotiate the deal if it had won the May election but is now considering giving the government the votes it needs to secure passage in the upper house in exchange for some amendments, despite reservations from some MPs and sections of the union movement.\n\nAnd in Jakarta, the FTA will have been tabled in parliament for 60 days by the end of November. It can then be ratified by either a parliament vote or Presidential degree.", "description": "Both countries on track to ratify the IA-CEPA by the end of the year.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2332%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_203%2C$y_60/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/c311f168703b5cabb5fecaae3fa489ac9749ee3c", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
