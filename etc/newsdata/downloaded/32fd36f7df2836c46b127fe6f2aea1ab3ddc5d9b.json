The currency's downward spiral doesn't appear to be intensifying any further for the time being,\u201d said Marc-Andr\u00e9 Fongern, FX and macro strategist at MAF Global Forex.\n\n\u201cSterling looks set to continue its slight upward trend over the coming days as the likelihood of Britain leaving the EU without a deal is indeed diminishing.\u201d\n\nNaeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets, said: \u201cThe current development has created enormous optimism among Sterling bulls today. Overall, it is safe to say that the momentum is strong for Sterling and the current change in the EU narrative has opened the door for a major rally.\u201d\n\nHe said sterling had seen its best weekly gain last week against the dollar since May.", "description": "European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker's comments gave markets hope Britain could avoid crashing out without a deal.", "authors": ["Tom Belger", "Finance", "Policy Reporter"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Ktdi.BVyyQIwDKuVuGSIsQ--~B/aD0xNzA0O3c9MjU2MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/54fa3e90-db7a-11e9-bfdf-43357c7a54d3", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
