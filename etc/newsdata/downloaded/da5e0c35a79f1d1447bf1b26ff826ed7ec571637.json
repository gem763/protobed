Halfway through the fourth quarter, OBJ had zero receptions for zero yards, a sign that he has been well-covered.\n\nBeckham obviously didn\u2019t like it much. Tension between him and Humphrey was brewing all game, and the two had some passionate exchanges after plays. It boiled over and came to blows in the third quarter, resulting in Humphrey choke-slamming Beckham to the ground while a referee watches it play out on the ground in front of him.\n\nSo what happened before that? In this video you can see Beckham trying to hook his leg around Humphrey\u2019s leg, presumably to bring him down to the ground so the choking would stop.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nMarlon Humphrey literally tried to kill OBJ pic.twitter.com/g74wQamnhN \u2014 NFL Humor (@NFLHumor) September 29, 2019\n\nEven that\u2019s not the whole story. It looks like OBJ tried to punch Humphrey before the choking began, near the start of the play.\n\nOBJ and Humphrey going at it. pic.twitter.com/r6bxIo0Uum \u2014 KingRablo NFL Pred(33-15) (@RichardJAdkins) September 29, 2019\n\nSo there was an attempted punch and then a brutal choke-slam. How did the referees handle all of this? Offsetting penalties and replaying the down. If that\u2019s what happens when a player puts his hands around another player\u2019s throat and slams him to the ground, I\u2019d hate to see what it would take for these referees to eject someone from the game.\n\nStory continues\n\nAfter the game, Beckham did offer up one regret:\n\n#Browns WR Odell Beckham downplayed his tussle with #Ravens CB Marlon Humphrey: \u201cI\u2019m just upset I lost my earring.\u201d \u2014 Mike Garafolo (@MikeGarafolo) September 29, 2019\n\nBrowns coach Freddie Kitchens, though, was a bit more upset about the incident than Beckham was \u2014 and is planning to call Al Riveron, the NFL\u2019s senior vice president of officiating, about the play.\n\n\u201cI saw what you saw. He was getting choked on the ground,\u201d Kitchens said, via ESPN\u2019s Jake Trotter. \u201cThey get away with that because it\u2019s Odell. I\u2019m going to be on the phone with Al when I get on the bus.\u201d\n\nOdell Beckham Jr. got choke-slammed by Marlon Humphrey.
