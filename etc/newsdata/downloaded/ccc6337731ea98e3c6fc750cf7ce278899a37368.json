The negotiations are still ongoing and the final package, and valuation, might be different.", "description": "WeWork will be valued at less than all the cash that investors have already poured into it under a rescue plan being put together by its biggest backer SoftBank, according to reports.", "authors": ["Laurence Dodds", "Us Technology Reporter", "Tom Hoggins"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/technology/2019/08/15/TELEMMGLPICT000206423133_1-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
