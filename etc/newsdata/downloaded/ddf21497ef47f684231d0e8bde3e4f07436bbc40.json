REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - Facebook\u2019s Libra cryptocurrency faces a pivotal meeting of backers on Monday, days after the would-be digital coin project suffered a severe blow as major payment firms quit.\n\nMastercard and Visa abandoned the Geneva-based Libra Association on Friday, as did eBay, fintech startup Stripe and payments company Mercado Pago.\n\nPoliticians and regulators from the United States to Europe have said that Libra risks upsetting global financial stability, undermining users\u2019 privacy and facilitating money laundering.\n\nPayPal started the Libra Association exodus this month, leaving Facebook without the backing of any major payments firms for the project, due for launch by June 2020.\n\nLibra said this month it would give details after the meeting of the 1,500 \u201centities\u201d that have indicated \u201centhusiastic interest\u201d to take part in the project.\n\nMembers will review a charter and appoint a board at the Libra meeting, which will be held in Geneva, the Wall Street Journal reported this month.\n\nA spokeswoman did not immediately respond to enquiries on the meeting of the Libra Association, whose remaining members include Vodafone and ride-hailing firms Uber and Lyft.\n\nIt also includes non-profit organisations, venture capital groups and blockchain firms, but the departure of major financial firms presents a stumbling block for Libra\u2019s efforts to convince regulators and politicians about the coin\u2019s safety.\n\nFrance last month pledged to block Libra from operating in Europe, with the Bank of England laying out high hurdles it must meet before its launch. U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has also suggested the project could not advance before concerns were met.", "description": "Facebook's Libra cryptocurrency faces a pivotal meeting of backers on Monday, days after the would-be digital coin project suffered a severe blow as major payment firms quit.", "authors": ["Tom Wilson", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191014&t=2&i=1440672903&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9D0R5", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
