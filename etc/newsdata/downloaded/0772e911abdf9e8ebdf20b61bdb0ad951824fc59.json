(Drew Angerer/Getty Images)\n\nOne of the most important fights over the impeachment inquiry of President Trump is playing out on the airwaves of Fox News.\n\nBack in 1996, Fox had to pay cable providers to carry it, and the channel\u2019s old-timers enjoy telling the story of that scrappy start. The company served up free Pinkberry frozen yogurt to mark the channel\u2019s 23rd anniversary, a modest celebration for the most powerful political media juggernaut in the country. Fox News CEO Suzanne Scott and President Jay Wallace retold the origin story in a staff memo circulated Monday to note the occasion.\n\nRelishing triumph over doubters is something Trump also enjoys. The channel and the president share another passion: love of a good fight.\n\n\u201cThis is war,\u201d Laura Ingraham declared on her prime-time show, describing a letter from White House counsel Pat A. Cipollone that said the White House would not permit the president or any member of the Trump administration to appear before the House impeachment inquiry.\n\nShe could just as easily have been referring to the tensions roiling Fox. Trump is a famously loyal viewer of the channel, and the attention he pays it has helped drive ratings and amplify the messages of its most outspoken hosts. But that amplification has stoked friction between on-air personalities who are aware of the stakes and realize what they say carries huge implications for the country, according to a half dozen current and former staffers and contributors, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak about the network or feared retribution for speaking frankly.\n\nThe president is taking shots at Fox, chiding news anchors who present non-laudatory views of his administration. Right-wing media is trying to outflank the channel by allying themselves completely with Trump. Internal strife is spilling out onto the airwaves. And yet, these are heady times for Fox News.\n\nFox\u2019s relentless focus on Monica Lewinsky while covering the 1998 impeachment of Bill Clinton helped propel the channel\u2019s early success. This impeachment story finds Fox on the side of the sitting president, and far from the striver it used to be.\n\nThe September night House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the opening of a formal impeachment inquiry, Trump ally Sean Hannity\u2019s show drew 3.9 million viewers, according to Nielsen data. The channel has long beaten its rivals MSNBC and CNN in ratings and is on track to do so again this year.\n\nFox serves as creative inspiration for the president and his political message. And the power that Fox News holds over Republican voters \u2014 and in turn their congressional representatives \u2014 is a crucial factor as the battle over impeachment continues.\n\n\u201cRichard Nixon would have killed his own dog for that kind of a counterforce,\u201d said Rick Wilson, a Republican political consultant and never-Trumper who frequently appears on MSNBC.\n\n\n\nChris Wallace was criticized by colleague Laura Ingraham over coverage of Robert Mueller.

(Frank Franklin II/AP)\n\n[November 2018: A look back at Fox News Channel\u2019s ongoing drama in the Trump era]\n\nThe internecine conflict is an open discussion on air. Tuesday night, after former Trump attorney Joe diGenova called the whistleblower who spurred the impeachment inquiry a \"suicide bomber\" on Ingraham's show, she followed up quickly to remind viewers that diGenova meant a \"political suicide bomber.\" Viewers \u2014 and perhaps other Fox personalities \u2014 who objected to the comments, she said, should \"get a sense of humor, okay. If you still think that, then you really should watch another show where we need to spell it all out for you.\"\n\nLast week, diGenova was involved in another dust-up.\n\nThe consternation started when former judge Andrew Napolitano, a Fox pundit who has turned on Trump in recent months, told Fox chief news anchor Shepard Smith on-air that Trump\u2019s call to Ukraine\u2019s president, during which he pressured him to investigate former vice president Joe Biden, was a \u201ccrime.\u201d Later the same day, Fox News host Tucker Carlson, who has a warm relationship with Fox Corp. CEO Lachlan Murdoch, invited DiGenova onto his show. DiGenova called Napolitano a \u201cfool.\u201d The next day, Smith said it was \u201crepugnant\u201d for Carlson not to defend Napolitano. Smith has a long-standing friendship with Wallace, the Fox News president, who used to produce Smith\u2019s show.\n\n\u201cInternally, Hannity is a live wire and an opinion guy, and that gives him the ability to say anything he wants,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cBut the battering that guys like Shep Smith and even [anchor] Bill Hemmer take if they seem they are off the reservation is brutal.\u201d\n\nOn-air sniping is a relatively new phenomenon for Fox News. Under longtime chairman and CEO Roger Ailes, who kept a tight rein on Fox news personalities and created a culture of fear inside the building, \u201cpeople would have been too afraid to fight out in the open like that,\u201d said a former producer. \u201cThey would not even have tried.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s survival of the fittest,\u201d one current staffer said, describing a dynamic that tends to favor on-air personalities with the highest ratings and those most willing to engage in a public feud.\n\nOn his show, Lou Dobbs recently allowed DiGenova and his wife Victoria Toensing, an attorney, to accuse \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d host Chris Wallace of violating an off-the-record agreement. In September, Hannity chided Ingraham for cutting away too early from a Trump speech. In May, Ingraham called \u201cAmerica\u2019s Newsroom,\u201d a morning news program on Fox hosted by Bill Hemmer and Sandra Smith, to express her dismay at the way the media \u2014 including Wallace \u2014 was covering Robert Mueller\u2019s letter to Attorney General William Barr, which critiqued Barr\u2019s characterization of Mueller\u2019s report. Wallace appeared on air later in the day and responded to Ingraham, though not by name.\n\nAll the attention has made Fox personalities stars in their own right. Some opinion hosts have been regularly depicted on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d And they are enjoying the attention.\n\nJeanine Pirro, who is an old friend of Trump\u2019s and one of his fiercest defenders, attempted to meet with Cecily Strong, who plays Pirro on SNL, according to two people familiar with the incident. \u201cNBC said, \u2018Uh, we aren\u2019t interested,\u2019 \u201d one of the people said.\n\n\u201cI thought it would be a hoot [to meet Strong],\u201d Pirro said in a statement through a Fox News spokesperson. \u201cI saw an article several months ago where she was asked if she ever met me and my recollection was that she said something along the lines that she had not, but hoped that I knew it was all in jest.\u201d\n\n\n\nFox News host Tucker Carlson earlier this year.

Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) called the set of \"Fox & Friends\" to register his disapproval of the president's plan to pull American troops from northern Syria. \"I hope I'm making myself clear how shortsighted and irresponsible this decision is,\" he told co-hosts Steve Doocy, Brian Kilmeade and Ainsley Earhardt. \"I like President Trump. I've tried to help him. This to me is just unnerving to its core.\"\n\nIt was an unusual moment of independence, both for Graham and the show.\n\nThose moments are particularly sensitive for the president. In late August, he attacked the channel for being disloyal and \u201cnot working for us,\u201d after Sandra Smith interviewed a Democratic National Committee official. The message of Fox\u2019s disloyalty has gained so much traction that conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh recently called Fox News \u201cthe Never-Trump News Network.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s base is unlikely to abandon him, but Fox might be especially influential with \u201creluctant\u201d Trump supporters whose opinions might be swayed by the coverage of the impeachment inquiry, said Sarah Longwell, a Republican strategist and the publisher of the Bulwark, a neoconservative news and opinion site.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always the most meaningful when the people who are loyalists break and oppose this president,\u201d she said. \u201cAt a moment when he needs his staunch Republican allies, for him to do something that causes many of his staunchest allies to break with him, then that\u2019s very significant.\u201d\n\nSo it was notable when Carlson and Neil Patel wrote in a Daily Caller opinion piece that \u201cTrump should not have been on the phone with a foreign head of state encouraging another country to investigate his political opponent, Joe Biden,\u201d and that \u201cthere\u2019s no way to spin this.\u201d But the column quickly turned to conclude that while bad, Trump\u2019s actions weren\u2019t impeachable, an argument that CNN White House correspondent Abby Phillip tweeted was a road map for conservatives looking for a way to condemn Trump\u2019s call to the Ukraine but avoid impeachment.\n\n\u201cAs Trump does a lot of things that are objectionable to Republicans, the most important role Fox News plays is to say, \u2018Well, let me tell you why these Democrats are more objectionable\u2019,\u201d added Longwell.\n\nSince the inquiry was announced, support for it has risen by 25 points among Democrats, 21 points among Republicans and 20 points among independents, according to a Washington Post-Schar School Poll.\n\nBut the battle over public opinion is just beginning, and no news outlet seems more likely than Fox to help Trump hold the line.\n\nTuesday afternoon, Mike Emanuel, Fox\u2019s chief congressional correspondent, tweeted that Fox had learned of 94 GOP co-sponsors of Rep. Andy Biggs\u2019s (R-Ariz.) motion \u201cto condemn and censure\u201d Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), chair of the House Intelligence Committee. Twenty minutes later, Matt Schlapp, chairman of the American Conservative Union \u2014 and husband of former Fox contributor and current Trump campaign official Mercedes Schlapp \u2014 retweeted the news with a threatening, circle-the-wagons message: \u201cWoe to those who don\u2019t sign the Biggs censure of Schiff.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, Biggs tweeted that the number of co-sponsors had ticked up to 98.\n\nRead more:\n\nTrump ally on Fox News calls whistleblowers \u2018suicide bombers,\u2019 accuses Democrats of \u2018regicide\u2019\n\nOpinion: Trump\u2019s fate is in the hands of Fox News\n\nAnalysis: \u2018Coup\u2019 talk is proliferating on Fox as the impeachment inquiry ramps up", "description": "The cable juggernaut\u2019s internecine conflict could be a crucial factor as Trump seeks to maintain Republican support.", "authors": ["Sarah Ellison", "Reporter Covering Media", "Its Intersection With Politics", "October At Pm", "Sarah Ellison Is A Staff Writer Based In New York For The Washington Post.
