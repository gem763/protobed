We just want someone to talk to us, and this was the only way to do it,' said Ernesto Banegas, a 51-year-old construction worker from Honduras who fled his country after his five-year-old son was kidnapped.\n\nCarla Moradel, who was sent back to Mexico after crossing into the United States, said she has been waiting for two months and just wanted officials to say 'yes or no.'\n\n'If they had clearly told me, \"No,' I would have gone back to Honduras, but I think there is still a chance,'\" said the 21-year-old, who also left Honduras with her 5-year-old son because she couldn't find work.\n\nA Honduran migrants hugs her three-year-old daughter while joining a group of asylum seekers who on Thursday blocked a bridge that connects Mexico and the United States to demand quickness in the asylum process\n\nMigrant women sleep while camping out on the Gateway International Bridge on Thursday after nearly 300 asylum seekers showed up demanding their requests to be reviewed by U.S. immigration agents\n\nUnder a policy known as metering, U.S. officials at many border bridges accept only a few asylum-seekers a day. The Associated Press found about 19,000 names on waiting lists in four border cities visited in late July.\n\nFrustration with U.S. policies aimed at limiting asylum requests has sparked mass attempts to cross border entries before. But Thursday's camp-out on the Mexican side of the Matamoros bridge appeared to be more of a protest than an attempt to cross.\n\nIn the afternoon, Matamoros Mayor Mario Alberto L\u00f3pez walked onto the bridge to talk to the migrants and try to convince them to reopen the span.\n\nMigrants told the mayor they were living in dirty conditions in Matamoros with little shelter or access to toilets, and he promised to send cleaning crews and set up washing facilities.\n\nSeguismundo Dogu\u00edn, National Immigration Institute delegate in Tamaulipas, said the protesters' demands were heard and relayed to U.S. officials, and that the migrants at the bridge were offered to be taken in at a shelter to await their court dates in better conditions.\n\nA one-year-old Mexican girl sits on the Gateway International Bridge during migrant protests\n\nStringent immigration guidelines placed by the Trump administration has forced migrants to wait on the Mexican side of the border for their asylum requests to be considered as part of the 'Remain in Mexico' policy\n\nMigrant children play with a traffic cone as U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents look on from afar at the Gateway International Bridge\n\nThe migrants cleared the roadbed of the bridge and remained blocking the sidewalk portion.\n\nBut L\u00f3pez and others pointed out that the blockade had caused inconveniences for Matamoros residents who need to cross for work, shopping or other reasons.\n\nLiliana Ram\u00edrez, 35, who sells flavored shaved ice to crossing pedestrians, said it was a lost day with zero sales.\n\nSuch protests 'harm everyone,' Ram\u00edrez said. 'Also (the migrants) - things are going to be made more difficult for them.'\n\nShe also complained about trash left at the camp.\n\nOrlando Valerio, a 53-year-old Nicaraguan migrant, said he missed his asylum hearing appointment because of the protest.\n\nA migrant mother and child were among 250-300 people who blocked off a bridge connecting Mexico and the United States in an attempt to have their asylum requests processed\n\nMigrants grew tired of waiting to make their initial asylum requests at the U.S. border crossing and forced the shutdown of the busy Gateway International Bridge\n\n'I understand them, I am one of them,' Valerio said. 'But they can't block things this way.'\n\nThe CBP statement said migrants who had been returned to Mexico to wait for hearings on their asylum cases [a policy known as MPP, or Migrant Protection Protocol], but who could not cross due to the closure would be given new dates.\n\nSome locals were sympathetic to the migrants.\n\nFrancisco Tovar, who plays piano at a bar near the border, said people could have crossed elsewhere.\n\n'These are political questions, and the United States and Mexico have to do something,' he said.\n\nMoments after traffic resumed Thursday, U.S. border patrol agents staged one of their regular anti-riot exercises. Smoke canisters were fired and the crossing was closed again, though this time for just a couple of minutes.", "description": "Desperate migrants from Central American and elsewhere shutdown a bridge connecting the United States and Mexico on Thursday to demand asylum from the Trump administration.", "authors": ["Associated Press", "Adry Torres For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/15/19592804-0-image-a-14_1570804171308.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
