This prompted Henry, serving as a Fox & Friends co-host, to pose a question to his Fox colleague.\n\n\u201cThe President of the United States, I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s illegal\u2014are you okay with a president asking his counterpart\u2014this is a simple yes or no\u2014to dig up dirt on former vice president Joe Biden and his son?\u201d Henry wondered. \u201cAre you okay with that?\u201d\n\nLevin lashed out at Henry, accusing the Fox News correspondent on not asking an \u201chonest question\u201d while repeatedly shouting that there was \u201cno problem\u201d with any of the president\u2019s actions.\n\nAfter the tense on-air exchange, Fox News viewers began tweeting out their praise of Levin for \u201cmopping the floor\u201d with Henry. And it didn\u2019t take long for these posts to make their way to the president\u2019s timeline, including one that called Henry a \u201clying shit head.\u201d\n\nBesides sharing nearly two dozen tweets applauding Levin, the president added his own commentary. Sharing an article detailing the confrontation, Trump declared: \u201cSo great Mark!\u201d\n\nNot done with just linking to write-ups of the Levin-Henry clash, the president also made sure to post a video of the on-air altercation.\n\nIronically, since the Ukraine story blew up, Henry has been seen as pushing the White House\u2019s talking points in his reporting on the whistleblower complaint at the center of the issue. Prior to the call transcript and complaint being made public, Henry reported from a \u201csenior administration official\u201d that there was \u201cno there there\u201d in the call and that whistleblower was pushing a political agenda because they supported a rival political candidate.\n\nHenry, for his part, acknowledged the fact that Team Trump was praising him just a couple of days ago, tweeting out a video from the president\u2019s reelection campaign that quoted Henry saying the \u201cwhistleblower does not have firsthand info of the President or others in the White House\u201d and acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire \u201cmade clear that the narrative is wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cLol two days ago,\u201d Henry tweeted. \u201c#fairandbalanced working hard thank you!\u201d\n\nThe Fox News correspondent would go on to fire off several more tweets and retweets in response to the president's criticism while defending his questioning of Levin.", "description": "\u201cSo great Mark!\u201d Trump tweeted while sharing nearly two dozen tweets from his fans who applauded Fox News host Mark Levin.", "authors": ["Justin Baragona"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_360,w_640,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569779421/fox-and-friends-sunday_5_r8uli5", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
