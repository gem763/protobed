The label, he complained, is a political smear.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s modern-day McCarthyism,\u201d he said. \u201cUnbelievable for a Cold Warrior like me who spent a career standing up to the Russians to be given a moniker like that. It\u2019s an effort to smear me.\u201d\n\nReferring to a previous tag he had earned for thwarting other bills, he said, \u201cYou know, I can laugh about things like the Grim Reaper, but calling me Moscow Mitch is over the top.\u201d\n\nIn July, McConnell thwarted a House-passed measure that sought to authorize $775 million to fortify state election systems and require paper ballots for added security. He also blocked a separate proposal that would have required candidates as well as their staffers and family members to alert federal authorities if offered aid by foreign governments \u2015 a measure sparked by the various revelations into Russian interference in the U.S. 2016 election.\n\nMSNBC host Joe Scarborough derided the senator the next day, dubbing him \u201cMoscow Mitch\u201d \u2015 and the nickname was born. Within hours, it began trending on Twitter, even inspiring a song from rock band Ben Folds Five, which performed the tune at a show in New York. It also followed him home, with opponents chanting it as he tried to speak at a political picnic a few weeks ago in Fancy Farm, Kentucky.\n\nContinuing to voice his frustration over his inability to shake the tag, McConnell told Hewitt it\u2019s a product of \u201cwhat we\u2019re up against with the hard left today in America.\u201d\n\nWashington Post columnist Dana Milbank had also taken McConnell to task just after he senator blocked action on the election security bills, calling him a \u201cRussian asset\u201d in a searing op-ed.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s call this what it is: unpatriotic,\u201d Milbank wrote. \u201cThe Kentucky Republican is, arguably more than any other American, doing Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s bidding.\u201d\n\nA visibly enraged McConnell responded with a defensive Senate floor speech at the end of July, dismissing both Scarborough and Milbank as \u201chyperventilating hacks.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like an inflationary crisis, but with outrage instead of dollars,\u201d he said.\n\nMcConnell\u2019s sensitivity to the nickname may stem in part from a potentially spirited Democratic challenge to his bid for a seventh term in the 2020 election.", "description": "The Senate majority leader voiced frustration over the moniker, given him for blocking two election security bills.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d6ebddc2400004f0072fbfb.jpeg?cache=bxbsfklppy&ops=1778_1000"}
