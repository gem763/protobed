Garner and Affleck finalized their divorce after he completed his a 40-day stay rehab in October 2018.\n\nThat was Affleck\u2019s third stint in rehab. He was also in inpatient rehab in 2017 and 2001.\n\nLast week it was reported that Affleck had started dating again using the Raya app, which is a members-only networking app for celebrities, athletes and high-profile individuals to connect. On Saturday \u2014 before his \u201cslip\u201d\u2014 Affleck confirmed it via social media, but asked his followers to focus on something \u201cactually important.\u201d He then talked about his sobriety \u2014 \u201cI have been in recovery for over a year and part of that is helping out others\u201d \u2014 and asked people to donate to the Midnight Mission charity \u2014 to help \u201cpeople battling addiction every day that don\u2019t have the resources and need help.\u201d\n\nRead more from Yahoo Entertainment:\n\nWant daily pop culture news delivered to your inbox?
