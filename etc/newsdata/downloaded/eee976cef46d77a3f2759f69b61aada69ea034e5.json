It would promote operational efficiency at its loss-making China operations and is standard practice in most other markets.\n\nBut it ignored realities on the ground. Chinese automakers, often in 50-50 partnerships with foreign car makers, are reluctant to lose control over sales decisions, rarely willing to trust each other and loyal to local provinces that are fiercely competitive in their quest for economic growth and tax revenues from vehicle sales.\n\n\"I would say there was a lack of deep understanding on how relationships work in China,\" Anning Chen, who in October took over as Ford's third China chief in two years, said in an interview in Shanghai.\n\nIt is the first time that Ford, grappling with a host of problems in China that present no quick fix, has disclosed the dropping of the plan - a decision also prompted by a sharp slowdown in China's economic growth amid the trade war with the United States as well as deeper losses at dealerships.\n\nMany major foreign automakers have 2 or 3 partners in China, involving different marketing and distribution strategies for each partner. Ford is the only one known to have tried combining sales channels for mainstream cars.\n\nOther steps Ford is taking to turn around its China business include launching 30 new or significantly redesigned vehicles over the next three years, reductions in the number of temporary workers at plants, hiring more local Chinese, and putting profits before growth in market share.\n\nCapacity cuts as Ford and its partners embark on \"right-sizing\" their plants are also likely, Chen said.\n\nA recovery would help relieve pressure on the U.S. automaker which is also scrambling to end losses in Europe through plant closures and layoffs. It would also mitigate the risk that Ford ends up a marginal player in China - a market with annual sales of some 28 million vehicles that many foreign automakers now consider their most important.\n\n\n\n\n\nSALES IMPLOSION\n\nThe slide in Ford's sales has been unprecedented for a major global automaker in China. After a peak of 1.08 million vehicles in 2016, sales began faltering in late 2017, then nearly halved last year to 504,488, according to consultancy IHS Markit.\n\nIHS forecasts Ford's sales will tumble further to 382,882 this year, while LMC Automotive predicts Ford's China market share will fall to 1.4% compared to 3.8% in 2016.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Graphic: Ford's China sales collapse - https://graphics.reuters.com/FORD-MOTOR-CHINA/0100B273150/FORD-CHINA.jpg)\n\n\n\n\n\nFord has publicly pinned the blame on an aging model lineup but company officials familiar with the matter said the breakdown in relationships with its joint venture partners and dealers as well as missteps by previous management teams were the bigger factors at play.\n\nFor now, Ford's main goal in China is profitability, Joe Hinrichs, president of Ford Automotive, told Reuters at the company's Dearborn, Michigan headquarters.\n\n\"You can be a profitable business in China with a relatively low market share because of...the size of the market,\" he said.\n\nAs signs of progress, Hinrichs pointed to dealer inventories at their lowest level in 18 months and a halving in first-half China losses before interest and tax to $283 million from the same period a year earlier.\n\n\"This is not a five-year journey,\" he said, but declined to be more specific when asked how soon Ford's China unit is expected to regain profitability.\n\nHinrichs, who became head of Ford's auto business in May, helmed its Asia Pacific business from 2009 to 2011 - a period of strong growth for the automaker in China.\n\nChen, a U.S. citizen who grew up in China and speaks fluent Mandarin, joined Ford in October from Chery Automobile Co. He is however, a Ford veteran, having worked for the firm for 17 years, mostly in Dearborn, prior to joining Chery.", "description": "SHANGHAI/DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co  has scrapped a plan to create a unified national sales company for China that stoked mistrust of the automaker at its joint venture partners and contributed to a spectacular collapse in sales in the world's biggest car market.
