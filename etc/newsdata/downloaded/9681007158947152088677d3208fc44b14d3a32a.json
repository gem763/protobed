But there's a lot that happens to that water before it gets there, and this is our way to honor the hard work of those people who ensure the best water coming from the tap every day.'\n\nRepresentatives from each state attended the event in Victoria on Saturday\n\nThe event was held at by the Wannon Water facility in Dunkfield, Victoria who won last years competition\n\n\n\n", "description": "You may not think twice about the water out of your tap, but not all water is created equally.
