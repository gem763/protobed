All of this is important to the criminal investigation and reconstruction of the events surrounding this incident.'\n\nMedical personnel were immediately called to the home (pictured) and were able to revive both children. Conner and Brinley were then rushed to Lehigh Valley Hospital-Cedar Crest where they were placed on life support\n\nAn autopsy last week was inconclusive. The coroner has said forensic testing is needed before he can rule on the cause and manner of death.\n\nPolice are continuing to investigate and no arrests have been made.\n\nHowever, welfare officials said the siblings, who lived with their mom and 17-year-old brother, were known to Child and Youth Services. The children did not see their father, according to reports.\n\nCathleen Palm, the founder of Center for Children's Justice, told WFMZ that according to the state Department of Human Services, the siblings were receiving general protective services.\n\nPalm said these services are made in cases where there is concern about a child's welfare.\n\n'That's a really hard thing when two children die at the same time from the same home,' Palm told the station. 'That makes the community want to know more.'\n\nBerks County District Attorney John T. Adams said it is still too early in the investigation to release any information.\n\nHe said: 'It's a real head-scratcher. I wish I could say something about the case.'\n\nFor confidential help, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255.", "description": "Lisa Snyder, 36, found her children Conner and Brinley hanging in Berks County on September 23.
