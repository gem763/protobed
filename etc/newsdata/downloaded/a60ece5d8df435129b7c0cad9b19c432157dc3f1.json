We're at our best when we do that.\"\n\nMichael Brantley drove in a pair of runs for Houston on a night when Astros' starting pitcher Zack Greinke allowed seven hits, three walks and one run in 4-2/3 innings.\n\nHouston will turn the ball over to Jose Urquidy for Game Four on Saturday.\n\n\"Obviously we used a lot of resources tonight but this is the World Series were are going to keep going at it,\" said Hinch.\n\n\"Jose Urquidy's been really good for us. He's started a little bit, he's been in the pen. We are going to turn the ball over to him in the first inning and give him an opportunity to go as deep as he can.\"", "description": "Astros show true colors to revive World Series hopes", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9P04O_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
