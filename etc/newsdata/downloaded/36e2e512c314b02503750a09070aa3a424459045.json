The XLM/USD pair remained well bid above the $0.0550 level, but it also struggled to continue higher. Recently, there was a break above the $0.0600 resistance area. Moreover, the price climbed above $0.0605 and the 55 simple moving average (4-hours).\n\nDuring the rise, there was a break above a short term bearish trend line at $0.0590 on the 4-hours chart. However, there are a few key resistances forming near the $0.0620 and $0.0626 levels. Additionally, the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level of the crucial drop from the $0.0963 high to $0.0522 low is also near $0.0626. If there is an upside break above the $0.0626 resistance, the price could rise towards the $0.0700 and $0.0750 resistances.\n\nAn intermediate resistance is near the $0.0650 level. The main resistance is near the $0.0750 level since it coincides with the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the crucial drop from the $0.0963 high to $0.0522 low. If there are more upsides, the price could test the $0.0840 resistance area.\n\nConversely, if the price fails to break the $0.0620 and $0.0626 resistances, it could start a fresh decline. The main support on the downside is near the $0.0550 level. If there is a break below $0.0550, the price may perhaps break the $0.0522 low and extend its decline. The next key support is near the $0.0500 level.\n\nThe chart indicates that XLM price is clearly consolidating below the key $0.0626 resistance level. If there is an upside break above $0.0626, the price is likely to start a solid increase towards $0.0650 and $0.0700. Conversely, there is a risk of a downside break below $0.0550. Moreover, a clear break below the $0.0500 support might spark sharp bearish moves.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\n4 hours MACD \u2013 The MACD for XLM/USD is slowly moving into the bullish zone.\n\n4 hours RSI \u2013 The RSI for XLM/USD is now well above the 50 level.\n\nKey Support Levels \u2013 $0.0550 and $0.0500.\n\nKey Resistance Levels \u2013 $0.0626, $0.0650 and $0.0750.", "description": "Stellar lumen price is consolidating below key resistances against the US Dollar.
