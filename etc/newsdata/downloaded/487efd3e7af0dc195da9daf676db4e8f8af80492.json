Please note, the deployments are not about the protest but generators of crime in the area,\" said Captain FC van Wyk about the SANDF's support for the police's Operation Lockdown mission.\n\nThe SANDF's mandate to stay in Cape Town to support the police was extended to March 2020.

A truck transporting eggs was stopped, torched and looted on Monday.\n\nPeople have been walking long distances to reach the next available public transportation hub, and it appeared that refuse had not been collected either. Traffic jams in the surrounding areas were severe as motorists were unable to take their normal routes due to road closures.\n\nRubbish wait to be collected.
