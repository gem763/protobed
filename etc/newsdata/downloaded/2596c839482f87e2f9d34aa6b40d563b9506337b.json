Dakota & Elle Fanning are no exception. And now Elle\u2019s put her sister\u2019s bossy ways on show for the whole globe to see. Total younger sister move there.\n\nElle posted a throwback video to her Instagram this morning (night for America) of her and Dakota prepping for Trick Or Treat back when they were little. In the video, Dakota Fanning is carefully applying her makeup while Elle Fanning is fucking hers up entirely and also trying to use an eyebrow pencil for god-knows-what.\n\nThe absolute best bit? When Dakota notices Elle\u2019s removed her clown wig and yells pointedly \u201cgo get your wig back on!\u201d\n\nHonestly, the entire thing made me want to fish out my old videos on my parents camcorder (!!!!) to find the video where I made my sister hold all five other doll characters and just parrot what I was saying, while I played Dr Barbie in the iconic 1999 film Dr Barbie\u2019s Sweet Revenge.", "description": "Elle Fanning has shared the cutest video of her and older sister Dakota Fanning preparing for Halloween as kids, & yes Dakota is the bossy older sis.", "authors": ["Melissa Mason"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-20-at-7.57.28-am.png", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
