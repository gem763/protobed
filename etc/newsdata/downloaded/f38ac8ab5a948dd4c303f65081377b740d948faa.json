He should go,\" adding that: \"If Craig was gone they wouldn't notice any difference at all.\n\n\"The viewers wouldn't miss him either. No-one would miss him.\"\n\nJudges Len Goodman and Darcey Bussell have quit the panel in recent years, and James thinks that if the show can go on without them, then it can cope without Craig.\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\nThe professional added that Len was a much bigger personality than Craig, and the show is still huge without him.\n\nHe continued: \"So it would still be a big success.\n\n\"Strictly will always be a juggernaut of a show no matter who you have on there. The format just works.\"\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\nIn August it was tipped that James would replace Jason Gardiner on Dancing On Ice. James is known for his sharp tongue and no-nonsense attitude.\n\nAnd last year, he branded presenter Stacey Dooley's final performance on Strictly a \"complete mess\".\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\nHe has also won the last series of Dancing On Ice, and could now be back to make his moves as a judge.\n\nThe star is a favourite with the bookies at 3/1 to take his place on the show.\n\nA source revealed to The Sun: \"It's unlikely to happen although he'd love the role.\"", "description": "Professional dancer James Jordan says that the Strictly judge should be axed from the hit BBC show.", "authors": ["Brogan-Leigh Hurst", "Image", "Bbc"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20470821.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_RLP_MDG_18065JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
