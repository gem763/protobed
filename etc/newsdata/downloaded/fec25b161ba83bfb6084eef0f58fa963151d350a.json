REUTERS/Aleksandra Szmigiel\n\nThe mother of three is not a fan of all policies pursued by Law and Justice (PiS). She is worried by its judicial reforms, which the European Union\u2019s executive says threaten the independence of judges.\n\nBut she will put her qualms aside because of a child subsidy which has made her better off than before PiS came to power in 2015.\n\nKolsut, a factory worker in the northern town of Nowa Karczma, receives 500 zlotys ($127) a month for each of her children. The combined 1,500 zlotys from what is known as the 500+ subsidy is roughly equivalent to the minimum monthly wage.\n\nShe no longer has to struggle to pay her utility bills and buy clothes.\n\n\u201cI sleep soundly,\u201d Kolsut, 35, said as she watched her daughter Lena and friends celebrating her seventh birthday at an indoor play area she hired for the occasion. \u201cI am pleased with the (PiS) family policies.\u201d\n\nThe subsidy, which is not means-tested and not indexed to inflation, is seen by PiS as vital to its appeal to working-class voters.\n\nPromises to introduce the subsidy helped PiS return to power in 2015, when its socially conservative and nationalist agenda tapped into public frustration with Western liberal values.\n\nCritics say 500+ is populist, costly to the economy and reinforces a stereotypical image of women. But pollsters say it has contributed to a big lead for the PiS in opinion polls.\n\nA comfortable election victory would give PiS a mandate to further reshape Poland in its conservative image. A close race could force it to rein in some of its ambitions and make it harder to stand up to EU pressure over the rule of law.\n\n\u201cDIGNITY FACTOR\u201d\n\nIn the 2015 election, the then governing center-right Civic Platform (PO) won in Nowa Karzma\u2019s voting district, but PiS won 54% of votes there in a European Parliament election in May.\n\n\u201cOur region is very family-oriented,\u201d said Karolina Burczyk, a 26-year-old accountant. \u201cMore people used to vote for PO but now PiS is more popular.\u201d\n\nWeighty issues such as judicial reform, under which judges could ultimately face sanctions over rulings deemed inappropriate, are simply \u201cremoved from reality\u201d for many voters, she said.\n\nThe child subsidy, introduced in April 2016, was meant to help 2.7 million families in the country of 38 million people. Economists said it was expected to bolster the economy by fuelling consumption, at least in the short term.\n\nIt has cost more than 70 billion zlotys. But it is the first time since communist rule ended in 1989 that Poland has handed out money that does not stigmatize recipients as being poor, and has won over working-class Poles who previously felt they had seen little benefit from the transition to free markets.\n\n\u201cSuddenly they feel at home in their country, something they may have not felt in the past, or they felt they were being treated unfairly. There is a dignity factor here,\u201d said Pawel Marczewski, an economist with the Stefan Batory Foundation in Poland.\n\nAnna Osowska, who is 34 and has five children, is happy she no longer has to apply for emergency social funds each month.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have to go, borrow, ask social services to help,\u201d she said.\n\nOsowska, who does not work, had never voted before 2015, but she backed PiS in 2015 because of the promised subsidy.\n\n\u201cREPRESENTATIVES OF THE WEAK\u201d\n\nAbout 14% of the workforce earns the minimum wage, and human resources firm Sedlak & Sedlak said about 98% earn less than the average wage in Germany, the EU\u2019s economic powerhouse.\n\n\u201cWe are the representatives of the weak, those who have been hurt and who today I hope see and know that they have won back their rightful place in society and in Poland,\u201d Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki told a party convention.\n\nCritics say the policy is part of a nationalist agenda that includes stigmatization of sexual minorities and a push back against Western liberal values.\n\nSome say it exposes public finances to too much risk and removes the incentive for some women to work. Others rue its impact on Polish politics.\n\nSlideshow (5 Images)\n\n\u201cWhen you have aggressive populists as in the case of PiS in Poland, then opposition parties are thinking how would they respond,\u201d said Leszek Balcerowicz, a former finance minister, told Reuters. \u201cAnd most of them respond by saying that they would keep it, so populism, aggressive populism, tends to poison the political scene.\u201d\n\nSpending on social protection for families and children has risen under PiS from 1.5% of GDP in 2015 to 2.7% in 2017 - above the EU average of 1.7%. Consumer Price Inflation Consumer Price Inflation reached its highest point since 2012 earlier this year.\n\nWhile ratings agencies expect increased social spending to widen the budget deficit, they are not concerned enough to cut Poland\u2019s credit rating, recently affirmed by Fitch at a sound \u201cA-\u201c.", "description": "Maria Kolsut will be thinking about her financial security when she votes for Poland's ruling right-wing party in Sunday's parliamentary election.", "authors": ["Alan Charlish", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191007&t=2&i=1437986321&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF960DI", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
