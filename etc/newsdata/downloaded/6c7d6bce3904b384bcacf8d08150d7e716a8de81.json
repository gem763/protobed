We must save each other,' the singer tweeted to her roughly 77 million followers on Twitter.\n\nShe included a photo of Genest and herself from the Born This Way music video.\n\nBeyond devastating: The 32-year-old popular tweeted that Genest's suicide was 'beyond devastating' in August of 2018\n\nReach out: Lady Gaga urged anyone suffering from mental health issues to reach out for help\n\nTragic: The heavily tattooed 32-year-old was found dead after plunging from his Montreal apartment in August of 2018\n\nThe singer added: 'Science tells us that it takes 21 days to form a habit, if you are suffering from Mental Health issue I beckon for today to be your first day or a continuation of the work you've been doing. Reach out if you're in pain, and if you know someone who is, reach out to them too.'\n\nThe Bad Romance singer also posted another tweet announcing a new partnership with her Born This Way Foundation to promote 'kindness and mental health'.\n\n'Kindness and mental health aren't one time practices.
