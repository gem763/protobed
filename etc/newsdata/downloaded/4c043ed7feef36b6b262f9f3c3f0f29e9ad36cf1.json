He wants to take back control and has dedicated his political career to this noble cause.\u201d\n\nAnd appearing on Sky News\u2019 Sophy Ridge on Sunday, he added: \u201dIt is ultimately a question of trust about the direction of where we are going.\n\n\u201cI trust Boris Johnson to ensure the relationship the United Kingdom has with the European Union is one where we are not a vassal state.\u201d\n\nHe insisted the UK would leave the EU on 31 October even if more time is required to enshrine a deal in law, saying: \u201dIf we get the deal and we have a vote possibly next Saturday and that is agreed, getting it through in legislation won\u2019t be that problematic.\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

If no agreement is approved, the law says that he must seek another Brexit delay from the EU.\n\nAccording to reports, some former Conservative MPs will try to force him to request an extension even if he secures a deal. Former Tory rebels including Philip Hammond and Dominic Grieve are understood to believe that MPs should be given more time to scrutinise the proposed agreement, rather than it being rushed through parliament in a matter of days.\n\nMr Grieve told the Mail on Sunday: \u201cHe\u2019s going to have to extend. I cannot see how he would be justified in trying to force through a major piece of constitutional legislation, the Withdrawal Agreement Act, in seven days. It\u2019s improper.\u201d", "description": "Jacob Rees-Mogg has urged his fellow Eurosceptics to trust Boris Johnson to deliver Brexit.
