I don\u2019t use sex. And I\u2019m much more talented.\u201d\n\nThen the director yelled cut.\n\nThe moment was part of a shoot on the much-anticipated new CBS show \u201cEvil\u201d \u2014 the priest was part of a trio investigating a slick entertainment boss over a toxic work culture.\n\nIf that last part sounds familiar, it should. \u201cEvil\u201d debuts on a network that spent much of last year dogged by sexual-misconduct allegations against former chief executive Leslie Moonves along with accusations of sexual harassment on multiple sets.\n\nThat a CBS primetime series is willing to tackle an incisively modern issue \u2014 this incisively modern issue \u2014 offers a telling snapshot of just how new a moment the network is looking to create.\n\nCBS launches its fall schedule this week \u2014 Thursday\u2019s \u201cEvil\u201d premiere is one of some half-dozen new series on the network with blockbuster dreams. But amid the traditional rollout of broadcast hopefuls is one of the trickier balances in modern TV. CBS must advance a diverse and socially conscious post-Moonves form of storytelling without abandoning the middle-of-the-road formula he rode to great success.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to figure out the next generation of shows and make some unexpected moves while still appealing to the core CBS audience,\u201d said David Nevins, CBS\u2019 chief creative officer and Moonves\u2019 programming successor. \u201cWe can broaden and we can be more surprising, but without alienating people.\u201d\n\n\n\nDavid Nevins. (Evan Agostini/Invision/AP)\n\nCBS has been the most-watched broadcast network every year for the past 11 \u2014 meaning its primetime shows average the most (if not the youngest) viewers. That was largely the handiwork of Moonves, who relied on well-worn techniques like star casting and trusty formats such as crime-solving dramas and broad comedies, often ignoring the socially and narratively ambitious shows becoming popular elsewhere. Under the disgraced mogul, the network effortlessly launched one hit after another \u2014 like \u201cNCIS,\u201d which, with 16 million viewers last season, was the most watched drama on broadcast television.\n\nYet CBS executives know they need to move on from the Moonves mindset \u2014 in part to cleanse the palette post-scandal but also to attract younger audiences at a network where the viewer median age is nearly 60.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a realization throughout the company that the TV landscape is changing and we have to change with it if we want to stay relevant,\u201d said Kelly Kahl, CBS\u2019 president of entertainment, referring to younger-skewing hits like \u201cThis Is Us\u201d on rival NBC and a slew of Netflix and HBO programming that competes for viewer mindshare. \u201cWe have to dig a little deeper.\u201d\n\nSeveral new shows embody the goal.\n\nThere is \u201cThe Unicorn,\u201d a half-hour program centering on a widower dad looking to return to the dating scene. The single-camera show often brings a touch of melancholy.\n\nCBS also is debuting \u201cBob Hearts Abishola,\u201d which features go-to producer kingmaker Chuck Lorre, known for white-bread comedy hits like \u201cTwo and a Half Men\u201d and \u201cThe Big Bang Theory.\u201d But this time Lorre is coming at the network with a muticultural romance between a Midwestern white salesman and a Nigerian immigrant that addresses questions of assimilation and alienation.\n\nPerhaps the best example of the new direction is \u201cEvil.\u201d\n\nThe show centers on the rival worldviews of a psychologist, a priest and a contractor as they investigate assorted crimes. With a cast anchored by the Dutch actress Katja Herbers, the African-American actor Mike Colter and Aasif Mandvi, of British-Indian background, it is CBS\u2019 most woke show in some time.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s be honest: This isn\u2019t a role I would have gotten to play five years ago,\u201d Mandvi said. \u201cIt would have gone to a white guy.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe full cast of \"Evil\" screening at the 2019 Tribeca TV Festival in New York City. The show is one of several bold gambles for a post-Leslie Moonves CBS. (Roy Rochlin/Getty Images For Tribeca Tv Fest)\n\nIt is also CBS\u2019 most ambitious show in some time. Moonves\u2019 best known franchises were tidy mysteries that didn\u2019t go heavy on topicality. \u201cEvil,\u201d on the other hand, takes on mass shooters, social-media radicalism and questions of faith and reason. And it will run for a cable-like 15 episodes, compared to network\u2019s traditional 22.\n\nThe series comes from Robert and Michelle King, the duo that created the drama \u201cThe Good Wife\u201d for CBS a decade ago but moved to the company\u2019s ambitious streaming platform CBS All Access for its politically minded spinoff \u201cThe Good Fight\u201d in 2017.\n\nNow they\u2019re bringing their weighty new effort back to CBS.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re successful, we\u2019re in a big tent. And All-Access is not as big a tent,\u201d said Michelle King, explaining the decision to return as she sat with her husband and creative partner near the show\u2019s sound stage.\n\nStars said they felt the significance as they shot the series.\n\nHerbers, a veteran of \u201cThe Americans,\u201d \u201cThe Leftovers\u201d and \u201cWestworld,\u201d said she believes \u201cEvil\u201d has a lot in common with the other shows on her resume.\n\n\u201cSo far it doesn\u2019t feel different from them at all,\u201d she said. \u201cIt feels like we\u2019re trying to tell just as important a story as we did [with those].\"\n\nColter said he\u2019s \u201chappy to be on a network show that\u2019s pushing boundaries. Because the only way to compete with streaming is to push boundaries,\" he added.\"\n\nThe creators say that they can raise bold subjects, like Moonves, using subtlety.\n\n\u201cTo me, it\u2019s not specifically about Les Moonves,\u201d Robert King said of the episode involving the producer. \u201cBut it is about the question of \u2018is it all right to be a [jerk] at work because you\u2019re birthing something beautiful?\u2019 The show examines that mindset.\u201d\n\nThere will also be a mass shooter episode later in the season that elicited some difficult conversations with writers and the network in the wake of El Paso and Dayton. But the episode will proceed as planned, Robert King said.\n\nThe network shift is in part the result of the leadership of David Nevins, the longtime head of CBS\u2019s sister company Showtime who was named CBS\u2019 chief creative officer after Moonves\u2019 resigned last September. Moonves was officially fired for cause in December after a company investigation determined he was guilty of \u201cwillful and material malfeasance.\u201d\n\nNevins said he wants \u201cEmmy-caliber\u201d programming a \u2014 a major statement for a network that hasn\u2019t won an outstanding comedy or drama Emmy in 14 years. It\u2019s a particular challenge given the temptation to put its most prestigious shows on All Access -- and a merger with Viacom that could bring corporate pressure to work commercial-minded cable properties into the schedule.\n\nWhether the gamble will pay off in the ratings is also an open question.\n\n\u201cEvil\u201d has generated a high awareness level \u2013 26 percent of respondents in a new study from the research group Ipsos said they had an \u201cintent to view\u201d the series, the third-highest percentage of any new fall show. But such studies are iffy predictors.\n\nAnd some wonder how far CBS will \u2014 or should \u2014 go. The question, they say, cuts to the role of a broadcast network. While the trend now is toward edgier material, CBS has benefited from being a bulwark for the millions of viewers who aren\u2019t running to check out television\u2019s more provocative offerings.\n\nPreston Beckman, a longtime television executive at Fox and other companies, noted that the new shows will co-exist alongside several time-tested \u201cNCIS\u201d series, a new broad sitcom starring Patricia Heaton and the Dick Wolf drama \"FBI,\u201d which averaged nearly 13 million viewers last season, its first.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that in the end it will be all that different,\u201d Beckman said. \u201cThere is more emphasis on diversity. But I don\u2019t know that they will change how they operate. I don\u2019t know that they should want to change how they operate.\u201d\n\n\u201cCBS has never felt guilty about getting a lot of 50+ viewers,\u201d he said.\n\nNevins said that he felt this tension. \u201cWe\u2019ve done very well with older demographic.,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you also need to change. You don\u2019t want your audience to continually age.\"", "description": "A year removed from Leslie Moonves, CBS finds itself at a crossroads", "authors": ["Steven Zeitchik", "Reporter Covering The Business Of Entertainment In The U.S.", "September At Pm", "Steven Zeitchik Covers The Business Of Entertainment For The Washington Post", "Examining The Industry'S Trends", "Challenges", "Issues", "Ideas.
