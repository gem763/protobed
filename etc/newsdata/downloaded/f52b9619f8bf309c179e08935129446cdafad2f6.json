The still untitled superhero flick is slated to be released July 16, 2021.\n\n\u201cI am thrilled that Spidey\u2019s journey in the MCU will continue, and I and all of us at Marvel Studios are very excited that we get to keep working on it,\u201d said Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige in a statement published by the Hollywood Reporter.\n\n\u201cSpider-Man is a powerful icon and hero whose story crosses all ages and audiences around the globe,\u201d he added. \u201cHe also happens to be the only hero with the superpower to cross cinematic universes, so as Sony continues to develop their own Spidey-verse you never know what surprises the future might hold.\u201d\n\nLast month, some fans were left reeling when news broke that the two movie studios were unable to reach a compromise to keep the Sony-owned Spider-Man franchise, which its held the rights to since 1985, from continuing to fight alongside Disney\u2019s Avengers.

MCU\u2019s first stand-alone \u201cSpider-Man\u201d movie starring fan-favorite Holland, 2017\u2019s \u201cHomecoming,\u201d earned $880.2 million world-wide.
