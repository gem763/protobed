Again and again, uniformed and civilian officials have struggled to publicly reconcile Trump\u2019s statements with long-held national security views.\n\n\n\nThe concerns have prompted some former military officials to set aside what some within the ranks see as a code of military silence, culminating last week in an opinion piece calling for the president\u2019s replacement that was written by retired Adm. William McRaven, who headed U.S. Special Operations Command.\n\nAD\n\nThe United States is not powerful because of its military or economic might, McRaven wrote, but because its \u201cideals of universal freedom and equality have been backed up by our belief that we were champions of justice, the protectors of the less fortunate.\u201d The president, he implied, has betrayed that.\n\nAD\n\nThe comments form part of a history of retired and active duty officers occasionally taking public positions on policy matters or, more rarely, diving into politics. That record includes Gen. Douglas MacArthur\u2019s public challenging of President Harry S. Truman in 1951 and the \u201crevolt of the generals\u201d in 2006 against then-Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld.\n\nMore recently, retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn campaigned for Trump before the 2016 election and briefly served as his national security adviser the following year. Retired Gen. John Allen, meanwhile, campaigned for Hillary Clinton.\n\nAD\n\nBut the commentaries from those such as McRaven and Votel remain the exception rather than the norm within the Pentagon, potentially indicating both support within the ranks for many aspects of Trump\u2019s presidency, which has restored robust funding to the Pentagon, and a belief among many that a general\u2019s role is not to make policy calls.\n\nAD\n\nAmong those who have voiced that view is Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., who retired this year after serving as Trump\u2019s chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Dunford, who was first appointed by President Barack Obama and oversaw several divisive moves under Trump such as the redirection of military funds to pay for Trump\u2019s border wall, often said his job was to execute any orders that were legal and fell within the ability of U.S. forces to carry out.\n\nDefense Secretary Mark T. Esper \u2014 who took charge at the Pentagon this summer six months after his predecessor, Jim Mattis, a retired Marine general, resigned over Trump\u2019s handling of military alliances \u2014 has said he intends to keep the Pentagon out of politics.\n\nAD\n\nEsper has publicly supported the White House\u2019s Syria decision, suggesting the administration had no choice but to pull out nearly all 1,000 troops after Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan began preparing to attack Kurdish forces in Syria.\n\nAD\n\nMattis has repeatedly cited the code of silence as he has sidestepped questions about the president\u2019s policies during a flurry of public appearances promoting a new book, prompting disapproval from critics who say he should speak directly about his former boss or remain quiet. Mattis has chided other former military officials, including Flynn and Allen, for their political activism.\n\nThe former general made headlines again last week when he joked about Trump during a formal charity dinner. Some commentators interpreted the remarks as a sign Mattis was adopting a more critical stance. But his ribbing did not address the president\u2019s handling of security affairs.\n\nAD\n\nLoren DeJonge Schulman, a former Pentagon and White House official, said military views, which tend to be given special credence in today\u2019s polarized society, also had the potential to be used for political ends. Or, she said, \u201cwhat if the military begins using its own political power in a more organized fashion that only represents particular factions?\u2019\n\nAD\n\nScholars and officers agree that in a properly functioning system, uniformed leaders are supposed to privately share their advice with civilian leaders and, if necessary, their objections about a particular course of action. But some say those norms on which that process was built are now being strained.\n\n\u201cThe best way for a democracy to work is not for bureaucracies to slow-roll and second-guess\u201d decisions made by elected leaders, said Jason Dempsey, a former infantry officer who writes about civil-military relations at the Center for a New American Security. But the system is also predicated on \u201cgood faith among all the factors operating within known bureaucratic boundaries,\u201d Dempsey said.\n\nAD\n\nDerek Chollet, an assistant defense secretary under Obama, said the push-and-pull felt within the military community probably would intensify as what is sure to be a divisive presidential election approaches. \u201cThe military, whether it likes it or not, is going to get caught up in this in ways that are going to be very uncomfortable, for it and for us,\u201d he said.\n\nAD\n\nThe discomfort appeared to be captured last week by a photo tweeted by Trump showing him in a standoff with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) during a meeting of senior administration and congressional officials at the White House. The president sought to draw attention to what he characterized as a \u201cmeltdown\u201d by Pelosi, but the photo also shows Trump\u2019s new chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Gen. Mark A. Milley, sitting to his right.\n\nWhile most of the officials are looking on at the Trump-Pelosi exchange, Milley, who took on the military\u2019s highest-ranking role less than a month ago, is staring down at his hands, his face tight.\n\nGreg Jaffe contributed to this report.\n\nAD", "description": "Unusual flurry of commentary exposes an internal debate over the military\u2019s role in foreign policy and the responsibility of uniformed officials to speak out publicly.", "authors": ["Missy Ryan", "Reporter Covering The Pentagon", "Military Issues", "National Security"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/g-D2RCDERkjTk8t4tfO6sTsKJBM=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/Y3JWISXSWAI6TCPL5RLM2QKHGI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
