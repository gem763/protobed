Johnson told the German chancellor that this demand, along with the EU\u2019s unwillingness to engage with his new proposals, makes a deal essentially impossible.\n\nWith little progress made in recent days, U.K. officials now believe Brexit talks are close to collapse. The BBC, which first reported details of the conversation, said Johnson\u2019s office regarded the call as a clarifying moment.\n\nBrexit Deal Looks \u2018Difficult,\u2019 DUP Says (10 a.m.)\n\nDUP Deputy Leader Nigel Dodds said it looks unlikely a deal to break the impasse over Brexit will be reached this week, as the U.K. and EU remain divided over a plan which would effectively offer his party a veto over measures to avoid a hard border in Ireland.\n\nIn an interview with Bloomberg TV, he said he doesn\u2019t see Boris Johnson watering down the consent principle and accused Dublin of wanting to have \u201cits cake and eat it\u201d on the issue.\n\nIrish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar appears to be \u201cdesperate\u201d to avoid the blame for a no-deal Brexit, Dodds said.\n\nShapps Denies U.K. Planning to Punish EU States (Earlier)\n\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps denied the U.K. Government is drawing up plans to punish EU member states that agree to a delay to the Oct. 31 Brexit deadline. The threat was in a text message from one of Boris Johnson\u2019s advisers published by the Spectator magazine.\n\nThe note, attributed to a \u201ccontact in Number 10\u201d, said that any EU member state that agrees to delay Brexit would go to the back of the line for cooperation on defense and security.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case at all,\u201d Shapps told BBC Radio. He said it isn\u2019t clear who wrote the text and insisted the government is in serious talks with the EU to get a deal.\n\nRudd Accepts Case For Second Referendum (Earlier)\n\nAmber Rudd, who quit Boris Johnson\u2019s cabinet last month in protest at his Brexit policy, said she now accepts the case for a confirmatory vote on any deal agreed with the EU.\n\n\u201cWe need to look much more carefully about how to find a compromise,\u201d she told BBC Radio, accusing Johnson of giving up on reaching agreement with the bloc.\n\n\u201cI still believe that we could find a deal that gets through the House of Commons,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we need to make sure that the Number 10 machine works with MPs, stops expelling MPs -- perhaps from its own party, works cross-party with Labour, and yes, may indeed have to have a confirmatory referendum on a deal at some stage to get it through.\u201d\n\nU.K. Tweaks No-Deal Brexit Tariffs (Earlier)\n\nThe U.K. revamped the tariffs it will levy after a no-deal Brexit following warnings from industry that its earlier plans risked making domestic producers uncompetitive.\n\nImport duties for heavy goods vehicles will be reduced to 10%, in a boost to the road haulage industry, while levies for bio-ethanol will be raised and new tariffs for clothing introduced, the Department for International Trade said on Tuesday.\n\nEarlier:\n\nBoris Johnson Preparing for Brexit Talks to Collapse: SpectatorU.K. Tweaks No-Deal Brexit Tariffs for Trucks, Fuel and ClothingJohnson Warned Against Big Tax Cuts as U.K. Faces No-Deal Shock\n\n--With assistance from Anna Edwards.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Tim Ross in London at tross54@bloomberg.net;Jessica Shankleman in London at jshankleman@bloomberg.net;Dara Doyle in Dublin at ddoyle1@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Tim Ross at tross54@bloomberg.net, Thomas Penny\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Follow @Brexit\u00a0and\u00a0sign up to our Brexit Bulletin.\u00a0Boris Johnson told German Chancellor Angela Merkel a Brexit deal is essentially impossible if the EU demands Northern Ireland should stay in the bloc\u2019s customs union.
