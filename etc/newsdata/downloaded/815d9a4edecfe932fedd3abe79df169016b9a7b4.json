With the U.S. Food and Drug Administration urging people to avoid buying unregulated vape products, other U.S. experts say people should avoid all e-cigarettes until the cause is clear.\n\nIn European countries like the U.K. and France, which have voluntary reporting systems, there\u2019s not much evidence of this problem, and experts cite tighter e-cigarette regulations in Europe than the U.S.\n\n\u201cWe have not seen anything like what we\u2019ve seen in the U.S. recently in Europe, to my knowledge as a scientist, and I\u2019m pretty aware of the field,\u201d said Constantine Vardavas, the European Respiratory Society\u2019s scientific relations director with the EU.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re terrifying people who are benefiting from vaping by not smoking.\u201d \u2014 Clive Bates, former chief of the U.K. charity Action on Smoking and Health\n\nBut while several EU and national agencies said they are monitoring the U.S. situation, they weren\u2019t always able to say who\u2019s keeping track on this side of the Atlantic. An EU-wide reporting system is still in the works, and a broad analysis of e-cigarette safety is only due in the fall of 2020.\n\nSome EU experts say there\u2019s no reason to think this side of the Atlantic will be immune.\n\nThough the cases are currently limited to the U.S., the Portuguese Society of Pulmonology said in a statement Wednesday that \u201cthey are likely to arise in other countries, including Portugal,\u201d given the widespread availability of e-cigarettes.\n\n\u201cThe use of electronic cigarettes is dangerous and not recommended,\u201d the society said.\n\nThe lesser evil\n\nThis debate has extra resonance in the U.K., where the government has embraced e-cigarettes as a way to wean people off tobacco.\n\nThere, officials say the worst thing people could do is go back to regular cigarettes out of fears that vapes could land them in the hospital with a major lung malfunction.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re terrifying people who are benefiting from vaping by not smoking,\u201d said Clive Bates, a former chief of the U.K. charity Action on Smoking and Health (ASH) and a strong defender of e-cigarettes as a smoking cessation tool.\n\nBates argued that authorities should be delivering more targeted warnings about unregulated products. Instead, he said the U.S. medical establishment is creating one of the \u201cdarkest episodes in American public health ... They have lost all their moorings with evidence and good practice.\u201d\n\nThe U.K. has the world\u2019s third-highest uptake of e-cigarettes, and government health officials promote vapes as a way to wean people off more harmful tobacco. Over the past year, according to the country\u2019s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), only 12 incidents of health problems with nicotine-containing e-cigarettes have been reported to the regulator\u2019s voluntary system.\n\nAmong those, seven involved respiratory problems, and none of the cases were considered serious or required hospitalization. (Even in these cases, it\u2019s not known if the e-cigarette was the cause of the reported problems.)\n\nBut there are some major caveats that leave room for concern. The U.K. has seen at least one case that has key similarities with the U.S. \u201cvaping sickness,\u201d which is essentially lipoid pneumonia \u2014 the accumulation of fat particles in the lungs. Doctors suspected the patient\u2019s vaping liquid was to blame.\n\nThe case, discussed in the BMJ, does not appeared to have been logged with the U.K. regulator. A separate system to report problems with illicit drugs is still in a pilot phase.\n\nEU regulations also put the burden on manufacturers and importers to look out for health problems and address them.\n\nMeanwhile, the cases in the U.S. increasingly appear to involve vape liquid containing THC, which is still illegal in the majority of EU countries (as well as most U.S. states). That may mean reporting systems aren\u2019t taking all the products people actually use into account. The MHRA's system accounts only for nicotine-based vapes.\n\nMartin Dockrell, head of tobacco control at Public Health England, was quick to offer reassurances about the safety of legal vapes. \u201cWhat little we know of recent reports from the U.S. is that the devices used appear to be linked to \u2018home brews\u2019 of illicit drugs and not legitimate vaping products,\u201d he said. \u201cUnlike the U.K., which has strict regulation ... on e-cigarette safety, the U.S. has no regulation.\u201d\n\nOnly in America?\n\nU.S. regulators inspect some vape manufacturing sites and bar some ingredients from e-cigarette liquids. But that oversight is considerably less comprehensive than the EU\u2019s Tobacco Products Directive, which restricts ingredients and limits the level of nicotine in products.\n\nEU regulations also put the burden on manufacturers and importers to look out for health problems and address them.\n\nManufacturers have to notify in advance the contents of e-liquids \u2014 meaning officials at least know which legal products contain oils that could collect in the lungs, making them easier to recall if necessary.\n\nYet when it comes to home brews, \u201cthat of course is difficult to regulate,\u201d said Vardavas.\n\nAround the EU, poison control centers seem to be the most regular go-to outlet for documenting safety concerns. A 2017 analysis of 10 countries found that kids ingesting the vape liquid is the most commonly reported problem.\n\n\u201cPeople are dying from vaping, so we\u2019re looking at it very closely.\u201d \u2014 Donald Trump\n\nIn France, \u201cinvestigations are underway\u201d to determine whether there are any cases similar to the U.S., a spokesperson for the ministry of health said. So far, there\u2019ve been no reports. Professional societies have been asked to trace cases, the spokesperson said in an email.\n\nThe EU is gearing up for a more coordinated approach. Vardavas is involved in an EU-funded project to help countries enforce the Tobacco Products Directive, and among their goals is to create a common reporting sheet for adverse events, he said.\n\nThe European Commission said it has asked a panel of outside scientific advisers to issue an opinion about the health risks of e-cigarettes to feed into a report due in May 2021 \u2014 making that the earliest date at which data is likely to be available.\n\nIn announcing his plans Wednesday, Trump said, \u201cWe can\u2019t allow people to get sick and we can\u2019t have our youth be so affected.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople are dying from vaping, so we\u2019re looking at it very closely,\u201d he said during an Oval Office appearance with senior U.S. health officials.\n\nDeborah Arnott, ASH\u2019s chief executive, noted that 480,000 people die in the U.S. each year from tobacco-related conditions.\n\nWhile Public Health England wouldn\u2019t comment directly on U.S. recommendations, John Newton, its director of health improvement, stressed: \u201cThere is no situation where it would be better for your health to continue smoking rather than switching completely to vaping.\u201d", "description": "There\u2019s no sign of the sickness in Europe \u2014 but nobody is keeping track.", "authors": ["Sarah Wheaton", "Jillian Deutsch", "Helen Collis"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-454245786-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
