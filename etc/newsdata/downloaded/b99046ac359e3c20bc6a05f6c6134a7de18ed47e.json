He believes the U.S. will narrowly avoid a recession, with the S&P 500 rising 4% to 3,100 points by the end of 2019. This should then climb 14% to 3,400 by the end of 2020.\n\nSo what now? Here we take a closer look at five stocks to buy with bullish calls from Goldman Sachs. Furthermore, as you will see, each of these stocks shows over 20% upside potential from current levels. That means now is a particularly compelling time to buy in. Let\u2019s take a closer look at which stocks are on Goldman Sachs\u2019 buy list now:\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nStocks to Buy: Uber Technologies (UBER)\n\nStocks to Buy: Uber Technologies (UBER) More\n\nSource: NYCStock / Shutterstock.com\n\nUber (NYSE:UBER) stock is down 17% since its initial public offering (IPO). But Goldman\u2019s Heath Terry isn\u2019t going anywhere. The analyst has a buy rating on the stock with a $56 price target. With shares trading at such weak levels, his price target now indicates attractive upside potential of 66%.\n\n\u201cWhile there are considerable risks in ownership across the space given the intense competition, regulatory issues, and operating pressures, we continue to believe the risk/reward in owning the leader in this space is favorable and we remain Buy-rated,\u201d Terry explained.\n\nEven though Q2 earnings failed to impress, Terry took heart from the fact that bookings were in-line with consensus forecasts and its adjusted EBITDA beat consensus. In addition, UBER also offered initial FY19 guidance that bracketed consensus for gross bookings and was better than consensus for adjusted EBITDA losses.\n\nUber still has a Strong Buy analyst consensus rating. That\u2019s with an average price target of $54 (57% upside potential). For instance, SunTrust\u2019s Youssef Squali summed up the bull case succinctly: \u201cWe remain positive on UBER post solid, though noisy, 2Q19 results\u2026 UBER remains a generational company compounding at scale, taking advantage of a massively inefficient transportation market.\u201d Interested in Uber?

This recommendation is reserved for stocks the firm holds in particularly high regard.\n\nCovering the Chinese e-commerce giant is Goldman\u2019s Piyush Mubayi, who reiterated his bullish call following better-than-expected fiscal Q1 earnings results. His BABA stock price target currently stands at $236 indicating upside potential of 34% from the current $176 share price.\n\n\u201cWe remain impressed with Alibaba\u2019s overall leverage to China consumption growth given its strategy, positioning, ability to build new businesses (such as new retail) and its execution,\u201d Mubayi told clients. \u201cWe expect Alibaba to continue to invest for future growth on multiple fronts.\u201d\n\nThe analyst highlights the company\u2019s growing cloud and financial businesses: \u201cIn our view, the continuous investment in cloud technology demonstrates Alibaba\u2019s determination to solidify its leading position in the industry and take up more market share in the future,\u201d he said. \u201cWe believe Ant Financial will continue to be the \u2018enabler\u2019 of Alibaba\u2019s New Retail strategy and help the company navigate the globalization road map.\u201d\n\nEven without co-founder Jack Ma at the helm, analysts continue to favor Alibaba stock. In the last three months, 16 analysts have published back-to-back buy ratings on the stock. Their average price target stands at $228.
