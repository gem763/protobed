The associate also said Sondland and Taylor did not grasp that a reference to the gas company Burisma was in fact a reference to Hunter Biden.\n\nThe comments underscore Sondland\u2019s eagerness to draw a line between himself and the president in the rapidly-unfolding scandal.\n\n\u201cIt appears that Sondland \u2026 and Taylor disagree only on whether Sondland knew that there was a linkage in aid,\u201d said the associate. \u201cOn all other points (that they wanted the aid restored, wanted a WH visit for [Ukrainian President Volodymyr] Zelensky, didn\u2019t want to have to deal with Rudy [Giuliani], etc.) they are aligned.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think Sondland would say that, like everyone, they speculated about the aid linkage, but never knew,\u201d the associate continued. \u201cNo one, least of all Taylor, suggests that Sondland had any role in the aid cutoff; the only question is whether Sondland had heard that from Trump (or Volker or Giuliani).\u201d\n\nKurt Volker is the president's former special envoy to Ukraine who was a key player early on in the Ukraine scandal. He was one of Democrats\u2019 first witnesses in their ongoing impeachment inquiry.\n\nSondland\u2019s associate noted that Sondland himself acknowledged one component of the alleged quid pro quo Trump hung over Zelensky: that a White House meeting for Zelensky was put on hold pending a public statement from the Ukrainian president that he would launch two investigations demanded by Trump.\n\nThose investigations included a probe into a debunked conspiracy theory that Ukraine -- not Russia -- hacked a Democratic server during the 2016 election, as well as an investigation of Burisma, the Ukrainian energy company for whom Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter sat on the board.\n\nSondland told lawmakers that he didn\u2019t understand Burisma to be \u201ccode for Biden\u201d when he spoke to Trump and that he and Taylor worked together on the statement Trump wanted Zelensky to make.\n\nRegardless of the discrepancy between Sondland and Taylor over aid, Sondland\u2019s associate said even if the E.U. ambassador had known of Trump\u2019s full intentions he would have been just \u201ca witness\u201d -- not an active participant in the decision to withhold aid, which he opposed.\n\n\u201cNo one is suggesting that he was anything other than opposed to the aid cutoff, and he told the committee that he thought linking the two would be wrong,\u201d the associate said. \u201cLess here than meets the eye, is my only point.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe points in common between Taylor and Sondland (and also Volker) are far more important than the points of difference,\u201d he added.\n\nTaylor raised a slew of questions about Sondland in his Tuesday testimony, which seemed to jolt Democrats into a sense of renewed urgency in their impeachment probe. Taylor indicated that he pressed Sondland in text messages about whether Ukrainian military aid was conditioned on Trump\u2019s demand for investigations into Burisma and 2016. And Sondland replied by asking for a phone call.\n\n\u201cDuring that phone call, Ambassador Sondland told me that President Trump had told him that he wants President Zelensky to state publicly that Ukraine will investigate Burisma and alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U. S. election,\u201d Taylor testified.\n\nIn a set of text messages provided to House investigators, Sondland on Sept. 9 assured Taylor that there were in fact \u201cno quid pro quos\u201d of any kind authorized by the president. Rather, Trump\u2019s goal in Ukraine, he said, was about transparency and fighting corruption. He also urged Taylor and Volker to refrain from communicating via text.\n\nSondland told lawmakers in testimony last week that his assertion of \u201cno quid pro quos\u201d was not based on actual knowledge but on an assurance he received from Trump in a phone call that same night.\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS POLITICO Playbook Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics.

He sought to align himself with the career State Department officials who have raised significant concerns about Trump\u2019s posture toward Ukraine, as well as the president\u2019s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, who was leading a shadow operation to circumvent normal diplomatic channels to pressure Zelensky.\n\nAfter Sondland testified, several Democratic lawmakers panned his performance as underwhelming, claiming he often used the phrase \u201cI cannot recall\u201d and could not remember specific details. And some lawmakers even suggested that Sondland perjured himself.\n\nTaylor testified that Sondland told him that \u201ceverything\u201d \u2014 including critical military aid and a meeting between Trump and Zelensky \u2014 was contingent on the Ukrainians publicly announcing investigations targeting Trump\u2019s political rivals.\n\nSondland also said, according to Taylor, that Trump personally told him that he wanted Ukrainian officials to \u201cstate publicly\u201d that they would open such investigations in order for the military aid to flow to the besieged eastern European nation.\n\n\u201cAmbassador Sondland tried to explain to me that President Trump is a businessman. When a businessman is about to sign a check to someone who owes him something, he said, the businessman asks that person to pay up before signing the check,\u201d Taylor said, according to his opening statement.\n\nAndrew Desiderio contributed reporting to this story.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/be/1a/ad5ba44f44029d632303029b0f54/191023-sondland-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
