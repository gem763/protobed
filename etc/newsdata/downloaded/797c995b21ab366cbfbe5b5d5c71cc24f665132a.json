According to Entertainment Weekly, frontman Ryan Tedder told New York\u2019s Z100 this weekend that just one of the band\u2019s songs on their upcoming album Human features three huge names. \u201cWe have one song featuring Beyonc\u00e9 and Adele with a Chris Martin piano solo on the bridge,\u201d he revealed.\n\nObviously, the Chris Martin contribution will be instrumental (and, based on what we know about Coldplay, melancholy in an affecting pop way), but is there any chance the combination of Beyonc\u00e9, Adele and OneRepublic on one single will prove to be too much? Might it overwhelm the senses, like a lobster stuffed with tacos baked inside a calzone, or mint chocolate chip ice cream mixed with chocolate peanut butter? Or, is that what we should be hoping for? Tedder himself helped produce and co-write \u201cHalo,\u201d \u201cXO,\u201d and \u201cI Was Here\u201d for Beyonc\u00e9, in addition to Adele\u2019s \u201cRemedy,\u201d \u201cRumor Has It\u201d and \u201cTurning Tables,\u201d so maybe he just blended all of those together, knowing we are finally ready for whatever came out the other side.", "description": "The band OneRepublic says one of their upcoming songs features both Adele and Beyonc\u00e9 and a piano solo from Coldplay\u2019s Chris Martin.", "authors": ["Halle Kiefer"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/08/26/29-Beyonce-Adele.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
