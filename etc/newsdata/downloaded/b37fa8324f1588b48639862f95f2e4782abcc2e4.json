I just think every internet platform has a responsibility to fund and form partnerships for news,\u201d Facebook FB, +0.81% Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said Friday in an hour-long \u201cfireside chat\u201d in New York with News Corp CEO Robert Thomson.\n\n\u201cI care about giving people a voice,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cAt the end of the day, in order for that to be valuable, there needs to be a strong and free press \u2026 and have that at scale.\u201d\n\nFacebook News Tab, a new section being offered initially in the U.S. to a test group of about 200,000 users and up to 30 million over the next several years, culls content from about 200 news publishers \u2014 including News Corp\u2019s Wall Street Journal, Fox News Channel, Bloomberg, NPR and the New Yorker. Zuckerberg said the deals are structured to pay partners based on the amount and value of the content they provide. The Silicon Valley company has pledged to spend $300 million over the next three years to support local news providers.\n\nFacebook\u2019s decision to financially support journalism \u201cis a powerful precedent that will echo around editorial departments,\u201d Thomson said.\n\n\u201cI do have one question: What took you so long?\u201d Thomson quipped at the beginning of the conversation. Zuckerberg responded, \u201cAfter the last few years, I now have an appreciation that that is the nicest thing he could have said, because that means that he thinks we actually did something good.\u201d\n\nAnother pointed question is whether the social-networking giant\u2019s digital news rack \u2014 featuring content from The Wall Street Journal, USA Today and others \u2014 can restore credibility to a company and vast social platform that is widely viewed with skepticism.\n\nZuckerberg arrived in New York shortly after being grilled by members of the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday, on everything from Facebook\u2019s problematic Libra cryptocurrency project to its decision not to fact-check political ads on its site. On at least one occasion, the company\u2019s co-founder acknowledged its tattered reputation.\n\nRead more: Facebook\u2019s Zuckerberg faces Capitol Hill heat on Libra, elections fraud\n\nIndeed, 62% of American adults say social networks have too much control over the mix of news they see, and 55% said the role social-media companies play results in a worse mix of news, according to a Pew Research Center survey in July.\n\nFacebook now joins forces with a media industry that has suffered significantly because of lost ad revenue to Facebook and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s GOOGL, +0.41% GOOG, +0.33% Google division.\n\nShares of Facebook were up slightly Friday at $187.89, and have risen 43% this year.
