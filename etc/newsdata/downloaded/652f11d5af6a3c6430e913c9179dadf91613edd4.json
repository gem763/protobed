You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nNHS dental prices have seen a 5 per cent increase in 2019, the latest of five annual price hikes.\n\nA check up in England and Wales now costs \u00a322.70, filling or extractions come in at \u00a362.10 and a crown or false tooth will set you back \u00a3269.30 this year \u2013 assuming you\u2019re not exempt for reasons including maternity and pregnancy or on certain benefits.\n\nIn Scotland and Northern Ireland you\u2019ll be charged up to 80 per cent of the fees to a maximum of \u00a3384 per treatment.\n\nSo if your regular (or not so regular) trips to the dentist involves parting with hundreds of pounds, it\u2019s time to look at other ways to pay.\n\nProtecting your gnashers\n\nYou basically have four different ways to smooth out the painful cost of visiting the dentist.\n\nAs with all insurances you could opt for the DIY option \u2013 especially if your teeth are in good condition \u2013 and simply set aside the chunk of cash you\u2019d otherwise pay in premiums every month and put it in a high-earning, easy-access current or savings account just in case.\n\nThe pros include having the cash to spend elsewhere if it isn\u2019t needed and the cons could mean having to top up the pot to cover treatment.\n\nShow me the money\n\nThe next step up is the cash plan option. No, this isn\u2019t where you somehow buy a new TV and magically your dentistry is paid for.\n\nDesigned to cover routine appointments and treatments rather than insuring against unforeseen circumstances like life, critical illness, health and income protection policies do, the basic premise is that you buy the cover and pay for the treatment which is then reimbursed through your policy.\n\nThese policies, starting from around \u00a35 a month, bundle a series of standard treatments in together, usually including check-ups at the opticians and any physiotherapy needs with a maximum cash pool for each.\n\nWell-known providers include BUPA, SimplyHealth and Health Shield.\n\nSome also include contingency for complementary treatment like teeth whitening or even a massage. Your policy may also cover treatment for your children and partner at no extra cost. (Though remember children get free NHS dentist treatment until the age of 18.)\n\nCheck this kind of plan isn\u2019t already provided as a workplace perk. If it isn\u2019t, try to work out what you\u2019re likely to get out of a cash plan option, compared with the premiums you\u2019ll pay in, to check if you\u2019ll be better off.\n\nAnd do remember to actually make a claim if you do incur costs. Many people forget, making their plan expensive and pointless.\n\nDentist\u2019s deal\n\nMost of those with a dental insurance policy in place have bought it through their dentist.\n\nThe dentist will first inspect your teeth to work out how much treatment you\u2019ll need in a year, before breaking it down into monthly costs. You pay the insurer and they pay the dentist.\n\nKnown as a capitation plan, these are popular with those who don\u2019t want to worry about having to pay larger amounts on the spot at the dentist. But keep an eye on the value of the treatment you receive each year to make sure they match up with your annual payments.\n\nGoing it alone\n\nA full-blown, standalone dental insurance policy will cover you for both routine and emergency treatment, including damage from accidents that require immediate attention.\n\nAgain, payment is initially made by the policyholder which is then reimbursed.\n\nStarting at around \u00a36 a month, there are a range of options to consider here, including the excess you\u2019re willing to pay on any claim. Lower-cost policies will only cover NHS work, while more expensive options should include private dentistry costs.\n\nUsually, you\u2019d expect a policy to at least cover routine NHS treatment such as check-ups and cleaning, a certain amount to cover more expensive NHS treatments such as crowns or fillings, and emergency care.\n\nWorldwide cover may also be included in your policy and you may receive a lump sum if you are diagnosed with oral cancer.\n\nAs with all insurance policies you won\u2019t be covered for pre-existing conditions or, usually, anything that requires treatment in the first three months of the policy.", "description": "We don\u2019t describe particularly unpleasant experiences as \u201clike pulling teeth\u201d\u00a0for nothing.
