Stadia Founder\u2019s Edition has completely sold out. We can\u2019t wait to welcome all of our Founders to play Stadia on November 19.\n\n\n\nStadia Premiere Edition is now available for pre-order in all launch countries.

And that looks likely, based on the messages we see when we try to order a Premiere Edition right now. Google\u2019s online store shows that if you order a Premiere Edition today, it should ship sometime in November even if you don\u2019t pay for expedited shipping.\n\nStadia will launch more broadly in 2020 for Chrome web browsers, laptops, tablets and Pixel phones. You won\u2019t need to buy either the Founder\u2019s Edition or Premiere Edition kit if you\u2019re willing to wait.", "description": "Google tells The Verge that neither Founder\u2019s Edition or Premiere Edition buyers will necessarily be able to play at 9AM PT on November 19th, the moment that Stadia launches, because Google\u2019s shipping out kits in the order they were received, and the new Premiere Edition apparently won\u2019t have shipped by that date.", "authors": ["Jay Peters", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qICWCXV6miDSdElpOMR-hSXj8Wc=/0x168:3397x1947/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16323445/stadia_founders_edition.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
