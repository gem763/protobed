These sexist titles cannot co-exist in a society that claims to care about sexual harassment and other forms of mistreatment of women.\n\n'The sexist behavior of the St Kevin\u2019s students just this week is a reflection of boys\u2019 conditioning by a p*rnified culture. They learn early that women exist for their gratification. We can\u2019t change behavior without addressing the cultural normalising of it. A sexist culture grooms sexist boys.'\n\nCollective Shout campaigns against the objectification of women and the sexualisation of girls, according to its website.\n\nDaily Mail Australia has approached Bauer Media for comment.", "description": "Australian magazines Picture and The People, which are both published by\u00a0Bauer Media, will be pulled from production at the end of the year.", "authors": ["Kelsey Wilkie For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/05/20067752-0-image-a-21_1571803589594.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
