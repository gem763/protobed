He insists he and his party support democracy and reject neo-Nazi ideology.\n\nYet Der Spiegel, citing a leaked briefing by the German embassy in Athens, reports that Kalbitz was part of a group who travelled to the Greek capital in January 2007 to participate in a march organized by the Patriot Alliance, a now-defunct ultranationalist party set up by members of the Greek neo-Nazi party Golden Dawn.\n\nThe group \u2014 described in the embassy briefing as \"14 German neo-Nazis,\" according to Der Spiegel \u2014 included Udo Voigt, a former MEP and ex-leader of the neo-Nazi National Democratic Party (NPD), a group German lawmakers have twice tried and failed to ban, as well as other members of the NPD leadership.\n\nThey came to the attention of the embassy as they had hung a swastika flag from the balcony of the hotel they were staying in. Unknown perpetrators, presumed by the embassy to belong to the local anarchist scene, later firebombed the hotel's entrance and the balcony.\n\nKalbitz confirmed to Der Spiegel that he had attended the gathering, but said that he had not been present during \"the arson attack and the events surrounding it.\" He also said he had never been a member of the NPD and that he did not enjoy the march: \"This event ... was not suited to arousing my further interest or approval, neither in its political aims nor the combination of participants.\"\n\nIt's not the first report linking Kalbitz to the right-wing extremist scene. On Thursday, German public broadcasters RBB and ARD reported that Kalbitz had attended a summer camp of a far-right youth group in 1993, when he was 20 years old. The group was later banned for trying to indoctrinate children with neo-Nazi ideology. Kalbitz has also been embroiled in a controversy over the production of a film described by a historian as a \"glorification\" of Adolf Hitler.\n\nVoters go the polls on Sunday in Brandenburg, where the AfD is polling neck-and-neck with Social Democrats, and in the larger neighboring state of Saxony, in which the far-right party is polling in second place. A third election in the former East Germany will take place on October 27 in Thuringia.", "description": "The far-right politician participated in a trip that saw a swastika flag hung from a hotel balcony.", "authors": ["Joshua Posaner"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-1170128527-1200x628.jpg"}
