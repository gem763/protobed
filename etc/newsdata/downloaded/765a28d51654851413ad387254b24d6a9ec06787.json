That\u2019s par for the course among American upper-middle-class and wealthy families.\n\nBut for an annoying and sizable minority, it just won\u2019t do. These parents aren\u2019t rich enough to buy their precious darlings admission to Ivy U by donating a building or endowing a professorship, and they aren\u2019t corrupt or clueless enough to commit bribery or fraud to give their kids a backdoor entree, like the parents charged in the recent college-admissions scandal.\n\nBut affluent parents from Potomac, Md. to The Woodlands, Texas, are bending the rules big time by getting disability status for their kids to give them a longer time to take tests; changing their legal family structure to qualify for financial aid; browbeating admissions counselors at their kids\u2019 schools or even anonymously dissing other children to boost their own kids\u2019 chances.\n\nCall it \u201cRich Parents Behaving Badly,\u201d like \u201cDesperate Housewives\u201d meets \u201cBig Little Lies.\u201d Even worse, these aren\u2019t the stereotypical immigrant strivers clawing their way into the middle class; these people already have ample privileges, like legacy admissions preferences, to pass on to their children, but it\u2019s never enough.\n\nBack in June, The Wall Street Journal detailed the outrageous scheme, which is as prevalent in affluent ZIP Codes as zoning restrictions and luxury cars, to give kids extra time to take critical tests like the SAT or ACT.\n\nThe Journal reported that in rich communities like Scarsdale, N.Y., Weston, Conn., and Newton, Mass., between 20% and 33% of high-school students get \u201cextra time or another accommodation\u201d to complete college entrance exams, vs. less than 2% of students who attend high schools in poorer areas. Even 17% of students at Manhattan\u2019s tony private Trinity School, which sends 40% of its grads to the Ivy League, get some accommodation in test taking, The Journal reported.\n\nMany of these students get special waivers, called 504 designations, granted by their schools, that give them extra time on all exams they take in high school. They typically go to students who have anxiety issues or Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).\n\nTrue, ADHD is diagnosed more often these days, but poorer families can\u2019t afford to get a legitimate diagnosis, let alone a bogus one.\n\nPlus, the administrators of the SAT or ACT don\u2019t notify colleges which students had extra time to complete their tests. It\u2019s a loophole wide enough to drive a school bus through.\n\nThe other big scheme that should seem shocking but isn\u2019t was reported by ProPublica: Dozens of families in the Chicago suburbs are giving up legal guardianship of their children during their junior or senior years in high school, allowing them to declare themselves financially independent and thus qualify for more need-based financial aid.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a scam,\u201d Andy Borst, director of undergraduate admissions at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, told ProPublica. \u201cWealthy families are manipulating the financial aid process to be eligible for financial aid they would not be otherwise eligible for. They are taking away opportunities from families that really need it.\u201d\n\nRead: Parents giving up legal rights to their children to get more financial aid exposes deep flaws in U.S. college system\n\nMeanwhile, at the exclusive Sidwell Friends School in Washington, D.C., whose alumni include Nancy Reagan, Chelsea Clinton, and Sasha and Malia Obama, parents upset at how their kids fared in the college admissions process were so abusive that two of the school\u2019s college counselors resigned.\n\nSome parents even went \u201cso far as to disparage other students, presumably to give their own teens a leg up,\u201d The Washington Post reported. They apparently spread rumors and sent anonymous tips to administrators that other people\u2019s kids were just no darn good.\n\nIn an email, Bryan Garman, the head of the school, admonished parents that \u201cthe circulation of rumors about students and/or the verbal assault of employees are antithetical to the School\u2019s values,\u201d the newspaper reported.\n\nThat\u2019s an understatement: As a historically Quaker school, Sidwell Friends prizes enlightenment and tolerance. Some parents obviously never got the memo.\n\nI have no illusion horrible people like this will ever learn anything. But if there\u2019s any justice in this world, their kids will be dinged everywhere but their local community college. It would be the best thing that ever happened to the kids and exactly what the parents deserve.\n\nHoward R. Gold is a MarketWatch columnist.
