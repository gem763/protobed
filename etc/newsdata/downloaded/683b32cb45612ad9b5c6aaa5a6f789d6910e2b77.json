Wednesday\u2019s was the second cut in as many months. Fed officials think a few rate cuts will help the economy weather the uncertainty caused mainly by President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war with China.\n\nThere were three dissents from the quarter-point cut. That\u2019s the first time that trio of no votes have been case since September 2016. Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren and Kansas City Fed President Esther George voted against the move because they wanted the Fed to hold rates steady. They also voted against the Fed\u2019s cut in July. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard dissented because he wanted a more aggressive half-point cut.\n\nAt his press conference, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said the Fed will \u201cact as needed.\u201d\n\nSeven Fed officials said they believed there would be one more rate cut this year.\n\nRoberto Perli, a former Fed staff member and now an analyst at Cornerstone Macro, said he thinks this group includes Powell and other Fed leaders.\n\n\u201cOverall, my expectation for now is that, unless things improve markedly, the Fed will probably skip October before cutting again in December,\u201d Perli said.\n\nPowell will have to deal with some reluctance of the 17 member Fed committee.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s dot plot projections show five officials believed that this rate cut would be the year\u2019s last. Five more members thought no move was needed after July, including at Wednesday\u2019s meeting.\n\n\u201cOur business contacts around the country have been telling us that uncertainty is weighing on U.S. investment and exports,\u201d Powell told reporters at a briefing.\n\nPowell said the Fed sees a favorable economic outlook, but said there were risks.\n\n\u201cIf the economy does turn down, then a more extensive sequence of rate cuts could be appropriate,\u201d he said.\n\nTo address the volatility seen in money markets this week, the Fed trimmed the interest rate it pays banks for excess reserves parked at the central bank by 5 basis points to try to keep that rate within the range of the fed funds rate. The interest rate on excess reserves (IOER), will now be set at 1.80%. Financial firms had to pay much higher interest rates for excess reserves over the past two days.\n\nAnalysts said that some in the bond market might be disappointed by Powell\u2019s evasiveness about the balance sheet. \u201cAt one point, he almost sounded tone-deaf,\u201d Perli said. \u201cEventually, Powell said that it\u2019s possible that the Fed will have to restart growing the balance sheet sooner than it thought. I would say it\u2019s not only possible -- it\u2019s a virtual certainty,\u201d Perli said.\n\nStocks SPX, +0.03% DJIA, +0.13% traded lower ahead of the Fed\u2019s decision and deepened that drop in the wake of the announcement but then turned sufficiently upward in the final half-hour of the session to close modestly higher.\n\nPeter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group, said he saw a likelihood that this might be the last rate cut of the year. \u201cSo call this a hawkish cut,\u201d he said.\n\nBut others were impressed by the seven officials calling for another rate cut this year.\n\n\u201cThe fact that seven dots are calling for another cut means that our call that the next cut isn\u2019t until March is at risk,\u201d said Seth Carpenter, economist at UBS.", "description": "The Federal Reserve on Wednesday cut its benchmark interest-rate by a quarter point and seven officials indicated they believe there would be one more move...", "authors": ["Greg Robb", "Senior Economics Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR579_powell_ZG_20190918162918.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
