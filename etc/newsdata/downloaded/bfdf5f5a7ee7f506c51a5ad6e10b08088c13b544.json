His mother described him as a doting son who helped her through chemotherapy, while Toney said he was pained by the aftermath of the crash.\n\n\u2018This is something I gotta live with for the rest of my life. I probably will never forgive myself for it,\u2019 as reported by NOLA.com. \u2018I wish I could trade places with them. If I could, I would. I truly am sorry.\u2019\n\nHe also claimed to seldom drink and said his friends had given him tequila on the night of the crash as part of his 32nd birthday celebrations. He said he had no memory of getting behind the wheel of the car, or of the fatal impact.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve never been that type of person. I\u2019m not a violent person,\u2019 Toney said. \u2018Every day I wake up, I see myself on the news, and the news has painted me as this villain.\u2019\n\nToney appeared stone-faced on Monday as survivors of the crash and relatives of the deceased recounted the horrors of that fateful night for two hours\n\nToney\u2019s sister said despite the comments, their family are sorry and continue to pray for the victims.
