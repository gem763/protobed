Now we\u2019re turning our Art Club into an interview series in which we catch up with the artists and designers we admire and find out what drives them.\n\nMotion capture is commonly used in visual effects production for films and video games, and VR is often known as a solitary experience. But Sam and Andy Rolfes are taking these tools developed primarily for behind-the-scenes work and repurposing them for live, interactive, and crowd-driven shows. As Team Rolfes, the brothers work together as a design studio that leans heavily into abstraction and symbolism to create performative art that everyone in the room can enjoy.\n\nAt a Team Rolfes show, you\u2019ll see at least one model or dancer donned in cutting-edge fashion laced with motion capture tech. Their movements drive digital actors on-screen while they perform in real time with live music. The scene is a bizarre, hyper-stimulating one, captured through VR-controlled cameras. Everything is live and reactive. In a recent MoMA performance, they allowed audience members to upload photos directly from phones, which would retexture models in an apocalyptic wasteland in real time.\n\nAside from their personal work creating live shows that integrate dance, fashion, and music, they also work with brands, creating visuals for Nike, Adult Swim, and Super Deluxe. The duo currently has a residency at the Superchief Gallery in Brooklyn where we caught up with them to find out more about the theatrics of bringing hardware and software together.\n\nThis interview has been lightly edited for clarity and brevity.\n\nWhat\u2019s your background, and how did you get into this?\n\nSam Rolfes: Andy and I both come from kind of a painting background for one. We started out screen printing and doing mixed media painting, and then that developed into semi-digital things. Our mother ran a 3D studio when we were kids, so we got introduced briefly to Blender and things like that. But we found the wireframe meshes and stuff to be a little bit inexpressive and just kind of sterile and boring. I don\u2019t think our interest lasted more than a couple of years.\n\nAndy Rolfes: No, because you had to move vertices around to make swords. They\u2019re like, \u201cWell, 3D is math.\u201d What is this thing, and why is it so hard to make something cool?\n\n\u201cIt would send the characters just flying into the stratosphere.\u201d\n\nSR: Yeah, so we kind of lost interest off that. But then after graduating art school and being part of different music scenes and doing album art and flyers with certain amounts of digital elements \u2014 but always coming from a painting background \u2014 I found a program for 3D sculpting that was basically like modeling digital clay. So that made it a lot more expressive than just the engineering feel that we had been kind of messing with.\n\nAR: Name check. It\u2019s ZBrush.\n\nSR: ZBrush. So then we were able to kind of bring it back into 3D and start making things. And once you\u2019re able to start creating assets, characters, objects, and iterative development in there, it\u2019s a bit of work but not that much work to then rig it up and start animating it. I was misusing it, which was kind of a theme that comes back continually in our work. I was using it for live shows pretty immediately.\n\nThere are a couple of things I wanted to dive into there. Andy, you said you do a lot of the modeling. What\u2019s the breakdown of the process between you two?\n\nSR: It trades off a bit because Andy and I have different modeling styles. His is more classical and fashion-inspired. It\u2019s more realistic.\n\nAR: Yeah, like one style is more romanticized, humanist, surreal stuff, and then another one is I\u2019m making 3D brush strokes to create the form and mold. So it\u2019s a lot more fashion-inspired.\n\nSR: And mine\u2019s a little bit more destroyed and abstract or kind of gnarled generally, which I\u2019m trying to actually get better about, not fully saturating it.\n\nGenerally, with all of our stuff, the character personalities arise from the technical limitation. This suit can\u2019t move around the stage very well, so we generally have been locked in the space. And because of the sensors, it atrophies over time, so they get more and more gnarled. So mine are less human, generally.\n\nDoes that lead into you playing the more gnarled, less human characters?\n\nSR: Yeah. We have this other suit that\u2019s more accurate and can move around the stage. It doesn\u2019t get gnarled nearly as easily. So that one is more human characters, more representative characters.\n\nI\u2019ll also perform as the puppeting characters as well, which are generally the least human. We build a lot of different kind of character types based on the input controls.\n\nCan you play a character, record the animation, have it be live, and then go back and interact with that character yourself? Or is this kind of like one performer per character at a time?\n\nSR: You can see there are multiple characters moving based off my motion. We can set which suit controls which characters. I\u2019m moving around, but we\u2019ve got it tethered so that they just are locked at the hip. That\u2019s partially because the sensors in the suit are so sensitive. When I first started doing it, I didn\u2019t realize that. It would send the characters just flying into the stratosphere. And so I\u2019d walk into the next room, and there would be nobody there. And it\u2019d be like, \u201cWhat am I supposed to do?\u201d\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen anybody doing anti-capitalist work for Google.\u201d\n\nSo in the past, all these characters were controlled by me at the same time, but we\u2019re moving from space to space and that\u2019s how I control the progression. I start simpler and then go bigger, then go smaller.\n\nNow, we\u2019ve got two suits, and they can move around a bit more. So now we can have a dialogue and have multiple different pairs of characters interacting. But in terms of the playing against myself thing, that\u2019s what I did for Adult Swim where I played the main characters to be recorded here, and then I put on the VR headset and wore the thing I could see myself. And I was like, playing against myself.\n\nThat\u2019s not exactly in real time because we recorded it, and we play it back. But it\u2019s created live in a capacity, but they\u2019re not both happening live at the same time. Theoretically, you could potentially loop animation and play it back, which is an interesting idea. I would shy away from that personally onstage because then there becomes a question of what is live? And what is recorded?\n\nCan you talk about the hardware stuff you use and how you set that up for a show?\n\nSR: So live, we\u2019re now using two suits. It depends on the format, but we\u2019ve got this Shadow mocap suit. They sponsored us, and this is the baseline one we started with. They kind of helped us get going. We just got this Xsens\u2019 mocap suit that is the one that\u2019s able to kind of move around the stage more. It\u2019s a little more shielded from the electromagnetic frequencies and stuff. And that\u2019s for all the body control.\n\nWe also use the Vive, which is what we use for all the other spatial stuff. We\u2019ll use these Vive trackers for different props onstage, increasingly. But the key elements are primarily just these motion controls. I don\u2019t use the headset at all. I don\u2019t like it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot faster to make something beautiful in Unreal than it is Unity.\u201d\n\nMy issue is with the emerging experimental tech art world and its relation to increasingly vertically or integrated mega corps as the benefactor. And that relationship ends up being a nearly uncritical one when it doesn\u2019t really take into account the, I don\u2019t know, the conflict of interest maybe. But I haven\u2019t seen anybody doing anti-capitalist work for Google.\n\nHaving our practice arise entirely from picking these tools specifically because they arise from the body and expression and not just because they\u2019re the newest thing, I think, is like a big tenet of our studio.\n\nI want to ask about the software. I see you use Unreal Engine. Was that an aesthetic choice against Unity?\n\nSR: With that first \u201cAmnesia Scanner\u201d video, I tried both. And I realized pretty quickly that one, the visual scripting of Unreal is really intuitive to me because I learned Max ASP and other visual scripting things in art school.\n\nAR: Well, to put it more concisely, it\u2019s a lot faster to make something beautiful in Unreal than it is Unity. I worked for, I think, a couple of years in Unity, and it was nice and it\u2019s very stable and I can do a lot with it. God knows there\u2019s a lot of indie people who use it. But just getting it to this level, to me that\u2019s at least good to look at. You have to buy so many plug-ins, and just to get Unity up to that level, it\u2019s like, \u201cOkay. I made it pretty with all this post-processing, and now I can actually do visual scripting,\u201d which I don\u2019t think that should have... I think they just got visual scripting for the materials maybe, but they still have extra plug-ins for just based on all the stuff they have in Unreal. So it is that ease of use, a lot of it.\n\nSR: Now granted, getting it to run efficiently from that point is way harder in Unreal than Unity.\n\nYou\u2019ve done for work for Adult Swim and Super Deluxe. When a project like that comes along, do they come to you and say, \u201cMake us something\u201d?\n\nSR: Yeah, they come to us in different ways. Off the air, they\u2019ll be like, \u201cWe have a format. Can you make a quick animation for that?\u201d\n\nSuper Deluxe, we began a relationship with them and tested a lot of this live stuff out two years ago when we barely had a handle on how to do any of it, and they were super open to just experimenting.\n\nMusic is maybe a more typical example where it\u2019s like, \u201cWe\u2019ve got a song. We\u2019ve got a motif of some sort. Do you want to develop something for that?\u201d But the way it\u2019s been, my preference has often been having the musician bring us in because they feel something evocative in our work that matches theirs. Rather than being just part of the Rolodex of the video commissioner where they just kind of hit up everyone when they feel like, \u201cWe need a weird video. Let\u2019s get one of the weird guys.\u201d\n\nSo this is all visually scripted?\n\nSR: Yeah, all of it.\n\nOkay. So it\u2019s not like C# or anything like that? It\u2019s all no editor?\n\nSR: Entirely visually scripted, yeah. If I had the money and time, I\u2019d hire my more frequent developer, Eric, who works at Meow Wolf. They\u2019re a big bunker out in Santa Fe. They basically hired half my team. Our developer, our networks guy, our producer, all of them moved out to Santa Fe and started working with them. And we\u2019ve done a little bit of work with them, but they\u2019re all out there because they can have a steady income.\n\nWhat are you doing while you\u2019re at Superchief? What are you doing next?\n\nSR: We recorded all of our motion capture for the Adult Swim video here. We rehearsed with Justin for the MoMA thing here. Superchief has been an incredibly kind benefactor by allowing us to use all the space.\n\nWe just got back from touring a couple of dates in Australia. We played Dark Mofo Fest with Marshstepper, which is this big crazy choreographed thing with 10 people onstage and guest musicians. There was a ton of stuff going on, two stages, multiple projectors. It\u2019s this wild thing.\n\nNext, we\u2019re going to Berlin for Berlin Atonal with Marshstepper again. We\u2019re going to bringing in Raymond Pinta who we worked with previously here. It\u2019s this gigantic vertical screen in Kraftwerk \u2014 it\u2019s like three stories, just a gigantic vertical screen \u2014 and we\u2019ll be on the stage below doing a live stream.", "description": "Motion capture is commonly used in visual effects production for films and video games, and VR is often known as a solitary experience.
