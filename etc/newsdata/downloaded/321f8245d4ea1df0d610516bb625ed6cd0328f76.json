Hear me out. Whenever I\u2019m killing time, browsing through my friends\u2019 many Instagram stories, I will frequently come across some person or account going absolutely wild with their story posts.\n\nI love Hamilton, I do, and I think their social media game is strong and frequently interesting, but sometimes I just don\u2019t have the patience to tap through 40+ stories to get to the rest of my friends. See the problem? I\u2019ve been tapping.\n\nI\u2019m not sure why the thought ever occurred to me in all my time spent on Instagram, but if you\u2019re tapping through Instagram story after Instagram story to get through your queue, you\u2019re doing it wrong.\n\nInstead, if you want to skip an account\u2019s overwhelming number of Instagram stories at once, just swipe from right to left. And if you were too hasty in your decision, swipe from left to right to go back to the start of that previous account\u2019s stories.\n\nEasy, right? I\u2019m not quite done. If you\u2019re looking at Instagram\u2019s site on your desktop or laptop, you can also skip back and forth between different accounts when viewing stories. Instead of pressing the right and left arrow keys on your keyboard to move between individual stories, press the up or down arrows to skip to the next account that has stories to view.\n\nDo I feel dumb for not knowing these little shortcuts until this week? Yes. Has this saved me a ton of time? Absolutely. Now I can go look at even more Pomeranian videos instead of tapping through 100+ story posts each day.", "description": "I\u2019ve been doing Instagram all wrong. Hear me out.
