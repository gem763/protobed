(AP) - Patrick Mahomes and the high-flying Kansas City Chiefs have been the talk of the NFL for months, their innovation and points-a-plenty style making them one of the league\u2019s most entertaining offenses.\n\nThey might not even be the best one on the field Sunday.\n\nThat\u2019s because for all the gaudy numbers the Chiefs hung on Jacksonville and Oakland in roaring to a 2-0 start, Lamar Jackson and the Baltimore Ravens have been even more prolific.\n\nThey lead the league in total offense and points; Kansas City is merely third and fourth. They also lead in time of possession and rushing, they\u2019re fourth in passing and third-down percentage rate, and like the Chiefs they have yet to turn over the ball this season.\n\nSo what is making it all click for Jackson and the Ravens?\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s does a lot of things well,\u201d Chiefs coach Andy Reid said. \u201cEveryone kind of goes to his run game but he can throw the football. He\u2019s doing it with accuracy and he can do it all different levels, whether that\u2019s rolling out or in the pocket.\n\n\u201cHe has talent around him for sure,\u201d Reid added, \u201cbut the way it\u2019s slowed down for him, his reads are great and all those little things end up being big things.\u201d\n\nJust ask Mahomes, who mastered so many of those little things while rolling to league MVP in his first season as the Chiefs\u2019 starter. And all he\u2019s done for an encore is throw for 821 yards and seven TDs without an interception through the first two weeks of his season.\n\nIn other words, Mahomes vs Jackson should be a compelling game-within-a-game on Sunday.\n\nJust like it was last year.\n\nThe Chiefs rallied downfield in the final minute of regulation, Mahomes converting a fourth down with an audacious throw to Tyreek Hill before finding Damien Williams for the tying touchdown. Harrison Butker added the winning field goal in overtime in a crucial December matchup.\n\n\u201cOf course we\u2019ll watch last year\u2019s game,\u201d Ravens coach John Harbaugh said, \u201cbut teams change so much, and they watch the game, too. So it\u2019s always a new game. \u2026 You try to predict something and all of a sudden it gets blown up in your face. That, to me, is the beauty of this league.\u201d\n\nAs two of the AFC\u2019s top teams prepare to meet at Arrowhead Stadium, here are things to know:\n\nINJURY INTRIGUE\n\nThe Chiefs, already missing Hill to a broken collarbone, are without left tackle Eric Fisher after he underwent core muscle surgery earlier this week. They also could play without Williams (knee) and fellow running back LeSean McCoy (ankle), who have been hobbled by injuries.\n\nYet nobody on the Kansas City sideline sounds too concerned.\n\n\u201cWe have depth everywhere,\u201d Mahomes said. \u201cWe have guys that can come in and do the job.\u201d\n\nAWESOME ANDREWS\n\nRavens tight end Mark Andrews leads the team with 16 catches, has a pair of 100-yard games, has scored twice and has a knack for making a big play on third down.\n\n\u201cHe knows how to get open,\u201d Harbaugh said. \u201cMark has really showed up the last two weeks.\u201d\n\nThere are times when Andrews will even alter the pattern to get open. If there was a lamppost and a car on the field, Andrews would find the seam between them - \u201cI tell Mark all the time, \u2018We\u2019re going to play street ball,\u2019 and that\u2019s what the case is,\u201d Jackson said.\n\nPUNCH LINE\n\nPunter Dustin Colquitt is accustomed to the old-man jokes as the 37-year-old elder-statesman in the locker room, and he\u2019s heard plenty of jokes about never having to work given the way Kansas City has piled up points the past couple seasons.\n\nIn fact, Colquitt didn\u2019t get to punt at all during a Week 1 win over the Jaguars, though the two-time Pro Bowl selection held for plenty of field goals and extra points.\n\nYou might think that would make for an easy life, but Colquitt said it\u2019s the total opposite.\n\n\u201cAny time you\u2019re not working so much, every kick, snap, hold is more under the microscope,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt\u2019s fun watching that offense, but you can\u2019t get too caught up in it.\u201d\n\nHOME AGAIN\n\nAfter starting his NFL career with Baltimore, outside linebacker Pernell McPhee played 60 games over four seasons with the Ravens before spending three years in Chicago and another with the Redskins.\n\nNow he\u2019s back where he started after signing as a free agent in May.\n\n\u201cIt feels great. I\u2019m back home in Baltimore,\u201d said McPhee, who won a Super Bowl ring with the Ravens in 2012, and who has five tackles the first two games this season. \u201cThis is the team that raised me. I\u2019m trying to get back to the playoffs and win it all, that\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nFRIENDLY FOE\n\nOne week after Reid matched wits with good buddy Jon Gruden in Oakland, he must do the same with Harbaugh, who learned the craft while coaching under him in Philadelphia. The two have remained close friends during their years apart, and Reid was giddy when Harbaugh won a Super Bowl title.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a phenomenal coach,\u201d Reid said. \u201cI love playing against him because I know they\u2019re well-coached and they have good players. We do this for the challenge, that experience on Sundays. I always look forward to playing those guys.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Patrick Mahomes and the high-flying Kansas City Chiefs have been the talk of the NFL for months, their innovation and points-a-plenty style making them one of the league's most entertaining offenses.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Dave Skretta"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/15/chiefs_raiders_football_27936_c0-125-3000-1874_s1770x1032.jpg?f52fad753beb582a85b1710fc9f6c2ec1ddbd99f", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
