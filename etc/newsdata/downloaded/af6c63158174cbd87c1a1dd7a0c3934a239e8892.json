Doing His Job", "language": "en", "text": "Eric Trump had an embarrassing \u201cgotcha\u201d moment Friday after he gleefully preened about catching a Pulitzer Prize-winning Washington Post journalist who was just doing his job.\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s second son had intercepted a message sent by reporter David Fahrenthold apparently seeking off-the-record information from a Trump Organization staffer.\n\n\u201cThese are the tactics used by the Washington Post. Jeff Bezos \u2014 you should be very proud,\u201d Trump tweeted disdainfully.\n\nThese are the tactics used by the @WashingtonPost. @JeffBezos - you should be very proud... \ud83d\ude44 pic.twitter.com/9RO91n7XGX \u2014 Eric Trump (@EricTrump) September 6, 2019\n\nThat\u2019s pretty much the way information is often gathered, Eric, journalists and Twitter critics schooled him. Reporters try to get sources who can provide ... information, they noted.\n\nFahrenthold himself explained his strategy for gathering news in a Washington Post tweet after Trump\u2019s jab. \u201cThis a kind of an email I send all the time,\u201d said Fahrenthold, who covers the Trump Organization. \u201cA lot of journalism is finding people who know something you want to know \u2026 [and] reaching out.\u201d\n\nPost reporter David A. @Fahrenthold talks about his reporting on the Trump Organization.\n\n\n\nHis stories are here: https://t.co/cQK6CTe03j pic.twitter.com/XcPXoFe890 \u2014 The Washington Post (@washingtonpost) September 6, 2019\n\nOthers were only too happy to set Trump straight \u2014 or mock him.\n\nUmmm, Eric. This is called journalism.\n\n\n\nSpeaking to sources on background and anonymously sourcing documents to expose corruption is par for the course.\n\n\n\nI think you should learn how to use this other neat thing called Google before you tweet. https://t.co/FMICgPGs5v \u2014 Ahmed Baba (@AhmedBaba_) September 6, 2019\n\nThose bastards send polite emails reaching out to potential sources. How dare they? https://t.co/INicW2SNbE \u2014 Matthew Yglesias (@mattyglesias) September 6, 2019\n\nCongratulations. You\u2019ve just illustrated the difference between real news and fake news:\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Real news solicits for sources.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Fake news doesn\u2019t need sources.\n\n\n\nBetter stick to stealing money from pediatric cancer charities. \u2014 J. Dice \ud83c\udfb2 (@jdice03) September 6, 2019\n\nAnd\u2014even worse\u2014he takes what sources tell him, checks it against other sources, and reports what checks out! In a story!! To the public!!! Using a keyboard!!!! \u2014 John Hausman (@JohnSHausman) September 6, 2019\n\nYou really nailed him here Eric\u2026. A reporter asking for information! https://t.co/kmmSUameDc \u2014 Sam Stein (@samstein) September 6, 2019\n\nyeah, it's called Pulitzer Prize winning journalism \u2014 Sandi Bachom (@sandibachom) September 7, 2019\n\nYes Eric.\n\n\n\nDeveloping sources and obtaining background material is called \"investigative journalism\".\n\n\n\nIt's diametrically opposed to @seanhannity @TuckerCarlson and @JudgeJeanine, who rely on strawmen and lies.\n\n\n\nJournalism vs #FakeNews\n\n\n\nGlad I could help clear this up for you. \u2014 Mike Marler (@MikeDMarler) September 7, 2019\n\nWow. An extremely respectful and professional email. https://t.co/VCTt6odwus \u2014 Matt Fuller (@MEPFuller) September 6, 2019\n\nLol is this supposed to make Fahrenthold look bad? He looks like a total pro here https://t.co/nsOOGAqvxe \u2014 Lachlan Markay (@lachlan) September 6, 2019\n\nAnyway, if anyone wants to leave a tip about the Trump Org for the Washington Post, Eric was kind enough to broadcast to the entire internet exactly how to do so. \u2014 Brian Tyler Cohen (@briantylercohen) September 6, 2019\n\nIn which @erictrump inadvertently helps @Fahrenthold recruit new sources. \u2014 Jack Shafer (@jackshafer) September 6, 2019\n\nquite nice of Eric Trump to show young journalists everywhere a model template for reaching out to sources https://t.co/VguBQ4Spkq \u2014 Steadman\u2122 (@AsteadWesley) September 6, 2019\n\nFor Eric\u2019s sake, let\u2019s say that he\u2019s upset by @Fahrenthold\u2019s use of \u201can\u201d when he meant \u201ca\u201d before the line about sending documents via snail mail. https://t.co/tmgSHaOrf4 \u2014 Parker Molloy (@ParkerMolloy) September 6, 2019\n\nDammit. \u2014 David Fahrenthold (@Fahrenthold) September 6, 2019", "description": "David Fahrenthold was, like, trying to get sources, Eric, Twitter critics school him.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d73244723000023025126a1.jpeg?cache=b9rcndohrs&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
