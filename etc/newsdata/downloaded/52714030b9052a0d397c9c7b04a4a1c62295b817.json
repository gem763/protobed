The company announced earlier this year that it was planning to roll out PowerToys for Windows 10, and the first two are actually pretty useful additions to your everyday life.\n\nIf you want to follow along this brief guide to Windows 10's PowerToys, installing PowerToys on your system is easy. Go download the .MSI installer from Github, which includes both utilities, and run it. Once you\u2019ve put PowerToys on your system and launched the application, a new icon will materialise on your taskbar. (It\u2019s the one that looks like an RGB gradient with six dots underneath, second from the left in my screenshot.)\n\nScreenshot: David Murphy\n\nRight-click on the icon and select \u201cSettings\u201d to get started configuring the two PowerToys utilities. The first, FancyZones, allows you to set up transparent sections on your system\u2019s screen that you can use to plot windows in a set formation (at a set size).\n\nTo set up a layout for how you might want to lay out your various windows, click on the FancyZones menu in PowerToys\u2019 settings and select \u201cEdit zones.\u201d Once you\u2019ve created your own custom layout (or gone with a standard template), you simply need to press the Shift key before you start dragging a window around your screen. Up will pop your translucent \u201czones,\u201d and dragging-and-dropping a window over them plunks it into whatever you previously designed. (You can even move windows between zones with your keyboard if you also enable the \u201cOverride Windows Snap hotkeys\u201d option.)\n\nThe second PowerToys utility, Shortcut Guide, is incredibly easy to activate\u2014and incredibly helpful. It\u2019s enabled by default when you install and run PowerToys (which you can set to \u201cStart at login\u201d via its General settings, a tweak I recommend doing). Now, when you hold down the Windows Key for a few seconds, a handy pop-up menu will take over your screen and tell you about any and all keyboard commands you can use to interact with Windows. (The listed keys are what you would press in addition to the Windows key.)\n\nScreenshot: David Murphy\n\nYou can always turn off the shortcut guide if you don\u2019t like it via PowerToys\u2019 general settings. In the specific settings for Shortcut Guide, you can also adjust how long you need to hold down the Windows Key to have the guide pop up\u2014as well as its opacity.", "description": "The phrase \u201cPowerToys\u201d probably doesn\u2019t send you running to your Windows computer, but just because Microsoft\u2019s little suite of quirky utilities isn\u2019t sexy doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s not worth slapping on your system.
