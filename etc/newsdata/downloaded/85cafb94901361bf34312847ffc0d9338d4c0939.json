Spikes in oil prices have been associated with almost every recession over the past half century, and, until now, low fuel costs have been one of the U.S. economy\u2019s saving graces.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nWeekend attacks on key oil facilities in Saudi Arabia \u2014 and President Donald Trump\u2019s bellicose tweets casting blame on Iran \u2014 sent oil prices soaring Monday. The drone attacks initially pushed oil prices up nearly 20 percent, the biggest intra-day gain since the first Persian Gulf War in 1991. The sharp spike eased amid reports that the Saudis, for now, could make up much of the reduced production through reserves. Trump also suggested the U.S. could also tap its own oil stockpile if necessary.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s Twitter comments directing blame for the strikes \u2014 initially claimed by Yemeni rebels \u2014 toward Iran and his suggestion that the U.S. is \u201clocked and loaded\u201d for battle kept markets on edge. Brent crude futures, the global benchmark, remained up about 10 percent at $66 per barrel in midday trading.\n\n\u201cHigher oil prices may be just one more nail in the coffin for this current U.S. expansion,\u201d said Beth Ann Bovino, U.S. chief economist at S&P Global Ratings. \u201cAs it is, we are already seeing businesses being reluctant to invest given the trade headwinds and this gives them more reason to hold off.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we see a rise in gas prices as result of this, which have already been creeping higher, we may see the American consumer, which has been a stalwart for this expansion and a stabilizing force for the economy overall, slow spending as well, since more money in the gas pump means less to spend for items at the mall,\u201d she said.\n\nMorning Money Political intelligence on Washington and Wall Street \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

The deeper concern among economists and market analysts is that a full-scale shooting war with Iran could lead to much more disruption in the energy market and drive up fuel prices in the U.S., adding to inflation that is already picking up.\n\nThat could complicate decision-making at the Federal Reserve, which is now cutting rates to offset the impact of Trump\u2019s trade wars and signals of an economic slowdown. Cutting rates would be much harder if inflation rises further.\n\n\u201cI increasingly think we\u2019re watching a repeat of \u2018That 70s Show,\u2019\u201d said Richard Bernstein, founder of investment firm RBAdvisors. \u201cOil issue with the Middle East, UAW strike at GM, wage pressures, core CPI rising \u2014 and regardless of all that the Fed is in easing mode.\u201d\n\nA fresh war in the Middle East coupled with the impact of Trump\u2019s trade war with China and the uncertain fate of the replacement to NAFTA could all combine to further depress an American economy that grew just 2 percent in the second quarter and may grow closer to 1 percent the rest of the year, according to economists\u2019 forecasts.\n\n\u201cWhile the initial shock of a brief oil supply reduction will be quickly absorbed by U.S. production capabilities, folks up and down the supply chain will use the attack to raise prices,\u201d said Dan Berger, president and CEO of the National Association of Federally-Insured Credit Unions. \u201cIt will be immediately seen by consumers at the retailers\u2019 pumps and those prices will likely stay higher for a considerable amount of time, creating an additional headwind for the economy. Historically gas prices rocket up and then very slowly come down.\u201d\n\nAnalysts also cautioned that Trump could back off his threats toward Iran, especially given the potentially negative impact on the U.S. economy, just as he heads toward his reelection campaign next year. Trump has rattled the saber against other American adversaries only to reverse course in subsequent weeks and months, particularly since he campaigned on promises to extract the U.S. from protracted wars in the Middle East.\n\nIf tensions do ease with Iran, the attacks on the two Saudi oil fields should not have a major impact on the U.S.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re amazed that most Americans don\u2019t realize that the U.S. is energy self-sufficient; it\u2019s one of the least appreciated economic stories of the decade,\u201d said Greg Valliere, chief global strategist at AGF Investments, in a note to clients Monday. \u201cThe U.S. can withstand a protracted period of global energy shortages, with a minimal economic impact. The big loser could be China, which is heavily dependent on oil imports.\u201d\n\nWall Street reacted fairly calmly to the attacks, with the Dow down less than 1 percent in midday trading. Investment strategists said reaction would likely stay limited unless the crisis spirals out of control.\n\n\u201cThe concern is \u2018escalation.\u2019 That is, if it evolves into a broader military conflict which persists, that would be concerning,\u201d said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group. \u201cHowever, that is probably very unlikely. Other countries can increase output to make up for a short-run shortfall from Saudi until their capacity is brought back on line.\u201d", "description": "While the weekend attacks on Saudi Arabia appear manageable for oil markets, traders and economists are on edge about an escalating conflict.", "authors": ["Ben White"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/a4/98/114b117f4e6487c354019dbaff0c/190916-middle-east-oil-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
