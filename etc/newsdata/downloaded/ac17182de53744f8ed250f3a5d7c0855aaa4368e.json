She is then set to arrive in Moscow on Saturday.\n\nThe Siberian native, a former graduate student at American University in Washington, confessed to having conspired with a Russian official and two Americans to join the NRA.\n\nFrom there Butina had planned to open up unofficial lines of communication between Moscow and gun lobbyists, with the group holding significant sway with President Donald Trump.\n\nFederal prosecutors said Butina had not engaged in traditional spycraft, instead interacting with Republican circles to gain favour and promote better relations between Washington and Russia.\n\nThe charge stemmed from Butina's link to Alexander Torshin, a deputy governor of Russia's central bank who later became the subject of sanctions from the US Treasury Department. Washington alleged she had been directed by Mr Torshin.\n\nOne of the two Americans meanwhile was activist and republican campaigner Paul Erickson, Butina\u2019s boyfriend who was not charged for his links to Butina.\n\nThe Russian also arranged dinners and attended events with prominent politicians during her time in the US \u2013 and in 2015 appeared at a Trump campaign event and asked him a question about whether he wanted better relations with her home country.\n\nMr Trump responded by telling Butina that he would \"get along very nicely with Putin.\"\n\nWhile it is unclear what reception Butina will receive upon her return to Moscow, Vladimir Putin has previously expressed his anger over the case while arguing her innocence.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an outrage\u201d he said in April \u201cIt\u2019s not clear what she was convicted of or what crime she committed. I think it\u2019s a prime example of saving face.\n\n\u201cThey arrested her and put the girl in jail. But there was nothing on her, so in order not to look totally stupid they gave her, fixed her up, with an 18-month sentence to show that she was guilty of something.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Reuters.\n\nRead more\n\nUS citizen charged with spying for China as part of espionage ring", "description": "Maria Butina, the Russian woman who admitted to being a spy seeking to infiltrate political groups like the National Rifle Association (NRA) and Moscow, is due to be released from prison ahead of her deportation.Butina, 31, was sentenced to 18 months in a prison earlier this year after pleading guilty", "authors": ["Vincent Wood"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/b2FOIDP32B3oH.h3O1C9Ng--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/70794e72e68b8ec5148c723433e79783", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
