That outbreak led to 500 people, nearly half of them police, being injured and around 200 arrests.\n\nHundreds of mostly masked youths surrounded the National Police headquarters in downtown Barcelona and threw colorful plastic balls at the officers on guard. When they switched to raining down rocks and bottles, national police with backup from Catalonia\u2019s regional police force charged with batons swinging and fired foam bullets. After a chaotic moment they managed to extend a perimeter while protesters set fire to trash cans in the middle of the streets.\n\nRegional emergency services said 15 people were being treated for injuries as a result of the clashes, including an AP photographer who was hit in the face with a police baton. Catalonia\u2019s regional police said one of its officers was serious hurt. At least one person had to be put on a stretcher by medics and taken away in an ambulance.\n\nUnlike the worst of the last week\u2019s riots that lasted hours, order was restored relatively quickly.\n\nEarlier on Saturday Barcelona\u2019s police said 350,000 people rallied peacefully in the regional capital, many waving pro-independence flags for Catalonia. The rally was organized by the main pro-secession grassroots groups who want to create a new state in the northeastern corner of Spain. There were no repeated incidents in the rally that drew families from across the wealthy region.\n\n\u201cWe cannot accept that (the prisoners) have been condemned to terms of nine to 13 years for defending the self-determination of Catalans,\u201d the president of the pro-secession grassroots group ANC, Elisenda Paluzie, said at the peaceful protest.\n\nNine Catalan officials were given sentences of nine to 13 years for sedition by the Supreme Court. Four of those were also convicted of misuse of public funds. The other three were fined for disobedience. They were all acquitted of the more serious crime of rebellion, which carries sentences of up to 25 years. Spain\u2019s most right-wing politicians called the verdict soft.\n\nSpain\u2019s government has told Catalonia\u2019s separatists that the national Parliament would need to amend the Constitution, which considers the nation indivisible, to make secession by a region legal.\n\nThe largest pro-Spanish union grassroots group Catalan Civil Society has called for a rally in Barcelona on Sunday. About roughly one half of Catalonia\u2019s 7.5 residents oppose severing century-old ties with the rest of the country.\n\nThe Catalan crisis is set to be a key issue in Spain\u2019s Nov. 10 national election, where Socialist Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez will try to stay in power.\n\nAlso on Saturday, Spain\u2019s far-right party Vox drew several thousand people to a political rally in central Madrid. Vox is trying to profile itself as the best option to stop the rupture of Spain.", "description": "BARCELONA, Spain (AP) \u2014 Police and violent protesters in Spain's restive Catalonia region clashed Saturday after a massive rally in Barcelona against the", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/26/5c82a6_aptopix-spain-catalonia-49370-protester-wearing-an-estelada-or-catalan-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
