Probably a few, since we\u2019re dealing with a sequel here. According to The Hollywood Reporter, Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston will reportedly return as the fish-out-of-water New York couple wrongfully accused (and therefore tasked with solving) a murder whilst on their long-delayed honeymoon for an upcoming sequel to this year\u2019s Murder Mystery. It is currently in development.\n\nZodiac and Independence Day: Resurgence screenwriter James Vanderbilt is reportedly in negotiations to return and write the film. As for where the Spitzes will solve their next murder, they have to go Hawaii, right? Possibly the Bahamas? We\u2019d say the Hamptons, but that\u2019s clearly a Murder Mystery 3 move if we\u2019ve ever seen it.", "description": "Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston will reportedly star in the rumored sequel to their recent Netflix film, Murder Mystery.", "authors": ["Halle Kiefer"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/08/26/11-Murder-Mystery.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
