It would result in a 100-pound weight loss by February of the following year.\n\nStarting small\n\n\"I knew I didn't want to make drastic changes,\" she said. At the time, the majority of her diet was made up of fast food. She would go to Little Ceasers, she said, and eat a whole pizza herself.\n\n\"If there was a burger meal, I had to upgrade it,\" Elizondo said of her fast-food habits. She decided to cook at home more and limit her fast-food consumption to twice a week.\n\nShe started moving\n\nThe next month, she began walking around her neighborhood. The month after that, she started using the elliptical for 30 minutes every day.\n\nIn April, her walking turned to jogging. Eventually, she ran a 5K. Then a 10K. Today, she's has her sights set on a half marathon.\n\nShe cut back on socializing\n\n\"I had to put my health first,\" Elizondo told \"GMA.\" For her, that meant skipping meals out with family and friends. \"They know me and I knew if they saw me order a salad they would ask about it,\" she said. \"I just wanted to avoid that situation.\"\n\nThere was a time where Friday nights were spent jogging and drinking water, she said.\n\nToday, with 100 pounds gone, she's back to socializing regularly and spending time with her family and friends. \"They know I've worked so hard and understand where I'm coming from.\"\n\nShe used a meal-tracking app\n\nMy Fitness Pal, Elizondo said, not only helped her lose the weight, but now helps her maintain it.\n\n\"It's still my best friend,\" she said. Her favorite features are how the app gives calorie suggestions and allows users to upload photos so she can see her progress with every milestone reached.\n\n\"It took a lot of consistency and discipline,\" she said. \"Now I don't track as closely to the dot as I used to, but it helps me choose well during the day if I am going to be going out with friends that night.\"\n\nShe learned to love herself\n\nThe hardest part? \"Learning to love myself at every weight,\" Elizondo said.\n\n\"So many people say they will be happy when they reach a certain weight,\" she said. \"But you have to learn to love yourself at every stage.\n\n\"With every goal you accomplish, self-love helps you get to the next step.\"", "description": "Martha Elizondo lost 100 pounds in 13 months.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/transformation_190916_CA_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
