Shares rose 20% in late trading after dropping slightly during the day.\n\nPoletti: Tesla is profitable again. How long will it last this time?\n\nThat\u2019s a sign that, at Tesla, the hard part is mostly over.\n\nMore on Tesla: Arora: Musk awakens the bulls, but prudent investors should go slow\n\nThe electric-car maker came into this year with two huge challenges \u2014 one is basically done now, and the other appears to be on the way.\n\nTesla has capital\n\nThe first one seemed impossible to many pundits who were very, very sure they were right, but Tesla has substantially locked up the $10 billion that analysts had estimated as the high end of the amount of capital it would need to build out its suite of factories.\n\nThe company has already spent $1.5 billion to $2 billion of that, CFRA analyst Garrett Nelson estimated, and it raised $2.7 billion selling stock and bonds in May. It closed the third quarter with a record $5.3 billion of cash on the balance sheet.\n\nWith estimates of next year\u2019s free-cash flow running as high as the $1.7 billion projected by Joe Osha of JMP Securities \u2014 before the earnings report \u2014 Tesla is basically home free on the cash front.\n\nAnother view: Tesla bull praises \u2018Picasso-like\u2019 quarter, but others question whether profit can be sustained\n\nUnless, of course, something goes massively wrong in the company\u2019s operations over the next year \u2014 either demand growth cratering, which would likely require a recession, or gross profit margins somehow reversing their 400-basis-point third-quarter increase as Tesla nurtures its Model 3 line, opens a factory in China, and prepares to launch its Model Y crossover in 2020.\n\nSurprise on profit margins\n\nThe second part of Tesla\u2019s challenge has been to address the narrowing of its profit margins since it introduced the Model 3 sedan in 2017. The most stunning part of yesterday\u2019s announcement was that its gross margin on cars \u2014 the amount left over after production costs, but before marketing and corporate-overhead expenses \u2014 zoomed to 22.8% of sales from 18.9% in the second quarter. The day before the report, Osha had predicted 18.5%.\n\nThe target Wall Street has been hoping for was that Tesla would be able to get that number to 25% \u2014 over a couple of years. Now it looks like a nearly done deal: If Tesla were not company with a long history of overpromising and under-delivering, it would be all but taken for granted.\n\nThat leads us to the other point: The tasks ahead of Tesla are much easier than the Model 3 launch that just about broke Musk\u2019s reputation.\n\nThe other big surprise in the report by a company that has so publicly struggled to meet production targets on the Model 3, its first truly mass-market vehicle after the high-priced Model S sedan and Model X crossover that can easily run into six figures with options, is that its next two big projects are \u2014 wait for it \u2014 ahead of schedule.\n\nModel Y crossover\n\nTesla said its Model Y crossover \u2014 whose prices begin at $39,000, with a 300-mile range between battery charges -- will be ready next summer, moving up from next fall. And its big Shanghai factory, which will boost its production capacity to 590,000 vehicles, well more than the 360,000 or so it\u2019s expected to sell this year, is basically done and awaiting final approval from Chinese regulators. It also cost a third of what Tesla spent, per car, to set up its Model 3 production.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just my opinion, but I think it will outsell the 3, S and X combined,\u201d Musk said on Tesla\u2019s post-earnings conference call.\n\nThe Model Y launch should not be the headache that Model 3 was, and its market is significantly bigger. The crossover shares about 75% of its parts base with the Model 3, meaning that, simplified, Tesla already knows how to make them. (By the time it begins to make trucks, which may be harder, it won\u2019t be a company depending on a single model).\n\nIt\u2019s expanding its California plant to make Ys, but Musk also said yesterday that the Shanghai plant, touted as mostly making Model 3s to sell in China, will at some point also produce Ys. A site for a plant in Europe will be picked by the end of the year, he added.\n\nAnd Musk\u2019s boast about the Y is not outlandish. At Ford F, -6.98% , the Escape crossover sells more units than the mid-priced Fusion sedan and Ford\u2019s entire luxury Lincoln brand. Toyota\u2019s TM, +0.43% RAV4, with nearly 325,000 U.S. unit sales through September this year, is bigger than the top-selling Camry and all Lexus cars put together.\n\nShort version: People like small SUVs, so if the Model Y is as good as its hype, Tesla will sell a lot of them, especially in the U.S. It would help if the federal government weren\u2019t phasing out the $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicles, but at prices still not much above the U.S. average for new vehicles, the Model Y will likely find its market nonetheless.\n\nFrom there, it\u2019s on to pickup trucks and even commercial freight tractors. But that\u2019s for another day.\n\nYes, there will be some niggling about this report. Some have already pointed to the light revenue, a problem the Model Y should resolve with considerable prejudice.\n\nCFRA analyst Nelson points out that much more electric-car competition is coming in the next few years, led by General Motors GM, -1.91% and Volkswagen VW, +0.94% . The company is also still run by the very mercurial Musk, who I\u2019ve long argued needs more adult supervision from Tesla\u2019s compliant board, and was lucky not to be fired after he tweeted a bogus claim that Tesla would go private for $420 a share.\n\nKatsenelson: Why Tesla\u2019s future might not be in Elon Musk\u2019s hands\n\nInvestor relations\n\nFor one quarter, at least, Musk mastered Investor Relations 101 \u2014 Underpromise and Overdeliver, and not the opposite. Whether that will last is anyone\u2019s guess.\n\nBut what small investors need to know, for now, is that Tesla had two jobs coming into this year: finance its expansion plans, and improve its operations to boost profits.\n\nFor now the verdict is that they have licked one problem and have the other, finally, under what appears to be firm control.\n\nOsha told me Tuesday that if Tesla hit his 2020 cash-flow forecast \u2014 which is based on a sales gain of about 20%, and margins that are about what Tesla did in the quarter just completed \u2014 \u201cthe stock will go way up.\u201d\n\nHe was right \u2014 just early.", "description": "Tesla seems to have mastered one of its main challenges, and is well on its way to conquering the other.", "authors": ["Tim Mullaney"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GD500_tesla0_ZG_20180209175446.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
