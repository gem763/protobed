In September, the survey showed confidence in not loing a job falling to 69 percent, down from 77 percent a month earlier. This was the second straight monthly decline in this component of the index.\n\n\u201cConsumer sentiment remains relatively strong overall, though uncertainty about the economy and individual financial circumstances appear to be weighing on housing market attitudes a bit more than a month ago,\u201d said Fannie Mae chief economist Doug Duncan. \u201cJob confidence remains high but still well shy of its July reading.\u201d\n\nThe September reading is the lowest since the summer of 2018.\n\nThe overall index fell 2.3 points in September to 91.5, retreating from a survey high in August. The fall in job security and a decline in confidence that home prices would rise contributed to the overall drop. These were partially offset by increases in the \u201cGood Time to Buy\u201d and \u201cGood Time to Sell\u201d components.", "description": "While consumer confidence remains high, the share of Americans concerned about losing their job has climbed for two months. | Economy", "authors": ["John Carney"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/american-flag-waving-getty-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
