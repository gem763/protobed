But again, they\u2019re not doing a very good job at hiding who it will be.\n\nInterim coach Bill Callahan said Wednesday the team was still deciding who will start Sunday\u2019s game against the Miami Dolphins. But the coach\u2019s remarks came hours after a report indicated Case Keenum is expected to be named starter, as long as his foot injury doesn\u2019t prevent him from doing so.\n\nKeenum, who suffered the injury in a Week 3 loss to the Bears and then missed two practices over the following weeks, was a full participant in Callahan\u2019s first practice.\n\n\u201cWe distributed the reps pretty well,\u201d Callahan said. \u201cI think they all got exposure at different points in the practice with the first group. So, that was a real positive. Everybody got work, and when you get that, they all benefit.\u201d\n\nCallahan said he liked the format Washington implemented, noting all three quarterbacks got close to equal reps when factoring in work with the first team and the scout team.\n\nIf the Redskins turn back to Keenum in Miami, that means Colt McCoy will have been benched after just one start. McCoy struggled in last week\u2019s loss to the New England Patriots, getting sacked six times and throwing for only 119 yards.\n\nFormer coach Jay Gruden named McCoy the starter on Friday, citing the quarterback\u2019s experience in his system. McCoy was on track to win the team\u2019s starting job in training camp before aggravating a leg injury that sidelined him for eight weeks.\n\nBut now, the Redskins appear ready to turn back to Keenum.\n\nAfter a strong start to the season, the 31-year-old struggled in losses to the Chicago Bears and the New York Giants. He turned the ball over a combined six times, throwing four interceptions and losing two fumbles. Gruden benched Keenum in Week 4 for rookie Dwayne Haskins and Keenum was inactive the following week.\n\nThe NFL Network first reported the Redskins\u2019 decision to lean toward Keenum, citing multiple sources.\n\nBeyond the report, Keenum was lined up among the team\u2019s captains when stretching for practice Wednesday. As part of a series of changes, Callahan made his captains be front and center to lead the stretch.\n\n\u201cI always think that\u2019s a positive when your leadership is up there on a daily basis, and players can emulate that they know who they are, we can potentially draw more from them,\u201d Callahan said. As for his foot injury, Keenum said he\u2019s feeling better than he was in the previous two weeks. He added he\u2019ll wait to see how it responds after practice.\n\nAsked about Gruden\u2019s firing, Keenum said football is a \u201ctough business.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of hard days,\u201d Keenum said. \u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of hard days more than I have had great days. But that\u2019s what makes those great days really, really great. I think we have some great days ahead of us.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
