They're expected to expand their list of witnesses in the coming week.\n\nThe formal start of the inquiry came after Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee grilled former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski on Capitol Hill two weeks ago, producing several soundbites but few tangible results.", "description": "Following House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's announcement of a formal impeachment inquiry into President Trump, Wall Street Journal columnist Kim Strassel accused her of \"ducking\" her actual responsibilities with regard to the probe and said she has not followed proper protocol.", "authors": ["Nick Givas", "Nick Givas Is A Reporter With Fox News.
