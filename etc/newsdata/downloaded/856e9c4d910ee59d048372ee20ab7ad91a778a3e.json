New study says strangers step in to help 90 percent of the time", "language": "en", "text": "Most of us are familiar with \u201cbystander apathy\u201d: the chilling idea that large groups of people can watch horrific crimes without feeling compelled to step in and help.\n\nThe idea first gained traction after the 1964 killing of Kitty Genovese, a 28-year-old New Yorker who, it was believed at the time, was killed as 38 people looked on. While the number of eye witnesses was later found to be untrue, the story has become a cautionary tale to explain high-profile tragedies and the decaying of society.\n\nBut new research suggests we should take a rosier view of human nature.\n\nBystanders will intervene 9 times out of 10 to assist the victim in a public fight, an international team of researchers found in a study called \u201cWould I be helped?,\" published in American Psychologist this summer. After reviewing surveillance footage of more than 200 violent altercations around the world, the researchers concluded that having more bystanders around makes it more likely that someone will intervene.\n\n\u201cOur study suggests that if assaulted in public you will most likely be helped by a bystander,\u201d said Richard Philpot, a psychology research fellow at Lancaster University and the study\u2019s lead author. \u201cThis is reassuring for potential victims of violence, the public as a whole, and \u2026 has important implications for our understanding of bystanders as a crime-preventive resource.\u201d\n\n[A sick child couldn\u2019t leave his house. So strangers came to his window by the dozens to entertain him.]\n\nPhilpot and his team examined 219 CCTV videos of assaults or arguments in three major cities: Amsterdam; Cape Town, South Africa; and Lancaster in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe researchers selected their videos based on a few criteria: The filmed encounter had to be \u201caggressive,\u201d involving behavior ranging from \u201canimated disagreements to grave physical violence,\u201d according to the study. It had to involve at least two main participants, and it had to develop organically \u2014 the team discounted videos of traffic accidents, robberies and drug deals. Finally, it had to begin without police or paramedics present.\n\nPhilpot\u2019s team watched every altercation until it dissipated naturally or until police arrived to break it up. The team then recorded whether bystanders \u2014 whom they defined as anyone not involved in the original argument \u2014 did anything to \u201cplacate the conflict,\u201d according to the study.\n\nThe researchers counted any of the following activities as placation, per the report: \u201cpacifying gesturing,\u201d \u201ccalming touches,\u201d \u201cblocking contact\u201d between the people arguing, \u201cholding, pushing or pulling an aggressor away,\u201d \u201cconsoling a victim\u201d or \u201cproviding practical help\u201d to anyone who suffered physical injuries.\n\nAfter watching all the videos and crunching all the numbers, Philpot and his team found that at least one bystander decided to help out in 91 percent of the cases studied. On average, at least three people chose to intervene \u2014 and every additional bystander present increased the odds that the victim would receive assistance by roughly 10 percent.\n\n\u201cThe high level of help was surprising,\u201d Philpot said. He said the findings \u201coverturn the impression of the \u2018walk on by society\u2019 in which victims are largely ignored by bystanders.\u201d\n\n[This woman took 97 rescue dogs into her Bahamas home to protect them from Hurricane Dorian]\n\nThe researchers also found that there was no statistically significant difference in the rates of bystander intervention across the three cities studied. Philpot said this suggests that \u201cpeople have a natural propensity to help others in distress,\u201d no matter their nationality.\n\nPhilpot was inspired to conduct the study after noticing that many of his peers in the social sciences, as well as members of the media, took for granted the idea that bystanders are generally indifferent to the plight of others. He also noticed that most previous research into bystander intervention relied on laboratory experiments or self-reported accounts of violent incidents, both of which can be \u201cunreliable\u201d and sometimes \u201cstrip out complexity,\u201d he said.\n\nIn contrast to past work, Philpot wanted to scrutinize \u201cactual bystander behavior in real-life public emergencies\u201d \u2014 something only possible to assess via security-camera footage. His research represents the largest study of real-life arguments captured on CCTV, he said.\n\n[Neighbors thought they witnessed a tragedy. Then a sign appeared: \u2018You Saved My Life!\u2019]\n\nWhile his findings challenge the notion of bystander apathy, Philpot emphasized, he and his team did not test the equally well-known \u201cbystander effect\u201d: a psychological claim that the greater the number of bystanders at the scene of a crime, the less likely each individual is to help (perhaps because they assume someone else will do so).\n\nThat may still hold true, Philpot said. His team did not explore individual bystanders\u2019 motivations. Instead, the researchers focused on the \u201csituational likelihood of intervention,\u201d Philpot said, whether at least one person in a large group will step in to intervene in a conflict.\n\nAll of the cases Philpot and his team studied played out in urban, inner-city environments. He said future work should explore whether bystander intervention rates vary in different contexts \u2014 for example, in rural areas.\n\nIn the meantime, though, he hopes his study will accomplish a \u201creframing\u201d of the way society thinks about bystanders.\n\n\u201c[It] offers an alternative narrative to \u2026 \u2018stranger danger,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cBystanders should be recognized as \u2018first responders\u2019 who can provide informal help before the arrival of the police.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nA boy held his crying classmate\u2019s hand on the first day of school.
