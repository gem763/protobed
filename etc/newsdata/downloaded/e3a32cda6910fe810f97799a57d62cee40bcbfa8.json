Photo: Getty Images\n\nHonoring the creatives who have recently died is one of the most important jobs an awards show has to do. Yes, right up there with making sure the correct envelope goes out, basic respect for the dead should be done properly. Yet somehow \u2026 year after year \u2026 awards show after awards show \u2026 there\u2019s an \u201cIn Memoriam\u201d mishap. At the 2019 Emmy Awards Sunday night, renowned composer Andr\u00e9 Previn, who died earlier this year, was honored in the slideshow. Except the man they showed onscreen was not Andr\u00e9 Previn. It was Leonard Slatkin, another composer, who per his last tweet, is very much alive.\n\n\u201cI saw that @theemmys posted a photo of me \u2018In Memoriam\u2019 rather than the intended Andre Previn,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cAndre deserved better. I had the opportunity to introduce him when he received the @KCHonors. Perhaps he was paying me back for a couple stories I told about him.\u201d Handling it much more gracefully than he should, Slatkin simply did the appropriate thing: show respect for Previn and his legacy. Is that so hard, Emmys? The awards show is certainly not the first offender. In 2017, the Oscars used a photo of nominee Jan Chapman for the late costume designer Janet Patterson. But at least that one wasn\u2019t set to a Halsey cover of \u201cTime After Time.\u201d\n\nI saw that @theemmys posted a photo of me \"In Memoriam\" rather than the intended Andre Previn.
