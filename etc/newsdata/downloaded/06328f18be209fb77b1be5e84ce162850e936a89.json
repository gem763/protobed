After all, the U.S.-China trade war and issues related to Brexit have taken a toll on the global economy, and would likely continue to do so if not resolved timely.\n\nIn such a scenario, mutual fund investors should look toward safer havens such as the consumer staples, utilities and healthcare sectors.\n\nIMF Slashes its Global Growth Projection\n\nPer its latest World Economic Outlook published earlier in October, the IMF lowered its projections for 2019 GDP growth from 3.2% in July to 3% in October. Global trade uncertainty was cited as the primary hindrance to global economic growth and hence the lower projection.\n\nIn fact, the report also sheds light on the fact that the ongoing trade war between the United States and China have led to direct costs, market volatility, lower investment and diminished productivity on the back of disruptions in the supply chain.\n\nFurthermore, geopolitical tensions related to Brexit could potentially lower economic activity and disturb a possible moderate recovery in emerging markets and the eurozone.\n\nIs a Trade Deal Likely in the Near Term?\n\nOn Oct 21, President Donald Trump expressed his optimism over a possible U.S.-China trade deal, saying that a deal with the Asian country was \u201ccoming along very well.\u201d Trump said China wanted to make a deal because the country\u2019s \u201csupply chain is going down the tubes.\u201d\n\nChina\u2019s GDP grew at an annualized rate of 6% in third-quarter 2019, which was its weakest in almost three decades. A worsened scenario for jobs and wages, and reduced business activities contributed toward China\u2019s dull economic growth.\n\nComing back to the much-anticipated U.S.-China trade deal, Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said that the first phase of the deal is expected to be finalized by the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meetings in Chile on Nov 16 and 17. However, he also mentioned that there were still outstanding issues that needed to be taken care of.\n\nWhy Invest in Defensive Sectors?\n\nInvesting in defensive sectors is an ideal way to wait out periods of economic uncertainty. This is because the defensive sectors offer products and services that rarely witness a slowdown in consumer demand during an economic slowdown or financial market turmoil.\n\nTherefore, purchasing mutual funds from the space seems prudent. The question here is why should investors consider mutual funds? Reduced transaction costs and diversification of portfolio without several commission charges that are associated with stock purchases are primarily why one should be parking money in mutual funds (read more: Mutual Funds: Advantages, Disadvantages, and How They Make Investors Money).\n\nOur Choices\n\nWe have, therefore, selected four defensive mutual funds.
