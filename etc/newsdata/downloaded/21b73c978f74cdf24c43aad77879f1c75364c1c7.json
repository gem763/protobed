Once he finds her he discovers she is living a life that forces him to question his own beliefs.\n\n\u201cI wanted to show a male character whose experiences unshackle his own patriarchal ideas,\u201d said Chatterjee.\n\n\u201cIt is still a story about a strong woman and the choices she makes but I wanted to show how these can be accepted when often they are just not. It\u2019s a feminist film but it doesn\u2019t have a female protagonist. I didn\u2019t want to show a troubled woman so much as to trouble a man.\u201d\n\n\u2013 English, Hindi, Italian \u2013\n\nChatterjee wrote the screenplay after a chance meeting -\u2013 and then dinner -\u2013 with an old couple during a trip to Venice and said she has \u201calways been a story-teller at heart\u201d even though up until now she\u2019s been best known for her work in front of the camera.\n\nIn 2011 she joined Bollywood royalty by picking up a prestigious National Film Award in India for her role in the drama \u201cDekh Indian Circus\u201d.\n\n\u201cI like to use my imagination,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it was not easy to get support for the film because it doesn\u2019t fit into any slot.\u201d\n\n\u201cRoam Rome Mein\u201d features the work of one of the rising stars of Bollywood cinematography in Sunita Radia but the director revealed the intention was to make a film that looked \u201cfor all the world just like a Bollywood film but is not actually a Bollywood film.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt goes into reality and surrealism and it\u2019s in English, Hindi and Italian,\u201d said Chatterjee. \u201cSo it\u2019s not really like anything any studio in India has seen. I wanted it to have that bright bold look but to have a story-telling style that was very different.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s been a buzz building about the film over BIFF\u2019s opening weekend, with Chatterjee already picking up the festival\u2019s Asian Star Award for her work.\n\nAnother Indian production generating interest is the Alankrita Shrivastava-directed \u201cDolly Kitty and Those Twinkling Stars\u201d, also centred around a woman determined to break free from the country\u2019s conservative societal norms.\n\nChatterjee said both films showed women in her homeland increasingly wanted to use their positions to expand India\u2019s \u201ccinematic language.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe lives of women across society are still repressed,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are not really yet getting access to those stories. The more women writers and directors that we have, with a world view that is different, then you will see the industry and the world shift. We are at the beginning of that right now.\u201d", "description": "Busan (South Korea) (AFP) \u2013 Acclaimed actress Tannishtha Chatterjee\u00a0believes Bollywood is undergoing a subtle shift at Asia\u2019s biggest film", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/06/945bff_tannishtha-chatterjee-believes-bollywood-is-undergoing-subtle-shift-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
