Parents want pairs that will be durable and long-lasting, but also fun enough that kids will actually want to wear them. To find kid-friendly underwear that actually lasts, we asked eight cool people \u2014 including models, writers, bloggers, and children\u2019s fashion editors, many of whom are parents \u2014 to tell us about their favorite styles. Read on for all their picks, from Disney-princess patterned panties and striped briefs to solid-colored and gender-neutral options. Generally, the pairs shown come in sizes that will fit kids between 2 and 10 years old; if any pairs do not fall within that range, we\u2019ve noted that.\n\nBest printed underwear for kids\n\nLinda McLean, a children\u2019s fashion editor at Family Traveller magazine and the founder of the website Smudgetikka, told us she likes the kids\u2019 underwear options from the British brand Boden. \u201cTheir value packs of underwear for boys and girls always have cool prints and of-the-moment color combinations,\u201d she says, adding that the underwear is well made. The above set for girls combines striped styles with Liberty of London\u2013esque floral prints, while the set shown for boys includes briefs with monster motifs (both Boden will fit kids up to age 8).\n\nWith its classic French styling and understated charm, McLean calls Petit Bateau the \u201ccr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of underwear for kids.\u201d The brand is also a favorite of mom of two Ariane Goldman, the founder of Hatch. \u201cI\u2019m a Francophile, so when I can get a little piece of Parisian design on my girls, I do,\u201d says Goldman. The above sets will fit toddlers ages 2 and 3.\n\nMcLean also recommends Gap Kids for simple, affordable underwear. These seven packs are a price performer, with each pair breaking down to roughly $4 (or less) a pair. Plus, each one is printed with a different day of the week, making morning getting-ready routines that much easier.\n\nBobo Choses Organic Cotton Briefs, Set of 3 $51 at Smallable Buy\n\nBobo Choses Organic Cotton Boxers, Set of 3 $51 at Smallable Buy\n\n\u201cI always opt for organic fabrications for my daughters underwear,\u201d says Lia-Belle King, creative director and co-founder of sustainable design store Worn. That\u2019s why she is \u201csuch a fan\u201d of Bobo Choses. Not only are the brand\u2019s briefs cut from organic cotton, but they are also \u201cincredibly well made \u2014 they don\u2019t stretch out, and the colors and prints are always so good across their entire range,\u201d King tells us. Plus, they feature interesting prints that are a bit unexpected (and dare we say sophisticated) for kids\u2019 underwear.\n\nBest solid underwear for kids\n\nFor basic kids\u2019 underwear in a rainbow of solid shades, Goldman and Cup of Jo founder Joanna Goddard turn to Primary, whose founders worked at companies like Baby Einstein and Diapers.com before setting out to create a line of logo-free kids\u2019 wardrobe basics. \u201cWhat they stand for and the simple selection makes things easier and logical,\u201d according to Goldman. \u201cAfter years of buying superhero underwear and secretly cringing, I fell in love with Primary underwear,\u201d adds Goddard. \u201cIt is soft, comfy, affordable, and comes in a bunch of solid colors. Done and done.\u201d\n\nAs editor of Earnshaw\u2019s, a magazine about the children\u2019s fashion industry, Emily Beckman sees a lot of kids\u2019 underwear. She told us these sweet, made-in-the-USA bottoms are her top pick of the moment. \u201cEsme underwear for children is extremely soft, comfortable and lightweight,\u201d she explains. \u201cGirls\u2019 styles are made with finishing touches of lace and rosette for a cute, age-appropriate look.\u201d Their boxer briefs for boys are also age-appropriate; in addition to the solid-colored pairs above, you can also get Esme boys\u2019 briefs with adorable prints, like monkeys or movie snacks.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a budget-friendly option for your kids\u2019 underwear drawers, Brianne Manz, blogger at Stroller in the City, says, \u201cHanes makes great ones.\u201d Their multipacks of cotton briefs come with six and seven days\u2019 worth of underwear for less than the price you\u2019d pay for lunch. While the boys\u2019 set is all solids, the girls\u2019 set includes three printed pairs along with its solid-colored styles. But if you\u2019re just seeking solids, Hanes sells its girls\u2019 underwear in a solid-color-only three-pack.\n\nAnother affordable option is Fruit of the Loom, which LaTonya Yvette, stylist and author of Woman of Color, admits isn\u2019t \u201cparticularly cool\u201d but is \u201csturdy and has an amazing life span.\u201d The all-white briefs will fit girls ages 4 to 14, while the rainbow set will fit toddlers up to age 5.\n\nBest cartoon or movie-branded underwear for kids\n\nFor kids who demand Disney princesses or superhero shields on their underwear, Manz likes H&M\u2019s branded sets. \u201cThey always have fun characters on them for the kiddies,\u201d she says. In addition to these Disney and Batman/Superman\u2013themed pairs, H&M also makes underwear with other popular characters including My Little Pony and Super Mario.\n\nBest gender-neutral underwear for kids\n\nJaycina Almond, model and founder of the Tender Foundation, loves ARQ underwear because \u201call the colors are complementary, so you can mix and match the tanks and undies for a cute lounge outfit.\u201d She adds that the colors are gender-neutral, making these easy to pass down, and notes that ARQ uses organic cotton and dye processes, is tag-free, and made in the USA. ARQ\u2019s undergarments will fit kids up to age 7.\n\nTiny Undies Underwear, 3-pack Almond also told us she \u201creally likes Tiny Undies, because the brand was founded by a mama that is an expert on potty training,\u201d adding that \u201cthe undies are very thoughtfully produced.\u201d The underwear are low-rise to accommodate babies\u2019 big bellies and tiny waists, and the solid colors make it easy to spot any wetness. They also use \u201corganic cotton and ecofriendly dye and are gender-neutral,\u201d she says. Tiny Undies\u2019 underwear is best for younger children between 6 months and 5 years old. $18 at Tiny Undies Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
