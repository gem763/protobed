state of emergency as unrest death toll hits seven", "language": "en", "text": "Santiago (AFP) \u2013 Five people died Sunday when a garment factory was torched by looters near Chile\u2019s capital Santiago, bringing the death toll in a wave of unrest to seven as authorities expanded a state of emergency.\n\nPolice and the military fired tear gas and used water cannon against protesters in the city as clashes over price hikes and social inequality raged through a third day.\n\nAlmost all public transport was paralyzed in Santiago, with shops shuttered and many flights canceled at the international airport, leaving thousands of people stranded and unable to leave due to the curfew.\n\nAfter an emergency meeting late Sunday, President Sebastian Pinera defended his decision to call a state of emergency and deploy troops onto the streets for the first time since Augusto Pinochet\u2019s military dictatorship between 1974-1990.\n\n\u201cDemocracy not only has the right, it has the obligation to defend itself using all the instruments that democracy itself provides, and the rule of law to combat those who want to destroy it,\u201d Pinera said.\n\nThe state of emergency was extended on Sunday, with Interior and Security Minister Andres Chadwick saying new decrees were being drawn up for Antofagasta in the north, Valdivia in the south, and other cities such as Valparaiso, Temuco and Punto Arenas.\n\nFirefighters said five people died in a garment factory burned by rioters in Renca, a northern suburb of Santiago.\n\nEarlier, Chadwick said two women burned to death after a store owned by US retail chain Walmart was set alight in the early hours of Sunday.\n\nOne victim, who authorities initially said had died in hospital, suffered burns on 75 percent of her body.\n\n\u2013 Escalating violence \u2013\n\nAuthorities reported 103 serious incidents throughout the country with 1,462 people detained \u2014 614 in Santiago and 848 in the rest of the country.\n\nProtesters set fire to buses, smashed up metro stations, knocked down traffic lights, ransacked shops and clashed with riot police in Santiago and other cities.\n\nDuring the curfew from 7:00 pm (2200 GMT) until dawn, people should \u201cbe calm and all in their homes,\u201d defense official General Javier Iturriaga announced.\n\nWhat started earlier in the week as a protest against a hike in metro fares escalated dramatically on Friday as demonstrators expressed anger over social inequality and the government\u2019s liberal economic system.\n\nOn Saturday, Pinera announced he was suspending the fare increase.\n\nPinera acknowledged that those in the streets had \u201cgood reasons\u201d to protest but called on them \u201cto demonstrate peacefully.\u201d\n\nThe appeal failed to prevent further rioting and looting.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really sad what\u2019s happening, but the people are outraged because they\u2019re not being listened to,\u201d 26-year-old Antonia told AFP in central Santiago.\n\nDozens of protesters torched a building belonging to Chile\u2019s oldest newspaper, El Mercurio, in Valparaiso on Saturday evening, while elsewhere a metro station, supermarkets and other stores were set on fire.\n\n\u2013 Social tensions erupt \u2013\n\nSantiago\u2019s metro system \u2014 South America\u2019s largest and most modern and used by around three million people a day \u2014 was shut down on Friday as protesters burned and vandalized stations.\n\nLouis de Grange, president of the state Metro S.A. company, told Canal 13 the \u201cbrutal destruction\u201d of the service had caused more than $300 million in damage.\n\nThe hike in fares that set off the violence would have raised the price of peak hour travel from 800 to 830 pesos ($1.13 to $1.15).\n\nThe government said the hike, which followed a 20-peso increase in January, was driven by rising oil prices and a weakening peso.\n\nInitially, students and others responded by fare-dodging, but underlying social tensions quickly bubbled to the surface.\n\nOn Friday, the headquarters of the ENEL Chile power company and a Banco Chile branch \u2014 both in the center of Santiago \u2014 were set on fire and heavily damaged.\n\nChile has the highest per capita income of Latin America at $20,000, with expected economic growth this year of 2.5 percent and just two percent inflation.\n\nBut there is widespread frustration with economic policies that have virtually privatized all health care and education, at a time that falling pensions and rising costs of basic services have exacerbated social inequality.", "description": "Santiago (AFP) \u2013 Five people died Sunday when a garment factory was torched by looters near Chile\u2019s capital Santiago, bringing the death toll",
