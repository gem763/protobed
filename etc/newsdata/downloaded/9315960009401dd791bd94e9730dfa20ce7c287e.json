Stand with Hong Kong.\u201d Though Morey has tried to clarify his statement, Tsai issued his take in a Facebook post.\n\n\u201cWhat is the problem with people freely expressing their opinion? This freedom is an inherent American value and the NBA has been very progressive in allowing players and other constituents a platform to speak out on issues,\u201d Tsai said. The problem is, he said, there are certain topics that are third-rail issues in certain countries.\n\n\u201cSupporting a separatist movement in a Chinese territory is one of those third-rail issues, not only for the Chinese government, but also for all citizens in China.\n\n\u201cThe one thing that is terribly misunderstood, and often ignored, by the western press and those critical of China is that 1.4 billion Chinese citizens stand united when it comes to the territorial integrity of China and the country\u2019s sovereignty over her homeland. This issue is non-negotiable.\u201d\n\nTsai explained why the Chinese people would be upset with Morey\u2019s tweet by laying out the country\u2019s history by foreign invaders.\n\n\u201cI am going into all of this because a student of history will understand that the Chinese psyche has heavy baggage when it comes to any threat, foreign or domestic, to carve up Chinese territories,\u201d Tsai wrote. \u201cWhen the topic of any separatist movement comes up, Chinese people feel a strong sense of shame and anger because of this history of foreign occupation.\n\n\u201cBy now I hope you can begin to understand why the Daryl Morey tweet is so damaging to the relationship with our fans in China. I don\u2019t know Daryl personally. I am sure he\u2019s a fine NBA general manager, and I will take at face value his subsequent apology that he was not as well informed as he should have been. But the hurt that this incident has caused will take a long time to repair.\u201d\n\nTsai, who is also on the NBA\u2019s Board of Governors, asked Chinese fans to \u201ckeep the faith in what the NBA and basketball can do to unite people from all over the world.\u201d\n\nCLICK TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nSeveral Chinese companies suspended work with the Rockets after Morey\u2019s tweet. The general manager said in a separate tweet he was voicing his own opinion on the issues in Hong Kong.\n\n\u201cI did not intend my tweet to cause any offense to Rockets fans and friends of mine in China,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cI was merely voicing one thought, based on one interpretation, of one complicated event. I have had a lot of opportunity since that tweet to hear and consider other perspectives.\u201d\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nHe added: \u201cI have always appreciated the significant support our Chinese fans and sponsors have provided and I would hope that those who are upset will know that offending or misunderstanding them was not my intention. My tweets are my own and in no way represent the Rockets or the NBA.\u201d\n\nThe Rockets have a strong following in China thanks to the most famous Chinese basketball player of all time, Yao Ming, who the team drafted in 2002. Yao is also the president of the country\u2019s official basketball association.\n\n\u201cWe have great respect for the history and culture of China and hope that sports and the NBA can be used as a unifying force to bridge cultural divides and bring people together,\u201d the NBA said in a statement.\n\nProtests in Hong Kong have made worldwide news over the past couple of months thanks to increased violence between the government and those fighting for increased rights and freedom. China appears extremely sensitive to outside parties encouraging the demonstrators, especially within a group they have strong ties to.", "description": "Joe Tsai is making his voice heard amid the row between the Houston Rockets and China.", "authors": ["Ryan Gaydos"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/08/0/0/Joseph-Tsai-.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
