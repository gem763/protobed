Here's a hot take for you: Powell is actually doing a good job.\n\nKrishna Memani, vice chairman of investments at Invesco, gives rave reviews to Powell for how he handled questions in his last press conference in mid-September. The Fed cut rates again, as expected. But that wasn't the real story.\n\nUnlike Powell's press conference in late July, where he flubbed a question about the possibility of more rate cuts with the now infamous \"midcycle adjustment to policy\" phrase, Powell deftly avoided giving the markets a firm commitment about what might be next -- and did so in a way that didn't spook Wall Street.\n\nPowell learning the art of speaking in Fed code\n\n\"It is remarkable that Powell didn't give anything away and thus preserved the operating flexibility of the Fed, something neither he nor previous Fed Chairs Janet Yellen and Ben Bernanke for that matter, were able to do,\" Memani wrote in a recent blog post.", "description": "Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has been roundly criticized by President Donald Trump for not cutting rates fast enough and by investors for possibly ignoring signs of a slowdown.
