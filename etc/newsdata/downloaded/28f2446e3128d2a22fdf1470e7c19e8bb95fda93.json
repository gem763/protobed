I was kind of falling into the abyss.\"\n\nRCMP Staff Sgt. Jennifer Pound is pictured at her home in South Surrey, B.C., on Oct. 10. (Ben Nelms/CBC)\n\nShe says the emotional toll of trying to comfort families of victims behind the scenes led to her post-traumatic stress disorder diagnosis.\n\nPound said RCMP Health Services didn't help her find treatment. When she was finally directed to the force's Occupational Stress Injury clinic, she found there was a 12-month waiting list.\n\nIn her email, Lucki said the clinic serves Canadian Armed Forces personnel in addition to active and retired RCMP members, leading to high demand and long wait times.\n\nShe added in cases where wait times are unacceptable, RCMP Occupational Health Services can facilitate treatment for members through a plan recommended by their physician.\n\nDespite the long wait, Pound says she was pressured by the force to return to work after taking sick leave. \"Our first responders are committing suicide, and that's because there is no help for them,\" she said.\n\nThe latest numbers supplied by the RCMP show 12 members and 10 retirees have taken their lives in the past five years.\n\nRCMP creating online programs to reduce wait\n\nIn her email, Commissioner Lucki explained that the RCMP's process for clearing members to return to duty is based on industry best practices and includes workplace accommodation if needed.\n\nThe RCMP is hiring 14 additional psychologists to work on a Periodic Psychological Health Assessment program for early detection and intervention in mental health issues that will be implemented by spring 2020.\n\nLucki adds the force is working on programs to provide mental health support to members quicker, including launching a telepsychology program on Oct. 1, which would provide services online or by phone, and working on providing internet-based cognitive behaviour therapy.\n\nShe said a study launched in April will monitor officers for their first five years of service in the field, and results will be used \"to get effective treatment and support to our members earlier.\"", "description": "After a high-profile Mountie sounded the alarm about PTSD among RCMP members, Commissioner Brenda Lucki responded that the force is working on providing more programs and services to reduce wait times for officers struggling with mental health issues.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5323383.1571256592!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/when-brenda-lucki-was-sworn-in-as-the-rcmp-s-first-female-commissioner-she-promised-a-new-attitude.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
