Elizabeth Warren\u2019s best polling since she first entered the race for president. It wasn\u2019t just because of who she surpassed in a handful of polls (former Vice President Joe Biden) but also where she surpassed him: the key early states of Iowa and New Hampshire.\n\nA slew of recent polls, like the Des Moines Register/CNN poll in Iowa, the Monmouth University/USA Today poll in New Hampshire, and a national Quinnipiac University poll show Warren settling into frontrunner status along with Biden (while the polls show Warren gaining, Biden hasn\u2019t lost much ground with his lead).\n\nAnd Warren is now narrowly at the front of the pack in Iowa, according to the latest Real Clear Politics polling average of that state. It\u2019s still early, and many of these polls are in the margin of error. But if this trajectory continues, it shows a path for her to the Democratic nomination.\n\n\u201cWarren has put herself in a strong enough position that she has to be considered along with Biden as the two likeliest nominees,\u201d Kyle Kondik, managing editor of Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball, told Vox. \u201cWarren also benefits from the fact that the first two contests are in Iowa and New Hampshire. Biden does much better with black voters than Warren, but there are hardly any nonwhite voters in those two leadoff states.\u201d\n\nTo clinch the nomination, it\u2019s important for Warren to win or come in a close second in Iowa and then win New Hampshire \u2014 a key state bordering her home state of Massachusetts. She\u2019s also invested heavily in the third early state of Nevada, where her campaign has been on the ground since January. Warren is hoping an early state trifecta can help convince voters in South Carolina and Super Tuesday states to vote for her as well.\n\nBiden is still dominant in South Carolina, where support from older black voters, in particular, has buoyed him 21 points ahead of Warren, a new CNN poll shows. But Biden\u2019s advisers have also been tamping down expectations about Iowa and New Hampshire, and banking on the fourth early voting state could be a tough gambit.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders is also still very much in the mix \u2014 he\u2019s the only other candidate polling at double digits nationally, per the latest Real Clear Politics national poll average. Sanders just announced a massive fundraising haul and is a formidable presence in New Hampshire after sweeping the 2016 primary there. But Warren\u2019s slow and steady rise is undeniable, and it appears to have staying power beyond the early states.\n\nA recent LA Times/Berkeley IGS Poll showed her with a 9-point lead in California, an important Super Tuesday state with a huge cache of delegates. And Monmouth University polling director Patrick Murray says Warren has been making strides among multiple groups of voters.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s gained 5 points and 6 points among moderates, but at the same time, she\u2019s gained among liberals,\u201d Murray told Vox. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense that she is a viable general election candidate against the president.\u201d\n\nWith four months away from the Iowa caucuses, anything could happen (case in point, the impeachment inquiry House Democrats have launched against President Donald Trump). But if Warren can continue her upward momentum, capturing the first two states could pay big dividends in subsequent contests.\n\nThe outcome in Iowa and New Hampshire could radically change how many other Democrats around the country view the presidential race, Murray said.\n\nWarren\u2019s trajectory has been slow and steady\n\nIn phase one of the 2020 presidential campaign, Warren\u2019s team largely achieved what it set out to do: a slow and steady rise to frontrunner status.\n\nDespite her opening gate stumble with her DNA ancestry test, Warren\u2019s stable, incremental build has differentiated her from much of the rest of the 2020 field. Candidates like Sen. Kamala Harris, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, and former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke have all enjoyed sudden rises in the polls \u2014 only to see that support fade away.\n\n\u201cIn the story of the tortoise and the hare, we\u2019ve seen a number of hares. But there\u2019s no question Warren has been the tortoise,\u201d Murray said. \u201cYou\u2019re not a flash in the pan, something new. These are people saying I\u2019m thinking about this, I\u2019m pretty committed here. And that suggests she\u2019s not going to lose that support.\u201d\n\nWarren solidified herself early on as \u201cthe plans candidate,\u201d releasing a dizzying array of progressive policy ideas from a wealth tax to a plan to erase the vast majority of America\u2019s student debt, and coining the slogan, \u2018Warren has a plan for that.\u2019 Rather than running on a core message about electability and beating Trump, Warren\u2019s campaign has been characterized by its relentless dedication to rooting out corruption in Washington, DC. Warren has followed by the candidate forgoing high-dollar fundraisers and doing call-time with grassroots supporters, rather than rich donors (something Sanders is also doing).\n\nNow that she is considered a frontrunner, Warren will undoubtedly get more scrutiny from the media and other campaigns; some of Sanders\u2019 top staffers have already started to go after her on policy issues, questioning her dedication to the progressive cause on issues like housing, climate, and education policy. There are still plenty of questions about whether Warren can capture independents, or convince black voters to vote for her instead of Biden.\n\n\u201cWarren does better with white voters, and particularly those with college degrees,\u201d Kondik said. \u201cShe fits the profile of a \u2018wine track\u2019 candidate, an old phrase sometimes used in contrast with \u2018beer track\u2019 candidates to differentiate between candidates who appeal to more upscale, liberal, urban Democrats as opposed to more downscale, less liberal Democrats.\u201d\n\nWith Trump\u2019s impeachment inquiry, the 2020 campaign is entering a new and untested phase\n\nWarren has proved she has staying power heading into the final four crucial months of the campaign \u2014 which is coming at a particularly tumultuous time.\n\nThe past week marked a turning point in the campaign on a number of fronts; as Warren inched closer to Biden\u2019s lead, Washington erupted as House Democrats started to pursue an impeachment inquiry into the allegation that President Donald Trump used his office to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to dig up dirt on Biden and his son.\n\nIt\u2019s too early to tell how this news could impact the Democratic primary, but it\u2019s a big test of Biden\u2019s electability argument that he is the best candidate to take on Trump \u2014 his stated reason for running in the first place.\n\n\u201cHow he handles this will be telling for Democrats,\u201d Murray said. \u201cThis is where Biden gets to prove whether he has what it takes to be that viable generation election candidate.\u201d\n\nWarren doesn\u2019t have the same immediate pressure as Biden on the Trump and Ukraine scandal. Nonetheless, it gives her another opening to hammer her message of anti-corruption, especially with the current administration embodying much of what she opposes.\n\nMeanwhile, the Warren campaign is expanding. Last week, Warren campaign manager Roger Lau sent a memo to supporters announcing the campaign would launch an eight-figure TV and digital ad buy in the coming months as well as hire more staff in states beyond the first four.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re targeting our resources to invest in places that will be critical to keeping the House, taking back the US Senate, and regaining ground in key state legislatures in 2020,\u201d Lau said.\n\nThe next few months will be crucial for Warren\u2019s campaign. They\u2019ve made it clear they have a plan.", "description": "It rests on winning Iowa and New Hampshire.", "authors": ["Ella Nilsen", "Hannah Brown", "Jen Kirby", "Peter Kafka", "Matthew Yglesias", "Sean Collins", "German Lopez", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w8goj-S8Ozi9_g0VebAxMLLBT-w=/0x0:6000x3141/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19249030/GettyImages_1171360659.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
