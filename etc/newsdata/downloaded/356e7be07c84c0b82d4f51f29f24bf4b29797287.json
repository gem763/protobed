Djokovic met his opponent with a warm embrace at the net.\n\nDjokovic, who had looked imperious up until now, had no complaints.\n\nAsked if Tsitsipas has the potential to be number one, the 32-year-old Serbian replied: \"He definitely has, yes.\"\n\n- 'Really tight' -\n\nDjokovic says that he is fully recovered from a shoulder injury and he did not drop a set in winning the title in Tokyo last week.\n\nHe had carried that ominous form into Shanghai and threatened to blow Tsitsipas away in the first set.\n\nBut Tsitsipas found his feet in the second set, then went 3-1 up in the decider when Djokovic planted a forehand wide on the third break point.\n\nTsitsipas grabbed his place at the ATP Finals after fourth-ranked Medvedev tamed self-styled \"wild horse\" Fabio Fognini 6-3, 7-6 (7/4).\n\nUS Open finalist Medvedev has beaten Tsitsipas in all their four matches, but he said: \"They were all really tight. He's improving also every week.\n\n\"He's still so young. He has even, let's say, two years of more improving than me, talking about age.\"\n\nNadal was not in action in Shanghai because of a wrist injury.", "description": "Roger Federer's trademark cool spectacularly deserted him and he was given a point penalty as he followed Novak Djokovic out of the Shanghai Masters quarter-finals on Friday.
