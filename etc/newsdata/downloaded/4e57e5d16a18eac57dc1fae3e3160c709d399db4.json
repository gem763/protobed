So, apparently, a young student used a vibrator on 32,000 tomatoes to help them pollinate. If that sounds weird to you, then it might come as a surprise that this is not the first time a vibrator has been used as a pollination catalyst. It is actually not a very uncommon method.\n\nAnyway coming back to the tomatoes. There is a popular R4 programme where amateur gardeners can question a panel of experts, in front of live audience.\n\nPanellist Christine, was discussing the most effective ways to grow one of Britain\u2019s best loved fruits, tomatoes and reportedly said, \u201cOne of my worst jobs ever as a young student was using a vibrator on 32,000 tomatoes.\u201d\n\nAlamy\n\nAmused, Chairperson of Gardeners\u2019 Question Time Kathy Clugston said for that, \u201cI can\u2019t believe this has just come out after all these years. I don\u2019t suppose there is any photographic evidence to put on our Twitter Feed?\u201d\n\nDon't Miss 108.3 K SHARES 16.7 K SHARES 11.9 K SHARES 5.2 K SHARES 2.2 K SHARES\n\nTickling the audience even further Christine reportedly said, \u201cThe things you get asked to do to become a professional horticulturist. That was day after day with a mechanical vibrator, you had to tickle every flower. It was the most boring, monotonous, mind numbing job that would put all us determined students off.\u201d\n\nGMA network/Sutton\n\nAccording to the website GMA network, \u2018Vibrators can be used to stimulate plants that require buzz pollination. In one trial at the Louisiana State University Agricultural Center, they managed to pollinate 640 tomato plants with a vibrator. The entire operation took 11.75 hours, but did lead to an increase in yield and profit. The vibrators have also been successfully used on crops that usually rely on wind pollination\u2019.\n\nAh well, goes on to show that it works for the most of us.", "description": "I hope you know what a vibrator is, because for this story you would need that knowledge.
