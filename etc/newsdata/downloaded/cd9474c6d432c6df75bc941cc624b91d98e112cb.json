It had \u201cIreland\u201d emblazoned on the windscreen along with the message \u201cThe Ultimate Dream\u201d. The driver, a 25-year-old man from Northern Ireland, remained in custody.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said he was appalled by the news and was receiving regular updates about the investigation which was focused on human trafficking.\n\n\u201cWe know that this trade is going on - all such traders in human beings should be hunted down and brought to justice,\u201d he said.\n\nAll those in the container were pronounced dead at the scene after the emergency services were called to the Waterglade Industrial Park, not far from docks on the River Thames.\n\nPolice said the trailer had traveled from Belgium to Purfleet and landed shortly after 12.30 a.m. on Wednesday (2330 GMT Tuesday). It left the port on the truck at about 1.05 a.m. and ambulance services notified police about the discovery of the bodies at 1.40 a.m.\n\nOriginally it was thought both parts of the vehicle had entered Britain at Holyhead in North Wales on Saturday and to have originally started its journey in Bulgaria.\n\nThe Bulgarian Foreign Ministry said while the vehicle was registered in Bulgaria by a company owned by an Irish woman on June 19, 2017, it had left the next day and never returned.\n\nBulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov said his country had no other connection with the deaths.\n\nPolice is seen at the scene where bodies were discovered in a lorry container, in Grays, Essex, Britain October 23, 2019. REUTERS/Peter Nicholls\n\n\u201cDESPERATE AND DANGEROUS SITUATION\u201d\n\nEarlier Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said Irish authorities would carry out any investigations necessary if it was established that the truck had passed through Ireland.\n\nPolice officers in forensic suits were inspecting a large white container on a red truck next to warehouses at the site and had sealed off much of the surrounding area of the estate with large green barriers as they carried out their investigation.\n\n\u201cAt this stage, we have not identified where the victims are from or their identities and we anticipate this could be a lengthy process,\u201d Essex Police Deputy Chief Constable Pippa Mills told reporters.\n\nShe said the trailer, which still contained the bodies, would be taken to a secure location at nearby Tilbury Docks so the bodies could be recovered.\n\n\u201cI appreciate how much attention this incident will continue to attract and the public and media appetite to understand what\u2019s happened. We also need to understand what has happened,\u201d Mills said.\n\nFor years, illegal immigrants have attempted to reach Britain stowed away in the back of trucks, often seeking to reach the United Kingdom from the European mainland.\n\nIn Britain\u2019s biggest illegal immigrant tragedy in 2000, customs officials found the bodies of 58 Chinese people crammed into a tomato truck at the southern port of Dover. It had begun its journey in Zeebrugge.\n\nSlideshow (34 Images)\n\nJeremy Corbyn, the leader of the opposition Labour Party, said the latest deaths were an unbelievable human tragedy that needed answers.\n\n\u201cCan we just think for a moment of what it must have been like for those 39 people, obviously in a desperate and dangerous situation, for their lives to end, suffocated to death in a container,\u201d he said.", "description": "British police found the bodies of 39 people inside a truck at an industrial estate near London on Wednesday and said they had arrested the driver on suspicion of murder.", "authors": ["Hannah Mckay", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1444084930&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M0YG", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
