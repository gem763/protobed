It will be very physical and intense but weather that storm and keep 15 men on the field and life should be close to plain sailing.\n\nThe Pumas will know that some England players can be fiery and that officialdom is a little jittery over what constitutes a legal tackle and they will play on that.\n\nExpect the Pumas to test Joe Marler's patience in the hope of a reaction, ditto Maro Itoje and Kyle Sinckler, and to test Owen Farrell's tackling technique.\n\nThat is not a criticism, any side playing England towards the business end of this World Cup would do the same.\n\nIf Eddie Jones's side concentrate on weathering an early storm, they will win the clash\n\nJoe Marler and his England colleagues must keep cool early on in the vital pool stage clash\n\nThe only major danger tactically for England lies in the Pumas clever use of the rolling maul which they used to good effect against Tonga when their hooker Julian Montoya helped himself to three tries with two from such moves.\n\nThese mauls can be very difficult to defend and not only can they result in you coughing up seven points they often force a yellow card from the defending team so England need to beware, be disciplined in defence and make sure they play as little of the game in their own 22.\n\nDon't give penalties away, not even on the halfway line, because with nothing to lose the Pumas will go for broke and look to pump kicks right into the corner to set up the driving maul.\n\nOther than that I envisage little danger unless the Pumas have been keeping their powder very dry. The flair we saw in 2007 and 2015 has gone out of their game. They have become much more predictable.\n\nI am a big admirer of the Pumas and what they have achieved but they are going through a difficult transitional period.\n\nThey have shot themselves in the foot by leaving payers like Juan Imhoff, Santiago Cordero and Fecundo Isa in France. You just do not deserve success at World Cups if you leave some of your best players out for any reason outside of ability.\n\nArgentina have looked less menacing since insisting on selecting only players who play for the Jaguares. Strangely they have pulled in a couple from the T14 for this World Cup but not the big names. It doesn't make sense.\n\nVeteran hooker Agustin Creevy has found himself out of Argentina's team in recent matches\n\nThe shape of their team is changing in other ways. Their long-time skipper Agustin Creevy, one of the world's best hookers in his pomp, is no longer first choice and points machine Nicholas Sanchez is surplus to requirements.\n\nThey will be a step or two up from Tonga and the USA, but England should welcome that. If England concentrate on producing their A game they should win with plenty to spare as they have too much pace, power and variety - Argentina are there for the taking.\n\nEngland have a really settled look and hitting the ground running against France next week is important. These are big games and victory in both would set up England for a quarter-final against Australia which on balance I would prefer rather than Wales who have the wind in their sails.\n\nI would expect England to take control against the Pumas pack and I've got a feeling this will be the match that Anthony Watson re-announces himself to the wider rugby world.\n\nTwo achilles tendons operations took a lot of getting back from and it's taken time but I have seen enough flashes of quality in recent weeks to believe he is back to his best.\n\nThe ball hasn't quite run his way yet but from the way he has been leaping for and taking high balls and twisting and turning in right spaces I would say he is looking very sharp. The tries could come in a rush for Watson when he really starts motoring.\n\nThis could the match that sees Anthony Watson rediscover his best form after long-term injury\n\nDuring the first week of this World Cup the topic de jour seemed to be tackling and specifically tackling heights while in the second week it has been the apparently slippery ball in Japan caused by the heat and humidity both their indoors arenas and outdoors.\n\nThe error count - dropped passes, spilt off-loads, dropped kicks - has been unusually high in most matches with even sides like New Zealand spilling the ball more than usual.\n\nIt is an issue, but good players and teams adapt. Japan's handling, other than when affected by nerves in the early stages of their opening game, has still been immaculate because they are well used to playing in such conditions.\n\nThere have been many handling errors including from New Zealand fly-half Beauden Barrett\n\nIt was notable on Thursday that Fiji, who learn their rugby in hot humid and often rainy conditions, returned to something like their best in difficult wet conditions against Georgia.\n\nEngland, with Eddie Jones more aware than most of the conditions after his time in Japan, held two long camps in Treviso this summer - and not because the love heat per se or even the laid back Italian ambience.\n\nThey went mainly because it gets very humid in that part of Italy and Eddie wanted his side totally at home in such conditions. And so far so good on that one.\n\nSome seem to have been caught by surprise but there are still a couple of quick fixes to help. Firstly shorten the length of pass - as you would in heavy rain - and then pay extra care to give that pass sympathetically.\n\nThe most important issue though is not the actual passing but players coughing up the slippery ball in contact.
