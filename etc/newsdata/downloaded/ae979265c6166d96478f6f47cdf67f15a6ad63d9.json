That \"floating White House\" then served eight presidents, from Herbert Hoover to Jimmy Carter, between the years of 1933 and 1977.\n\nThe USS Sequoia could accommodate up to eight people across five staterooms, but could also host more than 20 for dinners and parties. JFK even had his 46th birthday party on board. The vessel has a storied history, with presidents cruising on it for both leisure and business.\n\nJimmy Carter sold the USS Sequoia at auction in 1977, and since then, it has changed hands many times. Over the last decade, it has fallen into decay and been the focal point of a lengthy legal battle.\n\nThe yacht, which has been home to a family of raccoons in Virginia in recent years, was barged to Belfast, Maine, earlier in October to begin the restoration process.\n\nKeep reading for a look at the vessel and its history.", "description": "Sold at auction in the 1970s and now undergoing a total rebuild, the once-opulent yacht hosted JFK's birthday and many other presidential events.", "authors": ["Taylor Borden"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db852fedee01954f41b9aa4?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
