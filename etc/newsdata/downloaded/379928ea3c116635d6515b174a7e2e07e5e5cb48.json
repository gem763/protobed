(Photo: Blizzard)\n\nA Hong Kong-based esports athlete has been suspended from competition for speaking out in favor of protests against Chinese control over the semi-autonomous city.\n\nAnd the game maker's actions have caught the attention of U.S. lawmakers.\n\nNg Wai Chung, who uses the nickname \"Blitzchung,\" when playing the game \"Hearthstone,\" donned a gas mask and declared, \u201cLiberate Hong Kong. Revolution of our age!\u201d during a streamed post-match video interview.\n\n\"As you know there are serious protests in my country now. My call on stream was just another form of participation of the protest that I wish to grab more attention,\" he told esports site Inven Global on Sunday after the interview. The player lists his hometown as Hong Kong on the Hearthstone site.\n\nActivision Blizzard, which publishes the game and runs international competitions including the Asia-Pacific Grandmasters that Blitzchung was participating in, subsequently banned the player for one year saying he had broken the organization's rules.\n\nPS5: Sony confirms PlayStation 5 launching in 2020: What we know\n\nPay TV: Cable is charging how much more? That's it. I'm cutting the cord, finally\n\nBlitzchung's actions, the company said in an announcement, violated a rule that \"Engaging in any act that, in Blizzard\u2019s sole discretion, brings you into public disrepute, offends a portion or group of the public, or otherwise damages Blizzard image will result in removal from Grandmasters and reduction of the player\u2019s prize total to $0 USD, in addition to other remedies which may be provided for under the Handbook and Blizzard\u2019s Website Terms.\"\n\nThe game publisher also severed ties with the two videocasters who had hosted the interview. One Hearthstone player noted that the casters actually encouraged Blitzchung.\n\nClarification: the casters requested/encouraged Blitzchung to say what he said in Mandarin (in case you didn\u2019t understand the clip). They said \u201cSay the eight words, then we\u2019ll end the interview immediately.\u201d Then, they hid under the desk. \u2014 Chua Zhihong (@czhihong) October 8, 2019\n\nBlizzard said, in its announcement, that while it stood by \"one\u2019s right to express individual thoughts and opinions, players and other participants that elect to participate in our esports competitions must abide by the official competition rules.\"\n\nBut some lawmakers are not appeased. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said: \"No American company should sensor calls for freedom to make a quick buck.\"\n\nBlizzard shows it is willing to humiliate itself to please the Chinese Communist Party. No American company should censor calls for freedom to make a quick buck. https://t.co/rJBeXUiwYS \u2014 Ron Wyden (@RonWyden) October 8, 2019\n\nSen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., in a tweet of his own, called the action a sign of \"China using access to market as leverage to crush free speech globally.\"\n\nRecognize what\u2019s happening here. People who don\u2019t live in #China must either self censor or face dismissal & suspensions. China using access to market as leverage to crush free speech globally. Implications of this will be felt long after everyone in U.S. politics today is gone. https://t.co/Cx3tkWc7r6 \u2014 Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) October 8, 2019\n\nThis action comes as the NBA finds itself amid controversy with China after Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey posted a since-deleted tweet in support of protesters in Hong Kong. Chinese-born Hall of Famer Yao Ming played for the Rockets, which made the team popular in the country. The NBA is attempting to foster a global audience and has two preseason games in China this week.\n\nThere are other aspects that tie the two incidents together. Tencent, which owns a 5% stake in Activision Blizzard, is also the NBA\u2019s exclusive digital partner in China.\n\nU.S. companies are seeking to strike a balance in maintaining access to China's massive and lucrative audience, while also dealing with the country's sociopolitical differences.\n\n\"There are a lot of companies afraid to rile up China because of the risk of lost sales,\" Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania professor Wiltold Henisz told USA TODAY sports columnist Jeff Zillgitt, who is covering that story.\n\nMany esports followers online found fault with Blizzard for suspending Blitzchung.\n\nAn entirely parallel scandal to the NBA is rocking the e-sports world. Blizzard punishes a Hong Kong gamer for expressing his support for the protests. It\u2019s an American company, but Tencent has a 5 percent stake. This stuff has gone on a long time, time for USG to pay attention? https://t.co/env3Fy4lm4 \u2014 Paul Mozur \u5b5f\u5efa\u56fd (@paulmozur) October 8, 2019\n\nEsports consultant Rod Breslau, who noted Monday that Blitzchung had been suspended, said that online video of the interview had been deleted, too.\n\nBlizzard had not responded to his request as to why the video had been removed, Breslau tweeted.\n\nBlizzard have yet to reply to request for comment on why they deleted the VOD. the heat the NBA is (deservedly) getting for their response to the Morey situation will make Blizzard think twice about how they handle this \u2014 Rod Breslau (@Slasher) October 7, 2019\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Mike Snider on Twitter: @MikeSnider.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/talkingtech/2019/10/08/blizzard-suspended-hearthstone-player-pro-hong-kong-protest/3912838002/", "description": "Video game maker Blizzard suspended Blitzchung, an esports competitor, after he made a pro-Hong Kong appeal during a livestreamed interview.", "authors": ["Mike Snider", "Published P.M.
