On the night New England unveiled its sixth NFL championship banner, Super Bowl MVP Julian Edelman caught six passes for 83 yards and also completed a throw to help the Patriots begin their title defense.\n\nNo one has won back-to-back NFL titles since New England did it in 2003 and `04.\n\nFacing the last team to beat them, back in Week 15 last year, the Patriots opened a 20-0 lead before Pittsburgh kicked a field goal on fourth-and-goal from the 1 with 10:17 left in the third quarter. Brady responded with a 58-yard touchdown pass to Dorsett and a 27-3 lead.\n\nTom Brady now has 88 career 300-yard passing games, 3rd-most all-time. <br><br>The two ahead of him?<br><br>Drew Brees (115) and Peyton Manning (93) <a href=\"https://t.co/B8ofyTBiq5\">pic.twitter.com/B8ofyTBiq5</a> \u2014@ESPNStatsInfo\n\nDorsett had four catches for 95 yards and the first multi-score game of his career. He will be moving down the depth chart Monday when the Patriots are expected to make Brown's signing official.\n\n\"He's a playmaker,\" Edelman said. \"The more playmakers you have, the more dynamic we can be.\"\n\nThe move couldn't be welcome in Pittsburgh. Unable to get Brown to behave, the Steelers refused to trade the disgruntled diva to New England only to see him wind up with the team that has reached the AFC championship game eight straight seasons.\n\n\"Whatever,\" said quarterback Ben Roethlisberger.\n\n\"Didn't spend a lot of time thinking about it or dwelling on it,\" coach Mike Tomlin said. \"I'm not specifically worried about anything relative to Antonio Brown.\"\n\nRoethlisberger completed 27 of 47 passes for 277 yards and an interception, though 116 of the yards came on non-scoring drives in the fourth quarter with the Steelers down four scores. The offence showed the effects of losing two of its biggest playmakers: Brown, who talked and tweeted his way out of both Pittsburgh and Oakland in one offseason, and running back Le'Veon Bell, a two-time All-Pro who sat out all of last season to avoid a franchise tag.\n\nJonathan Jones, left, of the New England Patriots defends a pass intended for Diontae Johnson of the Pittsburgh Steelers during the second half.

Top receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster caught six passes for 78 yards, 26 of it coming on one throw in the final six minutes with the Steelers already trailing 33-3.\n\nThe drive ended when Roethlisberger threw it into the end zone from the 41-yard line and was picked off by Devin McCourty.\n\nThe Steelers had five full possessions in the first half and punted on four of them, going three-and-out three times.\n\n\"We got our butts whooped,\" defensive tackle Cameron Heyward said.\n\nAB negative\n\nBrown, who asked for and was granted his release by Oakland on Saturday morning and then agreed to terms with the Patriots in the afternoon, and was not yet eligible to play.\n\nThere was no sign of him at the stadium. The Patriots are expected to announce on Monday the one-year deal that will guarantee the four-time All-Pro $9 million US. Asked about it during his postgame news conference, coach Bill Belichick didn't even allow a reporter to finish his question.\n\n\"Do you have any comment on the reports ... \"\n\n\"No,\" Belichick interrupted. \"Next.\"\n\n\"Of Antonio Brown ...\"\n\n\"Next,\" Belichick said.\n\nBanner night\n\nThe Patriots made room for another Super Bowl memento above their south end zone.\n\nThe team unveiled their sixth championship banner before the game in a ceremony that included fireworks and a highlight video projected onto a screen covering much of the field.\n\nThe New England Patriots unveil their Super Bowl LIII championship banner.
