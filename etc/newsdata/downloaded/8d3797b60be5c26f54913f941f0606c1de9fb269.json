That has complicated Turkey's plan to create a \"safe zone\" south of its border with Syria where it would resettle Syrian refugees currently living in Turkey. The territory had previously been vacated by U.S. troops.\n\nKalin said the refugees \"don't want to go back to areas under regime control.\"\n\nHe says: \"This is one of the topics that we will discuss with the Russians, because, again, we are not going to force any refugees to go to anywhere they don't want to go. We want to create conditions that will be suitable for them to return where they will feel safe.\"\n\n___\n\n9:10 p.m.\n\nA senior Turkish official is denying that the Turkish military is blocking the withdrawal of Syrian Kurdish fighters from the border areas following a U.S. brokered cease-fire.\n\nThe official said Saturday that Ankara got \"everything we wanted at the negotiating table\" in talks with Vice President Mike Pence.\n\n\"It is bizarre to think that we'd violate an agreement that we like,\" the official said speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\nKurdish fighters say they can't withdraw from Ras al-Ayn, a town at the border with Turkey, because Turkish-backed fighters have besieged them and prevented the evacuation of the wounded.\n\nOn Saturday, a medical convoy was allowed into the town, evacuating nearly 40 wounded. Activists said others remain in need of evacuation in a hospital controlled by the Kurdish forces.\n\n\u2014 By Sarah El Deeb.\n\n___\n\n9 p.m.\n\nActivists say a medical convoy including the Syrian and Kurdish Red Crescent has entered the Syrian border town of Ras al-Ayn, which has been besieged for days by Turkish-led forces, and it delivered aid and evacuated wounded.\n\nDani Ellis, a volunteer in northeast Syria who travelled with the convoy, says Turkish-backed fighters opened a corridor Saturday for the convoy to reach a hospital and surrounding neighborhoods still controlled by Kurdish-fighters at the southeast edge of Ras al-Ayn.\n\nShe said fighting in the town the past three days had been intense but as they entered the town only a few shots in the distance were heard. The hospital was dark and without electricity. Kurdish-led forces have complained that Turkey was violating the U.S.-brokered ceasefire by continuing the siege and assault on Ras al-Ayn and preventing the evacuation of wounded.\n\nThe convoy of about 20 ambulances delivered basic supplies and brought out 37 wounded civilians, medical personnel and fighters, but did not have space to evacuate all the wounded. Most had gunshot injuries.\n\nA convoy of the Turkish Red Cross also said it entered Ray al-Ayn on Saturday evening, delivering supplies\n\n___\n\n8 p.m.\n\nThe Turkish Red Crescent says it has delivered humanitarian aid to hundreds of people in the town of Ras al-Ayn in northern Syria following Turkey's military offensive against Syrian Kurdish forces.\n\nThe humanitarian organization said it delivered food aid to 2,000 people. Video showed Turkish soldiers and Turkey-backed Syrian forces as people lined up for aid packs.\n\nTurkish Red Crescent and Turkey's Disaster and Emergency Management Agency staff delivered the aid.\n\nTurkey launched its operation into northeastern Syria last week against the Syrian Kurdish People's Protection Units, or YPG, which it calls terrorists.\n\nA 120-hour cease-fire brokered by the U.S. and Turkey was mostly holding on its second day, despite accusations of violations from both the Syrian Kurdish forces and Turkey.\n\n___\n\n2 p.m.\n\nA war monitor group says Turkey-backed Syrian fighters have clashed in several locations with Kurdish forces, in possible violations of a U.S.-brokered cease-fire in northern Syria.\n\nThe Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Saturday that the Turkish proxy forces crossed into Syria east of Ras al-Ayn to a village where clashes have been ongoing since Friday.", "description": "The spokesman for President Recep Tayyip Erdogan says Turkey wants Syrian government forces to move away from a border area so it can  resettle up to 2 million refugees.
