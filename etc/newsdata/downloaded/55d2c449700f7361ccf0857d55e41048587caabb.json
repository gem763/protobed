The whole process might take a few months, and then it'd be on to the next single.\n\nYouTube\n\nBut Lizzo's \"Truth Hurts\" has experienced a different trajectory entirely: It bubbled up for about a year and a half before taking off earlier this year, and now it sits at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 for a seventh (nonconsecutive) week. So it only makes sense that, when it came time for something new, Lizzo \u2014 whose breakthrough album, Cuz I Love You, came out earlier this year \u2014 would opt to reinvigorate a single even older than \"Truth Hurts.\"\n\nThat'd be 2016's unstoppable, wonderful \"Good As Hell,\" which now has its very own 2019 remix thanks to an assist from another pop juggernaut: Ariana Grande, who joins the fun with her own demand to be treated right. (\"He better know my worth,\" she sings, adding, \"There's so much that I deserve.\")\n\nDon't be surprised to see Grande's presence inspire a much-deserved renaissance for \"Good As Hell.\" And, hey, if that works, Lizzo's catalog doesn't end there: She's got two more albums (2013's Lizzobangers and 2015's Big Grrrl Small World), just waiting for their own overdue turn at the top of the charts.", "description": "Pop juggernaut Ariana Grande joins the fun in this remix of the unstoppable 2016 song, with her own demand to be treated right.", "authors": ["Stephen Thompson"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/10/25/gettyimages-1181993343_wide-38d6800f5fac1689d6641ebd90d65336ca08725a.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
