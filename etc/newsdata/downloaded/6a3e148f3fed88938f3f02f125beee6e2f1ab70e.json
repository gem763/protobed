If you\u2019re Zac Posen, you hire Steven Sebring to shoot 360-degree videos of Winnie Harlow modeling each look in the collection.\n\nHarlow moves like a ballerina in every outfit, and the collection draws on Posen\u2019s archives (read: award-show-worthy gowns) as well as Asian art. The result is clothes that Posen describes as \u201csoft armors\u201d \u2014 structured and delicate, strong and gentle, all at the same time. In addition to tulle confectioneries like the one shown above and below, there are navy suits with handkerchief hems and leg slits, a red dress with a peplum that cascades out like petals on a flower, and plenty of the structured corsetry you come to Zac Posen to see. The collection notes ended with \u201cThe future is here.\u201d This isn\u2019t the first time this year that Posen has brought a techy edge to his work. For the Met Gala, he partnered with General Electric to make 3D-printed dresses for Jourdan Dunn, Katie Holmes, and more.\n\nYou can see each of the looks in 360 video on Posen\u2019s website, but just as a taste, enjoy look four below.", "description": "How do you give the immersive experience of a fashion show without actually staging one?
