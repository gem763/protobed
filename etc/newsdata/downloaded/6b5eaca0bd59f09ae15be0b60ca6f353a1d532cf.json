''It will be a long, hard struggle, but it is a necessary and just war.'' Whether or not Mr. Hussein had possessed unconventional weapons, Mr. McCain said, ''he had used them before and was, I have no doubt, firmly determined to acquire them again for what terrible purpose we can only anticipate with dread.''\n\nIt was last week when Mr. McCain was spurning Senator John Kerry's repeated proposals to be his running mate, dashing hopes of Democrats who viewed a Kerry-McCain ticket as unstoppable. A CBS News poll recently found that a Kerry-McCain ticket had a 14 percentage point edge over Mr. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney among registered voters, 53 percent to 39 percent, compared with most head-to-head polls that show Mr. Kerry alone tied or slightly ahead of Mr. Bush.\n\nMr. Bush's political operatives say they never took the idea seriously, but they did not hide their pleasure about seeing the independent and unpredictable Mr. McCain suddenly at the president's side. Mr. McCain, a close friend of Mr. Kerry, has regularly infuriated the White House with barbs over the last few years. Mr. Bush's political advisers reached out to him during his flirtation with Mr. Kerry, and Friday appeared to be a classic triumph of politics over personal feeling.\n\nMr. McCain, asked why he was campaigning with Mr. Bush, genially replied, ''First time I was asked.''\n\nMr. Bush appeared nothing but pleased that Mr. McCain was at his side.\n\n''Both candidates in this race are honored to be the friend of John McCain,'' the president proclaimed here. ''Only one of us gets his vote. And I am proud that it is me.''\n\nAt both stops, Mr. Bush and Mr. McCain linked arms in a tableau, creating an image of the president with a Vietnam War hero and a man with a strong appeal to independent voters that will be of use to Mr. Bush's campaign. Neither Mr. Bush nor Vice President Dick Cheney served in combat.\n\n''There's fundamental agreement on the policies,'' a spokesman for the campaign, Terry Holt, said. ''This shows our party is united on the big issues.''", "description": "Sen John McCain and Pres Bush, in speeches to thousands of soldiers in Fort Lewis, Wash, present unusual joint defense of war in Iraq; call war conflict between good and evil that threatens existence of US; united front of president and his old political nemesis is striking development at time when Bush is under political siege for stating that ties between Iraq and Al Qaeda justified going to war against Saddem Hussein (M)", "authors": ["Elisabeth Bumiller"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultPromoCrop.png", "published_at": "2004-06-19"}
