but the prime minister dismissed suggestions that his deal breached the principle of consent.\n\nImage copyright Dan Kitwood Image caption Boris Johnson said his deal is fully compatible with the Good Friday Agreement\n\n\"In all frankness I do think it a pity that it is thought necessary for one side or the other of the debate in Northern Ireland to have a veto on those arrangements,\" he told MPs.\n\nHe argued that the Brexit referendum had taken place on a straight majority basis, adding: \"I think that principle should be applied elsewhere, I see no reason why it should not apply in Northern Ireland as well.\"\n\n'Inviolable'\n\nOn Saturday morning, DUP MP Sammy Wilson met with members of the Eurosceptic European Research Group (ERG), but it has encouraged its members to support the deal.\n\nIndependent unionist MP for North Down, Lady Hermon, has not confirmed whether she will support the government's plan.\n\nShe told Mr Johnson there is \"anger\" in Northern Ireland's unionist community over his deal - but the PM said he is committed to the constitutional position of Northern Ireland, calling it \"inviolable\".\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Boris Johnson: \"Chance to move on\" with Brexit\n\nA number of Conservative MPs in the ERG have supported the DUP's stance on Brexit in the past - but it is not clear if any of them will vote against the government this time.\n\nBefore the vote on the deal can go ahead, MPs will vote on an amendment - tabled by Oliver Letwin - that would withhold approval of the deal until the legislation to enact it was safely passed - a move that would automatically trigger the \"Benn Act\" and force the prime minister to request a further postponement of Brexit until 31 January.\n\nSpeaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Nigel Dodds described the Letwin amendment as \"very interesting\" and said the party would \"look at that very closely and examine it\".\n\n\"What it may do is ensure that there is proper examination of all the details and allow a proper exploration of some of the statements that are being made about this withdrawal Brexit deal,\" said Mr Dodds.\n\nThe BBC understands if the Letwin amendment is passed, the government plans to hold a vote on the entire Withdrawal Agreement Bill on Tuesday.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption DUP: PM 'too eager for deal at any cost'\n\nWhat does the deal involve for NI?\n\nThe new Brexit deal would involve Stormont giving ongoing consent to any special arrangements for Northern Ireland via a straight majority, instead of on a cross-community basis.\n\nNorthern Ireland would continue to follow EU rules on food safety and product standards and would also leave the EU customs union.\n\nBut EU customs procedures would still apply on goods coming into Northern Ireland from Great Britain in order to avoid checks at the border.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption The issue of the Irish border has been the most contentious in the Brexit talks\n\nStormont would have to approve those arrangements on an ongoing basis.\n\nApproval would involve a straight-forward majority, which would keep the special arrangements in place for four years.\n\nAlternatively, if the arrangements are approved by a majority of nationalists and a majority of unionists, they would remain in place for eight years.\n\nIf the Northern Ireland Assembly voted to end the arrangements there would be a two-year notice period, during which the UK and the EU would have to agree ways to protect the peace process and avoid a hard border.\n\nIf a vote was not held - by choice or because the assembly was not sitting - then the government has committed to finding an \"alternative process\".\n\nEx-PMs unite to oppose deal\n\nFormer prime ministers Sir John Major and Tony Blair appealed on Friday for MPs not to vote for the deal, claiming it would \"wreck\" the 1998 Good Friday peace agreement, which led to the end of the Troubles in Northern Ireland.\n\nThey called for another referendum on Brexit.\n\nFormer Northern Ireland first minister Lord Trimble, who won a Nobel Peace Prize for his role in Good Friday Agreement, backed the deal.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Lord Trimble, a Conservative peer, was one of the key architects of the Good Friday Agreement\n\nIn a statement published by the Spectator, the former Ulster Unionist leader said it was a \"great step forward\" that was \"fully in accordance with the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement\".\n\n\"What we now want to see is for the DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in to act together to bring the Good Friday Agreement back to life,\" said the Tory peer.\n\n\"This is not the time to be looking for excuses not to implement either the Good Friday Agreement or the new deal.\"", "description": "The DUP's deputy leader says the party will not support the government in the EU withdrawal deal vote.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1096D/production/_109294976_doddsangry.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
