I thought they played well and we didn't match it.\n\n\"That's the nature of rugby - it's not just that if you do your analysis you'll beat somebody.\"\n\nDespite the loss to Japan, Ireland remain on course for the quarter-finals heading into their final Pool A match against Samoa.\n\nBut after bouncing back from the Japan defeat with a 35-0 win over Russia in Kobe on Thursday, the Irish now have a lengthy break until they face the Pacific islanders on October 12.\n\nStockdale said that for all Ireland coach Joe Schmidt was presenting a relaxed face in public, the 54-year-old New Zealander was still coming down hard on his players.\n\n\"Whenever we're training Joe likes to push the intensity and really build it which is obviously class for us as players, you get that intensity that's almost like a match,\" he explained.\n\n\"It's amazing how much pressure one man can put on an entire team but it's brilliant he does.\n\n\"Whenever you're off he's a bit more relaxed and you're able to chill out a bit more, I think he gets a really good balance in his coaching style.\"", "description": "Ireland wing Jacob Stockdale insisted Japan haven't set the template for beating the Six Nations side after their shock victory at the Rugby World Cup.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7884/7f0e47b6425e4c7db0f4231b19965adc.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
