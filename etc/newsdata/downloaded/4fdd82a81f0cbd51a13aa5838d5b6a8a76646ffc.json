He had also funded an \"extravagant lifestyle\" using money from companies in Turkey and the Cayman Islands, including buying a \u00a3200,000 Bentley from a Mayfair dealership.\n\nLuxury goods\n\nTransparency International researchers also analysed \"suspicious payments\" for high-value goods which mainly came from Russia and Azerbaijan.\n\nThese payments stemmed from so-called \"laundromat\" money-laundering, Transparency International alleged.\n\nThey found transactions including a \"Chanel crocodile skin handbag and Tom Ford crocodile skin jacket from Harrods totalling \u00a350,690\" and \"a shell company paying Chelsea Football Club for a corporate executive box at Stamford Bridge\" costing \u00a3126,000.\n\nThere were \u00a3570m worth of these transactions between 2003 and 2017, the charity said.\n\nThe funds were paid into accounts at banks including Citibank, Royal Bank of Scotland, JP Morgan, HSBC and Barclays, Transparency International said, while noting that these banks had said they have strict anti-money laundering processes in place.\n\nCash from \"laundromat\" money-laundering also found its way to prestigious public schools, including Charterhouse and Harrow, and universities including University College London and St Andrews, the charity said.\n\nHarrow School responded: \"We never comment on matters concerning pupils, but note the report emphasises that neither we, nor any of the other institutions mentioned, are implicated in any wrongdoing.\"\n\nDuncan Hames, director of policy at Transparency International UK, said: \"We've known for a long time that the UK's world-class services have attracted a range of clients, including those who have money and pasts to hide.\n\n\"Now, for the first time, we have shed light on who these companies are and how they have become entangled in some of the biggest corruption scandals of our time.\n\n\"This should act as a wake-up call for government and regulators and deliver much-needed reforms to the UK's defences against dirty money.\"", "description": "The trail reaches as far as private schools and interior designers, says Transparency International.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/17179/production/_109358549_briefcasedollars.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
