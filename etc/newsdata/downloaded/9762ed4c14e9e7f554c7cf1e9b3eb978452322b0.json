(AP Photo/John Locher)\n\nThe No. 1 seed Washington Mystics will play in their second consecutive final after closing out the series, 3-1, against the Las Vegas Aces on Tuesday. The Mystics won a tightly contested 94-90 victory at Mandalay Bay Event Center and will host game 1 of the final back home in D.C. against the Connecticut Sun on Sunday.\n\nThe Mystics controlled the third quarter and held on late after the some back-and-forth play in the final 10 minutes. Their success from behind the arc allowed them to out-pace the Aces despite both sides hitting shots.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nEmma Meesseman hit the clutch 3-pointer, her fourth of four attempts, from the corner off an assist from Natasha Cloud with 29.2 seconds remaining to go up, 91-88, after Elena Delle Donne got the defensive rebound. It was the first points since Delle Donne and the Aces\u2019 Kelsey Plum hit baskets in front of the two-minute mark.\n\nMeesseman scored 22 points off the bench with three rebounds, three assists and three blocks, one of them a key shutdown of Aces center Liz Cambage late.\n\nShe went 3-for-3 from 3-point range within the first three minutes of the fourth quarter to give the Mystics a six-point lead, 78-72.\n\n\u201cEmma\u2019s been playing like an MVP,\u201d league MVP Delle Donne said on the ESPN2 post-game interview. \u201cEmma\u2019s one of the greatest in the world to play this game and boy, did she step up. She has ice in her veins.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nPlum made a layup to tighten the score, but Kristi Toliver, in her first start since Aug. 8, hit both free throws with 13.9 left to seal the win. She had 20 points\u2014 11 in the third quarter \u2014 with nine assists.\n\n\u26a1Kristi putting her body & soul into this game \u26a1 pic.twitter.com/rPVBjc5sb9 \u2014 Washington Mystics (@WashMystics) September 25, 2019\n\nThe Mystics played a cleaner game than in the third matchup of the series. They played better defense, moved the ball around and hit shots, going 47.4 percent from the floor and 43.3 percent from 3-point range.\n\nDelle Donne, who had a game-high 25 points with six rebounds and two steals, credited being able to find spacing with their big lineup in a halftime interview with ESPN2. Most importantly, they limited turnovers as they did in each of the first two games. In each of the Mystics\u2019 wins they had only six turnovers.\n\nThe Aces trailed nearly all of the third quarter until Dearica Hamby gave them the lead back, 66-65, with 1:14 remaining, capping eight consecutive points. The Mystics were marred by too many passes, lackluster defense and no effort on the glass as they lost their seven-point cushion.\n\nLas Vegas, fueled by a raucous crowd, led by as many as 10 points in the first half and tried to take the game late but were held just far enough away. Cambage, who made a statement while arriving at the arena, had another postseason double-double with 25 points and 12 rebounds. She missed early shots, though, and finished by hitting 10 of 22.\n\nUnlike in game 3, the Aces\u2019 lone win, her center-mate A\u2019ja Wilson didn\u2019t have a strong night. Wilson had four points, six rebounds and one assist.\n\nKelsey Plum had 17 points and five assists as the only other starter in double figures. Hamby had a double-double off the bench with 18 points and 11 rebounds alongside seven assists. Tamara Young had 11 points off the bench.\n\nThe Aces made it difficult early. They went on an 11-2 run in the middle of the first and took a 26-17 lead into the second quarter. The Mystics answered with a 16-4 run to close the second quarter ahead, 45-43. A Toliver 3-pointer out of the break gave the Mystics their largest lead of the game.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "The Mystics played a cleaner game 4 and limited turnovers to oust the Aces.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/bzM1uB_2UWgYoKVSFSBw_g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD05MjEuNg--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/wBURHGPLLGVy9jPi5EcfHA--~B/aD0xOTM5O3c9MjY5MztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/f0eaaa90-df41-11e9-b6ee-5debea51f1e4", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
