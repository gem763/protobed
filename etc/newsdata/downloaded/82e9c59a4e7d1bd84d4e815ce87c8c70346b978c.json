From its fashionable boutiques and crystal-clear waters to its catch-of-the-day fine-dining establishments, it wears its elitism with elan.\n\nWith an estimated population of only about 1,900, it is indeed a private paradise. For those who require a respite from its sedate style, civilization awaits in the Mallorca capital city of Palma.\n\nMore: A Stunningly Modern House in Mallorca\n\nBoundaries\n\nThe port of Andratx, which is shaped like a pointing finger, juts into the Balearic Sea off the same named shore, Andratx. The ancient town of Andratx is about three miles away on the southern side of the port. Carrer D\u2019Isaac Peral is on the southern border, Avinguda de Gabriel Roca Garcias is at the western border, Torrent des Salvel makes up the northern border, and Carrer Saulet is to the east.\n\n\n\nPrice Range\n\nIn Port Andratx, water views drive prices. According to Roddy Aris, a partner at Knight Frank, newly built or refurbished single-family villas that are sited to see the sea typically are priced at \u20ac7 million to \u20ac9 million (US$7.74 million to US$9.95 million), and those that are newly built or refurbished and that look toward land generally are \u20ac4 million to \u20ac6 million.\n\n\n\nChristine Glawar, Port Andratx office director for Mallorca Sotheby\u2019s International Realty, added that although villa prices can range from \u20ac2 million to \u20ac35 million, generally \u201c\u20ac2 million to \u20ac6 million will secure a great one.\u201d\n\nAlthough there are very few condos in Port Andratx, Mr. Aris noted that there are luxury developments, such as New Folies, which features detached villas with private pools, and Gran Folies, which has apartments. He said that in these luxury developments, three-bedroom units and detached villas sell for \u20ac1.9 million to \u20ac3.7 million.\n\nMore: A Converted Wine Warehouse in Barcelona\u2019s Poblenou Neighborhood\n\nTypically, Ms. Glawar said, the price range for apartments is \u20ac800,000 to \u20ac5 million.\n\nThis five-bedroom, four-bathroom villa, which has a garden, views of the sea and a swimming pool, is on the market for \u20ac16.9 million. Knight Frank\n\nHousing Stock\n\nThe central waterside area of the port is comprised of shops, restaurants, bars and supermarkets, while the residential properties surround it. In addition to housing in the center of town, the eastern section of the port, which includes the areas of Las Brisas and Mon Port, offers a wide selection of properties, ranging from big, modern and traditional Spanish villas to apartment complexes.\n\n\u201cSet in the hills, these properties in Las Brisas and Mon Port often offer a wonderful view of the bay and the port itself,\u201d Ms. Glawar said. \u201cMany residents keep their yachts a short walking distance away at the yacht club.\u201d\n\nShe added that virtually all of the villas, regardless of style, arecustom and that most of them are new.\n\nMore: A Villa on the Spanish Island of Ibiza With Six Private Acres\n\nListed for \u20ac15.9 million, this villa has five bedrooms, four bathrooms, a garden, a terrace and a swimming pool as well as sea and mountain views. Knight Frank\n\nMr. Aris said that modern is the most popular style. \u201cBut this doesn\u2019t mean minimalistic,\u201d he added. \u201cIt means great windows and sliding doors opening and integrating the outside areas.\u201d\n\nHe noted that such homes typically have interior walls and floors made of stone and wooden doors.\n\nMore: 14th-Century Spanish Estate, With a Chapel, Near Barcelona Heads to Auction\n\n\u201cThe properties that sell are normally no more than two years old,\u201d he added. \u201cBeyond that, it is very difficult to sell houses that are eight years old; they go mainly to investors who then refurbish them and put them on the market again.\u201d\n\nTypical amenities for villas and apartments include private or communal swimming pools as well as private parking.\n\n\u201cEven the most basic properties have air conditioning and under-floor heating,\u201d Ms. Glawar said.\n\nThis traditional five-bedroom, five-bathroom villa, which has sea views, is on the market for \u20ac6.25 million.

Mallorca Sotheby's International Realty\n\nWhat Makes It Unique\n\nPort Andratx, compact and chic, is a neighborhood made for walking and cycling, which is a wonderful way to enjoy its pristine beauty.\n\n\u201cIt faces the protected Tramuntana mountain range, which is a UNESCO Heritage Site,\u201d Mr. Aris said. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the most beautiful harbors in the world with a beautiful entrance and a still-thriving local fishing industry. Finally, the lack of sandy beaches has kept the Andratx region free from mass tourism.\u201d\n\nMs. Glawar said the combination of luxury shops, waterside dining, sea views and the luxury yachts in the harbor make it an appealing place.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a positive vibe between locals, visitors and residents that\u2019s unique in Mallorca,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a 20-minute drive from Mallorca\u2019s capital city, Palma, which was recently voted as the best city in the world to live in by readers of the U.K.\u2019s prestigious Sunday Times newspaper.\u201d\n\nFrom Penta: Global UHNW Population Flatlines, Combined Wealth Declines for the First Time in Three Years\n\nThis villa, listed for \u20ac9.8 million, offers views of the mountains and sea. It has five bedrooms, five bathrooms, a swimming pool and a garden. Knight Frank\n\nLuxury Amenities\n\nPort Andratx\u2019s fish restaurants are so renowned that they attract residents from Palma.\n\nNoting that all the fish restaurants are excellent, Mr. Aris said Toni El Gallego, which is next to the neighborhood\u2019s church, is his favorite.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a family business dating back 40 years,\u201d he said, adding that the arroz de bogavante (lobster and rice), and the gallo frito con cebolla (St. Peter\u2019s fish with onions) are among his favorite dishes.\n\nTim\u2019s Bar, which has been a waterfront institution since 1978, is where the locals and celebrities go for beer, wine and cocktails and to hang out. Ms. Glawar said that it\u2019s \u201cfamous on the island, and was where supermodel Claudia Schiffer was discovered.\u201d\n\nCappuccino Grand Caf\u00e9, which serves breakfast, lunch, dinner, dessert and cocktails, \u201coffers an informal experience,\u201d Ms. Glawar said.\n\nMore: New Development Sales Soar in Barcelona\n\nRocaMar is famous for its so-called Roclobster Casserole; Sumailla, a fine-dining establishment, serves Japanese-Peruvian cuisine; and the restaurant and bar Trespais is a master of Italian/Asian dishes.\n\nThe lounge/bar Romeo\u2019s is known for its roof-terrace, where diners and drinkers can watch the sunsets and for its national and international tapas.

We expect prices to continue rising in 2019, but we may see sales volumes weaken due to a degree of uncertainty in the run-up to the U.K.\u2019s exit from the European Union.\u201d\n\nThe report added that the scarcity of new residential construction is \u201cinsulating prices\u201d\u2014only 1,842 residential units were completed in the Balearic Islands in 2017, as opposed to the 12,162 of the previous decade. The report noted that a building license moratorium that was in place until November 2018 particularly impacted the South West market.\n\n\n\nClick for more profiles of high-end neighborhoods around the world\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["Nancy A.
