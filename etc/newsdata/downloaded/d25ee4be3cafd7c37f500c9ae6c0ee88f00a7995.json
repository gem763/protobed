Here are the updated betting lines from the Westgate in Las Vegas, per Jeff Sherman.\n\nNFL Super Bowl updated\n\n\n\nKC 5/1\n\nNE 6/1\n\nNO, Chi, Phi 12/1\n\nLAR, LAC 14/1\n\nPit, Cle 18/1\n\nMin, GB, Dal, Sea 20/1\n\nJax 25/1\n\nAtl 30/1\n\nBal, SF, Oak 40/1\n\nHou, Car 50/1\n\nNYJ 60/1\n\nInd, Ten, Den, Det 80/1\n\nTB, Buf 100/1\n\nNYG, Cin 200/1\n\nWsh, Ari 300/1\n\nMia 500/1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 Jeff Sherman (@golfodds) September 2, 2019\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThese lines aren't too surprising.\n\nThe Chiefs barely lost to the Patriots in last season's AFC Championship Game and made a few improvements to their roster over the offseason, including the addition of talented defensive end Frank Clark in a trade with the Seattle Seahawks. Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes is the reigning MVP and appears poised for another tremendous campaign. There's a lot to like about the Chiefs in regards to picking them to win the Super Bowl.\n\nIt's still hard to bet against the Patriots, though.\n\nStory continues\n\nYou could make a compelling case the Patriots will be even better than last season despite coming off a sixth Super Bowl championship. Demaryius Thomas and Josh Gordon, if healthy, could make the Patriots' wide receiver corps a much-improved unit compared to last season. Veteran defensive lineman Michael Bennett and rookie Chase Winovich should help improve New England's pass rush, which tied for the second-fewest sacks in the league in 2018. The running back group again is among the deepest and most talented in the league with the addition of rookie Damien Harris. Tom Brady also remains the starting quarterback in New England, and the last time we checked, he's still really good.\n\nThere aren't any other clear Super Bowl favorites besides the Patriots and Chiefs, but keep an eye on the New Orleans Saints. They got screwed by a horrendous blown call late in the NFC Championship Game last season and should be on a mission to return to that stage during the upcoming campaign. The Saints also are led by one of the league's best quarterbacks in Drew Brees and a smart, experienced head coach in Sean Payton. New Orleans has all the ingredients to challenge the Patriots and Chiefs for the Lombardi Trophy.\n\nClick here to download the new MyTeams App by NBC Sports!
