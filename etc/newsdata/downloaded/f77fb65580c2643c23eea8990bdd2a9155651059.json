As recounted in the biography of her parents, actress Fay Wray and screenwriter Robert Riskin, Victoria Riskin quotes from a letter her father, who heard the speech, sent to her mother: \u201c(Chaplin) plunged into a speech extolling the Russians \u2014 their ideology (by saying that if communism produces men of such heroic stature, he\u2019ll take communism, etc.). He resented the organized efforts for the last 20 years to present Russians as ogres both here and in England \u2014 and by God, if any man can\u2019t get along on $25,000 a year, he is a cockeyed liar and a traitor to his country.\u201d\n\nAccording to the website celebritynetworth.com. \u201cChaplin had a net worth equal to $400 million dollars at the time of his death in 1977 (after adjusting for inflation).\u201d Never mind.\n\nAt the latest Democratic presidential debate, millionaire Bernie Sanders and hedge fund billionaire Tom Steyer had an exchange that came from a question about Mr. Sanders saying billionaires should be taxed out of existence to help close the \u201cwealth gap.\u201d\n\nMr. Sanders responded by ticking off his familiar litany of misery \u2014 half a million people living on the streets (he didn\u2019t mention that many are in cities and states run by Democrats), the cost of education and student debt (he didn\u2019t mention the many options for receiving an education that would substantially reduce student debt), 87 million uninsured or underinsured (wasn\u2019t Obamacare supposed to fix that?), adding, \u201cyou also have three people owning more wealth than the bottom half of American society.\u201d\n\nMr. Sanders called that a \u201cmoral outrage,\u201d though on his moral scale, abortion-on-demand is not a problem.\n\nFor his part, Mr. Steyer sought some moral cover for his wealth, agreeing with Mr. Sanders and adding that corporations have \u201cbought this government for the last 40 years.\u201d Don\u2019t those four decades include the Clinton and Obama administrations? Mr. Steyer said he would undo every tax cut for rich people and wealthy corporations.\n\nWe\u2019ve heard it all before. The left would take from the prosperous and do what? Past welfare and redistribution programs haven\u2019t liberated the poor. If they had, there should be fewer poor people. Wasn\u2019t that the stated goal? Why didn\u2019t it happen? The reason is government is a bad charity.\n\nWhat astounds is that younger people who buy into the \u201cwealth gap\u201d nonsense (because that is what they have had drummed into them by teachers and Democratic politicians) have little understanding of economics. There is no fixed amount of money from which all must draw. If there were, it would be unfair for some to take (earn?) more than others. Wealth is a bottomless well. No one is destined to live permanently in the lower class.\n\nThe reason envy, greed and entitlement continue to surface in most election cycles is that it appeals to human emotions. Charging the rich with not paying their \u201cfair share\u201d in taxes is a distraction from the real issue: Government spends too much.\n\nIn the letter to his wife, Robert Riskin wrote, \u201cThe Charlie (Chaplin) you once knew has been buried with honors \u2014 and a new one has been born. Let\u2019s hope the new one has everlasting life \u2014 for he will cling to it as long as that political philosophy remains popular \u2026\u201d\n\nMr. Sanders and Mr. Steyer seem to believe the Chaplin philosophy remains popular among some voters. Don\u2019t include them, though, because they\u2019re rich and you won\u2019t see them sending a check to the Treasury.\n\n\u2022 Cal Thomas, a nationally syndicated columnist, is the author of \u201cAmerica\u2019s Expiration Date: The Fall of Empires, Superpowers and the United States\u201d (HarperCollins/Zondervan, January 2020).\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
