But sources said the attacks had significantly disrupted operations in the world\u2019s largest oil exporter.\n\nOne said they had shut down some five million barrels a day of crude production \u2013 almost half the kingdom\u2019s output and roughly five per cent of that of the world.\n\nIt is unclear how long the shutdown will last, but anything but the briefest disruption could have a serious impact on global energy supplies and prices.\n\nThe attacks on the two facilities also come as state oil giant Saudi Aramco prepares for an initial public offering, part of an attempt by Crown Prince Mohammed bin-Salman to reduce the country's economic reliance on the commodity.\n\nThe Abqaiq plant processes sour crude oil into sweet crude and transports it onto shipment points on the Persian Gulf and Red Sea. Estimates suggest it can process up to 7 million barrels of crude oil a day - equating to almost nine percent of the world's average daily production this year.\n\nIt is not the first time it has been targeted by militants: in 2006, Al-Qaida claimed a failed suicide bomb attack on the complex.\n\nThe Khurais oil field is the country's second largest and is believed to produce more than 1 million barrels of crude oil a day - 1.25 percent of the 2019 global supply.\n\nPrevious Houthi strikes against Saudi facilities - on Shaybah oilfield last month and two oil pumping stations in May - caused fires but did not disrupt production.\n\nMore than 90,000 people have died in Yemen's war and resulting famine, which began after the Houthi Shia rebels ousted the internationally-recognised government.\n\nSaudi Arabia, as well as other Gulf Arab nations, the UN and the West, say Iran is backing the Houthis with weapons and logistical support, a charge Tehran denies. The Houthis insist they are not Iranian puppets and are instead fighting a corrupt regime.\n\nThe Saudi-led coalition has been accused by UN investigators and human rights groups of violations that could amount to war crimes.", "description": "America has blamed Iran for the drone strikes on two Saudi Arabian oil installations including the world\u2019s largest processing facility.\u00a0 The attacks on the Abqaiq plant and Khurais oilfield were said to have cut the kingdom\u2019s output in half.\u00a0 Yemen's Huthi rebels, who are backed by Iran, had claimed", "authors": ["Hannah Strange"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Fa8Jz4OpeWnbCZSH1uLfZA--~B/aD0xNDA2O3c9MjI1MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_258/2514c944353465d367e5057821441981", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
