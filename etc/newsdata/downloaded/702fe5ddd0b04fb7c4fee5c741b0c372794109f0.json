Robert Biedron witnessed the accident and helped the father and child until rescue officials arrived.\n\nLocal firefighters tweeted a photo of themselves with Biedron, praising him and saying that \"like a real fireman he went to the burning car with a fire extinguisher.\"\n\nIt's not clear if the Biedron's heroics will help lift the fortunes of a left-wing alliance that his Spring party belongs to in parliamentary election on Sunday. The alliance is polling in third place.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
