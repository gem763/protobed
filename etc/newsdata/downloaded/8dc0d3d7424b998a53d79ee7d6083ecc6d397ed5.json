More than 40 states now use one or more of Amazon's election offerings, according to a presentation given by an Amazon executive this year and seen by Reuters.\n\nAmazon.com's cloud computing arm is making an aggressive push into one of the most sensitive technology sectors: U.S. elections.\n\nAmazon pitches itself as a low-cost provider of secure election technology at a time when local officials and political campaigns are under intense pressure to prevent a repeat of 2016 presidential elections, which saw cyberattacks on voting systems and election infrastructure.\n\n\"The fact that we have invested heavily in this area, it helps to attest to the fact that in over 40 states, the Amazon cloud is being trusted to power in some way, some aspect of elections,\" Michael Jackson, leader, Public Health & U.S. Elections at AWS, told prospective government clients in February via a presentation on a webinar, which was viewed by Reuters.\n\nThe company's efforts are welcomed by election administrators, who in interviews said they often struggle with keeping outdated systems up to date at the local level.\n\nIn Oregon, for example, the state's in-house servers that support election services shut down every time there is a power outage - an often occurrence as Oregon updates its electric grid, according to Peter Threlkel, chief information officer at the Oregon Secretary of State. A move to the cloud fixes that problem, and Oregon ran a pilot with AWS to move its voter registration system to the cloud, he said.\n\nSome security experts like David O'Berry, co-founder, Precog Security, said moving to AWS is \"a good option for campaigns, who do not have the resources to protect themselves.\"\n\nStill, Amazon's growing presence in the elections business could undermine what many officials view as a strength of the U.S. voting system: decentralization.\n\nMost security experts Reuters spoke to said that while Amazon's cloud is likely much harder to hack than systems it is replacing, putting data from many jurisdictions on a single system raises the prospect that a single major breach could prove damaging.\n\n\"It makes Amazon a bigger target\" for hackers, \"and also increases the challenge of dealing with an insider attack,\" said Chris Vickery, director of cyberrisk research at cybersecurity startup Upguard.\n\nA recent hack into Capital One Financial's data stored on Amazon's cloud service was perpetrated by a former Amazon employee. The breach affected more than 100 million customers, underscoring how rogue employees or untrained workers can create security risks even if the underlying systems are secure.\n\nAmazon says its systems are reliable. \"Over time, states, counties, cities, and countries will leverage AWS services to ensure modernization of their elections for increased security, reliability, and analytics for an efficient and more effective use of taxpayer dollars,\" an AWS spokesperson told Reuters.\n\nAmazon's push into the election business comes as the company faces criticism from politicians, labor unions and privacy advocates over its business practices and growing influence. President Donald Trump has accused the company of competing unfairly and repeatedly attacked the Washington Post, owned by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, for alleged bias, a charge Bezos and the paper deny.\n\nAmazon is forging ahead. It now powers the websites for the Federal Election Commission (FEC), the Republican National Committee (RNC) and the Democratic National Committee (DNC), according to a source and election security experts.\n\nThe FEC, DNC and RNC declined comment. A person familiar with the DNC's plans said the committee has recently moved some data from AWS to Alphabet-owned Google cloud but did not explain the reason for the shift.\n\nAmazon has also won over major individual candidates, the executive leading the company's election push said earlier this year.\n\n\"Some of the largest presidential, congressional and gubernatorial campaigns are also trusted to AWS,\" Amazon's Jackson told clients in the February webinar viewed by Reuters.\n\nFor example, Democratic Presidential frontrunner Joe Biden's online fundraising operations rely on AWS, a source with knowledge of the matter said. The Biden campaign did not respond to requests for comment. In the past, AWS powered the Obama for America campaign in 2012, the source added.\n\nReuters could not verify what cloud service the Trump campaign is using. It had no comment.\n\nThe privatization of voting infrastructure is part of a broader trend that has swept across nearly every aspect of government activities in America \u2014 from parking tickets to prisons \u2014 and continues under the Trump administration.\n\nMicrosoft's Azure, the biggest rival to AWS, has a sizeable government business and offers some election services but it has not focused on them and lags Amazon, according to companies that partner with both firms for government contracts. Microsoft declined to comment.\n\nAmazon is also competing with traditional election technology vendors including Elections Systems & Software (ES&S) and Dominion Voting Systems Corp, which offer some similar services such as election night reporting and data storage, according to consultants.\n\nAn ES&S spokeswoman said the company has not seen any impact from Amazon's efforts. Dominion did not respond to requests for comment.", "description": "Amazon describes itself as a low-cost provider of secure election technology.

While states like Oklahoma team up with an Amazon partner, and pays $26,000 for two services on Amazon's servers.", "authors": ["Taylor Locke"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/104873708-RTX3KM7J-aws.jpg?v=1571149763", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
