But if you're looking to try something a little different this season, why not consider adding a cropped \u2014 but still tailored \u2014 button-up or top into your new-season wardrobe rotation?\n\nAs high-waisted trousers and oversized blazers are trending, it makes sense that the proportions for the shirts and tops that we wear them with will also shift. And when a crop top is layered with the right partner pieces, you won't have to worry about baring skin (unless you want to!) \u2014 the focus is more on the novel silhouette and eliminating the need to tuck your top in, which can be difficult to do nicely with the oversized, loose-cut styles that are popular these days.\n\nBonus: The best of these tailored, cropped tops transition effortlessly from the office to the weekend. Just swap out your boxy jackets and dress pants out for high-rise jeans or a fitted pencil skirt and heels.\n\nHere are five work-ready crop tops, and what to wear with them:\n\nBoxy shirt + fitted dress\n\nOf course you can wear this tailored, button-up cotton shirt by Canadian label Oak + Fort with dress pants or a pretty pleated skirt, but its boxy cut and cropped length would also look amazing worn over your favourite slip dress or fitted jersey dress. Add a cute pair of heels and you're all set.\n\nBlouse K008, $88, Oak + Fort\n\nDress 2651, $78 (on sale for $38), Oak + Fort\n\nWrap blouse + dress pants\n\nWrap blouses that tie up at the waist are the perfect pairing for the season's high-rise trousers; they also look great under a hip-length blazer or oversized jacket for the office. This animal-print one from Addition Elle is available in sizes X to 4X.\n\nCropped Wrap Blouse, $49, Addition Elle\n\nPetite High Waist Tapered Pant, $59, Addition Elle\n\nPuff sleeve shirt + pencil skirt\n\nThis crisp white button-up is an easy, fresh way to wear the puff-sleeve trend for everyday. The cotton-blend fabric offers a bit of stretch, and the poufy sleeves have elasticized cuffs. Because of the sleeves, you won't be able to wear a jacket or coat on top of this blouse, but it's the perfect update to any midi- or knee-length pencil skirt in your closet.\n\nCropped Poplin Blouse, $49.90, Zara\n\nDraped Skirt, $39.90, Zara\n\nDouble-breasted blouse + high-rise jeans\n\nYou won't need to wear a jacket with this patterned blouse by Twik, which is available in two punchy prints. The cut is boxy and resembles a cropped jacket, but it's made in a lightweight recycled-polyester fabric. Style it with a pair of ballet flats and dark, straight-cut jeans with a medium or high rise for a comfortable, chic look.\n\nTwik Double-Breasted Blouse, $49, Simons\n\nMavi Black Kendra Straight High-Rise Jean, $98, Simons\n\nPullover sweater + slip skirt\n\nA casual knit that's cropped might just be the perfect way to transition that ubiquitous animal-print slip skirt many of us already have in our wardrobes into fall. You can always layer a tailored jacket on top, or add an oversized moto jacket or sleek puffer for Casual Fridays.\n\nBig Sur Ribbed Pullover Sweater, $64, Urban Outfitters\n\nRowan Satin Slip Skirt, $72, Urban Outfitters\n\nTruc Nguyen is a Toronto-based writer, editor and stylist.
