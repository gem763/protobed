A department spokesman didn\u2019t respond to an email and a phone message.\n\nThe lawsuit calls Waites an \u201cout-of-control public servant\u201d who has used his position to \u201cviolate the rights of innocent citizens for reasons that have more to do with securing publicity and money for his office than with enforcing the law.\u201d\n\nWaites targeted Todd Chrisley\u2019s estranged daughter, Lindsie Chrisley Campbell, and improperly shared confidential tax information to try to get compromising information on the family, the lawsuit alleges. As a result of his efforts, which ultimately failed, the Chrisleys were forced to \u201cincur substantial personal and financial hardship,\u201d the suit says.\n\nThe lawsuit asks for a jury trial and seeks compensatory and punitive damages, as well as reimbursement for legal costs.\n\nThe Chrisleys last month reached an agreement to settle allegations that they failed to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in state income taxes. The agreement credited them with tax refunds for some tax years and said they owed nothing in others. According to the settlement, the Chrisleys agreed to pay a little under $150,000 to resolve the claims.\n\nSeparately, the Chrisleys were indicted in August on federal charges of tax evasion, conspiracy, bank fraud and wire fraud. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\n\u201cChrisley Knows Best\u201d follows the tightknit, boisterous family living in Nashville. Much of the series emphasizes Todd Chrisley\u2019s obsessive yet comedic efforts to keep tabs on three of his kids, two of whom are in their 20s, and his mother. The family moved to Tennessee from the Atlanta area a few years ago.\n\nThe series has aired on USA for seven seasons and recently premiered a spinoff called \u201cGrowing Up Chrisley,\u201d featuring his kids Chase and Savannah, who move to Los Angeles. Todd Chrisley also briefly hosted a talk show, \u201cAccording to Chrisley,\u201d for the network. Todd, 51, and Julie Chrisley, 46, also have a podcast called \u201cChrisley Confessions.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Reality television personalities Todd and Julie Chrisley on Tuesday accused a Georgia tax official of abusing his office to pursue \"bogus tax evasion claims\" against them.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Kate Brumback"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/15/people-todd_chrisley-lawsuit_39432_c0-379-3420-2374_s1200x700.jpg?20acebc313aa172fb671fb3158a4e2147319cf57", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
