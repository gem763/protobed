Recently, earth-like planets with the possibility to host life have been discovered.\u201d\n\nQueloz didn\u2019t know exactly what he\u2019d found at first.\n\n\u201cAt the time I didn\u2019t think at all it was a planet,\u201d Queloz said.\n\nMayor was born in Switzerland and teaches at the University Geneva. Queloz was also born in Switzerland and is a professor at the University of Geneva and the University of Cambridge.", "description": "Oct. 8 (UPI) \u2014 The Nobel Prize in Physics for 2019 on Tuesday was awarded to three scientists for their focus on the cosmos and the discovery of a", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
