The iconic Canadian retail chain has stores in historic buildings in the heart of downtown shopping districts across North America.\n\nThe group led by Baker that is proposing to privatize Hudson\u2019s Bay owns about 45 per cent of HBC\u2019s issued and outstanding common shares. A majority of the remaining issued and outstanding common shares would be needed to vote down the privatization proposal. The Baker group has a majority stake in HBC on a fully diluted basis, which includes convertible preferred shares.\n\nThe letter from Paradise Developments says the investment and development firm believes HBC is worth \u201ca significant premium\u201d to what the Baker group has offered, and urges the special committee to direct its advisors J.P. Morgan Securities and Centerview Partners LLC to prepare or obtain an appraisal of the real estate owned by the company.\n\nThe letter also urges the committee to ensure that the advisors\u2019 valuation of the company \u201cincorporates the imminent and material value and benefits which can be realized through development, joint ventures and potential spin-off of the real estate assets \u2026 whereby ALL shareholders can realize the maximum value they are entitled to.\u201d\n\nIf we are to be deprived of the opportunity to participate in this upside due a takeover of the company, then we, and indeed all minority shareholders, have a right to be adequately compensated\u2026 Paradise Developments' letter to the special committee\n\nIn August, Litt\u2019s Land & Buildings published an open letter to shareholders calling the price tag attached to HBC shares by the Baker-led buyout group \u201cwoefully inadequate.\u201d\n\nPrivate equity firm Catalyst Capital, meanwhile, disclosed in August that it had acquired more than 18 million shares in HBC for an average price of $10.11. A September regulatory filing revealed Catalyst had accumulated a stake just shy of 16 per cent of HBC\u2019s common shares.\n\nIn public statements, Catalyst has said the firm is committed to working with the special committee and HBC\u2019s board, but is pushing the firm \u201cto seek out every alternative that can maximize value for all shareholders, whether through a sale process, dividend distributions of the cash to be realized from the sale of the company\u2019s key European assets or otherwise.\u201d\n\nLitt\u2019s group has been more forceful, calling for Baker\u2019s removal from the board over the privatization proposal.\n\nA spokesperson for Baker\u2019s group declined to comment on the letter sent to the special committee by Paradise Developments.\n\nA representative of Sard Verbinnen & Co., the New York-based public relations firm representing HBC\u2019s special committee, also declined to comment.", "description": "Paradise Developments: 'Offer doesn\u2019t come close to cover the value of HBC\u2019s real estate and any of its upside potential'", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/hudson_s_bay-2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
