It\u2019s a disgrace. I\u2019m glad it\u2019s over.\u201d\n\nAfter framing the question for journalists, Taylor refused to answer it or elaborate. However, some of Craig\u2019s friends were more direct in arguing that political considerations may have led the Justice Department to bring a case it wound up losing.\n\n\u201cThis was in the hands of political people,\u201d said longtime Craig friend Stuart Taylor Jr., an author, attorney and former New York Times reporter. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of politics going on at the Justice Department these days. That might well be a part of it.\u201d\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

Following a not-guilty verdict, federal prosecutors typically say little or nothing, in accordance with Justice Department policies.\n\nThe case against Craig did suffer from obvious weaknesses, like a lack of any written record of a key Oct. 9, 2013, meeting at which, prosecutors said, Craig lied to or misled members of Justice\u2019s Foreign Agent Registration Act unit about his work.\n\nThe prosecution called to the stand three eyewitnesses \u2014 the unit\u2019s top lawyer at the time, Heather Hunt, and two members of Craig\u2019s law firm, Lawrence Spiegel and Kenneth Gross.\n\nNone was able to recite any specific words said at the session and at least part of Gross\u2019s testimony was helpful to the defendant. Craig also took the stand in his own defense and said he did not lie to or mislead anyone during the meeting.\n\nThe defense also called four character witnesses for Craig, who portrayed him as almost saintly in his devotion to honesty and the highest standards of the legal profession. And U.S. District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson gave jurors an instruction that character alone could be sufficient to acquit Craig by creating a reasonable doubt about whether he would have intentionally broken the law.\n\nHowever, jurors who spoke to reporters after the verdict was returned Wednesday afternoon indicated that it was a closer call for Craig than the outrage mustered by the defense might suggest.\n\nTwo men who served on the jury said the relatively quick acquittal was triggered by a technical legal issue: a statute of limitations-related time frame that said Craig could be convicted only if he took an affirmative step to mislead the government after Oct. 3, 2013.\n\nThe timeline put the focus on the hazily recalled meeting and a letter Craig sent a couple of days later addressing some of the issues discussed at the session. Prosecutors said at least one statement in the letter was an outright lie and another was, at best, seriously misleading.\n\nBut jurors said they didn\u2019t feel comfortable convicting Craig on those statements.\n\n\u201cThere was a lot of very clever wording, but we just did not see it as enough to find him guilty,\u201d Wilson said.\n\n\u201cIt was done in a very narrow, lawyerly way,\u201d said another juror, Michael Meyer, 60.\n\nWilson said, though, that he and others on the jury did believe Craig had lied to FARA personnel, just not in the window where they could convict him.\n\n\u201cI think that he walked up very close to the line. I was not of the opinion Greg Craig was a bad person, but he walked right up to the line and very well could have crossed it,\u201d the juror said. \u201cWe think the evidence proved that he did lie prior to Oct. 3,\u201d Wilson said, adding later that he believed some jurors agreed with that statement, but probably not all.\n\nBeyond politics, there are other explanations for why prosecutors charged Craig, even though they likely realized it was a difficult case.\n\nThe charge against Craig stemmed from a report he and his then law firm, Skadden Arps, prepared for Ukraine\u2019s government in 2012 about the controversial prosecution of former Ukrainian prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko.\n\nAnother Skadden lawyer who worked on the report and was far junior to Craig, Alex van der Zwaan, pleaded guilty in February 2018 to lying to Mueller\u2019s team about his work on the Ukraine project Craig headed up. The Dutch-born van der Zwaan admitted to a felony false-statement charge that might have ended his legal career. He also was sentenced to and served 30 days in prison before being deported.\n\nVan der Zwaan\u2019s attorneys said he lied because he didn\u2019t want to lose his job at Skadden by acknowledging that he defied Craig by sharing a copy of his report with a public relations specialist for Ukraine.\n\nProsecutors may have believed it was unfair to have sought and obtained a felony conviction for van der Zwaan, then 33, while overlooking what Justice Department officials viewed as lies by Craig about the very same project.\n\nOne question that loomed if Craig were convicted was whether the judge might give him at least a short prison sentence in order to avoid an unseemly disparity with the sentence imposed on van der Zwaan.\n\nThe prosecution of Craig also arguably advanced an effort politicians in both parties have supported to step up enforcement of the Foreign Agents Registration Act. However, Craig wasn\u2019t charged directly with failing to register and a judge dropped a second charge Craig faced of making a false FARA submission because it wasn\u2019t clear whether the law applies to letters arguing against having to register.\n\nOf course, the political door swings both ways, and it is possible that politics also colored the jury\u2019s verdict. Jurors were not asked about their political views, but they were all residents of Washington, D.C., a city that votes overwhelmingly for Democrats.\n\nSeveral jurors said they were closely following Mueller\u2019s work and had a very unfavorable view of Paul Manafort, the former Trump campaign chairman, who also helped commission, fund and publicize the report Craig prepared back in 2012.\n\nWhile there seemed a serious risk that jurors would be suspicious of Craig\u2019s decision to work with Manafort, Craig\u2019s defense did not seem to strike the Mueller fans or Manafort haters from the jury. That might have been a smart move.\n\nOne of the jurors who spoke to reporters Wednesday said he viewed the Craig case as a waste of resources that overlooked more significant dangers.\n\n\u201cWhat infuriates me about this whole case \u2026 is that the special counsel wasted so much time on an issue like this one when the republic itself was under assault. \u2026 I was deeply offended personally by this case,\u201d Meyer added, before questioning why Mueller had charged no one for colluding with Russia.\n\nMeyer also said he and some other jurors did not hold it against Craig that he found himself working hand-in-hand for a time with a figure like Manafort.\n\n\u201cA number of the older jurors understood life is a complicated thing,\u201d Meyer said.\n\n", "description": "His defense attorney asked \"why the Department of Justice brought this case against an innocent man in the first place.\"", "authors": ["Josh Gerstein"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/fe/61/a766a913438e938d561059bb11e6/190522-greg-craig-gty-773.jpg"}
