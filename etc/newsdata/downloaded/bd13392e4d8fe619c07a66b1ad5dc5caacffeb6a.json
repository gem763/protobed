I\u2019ll give him that much credit. But the execution of this action goes to the men and women of the special forces who just did an extraordinary job and have rid the world of someone who was the leader of a terrorist movement for which we still, however, have a challenge. This is my one concern. The president likes to say, mission accomplished far too quickly and far too easily.\u201d\n\nMenendez also stated that President Trump\u2019s attacks on the intelligence community weaken it and praised U.S. intelligence for the work they did in making the Baghdadi raid possible.\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett", "description": "On Monday's broadcast of CNN's \"Situation Room,\" Senate Foreign Affairs Committee Ranking Member Robert Menendez (D-NJ) stated that President Trump does | Clips", "authors": ["Ian Hanchett"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/03/Sen.-Bob-Menendez.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
