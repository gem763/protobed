Through her lawyers, Sacoolas has said she is \"devastated\" and is willing to meet Dunn's family.\n\nDunn's parents said Trump had been responsive at their meeting but the planned encounter with Sacoolas had come as a bombshell.\n\n\"He said he was sorry about Harry and then he sprung the surprise that Mrs Sacoolas was in another room in the building and whether we want to meet her there and then,\" Tim Dunn said.\n\n\"We said no because as we've been saying from the start we want to meet Mrs Sacoolas but we want to do it in the UK so the police can interview her. We didn't want to be sort of railroaded, not into a circus as such, but a meeting we weren't prepared for.\"\n\nWhile Trump and O'Brien had ruled out Sacoolas returning to Britain, Charles said Trump had taken her hand and promised to try to look at the issue from another angle. Stephens said that offer had left open the opportunity for a political solution.\n\n\"We have said for a long time the family needs to meet, they need to meet in private, away from the media and not curated by politicians, spies or indeed lawyers,\" he said.\n\n\"Most sensible folk and not a nincompoop in a hurry would understand that.\"\n\n(This story corrects days of the week in paragraphs 2 and 4)\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Michael Holden; Editing by Toby Chopra)", "description": "Donald Trump's national security adviser heaped pain and grief on the parents of a British teenager killed in a car crash by trying to hold a meeting at the White House between them and a U.S. diplomat's wife who was involved, the parents' lawyer said.
