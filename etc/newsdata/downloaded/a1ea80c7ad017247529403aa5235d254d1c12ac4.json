As soon as we have the visas available officers from Northamptonshire police will be travelling to the United States.\u201d\n\nPolice would still not be naming her because she had not yet given a full account of what happened with the collision, he said.\n\nDunn was riding his motorcycle along a roadway in the village of Croughton, England, on the night of Aug. 27, when a car traveling in the opposite direction on the wrong side of the road hit him head-on. The teen was taken to a hospital in the nearby city of Oxford, where he died soon after, according to Northamptonshire Police.\n\nThe crash occurred less than a mile down the road from Royal Air Force Croughton, commonly known as RAF Croughton, which is a British military station that houses an intelligence-gathering base operated by the United States Air Force. Sacoolas, whose husband is a U.S. diplomat assigned to the United Kingdom, is believed to have been the one driving the car.\n\nEduardo Munoz/Reuters\n\nNorthamptonshire Police are treating Sacoolas as a suspect in the fatal crash investigation, although they have not officially named her.\n\nSacoolas fled the United Kingdom after apparently claiming diplomatic immunity, which protects diplomats and their family members from prosecution or lawsuits under the host nation's laws. Dunn's family have repeatedly called on Sacoolas to come back to the U.K. to face the investigation.\n\nTrump himself spoke out about the incident, describing it as a \u201cterrible accident\u201d while conceding it was a \u201cvery complex issue\u201d due to Sacoolas\u2019 claim of diplomatic immunity earlier this month.\n\nThe British Foreign Secretary, Dominic Raab, has said that Sacoolas is no longer covered by diplomatic immunity since she fled the country.\n\n\"We have pressed strongly for a waiver of immunity, so that justice can be done in Harry's case,\" Raab wrote in a letter to Dunn\u2019s parents seen by ABC News early October. \"Whilst the U.S. government has steadfastly declined to give that waiver, that is not the end of the matter.\"\n\nBut in the press conference Tuesday, which Adderley described as \u201cfairly unprecedented\u201d at this stage in an investigation, police said their sole aim was to make sure justice was done, despite the diplomatic furor that was prompted by the incident, which has seen Dunn\u2019s parents personally speak to President Trump.\n\n\u201cForget the immunity, from the police\u2019s point of view we have to make sure we maintain the integrity of all the evidence,\u201d he said. \u201cShould we get to the point of extradition we want to insure she has a fair trial.\u201d\n\nSacoolas being in the U.S. \u201cfrustrates the investigation, but does not stop it,\u201d he added.\n\nThe diplomat's wife has issued a written apology to Dunn's family, which his mother, Charlotte Charles, described as \"not strong enough.\"\n\n\"I think she needs to just face what she's done,\" Charles told ABC News in October. \"We're a normal family and we're not out for revenge.\"", "description": "In a press conference, UK Police said they will travel to the US to interview Anne Sacoolas in Harry Dunn collision case.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/BRITAIN-USA-CRASH-PARENTS-HAWORTH_hpMain_20191022-062313_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
