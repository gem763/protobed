Get them off our kids, get them off our streets, get them off our island.\u201d\n\nRobinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, praised Charlton at the same rally while giving a speech standing next to him, as the crowd shouted \u201cf*** Islam\u201d.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have heard of this campaign if it wasn\u2019t for Billy,\u201d he said. \u201cThat battle has to be fought through every avenue.\u201d\n\nIn another speech in May 2017, Charlton claimed there was an \u201cepidemic\u201d of sex abuse by migrants in Sunderland, telling crowds: \u201cImmigrants are drugging our women, kidnapping, beating them and raping them.\u201d\n\nHis tirades were widely streamed on Facebook, YouTube and other platforms, while some were included in videos by Robinson\u2019s former employer Rebel Media.\n\nJudge Edward Bindloss told Charlton: \u201cYou have been revealed as an intelligent, articulate, skilled public speaker, but also a manipulative bully in my judgment.\n\n\u201cYou propelled the [justice campaign over the alleged rape] with rhetoric and misrepresentations, and the jury have found an agenda of racist hatred.\u201d\n\nThe prosecution said the defendant equated immigrants with rapists and wanted his audience to do the same.\n\nThe court heard that Charlton met with a police superintendent who tried to tell him that claims over the woman being raped in Sunderland were not borne out by evidence. The officer said Charlton was \u201caggressive from the outset\u201d and was set in his views.\n\nJudge Bindloss said Charlton\u2019s criticism of the police, even though he knew they had thoroughly investigated the woman\u2019s claims, reduced the public\u2019s confidence and would deter victims from coming forward.\n\n\u201cYou are not on trial for your political views or being a member of any party, or for anti-immigration views \u2013 you are entitled to hold them,\u201d he added. \u201cThis is a trial about racial hatred. The jury has found your speeches were intended to, or likely to, stir up racial hatred.\u201d\n\nThe court heard that during the period when protests were happening, two innocent Asian men were attacked by white men, an Asian family had a brick thrown through their window with a note reading \u201cEDL [English Defence League] forever\u201d and racist graffiti appeared in the area.\n\nCharlton, of Byland Court in Washington, had denied inciting racial hatred or being racist during his three-and-a-half week trial.\n\nGlenn Gatland, defending, said his client had become frustrated by what he saw as police failures in that case. He said Charlton did not incite violence and had urged the watching crowd to leave peacefully.\n\nCharlton\u2019s protests sparked interest by prominent far-right figures, including Britain First\u2019s Paul Golding and former deputy leader Jayda Fransen.\n\nEmails were sent to Robinson\u2019s supporters calling for them to join demonstrations, including one that was screengrabbed by the Finsbury Park terrorist Darren Osborne.\n\nCharlton was previously fined for racially aggravated harassment in 2007 and led the Sunderland Defence League group.\n\nIn 2015, he spoke at a \u201cwhite man march\u201d protest in Newcastle that included the neo-Nazi terrorist group National Action.\n\nNorthumbria Police said Charlton had attempted to disguise his attacks on ethnic minorities and immigrants under a \u201ccloak of respectability\u201d by claiming to defend women.\n\nChief Inspector Sam Rennison said his actions were an attempt to fuel \u201chatred and unrest\u201d Sunderland.\n\n\u201cFreedom of speech is an important element of modern society which we all advocate, but spreading hate and racism is totally unacceptable,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cCharlton knowingly targeted a number of ethnic groups and immigrants at high-profile marches in the city centre, and in doing so, stirred up hatred.\n\n\u201cHe then pushed that personal agenda further by circulating misinformation on social media for his own gain.\n\n\u201cHowever, today his calculated behaviour and attempts to spread hatred and unrest in our community have been laid bare.\n\n\u201cWe must do all we can to stamp out racism and the spreading of hate.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by PA", "description": "A far-right activist\u00a0and Brexit supporter has been jailed for inciting racial hatred at a series of marches where he branded immigrants and refugees as rapists.", "authors": ["Lizzie Dearden"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/27/15/charlton-william.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
