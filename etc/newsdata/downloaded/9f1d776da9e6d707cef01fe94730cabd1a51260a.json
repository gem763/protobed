He ran 16 times (including two kneel-downs at the end), juking and twisting past defenders for key gains - especially when the Cardinals were dropping back on passing situations.\n\nThe 2016 Heisman Trophy winner outdid the 2018 Heisman winner, Arizona rookie quarterback Kyler Murray, who went 25 for 40 for 349 yards but fell short of carrying the Cardinals to a second straight fourth-quarter comeback.\n\nMurray guided Arizona (0-1-1) on a four-play, 79-yard touchdown drive to make it 20-17 with 12:52 remaining. One week earlier, the former Oklahoma standout erased an 18-point deficit to salvage a tie against Detroit.\n\nOn this occasion, Jackson was just too good. He threw for 26 yards and ran for 10 in a 42-yard march that ended with a field goal for a six-point cushion, then peeled off a 14-yard run in a drive that enabled the Ravens (2-0) to stick Arizona on its 9-yard line with 3:48 remaining.\n\nAfter the Cardinals punted, Jackson sealed the victory with a 41-yard completion to rookie Marquise Brown on a third-and-11.\n\nJackson\u2019s favorite target was tight end Mark Andrews, who had eight receptions for 112 yards and a TD.\n\nThe Ravens opened in impressive fashion, moving 94 yards behind the feet and right arm of Jackson. He ran for 19 yards and went 5 for 5 for 74 yards, including three completions to Brown and a 27-yard touchdown pass to Andrews.\n\nIt was 10-6 before Jackson directed an 85-yard drive in which he carried four times for 30 yards and completed four passes for 55 yards, the final toss a 1-yard TD pass to tight end Hayden Hurst.\n\nThat gave Jackson seven touchdown passes, a new single-season career high. He threw six TD passes in seven starts last season.\n\nArizona closed to 17-9 in the third quarter, but it was the third time the Cardinals got inside the Baltimore 5 and had to settle for a field goal.\n\nSUGGS SACKLESS\n\nIn his return to Baltimore, Terrell Suggs was held without a sack. He played 16 years with the Ravens and became the franchise leader in career sacks before signing with the Cardinals as a free agent during the offseason.\n\nINJURIES\n\nCardinals: RB David Johnson left in the first quarter with a wrist injury and returned shortly before halftime. He scored Arizona\u2019s lone TD. \u2026 LG Justin Pugh played through an illness after being added to the injury report before the game.\n\nRavens: S Brynden Trawick hurt his left arm while on the punt return team.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nCardinals: Host winless Carolina, which will have some extra rest after losing to Tampa Bay on Thursday night.\n\nRavens: Travel to Kansas City for rematch of last December\u2019s thriller, won by the Chiefs 27-24 in OT, Baltimore\u2019s lone loss over the final seven regular-season games.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Jackson threw for 272 yards and two touchdowns, ran for 120 yards and helped the Ravens beat the Cardinals 23-17 Sunday in a showdown between two of the league's most exciting young quarterbacks.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "David Ginsburg"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/15/cardinals_ravens_football_10618_c0-0-3750-2186_s1770x1032.jpg?7fd60d6e2522df2aa0753c97287ecd588219cb2e", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
