Buena Vista Pictures Distribution, Inc\n\n\u201cI just got out of the Mandalorian press screening and gotta say, really surpassed expectations,\u201d wrote Indiewire critic Tyler Hersko. \u201cThis seems like a truly high-budget, movie-like project. If other flagship Disney+ series have a similar production quality, the streaming service will definitely have a strong run.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very cool and atmospheric,\u201d tweeted Get Fandom critic Eric Goldman, \u201csometimes evoking the vibe of Rogue One (which I adore). The title character is instantly fascinating and there are great action and suspense moments, including some Predator vibes.\u201d\n\nScreen Rant features editor Mansoor Mithaiwala tweeted: \u201cSaw almost 30 minutes of The Mandalorian footage this morning. It\u2019s truly incredible. It looks like the films, feels innately Star Wars, introduces new concepts, and adds layers that people have been waiting to see for a long time.\u201d\n\nProduced by filmmaker Jon Favreau, The Mandalorian takes place five years after the events of Return of the Jedi, and stars Pedro Pascal as the bounty hunter of the title.\n\nWerner Herzog, Gina Carano, Carl Weathers and Nick Nolte are among the show\u2019s supporting cast, while Taika Waititi, Rick Famuyiwa and Bryce Dallas Howard have directed individual episodes.\n\nThe Mandalorian will be released weekly on Disney+ from 12 November. A UK launch for the new streaming service remains unannounced.", "description": "The first critical reactions to forthcoming Star Wars series The Mandalorian are in, with audiences teasing a \u201ctruly incredible\u201d and \u201ccompletely amazing\u201d TV show.
