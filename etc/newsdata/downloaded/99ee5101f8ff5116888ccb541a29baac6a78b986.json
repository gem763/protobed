I am one of the Woodford savers myself and the truth is we have all been mugged.\n\nPrincipally, of course, we have been let down by Woodford. Though he was once considered one of the City\u2019s top stockpickers, in search of quick and unachievable returns he began to behave like a deranged gambler with his investors\u2019 money, piling it into unquoted shares in untested companies that he clearly didn\u2019t understand.\n\nBut the crisis is not down to the shaven-headed, showjumping fan\u2019s behaviour alone.\n\nBlame must also fall heavily on his biggest backer and promoter, Bristol-based investment supermarket and stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown, which directed a quarter of all its 1.2 million customers into Woodford funds through fulsome, uncritical promotions.\n\nDisastrous\n\nThen there is City regulator the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and its ambitious chief executive Andrew Bailey, whose disastrous supervision of Woodford\u2019s flagship Equity Income Fund and failure to act earlier were shameful.\n\nBailey had hopes of becoming the next Governor of the Bank of England at the end of this year, but those ambitions will now be subsumed by a flood of recriminations.\n\nThe FCA\u2019s inaction through six months of terrible uncertainty for investors \u2014 whose money, or what is left of it, could now be locked up for years \u2014 was shocking.\n\nI am one of the Woodford savers myself and the truth is we have all been mugged\n\nTrue, the authority urged that the rapacious Woodford \u2014 who made \u00a363 million for himself over the past decade \u2014 should waive the management fees he was charging investors after his fund hit trouble. But at no stage did it try to force his hand.\n\nInvestment funds are meant to be designed to protect investors. Fund managers actively manage the investments, spreading risk across a range of stocks and shares, and are paid handsomely to produce superior returns.\n\nMost funds are \u2018open-ended\u2019, which means savers can withdraw cash just by using a bank ATM. This requires the people managing the funds to keep some holdings in cash to meet immediate needs, and for other investments to be easily realised or liquid.\n\nEvery one of these supposedly failsafe mechanisms malfunctioned in the Woodford empire. As a consequence, the credibility of the whole system has been placed in jeopardy.\n\nThe decline of Woodford\u2019s fund has been dramatic. At its peak, its value was \u00a315 billion and it held underlying assets of \u00a310.2 billion. But in June it was suspended after investors clamoured to withdraw their cash after a run of poor performance. Since then its value has plummeted to just \u00a32.9 billion.\n\nOver recent weeks, Woodford has tried desperately to sell off illiquid assets and less desirable shares, replacing them with blue-chip investments such as BT and British American Tobacco. He failed miserably to restore confidence.\n\nThroughout this calamitous affair there has been a total absence of proper communication with investors. Woodford has made no public appearances and talks to his investors only through anodyne messages on his website.\n\nWhen the denouement came this week, it was the administrators of the Woodford funds \u2014 Link Fund Solutions \u2014 who used Woodford\u2019s website to announce that he had been fired from his own fund, that the flagship investment outfit would be liquidated and that vulnerable investors would have to wait for their money.\n\nShockingly absent in this rickety chain of command \u2014 from Woodford himself, Hargreaves and now Link \u2014 has been any sensitivity to or even awareness of the personal anxiety and suffering this has caused vulnerable investors.\n\nMany of those who put money through Hargreaves into Woodford funds, both directly and indirectly, are older people who invested savings liberated by former Chancellor George Osborne\u2019s pension freedoms.\n\nTheir nest eggs will have shrunk and are currently beyond their reach \u2014 Link has only said investors will get their cash \u2018at the earliest opportunity\u2019, although it was unable to say how much of their original investment would be salvaged.\n\nSo bills will remain unpaid, holidays postponed and funds to support house purchases for children will no longer be available, despite the pledge that they would always be open.\n\nThis tawdry affair undermines trust in all those who manage our investments and makes us question their motives, skills and morality.\n\nPoisonous\n\nWoodford\u2019s decision to continue to charge management fees, enriching himself by a further \u00a38.8 million even as investors could no longer withdraw funds, has been as poisonous to the savings industry as anything in recent decades.\n\nThe fissures in Woodford\u2019s investment empire first came to notice in June, when Kent County Council sought to pull out \u00a3238 million from the Equity Income Fund. There was not enough cash in the fund and it was temporarily closed. No one envisaged at the time that this closure would be permanent or that Woodford, after three decades of being lauded in the City, would become a pariah.\n\nPersonally, I feel distraught and humiliated. As someone who should have known better, I allowed myself to be seduced by the Woodford mythology.\n\nHis history of great returns at his previous employer, Invesco Perpetual, led me to believe he was something special, and I liked the way he rallied to the cause of defending great British companies. The heavy backing for his funds by Hargreaves also gave me confidence in his abilities. Now I find myself nursing thousands of pounds of losses.\n\nNot only did I put money into his Equity Income Fund, I also invested in the publicly quoted Patient Capital Trust, which has plunged 40 per cent in value and trades at a huge discount to underlying assets.\n\nPlunge\n\nI have since learned that the Patient Capital Trust was riddled with potential conflicts of interest when it was meant to be backing brilliant start-up companies. Some of the directors were executives of biotech and other firms in which Patient Capital invested.\n\nEven more naively, I encouraged one of my sons to put a small legacy from his grandfather, who died 18 months ago, into the Woodford fund.\n\nIt was his first stock market investment and he would check the value of his portfolio on a daily if not hourly basis on the easy-to-access Hargreaves Lansdown platform.\n\nHe saw his Woodford holding plunge in value, then become frozen. It is likely to put him off saving for the rest of his life.\n\nYet while he and thousands of others suffered, all those in the Woodford support structure have walked away rich. His main cheerleader, Hargreaves Lansdown\u2019s soon-to-retire research director Mark Dampier, along with Dampier\u2019s family, cashed in \u00a36 million of shares in Hargreaves just days before the Woodford fund was suspended.\n\nThis is the biggest shock to the savings industry since more than a decade ago when New Star, a group of funds run by another leading investor, John Duffield, were liquidated.\n\nProtections built into the financial system since then, including the creation of the FCA, were meant to prevent such disasters. Yet the system has failed again, and once more it is the small private investor who will pay the heaviest price.", "description": "ALEX BRUMMER: Hundreds of thousands of savers, many of them pensioners, placed their faith and hard-earned cash in Woodford's fund and they have been savagely betrayed.", "authors": ["Alex Brummer For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/00/19764080-0-image-a-20_1571181659304.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
