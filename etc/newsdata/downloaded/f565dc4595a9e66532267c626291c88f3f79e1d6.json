The future belongs to patriots,\u201d he told the U.N. General Assembly in a speech with dark overtones and no applause lines.\n\nMr. Trump returned to this theme repeatedly, telling nations to cherish their cultures, resist unfair trade and call out sponsors of terror, singling out Iran as cautionary tale of what happens when a \u201cruling class abandons its people.\u201d\n\nHe told China to stop gaming the World Trade Organization, accused \u201copen-border\u201d activists of pursuing \u201ccruel and evil\u201d policies that undermine human dignity and told European nations not to extend a financial lifeline to Tehran, saying the U.S. will turn the economic screws on Iran until its changes its behavior.\n\n\u201cThe United States does not seek conflict with any other nation. We desire peace, cooperation and mutual gain with all,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cBut I will never fail to defend America\u2019s interests.\u201d\n\nHe reminded assembled leaders that he poured more than $1 trillion into the military to maintain the U.S.\u2019s status as the most powerful nation in the world.\n\n\u201cHopefully it will never have to use this power,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\n\nMr. Trump called on nations to follow his lead by paying their \u201cfair share\u201d to mutual defense. He also urged them to resist socialism, echoing his leading 2020 campaign attack against Democratic foes, and urged nations to protect the rights of its gay citizens.\n\nHe defended religious liberty for all, and urged social media companies not to silence its users, citing the right to free speech.\n\nAnd, evoking a signature priority, he asserted each nation\u2019s right to fair and reciprocal trade rules.\n\n\u201cFor decades, the international trading system has been easily exploited by nations acting in bad faith. As jobs were outsourced, a small handful grew wealthy at the expense of the middle class,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\n\nHe called on Congress to pass his rewrite of the 1990s-era North American trade deal, touted a pending deal with Japan and ambitions in the U.K., which is figuring out how to leave the European Union.\n\nBut he singled out China above all, saying its communist government has taken advantage of the WTO to the determent of others.\n\n\u201cThe second-largest economy of the world should not be able to declared itself a developing country in order to game the system,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\n\nIt was Mr. Trump\u2019s third address to the U.N.\n\nLast year, he drew mocking \u2014 and unexpected \u2014 laughter in declaring that \u201cin less than two years, my administration has accomplished more than almost any administration in the history of our country.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump put North Korea on notice during his first address, in 2017, threatening to \u201ctotally destroy\u201d the country if the U.S. was forced to defend itself or its allies from Kim Jong-un\u2019s \u201csuicide mission.\u201d He also underscored his \u201cAmerica First\u201d philosophy, while encouraging nations to pursue their own interests.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s focus on national sovereignty coursed through Tuesday\u2019s speech.\n\n\u201cIf you want freedom, take pride in your country. If you want democracy, hold on to your sovereignty. And you want peace, love your nation,\u201d he said. \u201cWise leaders always put the good of their own people and their own country first.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump said that view extends, in particular, to safeguarding borders. He called out pro-migrant critics in unusually harsh terms, saying they\u2019ve wrapped themselves in the cloak of \u201csocial justice\u201d to the determent of overwhelmed citizens who are unable to sustain the inflow, while bolstering unlawful traffickers who impose cruel conditions on migrants.\n\n\u201cWhen you undermine border security you are undermining human rights and human dignity,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
