The Coast Guard said four bodies were recovered near the boat, according to The Associated Press.\n\nThe vessel was identified as the Conception, based out of Santa Barbara Harbor, and was on a three-day dive trip to the island, Mike Eliason, a Santa Barbara Fire Department spokesman, tweeted.\n\nFamilies and friends of the victims began arriving at Coast Guard Station Channel Islands Harbor hours after the blaze had fully destroyed the commercial boat. They desperately are trying to get information about missing loved ones.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Ventura County Fire Department via AP Ventura County Fire Department via AP\n\nOne of the first to arrive was James Coles, who says his 58-year-old brother, a long time surfer, had worked as a cook on the boat for about a year.\n\n\"I haven't been able to get a hold of his cell phone or nothing, you know,\" Coles said. \"I'm very concerned and I hope the best for everybody on there.\"\n\nU.S. Coast Guard Capt. Monica Rochester said surviving crew members were \"already awake and on the bridge, and they jumped off\" at the time of the fire. The rest of the passengers are believed to have been asleep, below deck, when the flames broke out.\n\nThe Coast Guard said the 75-foot commercial diving vessel with 39 people on board became engulfed in flames sometime around 3:15 a.m. PT. Nearby civilian boats first reached the scene to help rescue people after hearing mayday calls.\n\nThe Conception eventually sank approximately 20 yards off shore in 64 feet of water, according to a Coast Guard statement.\n\n\"The vessel was reported as being on fire,\" the Coast Guard said in a tweet, adding that crew members working on the boat have been rescued.\n\nIn an interview with Los Angeles TV station KTLA, Coast Guard Petty Officer Mark Barney said two of the crew members had suffered minor leg injuries. He said that rescue agencies actively were searching for dozens of passengers from the ship as well as a missing crew member, using both aircraft and surface ships, but that the effort was hampered by dense early morning fog.\n\nMultiple rescue agencies are involved the operation to assist people in \"distress,\" Coast Guard officials said. But it was a Good Samaritan pleasure craft called Grape Escape that helped evacuate the five crew members.\n\n\"One big question here going forward will be, what exactly was going on on the ship if the crew was able to get off... What were the circumstances around that?\" NPR's Kirk Siegler reported. \"Could they not get under to start rescuing people, was it just too hot? We just don't know at this time.\"\n\nKirk added that according to the Coast Guard, the boat's company doesn't have a history of safety violations.\n\nSanta Cruz Island is about 18 miles from the mainland and about 60 miles west of Los Angeles. The island, home to a national park, is known for its rugged hiking trails and picturesque shoreline.\n\nThis is a developing story. Some things that get reported by the media may later turn out to be wrong. We will focus on reports from police officials and other authorities, credible news outlets and reporters who are at the scene. We will update as the situation develops.\n\nNPR's Merrit Kennedy contributed to this report.", "description": "Officials said \"multiple assets\" were working to rescue 34 people off of the coast of California.
