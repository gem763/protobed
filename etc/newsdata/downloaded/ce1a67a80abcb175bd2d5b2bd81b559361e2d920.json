REUTERS/Stephane Mahe/File Photo\n\nPARIS/LONDON (Reuters) - French bank BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA) will buy a 22.5% stake in wealth management platform Allfunds, the latest sign of asset managers looking to trim operational costs in the face of rising regulatory expenses and pressure on fees from investors.\n\nThis includes the way in which funds are sold to retail investors and under the deal BNP Paribas will entrust Allfunds with the management of distribution contracts of third-party investment funds for several BNP Paribas Group entities.\n\nSimilar to rival platforms such as Britain\u2019s Hargreaves Lansdown HRGV., Allfunds can offer economies of scale and help fund management companies in managing increasingly tough data rules for those hoping to sell funds across borders.\n\nBNP Paribas Securities Services will also transfer its Banca Corrispondente local paying agency activities in Italy, as well as some Italian transfer agency services, over to Spanish-headquartered Allfunds under the deal, for which financial terms were not disclosed.\n\n\u201cThis partnership will enable us to significantly enhance our offering, giving our clients access to a successful and fast-growing fund distribution platform,\u201d BNP Paribas Securities Services CEO Patrick Colle said. The BNP deal is the latest by Allfunds, which in June agreed to buy Credit Suisse\u2019s (CSGN.S) business-to-business investment fund platform InvestLab for an undisclosed sum.[nL8N23W0IX] Singapore\u2019s sovereign wealth fund GIC and private equity investor Hellman & Friedman bought Allfunds in 2017.", "description": "French bank BNP Paribas will buy a 22.5% stake in wealth management platform Allfunds, the latest sign of asset managers looking to trim operational costs in the face of rising regulatory expenses and pressure on fees from investors.", "authors": ["Sudip Kar-Gupta", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191021&t=2&i=1443290853&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9K0DH", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
