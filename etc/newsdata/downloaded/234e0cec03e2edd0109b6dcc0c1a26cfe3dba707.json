Before Mueller\u2019s letter to Barr was made public, Barr told the House Appropriations Committee that he wasn\u2019t aware of any such concerns from Mueller\u2019s investigators. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi subsequently called Barr\u2019s denial of Mueller\u2019s concerns a lie and a crime, and Barr then denied his denial.\n\n\u201cMr. Barr, now the American people know that you are no different from Rudy Giuliani,\u201d Senator Mazie Hirono told him in May, once this all came out, \u201cor Kellyanne Conway or any of the other people who sacrifice their once decent reputation for the grifter and liar who sits in the Oval Office.\u201d\n\nThose who had held out hope that Barr would ultimately defend the rule of law have, with each revelation, fallen away. \u201cIt is better to have an attorney general who is steeped in the traditions and culture of the Justice Department,\u201d wrote Benjamin Wittes upon Barr\u2019s nomination in December, \u201cthan to have an acting attorney general [Matthew Whitaker] who is understood at the department to be operating as the \u2018eyes and ears\u2019 of a president who is busily attacking the institution.\u201d In April, Wittes begged, \u201cFor the next two weeks, let\u2019s give Attorney General William Barr the benefit of the doubt.\u201d (Former FBI Director James Comey urged similarly.) By May, Wittes wrote: \u201cI was willing to give Bill Barr a chance. Consider me burned.\u201d\n\nFormer assistant United States attorney in the Civil Division Maya Wiley, now a MSNBC legal analyst, has withdrawn her once cautious support, as well. \u201cI believed he was capable of sticking to the rule of law and ensuring the Department of Justice maintained the public trust in the midst of an investigation of the president,\u201d she wrote Thursday of Barr, recalling his appointment in February. \u201cI said as much on live TV. I was wrong.\u201d In April, she had said Barr was \u201cacting as the communications director for the White House rather than the U.S. attorney general.\u201d Now, with the release of the whistleblower complaint, Wiley has called for his impeachment.\n\nThe political dimensions of any prosecutor\u2019s job are becoming harder to ignore. This may be partly due to the seemingly never-ending non-indictments of police officers who have shot and killed people on the job. Attorneys in Barr\u2019s civil rights division declined to charge former NYPD officer Eric Pantaleo, whose illegal chokehold killed Eric Garner in 2014\u2014although that Justice Department investigation began in the Obama administration. For decades, and across the nation, county prosecutors\u2014those whose work relies on police\u2014have failed to secure indictments against police who kill. Convictions are rarer still.\n\nThe nascent \u201cprogressive prosecutor\u201d campaigns across the country (which Barr condemns) may be part of this shifting understanding of the job of the prosecutor, too. Reform advocates\u2019 efforts to elect prosecutors who promise to rein in the power of their office depend upon an electorate who understand how much discretion prosecutors hold when it comes to enforcing the law. The candidacy of Senator Kamala Harris has also provided an opportunity to puncture myths about prosecutors. Harris now claims a \u201creformed\u201d prosecutor identity on the campaign trail. But while earlier serving as San Francisco district attorney, Harris prosecuted the kinds of marijuana cases she now criticizes, pursued assault charges against someone who was shot by police, and withheld exculpatory evidence in cases\u2014a serious form of prosecutorial misconduct and a violation of defendants\u2019 rights. All this, her opponents have argued, demonstrate that prosecutors, contrary to popular myth, do not simply, and with robotic precision, enforce the law. And the ideal of \u201cthe law\u201d doesn\u2019t absolve the prosecutor from the harms that come from how she chooses to enforce it.\n\nPeople close to Barr say he was \u201csurprised and angry\u201d to be lumped in the whistleblower complaint with Giuliani, another former prosecutor, who can be seen clownishly undermining his client while allegedly defending him nearly any time a television news camera is nearby. Giuliani, one must strain to recall these days, once garnered liberal respect, too: As the U.S. Attorney for New York\u2019s Southern District and an associate U.S. Attorney General under President Ronald Reagan, he was revered by some as the kind of tough prosecutor who went after the powerful, who transcended politics. (Unless you were a refugee from Haiti, or a black man in New York, or you were Muslim.)\n\nEven back then, Giuliani was willing to twist his prosecutorial power towards spectacle. On a visit to the editors and writers of The Village Voice, Giuliani played his part in a game which the Voice\u2019s Nat Hentoff called \u201cA Journalist\u2019s Dream,\u201d as he wrote in 1989. Giuliani, then \u201cat the crest of his glowing tenure,\u201d was read the names of public officials and other public figures, and was asked for each, would they be indicted, soon or ever? As Hentoff observed of the scene, \u201cI was stunned as the presumption of innocence kept crumbling. Here was the United States attorney for the Southern District inviting us delighted journalists to go on a fox hunt. And he provided the foxes.\u201d\n\nGiuliani may have fully gone off the rails of the law under Trump, but he\u2019s long been willing to skirt due process. The difference is that now, in his televised tantrums, he openly gives away the game underpinning our two-tiered system of justice, one in which prosecutors rule: His appeals to fairness, now that he\u2019s under investigation, have little to do with either fairness or the rule of law. \u201cEqual justice under law is at stake in this Witchunt [sic],\u201d Giuliani tweeted gravely on Sunday. \u201cUntil the media and law enforcement demonstrate equal treatment, division and anger will prevail.\u201d The media, of course, is under no obligation to uphold the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. As for law enforcement, no one has yet criminally charged Giuliani.\n\nTrump that day struck a related note: \u201cLike every American, I deserve to meet my accuser,\u201d he tweeted. By accuser he meant the person he went on to describe as \u201cthe so-called \u2018Whistleblower\u2019.\u201d The right that Trump was referring to lies in a clause in the Sixth Amendment, but applies only to criminal trials. So while Trump and Giuliani\u2019s rhetoric sounds lawyer-ish, these are not appeals to the impartiality of the law. As Trump\u2019s other reported remarks on the whistleblower\u2014praising the execution of spies\u2014make clear, they are closer to threats. \u201cDon\u2019t confuse intimidation with due process,\u201d tweeted MSNBC\u2019s Maya Wiley on Monday.\n\nAs of Monday, Giuliani had been subpoenaed by the House Intelligence Committee. Barr\u2019s fate remains dubious, with more calls for the attorney general\u2019s impeachment joining those already issued against the president. In a matter of weeks or days, Barr may be called\u2014once more\u2014to explain himself under oath. But no one need wait for the verdict. If Barr is a rogue, as Congresswoman Pelosi has said, it\u2019s a rogue\u2019s system.", "description": "Attorney General Bill Barr and ex-prosecutor Rudy Giuliani share the same job: defending the president.", "authors": ["Melissa Gira Grant"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/5bb88f13084f97603579febde448dfce99ca56eb.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg"}
