The 12-year-old has been dancing for seven years, and says he hasn\u2019t had a single dull moment since he started.\n\nMickey specialises in hip hop, and every routine the Tak Sun Secondary School student performs is filled with emotion, and pays tribute to his deep appreciation for hip hop culture.\n\nTwo weeks ago, the Hong Kong Federation of Youth Groups (HKFYG) held its 12th annual Joint School Dance Competition at Citywalk in Tsuen Wan, where Mickey and his 10-member crew, DaBoz, impressed the crowd.\n\nDaBoz won the choreography category of the competition, and Mickey and another dancer, 18-year-old Dino Lo, were named joint runners-up in the All Style 2on2 Battle division.\n\nLanding a major role at Hong Kong Ballet\u2019s \u2018The Nutcracker taught this young ballerina that putting on a great show is all about teamwork\n\n\u201cOur crew\u2019s name, DaBoz, is a reminder to us that we should always try to dance outside \u2018the box\u2019, and to push ourselves to get out of our comfort zones,\u201d explained fellow DaBoz member, Angelina Sun, a 14-year-old student from St Mary\u2019s Canossian College.\n\nMickey believes there are no limits to hip hop. He told Young Post it\u2019s crucial to remember what you\u2019ve learned and keep combining that knowledge with new things. He added that hip hop dancing is about mixing and matching different forms of dance to create your own style.\n\nWhen Mickey was younger, he was obsessed with cartoons. Whenever he saw them on TV, he would start moving his body mimicking the cartoon characters while trying to mirror all their movements.\n\nSeeing his potential, his mother sent him to a dance school, as a five-year-old, where he started learning jazz funk and later moved on to other genres.\n\nDancers (from left) Koko, Mickey and Angelina say they wouldn\u2019t be able to express what\u2019s in their hearts without dance.

The gestures, feelings and styles are all very contrasting. Chinese dance is so much more structured, and they want you to be elegant at all times. You have to force your hands to stay in a fixed shape,\u201d she said. \u201cI like hip hop a lot more because I can just be myself.\u201d\n\nFor DaBoz, hip hop is not just a type of dance, but a culture they hope will become more popular in Hong Kong.\n\n\u201cThe best thing about hip hop is the attitude. It\u2019s cool. It\u2019s carefree, and just free in general,\u201d said Mickey.\n\nDaBoz - a 10-member strong hip hop dance troupe won the best choreography category at the recent HKFYG Joint School Dance Competition.

Wearing what I want is a form of self-expression, and yet we\u2019re not allowed to do so in a school setting,\u201d said Mickey.\n\n\u201cMy outfits represent my feelings and attitudes. The colours I choose to wear reflect my moods, just like how I dance to different music with different feelings.\u201d\n\nAngelina added that she thinks most people in the city are just not open enough when it comes to unconventional fashion choices.\n\nHong Kong's Irish dancers win big at World and International Irish Dance Championships 2019\n\nThe trio hope to help change local attitudes by promoting hip hop culture in their communities; they all aspire to be dance instructors in the future.\n\nThis culture has already made its way into almost every aspect of Mickey\u2019s life. As a member of his school\u2019s basketball team, he likes to incorporate his love of music and dance into the sport.\n\n\u201cTo me, basketball is easier when you have a beat in your heart and a rhythm in your steps,\u201d he said.\n\nHe plays hip hop music whenever his team practises, explaining that it not only puts everyone in a good mood, but brings him one step closer to achieving his goal: to share hip hop with the world.\n\nEdited by Ingrid Piper", "description": "DaBoz uses urban dance as a form of expression and wants people in the city to adopt its carefree attitude", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/ed5bc7dc-efc8-11e9-9f3d-785f2d889e39imagehires114555.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
