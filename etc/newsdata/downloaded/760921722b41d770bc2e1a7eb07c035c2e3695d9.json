He viscerally understands something that many of his party\u2019s foreign-policy wonks do not: After Iraq, the public has little appetite for war. In the Republican primaries, this realization helped him defeat hawkish rivals such as Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio. \u201cI\u2019m the only one on this stage that said, \u2018Do not go into Iraq,\u2019\u201d Trump boasted (falsely) at a debate in February 2016. At a rally a few days later, he invoked his supposed opposition to Iraq as evidence that he alone could be trusted not to launch new wars. \u201cPeople talk about me with the button,\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cI\u2019m the one that doesn\u2019t want to do this.\u201d Like Reagan, Trump understood that while Republican voters favored spending money on the military, they didn\u2019t\u2014absent a direct attack on Americans\u2014want to use it. \u201cWe have to have a great military,\u201d Trump declared early in the campaign, \u201cbut we have to focus on ourselves.\u201d\n\nTrump also understands something else: While many Republican foreign-policy wonks still favor a larger American military footprint overseas, the conservative-media ecosystem has shifted dramatically as a result of Iraq. The most prominent right-wing pundits are now more isolationist than interventionist. And these anti-interventionist pundits\u2014who serve as a link between Trump and his base\u2014constantly remind him that he campaigned on ending wars, not starting them.", "description": "", "authors": ["Peter Beinart", "Theatlantic.Com Ideas Archive Why-Trump-Was-Right-Dump-John-Bolton"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
