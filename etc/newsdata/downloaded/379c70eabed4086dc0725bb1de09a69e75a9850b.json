Get togethers include parties to raise money for charity, outings and debates on social issues.\n\nThat\u2019s how \u201cseveral couples\u201d came to be. \u201cLast year one of them got married,\u201d she said.\n\n\u2013 Unloved Macri \u2013\n\nThe three affiliated Tinder K groups online were set up \u201cto push back against the four years we\u2019ve had of Macrismo,\u201d she said.\n\nBarring a shock, Argentina will revert to Peronism in the October polls with Alberto Fernandez the likely winner, with Kirchner as his vice-president.\n\nMacri has stuttered through the final year of his presidency and is given little chance of re-election after suffering a drubbing in August primaries.\n\nSoaring inflation and rising poverty have stirred outrage at his government\u2019s belt-tightening policies.\n\nMany Tinder K members are inspired by the model of Nestor and Cristina Kirchner who were married for 35 years until his death in 2010.\n\n\u201cThe love they had for each other is a reference point. I see the photos and video of how they looked at each other, how he admired her,\u201d said Estefania.\n\nBut being a Kirchnerite is no guarantee of finding love within the group, says Omar San who created the oldest of the three groups, claiming 6,000 members.\n\n\u201cWe can find you a K partner, but afterwards we can\u2019t guarnatee that it\u2019ll work out.\u201d", "description": "Buenos Aires (AFP) \u2013 They say opposites attract but it doesn\u2019t seem so for many Argentine members of Tinder K, a closed Facebook dating group", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/04/93a420_tinder-members-are-inspired-by-model-nestor-cristina-kirchner-pictured-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
