Any conflict could spill over into the area holding the Al-Hawl camp.\n\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison has been in direct contact with the Turkish and United States governments overnight and on Thursday morning to express his 'deep concern' about the actions.\n\nAsked whether military strikes against the Kurds could ultimately lead to Islamic State retaking territory it was driven from seven months ago, he said that was exactly the concern.\n\n'And that is a concern that has been expressed by Australia and by many others,' he told reporters in Sydney.\n\n'That is what we have expressed directly to our partners and our allies and certainly to the Turkish government.'\n\nHe is also worried about the safety of people in the area and what the invasion could mean for the Kurdish people.\n\nMariam and other women had been duped and coerced into entering Syria and did not pose a threat to Australia, he claimed. Her eldest child was born in Australia and the other two, in Syria (pictured is the al-Hawl refugee camp)\n\n'We will be working through all diplomatic channels, working with our colleagues, whether in Europe or the United States or elsewhere ... to closely monitor these developments, get some clear understanding of the situation on the ground, and consider what possible international responses there are to these issues.'\n\nMr Morrison has defended Donald Trump over the contentious withdrawal of US troops from northern Syria, which paved the way for the Turkish incursion.\n\nThe US president has been accused of leaving Kurdish allies exposed to attacks from Turkish forces, who consider them terrorists.\n\nBut Mr Morrison insists the American action doesn't amount to a betrayal or lead him to question its trustworthiness as an ally.\n\n'Let's be clear: it is the Turkish government that is taking action here to create an unstable situation,' he said.\n\n'They're the ones who are actually deploying and seeking to walk across the border and to take actions in another nation-state.\n\n'It is the actions of the Turkish government that concerns Australia very seriously.'", "description": "Turkey began its attack on northeastern Syria, launching a large scale air strike and ground offensive against Kurdish targets in the region on Thursday (AEDT).", "authors": ["Kelsey Wilkie For Daily Mail Australia", "Australian Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/03/19521620-0-image-a-24_1570675795248.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
