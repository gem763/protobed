They have agreed to set up a booking venue at the site formerly occupied by Greene Turtle Sports Bar and Grille.\n\nLocal businessman Ted Leonsis, whose Monumental Sports & Entertainment holding company owns the arena along with the Wizards, Capitals and Mystics franchises, said the gambling operation is part of a broader set of efforts to appeal to a younger, tech-savvy fan base.\n\n\u201cThink of it as less of a cocktail lounge and more of a modern sports bar and trading desk,\u201d Leonsis said. \u201cWe want it to feel like the best Apple store with the genius bar, because young people are accustomed to that.\u201d\n\n[Games within games: with sports gambling legal, some are betting on a new kind of fan experience]\n\nThe District legalized sports betting late last year after a landmark Supreme Court decision cleared the way for states to legalize sports betting on their own, allowing residents and tourists to place wagers at retail establishments, sports arenas and on mobile apps. Monumental is one of at least 14 venues that has expressed interest.\n\nThe operation is still subject to approval by city regulators, however. A separate online sports betting contract has already been delayed due to litigation.\n\nD.C. Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey S. DeWitt, who oversees city gambling, said last month that businesses would probably start offering legal sports betting by the end of the year and mobile wagers would be available by early 2020.\n\nLeonsis says he first became aware of William Hill five years ago on a trip to visit his daughter in London. On a family trip to a remote town in Scotland, he noticed that the community seemed to revolve around the local betting parlor.\n\n\u201cI joked it\u2019s kind of like Starbucks there. ... It\u2019s everywhere,\u201d he said. \u201cI would walk in and see young people, business people, mothers, sports fanatics and soccer fanatics.\u201d\n\n[Court extends halt on district's no-bid sports gambling contract but plans to rule on lawsuit quickly]\n\nThe partnership with William Hill is meant to wall off the betting operation from the interests of Leonsis\u2019s sports franchises. Monumental will not share in the gambling revenue and will be paid rent under a standard leasing arrangement, executives said. William Hill will separately rent advertising space around the stadium and pay the major sports leagues for access to real-time data feeds.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t touch the money, and we don\u2019t set the odds,\u201d Leonsis said. \u201cA fan needs to know and trust that we do what is in the best interest of the team.\u201d\n\nFor William Hill, the deal is part of an aggressive U.S. expansion that has brought its booking venues to 10 states. The company is suffering at home in the United Kingdom, with a regulatory crackdown forcing it to close hundreds of locations.\n\nJoe Asher, chief executive of William Hill\u2019s U.S. division, likened the U.S. sports betting boom to the end of prohibition. The company has opened dozens of U.S. locations since the Supreme Court decision, bringing its total number of U.S. locations to 143.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve taken this business that has existed but was largely a black market business outside Nevada, and you\u2019ve made it a legal regulated industry,\" Asher said. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge legal industry that is in the process of being created and ramping up.\u201d\n\nThey are waiting on the city to implement a legalization process that is already mired in controversy. The city awarded the gaming and lottery contract to a company without competitive bidding, a decision that sparked a lawsuit.\n\nAnd the city\u2019s online sports gambling program has also been subject to scrutiny. Multiple subcontractors have political connections, including a former campaign aide to D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) and Council member Brandon T. Todd (D-Ward 4), a former campaign lawyer for the mayor and a fundraiser and friend of D.C. Council member Kenyan R. McDuffie (D-Ward 5).\n\nA lobbyist for an executive benefiting from the sports gambling contract also had a business relationship with the lawmaker who advocated for sports gambling, D.C. Council member Jack Evans (D-Ward 2), who is under federal investigation.\n\nThirteen D.C. bars and restaurants have sought changes in their liquor licenses to allow sports betting on their premises.\n\nThey include Dirty Water and Duffy\u2019s Irish Pub on the H Street Northeast, Wet Dog Tavern near the U Street corridor and the Brig near Navy Yard to allow for sports gambling, although they are still pending D.C. Lottery approval.\n\nOther bars awaiting approval for sports betting include the Green Island Cafe in Adams Morgan, Arucola and the Avenue near Chevy Chase, Fat Pete\u2019s Barbecue and Abunai Poke restaurant in downtown, Cleveland Park Bar & Grill in the eponymous neighborhood, Bliss in Northeast D.C., Lyve in the U Street corridor and Lou\u2019s City Bar in Columbia Heights.", "description": "Monumental Sports & Entertainment is taking early steps to set up a legal sports betting operation.", "authors": ["Aaron Gregg", "Reporter Covering The Defense Industry", "Commercial Aviation", "Government Contractors.", "Fenit Nirappil", "Reporter Covering D.C.
