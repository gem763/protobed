(Deaan Vivier, Gallo Images, Netwerk24, file)\n\nDuduzane Zuma, son of former president Jacob Zuma, plans to sue the State over his corruption case, in which charges were later provisionally withdrawn, according to reports on Wednesday.\n\nFormer deputy finance minister Mcebisi Jonas had claimed that Zuma had driven him to the Guptas' Saxonwold home, where he was allegedly offered a R600m bribe and the position of finance minister, just before then-minister Nhlanhla Nene was removed, News24 previously reported.\n\nJonas' claims led the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) to charge Zuma with corruption, but the charges were provisionally withdrawn in the Specialised Commercial Crimes Court in Johannesburg in January.\n\nNPA spokesperson Phindi Mjonondwane told reporters at the time that they had always been ready to prosecute.\n\nHowever, they wanted to strengthen their case against Zuma by waiting for the cross-examination of Jonas at the Zondo commission.\n\n'I am not corrupt'\n\nZuma this week testified before Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo and raised the manner in which he was detained and treated at OR Tambo International Airport.\n\n\"I am looked at as a criminal, a face of corruption, a guy that has plundered trillions out of the country, which is not true,\" he said in testimony to the commission.\n\n\"I am not corrupt. I just want to make that clear. If you see me in the streets, just know that I am not that person.\"", "description": "Duduzane Zuma, son of former president Jacob Zuma, plans to sue the police and NPA over his corruption case, in which charges were later provisionally withdrawn, according to reports.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9454/34c82f1be3ed46728fe07c32d9430679.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
