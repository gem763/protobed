Annual foreign visitor arrivals to Japan trebled in the years from 2013 to 2018 to over 31 million, with around 10 million stopping in Tokyo. That's supposed to top 40 million in 2020.\n\nHowever, unlike other destinations in Japan that are visibly struggling to cope with the influx, Tokyo, thanks to its size and a series of measures to prepare for the deluge, has so far been able to absorb them.\n\nRugby World Cup kicks off this week\n\nThe city's Olympic readiness will get a test run when the Rugby World Cup kicks off on September 20 at Tokyo Stadium. Matches will be held in 12 Japanese cities and around 600,000 international rugby fans are expected to descend on the country, taking one third of tickets.\n\nSome 13,000 volunteers have been hired to help rugby fans to navigate the city and enjoy the matches.

The organizers have promised that all the basics for an exciting and welcoming experience are in place, with 13,000 volunteers, many with English-language skills, on hand on match days.\n\nTokyo Stadium itself is around 18 kilometers to the west of what can be considered the central part of the city, though there are two official fan zones at the Tokyo Sports Square and Chofu Station Square/Chofu City Green Hall.\n\nUnless Japan is playing, local pubs, known as izakayas, are more likely to be watching the culmination of the baseball season or variety shows on TV than rugby.\n\nThis is where some businesses are looking to fill the gap, such as the Hub group of British-style pubs and ANA Intercontinental Hotel Group.\n\nBoth are making efforts to target foreign visitors and local sports fans with promotions and fan-theme areas in their bars and hotels to watch live broadcasts of the matches.\n\n\"What I most expect is that we will have many foreigners who understand pub culture (because it's originally their culture) and they enjoy chatting and watching sports,\" says Tsuyoshi Ota, president of Hub.\n\nTokyo Stadium is one of the venues for the upcoming 2019 Rugby World Cup. QUENTIN TYBERGHIEN/AFP/AFP/Getty Images\n\nWhile the sport is growing in the country and Japan's national team, known as \"The Brave Blossoms\" notched a huge win in the tournament against South African four years ago, it still remains niche.\n\n\"I think locals will find something big is going on in September seeing so many foreigners and they will give foreigners a warm greeting. I don't think most local people realize that so many people are coming to Japan for the Rugby World Cup,\" says Ota.\n\nTokoyite and sports fan Kensuke Tezuka also thinks that once the event gets going the atmosphere and local interest level will change.\n\n\"Japanese people tend to be quiet in daily life but we get cheerful and friendly in omatsuri (festival) occasions. I remember the 2002 football World Cup. Shibuya Crossing was very lively. The visitors come to Tokyo for a once-in a-lifetime occasion, so they are naturally excited. They will provide a great vibe.\"\n\nThe 'Olympics effect'\n\nl e v a r t\n\nJapan's government expects the \"Olympics effect\" will bring approximately an extra 10 million visitors to the country in 2020.\n\nIt's an opportunity to showcase Tokyo to the world and the country isn't taking it lightly. Earlier this year, the city's governor, Yuriko Koike, told media the city was poised for \"dramatic change.\"\n\n\"This year, 2019, will be key in making those Games a success and ushering in a new Tokyo,\" said Koike.\n\nMajor developments now underway include the Takanawa Gateway -- the first new station build on Tokyo's key JR Yamanote train line since 1971 -- which is due to open next year.\n\nFeaturing a steel-and-glass roof inspired by traditional Japanese origami, it's located between Tamachi and Shinagawa Stations and was designed by architect Kengo Kuma, who is also behind the new National Stadium being built for the 2020 Tokyo Games.\n\nThe area around Shibuya Station is also being revamped as part of a huge multi-year makeover to cement it as the city's entertainment, transport and business hub for decades to come.\n\nTokyo's new Takanawa Gateway station will open in 2020 -- just in time for the Summer Olympics. JR East\n\nThis includes the new Shibuya Scramble Square, a 230-meter high mixed-use skyscraper located directly above Shibuya Station, with indoor and outdoor observation decks. It's due to open for business November 1.\n\nAnother hotly anticipated opening in this neighborhood is the Meiji Jingu Museum -- also by Kengo Kuma. Due to open in late October, it sits next to Yoyogi Park and is designed to blend into its wooded surroundings while showcasing important cultural artifacts.\n\nOther changes of note include wider free wifi coverage not just in Tokyo but in the entire country -- including 108 Shinkansen \"bullet train\" stations.\n\nTo assist with language barriers while dining, the Tokyo government has launched a special location-based website that highlights restaurants with multilingual menus.\n\nNew Olympics sporting venues\n\nIn terms of Olympic sporting action, 30 events will be taking place at 43 venues, with the soon-to-be-finished New National Stadium as the centerpiece.\n\nLocated on the site of the main stadium for the 1964 Olympics, it's just a few kilometers from areas of the city popular with foreign visitors such as Shibuya, Shinjuku, Ginza and Roppongi.\n\nOn top of that, 10 public locations including Yoyogi and Hibiya parks will broadcast events, while a cohort of 80,000 volunteers -- many of them English-speaking -- will guide visitors, meaning the city should be well prepared.\n\nVisiting sports fans with tickets will also find themselves near Tokyo Bay. It's not a traditional tourist area, but one developed for the Olympics and Paralympics.\n\nIt will host 17 sporting venues and the Olympic Village, where humanoid robots will reportedly be available to offer directions to nearby accommodations and attractions.\n\nBook those hotel rooms now\n\nThe Okura Tokyo has just reopened following extensive renovations. Courtesy Okura\n\nAccording to real estate services company CBRE, an additional 30,000 hotel rooms are predicted to be available in Tokyo by 2020, compared to 2017, bringing the total to around 120,000.\n\nAmong the most anticipated is the Okura Tokyo, which has just reopened following extensive renovations that kicked off in 2015.\n\nThe original Hotel Okura Tokyo main building opened in 1962 and quickly became a global favorite by offering a mix of traditional Japanese culture with world-class service. After four years of rebuilding work, it has reopened as the Okura Tokyo and offers 508 luxury rooms in two buildings.\n\nHowever, many more rooms are expected to be needed to cope with the influx of Olympic visitors.\n\nStricter requirements on locals looking rent spare rooms in their homes, through sites such as Airbnb, and few budget hotel options in the city means that planning and booking as far in advance as possible is strongly advised.\n\nBusinesses are encouraged to allow employees to work from home to ease pressure on public transportation during the Games. TORU YAMANAKA/AFP/Getty Images\n\nOther stresses are predicted, both for visitors and locals.\n\nWhile most signage in stations and on public transport in the capital is already in Japanese and English, the influx will put more pressure on the city's infrastructure, particularly the full-to-bursting Metro and other train lines, which visitors will be using just like the city's commuters.\n\nBut counter measures are being planned so Olympic spectators and 'salary men' and 'office ladies' don't make each other's journey even more of a squeeze.\n\nFor instance, one initiative underway is encouraging businesses to allow shift- and tele-working by its employees -- a concept still hard to digest in Japan's rigid work culture where employees works some of the longest hours in the world.\n\nRelated content 36 of Japan's most stunning places for your next vacation\n\n\"No need to worry\"\n\nRegardless of the potential disruptions, many, like taxi driver Masaru Okano, are looking forward to Tokyo hosting these huge events and the longer-term changes to Tokyo that are expected.\n\nThe 69-year-old has been learning English, and some Korean, for the last few years to provide a better service to the growing number of foreign visitors he finds in his cab.\n\n\"When I give them a ride, I always ask where they came from and I try to greet them in their language,\" he says.", "description": "Tokyo will host two of the world's biggest sporting events: The Rugby World Cup in 2019 and the 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games.
