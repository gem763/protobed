Zeebrugge is a freight and container port which isn\u2019t geared up to detect migrants. It\u2019s organised crime finding a route that is guaranteed success and where you can charge premium rates,\u201d explained David Wood, Director-General of Immigration Enforcement from 2013 to 2014, in comments to The Telegraph.\n\nCarl Decaluw\u00e9, Governor of the Province of West Flanders which includes Zeebrugge, has revealed that, on average, 106 migrants are arrested in the region every week, and that even basic security such as CCTV cameras for the the lorry parks on the motorway from Brussels to Ostend \u2014 another major North Sea port \u2014 is lacking.\n\nBreitbart London has previously reported on how van and lorry drivers, who have been stabbed and even killed by illegal migrants seeking to secrete themselves in their vehicles en route to the United Kingdom, have warned of increased and sometimes highly aggressive migrant activity in other ports away from Calais, such as Normandy and Caen.\n\nThe exact facts of how the murdered migrants came to be in the United Kingdom is unclear \u2014 due in no small part to the extreme difficulty the British authorities have tracking even items as large as heavy goods vehicles which enter Britain via its porous maritime border. Regardless, it seems likely the victims will fit a less well-known profile than the arguably more well-worn pattern associated with the predominantly African, Middle Eastern, South Asian, and Balkan migrants who accost lorry drivers and ferry operators around the European coast.\n\nIndeed, the Essex case closely mirrors another from the year 2000, when the bodies of some 58 migrants were found in the back of a lorry in the Port of Dover. Only two survived.\n\nHsiao-Hung Pai, a journalist born in Taiwan, wrote extensively on the \u201chidden army\u201d of Chinese illegal migrant workers in Britain, estimated to number in the hundreds of thousands, as long ago as 2008 in her book Chinese Whispers.\n\nThese migrants are generally invisible to the British public unless they caught up in major tragedies such as the Morecambe Bay disaster of 2004, when 23 \u201cslaves\u201d workers were drowned picking cockles on England\u2019s north-west coast.\n\nSuch people are typically smuggled or outright trafficked into Britain by ruthless networks of criminal smugglers, known as \u201csnakeheads\u201d in China, who charge thousands, even tens of thousands of pounds to arrange dangerous and often deadly trips \u2014 including the one aforementioned Dover case which ended with dozens of their \u201ccustomers\u201d suffocating to death.\n\nSomali Migrant Trafficker and Serial Rapist Sentenced to 30 Years https://t.co/jBV9886bnN pic.twitter.com/u0o0fKfImY \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 16, 2016\n\nPeople-smuggles bringing illegal migrants to Britain and Europe from other parts of the world are no less ruthless, and their victims exploited no less viciously.\n\nIn 2016, Breitbart London reported on the case of Somali people-smuggler Mouhamud Elmi Muhidin, who brought 366 people to their death piloting an unseaworthy vessel into the Mediterranean Sea from Libya.\n\nSurvivors recounted harrowing tales of Muhidin and his fellow smugglers raping every woman in their charge, and torturing their passengers with beatings and electric shocks \u201cbecause we were just Christians, inferior beings to Muslims.\u201d\n\nMass rapes and deliberate drownings of Christians are regular and even typical features of the people-smuggling trade, which for a time was in hock to the Islamic State terror network and provided it with significant funding in the form of protection money.\n\nThe smugglers work with organised crime syndicates such as the Nigerian mafia, known to terrify female migrants into sexual slavery with barbaric voodoo rituals and threats of violence upon their arrival in Europe.\n\nEven European nationals are not beyond the smugglers\u2019 malicious grasp, with hundreds of Ukrainians in \u201cfinancial difficulties\u201d ending up in prison after being press-ganged into piloting yachts which collect migrants from the coast of Turkey and then transport them to EU ports \u201cunder penalty of death\u201d.\n\nWATCH: Ukraine Busts People-Smuggling Network Ferrying Migrants to EU https://t.co/LyQC20S8JT \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 23, 2019\n\nThe reaction among many prominent left-liberal politicians and commentators to the Chinese migrant deaths in Essex has been to lay the blame at the feet of the Tory government\u2019s supposed \u201chostile environment\u201d policy towards illegal migrants, although this appears to have been largely abandoned, and in any was focused on making it more difficult to operate in Britain\u2019s extensive black economy rather than reinforcing its limp border controls.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t turn the United Kingdom into a fortress,\u201d argued Sean Sawyer, Chief Constable of Devon and Cornwall Police, in an interview on BBC Radio 4 on the subject of the deaths \u2014 but he added that relaxing Britain\u2019s borders could not solve the issues around human trafficking and people-smuggling.\n\n\u201cOrganised crime sees people as commodity; they will abuse any system, anywhere, anytime,\u201d he explained.\n\nSome left-neoliberals have said the Essex deaths make the case for abolishing borders outright, however \u2014 indeed, the opposition Labour party has committed to moving towards global inward free movement if it forms Britain\u2019s next government at its most recent party conference.\n\nLabour also vowed to shut down all the country\u2019s detention centres \u2014 a move which would make is all but impossible to deport anyone in the country illegally, which serve as a signal for the people-smugglers to massively step up their efforts, and put many more lives in danger.\n\nLabour Votes to Open Borders, Give All Migrants Voting Rights, NHS Access https://t.co/yBpYN6SQsZ \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) September 26, 2019\n\nBut a policy of wholesale open borders is likely untenable, whatever the rhetoric of the political left, given the relative size of the United Kingdom\u2019s population and the number of global poor \u2014 among others \u2014 who could seek to come to it.\n\nFor example, in the deceased migrants\u2019 home country of China alone there are around 43.35 million people living below the poverty line \u2014 more than four times the population of Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland combined \u2014 while around 500 million people \u2014 roughly on par with the population of the European Union in its entirety \u2014 survive on just $5.50 per day or less, according to the Borgen Project.\n\nEvidently, the United Kingdom is incapable of receiving such an influx, making it all the more important that the British government cracks down on the black economy and imposes salutary sentences on people-smugglers when they are brought to book.\n\nThe UK is soon to leave the European Union, meaning the nation will be able to shed the bloc\u2019s \u201ccompletely useless\u201d rules on deportation which currently hamstring such efforts. In time, it may be possible to make the country a less desirable destination for illegal migrants, discouraging would-be arrivals from putting their own lives at risk by placing themselves in the hands of callous smugglers in the first place.\n\nFollow Jack Montgomery on Twitter: @JackBMontgomery", "description": "The tragic deaths of 39 would-be illegal migrants from China in a refrigerator lorry highlight the deadly side-effects of lax border control.", "authors": ["Jack Montgomery"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/migrants-lorry-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
