As a result, many colleges in the region were forced to shut down for extended periods of time.\n\nUC Berkeley was forced to shut down the entire campus on Thursday evening. Students were advised to stay away from campus. The university claims that it is still unclear how much longer the outage will last.\n\n\u201cPlease note that this is predicated upon PG&E restoring power from three disparate substation locations (different from the city of Berkeley) and the campus completing the lengthy process of reconnecting to PG&E power,\u201d a notice published by UC Berkeley reads. \u201cThis process involves multiple steps and many buildings, and it is critical that it be done carefully so that the cogeneration plant continues to operate effectively throughout the transition process.\u201d\n\nEvergreen Valley College, Merritt College, and Mills College all canceled class for one or more days this week as a result of the outages. Although UC Berkeley has just shut down its campus, many Northern California colleges will resume classes on Friday.\n\nSt. Mary\u2019s College in Moraga, California, has not shut down as a result of the outage. However, some classes have been canceled. \u201cThe College will remain open for classes and services with appropriate modifications,\u201d the college wrote on its website. \u201cThere will be some exceptions so students should attend to communications from their instructors.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, St. Mary\u2019s College announced that they will install a power generator this weekend if the blackouts continue so that residents can take hot showers.\n\n\u201cIf power outage extends thru the weekend, a generator will be set up for the Joseph Alioto Recreation Center (JARC) to provide hot showers for the residential population,\u201d the college wrote on Twitter. \u201cAdditionally, the Recreation Center will be able to provide charging stations.\u201d\n\nIf power outage extends thru the weekend, a generator will be set up for the Joseph Alioto Recreation Center (JARC) to provide hot showers for the residential population.
