MacRumors was first to report on Kuo\u2019s latest research note, which says that the phones\u2019 \u201cmetal frame surface will be changed to a similar design to the iPhone 4, replacing the current surface design.\u201d\n\nKuo, who has a good track record of predicting Apple\u2019s announcements long before the company makes them official, previously indicated that next year\u2019s iPhones will have an all-new design. However, he didn\u2019t offer many details on exactly what this new design would be. Apple\u2019s current phone form factor has remained broadly consistent since the iPhone X was released in 2017.\n\nThe first major redesign since the iPhone X\n\nCompared to previous iPhones, the iPhone 4 had a more square-edged design. Apple has recently returned to this design on at least one of its products, the 2018 iPad Pro, which eschewed the curved edges seen on most of Apple\u2019s other tablets. However, Kuo\u2019s note mentions that the phone will still use glass with a slight curve in it on the phone\u2019s front and rear, which is absent from the iPad Pro.\n\nHowever, the iPhone 4\u2019s form factor famously fell prey to the antennagate controversy, which saw people lose cell reception if they held the device incorrectly, forcing Apple to give out free cases to solve the problem. MacRumors doesn\u2019t explicitly mention whether Kuo\u2019s note addresses the old controversy, but he says that the metal frame will be designed to minimize any impact the metal could have on the phone\u2019s high-frequency transmission. Apple has also successfully integrated antennas into the sides of many of its more recent phones, suggesting its antennagate days are long behind it.\n\nKuo also reiterated that next year\u2019s iPhones should support 5G. Earlier this year, Kuo predicted that all three 2020 iPhone models will support 5G. Previously, he predicted that the two OLED models would feature 5.4-inch and 6.7-inch displays, compared to the current sizes of 5.8-inches and 6.5-inches. There are also reports that Apple might release the phones with in-display fingerprint sensors next year, although Kuo has predicted that the technology won\u2019t be ready until 2021.", "description": "Apple\u2019s 2020 iPhones could feature a metal frame design similar to the one that was used for the iPhone 4 back in 2010.
