And as you can see in the table below, the narratives were pretty different \u2014 CNN\u2019s coverage was much more likely to focus on the breaking news aspect of the story (the phrase \u201cbreaking news\u201d was actually the third most likely to be used by CNN in conjunction with \u201cUkraine\u201d versus other networks). Fox News focused more on \u201cHillary Clinton\u201d and \u201cHunter Biden,\u201d while MSNBC focused heavily on \u201cDonald Trump.\u201d\n\nFox News has discussed Hunter Biden\u2019s ties to a gas company in Ukraine \u2014 as well his ties to China \u2014 more than the other outlets. It frequently mentioned \u201cHillary Clinton,\u201d and the idea that she, too, might have shadowy connections to Ukraine. Fox also used the phrase \u201cquid pro quo\u201d more often than the other networks, with most coverage pointing out that Trump did not explicitly ask for a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d or promise Zelensky foreign assistance for Ukrainian cooperation.\n\nMeanwhile, MSNBC has centered its media narrative on Trump and the possibility of presidential wrongdoing. It repeatedly described Trump\u2019s request to Zelensky to investigate Biden as \u201cdigging up dirt.\u201d1 In total, the phrase was used 38 different times on MSNBC, 27 times on CNN and just seven times on Fox News. MSNBC also emphasized the role of Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, more than the other networks, often referring to him by his role rather than his name.", "description": "", "authors": ["Dhrumil Mehta", "Fivethirtyeight.Com Features On-Fox-Trump-Is-Not-At-The-Center-Of-The-Ukraine-Story"], "top_image": ""}
