(Danny Moloshok/Reuters)\n\nNBC News President Noah Oppenheim sent a letter to employees on Monday denying that the organization suppressed reports of sexual abuse by former Today Show host Matt Lauer and movie producer Harvey Weinstein, as is alleged in journalist Ronan Farrow\u2019s forthcoming book.\n\nFarrow, who worked for NBC at the time he was investigating accusations against Weinstein, writes in his upcoming book, \u201cCatch and Kill,\u201d that NBC struck secretive nondisclosure agreements and settlements with Lauer\u2019s alleged victims. He also alleges NBC executives tried to stop him from investigating sexual abuse claims against Weinstein out of fear that the film mogul would expose Lauer\u2019s behavior and their complicity in it.\n\n\u201cFarrow alleges there were employees who reported Lauer\u2019s behavior prior to November of 2017 and were paid settlements to silence them,\u201d Oppenheim wrote in his letter. \u201cNot only is this false, the so-called evidence Farrow uses in his book to support the charge collapses under the slightest scrutiny.\u201d\n\nOppenheim goes on to call Farrow\u2019s allegations a \u201csmear\u201d and a \u201cconspiracy theory.\u201d\n\nFarrow also writes in his book that Weinstein tried to use his connections with Hillary Clinton publicist Nick Merrill to suppress the reports against him. According to Farrow, Merrill told him during a phone conversation that the Weinstein story was a \u201cconcern\u201d for the former first lady.\n\nMerrill commented that he had \u201cno idea what Weinstein was saying to people to save himself.\u201d\n\nLauer was fired from the Today Show in 2017 following allegations of sexual misconduct. In his book, Farrow writes of a previously-unknown allegation that Lauer raped an NBC staffer while at the Sochi Olympics in 2014.\n\nLauer has denied the allegations.\n\n\u201cOld stories are being recycled, titillating details are being added, and a dangerous and defamatory new allegation is being made,\u201d Lauer wrote in a statement in response to Farrow\u2019s book.", "description": "NBC News President Noah Oppenheim on Monday denied that the organization suppressed reports of sexual abuse by Matt Lauer and Harvey Weinstein.", "authors": ["Zachary Evans", "John Mccormack", "John Hirschauer", "Andrew C.
