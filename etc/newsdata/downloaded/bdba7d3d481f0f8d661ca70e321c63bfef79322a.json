It\u2019s going to be dark. If the fridge is running it\u2019ll be incredibly cold.\u201d\n\nCCTV footage shows the distinctive red and white cab and trailer driving into Waterglade Industrial Park in Grays at 1.15am.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nPolice were called at around 1.40am. Big Blue Squirrel self storage manager Sana Mirza said: \u201cIt makes me feel sick watching that footage knowing those people were on board.\n\n\u201cAll I have been thinking about is the last person who was alive on there and what they must have been thinking.\u201d\n\nLocal \u00adbusiness co-owner Andrew Larkin told how he saw the Scania truck parked at the same spot on Tuesday.\n\nHe said: \u201cI walked right past it at 2pm, definitely the same lorry, it stood out because of its exhaust, it\u2019s unique. The curtains were closed around the cabin so he must have been asleep. I don\u2019t know if there was anything inside.\n\n\u201cI can only think he\u2019s had a long drive, stopped for a sleep, maybe woken up to drive and then he\u2019s gone somewhere and returned after 1am.\u201d\n\nThe bodies had only been in the UK for an hour and 10 minutes before they were found. Officers guarding the scene solemnly bowed their heads as the lorry and trailer, still containing the 39 bodies, were moved to a secure location on Wednesday evening.\n\n(Image: JIM BENNETT)\n\nTory MP Jackie \u00adDoyle-Price, who \u00adrepresents nearby \u00adThurrock, said: \u201cTo put 39 people into a locked metal container shows a contempt for human life that is evil.\n\n\u201cThe best thing we can do in memory of those victims is to find the perpetrators and bring them to justice.\u201d\n\nPM Boris Johnson added: \u201cAll such traders in human beings should be hunted down and brought to justice. My thoughts are with all those who lost their lives and their loved ones.\u201d Police have refused to comment on the identity of the arrested man.\n\nRobinson lives in \u00adPortadown, Co Armagh, and is \u00adreportedly expecting a baby with his girlfriend.\n\nHe has made regular Facebook posts about the truck on Instagram and \u00adFacebook, referring to it as the \u201cPolar Express\u201d and \u00ad\u201cScandinavian Express\u201d.\n\nOn Wednesday his family said they haven\u2019t \u201cheard from him\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019t know what is going on\u201d.\n\n(Image: SplashNews.com)\n\n(Image: SWNS.com)\n\nPolice now know the Scania tractor unit involved in the case entered the UK at \u00adHolyhead, North Wales, after crossing from Ireland.\n\nThe \u00adrefrigerated trailer arrived separately at Purfleet in Essex, from the Belgian town of Zeebrugge \u2013 a \u00adnotorious \u00adpeople-smuggling route. It was attached to the tractor unit, which left the dock area at 1.05am.\n\nOne lorry driver said it would \u201cnot be unusual\u201d for a driver not to know what his load was.\n\nThe unnamed trucker added: \u201cPurfleet docks are always busy. All sorts goes in and out of there. The paperwork the driver deals with doesn\u2019t have to say what is in the trailer.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t go in the back of any of my trailers and if it\u2019s a sealed trailer I can\u2019t. It could be that the driver has gone to pick that up and not known.\n\n\u201cWhat is unusual is that he stopped so nearby. Normally drivers would go straight from here to a warehouse. You just wouldn\u2019t stop before your delivery and open your back doors.\u201d\n\n(Image: Sky News)\n\nFormer immigration officer David Wood also said Purfleet is \u201cnot greatly geared up\u201d to check for migrants. He added: \u201cIt would be fairly safe, a clear route for organised criminals to use.\u201d\n\nThermal imaging cameras used at ports are unable to detect people in \u00adrefrigeration trailers.\n\nScania Super truck was registered at Varna, Bulgaria, in the name of a company owned by an Irish woman in June 2017. But local authorities said it left the country the following day.", "description": "Essex Police have launched an international hunt for the people-smuggling gang responsible for shipping the people to the UK in a container", "authors": ["Paul Byrne", "Louie Smith", "Matthew Young", "Amy-Clare Martin", "Image", "Pa", "Jim Bennett", "Splashnews.Com", "Swns.Com", "Sky News"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20709415.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Police-forensics-officers-at-the-Waterglade-Industrial-Park-in-Grays-Essex.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
