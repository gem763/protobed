Thai exporters have struggled to sell the staple since the beginning of the year.\n\nThe country\u2019s benchmark 5-percent broken rice prices were quoted at $400-$420 a tonne on Thursday, compared to $400-$418 last week.\n\n\u201cThe price is only fluctuating due to the exchange rate at the moment as both demand and supply remain unchanged,\u201d a Bangkok-based trader said.\n\nConcerns over supply also persist due to floods in northeastern Thailand that have damaged agricultural land, including some rice-growing areas. This has not had an immediate impact on prices though, traders said.\n\n\u201cBuyers seem to be heading to Vietnam as Thai prices are a lot higher,\u201d a trader based in Ho Chi Minh City said.\n\n\u201cWe think that prices have bottomed and that domestic supplies have gone low as the summer-autumn harvest has ended.\u201d\n\nIn Vietnam, rates for 5% broken rice rose to $335 a tonne on Thursday from $325 a week earlier, which was its lowest since November 2007.\n\nPreliminary data showed at least 37,100 tonnes of rice is scheduled to be loaded at Ho Chi Minh City ports during Oct. 1-9, with most of the shipments bound for West Africa and Malaysia, according to traders.\n\nMeanwhile, Bangladesh is considering providing a subsidy to farmers, who suffered a double blow of low rice prices and high harvesting costs, in an effort to reduce production costs and boost domestic output, Agriculture Minister Abdur Razzaque told Reuters on Thursday.\n\n\u201cTo make it profitable, we must use more machinery because the labour price is very high. We\u2019ll provide (a) subsidy to help farmers buy modern machinery so that they minimize labour costs for production,\u201d he said.\n\nDhaka has been unable to clinch overseas deals since a long-standing export ban was lifted in May as its rice is more expensive than India\u2019s or Thailand\u2019s, despite a recent fall in local prices.", "description": "Indian rice export prices slipped this week as demand from Africa remained sluggish, while shipments from Thailand remained sluggish to a strong baht.", "authors": ["Karthika Suresh Namboothiri", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1434166373&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P18Q", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
