Regulators have been recalling some blood pressure and heart failure medicines since last year.\n\nThe following is a timeline on Zantac:\n\n\n\n\n\n1983\n\nGlaxo Holdings Ltd, now a part of GlaxoSmithKline PLC, receives its first U.S. FDA approval for Zantac as a short-term treatment of a common form of ulcers. The drug was already approved in 31 different countries.\n\n\n\n\n\n1988\n\nZantac becomes the world's best selling drug and one of the first-ever drugs to top $1 billion in annual sales.\n\n\n\n\n\n1997\n\nGlaxo's U.S. patent for ranitidine expires and competitors launch generic alternatives to the drug.\n\n\n\n\n\n2004-2017\n\nPfizer receives FDA approval for an over-the-counter version of Zantac in the U.S. The brand later moved in various transactions to Johnson & Johnson, Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals and Sanofi SA, which currently sells Zantac in the U.S. Other companies also launch generic over-the-counter competitors.\n\n\n\n\n\nJuly 2018\n\nEuropean and American regulators recall blood pressure drug valsartan made by China's Zhejiang Huahai Pharmaceuticals after finding the cancer causing impurity N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) in samples of drugs containing ranitidine. The regulators have since found the impurities in a wide number of the drugs in the same class, called angiotensin II receptor blockers.\n\n\n\n\n\nSept. 13, 2019\n\nU.S. and European regulators say they are reviewing the safety of ranitidine.\n\n\n\n\n\nSept. 18, 2019\n\nNovartis AG's Sandoz Unit, which makes generic drugs, says it is halting the distribution of its versions of Zantac in all markets, while Canada requests drugmakers selling ranitidine to stop distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\nSept. 28, 2019\n\nDrugstore chain CVS Health Corp says it will stop selling Zantac and its own generic ranitidine products. Walmart Inc, Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc and Rite Aid Corp have also moved to remove the drugs off their shelves.\n\n\n\n\n\nOct 2, 2019\n\nFDA says it has found \"unacceptable levels\" of N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) in samples of drugs containing ranitidine in its testing.\n\n\n\n\n\nOct 8, 2019\n\nGlaxoSmithKline, the original maker of the drug, recalls prescription-only Zantac medicines in all its markets as a precaution.\n\n\n\n\n\nOct 18, 2019\n\nSanofi recalls over-the-counter Zantac in the United States and Canada, a day after the UK unit of Teva Pharmaceutical, the world's largest generic drug maker, recalled some batches of ranitidine.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Manas Mishra in Bengaluru and Michael Erman in New York; editing by Grant McCool)", "description": "Ranitidine is the newest drug in which presence of cancer causing impurities have been found.
