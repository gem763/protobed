The ugly and evil face of India stands exposed before the world with the kind of atrocities it has committed against the innocent Kashmiri people and New Delhi is not left with any argument or logic today, the president asserted.\n\nAlvi said India has been using pellet guns against the Muslim population of occupied Kashmir over the last four or five years, they have rendered one hundred thousand lives in their just struggle for the right to self-determination.\n\n\u201cPakistan will always stand by their Kashmiri brethren in this just struggle. Pakistan has always raised Kashmir dispute at all the international fora,\u201d he said highlighting the strong bonds between Pakistanis and Kashmiris.\n\nResponding to a question about Pakistan\u2019s efforts for the plight of Kashmiri people, the president said Prime Minister Imran Khan has proved himself as a true ambassador of the oppressed people. He said the Prime Minister forcefully and eloquently presented the Kashmir cause at the UN General Assembly and unmasked the extremist face of India.\n\nHe continued that the PM\u2019s speech was also reflective of the aspirations of the entire Muslim Ummah.\n\nPresident Alvi thanked China, Turkey, Malaysia and other countries who supported the stance of Pakistan on Kashmir. He said the US President Donald Trump has repeatedly offered mediation but India is not ready for it. \u201cIf India is not ready for mediation, then it should sit with Pakistan and Kashmiris for the resolution of the dispute.\u201d\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "President Arif Alvi has urged the world community to recognize the state terrorism that India is perpetrating in occupied Kashmir", "authors": ["Web Desk"], "top_image": "https://arynews.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Arif-Alvi-2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
