It\u2019s recently gained popularity among start-ups and online entertainment as a domain for gamers, probably because it\u2019s short, catchy, and some of the best-known free web games out there are registered to .io. Here are 13 of the best games out there that are registered to this domain.\n\nBuild, defend, and survive \u2013 that\u2019s all you need to remember when playing this zombie game. Collect resources and reinforce your structures during the day, and protect your base (and the stash of gold you\u2019re hiding) from the brainless dead at night.\n\nUse your mouse to fly a jet through the sky and collect various power-ups that will give you different projectiles to shoot at other players with. Earn points by destroying the other planes onscreen, but make sure to keep an eye out for those who might attack your own jet too.\n\nRemember Flappy Bird? That was a gaming app released in May 2013, and which was removed from the App Store and Google Play on February 10, 2014. If you loved that game, you\u2019ll love this \u2013 it\u2019s essentially the same, except here you get to laugh at others for failing to flap very far too.\n\nEven if you\u2019ve not heard of any other game on this list, you will have heard of this one \u2013 the one that arguably started it all. Players control a cell on a map that looks like a petri dish. The aim of the game is simple: absorb as many other cells on the map as possible, and become the largest cell out there.\n\nClimb the evolutionary food chain in this fun little game, where you play as different animals struggling to be the biggest, baddest, and scariest. Start as a tiny mouse, and forage for food as you avoid getting eaten. If you\u2019re clever enough, you might even end the game as a dragon!\n\nNo, that\u2019s not a typo, it\u2019s really \u201cdeeeep\u201d, with four e\u2019s. Play as a little marine creature that will gradually get bigger the more you eat. The bigger you get, the more evolved you\u2019ll become. This game can be tense \u2013 I\u2019ve personally spent a harrowing 30 minutes dodging a giant squid.\n\nImagine the really old Nokia phone game Snake \u2013 but online, 3D and multiplayer. Play as a snake, and collect orbs onscreen. The more you collect, the more experience you\u2019ll gain and the bigger you\u2019ll grow. Grab a boost in experience by absorbing other players \u2013 but be careful, they\u2019re after you too!\n\nPlayers navigate levels on this multiplayer third person shooter using their WASD keys, and have to aim and shoot at their opponents using their mouse. Choose between different shooter classes and earn new dudes for your marksman to wear the longer you play.\n\nPhysical fidget spinners are OUT \u2013 virtual ones are where it\u2019s all at. Try to increase your RPM (rotations per minute) on these online fidget spinners as you face other players. If your RPM is four times higher than theirs, you get to knock them out of the game and win their experience points.\n\nIn this online world, you play as a tank, and you fire at other tanks in an attempt to destroy them all. Simple, but fun. The more tanks you hit, the more points you\u2019ll gain. Use these points to level up and upgrade your tank, until it\u2019s the biggest, baddest armoured vehicle in town.\n\nMuch like iSketch, this is an online Pictionary game, in which players take turns to draw out a given word, and the other online players have to guess what it is you\u2019re drawing. Earn points by being easily understood, and by guessing what other people are drawing the quickest.\n\nPicture this: you\u2019re a coloured blob, attached to a star. The name of the game is easy enough: protect your star against other blobs. Playing the game itself ... is harder than it looks. Move around the map by using the mouse and the spacebar, and steal other people\u2019s stars before they can steal yours.\n\nMuch like Bejeweled or Candy Crush Saga, this is a game in which you match up three of the same things \u2013 but on a much larger scale. Play alongside other players, and help (or hinder) each other as you all match stuff together.\n\nEdited by Ginny Wong", "description": "Pass the time before school starts again by trying your hand at one of these fun online games.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/untitled_design.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
