An accusation followed.", "language": "en", "text": "\n\nMalik Yoba at the Los Angeles premiere of \"American Woman\" on June 5. (Joshua Blanchard/Getty Images for Roadside Attractions)\n\nActor Malik Yoba wanted to lend his name to the National Trans Visibility March.\n\nRecently, the 51-year-old actor of \u201cNew York Undercover\u201d and \u201cEmpire\u201d fame posted a video of a young man appearing to be the target of bullying outside a Philadelphia store. The 20-year-old was Maurice Willoughby, an aspiring rapper who had faced a backlash after declaring his love for his transgender girlfriend.\n\n\u201cI felt like it was time to put myself in the place of that young man,\u201d Yoba said in an interview Tuesday. \u201cIf I could admit that publicly, other people would have permission to do the same.\u201d\n\nYoba\u2019s profession of his attraction to transgender women comes at a time when discussions about black men\u2019s masculinity, sexuality and shame have garnered more attention following Willoughby\u2019s death. Making the declaration at his own behest and without other sources claiming to have knowledge of his attraction is possibly a first among high-profile black male celebrities.\n\nYoba\u2019s acknowledgment is an important step toward demarginalizing transgender people, said Tricia Rose, chancellor\u2019s professor of Africana studies at Brown University.\n\n\u201cIt blurs the presumed bright line between trans and heterosexuality,\u201d she said.\n\nYoba\u2019s public acknowledgment of his attraction to transgender women serves to affirm the womanhood of transgender women, said Marquis Bey, an assistant professor of African American studies at Northwestern University.\n\n\u201cFor a celebrity to profess an attraction to trans women works to assert the gendered validity of trans women as not only women but women worthy of non-fetishistic desire,\u201d he said.\n\nThe cheers and derision that met Yoba were followed by an allegation from a transgender woman who said she had engaged in sexual activity with the actor when she was a minor and a sex worker, allegations Yoba has denied.\n\nEarlier this year, Willoughby professed his love for his transgender girlfriend on Facebook, captioning a picture of them that read: \u201cY\u2019all can say whatever about Faith I really don\u2019t care if she not passable I don\u2019t care if she wasn\u2019t born a woman she is a woman to me & I love her flaws that\u2019s what makes her faith if you heard her story it\u2019s motivating. \u2026 I\u2019m happy you should be happy for me.\u201d\n\nAttacks on Willoughby followed, both online and in person, including an instance that was caught on camera in which men scornfully question his sexual behavior with transgender women.\n\nWilloughby\u2019s girlfriend said on an Instagram live stream last month that he had died. James Garrow, spokesman for the Philadelphia Department of Public Health, said the medical examiner has not issued a final ruling on the cause of death.\n\nYoba captioned the video and an article about Willoughby\u2019s death to call attention to the unacceptable behavior. He announced he would attend the National Trans Visibility March in Washington later this month and said he finds himself attracted to transgender women.\n\n\u201cI too have felt the self-imposed shame that comes with that truth, but it\u2019s time to speak up,\u201d he said in the caption. The post has since been deleted from Yoba\u2019s account.\n\nYoba followed up with another now-deleted Instagram post on Labor Day in which he thanked people who had reached out to him in support of his public acknowledgment, apologized to his three children for the \u201cfoul messages\u201d they\u2019ve been receiving since his posting and reiterated his support of transgender men and women.\n\nThe comments on the two posts ranged from expressions of thanks for his honesty to homophobic slurs.\n\nShortly after Yoba declared his attraction and support, a transgender woman wrote a Facebook post claiming that she had a sexual relationship with the actor when she was a teenage sex worker in New York decades ago. She alleged that Yoba paid her for sexual favors when she was 13 and 16 years old.\n\nIn a subsequent video, the woman said she chose to share her story \u201cbecause he decided to say something,\u201d noting that Yoba wasn\u2019t the only celebrity client who had cruised the street where she worked in search of transgender women.\n\nThe woman did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The Washington Post generally does not identify victims of alleged sexual offenses without their consent.\n\nWhile Yoba\u2019s admission can be seen as revelatory, his declaration that he is being open and authentic could be countered if there is any truth to the allegation against him.\n\nBey said that if the allegation against Yoba is true, then it is a testament to the way black sexuality is linked to societal scrutiny and spectacle.\n\n\u201cShame and stigma surrounding black cis male attraction to trans women is symptomatic of the general invalidating criticism black sex and sexuality is accosted by,\u201d he said.\n\nYoba denies the woman\u2019s allegations and says he doesn\u2019t know who she is.\n\nThe actor said that he expected people to say \u201ccrazy\u201d things after his posts but that he didn\u2019t anticipate such allegations.\n\nThe accusation, he said, is a cry for help and an indication of the issues facing transgender youth: homelessness and sex work.\n\nAbout 40 percent of homeless youth identify as LGBT, according to a 2012 Williams Institute report.\n\nA December 2015 survey of 694 transgender adults found that nearly 11 percent reported participating in sex work, and an additional 2.3 percent indicated they had traded sex for rent or a place to stay.\n\nMarissa Miller, lead strategic director for the National Trans Visibility March, said not enough is known about the accusation for march leaders to issue a statement.\n\nThe main agenda, Miller said, is the march and the 8,000 people who are expected to attend.\n\n\u201cFor me, knowing what my intention is and the work that I\u2019ve done, for someone to play in that space and try to defame, vilify [and] take a moment to do that, is heartbreaking,\u201d Yoba said.\n\nIf there is an allegation of wrongdoing on Yoba\u2019s part, a report should be filed, according to Sgt. Jessica McRorie, a spokeswoman for the New York Police Department.\n\n\u201cThe NYPD takes child abuse, sexual assaults and rape cases extremely seriously, and urges anyone who has been a victim to file a report so we can perform a comprehensive investigation, and offer support and services to survivors,\u201d she said in a statement.\n\nYoba said he\u2019s not letting the \u201cfoolishness\u201d that followed his announcement detract from the purpose of the march or his pursuit to improve the lives of transgender Americans.\n\nHe is co-hosting a workshop during the weekend of the march about what love looks like for transgender people with transgender TV personality and model Carmen Carrera \u2014 a friend who inspired him to live his life more authentically after they hung out on a float at a recent Pride Day parade, he said.\n\nHe is also negotiating a deal in Harlem that would provide housing for LGBT youths of color, he said.\n\nYoba said closeted transgender people and men who \u201clove a little bit more fluidly\u201d have reached out, often using the word \u201cbrave.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat comes from a very deep place for a lot of people,\u201d he said.\n\nRead more:\n\nTransgender women said they were being harassed at a bar.
