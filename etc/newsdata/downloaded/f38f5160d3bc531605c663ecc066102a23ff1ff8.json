Parliament TV via REUTERS\n\nThe speaker was Jeremy Corbyn, then a backbench Member of Parliament (MP) on the hard left of the Labour Party. He was addressing a rally against the European Union\u2019s Lisbon Treaty that gave Brussels greater powers.\n\nToday, Corbyn is his party\u2019s leader and he is fighting a very different campaign: Preventing Prime Minister Boris Johnson leading Britain out of the EU, \u201cdo or die,\u201d on Oct. 31.\n\nCorbyn\u2019s journey \u2013 from Eurosceptic to last line of defence against leaving the EU without a withdrawal agreement, from Socialist rebel to leader of an opposition united against Johnson \u2013 is among the most improbable in modern British history.\n\nIn a backbench career spanning more than three decades, Corbyn voted against his own Labour Party over 400 times. He became Labour Party leader in 2015.\n\nCorbyn was at his most rebellious during fellow Labour member Tony Blair\u2019s premiership in 1997-2007, opposing closer economic and political ties with the EU, which is viewed by some on the hard left as a \u201ccapitalist club,\u201d and voting against the U.S.-led wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\nHe has called members of Hamas and Hezbollah \u201cfriends.\u201d He once described the North Atlantic Treaty Organization as a \u201cmilitary Frankenstein.\u201d Corbyn\u2019s Labour is being investigated for anti-Semitism by Britain\u2019s human rights watchdog after a surge in complaints since Corbyn took office. Labour has said it will cooperate fully with the inquiry and Corbyn has promised to tackle the \u201cpoison\u201d of anti-Semitism.\n\nLabour MP Neil Coyle, who backed Corbyn to become party leader in 2015, sums up why for many people he is a divisive figure, and why he came to regret lending Corbyn his support: \u201cHe has 30 years of baggage on dodgy issues,\u201d Coyle told Reuters.\n\nCorbyn, 70, declined to be interviewed for this article. Reuters spoke to half a dozen people who know Corbyn well, including some of his closest allies, and reviewed past speeches, his parliamentary voting record, and overseas trips to paint a picture of the man who could be Britain\u2019s prime minister after an election expected in weeks.\n\nColleagues described a principled politician with little personal ambition who became the Left\u2019s candidate for the Labour Party leadership in 2015 simply \u201cbecause it was his turn,\u201d a political activist more than a parliamentarian, a firm believer in the redistribution of wealth and drawn to any \u201cliberation struggle.\u201d\n\nSince becoming leader, Corbyn has appeared to change tack on some issues. He has said he opposes leaving the EU on terms that will hurt ordinary Britons and believes any \u201cBrexit\u201d deal must be put to a popular vote. He has supported Britain\u2019s commitment to NATO and said he regrets calling members of Hamas and Hezbollah friends.\n\nCorbyn\u2019s opponents are unconvinced. They believe he still harbours dangerous, hard left views on the economy and foreign policy. Corbyn has a deep-rooted antipathy to Brussels that is unlikely to have changed, these people say. One of Britain\u2019s longest-serving and most respected MPs, Ken Clarke, has known Corbyn for 30 years. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t modify his views,\u201d observed Clarke, a former Conservative minister.\n\nThe Labour leader\u2019s critics, including some within the party, say he hasn\u2019t done enough to challenge anti-Semitism.\n\nTHE MAKING OF THE MAN\n\nCorbyn grew up in a middle class family in the rural English county of Shropshire. His father, David, was an electrical engineer. His mother, Naomi, taught maths. Corbyn\u2019s parents met in the 1930s at a local meeting in support of the Spanish Republic against Franco\u2019s fascist rule. They shaped Corbyn\u2019s Socialist beliefs.\n\n\u201cBoth committed Socialists and peace campaigners, my mum\u2019s inspiration was to encourage girls to believe they could achieve anything in their lives,\u201d Corbyn said in a speech to the Labour Party conference in 2016.\n\nDennis Skinner worked alongside Corbyn in the Labour Party\u2019s Socialist Campaign Group of left-wing lawmakers. One of nine children, and the son of a miner, Skinner embodies Labour\u2019s working class roots.\n\nSkinner said Corbyn came from a very different Socialist household. \u201cThey probably didn\u2019t sit around a table with four or five brothers all arguing the toss about this, that or the other. I can imagine his father would say, \u2018Now it\u2019s your turn Jeremy, do you want to make a contribution?\u2019\u201d\n\nWhen he was 15, Corbyn joined the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, an advocacy group that wants the UK to get rid of its nuclear weapons and opposes NATO. He would later become vice president of the disarmament group, a position he still holds.\n\nAt the age of 19, Corbyn became a teacher in Jamaica, then travelled around Latin America \u2013 the start of an enduring fascination with the region. It was the late 1960s, when leftist groups were on the rise. Corbyn was in Santiago, he has said, when \u201cthe great\u201d Salvador Allende and his Popular Unity party were readying for power. Last December, Corbyn flew to Mexico for the inauguration of leftist President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who has called Corbyn his \u201ceternal friend.\u201d Corbyn\u2019s third wife is Mexican lawyer and activist Laura \u00c1lvarez.\n\nON THE BACK BENCHES\n\nCorbyn was elected to parliament in 1983 as MP for London\u2019s Islington North, a patchwork district of multi-million pound Georgian homes and social housing. He has increased his majority from just over 5,000 in 1983 to more than 33,000 now. Friend and ally Jon Lansman says Corbyn cares deeply about his constituents.\n\n\u201cHe did a lot of stuff on housing, on migration, poverty, benefits,\u201d said Lansman, who worked on Corbyn\u2019s Labour leadership campaign in 2015 and co-founded Momentum, a pro-Corbyn movement.\n\nMike Gapes, a former Labour MP who now represents a small, centrist party, was also on the Left of Britain\u2019s politics in those early days. Like Corbyn, Gapes voted in a 1975 referendum to leave the forerunner of the EU, the European Economic Area. \u201cWe wanted to introduce import controls in the siege economy, a form of Socialism in one country,\u201d Gapes said.\n\nOver the years, Gapes went on, \u201cmany of us moved on from those delusions\u201d but a few kept the faith. \u201cOne of them was Jeremy Corbyn.\u201d\n\nRonnie Campbell, MP for the northeastern English constituency of Blyth Valley, first met Corbyn in 1987 and remembers how the new MP\u2019s scruffy appearance, in particular his refusal to wear a tie, challenged parliamentary tradition. \u201cThe Tories would get up and say, \u2018Mr Speaker, there\u2019s somebody in this chamber not properly dressed.\u2019 And it was Jeremy sitting in the back with no tie.\u201d\n\nCampbell described Corbyn as an \u201cinquisitive\u201d man who would talk to pretty much any protest or rebel group because he wanted to \u201chear it from the horse\u2019s mouth.\u201d Some of his meetings got Corbyn into trouble. He drew all-party criticism for inviting Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams to parliament in 1984 at the height of violence in Northern Ireland. Sinn Fein was the political arm of the Irish Republican Army that fought a decades-long war against British rule.\n\nCampbell said some of Corbyn\u2019s allies were \u201cmortified\u201d when they found out he was talking to Adams. Corbyn responded, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get to know what their cause is and what they want, and that was his argument at the time,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to try and understand these people.\u201d\n\nCorbyn was one of the sponsors of the Stop the War Coalition, a campaign group set up in 2001 when George W. Bush announced the \u201cwar on terror.\u201d Stop the War says it opposes the British establishment\u2019s \u201cdisastrous addiction to war.\u201d\n\nCorbyn has spoken openly about his \u201cdifficulties\u201d with Tony Blair, who became Labour Party leader in 1994 and prime minister in 1997. Blair distanced Labour from its Socialist roots and drew the party towards the middle ground. Blair also backed Bush\u2019s invasion of Iraq.\n\nIn 2015 at a question-and-answer session, Corbyn was asked by an audience member whether he shared any of Blair\u2019s qualities. \u201cTony Blair and I were never close,\u201d he said to laughter. \u201cI am sorry, I have a lot of difficulties with Tony Blair.\u201d Corbyn listed his reasons: Blair\u2019s \u201cobsession\u201d with selling off state-owned industry and \u201cwith being very close to the U.S. and the neo-Cons, the war in Iraq, and all the problems that have come as a result of that.\u201d Blair has said he believes it was the right decision to join the war in Iraq.\n\nCORBYN\u2019S TURN\n\nThe Socialist Campaign Group had tried and failed to get one of its members on the Labour leadership ballot for years. At a meeting of the group in 2015, one of Corbyn\u2019s closest allies, John McDonnell, persuaded Corbyn to enter the Labour leadership contest. McDonnell has since become Labour\u2019s finance policy chief. Campbell recalled McDonnell telling Corbyn: \u201cIt\u2019s your turn anyway. Get on the paper, at least try to get on the paper. And Jeremy said, \u2018OK, I\u2019ll have a bash at it\u2019.\u201d\n\nLansman said Corbyn was a good choice because he \u201cdidn\u2019t have any enemies. Everybody liked him. He was seen as a principled guy, no kind of side to him.\u201d\n\nCorbyn\u2019s expectations of getting the required 35 nominations were so low that he had no qualms about agreeing, people close to him said. To the surprise of many, he passed the threshold.\n\nIn the contest that followed, Corbyn\u2019s criticism of U.S. influence and Conservative austerity policies, introduced after the 2008 global financial crisis, won over many young voters. Labour Party membership surged, and in September 2015 Corbyn won the leadership with almost 60% of the vote.\n\nBut Corbyn\u2019s Socialist agenda alienated Labour MPs in parliament. Many of them occupied the centre ground and were loyal to the ideals of Blair, one of Labour\u2019s most successful post-war leaders.\n\nCoyle, one of the MPs who nominated Corbyn, declared less than a year later that he regretted his backing, having concluded Corbyn was a weak leader with a mistaken sense of priorities. There were resignations among Corbyn\u2019s parliamentary team. Health policy chief Heidi Alexander was the first to quit in June 2016.\n\n\u201cAs much as I respect you as a man of principle, I do not believe you have the capacity to shape the answers our country is demanding, and I believe that if we are to form the next government, a change of leadership is essential,\u201d she wrote in her resignation letter.\n\nCorbyn defeated what his supporters called a disgraceful coup attempt by MPs. Labour Party members re-elected him as party leader in September 2016.\n\nCHARGES OF ANTI-SEMITISM\n\nDuring Corbyn\u2019s time as leader, Labour has been beset by accusations of anti-Semitism. In May, Britain\u2019s Equality and Human Rights Commission said it was launching an investigation into whether Labour has discriminated against, harassed or victimised people because they are Jewish.\n\nThe commission acted after receiving \u201ca number of complaints and allegations of anti-Semitism in the party.\u201d It said its inquiry would seek to determine whether the party or its employees had committed unlawful acts and whether the party had responded to complaints efficiently and effectively.\n\nCorbyn has said he is determined to \u201cconfront this poison\u201d of anti-Semitism. But he has also drawn criticism that his own comments and actions have created a space for anti-Semitism to flourish.\n\nIn March 2018, Corbyn apologised for sending a supportive message to the creator of a London mural after local officials ordered it should be destroyed. The mural depicted Jewish bankers playing Monopoly on the backs of the poor. Corbyn conceded the image was \u201cdeeply disturbing and anti-Semitic.\u201d In August 2018, he apologised over an event he hosted in 2010 where a speaker compared Israel to Nazism. That same month, a photograph emerged from a trip by Corbyn to Tunisia in 2014. It showed Corbyn at a ceremony where the perpetrators of the 1972 Munich massacre of Israeli Olympic athletes were honoured by a Palestinian delegation. Corbyn said he was there as part of a wider event about Middle East peace and wasn\u2019t involved in the ceremony.\n\nMP Luciana Berger quit Labour earlier this year, saying the party had become \u201cinstitutionally antisemitic.\u201d She was one of nine Labour MPs who left the party within one week saying it had been \u201chijacked by the machine politics of the hard left.\u201d The MPs also accused the party leadership of \u201cbeing complicit in facilitating Brexit.\u201d Corbyn expressed disappointment at their decision.\n\nCorbyn, a lifelong peace campaigner, has changed tack on defence.\n\nThroughout his decades on the parliamentary back benches, he questioned why NATO wasn\u2019t dismantled after the Cold War and accused the alliance of forcing member states to spend heavily on arms that perpetuate war. He consistently argued against Britain\u2019s nuclear weapons system, Trident.\n\nBut in a foreign policy speech in 2017, Corbyn said it was vital that Britain maintained \u201ca close relationship with our European partners alongside our commitment to NATO.\u201d And he now accepts the Labour Party\u2019s long-standing policy to maintain Trident, although says he remains committed to achieving a \u201cnuclear-free world\u201d and would not use such weapons.\n\nLabour\u2019s foreign affairs policy chief, Emily Thornberry, explained that Corbyn has \u201cbeen on a journey\u201d since becoming party leader. Critics say he is playing hide-and-seek with his policies, appearing to agree with the party line while not bending on his long-held views. \u201cHe really hasn\u2019t moved on much,\u201d said Coyle.\n\nCorbyn is at his most confident when criticising the government over economic austerity. He has vowed to break with the public spending curbs of successive administrations and create a Britain for \u201cthe many, not the few.\u201d\n\nIn the country\u2019s 2017 general election, he campaigned to bring key sectors of the economy under state control \u2013 the railways, the postal service and some public utilities, such as water. He promised greater investment in public services, including healthcare and education. He said he would raise taxation for the top 5% of earners. Students would no longer have to pay for their university education.\n\nMore recently, Labour announced plans to redistribute wealth by forcing companies with more than 250 employees to transfer 10% of their shares to workers.\n\nThe Labour Party manifesto was credited along with Corbyn\u2019s energetic campaign with winning considerably more votes than Corbyn\u2019s detractors believed was possible, cementing his position as party leader. Lansman says there is no turning back. \u201cWe want to change the party and change the country and that is a long-term project.\u201d", "description": "In 2009, a little-known British politician declared he didn't want to live in a European empire of the 21st century.", "authors": ["Elizabeth Piper", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190909&t=2&i=1427903492&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF880W0", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
