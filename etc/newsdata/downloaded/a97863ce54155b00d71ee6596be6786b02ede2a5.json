In one instance earlier this year, the city was at level zero for seven hours and 40 minutes.\n\nSpeaking to CBC, the city's emergency services manager, Anthony Di Monte, laid the blame squarely on The Ottawa Hospital, which he blamed for holding paramedics \"hostage\" and contributing to increasing morbidity and mortality rates.\n\nNew measures\n\nThe Ottawa Hospital did not directly address Di Monte's comments, but did acknowledge the city's report on the matter, also released Monday.\n\n\"We welcome this report as it shows that by working together, we can find better solutions to decrease ambulance offload times and provide the best care possible for patients in our community,\" said Dr. Guy Hebert, head of emergency medicine at The Ottawa Hospital, in a statement.\n\nWhile paramedics aim to transfer patients over to hospital staff within 30 minutes, it's typically taking closer to 90 minutes at The Ottawa Hospital's Civic and General campuses.\n\nIt typically takes paramedics 90 minutes to hand patients over to The Ottawa Hospital - three times longer than the target. (Danny Globerman/CBC News)\n\nHebert referred to current pilot projects aimed at reducing the amount of time ambulances must wait to transfer patients. For example, dedicating emergency room nurses to that task could take the pressure off other staff.\n\n\"There remains a lot of hard work ahead even as we implement these new measures,\" Hebert wrote. \"Transitioning patients into care in our Emergency Department is a top priority, and we will continue working with our partners to ensure the safe and efficient care of all who need it.\"\n\nLong delays no surprise to paramedics\n\nThe Ottawa Paramedic Association agreed it's up to hospitals to fix the problem.\n\n\"We hear the level zero alarms going off every day in the city, and we're aware that that means that there are no longer any paramedics and ambulances available to respond to 911 calls,\" association president Darryl Wilton said.\n\nThe result, Wilton said, is that patients need to wait longer for care, and neighbouring communities are left without service while their own paramedics answer calls in Ottawa.\n\nWilton said emergency room staff aren't to blame.\n\n\"What we're seeing in the hospitals is that in the emergency department, the physicians and nurses are extremely overworked. They're very, very busy. They have far too many patients,\" Wilton said.\n\nHealth Minister Christine Elliott said the province has taken steps to minimize the impact on people who need critical care, including allowing paramedics to drop off patients at other institutions such as mental health crisis centres.\n\n\"This will help free up hospital beds for patients who need them most, and will get ambulances back on the road faster,\" Elliott said in a statement.\n\nThe government also says it's spending more to grow land ambulance services in Ontario this year and next.\n\nHave you faced long waits for an ambulance, or been rushed to the hospital only to sit on a stretcher for a long period of time? CBC would like to hear about your experience.
