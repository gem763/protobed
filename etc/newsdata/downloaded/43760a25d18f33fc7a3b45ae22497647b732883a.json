We are aware that it will not end.\"\n\nA Russian delegation is currently in Turkey for talks on the border patrols and wider security situation in northeast Syria.\n\nAkar said there were still around 1,000 YPG fighters in the border town of Manbij and a further 1,000 in nearby Tal Rifat. The two towns are located to the west of the strip of territory that Turkey wants to turn into a \"safe zone\" but Syrian and Russian forces are also meant to clear them of YPG forces.\n\nPresident Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said Turkey will act alone to clear northeast Syria of YPG forces if Russia fails to fulfil its obligations under the Sochi accord.\n\nTurkey launched its operation in northeast Syria after President Donald Trump said he was pulling 1,000 US military personnel from the area.\n\n\n\nTurkey's NATO allies, including the US, have criticised Ankara's actions, fearing it will undermine the fight against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL also known as ISIS) group.\n\nThe YPG is the main component in the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which has been a key ally of the US against ISIL.\n\nRussia, a close ally of President Bashar al-Assad, has emerged as the key foreign power in Syria, its influence further bolstered by the withdrawal of US troops from the northeast.", "description": "Sochi agreement reinforces existing US-brokered ceasefire that halted Turkey's operation in northeast Syria.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/29/35dbcefae9fa45b09d58319e37a16481_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
