The apex of the distress occurred on the final pitch of the seventh inning with the Nationals trailing by three runs, as Gerrit Cole\u2019s 110th offering of the night caught the up-and-away portion of the zone \u2013 in Barksdale\u2019s eyes.\n\nThe 3-2 pitch to Nationals outfielder Victor Robles was indeed off the plate, but Barksdale punched him out, abbreviating the Nationals\u2019 most meaningful \"rally\" of the night. Instead of walking to first base with Yan Gomes due up as the tying run, Robles incredulously turned toward Barksdale and then the dugout.\n\nFor as much outrage it caused among the 43,910 fans on hand, the Nats\u2019 dugout was equally incensed. Multiple players and coaches climbed to the top step to voice their displeasure with the call, with manager Dave Martinez among the most animated.\n\nThe emotion from the Nationals skipper had been brewing. In the sixth, reliever Tanner Rainey and catcher Yan Gomes assumed they\u2019d rung up Michael Brantley with a fastball at the knees. Gomes began to throw the ball around the horn, but no strike three call came.\n\n\u201cWake up, c\u2019mon let\u2019s go,\u201d Martinez can be heard barking from the dugout. \u201cIt\u2019s the World Series! Wake up!\u201d\n\nAfter the game, Martinez refused to complain about the umpiring.\n\n\"I will not ever sit here and criticize an umpire,\" he said. \"I've known Lance for a very long time and he's really good. ... I know there were some choice words but that's just in the heat of the moment. But like I said, they're doing their job, and they do it really well. That's why they're an umpire in the World Series. \"\n\nBOO BIRDS:President Donald Trump's World Series visit may be his last \u2013 for good reason\n\nNATIONALS: Washington on the ropes after third straight loss\n\nThe rest of the Nationals clubhouse followed their skipper's lead on the matter.\n\n\u201cLance did not lose us the game tonight,\" first baseman Ryan Zimmerman said. \"Gerrit Cole beat us. I think that\u2019s the best way to put it. I\u2019ve known Lance for a very long time, he\u2019s a really good guy and a good umpire.\n\n\"If you want to talk about the strike zone and stuff, you can go ask him. But I don\u2019t think anyone should blame Lance what happened here tonight.\"\n\nThe closest any National came to criticizing Barksdale was starter Joe Ross' admission he believed an 0-2 slider to Astros shortstop Carlos Correa in the fourth inning was strike three. Barksdale ruled it a ball, Correa fought off the next three pitches and drilled the seventh pitch of the at-bat over the left-field wall to make it 4-0.\n\n\"I feel like as far as baseball goes, something small happens, then seems like later that at-bat always something big follows up,\" Ross said. \"Unfortunately, that\u2019s how it went.\u201d\n\nGomes, who had as good a view as anyone in the ballpark, said looking back won't help the Nationals win the next two games.\n\n\"Frustrating? Sure, but that's a hindsight thing,\" Gomes said. \"It\u2019s one of those things \u2013 everyone\u2019s human out there. We don\u2019t have the little box that everyone sees (on television).\n\n\"I\u2019m not gonna talk about the umpires or anything like that. Everyone\u2019s human, we\u2019re out there trying to do our best jobs.\"\n\nFollow Chris Bumbaca on Twitter @BOOMbaca.", "description": "Home plate umpire Lance Barskdale made several calls the Washington Nationals disagreed with during Game 5 of the World Series, and they let him know.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/10/28/USAT/13a0616f-3a09-48c4-856c-09729d2961a6-EPA_USA_BASEBALL_MLB_WORLD_SERIES.JPG?crop=4867,2738,x0,y124&width=3200&height=1973&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
