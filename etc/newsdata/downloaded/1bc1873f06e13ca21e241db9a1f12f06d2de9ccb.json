N. gretae doesn\u2019t have eyes or wings either and is one of the smallest known free-living animals, according to the Natural History Museum.\n\nAlthough the species of beetle has been around since 1965, when it was discovered in soil and leaf litter in Nairobi, Kenya, it has since been nameless. A sample has been in the hands of the Natural History Museum since 1978, alongside its full collection of over 22 million beetles. The museum welcomed the naming of this specific antennaed species when scientist Dr. Michael Darby analysed the collection.\n\nExplaining the reasons behind his decision, Darby commented, \u201cI chose this name as I am immensely impressed with the work of this young campaigner and wanted to acknowledge her outstanding contribution in raising awareness of environmental issues.\u201d\n\nN. gretae is now official after it was formally named in the Entomologist's Monthly Magazine, which charts all insects and \u2018terrestrial arthropods\u2019 from Britain and worldwide.\n\nThe Natural History Museum\u2019s senior curator in charge of beetles, Dr. Max Barclay, commented on the apposite nature of the new name. He applauded the decision to honour Greta Thunberg, saying she was someone who \u201chas worked so hard to champion the natural world and protect vulnerable species.\u201d\n\nNelloptodes gretae is in good company at The Natural History Museum, next to another species of Ptiliidae named after David Attenborough.\n\nAre Beetles going extinct?\n\nInsects play a vital role in our ecosystems, performing many important functions. They pollinate blossoms, get rid of plant pests and feed on dead animals and fallen trees. The latter most applies to beetles, who recycling nutrients back into the soil. \u201cIf they weren\u2019t around, the amount of decay and rot all over the place would be terrible\u201d, says National Geographic.\n\nThe New Scientist journal published a worrying report earlier this year warning that a huge global extinction for insects was at risk. Over 40% of insect species could reportedly be extinct in the next few decades, with butterflies, dung beetles and bees most at risk.\n\nThe main reason cited was loss of habitat. Other factors that affect our insect wildlife populations include pollution, carbon emissions and the pesticides used on farms.\n\nWhen it comes to beetles in particular, the risk is to do with a decline in ancient trees around the world. Most beetles survive on rotting wood. According to a study in the Guardian, 18% of saproxylic beetles are now classed as \u201cvulnerable\u201d and \u201ccritically endangered\u201d as a species.", "description": "The Natural History Museum in London has chosen to honour the young climate campaigner.", "authors": ["Maeve Campbell"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/25/95/08/1000x563_cmsv2_982c016b-224d-5d17-b634-b07a1811ba8d-4259508.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
