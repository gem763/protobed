Two people were also killed during protests on Monday.\n\nProtest organizers said they organized peaceful demonstrations in Baghdad and other cities that did not become chaotic until security forces attacked them. The United Nations called on the authorities to exercise more restraint, while angry Iraqis demanded an explanation for the use of excessive force from Prime Minister Adil Abd Al-Mahdi and other top officials.\n\nAl-Mahdi responded with allegations that protesters threw firebombs at security officers, stabbed them with knives, and \u201cpillaged\u201d public property. The Iraqi parliament announced it would begin investigating the situation with both its defense and human rights committees.\n\nA statement from parliament on Wednesday recognized \u201cthe freedom of peaceful protests that the constitution has guaranteed\u201d and urged security forces to \u201cpreserve public order while controlling themselves and not use excessive force on protesters,\u201d while several current and former lawmakers explicitly criticized the Al-Mahdi administration for failing to respect the rights of protesters.\n\nThe protests were met by a heavy security presence, including armored vehicles. Streets were blocked and social media was shut down as Iraq faced one of its worst bouts of widespread political instability since the fall of Saddam Hussein. Demonstrations this week have included increasingly forceful calls for the complete overthrow of the government in Baghdad.\n\nThe demonstrations were initially driven by economic woes, including high levels of unemployment, which Iraqis find difficult to reconcile with hearty national oil industry. Allegations of corruption swirled and curdled into public fury when badly-maintained public services failed. Electricity has been spotty in Baghdad and other big cities, and the water faucets don\u2019t work as reliably as the police water cannons.\n\nOne particular event that angered the protest movement was the surprise sacking last week of popular counter-terrorism commander Abdul-Wahab al-Saadi, widely credited with playing a leading role in the defeat of the Islamic State and the liberation of Mosul.\n\nSaadi, who was essentially demoted and sent back to a desk job in Baghdad, described his treatment as \u201chumiliating\u201d and challenged Al-Mahdi\u2019s authority to dismiss him.\n\nA great deal of the Iraqi public rallied to Saadi\u2019s side, furious at the ingratitude of pushing him aside along with several other commanders seen as political adversaries of the Iran-backed Shiite militia known as the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF). Saadi has good relations with the U.S. military, and Washington has been pressuring Al-Mahdi to reduce the influence of the PMF as it grows increasingly hostile to American interests, so Saadi\u2019s dismissal looks like a power play by Iran and its allies in Iraq.\n\nKurdish news service Rudaw interviewed some Iraqi protesters on Tuesday, and came across a group of PMF fighters who complained they are not supported or paid by Baghdad despite playing what they saw as a vital role in fighting ISIS and securing \u201cthe rights of the deprived people.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no public employment. We are tired of the state. Nothing works. There is no paving, no electricity,\u201d one of the protesters told Rudaw.\n\nAmong those calling for an investigation of police conduct was Moqtada al-Sadr, the most influential Shiite cleric in Iraq.\n\nThe Iraqi Foreign Ministry on Tuesday temporarily closed the Iraqi consulate in the Iranian city of Mashhad, apparently because some Iraqi diplomats in the city were attacked on the street while protests were raging back in Iraq.\n\nVarious regional media outlets reporting on the Iraq protests expressed surprise that they seemed entirely organic and leaderless despite having appeared in force virtually overnight.", "description": "Massive demonstrations were held in Baghdad on Wednesday against corruption, government inefficiency, and high unemployment.", "authors": ["John Hayward"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1172802283-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
