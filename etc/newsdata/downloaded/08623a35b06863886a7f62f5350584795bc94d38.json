It was incredibly disappointing,\" admitted Schmidt.\n\nHe said he felt his team was \"a bit flat\" and pointed the finger at some of the injuries his squad had suffered, meaning that the team was not settled until late in the week.\n\nHowever, he also paid tribute to the All Blacks, who were ruthless in capitalising on Irish mistakes to set up a mouthwatering semi-final with England.\n\n\"We could have played really well and they might still have gone over the top of us. They were stifling they made it very hard for us to breathe,\" he said.\n\nIt was also the 124th and last time in an Ireland shirt for captain Rory Best, who received a rousing and sustained ovation from Irish fans despite the crushing defeat.\n\nThe Ulsterman finishes his career as Ireland's third-most capped player and the most capped forward, behind only legendary centre Brian O'Driscoll and fly-half Ronan O'Gara.\n\nIn touching scenes after the game, the hooker led his team through a tunnel of both sets of players then brought his children onto the pitch to soak up the cheers for the final time.\n\nAsked how he felt, he replied: \"Right now, tired, sore, upset.\"\n\n\"We have a lot of big characters in that changing room and it's not often you get a changing room in dead silence. There were big men in tears and that's what happens when you put your heart and soul into everything,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm unbelievably upset with the thought that I'll never put on a green jersey again except to go and support,\" he said, his voice catching.\n\nSchmidt acknowledged that his record would be tinged with never getting past a World Cup quarter-final and stressed that his team had focused all their efforts on that, even during the Six Nations.\n\nBut he hoped that his work with Ireland - including two historic wins over the All Blacks - would be looked on favourably.\n\n\"I think when I get some distance to reflect, I think it's 75-odd Test matches and we've won 75 percent of them,\" he said.\n\n\"There have been some incredibly good days and I don't think they get washed away by two defeats and days where we're incredibly disappointed.\"", "description": "Departing Ireland coach Joe Schmidt said he was \"heartbroken\" at his team's humiliating 46-14 defeat against New Zealand.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9379/0090b61cefd44192af46d9da5dbafe0d.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
