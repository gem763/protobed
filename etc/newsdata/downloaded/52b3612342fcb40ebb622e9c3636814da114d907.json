Workers also participated in their own rally at a public park, braving strong winds and storm clouds as a typhoon threatened.\n\nNearly three months of youth-dominated protests \u2014 calling for democracy and an independent inquiry into police conduct \u2014 will be tested as classes resume after the summer break in the semiautonomous Chinese territory.\n\nThe young protesters strove to demonstrate their continued determination with Monday's school boycott, the first of a planned two-day strike.\n\nJacky So, president of the Chinese University of Hong Kong's student union, said 30,000 students attended a rally on campus. They dressed in black and wore face masks, waving banners for their student associations and black signs with the Chinese character for \"Strike.\"\n\nSeparately, high school students who were skipping class rallied in Edinburgh Place, a public square in Hong Kong's central business district. Teenagers spoke to the crowd from a stage with a backdrop that read: \"With no future, there's no need to go to class.\"\n\nProtesters wearing masks of French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Japan Prime Minister Shinzo Abe display a banner during a rally at Tamar Park in Hong Kong on Monday.

The appeals are undergirded by a sense among some Hong Kong residents that the Communist Party-ruled mainland government has been eroding the autonomy and civil liberties promised when the former British colony was returned to China in 1997.\n\nSome demonstrators disrupted the morning commute on Monday by blocking train doors, attempting to evade riot police hot on their heels by moving quickly between multiple public transit stations.\n\nAn elderly man implores police not to charge at Tung Chung MTR train station in Hong Kong on Sunday.

Three others were arrested at Lai King station.\n\nOn Sunday, the MTR Corp. suspended train service to the airport after several hundred protesters gathered there following calls online to disrupt transportation. They blocked buses arriving at the airport but police in riot helmets kept them out of the terminal. Some protesters hurled bricks and metal poles onto the tracks of the Airport Express rail line, police said, prompting train services to be suspended and forcing some travellers to walk some distance to the airport.\n\nWatch a report from CBC's Adrienne Arsenault from Hong Kong here:\n\nProtests in Hong Kong are in their 13th straight week, and there is no sign of them slowing down. Initially a fight over an extradition bill, now the movement is asking for accountability for police brutality and universal suffrage. Adrienne Arsenault reports from Hong Kong. 9:00\n\nVideos show police using batons, pepper spray\n\nLate Saturday, video from Hong Kong broadcaster TVB showed police on the platform of Prince Edward subway station swinging batons at passengers who backed into one end of a train car behind umbrellas. The video also shows pepper spray being shot through an open door at a group seated on the floor while one man holds up his hands.\n\nPolice officers said at a briefing Monday they rejected accusations they \"beat up\" ordinary citizens without first confirming their identities. They said they specifically targeted those who they believed to be rioters, including those who had changed out of their black protester outfits, and arrested 63 people on suspicion of illegal assembly and possessing explosives and offensive weapons.\n\nMedical staff hold placards after they form a human chain to express solidarity with anti-extradition bill protesters during their lunch break at the Queen Mary Hospital in Hong Kong on Sunday.

Authorities in turn have employed water cannons, tear gas, rubber bullets and batons.\n\nThe protesters say a degree of violence is necessary to get the government's attention after peaceful rallies were futile. Lam's administration, however, maintains that the violence must first end before any fruitful dialogue can begin.\n\n\"We always say that we must stop the violence right away, and then kick off the dialogue,\" said Administration Secretary Matthew Cheung Kin-Chung.", "description": "Clad in gas masks along with their formal white school uniforms, tens of thousands of students in Hong Kong boycotted the first day of classes Monday as part of a citywide strike following a violent weekend of demonstrations.", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5267715.1567421304!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/1165620666.jpg"}
