REUTERS/Philippe Wojazer\n\nBreton, who was France\u2019s finance minister under late President Jacques Chirac, has been chief executive at technology group Atos since 2009 and led the turnaround of telecoms giant Orange (ORAN.PA) in the early 2000s.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s man of action who knows industrial issues inside out and who, while knowing Brussels institutions, will not have a bureaucratic approach to European issues, which is important for the president,\u201d an Elysee official said.\n\nTwo weeks ago European lawmakers rejected Sylvie Goulard, Macron\u2019s initial pick for European Commissioner, causing anger in Paris, where officials blamed German conservatives in the EU parliament.\n\nChoosing a pro-European conservative will help to get the proposed appointment past the European People\u2019s Party (EPP) in parliament, said Tara Varma, head of the Paris branch of the ECFR think-tank.\n\n\u201cHis nomination shouldn\u2019t be blocked by the EPP, which Macron couldn\u2019t afford now,\u201d she told Reuters. \u201cIt is probably the best tactical decision.\u201d\n\nThe French leader, who is keen to preserve the huge portfolio he negotiated with incoming European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen, is looking to move on from what he called a \u201cpolitical crisis\u201d and has sought assurances from her that the new candidate would be approved.\n\n\u201cThe portfolio will remain unchanged,\u201d the presidential aide said.\n\nEach EU member state nominates a Commission candidate who must then pass a confirmation hearing in the European Parliament.\n\nDespite his conservative background, Breton backed Macron during his 2017 campaign even before the first round of the presidential election.\n\n\u201cI appreciate, for Europe and all our fellow European citizens, the importance of the challenges associated with this portfolio for the future of our continent,\u201d Breton told analysts in a call as he announced he would step down at Atos on Oct. 31.\n\nBreton\u2019s long career in the private sector is likely to come under scrutiny in the parliamentary hearings.\n\nThe Elysee said Breton had always recused himself as a minister whenever matters regarding the companies he worked with came on the government agenda and would certainly do the same in his new functions to avoid any conflict of interest.", "description": "France has proposed Atos chief executive Thierry Breton as its candidate for head of industrial policy at the European Commission, President Emmanuel Macron's office said on Thursday after his first choice was rejected by EU lawmakers.", "authors": ["Michel Rose", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444379469&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N0C4", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
