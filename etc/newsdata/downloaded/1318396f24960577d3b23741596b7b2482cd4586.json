Proroguing parliament is the legal and necessary way of delivering this,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nIn a regular briefing for journalists, the prime minister\u2019s official spokesman insisted that it was \u201cabsolutely not\u201d the view of the government that the Scottish court\u2019s decision was politically-motivated adding that the government had \u201cabsolute respect for the independence of the judiciary.\u201d\n\nThe government would abide by any Supreme Court decision, the spokesman said. If the decision is that a new date for parliament\u2019s return is required, a fresh Privy Council process, whereby ministers advise the Queen on prorogation, would be required.\n\nIndependent MP and former attorney general Dominic Grieve said the ruling in Edinburgh is a \u201cserious indictment\u201d on the government and added that parliament should be sitting again within 24 hours.\n\n\u201cI would hope that the government would now realize the extent of the crisis it\u2019s created and recall parliament immediately. It would be much more sensible that the government should simply say we are dropping the Supreme Court case\u2019s appeals on both sides, parliament will sit, and arrange for us to sit within the next 24 hours,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, a spokeswoman for the House of Commons speaker\u2019s office said that \u201cany decision to accelerate the meeting of parliament during prorogation is a matter for the government.\u201d\n\nIn a separate case arguing the prorogation is unlawful, led by pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and backed by senior political figures including former Tory Prime Minister John Major, three judges on Wednesday ruled that the prorogation decision was \"purely political\" and could not be challenged in the courts.\n\nThe Supreme Court is due to hear the appeals against both rulings next week.\n\nThis story has been updated", "description": "Anti-Brexit parliamentarians hail the ruling as \u2018historic.\u2019", "authors": ["Cristina Gallardo", "Emilio Casalicchio"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1164772626-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
