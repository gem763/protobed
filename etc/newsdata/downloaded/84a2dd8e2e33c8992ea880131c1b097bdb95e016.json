Exit polls showed Merkel's party had dropped nearly 11 percentage points since the last election.\n\nCo-chair of the Green party Annalena Baerbock said she was \"shocked\" by the result of the AfD party \"whose candidate is a fascist\". Baerbock said it was a tough campaign for the Green party that received just 5.4% of the vote according to two exit polls.\n\nThe election also dealt a significant blow to the Social Democrats who received just 8.6% according to the ARD exit poll. An exit poll by Forschungsgruppe Wahlen (FGW) showed the Social Democrats at 8.3%.\n\nThe AfD surged in two eastern German states, Saxony and Brandenburg in early September. The AfD came second to Merkel's CDU in Saxony and second to the Social Democrats in Brandenburg gaining considerable percentage points since 2014.\n\nThuringia's Prime Minister Bodo Ramelow said that he was proud and pleased about the high turnout - at 65%.\n\nAsked about the AfD result, Ramelow said that AfD regional leader Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6cke was far from being in charge of the government.\n\nH\u00f6cke takes a hardline anti-immigrant stance and has been criticised by mainstream politicians and Jewish leaders for calling Berlin's Holocaust memorial a \"monument of shame\".\n\nThe election comes shortly after a shooting near a synagogue in Halle, Germany that the Interior Minister later classified as an \"anti-semitic attack\".\n\nTwo people died in the shooting that occurred northeast of the state of Thuringia.", "description": "The incumbent far-left Die Linke party won in Thuringia's state election, according to exit polls, while the AfD came ahead of Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/26/16/70/1000x563_cmsv2_56ca5df3-558c-5a09-bbed-e0eb6e0323eb-4261670.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
