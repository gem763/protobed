REUTERS/Toby Melville\n\nIn efforts to reduce the economic impact of Brexit, Britain is looking to line-up a series of trade deals with smaller, non-EU countries.\n\nTruss - who is in the middle of a three-nation tour that includes Australia, New Zealand and Japan - said she expects a quick conclusion to trade talks that will begin when Britain leaves the EU.\n\n\u201cThe reason that I have chosen to make Australia one of the first countries I have visited as trade secretary is because it is an absolute priority to get on with this trade deal,\u201d Truss told reporters in Canberra.\n\n\u201cI would say months rather than years for it to be completed.\u201d\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he will take the country out of the EU on Oct. 31 with or without a deal with Brussels.\n\nBut the British parliament this month passed a law that requires Johnson to ask the EU for a three-month delay to Brexit if a deal is not approved by Oct. 19.\n\nTwo-way trade between Australia and Britain is worth A$26.6 billion ($18.22 billion), Australian data shows.\n\nBritain is Australia\u2019s seventh-largest trading partner, the data shows.\n\nAustralia\u2019s Minister for Trade Simon Birmingham said a trade deal with Britain will particularly benefit the country\u2019s agricultural sector, worth around A$60 billion.\n\n\u201cAs part of the EU, market access to Britain in terms of agricultural products has been limited,\u201d Birmingham told reporters. \u201cThis is something we will look to address.\u201d", "description": "Britain's Trade Minister Liz Truss said on Wednesday she expects to complete a wide-ranging trade deal with Australia within months of exiting the European Union.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190918&t=2&i=1431088636&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8H09S", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
