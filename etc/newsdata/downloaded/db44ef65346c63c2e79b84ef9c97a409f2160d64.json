(AP) - It appeared everything was going the New York Jets\u2019 way for a successful season opener.\n\nLe\u2019Veon Bell looked anything but rusty in his return from a nearly 20-month layoff. C.J. Mosley was making big plays. The defense was causing turnovers and keeping the Buffalo Bills out of the end zone.\n\nThen, just like that, a promising start suddenly deteriorated into a brutal loss.\n\nJosh Allen threw a 38-yard touchdown pass to John Brown with 3 minutes left, and the Bills overcame four early turnovers and rallied from a 16-point second-half deficit to stun the Jets 17-16 on Sunday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re OK, man,\u201d safety Jamal Adams insisted. \u201cIt\u2019s not the end of the world. It\u2019s one loss. We\u2019ll be all right.\u201d\n\nMaybe so, but this certainly wasn\u2019t how the Jets wanted to kick things off in Adam Gase\u2019s debut as coach.\n\nIt was eerily reminiscent of last year\u2019s blown 16-point loss to Tennessee under then-coach Todd Bowles. That Jets team also squandered a 15-point advantage against Green Bay in a season marked by four blown fourth-quarter leads.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s last year\u2019s team,\u201d linebacker Jordan Jenkins said. \u201cHalf the guys that were on the team last year aren\u2019t even here.\u201d\n\nNew faces, new season - but same problem.\n\n\u201cWhen you take a loss like this, it kind of defines you,\u201d said Bell, who ran for 60 yards on 17 carries and had six catches for 32 yards and a touchdown. \u201cWe want to see how guys respond.\u201d\n\nWhile Gase was composed in his postgame news conference, his frustration was clear.\n\n\u201cThat was a little disappointing considering our defense was playing really well in the first half,\u201d Gase said. \u201cThose guys brought great juice and created turnovers. We were just inept on offense, making mistakes that we can\u2019t make to consistently move the ball.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot to clean up there.\u201d\n\nThe Jets took a 16-0 lead with 7:01 left in the third quarter when Darnold hit Bell on a TD pass and a 2-point conversion.\n\n\u201cWhenever you get four-plus turnovers and we\u2019re not turning the ball over as an offense,\u201d Darnold said, \u201cwe\u2019ve got to win that game.\u201d\n\nBut, Buffalo got onto the scoreboard on its next possession on Stephen Hauschka\u2019s 43-yard field goal. It was a drive kept alive by Henry Anderson being called for roughing the passer on third-and-10 from the Jets 49. A diving Marcus Maye also dropped an interception on the play right before Hauschka\u2019s field goal.\n\nMosley also left during the drive with a groin injury, and Gase said he\u2019ll be evaluated. Rookie Quinnen Williams, the No. 3 overall pick, hurt an ankle during the game and was seen leaving the stadium in a walking boot.\n\nMeanwhile, Allen was marching the Bills through a suddenly porous Jets defense, capping an impressive drive by pump-faking, taking off to his right and stepping inside the right-front pylon to make it 16-10 with 10:21 remaining.\n\n\u201cI felt like our energy died, man,\u201d Adams said. \u201cWe weren\u2019t playing team ball. Any time you do that, a team\u2019s going to take advantage of it.\u201d\n\nThe Bills were also able to capitalize on the Jets\u2019 seemingly endless kicking woes.\n\nKaare Vedvik, claimed off waivers from Minnesota last weekend, missed an extra point on the Jets\u2019 first touchdown and was wide right on a 45-yard field goal try.\n\n\u201cIt sucks,\u201d Vedvik said. \u201cEverybody wants to do their part and carry their own part in helping the team win. And a close game like that? Yeah, it was bad.\u201d\n\nGase wouldn\u2019t commit to Vedvik being the Jets\u2019 kicker moving forward, saying only that he\u2019d have \u201ca conversation with the personnel guys.\u201d\n\nThe Jets need to figure that all out, along with moving forward from this loss by next Monday night when they host the Cleveland Browns and try to avoid opening 0-2.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t let one game define our season,\u201d Gase said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to line us up next week and nobody is going to care if we won or lost the week before.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "It appeared everything was going the New York Jets' way for a successful season opener.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Dennis Waszak Jr."], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/08/bills_jets_football_46282_c0-194-4631-2894_s1770x1032.jpg?d83da9526e94199626f17fb8a0f056784e19b050", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
