It lasted for over 30 minutes. Also handed over my \u2018collection\u2019 to Jeyaraj, who is a part of the hotel staff,\" he tweeted.\n\n\"Let us ensure our public places are clean and tidy! Let us also ensure we remain fit and healthy.\"\n\nIndian cities have some of the world's highest levels of atmospheric pollution but they are also among the dirtiest with piles of garbage lying in big centres like Delhi and Mumbai because of rapid urban growth and poor governance.\n\nModi has called for an end to the consumption of single-use plastics by 2022.\n\nConcerns are growing worldwide about plastic pollution, especially in oceans, where nearly 50% of single-use plastic products end up, killing marine life and entering the human food chain, studies have shown.\n\nModi gave a personal tour to Xi of the Shore Temple, dating back to the seventh and eight century and other ancient monuments that are part of UNESCO's world heritage sites and which were emptied of all visitors for the two-day summit.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Sanjeev Miglani; Editing by Shri Navaratnam)", "description": "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi went picking up trash on Saturday from a scenic beach resort where he is hosting Chinese President Xi Jinping for summit talks.
