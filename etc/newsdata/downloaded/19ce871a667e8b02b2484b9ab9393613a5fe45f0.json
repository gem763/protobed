That\u2019s up from six months ago, when 71% of housing markets were unaffordable for average workers.\n\nAttom calculated affordability by determining the amount of income needed to make monthly house payment, such as mortgage, property taxes and insurance premiums. The analysis assumed the homeowner in question only put 3% down when they purchased the property. Attom compared that amount to the average weekly wage data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nThere were only 127 counties out of the nearly 500 that Attom analyzed where a person who earned the average salary could afford to make the housing payments for a median-priced home in their area. Among the parts of the country where this was true were Houston, Detroit, Philadelphia and Cleveland.\n\nRead more: This city\u2019s real-estate market is the least likely to tank during the next recession\n\nAnd matters are only getting worse. Home-price appreciation has outstripped wage growth across 76% of the markets Attom studied, particularly in the areas near major cities such as New York, Los Angeles, Boston and Washington, D.C.\n\n\u201cPrices are going up substantially faster than earnings in 2019 without any immediate end in sight, which continues to make home ownership difficult or impossible for a majority of single-income households and even for many families with two incomes,\u201d Todd Teta, chief product officer with Attom Data Solutions, said in the report.\n\nThe major factor driving home prices higher as of late for most of the country has been the lack of homes for sale. After the recession, home-building activity was slow to rebound and mostly concentrated in the most expensive tier of the market for single-family homes.\n\nAs newer homes didn\u2019t come on line to meet the growing demand, particularly for cheaper starter homes, competition for properties heated up, and bidding wars pushed home prices even high across much of the country.\n\nRead more: Nearly half of the U.S.\u2019s homeless people live in one state: California\n\nIn recent weeks, the downturn in mortgage rates provided some reprieve for home buyers, Teta said, as it relieved some of the affordability constraints. Housing activity \u2014 both in terms of salesand construction \u2014 has rebounded as a result.\n\nHowever, the reprieve could be short lived, as interest rates have inched upward again. Ultimately, until there is a major resurgence of home building, it\u2019s going to be difficult for many people to afford to buy their own homes.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that you can\u2019t buy what\u2019s not for sale and, however low they may go, lower mortgage-interest rates can\u2019t right the supply side of the market,\u201d Richard Moody, chief economist at Regions Financial Corp. wrote in a research note last week.", "description": "Home prices are rising faster than wages across most of the country.", "authors": ["Jacob Passy"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS071_hometo_ZG_20190925163418.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
