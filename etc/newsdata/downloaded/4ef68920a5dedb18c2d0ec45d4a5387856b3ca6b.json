The agenda had been blank prior to the White House sending over Menashi\u2019s nomination.\n\nThat\u2019s an incredibly fast turn-around for a judicial nominee, and it\u2019s no mistake that the Republican-led committee kept its agenda empty until the last minute. It helped to stave off prolonged protests by progressive groups that have already signaled strong opposition to Menashi, who, if confirmed, will have a lifetime seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit.\n\nMenashi, a 40-year-old lawyer who previously clerked for Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito and served as acting general counsel for Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, wrote dozens of incendiary editorials and blog posts in the late 1990s and early 2000s decrying \u201cleftist multiculturalism\u201d and \u201cPC orthodoxy.\u201d\n\nAs CNN first reported, Menashi complained about \u201cgynocentrists\u201d participating in Take Back the Night marches; accused the Human Rights Campaign of having \u201cincessantly exploited the slaying of Matthew Shepard\u201d for political benefit; and claimed that a Dartmouth fraternity wasn\u2019t being racist when it held a \u201cghetto party\u201d attended by white partygoers wearing Afros and carrying toy guns.\n\nMenashi\u2019s past writings include him comparing race data collection in college admissions to Germany under Adolf Hitler; denouncing women\u2019s marches as sexual assault; opposing the \u201dradical abortion rights advocated by campus feminists and codified in Roe v. Wade\u201d; arguing that diverse communities \u201cexhibit less political and civic engagement, less effective government institutions, and fewer public goods\u201d; and writing that it is \u201cridiculous\u201d to say that students chanting the Dartmouth football cheer, \u201cWah-hoo-wah! Scalp \u2019em!,\u201d are propagating \u201ca racist belief in the inferiority of American Indians.\u201d\n\nIn a 1998 opinion article, Menashi opposed need-based financial aid because, he argued, it hurt wealthy people. He also spread the Islamophobic myth that Gen. John Pershing executed Muslim prisoners in the Philippines in 1913 with bullets dipped in pig fat.\n\nAt least one left-leaning judicial advocacy group is planning protests this week to try to tank Menashi\u2019s nomination.\n\n\u201cMenashi is a perfect storm of awful,\u201d tweeted Brian Fallon of Demand Justice. \u201cExpect protest activity this week regarding his nomination hearing.\u201d\n\nMenashi is a perfect storm of awful. Expect protest activity this week regarding his nomination hearinghttps://t.co/XQQZo2zpSv \u2014 Brian Fallon (@brianefallon) September 9, 2019\n\nFallon told HuffPost that protesters plan to attend Menashi\u2019s hearing. Demand Justice and another progressive group, Credo, also expect to deliver a petition with 100,000 signatures to Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the top Democrat on the committee, in protest of Menashi.\n\nOther groups are calling on the White House to rescind his nomination.\n\n\u201cSteven Menashi\u2019s litany of racist, sexist, and homophobic remarks should be absolutely disqualifying for anyone seeking a lifetime seat on the federal bench,\u201d Nan Aron, president of Alliance for Justice, said in a statement. \u201cThere is nothing in his record that gives any indication that Menashi could be trusted to administer even-handed justice. His nomination must be withdrawn immediately.\u201d\n\nAlliance for Justice previously released a detailed report on all of its concerns over Menashi\u2019s record.\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee will begin Menashi\u2019s confirmation hearing at 10 a.m. EDT Wednesday.
