Horrendous afternoon. It must be said that 99.9% of @YTFC fans are also disgusted by what\u2019s happened as much as we are.\n\n\"One club, one community.\"\n\n(Image: James Fearn/PPAUK)\n\nCameroonian goalkeeper Pajetat, at the centre of the incident, played in Portugal for a number of years before joining Margate in 2016.\n\nHe joined Haringey Borough, who play in the Isthmian League Premier Division, in 2017 and has established himself as their first-choice goalkeeper.\n\n(Image: Twitter)\n\nThe alleged incident comes just days after England's game with Bulgaria was twice halted in the first half with players threatening to walk off over racial abuse.\n\nAfter the sickening scenes in Sofia, FA chief Greg Clarke noted that racism remained an issue in the English game.\n\nHe said: \"I think at UEFA we need to really address that, but to be perfectly frank we also still need to address racism in England.\n\n(Image: James Fearn/PPAUK)\n\n\"We still have it, we have it throughout the pyramid, we see examples of it every week from the professional game down to the grassroots game.\n\n\"We shouldn't take the moral high ground, we should join a movement to drive racism out of our game and have zero tolerance for it.\"", "description": "Haringey Borough's FA Cup fourth qualifying round clash with Yeovil was abandoned after they walked off", "authors": ["Rich Jones", "Image", "James Fearn Ppauk", "Twitter"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20655332.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-Haringey-Borough-v-Yeovil-Town-London-UK-19-Oct-2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
