Think about what you enjoy eating \u2013 do you have a sweet tooth or enjoy more savoury things? What about fruit or smoky flavours? Focus on flavour first \u2013 age, distillery and different styles can all be explored later.\u201d\n\nSingle malt Scotch tends to be more flavour-forward, with whiskies highlighting the distilleries\u2019 characters, but blended Scotch should not be overlooked. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason at all why blended Scotch should be seen as inferior to single malt. The whisky-maker has so many more flavour and aroma options to choose from with blended; you might end up with an easier-sipping blend, or one that\u2019s quite complex. They can also carry hefty age statements, too. Try Compass Box, Chivas Regal or Johnnie Walker,\u201d says Kristiane.\n\nWe stuck mostly to single malts for this test, with just a few special or popular blends thrown in for variation. We tried to keep the bottles mostly affordable: price is always a factor with Scotch due to the man hours involved in production and the bottles we tried varied from under \u00a320 to almost \u00a3200, though the sky\u2019s the limit when it comes to the really expensive stuff.\n\nWe also looked to include a range of regions in our selection to please all palates: for example Islay whiskies tend to be heavily peated according to Kristiane, while Speysides are sweeter and fruitier, but this is not a hard and fast rule.\n\nWe assembled a mixed group of whisky fans and novices and tried over 25 examples of Scotch to compile this shortlist, sampling each at room temperature straight up, then with any variations (water, ice, mixed) the brand had suggested. These are the whiskies we rated\u2026\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews.

Matured in virgin oak casks, there is a cleanness and interesting lightness to this whisky. Everyone in the group loved the very clear banana notes in this which were well balanced against sweet malt, vanilla and a touch of pepper. The brand advised drinking with water, but we found it mellowed too much and preferred to take in the exciting tropical notes straight up. A hidden gem of a Scotch, and one that happily has environmental benefits thanks to its Soil Association certification. We\u2019d hunt this out again for sure.\n\nBuy now\n\nLagavulin 2001 distillers edition Scotch: \u00a387.95, The Whisky Exchange\n\nKristiane highlighted this brand as one of her personal favourites and we\u2019d agree. The smoothness was incredible, with a persistent honeyed sherry undertone (it\u2019s finished in casks that previously held pedro ximenez, white Spanish grape variety) and absolutely no burn. It\u2019s a great all-rounder, with none of the group having anything negative to say about it, and a brilliant blend of classic Islay peat smoke and raisin-like dark sweetness. It also tasted more expensive \u2013 smooth, silky and complex \u2013 than many of the pricier bottles we tried.\n\nBuy now\n\nDuncan Taylor Strathclyde premium octave 1990: \u00a3190, The Spirits Embassy\n\nThis is a seriously special whisky and all of our testers picked up on this, immediately identifying it as one of the most expensive bottles. Hailing from Aberdeenshire, Duncan Taylor is an independent bottler of Scotch renowned for owning the largest privately-held collections of aged Scotch, which they then transform using special \u201coctave\u201d casks for a second maturation. This new range of eight octave matured whiskies ranges from \u00a3190-850 thanks to the rarity and age of the whisky (the eldest is a 48-year-old Port Dundas) with each boasting expanded flavour profiles thanks to being held in oloroso sherry barrels. This 28-year-old Strathclyde single malt is a big whack of a whisky, with bold diesel flavours and a seriously grown up spiciness. There\u2019s a developing sweetness and a smattering of dried fruits, finished by a hefty warmth. Just 70 bottles exist, so be quick if you\u2019re keen.\n\nBuy now\n\nTomatin highland single malt 14 year old: \u00a353.90, Regal Whisky\n\nHighland whiskies are often characterised by their fruitcake sweetness and delicate heathery smoke and this is exactly what you get with this 14-year-old Tomatin. It\u2019s matured in oak casks and oloroso sherry butts, so there is a discernible smokey sweetness, but the overriding flavour is of honey, chocolate and toffee; our testers thought this was like a very sophisticated Wether\u2019s Original and it\u2019s true the burnt caramel flavour is big here, though there\u2019s still an amount of fire. We\u2019d drink it as an after-dinner drink and enjoy it tremendously.\n\nBuy now\n\nJohnnie Walker black label 12 year old whisky: \u00a322.50 instead of \u00a330, Tesco\n\nOne of the world\u2019s best-selling whiskies, Johnnie Walker Black Label is a well known blended Scotch that deserves a place in most drinks cabinets thanks to its versatility. Using around 30 west coast and mainland malts and grains, this is a fruity easy-drinking basic whisky that does the trick with a bit of ice or in cocktails. We found it lacked complexity and interest straight up compared to most of the others we tested, but the balanced mix of peat and vanilla with a touch of smoke is great in mixed drinks: we like it in a peach highball.\n\nBuy now\n\nChivas Regal ultis victory editions 1999: \u00a3199, The Whisky Exchange\n\nHere is a blended whisky worthy of a mention \u2013 for Manchester United fans in particular \u2013 as three single malts have been expertly blended by Chivas to create a celebratory dram in honour of the treble winning team. The bottle is the draw here, though the whisky went down well too with its smooth delivery and spicy Speyside notes of ginger, cinnamon and citrus that made for quite an unusual dram. It\u2019s perhaps not the whisky to drop \u00a3200 on unless you\u2019re a committed Man Utd. supporter, but even apathetic drinkers will appreciate Chivas\u2019 masterful blending.\n\nBuy now\n\nWolfburn aurora single malt whisky: \u00a337.95, House of Malt\n\nThis was a really interesting one from the most northerly distillery on the mainland, and very aptly named. It\u2019s aged in ex-bourbon and oloroso casks so the aroma and initial tasting notes are very fruit forward with lots of sweet, dried autumnal apple, raising and almond flavours, but then wow \u2013 a fiery assault on the senses takes place \u2013 very much like a wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing. This is a Christmas cake of a whisky, if that Christmas cake were steeped in an awful lot of seriously spicy single malt Scotch. Brilliant value for such a characterful whisky and nice to look at too.\n\nBuy now\n\nSmokehead sherry bomb: \u00a356.90, Regal Whisky\n\nThis divided opinion among our testers, with half of them raving about the full-on smokiness and the other half overwhelmed by the fumes. An insanely peaty, smokey Islay single malt matured in oloroso casks for an undisclosed amount of time, there is a good dose of sweet, sticky sherry, clove and dried fruit to be found if you can get past the BBQ-levels of smoke. A powerful sipping whisky that also easily holds its own in mixed drinks and cocktails.\n\nBuy now\n\nSpeyside single malt 12 year old: \u00a330, M&S\n\nThis is a crowd-pleasing delicious Speyside single malt from M&S that had a lovely lightness and subtle sweet flavour that all of our testers said they enjoyed. There\u2019s nothing surprising in this whisky other than how approachable it is, with plenty of gentle cinnamon and allspice that goes over into a luxurious creamy texture. We found it to be great value and agreed it would make a good gift for any Scotch fan.\n\nBuy now\n\nGlenrothes Speyside single malt 18 year old: \u00a3100, The Whisky Exchange\n\nWe tried this 18-year-old Speyside against the 10-year-old version which is around a third of the price and cannot emphasise enough how much this higher price tag is warranted. The younger whisky was light and simplistic, whereas a further eight years spent in first fill sherry casks makes for a far more characterful glass. The colour is deep and appealing (though Glenrothes don\u2019t add any colours like most) and smells fantastic like a light fruitcake. We got almonds, pears and spice on the tasting notes, but it\u2019s so complex and rounded you could keep going for a while.\n\nBuy now\n\nGlen Marnoch Islay single malt Scotch whisky: \u00a317.49, Aldi\n\nThis Aldi bargain bottle is a prime example of an Islay single malt that does what it says on the tin: it\u2019s extremely peaty and you really get the taste of the sea in there too with a salty sweetness and herbal seaweedy note. It\u2019s smokey in a mellow way and easy to see how this has picked up a few awards over the years. It tastes at least three times the price it is.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe Single Malt Collection whisky discovery pack by John Dewar & Sons: \u00a340, Amazon\n\nAnyone looking for an introduction to single malts could do worse than pick up this boxed trio from John Dewar & Sons which starts you off with 200ml each of 12 year-old Aberfeldy (oaky, honeyed spice), 12 year-old Aultmore (light and herbal) and 13 year-old Craigellachie (robust, malty).\n\nBuy now\n\nThe verdict: Single malt Scotch whiskies\n\nWe\u2019ve tried some exceptional whiskies over the course of this test but two examples really stood heads and shoulders above the rest: the Benromach organic Speyside was interesting, exciting and stood up to some of the far more expensive Scotch, so this is our hands down winner.\n\nIt\u2019s closely followed by the 2001 Lagavulin, which just oozed luxury and again gave good value at around \u00a387 \u2013 we thought it would cost double. For a bargain \"every day\" whisky, Aldi\u2019s Glen Marnoch is your one.\n\nIndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
