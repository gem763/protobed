Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez will endorse Sen. Bernie Sanders for president during a rally Saturday. The Washington Post first reported her plans Tuesday night, and Sanders deputy communications director Sarah Ford later confirmed the news to the Associated Press. The endorsement from the influential young liberal is seen as a coup for Sanders, the Post said, and a blow to Sen. Elizabeth Warren as the two vie to win over the Democratic Party's left wing. Late Tuesday night, Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota officially endorsed Sanders, calling him \"the best candidate to take on Donald Trump in 2020.\" Separately, CNN reported a third \"Squad\" member, Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, will also back Sanders. Warren has gained -- and Sanders slipped -- in a number of recent polls, elevating her to front-runner status along with former Vice President Joe Biden. Warren, Sanders, Biden and nine other candidates squared off Tuesday night in Ohio for the fourth Democratic presidential debate.", "description": "New York Rep.
