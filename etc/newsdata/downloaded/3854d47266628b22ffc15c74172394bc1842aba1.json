Holtz to the roster. The Redskins needed another tight end with Jordan Reed missing Sunday\u2019s game against the Philadelphia Eagles with a concussion.\n\nThere had been some buzz about re-signing Davis to the full roster, but the Redskins opted for the practice squad instead.\n\nWashington coach Jay Gruden still has to figure out the status of injured players like Reed, Derrius Guice (knee soreness) and Jonathan Allen (knee sprain) before re-adding Davis. For instance, if Reed is unavailable for a second straight week, the Redskins need a third tight end to be active.\n\nDavis, a sixth-round draft pick, has been with the Redskins since 2017. He worked his way back this summer from a devastating leg injury and shined in training camp.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
