At the same time, the Chicago Cubs swept the Pirates in Chicago.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThe result? An actual division race. The rest of the divisions in baseball are just counting down magic numbers, but the Cubs are now just two games back in the division with a weekend series looming against those Cardinals.\n\nThe Brewers, for their part, are only three back.\n\nHere\u2019s where the rest of the league sits, who\u2019s getting closes to clinching, who\u2019s getting close to elimination and what games to watch Monday.\n\nThe Cubs are now two games back in the NL Central. (Daniel Bartel-USA TODAY Sports)\n\nMagic Number Countdown\n\nYANKEES: The Yankees dropped the series finale in Toronto, falling to the Blue Jays 6-4. Meanwhile, in Anaheim, the Rays lost 6-4 to the Angels, which lowered the Yankees\u2019 magic number to clinch the AL East to three.\n\nBRAVES: Their magic number to clinch the NL East is still four after losing to the Nationals, 7-0.\n\nASTROS: The Astros clobbered the Royals again in Kansas City, completing the three-game sweep with a 12-3 win. Their magic number to clinch the AL West is five.\n\nTWINS: The Twins lost to the Indians 7-5 on Sunday, but won two of three in the series to put their magic number in the AL Central at nine.\n\nStory continues\n\nCARDINALS: Not the best weekend in St. Louis. The Cardinals dropped two of three to the Brewers, , while the Cubs swept the Pirates in Chicago. St. Louis\u2019 magic number to clinch the NL Central is a tenuous 12.\n\nKey Races\n\nNL CENTRAL: As mentioned above, St. Louis has a two-game lead over the Cubs for the division lead and a three-game lead over the Brewers. The Cardinals have seven of their remaining 13 games against the Cubs too.\n\nNL WILD CARD: Four straight wins have the Cubs back in the second wild-card spot. The Brewers are one game back, but the other contenders now have a bit more distance \u2014 the Mets are four games back, the Phillies are 4.5 and the D-backs are five behind. The D-backs had lost six in a row earlier in the week and lost again Sunday to the Reds.\n\nAL WILD CARD: This is firmly a three-team race these days. The A\u2019s, now winners of six straight, have a 1.5 game lead for the top spot with the Rays leading the Indians for the second spot by a game and a half.\n\nGames to Watch\n\n\u2022 Washington Nationals vs. St. Louis Cardinals (7:45 p.m. ET) \u2014 This is a massive series for both teams. The Cardinals play nothing but winning teams from here on out, while the Nationals have started coming back to the pack in the NL wild card. With the Cubs and Brewers gaining ground in both races, the urgency will be high at Busch Stadium.\n\n\u2022 New York Mets vs. Colorado Rockies (8:40 p.m. ET) \u2014 To make a run at the postseason, the Mets will have to survive a trip to Denver. The Rockies aren\u2019t good, but Coors Field can be an unforgiving venue for opposing teams. The pressure will be on left-handed starter Steven Matz to start the series strong.\n\nElimination Watch\n\n\u2022 There were no eliminations on Sunday. Next up, the San Diego Padres have an elimination number of one. The Cincinnati Reds are close behind with an elimination number of two.\n\n\u2022 Teams whose postseason dreams are already over: Detroit Tigers, Baltimore Orioles, Kansas City Royals, Toronto Blue Jays, Seattle Mariners, Miami Marlins, Los Angeles Angels, Colorado Rockies, Texas Rangers and Pittsburgh Pirates.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Your daily rundown of magic numbers, key races, elimination scenarios and games to watch as the MLB season gets into crunch time.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/qjKx6ynJK.H5vfDcIMQueA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/MFoSP15QDt9M0wUXxABefg--~B/aD0yMjM1O3c9MzM1MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/82b643e0-d87f-11e9-bfff-853a82ab655b", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
