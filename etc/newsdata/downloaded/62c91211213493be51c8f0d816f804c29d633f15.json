Winners were chosen by a panel of distinguished judges.\n\nNow it is time to meet the Pride of Britain 2019.\n\nChild of courage - Jaydee-Lee Dummett\n\n(Image: Rowan Griffiths)\n\nSchoolgirl saved her family\u2019s life by raising the alarm when she recognised the signs of deadly carbon monoxide poisoning\n\nIn March, Jaydee-Lee, seven, noticed her brother Laylan, four, was disoriented and acting strangely when he awoke in the night.\n\nShe immediately recognised his behaviour as the signs of carbon monoxide poisoning, which she had learned about at school three weeks previously, during a gas safety visit.\n\nLaylan was disoriented and saying there was someone at the end of his bed.\n\nMum Lindy thought he was sleepwalking but Jaydee-Lee had learned about the symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning, and a few seconds later, she noticed a flickering red light.\n\nThe light on the family\u2019s carbon monoxide detector had turned from green to red, but with no alarm sounding, Lindy would not have noticed.\n\nJaydee-Lee took control of the situation and even remembered the gas emergency number \u2013 0800 111 999 \u2013 for her mum to dial.\n\nWithout Jaydee-Lee\u2019s quick thinking, her family would have been among the 50 people killed by carbon monoxide poisoning in the UK this year. Lindy says: \u201cI couldn\u2019t be prouder of Jaydee-Lee \u2013 she saved our lives.\n\n\u201cFrom being involved in a simple lesson on gas safety, she knew exactly what to look for.\n\n\u201cLooking back, without this lesson, I genuinely don\u2019t think we\u2019d still be alive.\n\n\u201c She\u2019s our little hero.\u201d\n\nChild of courage - Ben Hedger\n\n(Image: Philip Coburn)\n\nHero schoolboy steered a car across dual carriageway, after his mum collapsed at the wheel while travelling at 65mph\n\nBen\u2019s mum Lauren had picked him up from school last December. They were five minutes from home, on the A120 near Colchester, Essex, when Lauren began staring into space and was unresponsive to Ben\u2019s questions.\n\nInitially he thought she was joking, but when the car began to swerve into the right-hand lane at 65mph, he knew something was wrong.\n\nThe car swerved across both lanes of the dual carriageway before hitting the central reservation and scraping along the barrier.\n\nLauren had now started shaking and her muscles tensed causing her foot to push down on the accelerator.\n\nBen, then eight, undid his seatbelt, grabbed the wheel, steering the car back across two lanes and on to the grass verge where it eventually stalled and came to a stop.\n\nBen even managed to put the hazard lights on to warn other drivers.\n\nLauren was now slumped over the steering wheel, and Ben feared she had died, but she regained consciousness and made a full recovery in hospital.\n\nAsked where he got the remarkable confidence to take control of the car, Ben, now aged nine, credited his love of playing racing video games on his PlayStation 4.\n\nLauren says: \u201cI\u2019ve never had a seizure before so there\u2019s no way he would have known what to do in that situation. I\u2019m so proud of Ben.\u201c\n\nChild of courage - Dante Marvin\n\n(Image: Julian Hamilton/Daily Mirror)\n\nA youngster whose motto \u201cthere are no disabilities, only abilities\u201d is a powerful advocate for other disabled children\n\nDante, 11, born with brittle bone disease and scoliosis, has spent most of his young life in and out of hospital. Treatment included painful rod replacement surgery for his legs.\n\nBut the Liverpool schoolboy refuses to let it get him down. He tells everyone he meets: \u201cThere are no disabilities, only abilities.\u201d\n\nHe first became involved with the children\u2019s charity Variety when his mum Rachel, shown right, asked for help to buy a new wheelchair.\n\nDante dazzled the assessor with his optimistic outlook and she asked him to speak at an event.\n\nHis motto was a key mantra of his speech, which was such a success he now speaks regularly to audiences of adults while encouraging them to dig deep for the cause, helping to raise \u00a330,000 for a Sunshine Bus.\n\nDante also visits other seriously ill and disabled children in hospital, not only bringing light and laughter to the wards, but also identifying children who could benefit from Variety\u2019s support.\n\nHe petitions the charity on their behalf for equipment such as lightweight wheelchairs.\n\nDante says: \u201cI am lucky, I have the best mum in the world. My message is be resilient, be brave and never give up. And just because you are disabled, you are no different to anyone else. Never forget that.\u201d\n\nOutstanding bravery - Dan Nicholson and Joel Snarr\n\nA sales manager and former soldier with PTSD risked their lives to pull three people from wreckage of a burning plane\n\nDan Nicholson was driving home in May last year when a light aircraft plummeted to the ground just 200 yards in front of him.\n\nThe plane had suffered engine problems shortly after take-off, hit power lines and crashed into the central reservation of the A40 in Abergavenny, South Wales.\n\nWith no thought for his own safety, Dan, 46, leapt from his car and ran towards the burning wreckage.\n\nTrapped inside were teenage brother and sister Jack Moore and Billie Manley, and their uncle, the pilot Stuart Moore.\n\nDan recalls: \u201cThe plane was upside down and flames were coming out.\n\n\u201cI could hear screaming so I climbed under the wing. You could feel the heat and smoke.\u201d\n\nHe smashed the rear window and pulled Billie, 16, from the smoke-filled cabin.\n\nAt that point Joel Snarr, a former army officer, ran from his car to help. Joel, 35, helped Dan get Jack, 19, out of the wreckage. And then Joel grabbed the pilot by the arms and pulled him free.\n\nThey had managed to pull all three from the plane minutes before it was completely engulfed in flames.\n\nDan adds: \u201cI would do it all over again. I am proud we managed to save all three.\u201d\n\nSpecial recognition - Josh Littlejohn and Alice Thompson\n\n(Image: Stuart Nicol Photography)\n\nFriends who began a sandwich shop to raise money for social causes now lead a global movement to end homelessness\n\nThe pair opened Social Bite, a cafe that donates profits to social causes, in Edinburgh in 2012. When a Big Issue seller came in and asked for a job, it opened their eyes to the problem of homelessness.\n\nNow Social Bite has grown from a single cafe to five branches and a social business aimed at ending homelessness across the world. One in three staff have experienced homelessness, and customers can pay for food and drink for a homeless person.\n\nAfter a fundraising sleepout with business leaders, in 2017 they launched Sleep in the Park, with 8,000 people raising \u00a34million. A year later, 10,000 people took part, raising a further \u00a33.65million.\n\nThe pair are now advising the Scottish Government on housing policies aiming to get people off the streets.\n\nThey have also built the Social Bite Village from reclaimed wasteland in Edinburgh. It provides shelter and support for up to 20 homeless people at a time. And they asked landlords to pledge accommodation, a programme called Housing First.\n\nThe scheme received \u00a36.5million funding from the Scottish Government and by April 2021, 830 people will be housed.\n\nIn December, the World\u2019s Big Sleep Out will take place in 50 cities including London and New York.\n\nIt aims to raise \u00a340million for local charities and global homelessness initiatives set up by UNICEF USA, the Malala Fund and the Institute of Global Homelessness.\n\nSpecial recognition - Margaret Walker\n\n(Image: Philip Coburn)\n\nSpeech therapist Margaret invented Makaton, a language programme of signs, symbols and speech that has changed the lives of millions\n\nMargaret was working at an institution in Surrey for people with learning disabilities in 1968 when she noticed staff only communicated with residents using speech.\n\nIt led to frustration and sometimes disruptive behaviour among those who were unable to express themselves verbally.\n\nIt prompted Margaret to assess all 1,110 residents in the hope of better understanding their communication needs \u2013 something that had never been done before.\n\nMargaret, now 80, spent the next six months recording staff speaking to residents and their attempts to respond.\n\nShe found all shared around 350 essential concepts \u2013 which went on to become the Makaton core vocabulary.\n\nBy 1976, word of Makaton had spread and she decided to hold her first training workshop.\n\nIn 1978, Margaret established the beginnings of what is now The Makaton Charity.\n\nThe language has been adapted for more than 40 countries.\n\nMore than a million children and adults in the UK use Makaton signs and symbols, and 100,000 people rely on it to communicate.\n\nThis Morning Emergency Services Award - Sgt Stevie Bull\n\n(Image: TIM ANDERSON)\n\nHeroic police officer risked her life to tackle a man brandishing a gun at nurses in a hospital ward\n\nStevie was at University College Hospital in London in with a colleague who had been taken ill, when she heard a call on her radio and saw security guards run past.\n\nStevie, a PC at the time in March 2018, ran to the scene where she was confronted by a man pointing a handgun at a nurse.\n\nHe also had a large suitcase, raising fears it could be a bomb. Knowing she could be risking her own life, Stevie confronted the man.\n\nWhen he refused to put the weapon down, she attempted to tackle him to the floor.\n\nDuring the struggle, Stevie sustained a head and neck injury, but she continued to wrestle with the gunman.\n\nWith the help of two security guards, she pinned him down. Stevie was then able to handcuff him and retrieve the gun, later found to be a starter pistol.\n\nSgt Chris Couling, then Stevie\u2019s superior officer, said: \u201cHaving seen a photo, you wouldn\u2019t know it was a starter pistol.\u201d\n\nStevie, now a sergeant, said: \u201cWe are told to wait for a firearms officer. But when I was that close there was only one way I was going to go. I didn\u2019t really think about my own safety, I just acted on instinct.\u201d\n\nGood Morning Britain young fundraiser - Aaron Hunter\n\n(Image: DAILY MIRROR)\n\nTerminally ill Aaron is on a mission to raise hundreds of thousands of pounds so other children won\u2019t suffer\n\nAaron, nine, has ROHHAD, an extremely rare and complex disease that affects the function of every system and organ within the body.\n\nThere are only 100 known cases worldwide, 12 of them in the UK.\n\nSufferers face a daily fight for survival and many die before their teens. And Aaron is determined to help them, and make sure others don\u2019t have to suffer like him.\n\nWhen doctors confirmed he had ROHHAD in January 2015, there was no test to diagnose it, little research into the illness and critically, no cure.\n\nMonths after diagnosis, Aaron and his family founded the ROHHAD Association to raise awareness and money for research, as well as to offer support to other families. So far they have raised \u00a3310,000.\n\nAfter seeing the Ice Bucket Challenge for motor neurone disease on the news, Aaron came up with the Muddy Puddle Challenge.\n\nThe eight-year-old, from Balloch, by Loch Lomond, Scotland, made a video calling on his favourite superhero, Ironman, played by Robert Downey Jr, to help.\n\nThe actor was so inspired by Aaron\u2019s selflessness and desire to help others, he flew to Britain to meet him \u2013 and jump in a muddy puddle in a See You Jimmy hat. Robert said: \u201cAs I got to know Aaron more, I just got caught up in the spirit of his desire to help others.\u201d\n\nTSB Community Partner - Ben Clifford\n\n(Image: Gareth Everett/Huw Evans Agency)\n\nInspirational surfer gives people with disabilities the chance to experience the joy of the sport at world-leading surf school\n\nWhen a disabled person asks Ben if they can go surfing, his answer is always: \u201cOf course you can.\u201d\n\nThis mantra is the mission statement for Surfability UK, the country\u2019s first fully inclusive surf school, which Ben set up in Caswell Bay near Swansea in 2013.\n\nHe was determined to shatter the belief that disabled people can\u2019t surf, and even goes to extraordinary lengths to help people with the most severe disabilities take part in the sport he loves.\n\nIf someone arrives at Surfability with a disability he has not seen before, he researches their condition and even invents new kit, such as the UK\u2019s first seated tandem surfboard for people who cannot sit up.\n\nIt means nobody misses out, and Ben says: \u201cOur youngest surfer at the moment is six and our oldest 73. I see them as individuals and I find a way to make it work for them.\u201d\n\nBen, 34, is now a world leader in new teaching methods and safety techniques. He is working with the International Surfing Association to develop standards for adaptive surfing, helping people with disabilities in illustrious surfing hotspots such as California, South Africa and Australia.\n\nToday the Surfability initiative supports more than 500 people.\n\nThanks to Ben, they have an opportunity to defy their disability and take to the waves.\n\nLifetime Achievement - Dame Elizabeth Anionwu\n\n(Image: Philip Coburn)\n\nElizabeth overcame a brutal childhood to become a nurse and transform care for people with sickle cell disease\n\nBorn in 1947 to a 20-year-old Irish student and a Nigerian law student, Elizabeth\u2019s early life was dogged by racism and the stigma of illegitimacy. Shame led her family to put her in a home run by Catholic nuns.\n\nIt was a childhood filled with cruelty \u2013 in one children\u2019s home she was made to stand with a urine-soaked sheet over her head as a punishment for wetting the bed.\n\nBut a caring nursing nun who treated her eczema when she was four inspired her to become a nurse.\n\nAt 16 she started working as a school nursing assistant in Wolverhampton. It was the start of a 50-year career as a nurse, tutor and professor.\n\nHer passion for challenging inequalities in healthcare led her \u2013 alongside Dr Misha Brozovic \u2013 to set up the UK\u2019s first sickle cell and thalassaemia screening and counselling centre, in Brent, North West London, in 1979.\n\nIt is a condition mostly found in African and Caribbean communities and at the time was often overlooked within the NHS.\n\nDame Elizabeth, now 72, became the UK\u2019s first sickle cell nurse specialist.\n\nShe was also involved in setting up the Sickle Cell Society, which this year celebrated its 40th anniversary.\n\nDame Elizabeth is now Emeritus Professor of Nursing at the University of West London.\n\nITV Fundraiser of the Year - to be announced on the night\n\nWhether it\u2019s rattling a tin in the street, selling raffle tickets or running a marathon, we all know someone who raises money to help others.\n\nITV regional news programmes asked viewers to nominate exceptional fundraisers in their area.\n\nRegional winners were selected by judges from each ITV area, then the Pride of Britain judges had the tough task of choosing the overall winner, who will be announced at tonight\u2019s awards.", "description": "The awards show - now in its 20th year - is set to be aired on ITV on Tuesday, November 5", "authors": ["Kelly-Ann Mills", "Image", "Daily Mirror", "Rowan Griffiths", "Philip Coburn", "Julian Hamilton Daily Mirror", "Stuart Nicol Photography", "Tim Anderson", "Gareth Everett Huw Evans Agency"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20741567.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_JS195194278-copy.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
