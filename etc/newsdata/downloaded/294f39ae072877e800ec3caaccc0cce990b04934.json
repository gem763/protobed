Shawn Menard and representatives of the Glebe, Old Ottawa South and Old Ottawa East community associations.\n\nGoudie said the issue isn't mainly about making money for OSEG, rather building the reputation of Lansdowne as a year-round destination.\n\n\"It's about community programming and doing a better job of providing more diverse city programming,\" Goudie said.\n\n\"We've got 140 employees. Right now, on site, the city has three-ish. I think we can bring some of what we're good at to Lansdowne and to programming.\"\n\nHundreds of people attended a meeting at the Horticulture Building, organized by local community associations, to hear about the controversial proposal to have OSEG take over urban park operations from the city. (Yasmine Mehdi/CBC)\n\nOSEG already runs TD Place stadium and arena, owns the three sports teams that play there, and manages commercial leases at Lansdowne Park, which started opening back up in 2014 after a major redevelopment.\n\nIn a report that came out Friday, the city staff recommended negotiating with OSEG about taking control over the operation of the urban park.\n\nThe report would have the private company take over programming for the Aberdeen Pavillion, the Horticulture Building, the Great Lawn and the outdoor plaza, where the Ottawa Farmers' Market is held \u2014 all currently the responsibility of city parks staff.\n\nGrow farmers market\n\nFarmers are concerned they could be squeezed out of the new model, especially if market days become less regular.\n\nGoudie said his market research has shown the Ottawa Farmers' Market is a major success at Lansdowne.\n\nVendors at the Ottawa Farmers' Market expressed concerns that OSEG taking over management of public space could put their businesses at risk. (CBC)\n\n\"I hope what's able to happen with the farmers market is we can provide infrastructure that lets it grow,\" he said.\n\nHowever, Goudie said it's too early to say whether rents might go up since he doesn't know what they currently are.\n\nWorry about price increases\n\nDan Hughes, a photographic artist, said Aberdeen Pavillion is an important low-cost venue to get exposure for his work.\n\n\"If it was taken over by OSEG \u2014 a for-profit organization \u2014 my concern would be the cost would go up for artists, [it would be] much more difficult to partake in,\" he said.\n\nDan Hughes, a photographic artist, says the Aberdeen Pavillion provides one of the rare non-profit venues in Ottawa where artists can show and sell their work. (Matthew Kupfer/CBC)\n\nIn response to a question from Hughes, Goudie said he wants to find the right way to support the arts at Lansdowne Park and he considers the 613flea flea market a successful event.\n\nTheresa Wallace, an Old Ottawa East resident, said the proposal reflects a loss of public space in the city.\n\n\"My biggest concern with the OSEG proposal is that it's the continuation of a pattern with the City of Ottawa and private partners to privatize public space,\" Wallace said.\n\nTo councillors next week\n\nDan Chenier, city general manager of parks, recreation and cultural facilities, said the proposal came from OSEG and the details would have to come after council authorizes the city to negotiate with them.\n\nHe said the city would be aiming to preserve subsidies for community events.\n\n\"Our objective is to maintain good community access, good affordable access to the site. That's what we have to work on with them as part of a recommendation to council,\" Chenier said.\n\nFrom left to right: Dan Chenier, general manager of city parks, recreation and facility services; Capital Coun.
