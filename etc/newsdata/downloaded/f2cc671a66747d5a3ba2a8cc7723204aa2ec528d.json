Our profession should act to ensure trust in audit is not compromised,\" PwC said in a submission to a parliamentary inquiry into audit quality, published online on Tuesday.\n\n\"At PwC we are constantly considering the future path of our business \u2013 the support, learning and education system for our people involved in audit; how community expectations are changing; how we can become more transparent; and what we can do to strengthen trust in our profession.\"\n\nRival KPMG, in its submission, suggested \"industry-wide definitions\" in the way non-audit services are reported.\n\nKPMG also said listed companies should disclose the tenure of their auditors and suggested changes to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission's audit inspection regime. KPMG, like PwC, wants ASIC to begin providing a grading of audit quality findings as well as building an appeals process into the regime.\n\n\"We see the interest in audit as an opportunity to enable fresh thought about traditional practice and stimulate thinking about advancing trust in audit,\" the firm said in its submission.\n\nThe corporate regulator has repeatedly questioned the audit quality of the big four firms.", "description": "PwC and KPMG have put forward a range of ideas on how audit quality can be improved.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1936%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_67/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/405a750477ca282e3cc34c1b9e7277fc1e854992", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
