He suffered a knockout loss to Francis Ngannou just 26 seconds into the first round.\n\nHe made his professional wrestling debut in August at Triplemania XXVII, a major event held by Mexican promotion AAA.\n\nVelasquez's first WWE appearance came last week on Friday Night SmackDown's premiere episode on Fox. He got into a brawl with Lesnar, setting the stage for his first storyline.\n\n\"We've talked a little bit back and forth and nothing happened,\" he told Raimondi following his SmackDown appearance about previous talks with WWE. \"They wanted to see my development. I think they're pleased with what I'm doing now.\"\n\nVelasquez defeated Lesnar by first-round knockout at UFC 121 in 2010 to capture the UFC Heavyweight Championship. They never met again inside the Octagon.\n\nThat sets the backdrop for their meeting at Crown Jewel. Lesnar, also a former UFC heavyweight champion, is one of WWE's top Superstars, and it's possible Velasquez follows the same path if he's able to make a strong early impression.\n\nIn the short term, WWE will hope the crossover appeal of the former UFC combatants helps boost SmackDown ratings on Fox.", "description": "Former UFC heavyweight champion Cain Velasquez has reportedly retired from MMA and signed a multiyear contract with  WWE , per  Marc Raimondi  of ESPN...", "authors": ["Tim Daniels"], "top_image": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/832/588/hi-res-26898685f4e4c60cf1e04686ea60d2c9_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
