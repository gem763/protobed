What wasn\u2019t routine was where the crew stopped along the way: President Donald Trump\u2019s Turnberry resortTWO BIG POLITICO SCOOPS \u2026\n\n-- KYLE CHENEY, HEATHER CAYGLE and JOHN BRESNAHAN: \u201cHouse Judiciary panel preparing vote to define Trump impeachment probe\u201d: The House Judiciary Committee is preparing to take its first formal vote to define what Chairman Jerry Nadler calls an ongoing \u2018impeachment investigation\u2019 of President Donald Trump, according to multiple sources briefed on the discussions.\n\n\u201cThe panel could vote as early as Wednesday on a resolution to spell out the parameters of its investigation. The precise language is still being hammered out inside the committee and with House leaders. A draft of the resolution is expected to be released Monday morning.\n\n\u201cThe issue was raised Friday during a conference call among the committee's Democrats. A source familiar with the discussion said any move next week would be intended to increase the \u2018officialness\u2019 of the ongoing probe, following a six-week summer recess in which some Democrats struggled to characterize to their constituents that the House had already begun impeachment proceedings. Democrats are hopeful that explicitly defining their impeachment inquiry will heighten their leverage to compel testimony from witnesses.\u201d POLITICO\n\n-- NATASHA BERTRAND and BRIAN BENDER: \u201cAir Force crew made an odd stop on a routine trip: Trump\u2019s Scottish resort\u201d: \u201cIn early Spring of this year, an Air National Guard crew made a routine trip from the U.S. to Kuwait to deliver supplies. What wasn\u2019t routine was where the crew stopped along the way: President Donald Trump\u2019s Turnberry resort, about 50 miles outside Glasgow, Scotland.\n\n\u201cSince April, the House Oversight Committee has been investigating why the crew on the C-17 military transport plane made the unusual stay \u2014 both en route to the Middle East and on the way back \u2014 at the luxury waterside resort, according to several people familiar with the incident. But they have yet to receive any answers from the Pentagon.\n\n\u201cThe inquiry is part of a broader, previously unreported probe into U.S. military expenditures at and around the Trump property in Scotland. According to a letter the panel sent to the Pentagon in June, the military has spent $11 million on fuel at the Prestwick Airport \u2014 the closest airport to Trump Turnberry \u2014 since October 2017, fuel that would be cheaper if purchased at a U.S. military base. The letter also cites a Guardian report that the airport provided cut-rate rooms and free rounds of golf at Turnberry for U.S. military members. \u2026 The Pentagon, Air Force and White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\u201d POLITICO\n\nIF IMPEACHMENT HEARINGS start in any way, shape or form, they will lead to an impeachment vote on the House floor. That much is nearly certain, according to people we talk to.\n\nBIG \u2026 POLITICS SHIFTING IN TEXAS \u2026 DALLAS MORNING NEWS: \u201cTexas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick says he will defy NRA, take lead on gun background checks,\u201d by Robert T. Garrett in Austin: \u201cLt. Gov. Dan Patrick says he's \u2018willing to take an arrow\u2019 and defy the National Rifle Association by pressing Texas to close one loophole in gun-purchaser background checks.\n\n\u201cOn Friday, Patrick said it's \u2018common sense\u2019 to tighten background-check laws because in many instances, stranger-to-stranger sales now are exempt from the requirement that buyers be vetted through a federal database of people not eligible to purchase firearms.\n\n\u201cPatrick wants to protect transfers among family members from triggering a check. He'd also continue to exempt friends, though he acknowledged that could be abused. Patrick, who presides over the Texas Senate, said he's willing to accede to the preferences of senators on whether to maintain that loophole \u2014 and if so, exactly how.\u201d DMN \u2026 This story ran as the lead of the Dallas Morning News print edition\n\nGood Saturday morning.\n\nA message from The Boeing Company: For more than 70 years, the Employees Community Fund of Boeing has funded approximately $1 billion to local communities.

Gorsuch, on the other hand, appears to have been shot from a cannon. At his inaugural oral argument in April 2017, President Trump\u2019s first choice for the Supreme Court asked 22 questions. In the term just completed, Gorsuch wrote more dissents than any other justice and typed out a whopping 337 pages of opinions. Again, more than anyone else.\n\n\u201cAlong the way, he has established himself as one of the court\u2019s most conservative justices and a reliable vote for Trump initiatives that have reached the Supreme Court \u2014 the travel ban on those from mostly-Muslim countries, adding a citizenship question to the census form and allowing a ban on transgender service in the military to go into effect. He has shown a willingness to overturn precedent and an impatience with more reticent colleagues. \u2026\n\n\u201c\u2018I decided I wanted to say something about the Constitution, the separation of powers and the judge\u2019s role in it,\u2019 Gorsuch said in the interview. At his confirmation in 2017, he said, \u2018I was surprised by just some basic misunderstandings about the separation of powers.\u2019\n\n\u201c(In the interview, which happened to fall on his 52nd birthday, Gorsuch was unwilling to discuss the way the Senate goes about evaluating Supreme Court nominees. \u2018You\u2019re not going to make me relive the confirmation process are you?\u2019 he said in response to a question. \u2018On my birthday?\u2019)\u201d WaPo\n\nA message from The Boeing Company:\n\n2020 \u2026\n\n-- BIG CAMPAIGN READ \u2026 NYT\u2019S ALEX BURNS in the \u201cLessons in Power\u201d series \u2026 \u201cBiden Wants to Work With \u2018the Other Side.\u2019 This Supreme Court Battle Explains Why.: In the clash over Robert H.

He has traveled around the country for months trying to introduce himself to Americans and given dozens of media interviews to raise his profile.\n\n\u201cBut as he made his way down the grand concourse of the Iowa State Fair not long ago, surrounded by a litany of cameras, a woman stopped dead in her tracks looking at the mob. She squinted and cocked her head, trying to identify the young man ahead of her before giving up.\n\n\u201c\u2018Who are you?\u2019 the woman called out, as the candidate passed by. \u2018My name is Pete,\u2019 Buttigieg responded. \u2018I\u2019m running for president.\u2019 \u2018Who?\u2019 she replied. \u2026 The still-fluid race for the Democratic nomination has split into two distinct groups: the candidates who have succeeded in crafting a distinct message and those who haven\u2019t.\n\n\u201cFor months, the three top-polling Democratic candidates have distinguished themselves with crystal-clear, if varied, arguments.

Kamala Harris made their case to major donors behind closed doors in two meetings in New York on Friday, telling them they were working on defining the California Democrat with a more refined core message.\n\n\u201cIn the first meeting with a broader group, Ms. Harris\u2019s sister and campaign chairwoman, Maya Harris, along with media consultant Jim Margolis, were questioned by some donors on the senator\u2019s stagnant poll numbers in the Democratic presidential primary. The Harris aides talked up Ms. Harris\u2019s key endorsements in early states, appeal to young voters and their view of the vulnerability of former Vice President Joe Biden \u2019s poll numbers, people familiar with the meetings said.\n\n\u201cThe advisers in the second meeting, with a smaller group of top donors, focused more on the need for voters to know Ms. Harris better\u2014and on the campaign\u2019s strategy to accomplish that through clearer messaging of her values and policy positions, the people said. The meetings in Manhattan drew dozens and included donors from the finance, media and legal industries, among others.\n\n\u201cThe advisers also discussed the dynamic of the coming third Democratic debate, with all of the top contenders on stage Thursday in Houston, as a welcome change from the last debate, when the lower-tier candidates focused attacks on the higher-polling candidates on stage\u2014Ms. Harris and Mr. Biden\u2014putting them on the defensive.
