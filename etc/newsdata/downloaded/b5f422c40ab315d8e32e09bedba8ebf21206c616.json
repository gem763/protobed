Biden and his son Hunter \u2014 and that China might as well, too.\n\nThe president offered his view one day after he sparred with a Reuters reporter who asked the president to explain what he wanted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to do, exactly, when Mr. Trump raised the Bidens in a July 25 phone call.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very simple answer. They should investigate the Bidens,\u201d Mr. Trump told White House reporters as he left for an event in Florida. \u201cLikewise, China should start an investigation into the Bidens because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump says Hunter Biden traded on his father\u2019s position to foster business ties in Ukraine and elsewhere around the globe.\n\nHe also pointed to Hunter Biden\u2019s trip to China with the former vice president in 2013, after which Hunter Biden became involved with an investment fund that did business with the Bank of China.\n\nThe president said he has not asked Chinese President Xi Jinping to look into the Bidens.\n\n\u201cBut clearly it\u2019s something we should start thinking about, because I\u2019m sure that President Xi does not like being under that kind of scrutiny,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s call with Mr. Zelensky is at the heart of an impeachment inquiry being conducted by House Democrats.\n\nDuring the Ukraine call, Mr. Trump told Mr. Zelensky to confer with Attorney General William P. Barr, citing talk that the vice president had \u201cstopped the prosecution\u201d \u2014 a reference to his belief Mr. Biden moved to oust a Ukrainian prosecutor in 2016 to shield his son, who was on the board of a Ukrainian gas company, Burisma.\n\nMr. Biden says he didn\u2019t do anything wrong. His son wasn\u2019t accused of wrongdoing at the time, and the probe was reportedly dormant before the vice president and other Western officials urged Ukraine to dump its prosector because he wasn\u2019t doing enough to stop corruption.\n\nMr. Trump isn\u2019t convinced, saying his foremost 2020 Democratic rival deserves scrutiny.\n\n\u201cI would say that \u2018President Zelensky, if it were me, I would start an investigation into the Bidens,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Trump said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
