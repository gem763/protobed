He claims the captain stayed until the very last moment.\n\n\"They said that they could see Jerry jump from the upper deck and that there was a trail of smoke following him. They thought he was on fire,\" Fritzler said.\n\nSanta Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown now says it appears the 34 people died of smoke inhalation before the fire reached their sleeping quarters. Investigators are also looking into whether the crew was asleep when the fire started. The boat is required to have a roaming night watchman.\n\nA team of fire specialists with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives is now part of the investigation. \"We are looking to determine what happened. A criminal element to that is always a possibility. But at this point one has been charged criminally,\" Brown said.\n\nInvestigators believe California boat fire started on the second level\n\nPainstaking salvage operations are underway to recover the burnt remains of the boat from 65 feet of water. Divers also hope to locate the one body unaccounted for.\n\nThe grief remains overwhelming for those left behind. Vicki Moore lost her partner, Scott Chan, a high school physics teacher, and her 26-year-old daughter Kendra, a wildlife biologist.\n\n\"Both of them shared a passion for the natural word and this intense curiosity. I'm grateful for all the time I had with her and just wish there was more,\" Moore said.\n\nThe victims range in age from their teens to their 60's and came from across California and around the world, as far away as Singapore and India. Many had been on the boat before. The process to raise the boat is complicated and slow going. It could take days or even weeks.", "description": "Officials say it appears the 34 people killed died of smoke inhalation", "authors": ["Kris Van Cleave"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/02/89d4affc-8b8e-49a9-a0d7-f6c5270bfd9b/thumbnail/1200x630/91214808e3ea8619036baf726e8ea146/california-boat-fire-eddwb-qvuaiq3ld.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
