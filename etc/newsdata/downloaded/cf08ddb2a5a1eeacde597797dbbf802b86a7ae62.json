Now, the \u201ccurviest model ever\u201d to be featured in the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue has broken another barrier, becoming the first plus-size bride to cover The Knot.\n\nOn Friday, September 6th, McGrady took the stage at theCURVYcon 2019 to discuss the challenges she faced as plus-size bride, introducing the first-ever plus-size bridal fashion show, staged by The Knot and Kleinfeld, a leading bridal fashion retailer.\n\nModel Hunter McGrady at the 2018 Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue Launch Celebration.

The styles shown by both Macy\u2019s and Target featured bold, modern prints, exuberant hues, and cutting-edge styles like jumpsuits, leather, high-waist pants and all-white ensembles. All were styles any style-conscious women would want to wear, regardless of her body shape.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile Fashion Week events like TheCurvyCon \u2014 a three-day convention that brings together celebrities, body-positive influencers and their fans to celebrate diversity and fashion inclusivity \u2014 show that there\u2019s progress being made in embracing body positivity on the runway, McGrady is not surprised that the exclusive Victoria\u2019s Secret Fashion Show is rumored to not be taking place this year.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s women who are literally desperately saying, \u2018Please, please, please get bigger sizes, showcase trans women,\u2019\u201d she said of the feedback facing the lingerie brand.\n\nThis year\u2019s theCURVYcon is being live-streamed right here on Yahoo Lifestyle on Friday, September 6th and Saturday, September 7th, bringing the event\u2019s important and insightful conversation to anyone who can\u2019t not make the IRL event in New York City.", "description": "Plus-size model Hunter McGrady introduced the first-ever plus-size bridal fashion show.", "authors": ["Laura Kenney"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/BBPs71F0OAP9aOgv9Rcnag--~B/aD0yMTUwO3c9MzAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/a52fa330-d0c8-11e9-93f7-287b5becff09", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
