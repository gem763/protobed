Got a question for her? Email askaboss@nymag.com. Photo: The Cut\n\nDear Boss,\n\nI started a new job about four months ago. I\u2019ve been in customer-facing tech support for the past six years, and was excited to have my first non-customer-facing role. Now, I do mostly technical writing and lots of project-based content management, and I love it. I\u2019m an expert in the subject matter and it\u2019s been a great environment for me to utilize and expand my skill set.\n\n\n\nRecently, my boss has talked about wanting to implement a live chat messaging system where our users can ask questions in real time and get technical help \u2014 a sort of help desk. In theory this means that me and two other co-workers would man it, since we\u2019re the most experienced in this field.\n\n\n\nThis is devastating to me. I\u2019ve done my time getting chewed out by angry customers online and on the phone, carefully explaining technology they have no grasp of. I took this job specifically because I wanted to break out of customer service and focus on growing my actual skill set. I feel like because of my experience in customer service and my thorough knowledge of the product, I\u2019m being pigeonholed.\n\nI need some advice on how to approach my boss and explain that this is not a responsibility I\u2019m willing to take on without putting my job in jeopardy. In my offer letter, it said something like, \u201cthe job duties may change based on company need,\u201d but this is basically moving me into a completely different role. If I knew that doing customer service was going to be on the table, I would\u2019ve likely stayed at my last job, where I loved my boss and had a much more collaborative team.\n\n\n\nFor a little background, this is a very small company, and my boss (the owner/CEO) and I have almost zero relationship. We only really talk to discuss how projects are going or what direction they will take, so I don\u2019t feel very comfortable being candid with him or discussing my career path.\n\nIt\u2019s true that most job descriptions say something like, \u201cduties may change based on company need\u201d or \u201cother duties as assigned.\u201d But that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t push back! You can \u2014 especially when you have strong feelings about a task and especially when it\u2019s squarely outside the work you were hired to do.\n\nRight now, your boss probably has no idea that you don\u2019t want to take on the help-desk function, and he definitely doesn\u2019t know that you feel as strongly about it as you do. And if he\u2019s a decent manager, he doesn\u2019t want to demoralize a good employee or risk losing you by adding a hated duty that you weren\u2019t warned about before you signed on.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s possible that he could want to keep you happy and yet have no choice about needing to assign the work to you. Jobs evolve, and sometimes they change in ways that the people doing them aren\u2019t thrilled about. Sometimes managers do need to say, \u201cI hear you that you\u2019d rather not do X, but I need someone in this role who can take that on.\u201d\n\nBut other times, once they understand someone has very strong feelings about not taking on a particular task, managers are able to work around that. Sometimes that means pulling in others who don\u2019t mind as much. Sometimes it means restructuring your share of the work in a way that makes it more palatable to you. (For example, maybe you\u2019d be happy to advise the people staffing the help desk as long as you don\u2019t have to talk with customers directly.) Sometimes, a manager may even be open to rethinking the plan entirely (\u201cwe thought Jane would jump at the chance to do this, but since she\u2019s not, let\u2019s explore other approaches\u201d).\n\nThe more valued you are, the more likely your boss is to try to accommodate you. If you\u2019re fairly senior, in a hard-to-fill job, have a track record of excellent work, or have built up a lot of good will (such as by being flexible in the past), those things all help. In your case, you\u2019ve only been there four months, which makes it harder to check off most of those boxes, but your newness might work for you in a different way: You were just hired into a job that didn\u2019t include this work \u2014 and your boss probably doesn\u2019t want you to feel like it was a bait and switch.\n\nOf course, so far all of this is speculation. Your boss might turn out to be flexible, or he could refuse to budge. We don\u2019t know yet.\n\nSo, the first step is to talk to him. Ask to meet, and say something like this: \u201cI wanted to talk to you about the plans for the help desk. I took this job specifically because I wanted to get away from doing customer-facing tech support. It was the reason I began job searching, and it was a big factor in me signing on here. I love the work I\u2019ve been doing \u2014 it\u2019s exactly what I was looking for \u2014 and it\u2019s really important to me not to go back to customer support. I\u2019m hoping there might be a way to keep my job as it\u2019s been and not add this on to it.\u201d If your sense is that you could safely add this, you could also say, \u201cTo be fully transparent, I feel so strongly about this that if I\u2019d known the role would end up including a help desk component, I wouldn\u2019t have taken the job.\u201d\n\nAnd then see what he says. Based on how the conversation goes, at some point it might be useful to say, \u201cI want to be clear that I understand that jobs evolve, and in general I\u2019m very open to that. This just happens to be the one thing I was specifically changing jobs to get away from.\u201d\n\nFrom there, you\u2019ll get a better idea of whether there\u2019s some flexibility, or whether the help desk is now going to be part of your job regardless. If your boss isn\u2019t willing to budge, you\u2019ll need to decide if you still want the job under these conditions. (If that does happen, you might see if you can negotiate to have the assignment be temporary rather than permanent.)\n\nLast, I know you said you\u2019re not comfortable being really candid with your boss. But to give yourself the best chance of a good outcome here, you do have to open up a little. It\u2019s key for your boss to understand that you don\u2019t object to taking on new responsibilities in general, but changed jobs specifically to avoid this one.
