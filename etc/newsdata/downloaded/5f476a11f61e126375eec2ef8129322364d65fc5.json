Enjoy the holiday!\n\nOver the years, gold has developed a reputation as a \u201csafe haven\u201d asset. In other words, when riskier markets (like stocks or fiat currencies) crash, people flock to gold to protect their wealth.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn this way, gold\u2019s main role in a portfolio is as a chaos hedge or wealth preserver. This means investors don\u2019t typically buy gold believing they\u2019re going to see explosive gains like they might in, say, a high-flying tech stock.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean explosive gains can\u2019t happen \u2014 case in point, the last three months.\n\nOne of the most popular ways to invest in gold is the SPDR Gold Shares ETF (GLD). It\u2019s designed to track the price of gold. As you can see below, in the past three months, it has surged 20%, dwarfing the S&P\u2019s return of 5%.\n\nPretty nice?\n\nBut do you know how you could have done even better in gold over the last three months?\n\nGold miners.\n\nThe chart below shows the same S&P and GLD performance as above. But now it includes GDX, which is the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF.\n\nAs you can see, it has exploded 46% in three months, crushing both market and gold returns.\n\nWe\u2019ve been talking about gold a lot in the Digest this year. It was all the way back in January that we first brought up the \u201cstealth\u201d bull market in gold \u2014 well, it isn\u2019t all that stealthy any more.\n\nWhen we talk about gold here in the Digest, we usually reference it in the general sense, mostly noting gold\u2019s spot price. But there are different ways for investors to play gold, and gold miners can be an especially lucrative way. Think of them as \u201cgold on steroids.\u201d\n\nIn today\u2019s Digest, let\u2019s dig just a bit deeper into miners as an investment vehicle you might consider as this gold bull continues gaining steam.\n\n***Miners live by leverage and die by leverage\n\nGold mining can be tricky.\n\nFinding this precious metal takes talent and experience. That\u2019s the job of exploration/mining companies. They head out into the field with tenured geological teams to scour the earth for deposits, conducting estimates and studies. All of this requires patience, time, and a lot of money.\n\nBut the thing is, actually finding gold can have varying payoffs based on gold\u2019s market price at that time. When gold\u2019s price is soaring and a miner has found a new gold vein, then that elevated gold market-price enables the miner to pay off the various exploration costs and have plenty of profits left over.\n\nOn the other hand, if gold\u2019s market price is in the toilet, then even if a miner has found gold, the depressed market price may be so low that it can\u2019t adequately cover the cost of getting the gold out of the ground and paying all the related expenses.\n\nGiven this relationship, we often say that gold miners are a \u201cleveraged\u201d way to play changes in gold prices. When times are good for gold, times are usually great for miners. But when times are bad for gold, well, lots of miners don\u2019t survive.\n\n\n\n***A deeper dive into gold mining leverage\n\n\n\nJohn Doody is a legendary gold investing expert, and editor of Gold Stock Analyst, published by our sister-organization, Stansberry Research. He recently explained this dynamic in greater detail to his subscribers.\n\nFrom John:\n\n\u2026 the best gold stocks have leverage to gold prices. This happens in two ways \u2026\n\nStory continues", "description": "Gold is making a move \u2026 but for even bigger gains, here's where to lookNOTE: The stock market and our offices will be closed on Monday in observance of Labor Day.
