Lynch worked out for the team Tuesday, according to Ian Rapoport of NFL Network. The Steelers signed Lynch to the practice squad following that workout.\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, here's how]\n\nThe Steelers are in need of another quarterback after Ben Roethlisberger was injured during Sunday\u2019s game. Roethlisberger will miss the rest of the season due to elbow surgery.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nLynch, 25, hasn\u2019t appeared in a regular season game since 2017. He entered 2018 in a competition for the Denver Broncos\u2019 starting job, but was demoted to third string in the preseason. The Broncos released Lynch just days before the 2018 regular season.\n\nAfter spending the 2018 season as a free agent, Lynch signed with the Seattle Seahawks in January. Lynch appeared in three preseason games for the Seahawks, throwing one touchdown while completing 48.6 percent of his passes. The Seahawks cut Lynch in late August.\n\nDespite being selected by the Broncos with the 26th overall pick in 2016, Lynch has only started four games in the NFL. He\u2019s thrown four touchdowns against four interceptions during his career.\n\nIn what has become a common occurrence these days, the news of Lynch\u2019s workout was met with questions about former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick. The 31-year-old Kaepernick has released plenty of videos this offseason suggesting he wants another shot in the NFL. The Steelers were among the teams to lose a quarterback in Week 2, providing plenty of chances for Kaepernick to get a call.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile the Steelers took a shot on Lynch, the team isn\u2019t expecting him to see the field. Mason Rudolph, who performed admirably in Week 2, will be the team\u2019s starter going forward. A number of Steelers came out in support of Rudolph on Tuesday.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nChris Cwik is a writer for Yahoo Sports. Have a tip?
