A number of dynamics contribute to this, and most are grounded in the media and Congress. Next to impeachment, the other story with \u201clegs\u201d these days is the sex drama with fired NBC morning news anchor Matt Lauer.\n\nQuestion: Do our impeachment dramas have anything in common with our sex scandals?\n\nMaybe. Look at the last time we had an impeachment: The Cold War was over, it was the indolent and self-indulgent 1990s, Ross Perot took 20 million votes from George H.W. Bush, and \u201cpoof\u201d we had a new president from Arkansas who 1) \u201cfelt our pain,\u201d 2) couldn\u2019t keep his hands off the help and 3) couldn\u2019t help but lie about it. So, he lied about it under oath \u2014 and the Republican-led House impeached him for it.\n\nFor most of that wasted year we had an otherwise bored Congress engaged in impeachment, on the front page and leading the evening news. The Senate, surprising no one, could not convict lying Bill for lying under oath about sex \u201cwith that woman\u201d; however, Bill\u2019s presidency flamed out taking Al Gore \u2014 father of the Internet and global warming \u2014 along with him in 2001.\n\nThe lesson here: It\u2019s OK (with the Senate) to have sex with the help \u2014 especially if you include all past presidents (and way too many congressmen to count) \u2014 but you may be impeached by the House if you lie under oath about it. Nevertheless, and mostly because many senators have similar track records, you won\u2019t be convicted for extra-curricular sex and forced to leave office.\n\nThe connection? The current effort by the Democratic House to impeach Donald Trump is simply \u201cgetting even\u201d for the Republicans impeaching Bill Clinton, and the Democrats realize they likely will not \u2014 just like the Clinton impeachment \u2014 get the votes to convict in the Senate. Nevertheless, and again just like Bill Clinton, the current impeachment effort is directed tactically at the next election and will drag on accordingly.\n\nAnd when the media aren\u2019t jabbering about impeachment, they\u2019re jabbering about themselves. Most recently, it\u2019s the Matt Lauer sex scandal that led to NBC firing him and paying millions of dollars to \u201cmanage\u201d the negative publicity with victim \u201cnon-disclosure agreements.\u201d Now, a new \u201ctell all\u201d book accuses Mr. Lauer of forcible rape \u2014 and Mr. Lauer is engaged in a weird public exchange of accusations with the alleged victim.\n\nIn one of these odd exchanges between Mr. Lauer and his victim, their sexual activity is described as \u201ctransactional,\u201d perhaps a new description of sex between partners of unequal political/economic status. In fact, we should probably ask ourselves whether this dynamic isn\u2019t the real operative aspect of most sex dramas in \u201chigh places\u201d whether in Washington, New York or Hollywood.\n\nThe political connection here? Serial \u201ctransactional\u201d rapist Harvey Weinstein\u2019s perverted reputation was widespread, yet he gave lots of money to many Democratic candidates, including Hillary Clinton \u2014 and she accepted it. After all, she is still married to a very long history of \u201ctransactional\u201d sex with the help.\n\nFor historical example, but with some relevance to today\u2019s tawdry political dialogue, we can also recall some past covert sexual relationships \u2014 insofar as who they affected and what \u201cinside stories\u201d we were required to hear on the evening news as a result thereof.\n\nOne of my favorites in the \u201ctransactional sex\u201d category was the longtime affair between NBC News person Barbara Walters and married Massachusetts Sen. Edward Brooke. Ms. Walters was also allegedly involved with other prominent Washington men, including Alan Greenspan, who is now married to NBC newsperson Andrea Mitchell. Is it just me or does NBC seem like the epicenter of media sex stories?\n\nMore recently, we have Sen. Kamala Harris from California, running for the Democratic nomination for president. When the senator was a few years out of law school, she had an affair with married former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown, 30 years her senior. About the affair, Mr. Brown has said: \u201cYes, we dated. It was more than 20 years ago\u201d and \u201cyes, I may have influenced her career by appointing her to two state commissions when I was [California] Assembly speaker. And I certainly helped with her first race for district attorney in San Francisco.\u201d\n\nWhere do all these political and media soap operas take us?\n\nIn the famous words of Thomas Mann, \u201ceverything is politics\u201d \u2014 and it affects everything \u201creported\u201d as \u201cnews\u201d by our media, especially during the \u201csilly season.\u201d In this respect, we should remember Barack Obama\u2019s deputy at the NSC \u2014 brother of the then-CBS News president \u2014 description of the Washington media as \u201c27-year-old know nothings\u201d working in an \u201cecho chamber.\u201d As such, they are as politically compromised as career politicians, maybe more \u2014 and every bit as ambitious.\n\nIn far more practical terms, the media, acting with managed political force, clearly wants to see Donald Trump impeached and/or defeated in 2020. They can\u2019t help themselves \u2014 they\u2019re all in \u201cshow business.\u201d Don\u2019t believe it? Just listen to recent recorded insider reports that Jeff Zucker \u2014 who runs CNN \u2014 has a \u201cpersonal vendetta\u201d against Donald Trump.\n\n\u2022 Daniel Gallington writes about national security.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
