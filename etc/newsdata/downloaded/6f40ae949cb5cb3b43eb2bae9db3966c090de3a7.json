By comparison, their latest is a little bit derivative \u2014 but it could be a handy way to automatically back up your iOS or Android device when you plug it in at night.\n\nA note on crowdfunding: Crowdfunding is a chaotic field by nature: companies looking for funding tend to make big promises. According to a study run by Kickstarter in 2015, roughly 1 in 10 \u201csuccessful\u201d products that reach their funding goals fail to actually deliver rewards. Of the ones that do deliver, delays, missed deadlines, or overpromised ideas mean that there\u2019s often disappointment in store for those products that do get done. The best defense is to use your best judgment. Ask yourself: does the product look legitimate? Is the company making outlandish claims? Is there a working prototype? Does the company mention existing plans to manufacture and ship finished products? Has it completed a Kickstarter before? And remember: you\u2019re not necessarily buying a product when you back it on a crowdfunding site.\n\nThe company\u2019s new crowdfunded project is called the HyperCube, and it\u2019s a USB dongle that lets your phone charger double as a storage device. Drop it into your charger, pop a microSD card, USB flash drive, or even an external hard drive into one of its full-size female USB ports, connect your charge cable into the other, and the app can (allegedly) back up your phone while it\u2019s charging. It works with laptops as well.\n\nWhile I say \u201callegedly\u201d because it\u2019s an unfinished Kickstarter product, I don\u2019t seriously doubt the company\u2019s claims. For one thing, Sanho isn\u2019t some fly-by-night startup. It\u2019s delivered on Kickstarter promises before, and there\u2019s already a product on the market, the Maktar Qubii, that does much the same thing as the HyperCube. Sanho\u2019s advantage is that second USB port for external drives, plus a discounted early adopter price of $30. But if you don\u2019t need the second port and want to try the idea sooner, you can find the Qubii for $40 right now.\n\nHere\u2019s Sanho\u2019s Kickstarter page if you\u2019re interested. I\u2019m pretty happy with the incredibly powerful HyperJuice battery pack I bought there last fall, though that one may not be the best on the market when all\u2019s said and done.", "description": "Sanho\u2019s Hyper brand has brought us some pretty clever solutions to the shortcomings of today\u2019s smartphones, laptops, and tablets for years now, including a sleek, charger-mounted USB-C hub for MacBooks and wireless charging for AirPods before that was cool.
