(Tobias Schwarz/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nJens Wagner has worked the Frankfurt motor show for 20 years, selling hats emblazoned with car emblems for around 35 euros a pop, alongside T-shirts, jackets and miniature replica cars.\n\n\u201cIf you look around, you\u2019ll see for yourself what\u2019s happening,\u201d said Wagner, 47, pointing toward the thin crowds. \u201cLess people, less exhibitors, less everything.\u201d\n\nHe pines for what he remembers as the good old days, when roaring engines took pride of place ahead of whirring electric, when free markets prevailed over protectionism and when industry shows like this one really heaved.\n\nWhile the 10-day show still draws tens of thousands of visitors, the number of exhibitors this year fell from around 994 to 830 as large names like Toyota and Ferrari stayed away. Others cut space, saying that they needed to find new innovative ways to connect with customers.\n\nThe decline of Germany\u2019s biggest car show, which takes place every two years and wraps up this weekend, may say more about the public appetite for such events than about the auto industry itself, but it\u2019s emblematic of the struggle the wider sector faces.\n\nCarmakers are under pressure to lower emissions, transition away from gas and diesel and make autonomous driving a safe reality. The industry is still reeling from revelations that German car manufacturer Volkswagen cheated on emissions tests in an attempt to make its diesel engines look cleaner.

And when the car industry in Europe\u2019s largest economy is hurting, it can be bad news for the whole country \u2014 and the wider continent.\n\nA drop-off in manufacturing in Germany, particularly among carmakers, has led to a contraction that has economists warning that the country is probably headed into recession. Worried about the ripple effect, French policymakers are urging debt-averse Germany act to inject fiscal stimulus before it is too late.\n\nGermany\u2019s heavy dependence on exports leaves the country vulnerable to global trade fluctuations, with trade shrinking amid the uncertainty.\n\n\u201cFor Germany, that has a huge cost,\u201d said Marcel Fratzscher, president of the German Institute for Economic Research, pointing out that exports as a whole make up nearly 50 percent of Germany\u2019s GDP, compared with less than 15 percent of GDP in the United States. \u201cThis is the main reason that the German economy is actually now in recession.\u201d\n\nMost economists define a technical recession as two consecutive quarters of economic decline. Germany\u2019s economy contracted by 0.1 percent in the second quarter of the year compared with the previous three months. While definitive data for the latest quarter is not yet available, indications aren\u2019t positive.\n\nMonthly data for July was \u201creally horrific\u201d and showed the trend continuing, said Carsten Brzeski, chief economist at ING Germany.\n\n\u201cIt looks as though we are currently in a recession,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy is that? It\u2019s really because of manufacturing, it\u2019s because of cars, and it is because of [the] trade war and a series of other explanations.\u201d\n\nHenning Voepel, director of the Hamburg Institute of International Economics, said long-term trade trends bode poorly for Germany, which preferred the pre-Trump multilateral system based on \u201ccommon rules\u201d and a commitment to adjudicating disputes at the World Trade Organization.\n\n\u201cI think we will not benefit from the future model of the global economy, because that will, for sure, be based on power and not on rules,\u201d he said.\n\nIn his office above the cavernous halls of the car show, Bernhard Mattes, the president of the German Association of the Automotive Industry, said German car manufacturers that export cars built in the United States to China had seen a decline from 120,000 to 95,000 units last year.\n\n\u201cYou can see this is not a minor effect, this is clearly a really serious effect,\u201d he said. Trump has made the German car industry a favorite target for Twitter tirades, threatening to increase import tariffs on German cars.\n\n\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel checks out a Mercedes Vision EQS, an electric vehicle, after officially opening the show.

But with the pound weak and the future uncertain, German exports to the United Kingdom have dropped 40 percent since the Brexit referendum in 2015, including a 20 percent dive for automakers.\n\n\u201cThe numbers are quite clear: Brexit is costing the German economy already,\u201d said Gabriel Felbermayr, president of the Kiel Institute for the World Economy.\n\nCar manufacturers also worry about the possibility of a no-deal Brexit, without any managed transition to a new trade relationship. A sudden and chaotic Brexit could wreak havoc on their complex supply chains, which can involve parts crossing between Britain and Europe several times in the production process.\n\nBut German automakers also have to take some of the blame for what\u2019s happened, Felbermayr said: \u201cThe car industry is extremely important for Germany, and it\u2019s generally weak, it\u2019s losing market share in Europe, it\u2019s losing market share at home.\u201d\n\nThe trade war doesn\u2019t help, he said, but there are \u201chomegrown\u201d problems such as a sluggish switch-over to electric models \u2014 Chinese and U.S. companies have been quicker to act.\n\nWhile a recession technically may have taken hold, German economists said they did not expect it to be deep or severe \u2014 though uncertainty is the order of the day.\n\nThe potential for recession has put renewed scrutiny on Germany\u2019s zero-deficit policy, a long-standing commitment in a country where the word for \u201cdebt\u201d comes from the word \u201cguilt\u201d and where Germans shun credit for savings.\n\n\n\nThe ZF Friedrichshafen AG exhibition features a transparent safety display vehicle.

The red brick Opel administration building is part of a large industrial complex that has its own train station. Opel first started producing cars here in 1899. Formerly owned by General Motors, its purchase by French automaker Groupe PSA in 2017 was followed by redundancies.\n\n\u201cFifty years ago, R\u00fcsselsheim was only Opel, now it\u2019s less and less,\u201d said one 39-year-old employee as he stopped at a nearby grocery store, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was talking about his employer. \u201cEverything\u2019s okay if you don\u2019t look at the future.\u201d\n\nJeanne Whalen in Washington contributed to this report.\n\nRead more\n\nTrump\u2019s tariff threats suddenly look very real in the heartland of Germany\u2019s car industry\n\nGermans love their cars.
