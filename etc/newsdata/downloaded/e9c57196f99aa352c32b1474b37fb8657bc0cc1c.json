And then, the third level was the elevators. And that third jump you had to make to get up to get over, it took a while. But after you did it 50-60 times, you could make that jump and then you were set. You had a chance to set the high score.\u201d\n\nGundy continued: \u201cHe\u2019s on the barrels. No, I'm joking. The barrels is easy. He\u2019s on the structure now. And he\u2019s conquering that and he\u2019s working to get to the elevators. And he\u2019s probably past the first jump. The second one\u2019s not as bad. The third one\u2019s a tough one.\u201d\n\nWESTERN CAROLINA PUNTER SHOWS OFF SPEED WITH FAKE PUNT, TOUCHDOWN RUN\n\nGundy then had to explain how he knows so much about the classic arcade game.\n\n\u201cThere used to be a Godfather\u2019s Pizza up on Reno Avenue in Midwest City [Oklahoma],\u201d he said. \u201cI'd ride my bike up there and play \u2018Donkey Kong\u2019 all the time and set the high score. Can you imagine that? Kids riding their bikes? Nowadays nobody rides a bike anywhere.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nSanders and Oklahoma State play Texas Tech on Oct. 5.", "description": "Oklahoma State football coach Mike Gundy on Monday used the video game \u201cDonkey Kong\u201d to illustrate quarterback Spencer Sanders\u2019 progress in his first full season as a starter.", "authors": ["Ryan Gaydos", "Ryan Gaydos Is A Sports Reporter For Foxnews.Com", "Foxbusiness.Com.
