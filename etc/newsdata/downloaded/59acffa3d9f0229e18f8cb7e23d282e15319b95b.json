The Shanghai Composite gauge climbed 0.4%.\n\nIn Europe, the Stoxx Europe 600 edged up 0.2%, led by equities in Germany. The U.K.'s FTSE 100 index ticked up 0.3%, a day after the pound weakened and made British assets appear more attractive.\n\nSterling, which fell Tuesday after U.K. leaders clashed with their European counterparts over Brexit, edged up 0.1% against the U.S. dollar.\n\nInvestors moved toward haven assets such as gold. The precious metal rose 0.6% Wednesday and remained above $1,500 a troy ounce, a level it broke through for the first time in six years in August. It is up around 17% this year.\n\nLater Wednesday, investors are likely to listen closely to any fresh signals from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell in a speech in Kansas City. The Fed will increase its purchases of short-term securities soon in an effort to avoid stress in lending markets, Mr. Powell said Tuesday.\n\nThe U.S. central bank will later Wednesday release the minutes from its September meeting, which will likely be scrutinized closely for any insight into the interest-rate outlook.\n\nIn commodities, the benchmark for global oil, Brent crude, fell 0.2% to $58.11 a barrel.\n\nWrite to Anna Isaac at anna.isaac@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 09, 2019 04:54 ET (08:54 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
