The congregation raised millionsto create a new church after losing its fight to keep the historic Falls Church building \u2014 the iconic brick structure where George Washington worshiped.\n\nAD\n\nIt was a case that made national headlines. Church observers saw the court\u2019s decision as a harbinger for bitterly divided congregations across many of the nation\u2019s denominations, amid a worldwide struggle between conservative and liberal theology.\n\nBut this month, as The Falls Church Anglican celebrates its new home, members speak enthusiastically about their new location, rather than bitterly about what they lost.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI know it was the right choice. Seven is completion. It took seven years for us to get through this,\u201d longtime member Steve Uphill said.\n\n\u201cIt was such a long time coming. It already feels like home in so many ways,\u201d Penny Snare said.\n\nThe church purchased a $31 million, five-acre property with a five-story office building on it, and is generating income (on which it pays taxes, unlike on donations by parishioners) by renting out space to the building\u2019s tenants, most of which are medical offices. Falls Church Anglican added a parking garage, which the Rev. Sam Ferguson said cost more than $9 million, and finally the approximately 20,000-square-foot church building, which Ferguson said cost $17 million to build.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nClearly, this is a deep-pocketed congregation. But unlike many religious buildings funded by wealthy donors, no one\u2019s names are on the walls at Falls Church Anglican. There are no plaques or rooms named for those who donated money.\n\nFerguson said that was a choice, just like the decision to have plain windows instead of stained glass on the busy boulevard where the church sits. \u201cWe want people to see what\u2019s going on and feel very welcome,\u201d he said.\n\nThe church is just south of the building where the group began, but while that neighborhood was predominantly white and wealthy (like this congregation and Episcopalians nationwide, on average), their new location is in a neighborhood popular with recent immigrants. \u201cIt seems like a mile, but it\u2019s really a different world,\u201d Ferguson said. The church plans to offer live Spanish translation at services, starting with once a month. \u201cWe want to be a church where five years from now, our neighbors are glad we\u2019re here, rather than just indifferent or even discouraged that we create a traffic jam on Sunday mornings.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nJennifer Parker, a longtime member, said one of her hopes for the new building is that the congregation becomes significantly more racially diverse. \u201cThis is so beautiful,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is the new place God has for us. This is a place of blessing.\u201d\n\nIn 2006, members of The Falls Church voted overwhelmingly to leave the Episcopal Church. The deciding factor was the appointment of a gay man as a bishop.\n\n\u201cThe ordination of a practicing homosexual as bishop was the flash point that showed how far the repudiation of Christian orthodoxy had gone,\u201d the Rev. John Yates wrote at the time. Nowadays, Ferguson and members of his church say that it was the right decision, though they tend to emphasize that it wasn\u2019t just about the presence of a gay man in church leadership.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe Episcopal Church \u2014 I believe they take their cues more from culture than Scripture,\u201d said Parker\u2019s son, David Parker. \u201cFor us, there\u2019s only been one way we believe is the way. And that\u2019s not a popular belief anymore.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe Episcopal Church is the United States\u2019 incarnation of the Church of England. The breakaway Falls Church congregation, along with a handful of other Virginia churches, came up with a novel workaround. They chose to abandon the U.S. church and instead come under the leadership of an Anglican bishop in Nigeria, who had gone so far as to endorse a law which would make gay sex punishable by imprisonment.\n\nToday, Falls Church Anglican is one of more than 1,600 churches in North America that identify as \u201cAnglican,\u201d not \u201cEpiscopal\u201d \u2014 a new evangelical denomination that rejects the Episcopal embrace of LGBT inclusion but maintains similar liturgy.\n\nAD\n\nThe Virginia churches that broke away argued that they, not their denomination, should keep their buildings and bank accounts. The denomination argued that individual members \u2014 even most of the members of a particular church \u2014 could choose to leave a church at any time, but couldn\u2019t take with them the property that belonged to the Episcopal Diocese of Virginia.\n\nAD\n\nThe Falls Church Anglican fought the case longer than any other in Virginia. In 2012, the state Supreme Court sided with the Episcopal diocese, and the Anglicans moved out, meeting in temporary spaces including a Catholic high school auditorium.\n\nThat left the Episcopal Church the owners of a historic building in need of a congregation.\n\nAD\n\nJust 35 people had decided to remain Falls Church Episcopalians when the church split. During the years of the court battle, that number grew to 80, who moved back into the contested building when the ruling came down in their favor.\n\nIt was far too small a group, they knew, to support a space that had recently housed 2,000 every Sunday.\n\nToday, The Falls Church Episcopal, less than a mile from the new building of its conservative counterpart, has almost 600 members, according to the Rev. John Ohmer, who has been rector since 2012, but recently announced he will leave for another church position.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very large space for a relatively small group of people. I\u2019ve learned to not look at the empty chairs. I\u2019ve learned to look at the people,\u201d Ohmer said.\n\nAD\n\nThe small group manages the financial burden of the large church, he said, by renting out the building that was once the church\u2019s education wing as retail space, and by spending the interest generated by the once-contested $2 million bank account that the Virginia courts ruled belonged to the Episcopal church.\n\nThe Falls Church Anglican shrank from about 2,000 worshipers each week to about 1,200 in the years without a building. Some of those members left for the six new Anglican churches that this congregation has helped launch throughout the region..\n\nFerguson hopes the new space will attract new and larger crowds. And he is awed to have made it to this point: \u201cIf you just drove up to a church,\u201d he mused, \u201cwith 2,000 members, 55 staff, and you said, \u2018If they lose everything, do you think they\u2019ll still be together in seven years?\u2019 You\u2019d say, \u2018No way. Not a chance.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe proud new spire overlooking Arlington Boulevard says otherwise.", "description": "The congregation broke away because of its opposition to LGBT inclusion, and instead spent millions on a church of its own.", "authors": ["Julie Zauzmer", "Reporter Covering Religion", "Faith"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/I_yv9mbiHCUHdgZkWxA9vMNhznU=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/U3CQZFXN54I6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
