Or he owned a clothing store. He seemed like somebody.\n\nFor Richard Rogers, a budding filmmaker from the Los Angeles area, Mr. Sims was also a welcome relief.\n\nMr. Rogers was 24 years old and had just three days to find an affordable apartment when he spotted the perfect place on Craigslist in August 2017. It was perhaps strange that the building wasn\u2019t really in North Hollywood, Calif., as Mr. Sims had advertised, but in tourist-trap Hollywood proper instead. But for just $900 a month\u2014a steal\u2014the two-bedroom luxury apartment would be his for the next few months.\n\nJust like Mr. Rogers, Mr. Sims was tight on time. He sent Mr. Rogers a photo of a pregnant woman in a hospital bed. His girlfriend was just about to give birth, Mr. Sims said, and together they would soon need to move into a different apartment.\n\nMaybe sending the maternity ward photo to a stranger was eccentric, but Mr. Sims was just so easy to deal with, Mr. Rogers said. \u201cThe dude was a good actor. He was so calm. He was so understanding.\u201d\n\nShare Your Thoughts Have you been the victim of a sublet scam? At what point did you figure out it was fraud? What tipped you off? Join the conversation below.\n\nThe young filmmaker would soon realize he was the victim in a Hollywood heist scene beyond his creative control. There was no pregnant girlfriend in the hospital, but a different girlfriend, away on vacation, and a boyfriend with the keys to her apartment, intent on duping someone into thinking they could just move right in. It was unclear whether anyone named James Sims was involved. The James Sims Facebook page Mr. Rogers had checked out was deleted soon after.\n\nSimilar scenarios are playing out in cities and college towns across the country. For most young people, rent is a huge expense; wasting a month\u2019s worth, or two, on a scam can have catastrophic financial consequences. Those with little financial wherewithal and dependent on finding a decent deal\u2014often in a hurry as life situations shift\u2014are extra vulnerable.\n\nRental scams aren\u2019t new, but as more platforms and services to find an apartment have spread online in recent years, so have the available avenues for crime. Renters on a deadline, combing webpages for a place in their price range, are being enticed with listing photos and back stories that seem legitimate, but ultimately end in grift. Money quickly changes hands, but the deal itself evaporates.\n\nHollywood cop Patrick Aluotto, who in an interview modestly described himself as a \u201cbottom-of- the-mill\u201d burglary detective, said he sees 10 new sublet complaints in his district each month. Unlike police in some other cities (the Austin, Texas, police department said its officers \u201cdo not investigate rental scams that begin on free internet advertisement websites\u201d), Detective Aluotto is chasing down his leads.\n\nUniversity of Michigan senior Mackenzie Hans, 21, at her new apartment.

She found a place online that looked pretty good: $850 for a bedroom in Cambridge, Mass., the home of Harvard and MIT and her area of choice.\n\nThe sublessor, one Marisela Slawson, said she was out of town and wouldn\u2019t be able to show the apartment in person.\n\nThat was fine by Ms. Hans because she wasn\u2019t able to make a special trip out to Cambridge before summer started anyway. Ms. Slawson then asked Ms. Hans to wire her the $850 security deposit, which she did, but then later insisted the first month\u2019s rent had to be paid in bitcoin cryptocurrency.\n\n\u201c If I had lost that money, I would have had to move back home. \u201d \u2014Richard Rogers\n\nSuspicious, Ms. Hans eventually asked Ms. Rosen to take a look. Ms. Rosen did a little digging and called the building manager. There was no Marisela Slawson living at the apartment in question.\n\nMs. Hans filed a police report, but to no avail. \u201cBasically the response I got from the detective was: \u2018You know it\u2019s really hard to track these things\u2026don\u2019t expect anything,\u2019\u201d Ms. Hans said.\n\nFor Detective Aluotto as well, many cases are too complicated to solve on his own, especially ones involving players outside Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cWhen you start talking about wiring money across state lines, it\u2019s way beyond my job,\u201d he said.\n\nHe refers such cases to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The FBI declined to make anyone available for an interview on the subject of sublet scams.\n\nThe bureau\u2019s website, however, does offer some sharp advice on how to avoid becoming a victim: Deal only with landlords and sublessors that you know are local. A deal that seems too good to be true probably is. Treat a request to wire money with suspicion.\n\nMs. Rosen said wire transfers should be treated like cash: Once you give the money away there\u2019s no way to cancel the transaction. A legitimate sublessor or landlord should be willing to accept an alternate and safer form of payment, she said, such as a personal check. \u201cA landlord\u2019s request for payment by wire transfer is a big red flag,\u201d she said.\n\nFor renters picking out a place remotely, she said potential tenants should insist on a virtual tour of the apartment to make sure it exists\u2014and that the sublessor has access to it.\n\nMs. Rosen and Ms. Hans also recommend doing as much research as you can on the property and the sublessor, to make sure they have the right to offer the property in the first place. Many cities have websites where you can look up properties and see who owns them, Ms Rosen said. You can then contact the owner to make sure the sublet is real.\n\nBack in Hollywood, Mr. Rogers was savvy enough to cancel the money orders for his sublease before it was too late. With his rent money gone, his life as an independent adult might have come to an abrupt halt.\n\n\u201cIf I had lost that money, I would have had to move back home,\u201d he said.\n\nWrite to Will Parker at will.parker@wsj.com", "description": "For young people, wasting rent money on a scam can have huge financial consequences.
