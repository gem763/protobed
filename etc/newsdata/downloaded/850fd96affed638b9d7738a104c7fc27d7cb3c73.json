More than 2.4 million cases of the three sexually transmitted diseases were reported last year, an increase of more than 100,000 from the previous year.\n\nThose figures include an alarming increase in congenital syphilis, which occurs when an infected mother passes the disease to her baby during pregnancy. Congenital syphilis led to 94 newborn deaths in 2018, the CDC said.\n\nHalf the STDs were reported in people between the ages of 15 and 24. Men who have sex with men were also disproportionately affected by the increase in STD rates. The CDC noted that its figures underestimate the total number of STDs nationwide because many people with these conditions don't show symptoms.\n\nSTD rates had been gradually declining for decades until the trend reversed in recent years. In the mid-2000s, \u201cgonorrhea rates were at historic lows, syphilis was close to elimination,\u201d the CDC said.\n\nWhy there\u2019s debate:\n\nAs with any public health issue, the causes are complex and multilayered. But a handful of factors have been identified as the primary drivers of the increased rates of STDs.\n\nThe CDC pointed to \u201cdeteriorating public health infrastructure\u201d and \u201clack of access to health care\u201d as major sources of the increase. A Trump administration policy that blocked certain health clinics from receiving federal money and rerouted some of those funds to religious health centers has been the target of specific criticism.\n\nOther potential causes include the stigma of STDs, drug use, a decrease in condom use and poverty.\n\nSome see the increased rates as a side effect of success in other areas. A push to make STD testing more accessible might be leading to more people being screened than before. Others posit that the effectiveness of HIV treatment and prevention has led to fewer people relying on condoms.\n\nPerspectives\n\nFederal funding is going to religious health centers that are ineffective as STD prevention\n\n\u201cThe Trump administration\u2019s revised Title X rule has not only forced hundreds of clinics that provide comprehensive reproductive healthcare to forego federal funding \u2026 but it\u2019s also allowed that money to go to organizations that are openly opposed to evidence-based methods of preventing STIs and unintended pregnancy, namely condoms and birth control.\u201d \u2014 Marie Solis, Vice\n\nSome people may be getting STDs from nonsexual activities\n\n\u201c...the uptick in heterosexual syphilis transmission seems closely tied to recent drug use epidemics, and could potentially be addressed in tandem by offering better access to counseling and healthcare.\u201d \u2014 Rachel Feltman, Popular Science\n\nStigma against STDs makes people afraid of getting tested\n\n\u201c...if we keep fear-mongering the public, folks won\u2019t get tested, so we\u2019re stymieing our efforts before they even begin, and that\u2019s probably the most disheartening point of all.\u201d \u2014 Jenelle Marie Pierce, executive director of TheSTDProject.com, to Salon\n\nSuccessful HIV treatments are leading to less reliance on condoms\n\n\u201c...there\u2019s been some concern about a shift toward riskier sexual behaviors [among men who have sex with men] \u2014 like not wearing condoms \u2014 that may be contributing to the rise in STDs. The reason for this shift has been explained by everything from the success in treating HIV (and therefore making unprotected sex less scary) to the advent of PrEP (pills that can prevent HIV).\u201d \u2014 Julia Belluz, Vox\n\nThe Great Recession gutted federal health funding\n\n\u201cCertain STDs had been declining in the 1990s, and in 2000 syphilis was close to being eliminated. STDs simply weren\u2019t seen as much of a threat. \u2026 But after the recession ended, state and local funding for STD programs never came back.\u201d \u2014 Olga Khazan, the Atlantic\n\nConservative abortion policies are leading to a broad decrease in sexual health\n\n\u201c...the surge is just one of the many expected negative outcomes of the Trump administration\u2019s assault on sexual and reproductive health \u2014 and there will be more to come.\u201d \u2014 Twanna A.
