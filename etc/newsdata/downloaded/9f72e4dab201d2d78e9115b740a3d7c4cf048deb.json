They were indicted on federal campaign finance charges that allege they conspired to funnel foreign money to pro-Trump and Republican groups and filed false disclosures about the hundreds of thousands of dollars in political contributions.\n\nParnas and Fruman introduced Giuliani to top Ukrainian political circles, according to multiple reports. And Parnas told the Miami Herald last month that he provided the Trump administration with information on alleged wrongdoing by Trump\u2019s 2020 rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden, via his friendship with Giuliani.\n\nWhen quizzed by reporters on his relationship with the pair following their arrest Thursday, the president was on the defensive.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know those gentlemen. Now, it\u2019s possible I have a picture with them, because I have a picture with everybody, I have a picture with everybody here, but somebody said there may be a picture or something at a fundraiser or somewhere, but I have pictures with everybody. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s anybody I don\u2019t have pictures with,\u201d he said, as seen in a clip posted by ABC.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know them, I don\u2019t know about them, I don\u2019t know what they do, but, uh, I don\u2019t know, maybe they were clients of Rudy, you\u2019d have to ask Rudy. I just don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nImages of Trump with the pair have since been circulated. One image, posted on Facebook by Parnas in May 2018, shows the businessman with Trump at the White House. He thanked the president for an \u201cincredible dinner and even better conversation.\u201d\n\nUkrainian-American businessman Lev Parnas is seen in a 2018 social media post appearing to show him at the White House with President Donald Trump in a screen capture from his social media account made in 2018 by the Campaign Legal Center and released after his arrest Thursday.

Vice President Mike Pence was also pictured with the four of them at the event.\n\nAnother image posted on Facebook by Parnas, also in May 2018, was captioned \u201cpower breakfast !!!\u201d and included a #Trump2020 hashtag. The photo shows Donald Trump Jr. with Fruman and Parnas at the Beverly Hills Polo Lounge.\n\nDonald Trump Jr., left, Trump campaign fundraiser Tommy Hicks Jr., Ukrainian-American businessman Lev Parnas and Belarus-born businessman Igor Fruman in a 2018 screen capture from Parnas' social media account made by the Campaign Legal Center and released by the CLC on Thursday.
