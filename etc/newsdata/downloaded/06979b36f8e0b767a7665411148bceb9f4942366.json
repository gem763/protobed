Chrisopher Lane CLA\n\nIt is a stunning contrast to the combat sports stereotype where the Conor McGregors of the world broadcast to anyone who will listen that they were destined for greatness from a young age. Whittaker\u2019s opponent for the UFC middleweight championship on Sunday, Nigerian-born New Zealander Israel Adesanya, is a case in point.\n\nUndefeated in 17 MMA fights, the slick and telegenic Adesanya tells AFR Weekend, \u201cIt didn\u2019t take me long to know that I was different to other fighters.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy my fourth fight I knew I could be the best of all time,\u201d he says. Adesanya is an articulate, 1.9 metre tall former kick-boxing champion who goes by the moniker \u201cthe last style-bender\u201d \u2013 a Millennial hat tip to the lead character in the Avatar: The Last Airbender cartoon series.\n\nA star is born\n\nWorking with head coach and mentor Fabricio Itte, Whittaker eventually let go of his career as an electrician and committed himself to becoming Australia\u2019s inaugural UFC champion. \u201cUp until that stage I had coasted along on talent alone, training patchily 10 to 15 times a week. We now punch out more than 30 sessions a week, and I\u2019m the strongest, fittest and sharpest I've ever been.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe UFC is the world\u2019s highest valued sporting league at more than $US7 billion. It stages 40 live events around the world each year and has a global athletic talent-base with current male and female champions hailing from America, Australia, Brazil, China, Dagestan and Nigeria.\n\nAt schools around Australia, Brazilian jiu-jitsu (or BJJ) has become a self-defence craze, popularised by the UFC\u2019s high-profile champions. Whittaker himself teaches it to aboriginal children via his personalised program, which is launching a dedicated gym in Artarmon, Sydney.\n\nIsrael Adesanya at Marvel Stadium. Joe Armao\n\nSunday's fight against Adesanya will be broadcast to 172 countries and a global audience of more than one billion viewers. And with a share of the pay-per-view pie, Whittaker stands to earn millions.\n\nLives invert\n\nThere is a curious inversion in the lives of Whittaker and Adesanya that will come full circle in the UFC\u2019s cauldron. Whittaker was conceived in poverty in an ostensibly wealthy country, Australia, to a Caucasian army infantryman and a Maori-Samoan mother. Immediately before his birth, his mother travelled to Auckland to be with her family, only to return her son within one month to Australia where he was raised.\n\nAdesanya, by way of contrast, grew up in a \u201cvery privileged and well-off family\u201d in superficially poor Lagos in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cFor me, life was easy in a place where it could be anything but,\u201d he says. But at age 13 his parents decided to take their five children in search of better education, eventually landing in Rotorua, New Zealand.\n\nWhereas the graceful and flamboyant entertainer Adesanya, who is also a formidable dancer, looks like the second coming of Muhammad Ali \u2013 and has the chat to match \u2013 Whittaker projects authenticity, humility and respect.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKnown for refusing to engage in the trash-talk that often characterises these affairs, Whittaker\u2019s disciplined outer veneer shields a smouldering intensity forged through personal and professional adversity. You can see it when he walks into the UFC\u2019s \u201coctagon\u201d and beats the southern cross tattoo above his heart that his father paid for; it's a tribute to his nation and the man he admires most, he says. It is evident again when \u201cThe Reaper\u201d, as Whittaker is known, locks his eyes onto adversaries with an ice cold, deathly intent.\n\nWars of attrition\n\nIf it took Whittaker 26 years to believe he could be a champion, it would take less than three months for that belief to be tested to its limits.\n\nWhittaker's next fight had him in his first battle for the UFC\u2019s middleweight strap against the chiselled Cuban Yoel Romero. An Olympic silver medallist in freestyle wrestling, Romero had been lauded as one of the greatest athletes to ever compete in MMA.\n\nWhittaker lands a blow in his bout with Yoel Romero in 2018. AP\n\nTwo weeks before facing-off against the Cuban adonis, Whittaker tore the medial collateral ligament (MCL) in his knee. As Whittaker tells it, 23 seconds into the first round Romero \u201cstomped on the knee, caving it in and exacerbating the MCL damage\u201d.\n\nIn the break between rounds, Whittaker can be heard telling his coach that the \"left leg is completely f---ed\". \u201cFrom that point forth my knee buckled every time I threw a jab, cross or hook,\u201d he recalls with a grimace.\n\nAgainst the odds, a lame Whittaker managed to will a win, three rounds to two, accenting the victory by prevailing over the Olympic wrestler in a grappling exchange in the final minute. It's the sort of skill and bravery that has boxing great Danny Green describing Whittaker as Australia\u2019s premier fighter across all combat disciplines.\n\nThe rematch 12 months later in Chicago is ranked by experts as among the greatest MMA fights ever. It began looking like it would be a one-sided event with Whittaker striking at will and obliterating Romero\u2019s orbital bone around his right eye.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYet my Romero curse struck again,\u201d Whittaker says. \u201cLate in the opening round I badly broke my right hand, losing all feeling up to my elbow.\u201d The injury would eventually require serious surgery to insert a plate and screws.\n\nFor Whittaker, it should have been the end of the contest. The Australian was reduced to throwing left jabs, right elbows and kicks. Defending his right-side from Romero\u2019s explosive punches became almost impossible. He was soon dropped and was rocked repeatedly thereafter. In the end Whittaker clung on and landed enough blows to outpoint Romero in an even closer split decision than the one a year earlier. He was lucky not to be finished outright in the final few minutes.\n\nThe legacy of these two fights has been long-lasting. Whittaker was due to defend his title in Melbourne in February, but the night before the fight he suffered a twisted and collapsed bowel coupled with a hernia. Rushed in for emergency surgery, the doctors who opened him up said it looked like he had been in a car crash. That means Sunday's contest will be his first fight in 16 months, and just his fifth in three years.\n\nWhittaker celebrates a win in 2016. Darrian Traynor\n\nKnown-unknown\n\nAll of which adds up to arguably the great known-unknown of Sunday's fight: did the Cuban wars empower or enfeeble him. Whittaker concedes that the undefeated 30-year-old Adesayna, hailed by many as the next \u201ctranscendental\u201d MMA star, is the best striker he\u2019s faced.\n\nUFC president, Dana White, perceives parallels between Adesayna\u2019s rapid ascent after merely six octagon victories and icons like Conor McGregor and Ronda Rousey.\n\n\u201cThere are similarities in their trajectories,\" White says, \"and the minute I met Adesanya I knew he could be a star.\u201d White expects Australian interest in the home-grown hero will mean the UFC will sell-out Marvel Stadium.\n\nWhittaker's defence of his title on Sunday will depend on how much farther his injury-prone body takes him. Nick Moir\n\nBeyond both being aggressive Antipodean strikers who were born in foreign countries, Whittaker and Adesayna share another commonality: a passion for gaming. Indeed, Whittaker, who is admired for his intelligent, sniping fight IQ, says his single greatest strength \u2013 solving complex problems \u2013 has been honed by his fixation with strategic games.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdesayna appears no less cerebral in systematically unravelling opponents with precision punches and kicks, and claims he is the \u201creal player one\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether a higher power put me in this position, but I feel like I am playing with cheat codes right now,\u201d he says with typical bravado.\n\nWhether Whittaker prevails on Sunday, and however much farther his injury-prone body takes him in the fight game, he has a refreshingly modest view of life after the octagon.\n\n\"I just want to get my teaching \u2018quals\u2019,\" he says. Asked why, Whittaker explains that he wants to get a registered training organisation to push his Gracie Aboriginal Pathways program into the wider community, \"Which will allow me to pass on my own life lessons about the value of discipline, integrity, and respect.\"\n\nMore power to him.", "description": "It took 26 years for the champion fighter to believe he could win a UFC title.
