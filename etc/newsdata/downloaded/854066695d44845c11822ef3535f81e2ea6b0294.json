Motherfucking shut the fuck up and stay in your motherfucking place. Go drink your motherfucking milk, bitch. Fuck.\u201d\n\nAlthough she did not name the perpetrators in her rant, it seems clear that the offenders she had in mind are the four 10-year-old brothers.\n\nJust what did these kids do to earn Cardi\u2019s ire?\n\nWell, it appears that the professional rapper, who has sold over five million albums worldwide, was enraged by a diss track the boys posted two weeks ago, which included lines such as \u201cThey could fix your teeth, but they couldn\u2019t fix your face,\u201d and \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s faker: your life or your butt.\u201d\n\nTo illustrate the concept, one of the youngsters dances around with a pillow down his pants, as you can see in this video below, which also includes the Cardi clapback.\n\nOne of the creators of the ruinous diss was in an after-school club when contacted for comment by Page Six, and told the interviewer he would have to be quick or his mom would start yelling at him.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to show Cardi B to not be a bully and give her a taste of her own medicine,\u201d the rapper who identified himself as Hollywood said, adding that Cardi responding to the track \u201cmade us feel like we\u2019d done our job.\u201d\n\nYou tell her, kid.", "description": "They dissed her fake butt.
