We'll finish our preparation off tomorrow and we'll be ready.\"\n\nkca/dmc\n\nMANCHESTER UNITED\n\nCELTIC PLC", "description": "Tottenham's ambitions after reaching the club's first Champions League final and moving into a stunning new stadium were to kick on and challenge Liverpool and Manchester City for major honours this season.  \"We need to improve and I think all the players in the squad feel the same that", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/os/mit/media/m/social/images/social_default_logo-1481777.png", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
