The loss ended the Sooners\u2019 22-game winning streak in true road games.\n\nTrailing by 25 points early in the fourth quarter, Oklahoma made a furious comeback attempt, scoring 18 unanswered points. But the Sooners couldn\u2019t recover an onside kick attempt with 1:45 left, and the Wildcats ran out the clock.\n\nOklahoma QB Jalen Hurts was 19-of-26 passing for 395 yards and a touchdown, and he added 96 yards and three touchdowns on the ground.\n\nNo. 1 Alabama 48, Arkansas 7\n\nSophomore quarterback Mac Jones passed for 235 yards and three touchdowns in his first collegiate start as the Crimson Tide routed the visiting Razorbacks in Tuscaloosa, Ala.\n\nJones completed his first five attempts, although the first two were merely flips to receivers Jerry Jeudy and DeVonta Smith, on his way to an 18-of-22 outing in place of injured Heisman Trophy candidate Tua Tagovailoa, who watched from the sidelines.\n\nRunning back Najee Harris rushed for 86 yards and two touchdowns as the Crimson Tide (8-0, 5-0 SEC) posted their 31st consecutive home win and their 89th straight victory over a non-ranked opponent.\n\nNo. 2 LSU 23, No. 9 Auburn 20\n\nJoe Burrow passed for one touchdown and ran for another as LSU passed its stiffest test of the season, holding off Auburn in Baton Rouge, La., to remain unbeaten.\n\nLSU had its lowest-scoring game of the season, but Burrow was still outstanding.

Smith was intercepted once and sacked five times.\n\nNo. 21 Appalachian State 30, South Alabama 3\n\nMarcus Williams Jr. and Raykwon Anderson powered the Mountaineers\u2019 rushing attack and the defense dominated the Jaguars in Mobile, Ala.
