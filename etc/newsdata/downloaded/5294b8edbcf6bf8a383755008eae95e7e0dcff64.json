One of those apps just happens to be one of our favourite password managers, LastPass, which supports the Pixel 4's biometric unlock capabilities.\n\nAssuming you\u2019ve already set up facial recognition data on your Pixel 4, LastPass users can get into all their saved apps and accounts with just their smilin\u2019 mug\u2014but first, you need to turn the setting on in LastPass.\n\nOpen the LastPass Android app. Tap the three-stacked dots icon. Tap \u201cSettings,\u201d then \u201cSecurity.\u201d Scroll down and turn on \u201cUse biometrics to unlock.\u201d\n\nWith this option turned on, you\u2019ll see a new prompt asking to use your face when logging into an app or website synced with LastPass. Line up your face and once your phone recognises it\u2019s you, then tap \u201cConfirm\u201d to log in without needing a password.\n\nNow, as convenient as this is, we\u2019d be remiss not to mention that the Pixel 4's facial recognition is a lot less secure than it is on other phones. Google says it\u2019s looking into a fix, but it could be months before anything changes, so use the feature with caution\u2014especially if it can be used by your password manager.", "description": "Despite being so new, plenty of third-party apps already support some of the Pixel 4's unique features.
