There are times when it is useful for a company to make a fresh start. It\u2019s nothing personal,\u201d board chairman Jean-Dominique Senard told reporters at Renault\u2019s headquarters outside Paris.\n\n\u201cThe revival of the alliance (with Nissan) was necessary,\u201d he said.\n\nRenault and Nissan were plunged into turmoil after Ghosn\u2019s arrest last November, prompting investigations of governance failings and deep revamps of their management structures.\n\nMedia reports had speculated that Nissan executives were demanding that heads also roll at Renault over claims that Ghosn under-reported millions of dollars in salary as head of Nissan and used company funds for personal expenses.\n\nGhosn has denied any wrongdoing, but both companies ousted him while he remains in Japan awaiting trial.\n\nSpeculation of Bollore\u2019s departure increased after French daily Le Figaro reported on its website late Tuesday that he had a difficult relationship with Senard.\n\nA source close to the company told AFP that Bollore had made his case at the board meeting, where \u201che was blamed for management and performance failings\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere was a vote. No board member opposed his dismissal, and there were very few abstentions,\u201d the source said.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Always been loyal\u2019 \u2013\n\nBollore, a 56-year-old with long experience in the auto industry, rejected claims of performance failings, saying in an interview published ahead of the meeting that his only fault was being named deputy CEO by Ghosn in February 2018.\n\n\u201cThe brutality and the totally unexpectedness of what is happening is stunning,\u201d Bollore told financial daily Les Echos.\n\n\u201cI got in a plane in Tokyo on Tuesday night (and) when I landed in Paris on Wednesday morning, I saw in the press that Jean-Dominique Senard, who up to now always said there wasn\u2019t a hair\u2019s breadth between us, wanted my departure,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI have always been loyal to him,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all the more inexplicable because Renault is one of the very few automakers which hasn\u2019t had to issue a profit warning despite the crisis the industry is going through,\u201d he said.\n\nBollore also urged the French state, which owns 15 percent of Renault, to halt a \u201ccoup\u201d that risked destabilising the automaker further.\n\nFinance Minister Bruno Le Maire appeared to side with Senard in a brief statement after the meeting.\n\n\u201cWe want the alliance to begin a new chapter, with a clear industrial strategy to address significant challenges, like autonomous and electric vehicles,\u201d he told reporters.\n\n\u2013 Turbulent year \u2013\n\nSenard was brought in from tyremaker Michelin as board chairman, tasked with stabilising Renault and its alliance with Nissan and Mitsubishi in the wake of Ghosn\u2019s arrest.\n\nHis job was complicated by declining profits, in part due to falling sales at Nissan, in which Renault owns a 43 percent stake.\n\nAnd despite Renault\u2019s leading position in electric vehicles, Senard is also grappling with the industry\u2019s need to cut carbon emissions, and the push by all automakers to bulk up in the face of slumping demand and fierce competition.\n\nThat led Renault to pursue a merger with Fiat Chrysler earlier this year, which would have created a globe-spanning behemoth producing 8.7 million vehicles a year.\n\nBut the project foundered, and Senard blamed the French government for blocking the deal because it did not involve Renault\u2019s Japanese partners, who were reportedly furious at being kept in the dark about the Fiat talks.", "description": "Paris (AFP) \u2013 French automaker Renault sacked its chief executive Thierry Bollore Friday, the latest turbulence to rock the company since his", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/12/eb8cb9_it-personal-renault-chairman-jean-dominique-senard-on-bollore-sacking-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
