(Image: Luke Ross and Lee Loughridge, Marvel Comics)\n\nThe Last Jedi may have brought an end to Admiral Ackbar, but this is Star Wars. And what is Star Wars if not story of multi-generational legacies, of children taking up the fights of their parents?\n\nLast night StarWars.com gave us our first look at Star Wars: Allegiance #2, next week\u2019s entry in the newly-begun tie in comic prequel to Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker from Marvel Comics.\n\nDirectly leading into the events of the film, Allegiance (which kicked off yesterday) has seen General Leia Organa, with Rey, Chewie and Rose Tico in tow, head to Mon Cala in an attempt to convince the Mon Calamari and Quarren to once again join her in taking arms against a tyrannical foe.\n\nGiven everything the planet has suffered in the time since doing so \u2014 including Ackbar\u2019s shocking, sudden death in the Resistance\u2019s retreat from D\u2019Qar \u2014 Leia and her allies don\u2019t exactly get a warm welcome, with Allegiance #1 ending with her and the crew of the Millenium Falcon being held at blasterpoint. But the new preview released for Allegiance #2 shows that not everyone on Mon Cala sees Leia as a threat: say hello to Aftab Ackbar, son of Gial.\n\nAftab intervenes in a standoff in Allegiance #2. (Image: Luke Ross, Lee Loughridge, and Clayton Cowles, Marvel Comics)\n\nIt\u2019s cool to see Ackbar\u2019s passing \u2014 sudden as it was, as is often the case in war, star-based or otherwise \u2014 acknowledged through the lens of his people and his family, but it seems like Aftab\u2019s story is only just beginning.\n\nLast week as part of the merchandise based mass hysteria that was Star Wars\u2019 Triple Force Friday \u2014 the unveiling and unleashing of oodles of The Rise of Skywalker related products onto store shelves \u2014 fans got glimpses at a few new characters in the movie in the form of a series of new cardboard standees being sold using official photographs.\n\nAlthough many were familiar faces like Rey and Kylo Ren, or known newcomers like Jannah and Zorii Bliss, there were a couple of intriguing additions among the standees, including this unnamed \u201cResistance Mon Calamari General\u201d:\n\nThe unnamed Resistance General included among the new cutouts.

Luke Ross and Lee Loughridge\u2019s artwork in Allegiance #2 might be the first time we\u2019ve been introduced to Aftab but... don\u2019t these two look the same?\n\nTwo fishmen, both alike in dignity, in fair Mon Cala, where we lay our scene. (Image: Luke Ross and Lee Loughridge, Marvel Comics,Image: Disney)\n\nThe coloration between the two is alike, in both skin tone and eye colour (give or take some lighting on the photo of the real prosthetic). The creases and markings on Aftab\u2019s face do, as well. It seems that, through a bizarre amalgamation of cardboard cutout and prequel comic, we\u2019ve just learned that we\u2019re going to see an Ackbar in a Star Wars movie once more. It might not be the one we know and love, but it\u2019s an Ackbar carrying on in his spirit \u2014 a very Star Wars thing indeed.\n\nThis is still all rather speculatory, of course. All we have is a cardboard standee and some preview pages. But if it ends up being true, trust that the absurdity that is the most random kinds of Star Wars merchandise to give us weird snippets of potential information like this is a thing when it comes to the galaxy far, far away. It wouldn\u2019t be the first time!\n\nWe\u2019ll find out for sure if Aftab\u2019s future lies within the Resistance as Allegiance continues next Wednesday, and ultimately when Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker hits theatres December 19.", "description": "The Last Jedi may have brought an end to Admiral Ackbar, but this is Star Wars.
