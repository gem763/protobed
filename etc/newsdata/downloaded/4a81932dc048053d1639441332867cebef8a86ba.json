He has called for advocates of Hong Kong independence to be \u201ckilled without mercy,\u201d merrily welcomed intervention by Chinese troops to quell the unrest and uttered profanities against his political opponents in the Legislative Council.\n\nPublic rage against him mounted in late July, after a mob of men swinging wooden poles rampaged through a train station in Mr. Ho\u2019s district, indiscriminately beating protesters, passengers and journalists, and leaving 45 injured. As the city was processing the spasm of violence, a video emerged of Mr. Ho glad-handing with the thugs and calling them \u201cheroes.\u201d\n\nMr. Ho said he was simply greeting his constituents, but he also suggested the perpetrators were trying only to protect their community from the maelstrom of political protest.\n\n\u201cGuarding your homeland is a very basic thing,\u201d he said at a news conference he organized the next day, during which he pushed back against those who accused him of having a hand in the attack.\n\nThe demonstrations, prompted by a now-abandoned bill that would have allowed the extradition of criminal suspects to the mainland, have morphed into a cri de coeur against Beijing and its efforts to chip away at Hong Kong\u2019s hallowed freedoms. The leadership\u2019s decision to invoke emergency powers for its mask ban only heightened fears about the erosion of civil liberties, prompting more violent protests and clashes with the police on Friday night.", "description": "In a city roiled by political animus, Junius Ho, a pro-Beijing lawmaker, is gleefully fueling the divide by praising the police and demonizing the protesters.", "authors": ["Andrew Jacobs"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/06/world/05juniusho-1/00juniusho-1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
