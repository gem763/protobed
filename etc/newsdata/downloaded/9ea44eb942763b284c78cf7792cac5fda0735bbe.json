U.S. Government/DigitalGlobe/Handout via REUTERS\n\n(Reuters) - The style of attack used against oil plants in Saudi Arabia that knocked out half of the country\u2019s production on Saturday is unlikely to be a risk in the United States, energy and security experts say.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. oil industry has a lot of redundancy,\u201d said Amy Myers Jaffe, senior fellow for energy at the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nU.S. refineries go offline often after accidents or storms, with little impact to the market, Jaffe said. Even production in the country\u2019s biggest oil field, the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico, is spread across thousands of wells in a 75,000- square-mile (194,250-square-kilometer) region. The kind of gas-oil separation facility hit in the attacks in Saudi Arabia is done in smaller plants located across U.S. oil fields.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty hard to imagine some group having people here and they\u2019re going to fly a drone over the Houston Ship Channel or over Newark and somehow it\u2019s not going to be noticed,\u201d Jaffe said. \u201cCould you knock out one company\u2019s crude processing unit and throw them offline? I suppose. You\u2019d have to go down to Midland, Texas, and get away with it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would be more concerned about cyber vulnerability,\u201d Jaffe added.\n\nThe United States has more of a geographic buffer than Saudi Arabia and lacks hostile neighbors, said Ben West, security analyst with the intelligence firm Stratfor. The most vulnerable infrastructure, pipelines, can be repaired quickly, West said.\n\n\u201cEven if there were an attack, it\u2019s unlikely to knock out half the U.S. oil and gas production,\u201d West said. \u201cI think Iran is much more likely to be able to successfully carry out a cyber attack than a cruise missile or drone attack, and it\u2019s still an unlikely scenario.\u201d\n\nSecurity for U.S. energy infrastructure was tightened in the years following the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks to include tighter inspection standards and better backgrounding and credentialing of workers, said Henry Willis, a senior policy researcher at the RAND Corporation.\n\n\u201cWe do know that once someone figures out a way, others learn,\u201d said Willis. \u201cI imagine if you\u2019re responsible for facilities security and you haven\u2019t done it already, you\u2019re assessing how you account for drone threats.\u201d", "description": "The style of attack used against oil plants in Saudi Arabia that knocked out half of the country's production on Saturday is unlikely to be a risk in the United States, energy and security experts say.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190916&t=2&i=1430630419&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8F1U9", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
