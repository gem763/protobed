Wishing you a long life so you can continue to help and inspire future generations,\u201d Sanchez wrote on his Instagram page.\n\nEncarnacion and Sanchez are among the Dominican natives who have drawn inspiration from Ortiz on the field and off the field. As Sanchez put it before Friday's series opener in Boston, Ortiz is a legendary figure in their home country.\n\nFrom ESPN:\n\n\"I was really happy to see him and to see him healthy. He's a legend in the Dominican Republic and for all of us Dominican players. I played against him in 2016, and he was always good to me and gave me really good advice.\"\n\nNo baseball rivalry will ever come between friendship and respect.

There\u2019s a lot of guys who have stopped by throughout,\u201d Cora said. \"A lot of energy, obviously lost some weight. He\u2019s back to eating mangu and salami and all that good stuff. He\u2019s good. He\u2019s in a good place.\u201d\n\nCora also noted that Ortiz has been paying attention and \u201cwatching every game\u201d the Red Sox have played this summer.
