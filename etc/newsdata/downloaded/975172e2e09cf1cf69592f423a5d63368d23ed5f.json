Mr. McDermott will act as an adviser until the end of the year.\n\nMr. McDermott became CEO in 2014 after rising through SAP's ranks, starting as the CEO of SAP America in 2002 and becoming co-CEO of the entire company in 2010. Prior to SAP, he had spent nearly two decades at Xerox Corp.\n\nActivist investor Elliott Management Corp. in April said it had taken a stake worth 1.2 billion euros ($1.32 billion) in SAP, calling the business-software company undervalued.\n\nMs. Morgan joined SAP in 2004 and most recently ran its cloud-computing business. Mr. Klein was SAP's chief operating officer.\n\nSAP Thursday also announced preliminary third-quarter results, including per-share earnings of 1.04 euros ($1.14), beating analysts' expectations of 0.82 euros per share.\n\nWrite to Asa Fitch at asa.fitch@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 10, 2019 19:41 ET (23:41 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
