He trialled OK, not great at Happy Valley,\u201d Shum said.\n\n\u201cHis last run was not bad, 1,400m which isn\u2019t suitable for him yet and he finished fifth, that means he is running well and it was in good time too.\n\n\u201cHis last 400m especially was very good so we were hoping for a good draw but we didn\u2019t get it so we will see how he finishes.\u201d\n\nJockey Karis Teetan will ride the three-year-old with Joao Moreira hopping back on the Caspar Fownes-trained Green Luck after his first-up victory this season.\n\nPlaya Del Puente is one of six runners for Shum on the night as he looks to continue his strong start to the season.", "description": "He did his best work on a synthetic track in the north of Ireland, so Danny Shum Chap-shing\u2019s Playa Del Puente could not find himself further from home on Wednesday night at Happy Valley....", "authors": ["Trenton Akers", "Tom Biddington"], "top_image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/700x400/public/d8/images/methode/2019/10/07/12faed8c-e89a-11e9-9e8e-4022fb9638c4_image_hires_142549.JPG?itok=3ysKARTk&v=1570429557", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
