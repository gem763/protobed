But coaching superstars \u2013 particularly LeBron \u2013 brings its own challenges. Spoelstra aced those tests.\n\nHerro must still prove himself beyond exhibition games. His defense in particular could be a liability. But Waiters has set such a low standard. It wouldn\u2019t be surprising for Herro to eclipse him, even as a rookie.\n\nThat\u2019s the bigger problem beyond these latest incidents. Waiters is a substandard player due major money ($27.5 million over the next years). His attitude only makes the situation worse, but there\u2019s no easy way for the Heat to handle him.", "description": "The Heat suspended Dion Waiters for (at least) their season opener due to \"a number of unacceptable incidents this week, culminating with his unprofessional conduct on the bench last night.\"", "authors": ["Dan Feldman"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/rnEG0gMnlN0AGtywMaA7lw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/NVjKW1JTR3YmvxO501IdBQ--~B/aD01NzY7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/nbcsports.com/d57a865c594ac2d33c55af5a9201cae4", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
