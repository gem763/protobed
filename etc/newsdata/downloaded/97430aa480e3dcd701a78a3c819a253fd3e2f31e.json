The demon Chris pretended to be the irritatingly unexcited Linda Johansson. Bad Janet played Good Janet. Vicky\u2019s dressed up as Michael. And now this week we get Jason as Glenn as Jason, and Michael as Vicky as Michael. (Got all that?)\n\nBut we haven\u2019t talked enough about perhaps this season\u2019s most important undercover persona: Architect Eleanor. Kristen Bell has been doing something different with her voice and carriage whenever she plays Eleanor in Architect mode; and her pitch has been evolving throughout the season. Eleanor initially played this part with exaggerated authority, to compensate for her panic. But as she\u2019s grown into the role, she\u2019s begun to master its precise tone, which is part kindergarten teacher, part wizened sage. The point is always to instill confidence in the Neighborhood\u2019s new human subjects that there\u2019s a wonderful purpose behind everything they\u2019re being subjected to.\n\nIn this week\u2019s episode, Eleanor adopts this reassuringly calm demeanor to cover for the loss of Janet. She pretends this is a normal, wholly intentional development, meant to reconnect the residents with \u201clo-fi\u201d activities like knitting and gardening \u2026 or, in the case of the actual humans, swimming and water-skiing at a luxurious lake house. (\u201cSuck it, gardeners!\u201d a stoked Brent says, to which Simone mutters, \u201cWhy do I feel like that\u2019s not the first time he\u2019s screamed those words?\u201d)\n\nBut when Chidi surprises everyone by staying back in his apartment to read, Eleanor has to put on her best Architect voice to keep him occupied and unconcerned \u2026 because chaos reigns outside his window. With Bad Janet chained by incapacitating magnets, the team has to rely on Derek \u2014 the misbegotten bot who drinks champagne glasses filled with Scrabble tiles \u2014 to manage the Neighborhood\u2019s basic functions. Inevitably, within hours, all the Janet Babies are bumping into each other and saying, \u201cBargdy-bargdy-bargdy-bark.\u201d\n\nEleanor\u2019s big idea to keep Chidi from seeing the bumbling Janetoids is to pretend she knew all along Chidi wouldn\u2019t go to the lake house, and that she\u2019d already planned a kind of open-ended puzzle to entertain him. Without explaining the rules of the game or how to win, she tells him to keep looking around his apartment for \u201cclues.\u201d She convinces him that he can trust her, because she knows everything about him \u2026 which is true, in a way. Eleanor is at her most Architect-like \u2014 and movingly so \u2014 when she\u2019s using her bond with Chidi to steer him toward safety and happiness.\n\nComplicating matters for Eleanor \u2014 but making this episode much, much funnier \u2014 is that she\u2019s stuck throughout the day trying to mop up messes made by a well-meaning Tahani. Frustrated that she\u2019s been assigned to play hostess to the humans, Tahani urges Eleanor to give her more responsibility. (\u201cInsert me, coach-man!\u201d) But she keeps overstepping while trying to pitch in. She tells Chidi that the prize at the end of his game will be \u201cthe truth about the universe.\u201d When a blindfolded Chidi hears a frustrated Eleanor kick one of the Janet Babies, Tahani explains that \u201ca unicorn died,\u201d then tries to clean that lie up with an even worse one, saying the noise was just \u201ca regular horse that someone stabbed in the head.\u201d\n\nJameela Jamil has her best episode so far this season, playing all of Tahani\u2019s ineptitudes and insecurities. She fusses over the snack menu at the lake house, proudly announcing that she\u2019s serving \u201cfull-sized sandwiches\u201d because it would be improper to set out finger-sized ones at a waterfront property. (\u201cWhat am I, Welsh?\u201d she quips to Eleanor, who exasperatedly answers, \u201cAre you? I don\u2019t know!\u201d) When Eleanor complains that Tahani has \u201cmade things difficult in a new way,\u201d she half-proudly trumpets, \u201cThe important thing is, I did something.\u201d At times it feels like this entire episode is designed to feed The Good Place fan community a bunch of new Tahani memes and GIFs. (I look forward to the \u201cno context the good place\u201d Twitter account posting, \u201cThe whatever spoon is really only used for certain festive jellies.\u201d)\n\nManny Jacinto is on top of his game this week too, as Jason and Michael attempt their daring Janet-rescue in the Bad Place. (\u201cPopulation: Your Mom.\u201d) The nattily attired pair arrives just in time for DemonCon, where Shawn is planning to introduce his innovation of the Michael-suit. Seizing the moment, the actual Michael pretends to be Vicky in the Michael-suit, with Jason posing as Glenn in a Jason-suit, ready to torture Janet.\n\nJason is hilarious through all the Bad Place scenes, as he keeps looking for opportunities to throw a Molotov cocktail or to use Bad Janet\u2019s demon-exploder. His ability to destroy things \u2014 and to stroll blithely through the wreckage \u2014 serves the good guys well, allowing them essentially to walk into the headquarters of all evil, grab their Janet, and walk back out. Jason\u2019s ability to forgive himself also helps him ease the mind of Michael, who hates having to confront the demon he used to be. \u201cIt\u2019s okay to plead guilty about the things you used to do,\u201d Jason says, reminding Michael that he\u2019s now \u201cjust a weird happy old dude.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s ultimately the point of all the disguises these characters wear. When Vicky mentions that she\u2019s having trouble getting into character as Michael because she doesn\u2019t understand his \u201cmotivation,\u201d Janet replies that Michael is motivated by loyalty, empathy, and love \u2026 and that\u2019s why he\u2019ll prevail. If these demons and humans keep pretending to be better than they are, who knows? Over time, they may get good at being good.\n\nIn the Neighborhood\n\n\u2022 This was a really funny episode, and there\u2019s a lot of this season left to go, but\u2026 I have to admit that I don\u2019t think the whole \u201cnew humans\u201d plot arc is working yet. For the past two weeks, Brent, John and Simone have essentially been sequestered from the main action before the first commercial; and then the writers have contrived some excuse to get Eleanor a scene or two with Chidi. It reminds me of that old sitcom trick of introducing a pregnancy subplot to goose ratings, and then ignoring the characters\u2019 babies once they\u2019re born. This may be a problem for the show down the road, since the eventual improvement/redemption of the Neighborhood\u2019s new additions seems essential to the story this season is telling. The Good Place throws curveballs frequently, though, so maybe I\u2019m being unduly alarmist.\n\n\u2022 It was nice of the Jacksonville Jaguars to pick up another QB whose name is fun to shout. (\u201cFOOOOOLES!\u201d)\n\n\u2022 Shawn is in rare form at DemonCon, addressing forward-thinking torture questions like, \u201cSharp sticks: Should they be, counterintuitively, less hot?\u201d He gets downright enthusiastic discussing the potential of the human-suit program, asking the convention\u2019s attendees to imagine humans getting tortured by someone who looks like \u201ctheir wife \u2026 or ex-wife \u2026 or some mouthy broad.\u201d He also expresses something essential about his values when explains why it\u2019s time to move on from the tried-and-true torture tactic of butthole-spiders: \u201cHumans get used to it, and worse, the spiders get bored.\u201d", "description": "Jason and Michael\u2019s daring attempt to rescue Janet from the Bad Place makes good on the season\u2019s ongoing use of disguises.
