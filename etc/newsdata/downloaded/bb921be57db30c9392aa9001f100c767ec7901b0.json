Irish police are also carried out inquires in relation to the movements of the Irish-owned truck, thought to have arrived in the UK independently from the trailer through the port of Holyhead in north Wales on Saturday.\n\nThe Chinese Embassy in London says it had sent a team to Essex, and Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said police had not yet been able to verify the nationalities of the deceased.\n\n\u201cWe hope that the British side can as soon as possible confirm and verify the identities of the victims, ascertain what happened and severely punish criminals involved in the case,\u201d she told a daily news briefing.\n\nChina\u2019s state-owned Global Times newspaper, seen as a mouthpiece for the ruling Communist Party, said in a Friday editorial Britain should bear some responsibility for the deaths.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that Britain and relevant European countries have not fulfilled their responsibility to protect these people from such a death,\u201d the tabloid said.\n\nRepeated warnings of the rising threat of people-smuggling via Belgium were issued by British authorities in the past three years.\n\nThe Home Office was advised in a 2016 report to \u201cprioritise\u201d Border Force visits to smaller east coast ports to deter criminals from using them.\n\nThe report, by the independent chief inspector of borders and immigration, said coverage of smaller ports, harbours and marinas along the east coast was \u201dpoor\u201c and that officers had not visited 27 of the 62 smaller east coast ports in the 15 months leading up to June 2016.\n\nAdditional reporting by agencies", "description": "Organised Chinese criminals called\u00a0\u201csnakehead\u201d gangs are well know for\u00a0people smuggling, prompting some to speculate that they may have a hand in the deaths of\u00a039 people found in a refrigerated lorry trailer in Essex.
