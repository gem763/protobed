First, you need to decide what sort of crypto wallet you need, and then you consider specific wallets to find the best one for you.\n\nBitcoin wallets differ by security, convenience, coin support, level of privacy and anonymity, user interface, customer support, fees, built-in services, and other variables.\n\nThe most common distinction between Bitcoin wallets is whether they are cold or hot. Cold wallets refer to offline storage, while hot wallets are connected to the internet most of the time.\n\nThe online wallets are more suitable for daily use but aren\u2019t secure, while offline wallets are less convenient for frequent use yet are more secure.\n\nHowever, the distinction between the Bitcoin wallets doesn\u2019t end there.\n\nFive main types of Bitcoin wallets\n\nThere are five sorts of Bitcoin wallets that you can choose from: hardware, desktop, mobile, web, and paper wallets.\n\nHardware wallets. These are Bitcoin wallets that store your private keys on devices like USB sticks. Hardware wallets are mostly cold and very secure, but they also cost a bit of money, so it\u2019s recommended to get one only if you plan to store over $1000 value in crypto assets for a long time.\n\nPopular hardware Bitcoin wallets include devices by:\n\nLedger\n\nTrezor\n\nKeepKey\n\nBitLox\n\nBitcoin hardware wallet by Ledger.\n\nDesktop wallets. Desktop wallets are installed on personal computers or laptops. If the device is constantly connected to the internet, they classify as hot. Generally, they are regarded as secure, yet they are vulnerable to various malware and computer viruses.\n\nElectrum\n\nJaxx\n\nExodus\n\nWasabi Wallet\n\nMobile wallets. Mobile wallets, like desktop ones, are software wallets. Unlike desktop Bitcoin wallets though, they are significantly smaller and simpler. They serve as a convenient on-the-go wallet for daily usage.\n\nJaxx\n\nBreadwallet\n\nExodus\n\nElectrum\n\nSamouraiWallet\n\nMyCelium\n\nWeb wallets. These are online wallets that are considered less secure than other types of wallets, yet they can be highly convenient. Web wallets include browser plugins, website wallets, exchange wallets, and others. Popular web wallets include:\n\nCoinbase\n\nGuarda\n\nGreenAddress\n\nBinance\n\nXapo\n\nRahakott\n\nPaper wallets. Paper wallets are generally classified as cold storage. The term \u201cpaper wallet\u201d generally refers to a physical copy or paper print of your public and private keys. Other times it means software used to generate a pair of keys along with digital file for printing. Whichever the case, paper wallets can grant you a relatively high level of security. You can use Bitcoin Paper Wallet Generator to generate a paper wallet for Bitcoin.\n\nThe main risk that comes with Bitcoin paper wallet is that it may not be durable enough, so you should consider its storage conditions before making one.\n\nThis is how Bitcoin paper wallet looks like.\n\nWhat kind of Bitcoin wallet do I need?\n\nLook for an online Bitcoin wallet (aka \u201chot\u201d) that\u2019s web-based and runs as an app on your phone (one can find a bitcoin wallet for Android and a bitcoin wallet for iOS) or a program on your computer if:\n\n- You only need to store a small amount of bitcoin, which wouldn\u2019t be too painful to lose;\n\n- You're looking for good user experience;\n\n- You can only afford a free wallet;\n\n- You\u2019re not concerned about privacy;\n\n- You want web access to it from a mobile device or computer;\n\n- You trust a third party to safeguard your wallet;\n\n- You need to share the wallet with someone else.\n\nConsider an offline (aka \u201ccold\u201d) Bitcoin wallet for storage (e.g., paper bitcoin wallet or hardware bitcoin wallet), if:\n\n- You need to store a large amount of bitcoin and security is a top priority;\n\n- You don\u2019t need to use it often or access it anytime, anywhere;\n\n- You prefer to safeguard your funds yourself rather than trust a third party;\n\n- You\u2019re ready to pay for hardware (typically from about 50 to a couple of hundred dollars);\n\n- Privacy is very important to you.\n\nYou can, however, use both types of wallets: a cold one for storing bitcoins, and a hot one for spending them.\n\nHow to evaluate a specific Bitcoin wallet\n\nAsk these questions to evaluate a specific Bitcoin wallet properly:\n\n- Does it only support Bitcoin or can it store other cryptocurrencies as well?\n\n- If it's a web wallet, does the address begin with HTTPS? That offers greater security than an HTTP wallet.\n\n- How secure is authentication? Does it provide two-factor authentication (username and password plus some piece of information only you have)?\n\n- Does it have a multi-signature feature (if you want to use a wallet with multiple owners)?\n\n- Is the wallet \u201chierarchical deterministic\u201d (HD), meaning it will always use a new Bitcoin address to receive payments and so enhance the security of your money?\n\n- How transparent is the wallet provider? Do you know who they are?\n\n- Has the company behind the wallet published the wallet's code and is it open source?\n\n- Is the wallet simple to use?\n\n- Is there a way to back up the wallet?\n\n- What does the community have to say about the wallet? Check forums like Bitcoin Reddit or Bitcoin Forum.\n\n- For a hardware wallet, what do you think about its design, user interface, manufacturer reputation, and price?\n\n- Are there any fees that you will have to pay for the provided services? If so, what are they?\n\nA hardware Bitcoin wallet by Trezor\n\nNote that this information is only for general educational purposes.
