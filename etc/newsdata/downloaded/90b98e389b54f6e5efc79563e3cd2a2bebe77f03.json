The yield on the 10-year Treasury TMUBMUSD10Y, +1.06% has fallen from about 3.2% in November to 1.75%, a signal of the market\u2019s concern with the state of the economy.\n\nJames Bullard, president of the St. Louis Fed, told reporters at a conference on monetary and financial policy why he didn't see negative rates as an option even during a recession.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a fan of this type of policy,\u201d said Bullard, who is one of the more dovish members of the Fed and argued for a half-point rate cut in September. \u201cI think that negative rates have only had mixed results where they\u2019ve been tried, and I also think that the U.S. short-term financing markets has differences from other markets and other economies.\u201d\n\nBullard said it\u2019s not clear, for instance, how the money market would adapt.\n\nGertjan Vlieghe, a member of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee, answered an audience question about why the U.K. central bank doesn\u2019t believe interest rates can drop below 0.1%. The current Bank of England base rate is 0.75%.\n\n\u201cThe lower bound is not only about switching to cash. There is this important element of bank profitability in the financial system,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother issue is the types of assets on the balance sheets of each country\u2019s institutions, and whether they are indexed to the policy interest rate, he said. \u201cAnd so to me it is absolutely no surprise that different central banks and different economic areas come to a different conclusion about how low that is.\u201d\n\nRelated: Fed\u2019s Bullard says ignoring the yield curve has burned him in the past", "description": "It\u2019s no longer unprecedented for a central bank to bring interest rates below zero, given that Swedish Riksbank and the European Central Bank have done so.", "authors": ["Steve Goldstein", "European Markets Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT315_bullar_ZG_20191015095610.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
