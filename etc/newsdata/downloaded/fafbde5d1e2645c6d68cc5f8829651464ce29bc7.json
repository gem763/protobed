Now, though, she is said to be relinquishing all her roles and titles.\n\nUnlike WeWork, an office co-working company, WeGrow is an education-focused company.

He has since given back the money for the naming rights, and committed to giving his profits from the related real-estate deals back to the company.\n\nWhile Adam will remain on as non-executive chairman of the board, his role as chief executive is being filled by Arthur Minson and Sebastian Gunningham, two WeWork execs, who will serve as co-CEOs.", "description": "Rebekah Neumann, co-founder of WeWork and wife of Adam Neumann, will relinquish her roles and titles at WeWork as the company prepares to go public.", "authors": ["Ben Gilbert"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d540e96cd97842b653076f8?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
