Details given were sparse, but the device appears to effectively be the original Google Wi-Fi hardware in an updated chassis\u2014which Google hopes you'll find attractive enough not to hide away in a cabinet\u2014with the addition of an onboard smart speaker. Google did claim that Nest Wi-Fi delivers \"up to two times the speed\" and \"25% more coverage\" but with no technical detail, it's difficult to expect much concrete out of that.\n\nThere was no mention of Wi-Fi 6 support or anything else notable on the actual Wi-Fi front, but the addition of Google Assistant and a smart speaker in both the Nest Wi-Fi Router and Nest-Wi-Fi Point (satellite nodes) means fewer devices necessary for those who want to audibly command Wi-Fi setups, eg \"Hey Google, pause the Wi-Fi.\"", "description": "The second generation of Google Wi-Fi includes a Google Home smart speaker.", "authors": ["Jim Salter"], "top_image": "https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/nest-wifi-760x380.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
