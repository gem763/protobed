We\u2019ll enjoy this win, but we go again.\u201d\n\nLooking inspired, Jones' men now await the winner of Sunday's other final four showdown between Wales and 2007 winners South Africa.\n\nAfter this display, the Red Rose will return to Yokohama next Saturday as favourites to be crowned world champions for a second time.", "description": "ENGLAND 19-7 NEW ZEALAND: Eddie Jones' side dominated throughout with returning George Ford starring in Yokohama", "authors": ["Alex Richards", "Image", "Afp Via Getty Images", "Getty Images", "Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20728649.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Rugby-World-Cup-Semi-Final-England-v-New-Zealand.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
