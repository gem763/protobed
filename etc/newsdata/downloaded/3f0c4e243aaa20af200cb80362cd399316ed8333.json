The expenditure covered police deployed across County Clare in June.\n\nTrump\u2019s visit to Doonbeg was his first since he was elected president in 2016 and involved about 3,820 members of the Irish police service, the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na, working overtime at a cost of \u20ac7.49m.\n\nThe Trump Organization bought the resort, which has fairways designed by the Australian golfer Greg Norman, in 2014. It has spent \u20ac40m, including the purchase price, on expanding and upgrading facilities that include a spa, restaurants and cottages. Trump has visited six times, calling the resort \u201cterrific\u201d and \u201cincredible\u201d.\n\nTrump acts as if he is above the law.

The president bypassed Dublin by landing at nearby Shannon airport, then flew by helicopter to Doonbeg, where he was kept away from protesters by a major security operation that included Irish troops. Nevertheless, some locals believe the US president provides the region with an economic lifeline.\n\nThe payments to Doonbeg, which emerged following a freedom of information request, have been noted in the US by ethics campaigners who are already seeking to hold the president to account over concerns that he is profiting from the presidency.\n\n\u201cWhen Trump insisted on going way out of his way to stay at his luxury golf resort in Ireland in June, the Irish government ended up paying his business, which he still profits from, more than \u20ac113,000,\u201d tweeted Robert Maguire of the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.\n\nEarlier this month Trump dismissed suggestions of impropriety over his vice-president\u2019s stay at Doonbeg and the US military\u2019s use of an airport near his Turnberry golf course in Scotland.\n\nThe US president tweeted that he had \u201cnothing to do\u201d with Mike Pence\u2019s stay and \u201cknew nothing\u201d about the official use of the airport near his course.\n\nA US congressional committee has been investigating whether increasing expenditure at the airport and allegations of US military personnel being offered discount deals at Trump\u2019s Ayrshire golf resort represent a violation of the US constitution.\n\nTrump\u2019s stays at his own properties \u2013 the most high profile of which has been Mar-a-Lago in Florida, as well as government and diplomatic use of his hotel in Washington, have increasingly raised eyebrows.\n\nDuring the G7 summit in Biarritz in August the US president also suggested that the 2020 summit should be held at his golf resort in Doral, Florida.", "description": "Ethics campaigners raise concerns over bill for US president\u2019s visit in June", "authors": ["Ben Quinn"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36c731d995303f565049ba761f6c022b7e4d7c77/0_131_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=10b0d1990b10afa2293bb5c66b65de68", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
