Live episodes reveal how TV was before recording and editing, and separate the acting wheat from the chaff.\n\nThere have been two-handers, with just two characters engaging, and in 2008 EastEnders broadcast a one-hander featuring only Dot (June Brown), reminiscing about her life with husband Jim.\n\nIncreasingly, though, longer stretches of dialogue are creeping into the main narrative. At this year's British Soap Awards, Best Scene went to Gail's monologue about Aidan's suicide in Corrie.\n\nWritten by Jonathan Harvey, it was masterful and confirmed this writer as one of the finest today.\n\nA few weeks back, he penned an extraordinary heart-to-heart between Paul and Billy, and Sinead's monologue last week was as great a piece of writing as you'll ever see.\n\nSuch moments remind us that far from being the poor relation of drama, soaps deliver week-on-week incredible writing, created by the hardest-working people in the business. Mr Harvey: make room on your mantelpiece; there'll be another award coming.\n\nEASTENDERS: THE CORE OF IT\n\nThis Halloween in EastEnders, Honey (pictured with Adam) decides to put her mouth to better use in a major snogfest with Adam\n\nAnything that prevents Mick from opening his mouth is always good news, so we must be grateful for Halloween at the Vic, which will see a whacking great apple between his teeth.\n\nI suppose it\u2019s too much to hope that he swallows it whole and is shut up for good?\n\nIn the absence of fruit, Honey decides to put her mouth to better use in a major snogfest with Adam \u2013 there\u2019s way too much lip-locking this week.\n\nOne can\u2019t help wondering what she\u2019s consumed, though, as she asks Mick for relationship advice (Henry VIII would be a better choice, to be honest). It\u2019s a big night for Whitney, too, when sparks fly between her and Leo (give the woman some bromide; is any man safe?).\n\nAt the end of the night, they share a passionate kiss (I told you), but what is he not telling her? Boy, she can really pick \u2019em.\n\nThere\u2019s a mystery looming when the Panesar brothers arrive in Walford, but who and what are they there for? It\u2019s certainly not for the nightclub scene.\n\nAnd will everyone shut up about flamin\u2019 Portugal. Go, why don\u2019t you all! Or just get blotto on the great Portuguese Mateus Ros\u00e9.\n\nCORONATION STREET: THE FAB FOUR\n\nIn Coronation Street Chesney (right) proposes to Gemma (left) but why he chooses a cable car is anyone's guess\n\n'Nice can change the world,' said Sinead before she died. 'Look for the joys... the laughs. Life's when you're laughing.'\n\nIf you manage to wade through your tears from last week, you might feel, like Chesney, that life's too short, and he proposes to Gemma.\n\nWhy he chooses a cable car is anyone's guess: if she got stuck in a turnstile at Weatherfield County, why on Earth did he think being suspended in mid-air was a good idea?\n\nInanimate objects and Gemma are clearly not good news and Chesney has to pull the emergency brake when labour beckons (pictured) \u2013 in Llandudno.\n\nEvery cloud and all that \u2013 at least the babies (supposing they make it to safety) will be Welsh.\n\nScissorgate continues at the prison, with all and sundry having access to a pair last week, which resulted in Josh's stabbing.\n\nWhen he comes round, he frames David for attempted murder. It could be worse: he could've been subjected to one of David's haircuts.\n\nRomance looks on the cards for Maria when Bethany encourages her to go for it with Gary (yeah, right: because Bethany has a great history in picking men).\n\nWhen Tyrone invites them to a Halloween party, Maria is not at all freaked when Gary turns up in a gold bodysuit.\n\nOf course not: no fancy dress will ever be scarier than Gary in real life (and it matches his hair).\n\nWhen he suggests lunch, Maria readily agrees. Why wouldn't she? She hasn't eaten since Christmas.\n\nEMMERDALE: CASTING A SPELL\n\nHalloween will see Leanna\u2019s hormones racing when she zooms in for a kiss with Jacob\n\nHalloween is always creepy and even creepier when people don their costumes and decide this is the moment they really fancy each other.\n\nWhatever it is about Jacob\u2019s make-up, it\u2019s enough to set Leanna\u2019s hormones racing when she zooms in for a kiss.\n\nJacob doesn\u2019t take much persuading; let\u2019s just hope that ridiculous bun he\u2019s taken to wearing on his head stays in place long enough not to knock her out.\n\nElsewhere, Andrea tells Graham they need to talk (never a good idea in this village) and Kim mistakenly thinks she\u2019s Graham\u2019s mystery woman. Come on, give him some credit for taste.", "description": "EastEnders fans are in for a treat this Halloween as they watch Honey engage in a major snogfest with Walford's Adam Bateman (pictured).", "authors": ["Jaci Stephen For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/16/20040932-0-image-a-2_1571756951390.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
