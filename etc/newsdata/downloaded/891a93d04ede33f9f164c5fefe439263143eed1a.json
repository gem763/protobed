They\u2019re dead. As far as I\u2019m concerned, they\u2019re dead,\u201d Trump told reporters when asked about the talks as he left the White House for a trip to North Carolina.\n\nTrump had hoped to cap months of U.S. negotiations with the Taliban militants, who control large parts of Afghanistan, with a secret meeting at Camp David that would include Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and was aimed at securing an agreement to pull U.S. troops out of America\u2019s longest war of 18 years.\n\nDespite the Afghan government\u2019s wariness of negotiating with the Taliban, Trump had hoped having both parties at the presidential retreat could produce a deal.\n\nA draft accord agreed last week would have seen about 5,000 American troops withdrawn over coming months in exchange for guarantees that Afghanistan would not be used as a base for militant attacks on the United States or its allies.\n\nBringing U.S. troops home from Afghanistan has been one of Trump\u2019s main foreign policy objectives, and the Republican president said his administration was still thinking about a drawdown of the 14,000 U.S. soldiers in the country.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d like to get out but we\u2019ll get out at the right time,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, the end of the talks has fuelled fears of a further increase in violence across Afghanistan.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump speaks to reporters as he departs for travel to North Carolina from the White House in Washington, U.S., September 9, 2019.

U.S. Marine General Kenneth McKenzie, the head of U.S. Central Command, said on Monday the U.S. military is likely to accelerate here the pace of its operations in Afghanistan to counter the upsurge.\n\nMcKenzie said during a visit to Afghanistan that the Taliban \u201coverplayed their hand\u201d in peace negotiations by carrying out a spate of high profile attacks, including one that killed a U.S. soldier last week.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re certainly not going to sit still and let them carry out some self-described race to victory. That\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d McKenzie told a group of reporters travelling with him during a stop at Bagram Airfield in northeastern Afghanistan.\n\nGhani, who was sidelined from months of negotiations between U.S. officials and Taliban representatives, had been deeply suspicious of the talks.\n\nOn Monday, Ghani made a renewed call here for peace but insisted the Taliban must observe a ceasefire, which they have so far refused to do, as he sought to regain a hold on the peace process.\n\n\u201cPeace without a ceasefire is impossible,\u201d Ghani said.\n\nThe growing tension on the ground in Afghanistan adds to the uncertainty about the future course for American forces, many of whom must now simultaneously brace for an increase in fighting while also awaiting potential orders to withdraw.\n\nTrump has said he would like to reduce U.S. troops in the country to about 8,600.\n\nThe Taliban said on Sunday that more American lives would be lost as a result of Trump\u2019s decision to cancel talks.\n\nSlideshow (8 Images)\n\nAsked whether increasing operations against the Taliban could include air strikes and raids by U.S. and Afghan commandos, McKenzie responded: \u201cI think we\u2019re talking a total spectrum.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to make some decisions, I think, back in our nation\u2019s capital over the next few days and that will give us increased guidance going ahead,\u201d he added, without elaborating.", "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump proclaimed talks with Afghanistan's Taliban leaders dead on Monday, while the general in charge said the U.S. military is likely to ramp up operations in Afghanistan to counter an increase in Taliban attacks.", "authors": ["Steve Holland", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190909&t=2&i=1428101121&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF881WQ", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
