If you want to connect a Switch to a TV, you\u2019re basically stuck with Nintendo\u2019s dock or nothing.\n\nSwitch accessory company Genki \u2014 which is fresh off a successful Kickstarter last year for a Bluetooth headphone adapter for Nintendo\u2019s portable console \u2014 wants to change that with the Genki Covert Dock, a miniature GaN charger that also promises to work as a fully functional portable Switch dock. It sounds like the makings of the perfect Switch dock... if it works.\n\nGenki is by no means the first to try this. When the Switch first came out, there was a slew of USB-C hub and docks that claimed to offer the same thing, but most of them failed to work properly. Then there was the infamous Nyko Portable Docking Kit, one of the most high-profile alternative docks that customers claimed would break their console\u2019s ability to charge or even brick them entirely. In other words, Genki has a lot to prove here to show that it can succeed where everyone else (other than Nintendo and its comparatively large and clunky first-party dock) has failed.\n\nhistorically, third-party Switch docks have had problems\n\nGenki thinks it knows where other companies have gone wrong: as Andrew Geng, an engineer working for Genki, wrote in an extremely detailed Reddit post a few days ago, the issue with other docks has been a combination of poor USB-C and the peculiarities of the specific charging chip that the Switch uses, which can only handle 6V inputs before frying. It\u2019s still using the USB-C PD (Power Delivery) specification, but, essentially, if companies don\u2019t implement it exactly right for the Switch by regulating the power supply, issues can come up.\n\nGenki claims that the Covert Dock is set to use \u201conly standard Switch charging profiles when used with the console and conform to PD standards for other USB-C devices,\u201d with a dedicated chip that\u2019s designed to manage and prevent the dock from sending too much current or voltage through. The company also says that the dock\u2019s firmware can be updated after the fact, should Nintendo change its docking process in the future.\n\nAlso minimizing issues is the fact that the Covert Dock isn\u2019t really a \u201cdock\u201d; it\u2019s a wall brick, so users are free to use whatever USB-C to USB-C cable they like. Geng\u2019s post also highlights dock manufacturers trying to emulate Nintendo\u2019s non-standard USB-C design that allows the Switch to slide easily out of the dock as an issue, so this should help avoid those problems by allowing customers to use cables they know won\u2019t fry their Switch.\n\nWhether all that is enough to convince a skittish Switch owner to drop $49 on a historically problematic product category will likely depend on the user in question, but it\u2019s good to see that Genki is aware of the problems and has thought a lot about solving them.\n\nGenki\u2019s also promising that it\u2019ll work as a laptop dock, too\n\nWith all that out of the way, we can finally talk about the actual product, which looks pretty impressive for a portable Switch dock. Genki has built the entire dock into a fairly small (thanks to GaN technology) USB-C wall brick, with an extra HDMI port and USB-A port added on.\n\nThe dock can push up to 30W of power, which is enough to charge a smaller laptop, and Genki says that it\u2019ll also work as a full USB-C dock for laptops or phones. The USB-A port serves several purposes: it can work as a second wall charger for non-USB-C devices, but it also does data transfer, allowing you to connect accessories to a Switch (like a GameCube dock or Ethernet adapter) or laptop (like a flash drive or... Ethernet adapter).\n\nThe Genki dock is currently looking for funding on Kickstarter. Genki has successfully run a campaign for its Bluetooth Switch adapter (which the company now sells on Amazon), so it does have some experience there. Early bird pricing is $49 for a Covert Dock, with shipping estimated for December 2019 (although due to its crowdfunded nature, I\u2019d treat the release date with some healthy skepticism).", "description": "Switch accessory company Genki thinks it\u2019s cracked portable Switch docks with the Genki Covert Dock, a miniature GaN charger that also promises to work as a fully functional portable Switch dock.
