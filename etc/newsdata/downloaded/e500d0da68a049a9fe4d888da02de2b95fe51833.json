Ukrainian filmmaker Oleg Sentsov, jailed in Russia, was also present.\n\nAmong those handed to Moscow was Volodymyr Tsemakh, suspected of involvement in downing a Malaysia Airlines flight over rebel-held east Ukraine in 2014 that killed all 298 aboard.\n\nThe airliner was on a flight from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, and the Dutch government issued a statement saying it \"seriously regrets that under pressure from the Russian Federation, Mr Tsemakh was included in this prisoner swap\".\n\nThe statement said Dutch prosecutors did, however, get a chance to question Tsemakh before his release. Ukraine's security service has identified him as a former commander of Russian-backed forces in eastern Ukraine.\n\nHugging and shaking hands with the freed Ukrainians, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy told reporters the swap was part of his deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nNow all steps must be taken \"to finish this horrible war,\" he added, referring to the east where Russian-backed separatists control a swathe of Ukrainian territory in a conflict that has killed more than 13,000 people in five years.\n\nZelenskiy has pledged to end the regular, low-level clashes that persist despite a ceasefire signed in 2015.", "description": "While the exchange of Russian and Ukrainian prisoners could help rebuild confidence between Moscow and Kiev and allow them to start talking seriously over other issues including a conflict in east Ukraine, full normalization is a long way off.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106117493-1567876368471rts2pjz7.jpg?v=1567876464", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
