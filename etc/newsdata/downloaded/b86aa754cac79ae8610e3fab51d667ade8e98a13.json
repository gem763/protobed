We should always work to respect whistleblowers' requests for confidentiality,\" Grassley said. \"No one should be making judgments or pronouncements without hearing from the whistleblower first and carefully following up on the facts.\"\n\nSome Republicans have criticized the whistleblower for relying in part on information from White House aides. Grassley says such second-hand information \"should not be rejected out of hand.\"\n\nTrump angered critics, as well as the whistleblower's lawyer, by suggesting on Monday the White House is \"trying to find out\" the person' identity.", "description": "U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Tuesday declared that House Democrats are trying to \"intimidate, bully and treat improperly\" five current and former career officials in demanding depositions related to the Ukraine matter.", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5304182.1569944147!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/usa-trump-whistleblower.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
