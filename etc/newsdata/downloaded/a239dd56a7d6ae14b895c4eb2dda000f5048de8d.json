Shane Vendrell on The Shield was a standout in a murderer\u2019s row of these kinds of characters on that show. But hell, Walton Goggins is so good at playing the type that Quentin Tarantino, of all people, decided he was going to be the go-to actor for him when casting such parts, which Goggins played exquisitely in Django Unchained and The Hateful Eight.\n\nEven in comedies, which allow for the Alabama-born, Georgia-raised performer to arch his eyebrows and weaponize his twang for laughs, he typically plays the kind of person we\u2019re meant to love to hate. For his work in Vice Principals on HBO, on which he plays perhaps the most conniving school administrator put on screen, the New York Times wrote, \u201cWalton Goggins makes a habit of being the best thing about the television shows he\u2019s in.\u201d\n\nIt makes for a great story that, in reality, Walton Goggins is, by all accounts, a great man. A very good guy. One of the best good guys, if I\u2019m being honest, a conclusion arrived at after spending hours poring through stories about him, and a good bit of time talking with him as well. Like, talking though. About real things. Life. Death. Happiness. Sadness. Actually, what it means to be a good guy.\n\nNEWSLETTERS The Daily Beast\u2019s Obsessed Everything we can\u2019t stop loving, hating, and thinking about this week in pop culture.

We meet Wade a year after his wife\u2019s death. He has so fastidiously dedicated himself to raising his two daughters and ensuring that they\u2019ve handled the trauma well, he\u2019s failed to realize that he\u2019s become a sad case in his own right.\n\nHis best friends intervene, insisting that he rejoin the dating pool. After all, he is \u201cthe unicorn\u201d: a good-looking man in his forties on the dating apps who isn\u2019t looking to just have sex or an affair. He\u2019s there for the right reasons. In other words, he\u2019s a good guy.\n\nWhen the trailer for The Unicorn played at the CBS Upfronts this summer, during which networks pitch their new slate to advertisers, Goggins did something patently unusual for what may rank among the most clinical and cynical of all showbiz endeavors. He cried.\n\nAs we talk about it, nestled on a couch in the lobby of a Beverly Hills hotel, that wide, toothy smile, so often used to exceptional, menacing effect, spreads an incredibly inviting warmth.\n\n\u201cWe have all experienced tragedy in our lives,\u201d he says. \u201cI said there that it is the great equalizer in life.\u201d After a career that he describes as \u201cthe great fortune of humanizing villains,\u201d he was so grateful to participate in something as heartfelt and unapologetically earnest as The Unicorn. \u201cI have in my own life experienced tragedy,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd it was my community that helped carry me to a new place in life.\u201d\n\nThe Unicorn is an all-around personal endeavor. Creators Bill Martin and Mike Schiff based the show on their friend, Grady. His wife had died, the worst thing any family can go through, and Grady just put his head down in the weeds to take care of his daughters and make sure they were OK. Then something happened: They were. They were OK. The clouds parted, and here he was. After all that tragedy, suddenly his life got funny. Grady re-entered the dating pool. Martin and Schiff created a TV show.\n\nThat is essentially the plot of The Unicorn. Goggins\u2019 Wade stands in for Grady. Michaela Watkins, Rob Corddry, Ruby Jay, and Omar Benson Miller play his friends, pushing him into the dating pool. He goes on a date. He\u2019s not emotionally ready for it. It\u2019s horrible. It\u2019s hilarious. The show? It\u2019s hilarious, too. And very heartwarming.\n\n\u201cThe thing that scared me the most, to be quite honest with you, is that this is closer to who I am than anything I\u2019ve ever played,\u201d Goggins says. \u201cReally, it kind of is me. I don\u2019t have anything to hide behind.\u201d\n\nGoggins has a great life now. He lives in the Hollywood Hills with his wife, writer-director Nadia Conners, and their 8-year-old son, Augustus. His career is going great. He\u2019s in CBS\u2019s best new series! He likes it so much he cried in front of hundreds of businessmen!\n\nBack in 2004, his wife, Leanne, died, under circumstances which Goggins doesn\u2019t discuss, though Wikipedia links to a since-erased obituary for her written in the local publication Canyon News, and there is other gossip that can be easily googled.\n\n\u201cI drifted for upwards of three years after that,\u201d he tells me. \u201cIt took me a really long time to come back from it. If it weren\u2019t for the people in my life that cared about me, that stepped in and helped me understand that life goes on, I don\u2019t know what would have happened.\u201d\n\nAt its core, The Unicorn is a family sitcom, one that\u2019s reminiscent in tone to Modern Family. It just happens that the family dynamics are depicted through a close-knit group of friends, each with traditional family units of their own, but who care so deeply about each other that they think nothing of being intertwined in their respective lives.\n\nThere\u2019s a small scene in the show\u2019s pilot that may seem inconsequential, but is actually quite touching. Wade\u2019s daughter needs to be picked up from school, and without considering whether it\u2019s strange, his four friends start discussing whose schedule is freest to run the errand. It\u2019s taken as a matter of fact, that they\u2019re all raising everyone\u2019s kids together.\n\n\u201cNone of us are islands,\u201d Goggins says. \u201cWhy would you want to go through this experience alone? We all need help.\u201d\n\nI ask about his experience dating again after his wife died. On paper, the successful, handsome actor would be \u201cthe unicorn\u201d that his show talks about. Was that the case?\n\n\u201c The thing that scared me the most, to be quite honest with you, is that this is closer to who I am than anything I\u2019ve ever played. \u201d\n\nI wasn\u2019t aware that it was possible to say the word \u201cno\u201d so many times in just a few seconds. \u201cI would be the kind of guy you would catch and release,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve never been as great as Wade Felton. You know, it\u2019s just so scary. I think it\u2019s scary for many of us.\u201d\n\nGoggins\u2019 Hollywood story is the kind of thing magazine editors drool over.\n\nHis parents divorced when he was 3, and he was largely raised by his mother, who made about $12,000 a year in the workers\u2019 comp department for the state of Georgia. His first attraction to performing came through his aunt, an actress whom he spent time with as a young boy in her dinner theater dressing room.\n\nWhen he was 14 he asked his mother to drive him to the office of an Atlanta-based casting director named Chez Griffin. He demanded to see her, despite not having an appointment. She was intrigued, and agreed to work with him. He started doing some shooting around Atlanta. In 1990, he was cast in the TV movie Murder in the Mississippi.\n\nHe moved to Los Angeles by himself when he was 19. Within a week, he booked a role opposite Billy Crystal in Mr. Saturday Night. His scene, \u201cNervous Kid\u201d in a flashback sequence, was cut. At night, he worked a valet parking business and sold\u2014get this\u2014cowboy boots.\n\nA few years later, he was up for his big break, playing the villain opposite Hilary Swank in The Next Karate Kid. After a final audition, he lost the part. He called up producer Jerry Weintraub after to ask if, as a consolation, he could audition to play the character\u2019s best friend. He was offered the role on the spot, and has been working ever since.\n\n\u201c I have in my own life experienced tragedy. And it was my community that helped carry me to a new place in life. \u201d\n\nThere were a series of bigger breaks. His role in Robert Duvall\u2019s The Apostle in 1997 graduated him to a new level of recognition. In 2001, a short he produced won the Oscar for Best Live Action Short Film. A year later he was cast on FX\u2019s The Shield as Detective Shane Vendrell, kicking off a remarkable track record of roles on prestige cable series, including Justified, Sons of Anarchy, Eastbound and Down, Six, and the recent HBO comedy The Righteous Gemstones.\n\nIn addition to his work with Tarantino, he\u2019s appeared in Lincoln, Cowboy & Aliens, and Ant-Man and the Wasp.\n\nIt\u2019s a wide range of Southerners that he\u2019s given life to, too. It\u2019s easy to see why. In person, he has a drawl and a tanned ruggedness. He may have well been born in a cowboy hat. Representing that, even while playing a series of bad guys, has always felt like a responsibility to him.\n\n\u201cAnybody worth their weight in salt wants to accurately reflect their culture and not sell their culture out,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was important to me not to portray Boyd Crowder as a one-dimensional redneck. I wanted to make him the smartest person in the room. Some of the smartest people I know come from where I come from.\u201d\n\nWhen you\u2019re in the speeding car of a Hollywood career, trying to capitalize on any opportunity you\u2019re given, it\u2019s rare to have the opportunity, or even make the decision, to pull over and reflect on the ride, the journey, the beginning of the trip. But, actually, Goggins recently sold his mother\u2019s home in Georgia, so he\u2019s been doing a lot of reflecting on all that.\n\n\u201cAll I ever wanted from any of this was to see the world,\u201d he says. \u201cI want to hear other people\u2019s stories. This business has given me that. I look back over the course of my life and I think, how did I get here? And then age has taught me not to question how I\u2019ve gotten there, but what are you going to do now that you\u2019re here.\u201d", "description": "The actor is stunningly convincing as a widower who needs friends\u2019 help getting his life back in CBS\u2019 \u201cThe Unicorn.\u201d It\u2019s exactly what he went through in his own life.", "authors": ["Kevin Fallon", "Senior Entertainment Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569461901/190925-walton-goggins-tease_cbljiu", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
