Going for the tie, Prescott dropped back and was quickly met by a blitzing Jamal Adams and his pass on the conversion try fell short of Jason Witten in the end zone.\n\n3rd straight loss for Dallas\n\nThe Cowboys (3-3) tried an onside kick, but Demaryius Thomas recovered for the Jets (1-4), who won for the first time under coach Adam Gase. It was the third straight loss for Dallas.\n\n\"To come out here and do it in the fashion we did and the defence getting a huge stop on the 2-point conversion,\" Darnold said, \"I wouldn't want it any other way.\"\n\nDarnold, who missed three games while recovering from mononucleosis, finished 23 of 32 for 338 yards \u2014 including a 92-yard touchdown toss to Robby Anderson and a 5-yarder to Ryan Griffin. Darnold was intercepted by Jourdan Lewis late in the third quarter after throwing 179 consecutive passes without being picked off, dating to Week 14 of last season at Buffalo.\n\nLe'Veon Bell also ran for a score, his first on the ground with the Jets.\n\nInjuries slow Cowboys\n\nThe Cowboys played without starting tackles La'el Collins and Tyron Smith, and star wide receiver Amari Cooper was sidelined most of the game with a quadriceps injury. But Dallas made it a five-point game on Ezekiel Elliott's 5-yard run with 6:30 remaining, capping an 11-play, 84-yard drive.\n\nSam Ficken's 38-yard field goal with 3:24 left made it 24-16, but the Cowboys had one more long drive in them.\n\nAnd, the Jets' defence had one final stop in them.\n\n\"No one counted us to win that game,\" linebacker Jordan Jenkins said. \"Everyone bet on the Cowboys. They thought we were going to come in and get blown out.\"\n\nPrescott was 28 of 40 for 277 yards. Elliott finished with 105 yards and a touchdown on 28 carries.\n\n\"We're putting ourselves behind,\" Prescott said. \"We're putting our defence in a tough spot. We're not playing complementary football. It's simple as that. We've got to start faster. We've got to get points. We've got to get touchdowns and allow our defence to play from up.\n\n\"As long we have these slow starts, we're going to struggle.\"", "description": "Sam Darnold gave the Jets' struggling offence a huge boost by throwing two touchdown passes in his return from mononucleosis, and New York held on to beat the Dallas Cowboys 24-22 on Sunday night for their first win of the season.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5320223.1571013524!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/darnold-sam-101319.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
