Throughout all this uncertainty, political infighting continues as Johnson refuses to share details of his plan. His opponents are skeptical he even has one and demand sufficient time to review such a plan before submission to the EU.\n\nThe OECD has warned that a no-deal Brexit will reduce UK economic growth by 3%, leading the country into recession amid a global slowdown.\n\nWhere does that leave traders trying to make sense of such convoluted market fundamentals? The charts can offer some insight via a view of the overall supply and demand.\n\nGBP Daily Chart\n\nThe pound hit a brick wall at the 100 DMA for the fifth day, after jumping more than 5% since the hammer low on Sept. 3 when the opposition forced Johnson back to a deal with the EU.\n\nThe resistance at this level fits into the puzzle as it agrees with December lows \u2014 the head of a failed H&S bottom, which is presumed to have flipped a bullish setup to an agreement among traders to continue lower.\n\nMoreover, supply has halted demand as the price neared its downtrend line since April 2018.\n\nFinally, the pound is unable to climb back above 1.2500. The roundness of that figure renders it a psychological barrier because people tend to think in whole numbers and are presumed to have placed sell orders at that level.\n\nAll this demonstrates the higher probability of another leg down, unless the long-term downtrend line at 1.2700 is breached.\n\nTrading Strategies \u2013 Short Position Setup\n\nConservative traders would wait for either a full upward correction toward the downtrend line with evidence of supply or for a new low below the Sept. 3 trough of 1.1959.\n\nModerate traders may enter a position after a close below 1.2400 \u2014 where the price has found support since stalling at 1.2500 Friday \u2014 followed by evidence of resistance upon an attempted rally to cross back over the 1.2400 level.\n\nAggressive traders may trade at will, providing they can write a trade plan that fits their account\u2019s acceptable risk.\n\nTrade Sample\n\nEntry: 1.2475\n\nStop-Loss: 1.2575\n\nRisk: 100 pips\n\nTarget: 1.2175\n\nReward: 300 pips\n\nRisk:Reward Ratio: 1:3", "description": "Forex Analysis by Investing.com (Pinchas Cohen/Investing.com) covering: GBP/USD.
