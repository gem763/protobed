The Yankees and Astros will start things off at 4:08 ET.\n\nThis article will outline the best daily fantasy MLB plays of the day at every position. We\u2019ll take a comprehensive look across the DFS industry to uncover these core recommendations, factoring respective salaries into the analysis.\n\nPlease note, these player picks were organized early in the day. For MLB contests, always check lineups and weather closer to game time. Rain, wind, or unexpected managerial decisions could open up additional sources of value. Be sure to keep an eye on the MLB Headlines and Injuries desk.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nPITCHER\n\nGerrit Cole - Houston (at NY Yankees)\n\nIt\u2019s going to be difficult to shy away from Cole, even in tournaments. He\u2019s the only pitcher who can confidently rack up a quality start, let alone a rewarding fantasy line of seven (or more) innings and 10+ strikeouts. As for the other options (Patrick Corbin, Luis Severino, Dakota Hudson), there\u2019s a good chance they\u2019ll get the hook before completing five innings. Cole has allowed one or less earned runs with 10 or more strikeouts in each of his past four starts. Facing the Yankees on the road will be a difficult environment, but Cole is more than capable of silencing the crowd.\n\nAlso Consider: Patrick Corbin\n\nCATCHER / FIRST BASE\n\nHowie Kendrick - Washington (vs. St. Louis)\n\nThe veteran infielder has come up huge for Washington this postseason. Kendrick has achieved multiple hits in three of his past four games, including a brilliant 3-4 showing with three doubles, three RBIs, and two runs yesterday. His DFS salary remains somewhat cheap despite that impressive play, and he\u2019s a solid lift through all formats.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlso Consider: Yuli Gurriel\n\nSECOND BASE\n\nKolten Wong - St. Louis (at Washington)\n\nThe second base position is rough tonight. Jose Altuve and Gleyber Torres are the most legitimate options, but both of them come with an expensive salary. For that reason, I\u2019m interested in punting this spot with Wong\u2019s non-imposing price tag. Sure, the lefty/lefty matchup isn\u2019t ideal, but Wong held a premium lineup spot the last time St. Louis faced a southpaw (Dallas Keuchel last series). Taking the savings with Wong should help roster Cole and the high-upside bats you really want (see below).\n\nAlso Consider: Jose Altuve\n\nTHIRD BASE\n\nAnthony Rendon - Washington (vs. St. Louis)\n\nAt third base, Rendon and Alex Bregman are the top choices with Tommy Edman entering the conversation as a value candidate. My vote goes to Rendon, who has been a beast in the playoffs while going 11-29 (.379) this October. He went 2-3 with a double and two runs last night, and I believe the Nats\u2019 third baseman will pick up where he left off tonight.\n\nAlso consider: Tommy Edman\n\nSHORTSTOP\n\nPaul DeJong - St. Louis (at Washington)\n\nTrea Turner and Carlos Correa are the top lifts (in that order) at shortstop, but we need to pick our spots when climbing the salary ladder. In other words, I\u2019d rather take Rendon, Bregman, or an expensive outfielder instead of the pricey shortstops ... That leaves us with DeJong as an interesting mid-range option with the platoon advantage over Washington LHP Corbin. The Cardinals\u2019 shortstop has come through with multiple hits in two of his past four outings, and this is a plausible situation for him to make some fantasy noise.\n\nAlso Consider: Carlos Correa\n\nOUTFIELD\n\nJuan Soto - Washington (vs. St. Louis)\n\nSoto has been a monster this postseason while repeatedly coming up with clutch hits for the Nationals. Needless to say, he carries a comfortable blend of contact and power, which is very similar to the rationale for his aforementioned teammate, Rendon. Cardinals\u2019 RHP Dakota Hudson has been sharp over the past few months, but he still carries a .351 wOBA split to left-handed bats. Because of that, Soto and Adam Eaton deserve consideration in this matchup.\n\nJose Martinez - St. Louis (at Washington)\n\nMartinez is a \u201ccheapskate special\u201d to help squeeze the aforementioned players in the same lineup. Similar to the rationale used with DeJong, Martinez is an economical choice who holds the platoon advantage over Nats\u2019 LHP Corbin. He went 2-4 yesterday, which could translate to confidence at the plate tonight \u2026 I\u2019ll be looking towards Martinez as a capable bargain filler, assuming he cracks the starting lineup.\n\nAlso consider: Yordan Alvarez, Victor Robles, Dexter Fowler, Adam Eaton", "description": "Spencer Limbach finds the best MLB DFS Plays for the two-game playoff slate on Tuesday, October 15.
