Labour\u2019s 5 per cent proposal would take the total to about \u00a3140 million.\n\nIt follows The Daily Telegraph's six-point \u201cSave Our Game\u201d campaign to address a crisis in grass-roots facilities, which included the formation of an independent commission to consider funding and decide over the Premier League\u2019s 5 per cent contribution.", "description": "The Labour Party has pledged to enforce a 5 per cent levy on the Premier League\u2019s television income to raise about \u00a340\u2009million extra each year for grass-roots football, should they form a Government", "authors": ["Jeremy Wilson", "Chief Sports Reporter", "Jim White", "Alan Tyers"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/07/TELEMMGLPICT000171266769_1-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
