Unplugging can be tough. To find focus, try our new #DigitalWellbeingExperiments\u2014a collection of ideas and tools to help you find a better balance with technology \u2192 https://t.co/sFGbsNKZnk pic.twitter.com/pYOeWpCsqn \u2014 Google (@Google) October 23, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nUnlock Clock\n\nUnlock Clock is a live wallpaper that displays how many times you've unlocked your phone. Every time you look at your home screen, that tally will be on display as a massive number taking up most of the background.\n\n\n\n\n\nPaper Phone\n\nPaper Phone is exactly what it sounds like -- a paper phone. A corresponding app lets users select what information to include on their paper phone which they can then print off and use in place of their actual phone.\n\n\n\n\n\nPost Box\n\nPost Box lets users schedule when they receive notifications. Once the time arrives, all missed notifications will appear at once.\n\n\n\n\n\nDesert Island\n\nDesert Island challenges users to only use essential apps. Users are prompted to select only the apps which they can't live without on a day-to-day basis and are pushed to use only those.\n\n\n\n\n\nMorph\n\nMorph allows users to categorize their applications as work-related, home-related, or a category of their own making. Based on what time it is and where a user may be, Morph will give users access to only the apps predetermined as necessary.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe Flip\n\nThis application lets users simultaneously turn off technology as a group. It's an opt-in tool and, once a participant unlocks their phone, We Flip deactivates.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll are available now, as are the tools for users to create their own digital well-being experiments.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rt5LY5TeTVQ", "description": "Google this week unveiled a new platform,\u00a0Digital Wellbeing Experiments, which gives users access to six new apps and tools that have been designed by the company to help them become aware of -- and therefore control\u00a0-- their smartphone usage.
