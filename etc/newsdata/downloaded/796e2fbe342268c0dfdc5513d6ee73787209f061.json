Pay Up.", "language": "en", "text": "But several studies released this year point out that SB 7066 and similar laws in other states suppress millions of votes\u2014enough to potentially swing the outcome of a national election.\n\n\u201cNearly six million individuals are denied the right to vote in the United States\u201d due to a past conviction and an inability to pay a rising number of fines, fees, court costs, and restitution, according to the Civil Rights Clinic at Georgetown University School of Law. The Campaign Legal Center calls the practice \u201ca modern poll tax as a precondition of voting\u201d that falls disproportionately on the poor and people of color.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Disenfranchisement 101,\u201d according to Carol Anderson, an Emory University historian and author of One Person, No Vote. She said these laws reflect an old political calculus, found mostly on the right: Stay in power by narrowing the electorate, and block African Americans and the poor from voting by any means necessary.\n\nDuring the Jim Crow era, \u201cthe poll tax was about poverty,\u201d she said. The modern-day laws tied to court cost are no different, she said: \u201cTo make it sound rational, they say, \u2018Well, they just have to pay their court fines and fees\u2014that\u2019s all.\u2019 But with the poll tax, they said, \u2018They have to pay because democracy is expensive. Elections are expensive.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut DeSantis rejects this comparison, arguing that the fees and fines are part of an offender\u2019s punishment. \u201cThe idea that paying restitution to someone is equivalent to a tax is totally wrong,\u201d he told The Tampa Bay Times in May. \u201cThe only reason you\u2019re paying restitution is because you were convicted of a felony.\u201d\n\nLaws connecting payments to voting rights dates back to the Reconstruction period after the Civil War. Whites in former slave states saw freed African Americans flex their new political muscle at the ballot box, sending scores of black representatives to state legislatures across the South, as well as to Congress. Alarmed at the threat, whites squelched the nascent political movement by enacting laws making voting contingent on proof of wealth, through poll taxes and property ownership.\n\nMany of those laws remain on the books today. Eight states, including Alabama, Arkansas, and Florida, have laws explicitly requiring ex-offenders to pay all fines and fees known as Legal Financial Obligations (LFOs). Twenty states, including Minnesota and California, require settlement of outstanding LFOs as a term of completing probation and parole. In Alabama, besides paying LFOs, ex-felons have to fill out paperwork: a certificate of eligibility to register to vote. In Tennessee, they have to prove they\u2019re current in child support payments.\n\nThose financial requirements \u201cfall particularly hard on poor people,\u201d of all races, said Aderson Francois, director of the Civil Rights Clinic. But restoring voting rights only after criminal penalties are paid, he adds, \u201charms minorities in particular\u201d because they are \u201coverly represented in the criminal justice system, and overly represented in terms of poor people.\u201d\n\nThese laws have led to an estimated 10 million people who \u201cowe more than $50 billion in fines and fees related to criminal convictions,\u201d according to the CRC\u2019s report. And some jurisdictions see them as a way to fill state or municipal budget holes. \u201cThese LFOs include a variety of fines and fees assessed to generate revenue for various judicial and law enforcement expenses,\u201d the report states, \u201cbut also debts for medical care incurred during incarceration and fees and legal costs imposed specifically on indigent defendants who are represented by public defenders.\u201d\n\nThe Campaign Legal Center report found ex-offenders \u201cowed an average of $8,195 in restitution alone,\u201d a figure that doesn\u2019t even calculate fines or fees, according to the report. \u201cThis returning population,\u201d the report states, \u201cis ill-equipped to pay these debts.\u201d Ex-offenders struggle to find steady work because of their records. When they do land jobs, more often than not they don\u2019t pay well enough to eliminate the debt.\n\nThis long-standing, racially motivated disenfranchisement \u201cfundamentally calls into question whether or not we have the right to call ourselves a true democracy,\u201d Francois said. Micha Kubic, executive director of the ACLU, noted that Amendment 4 \u201cwas the biggest expansion of the franchise since the 1970s. We\u2019re also talking about large numbers of white voters who will be stopped for registering as well. I think it is instead an attack on democracy itself, an attack on the voters\u2019 ability to make decisions for the state.\u201d\n\nBetty Riddle knows many people with felony convictions who, if SB 6077 is upheld by the courts, can\u2019t afford the fines \u201cso they\u2019re just not gonna a vote and they\u2019re just discouraged.\u201d But not her. \u201cIt was unjust,\u201d she said, \u201cand I\u2019m going to fight to the end.\u201d\n\n", "description": "In many states, ex-felons are required to settle debts before they can cast a ballot\u2014a modern twist on poll taxes, disenfranchising black Americans.", "authors": ["Joseph Williams"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/c73f2ef2dcd5d2da6caa78754229c663ac61797c.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
