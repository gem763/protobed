In his new book, What It Takes: Lessons in the Pursuit of Excellence, Schwarzman reveals some of the biggest lessons he\u2019s learned from his 50-year career in business.\n\nPart memoir, part leadership guide, Schwarzman addresses the highlights (and low lights) of his career including quitting his high-power job to start Blackstone, raising capital as a first-time fund manager, and dealing with the fallout from the unraveling of his presidential CEO business council. (I personally enjoyed the part when he talks about meeting \u201cBeyonc\u00e9 and her husband Jay-Z.\u201d He writes: \u201cWe talked for a few minutes, reminiscing about her Kennedy Center performance in 2005.\u201d)\n\nSchwarzman was 38 years old when he founded Blackstone in 1985, and he\u2019s been at the helm ever since. Today, the firm boasts $545 billion in assets under management and 2,500 employees. Blackstone recently converted from a publicly traded partnership to a corporation, which makes it easier to own Blackstone stock and allows the firm to be included in more indexes.\n\nI sat down with Schwarzman for a wide-ranging conversation about Blackstone\u2019s dealings in China, the ethical challenges surrounding artificial intelligence, the rise of cryptocurrencies, and whether he sees a looming recession on the horizon.\n\nBelow is an excerpt from our conversation. (Read the full Q&A here.)\n\nWhat are you investing in, and where do you see growth opportunities?\n\nGrowth is certainly going to technology, services, and experiences. You have things like shopping centers. When I grew up, it was like: What could go wrong with a shopping center? And now that thing is called Amazon. Just that technological innovation has changed people\u2019s shopping patterns, changed the delivery mechanism, and it\u2019s led to shopping centers going bankrupt. It\u2019s disrupted a whole chain of things people took for granted. It took 10 years for an entire stable structure to be dismantled.\n\nWe saw that in 2011 when we started buying warehouses. We\u2019ve been the largest buyer of warehouses in the world for the last eight years, and we did that because that\u2019s where Amazon and retailers needed to stage their goods before they get delivered. So that area has exploded with growth. If you\u2019re investing now, you have to recognize that almost everything\u2019s about to have its business model changed.\n\nWhat\u2019s another example of a sector you think will experience Amazon-like growth?\n\nArtificial intelligence. AI will affect the whole healthcare industry, from billing, to admissions, to diagnostics, to the development of drugs, to telemedicine, which will have enormous growth. You look at all of this, and there are a lot of different things that go into what you or I believe is just a hospital. AI is going to have a profound impact on our society.\n\nThere will also be serious ethical implications that come with that innovation.\n\nThat\u2019s why I did this big donation at MIT and Oxford. [Note: Schwarzman donated $350 million to MIT for computing and AI research and $188 million to Oxford University for AI ethics research.] One involves technological innovation, and the other is about making sense of it in society. What are good outcomes and what are not-so-good outcomes? Who makes that determination, and how do you control for not having bad outcomes? That\u2019s a challenge that we have to face.\n\nAre you confident we\u2019ll be able to solve the ethical challenges quickly enough given the pace at which technology is evolving?\n\nLike most things in technology, it\u2019s moving faster than your ability to control and implement things. On the other hand, everybody who\u2019s running a company or is part of the discovery of AI watched the Internet get developed. I haven\u2019t met a mature person yet who was involved in the development of the internet that hasn\u2019t regretted they developed it.\n\nThey said, \u201cWe just thought this would be really cool. Everyone in the world can connect, and it\u2019ll be a positive sum game.\u201d They weren\u2019t aware that [the internet] would destroy the ability to govern. Everything is so short-term, there\u2019s so much divisiveness, and social media is very destructive. They\u2019ve looked at what they\u2019ve created, and they\u2019ve all said, \u201cIf I could have it back, I\u2019d take it back.\u201d I was shocked. So with AI, we have to get right on it so that the technology itself doesn\u2019t overwhelm society.\n\nThere\u2019s enormous interest and good will to doing something important in terms of AI ethics. No matter what country you\u2019re in, if you make a huge cut in your workforce, you\u2019ll have social unrest of some type. We already have that in the West. You could even have that in China, although they\u2019re investing so much in the area, they\u2019re actually creating a whole bunch of new jobs too.\n\nSpeaking of innovation, a 2007 Fortune article called you \u201cthe master of the alternative universe\u201d because Blackstone made its name by investing in alternative assets. What do you think about frontier assets like Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies?\n\nI don\u2019t have much interest in that because it\u2019s hard for me to understand. I was raised in a world where someone needs to control currencies. There\u2019s a reason to want to control currencies, which is why governments all do it. There\u2019s no one who says, \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d Part of that is to make sure the economy is as insulated as it can be from excesses. Another part of it is to control bad behavior. So the idea that you can transact without anybody knowing anything, you could have a lot of criminal behavior \u2014 dirty money, drug money \u2014 running all over the world. It only encourages that kind of activity.\n\nI may be a limited thinker, but that\u2019s a problem. If they could solve that problem and also the problem of controlling the money supply, then it might be OK. That doesn\u2019t mean that the blockchain technology applied to non-tradable currencies is not a good thing. That is clearly a good thing.\n\nAnd why do you say that?\n\nThere\u2019s all kinds of uses you can have from certain executions. [Blockchain technology] is a very good idea, and it will end up being adopted because it\u2019s good technology. Applying it to the creation of money is sort of, for my taste, pretty odd.\n\nSo in the future, you do see Blackstone investing in companies that are using blockchain technology?\n\nThat would be good because it\u2019s a sound, very interesting technology.\n\nBut you\u2019re not going to own any Bitcoin?\n\nThat\u2019s an easy one: No.\n\nRead much more here.\n\nWE WILL WAIT: WeWork\u2019s much-anticipated IPO is now TBD.
