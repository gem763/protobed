(Photo: Trae Patton, NBC)\n\nSpoiler alert: This story contains substantial details from Monday's episode of \"The Voice.\"\n\nMake up your mind, John Legend.\n\n\"The Voice\" coach ran the gamut on Monday's hybrid episode of the NBC singing competition, wooing a 16-year-old singer to complete his team during the final hour of the Blind Auditions before pitting her against another Team Legend member in the first hour of the Battles.\n\nZoe Upkins of Nashville earned swiveled chairs from coaches Legend, Kelly Clarkson and Blake Shelton during her performance of Monica's \"Angel of Mine\" (originally recorded by British girl group Eternal).\n\n\"You could make the finale,\" Clarkson said, offering her coaching skills.\n\nCoaching spat: 'The Voice': Blake Shelton, Gwen Stefani are fighting again over this four-chair turn\n\nShelton, the lone remaining original coach, played the \"Voice\" of wisdom card: \"I think it would be smart for you to choose a coach that's been here from Day 1.\"\n\nClarkson couldn't resist: \"Does that make you tired?\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm tired of the sounds that are coming into this ear hole,\" Shelton responded, continuing their season-long banter.\n\nLegend then broke up the fight \u2013 and won over Upkins \u2013 as he sang a paraphrased version of the Brandy-Monica duet \"The Boy is Mine\": \"You need to give it up/I've had about enough/She belongs to me/Zoe is mine.\"\n\nBut in Monday's breathless edition, which veered from Blind Auditions to Battles, Upkins wasn't necessarily going to be Legend's for long. He pitted her against another Team Legend member, Khalea Lynee, a 36-year-old mother of two, in the first battle.\n\nIs Legend's 'mojo' back? 'The Voice': John Legend thinks he lost his 'mojo' after shocking Blake Shelton defeat\n\nFor the Battles, Legend is teamed with celebrity adviser Usher, with Darius Rucker (Shelton), Normani (Clarkson) and will.i.am (Gwen Stefani) filling the advisory spots on the other teams as the contest enters its head-to-head stage.\n\nInspired by Upkins' Monica performance, Legend chose \"The Boy Is Mine\" for the battle between the two women. After both performed strongly, he picked Lynee because she is \"the most versatile.\"\n\nThat led to a frenzied competition for free agent Upkins. Both Clarkson and Stefani moved to steal, with Legend exercising his one Save in the Battles.\n\n\"I messed up. I shouldn't have paired them together,\" he said. \"Please do not leave me for these lovely ladies.\"\n\nClarkson tried to persuade the teen by pointing to her \"Voice\" victories with \"two minor girls. It's my thing,\" she said, adding, \"in a noncreepy way.\"\n\nLegend expressed regret, not over choosing Lynee, but in assigning the Battle duet.\n\nStefani used Legend's confession against him: \"John already admitted that he messed up. So, you don't want a coach who messes up.\"\n\nApparently, Upkins is OK with a coach who messes up \u2013 at least once \u2013 as she picked Legend.\n\n\"I'm so glad that Zoe is still on my team,\" the relieved coach said. \"Team Legend welcomes her back with wide-open arms.\"\n\nClarkson expressed her admiration for Upkins: \"She's going to be a threat.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2019/10/14/the-voice-coach-john-legend-rejects-saves-young-singer-battles/3981667002/", "description": "Spoiler: 'The Voice' coach John Legend went through the wringer on a hybrid episode Monday, winning and then almost losing a talented teen singer.", "authors": ["Bill Keveney", "Published P.M.
