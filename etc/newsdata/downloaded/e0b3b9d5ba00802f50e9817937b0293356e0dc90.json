aged between six months and 12.\n\nHuckle has refused to hand over the passwords for encrypted areas of his hard drive.\n\nCommitted Huckle targeted vulnerable and poverty-stricken children while working in South East Asia as an English teacher.\n\nHe had first visited Malaysia when he was just 19 and on a gap year and when police managed to crack into part of his hard drive, they found more than 20,000 abuse images on his laptop.\n\n(Image: Universal News)\n\nAt his trial, Huckle insisted he had \"no regrets\" about moving to Malaysia and in a chilling letter to his solicitors blamed \"external factors\" for his horrifying abuse.\n\nHuckle hit out at the \"poor attitude to child welfare\" and \"the pathetic, perverted lust of those who lured me onto the dark net\".\n\nAt his trial, his barrister told the court Huckle had little sexual experience with adults because he \u201clacked confidence with women\u201d.\n\nIt took more than an hour to read out each one of the sick 71 charges, which included rape, sexual assualt and sexual activity with a child.\n\nHuckle forced some victims to pose with sick slogans advertising his foul images, which he sold for Bitcoins on the TLZ website on the dark web - the encrypted version of the internet.\n\nHe even tried to make his paedophilia a full-time job by crowdfunding the release of his sick images.\n\nHuckle targeted his victims by using his respected position as a teacher to gain access to the most vulnerable children in society.\n\nMany of them were orphans and living in care and he even took one five-year-old out to celebrate her fifth birthday before molesting her at his home.\n\nHe also abused children while pretending to be taking them on a day trip from the children's homes they were living in.\n\nIn one part of his sick plan, Huckle planned to marry one of his young victims and set up his own foster home.\n\n(Image: CENTRAL NEWS)\n\nHe wanted to create a \"cycle of children\" that would live in his home and then move on so he could turn his sick abuse into a full-time role.\n\nSick Huckle also created a paedophile manual, Paedophiles And Poverty: Child Lover Guide.\n\nHe was finally arrested in December 2014 when he flew home to the UK to spend Christmas with his family.\n\nHuckle was brought into custody as part of a huge international operation into a website on the dark web but because he had no criminal record, the twisted abuser was initially released on bail.\n\nHis parents grilled him about the charges and at first Huckle insisted he was innocent.\n\n(Image: CENTRAL NEWS)\n\nWhen he finally confessed his guilt, his parents refused to let him into the family home and he was placed back in custody.\n\nHe pleaded guilty to 71 of the 91 charges and on June 6, 2016, was handed 22 life sentences.\n\nSentencing Huckle, Judge Peter Rook QC, told him: \"Your offending behaviour became entrenched in your everyday life.\n\n\"Your life revolved around your sexual activities with young children. Your distorted beliefs in respect of children are deep-seated. Your self-delusion knows no bounds.\"\n\nJames Traynor, from the NCA\u2019s child exploitation and online protection command, added: \u201cRichard Huckle spent several years integrating himself into the community in which he lived, making himself a trusted figure.\n\n\"But he abused that trust in the worst possible way.\n\n\u201cHe deliberately travelled to a part of the world where he thought he could abuse vulnerable children without being caught.\u201d", "description": "The former teacher, who is believed to have abused 200 children, has been found stabbed to death in his cell at HMP Full Sutton", "authors": ["Jane Lavender", "Chris Kitching", "Image", "Central News", "Pa", "Universal News"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article8095541.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/PAY-Richard-Huckle.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
