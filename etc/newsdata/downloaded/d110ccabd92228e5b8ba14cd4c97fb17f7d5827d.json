Locksley was once an assistant under Friedgen.\n\n\u201cHe had a huge impact on my career as a mentor and as a coach,\u201d Locksley said. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you the impact that Ralph had on Maryland football and the community. He is a guy I have the utmost respect for, that I have looked up to. He has a passion for this place like I do.\u201d\n\nFriedgen, a New York native, played at Maryland from 1966-68 and then was an assistant coach with the Terrapins. He was the head coach from 2001-10 at Maryland and led the program to sustained success, starting with the ACC title in 2001, seven bowl games and a school-record five bowl wins.\n\nBut Friedgen was fired after the 2010 season. A few years ago, he claimed that he burned his Maryland diploma due to his dismissal as the coach. Friedgen, 72, was part of the coaching staff at Rutgers in New Jersey after he left College Park. He also coached at Georgia Tech before coming to Maryland.\n\n\u201cI could care less about Maryland, I\u2019ve burned my diploma,\u201d he told Baltimore radio station WNST-AM in 2011. \u201cI\u2019m flying a Georgia Tech flag now. They talk about Maryland pride. They didn\u2019t show me a whole lot of Maryland pride, either getting the job or getting fired.\u201d\n\nThe game has drawn a lot of interest from students, who have gobbled up their available allotment of tickets.\n\n\u201cI know I am excited as well as our fans and team,\u201d Locksley said. \u201cWe are excited to have Ralph back to College Park next week.\u201d\n\nAdding to the intrigue is former Maryland assistant James Franklin is now the head coach at Penn State. Franklin was once seen as the heir apparent to be Maryland\u2019s head coach, but that didn\u2019t work out. He became Vanderbilt\u2019s head coach before taking over the program at Penn State.\n\nThis season\u2019s Maryland team started 2-0 with big wins over Howard and Syracuse at home before stumbling in a 20-17 loss at Temple on Saturday.\n\n\u201cOne win won\u2019t define us and neither will one win,\u201d Locksley said. \u201cWe will continue to move forward.\u201d\n\nLocksley said the bye week comes at a good time after the loss at Temple.\n\n\u201cAs I said last week, our season was going to be a journey,\u201d Locksley said. \u201cWe are a little disappointed which to me it is a good thing. Our team and our players, they expect to win. I was glad to see that our players are disappointed.\n\n\u201cNo one expects setbacks but everyone has them,\u201d he added. \u201cOn offense, I thought we were off. I thought our timing was off. The bye week couldn\u2019t have come at a better time for us. We need to get back to fundamental things.\u201d\n\nDespite red zone problems at Temple, Locksley said running back Anthony McFarland is still the best option with runs near the goal line.\n\n\u201cHe will figure out a way to get into the end zone,\u201d Locksley said.\n\nLocksley also defended offensive coordinator Scottie Montgomery.\n\n\u201cI thought the play-calling was fine,\u201d Locksley said. \u201cI thought the execution of play calling needs to continue to be worked on.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
