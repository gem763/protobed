This suggests that the North has not stopped developing nuclear weapons while engaging in denuclearization negotiations with the U.S. over the past year.\n\nSmith said Washington and Pyongyang first of all need to agree how to define the terms. \"The definition of denuclearization is a big thing to be worked out\" as it is not only a \"technical\" matter but also a highly \"political\" issue, he added.\n\nThe definition could make all the difference to how North Korean leader Kim Jong-un will respond.\n\nAs for the South Korean government's ambition to act as a mediator, Smith said, \"The definitive key to unlock the problems does not lie in South Korea's hands. It lies much more in American hands\" and South Korea must stand in line with U.S.", "description": "N.Korea 'Could Have 30-40 Nukes Next Year'", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://image.chosun.com/facebook/newson.gif", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
