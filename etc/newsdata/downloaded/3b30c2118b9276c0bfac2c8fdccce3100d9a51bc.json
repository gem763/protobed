There is nothing,\u201d said one prominent Wall Street hedge fund manager and Democratic bundler who is raising money for a Warren rival. \u201cIt\u2019s the same thing Republicans went through with Trump. You look at her and think what she is going to do is going to be horrible for the country. But if you say anything about it you just make her stronger.\u201d\n\nI'm Elizabeth Warren and I approve this message. https://t.co/2Ewkbm0ZwA \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) September 10, 2019\n\nThis fund manager, like a half-dozen other executives interviewed for this story, declined to be identified by name for fear of being directly attacked by Warren. Some, however, are happy to ring the alarm, no matter how Warren might use their words.\n\n\u201cWhat is wrong with billionaires? You can become a billionaire by developing products and services that people will pay for,\u201d said Leon Cooperman, a billionaire former Goldman Sachs executive who is now CEO of investment firm Omega Advisors and who predicts a 25 percent market drop should Warren become president. \u201cI believe in a progressive income tax and the rich paying more. But this is the fucking American dream she is shitting on.\u201d\n\nEarlier in the campaign, executives suggested they found Warren at least a more palatable alternative to Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), an avowed democratic socialist. Warren, a former Republican, has said she\u2019s a capitalist \u201cto my bones.\u201d Even now, some billionaires are urging calm.\n\n\u201c\u2018Ninety-seven percent of the people I know in my world are really, really fearful of her,\u201d billionaire Michael Novogratz told Bloomberg over the weekend. \u201cIt\u2019s a little carried away.\u201d\n\nBut more broadly the mood has shifted as Warren now leads Biden in some national and early state polls. And she has intensified her rhetoric toward Wall Street and the tech industry in particular.\n\nAt last week\u2019s debate she stressed that she would no longer take any money at all from tech or Wall Street executives, after having success with tech donors earlier in the campaign.\n\n\u201cIf we are going to talk about Wall Street and having some serious regulation over Wall Street, we should ask if people are funding their campaigns by taking money from those executives,\u201d Warren said, an indirect dig at former Vice President Joe Biden and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, both of whom have held high-dollar Wall Street fundraisers.\n\n\u201cYou can't go behind closed doors and take the money of these executives and then turn around and expect that these are the people who are actually finally going to enforce the laws. We need campaign finance rules and practices.\u201d\n\nThe current strategy among centrist, corporate-friendly Democrats is mostly to hope and pray that Biden \u2014 or perhaps Buttigieg or even Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) \u2014 can still take her out and prevent a possible Warren presidency that could upend business models and reshape entire industries.\n\nMost are not ready to jump over to Trump, but some at least ponder the idea.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t assume all these people would go to Trump. Plenty of them think there is much more at stake than just narrow industry interests or tax rates,\u201d a second hedge fund executive said. \u201cThere are a bunch of financial people that at the end of the day, if she\u2019s the candidate, they will still support her. They won\u2019t raise money for her because they can\u2019t. But they will still support her because of what the alternative is.\u201d\n\nAmong other things scaring corporate America and rich people, Warren has pledged to institute wealth taxes and break up tech giants and Wall Street banks. She has taken sharpest aim at the private equity industry, introducing the \u201cStop Wall Street Looting Act of 2019\u201d that would essentially wipe out some of the industry\u2019s most lucrative practices.", "description": "", "authors": ["-", "Hedge Fund Executive"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/0a/47/6f78e26041b7979c452fb1fcdc59/191022-warren-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
