Multiple horses?\u201d\n\nHe looked at his calendar. He read over the details again. Not only were the chamber members some of the most powerful people in the county, they were some of the most powerful people in Alabama.\n\nAnd the residents of Lisman were some of the least, which was why the mayor tore a sheet off a pink message pad and began sketching out an idea. He knew the town could not afford to miss even one chance to be represented.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI thought about boots,\u201d he would say later.\n\nHe drew a vertical line, a longer sloping line, and another.\n\n\u201cThen I thought about glory.\u201d\n\nHe had all sorts of ideas for what Lisman could be. In his office was a sketch of an elaborate park he hoped to get built someday. There were plans to hire a police officer, and rebuild the abandoned school library, and so many others for promoting the welfare of the residents he always referred to as \u201cthe citizens.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThere was also a budget on his desk, showing that the town had no money for the park, or a single police officer, or much more than the part-time clerk who flipped the sign on the front door of town hall to \u201copen\u201d Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.\n\nAD\n\nThis was the reality of Lisman, a place where the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. had once led a rally for voting rights and, all these years later, the promises of democracy he\u2019d argued for had come down to a mayor getting together a float to remind the world that places such as Lisman existed.\n\nHe drew some more lines, and nine asterisk-like stars.\n\n\u201cPlywood,\u201d he wrote at the top of the piece of paper.\n\n\u201cBoots for Lisman,\u201d he wrote at the bottom and then looked at what he had drawn, envisioning the words on an enormous boot cut out of a sheet of plywood, and the boot on top of a hay-filled trailer, and the trailer rolling past crowds cheering around the courthouse square.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n***\n\nAt a moment when American politics has become a raw and racially polarized struggle for power, Lisman is one of the most powerless places of all. It is small. It is rural. It is mostly poor and mostly African American, and it exists in Alabama, where those characteristics remain the very things that still make people forgotten.\n\nElsewhere in the South, political momentum has been heading in a different direction. In Georgia, an African American woman had almost been elected governor. North Carolina is a swing state. In Texas and even Mississippi, politics has been shifting toward the interests of a more racially and ideologically diverse electorate.\n\nAD\n\nBut that is not the case in Alabama, where the state\u2019s Democratic Party \u2014 the traditional means to power for black voters \u2014 has become so dysfunctional that the only Democrat elected statewide, U.S. Sen. Doug Jones, recently said the party was being \u201cdestroyed from within.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAlabama is where an electorate that remains solidly white, conservative and evangelical delivered President Trump one of his most resounding victories, and gave the GOP near-total control of the state legislature, every statewide office and every congressional seat except one.\n\nIt is where a pending federal lawsuit is arguing that the state is violating the 1965 Voting Rights Act, and where one of the first official acts of the current governor was to sign legislation protecting the Confederate statues that are part of courthouse squares all over the state, including the one down the highway from Lisman, where in five days there was going to be a parade.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d the mayor was saying on the phone, talking to a town councilman about a trailer they might be able to borrow for the float. \u201cHe\u2019s got one. Yeah. In that brick house. Yeah, that\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAmong the parade sponsors were two banks, a credit union and a paper mill that was owned by one of the most influential companies in the nation. After he had sketched his idea for the float, the mayor asked some council members if they thought the town should participate, and they agreed that Lisman should show up, knowing that was the only way they had ever gotten anything.\n\nIn 1962, Lisman residents had put their names to a federal lawsuit challenging the white Choctaw County registrars who were rejecting 95 percent of black voters\u2019 applications.\n\nAD\n\nIn the summer of 1971, people from Lisman had joined the demonstrations at the courthouse square to demand access to county jobs that blacks had been denied.\n\nAnd in 1979, they decided to incorporate so that they could more effectively claim their share of tax dollars being spent in other communities in the county.\n\nThat was how Lisman had what little budget it had. It was how the roads had gone from dirt to pavement, and the sewers got built, and the sign had gone up on Highway 10: \u201cWelcome to Lisman.\u201d That was how the town had bought the old school and designated the former principal\u2019s office Lisman Town Hall.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cEverything here came at a cost and we don\u2019t want to lose anything,\u201d said Linda Turner Gaines, town councilwoman, explaining why Lisman needed to be in the parade.\n\nAD\n\nThe mayor was 54, younger than the civil-rights-era veterans who lived in town, but he had grown up hearing their stories. He knew that Mrs. Gaines, as he always called her, had joined the marches across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma. He knew which residents had faced down police batons, and about the Lisman woman killed during the 1971 demonstrations, when she was run over by a white man driving a pickup truck and given a \u201cmartyr\u2019s funeral\u201d led by the Rev. Ralph David Abernathy, who called the square \u201choly ground.\u201d\n\nThe mayor understood all of that, so he was on the phone, trying to find the trailer, looking at his drawing of the boot.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d he continued, taking a pen and tracing over the lines. \u201cAll right, and if we don\u2019t have it together by then \u2014 yeah. Well. Then we\u2019ll just have to see.\u201d\n\n***\n\nThe person on the other end of the call was a town councilman named Darris Johnson, who was at work in a different part of the county repairing a bridge in the afternoon heat. When he had a break, he made some calls about the trailer. He found the one the mayor had mentioned, but it was being used. He called someone else, and someone else, until he found a colleague who had one to lend, and when he got off work, he drove over to get it.\n\n\u201cYou do what you can,\u201d Darris said.\n\nHe passed town hall, where the mayor\u2019s truck was the only one in the driveway.\n\nHe turned onto a county road, and for long stretches, he was alone on the two-lane, and that\u2019s how it was most of the time around Lisman. It was still. It was quiet. Almost everything was the same.\n\nAD\n\nHe passed by the churches he\u2019d always known. Over here was Greater First Baptist, where King spoke. Over there was Pleasant Hill Baptist, where Abernathy spoke after King was killed. Down the road was Mount Moriah Baptist, where Darris sat in the same pew every Sunday, listening to the pastor say, \u201cLord, we gotta be patient.\u201d\n\nHe passed the same houses where black leaders had once hosted Freedom Riders, and the Ku Klux Klan had responded with a three-mile-long parade of pickup trucks, their headlights on high beam. The brick house on the corner. The wooden one with the sagging porch. The old Victorian where a window air conditioner was now dripping in the same summer heat. He knew the families inside, and they were mostly the same, too, people trying to maintain what they could in a town where there not only was no police officer, but no maintenance person, nobody except for them to take care of anything.\n\nVolunteers took turns filling in the potholes, but the potholes kept appearing. They cut the grass along one road, but it kept growing along the others. They voted in high percentages every election, but little changed in the grand scheme of Alabama, and so little changed in Lisman.\n\nEach day, the old brick stores rotted a bit more. Each week, weeds advanced across abandoned houses. Each month, the building where the mayor had his office fell deeper into ruin.\n\nAlong the highway, the only gas station near Lisman, Ezell\u2019s One Stop, limped along on the largesse of locals who bought $2 of regular with change, or a raisin creme pie, or a Busch tallboy, and Rose Edwards was usually working behind the counter.\n\n\u201cWhat you want, baby?\u201d she said to a man in a blue work uniform. \u201cYou doin\u2019 all right?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe here,\u201d he said, while the owner of the station, a white man named James Ezell, sat in his back office, where he\u2019d run the store for nearly 50 years.\n\nPeople called him Ezell, and he was the same Ezell they\u2019d known forever, who called himself \u201cthe least racist man in the county,\u201d openly wondered what the civil rights movement had really achieved and recently started running the Choctaw County Republican Party out of the back of the store. On his desk were names of people from all over the county wanting to join. On his cellphone were contacts of various state officials.\n\n\u201cThat right there is the commissioner of agriculture,\u201d he said, pointing to a number. \u201cHe called me this morning trying to get something going in this part of the state. Hemp.\u201d\n\nHe walked to the front of the store, where Rose said of those officials, \u201cI don\u2019t think they know we exist.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can get the governor to come anytime I want,\u201d he said. \u201cBut see, people know how you gonna vote. Why should they come if they know how you gonna vote?\u201d\n\n\u201cBut we Democrats have a voice, too,\u201d said Rose.\n\n\u201cBut the Republicans run the state now,\u201d he said, and Rose folded her arms, turned and looked out the window.\n\nMeanwhile, at town hall, the clerk began another shift the way she always did, wiping down the front counter and lighting a single candle, and the mayor was in his office, looking at a map of the county\u2019s new \u201cOpportunity Zones\u201d and realizing that Lisman was not included.\n\nHe rolled his chair to get a file, and a wheel broke, jolting him off balance.\n\n\u201cLord,\u201d he said.\n\nHe kept working, and in the late afternoon, Darris arrived at a farm where an old trailer was parked in a gravel lot, the flatbed scattered with pine needles and missing seven planks.\n\nHe kicked the tires, realizing they needed air. He lined up the hitch ball on his truck with the trailer latch. He had been sweating all day and now he wiped more sweat off his forehead. He muscled the trailer into place. He got into his truck and hauled the flatbed back to Lisman, pulling into the empty parking lot of the firehouse by town hall as the sun was going down.\n\nHe had planned to park it inside an empty bay, but when he got there, he realized he didn\u2019t have the keys to the bay door, so he called the person he knew would answer.\n\n\u201cHey Ellis,\u201d Darris said to Ellis Johnson, another town councilman. \u201cCan you come unlock the firehouse for me? I can\u2019t find my keys.\u201d\n\n\u201cBe right there,\u201d Ellis said, and soon, he was pulling up in his battered gray pickup.\n\nEllis unlocked the firehouse. Darris inched the trailer inside, only it was too long to fit. He inched it back out. Ellis locked the door.\n\nDarris decided he would just park the trailer at his own house, so he hauled it back through the potholed streets, inching around the corners and up a driveway to the yard outside the mobile home he had left before dawn. Now it was dark, and Lisman had a trailer.\n\n***\n\nThe reason Darris called Ellis Johnson was because everyone was always calling Ellis Johnson, and he was always answering, driving through town in the old gray truck, tools heaped in the back. One day he was fixing somebody\u2019s lawn mower. One day he was fixing somebody\u2019s car. One day he was up early fixing a neighbor\u2019s air conditioner, and by midmorning he was still working. He looked at his watch.\n\n\u201cOh my goodness,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m starting today off in arrears.\u201d\n\nIt was Wednesday now, the day before the parade. He was supposed to be at town hall to supervise kids in the summer lunch program that the town ran on donations. He loaded his tools back in the truck and headed over to town hall, a Bible and a package of crackers on his dashboard.\n\nHe was 63 and at a point in life where he knew what he cared about, and that was Lisman. His family had moved to town when he was 5, after a white man with a .45 pistol had driven his father off his land in a nearby town no longer on any maps, where he had been among several African Americans who had managed to acquire hundreds of acres.\n\n\u201cI remember my grandmother begging that man, \u2018Don\u2019t kill my son,\u2019 \u201d Ellis said of his earliest lesson about power in Alabama.\n\nAnother came when his father got a job delivering for a white man who ran a store. Ellis recalled that his dad grew a mustache \u201con a whim,\u201d and that the boss had taunted him about it, saying he should be careful trying to act \u201cgrown\u201d like Martin Luther King Jr.\n\n\u201cMy dad took that to heart,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cHe came home, and he shaved that off.\u201d\n\nThat taught him about the power of King, and as he began reading and listening to his speeches, one quote stayed with him, about the \u201cdeath of the spirit\u201d that happens when a man chooses material or physical security over standing for a great cause.\n\nHe tried standing for a great cause. He joined other Lisman residents in the marches for desegregation that were taking place at the courthouse square and remembered silently bracing himself to get beaten by police batons before leaders halted the demonstration.\n\nHe went to Selma and registered black voters and remembered the terrified looks on some faces as they decided to put their names on the forms.\n\nHe went to work as an orderly in a hospital, where he watched a child die of a gangrened wound, and remembered thinking, \u201cThat child died because he was poor.\u201d\n\nHe worked for a roofing company, where he became an outspoken union leader, which he believed was the reason he got fired three times.\n\nHis wife got sick, and he started collecting scrap metal to pay the bills.\n\nHe came to think his father was a wiser man than he had ever understood.\n\n\u201cDad lived,\u201d he said.\n\nHe gave up on great causes and heroes. He gave up on church, if not the Lord. He gave up on Alabama changing. He gave up on everything except Lisman, a place as familiar and known to him as it was lost to the world outside.\n\n\u201cThat leaves me here, doing what I can in my town, not expecting a lot,\u201d he said. \u201cThe least of these are my heroes.\u201d\n\nHe went into the old school cafeteria to get the lunches ready, and then sat at the table with a sign-in sheet, waiting for the kids.\n\n\u201cHey Mr. Johnson,\u201d said a boy coming in.\n\n\u201cGot a drink?\u201d another said.\n\n\u201cThey small drinks but that\u2019s what we have,\u201d Ellis said, and when lunch was over, he walked over to the mayor\u2019s office to turn in some paperwork.\n\n\u201cMayor Ward, how you doing?\u201d he said.\n\nThe mayor had been thinking about downsizing his float vision, maybe just asking some kids to ride on the trailer and wave. But he didn\u2019t tell Ellis any of that, he just told him about his idea for the boot.\n\n\u201cThat plyboard we have, I don\u2019t know how thick that plyboard is,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou need it?\u201d Ellis said.\n\n\u201cI was thinking of using that for the float,\u201d the mayor said.\n\nEllis finished faxing the paperwork.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll be over there if you need me.\u201d\n\nEllis went back to the cafeteria to clean up from lunch. After a while, the mayor left, and Ellis watched him inching down the breezeway to his truck using the walker he\u2019d needed since he was in a car accident. He locked up the cafeteria and went back into a storage room to see about the plywood the mayor had mentioned.\n\nThere was a piece leaning against the wall, about seven feet tall and five feet wide. It was heavy. There was no way the mayor was going to move it by himself, so Ellis carried it outside to the breezeway and leaned it against a wall.\n\n***\n\nLate in the afternoon, the mayor came back to town hall and saw it there. He dragged an old child-size school chair into the breezeway and set it in front of the plywood. He got a pencil. He sat there until the sun went down, sketching out a drawing of a boot.\n\nHe called someone about bringing over a jigsaw. He drove over to a hardware store in the county seat and bought some spray paint.\n\nThe next morning, the day of the parade, the mayor returned to town hall, sat down in front of the plywood and looked at his work from the night before. Not good enough, he thought.\n\n\u201cCould be taller,\u201d he said to himself.\n\nHe erased a line on one side of the boot and drew it a few inches taller. He started to erase another line, but he dropped the eraser, which bounced just under the chair. He leaned down to pick it up. The chair tilted, and he wobbled before steadying himself again.\n\n\u201cWhew,\u201d he said.\n\nTrucks passed. The sun got higher. Lineup for the parade was now four hours away. The mayor drew the other side of the boot taller and looked at it again. Still too small. He tried drawing it taller, but he could only reach so far sitting in the chair. He stood up and leaned on his walker, balancing himself with one hand and reaching up with the other, trying to sketch the line.\n\nIt was a cloudless day, and the sun was directly on him. He sat down. He wiped his face. He looked at his watch and shook his head.\n\n\u201cMaybe spray this red . . .\u201d he said to no one.\n\nHe looked at his watch again. His shirt was wet. He started erasing the lines again.\n\nHe dropped the eraser again.\n\n\u201cOh Lord,\u201d he said.\n\nHe looked at the plywood.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t do it like I like,\u201d he said.\n\nTrucks were passing. No one was coming.\n\nIt was after 2 p.m. when he decided to call Ellis.\n\n\u201cMr. Johnson!\u201d the mayor said, sweat rolling down his face as he tried to remain positive. \u201cListen, I\u2019m up here finishing this boot? I\u2019m making a couple of adjustments. I\u2019m pretty well finished. Yeah. I couldn\u2019t get what I needed. But. Oh, I see. Okay. Yeah. If we could?\u201d\n\nHe hung up and was tracing over the lines again when Ellis arrived.\n\n\u201cI like that,\u201d Ellis said, seeing what the mayor had done.\n\nEllis went inside the storage room, dragged out a couple of sawhorses, and laid the plywood flat on top to make things easier for the mayor. The mayor looked at his drawing again. He sketched the boot taller.\n\n\u201cOkay, I see,\u201d Ellis said, watching. \u201cI see what you\u2019re doing now.\u201d\n\nThe mayor kept drawing.\n\n\u201cYou can go up right here,\u201d Ellis said, pointing. \u201cYou can make everything bigger.\u201d\n\nThe mayor kept going.\n\n\u201cGo on,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cNow all the way up.\u201d\n\nThe mayor sketched a tab detail at the top of the boot.\n\n\u201cLooking good,\u201d Ellis said, and when the mayor was done drawing, Ellis went to his truck, pulled out a jigsaw and began cutting around the lines until the last piece of wood fell away.\n\n\u201cYou ready to spray?\u201d Ellis said, and the mayor explained how he envisioned the paint.\n\n\u201cWe gonna try the red here,\u201d the mayor said.\n\n\u201cAnd blue here? And white here?\u201d Ellis said.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d the mayor said, and Ellis started spraying the colors.\n\n\u201cThis is going to come out fine, Mayor,\u201d he said, and with less than an hour to go before the lineup, the boot was finished.\n\nEllis lifted it into the mayor\u2019s truck, and the mayor drove down Highway 10 to the street off the courthouse square, where people in trucks and riding horses were starting to line up.\n\nDarris was already there, waiting in his truck, the borrowed trailer hitched to it. The mayor reached into the back of his truck and pulled out a garbage bag full of American flags left over from so many July Fourths. Darris took them out and spiked them one after another into some hay bales he had bought with his own money, 18 flags in all. Then he lifted the boot out of the mayor\u2019s truck, carried it onto the trailer and leaned it upright.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d the mayor said. \u201cRight there, I think.\u201d\n\nThe mayor\u2019s wife arrived with a few kids from town, and they sat on the hay bales and one of them held a printed sign someone in town had made.\n\n\u201cTown of Lisman , Boots for Glory,\u201d it read.\n\nThe mayor got into the cab of the truck. He looked out of the window.\n\nAll around, people were lining up along the street, most of them white, most from other parts of the county. A group of five men, some in cowboy hats, rode by on horses. Others buzzed around on little four-wheelers. A man on a motorcycle was dressed as a clown, his face painted white with a huge red smile. Three men wearing wigs and sequined dresses danced with abandon on a flatbed as speakers blared \u201980s rock.\n\nThe head of the Choctaw County Chamber of Commerce zipped back and forth in a golf cart, checking his list to see who showed up. He checked off a town called Pennington, whose float was an SUV tied with balloons. He checked off Comfort Care Hospice, Graham Forestry, First US Bank and other businesses with trailers and trucks fitted with signs and fringe and bunting.\n\nHe looked up from his list, and near the end of the lineup he saw a trailer filled with hay, two long rows of American flags and a five-foot-tall, three-foot-wide plywood boot painted with red, white and blue stripes.\n\n\u201cLisman?\u201d he said.\n\n***\n\nThe next morning, the clerk flipped the town hall sign to \u201copen\u201d and lit the candle, and the mayor was back in his office, looking at a list he had made of all the things he needed to get done.\n\n\u201cDitches need cleaning,\u201d read one item. \u201cPoliceman. Housing. Investors.\u201d\n\nThe pink piece of paper with the sketch was still on his desk, and on top of it were two new messages, one from a person calling about redistricting, another about a pothole.\n\nHe needed to get the pothole filled. He needed to work on his State of the Town address. He needed to go over to the cafeteria, where Ellis was getting lunch ready for the kids in the feeding program, and the mayor was supposed to help hand out certificates of recognition.\n\nThere was so much to be done in a town of 500 people when those people only had each other to rely on. But for now, the mayor took a moment to think about all that had happened the day before, after the head of the chamber of commerce had called out \u201cLisman,\u201d and the third float from the end of the parade had started to move forward.\n\nHe had rolled down his window. He had seen children scrambling for the candy that people were throwing off their floats. He had seen adults lost in conversations, a group of men leaning on the back of a pickup truck, and people eating hot dogs and not paying much attention as the trailer with the red, white and blue boot rolled by, and when the parade made the turn toward the courthouse square, he had started to wave.\n\nHe had waved at a man with white hair who did not wave back but smiled. He had waved to a group of women, one of whom called out \u201cHey y\u2019all\u201d and two of whom stood there. He had waved at Ezell and kept on waving as the float rolled past the crowds gathered around the courthouse square, where there was a tall statue honoring Confederate soldiers and nothing marking the other battles that had taken place there, no reminder at all other than a plywood boot and a mayor who had kept on waving, which was the power that Lisman had.", "description": "In a small Alabama town, a quest to be recognized in one of America\u2019s most powerless places.", "authors": ["Stephanie Mccrummen", "National Enterprise Reporter Covering An Array Of Subjects"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/hnR2qY1qD-0MWffGD7fQ47pn7AM=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/YHQNRIHLR4I6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
