First and foremost: Social Security, which is already dancing on the knife\u2019s edge of insolvency.\n\n\u201cIf nothing is done, the [Social Security] Trust Fund is depleted in 2035,\u201d Edelman Financial Engines executive chairman Ric Edelman told Yahoo Finance\u2019s YFi PM. He appeared as part of Yahoo Finance\u2019s ongoing partnership with the Funding Our Future campaign, a group of organizations advocating for increased retirement security for Americans.\n\nEdelman said the depletion of the Social Security Trust Fund would likely trigger a catastrophic sequence of events.\n\n\u201cAt that point, under current law, all beneficiaries \u2014 everybody getting Social Security checks \u2014 will get a check that\u2019s 23% smaller. This could push millions of American retirees into bankruptcy,\u201d he warned.\n\nSocial Security and the major federal health care programs like Medicare will account for more than 90% of the projected growth in nominal mandatory spending through 2029, according to the CBO report.\n\nHowever, the latest estimates from the Social Security Board of Trustees show annual costs are projected to exceed the program\u2019s annual income beginning next year.\n\nLong-term consequences\n\nThe relentless pressure from President Donald Trump on the Federal Reserve to further lower interest rates is giving Edelman additional concerns about the country\u2019s financial future.\n\nWASHINGTON, DC - NOVEMBER 02: (L to R) U.S. President Donald Trump looks on as his nominee for the chairman of the Federal Reserve Jerome Powell takes to the podium during a press event in the Rose Garden at the White House, November 2, 2017 in Washington, DC.

The problem is that as the economy heats up as a result of all of that, inflation kicks in, forcing the Fed to then reverse itself and raise interest rates,\u201d Edelman told Yahoo Finance.\n\n\u201cWhen that happens, bond values get crushed and you begin to see the inverted yield curve and bad things happen in the long term,\u201d he added.\n\nFurther adding to that economic uncertainty are tariffs. The CBO says that the Trump administration\u2019s tariff regime \u2014 primarily targeting Chinese goods \u2014 will reduce real U.S. GDP by about 0.3% by 2020.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so far not going the way the president predicted, but that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s wrong,\u201d according to Edelman. \u201cIs the president crazy? Or crazy like a fox? Nobody really knows yet, and that\u2019s the issue.\u201d\n\nNick Robertson is a senior producer at Yahoo Finance.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, SmartNews,LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit.", "description": "The federal government's endless sea of red ink is making some people more nervous about the fate of Social Security.", "authors": ["Nick Robertson", "Senior Producer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/MBG0xOi_7s3b.aYYVsAiWA--~B/aD0yNzMzO3c9NDI1NjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-02/9ec19020-3b87-11e9-97cb-0050751caf31", "published_at": "2019-08-22"}
