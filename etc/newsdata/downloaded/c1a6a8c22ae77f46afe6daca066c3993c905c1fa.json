Whether you\u2019re single again due to death or divorce, dating later in life has unique challenges.\n\nA reader recently shared her feelings about her first date with a man she\u2019d been chatting to on WhatsApp for a while but hadn\u2019t met face-to-face. And many women who\u2019ve started dating again after years of being part of a couple can relate to her lament.\n\n\u201cAs I nervously tuck my hair behind my ear, I wonder how I got here. I used to be happily married \u2013 or so I thought \u2013 until I discovered my husband had met someone else,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cNow I\u2019m having to relearn dating \u2013 to meet men in a world that\u2019s so different to the one I lived in when I was young and pretty.\n\n\u201cA world where you meet someone on the internet, and no longer through mutual friends or at a reputable establishment. A world where you get to know each other through WhatsApp messages and hear the other person\u2019s voice for the first time only once you finally get around to meeting each other face-to-face over coffee\n\n\u201cAnd suddenly I\u2019m faced with someone I barely know because he doesn\u2019t resemble his profile pic. I fake a smile and take a breath. But in my heart I\u2019m crying because at my age I should\u2019ve been settled with my husband and my children but instead I feel alone and lost.\u201d\n\nThere are all sorts of things you probably didn\u2019t have to consider when you were younger \u2013 the baggage from previous long-term relationships, family concerns, children or health issues \u2013 but dating later in life can still be rewarding and provide the companionship, affection and support you\u2019re looking for.\n\nHere\u2019s advice on finding love at a later stage in life and tips on how to cope with the challenges this presents.\n\nHOW TO GO ABOUT MEETING SOMEONE\n\nExperts agree that getting back into the dating scene after many years \u201coff the market\u201d can be daunting.\n\nThe first step is just getting out of the house and venturing outside your comfort zone, says Durban psychologist Carol-Ann Dixon. \u201cGo to places where people your age might get together,\u201d she says.\n\nA good place to start would be getting involved in hobbies or group activities that interest you, Johannesburg life coach Siobhan Jonker says. \u201cDo something you love, whether it\u2019s a sport or a hobby,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you\u2019re having fun, you\u2019ll radiate the kind of energy that attracts people to you.\n\n\u201cMeeting someone through family and friends is also a great way to connect with others,\u201d Jonker says. The advantage here is it\u2019s a safe space to meet new people.\n\nBefore jumping into the jungle that can be online dating (see box on next page), ask friends and family if they know anyone they think you might like and could introduce you to. This might be a better option than online dating where you\u2019re essentially confronted with lots of strangers, which can be unsettling.\n\nKEEP AN OPEN MIND\n\nLet\u2019s be honest, when you\u2019re no longer a kid, you\u2019re more likely to know what you like, what you don\u2019t like and what you expect from a partner.\n\n\u201cSo you may be less open to simply meeting someone and just seeing what happens,\u201d says psychologist Dr Louise Olivier.\n\nThis can make dating difficult because you\u2019re too quick to decide someone isn\u2019t for you. Jonker says you need to give yourself time to get to know new people without expecting each new person to be exactly what you\u2019re looking for.\n\n\u201cApproach your date expecting to find out who they are as a person, rather than viewing them solely as a potential mate. That\u2019ll help prevent unrealistic expectations,\u201d she advises.\n\nTAKE YOUR TIME\n\nWhen you\u2019re older you might feel time is of the essence and not to be wasted, so there might be added pressure for the relationship to advance, Dixon says.\n\nBut try not to rush things. Keep in mind that both of you might be dealing with unresolved emotional issues after the death of a partner or a divorce.\n\n\u201cBeing older means knowing people often carry the baggage of their past experiences,\u201d Olivier adds. You need to make allowances for this.\n\nAlso, realise that while the idea of being measured in the light of past experiences isn\u2019t always encouraging, it goes both ways. Give the other person the same understanding you\u2019d expect, and realise that this understanding takes time.\n\n\u201cIt also means that you need to understand where your own emotional baggage is coming from,\u201d Johannesburg life coach Lindelwa Khoza says.\n\nDEALING WITH THE FEAR OF REJECTION\n\nBeing keen to date again doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t be anxious about the prospect of meeting new people, says Susan Eksteen, a relationship therapist from Krugersdorp in Gauteng. In fact, it can be quite the opposite when you\u2019re older because you know your body isn\u2019t what it used to be. This brings with it the fear of rejection, Eksteen says, particularly when it comes to intimacy.\n\nWhen Deborah Moggach, whose novel These Foolish Things was turned into the film The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, found herself dating again in her sixties, it brought her face-to-face with the realities of ageing\n\n\u201cIn a long marriage you and your partner age together . . . you hardly notice the wrinkles and the thickening waist,\u201d she writes in an article published in The Telegraph. \u201cIt\u2019s different for people in my position.\n\nWhen I meet a man he mirrors back to me my own mortality. It gives me a shock to realise I\u2019m that old.\n\nWHEN IT\u2019S DIFFICULT FOR YOUR CHILDREN\n\nIt\u2019s not uncommon for grown-up children to struggle with a parent dating later in life, fraught as the idea is with complex feelings about loyalty towards their other parent and concern for your wellbeing. But they do need to understand that the human need for intimacy and companionship doesn\u2019t change, no matter your age. Don\u2019t exclude your children from your private life or avoid the topic, Durban psychologist Carol-Ann Dixon says. \u201cTalk to them and explain that you\u2019re lonely and would like to meet someone. Adult children can complicate matters by wanting to give their stamp of approval for your new partner.\u201d Tell them you understand their perspective and fears, but don\u2019t be embarrassed by your desire to have a fulfilling relationship. Also bear in mind the reactions of your potential partner\u2019s family. Counselling for blended families is sometimes needed.\n\nAnd he\u2019s probably thinking just the same.\u201d She goes on to talk about all the physical stuff \u2013 \u201cholding your stomach in, embarrassment about wrinkles, bingo wings and so on\u201d \u2013 that can make you feel self-conscious and insecure.\n\nBut the amazing thing is that \u201clove does work its old magic\u201d, she says. She found someone new.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t mind wrinkles, but then he\u2019s got some himself. We\u2019re both veterans of the romantic merry-go-round and have the scars to prove it.\u201d It\u2019s important to be comfortable with yourself, says Khoza.\n\n\u201cThe more you like yourself, the better the chance that others will like \u2013 and even love \u2013 you too.\n\nDo\u2019s and Don\u2019ts\n\nDo\u2019s\n\nBe honest \u2013 with yourself and the other person \u2013 about your expectations.\n\nBe flexible without straying from your principles.\n\nMake your time together fun and exciting and not simply a session in which the other person is being interrogated about his or her life.\n\nTell your prospective new partner if you\u2019re an involved parent but talk about things other than your kids as well.\n\nGive yourself and the other person time to get to know each other without expecting a serious love affair at the drop of a hat\n\nDon\u2019ts\n\nCompare your date with your previous partner.\n\nFear rejection.\n\nGet discouraged too early in the process.\n\nGet clingy too quickly \u2013 it will scare prospective partners off.\n\nDiscuss your financial affairs with the other person early in the relationship \u2013 trust must be earned.\n\nThink you can change someone\u2019s habits \u2013 be willing to take them as they are.\n\nBecome intimate too quickly because then it\u2019s difficult to backtrack and allow the relationship to grow gradually.", "description": "Dating when you\u2019re older can be daunting,here are tips to make\nit less intimidating.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9522/e558ee8c46e349739550bd82208c247c.png", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
