It faces east, towards ancient Jericho. It is often crowded with Muslim worshippers after prayers at al-Aqsa mosque, Islam's third holiest shrine.\n\nMany Jewish worshippers take another route to Judaism's nearby Western Wall. They pass through the Dung Gate, the closest entrance to the holy place, and Jewish families on their way to celebrate a 13-year-old son's Bar Mitzvah can be spotted making their way to the wall.\n\nSecurity is always tight in a volatile area at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Israeli police patrol and closed circuit TV cameras monitor the passageways of the Old City.\n\nIsrael views all of Jerusalem, including the walled Old City that it captured in the 1967 Middle East war, as its \"eternal and indivisible\" capital.\n\nPalestinians want East Jerusalem, where the Old City is located, as the capital of a state they seek to establish in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.\n\n(Writing by Jeffrey Heller; editing by Emelia Sithole-Matarise)", "description": "Jews, Muslims and Christians pass daily through the gates of Jerusalem's Old City, on their way to and from prayers or simply to go about their everyday business in one of the most politically sensitive spots on earth.
