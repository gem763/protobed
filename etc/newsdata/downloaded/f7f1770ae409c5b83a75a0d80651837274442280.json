Whatever lies ahead, bring it on,\u201d Young said.\n\nThe Hokies went to a program-record three straight NCAA Tournaments under Williams, who resigned after last season to take a job at Texas A&M;, but Young inherits a program that looks more like the depleted one that Williams inherited than one still on the rise.\n\nThe departures of Blackshear, an effective inside scorer, and Clarke, the team\u2019s most athletic player, leave voids in points, rebounds and experience, but persuading Bede, who averaged 3.8 points and 2.3 assists, to stay was a big win for Young. The decision came after several meetings, Bede said.\n\n\u201cI just believed in what he told me,\u201d Bede said. \u201cI felt like he was saying the right things. I asked my mom, and she felt like he was saying the right things as well, and she believed in his message, too.\u201d\n\nNolley, meanwhile, is a highly touted Williams recruit who sat out last season.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a really good player,\u201d Young said, describing Nolley as \u201ca true small forward.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got a very high basketball IQ. I\u2019ve been impressed with that. He\u2019s as good as advertised,\u201d Young said.\n\nEXPECTATIONS\n\nWilliams had great success transforming the Hokies into an upper-tier ACC program that fell 75-73 to Duke in the Sweet 16 last year, but his departure came in an offseason when the Hokies were going to lose their core, transfers or not. Young and the program are now where Williams was when he arrived at Tech - having to build from the ground up over the next several years.\n\nJONATHAN KOBANGO\n\nThe 6-foot-4 guard played in 21 games and scored 31 points as a freshman, but he will miss at least the start of the season. He announced on Instagram that he had suffered a season-ending injury during the offseason. He would be one of just five players on the roster with playing experience.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any chance we could have him back before January, but if he\u2019s back in January, and he\u2019s healthy and we get the go ahead from our training staff, and I think Jonathan Kabongo could help us win basketball games, then he\u2019ll play,\u201d Young said.\n\nPJ HORNE\n\nThe 6-5, 230-pound forward will go from averaging 13 minutes and scoring 97 points all season to a major role for the Hokies. He has shown flashes of inside toughness and playing bigger than his body, and he made 58% of his shots over two years, but he never has had to do it on an extended basis.\n\nBOMBS AWAY\n\nThe Hokies averaged better than nine 3-pointers a game last season and shot 39.4% from beyond the arc but almost all of that long-distance marksmanship has moved on, giving Young a clean canvass with which to work installing his preferred style of play.\n\nTHE SCHEDULE\n\nThe Hokies open their 20-game Atlantic Coast Conference slate at Clemson on Nov. 5 and don\u2019t play another top-tier program until they face top-ranked Michigan State in the Maui Invitational on Nov. 25. They will also face No. 4 Duke twice, No. 9 North Carolina at Cassell Coliseum and No. 11 Virginia twice.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Mike Young's first victories as Virginia Tech's coach came before he coached his first game.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Hank Kurz Jr."], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/23/virginia_tech_preview_basketball_06030_c0-90-3000-1840_s1200x700.jpg?289b6b870560d80ce1376c05b21b71b309b7a29d", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
