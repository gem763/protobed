Jim\u00e9nez thinks their power show could continue for years.\n\n\u201cIt was really cool,\u201d Jim\u00e9nez said. \u201cI hear it was the first game Moncada and me hit home runs in the same game. That is the first of many to come and it feels really good.\u201d\n\nWhite Sox bench coach Joe McEwing spoke after the game in place of manager Rick Renteria, who left early from his first contest back after undergoing shoulder surgery last Friday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice that they\u2019re going to be in the lineup hopefully for the next 10 years,\u201d McEwing said.\n\nJimenez drove a 1-1 pitch from Jakob Junis to the opposite field and into the right-field visitors\u2019 bullpen in the first inning for his 25th home run and a 4-1 Chicago lead.\n\n\u201cThrew a sinker down and in that was a pretty good pitch and he just sliced it opposite way for a homer,\u201d Junis said.\n\nMoncada\u2019s 23rd homer, off Kevin McCarthy in the seventh, landed high in the batter\u2019s eye and was measured at 452 feet.\n\n\u201cHe put that one almost in the scoreboard,\u201d Jim\u00e9nez said.\n\nAdalberto Mondesi, Alex Gordon and Ryan O\u2019Hearn went deep for the Royals on a warm night when the ball carried well and every run was scored on a homer.\n\nIvan Nova (10-12) allowed three runs in 5 2/3 innings to snap his three-game losing streak. The right-hander yielded six hits, including the Royals\u2018 three solo shots, while walking none and striking out five.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the game,\u201d Nova said. \u201cYou hit me, my team is going to hit you.\u201d\n\nJunis (9-13) permitted five runs in five-plus innings in losing for the third time in four decisions.\n\nMondesi homered in the top of the first to put Kansas City ahead.\n\nThe White Sox loaded the bases with one out in the bottom of the inning when Moncada\u2019s hot comebacker glanced off the heel of Junis\u2019 glove for an infield single. Jim\u00e9nez followed with his slam.\n\nGordon and O\u2019Hearn went deep back-to-back to start the second. O\u2019Hearn\u2019s blast bounced high off the center-field batter\u2019s eye.\n\nEngel homered on the first pitch in the bottom half.\n\nSOUTH SIDE CROWN?\n\nWhite Sox shortstop Tim Anderson entered the game with an AL-leading .334 batting average, but went 0 for 4 to drop to .331. Other numbers are at play as the 26-year-old seeks to become the third batting champion in White Sox history, following Hall of Famers Frank Thomas (1997) and Luke Appling (1936 and 1943).\n\nAnderson has only 435 at-bats because he missed five weeks with a right ankle sprain. To qualify for the batting title, a hitter needs 502 at-bats. Chicago has 18 games remaining.\n\nManager Rick Renteria said he\u2019ll try to get Anderson the at-bats he needs, but not at the expense of his \u201cphysical well-being.\u201d\n\n\u201cObviously you know that something is at stake for him as well and you try to balance it as best you can,\u201d Renteria said.\n\nFIRST LOOK\n\nFirst baseman Andrew Vaughn, drafted No. 3 overall and signed by the White Sox out of Cal-Berkeley in June, made his first trip to Guaranteed Rate Field and met with players and coaches. Rated by Baseball America as the top hitter in the 2019 draft, Vaughn played for two Class A teams this season.\n\nRUFF NUMBERS\n\nIn addition to 15,196 human fans, 1,236 canines attended on Dog Night.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nRoyals: RHP Jake Newberry (shoulder) was reinstated from the 10-day IL. He last pitched on Aug. 19.\n\nWhite Sox: Renteria was back in the dugout - with his right arm in a sling - after undergoing right rotator cuff surgery on Friday and missing Chicago\u2019s weekend series against the Angels. Renteria attributed the injury mostly to \u201cwear and tear,\u201d but said one throw earlier this year worsened his shoulder to a point where he needed surgery.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nRoyals RHP Glenn Sparkman (3-11, 5.97 ERA) faces White Sox RHP Reynaldo L\u00f3pez (9-12, 5.17) on Wednesday night. L\u00f3pez threw an 11-strikeout one-hitter at Cleveland last Thursday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Two young sluggers who are considered pillars in the Chicago White Sox rebuilding plan came through with impressive drives on the same night.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Matt Carlson"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/10/royals_white_sox_baseball_91306_c0-138-3300-2062_s1770x1032.jpg?e1f564f8f6be3edbe5b27839a1e93c520c57831d", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
