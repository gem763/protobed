The well is believed to go down as far as 550ft in total.\n\nOfficials have sent down a camera that recorded Sujith breathing, and on Monday said the boy had passed out but was believed to be still alive. A continuous supply of oxygen is being pumped down into the well.\n\nHuge drilling equipment has been borrowed for the rescue from the Indian Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), which is digging a parallel hole around 10ft from the existing borehole.\n\nA first dig had to be abandoned after it hit a patch of dense rock. Rescuers hope to drill down 110ft and then send a rescue worker down the shaft to reach the boy.\n\nPrevious attempts to bring the Sujith out using a rope failed. Local media also reported that the boy\u2019s mother, Kalairani, was stitching a cloth bag for rescuers to use to bring Sujith out of the well.\n\nAnd a widely-shared video posted to social media shows Kalairani at the mouth of the borehole, calling out and telling him not to cry.\n\nOn Monday, prime minister Narendra Modi wrote on Twitter: \u201cMy prayers are with the young and brave Sujith Wilson ... Every effort is being made to ensure he is safe.\u201d\n\nThe efforts to rescue Sujith have gripped the country as it observes the long weekend for Diwali festivities, with many sharing messages of support and sympathy for the family on social media.\n\nCongress politician Sowmya Reddy said on social media: \u201cWhile most of us are celebrating #Deepavali a 2 year old baby, 100ft deep in almost 3 days with no food and water. #prayforsujith.\u201d\n\nThe Tamil actor Harish Kalyan wished his followers a happy Diwali before adding: \u201cHave a safe one. Lets take a min to pray for #Sujith.\u201d\n\nWhile veteran actor and politician Ramanathan Sarathkumar wrote that \u201cthe entire state is praying for rescue of #Sujith\u201d.\n\nRead more\n\nAir India announces new flight route from Stansted to Amritsar\n\nIndia at odds over Gandhi\u2019s legacy as nation marks 150th birthday\n\nMore than 100 dead as central India hit by \u2018unprecedented\u2019 flooding\n\nTwo children beaten to death in India \u2018for defecating in public\u2019\n\nPakistan says India \u2018escalating tensions\u2019 with Kashmir threat", "description": "A major rescue operation is underway in India after a two-year-old boy fell into a deep, narrow well in a village in Tamil Nadu state.Officials said the attempts to save toddler Sujith Wilson were entering the final stages early on Monday afternoon, nearly 65 hours after he went missing on Friday.", "authors": ["Adam Withnall"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/UmKoCmIhPS_SHgBMKmf9nQ--~B/aD0zNzY7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/eab02cabd0466dc93aac6773d6105960", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
