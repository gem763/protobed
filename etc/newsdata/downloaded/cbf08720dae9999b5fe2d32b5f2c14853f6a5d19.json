But its other two announcements were promises for the future: It has partnered with anti-sexual assault nonprofit RAINN to create a mandatory safety exercise for driver applicants, and it is planning to add a feature to detect unexpected delays on trips later this year.\n\nThe update comes at a time when the company tries to assure the public over its safety measures. Last week, 14 women sued it over the alleged mishandling of their sexual assault, sexual misconduct and rape complaints against drivers ordered through its app. Among other concerns, the women alleged that Lyft is negligent in its background checks and fails to protect passengers with added technology.\n\nThe company provided few details about its mandatory \"community safety education\" module that drivers will have to complete as part of applying to work for Lyft. The company said current drivers will also eventually be required to complete it in order to continue providing rides on the platform. (Competitor Uber has partnered with RAINN to create educational videos that are sent to riders or drivers after a complaint is reported.)\n\nOne expert called the Lyft mandatory education measure \"potentially important,\" but said evaluating the effectiveness of the training, and whether a high score actually translates into a well-behaved driver, for example, will be key.\n\nRead More", "description": "As it faces fresh concerns over sexual assaults by its drivers, Lyft issued an update on its safety features.", "authors": ["Sara Ashley O'Brien", "Cnn Business"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190910143433-lyft-lawsuit-safety-updates-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
