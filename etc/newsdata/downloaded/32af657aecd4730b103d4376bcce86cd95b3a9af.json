Refined quality\n\nIt was initially designed to fill the gap between the Range Rover Evoque and Range Rover Sport, but this new model stands on its own with refinement in every department. It is available with a selection of four and six-cylinder diesel and petrol engines locally but now possesses more muscle than ever before.\n\nGALLERY | 2019 Range Rover Velar SVAutobiography Dynamic Edition\n\nDeveloped by Land Rover Special Vehicles, its power comes from a 5.0-litre supercharged V8 petrol engine that produces a gargantuan 405kW and runs from 0-100km/h in just 4.5 seconds, with a top speed of 274km/h. All of this is mated to an eight-speed transmission.\n\nBesides the massive change under the bonnet, it has also seen a few design and ride quality enhancements.\n\nMechanically, everything from the brakes and suspension have seen improvements while on the outside, other features include a new front bumper, grille, lower side mouldings, and revised rear bumper that accommodates integrated quad exhaust tips.\n\n\n\n\n\nLuxury as standard\n\nRide quality is another trump card of the Velar with AWD, air suspension and an active rear locking differential working in unison to provide premium ride quality on any terrain surface. Engineers at Land Rover Special Vehicle Operations spent 63 900 hours fine-tuning the unique calibration to optimise the ride, handling and responsiveness.\n\nREAD | Land Rover unleashes its new SA -bound Range Rover Velar SVAutobiography Dynamic Edition\n\nIt is available in six colours, including the luxurious Satin Byron Blue \u2013 a unique metallic paint finish from Special Vehicle Operations, while all models come with a Narvik Black roof as standard. Intricacy is further enhanced with Range Rover lettering on the bonnet and tailgate sporting a knurled finish on the metal element of the two-piece letters.\n\nImage: Motorpress\n\nIt rides on lightweight 21-inch forged aluminium wheels but customers can choose to fit the even bigger 22-inch rims with a unique Silver Sparkle finish and diamond-turned edging or with a Dark Grey finish, as an optional extra.\n\nThe interior is as bespoke as the outward appearance with glamour and sophistication, the core attributes on show. A carefully curated combination of trim finishes includes twin-stitched, perforated and quilted Windsor leather as well as 20-way adjustable heated and cooled front seats with memory and massage functions that come as standard.\n\nImage: Motorpress\n\nFurther special touches include a unique sports steering wheel and a sophisticated knurled finish for the rotary gear selector and Touch Pro Duo infotainment circular control dials.\n\nIt is available to purchase for one year only, and warrants a price tag from R1.7-million.\n\n\n\nCompiled by Robin Classen", "description": "Range Rover's latest offering of their luxury Velar SUV has seen a new limited-edition SVAutobiography Dynamic added to the line-up.
