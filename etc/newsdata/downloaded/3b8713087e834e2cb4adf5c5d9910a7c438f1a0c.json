They are two fantastic goalkeepers.\n\nJose Mourinho had no qualms about starting Romero in the Europa League final back in 2017\n\n'They are friends and they support each other all the time. I never saw a bad face, I always saw them supporting each other.'\n\nSERGIO ROMERO'S CV 2006-07 Racing Club Games: 4 Clean Sheets: 0 2007-11 AZ Alkmaar Games: 112 Clean Sheets: 48 2011-15 Sampdoria Games: 74 Clean Sheets: 25 - 2013-14 Monaco (loan) Games: 9 Clean Sheets: 5 2015-present Manchester United Games: 46 Clean Sheets: 28 2009-18 Argentina Games: 96 Clean Sheets: 47\n\nHe also fits the stereotype of a passionate Argentine. In his early days at AZ Alkmaar, where he won the Dutch league, he broke his hand punching a dressing-room door in anger.\n\n'Not smart,' said his manager Louis van Gaal understatedly.\n\nWhen Celta Vigo fluffed a late chance to knock United out of the Europa League a couple of years ago, Romero said poetically: 'My soul returned to my body.'\n\nHis reputation as a big-time player was enhanced at his second World Cup finals in Brazil when he led Argentina to a semi-final shoot-out win against Holland and did well in the final against Germany, which his side lost 1-0 in extra-time.\n\nRomero joined United in 2015 from Sampdoria and in many ways he's had the most unenviable job in football since then, the stand-in goalie as de Gea's form excelled, at least until the 2018 World Cup.\n\nIt's noticeable that under Solskjaer his appearances have been fewer and further apart than for either Louis van Gaal or Mourinho, playing just twice this season including the League Cup tie against Rochdale when he became the hero of a penalty shoot-out.\n\nThis could be his chance to show he's still the Romero that has played behind Messi, Aguero and Zlatan Ibrahimovic for club and country.\n\nThe first thing you notice about Romero between the sticks is that he looks commanding, a more imposing physical presence than the lean and agile de Gea.\n\nHe has tons of experience and has played 96 times for Argentina, including a World Cup final\n\nHe seems to instil confidence in his back-line \u2013 important for United who currently sit in the bottom half of the Premier League \u2013 and of course he makes great saves, both reflex stops and bravery in one-against-ones.\n\nHad de Gea left last summer, some inside Old Trafford felt Romero capable of stepping up to be No 1. Counting against him in the long-term however are issues of fitness and dependability.\n\nHe missed the last World Cup with a knee injury \u2013 the Argentine FA reported a 'joints blockage in his right knee' and when there were issues over de Gea's form at the end of last season, Solskjaer couldn't pick Romero because he'd tweaked his knee again in training.\n\nLong-term, injury issues may prevent Romero from becoming a full-time No 1 for a club the size of United. But short-term, if de Gea has to miss a few weeks, it's hard to think of anyone better to fill the void.", "description": "JOE BERNSTEIN: There will be one man certain that an injury to David de Gea would not weaken Manchester United - the goalkeeper poised to replace him, Sergio Romero.", "authors": ["Joe Bernstein For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/12/19784498-0-image-a-27_1571224804558.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
