The 5-year-old was swept away.", "language": "en", "text": "MARSH HARBOUR, Bahamas \u2014 Adrian Farrington carried his 5-year-old son on his back as the father treaded raging floodwater on Abaco Island, where refuge was vanishing under a storm surge. Schools disappeared. Businesses floated away. And Farrington\u2019s home, like many others, was no longer a viable place to ride out Hurricane Dorian.\n\nFarrington, 38, along with his wife and their two children, moved from house to house in the northwestern Bahamas on Sunday, hoping for a reprieve. Blood flowed from the father\u2019s leg wound. Then he spotted a roof he could swim toward. He sat down Adrian Farrington Jr. for a moment. The child, nicknamed A.J., wailed for his father.\n\n\u201cI keep telling him, \u2018Don\u2019t cry. Close your month. Don\u2019t cry. Keep breathing. Don\u2019t cry. Close your mouth,\u2019 \u201d Farrington said.\n\nThen, the father said, came the unthinkable: a powerful gust of wind sent his son tumbling across the roof and into the murky water, where he watched him disappear amid floating debris.\n\nThe father plunged his hands into the water, reaching for anything that felt like a human child. Clothes. Skin. An outstretched hand. A tiny sneaker.\n\n\u201cI ain\u2019t find nothing. I come back up. I hold my breath and I gone back down again,\u201d he said. \u201cAll this time, people carried my wife to safety and they calling me, but I ain\u2019t want to go because I didn\u2019t want to leave my son.\u201d\n\nFarrington was later rescued by civilians, he said. He recalled the harrowing incident from a gurney at the Princess Margaret Hospital in Nassau on Monday, as he recovered from two leg fractures and a cut on his hand.\n\n[In the Bahamas after Hurricane Dorian, waiting for relief amid the bodies]\n\nElsewhere on the island, at least 30 people died in the most powerful hurricane to hit the Bahamas in decades, though officials expect that number to rise after search and rescue teams cover more ground.\n\nThe family has diminished optimism that A.J. would be found alive after so many days lost. \u201cGiven the circumstances, I\u2019m not that hopeful,\u201d his older brother Richard Johnson told CBS News.\n\nFarrington had a similarly bleak outlook. \u201cA 5-year-old in that type of search, they don\u2019t stand much a chance,\u201d he said.\n\nBut he was not the only parent to watch a child swept away in the storm. Lashan McIntosh and her family had tried to escape a similarly perilous house. Her 8-year old son, Lachino, fell into raging water.\n\n\u201cAnd when I looked over, I saw him floating\u201d she said. She tried to resuscitate him, but her efforts proved futile.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe I lost my son in the storm,\u201d the grieving mother said just steps away from the morgue.\n\nRead more:\n\nHurricane Dorian aid: How to donate to rescue, relief and recovery in the Bahamas\n\nDorian slams N.C.
