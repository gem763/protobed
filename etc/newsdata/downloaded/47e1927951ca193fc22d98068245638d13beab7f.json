Asked if he believed Parliament would approve the deal, he said: 'I hope it will, I'm convinced it will. It has to.\n\n'Anyway there will be no prolongation. We have concluded a deal and so there is not an argument for further delay - it has to be done now.'\n\nBut European Council president Donald Tusk said any request for a delay would be considered if it is made.\n\nThe German Chancellor (left, with Emmanuel Macron and Xavier Bettel) is said to have made the remarks at the European Council in Belgium last night\n\nWhile the summit significantly avoided pointing to any delay, it also fell short of categorically ruling one out if Mr Johnson loses his Commons vote\n\nWith no chance of an extension, anti-No Deal MPs would face huge pressure to give their support to Mr Johnson's agreement.\n\nThe final decision on whether an extension would be offered ultimately rests with the EU heads of state.\n\nDonald Tusk, the president of the European Council, said last night that 'if there is a request for an extension I will consult member states to see how to react'.\n\nBut Mr Juncker's comments suggest that the EU does view Saturday's vote as the last chance saloon for an orderly Brexit.\n\nShould Mr Johnson be defeated in the Commons he will then have to decide what to do next: Try to renegotiate an improved version of the deal or switch to calling for a No Deal Brexit.\n\nIf he does the latter, believing that the EU will not budge any further, then he will likely need to force an early election to deliver it.", "description": "In remarks likely to bolster Remainer opposition to the Prime Minister's withdrawal agreement the German Chancellor is said to have made the remarks at the European Council in Belgium.", "authors": ["David Wilcock", "Whitehall Correspondent For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/12/19880836-0-image-a-24_1571396530328.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
