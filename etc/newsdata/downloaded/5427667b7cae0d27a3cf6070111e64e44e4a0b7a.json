(Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post)\n\nFrom 32 stories up, evening traffic in Tysons looks like Matchbox cars being pushed around a plastic track on the grainy video. Suddenly, a person enters the frame, leaping from the top of the skyscraper like a cliff diver.\n\nOne.\n\nTwo.\n\nThree.\n\nFour.\n\nSeconds pass as the body arcs downward, hurtling faster and faster toward asphalt and oblivious commuters headed to late meetings, dinner or soccer practice. When disaster seems all but imminent, a parachute explodes open with a crack like a gunshot and the jumper swoops over the cars to safety.\n\nAgain and again, perhaps six times in all over the past year, people have climbed and leaped off some of the Washington area\u2019s tallest buildings, turning this land of anodyne office parks, corporate headquarters and soul-deadening gridlock into an unlikely venue for one of the world\u2019s riskiest sports: BASE jumping. Authorities say the danger is high \u2014 a tangled chute or errant landing could injure the jumpers or someone below.\n\nThe identities of the perpetrators are unknown, but in recent months one suspect has emerged who seems, at first glance, as improbable as the location of the jumps themselves: a 68-year-old grandfather.\n\nBASE jumping is not a crime in Virginia, but Fairfax County police had been investigating a home contractor from Sterling for possible misdemeanor trespassing in connection with the jumps in Tysons, according to a search warrant. Authorities say they developed evidence that Chuck Moeser appears linked to one of the jumps, but the one-year window allowed by the statute of limitations closed as they built their case.\n\nThat leaves a mystery. Is a man who quietly spends his days hammering together decks, laying patios and roofing homes in Northern Virginia also surreptitiously scaling its skyline at night?\n\nIf Moeser is involved, he\u2019s not saying. He did not respond to numerous requests for comment and posted a message on Facebook urging his family and friends not to speak to a reporter about him. \u201cWhy would anyone want to read a story about me . . . boring,\u201d he wrote.\n\nBut if he is, it would be a stomach-churning second act for an athlete who was once an elite local runner known as much for his fierce endurance late into life as for his brash, flamboyant style.\n\nMoeser cruised to age-class victories and top-10 finishes in races such as the Army Ten-Miler and the Marine Corps Marathon in the \u201980s, \u201990s and early 2000s, even edging out Olympic marathon champion Frank Shorter and four-time New York City Marathon winner Bill Rodgers in a 1995 race.\n\nHe was known for a signature look \u2014 running shirtless even in the dead of winter. He told media outlets it was a tactic to intimidate other runners who did not share his six-pack physique. It\u2019s a form he maintains even now.\n\nStories about Moeser abound on local running forums, where fact seems to bleed into fiction. Moeser used to pound nails into his arms before marathons to deaden the pain, one post reads. Another reports a \u201clegend\u201d that Moeser carried his son out of the Grand Canyon after his son injured his leg during a run.\n\n\u201cHe was legendary,\u201d said Ron Kulik, Moeser\u2019s competitor and running partner in the \u201990s. \u201cIt\u2019s like Wyatt Earp. Is the legend of Wyatt Earp true or not? The answer is yes. How much? You really have to dig.\u201d\n\n'born to b wild'\n\nThe calls began last summer.\n\nPeople phoned Fairfax County police to say they had seen someone jumping \u2014 or maybe paragliding \u2014 off buildings in the Tysons area. The action centered around the Lumen building, a luxury apartment complex that was then under construction.\n\nThe 417-foot-tall building sits near Leesburg Pike and Chain Bridge Road, a precarious spot for BASE jumping. Six lanes of Leesburg Pike traffic run below, while cloverleaf ramps feed a steady stream of traffic onto Chain Bridge Road.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Greensboro Metro station, with its trains and electrified tracks, and a car dealership are adjacent. A water tower, telephone polls and trees poke up from below. In short, it\u2019s one of Northern Virginia\u2019s busier crossroads.\n\nDuring one of the jumps in August 2018, the company building the Lumen reported that someone had scaled a fence around the project and clambered up a tower crane, before plunging off the top of the 32-story structure.\n\n\u201cIn this case, the seemingly dangerous activity of BASE jumping was accomplished by trespassing on private property \u2014 a class 1 misdemeanor punishable by up to 1 year in jail and up to $2,500 in fines,\u201d 2nd Lt. John Lieb of the Fairfax County police said in an email.\n\nThe jumps burst into public view in March, when Fox 5 aired dramatic videos made by the jumpers that the news station said were sent to them by a \u201cconcerned citizen.\u201d\n\nThe person told Fox 5 that the jumpers had initially posted photos and videos of the jumps on Facebook. None that aired show the jumpers\u2019 faces.\n\n\u201cThree, two, one \u2014 cupcake!\u201d a jumper yells in one video, before plunging into the dusk toward the Tysons lights below. A jumper sails between two high-rises, like the walls of a canyon, in another clip. A third video shows a jumper landing on a roadway, while in a fourth, a man\u2019s parachute brushes a car in a darkened parking lot as he lands.\n\n\u201cSorry, didn\u2019t mean to wake you up!\u201d the jumper yells to an apparently startled driver.\n\nThe low-slung D.C. area has not been a major hot spot for BASE jumping, which is more commonly associated with towering peaks and spans out west and in Europe.\n\nThe sport first gained attention in the 1970s. BASE is an acronym that stands for the four types of objects jumpers typically launch from: building, antenna, span and earth. Jumpers often attempt to complete jumps from each type of platform.\n\nThe sport has remained largely underground because of its danger and the fact that jumpers are often required to trespass, burgle or pick locks to access launch points. One study found BASE jumping is five to eight times as dangerous as skydiving. An online magazine maintains a list of fatalities in the sport. It numbers 377.\n\n\n\nA video aired by Fox 5 shows a BASE jumper\u2019s open parachute as the jumper glides to the ground from a building in Tysons. (Obtained by The Washington Post)\n\nAfter the Fox 5 report, Fairfax County police received photos and videos of the jumps, which prompted a probe. An investigator wrote in a search warrant for the contents of Moeser\u2019s Facebook page that one of the photos showed two men atop a building that he was later able to determine, based on landmarks in the shot, was the Lumen. Fairfax police said one other building was also the site of BASE jumps, but they declined to identify it.\n\nOne of the men in the photo matched Moeser\u2019s driver\u2019s license image, the investigator wrote in the search warrant. The man also wore a \u201cUSNA Parachute Team\u201d shirt, the same type of shirt the investigator discovered Moeser wearing in a separate photo on his Facebook page.\n\nThe investigator noted that a jump was reported on June 8, 2018, the same day Moeser posted on Facebook a grinning picture of himself wearing a large backpack atop what police said was the Lumen building.\n\nThe caption reads: \u201cborn to b wild.\u201d\n\n'He goes to the limit'\n\nFriends said Moeser turned to BASE jumping in his mid-50s, an age when many others have given up extreme sports.\n\nA 2017 article in Outside magazine featured Moeser and his daughter, who performed a tandem BASE jump from West Virginia\u2019s New River Gorge Bridge during a festival during which it is legal to jump for a handful of hours each year. Moeser\u2019s son also made the 876-foot leap.\n\nTyler Naiman, who has sky-dived and BASE-jumped with Moeser, said the latter sport\u2019s thin margin of error is in keeping with Moeser\u2019s personality. He recalled that he and Moeser would often wait until other skydivers had pulled their rip cords during a jump before pulling their own.\n\n\u201cEveryone would leave, and we would party down to the basement,\u201d Naiman said. \u201cWe would push it to the limit. His personality is he goes to the limit.\u201d\n\nWhen it came to the Tysons jumps, Naiman grew quiet. He said BASE jumpers maintain a code of silence to avoid legal trouble and, as they put it, to protect jump locations from getting \u201cburned.\u201d More than a dozen other BASE jumpers who are local or associated with Moeser declined to comment or did not respond to messages.\n\nMoeser told The Washington Post in 1987 that as a young man he was drafted into the Army, where military records show he received training as a Ranger, parachutist and military skier in the early 1970s.\n\nHe told The Post he was \u201cpretty wild\u201d in high school in Northern Virginia and often hit the Georgetown pub circuit.\n\n\u201cThat was probably the best thing that ever happened to me,\u201d Moeser told The Post of being drafted. \u201cI\u2019d have either been the president of a company or in jail by now. I had a lot of extra energy. That\u2019s probably the reason I run so much now.\u201d\n\nKulik, Moeser\u2019s former running partner, said he would regularly meet Moeser at his contracting jobs during lunch. Moeser, who had spent the morning hauling 70-pound bales of shingles up on a roof or doing other heavy labor, would rip off his work pants, don sneakers and then bang out a speedy 10 miles with Kulik. Then Moeser would head back to work, Kulik said.\n\n\u201cGuys who were Olympic qualifiers \u2014 none of these guys could do what he did during the day,\u201d Kulik said.\n\nMoeser retired from racing in 2005, but the Facebook feed of the sexagenarian continues to look like an REI commercial. In one post, he celebrates completing his 919th skydive. In another, he shouts \u201cThree, two, one, cupcake!\u201d \u2014 the same phrase heard in the Tysons videos \u2014 before plunging hundreds of feet off a bridge in a BASE jump. In a third, he frolics naked in a Shenandoah waterfall.\n\nLarry Deigh, another friend, said Moeser is close with his children and wife and has become a gregarious teacher within the Reston Bike Club, where he leads long weekend rides.\n\n\u201cHe is somebody who gets a lot of pleasure in coaching people and being a leader in terms of organizing hiking and biking trips,\u201d Deigh said.\n\n\n\nThe Lumen apartment building. (Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post)\n\nFairfax County police said the reports of Tysons jumps continued through last summer and into this year. During that period, Moeser made a number of posts about Tysons on Facebook.\n\nIn June 2018, he posted a photo of a parachute and wrote \u201cTime to open tysons again.\u201d In July 2018, Moeser posted about a \u201cMission Impossible\u201d movie that features high-altitude skydiving and then wrote, \u201cI\u2019m heading to tysons corner to my favorite 420\u2019 bldng for some afternoon delight.\u201d\n\nPolice said the investigation of the jumps is now inactive. The photos and videos they received of the jumps are stripped of meta\u00addata, so it is hard to pinpoint exactly when they were taken.\n\nThe last documented jump happened in May, police said. On a Wednesday in late July, a new photo appeared on Moeser\u2019s Facebook page of a person fluttering to the ground with a parachute. There is an office building in the background.\n\nIt is unclear where the photo was taken. The caption reads simply, \u201cJust another hump day.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nNo charges for personal drug possession; Seattle\u2019s bold gamble to bring \u2018peace\u2019 after the war on drugs\n\nOne accused teacher, 8,000 lewd images: A school\u2019s exploitation shows no place is safe from hidden cameras anymore\n\nHe was found insane in one killing.
