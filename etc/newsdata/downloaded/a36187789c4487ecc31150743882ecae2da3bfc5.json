Scariest of all may be those things we don\u2019t even know we have to worry about \u2014 such as President Trump preparing to surrender to the Taliban at Camp David on the 18th anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.\n\nFew could have dreamed that such an outrage to American pride was even possible before seeing Trump\u2019s Saturday tweet. \u201cUnbeknownst to almost everyone, the major Taliban leaders and, separately, the President of Afghanistan, were going to secretly meet with me at Camp David on Sunday. They were coming to the United States tonight,\u201d he wrote, but because of recent violence, \u201cI immediately canceled the meeting and called off peace negotiations.\u201d\n\nWhile it\u2019s a relief to learn that Trump isn\u2019t planning to insult the 9/11 victims on the anniversary of their deaths, it raises the question: What else could he be planning?\n\n\u201cUnbeknownst to almost everyone, I was going to award the presidential medal of freedom posthumously to Jeffrey Epstein on Sunday, but I immediately canceled the ceremony.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnbeknownst to almost everyone, I was going to name Kanye West as White House spokesman and Alex Jones as head of the National Weather Service on Sunday, but I immediately called off the announcement.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnbeknownst to almost everyone, I was going to attack Denmark and annex Greenland on Sunday, but I immediately canceled the invasion and called off the bombers.\u201d\n\nTrump seems to enjoy the theatrics of canceling things he had (supposedly) planned to do. He canceled a retaliatory attack on Iran after ordering one up. He canceled, then reinstated, a meeting with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. He stormed into a meeting with Democrats for the sole purpose of canceling it. He canceled his Denmark trip after the prime minister panned his Greenland scheme. He said he canceled the Air Force One contract with Boeing because of high costs (then wound up paying even more). He cancels meetings with reporters as punishment. He\u2019s constantly scheduling and canceling his talks with China. He has canceled dozens of proposed nominations.\n\nBut why did he cancel the Taliban sleepover party at Camp David? The stated reason \u2014 another Taliban attack in Afghanistan \u2014 doesn\u2019t make much sense, because Taliban violence in Afghanistan happens all the time. I suspect it\u2019s because he read a draft of the proposed peace agreement, and it went something like this:\n\nCAMP DAVID, Sept. 11, 2019: Taliban Peace Treaty (Great Deal!)\n\nSection A: Background\n\nThe Taliban sheltered and coddled the terrorists who killed 3,000 Americans on 9/11; has never renounced the attack or its role in it; continues to have an alliance with al-Qaeda; was the main enemy in an 18-year war that killed 2,400 Americans; has killed countless thousands of Afghan civilians, many children, women and the elderly; has targeted schools, hospitals and aid workers in attacks; has closed girls\u2019 schools, denied health care and employment to women and subjected thousands of women to beatings, killings, acid attacks, gang rapes, public lashings and stoning for suspected infidelity or failure to cover themselves from head to toe; has banned television, movies, nonreligious music, non-Islamic holidays; has assassinated government officials, threatened journalists with death and targeted voters and election rallies; has conscripted young boys as suicide bombers, bans polio vaccines and blocks food aid.\n\nSection B: United States Concessions\n\nIn recognition of the foregoing, the United States proposes immediately to pull 5,000 and eventually all 14,000 troops out of Afghanistan; to give the fledgling Afghan government, which the Taliban calls a \u201cstooge government,\u201d no say in the matter; and to provide no meaningful deterrent to continued Taliban atrocities and oppression.\n\nSection C: Taliban Concessions\n\nIn exchange for U.S. withdrawal under Section B, Taliban leaders agree to ask very nicely if the terrorists they work with might please consider refraining from attacking the United States, if it isn\u2019t too much trouble. The Taliban delegation also agrees as part of this treaty to stay at Trump\u2019s Turnberry resort in Scotland while refueling on the way home from Camp David.\n\nSection D: Enforcement Mechanism\n\nIn the event the Taliban does not fulfill its obligations under Section C, the United States reserves the right to issue a sternly worded (written) statement of protest. But it promises to pull all troops out anyway.\n\nBelatedly, Trump evidently realized that he was surrendering to America\u2019s enemies on U.S. soil, desecrating the memory of the most solemn day in modern U.S. history and insulting those who have fought and died in a worthy cause. Should we be relieved? Or terrified as we await the next cockamamie idea, \u201cunbeknownst\u201d to all, to tumble from his disorganized brain?\n\nRead more from Dana Milbank\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.", "description": "The president\u2019s secret talks with the Taliban thankfully fell through.", "authors": ["Dana Milbank", "Op-Ed Columnist Covering National Politics", "September At Pm", "Dana Milbank Is An Op-Ed Columnist.
