NPCIL said the two networks were isolated.\n\nIn addition, NPCIL confirmed statements made by Singh on Twitter; that they received notification from CERT India back on September 4, when the malware was first spotted, and that they investigated the matter at the time of the report.\n\nNot actually a big deal\n\nAccording to an analysis of the Dtrack malware from Russian antivirus maker Kaspersky, this trojan includes features for:\n\nkeylogging,\n\nretrieving browser history,\n\ngathering host IP addresses, information about available networks and active connections,\n\nlisting all running processes,\n\nlisting all files on all available disk volumes.\n\nAs evident from its features, Dtrack is usually used for reconnaissance purposes and as a dropper for other malware payloads.\n\nPrevious Dtrack samples have been usually spotted in politically-motivated cyber-espionage operations, and in attacks on banks -- with a custom version of Dtrack, named AMTDtrack also being discovered last month.\n\nHistorically, the Lazarus Group or any other North Korean hacker group, have never gone after targets in the industrial sector, such as power plants.\n\nMost of North Korea's offensive hacking efforts have been focused on attaining insight into diplomatic relations, tracking former North Korean citizens who fled the country, or hacking banks and cryptocurrency exchanges to gather funds for the Pyongyang regime to raise funds for its weapons and missile programs.\n\nThe KNPP incident looks more like an accidental infection, rather than a well-planned operation. This specifically seems to be the case, since Kaspersky reported last month that the Lazarus Group had been spotted spreading Dtrack and AMDtrack versions across India, targeting its financial sector.", "description": "Two days after rumors of a malware infection at the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant surfaced on Twitter, the plant's parent company confirms the security breach.", "authors": ["Catalin Cimpanu"], "top_image": "https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/30/425a11a8-980f-413b-b15b-73203091bbf6/thumbnail/770x578/2bcab7adbc5ecda695ad6c35b39aa075/the-kudankulam-nuclear-power-plant-kknpp.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
