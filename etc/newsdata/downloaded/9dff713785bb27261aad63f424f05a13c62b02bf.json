Now he has established a new company called National World, and the Telegraph opportunity seems to have come along at exactly the right time.\n\n\"Of course we are interested,\" he told the Financial Times, before adding that it is \"far too early to make an estimate on what the offer might be\".\n\nThe Times reported that other interested parties could be the Daily Mail and General Trust, publishers of the Daily Mail, another fiercely pro-Brexit paper, and Alexander Lebedev, owner of the London Evening Standard and The Independent. The Telegraph has yet to comment on the matter.", "description": "One of Britain's most politically significant national newspapers could soon have a new owner after veteran editor and publisher David Montgomery reportedly expressed interest in buying the Daily and Sunday Telegraph titles.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/30/5db8fe59a310cf3e97a38997.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
