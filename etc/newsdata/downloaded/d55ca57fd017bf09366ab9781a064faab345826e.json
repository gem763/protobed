Viewer warning: expect more rule-breaking when NBC\u2019s \u201cA Little Late With Lilly Singh\u201d debuts Monday.\n\nSingh is attempting the leap from YouTube sensation to broadcast headliner in a single bound, doesn\u2019t plan to dwell on the late-night staple of politics and is only the second woman of color to host a nightly show on a major network since former VH1 VJ Cynthia Garrett was in charge of NBC\u2019s \u201cLater\u201d for a year - two decades ago.\n\nIt\u2019s been more than three decades since Joan Rivers\u2018 equally brief tenure as the first woman to host a daily late-night show, on Fox.\n\nIs Singh ready to face the weight of expectations? Yes, says the Canadian-born daughter of Indian immigrants, who established herself online with \u201cSuperwoman\u201d as her nickname and was the only woman on Forbes\u2019 2017 list of highest-paid YouTube stars with estimated earnings of $10 million.\n\n\u201cInevitably, it\u2019s a lot of pressure. It\u2019s also a huge honor, and I\u2019m focusing on the latter part,\u201d said Singh, who will be 31 on Sept. 26. \u201cI\u2019m focusing on how exciting this business is and how much it could mean, rather than focusing on, \u2018Oh my God. What will people think, and what if this messes up?\u2019 So I\u2019m just having fun while I do it and I think that\u2019s going to get the best result, ultimately.\u201d\n\nSingh is a \u201cflat-out star\u201d and NBC has full confidence in her, said network executive George Cheeks, who shares the title of NBC Entertainment co-chairman with Paul Telegdy.\n\n\u201cLilly is bold, inherently positive and hilarious,\u201d Cheeks said. \u201cShe has such a different perspective than anyone else on television right now, and she embraces her whole self authentically and without apology. Paul and I have often said that if she had never been on YouTube and came in to audition with zero social media presence, we would have given her this show. Her talent transcends platforms and she has this undeniable charisma that immediately pulls you into her orbit.\u201d\n\nMindy Kaling, Kenan Thompson, Tracee Ellis Ross and Chelsea Handler are the debut week guests, with Rainn Wilson making an appearance, NBC said Friday.\n\n\u201cA Little Late,\u201d taking over at 1:30 a.m. EDT for \u201cLast Call With Carson Daly\u201d after its 17-year run, will have the familiar talk-show elements of a monologue, guests - Beyonc\u00e9, she wants you - and comedy bits, Singh said. Less familiar is the approach Singh describes, one that echoes the blend of pointed humor and personal candor that earned her 14 million-plus YouTube followers and contrasts with other (male) hosts. In a recent tweet, she casually noted she\u2019s bisexual.\n\nTV won\u2019t change what she does, Singh said, citing the show\u2019s opener as an example.\n\n\u201cMy monologue is quite personal to me. It\u2019s not just a script anyone can read,\u201d Singh said. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely my perspective, my experience. \u2026 you\u2019re getting to know Lilly: what Lilly believes, what Lilly\u2019s been through, what Lilly\u2019s good at. You really will get to know me, just like my YouTube audience has gotten the chance to do.\u201d\n\nShe also promises as much sketch comedy as she can fit in, conversations with her audience as well as guests, and musical performances that she envisions as \u201cmore stripped down and intimate.\u201d Singh readily acknowledges that the restrictions of federally regulated broadcast TV - certain pesky expletives, for starters - make it far different from the online realm.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s about picking my battles, to be honest,\u201d Singh said during a recent production lunch break. \u201cWe\u2019re still early in the process, but there\u2019s been some things where I understand why I wouldn\u2019t be able to say it. But if I feel like a statement or a sentence really is representative of my experience, I will fight for it. I can say that everything I\u2019ve been very passionate about has been cleared.\u201d\n\nShe said she isn\u2019t inclined to make \u201csuper controversial\u201d statements, but readily offer an example of where she would hold the line against network edits.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m ever told that something about me being a woman of color, my experience, is not relatable or it\u2019s not going to be accepted, I\u2019ll fight for that. Anything that brings my perspective is definitely what I\u2019m going to fight for,\u201d Singh said.\n\nThe show\u2019s compressed production schedule calls for taping two episodes a day for three months and then taking a break, freeing Singh up for YouTube and other projects. She\u2019s unafraid of putting in the hard work that a successful show demands - a work ethic she attributes to her parents - and is adamant that she and others who may follow her should be allowed to stand, or fall, on their own.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re a minority, whether it\u2019s a woman or a person of color, it\u2019s like, \u2018This is your shot, and if you mess it up and you\u2019re cut, you\u2019ve ruined it for everybody.\u2019 We need to change that mentality because there are many things on TV from majority groups that are not great,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is not the shot on behalf of all women of color. No, this is me chipping away a path, and we need to get to a place where (my performance) is not tied to another woman of color. We\u2019re all individuals at the end of the day.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The stubborn curfew barring female hosts from late-night network TV is about to be challenged.
