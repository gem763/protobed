In that email, he \"respectfully\" requested customers no longer openly carry firearms and hoped that \"everyone would understand the circumstances that led to this new policy change.\"\n\n\"As it relates to safety in our stores, there have been multiple incidents since El Paso where individuals attempting to make a statement and test our response have entered our stores carrying weapons in a way that frightened or concerned our associates and customers,\u201d McMillon wrote. \u201cWe have also had well-intentioned customers acting lawfully that have inadvertently caused a store to be evacuated and local law enforcement to be called to respond. These incidents are concerning and we would like to avoid them, so we are respectfully requesting that customers no longer openly carry firearms into our stores or Sam\u2019s Clubs in states where 'open carry' is permitted \u2013 unless they are authorized law enforcement officers.\u201d\n\nElsewhere, Walmart said that it would no longer sell certain ammunition that could be used in military-style weapons. The retailer also said it would exit the handgun category by no longer selling ammunition for those firearms. It would also stop selling handguns in Alaska, the last remaining state where they were available after Walmart ended those sales across its fleet in 1993.\n\nMark your calendar.
