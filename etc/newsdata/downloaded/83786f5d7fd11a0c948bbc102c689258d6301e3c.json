But what is the company to do now to keep growing?\n\nMike Shields, the former advertising editor for Business Insider who is now CEO of Shields Strategic Consulting, argues that Roku's next logical step is to sell to a giant, be it Google, AT&T, Samsung, or even Facebook.\n\nThe other option is for Roku to give its ad tech away to anyone else who'll take it, such as Xbox or PlayStation.\n\nClick here for more BI Prime stories.\n\nRoku generated plenty of buzz last week when it announced plans to acquire ad tech firm Dataxu for $150 million.\n\nThe question is, what will Roku do next?\n\nBecause as strong as Roku's position appears to be in the exploding \"connected TV ad market,\" the company's aspiration to build the advertising infrastructure for TV's future is likely to run out of headroom \u2014 maybe soon. That's because TV manufactures and titans like Comcast and Amazon are looking to borrow from the Roku playbook, while locking up market share \u2014 and maybe freezing Roku out in the process.\n\nTherefore, despite Roku's apparent OTT pole position, it may prove that its next best move is to sell. The good news is that Roku would make for perfect strategic acquisition for a number of aspiring TV players.\n\nIn the near term, the Dataxu deal was a clear power move for an early leader in the OTT advertising sector \u2014 one that had positively Googley (or is it Googlelian) echoes.\n\nRoku already has its own tech to serve ads on loads of TV apps, and it boasts of robust data on its 30-million-plus users, ranging from registration information to viewership patterns. Now with Dataxu's ad buying platform in place, Roku can have its hooks into every step of OTT ad placement \u2014 very much like Google's digital ad stack.\n\nThis stack ensures that Roku remains an essential player as this red-hot ad segment quickly develops. That is, for now.\n\nIt is worth wondering, what's the end game for Roku? Does the company aspire to build the ad ecosystem for TV's future? Can it realistically get there?\n\nConsider that even as Roku gets bigger, Amazon is selling loads of Fire TVs, and Black Friday/Cyber Monday are right around the corner. Meanwhile, Comcast is giving away free streaming devices.\n\nBank of America says not to worry about this, rating Roku's stock as a buy.\n\nAnd yes, it's true that Roku can gain distribution by not just selling hardware, but by baking its software into more and more television sets. But the company seems to have a natural ceiling, since non-Roku households aren't easily converted into Roku homes. Which limits brands ad targeting options. I could be wrong about this, but TV ad tech looks to be shaping up like an all-or-nothing prospect \u2014 your TV is likely reachable via a single ad delivery system, unlike a few hundred on the average web page, right?\n\nSo how does Roku get bigger?\n\nOne route Roku could go is to try and give its ad tech away to anyone else who'll take it. For instance, could Roku agree to hand over its ad delivery software to Xbox and PlayStation (people forget that gaming consoles were TV app devices before it was cool).\n\nCould Roku convince the new CBS/Viacom to plug Roku's ad products into CBS All Access and PlutoTV? Is that crazy?\n\nOr is the right move \u2014 the obvious move for Roku \u2014 to sell itself to a giant?\n\nGiven its $17 billion market cap, the list of potential acquirers is not a long one. Here are some ideas on who might make sense:\n\nDisney: The media conglomerate already owns BAM, so it's not afraid to invest in digital technology. What better way to get Disney+ in more homes than to push it on to every Roku device? And maybe push Netflix out of the way in the process.\n\nThe media conglomerate already owns BAM, so it's not afraid to invest in digital technology.

Google: The search behemoth has been dying to break into TV ads in a meaningful way for over a decade. It already has a robust ad serving product that works with the likes of Bloomberg and CBS. But it doesn't control these partners' ad inventory. Roku would give it a massive entry point.\n\nThe search behemoth has been dying to break into TV ads in a meaningful way for over a decade.

AT&T: With Xandr, AT&T has already built a vibrant platform for addressable (set top-driven) TV ads. Roku could push it into OTT rapidly.
