However, the move doesn't come as a surprise to UBS, whose view on Alstom's stock remains positive. \"This has long been awaited by investors, and doesn't preclude our positive view on Alstom's shares, which continue to be supported by strong rolling stock, signaling and services fundamentals, as well as a strong set company targets,\" the banks says. UBS maintains its buy rating on the company. Alstom's shares are down 5.1% at EUR37.36.
