I\u2019ll update some more.\"", "description": "A number of conspiracy theories claim the famous rapper didn't actually die in 1996 and is still alive today", "authors": ["Vicki Newman", "Image", "Washington County Detention Center", "Time Life Pictures Getty Images", "The Life Images Collection Via G", "Rex"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article13408752.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Rap-music-star-Tupac-Shakur-is-seen-at-the-MTV-Music-Video-Awards-in-New-York-New-York.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
