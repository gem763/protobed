Let's resolve the issue of Brexit, give the British public a final say. Leave the EU on terms negotiated by the government or the option of remaining.'\n\nHe added after that there should be a general election straight away.\n\nMr Khan's position matches deputy leader Tom Watson's and shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry's, with the latter admitting on Thursday she had reservations about an election before Brexit.", "description": "The Mayor of London (pictured) said the Labour leader would be wrong to continue with his current Brexit strategy, branding it a 'fudge'.", "authors": ["James Gant For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/17/19630664-0-image-a-29_1570898055725.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
