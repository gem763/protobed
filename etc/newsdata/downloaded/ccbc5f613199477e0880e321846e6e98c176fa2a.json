(Photo by Koichi Kamoshida, Getty Images)\n\nThe Australian property market looks set for another crazy ride according to the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) which is forecasting another price boom.\n\nThe RBA expects construction activity, which is already surprisingly slow, to continue declining into next year, creating a supply shortfall, deputy governor Guy Debelle said in a speech on Thursday.\n\nAs demand returns to the market, there looks like there won\u2019t be enough stock to cater for it, leading to yet another price surge in the \u2014 already expensive \u2014 Sydney and Melbourne markets.\n\nHere we go again.\n\nAustralia is headed towards yet another property supply shortage, and it could put a rocket under prices, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has warned.\n\n\u201cWhile the increase in supply has finally met the earlier increase in demand, demand will continue to grow given population growth but supply is going to decline. So there is quite likely to be a shortfall again in the foreseeable future,\u201d RBA deputy governor Guy Debelle told an investment conference in Sydney on Thursday.\n\nFor those not living under a rock, Debelle\u2019s words should trigger a serious sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. Those same conditions led to prices running away for years, pricing many out of the market entirely in Sydney and Melbourne. Prices in those cities shot up 75% and 58% respectively between 2012 and 2017.\n\nFor those who didn\u2019t own ten houses, and wanted to get into those markets, there\u2019s was then a palpable sense of relief as prices descended slightly from their lofty heights over the last 18 months.\n\nLess so when a rebound began following the federal election, a reloosening of lending standards, and a series of rate cuts that brought the cost of borrowing down.\n\nREAD MORE: Sydney and Melbourne house prices have soared again, as the Australian property market surges by the most in two and a half years\n\nConstruction of residential property is already declining and the RBA forecasts a larger downturn ahead\n\nAll those levers have helped stir up demand, at the same time that construction activity cools, limiting the stock of new houses coming to market.\n\n\u201cThe housing construction cycle in Australia clearly turned down at the end of last year. That brought to an end a long upswing at the national level that started in 2012,\u201d Debelle said.\n\n\u201cSince September 2018, residential construction activity has declined by 9 per cent. The decline has been broad-based across detached and higher-density housing, as well as spending on renovations.\u201d\n\nThe major problem with a dwindling new supply of housing is that it takes a long time to get it going again, particularly when it comes to the kind of high-density housing required in Sydney and Melbourne for example. That creates long lead times where momentum, both up and down, takes a while to build and a while to actually come to fruition.\n\nREAD MORE: Australia\u2019s construction downturn is getting worse\n\nThe level of residential properties coming to market.\n\n\u201cGiven the large size of the pipeline, we had expected construction activity to remain at a pretty high level for most of this year, but it turned down sooner and by more than we had expected,\u201d Debelle said. \u201cBuilding approvals are around 40 per cent lower than their peak in late 2017.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are forecasting a further 7% decline in dwelling investment over the next year, and there is some risk the decline could be even larger,\u201d Debelle said, noting that 2020 could be the year construction bottoms.\n\nPrices accordingly are expected to surge once again in major markets, with economic repercussions\n\nWith all that said, it leaves Debelle with a pretty clear view of where the property market is headed.\n\nAustralian house prices\n\n\u201cThe housing price cycle has also turned, but in the opposite way to the construction cycle,\u201d Debelle said. \u201cThe growth in demand without a meaningful supply response will lead to a larger price response.\u201d\n\nIn layman\u2019s terms, with slowing supply, and growing demand, the RBA\u2019s thinking is prices can really only go one way \u2014 up.\n\nHold on to your hats, we could be in for another wild ride.\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
