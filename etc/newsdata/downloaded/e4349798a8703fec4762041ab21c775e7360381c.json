This makes it less likely the will cut in November, although expectations were only around 20% anyway. Trimmed mean (RBA\u2019s preferred gauge) remain steady at 1.6% YoY and 0.4% QoQ, although weighed mean was revised lower to 1.2% YoY (1.3% prior) and 0.3% QoQ (0.4% prior). Still \u2013 it\u2019s possible RBA could make it to the new year without further easing, unless employment completely turns in the meantime.\n\nin Japan soared by 9.1% YoY in September \u2013 although this new-found appetite for \u2018stuff\u2019 was in fact the rush to beat October\u2019s sales tax hike. If history is to be repeated, expect retail sales to tank in the coming months.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen a few whipsaws across AUD and NZD pairs but, with volatility remaining low overall, not too much can be deciphered from it. Other than it was a news release (AU CPI) and we\u2019re trading back near open prices. And, of course, traders are waiting for today\u2019s highly anticipated and Powell\u2019s .\n\nAsian Cash Indices % Change\n\nEquity Brief:\n\nAlmost all Asian stock markets are in profit-taking mode after 3 to 5-days of consecutive gains as traders wait for the Fed FOMC meeting outcome and forward guidance on U.S. monetary policy out later at the 2nd half of the U.S. session today. Later after the close of the U.S. session, technology bellwether Apple (NASDAQ: ) will report its Q4 fiscal earnings and it will include 10 days of its new iPhone 11 sales.\n\nAlso, the usual \u201chot and cold\u201d cycle of U.S-China trade related news flow is making its way back to market again. Reuters had reported that a U.S. administration official said an interim agreement between U.S. and China may not be completed in time for signing in Nov but the official had added that it did not mean the deal was falling apart. This remark ran counter with the earlier optimism expressed by U.S. President Trump where he was expecting to sign \u201cPhase 1 of the trade deal\u201d with China\u2019s Xi during the upcoming APEC Summit in 16-17 Nov.\n\nThe worst performer today is Australia's which has declined close to -0.80% led by mining and natural resources related stocks. BHP, Rio Tinto (LON: ) and Fortescue Metals have shed as much as -1.3%, -1.2% and -1.6% respectively on the backdrop of a weaker iron ore futures price.\n\nBucking the profit taking trend is the Singapore\u2019s Straits Times Index (STI) which has recorded a modest gain of 0.33% led by the three banks; DBS, UOB and OCBC that have rallied by 1.30%, 0.64% and 0.93% respectively. UOB will report its Q3 earnings this coming Fri, 01 Nov before the market open.\n\nThe S&P 500 E-Mini futures has traded almost unchanged as at today's Asia mid-session with a tight range of 5 points after a slide of 0.08% from its new all-time high level of 3046 printed yesterday in the cash S&P 500 index.\n\nUp Next\n\nUS data is the firt main event, with expectations for it to soften to 1.6% from 2% YoY prior. Fed Atlanta\u2019s GDPnow however expects it fall to 1.7%, which may leave room for a small positive surprise head of the main event.\n\nThe Fed and BOC hold their policy meetings, which will more than likely take precedence over the 2nd tier economic data available in the European. Check out the previews for a run down of how things could play out.\n\nEconomic Calendar\n\nDisclaimer: The information and opinions in this report are for general information use only and are not intended as an offer or solicitation with respect to the purchase or sale of any currency or CFD contract.
