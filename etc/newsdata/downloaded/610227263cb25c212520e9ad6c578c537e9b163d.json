SPF is still recommended, but the fact that I'm exposed to screens more than I am to actual sunlight now began to worry me.\n\nMy beloved EltaMD UV Clear sunscreen lacked specific protection against blue light omitted from screens, and after staring at my computer all day and then staring at my television once I get home, I decided to switch up my sunscreen to add more protection against blue light.\n\nThis $46 sunscreen protects against UV rays and blue light that comes from screens\n\nI came across Coola's Full Spectrum 360 Sun Silk Drops SPF 30, a sunscreen specifically formulated to help protect against both UV rays and blue light, at Sephora one day.\n\nI was initially drawn to the packaging \u2014 it's pink and the dropper-style bottle was unusual for a sunscreen. Price-wise, $46 seemed outrageous for a 1-ounce bottle of sunscreen but by that point, I was too invested and really wanted to try it, so I bought it and told myself that I'd only buy it once and never again.\n\nUnfortunately for my bank account, there is a high chance that I'll buy another bottle again.\n\nSeeing the pink bottle every morning gives me joy in a Marie Kondo-like way, but I'm very picky when it comes to the way products actually feel on my face.\n\nI can't stand skin-care products that absorb too slowly, are sticky, or are heavy on my skin. I loved the EltaMD UV Clear sunscreen I was using for years previously, and it checked all the boxes so it was hard to replace. Coola's Sun Silk Drops sunscreen also happens to meet all those requirements and more, protecting your skin when you're outside in the sun and inside in front of a screen.\n\nThe formula is silky and smells amazing though the color is interesting, like a strange mixture of milk and a touch of glitter. The sunscreen drops also have acid for intense moisture, neroli flower extract to help calm and soothe, antioxidants to help protect against free radical damage, and botanical cell actives to help protect against blue light damage.\n\nI feel more comfortable staring at screens for hours when I wear this sunscreen\n\nUnlike my previous sunscreen, Coola's Sun Silk Drops is not a mineral sunscreen. It does, however, market itself as being reef-safe because there's no oxybenzone. Eventually, I may try Coola's Mineral Sun Silk Cr\u00e8me SPF 30 to see how the mineral version compares to the chemical version.\n\nThe blue light protection in the Coola sunscreen may or may not do its job in the long run, but it's reassuring to at least know that the sunscreen is SPF 30. Spending $46 for a small bottle of sunscreen still seems outrageous to me, but I justify spending more money on sun-care products now to avoid sun damage down the road.", "description": "Coola's Full Spectrum 360 Sun Silk Drops helps protect my skin from blue light damage.
