He asked her for her identification and tried to issue her a citation.\n\nPolice recently released the body cam footage from the arrest that shows Hansen being arrested on the ground after Katsikis and Corvallis Police Officer Donald Sheldon claimed she wasn't cooperating.\n\nIn the 38-minute video, Hansen is heard asking the trooper questions after he demanded to see her identification.\n\nGenesis Hansen, 21, was stopped by Oregon State Police trooper Kelly Katsikis on October 13 as she was traveling down Northwest 16th Street in Corvallis\n\nPolice recently released the body cam footage from the arrest that shows Hansen being arrested on the ground after Katsikis and Corvallis Police Officer Donald Sheldon claimed she wasn't cooperating\n\nBoth officers are then seen holding Hansen down as they place handcuffs around her wrists\n\nThe discussion continued for several minutes until Katsikis said: 'I need you to either give me your identification now or you are going to be under arrest. Do you understand that?'\n\nHansen responded: 'I don\u2019t answer questions.'\n\nThe officers then tried to place her arms behind her back and Hansen stepped backward and fell to the ground. Both officers are then seen holding Hansen down as they place handcuffs around her wrists.\n\nThere were several witnesses nearby and one woman yelled: 'She\u2019s a young woman, you do not need to be on top of her. She is not resisting. You are so much bigger than her. This type of force is not necessary.'\n\nThe officers eventually helped Hansen to her feet and escorted her to a police car.\n\nShe was arrested on charges of interfering with an officer and resisting arrest.\n\nFollowing the incident, Oregon State University released a statement that reads: 'We remain concerned about what was portrayed occurring in the video. And we have asked that law enforcement policies and practices by Oregon State Police \u2014 and other local law enforcement agencies \u2014 be examined for evidence of implicit and explicit bias.'\n\nThe university said it has also offered support services to Hansen.\n\nThere were several witnesses nearby and one woman yelled: 'She\u2019s a young woman, you do not need to be on top of her.
