Usually we\u2019d think we\u2019re seeing bugs. Dual polarization radar products argue otherwise and some of these returns are above 10,000ft\u201d.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe service added: \u201cMigrating dragonflies is a possibility...they migrate in fall, usually prior to cooler weather arriving, and towards areas where more precipitation has fallen recently. That said, not sure DFs can fly that high or if they move in numbers great enough to produce these returns\u201d\n\nAnother National Weather Service station in Cleveland also picked up the huge cloud and asked users on Twitter to guess what was causing it.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Scientists consider the tiger to be \"functionally extinct\" as one has not been sighted for over 25 years 4/17 Sumatran Orangutan The Sumatran orangutan was once found across the island of Sumatra and even further south on Java. Today it is found only in the island's north and its population stands at 14,613 Getty 5/17 Western Lowland Gorilla Though it is the most populous of all gorilla subspecies, the western lowland gorilla is still critically endangered and its population has declined by 60% in the last quarter century Getty 6/17 Sumatran Rhinoceros The Sumatran rhinoceros is the smallest of the surviving rhinoceros species. Only 80 are known to be living today. The last male Sumatran rhino in Malaysia died on 28 May 2019 Willem V Strien 7/17 Sumatran Tiger There are fewer than 400 Sumatran tigers left today. They are severely threatened by deforestation and poaching Getty 8/17 Eastern Lowland Gorilla Half of the rainforest of the Democratic Republic of Congo in which these gorillas live has been destroyed the past 50 years.

Felt like King Kong with all the planes around him,\u201d wrote George Cheripko in reply to the NWS tweets.\n\n\u201cDefinitely dragon flies,\u201d said another person. \u201cWe have thousands flying around our yard and the field next to our yard.\u201d\n\nJason Dickhart added: \u201cI saw a million dragonflies in my yard yesterday. Squirrels were going nuts.\u201d\n\nThe species is reportedly the common green darner \u2013 named due to their resemblance to a darning needle. They fly south at the end of the summer, following their prey \u2013 mosquitoes and flies \u2013 to warmer climates in the southern states and central American countries.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.
