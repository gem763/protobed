The burst must have been roughly equal to 100 star explosions in order to produce such large structures.\n\n\"These enormous bubbles have until now been hidden by the glare of extremely bright radio emission from the center of the galaxy,\" said study co-author Fernando Camilo, chief scientist at the South African Radio Astronomy Observatory, in a statement.\n\nCamilo is part of an international team led by Ian Heywood, an astrophysicist at the University of Oxford, which detected the bubbles. The discovery was made with the MeerKAT radio telescope, a facility with 64 radio antennae, located north of the town of Carnarvon, South Africa.\n\nMeerKAT became operational in 2018, and the new study is based off some of its very first observations. \"Teasing out the bubbles from the background noise was a technical tour de force, only made possible by MeerKAT's unique characteristics and ideal location,\u201d Camilo said.\n\nThe center of the Milky Way is profoundly influenced by Sagittarius A*, a supermassive black hole with a mass equivalent to four million Suns. Though this black hole is relatively tranquil compared to ones observed in other galactic cores, it still occasionally binges on gas, dust, and even stars. Scientists think they may have observed one of these episodes earlier this year, for instance.\n\nThe radio bubbles detected by Heywood\u2019s team were most likely belched out by Sagittarius A* after an unusually big gulp of material. The blowout sent jets of charged particles rocketing away from the galactic core, which were sculpted into the modern bubbly shape in part by the intense magnetic field lines surrounding the black hole.\n\n\u201cWith this unexpected discovery we're witnessing in the Milky Way a novel manifestation of galaxy-scale outflows of matter and energy, ultimately governed by the central black hole,\" Camilo said.", "description": "\"These enormous bubbles have until now been hidden by the glare of extremely bright radio emission from the center of the galaxy.\"", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d794d13d174ca00086a89b1/lede/1568230683262-giantballoon.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.9373286106032906xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
