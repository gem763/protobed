It tastes like a bit of apple juice is mixed in with the classic Coca-Cola formula. The flavor is not artificial at all which is great. I would\u2019ve loved if the flavor was a bit stronger but in any case, I loved this! I only wish the US got this. Forget the raspberry and peach cokes, this is much better! Hopefully, they restock so I can get a couple more bottles.\u201d\n\nFox News reached out to Coca-Cola to check if there were any plans to bring the apple flavor to the United States, but they did not immediately respond.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFor now, U.S. customers will have to settle for Orange Vanilla Coke or Cherry Coke if they\u2019re looking for a fruit-flavored soda.", "description": "Unlike apples, a soda a day probably won\u2019t keep the doctor away, but that doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t taste the same.", "authors": ["Michael Hollan"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/Coke-products.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
