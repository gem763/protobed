The SG CTA index fell for a seventh day in eight on Sept. 13, putting it on track for its fourth-worst month this century.\n\n\u201cCTAs have seen essentially all of their trades backfire, what with the mass unwinding of bearish trades and the momentum crash in bond futures since the beginning of the month, along with the surge in the price of crude oil yesterday,\u201d Masanari Takada, cross-asset strategist at Nomura, wrote in a note to clients. Even in comparison with other major hedge fund strategies, the performance of CTAs \u201chas deteriorated remarkably,\u201d he said.\n\nThe question isn\u2019t why trend-followers missed oil\u2019s record one-day spike -- the commodity has been trading sideways for months -- but whether the rally will be solid enough to lure the fast money onto the bandwagon.\n\nStrategists at JPMorgan say that\u2019s likely to happen, which could further juice prices. \u201cA similar contract uplift can occur once signals for the energy futures trend turns positive,\u201d Marko Kolanovic and Bram Kaplan wrote in a note.\n\nOil and gas contracts have soared through key moving averages, a sign there will be \u201csignificant short covering\u201d by CTAs, they wrote. From a macroeconomic perspective, geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and recent progress in U.S.-China trade talks should add tailwinds.\n\nTD Securities strategists led by Bart Melek also say CTAs are likely to ramp up bets on Brent and WTI futures now that the contracts have breached estimated trigger levels.\n\nThe sudden market gyrations further threaten what was shaping up to be a pretty good year for trend-chasing quants. The SG CTA Index was up 12% going into September, when the worst week for government bonds in nearly three years punished the cohort\u2019s long positions in sovereign debt.\n\nOil\u2019s abrupt reversal has been particularly cruel. Both the SG CTA Index\u2019s beta to crude -- or the portion of returns attributable to it -- and official positioning data show trend-followers and macro hedge funds were betting against the commodity, according to JPMorgan.\n\nOf course, thanks to 2019\u2019s spirited stock and bond rally, trend-followers are still up 7% this year. Societe Generale\u2019s index tracks a basket of 20 funds.\n\nFurther declines in government bonds sparked by Wednesday\u2019s Federal Reserve meeting could spell more trouble for the group, though.\n\n\u201cIf the Fed were indeed to take a hawkish turn, the situation would be nightmarish for CTAs,\u201d said Nomura\u2019s Takada.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Justina Lee in London at jlee1489@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Samuel Potter at spotter33@bloomberg.net, Yakob Peterseil, Sid Verma\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Monday\u2019s oil spike blindsided many investors, but in one corner of quant land the fallout was particularly punishing.Systematic investors known as commodity trading advisors, whose strategies track price trends across assets, held record short positions in oil and gas futures before a", "authors": ["Justina Lee"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/wvgZ6i6qHo7DjelYF3_vgA--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/a00124ad49a20502d195265d64bb05df", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
