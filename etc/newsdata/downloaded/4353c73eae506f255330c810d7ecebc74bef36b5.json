My original plan was to photograph the lives of Chinese migrant workers at night.\n\nI imagined that they would probably go to some colourful places and do some interesting things after nightfall. But I was completely wrong \u2013 every day they went straight back to their dormitories, where they would eat, chat, play some poker, probably watch an outdoor movie once a month, and that was it!\n\nI was about to give up when I noticed that there were many women in the dormitories. I got curious so I asked the other workers: \u201cYour boss has no problem having wives living here too?\u201d One of them replied: \u201cThey also work here at the construction site.\u201d To be honest, I was very surprised because in my mind, construction work has always been a job for men.\n\nAfter that, it seemed natural to turn my camera to these female workers. I went up to them, introduced myself, and asked for their permission to document their lives for a couple of days. I was lucky that the ladies and their husbands were all very nice.\n\nThe female workers were mostly middle-aged, and they came to work here with their husbands or their friends from home. When they were younger, they had to stay at home to raise children themselves as their husbands were away working in cities.\n\nAfter the children grew to a certain age, they realised they could still go out and make more money. However, at their ages, it is really difficult to find jobs as waitresses or factory workers. Plus some of them were also worried about their husbands after long separations. Therefore, they ended up at construction sites, selling their labour to do \u201clight work\u201d such as transporting sand, painting and cleaning, as they don\u2019t have the expertise to do skilled jobs. Their salaries are the lowest in the industry (about $13-21 per day), only 50 \u2013 70 percent of male workers\u2019.\n\nAnd each of them has a different story.\n\nZou Yunli, 38, from a village in Guizhou province, is the mother of two. She was a farmer all her life until six years ago, when she decided to leave her village to make more money for her children\u2019s tuition fees. She first worked at a metal factory, but \u201cthe air pollution there was quite bad,\u201d she said, \u201cI didn\u2019t feel quite well after working a few years.\u201d Therefore, she left the factory and became a plasterer on this construction site. \u201cThe pay is similar (to the factory), but we have more freedom here, so I\u2019m very happy,\u201d she said as she smiled.\n\nZuo Xiaohong, 41, is from Chongqing. A few years ago, her house and land were acquired by the government to make way for a highway construction project. She and her husband had nothing else to do but to find jobs elsewhere. She is planning to work for a few more years, then take the money home and build their new house, where her grandchildren will grow up.\n\nStories like these back up evidence that more and more women are leaving their homes, accounting for a slice of the mighty force of construction workers. In fact, a report by The Economist magazine stated that women in China represent 49 percent of the population and 46 percent of the labor force \u2013 a higher rate than in many countries in the West. According to a report by the International Labour Organization, around a third of Chinese migrant workers are women.\n\nA survey done by the All-China Women's Federation in 2006 also showed that nearly half of female migrant workers are not officially employed, but only working as \u201ctemporary staff\u201d, with poor working conditions and less income than men. But none of these challenges stop them. Because according to my interviewees, the income from one man is no longer enough to support an entire family, so women need to make more money.\n\nEvery day, after a 12-hour shift, unlike the men, what the ladies want most is a nice shower. They had to line up to get water with buckets and basins because running water would be cut off later at night. Yes, their jobs, their needs and even their lives could not be more basic, but no one can deny the old Chinese saying that \u201cwomen lift up half the sky\u201d in this country.\n\nMigrant workers give away their youth, their sweat and their blood to build the cities we live in. To me, they have always been the true unsung heroes of the fast-growing economy. I am willing to chant for them whenever I have a chance.", "description": "Ou Mei\u2019s bright clothes stand out among the dust of the construction site where she works in suburban Shanghai after coming here from the countryside as one of China\u2019s millions of rural-to-urban migrant workers.", "authors": ["Aly Song"], "top_image": "https://photos.wi.gcs.trstatic.net/WBTnOVC7qqta06gXHeKsQ-ZgFEmXYDYVXcBZqjAthg1v-jzaaVw7RK-H4NCjfzW71LhS-hW7HZ7hmmPBDG-5oBaD8ao2YQQbZNEr_HZCtbSFuZ99X1v_1BUU9rjuOA9w"}
