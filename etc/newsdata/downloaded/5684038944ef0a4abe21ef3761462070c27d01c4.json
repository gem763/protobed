Also Friday, Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso will meet with reporters at the end of discussions among finance ministers and central bank governors from the Group of 20 major industrial nations.\n\nAll the meetings, which are scheduled to conclude Saturday, are expected to be dominated by debate over the best way to cool rising trade tensions, which have seen the world's two biggest economies, the United States and China, impose punitive tariffs on billions of dollars of each other's exports.\n\nThe U.S.-China trade war has had ripple effects that have contributed to a significant, synchronized slowdown across 90% of the globe.\n\nMeeting with reporters Thursday, Georgieva said a tentative U.S.-China trade agreement announced last week by President Donald Trump should lessen slightly the damage done by the trade war \u2014 but until the two nations resolved their differences, it would not remove enough uncertainty to return the globe to solid growth.\n\nGeorgieva said the tariffs still being imposed would result in 0.6% in lost global output by the end of 2020, down a bit from the 0.8% in lost output the IMF had initially estimated.\n\nBut she said that result was not good enough and what was needed was for the United States and China to resolve all their trade issues and for all countries to work together to modernize the rules of global trade to lessen friction in the future.\n\n\"Our hope is to move from a trade truce to a trade peace,\" she told reporters.\n\nThe IMF released an updated economic outlook Tuesday that projected global growth for this year at 3%. That would be the weakest showing since a negative 0.1% in 2009, in the wake of the worst financial crisis since the 1930s.\n\nGeorgieva, a Bulgarian economist who had held the No. 2 job at the World Bank, was tapped last month to take over at the IMF, succeeding Christine Lagarde.\n\nIn her news conference Thursday, she said she hoped this week's talks would focus on ways to ease trade tensions and begin the groundwork to update the rules of world trade. The Trump administration has repeatedly attacked the Geneva-based World Trade Organization, saying it is biased against the United States.\n\n\"We have been reaching agreements on trade based primarily on the past,\" she said. She noted that global commerce has been transformed in recent years by advances in technology, and those advances need to be acknowledged in new trade rules.\n\nMalpass, who took over as head of the World Bank earlier this year, said his focus for the meetings will be efforts to ensure that everything possible is done to restart global growth, given that the 700 million people living in extreme poverty \u2014 one in 12 people on the planet \u2014 will be the most harmed by a prolonged slowdown.\n\n\"There is an urgency to what we're doing because of the challenges facing development,\" Malpass said. \"Global growth is slowing, investment is sluggish, manufacturing activity is soft and trade is weakening.\"\n\nIn his announcement last week, Trump said he was suspending a tariff increase on $250 billion of Chinese products that had been scheduled to take effect this week.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told reporters Wednesday that the U.S. and Chinese negotiators were working to hammer out details on this \"phase one\" agreement.\n\nHe said he and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer would speak by phone with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, the head of the Chinese negotiating team, next week and planned to meet with him in Santiago, Chile, before the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation leaders' summit on Nov. 16-17.\n\nIt is expected that Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping will meet at that summit to sign the initial phase of the deal, if it is finalized by that time.\n\nMnuchin said the administration has made no decision yet on whether it will postpone 15% tariffs on $160 billion in Chinese goods still due to take effect Dec. 15.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
