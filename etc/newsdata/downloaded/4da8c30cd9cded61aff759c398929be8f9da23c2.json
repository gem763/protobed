Campaigners said Turner's sentence helped to perpetuate a \u201cculture of impunity for high-status perpetrators of sexual assault or domestic violence\u201d.\n\nProsecutors had called a six-year jail term for the student, a star of the elite university's swimming team, after he was convicted of sexually assaulting and attempting to rape an unconscious woman on campus in 2015.\n\nBut the judge sentenced him to six months, of which he served only three. He ruled Turner bore \u201cless moral culpability\u201d because he was drunk at the time of the attack and said prison would have \u201ca severe impact on him\u201d.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
