I couldn't even tell her off for it because it was just too funny. I was more overwhelmed than anything.\n\n(Image: Kennedy News and Media)\n\n\"I couldn't believe it. I shouted my partner down and she said 'there's no way she has eaten all of them'.\n\n\"But I told her, 'I think she has because she's just told me she has'. It really made us laugh. She obviously really enjoys those yoghurts.\n\n\"They aren't massive pots but just the way she'd got them out the fridge, opened and eaten them all then was sat there still with the spoon in her hand as if to say 'give me more' was so funny.\n\n\"I had to wet wipe her face as she was covered in it. Then I thought 'why haven't I taken a photo of this?'.\n\n\"I put it on Snapchat at first but my friends told me it needed to go on Facebook and it's gone mad.\n\n\"I'm not a big user of Facebook so I wasn't expecting it at all.\"\n\n(Image: Kennedy News and Media)\n\nWhen his fianc\u00e9e Billie Hardie, 26, was doing her hair and their kids were busy 'doing their own thing', Arron decided to take the opportunity to fix the fencing in their back garden.\n\nThe dad popped in and out of the house to check on his children when his son Oscar, six, went out into the garden to tell his dad that his younger sister was eating 'a yoghurt'.\n\nArron told Oscar not to worry as he knew Olivia could manage the Petits Filous by herself but he had drastically underestimated her yoghurt eating abilities.\n\nReturning to the kitchen to make sure his daughter hadn't made a mess with her yogurt, he found that she had instead devoured every single pot in the fridge.\n\nBillie, a self-employed childminder, buys the snacks in bulk to be able to feed her own kids and the children she looks after for work.\n\nHer daughter's fromage frais frenzy left her supplies empty and the mum-of-two headed back out on Sunday to refill her stock - which are now being stored on the top shelf, beyond Olivia's reach.\n\n(Image: Kennedy News and Media)\n\nAs Arron and Billie headed to the cinema on Saturday evening, they told the kids' babysitting grandparents what had happened and warned Olivia may have an upset tummy that night.\n\nInstead, the little girl was her 'normal self' and happily polished off her dinner.\n\nArron added: \"I don't think Oscar realised Olivia was going to eat all the yoghurts. He just saw her eating one and thought 'maybe she shouldn't be doing that' so came to tell me.\n\n\"I told him 'that's fine, don't worry about it'. As long as she wasn't pouring it on the floor, it seemed fine.\n\n\"I went in about 10 minutes later to make sure she hadn't made a mess and there she was.\n\n\"I thought maybe she would have eaten one or two but for her to sit there and eat the whole lot, I didn't think she had it in her.\n\n\"She does love her snacks. She doesn't really eat loads at dinner or tea time but if you offer her a yoghurt or fruit, she'll always find room for it somewhere.\n\n\"She's such a little character, she keeps us busy put it that way.\n\n\"If there's mischief to get up to, Olivia will be the first one there.\"", "description": "When dad Arron Whysall came in from the garden, he found his daughter Olivia surrounded by 18 empty pots of Petit Filous", "authors": ["Luke Matthews", "Image", "Kennedy News", "Media"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20646848.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_PAY-KNM_TOT_18_YOGHURT_BINGE_1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
