The Standard now lead the full-season standings with eight points.\n\nDressel, the 23-year-old American, dominated his ISL debut, winning the men's 100-metre freestyle, 50 butterfly and skins on Sunday, giving him a total of four individual titles and one runner-up finish for the weekend.\n\n\"Every single one of them,\" said Dressel when asked if he enjoyed the skins race shortly after his win. \"It was an absolute blast, just getting up and racing. Two solid days of racing from the whole team here, not just me.\"\n\n\"We still came up short. I want to do the best that I can to where we come out on top.
