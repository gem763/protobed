Any lease that goes into effect after the laws were signed is subject to new rules: For instance, rent-stabilized apartments no longer can be reclassified as market rate (regardless of a tenant\u2019s income or increases in monthly rent), and landlords may only charge up to $89 for improvements (down from $1,000). There\u2019s also good news for those who aren\u2019t fortunate enough to live in a regulated $800 studio in the West Village, like a cap on security deposits at one month\u2019s rent and a $20 limit on application fees. And landlords are also required to give 30 days\u2019 notice if they plan to raise the rent over 5 percent. But what about finding an apartment to begin with? Rents have exploded throughout the boroughs to record highs, Craigslist remains a cesspool of poorly lit scams, and Zillow \u2014 which owns StreetEasy, HotPads, Naked Apartments, and Trulia \u2014 has virtually monopolized the online-listings market, resulting in one company controlling prices as well as lifting fees, which brokers are passing on to renters. For many New Yorkers, going outside the system \u2014 whether by joining a Facebook group for vegans or stalking a certain cul-de-sac until you see a for rent sign \u2014 remains the best way to find a place. Here are their tales.\n\nDon\u2019t Ignore:\n\nThe Streetlight Flyer\n\n\u201cI was living in New Jersey and wanted to move to the city. I was on Roosevelt Avenue in Jackson Heights and saw a few signs. One said \u2018Room for one person in Jamaica\u2019 in Spanish. Follow your intuition: If it doesn\u2019t feel right, don\u2019t continue; same way when it feels right. My new landlord is not aware of the apps and does things the old-school way, as we do in Latino countries \u2014 on the phone, I felt that he was a good person. I\u2019ve been month-to-month ever since.\u201d \u2014Karen Virues, English student and Spanish tutor\n\nIllustration: Nishant Choksi\n\nOr the Health-Food Store Bulletin Board\n\n\u201cMy boyfriend and I had been looking in Bushwick \u2014 everything was expensive with a weird layout. We went into the Hana health-food store, by the Jefferson stop, and saw this bulletin board, the kind everyone ignores, with ads for yoga and dog walking. One cryptically said \u2018Apartment in Bushwick.\u2019 Couldn\u2019t hurt to call, we figured. It was this two-story, wooden-looking condo from the \u201980s \u2014 two bedrooms, washer-dryer, backyard, driveway \u2014 all for $1,700 a month.\u201d \u2014Br\u00e1ulio Amado, graphic designer\n\nBefriend the Door Man of a Building You Want to Live In\n\n\u201cI had my eye on a two-bedroom in Fidi. It had been on the market for 100 days but was no longer on StreetEasy; a broker friend told me they rotate listings in and out to save money. I chatted up the doorman, who let me see it, then contacted the owner and said: \u2018It\u2019s just sitting there unrented.\u2019 I got it $500 below asking.\u201d \u2014Richard Berg, software engineer and musician\n\nDrop a Hand Written Note to Your Potential Landlord\n\nIllustration: Nishant Choksi\n\n\u201cI had just been evicted from my office-work space and saw this beautiful old loft building with glass brick in Chinatown. I put it on my Instagram Stories and said, \u2018Who knows what\u2019s up with this building?\u2019 Somebody commented with the broker\u2019s info. A unit had just become available, but the broker strung us along for two months. My mom, a Realtor in Colorado, was like, \u2018Why don\u2019t you drop a note by the office?\u2019 I said, \u2018That\u2019s the most Boulder thing ever,\u2019 but I did and also made a mood-board deck of what I do. A few days later, the landlord asked me to sign a lease.\u201d \u2014Kalen Kaminski, prop stylist (and tie-dyer)\n\nJoin a Niche Facebook Group\n\nRequest access for pages of meat-free or queer-friendly or Australian-only (but Kiwi-permitting) housing.\n\nThe Shabbat-and-Kosher-Observing One\n\n\u201cI joined SS/SK Classifieds \u2014 Apartment/Roommate Info on the recommendation of some of my Jewish friends. The cool thing about apartment hunting when you are in a community of people who keep Shabbat is that it\u2019s likely you\u2019ll have 80 mutual friends on Facebook with every person, which makes it easy to ensure your would-be roommate isn\u2019t the type who\u2019ll murder you.\u201d \u2014Jordyn Kaufman, 24, content developer at a Jewish nonprofit\n\nThe Queer-to-Queer Housing One\n\n\u201cQueer Housing New York City, a queer/trans-housing Facebook group, is thriving: There are 31,000 active members. It doesn\u2019t allow brokers, or, of course, any sort of intolerance. It also leans toward affordable housing, as it\u2019s meant for a disenfranchised community.\u201d \u2014Fran Tirado, deputy editor of OUT\n\nThe Biggest One of Them All\n\n\u201cGypsy Housing, which has 250,000 members, is comparable in scale to Craigslist but more reliable because the renter and rentee can check out each other\u2019s profiles. I guess that\u2019s the general benefit of finding an apartment on Facebook. I got my last apartment in Bushwick through Gypsy and like it a lot.\u201d \u2014Amar Stewart, artist\n\nAnd Some Other Options\n\n\u27bd Vegan Room Rent NYC: This group requires potential members to answer questions, such as: Are you vegan or vegetarian? And: Are you aware this group is only for those looking for or renting for vegans or vegetarians?\n\n\u27bd Bococago Parents & Families: Though it\u2019s not specifically for housing, two bedrooms in desirable school districts are frequently listed in this South Brooklyn group.\n\n\u27bd Australians in New York \u2014 NYC Accommodation: To qualify, you must first join Australians in New York & NYC, which helps Aussies (who \u201cdon\u2019t mind Kiwis, either\u201d) find other Aussies in the city. Members post listings on the housing offshoot daily.\n\nApply to a Ton of Housing Lotteries\n\nIllustration: Nishant Choksi\n\n\u201cUntil recently, I was working odd jobs and living with roommates in a dump. I had read about the 80/20 Housing Program and, for the hell of it, applied to a dozen. You put in your name, address, number, and email and pick places that fit in your income bracket. It\u2019s like shopping on FreshDirect.\n\nFast-forward three years: I get this email saying this new building wanted to interview me. That was really stressful. They turn over every stone, I handed in two inches of paperwork. I went deep into the Bronx to interview, and three weeks later they offered me a brand-new studio for $1,050 in the South Bronx. I\u2019m two blocks from the 2 express train. The whole thing was worth doing another four times.\u201d \u2014Keith Abrams, AV tech\n\nBarter Your Way to a Better Apartment\n\nIllustration: Nishant Choksi\n\n\u201cA few years back, while working a part-time office job, doing hair weaving on the side, and singing in clubs on weekends \u2014 altogether hustling like crazy to make ends meet and pursuing my dream as a singer \u2014 I met a Realtor, a sister, who worked for a Battery Park City apartment complex. I offered a cool perk: I\u2019d weave her hair if she pulled some strings and helped me find a decent apartment. She did \u2014 and I did. She got some amazing weaves, and I landed a great pad. It turned out fabulous.\u201d \u2014Bette Smith, singer-songwriter\n\nTry a Craigslist or Streeteasy Alternative\n\nOver the past 16 years, what started as a personal, crowdsourced apartment-hunting guide for artist Stephanie Diamond has evolved into a weekly real-estate email that goes out every Wednesday. Diamond and her small team vet potential renters and landlords who post on the newsletter.\n\nAlthough long-term rentals are occasionally featured, the bulk of the listings in this weekly curated email list are geared toward itinerant workers in the artist community, meaning sublets or weeks-long transatlantic apartment swaps.\n\nAs you\u2019d imagine, this site culls listings from luxury buildings across Manhattan (and parts of Brooklyn), where you can search by conventional means (price and neighborhood) and also for specific amenities (like Sub-Zero appliances and in-building bowling alleys, for instance).\n\nThis site allows people looking for apartments to connect directly with people looking to move before their lease is up. Because leaseholders are often desperate to find someone quickly, some users find that they\u2019re likely to find more reasonable rents here than on other, more commonly used platforms.\n\nIf You Do Use Craigslist, Search for Short-Term Sublets\n\n\u201cWhen I was last looking, I decided to check Craigslist\u2019s \u2018short-term sublets\u2019 section because I figured there would be higher-quality places with less competition. I was right: I found a 1,400-square-foot Williamsburg apartment and ended up taking over the former tenant\u2019s lease after it was up.\u201d \u2014Melissa Mash, founder of Dagne Dover\n\nBook a Surf Lesson and an Under-the-Table Apartment\n\nIllustration: Nishant Choksi\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot on offer in the Rockaways on the typical sites like Zillow, but there are far more deals to be had through the local market, which outsiders don\u2019t normally have access to. We\u2019ve been connectors in that way. At least ten times a year, we get a request from someone who maybe took a lesson, saying that they\u2019re looking. They\u2019re often month-to-month, under-the-table deals.\u201d \u2014Mike Reinhardt, founder, Locals Surf School\n\nSidestep Brokers and Go Straight to the Management Company\n\n\u201cIf you go directly to huge management companies like Stonehenge and UDR, you won\u2019t need to pay a broker\u2019s fee. The last time I moved, I just wentto Stuy Town\u2019s website \u2014 they\u2019re the management company for this group of 110 buildings in the area. Their website shows maps of the buildings and available units. We called them up and said, \u2018Hey, we\u2019re interested in this one,\u2019 and they were like,\u2018Okay, cool, we\u2019ll take you.\u2019 \u201d \u2014 Emmanuel Manolidis, accountant\n\nLurk Where You Want to Live\n\nIllustration: Nishant Choksi\n\n\u201cI used to be obsessed with this cul-de-sac street in the Village, Patchin Place. I\u2019d often open the gate and walk down; it\u2019s open to the public because it\u2019s where e.e. cummings lived. One day there was a small sign that had the name and phone number of a real-estate company. It was the number to a woman who\u2019s the Realtor for that block, and it was my ticket in. A few months after I moved in, the other apartment on my floor opened up, and so my best friend moved in next door.\u201d \u2014Emma Straub, owner of Books Are Magic\n\nShare a Home With a Senior Citizen\n\nI learned about the New York Foundation for Senior Citizens\u2019 home-sharing program through an email they sent out through the university. It\u2019s essentially an affordable-housing opportunity for both parties with some companionship built in. I didn\u2019t know what to expect, but I also didn\u2019t want to go through the brokering process \u2014 I didn\u2019t have credit history or guarantors. The foundation got in touch with me and asked what I was looking for, my budget, and the schedule I follow. Ultimately, I was connected with David, a man nearing his 80s in Rego Park, Queens. We\u2019d sometimes go out to lunch or I\u2019d pick up stuff for him\u2014it saved money for both of us. I went through a similar process to find a second roommate uptown, closer to school. Lee spends most of her time in the kitchen watching TV, so when I cook, we\u2019ll chat about our day or big storms that might be coming up.\u201d \u2014Anirban Karak, graduate student at New York University\n\nAsk Todd Anything\n\nIf you frequent the r/NYCapartments or r/askNYC Reddit communities, you\u2019ve probably benefited from Todd Rohulich\u2019s wisdom. Several times a day, the Douglas Elliman broker (who goes by tmm224) offers advice on everything from the new tenant-protection laws to issues surrounding lease takeover, fielding queries as specific as: \u201cWhere should a recently divorced 35-year-old male live in NYC?\u201d\n\nCall a Broker Who Actually Knows the Territory\n\nIllustration: Nishant Choksi\n\nIf you\u2019re looking in \u2026\n\nThe Lower East Side\n\nAhmed Abdallah, R New York\n\n646-270-6595; aabdallah@wernewyork.com\n\n\u27bd Abdallah knows his home turf of Chinatown and Two Bridges, and, after getting tight with the area\u2019s mostly Chinese landlords, helps artists, restaurateurs, and designers like artist Korakrit Arunanondchai and Scarr Pimentel of Scarr\u2019s Pizza secure affordable studios and two-bedrooms. The landlord connections can translate into cheaper rent or even flexibility in the rules, like clearance for Pimentel\u2019s pit bull.\n\nThe Bronx\n\nDavid Rodriguez, EXP Realty\n\n718-451-6859; david.rodriguez@exprealty.com\n\n\u27bd Rodriguez grew up in Mott Haven, so he knows the handful of local brownstone landlords of his parents\u2019 generation. He also handles properties run by generational Bronxites and new homeowners alike throughout the borough, including prewars in Morris Park, Pelham Bay, and Throggs Neck. One of his proudest moments? Finding a two-bedroom with a water view on City Island for $2,150.\n\nGreenpoint\n\nLesley Doukhowetzky, Ula\u2019s Real Estates\n\n917-593-9237; ulasrealestates@yahoo.com\n\n\u27bd Doukhowetzky showed her first apartment in high school, working outside class as an agent for her mother, Ursula \u201cUla\u201d Doukhowetzky. These days, you can\u2019t walk down India Street or Newel Street without passing townhouses that in some way bear the Doukhowetzkys\u2019 fingerprints. Lesley now leads the business; her mom\u2019s clients\u2019 kids are second-generation landlords.\n\nCarroll Gardens or Cobble Hill or Boerum Hill\n\nAllan Gerovitz, Douglas Elliman\n\n347-909-1581; agerovitz@elliman.com\n\n\u27bd Known as the go-to broker among Brooklyn media types, Gerovitz is the keeper of Bococa\u2019s most stately brownstone rentals. His knack is finding pre-market one-bedrooms for dog owners and tin-ceilinged floor-throughs for young parents. Note: He\u2019s Koch-era New York in the flesh. He\u2019ll grill clients on their seriousness about renting; afterward, he may negotiate rents or waive a fee to those in need.\n\nConsider Co-Living\n\nIf you\u2019re willing to live with strangers and pay a little extra, it\u2019s a hassle-free and less-committal way to get a place, and toilet paper\u2019s often included.\n\nIllustration: Nishant Choksi\n\nThere are some 15 co-living companies \u2014 which offer furnished dormlike rentals for adults \u2014 currently operating in the city. Opting for a co-living situation eliminates some of the hassle involved in finding and renting an entire apartment or combing through the Craigslist \u201crooms and shares\u201d section: Most don\u2019t have strict income requirements or require guarantors (plus there are no brokers or additional fees), many come furnished, and some include perks like weekly cleanings, grocery basics, and Netflix and Hulu access. And you\u2019re not tied to a one- or two-year obligation: Some buildings offer 30-day-minimum stays, and many allow residents to move from property to property.\n\n\u27bd Outpost Club: Founded by a trio of Ukrainian expats; rooms go for $690 to $2,390; apartments come with keyless entry, Nest thermostats, twice-weekly cleanings, and household essentials (toilet paper, paper towels); houses operate in six locations across Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens.\n\n\u27bd Common: Nineteen spaces across New York (including in Williamsburg, Park Slope, Bedford-Stuyvesant, and Boerum Hill); bedrooms go for a minimum of $1,300 and include a nightstand, lamp, mattress, pillows, common-space cleanings, Wi-Fi, and pots and pans.\n\n\u27bd Tribe: Potentially the most \u201cco-\u201d of the co-living spaces: Each residence (where bedrooms start at $1,150 a month and include utilities, Wi-Fi, Netflix, Hulu, HBO, laundry detergent, and cleanings) has a house leader and weekly dinners.\n\n\u27bd Ollie: Residents of Ollie\u2019s Long Island City building (which includes 169 decorated and furnished 495-to-941-square-foot microsuites at $1,380 to $2,063 a month) have access to a gym, an indoor lap pool, lounges, barbecue areas, an event space, a co-working lounge, weekly housekeeping, towel and linen service, and Wi-Fi.\n\nOr Maybe Simply Apartment-Hunt When Jupiter Is in Your Fourth House\n\nIllustration: Nishant Choksi\n\n\u201cWhen my daughter graduated from college, she was going to share an apartment with three friends. When I went to go see the place, I was horrified \u2014 it was brand new, but the girls would\u2019ve been on top of each other. I didn\u2019t want to spoil it, but I said, \u2018Chrissie, you have Jupiter in the fourth house for the next year. You should be looking for a large, sunny apartment with a view and unusual closets. Because Jupiter expands everything it touches.\u2019 My daughter told me astrology doesn\u2019t work in Manhattan. Luckily, she didn\u2019t take it, and two months later, she found a duplex on the Lower East Side with an elevator, a large common room, a staircase that twirled up to the second floor, with huge views of lower Manhattan. All for the same money. You really have to go with what your chart says. When Jupiter is in your fourth house of home, you should look for property. Right now, Virgo has it, but on December 2, Libra will steal it and have it for a full year. Then after that, the Scorpios get lucky.\u201d \u2014Susan Miller, astrologer\n\n*This article appears in the September 16, 2019, issue of New York Magazine.
