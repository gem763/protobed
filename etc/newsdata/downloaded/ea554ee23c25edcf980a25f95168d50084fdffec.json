This misguided confidence is often driving investors to sit on the sidelines and wait it out for better market opportunities.\n\nLost chances by those who attempt to time the market is a common mistake among those who trade their own accounts. How many traders have lost investing opportunities by choosing to wait for the Consumer Staples stocks to correct or reach attractive entry levels? Only for them to continue to move higher and achieve new all-time highs: Adecoagro S.A. (AGRO), Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM), Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (BUD), New Age Beverage Corporation (NBEV), Inter Parfums, Inc. (IPAR)\n\nAnxiety and eagerness regularly lead investors into psychological traps because most investors take cues from past market moves and trends instead of attempting to anticipate potential market moves.\n\nProductive market timing requires three key parts: 1) A dependable sign for when to get in and out of stocks. 2) The ability to follow up on the sign rapidly and precisely. 3) The ability to be completely unemotional and trust in the signal no matter the current market environment.\n\nMany investors believe that market timing is a short-term investment strategy. There is a less known, more effective, longer-term market timing approach that has been used successfully by astute investors like Warren Buffet.\n\nRule 1: Never attempt and time tops and bottoms.\n\nSurrendering the objective to time the tops and bottoms gives you the adaptability to benefit and increase your odds to secure profits over the long-term, even if your calls aren't always right.\n\nRule 2: Don't sell during minor crashes - instead, have the patience to weather the storm, or even better, milk the opportunity to buy low.\n\nWarren Buffett has made his fortune based of this straightforward guideline. He benefits by focusing on the long - term and buying high quality stocks at a discount during large market corrections to profit down the road.\n\nThere is a noteworthy distinction between a complete market meltdown and a common 10% market correction. The theory is that if you like and bought a stock at a previous valuation prior to the correction, you should love the opportunity to this same at a steep discount since the underlying fundamentals are most likely still intact. Warren Buffett takes this idea one step further and often goes on a buying spree when markets turn, essentially buying additional shares of his top stock picks at a big discount and listening to his own advice, 'Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.'\n\nA Risk Adjusted Trading Strategy Should be Followed for Your Retirement Assets\n\nIt's only human that many succumb to greed and try and game the system by timing the market. But, think about this: Nobel Laureate William Sharpe found in 1975 that a market timer would need to be precise 74% of the time to beat a passive portfolio. Indeed, even a slight outperformance most likely wouldn't justify the efforts - and given that even the specialists for the most part come up short at it, market timing shouldn't be your exclusive methodology for investing, particularly when it comes to building your retirement nest egg.\n\nActively trading for alpha, outsized, short - term gains through market timing and other high - risk trading strategies is fine with a small portion of your investable assets, but for your longer - term retirement assets, a \"risk -adjusted focused\" investment solution generally makes more sense.\n\nIf you'd like to learn how to 'super-charge' your retirement assets, get our free report:\n\nWill You Retire as a Multi-Millionaire? 7 Things You Can Do Now.\n\nThis report can help you maximize your retirement nest-egg without the high risk of attempting to successfully time the markets.
