Sondland emphasized the importance that Ukraine deliver the investigations into the 2016 election, the Bidens and Burisma,\u201d he says, referring to a Ukraine energy company that Biden\u2019s son Hunter had been a director of.\n\n\u201cI stated to Amb. Sondland that his statements were inappropriate, that the request to investigate Biden and his son had nothing to do with national security,\u201d he says in the testimony.\n\nHe then reported his concerns to the chief attorney of the NSC.\n\nVindman also says that two other US officials who allegedly took part in pressuring Ukraine were in the Danylyuk meeting: Secretary of Energy Rick Perry and then-Special Representative for Ukraine Kurt Volker.\n\nTwo weeks later, Vindman says, he listened in on a phone call between Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nIn the call, Trump pushed Zelensky to open investigations into the 2016 conspiracy theory and also into the Bidens and Burisma, according to a summary released last month.\n\nAt the time, Trump had frozen military aid to Ukraine, allegedly to add pressure for the investigations.\n\n\u201cI was concerned by the call,\u201d Vindman writes in his planned testimony.\n\n\u201cI did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a US citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the US government\u2019s support of Ukraine.\n\n\u201cI realized that if Ukraine pursued an investigation into the Bidens and Burisma, it would likely be interpreted as a partisan play,\u201d he said, adding that he again reported his concerns to the NSC.\n\nVindman\u2019s prepared testimony expands upon the depositions of nine other US officials to the impeachment investigation, all of which have taken place behind closed doors.\n\nThe Trump administration has refused to turn over documents relating to the Ukraine issue and sought to prevent White House officials from testifying.\n\nBut Democrats appear to be amassing strong evidence against the president, which could lead to his impeachment in the House of Representatives, followed by his trial for removal in the Senate.\n\nOn Thursday, Democrats are planning to publicly lay out how the inquiry will go forward, with an eye to formally drawing up charges against Trump and holding an impeachment vote in the coming two months or so.", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 A White House official plans to tell Congress Tuesday that he witnessed efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate President", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/28/71029c_white-house-official-plans-congress-he-reported-as-national-security-risk-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
