Her mother, Janie King Norman, was an amateur pianist; her father, Silas Norman Sr., was an insurance broker. Jessye especially enjoyed visiting her maternal grandparents, fascinated by one particular piece of furniture.\n\n\u201cMy grandparents were the only people I ever knew who had one \u2014 a grand pedal organ, or more accurately, a harmonium \u2014 right there in their house,\u201d she wrote in her memoir. \u201cIt lived over in the corner of the front room, and I remember thinking that it was the most exotic thing I had ever encountered in my entire life. As far as I can recall, we were never stopped from playing it, nor admonished for disturbing the adults.\u201d\n\nShe began listening to opera on the radio as a child.\n\n\u201cI remember thinking that opera stories were not very different from other stories: a boy meets a girl, they fall in love, they cannot be together for some reason, and most of the time it does not end happily ever after,\u201d she wrote. \u201cFor me, opera stories were grown-up versions of stories that were familiar to me already.\u201d", "description": "A multiple Grammy Award winner, she was a towering figure on operatic, concert and recital stages.", "authors": ["Daniel J.
