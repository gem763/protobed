Before today, you had to rely on third-party apps like Twitchy if you wanted to watch Twitch on your Apple TV.\n\nIt looks a lot like browsing Twitch, but on a bigger screen. There\u2019s a \u201cHome\u201d tab that shows games and channels you follow, as well as a \u201cBrowse\u201d tab that has the classic grid of game and section icons organized by viewer count.\n\nWatching a stream also appears to look a lot like watching a stream in a browser \u2014 it seems you can even chat. Typing quickly on the Apple TV\u2019s cramped remote might be challenging, but hopefully you\u2019ll be able to use your iPhone\u2019s keyboard and drop some pogs in the chat.\n\nWatching Twitch on TV isn\u2019t exactly novel \u2014 you could already use an Amazon Fire TV device, an Xbox One, a PlayStation 4, or even just a computer hooked up to your TV to do so. But if the Apple TV is your main streaming box, the official Twitch app seems like it could be a more convenient option.", "description": "Twitch has released an Apple TV app. Before now, you had to rely on third-party apps like Twitchy to be able to watch Twitch from Apple\u2019s media box.", "authors": ["Jay Peters", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BRyIWwc_r7PtXqw9GkQ1yL2tMQw=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9289321/akrales_170919_1976_0018.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
