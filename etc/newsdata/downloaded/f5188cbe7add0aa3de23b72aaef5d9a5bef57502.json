Harris Met Artist Jordan Wolfson", "language": "en", "text": "Photo: Alex Casto. Courtesy David Zwirner.\n\nThis week, the second season of David Zwirner\u2019s podcast, Dialogues, premiered with a conversation between two provocateurs: the playwright, and budding fashion icon, Jeremy O. Harris, and the artist Jordan Wolfson. Hosted by Zwirner\u2019s son, Lucas Zwirner, the conversation is an estimable pairing of controversialists. Harris\u2019s Slave Play, a confrontational presentation of sex and plantation politics that was once a thesis project, is currently on Broadway, and he did work also on HBO\u2019s Euphoria. Wolfson is a Zwirner-signed artist most famous for his lurid animatronic sculptures. At the Whitney\u2019s 2017 biennial, his virtual-reality film Real Violence gave viewers an immersive taste of homicidal street rage. The venn diagram of interests between the pair would include a general preference for, let\u2019s say, unlikely transgressive subjects, like Pornhub\u2019s geographic data, being \u201cqueer for clout,\u201d emotional biohacking, and the sexual erotics embedded in the 1980 comedy Trading Places. Some excerpts:\n\nPorn is a portal\u2026to the world?\n\nJeremy O.Harris: I love watching porn for just like what\u2019s happening in the world. Like, what are people into? I love looking at the most popular videos in different regions. Going to Pornhub in Berlin compared to going to Pornhub in London is so radical. Pornhub in Berlin is a lot more violent, just naturally and casually violent. There\u2019s this weird French style of gay porn that \u2014 It\u2019s all these Middle Eastern men with huge dicks, just finding guys that are just wandering around the city, and then they just beat up these guys \u2014\n\nWolfson: They beat them up?\n\nHarris: Yes, and then, they fuck them.\n\nWolfson: Oh, we don\u2019t have that. We don\u2019t have that with girls. We don\u2019t beat them up.\n\nHarris: You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re missing. Sorry, dark! I think it also has to do with the fact that there\u2019s this deep eroticized fear of the Middle East in all of Europe, especially mainland Europe. But I think that they\u2019ve made an object of that fear, an object that they can fuck and an object that can validate that fear but also validates the erotic.\n\nRepresentation: the ultimate\u201cbio-hack\u201d\n\nWolfson: The gallery is a stage that the viewer gets to walk on to. And I thought about that when I was in Daddy. Here is this contrived event, completely contrived, fabricated event. We\u2019re watching it. There\u2019s a pool and a house, and we all believe it. We\u2019re all in it. I said, \u201cIsn\u2019t that fabulous?\u201d We can have that part of our human experience, that we can get hacked by narrative, hacked by form. I think that\u2019s an amazing part of the human experience, this idea of representation. How we are hacked by representation is really compelling.\n\nHarris: It\u2019s wild. I had this thing, where I was like, \u201cRepresentation doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d I hated people telling me that I had to like something just because there were black people in it. I feel more represented than I am loved in a weird way. I am Tilda Swinton eating the prawn. But then, I saw the Spider-Man movie, and I was literally hacked by that movie. [Laughs] And I was like, representation does matter! I didn\u2019t even want to admit it at the time.\n\nThe teenage erotics of the 1980s Dan Aykroyd comedy, Trading Places:\n\nWolfson: My go-to porn as a kid was Trading Places, the movie with Dan Aykroyd and Eddie Murphy. There is a scene with Jamie Lee Curtis, who plays a prostitute. There\u2019s this part where she changes in front of Dan Aykroyd. She gets naked and changes in front of him. And that was the most titillating thing for me and I watched it, and I would show it to all my other friends and it was sacred.\n\nHarris: The film that unlocked my erotics was The Dreamers, which I think is a lot of people\u2019s movie. Louis Garrel in that movie was the sexiest thing to me. There\u2019s a scene where they\u2019re talking about Maoism at [Jean-Luc Godard\u2019s] La Chinoise. There\u2019s a huge Mao poster and Louis Garrel and Michael Pitt are in these silk house robes. At one point Garrel grabs Pitt\u2019s throat, and then slowly slides over and he puts one leg over his leg and his crotch is touching his butt. I would rewind that over and over and over again. It was so hot, but it always sucks because Eva Green comes in, and she\u2019s like, \u201cBoys, what are you doing?\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cGod damn it. Why did she come in and ruin that?\u201d\n\nA story involving the actor Michael Pitt, rat poison, and a sushi dinner:\n\nWolfson: Whenever I hear about Mike Pitt, I just remember this weird traumatizing night with this middle-aged man who was peeing on himself. It was back when I was 19 or 20. We\u2019d hang out at the house of this 65-year-old guy named Joe Smith. We\u2019d go there and smoke pot in his loft on 20th street. Everything was maroon and all the windows were covered. There\u2019d be all of these young gay dudes messing around with Joe. He was really cool and once he lent me money to buy a video camera. But there was one kid that Joe had a relationship with who had begun to slip him rat poison to get more money from him. One night me and Mike Pitt had to take care of him. One night I called Mike to see what he was doing, and he\u2019s like, \u201cI\u2019m at Joe\u2019s house; he\u2019s dying.\u201d So, I had this super-awkward night eating sushi with Mike Pitt over there. I remember stuffing money into this dying man\u2019s pocket. I\u2019m like, \u201cJoe, I\u2019m paying you back for this camera.\u201d\n\nOn being \u201cgay-adjacent\u201d but not, of course, for clout\n\nHarris: Whenever I talk about you, people are like, \u201cHe\u2019s not gay, right? He feels gay.\u201d And I\u2019m always like, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nWolfson: I am a little actually gay.\n\nHarris: What is a little actually gay? Because everyone\u2019s queer for clout now.\n\nWolfson: I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s queer for clout. I have hooked up with guys. I have five good guys. But for the most part, I date women. I really, really love women in a way that I haven\u2019t had access to men at this point. I\u2019m open but women \u2014\n\nHarris: But gay adjacent.\n\nWolfson: Yeah, I would say so.\n\nThe struggles of working in an industry dominated by baby boomers:\n\nHarris: It\u2019s fucking annoying. I mean, I\u2019m really interested in being in a conversation with a 60 year old about my play, or an 80 year old about my play. But working in the theater, the thing that sucks is that baby boomers run the theater, not just in the audiences, but behind the scenes. And every other industry, I think the baby boomers are trying to actively kill us by just not being like, \u201cOkay, maybe let some new ideas come in.\u201d\n\nOn the very safe, virtue signaling response of critics to HBO\u2019s Euphoria:\n\nHarris: I\u2019ve been watching all the critics tiptoe around what their actual opinion is of the show, inside of the review. They were all giving non- reviews because I think they\u2019re waiting to see what the internet\u2019s going to say before they either championed it or not. They had the virtue signal. They were like, \u201cGuys I don\u2019t know if kids can take this.\u201d It\u2019s really scary. I\u2019m like, \u201cWere you never a teenager?\u201d Do you not remember all the dark shit you imagined, and all the dark shit you did, and all the dark shit and you hope to do? These kids are going to eat this up and then start glamorizing it. They\u2019re going to be excited that someone\u2019s representing part of their psyche \u2014 in some way, shape, or form. We\u2019re in this moment now where people are afraid to even make tepid steps toward transgression because there\u2019s so much fear that some phantom trouble will come following you.\n\nWolfson: There\u2019s so much fear. Everyone is holding onto the seat and the table at the same time. I always felt that transgression lead to transformation. Go to any young hero story. There\u2019s this point where the hero goes through a sort of transgressive situation to come out renewed, and that\u2019s the viewer. In a way, we\u2019re giving that to them, be it in the gallery or in the theater.", "description": "\u201cEveryone\u2019s queer for clout now.\u201d", "authors": ["Nathan Pemberton"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/26/26-wolfson-harris.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
