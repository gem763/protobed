His firm sued Tesla last year on behalf of a client who blames Tesla for his car crashing into a disabled vehicle.\n\n\u201cYou are still responsible for your car and must monitor it and its surroundings at all times and be within your line of sight because it may not detect all obstacles,\" Tesla said in instructions for the new feature.\n\nBut it may be too late to avoid a crash when a user attempts to stop the car, Morgan said.\n\n\"These vehicles provide a false sense of human control,\" Morgan said.\n\nReuters", "description": "If the accidents pile up, though, Tesla itself is sure to be brought into a legal fight, insurance industry experts said.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.6949%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_933%2C$y_622/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/a6aff6a6310fb10fe758e5ea3d5579389874a942", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
