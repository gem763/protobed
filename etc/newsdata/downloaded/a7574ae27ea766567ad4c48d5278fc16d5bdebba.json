This fall, NBC and CBS have three new Thursday night half-hour comedies that might be called Second Act TV, featuring popular stars launching new careers, romantic lives or both.\n\n\u201cCarol\u2019s Second Act\u201d (CBS) with Patricia Heaton (from \u201cEverybody Loves Raymond\u201d and \u201cThe Middle\u201d) deals with taking on a new career after your kids leave the nest, as well as life after divorce. \u201cPerfect Harmony\u201d (NBC) with Bradley Whitford (from \u201cThe West Wing\u201d and \u201cGet Out\u201d) finding something to give your life purpose after the loss of a spouse. And \u201cThe Unicorn\u201d (CBS) with Walton Goggins (from \u201cVice Principals\u201d and \u201cJustified\u201d), revolves around a widower dating for the first time in two decades while raising two adolescent daughters.\n\nHere\u2019s more about each show, what the critics have said about them and what Next Avenue says after watching the pilots:\n\n\u2018Carol\u2019s Second Act\u2019\n\nIn \u201cCarol\u2019s Second Act\u201d (Thursdays 9:30 ET/ 8:30 CT) television veteran Heaton, 61, plays Carol Kenney, a 50-year-old divorced mother who just retired from her job as a high school science teacher. Carol decides to bravely pursue her lifelong dream of becoming a doctor. Surrounded by peers 20 years her junior, she shows that it\u2019s never too late to go after your goals and that younger and older generations can learn from one another.\n\nHeaton and her real-life husband David Hunt are the show\u2019s producers; the creators are Emily Halpern and Sarah Haskins, two 20-somethings who recently wrote and produced the movie comedy \u201cBooksmart.\u201d Halpern told The Boston Herald, \u201cWe loved the idea of an older woman \u2026 somebody at a time in her life where she might traditionally be expected to retreat or to become less visible. And we thought, \u2018Let\u2019s put her center stage and put her in an environment where her age is actually her strength.\u2019\u201d\n\nHeaton has said she relates to Carol. Although happily married, the actress found herself unsure of her next act after \u201cThe Middle\u201d wrapped. She said: \u201cI was feeling a bit at sea not knowing what I was doing. I\u2019m no longer a full-time mom, and I didn\u2019t have a job as an actress and I very much felt the things that a person like Carol would feel.\u201d And, she told Parade, in the show, \u201cwe want to talk about the value of life experience\u2026 There\u2019s a calming that happens as you get older and you see how life is playing out.\u201d\n\nWhat the critics say: Reviews have been tepid; the show has a 54% Critic\u2019s Consensus score on the Rotten Tomatoes site. The New York Times said, \u201c\u2026(the) situations and characters, like the egotistic pretty-boy intern and the domineering but compassionate senior resident, are terminally familiar.\u201d And, that critic said, \u201cThere\u2019s also something retrograde, in the first two episodes, about the show\u2019s portrayal of Carol. The age jokes are a given, but they\u2019re accompanied by a tendency to celebrate her not for her medical ability but for the human touch that her age (and, implicitly, her gender) give her.\u201d\n\nWhat Next Avenue says: I agree with the Times critic. The writers are too focused on Carol\u2019s \u201cmotherly\u201d instincts making her a good doctor rather than the perseverance and determination a midlife woman needs to go to med school while taking care of her family. And the word \u201cold\u201d is thrown around far too often. But I love the idea of a woman taking on a challenging career in her second act. If Carol evolves into more of a strong, intelligent, \u201cgrown-up,\u201d the show could have potential.\n\n\u2018Perfect Harmony\u2019\n\nIn \u201cPerfect Harmony\u201d (Thursdays 8:30ET/7:30 CT), Whitford, 59, plays Arthur Cochran, a grumpy former Princeton University music professor forced into retirement after unspecified student complaints. Before the show starts, he has moved to Kentucky because his terminally ill wife Jean wanted to live her last few weeks where she grew up. After his wife dies, Arthur is left grieving both her and the loss of his identity-defining career. When we meet him, he\u2019s about to pop pills ending his life, unless his wife gives him a sign that he should go on.\n\nHe gets one. After too much to drink, Arthur walks into a church, passes out and awakens to members of its lousy choir asking him to be their musical director and prepare them for an upcoming competition. He reluctantly agrees.\n\nArthur is based on show creator Lesley Wake Webster\u2019s grandfather Arthur Wake, a choir director who found himself in rural Kentucky at the end of his own life. The pilot was written by John Hamburg, co-writer of \u201cMeet the Parents\u201d and \u201cZoolander.\u201d\n\nArthur\u2019s internal struggle will likely be believable to many people in their 50s or 60s wondering: How do you find meaning in your life when you\u2019re no longer someone\u2019s spouse or lost a job that defined your adult life? One way, the show suggests, is to use your honed talents and skills in another capacity \u2014 either a new job or through volunteering. Webster told Next Avenue: \u201cSome of my grandfather\u2019s happiest moments were directing a rural chorus, where he got to share his expertise and joy in music.\u201d\n\nAnother way older adults can find fulfillment, as \u201cPerfect Harmony\u201d shows, is by meeting and making connections with new people, especially ones who are younger. Says Webster: \u201cOlder people have skills and experience that you can\u2019t learn in a book or from a YouTube video. Bradley Whitford\u2019s character, Arthur, is an example of how an older person can give back to his community\u2026 and how an older person might benefit from the optimism of a younger person.\u201d\n\nWhat the critics say: Reviews of the pilot episode were mixed; the show has a 67% Critics\u2019 Consensus score on Rotten Tomatoes. Melissa Camacho of Common Sense Media liked it, saying, \u201cThe funny series offers lots of laughs thanks to a quirky but extremely likable ensemble cast. Granted, \u201cPerfect Harmony\u2018s\u201d formula isn\u2019t particularly original, but the writing is sharp and delivers consistently strong, edgy punchlines and some absurdly comical moments. Yet, it also manages to weave in a few sensitive bits, which makes it more appealing.\u201d But The Hollywood Reporter\u2019s Daniel Fienberg was less impressed, saying, \u201cThe bigger story has nowhere to go after the pilot, Arthur\u2019s story has only backsliding (into being a curmudgeon.)\u201d\n\nWhat Next Avenue says: While the show is a comedy, it\u2019s dealing with a serious problem. As the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention notes, middle-age white men represent the highest rate of suicide. I just wish the show handled midlife depression more seriously.\n\n\u2018The Unicorn\u2019\n\nIn \u201cThe Unicorn\u201d (Thursdays 8:30 ET/7:30 CT), Goggins, 47, plays Wade Felton, a widowed father of two adolescent daughters. When viewers meet Wade, he has been grieving his late wife for over a year and feeding his family frozen casseroles made by well-meaning neighbors. After encouragement by friends to start dating again, he grudgingly agrees and creates an online profile. To his surprise, he\u2019s a popular \u201cswipe right\u201d on dating sites. His friends attribute the popularity to Wade\u2019s \u201cunicorn\u201d status: he is a nice, single, family guy and not a married cheater, an elusive combination in the world of midlife dating. (That\u2019s also the theme of the new best-selling novel, \u201cFleishman Is In Trouble.\u201d)\n\n\u201cThe Unicorn\u2019s\u201d plot is based in part on producer Grady Cooper\u2019s own experience. After 20 years of marriage, Cooper\u2019s wife Jane died when his daughters were tweens. Cooper told Next Avenue, \u201cThe hardest part about moving on after being widowed is survivor\u2019s guilt. As the survivor, you want to honor the marriage or relationship you had, but you have to realize that a new relationship can be exciting.\u201d\n\nAlthough becoming a widower or a widow may not seem like an ideal jumping point for a sitcom, Cooper found laughter to be helpful tool in his healing process and plays it up in the show. He says, \u201cI see life as a series of comedic events peppered with sad moments. I try and not dwell on the sadness. It\u2019s not to say that I don\u2019t miss my wife, but the past is the past and if you don\u2019t move forward, one is stuck.\u201d\n\nLike Wade, Cooper found it hard to fit into the dating world after being married for decades. He says, \u201cMy wife\u2019s illness was over a five-year period, so it was a long process, and I dated shortly after her death. It was probably too soon, but I wanted some companionship and wanted to feel normal again.\u201d\n\nThe bright side of Cooper\u2019s awkward re-entry into dating is that it gave him plenty of material for \u201cThe Unicorn.\u201d \u201cI went on many first dates. In fact, some dates, I knew from the start were not going to be great. But I was interested in meeting new people,\u201d he says. \u201cThe result was that we laughed at how awkward it was, and some of my first dates are still friends.\u201d\n\nCooper\u2019s advice to new widowers and widows: take it slow. \u201cGive yourself time to grieve and heal. But also, be social. Don\u2019t isolate yourself. Eventually, start to decide what you want your new life to be,\u201d he says.\n\nAnd his advice to well-meaning friends who want to offer support: \u201cMany widows and widowers exist in a fog for a long time. Check on them daily. Listen. Don\u2019t judge.\u201d\n\nWhile all help is appreciated, Cooper says, \u201cBring healthy meals. Comfort food can make you fat, and I had to exercise quite a bit after all the wonderful meals our friends gave us.\u201d\n\nWhat the critics say: Reviews for \u201cThe Unicorn\u201d have been mostly positive; the show has an impressive 94% Critic\u2019s Consensus score on Rotten Tomatoes. Daniel D\u2019Addario of Variety says of Goggins, \u201cHis tentative steps past the first days of parenting alone are made with a certain optimism that\u2019s appealing. The performance anchors what is in its first episodes a thoughtful and sophisticated sitcom about what follows mourning \u2014 in other words, the rest of life.\u201d\n\nWhat Next Avenue says: Goggins, his TV daughters and the supporting cast are believable, as they face a difficult situation with sincerity, hope and humor. I found the pilot enjoyable and am curious to see how the show develops.", "description": "Three new Thursday night half-hour comedies feature midlife characters launching new careers and romantic lives.", "authors": ["Randi Mazzella"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS590_na_tvs_MG_20191003115049.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
