You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThis has left them unable to work, driving some into exploitation as a means of survival. Others have been detained in immigration centres for weeks and then released because there was no prospect of removing them, at a cost of \u00a385.97 per person per day in detention.\n\nAt least two people have been deported to Malaysia and then immediately returned to the UK because authorities refused them entry.\n\nA spokesperson for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said that in cases where someone is stateless but may be able to reacquire their former nationality, the UK government should provide them with some form of immigration status to allow them to remain there while making arrangements to move.\n\nYan Kit, 42, who has been stateless since 2005, said he was desperate to return to Malaysia to reunite with his wife, but that he was \u201cstuck\u201d in the UK, unable to work and having to report to the Home Office every month.\n\nHe said: \u201cI\u2019m not allowed to work. I just sit at home. The worst thing is every month I have to go and report with the UK border agency, but it means nothing because they can\u2019t deport me. If I ask questions, they can\u2019t tell me what\u2019s happening. They just give me the date for my next report time.\u201d\n\nThe issue arose when a large number of Malaysian citizens in the UK received misleading immigration advice saying that if they obtained a British overseas citizens (BOC) passport \u2013 a relic from the UK\u2019s colonial past \u2013 and renounced their Malaysian citizenship, they would be eligible to become British citizens.\n\nThis had previously been the case, but a change to immigration law in 2002 toughened the rules by adding the requirement that they must not have voluntarily renounced another citizenship \u2013 making these people ineligible.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

But there\u2019s red tape.\u201d\n\nAlvyn Kee, partner at Bloomsbury Law Solicitors, who said he had dealt with between 200 and 300 cases like this, accused the Home Office of treating these individuals as \u201cnumbers, not human beings\u201d, and said there were likely to be between 1,000 and 2,000 cases.\n\nHe said he knew of one person affected by the issue, a stateless woman in her twenties, who had died of alcohol consumption several years ago after she turned to drinking because of the stress caused by the problem.\n\n\u201cThese people have been left in limbo. The Home Office is saying this is not our problem, but it\u2019s the Malaysian point of view that they\u2019re viewed as traitors. The UK has become a prison to them,\u201d Mr Kee said.\n\n\u201cThey aren\u2019t allowed to but they need to earn money to survive. So they\u2019re being exploited, often doing restaurant work. You get raided by immigration officers. Sometimes they try to deport them. They are continuously subject to the hostile environment.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
