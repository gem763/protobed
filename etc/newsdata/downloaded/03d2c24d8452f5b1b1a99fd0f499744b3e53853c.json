It\u2019s a lot,\u201d Woods said. \u201cI\u2019ve been able to be consistent most of my career. \u2026 Today was one of those days where I was able to pull it out.\u201d\n\nWoods had arthroscopic surgery on his left knee two months ago - his fifth on the same problem joint. He was making his first start in his 23rd season on the PGA Tour.\n\n\u201cI can still manage my way around the golf course,\u201d Woods said. \u201cI know how to play. I was able to do that this week.\u201d\n\nThe fourth round was suspended because of darkness Sunday, and Woods took a three-stroke lead over Matsuyama into Monday in the first official PGA Tour event in Japan.\n\nHe bogeyed his first hole of the day, the par-4 12th, but was solid the rest of the way with birdies on Nos. 14 and 18 to finish at 19-under 261. Matsuyama also closed with a 67\n\nRory McIlroy, the highest ranked player in the field, completed his round with two birdies for a 67 to tie for third at 13 under with Sungjae Im. Im had a 65.\n\nWoods opened with consecutive 64s, with a day off in between because of rain. He had a 66 on Sunday in the third round.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a long week,\u201d Woods said. \u201cFive days at the top of the leaderboard is a long time.\u201d\n\nAs the U.S. Presidents Cup captain, Woods was asked about picking himself for the team.\n\n\u201cI think the player got the captain\u2019s attention,\u201d Woods said.\n\nWoods\u2018 approach shot on the 12th found the greenside bunker. He blasted out and left himself a long par putt that he missed for bogey, cutting the lead to two strokes.\n\nBut that was the only time he would falter.\n\nMatsuyama missed a short birdie putt on the par-5 14th with a chance to cut the lead to a stroke. Moments later, Woods made a birdie putt on 14 to restore the three-stroke lead.\n\nMatsuyama cut the lead to two with a birdie on par-3 16th. On 18, his drive went into the bunker at the side of the fairway, and he hit into the greenside bunker before saving par.\n\nWoods\u2018 approach at the par-5 18th found the greenside bunker. He blasted to 10 feet and made the birdie putt.\n\nWoods last played in an official tournament in Japan in 2006 at the Dunlop Phoenix, where he lost in a playoff to Padraig Harrington. He won the Dunlop Phoenix the two previous years\n\n___\n\nMore AP golf: https://apnews.com/apf-Golf and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Tiger Woods shrugged off an early bogey Monday to win the Zozo Championship and tie Sam Snead's PGA Tour record of 82 victories.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jim Armstrong"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/27/japan_golf_zozo_championship_02914_c0-97-2500-1555_s1200x700.jpg?65451ba0a6f5425720e7b4ace6f02c5c53414206", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
