She had just gotten out of the shower and was patting her face dry with a towel when she claims she felt her eye \u201cpop\u201d before experiencing blurry vision and a sudden rush of immense pain \u2014 so much so that she feared her eye had fallen out of her socket, she told South West News Service (SWNS), a British news agency.\n\nMAN FINDS SPIDER IN HIS EAR AFTER FEELING 'TICKLING,' HEARING 'SCRATCHING'\n\nWhen she looked in the mirror, her eye appeared red and sore, but there was no blood. The blurry vision and pain, however, led her to seek medical attention at a local hospital.\n\nThere, doctors reportedly told the woman she had perforated her cornea and encouraged her to return home to the U.K. as soon as possible.\n\n\"I just couldn't understand how my life had come to this or where to go from here,\u201d she recalled.\n\nHours later, the pair was on a flight home. Willis bandaged her affected eye while traveling, she said.\n\nSoon after they landed, Willis sought treatment at Royal Stoke University Hospital in Staffordshire. During the flight, her eye became infected and fused shut.\n\nDoctors were forced to pry her eyelids open to look at her eye, which had reportedly turned yellow.\n\nShe spent the next several days at the hospital fighting the infection. But it was too late: Doctors informed the woman that her part of her right eye needed to be removed \u2014 news that \u201cdevastated\u201d her, she told SWNS.\n\nWillis\u2019s retina and cornea were removed and she was fitted with a cosmetic shell over the lens of her right eye, she said.\n\nWASHINGTON GIRL CELEBRATES RECOVERY WITH \u2018WONDER WOMAN\u2019 PHOTOSHOOT AFTER NEARLY LOSING SIGHT IN ONE EYE\n\nCorneal perforation is often caused by \u201cprogressive corneal thinning due to ectatic degeneration, Terrien's degeneration, infections, or immune-related diseases such as in Mooren's ulcer and rheumatoid disease,\u201d according to Columbia University\u2019s Department of Ophthalmology. Other causes include trauma and \u201cIatrogenic during ocular surgery, such as astigmatic or radial keratotomy,\u201d per the university.\n\nAn ophthalmologist from Royal Stoke University Hospital who treated her said Willis had a \u201cthinner than normal cornea\u201d which led to the perforation, SWNS reported.\n\nRoughly a week later, Willis removed the bandages covering her right eye. She was shocked by her appearance, she said.\n\n\u201cI looked like an extra from \u2018The Walking Dead,\u2019\u201d she said, referring to the zombie-filled AMC series.\n\n\"My eye isn't ready yet to have a prosthetic fitted, so I just have to wait and stay looking like this until my socket has recovered enough, but I don't know when that will be,\u201d she added.\n\nWillis, a mom of two, said her family has been extremely supportive of her and noted she\u2019s trying her best to stay positive.\n\nMAN'S MASSIVE BRAIN TUMOR DISCOVERED AFTER HE HAD TROUBLE SEEING THE TV: 'I JUST THOUGHT I NEEDED GLASSES'\n\n\"I had to learn alone how to cope with a half amputated eye \u2014 it was sticky on the lids and I was scared to clean it in case I knocked the cosmetic shell out,\u201d she said, noting she doesn\u2019t hide her affected eye.\n\n\"I fought my demons,\u201d she added. \u201cEveryday, I pushed myself to go out. And slowly but surely, I started feeling more confident.\"", "description": "A 45-year-old United Kingdom woman lost part of her right eye after perforating her cornea while drying her face with a towel, she claims.", "authors": ["Madeline Farber", "Madeline Farber Is A Reporter For Fox News.
