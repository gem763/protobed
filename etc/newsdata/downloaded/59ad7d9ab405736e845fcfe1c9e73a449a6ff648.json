Mandatory Credit: Reinhold Matay-USA TODAY Sports\n\nCiting two opposing team executives, Yahoo Sports reports that Khan is not only insisting on a price tag of two \u201cquality\u201d first-round picks but also would rather keep Ramsey and sign him to a long-term extension. The report adds that Khan is setting the bar for a deal but is not involved directly in negotiations with other teams, frustrating potential suitors.\n\n\u201cThe idea that nothing has changed [in the trade dynamic] is wrong,\u201d Yahoo quoted one executive as saying. \u201cOwnership is obviously involved and a hurdle to overcome.\u201d\n\nAmong the teams that remain interested in Ramsey are the Seattle Seahawks, Kansas City Chiefs, Philadelphia Eagles, Oakland Raiders and Baltimore Ravens, according to the report.\n\nNot long after Ramsey\u2019s trade demand entering Week 3, most believed the cornerback could be had for a package involving first- and second-round picks, with a deal possible as soon as Sept. 20.\n\nRamsey played in the Jaguars\u2019 Thursday night game on Sept. 19, then missed practices this week due to an illness, a back injury and the birth of his daughter. He did not play in Sunday\u2019s 26-24 victory over the Denver Broncos, the first game he\u2019s missed in his career.\n\nThe 24-year-old reiterated his trade request this week during an appearance on Uninterrupted\u2019s \u201c17 Weeks\u201d podcast on Sirius XM.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ve played my final game for the Jags yet or not, but my trade request still stands. For me, respect is a huge thing,\u201d Ramsey said. \u201cI kinda touched on it a little bit last week in last week\u2019s podcast, but once respect is lost for both parties, I think it is time to part ways.\u201d\n\nRamsey has 17 tackles and one forced fumble in three games this season. He has nine interceptions and 45 passes defensed in his career.\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "Jacksonville Jaguars owner Shad Khan is the main hurdle standing in the way of a trade involving All-Pro cornerback Jalen Ramsey, Yahoo Sports reported Sunday evening.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190930&t=2&i=1435400115&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8T07N-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
