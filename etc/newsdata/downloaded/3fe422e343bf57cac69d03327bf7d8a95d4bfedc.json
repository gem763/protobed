REUTERS/Alexandre Meneghini\n\nBut support from two of its closest allies looks unlikely to resolve Cuba\u2019s energy problems and the government has extended many of the energy-saving measures it had introduced over the past month.\n\nHavana warned on Sept. 11 it had not secured sufficient shipments of refined fuels, like gasoline and diesel, for the rest of the month due to sanctions imposed by the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump in retaliation for its support for Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.\n\nIn response to the shortages, Cuba swiftly deepened austerity measures it had introduced since an economic meltdown in Venezuela, its principal supplier, choked off its energy imports.\n\nCuban authorities cut public transport last month, decreased production at some factories, and encouraged the use of more animal-powered vehicles and wood-fired ovens.\n\nVenezuela responded by increasing oil shipments to its Caribbean ally, despite its own output issues and sanctions-related restrictions.\n\nSince late September, at least eight tankers carrying some 3.83 million barrels of crude and fuel have been shipped from Venezuela, according to Refinitiv Eikon data and internal data from Venezuela\u2019s state-run oil firm PDVSA. That represents a sharp increase from five vessels loaded with 1.98 million barrels during the first half of September.\n\nFollowing the shipments, there are no longer multi-hour queues at Cuban gas stations for gasoline, although diesel remains elusive.\n\nTransport officials on Wednesday said they would be upping the frequency of train and bus departures, although not yet restoring \u201cnormality\u201d following the drastic cuts last month.\n\nPresident Miguel Diaz-Canel celebrated that Cuba managed to avoid blackouts in September in an editorial in the Communist Party newspaper Granma entitled \u201cNo fear of the current juncture.\u201d\n\nThe two-day official visit of Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, which concluded on Friday, also sent a signal the island is not alone.\n\nMedvedev on Friday visited the island\u2019s first horizontal oil well. Located in Boca de Jaruco in northern Cuba, it is being built by Russian and Cuban state-run companies.\n\nThe two countries are working towards reducing Cuba\u2019s dependence on energy imports by improving its energy efficiency and collaborating on oil exploration, a senior Russian government official told TASS news agency.\n\nHowever, Medvedev did not announce any short-term measures to provide relief to the island during his visit.\n\nMORE SHORTAGES LIKELY\n\nCuba\u2019s oil production currently meets an estimated 40 percent of its needs. Nearly all the rest has been supplied by Venezuela for years under a barter agreement for Cuban medical services, with some imports from other allies like Algeria and Russia.\n\nHowever, analysts say Venezuela and Cuba will struggle to keep beating ever-tightening U.S. sanctions.\n\nTo supply Cuba in recent days, PDVSA used a portion of an old fleet that had not left Venezuelan waters for years, likely due to difficulty leasing tankers from vessel operators.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s getting tougher and tougher,\u201d said Francisco Monaldi, a Latin American energy expert at Rice University\u2019s Baker Institute. He said many companies in the industry were steering clear of any business with Venezuela in the wake of the sanctions.\n\nSome analysts say one objective of Medvedev\u2019s visit was likely to discuss helping Cuba out of its energy crisis, perhaps in conjunction with Venezuela.\n\nThere has been a flurry of visits between high-level Russian, Venezuelan and Cuban officials of late. Most recently, Venezuela\u2019s Executive Vice President Delcy Rodriguez was in Moscow and then Havana.\n\n\u201cBut the degree to which Russia can provide that is questionable given their own economic situation,\u201d said Jason Marczak, Director at the Adrienne Arsht Latin America Center.\n\nTASS said Russian supplies of oil products to Cuba grew almost four-fold in the first half, citing the Russian government. It did not provide details, nor did it give shipment volumes for the second half, during which the Trump administration has upped the pressure.\n\nCubans, meanwhile, are struggling.\n\nNiuris Higueras, owner of Havana restaurant Atelier, said authorities met a group of private business owners to ask them to slash their electricity usage by as much as half.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve mostly stopped using air conditioning and the electric oven,\u201d she said.\n\nSlideshow (8 Images)\n\nState offices are turning off electricity for several hours at midday. With the computers off, employees turn to paperwork or leave the office to escape the Caribbean heat.\n\nSome state workers who were told to stay home without a cut in salary have not yet been recalled, while some Havana cinemas have only one screening a day instead of two or three.\n\n\u201cThey ended the comedy shows at night due to the oil problems,\u201d said Yolanda Santana, a cleaner at the modernist Yara cinema. \u201cI\u2019ve no clue when the situation could improve.\u201d", "description": "A flotilla of shipments from Venezuela gave Cuba some respite this week from crippling fuel shortages in the wake of tougher U.S. sanctions, while Russia's prime minister pledged during a visit to the island on Friday to help develop its energy sector.", "authors": ["Sarah Marsh", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191004&t=2&i=1437189011&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF931QC", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
