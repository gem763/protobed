Second fun fact: Claire Foy, who played Queen Elizabeth for two seasons on The Crown, also has that same shade of sky. Last fun fact: Olivia Colman, who\u2019s now playing Queen Elizabeth on the show, is not a member of the Blue Eyes Club, in favor of having a deep-brown hue all over her irises. Such a small detail, while perhaps unnoticeable to an average viewer when the third season premieres in November, provided a major headache for the show\u2019s creative team when Colman began filming a year ago \u2014 and according to a new profile in The Guardian, the drastic measures taken to turn her eyes blue were met with astounding failures.\n\nFirst, Colman was fitted with blue contact lenses for the first four episodes, but it made her seem like \u201cshe was acting behind a mask,\u201d director Ben Caron explained. \u201cIt was as if we had taken all of her acting ability,\u201d he added, \u201cand put it in a safe and locked it away.\u201d Next, they tested turning her eyes blue in post-production with the help of visual effects. \u201cBut it didn\u2019t feel like her,\u201d Caron said. \u201cCGI-ing her eyes seemed to diminish what she was doing.\u201d With all feasible options exercised, the creative team realized they would be able to accept a small continuity error to accompany Colman\u2019s exemplary performance. \u201cWe always thought it should be Olivia, right from the beginning,\u201d the show\u2019s casting director, Nina Gold, admitted. Well, she is British royalty, even if we\u2019re only talking about her acting work.", "description": "Olivia Colman\u2019s eyes for the Crown\u2019s third season on Netflix will be a continuity error, as her eyes are brown as opposed to blue.", "authors": ["Devon Ivie"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2018/07/16/16-the-crown-season-3.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
