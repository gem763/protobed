They include several prominent committee chairs and freshman Democrats from formerly GOP-held congressional districts that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was trying to shield from impeachment pressure if it would make them vulnerable when facing reelection.\n\nABC News has been tracking the growing number of lawmakers calling for an impeachment probe.
