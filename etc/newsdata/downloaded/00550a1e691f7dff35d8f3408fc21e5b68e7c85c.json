However he is expected to deny the testosterone was purchased for a rider - and instead maintain that it was for a member of staff, who he insists needed it for medical reasons. If Freeman loses the case, which has been brought by the General Medical Council, he faces losing his doctor\u2019s licence.\n\nMuch of the discussion on Tuesday morning centred on the charge that Freeman ordered the gel to be given to an athlete. Simon Jackson QC, for the General Medical Council said: \u201cYour motive was to obtain testosterone to give to an athlete to improve an athlete\u2019s performance.\u201d\n\nHowever, Miss O\u2019Rourke responded: \u201cThe burden is on the GMC to prove the motive they attribute. The GMC aren\u2019t going to believe whatever he says, they are bent on saying it was doping.\u201d\n\nMiss O\u2019Rourke said the only GMC witness she required to cross examine was the former Team Sky coach Shane Sutton, who was also personal coach to Sir Bradley Wiggins. The GMC will call on an expert endocrinologist and will say that the member of staff had no need for the substance.\n\nThe hearing, before Chair Neil Dalton, is expected to formally open later on Tuesday and is scheduled to run until 20 December.", "description": "The former British Cycling and Team Sky doctor Richard Freeman will admit to telling \u2018a lot of lies\u2019 and ordering the banned supplement testosterone, an independent medical tribunal has heard", "authors": ["Sean Ingle"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d5614979453aa415e07c58c483d78d354a468039/0_376_3456_2074/master/3456.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c4d93ec7b4ee96087f8eda7e57e02abc", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
