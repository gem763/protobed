(Image: Copernicus/Sentinel/Scripps)\n\nA huge iceberg weighing upwards of 350 billion tons has broken off the Amery Ice Shelf in Antarctica.\n\nAFP reports the calving event happened at some point between September 24 and 25, as evidenced by U.S. and European satellite images. Dubbed D28, the gigantic chunk of ice measures 1,636 square kilometres in total area, according to Scripps Institution of Oceanography. That\u2019s roughly half the size of Rhode Island or 22 times the size of Manhattan. The iceberg measures around 210 meters thick and weighs around 350 billion tons.\n\nThe iceberg calved from Antarctica\u2019s Amery Ice Shelf, the third largest floating platform of ice on the frozen continent. This particular ice shelf hasn\u2019t produced a \u2018berg like this since the 1960s, when it calved an absolutely gigantic iceberg measuring 9,000 square kilometres in size, according to the BBC.\n\nD28 is now slowly drifting westwards as it\u2019s pushed by ocean currents and winds. It could take years for the iceberg to completely break apart and dissolve into the ocean. Accordingly, D28 is being closely watched by satellite as it poses a potential threat to ships passing by the area.\n\nMap of Antarctica showing the location of the Amery Ice Shelf.

The Amery Ice Shelf serves as an important drainage channel for the eastern portion of Antarctica. Over time, glaciers flow from the land and into the sea, forming the floating ice shelf.\n\nEventually, the build-up of all this snow and ice causes large chunks to fall into the sea, in what is a completely normal and recurring geological process. The Amery Ice Shelf calves about every 60 to 70 years, according to the Scripps Institute, and this latest event \u2014 which was predicted \u2014 has not been linked to climate change.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really important that the public doesn\u2019t get confused and think that this is climate change,\u201d Scripps glaciologist Amanda Fricker told AFP. To which she added in a Scripps tweet: \u201cThis event is part of the ice shelf\u2019s normal cycle though and, while there is much to be concerned about in Antarctica, there is no cause for alarm yet for this particular ice shelf.\u201d\n\nFricker says this calving event underscores the importance of long-term observations in Antarctica to understand the natural cycle of ice sheets, so that scientists may better disentangle climate change-induced events from the natural \"background\" cycle. \u2014 Scripps Institution of Oceanography (@Scripps_Ocean) October 1, 2019\n\nThat said, this particular calving event caught Scripps scientists a bit off guard, as they were expecting another portion of the Amery Ice Shelf \u2014 a region aptly nicknamed the \u201cloose tooth\u201d \u2014 to break off. So while scientists knew a calving event was imminent, they had pinpointed the wrong section.\n\nIn addition to watching the progress of D28, scientists will also monitor the Amery Ice Shelf itself to see how the loss of such a gigantic section might affect its stability.\n\nEast Antarctica is home to some of the continent\u2019s most stable ice. While research published earlier this year shows it is losing ice and has made measurable contributions to sea level rise, the remoteness of the region means scientists are still learning more about it each year.\n\nAs big as D28 is, it\u2019s not the biggest to calve from Antarctica in recent years. In 2017, the Larsen C Ice Shelf shed an iceberg, dubbed A68, that measured 5,800 square kilometers in total area. Famously, A68 produced a smaller iceberg in 2018 that was weirdly geometrical in shape\u2014an eye-grabbing structure known as a tabular iceberg.", "description": "A huge iceberg weighing upwards of 350 billion tons has broken off the Amery Ice Shelf in Antarctica....", "authors": ["Tegan Jones", "David Tracy"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/tjndwocauugxbqf3s8bp.jpg"}
