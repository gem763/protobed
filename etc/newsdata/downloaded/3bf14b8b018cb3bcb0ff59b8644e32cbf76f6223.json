Katie Hill paid female lover thousands of dollars in consulting fees", "language": "en", "text": "California Democratic Rep. Katie Hill was still paying consulting fees to her campaign staffer and former lover Morgan Desjardins, 24, as recently as last month.\n\nAccording to FEC Records, since April 2019, Hill's campaign has paid a little over $14,000 in fundraising-related consulting fees to Desjardins, doling out around $2,500 most months. Additionally, between 2017 and 2018, she made around $50,000 as a senior campaign staffer.\n\nHill, who is facing a House Ethics Committee investigation over allegations she had an intimate relationship with her legislative director, Graham Kelly, found herself under scrutiny after a nude photo of her brushing Desjardin\u2019s hair was posted on the RedState.\n\nHill, 32, has admitted her relationship with Desjardins during her successful campaign for a House seat based in northern Los Angeles County but disputed any inappropriate relationship between her and Kelly occurred.\n\nThe image was posted along with text messages sent between Hill, the congresswoman's estranged husband Kenny Heslep, whom she is divorcing, and Desjardins. According to the texts posted at RedState, the trio had an intimate three-way relationship during Hill\u2019s first campaign for office, but it soured quickly after she won her race and went to Washington, D.C.\n\n\u201cI am still in love with her,\u201d Hill texted Heslep. \u201cIt rips my heart out every time I have to see her or have someone say something nice about her.\u201d\n\nDesjardins can be seen in a Vice News Tonight/ HBO film with Hill and other campaign staffers calling donors and asking for contributions to Hill\u2019s first campaign.", "description": "California Democratic Rep.
