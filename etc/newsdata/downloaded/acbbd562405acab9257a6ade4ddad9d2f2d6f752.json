Both Prince Harry and Ed Sheeran want to ensure that not just today but every day, you look after yourself, your friends and those around you.'\n\nPrince Harry, 35, and Ed Sheeran, 28, have teamed up in a video in aid of Mental Health Day today (pictured)\n\nThe singer (left) jokes that nobody understands what it's like for 'people like us' - referring to the fact he and the royal (right) are both red-headed\n\nIt continues: 'There\u2019s no need to suffer in silence - share how you\u2019re feeling, ask how someone is doing and listen for the answer. Be willing to ask for help when you need it and know that we are all in this together.'\n\nThe video, which has already received 380k views, begins by showing Ed getting his beard trimmed in a barbers ahead of his visit to see the royal.\n\n'Really excited today,' he says. 'Going to film with Prince Harry who contacted me about doing a charity idea with him, which is going to be good. I\u2019ve long admired him\u2026from afar. I guess I'll see you there!'\n\nIt then cuts to the world-famous singer knocking on a front door with a simple white frame door featuring glass panelling.\n\nIn an amusing side note, the door bell rings a chime playing the 'God Save The Queen' National Anthem before Harry opens the door to the singer.\n\nThe clip begins by showing Ed getting his beard trimmed in a barbers ahead of his visit to see the royal, who he says he has 'long-admired'\n\nEd explains: 'Really excited today. Going to film with Prince Harry who contacted me about doing a charity idea with him, which is going to be good'\n\nThe world-famous singer knocks on a front door with a simple white frame door featuring glass panelling - before Prince Harry answers (pictured)\n\nThe royal jokes: 'It's like looking in the mirror', as both red-headed men stare at each other, dressed in matching grey polo necks.\n\nThe Shape of You hit singer replies: 'Do you mind if I bring the cameras in?', to which Harry responds: 'Of course, come on in'.\n\nPrince Harry then thanks Ed for coming along and explains: 'For me, this is a subject of a conversation that\u2019s not talked about enough. I think people all over the world are really suffering.'\n\nIn agreement, Ed reveals he's actually been trying to write a song about it to try and get the message out to people, to which Prince Harry responds:\n\n'Someone with your skill-set, to be able to write lyrics of a song to raise awareness would be amazing.'\n\nBut while the royal is referring to World Mental Health Day, in a comic turn of events, Ed Sheeran jokes: 'That's exactly what I\u2019m trying to do \u2013 people don't understand what it\u2019s like for people like us.'\n\nThe Duke of Sussex passionately explains how mental health is a 'subject of a conversation that's not talked about enough'\n\nPrince Harry goes on to say how 'people all over the world are really suffering,' to which Ed agrees and begins typing on his laptop\n\nThe Shape Of You singer then reveals he's been trying to write a song about the topic to try and get it out to people. Pictured, with the royal\n\nHowever, clearly getting the wrong end of the stick as he begins to type 'gingers unite', Ed jokes: 'People don't understand what it\u2019s like for people like us'\n\n'With the jokes and the snide comments. I just feel like it's time we stood up and said: \"We're not going to take this any more. We\u2019re ginger \u2013 and we\u2019re going to fight.\"'\n\nA rather confused-looking Prince Harry says 'slightly awkward,' before explaining: 'This may be miscommunication, but this is about World Mental Health Day.'\n\n'No no, I definitely knew that,' replies the singer, as he can be seen deleting the words \"ginger's unite\" from a PowerPoint presentation he has started on his laptop.\n\nHowever, as the video draws to an end, Prince Harry, who can be sitting on a sofa with Ed, gets serious and says: 'Guys, this Mental Health Day, reach out, make sure your friends, strangers - lookout for anyone who may suffer in silence. We're all in this together.'\n\nYesterday, the royal teased the surprise project on Instagram, which showed a glimpse inside the modest home.", "description": "Prince Harry, 35, and Ed Sheeran, 28, have teamed up for a video for World Mental Health Day.
