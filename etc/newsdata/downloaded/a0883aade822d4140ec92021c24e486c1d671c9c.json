Its name comes from the idea at the heart of the commune: no electricity, no plugs.\n\nWith South Korea among the highest carbon dioxide emitters globally, NoPlug hopes their community can make an impact by reducing their carbon footprint. Although it\u2019s not possible to be entirely emission free, the idea is to put electricity consumption at zero, and try to keep any energy generation from sustainable sources. Their living situation is a very different take on what it means to have a functional home; foregoing electricity, they rely on fuel sources such as solar and fire to do daily tasks (and even run a power-free coffee shop that\u2019s open from dawn until dusk).\n\nDr Yasuyuki Fujimura, visits the NoPlug community from Japan each month to educate people on how to approach every day needs without electricity and appliances. \u201cI want to give a dream to young people who are now losing their hope,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s our duty.\u201d", "description": "A commune in the heart of Seoul is living without electricity \u2013 and even running a no-power coffee shop.", "authors": ["Komeil Soheili"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/624_351/images/live/p0/7m/nc/p07mnckb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
