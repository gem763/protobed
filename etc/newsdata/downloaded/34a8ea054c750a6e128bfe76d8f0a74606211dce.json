He must register as a sex offender.\n\nBjerke was one of the first offenders identified in Virginia using forensic genealogy, an increasingly common technique for solving cold cases where police have little evidence beyond DNA. Bjerke had no criminal history, and so his DNA was in no law enforcement database. But sperm left at the crime scene matched with relatives of Bjerke who had uploaded their genetic information to public genealogy databases.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAfter the plea, Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney Bryan Porter praised the \u201coutstanding use of technology.\u201d\n\n\u201cWithout genetic genealogy in this case, a violent rapist would not have been identified,\u201d he said.\n\nAttorneys tried to suppress the DNA evidence as an invasion of Bjerke\u2019s privacy. As part of the agreement, Bjerke\u2019s attorneys can appeal that issue to a higher court, and if they prevail, his guilty plea can be withdrawn. At sentencing, prosecutors can ask for any term of years in prison but not life.\n\nBjerke is also under investigation for a similar rape at a pool in Fairfax County in 2015. Judge Lisa Kemler said that if he pleads guilty in Fairfax, the sentencing hearing in Alexandria could cover both offenses.\n\nAD\n\nPorter would not comment on that \u201copen investigation.\u201d\n\nBjerke said little other than softly answering \u201cguilty\u201d to the four counts and \u201cyes\u201d to questions from the judge.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe has many, many friends and family,\u201d defense attorney Chris Leibig told the judge in explaining his plans to ask for leniency in sentencing. \u201cHe\u2019s worked successfully as a nurse for a long time.\u201d\n\nBjerke was a stranger to the woman, who was a European working in Washington for the summer.\n\n\u201cIt was an overcast and unseasonably cold day, and there were no guests at the pool,\u201d prosecutor Jessica Smith said in court. It was early afternoon when Bjerke came in and asked the victim whether she had seen a pair of flip-flops. After following her around the pool area to a pump room, he pointed a gun at her.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cStop screaming or I\u2019ll shoot you in the mouth,\u201d Smith said he told the woman. \u201cI am going to rape you, kill you or I will do both.\u201d\n\nBjerke tied her hands behind her back with zip ties, put on latex gloves and raped her, hitting her in the head several times and telling her not to look at him.\n\nAD\n\nDNA was taken from nine other people before Bjerke was identified, Smith said in court, including someone who bought blue latex gloves at Home Depot the day of the crime and a man identified as a possible suspect by his mother.\n\n\u201cThis particular case struck a lot of fear and apprehension in this community,\u201d Police Chief Michael Brown said. \u201cWe never gave up.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBut \u201cwe were basically at a dead end\u201d until 2018, he said, when investigators from a company called Parabon NanoLabs used the website GEDMatch.com to link a DNA sample from the crime to people in Bjerke\u2019s family.\n\nHe was quickly identified as the likely perpetrator based on age and location, and police then followed him to an Old Town restaurant and captured his DNA from two straws. It was an apparent match. A search warrant was issued in February and after another DNA test found there was only a 1 in 7.2 billion chance the sperm was not his, he was arrested.\n\nAD\n\nAttorneys for Bjerke argued that the DNA profile was illegally obtained. No warrant was issued before police grabbed the straws, and Bjerke did not consent to having his genetic material retrieved and analyzed. Kemler concluded that a warrant was not required for \u201cabandoned property\u201d and that using DNA to establish identity does \u201cnot reveal private, personal information.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhile the Commonwealth understands that a balance between personal privacy and investigation must be struck, that balance is achieved when a rapist voluntarily abandons property,\u201d Porter said.\n\nThere are still few court decisions guiding the increasingly prevalent use of public DNA websites to solve crimes. The case is the first of its kind to be challenged in Virginia state court.\n\n\u201cDNA is a treasure trove of information just sitting there, and there\u2019s nothing preventing them from doing anything with it,\u201d Leibig said at a hearing earlier this year. \u201cThere needs to be a rule\u201d that is not \u201cpure trust in the government.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSmith emphasized that the evidence against Bjerke went beyond the DNA.\n\nAD\n\nWhile Bjerke denied owning a gun, both a former co-worker and a police officer who had worked with the defendant recalled him talking about having one. He was scheduled to work in the emergency room at Inova Alexandria Hospital the date of the offense but took \u201cunscheduled leave\u201d because he was not feeling well. Cellphone records indicate he then traveled to the pool. The phone next connected to a tower near Bjerke\u2019s home.\n\nOn his computer, Smith said, Bjerke showed \u201can unusual interest in news articles concerning genetic genealogy,\u201d in particular, \u201ccold case rapes being solved.\u201d\n\nNot long before his arrest, she said, he had told his employers and landlord he was planning to leave the area and become a traveling nurse.", "description": "Jesse Bjerke, a nurse, was identified through a public DNA database.", "authors": ["Rachel Weiner", "Local Reporter Covering Federal Court In Alexandria", "Va.", "Local Court In Arlington"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/48xeKIR-svfbmqTuXF1JL8acytU=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4EH2VQSATEI6TE3BGAP7WW6V4Y.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
