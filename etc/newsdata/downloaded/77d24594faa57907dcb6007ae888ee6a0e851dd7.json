Going back to school after the endless summer holidays is about catching up with old friends, making new ones, showing off a new haircut and gossiping about who\u2019s hooked up with who. And this year, thousands of children finishing their breaks are going to march through the school gates into a brand new sex and relationship education (RSE).\n\nCome September 2020, RSE will be compulsory in all primary and secondary schools, but the government is actively encouraging teachers to get the new curriculum up and running this academic year. This marks the first major reform to sex ed in eighteen years. Until now, young people have been taught the same topics as those who are now in their late thirties.\n\nNow, young people will learn about all kinds of relationships, consent, contraceptives, porn, LGBT+ rights and the internet. Controversially, all schools \u2013 including faith schools \u2013 will have to comply and parents will only be able to pull their children out until they are 16.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe RSE changes have been met with huge resistance. Parkfield, a small primary school in a predominantly Muslim part of Birmingham, drew national attention with a stream of angry parents outside the school gates, furious about the LGBT+ inclusive \u201cNo Outsiders\u201d programme. Parkfield inspired other conservative religious groups to kick off around the country. This week, parents in East London spread leaflets outside schools to say that the new RSE was promoting masturbation and \u201ctransgenderism and homosexual lifestyles\u201d.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

The exhibition marks the 200th anniversary of the birth of Queen Victoria. AP\n\nRSE has always been a battleground. When missionary preachers spread throughout the world with the expansion of the European empires, one of their first teachings was on sexuality and the spiritual importance of marriage. After all, in the words of Aim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire the Martinique poet and politician, colonialism was as much about wealth accumulation as it was a \u201ccampaign to civilise barbarism\u201d, built upon the idea of the \u201coverall superiority of Western civilisation over exotic civilisations\u201d. \u201cBarbarity\u201d and \u201csavagery\u201d was inextricably liked to sexuality and Christian missionaries worked closely with colonial powers to spread the word of God.\n\nTens of thousands of churches were built around the world where millions of people were given free food, clean water and access to safe medical care. Nonetheless, at the heart of this mission was a fundamental belief in the superiority of western thought over other traditions, and that the use of violence and force to maintain that domination was permissible. Within the Church\u2019s teachings were strict ideas about sex and marriage, and in an unprecedented move, the Church introduced the first global sex education in human history.\n\nIt should then come as no surprise that RSE is often so divisive. The way that we teach \u2013 or indeed don\u2019t teach \u2013 sex and relationships rests on some fundamental questions about human nature and society: what does it mean to be young? Is it to be innocent? Corrupt? And what is sexuality? Is it about morals? Or religion? Or consent? What about gender? Marriage? Monogamy? Porn?\n\nRSE curriculums reflect fraught politics. As recently as 1987, Margaret Thatcher told the Conservative Party conference that \u201cChildren who need to be taught to respect traditional moral values are being taught that they have an inalienable right to be gay.\u201d In the context of a media storm about AIDS, or the \u201cgay-bug\u201d as it was also called, Section 28 was introduced which made it illegal for local councils, and therefore sex education in schools, to \u201cpromote homosexuality\u201d. Astonishingly, the act was only repealed in 2003.\n\nClassrooms are political spaces, as recent debates about the lack of education on the British Empire remind us. Schools are where young people form an understanding of the world. In classrooms, we move from childhood into adolescence into adulthood.\n\nCurriculums are important, but we have to get real about teachers\u2019 ability to do a proper job with the new RSE curriculum. Schools are bent double under the weight of devastating funding cuts and grading pressures. In spite of the education secretary Gavin Williamson saying that the government will provide support for schools, half of current teachers do not feel confident enough to teach the new RSE guidelines. For the new curriculum to have the desired impact, teachers must be given the resources to do their jobs properly.\n\nBut the reality is that we don\u2019t just learn about sex and relationships in school. By putting all the expectation on schools to \u201csort the sex problem\u201d, we\u2019re denying the huge role that the rest of society plays in forming and shaping our attitudes and relationships.\n\nWe grow up surrounded by media, family, friends, religious communities, and relationships that may contradict even the most well-intended school sex ed classes. Non-consent is often depicted as fine and normal in culture, there are gaping gender inequalities throughout society, attacks on LGBT+ communities are becoming increasingly common and #MeToo highlighted what many of us already knew \u2013 how devastatingly commonplace sexual violence is.\n\nSex education wasn\u2019t always limited to classrooms. Before printing presses and before public schooling was introduced, knowledge was transferred between generations by word of mouth: through fables, myth and stories. Today, it\u2019s not all doom and gloom. There are plenty of community-led programmes and educational resources that teach healthy, positive relationships and campaigning groups struggling for justice and rights.\n\nWhilst the curriculum changes are a good place to start, there is an urgent need to continue those critical conversations about consent, sexual violence and healthy relationships into workplaces, friendship groups and communities.
