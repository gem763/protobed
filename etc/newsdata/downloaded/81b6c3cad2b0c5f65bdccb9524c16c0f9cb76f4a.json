In return, Northern Ireland would remain within the EU\u2019s regulatory orbit in key areas, including agriculture, a proposal Johnson has already signalled publicly.\n\nJohnson hopes the Democratic Unionist party can be won over to some form of compromise, despite its previous objections to a border of any kind down the Irish Sea.\n\nThe party\u2019s leader, Arlene Foster, insisted on Friday that the UK \u201cmust leave as one nation\u201d, after a report in the Times suggested her party\u2019s stance was softening.\n\nArlene Foster (@DUPleader) UK must leave as one nation. We are keen to see a sensible deal but not one that divides the internal market of the UK. We will not support any arrangements that create a barrier to East West trade. Anonymous sources lead to nonsense stories. #frontpages\n\nThe government hopes that once power-sharing is restored the Stormont assembly could also form part of a solution by giving democratic consent to any arrangements that keep Northern Ireland aligned with the EU.\n\nBut Ireland\u2019s deputy prime minister cast doubt on that proposal on Friday. \u201cThere is certainly a concern at an EU level that a devolved institution in Northern Ireland could have a veto over how the single market operates, or a border on the single market operates, so it\u2019s not as straightforward as some people are suggesting,\u201d Simon Coveney said after a two-day party \u201cthink-in\u201d in Cork.\n\nQ&A What is a Northern Ireland-only backstop? Show Hide The British government\u2019s version of Brexit involves the UK ultimately leaving the single market and customs union, requiring the return of a range of checks on goods crossing the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The \u201cbackstop\u201d is intended as a standstill placeholder to ensure such checks do not have to be imposed between Brexit happening with a deal, and the start of a new free trade agreement yet to be negotiated between the UK and the EU. Theresa May's withdrawal agreement proposed keeping the whole of the UK in a shared customs territory with the EU during this period. An alternative idea involves only Northern Ireland staying in the EU\u2019s customs territory. That would place a customs border in the Irish Sea. May described it as a threat to the constitutional integrity of the UK, but the new prime minister, Boris Johnson, has opened the current talks by proposing an all-Ireland agri-food zone. The suggestion is that he will seek to quietly build on that with further NI-only arrangements. Given an NI-only backstop was an EU proposal in the first place, the U-turn would be warmly welcomed in Brussels, although attempts to give the Northern Ireland assembly a veto on its continuation would not be acceptable, and the DUP would be unlikely to support the prime minister in such a move in parliament. If there is a no-deal Brexit, then there is no backstop. Daniel Boffey\n\nLeo Varadkar, the taoiseach, said there was \u201congoing contact with the DUP\u201d and other parties in Northern Ireland and it is believed further talks at government level are scheduled next week. But he said he was not aware of any change in the unionists\u2019 position over their refusal to accept any checks in the Irish Sea as a means of keeping the Irish border invisible.\n\nMonday\u2019s talks between Johnson and Juncker will take place at a lunch in the European commission president\u2019s home country, where he was prime minister for 18 years. The EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, who recently called for \u201cconcrete proposals from Downing Street\u201d, will join the two leaders. Johnson will then hold talks with the current prime minister of Luxembourg, Xavier Bettel.\n\nEU sources suggested Johnson had sought to avoid a meeting in Brussels for fear of giving the impression that he was begging for concessions. A European commission spokeswoman said the location had been chosen by \u201ccommon accord\u201d and that it would allow Juncker the benefit of going straight from the talks to Strasbourg, where the European parliament is sitting next week.\n\nShe said the meeting was \u201ctaking place at a neutral location, which [we] will not disclose\u201d.\n\nJohnson\u2019s communications team is understood to believe that May undermined herself in the public eye by making dashes to Brussels to seek movement in the negotiation.\n\nEU officials are concerned about the lack of any detailed proposals from the UK side, despite early goodwill built up by Johnson in a series of one-to-one meetings with leaders.\n\nThey have also been watching the tumult in parliament over recent days. Johnson\u2019s government was rocked this week by the Scottish court judgment that his suspension of parliament was illegal, and he was heckled at a speech in Rotherham on Friday.\n\nBut Johnson\u2019s advisers believe that despite the upheaval at Westminster, their domestic agenda \u2013 including increasing resources for schools and police \u2013 is beginning to register with voters in focus groups and polling.\n\nJohnson is expected to switch the focus to law and order next week, as he continues to announce manifesto-ready pledges, in the expectation that MPs will eventually have to succumb to his desire for a general election, rather than allow him to continue to govern without a majority.", "description": "Downing Street has no plans to publish proposals despite chance of border compromise", "authors": ["Heather Stewart", "Daniel Boffey", "Lisa O'Carroll", "Jonathan Freedland", "Ell Smith"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8581a2c4146329f4ca93ebbcb0155f4bed147f15/0_0_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f4d105eb48be0a8c6556ceec19b198da", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
