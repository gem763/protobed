Some people want to be almost enveloped by their mattress, others want it to barely move when they rest on it.\n\nThis sits right in the middle; it\u2019s got a decent amount of give, and you\u2019ll be comforted in a small ident while you\u2019re sleeping. For couples with a firmness preference on either end of the scale, this is the perfect compromise. If you insist on a hard mattress, or something ridiculously squishy, this likely isn\u2019t for you.\n\nThe innerspring coil base is an improvement on the base model, making the mattress respond and settle quickly when someone gets into and out of the bed - avoiding that squishy \u2018waterbed\u2019 feeling that some bulky memory foam beds have.\n\nMemory foam mattresses often get a bad reputation for overheating sleepers. But the Casper Wave Hybrid is built on a 7-inch foundation of pocket coils that allow air to flow freely through the space in between each coil. This will keep you cool, though it won\u2019t sleep quite as cool as a full innerspring or full latex mattress. Keep that in mind if you tend to sleep hot.\n\nThe Wave Hybrid is built on a seven-inch foundation of pocket coils which are designed to allow air to circulate. It\u2019s still toastier than a typical innerspring mattress, but a lot cooler than previous memory foam mattresses we\u2019ve tried. Obviously, this is more of a concern in summer, in winter we can see this being welcome.\n\nIt\u2019s incredibly soft, with a wool finish - but you\u2019ll likely be covering the surface with a sheet so it\u2019s not something you\u2019ll regularly get to enjoy. However, it\u2019s moisture-wicking, which should reduce bedtime sweatiness on hot nights.\n\nBear in mind the slat requirements if you\u2019re buying this for a wooden bed - Casper recommends that they\u2019re spaced no further than four inches apart, presumably to avoid sagging. This is typical for most memory foam mattress and worth considering whether you need a few extra slats (as I did).\n\nThe verdict? After the first night on the Casper Wave hybrid mattress my body genuinely felt different - like a masseuse had cracked my back into the correct posture. I\u2019d sometimes feel lower-back pain on my previous memory foam mattress, but this provided the right amount of gently distributed support.\n\nIt's soft, cosy, and keeps me relatively cool when compared to some of its competitor products that I've tried.\n\nBut the price tag is significant - $2,495 for the queen-size mattress, for example. And whether you're prepared to spring that kind of cash on a mattress probably depends on how important sleep is to you. In the way that some people eat to live while others live to eat, the same goes with sleep. My girlfriend is one of those people for whom sleep is one of the highlights of her day - and when she hops into this bed, she lets out an almost cartoon-like 'aahhh' every time she lies down. She can't help it.\n\nCasper offers a 100-night trial to help you make up your mind, and if you decide against it they\u2019ll send a courier to pack it away and remove it - before attempting to donate it to a local charity or recycle it. There\u2019s also an industry standard 10-year limited warranty.\n\nThe queen-size mattress - which we tested - weighs just over 110 pounds and measures 60 inches by 80 inches.\n\nCasper offers \u2018white-glove\u2019 delivery whereby someone will carry the mattress right to your apartment and unpack (useful if you\u2019re up a few flights of stairs with no elevator, like me) and even take your old one away.\n\nIndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
