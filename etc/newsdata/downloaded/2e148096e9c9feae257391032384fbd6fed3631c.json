Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), and soon-to-be former Rep. Francis Rooney (R-Fla.) are among those who have chosen retirement from public service over a protracted battle for the GOP\u2019s future.\n\nFor Romney\u2019s part, he\u2019s essentially acknowledged he\u2019s a sub-party of one: \u201cI don\u2019t believe I\u2019m leading a wing of the party. Because there\u2019s no wing that\u2019s very large that is aligned with me.\u201d Just as Flake and Corker and others did before him, and just as Rooney has done since, Romney challenges Trump to no great effect. He hits hard, and the president hits back harder, as do Trump\u2019s well-funded supporters.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nLikewise, the views of conservative thinkers haven\u2019t moved the needle and never will. Outrage from former cabinet officials and advisors are largely irrelevant. Even a popular blue-state Republican governor\u2019s warnings are yesterday\u2019s news.\n\nThe power of the individual is muted in Trump\u2019s White House. Foreign policy experts are cast aside. Relationships are transient. Attacking him is a slippery proposition. Trump wields his megaphone like no other elected official has, and when it\u2019s trained on you; few if any come to your aid.\n\nBut these next 12 months, the GOP has everything to lose, as 2020 will be the most impactful election in 20 years. For starters, the party will try to maintain legislative control in nine blue or purple states: Arizona, Florida, Iowa, Michigan, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Wisconsin. In seven of these states (all except North Carolina and Ohio), a mere three-seat swing to the Democrats would shift party control in one or both chambers. This precarious situation is exacerbated by Trump\u2019s net-negative approval ratings in each of these nine states, with an average of negative-7.\n\nMeanwhile, although taking back the U.S. House appears as daunting as ever, the presidency and U.S. Senate are still up for grabs. It\u2019s the Senate that holds the key to Trump\u2019s fate, and not just with respect to impeachment.\n\nFor if the end comes early for this president, it will be at the hands of many Republicans all at once\u2014a well-coordinated, unified front seeking to wrest control of their party before it\u2019s too late. This group likely will be comprised of the most vulnerable Republican senators and their allies. Their mission will be clear: cut off Trump to save the Senate.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nLast week\u2019s Morning Consult polls reinforced the GOP\u2019s dire predicament. Republicans are contending not only with an unpopular president, but also with five increasingly unpopular senators, four of whom own approval ratings below 40 percent. They represent the firewall.\n\nIf they lose, Democrats almost certainly would reclaim the Senate, and might not relinquish it for at least four years, as Republicans will be protecting roughly two-thirds of all seats in contention in 2022.\n\nThis means Democrats realistically would have four years to block a re-elected Trump\u2019s nominees\u2014or four years to dramatically reshape the courts alongside a new Democratic president.\n\nSurely many Republicans believe there is still time to right the ship. And of course, there is. The only thing more disruptive than mutiny is premature mutiny.\n\nBut let\u2019s be clear: No single salvo aimed at Trump will diminish the president\u2019s overwhelming support among Republicans. Even a perceivably weakened Trump is significantly stronger than any other Republican on their best day.\n\nAside from the constitutional electoral process, the only way Trump will leave office is if a significant number of Republican senators make it happen \u2014 if they band together and agree to absorb Trump\u2019s punishment without breaking, without turning away, and without backing down. Their purpose: safeguard the Senate from a Democratic takeover at all costs to ensure the gains made these last three years are not lost. With sufficient numbers, they, not the president, will hold sway over the party.\n\nIt could be politically bloody. But it will assuredly end quickly. And if you asked most Republicans, a quick end would probably sound pretty good.\n\nB.J.
