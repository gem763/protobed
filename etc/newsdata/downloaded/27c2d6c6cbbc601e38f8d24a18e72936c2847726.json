Mirror Money got hold of a worker at Co-Operative Bank to find out.\n\nChris Regan is one of the many people who've used the new code and specialist services set up to make life that little bit easier for victims of financial abuse.\n\nHe was the one on the desk when someone in need of help came in.\n\n\u201cA customer came into one of our branches with her social worker,\" Chris explained.\n\nHe quickly found out that she needed more than a straightforward transaction.\n\nThe social worker explained that the customer had not only suffered a stroke, making it hard for her to communicate, but there was a case of wilful neglect being investigated by the police.\n\nHer relationship had broken down and she'd lost her home as a result. She was also left not knowing her PIN to withdraw money.\n\nChris took action - working with his manager to ensure she got the support she needed to make her life as simple as possible.\n\n(Image: PA Wire)\n\nHer account was switched from joint to sole, her former partner's access restricted, a note was added to the file so nothing was sent to her old address and money was authorised for her to wirthdraw.\n\nIn a single visit she had been set free.\n\n\"I\u2019m really glad that we have bespoke processes that we can use to support our vulnerable customers and that we were able to put that in place quickly for our customer whilst they made the one visit to the branch that day,\u201d Chris said.\n\nCo-operative Bank spokesperson Lesley McPherson, said: \u201cFinancial abuse is an important issue that has a far bigger impact than most people realise, and the effects can be devastating.\n\n\u201cWhile raising awareness continues to be important, banks must continue to adjust their processes to protect customers in this particularly vulnerable situation. That is why the Financial Abuse Code of Practice was such a positive step.\u201d\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nThe Co-operative Bank and domestic abuse charity Refuge are working together to make things as easy as possible for victims of financial abuse.\n\nThey have specific guidelines in place, so when they fins out a is vulnerable or a victim of financial abuse staff seek out any other accounts they might have to ensure they only have to tell the bank once.\n\nRefuge chief executive Sandra Horley said: \u201cOf the many thousands of women Refuge supported last year who disclosed that they had experienced domestic abuse, half said that their partner controlled all of the household finances.\n\n\"Hundreds of women reported that they have been forced into taking out debt in their own name, which was controlled and spent by their perpetrator.\n\n\u201cThe consequences of economic abuse can be devastating.\"\n\nShe pointed out 10% of the women Refuge had helped following economic abuse had been made homeless. One in five said that they had been unable to buy food for themselves or their children.\n\nOver a quarter said they had been forced into debt.\n\nBut things are changing - with 18 major banks now signed up to the new code of practice.\n\nAnd many banks are going beyond the code.\n\nNatWest, for example, is working with SafeLives to review and improve upon its existing response to supporting customers who are affected by financial abuse.\n\nCo-Op is another bank working hard to do more than required to help those in need.\n\nSafeLives' Jacob said: \"Banks plays an important role in our life, often for many years and sometimes for a lifetime, and they therefore have a crucial role to play in improving the response to abuse, using the insight and tools they have.\u201d\n\nRefuge's Horley added: \u201cEconomic abuse is real. One in five adults have experienced economic abuse from a current or former partner and the Financial Abuse Code of Practice is an important step towards taking real action to address economic abuse.\u201d", "description": "Domestic abuse and financial abuse go hand in hand far more than many admit - with the fear of ending up penniless and homeless a weapon abusers hold over their victims.
