Citing \u201cleague sources,\u201d Stein reports that teams were notified of the new policy this week.\n\nHeights will reportedly be measured with players\u2019 shoes off to avoid adding any extra inches. The league will not seek to certify players\u2019 weights, because \u201cthat number fluctuates so often.\u201d\n\nPlayers have been listed as being taller or shorter than they actually are for years, and as Stein writes, \u201cthe league clearly wants to change that.\u201d The move is reportedly also a reaction to Buddy Hield\u2019s age being reported incorrectly in 2018. Hield was believed to be turning 25 when he actually was turning 26. He insisted he never lied about his age and that it was simply reported incorrectly. \u201cThat\u2019s their fault, not my fault,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cThe first time I saw it on Wikipedia, my mom said, \u2018Why do they have your age wrong?\u2019 I said, \u2018I have no idea.'\u201d\n\nThe heights and ages of each player must be certified and submitted within the first week of training camp \u2014 which means we may soon find out whether Kevin Durant is actually 6\u20199\u2033.\n\nCheck out Stein\u2019s tweets below.\n\nNBA teams were notified this week that they must certify and submit the precise height and age for every player within the first week of training camp, league sources tell @NYTSports \u2014 Marc Stein (@TheSteinLine) September 26, 2019\n\nFor years some players have been listed as taller \u2014 and some shorter \u2014 than they really are.
