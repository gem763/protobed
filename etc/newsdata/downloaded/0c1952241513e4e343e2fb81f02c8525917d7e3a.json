Elbel and his team used mapping software and the city\u2019s restaurant inspection data to compare students\u2019 addresses with their distance from fast-food outlets, corner stores, sit-down restaurants and grocery stores, all selling healthy food and junk food.\n\nThe researchers used the inspection data to identify restaurants with counter service, including pizza, Chinese and any other kind of order-at-the-counter takeout.\n\nThe researchers were then able to correlate students\u2019 body mass index data with precisely how close they lived to these kinds of restaurants.\n\nAD\n\nThe comparisons made were \u201chighly neighborhood specific,\u201d according to the researchers. For example, youths in a small section of Harlem were compared only with other youths in the same part of Harlem.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt really gets rid of a lot of the confounding data like socioeconomic status,\u201d Elbel said. \u201cWe weren\u2019t looking at Upper East Side kids versus Lower East Side kids. We were comparing kids that live in the same small neighborhood to each other. How does living close versus a little bit further away affect kids? There\u2019s something about living within half a block to fast food that\u2019s not great.\u201d\n\nThe study, Elbel acknowledged, does not account for the rise of healthier counter-service eateries such as Sweetgreen, but he said that because the data was collected between 2007 and 2013, most of the eateries covered by the study were traditional fast-food restaurants leaning on hamburgers, sandwiches and such.\n\nAD\n\nFor Elbel, \u201cfood swamps,\u201d or urban areas with a density of fast-food restaurants and corner stores stocked with unhealthy choices, present challenges.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about supply and demand, the structure of cities and historical zoning issues,\u201d he said. \u201cA bigger question is: What is it about access to these restaurants that\u2019s triggering?\u201d\n\nThe study found no increase in obesity risk based on the distance from home to grocery stores and sit-down restaurants. What appears to put youths at risk is how easily and quickly they can access junk food, Elbel said.\n\nHe said further research was needed to explore what happens when children pass fast-food outlets on the way to and from school.\n\nAD\n\nThere has been a lot of voluntary regulation, he said, with the food industry agreeing to clamp down on advertising to children. But, Elbel said, government bears some responsibility to regulate.\n\n\u201cPolicy has been proposed that addresses the density of these kinds of restaurants,\u201d he said. \u201cLondon had considered restricting fast food around schools. We already limit liquor stores around schools and churches.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nObesity rates for children have tripled since the 1970s, and experts say a drop of just a few percentage points could save thousands of children from diabetes, heart disease and other health problems.\n\nAccording to a National Survey of Children\u2019s Health report released this month, obesity rates among youths ages 10 to 17 averaged 15.3 percent nationwide, with a childhood obesity rate of 25.4 percent in Mississippi.\n\nAD\n\nNationwide, black and Hispanic youths had obesity rates of 22.2 percent and 19 percent respectively, significantly higher than white (11.8 percent) or Asian (7.3 percent) youths.\n\nBut the root causes are confounding \u2014 how to tweeze out genetic predispositions from lifestyle choices and income \u2014 and this muddies what can be done about it.\n\nIt has not been all gloomy news for children\u2019s nutrition. According to the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, over the past several years there has been a decline in obesity rates among some children.\n\nAD\n\nMore than 30 million children eat healthier school breakfasts, lunches and snacks thanks to the updated nutrition standards ushered in by the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010. The obesity rate among children participating in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) declined from 15.9 percent in 2010 to 13.9 percent in 2016. Researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention cited recent healthy updates to the WIC food package as one possible driver of the decline in obesity rates.\n\nAD", "description": "The closer kids live to fast food, the more likely they\u2019ll be obese, researchers say.", "authors": ["Laura Reiley", "Reporter Covering The Business Of Food"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Yo0kqk0cY8D3uEQ1_LOfSa-1MLo=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/UIAVKKHZ4AI6THQCDVC4WPP2R4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
