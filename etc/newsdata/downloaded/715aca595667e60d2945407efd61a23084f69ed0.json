Rescued by brave French civilians and taken to Paris, the flyers met a courageous French family living and working on the grounds of the H\u00f4tel des Invalides, site of Napol\u00e9on\u2019s Tomb. Hidden there, under the very noses of the Gestapo, the downed flyers and their resistance hosts planned the aviators\u2019 escape to England. For Sgt. Joe Cornwall\u2014a gunner on the B-17 named Salty\u2019s Naturals\u2014the time spent in the French capital would become more than an unintended stay in the City of Light\u2014it would lead to a romance he would remember for the rest of his life.\n\nAs takeoff time neared, pilot Ed Purdy and co-pilot Carroll Harris brought Salty\u2019s Naturals to life, her four Wright Cyclone engines awakening one after the other, each coughing a cloud of acrid, blue-white exhaust smoke that drifted across the field to mingle with the fog created by 76 other thundering power plants. The noise rose to an even more deafening crescendo as one by one the 94th Bomb Group\u2019s 20 heavily laden B-17s moved slowly off their hardstands in the aircraft dispersal areas and joined the queue of bombers rolling ponderously along the perimeter track encircling Rougham Airfield\u2019s three intersecting runways.\n\nGroup commander Colonel Frederick Castle led the parade of Fortresses, rolling onto the active runway less than a minute ahead of the scheduled takeoff time. At exactly 6 a.m. a green flare shot into the air from the roof of Rougham\u2019s control tower, and Castle smoothly advanced the B-17\u2019s four throttles and accelerated down the long strip of concrete. Even before his aircraft lifted off, the next machine in line had begun its own takeoff roll. Within 20 minutes all 19 bombers that constituted the 94th Bomb Group\u2019s contribution to the raid\u2014one aircraft aborted due to a mechanical problem\u2014were in the air and assembling into the stepped, three-squadron formation.\n\nOver the next 45 minutes the 94th joined up with the three other groups bound for the German airfield at Le Bourget, outside Paris, and by the time the 84 B-17s passed over the Isle of Wight and turned east over the Channel they had formed into two combat wings of two groups each, with the wings in the usual staggered box formation. The high squadron of the high group of the high wing was at 25,575 feet, while Salty\u2019s Naturals and the other two Fortresses in the second element of 331st Bomb Squadron commander Major Ralph \u201cSalty\u201d Saltsman\u2019s low-low squadron were cruising at just over 21,000 feet. As soon as the formation crossed the English coast Joe Cornwall and the other gunners sought and received permission to test-fire their guns, and streams of tracer rounds briefly arced across the sunlight sky in all directions. Minutes later, dozens of RAF Spitfire fighters dropped into escort position above and around the 84 Fortresses. The arrival of the \u201cLittle Friends\u201d was always a welcome event, for though the bomber crewmen knew their formation was formidable, they also realized all too well that it was far from invulnerable. They also knew that fuel limitations meant the Spits would not be around for long. And as soon as they left, the predators would arrive in force.\n\nEven before the RAF fighters had joined the American bombers, German air-defense controllers had been tracking the course of the incoming raiders and alerting interceptor squadrons across central France.\n\nAmong the first Luftwaffe units dispatched against the Fortress formations was Major Egon Mayer\u2019s Jagdgeschwader 2. The fighter wing\u2019s pilots had been sitting in their fueled and fully armed aircraft since just before 7 a.m., and at 7:26 were ordered to launch. Within minutes some 90 Fw 190 and Bf 109 fighters were lifting off from the fields at Beaumont-le-Roger and E\u0301vreux, with Mayer leading 12 Fw 190s of his headquarters flight. The majority of the interceptors were vectored toward what the fighter controller called \u201ca very large formation\u201d of incoming bombers that had crossed the French coast at Fe\u0301camp and was headed southwest, in the direction of E\u0301vreux. Mayer estimated that he and his men would be in position to hit the raiders just after they crossed the River Seine about halfway between Le Havre and Rouen and hoped that the formations were being escorted by Spitfires, rather than the longer-legged American P-47 Thunderbolts.\n\nMayer was in luck, for the RAF fighters began hitting their fuel limits minutes after the American formation crossed the Seine near Villequier. As the Spits began turning back toward the Channel, German controllers vectored interceptors from other units after them, hoping to both bag a few of the nimble British fighters and to prevent them from interfering in any way with the assault Mayer and his men were about to launch. In preparation for that attack, the JG 2 airmen had climbed to 28,000 feet and maneuvered into a position that would allow them to hit the bombers head-on at a point about 15 miles northwest of E\u0301vreux. The bright July sun would be behind and off to the right of the incoming German fighters, and the glare would give them a few extra precious moments of cover before they were sighted and engaged by the Fortress gunners.\n\nThe first inkling the men of the 94th Bomb Group had of the impending attack was at 7:40 a.m. when Castle, in the lead Fortress, called out a sighting of unidentified fighters crossing ahead of the bomber stream from southwest to northeast at a slightly higher altitude and about three miles distant. He cautioned that they might be \u201cfriendlies\u201d that had been escorting some other Allied formation and were now heading back to England and ordered the group\u2019s gunners not to engage them until they had been positively identified as hostile. That confirmation came all too quickly, for no sooner had Castle ended his brief message than the JG 2 aircraft\u2014mostly Fw 190s\u2014turned directly toward the bomber stream and bored in. Some of the fighters engaged the high and lead groups, while others concentrated on the 94th. The first gaggle of attackers scythed through the low group\u2019s formation from twelve o\u2019clock high\u2014directly in front of and above the bombers\u2014in tight, three-aircraft \u201cketten,\u201d each pilot aiming at the cockpit and nose area of his chosen victim in a three-to-four-second firing run before turning sharply to one side or rolling inverted and passing beneath his target. Once clear of the formation\u2019s return fire, the German fighter pilots reversed course, pulled parallel to the bombers and raced ahead for two or three miles, then turned back for another run.\n\nAboard Salty\u2019s Naturals the first to call out the incoming fighters was Charlie Lichtenberger. The navigator\u2019s shouted warning of \u201cHere they come!\u201d was immediately followed by bursts of fire from the Fortress\u2019s nose and top turret guns, and as the German fighters flashed past off the bomber\u2019s left side left waist gunner Joe Cornwall and tail gunner Larry Templeton both scored hits. There was no time to savor the moment however, for Rick Marquardt in the top turret called out that a second trio of Fw 190s was boring in toward Saltsman\u2019s lead aircraft; all aboard Salty\u2019s Naturals knew instinctively that their bomber\u2014almost directly behind and slightly below Saltsman\u2019s Good Time Cholly II\u2014would be squarely in the enemy\u2019s gunsights as the fighters screamed through the 331st\u2019s formation.\n\nAt the moment, however, the Fw 190s were Cholly\u2019s problem. Several men aboard the squadron lead aircraft had called out the incoming fighters, and as the first attacker closed in, Joe Cornwall\u2019s friend Dick Davitt engaged the German machine with his twin .50-caliber top turret guns. The two streams of thumb-sized rounds converged on the fighter with immediate and spectacular effect: the Fw exploded while still one hundred yards ahead of the formation, and pilot Willis Frank had to quickly raise Cholly\u2019s left wing to avoid the three large chunks of tumbling, burning debris that were all that remained of the fighter. Frank\u2019s quick thinking saved his aircraft\u2014for the moment\u2014but it also doomed Salty\u2019s Naturals.\n\nEveryone in that Fortress\u2019s front end\u2014Purdy and Harris in the cockpit, Marquardt in the top turret, and bombardier Ed Jones, navigator Charlie Lichtenberger, and photographer Jeff Dickson in the nose\u2014almost certainly saw the German fighter disintegrate and likely knew they were helpless to prevent the disaster that was about to engulf them. But all Chuck Sprague in the radio room and the gunners in the rear of the B-17 heard was a strangled shout of \u201cOh my God!\u201d over the intercom just seconds before the Fw\u2019s blazing fuselage slammed into the Fortress\u2019s left wing. The wreckage and the bomber collided at a closing speed of some 450 miles an hour, and the impact sheared off 25 feet of the B-17\u2019s wing beyond the No. 1 (outboard) engine.\n\nTwo equally catastrophic events occurred within one or two seconds after the collision. The first was the instantaneous detonation of the 100-octane aviation gasoline spewing from the severed lines that moments before had connected the Fortress\u2019s main tanks with the nine smaller tanks in the now-vanished outboard wing section. The searing heat immediately and fatally compromised what was left of the wing\u2019s internal structure, and a long, roiling tongue of flame and dark black smoke arced back toward the bomber\u2019s tail. The second and nearly simultaneous event was the almost total loss of lift on the B-17\u2019s left side, which caused Salty\u2019s Naturals to snap roll violently to the left, enter a spin, and immediately shed several hundred feet of altitude.\n\n\u201c Salty\u2019s Naturals leveled out just long enough for two men to jump from the bomber before it headed for the ground. \u201d\n\nWhile Ed Purdy must have known that his aircraft was doomed, the young officer apparently did all he could to pull Salty\u2019s Naturals out of its death spiral. In flight school, Purdy had learned that under normal circumstances a pilot attempting to recover from a spin should reduce engine power to idle to prevent the airflow of the propellers from striking the aircraft\u2019s horizontal stabilizer and thereby forcing the nose upward, prolonging the spin. But the loss of the B-17\u2019s outboard wing section and resulting radically asymmetrical lift meant that Purdy\u2019s only chance to recover from the spin was to add full power for as long as possible on the two left engines, shove the right aileron down hard, and put the bomber\u2019s rudder as far to the right as it would go. He appears to have successfully performed each action, for after falling about 4,500 feet Salty\u2019s Naturals leveled out just long enough for two men to jump from the bomber before it once more snap-rolled, and with flames trailing from its mangled wing, headed for the ground.\n\nOne of the jumpers was Joe Cornwall.\n\nJoe was looking directly out his waist window\u2014tracking a twin-engine Bf 110 that was pacing the 94th formation, just out of range\u2014when the Fw 190 collided with Salty\u2019s Naturals. The impact threw Joe and right-waist gunner Frank Santangelo to the fuselage floor and away from their guns, the sudden movement disconnecting their interphone cords and oxygen hoses. Neither man had time to move before the bomber\u2019s snap-roll lifted them and hurled them against the ceiling, where the intense centrifugal force caused by the aircraft\u2019s gyrations kept them momentarily pinned in place.\n\nSeconds later, as Ed Purdy\u2019s efforts in the cockpit began to have an effect, the gunners again crashed to the hard floor, with Frank landing atop Joe\u2019s legs. Though to that point the experience was much like what had happened to the gunners weeks earlier on the Kiel raid, both men intuitively understood that Salty\u2019s Naturals would not be returning to Rougham this time. Not waiting for the bailout bell, the airmen struggled to reach the parachute packs stowed in small metal racks just aft of their respective waist windows. The short journey was complicated by the bomber\u2019s continuing convolutions, by the hundreds of expended .50-caliber machine-gun cartridges flying around the fuselage interior like a swarm of very angry brass bees, and by the first stages of anoxia resulting from oxygen deprivation.\n\nUpon finally reaching the stowage rack, each gunner snapped the two large metal hooks on the back of the chest-pack parachute into the D-rings on the front of his harness. After a quick check to ensure that the chutes were firmly attached and not damaged, Joe and Frank crawled to the crew entry door on the right side of the rear fuselage. Frank pulled the emergency release lever that sent the door spinning away, then dived head-first after it. Joe paused for a moment and, assuming that everyone who was capable of leaving the ship had, hurled himself into space.\n\nWhen Joe abandoned Salty\u2019s Naturals he encountered an entirely new range of sensations. The first was the panic-inducing feeling of tumbling uncontrollably through the air, thousands of feet above the ground, green earth and blue sky changing places every few seconds.\n\nAs disorienting and frightening as the roughly 160-feet-per-second free fall was, however, Joe judged that he was still above 10,000 feet and delayed opening his chute for a few moments so that he could more quickly get down into breathable air. Some 30 seconds after leaving the bomber he brought his elbows tightly into his sides, forced his knees and ankles together to bring his feet directly below him and, once upright, used his right hand to pull the bright aluminum ripcord handle protruding from the chute pack. That action brought on yet another new sensation: the deployment of the pack\u2019s small drogue chute was followed immediately by the opening of the main canopy, jerking Joe to a virtual standstill. The sudden deceleration wrenched his back, sending sharp jolts of searing pain through both shoulders, and the lower straps of the harness bit painfully into his groin. The g-forces and the agony in his upper body momentarily made it difficult for him to raise his arms to grasp the suspension lines. Once he had control of the chute he looked beneath him, where he saw Santangelo\u2019s fully deployed canopy. Off to one side and a few thousand feet below, he saw Salty\u2019s Naturals slowing spinning toward the ground, a long plume of greasy black and gray smoke marking its final passage through the morning sky. Suddenly, a parachute blossomed from the dying bomber\u2019s tail section, and with a surge of relief Joe realized that Larry Templeton had made it out.\n\n\u201c The explosions could be heard for miles in every direction, and Joe knew he had to get moving before the detonations attracted German troops. \u201d\n\nFor reasons that will remain forever unknown, seven of the eight men in the forward section of Salty\u2019s Naturals never made it out of the doomed bomber. It\u2019s entirely possible that the three in the B-17\u2019s nose\u2014Jones, Lichtenberger, and Dickson\u2014and top turret gunner Rick Marquardt were either seriously injured or killed outright by debris from the demolished German fighter or were prevented by centrifugal force from reaching their designated escape hatches. Purdy and Harris would have had their hands full trying to hold the B-17 steady so that others could bail out and may themselves have been unable to move from their seats once Salty\u2019s Naturals reentered a spin. For ball turret gunner John Smith, just getting out of his cramped fighting position and up into the aircraft\u2019s fuselage would have been a Herculean task. If there were still electrical power to operate the turret, Smith would have rotated the ball so that its guns pointed straight down and the entry hatch was inside the aircraft. But if the B-17\u2019s electrical systems had failed\u2014a more than likely possibility given the extensive damage Salty\u2019s Naturals had suffered\u2014the gunner would have had to hand-crank the turret into the proper position in order to escape. Smith\u2019s efforts may have been greatly hampered, of course, by injuries, disorientation, or anoxia. In the end, all we know for certain is that he never took to his parachute.\n\nAnd in one of those cruel ironies that are so widespread in wartime, the one man in the B-17\u2019s forward fuselage who did manage to escape fell victim to an all-too-common hazard. While it is unclear how radio operator Chuck Sprague actually exited the Fortress\u2014his normal route was through the bomb bay, but the doors were never opened\u2014it is certain that he pulled his ripcord before he was fully clear of the aircraft. When the spring-loaded drogue chute popped out it briefly hung up on something\u2014a gun mount perhaps, or a jagged piece of damaged fuselage\u2014that hampered the proper deployment of the suspension lines. They, in turn, wrapped around the canopy, fouling it and preventing its inflation.\n\nWith no secondary parachute to save him, Sprague fell thousands of feet to his death, the useless folds of silk flapping above him.\n\nThough glad to have escaped Salty\u2019s Naturals and heartened by the sudden appearance of Larry Templeton\u2019s parachute from the tail of the doomed bomber, Joe Cornwall knew that his own continued survival was by no means assured. The sun-dappled fields, woodlands, and small villages spread out in all directions beneath him looked both idyllic and benign, but Joe knew that German troops were already organizing sweeps across the countryside in search of American aviators who may have survived the downing of their aircraft. He understood full well that capture by the enemy would at best result in spending years in a prisoner-of-war camp, and at worst could mean a bullet to the back of the head and burial in an unmarked grave.\n\nWhile the escape and evasion briefings Joe and his colleagues had received emphasized extreme caution when dealing with civilians in German-occupied Europe, the aviators were also assured that there were well-organized escape lines operating across the continent. The organizations might consist of several dozen people, they were told, but were built around loosely affiliated cells of six or eight individuals who knew and trusted each other.\n\nMaking contact with an escape line\u2019s members\u2014called \u201chelpers\u201d by the Allies\u2014was more likely if the downed aviator headed east, away from the fortified and heavily patrolled coast, intelligence officials said. If shot down over northern or central France, aircrews were told, they should try to make their way toward one of the major cities\u2014especially Paris\u2014both because they would blend in far better than they might in a small town, and because the escape lines were more active in the larger metropolitan areas.\n\nMembers of Eighth Air Force combat crews were also provided with a variety of items meant to improve the odds of making a successful \u201chome run\u201d should their aircraft go down in enemy territory. In addition to a standard personal first aid kit, these included several passport-sized photos of the aviator in civilian clothes\u2014intended for use in forged identity papers provided by the escape line\u2014an easily concealable map of northern France printed on silk, a small compass, matches, Benzedrine tablets to combat exhaustion, and one or two bars of chocolate. Also included was a small zippered purse containing French currency\u2014in Joe\u2019s case, 2,000 francs\u2014to be used for bribes or to purchase necessary items.\n\nAll of the advice about how to become a successful \u201cevader\u201d was swirling in Joe\u2019s head as he floated ever closer to the soil of German-occupied France, but he knew that his most immediate concern was getting on the ground without breaking a leg. After a quick scan of the surrounding sky\u2014neither Santangelo\u2019s chute nor Templeton\u2019s was still visible\u2014he focused his attention on the fast-approaching earth, pulled his heels and knees together, and slightly bent his knees. Seconds later he slammed down in the middle of a grain field, about a half mile southeast from where the scattered wreckage of Salty\u2019s Naturals burned furiously. White-hot needles of pain shot up Joe\u2019s spine and across his shoulders, but he stood up immediately, and after gathering his chute in his arms he ran toward a nearby wood line. Once under cover of the trees he knelt and buried his harness, life jacket, and parachute in a shallow hole he scraped out with his hands, and he was just standing up when the bombs in the hulk of the blazing Fortress began \u201ccooking off.\u201d The explosions could be heard for miles in every direction, and Joe knew he had to get moving before the detonations attracted German troops.\n\nThinking the enemy would likely scour the woods and villages in the vicinity of the crash site, Joe decided to put the small river he\u2019d seen from the air between him and the final resting place of Salty\u2019s Naturals\u2014and of the men he was fairly certain had gone down with it. A quick glance at his wristwatch told him it was just a few minutes after eight, and he was momentarily surprised. His Bastille Day had begun six hours earlier and 250 miles to the northwest in the relative safety of rural Sussex, and had already been filled with myriad sights, sensations, and emotions with which he hadn\u2019t even begun to grapple. There would be time later to deal with all that, he told himself, because the most important thing now was to move, as fast and as far as possible.\n\nAfter taking a quick look at his escape map, Joe decided on a northeast bearing toward the Iton River. He had just started walking when a middle-aged French woman appeared ahead, obviously as surprised to see him as he was to see her. The woman peered at Joe for a moment, taking in the fleece-lined pants and jacket he was still wearing, then cautiously motioned him forward. She spoke for a moment in quick French, the only word of which Joe understood was \u201cAmericain.\u201d He nodded his head enthusiastically, repeating the word while at the same time pulling from his jacket pocket the small box of escape aids and the zippered purse. The woman seemed to take these as proof of his nationality, and as she turned to walk back the way she\u2019d come she gestured for Joe to follow her.\n\nA few minutes\u2019 walk brought the pair to what was apparently the woman\u2019s home, set back in a clearing, and after standing quietly for a moment to ensure that no one was nearby, she gestured for Joe to follow her inside. She pantomimed eating, and when Joe smiled and nodded the woman set a large slice of rough dark bread and a mug of milk on the long table that dominated the room. After finishing the impromptu meal, the airman gestured his thanks and, when it became clear the woman could offer no further help, he walked to the door. Pointing to a small barn on the other side of the yard, Joe rested his head on his hands as if sleeping. The woman nodded her assent, and within a few moments Joe was stretched out on the barn\u2019s hay-covered floor. He hadn\u2019t really intended to sleep, only while away the time until dark, but the morning\u2019s exertions ensured that drowsiness soon overtook him. As he drifted off, he could hear the sound of German fighters circling the funeral pyre of Salty\u2019s Naturals.\n\nOver the following weeks Joe Cornwall would be helped by the French resistance and hunted by the Gestapo. His story, and that of the woman who came to love him\u2014and who would face her own harrowing ordeal in a Nazi concentration camp\u2014is told in Stephen Harding\u2019s Escape from Paris.
