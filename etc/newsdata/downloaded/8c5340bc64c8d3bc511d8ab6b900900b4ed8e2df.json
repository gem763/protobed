While this is expensive, Parkers worked out it'd do 32 miles for every pound you put in it, giving you more pedal for your metal than a Ford Fiesta\n\nThe editor of Parkers, Keith Adams, said: 'We created miles per pound as a way of demystifying the running costs of electric vehicles because above and beyond their range, and how long they take to charge, there is little uniformity in how carmakers express just how much energy these cars use.\n\n'Taking fuelling costs into account, monthly costs for internal combustion engine cars and electric vehicles are much closer than the gap in list price might suggest.\n\n'While it's easy to be put off at the price of an electric car, when you look at it from a monthly costs perspective the prospect is all the more attractive.\n\n'The running costs are low, there is zero road tax and, from next year, zero company car tax, too.'", "description": "Some of Britain's most efficient electric cars can travel up to three times the distance of petrol or diesel rivals for the same amount of money, according to new research.", "authors": ["George Nixon For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
