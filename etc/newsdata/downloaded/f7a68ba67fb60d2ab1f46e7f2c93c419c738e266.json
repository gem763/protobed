His leaks included classified documents that put our national security at risk, our military and the lives of spies and diplomats at risk.\u201d\n\nAnderson, meanwhile, countered by asking McCain how many people America\u2019s national security has \u201ckilled innocently\u201d compared to WikiLeaks, prompting a moderate round of applause from the audience, including a whoop from one man.\n\n\u201cOh calm down, sir!\u201d McCain sneered back at the man.\n\nAfter Anderson contended that Assange has exposed war crimes and they need to be punished, she was challenged by the rest of the panel over her boyfriend\u2019s role in the 2016 election and whether she believed he was purposely helping Donald Trump win. Besides asserting that Assange isn\u2019t a Trump supporter and would have exposed information damaging to Trump if he had it, Anderson also insisted that Assange never put anybody at risk.\n\n\u201cHe put people in danger by refusing to redact sensitive information including Social Security numbers and other private material,\u201d liberal co-host Joy Behar noted, causing Anderson to say The New York Times and others did the same thing.\n\nAt the end of the segment, after Anderson said Assange isn\u2019t meddling in other countries\u2019 politics and is merely a \u201cpublisher\u201d that \u201csupports whistleblowers,\u201d McCain got in one final parting shot.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a cyberterrorist. I\u2019ll say it! I\u2019ll say it!\u201d McCain shouted towards the crowd. \u201cI\u2019m not going to stand by this. It\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d\n\nThe segment concluded, meanwhile, with co-host Abby Huntsman saying they were going to have a \u201clittle bit of fun\u201d with Anderson after the commercial break as McCain grumbled and sat with her arms crossed.", "description": "\u201cHe hacked information.
