Michael McCaul, the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee and a co-sponsor of the resolution, said the pullout has stained America's reputation as a dependable partner.\n\n\"We told them: 'Trust us. We have your back',\" McCaul said on the House floor minutes before the vote. \"And what is happening now? The Kurds are being slaughtered as I speak in northern Syria.\"\n\nHouse Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., called Trump's action \"shameful\" and potentially harmful to the United States.\n\n\"It just opened the door for ISIS to reclaim some power,\" Hoyer said. \"Any terrorist attack they now take will be as a direct result of this action.\"\n\nThe president tweeted last week that ISIS has been completely defeated and \"it is time for us to get out of these ridiculous Endless Wars, many of them tribal, and bring our soldiers home.\" In addition, Trump has downplayed the alliance with the Kurds, saying they did not fight alongside the United States in World War II.\n\nTrump returned to that theme in a long exchange with reporters in the Oval Office on Wednesday, saying that the Kurds are \u201cnot angels\u201d and describing his decision to withdraw U.S. troops from the region as \u201cstrategically brilliant.\u201d The president dismissed reports that Russia had already moved into territory abandoned by the U.S. military.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not our problem,\u201d Trump told reporters in the Oval Office, hours before Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo were set to travel to Turkey to try to negotiate a ceasefire and avoid a humanitarian crisis.\n\nTrump's Syria policy has created a rare rift with many of his allies in Congress who have denounced the move both as the betrayal of a key ally and a naive strategy that will allow ISIS to reform and wreak havoc.\n\nPresident Donald Trump in October 2019. More\n\nRep. John Shimkus, a conservative Illinois Republican and former Army veteran said the president's troop withdrawal undermines the nation's values.\n\n\"Walking away from friends is the sad indication of a policy that we don't want to support,\" he said on the floor. \"Yes, we want America to be great. But we're also great because of our friends and our allies.\"\n\nMore: Syria chaos poses new political perils for Trump by uniting Democratic and GOP lawmakers against him\n\nThe policy difference comes at a sensitive time for Trump as he tries to rally GOP support on Capitol Hill during an impeachment inquiry led by the Democratic-controlled House.\n\n\"He needs those Republican senators to fight for him,\" said Alex Conant, a GOP strategist and former aide to Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio. \"And that\u2019s hard to do when they\u2019re fighting with him on Syria.\"\n\nThe resolution, supported by Republicans and Democrats in both chambers of Congress, calls for Turkey to end its assault in northern Syria against the Kurds, voices opposition to end \"United States efforts to prevent Turkish military operations against Syrian Kurdish forces in Northeast Syria\" and calls on the U.S. to both protect the Kurds and support the communities now being affected due to the assault.", "description": "The House voted Wednesday afternoon on a bipartisan resolution condemning President Donald Trump's decision to move U.S. troops out of Syria.", "authors": ["Christal Hayes", "Ledyard King", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/4RpuVVD3l5RSKUOwgtuTUQ--~B/aD0yNjQwO3c9MzgwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/ffc1a51eb02ea9a97dc11b5bd0ae0999", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
