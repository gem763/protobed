While the government has said plans to split Eskom into three operating units and reorganize its debt will be announced by the end of October, as will a new CEO, the cabinet didn\u2019t mention the issues in a statement issued Thursday.\n\nThe cabinet is due to meet again on October 31, two days after Finance Minister Tito Mboweni is scheduled to release his mid-term budget that should spell out how he\u2019ll fund a three-year, R128bn bailout for Eskom. Investors are looking for greater urgency to be shown in getting the company, considered the biggest threat to Africa\u2019s most industrialized economy, back on track.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe main concern of all foreign investors is to fix Eskom,\u201d said Colin Coleman, CEO of sub-Saharan Africa at Goldman Sachs. \u201cWe expect a phase of stabilization of Eskom in terms of governance, operations and finances to come in by the end of the year, following which a corporate restructure will start.\u201d\n\nEskom has shed 2,000 megawatts of power from the grid since Wednesday. No more power cuts are expected after Friday, Chairman Jabu Mabuza told reporters late Thursday in Johannesburg.\n\nPower shortages in the first quarter contributed to South Africa\u2019s biggest economic contraction in a decade and the central bank expects the growth rate to reach just 0.6% this year - a forecast that may prove optimistic given the resumption of outages. The cuts could cost South Africa its last investment-grade credit rating from Moody\u2019s Investors Service, which is due to deliver its next assessment on November 1.\n\nEskom has amassed R450bn of debt, and the government needs to work out a mechanism to take as much as 250 billion rand of that off the utility\u2019s balance sheet, according to Coleman. Eskom\u2019s management said in a presentation in August that one option was to move most of the debt onto the government\u2019s balance sheet.\n\nThe bailouts allocated to Eskom will be sufficient to keep it afloat until the end of next year as work continues on its restructuring, Deputy President David Mabuza told lawmakers in Cape Town on Thursday. Measures to fund the aid include reprioritizing and curbing expenditure, including reducing the state wage bill, he said.\n\nMineral Resources and Energy Minister Gwede Mantashe will on Friday unveil the Integrated Resource Plan, a blueprint that will set out the country\u2019s planned energy mix for the next decade, but won\u2019t address Eskom\u2019s current woes.\n\n\u201cThe power sector is very big, very complex, and the technology is changing quickly,\u201d said Andrew Canter, chief investment officer at Cape Town-based Futuregrowth Asset Management, South Africa\u2019s biggest specialist fixed-income money managers. \u201cThe fact that choices affect jobs and some industries, and that we start with a R450bn debt hole at Eskom, makes restructuring a challenge. I\u2019d rather the government takes their time to gather research, get a vision and make an executable plan, rather than rush to half-answers.\u201d\n\nREAD: Load shedding downgraded to stage 1 as problem units recover\n\nEven if agreement can be reached on how to stabilize Eskom\u2019s finances and overhaul its organizational structure, a quick fix to the nation\u2019s immediate electricity crisis, which has brought businesses to a standstill and caused traffic snarl-ups, may remain elusive.\n\nThe company lost more than a quarter of its 47,000-megawatt generating capacity last weekend due to unplanned breakages, including boiler leaks and mechanical problems with a conveyor belt at its new Medupi coal-fired plant. Some of the leaks have already been fixed, while the conveyor belt should be repaired by the end of the month, according to Jan Oberholzer, Eskom\u2019s chief operating officer.\n\n\u201cWe have a maintenance plan that we are following, and we are actually ahead in terms of our planned maintenance targets,\u201d he said by phone. \u201cIt will take 18 to 24 months to fix the system entirely.\u201d\n\nMabuza, the Eskom chairman, said the utility had begun rebuilding emergency diesel and water supplies, which should ease constraints, but not resolve them.\n\nThe power cuts were needed \u201cto balance supply and demand and protect the system from total collapse,\u201d he said. \u201cThe system remains constrained and vulnerable.\u201d", "description": "Eskom, which has been without a permanent chief executive officer since August, is so cash-strapped it can\u2019t service its debt and properly maintain aging plants.", "authors": ["Minutes Ago - Loni Prinsloo", "Mike Cohen"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7007/78e0044a9afd451db002c2232324473d.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
