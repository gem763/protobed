But Richard excused these compromises as necessary evils, asserting that such moves were made to make Pied Piper a reality. Once the company triumphed, it could return to a clean moral slate.\n\nRead: \u2018Silicon Valley\u2019 explores the darker side of the industry\n\nIf the earlier seasons of Silicon Valley satirized the absurdity of the tech bubble by examining how quickly a start-up can rise and fall (and rise again), the sixth season appears to be targeting morality in the industry. Richard faces a question real-life companies have had to tackle after reaching the top: Is it possible for a successful tech company to actually do good?\n\nIt\u2019s a heavy question for a comedy to pose, but the premiere offered a few answers. Richard could follow the lead of Gavin Belson (Matt Ross), the CEO of the show\u2019s Google proxy Hooli, and forget ethics entirely. In the episode, Gavin eschewed morals in favor of stroking his own ego. Instead of losing the Hooli name in the company\u2019s sale to Amazon, he downsized, sacrificed entire divisions, and laid off scores of employees. So if Richard were to think like Gavin, he\u2019d keep Colin on board and pivot to a new set of values to upkeep.\n\nOr Richard could do nothing for now, as his brain trust\u2014including Monica (Amanda Crew), Gilfoyle (Martin Starr), and Dinesh (Kumail Nanjiani)\u2014advised him. They pointed out that Colin\u2019s large user base is too valuable and that he\u2019s not using the data to sell ads, so his data mining is relatively harmless. But Richard dismissed their concerns; he\u2019s not about to wait until Colin utilizes user data for more nefarious reasons before stepping in. \u201cIt goes against everything we stand for,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we start collecting personal data just for the good stuff, next thing we know, we\u2019re fucking Facebook.\u201d\n\nThis being Silicon Valley, Richard then tried to sidestep the issue entirely by creating a third, especially foolish option. Rather than cutting out Colin or sitting idly by, he concocted a plan to have Colin taste his own medicine. Richard collected audio recorded off Colin\u2019s headset\u2014including snippets of Colin snorting coke, among other reckless acts\u2014and categorized them by indiscretion. Colin, Richard assumed, would be forced to obey his order. But Colin didn\u2019t bristle at the audio; he was impressed by Richard\u2019s categorization and pitched the tool to investors to demonstrate how they could compile user data for more than just game-play improvement.\n\nRichard had justified violating Colin\u2019s privacy in the episode\u2019s most hilariously upsetting scene. He\u2019d approached Jared (Zach Woods) with the plan, knowing that Jared\u2014usually the most ethically minded member of his inner circle\u2014would probably talk him out of it and brainstorm another possible solution. At first, Jared did, advising Richard to remain \u201cvirtuous,\u201d but then Jared reversed course. \u201cEven if this is wrong,\u201d he said, \u201cI suppose you can argue that it\u2019s wrong in the service of rightness.\u201d Encouraged, Richard agreed: \u201cIt\u2019s unethical in the defense of ethics, unjust in the quest for justice.\u201d", "description": "The HBO satire\u2019s final season began by examining whether the tech industry can ever really live up to its ideals.", "authors": ["Shirley Li"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/e1a704a83e9bf63e9ae417d980d582aad966be66b86c9dc08c36c037b88678b5b12cec1508c8fda9de57523bf8f57252/facebook.jpg?1572274219", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
