Chappelle then suggests that, if he were a pedophile, the child he\u2019d most want to assault (he uses a four-letter word instead) is Macaulay Culkin. These hostile comments are often bookended with a smug reference to Chappelle\u2019s own characteristic brazenness, as if to distance the comic from any standard of civil discourse and instead deflect that responsibility onto viewers. \u201cIf you\u2019re at home watching this shit on Netflix,\u201d he laughs at one point, \u201cremember, bitch, you clicked on my face!\u201d\n\nRead: The leaked Louis C.K. set is tragedy masked as comedy\n\nSticks and Stones is, of course, a production from a man long known for his provocative material\u2014and it\u2019s possible that barbs about difficult topics could serve as a balm for some people. But with the exception of a few jokes about his children participating in active-shooter drills, Chappelle doesn\u2019t spend much of the special attempting to apply humor with the kind of incision he once did. He seems entirely uninterested in punching up\u2014partly because it doesn\u2019t seem that many people are above him anymore. The special\u2019s few standout spots occur when Chappelle offers asides reflecting on his own wealth or his previous financial hardships. But, taken alongside the rest of his material, even these moments reveal the comic\u2019s sense that everything could be taken away from him at any time.\n\nChappelle also stops short of considering the consequences of his past work\u2014even when explicitly referencing times when he was asked to do so. The Culkin remark, for example, serves as a transition to discussing R. Kelly, whose guilt Chappelle says he would bet money on. But rather than reflect on his infamous Chappelle\u2019s Show sketches about the singer, which made a mockery of the specific fetish act Kelly was alleged to have forced a teenage girl to perform, Chappelle pivots to criticizing the Surviving R. Kelly filmmaker dream hampton for having told press that the comedian refused to discuss his sketches in her documentary. He lambastes her for assuming he knew Kelly personally or had direct knowledge of the singer\u2019s alleged crimes. (On Twitter yesterday, hampton said that she\u2019d wanted Chappelle to comment on his early-Aughts jokes about Kelly, not on the singer\u2019s actions or personal behavior.) Again and again, Chappelle reveals his frustration with merely being asked to weigh the real-world ramifications of art, comedy included.\n\nSticks and Stones registers as a temper tantrum, the product of a man who wants it all\u2014money, fame, influence\u2014without much having to answer to anyone. In this, the special extends the egocentric logic evinced by Aziz Ansari in his recent Netflix special. Though Chappelle has not faced allegations of sexual misconduct like those that C.K. and Ansari addressed with varying degrees of contrition, his work feels deeply informed by the other celebrities\u2019 public reckonings. The special\u2019s epigraph is a quote from the rapper Kendrick Lamar\u2019s bombastic 2017 track \u201cDNA.,\u201d which also effectively serves as Chappelle\u2019s walk-on music: \u201cTell me somethin\u2019 / you mothafuckas can\u2019t tell me nothin\u2019 / I\u2019d rather die than listen to you,\u201d the screen reads before Chappelle appears. The next hour proves he means it.\n\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.
