In his streamed victory press conference, blitzchung wore ski goggles and a gas mask, familiar accoutrements of the thousands protesting in the Hong Kong streets.\n\n\u00a8Liberate Hong Kong! Revolution of our time!\u00a8 blitzchung said.\n\nThe company stripped blitzchung of his prize money for the Asia-Pacific Grandmaster title and have banned him from moving on in the competition which has an ultimate prize of $500,000.\n\nIt based its move on tournament rules that prohibit, \u00a8engaging in any act that, at Blizzard\u00b4s sole discretion, brings you into public disrepurt, offends a portion or group of the public, or otherwise damages Blizzard image.\u00a8\n\nThe company\u00b4s decision to support China\u00b4s Communist dictators rather than Hong Kong residents comes on the heels of the NBA\u00b4s denouncing a Houston Rockets executive\u00b4s support of the protestors.\n\nChina had said it would suspend NBA broadcasts after the tweet, since deleted, from Rockets general manager Daryl Morey, and China\u00b4s Communist Party also stopped broadcasts of \u00a8South Park\u00a8 after the animation comedy mocked the Party\u00b4s censorious ways.\n\nBlizzard games and movies have made millions in China, and the nation remains one of the premier foreign markets for the NBA.\n\nBoth Blizzard\u00b4s and the NBA\u00b4s actions have been criticized by those who feel Western entities in particular should be aware of the remarkable freedoms that have allowed them to flourish and become rich, rather than put a short-sighted emphasis on current profit centers.\n\nort-sighted emphasis on current profit centers.\n\nThe California gaming company\u00b4s move sparked bipartisan protests from U.S. senators.\n\nFor example, Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio blasted the company on Twitter, writing \u00a8recognize what\u00b4s happening here. People who don\u00b4t live in #China must either self censor or face dismissal & suspensions. China using access to market as leverage to crush free speech globally. Implications of this will be felt long after everyone in U.S. politics today is gone.\u00a8\n\nOregon Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden then echoed that view, tweeting, \u00a8Blizzard shows it is willing to humiliate itself to please the Chinese Communist Party. No American company should censor calls for freedom to make a quick buck.\u00a8\n\nThe intense online community of gamers has also taken sides in the argument, with many users being sharply critical of Blizzard\u00b4s actions against blitzchung.\n\nOn Wednesday, signs set in stone outside Blizzard\u00b4s headquarters that carried familiar Silicon Valley buzz phrases - \u00a8think globally,\u00a8 and \u00a8every voice matters\u00a8 - had been papered over by what Twitter users said were incensed employees.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
