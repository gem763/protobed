The EU's privacy standard has been copied by others, notably in Russia, but has faced legal pushback elsewhere, including in the United States, over concerns about the right for people to access information online.\n\nDuring a legal hearing in Luxembourg last year, the search engine's lawyers had warned the judges about the harmful effects that a global ruling would have on how people could access information over the internet if Europe was allowed to extend its own privacy standards globally.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve worked hard to implement the right to be forgotten in Europe, and to strike a sensible balance between people\u2019s rights of access to information and privacy,\u201d Peter Fleischer, Google\u2019s global privacy counsel, said in a statement. \"It\u2019s good to see that the Court agreed with our arguments.\u201d\n\nThe CNIL on Tuesday acknowledged the court went against the French watchdog's analysis on territorial scope. But \u201cif the court does not grant dereferencing a global reach, it does say that dereferencing should be done at EU-level, and not only in the country of residence of the plaintiff,\u201d the privacy regulator said.\n\nIn a separate, but related ruling, the judges said that search engines like Google must remove so-called sensitive data like a person's ethnicity from search results, though should balance those requests with others' legitimate right to access information online.\n\nPrivacy vs. freedom of speech\n\n\n\nThe decision ends five years of legal wrangling after the same Luxembourg-based judges ruled in 2014 that Google and other search engines must remove links from online results if they infringed on people's privacy rights and meet other hurdles.\n\nIn the aftermath of that initial decision, the tech giant created a complex online system for people to submit requests, and the company has removed almost 1.5 million web links related to people's \"right to be forgotten\" requests over that time period, according to its latest transparency report. People in France have been some of the most active users of the service, requesting that almost 600,000 web links be removed over the last five years.\n\nFreedom of speech campaigners, though, have warned that Europe's privacy ruling would limit people's ability to access content online, and several media associations spoke out against how other countries like Russia have used the region's 'right to be forgotten' principle to clamp down domestic political dissent.\n\nIn its ruling on Tuesday, the judges said that while the ability to remove links within search results would likely have an immediate effect of those involved in making the requests, other countries do not recognize Europe's so-called right to be forgotten.\n\nThey added that people's privacy rights are not absolute, and that they must be balanced with society's wider needs to access information online.\n\n\"The balance between the right to privacy and the protection of personal data, on the one hand, and the freedom of information of internet users, on the other, is likely to vary significantly around the world,\" the judges concluded.", "description": "The Luxembourg-based judges said the region\u2019s \"right to be forgotten\" decision should not apply worldwide.", "authors": ["Mark Scott"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/8a/d7/6e29f95a41b69e13e47bb79d687f/190924-google-gty-773.jpg"}
