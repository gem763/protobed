In 2013, Schenkein, a medical oncologist, took Agios Pharmaceuticals (AGIO) public as its CEO. In a recent interview with Barron\u2019s, Schenkein, a panelist on Barron\u2019s biotech roundtable, discussed what he learned from his experience at Agios, where he remains executive chairman. Agios shares have returned more than 90% since their IPO.\n\nBarron\u2019s: What lessons can you point to from orchestrating Agios\u2019 initial public offering?\n\nDavid Schenkein: The first was the importance of leadership, and I don\u2019t just mean at the top of the organization. It is important to make sure you brought in the right team in the C-suite, and to remember that great leadership is leadership throughout the organization. A lot of people forget about that as they build their companies.\n\nThe other component of that leadership lesson is the value of communication, not just internally. When you become a public company, you\u2019re doing a lot of external communication. One of the things that I learned is the importance of having a consistent way of communicating whatever you\u2019re doing: In your communication, are you going to be conservative? Are you going to be over-promise, under-deliver? What is your thermometer going to look like?\n\nIt is really important that you set that tone early with investors. I sat down with investors on [Agios\u2019s] IPO road show and told them that we were going to be relatively conservative in the way we would announce our data. We\u2019re going to wait until we have a story to tell you so you can understand it and make an investment decision.\n\nThe third lesson is the value of culture within an organization. I see some entrepreneurs who aren\u2019t focused enough on building the appropriate culture. And that is critically important when you make that transition from private to public. If you have a consistent culture and everybody is grounded in what their north star is, and where they\u2019re going, that helps the company achieve its long-term goals.\n\nNow that you\u2019re an investor in private companies that hope to one day go public, how has this experience been helpful?\n\nAmong those of us who have done this before, we can look at potential investment opportunities, and we can look with a critical eye at, what is the team like and what is management like. We can provide a resource and help those young management teams.\n\nIt sounds like you\u2019re really focused on the management side of the early-stage biotech companies you\u2019re looking at.\n\nWhat makes a company great is going to be its management, and its culture, and, in the biotech space, its science. I\u2019ve seen plenty of fantastic investors who only wanted to talk culture and management because they knew that if that was strong, the science would play out. Those are long-term investors. Short-term investors care about the data on patient No. 7.\n\nHow do you distinguish between an early-stage company that is worth thinking about, and an early-stage company that isn\u2019t worth your time?\n\nFundamentally in our space, the first thing is the science. Do they understand the science, is it compelling, will it make a big impact for patients? I\u2019m very patient-focused, and so I want to know, is this a company that is trying to do something that will have an incremental improvement, or a big improvement on patients\u2019 lives? Both may be good investment opportunities, but that is the first thing that I focus on.\n\nAnd the second thing, I go to the quality of the team that has been assembled. You can tell if a company is over-hyping something, and if they don\u2019t really recognize how hard it is to do whatever they\u2019re setting out to do.\n\nDo people who don\u2019t understand how hard the science will be really get to the point of having a meeting with you?\n\nI\u2019ve seen companies come in with expectations of what they\u2019re going to achieve in a period of time that I view as potentially unrealistic.\n\nThanks, David.\n\nWrite to Josh Nathan-Kazis at josh.nathan-kazis@barrons.com", "description": "GV partner David Schenkein took Agios Pharmaceuticals public in 2013.
