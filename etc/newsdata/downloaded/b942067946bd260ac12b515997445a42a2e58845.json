He also suggested it would mean they couldn\u2019t stand as Conservative candidates, if and when an election comes.\n\nReferring to the move to expel former leadership candidate Rory Stewart, he said: \u201cOn this central issue, on this key question of Brexit, he chose to vote against the government and chose essentially to give control of the order paper to the opposition.\n\n\u201cIt was very clearly stated that Conservative MPs would lose the whip. Now 21 of them out of 312 \u2013 that is about six per cent \u2013 chose to vote against the government and they had the whip withdrawn. That was very clear.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI think it is a shame \u2013 a lot of them are very talented people. But you cannot have people standing as Conservative MPs when they are against the government\u2019s policy on the key issue of the day.\u201d", "description": "Boris Johnson's Brexit strategy has been left in ruins\u00a0after the prime minister suffered a humiliating and historic\u00a0defeat\u00a0over Brexit in parliament.
