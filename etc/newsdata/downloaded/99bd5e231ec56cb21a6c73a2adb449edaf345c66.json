Photo: Cole Escola and Jo Firestone.\n\nThanks to new president (and former head of Seeso) Evan Shapiro, the National Lampoon brand is getting a facelift this year, and the most exciting new project to come out of it yet is the relaunch of The National Lampoon Radio Hour in podcast form. The original comedy radio show ran from 1973-1974 and featured comedy legends like John Belushi, Gilda Radner, Harold Ramis, Christopher Guest, Michael O\u2019Donoghue, and Bill Murray, and now the Lampoon is teaming up with the Forever Dog podcast network to bring it back to the world. And the lineup of writers and performers is very, very promising.\n\nComedian and Difficult People alum Cole Escola has already signed on to perform and serve as head writer on the podcast alongside stand-up Jo Firestone, who will perform and also serve as senior writer. Joining them will be an impressive lineup of comedians from the New York alt-comedy scene: Rachel Pegram, Brett Davis, Maeve Higgins, Alex English, Lorelei Ramirez, Megan Stalter, Aaron Jackson, and Martin Urbano. The half-hour podcast will launch on Forever Dog sometime later this year ahead of National Lampoon\u2019s 50th anniversary in 2020.\n\n\u201cTwo generations ago, National Lampoon brought together a group of hungry, talented comedy geniuses to create a radio sketch show. That group became the core of SNL\u2019s legendary cast and writers, and some of the greatest comedic minds that ever lived,\u201d Shapiro said of the news. \u201cI can say with all confidence, this new cast deserves the mantle those talents created. The new show will be every bit as dangerous and subversive as the original \u2026 and far easier to get.\u201d\n\n\u201cMuch as the original cast did in \u201973, we want the new generation of Radio Hour performers to modernize the sketch format and build a show that delivers for today\u2019s incredibly savvy and engaged audiences,\u201d Forever Dog co-founders Brett Boham, Joe Cilio, and Alex Ramsey said in a statement. \u201cThere may not be a group of people on planet Earth better equipped for that task than the team we\u2019ve assembled here.\u201d\n\nEscola also threw in a statement of his own: \u201cWe\u2019ve all worked together in various capacities over the years. It\u2019s never resulted in good work, but we\u2019re hoping this time will be different.\u201d", "description": "The cast and writers of the \u2018National Lampoon Radio Hour\u2019 relaunch as a podcast is very exciting: Cole Escola, Jo Firestone, Rachel Pegram, Brett Davis, Maeve Higgins, Alex English, Lorelei Ramirez, Megan Stalter, Aaron Jackson, and Martin Urbano.", "authors": ["Megh Wright"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/19/19-national-lampoon-radio-hour.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
