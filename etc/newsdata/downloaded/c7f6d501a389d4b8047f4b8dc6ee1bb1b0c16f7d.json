REUTERS/David Gray\n\nMELBOURNE (Reuters) - Further interest rate cuts by the Reserve Bank of Australia would do little to boost the economy as the power of monetary policy easing is limited, a former governor of the bank told the Weekend Australian on Saturday.\n\nThe RBA this week cut its benchmark rate for the third time this year to a record low 0.75%, in a bid to revive employment growth, consumer spending and inflation, and said it was prepared to cut further if needed.\n\n\u201cToo much faith is being placed in the expectation that monetary policy can do things that it can\u2019t do,\u201d Ian Macfarlane, who governed the RBA for 10 years until 2006, told the newspaper.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s done everything it can do. Once interest rates are negligible, further cuts would seem to have very little power to do anything useful.\u201d\n\nAustralia\u2019s A$1.95-trillion ($1.32-trillion) economy has grown for 28 years without a recession, but risks have grown in the past year, with growth ebbing, inflation lukewarm, the property market subdued and unemployment ticking up.\n\nMacfarlane\u2019s comments came after data showed only a modest increase of 0.4% in August retail spending, with economists saying more fiscal stimulus from the fiscally conservative government was needed to lift consumer spending.\n\nThe current era, Macfarlane said, was \u201cthe most perplexing and difficult period for monetary policy ever\u201d.", "description": "Further interest rate cuts by the Reserve Bank of Australia would do little to boost the economy as the power of monetary policy easing is limited, a former governor of the bank told the Weekend Australian on Saturday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191005&t=2&i=1437237057&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF94010", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
