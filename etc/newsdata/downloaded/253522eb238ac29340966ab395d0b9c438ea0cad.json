For real,\u201d the actress wrote in the caption of the heartwarming photo - before she went on to make some corrections about their romantic past.\n\n(Image: jeffreydeanmorgan /Instagram)\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve lived as husband and wife for a decade... For years, publications have reported that we got married in 2014 or 2015 and that I\u2019ve been married and divorced before. All untrue,\u201d she declared.\n\n\u201cBut WE knew our truth. So it felt silly to try and correct anything,\u201d she added.\n\nHer post began by stating: \u201cThis past weekend was the best of my entire life. There are dozens of thank yous I need to make. So bear with me over the next week as I gush over the amazing group of people who gave us this beautiful moment.\u201d\n\nThe actress went on: \u201cHere\u2019s the God\u2019s honest fact: From the moment I met @jeffreydeanmorgan, he was my husband. Rather than make vows right out of the gate, we lived them. For over ten years. The good times and the bad.\u201d\n\n(Image: SplashNews.com)\n\nShe continued: \u201cStanding up there with our children at our sides - celebrating all that has been - was bliss.\u201d\n\nShe then gushingly added: \u201cI love you Jeffrey. I love our intimate group of friends and family who joined us. I love the various circles of loved ones who have supported us over the years. It was private and magical and everything I dreamed. So yeah. I\u2019m Mrs. Morgan.\u201d\n\nShe then added a date to confirm the marriage had taken place on Saturday 5 October.\n\nMeanwhile Jeffrey shared more images and gushing commentary on his own Instagram feed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d say words... but there aren\u2019t any. Mrs Morgan.... I love you. Thank you for making me the luckiest man in the world,\u201d he wrote as he shared a photo of him with his wife gazing over the side of a building.\n\n(Image: \u00c2\u00a9 AMC Film Holdings LLC.

It was an intimate ceremony... performed by @jensenackles and @bigbaldhead with our kids at our sides... and the party of the century afterwards... thank you to all our friends and family. It was, without a doubt... the best day of our lives. Ever ever. Just never knew that it could be so damn perfect. It was. And more.\u201d\n\nJeffery and Hilarie have son who was born in March 2010 and a daughter born in March 2018.\n\nJeffery has been married to actress Anya Longwell between 1992 and 2003 - while Hilarie was believed to have been married to Ian Prange between 2004 and 2009.", "description": "The American television star made One Tree Hill actress Hilarie Burton his lawfully wedded wife on Saturday", "authors": ["Mirror .Co.Uk", "Image", "Jeffreydeanmorgan", "Instagram", "Splashnews.Com", "\u00c2", "Amc Film Holdings Llc.
