What began as demonstrations following a proposed extradition law has since grown to include calls for a more democratic Hong Kong, as well as the resignation of Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam.\n\nThe former British colony was reintegrated into China back in 1997 in a deal between London and Beijing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPolice arrested 63 demonstrators at the Mong Kok, Yau Ma Tei and Prince Edward subway stations Saturday night, with the youngest offender being a 13-year-old alleged to be in possession of two gasoline bombs.\n\nSimilar gasoline bombs, as well as bricks and rocks, were thrown at police officers as well as onto the train tracks that lead to the city\u2019s airport.\n\nMTR Corp. announced it had suspended train service to the airport after several hundred protesters gathered there, where they smashed light fixtures and opened a fire hose valve causing water to pour out into the station.\n\nMeanwhile, another group of demonstrators blocked buses as they arrived at the airport, with officers in riot gear eventually clearing them from the terminal.\n\nShortly thereafter, the protesters set up barricades on two streets that lead to the airport before lighting those barricades on fire.\n\nImage 1 of 7 \u25bc Firemen try to douse fire after protesters set fire to barricades and vandalized signages at Tung Chung near airport in Hong Kong, Sunday, Sept.1, 2019.

The proposed extradition bill at the center of the protests is a piece of legislation that would allow for criminal suspects in Hong Kong to be sent to the mainland, with it\u2019s far more draconian Communist court system.\n\nLater on Sunday, a separate group of about 200 protesters converged on the British Consulate in Hong Kong in an effort to pressure them to grant British citizenship to people born China before it took back the former colony.\n\nThus far, London has only offered \"British National Overseas\" passports to those born in Hong Kong prior to 1997, which can only be used for traveling in the United Kingdom and not permanent residency.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "Protesters in Hong Kong disrupted airline travel after destroying a nearby train station, as well as blocking buses and roads that lead to the airport.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/AP19244247683692.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"}
