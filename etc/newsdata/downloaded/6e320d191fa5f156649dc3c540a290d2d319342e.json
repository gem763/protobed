A combined 89 per cent said they view a good transatlantic relationship as \u2018very important\u2019 (61 per cent) or \u2018somewhat important\u2019 (28 per cent).\n\nAreas where Americans hope to see better cooperation include security and defence, economic partnerships, improved diplomatic ties, and cultural exchanges.\n\nI can\u2019t say it enough \u2013 our BIGGEST Foreign Direct Investor is the United Kingdom and over 1.2m jobs in \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 are connected to -owned firms!

The President and his representatives have said that the U.S. is looking to \u201cdeepen and expand\u201d its relationship with the UK, including a bilateral free trade deal.\n\nIn July, President Trump revealed that his team was working on an agreement that could result in trade \u201cthree to four or five times what we\u2019re doing\u201d.\n\nLast month, Prime Minister Boris Johnson spoke with American business leaders, saying that after shaking off excessive EU regulations, Brexit Britain will become a more attractive destination for foreign investment.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to take advantage of all the freedoms that Brexit can give whether it\u2019s new tax allowances for businesses or speedier public procurement contracts or creating new free ports, enterprise zones, devising better regulations for sectors the UK leads the world [\u2026 and] more competitive tax rates,\u201d Prime Minister Johnson had said.\n\nEurocrats fear a UK diverging from the EU and developing closer trade links with the U.S., with France saying it is concerned about the UK becoming a \u201ctax haven\u201d at \u201cthe gates of Europe\u201d.\n\nRemainer Tony Blair said that the UK\u2019s wish to become more competitive would stop the country from staying closely aligned to the EU at the end of the transition period. Evoking a new phase of Project Fear, the globalist-progressive said on Sunday: \u201cEurope is now on notice from Britain and its ministers that Britain wants Brexit to compete around tax and regulation, to become an off-shore competitor with the European Union.\n\n\u201cWhat is absolutely clear is that Europe is not going to have that. They\u2019re going to say to the UK side \u2014 this is why this negotiation is going to be very ugly and very difficult \u2014 they\u2019re going to say, \u2018No, we\u2019re not giving you tariff-free access to our markets if you\u2019re going to start using a whole lot of competitive tax and regulatory measures in order to undercut us\u2019.\u201d", "description": "Most Americans back a trade deal with Britain, while 58% believe the Special Relationship is more important now than it was five years ago.", "authors": ["Victoria Friedman"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Boris-Johnson-Donald-Trump-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
