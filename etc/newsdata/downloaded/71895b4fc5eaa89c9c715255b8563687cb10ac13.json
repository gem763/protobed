Meanwhile, NBCUniversal\u2019s (CMCSA) new Peacock service is set to host \u201cSaved by the Bell\u201d and \u201cBattlestar Galactica\u201d revivals.\n\nAccording to Variety, Amazon sealed the deal with \u201cFleabag\u2019s\u201d Phoebe Waller-Bridge in an exclusive contract with Amazon Studios worth $20 million per year. The news follows Waller-Bridge\u2019s successful Emmys run, where \u201cFleabag\u201d captured six statuettes for its second season.\n\nMeanwhile, Apple is hoping A-list pros like Stephen Spielberg and Oprah Winfrey can deliver content to surpass the competition. The company already revealed its plans to spend $6 billion on original programming ahead of its highly anticipated November launch.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just content creators cashing in. Media powerhouses are shelling out big bucks to land old favorites, in a bid to compete for viewer nostalgia.\n\nLast month, Netflix snagged the global streaming rights to \u201890s sitcom \u201cSeinfeld\u201d in a reported deal worth over $500 million. The so-called \u201cshow about nothing\u201d represented a crucial win for the company after it lost both \u201cFriends\u201d and \u201cThe Office\u201d to rival competitors.\n\nMeanwhile, HBO Max (T) landed a reported multi-billion dollar deal for \u201cThe Big Bang Theory,\u201d according to sources from \u201cThe Hollywood Reporter\u201d\n\n\n\nAlexandra Canal is a Producer at Yahoo Finance.\n\nRead more:", "description": "Platforms are shelling out serious cash as the streaming wars escalate.", "authors": ["Alexandra Canal"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/bC_l1_q7SJ0uNUxSDK6kWQ--~B/aD0yNjY1O3c9NDAyNDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/87a4d8b0-e551-11e9-af83-d260a5f00ba0", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
