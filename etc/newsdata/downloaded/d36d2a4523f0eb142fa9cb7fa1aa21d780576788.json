Once it felt better, said Melbourne Zoo\u2019s head of veterinary services, Dr Michael Lynch, it began to eat with gusto.\n\n\u201cOnce it got going it really stacked on the weight, a huge appetite,\u201d Lynch said. \u201cIt was eating 20-25% of its own bodyweight per day. That would be like an 80kg person eating 20kg of food a day. It\u2019s quite amazing how much food it could pack down.\u201d\n\nHuman-sized penguin fossil discovered in New Zealand Read more\n\nOnce the penguin had returned to a healthy weight \u2013 they are usually about 3.5kg \u2013 it was sent to Phillip Island Nature Parks to build up its swimming muscles in their larger pools, ready for the journey home to New Zealand.\n\nIt was released this month after eight weeks\u2019 recuperation.\n\n\u201cWe are hoping that it will get back to New Zealand and breed,\u201d Lynch said. \u201cWe put a microchip into the bird so if it does turn up back in New Zealand one day and someone reads that microchip we will be very happy.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The penguin is released back into the wild at Phillip Island.
