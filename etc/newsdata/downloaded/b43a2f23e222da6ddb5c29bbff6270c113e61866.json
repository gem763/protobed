It cited testimony from a July congressional hearing describing a presentation to children in a school where a Juul representative described the company\u2019s e-cigarettes as \u201ctotally safe.\u201d\n\nThe FDA and the Federal Trade Commission are investigating Juul\u2019s marketing practices, as are several state attorneys general, amid a surge in vaping among teenagers. The FDA Monday said Juul hadn\u2019t been forthcoming in producing the documents the agency had requested, noting that the company had turned over records to a congressional subcommittee that it hadn\u2019t provided to the FDA.\n\n\u201cWe are reviewing the letters and will fully cooperate,\u201d a Juul spokesman said.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Should regulators restrict e-cigarette sales to curb youth vaping or encourage their use by adult cigarette smokers looking to switch? Join the conversation below.\n\nThe House Subcommittee on Economic and Consumer Policy, in a July hearing, heard testimony from two teenagers who said that a Juul representative had given a presentation in their high school and told them that Juul\u2019s e-cigarettes were \u201c99% safer than cigarettes.\u201d\n\nThat and other testimony at the hearing \u201crevealed Juul engaged in a wide variety of promotional activities and outreach efforts to persuade potential customers, including youth, to use Juul products,\u201d Mitch Zeller, director of the FDA\u2019s Center for Tobacco Products, wrote in a letter sent Monday requesting more documents from Juul. \u201cWitnesses testified, for example, that Juul advertising saturated social media channels frequented by underage teens and that Juul used influencers and discount coupons to attract new customers.\u201d\n\nMr. Zeller asked Juul to provide additional information on its youth-prevention efforts, including a $134,000 grant from Juul for a summer program at a Baltimore charter school for which the school agreed to provide Juul with students\u2019 surveys, journals and activity logs, according to evidence gathered by the subcommittee.\n\nJuul has said that it ended its youth-prevention program in September 2018 \u201cafter its purpose\u2014to educate youth on the dangers of nicotine addiction\u2014was clearly misconstrued.\u201d\n\nThe FDA requested information on Juul\u2019s outreach to Native American tribes, veterans groups and health insurers. It also asked for more details on Juul\u2019s use of social-media influencers and affiliate marketing.\n\nRelated Video Altria, the maker of Marlboro cigarettes, recently invested almost $13 billion in e-cigarette company Juul.

It also voluntarily stopped selling in bricks-and-mortar stores the sweet and fruity flavors that health officials say are appealing to young people. Juul says it has never marketed to teens.\n\nMr. Zeller\u2019s letter was accompanied by an official warning letter from the agency. Among the violations it cited was a \u201cLetter from the CEO\u201d posted last year on Juul\u2019s website, saying that the company\u2019s e-cigarettes \u201cdeliver smokers the satisfaction that they want without the combustion and the harm associated with it.\u201d The same message was sent in an email to a parent who complained that Juul had sold products to her child, the FDA said.\n\nJuul has said that it intends to file an application to the agency to market its products as less harmful than cigarettes, but hasn\u2019t yet done so.\n\n\u2014Dave Sebastian contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Jennifer Maloney at jennifer.maloney@wsj.com", "description": "Juul Labs has wrongfully marketed its electronic cigarettes and liquids as being safer than traditional cigarettes, the Food and Drug Administration said.", "authors": ["Jennifer Maloney", "Jennifer.Maloney Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-105270/social", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
