Biden.\n\n\u201cThe conversation was absolutely perfect,\u201d Mr. Trump told White House reporters as he departed for an event in Texas.\n\nMr. Trump reportedly urged Mr. Zelensky \u201cabout eight times\u201d to cooperate with his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani on investigating Mr. Biden\u2019s son, Hunter Biden, over an alleged nexus between his business work and the vice president\u2019s push to oust a Ukrainian prosecutor in 2016, Wall Street Journal reported Friday.\n\nMr. Trump brushed off the reports, saying he would have \u201cno problem\u201d with Mr. Giuliani testifying to Congress about his recent meetings with Ukrainians.\n\nA whistleblower filed a formal complaint about Mr. Trump\u2019s call on July 25, sparking a firestorm in Washington as the White House opposes efforts to turn over the complaint and transcripts to Congress.\n\nThe inspector general for the U.S. intelligence community who received the complaint deemed it a credible and urgent matter, yet acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire won\u2019t turn over the complaint to lawmakers.\n\nDemocrats say if Mr. Trump used the presidency to press a foreign nation to dig up dirt on his opponent, it will have serious ramifications that may include impeachment.\n\nThey are especially concerned that Mr. Trump held up $250 million in military aid to Ukraine as way to entice investigations into Mr. Biden. The aid was eventually released on Sept. 12.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he was in conversations about Ukrainian aid and no one tied it to the Bidens.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have any reason to believe the president pressured [a foreign leader],\u201d Mr. Mnuchin told CNN\u2019s State of the Union, later adding: \u201cThere\u2019s lots of people who listened to this call.\u201d\n\nHe said the president shouldn\u2019t be forced to turn over details of the call, saying the White House has a right to confidentiality when it conducts foreign relations.\n\nMr. Trump said pressure should be on the vice president to explain himself, pointing to Mr. Biden\u2019s claim he never spoke about business with his son.\n\n\u201cHe did speak to his son, he lied again,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\n\nMr. Trump is scheduled to meet with Mr. Zelensky next week at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.\n\nThe president said he does not intend to meet with Iranian leaders in New York, however, amid simmering tensions in the Middle East.\n\n\u201cNothing is ever off the table but I have no intention of meeting with Iran,\u201d Mr. Trump said Sunday.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
