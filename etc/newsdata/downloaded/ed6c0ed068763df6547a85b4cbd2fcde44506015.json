Guyger is accused of shooting and killing Botham Jean, an unarmed 26-year-old neighbor, in his own apartment last year. She told police she thought his apartment was her own and that he was an intruder. (Tom Fox/Pool/Dallas Morning News/AP)\n\nOn the fifth day of her murder trial, Amber Guyger told a packed courtroom that Botham Jean was already dying by the time she realized she made a mistake.\n\nIt was the first time the public heard from Guyger since the former Dallas police officer walked into the apartment above hers, thinking it was her own, and shot and killed Jean, her 26-year-old upstairs neighbor.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s when everything, it just started to spin,\u201d Guyger said, recounting the night of Sept. 6, 2018, when she fired two bullets at a man she said she thought was burglarizing her home.\n\nBut Guyger, a white woman who had just finished a long shift at work, was on the wrong floor of the building. In a matter of seconds, prosecutors said, Jean \u2014 an unarmed black man watching TV and eating ice cream in his own apartment \u2014 was on the ground, a fatal gunshot wound in his chest.\n\n\u201cI shot an innocent man,\u201d Guyger said Friday, during hours of testimony, her sobs at times muddling her words.\n\n\u201cI wish he was the one with the gun and killed me,\u201d the 31-year-old said. \u201cI never wanted to take an innocent person\u2019s life, and I\u2019m so sorry. This is not about hate; it\u2019s about being scared.\u201d\n\n[Ex-Dallas officer to stand trial for shooting neighbor in his own apartment]\n\nIn Dallas, the shooting touched off protests and demands for police reform. Many see the case as another egregious example of a white officer killing an unarmed black man, part of a pattern of police wielding deadly force disproportionately against people of color.\n\nBut the unusual facts of this case have already made it unique among other high-profile fatal police shootings, most of which are never even prosecuted. Guyger, who was fired from the police force shortly after she killed Jean, was first arrested for manslaughter. A grand jury later indicted her on a murder charge.\n\nDuring the trial, which began Monday, her defense attorneys have argued that she made a mistake, calling it \u201cawful and tragic, but innocent.\u201d They\u2019ve said she was within her rights to shoot Jean because she believed she was in her own home, acting in self-defense. But the prosecution has argued that she was negligent \u2014 armed, distracted and too quick to draw and fire her weapon.\n\nGuyger\u2019s lawyers said she was exhausted, on autopilot as she parked on the wrong floor of her building\u2019s garage and walked down a fourth-floor hallway, one level above her third-floor unit.\n\nWhen she arrived at the apartment she thought was hers, she didn\u2019t notice it was number 1478, and not her own 1378. She didn\u2019t notice Jean\u2019s red doormat, either. Prosecutors said she wasn\u2019t paying attention, too caught up in a sexually explicit conversation she was having with her partner on the police force.\n\nOn Friday, Guyger reenacted what came next, when she went to open the apartment door. Standing at the front of the courtroom, she slung her backpack, her bulletproof vest and her lunchbox over one arm and pretended to pull her keys out of her pocket with the other.\n\nThat\u2019s when she said she first heard someone inside. She opened the door and said she saw a \u201csilhouette figure\u201d in the apartment. She drew her gun, she testified, and yelled, \u201cLet me see your hands!\u201d\n\nJean responded by shouting, \u201cHey,\u201d and walking quickly toward her, she said.\n\n\u201cI was scared he was going to kill me,\u201d she said.\n\nDuring cross-examination, lead prosecutor Jason Hermus asked Guyger if she was shooting to kill, falling back on her police training.\n\n\u201cWhen you aimed and pulled the trigger at Mr. Jean, shooting him in center mass, right where you are trained, you intended to kill Mr. Jean?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cI did,\u201d she replied.\n\nHermus also questioned why Guyger opened the door in the first place. If she suspected someone was inside, he argued, she could have taken cover and called for help.\n\n\u201cHad you done any one of those things, Mr. Jean would probably be alive today, right?\u201d Hermus asked.\n\n\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Guyger said.\n\n[A steamy chat distracted an officer when she entered the wrong apartment and killed a man, prosecutors say]\n\nThe prosecutor argued that Guyger wasn\u2019t being truthful about asking Jean to show his hands, pointing out that none of the other apartment building residents who testified said they heard her loud commands.\n\nThat, plus the bullet\u2019s downward trajectory \u2014 which, according to a medical examiner\u2019s testimony, showed Jean was shot while standing up or \u201cin a cowering position\u201d \u2014 indicated that Guyger shot without warning a man who was not threatening, prosecutors said.\n\nGuyger said she then performed CPR and a sternum rub on Jean as she called 911 and waited for medics to arrive. But the prosecution accused her of not doing enough to help, asking why she hadn\u2019t used first-aid supplies she carried with her police gear.\n\nGuyger\u2019s lawyers have argued that she knew Jean was in critical condition, beyond her ability to help, and that she thought calling for medical personnel was the best option.\n\n\u201cThe state he was in,\u201d she testified, \u201cI knew it wasn\u2019t good.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nThe Washington Post\u2019s database of fatal police shootings\n\nAn undocumented man was killed when cops went to the wrong home.
