It\u2019s widely known today as the \u201cfirst Internet connection.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. government started the ARPANET project in 1962 as a means to invest in computer research \u2014 and as a response to the Soviet Union\u2019s historic launch of the first space satellite, Sputnik, five years earlier. It was one of the first packet-switching networks and the first to use the TCP/IP protocol.\n\nMarc Weber, curatorial director of the Computer History Museum\u2019s Internet History Program, told UPI that ARPA was funding programs throughout the country at the time, but researchers were unable to log into computers at different sites.\n\n\u201cThe initial idea was just to save money and increase collaboration by having resource sharing where people at each ARPA site could log in and use the computers at other sites,\u201d he said. \u201cThe immediate need was resource sharing, the larger goal was to pioneer accessible network sharing.\u201d\n\nLimited computer networking existed at the time, but it was prohibitively expensive due to the large, custom machines of the day.\n\nKleinrock said he envisioned ARPANET could capture the \u201cspirit of community\u201d by using computers to allow people to communicate with each other, remotely.\n\nOn that day in 1969, the Kline-Duval team became the first to connect two different kinds of general-purpose computers, a pioneering moment now recognized as a milestone event in the founding of the Internet.\n\n\u201cBill and Charley were the first two users of the kind of networks we use today,\u201d Weber said. \u201cOn Oct. 29, 1969, there were two users of this general-purpose heterogeneous computer networks; now there\u2019s like 4 billion. And it went up from two exponentially for many decades until now.\u201d\n\nARPANET was decommissioned in 1990 but it laid the foundation of what would grow into the modern Internet. The World Wide Web, the information system that powers the modern Internet, was founded a year earlier by British scientist Tim Berners-Lee.", "description": "Oct. 29 (UPI) \u2014 Tuesday marks the 50th anniversary of a milestone event that helped shape the modern Internet \u2014 the first-ever computer linkup", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
