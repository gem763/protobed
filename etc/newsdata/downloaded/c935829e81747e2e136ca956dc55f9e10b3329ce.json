(Khalil Ashawi/Reuters)\n\nABC News issued a correction Monday after it aired footage from a 2017 Kentucky military demonstration in the middle of a segment on the war in Syria.\n\n\u201cThis video, obtained by ABC News, appears to show the fury of the Turkish attack on the border town of Tal Abyad two nights ago,\u201d said foreign correspondent Ian Panell during the Sunday \u201cWorld News\u201d segment.\n\nThe clip was also featured on \u201cGood Morning America\u201d on Monday morning. It depicts explosions that occurred at the Knob Creek Gun Range in West Point, Kentucky during an event called \u201cMilitary Gun Shoot and Military Gun Show.\u201d\n\n\u201cCORRECTION: We\u2019ve taken down video that aired on \u201cWorld News Tonight\u201d Sunday and \u201cGood Morning America\u201d this morning that appeared to be from the Syrian border immediately after questions were raised about its accuracy,\u201d ABC wrote in a Monday tweet. \u201cABC News regrets the error.\u201d\n\nThe error was discovered by right-wing social media users, who pointed out the similarities between the explosions in the clip and a YouTube video of the Kentucky gun show. Gizmodo first reported the error.\n\nTurkey began its invasion of northeast Syria on October 8 to carve out a \u201csafe zone\u201d where it can resettle 3.6 million refugees from the Syrian civil war, and to suppress Kurdish groups in the area it considers terrorist organizations. These groups were instrumental in the U.S.-led effort to defeat ISIS in Syria.", "description": "ABC News issued a correction Monday after it aired footage from a 2017 Kentucky military demonstration in the middle of a segment on the war in Syria.", "authors": ["Zachary Evans", "John Mccormack", "John Hirschauer", "Andrew C.
