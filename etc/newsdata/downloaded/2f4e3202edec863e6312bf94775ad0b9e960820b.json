But the enforcement is not.\n\nIf we want to tackle this abhorrent practice we need greater surveillance at ports and increased international collaboration.\n\nBeeb bashing\n\n(Image: Andrew Parsons / i-Images)\n\nBoris Johnson cannot keep passing the buck on the decision to axe free TV licences for the over 75s.\n\nThe Prime Minister stood on a manifesto promise to protect this important lifeline.\n\nNow he is trying to wriggle out of this commitment by blaming the BBC.\n\nHis tough talk about putting the screws on the station won\u2019t wash. He knows the broadcaster does not have funds to cover the cost.\n\nInstead of trying to duck his responsibility he should, for once, stick to his word and give the BBC the money it needs.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nOh no knee isn\u2019t\n\nChristopher Biggins is having pain-killing injections in his knee to see him through panto season.\n\nThe audience may be wanting the same when they hear some of his old jokes.", "description": "We need greater surveillance at ports and increased international collaboration.
