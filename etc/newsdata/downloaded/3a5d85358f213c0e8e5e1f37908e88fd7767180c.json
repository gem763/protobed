He said, \u2018We can make the quarter finals\u2019.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. Rugby World Cup 2019 kits Show all 22 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

Did they inspire people? I think everything I have seen when I have been back out here since says yes. They were the team of the World Cup. We were a lot of people\u2019s second favourite team. We didn\u2019t make the quarter finals, so we failed on the third one.\n\n\u201cBut if I played a small part in helping players achieve things they had not imagined before, memories they have for the rest of their lives; if we helped inspire kids to play rugby then I am very happy to have played a small part in that.\u201d\n\nThose three challenges apply to England too, although while they have been called on by Jones to inspire a nation and become the team of the World Cup, their aim is not to reach the quarter-finals, but to win the whole thing.\n\nWith the England backs joining Borthwick at Miyazaki Kita High School for a presentation from 1,000 school children welcoming the team to their city, it was not lost on the England coach that Japan international rugby players of the future could be sitting within the four walls of the school\u2019s assembly hall, as he remembered himself.\n\n\u201cI was 14 years old when I said, \u2018I want to play rugby for England\u2019,\u201d he added. \u201cAs a kid I would just dream of it. Our players would all have had, at some point, the same dream of playing for England. Now they are in the England squad.\n\n\u201cThere are kids back in England saying this is their dream and we have an opportunity to inspire. It is a wonderful sport and a wonderful opportunity we all have to help others. I enjoy that. If I can play a small part in that, brilliant. We will do our very best here. We have prepared well. We are excited about the tournament. It is great to be out here in Japan.\u201d\n\nFor the majority of this England squad though, their own memories are much more painful than Borthwick\u2019s. For 15 of them, they experienced a similar pool-stage exit to Japan as England recorded their worst result ever at a World Cup four years ago.\n\nIt means that they are taking nothing for granted, and even though they kick the campaign off with a four-day double-header against what should be Pool C\u2019s weakest opposition in Tonga and the United States, lock Joe Launchbury remembers how easily a planned two-month campaign can end in a matter of days.\n\n\u201cWe have talked about how quickly the tournament is going to go now,\u201d he said. \u201cYou spend such a long time building towards it and think of it as this really long seven- or eight-week tournament.\n\n\u201cWe have got two games within four days when we get out there and that is half the pool done already. We know we have got to be right bang on it from the start and although we want to keep getting better as the tournament goes on, we need to start really well. We have had some tough competition in the four warm-up games. We have played against some quality sides and that has been on purpose so that when we get out there we don\u2019t miss any opportunity because it could be over before it has started.\u201d\n\nListen to Episode Two of The Indy Rugby Podcast.", "description": "After returning to the source of Japan\u2019s greatest rugby achievement, Steve Borthwick could not help but look at the similarities between \u2018The Brighton Miracle\u2019 and England\u2019s budding campaign that he hopes will end in Rugby World Cup glory.", "authors": ["Jack De Menezes"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/11/10/steve-borthwick.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
