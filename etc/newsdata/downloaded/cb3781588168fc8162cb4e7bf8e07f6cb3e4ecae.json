According to Getty Images, it\u2019s the Weeknd attending \u201cthe Uncut Gems premiere during the 2019 Toronto International Film Festival at Princess of Wales Theatre on September 9, 2019 in Toronto, Canada.\u201d The internet would also like to throw \u201cLionel Richie,\u201d \u201cel fin de semana,\u201d \u201cthe Monday,\u201d \u201ca Key & Peele character,\u201d a DeBarge, and \u201cmy pops in the \u201980s\u201d into the pool of guesses.\n\nIt\u2019s probably the Weeknd (who is also Abel Tesfaye), but he just looks different because we haven\u2019t seen him in a while, since his second breakup with Bella Hadid last month. A source said the two resplit because \u201cthey are in different places right now, physically and mentally,\u201d which continues to be true: The Weeknd is physically in Toronto with zero beard, finally baring his jawline, chin, and upper neck to the world, while Hadid is physically in New York, the blondest we\u2019ve seen her, temporarily changing her appearance multiple times a day in the name of Fashion Week.\n\nFamous people handle their famous breakups in all sorts of ways, from wearing a $520 cashmere bra as a top, to making out with someone less famous who also recently broke up with someone not as famous. If this is the Weeknd and this is a breakup makeover, I applaud him for taking the accessible route many of us normals take: Simply removing a good chunk of hair.\n\nThough, if this is the Weeknd, this could also have nothing to do with a breakup and he\u2019s simply sending signals that he\u2019s finally ready to drop a new album, which everyone thought he was going to do way back in June when he deleted his Instagram. Sadly, like the third \u201ce\u201d we\u2019re all accustomed to typing when referencing the two days at the end of the week, the Weeknd\u2019s beard is no longer with us, so we\u2019ll probably never know the true reason behind its departure.
