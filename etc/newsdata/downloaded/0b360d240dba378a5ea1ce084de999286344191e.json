So Why Are Migrant Rescue Boats Still Being Refused Entry?", "language": "en", "text": "In late August, Italy\u2019s anti-migrant Interior Minister Matteo Salvini was ousted after his ruling coalition collapsed, bringing a symbolic end to a government whose signature policy was closing Italy\u2019s ports to ships carrying rescued migrants. But two months on, those same ships are still being stranded in the Mediterranean.\n\nOn Tuesday, 11 days after becoming the latest boat to be forced to wait stranded in the Mediterranean sea, the Ocean Viking, a rescue ship carrying 104 migrants, was finally granted access to an Italian port.\n\nIt had picked up the occupants of a rubber boat off the coast of Libya, a country that asylum seekers cannot be legally returned to because of human rights abuses. But after heading north, Italian authorities refused the Ocean Viking permission to dock\u2014in much the same way that they did to dozens of ships when Salvini was in power\u2014and only changed their position after the French, German and Italian governments agreed on a plan to resettle the migrants on board.\n\nSalvini came to power in June 2018 promising to curb migrant arrivals to Italy, where more than 119,000 people arrived by sea in 2017. \u201cItaly has been receiving and holding refugees and migrants for years, without any support from the rest of Europe,\u201d says Agnes Callamard, the U.N. Special Rapporteur for extrajudicial executions. \u201cThe problem is with the E.U. being unable to abide by its full commitment to take its share of migrants. Italians, when they elected Salvini, said enough is enough.\u201d\n\nE.U. interior ministers met in Malta in September, shortly after Salvini fell from power, to hold what were billed as potential breakthrough talks for creating an agreement between E.U. countries to share migrant arrivals, relieving the burden on Italy. An agreement was struck there, but only between four countries: Italy and Malta (both coastal countries where migrants arrive) and Germany and France, the E.U.\u2019s two central powers.\n\n\u201cThe only thing we can say, after spending 11 days at sea, is that such an agreement doesn\u2019t seem to work,\u201d Louise Guillaumat, the deputy director of SOS M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e, the NGO which operates the Ocean Viking, told TIME on Tuesday evening as the boat was on its way to the port of Pozzallo in Sicily where those on board would be disembarked.\n\n\u201cThe sad result of that is that it ended up with people dying at sea,\u201d Guillaumat says.\n\nEven though Salvini out of power, the core dispute between Italy and the rest of the E.U. on what is to be done with the migrants on board rescue ships has not been resolved. \u201cWhen a relocation agreement is settled, Italy is willing to open its ports,\u201d Guillaumat says. \u201cBut there are few E.U. member states willing to welcome people into their territory and support the coastal states\u201d of Italy and Malta.\n\nConditions for migrants in the Mediterranean have grown steadily worse since 2015. That year, more than 1 million people crossed the sea to Europe, and fewer than 0.4% drowned on the way. As numbers crossing the sea fell, largely thanks to preventative measures imposed by the E.U. and its member states, the deadliness of the journey increased. In 2019 so far, more than 1% of people making the journey have died. \u201cThe central Mediterranean is still the deadliest migration route in the world,\u201d Giullaumat says.\n\nA contributing factor has been the regular standoffs between rescue ships and European authorities, which reduces the chances of migrants in distress being saved. \u201cWaiting at sea means we are not operational any more,\u201d Giullaumat says. \u201cWhile being stuck in that standoff, we saw a lot of distress calls happening and we don\u2019t know what happened to the people. Either they died or they were sent back to Libya.\u201d\n\n\u2014 With reporting by Jasmine Aguilera/New York", "description": "Two months after anti-migrant Interior Minister Matteo Salvini was ousted, migrant rescue boats like the Ocean Viking are still stuck at sea", "authors": ["Billy Perrigo"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/xAvrmN4oygAWqiQwdM28_w--~B/aD02ODM7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/6752588813d3953f976ca892b847d9a0", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
