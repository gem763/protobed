(Patrick Semansky)\n\nDuring a Thursday night game in September 2017, Sean McVay sat on a sideline water cooler and swiped through images on a tablet. He reviewed plays from the Los Angeles Rams\u2019 previous offensive drive, neglecting the Rams\u2019 defense on the field.\n\nAt the time, the image prompted confusion and questions. McVay, 31, was in his first year as head coach. He had to explain that he wanted to prepare upcoming play-calls and had no qualms leaving Wade Phillips, his 70-year-old defensive coordinator, in total control.\n\n\u201cThat was a big deal a couple years ago when Sean first did it,\u201d said Kevin Demoff, the Rams\u2019 executive vice president of football operations. \u201cNow it is nearly commonplace.\u201d\n\nIn the two years since, McVay has morphed from novelty to prototype. As franchises have sought to hire young, innovative, offensive play-calling head coaches such as McVay, who led the Rams to last season\u2019s Super Bowl, one side effect has been the shifting demographics and responsibilities of NFL defensive coordinators. It has created a swell of experienced, overqualified defensive assistants hired to help their baby-faced bosses find their way.\n\nThis season, 14 teams employ a defensive coordinator who used to be a head coach, and 10 of them work under head coaches who call offensive plays. Many of those assistants wear the official label of defensive coordinator, but their duties are better described with an unofficial title infiltrating the NFL\u2019s lexicon: head coach of the defense. It is a job equal parts defensive play-caller, mentor and shepherd of half the roster.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the best way to go and get the most out of your entire staff,\u201d said Arizona Cardinals defensive coordinator Vance Joseph, who works under first-year coach and play-caller Kliff Kingsbury. \u201cHe can\u2019t focus on both sides of the ball and be the head coach and call the plays on offense. \u2026 It\u2019s too much in a job to do all three things. It\u2019s a natural fit.\u201d\n\n[NFL Power Rankings: Cowboys, Packers moving up]\n\nChoosing a defensive coordinator who has done his boss\u2019s job has become an oft-copied template. McVay and Phillips, who at 39 years apart could pass for father and son, popularized the arrangement. Demoff credited the Philadelphia Eagles, considered one of the league\u2019s most forward-thinking franchises, with being first.\n\nIn 2016, the Eagles hired Kansas City Chiefs offensive coordinator Doug Pederson to be their head coach and call his own offensive plays. They paired him with Jim Schwartz, who spent a year out of football after being the Detroit Lions\u2019 head coach. Shortly after hiring Schwartz, Pederson called him \u201cthe head coach on defense.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wouldn't expect him to come over on the offensive side and make suggestions, whether it be on personnel or plays or the calling or any of that,\u201d Pederson said then. \u201cSo I kind of leave [the defense] up to him.\u201d\n\n\n\nKliff Kingsbury is in his first season as head coach of the Arizona Cardinals. (Gail Burton)\n\nIn the past two hiring cycles, only five of 14 new head coaches had defensive backgrounds, which has helped create a surplus of available and highly qualified defensive coordinators. Their experience makes them a perfect match for offensive-minded head coaches who want to focus on calling plays and managing the games. They can be trusted to handle defense, and they can impart wisdom gained from sitting in the head coach\u2019s chair.\n\nKingsbury, who came to the NFL from Texas Tech, had no interest in taking on sweeping responsibilities. The Cardinals hired him to bring his offense and call plays, and to devote full focus to that, Kingsbury sought an experienced hand for the other side of the ball.\n\n\u201cI wanted somebody who was a head coach for the defense,\u201d Kingsbury said.\n\nAt practices, Kingsbury tends to hover around his quarterbacks. In the office, Kingsbury leaves the defensive game plan to Joseph, which leaves him more time to plan and install the offense each week. Kingsbury is still Joseph\u2019s boss, but they work in partnership.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s why guys hire guys who had previous head coaching experience,\u201d Joseph said. \u201cHe knows that guy who\u2019s been a head coach is going to cover every base without him having to look over your shoulder. Especially if you\u2019re a guy calling your own plays, that\u2019s tough to find two or three hours to talk game plan with a defensive guy.\u201d\n\n[The NFL's great quarterback transition is happening, and the most flexible teams will thrive]\n\nMatt Nagy, in his second season with the Bears, hired former Colts coach Chuck Pagano to run his defense this past offseason after veteran coordinator, Vic Fangio, was hired to be the Denver Broncos\u2019 head coach. He said hiring a former head coach wasn\u2019t a necessity, but it was a priority. He casts himself as only an assistant to Pagano in defensive planning, which underscores another part of the shift. NFL head coaches have long been control freaks, considered CEOs of their teams, but the new breed of offensive-minded coaches are willing to cede responsibility.\n\n\u201cYou have a guy that has been there, done that,\u201d Nagy said. \u201cThey can really take that side of the ball and run with it. \u2026 I\u2019m just kind of there to oversee it and help out in any way.\u201d\n\nExperienced defensive coordinators double as valuable resources for new coaches. Green Bay Coach Matt LaFleur, a former McVay assistant, retained Packers defensive coordinator Mike Pettine, formerly the head coach of the Browns. \u201cThe good thing is what I bring from my experience in Cleveland,\u201d Pettine joked during training camp. \u201cI have a thick book on what not to do, so I can steer him clear of some of the pitfalls of being a first-time head coach.\u201d\n\nThe partnerships have the potential for awkwardness. The coordinators have done their younger boss\u2019s job and probably would like to do it again. The head coach is fully aware former head coaches make for easy interim head coaches. McVay\u2019s self-assurance allowed him to hire Phillips.\n\n\u201cSome young coaches are afraid to hire those guys,\u201d said former Washington coach Mike Shanahan, who hired McVay as an assistant in Washington. \u201cSean is not.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo me, it\u2019s all about what kind of confidence you have in yourself as a coach,\u201d Nagy said. \u201cIf I don\u2019t have better coaches than me on a staff, then I\u2019m not a good coach. You need to surround yourself with better coaches than what you are. They go ahead and strengthen my weaknesses and I strengthen their weaknesses, and that\u2019s just how you roll.\u201d\n\nThe right personality can erase tension. Early in their partnership, Joseph told Kingsbury, \u201cListen, bro. It\u2019s your turn.\u201d He wanted Kingsbury to ask him any question he wanted \u2014 and Kingsbury picked his brain on how to maximize practice time and how leadership is different in the NFL compared to college \u2014 but Joseph was wary of pushing advice on him.\n\n\u201cYou have to as a young coach grow into the job and feel your way through it,\u201d Joseph said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want someone constantly telling you what you should be feeling or what you should be doing.\u201d\n\n\n\nLos Angeles Rams defensive coordinator Wade Phillips is given full authority over the team's defense by head coach Sean McVay. (Kevin M. Cox)\n\nEven if a team favors a defensive candidate at head coach, it faces two unwanted likelihoods for the future of its offensive coordinator: Either he will fail and the team will lose, or he will succeed and another team will poach him. The first outcome is undesirable for obvious reasons. The second outcome is barely more tenable.\n\nNFL teams are fearful of breaking up a thriving quarterback-coach relationship. Hiring an up-and-coming offensive assistant as a coordinator sounds appealing until he bolts for a head coaching job after a season or two. If your head coach already calls plays, you don\u2019t have to worry about losing the play caller your quarterback found rapport with.\n\n\u201cIf you have a good offensive mind, he\u2019s going to get hired out of here in two seconds,\u201d Bears General Manager Ryan Pace said. \u201cNow you\u2019re starting over on offense.\u201d\n\n[Sean Payton is moving the Saints past the NFC championship game no-call, but he hasn't forgotten]\n\nAtlanta Coach Dan Quinn, a former defensive coordinator, took the Falcons to the Super Bowl, but he immediately lost offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan, who became head coach of the 49ers. In the three seasons since, Quinn has cycled through two offensive coordinators without approaching the production his offense had under Shanahan. After the Vikings went to the NFC championship game two years ago, offensive coordinator Pat Shurmur left for the New York Giants. His replacement, John DeFilippo, didn\u2019t even last an entire season, and the Vikings missed the playoffs.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the toughest part for a defensive guy,\u201d Joseph said. \u201cGod willing I get another chance to do it, I have to figure out who\u2019s going to be the offensive coordinator. That\u2019s a big push to me in the interview process. You may be qualified as a defensive guy. \u2026 But if I don\u2019t bring the right offensive guy to the table, I won\u2019t get the job. You have to figure out a way to be innovative on offense.\u201d\n\nIf Joseph receives a future head coaching interview, he would come prepared not only with an offensive coordinator but a list of younger staffers who could replace that coordinator if he leaves. Joseph cited Mike Tomlin and Marvin Lewis as long-tenured defensive-minded head coaches who lasted despite frequent staff turnover on offense.\n\n\u201cIf a guy can coach the quarterback and he\u2019s calling plays, he\u2019s going to be a hot commodity,\u201d Joseph said. \u201cYou have to build your staff that way, knowing that if this guy is a good coach, he\u2019s going to probably move on in two years.\u201d\n\nAs everybody who works in the NFL is quick to say of almost every trend, the NFL is cyclical. And there is evidence defensive coaches can work. Of the six active head coaches who have won Super Bowls, four of them \u2014 Bill Belichick, Tomlin, John Harbaugh and Pete Carroll \u2014 have defensive backgrounds.\n\n\u201cUntil people start looking for a larger subset of head coaching candidates \u2026 pairing up defensive coordinators with offensive minds will be a trend that continues,\u201d Demoff said.\n\nThe current atmosphere makes it hard to imagine Joseph and his defensive brethren receiving head coaching jobs. But they can take solace in what else that means: The number of head coaches of the defense will only keep growing.\n\nMore NFL coverage:\n\nThe Scottish Hammer: How Jamie Gillan went from Scotland to an HBCU to Browns rookie standout\n\nJay Gruden doesn\u2019t think Redskins\u2019 season is over, so Dwayne Haskins will continue to wait\n\n\u2018Unlike Agholor,\u2019 Philadelphia residents catch babies thrown from burning building", "description": "As NFL teams seek young, innovative offensive head coaches, it has changed the demographics of defensive coordinators and shifted the role they play.", "authors": ["Adam Kilgore", "Reporter Covering National Sports", "Adam Kilgore Covers National Sports For The Washington Post.
