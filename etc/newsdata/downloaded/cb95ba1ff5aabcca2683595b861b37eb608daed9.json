Mylan did not admit or deny the charges that it classified EpiPen as a \"generic\" drug under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, which resulted in Mylan paying much lower rebates to the government than if EpiPen had been classified as a \"branded\" drug. Beginning in November 2014, and for nearly two years, the Department of Justice investigated whether Mylan misclassified EpiPen and thereby overcharged the government for EpiPen sales to Medicaid patients. Mylan, however, failed to disclose or accrue for the loss relating to the DOJ investigation until October 2016, when it announced a $465 million settlement with DOJ. As a result, the SEC alleged Mylan's public filings were false and misleading. Further, as alleged in the complaint, Mylan's 2014 and 2015 risk factor disclosures that a governmental authority may take a contrary position on Mylan's Medicaid submissions, when CMS had already informed Mylan that EpiPen was misclassified, were misleading.", "description": "The Securities and Exchange Commission settled charges Friday against Mylan N.V., who agreed to pay $30 million for accounting and disclosure failures...", "authors": ["Francine Mckenna"], "top_image": "https://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
