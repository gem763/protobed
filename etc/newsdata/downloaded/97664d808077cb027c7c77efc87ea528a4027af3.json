Approximately 48,000 UAW members have been on strike against GM since Sept. 16.\n\nShares of KB Home reached a year-to-date high Wednesday but slid as much as 2.75% during extended trade after the company reported mixed third-quarter earnings. The company bounced back, however, as shares recovered some of those losses, settling about 1% under the closing price. The home-builder posted an earnings beat of 73 cents per share compared to the 66 cent increase Wall Street was expecting. Revenue came in at $1.16 billion, falling shy of the $1.17 billion analysts had forecast, according to Refinitiv consensus estimates.\n\nThe company's shares dropped despite better-than-expected home deliveries and net orders. KB Home delivered 3,022 homes and its net orders rose to 3,325, while investors expected 2,948 deliveries and 3,064 net orders. The home-builder's average selling price slipped, however, reporting an average of $381,400 compared to the $398,000 analysts had anticipated, according to Refinitiv.\n\nHB Fuller shares dropped 7% after the company lowered its full-year earnings guidance. The adhesives manufacturer is expecting adjusted earnings between $2.95 and $3.05 per share, far less than the $3.17 per share increase analysts had estimated, according to Refinitiv.\n\nFor the third quarter, the company reported earnings of 86 cents per share ex-items on revenue of $725 million, compared the 90 cents per share increase and revenue of $749 million Wall Street was expecting.\n\nShares of AAR Corp popped 4% after its strong first-quarter earnings, reporting earnings of 57 cents per share ex-items and revenue of $542 million.
