USA TODAY\n\nUn-b-b-b-b-b-b-believable. Just like her onscreen TV hubby, Mark-Paul Gosselaar, Tiffani Thiessen said she was unaware of the \"Saved by the Bell\" reboot until it was announced in September.\n\n\"I don't know anything about it. I \u2013 literally, Mark-Paul and I were like, \u2018Oh, wow! I didn\u2019t know that was happening,\u2019 \" Thiessen, who played peppy cheerleader Kelly Kapowski, told Us Weekly Wednesday.\n\n\"I think because we were both on different shows, you know,\" she continued, speculating as to why they wouldn't have been approached, \"but it seems like everyone is doing a reboot these days. It\u2019s popular, I guess. I don't know.\u201d\n\nGosselaar, who portrayed the scheming Zack Morris in the series that debuted in 1989, is a cast member of ABC's \"Mixed-ish,\" which had its series premiere last year. Thiessen appears on the Netflix series \"Alexa & Katie,\" which premiered last year. As the reboot is a part of NBC's streaming service Peacock, the two would've needed to get permission to do a second show for a rival service, which may not have even been approved.\n\nMark-Paul Gosselaar says he wasn't asked to be a part of 'Saved By the Bell' reboot\n\nTime out!: A 'Saved By the Bell' remake is coming to NBC's streaming service Peacock\n\nTiffani Thiessen attends the \"Mary Poppins Returns\" premiere in Hollywood on Nov. 29, 2018.

It has nothing to do with us.\"\n\nMark-Paul Gosselaar reflects on career, 'Saved by the Bell' romances\n\nLast month, Gosselaar revealed he was not approached for the revival and learned of the news \"in the trades.\"\n\n\"Honestly, I was never approached. I haven't been approached, and I woke up to the news this morning with a \u2018huh\u2019 kind of response,\u201d he informed Variety.\n\nGosselaar said he understood why his phone might not have been ringing, considering he is under contract with Disney.\n\n\u201cI kind of understand it 'cause I\u2019m on ABC, so it kind of doesn\u2019t fit into that considering Disney+,\" he said, \"So I understand the business side of things, but I had no idea that it was that far along.\u201d\n\nThe remake will feature original cast members of the series that lasted for four seasons, plus a single season for the college spinoff, such as Elizabeth Berkley (Jessie Spano) and Mario Lopez (A.C. Slater).\n\nThe official description even mentions Zack, who it turns out, has had a successful bid for office.\n\n\"When California governor Zack Morris (Time out Governor Zack Morris?! Time in!) gets into hot water for closing too many low-income high schools, he proposes they send the affected students to the highest performing schools in the state \u2013 including Bayside High. The influx of new students gives the over privileged Bayside kids a much needed and hilarious dose of reality.\"\n\nContributing: Gary Levin\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2019/10/04/saved-bell-reboot-tiffani-thiessen-surprised-announcement/3862791002/", "description": "\"Literally, Mark-Paul (Gosselaar) and I were like, \u2018Oh, wow!
