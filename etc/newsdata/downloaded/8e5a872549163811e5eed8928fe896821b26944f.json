Watch live. WATCH\n\nDA leader Mmusi Maimane has cut a forlorn figure over the last 24 hours.\n\nOn Sunday he had to grit his teeth when his predecessor and b\u00eate noire Helen Zille completed her stunning comeback to politics with her election as chairperson of the party\u2019s federal council. And on Monday he stood by while Herman Mashaba, the Mayor of Johannesburg and another drop-in DA leader, hammered the party while announcing his resignation.\n\nMaimane, leader since 2015, is facing a grim and uncertain future. Under his watch the party seems to be coming apart at the seams, with a disastrous election result in May being compounded by a series of by-election defeats and internal ructions now spilling over into the public domain.\n\nMonday\u2019s remarkable events at the Johannesburg Civic Centre however are sure to harden opposition against him even more.\n\nDespite a frantic 24 hours in which he tried to convince Mashaba not to resign his mayoralty, Johannesburg\u2019s first citizen did exactly that. In spectacular fashion he delivered a series of broadsides to the DA which not only laid bare his true feelings and ambitions, but came as another body blow to a party already crippled by indecision and division.\n\nWhile Mashaba attacked his party as being the \"most difficult partner in the city\u2019s coalition arrangement\" (and not the EFF), opposed to his \"pro-poor\" policies and lurching away from principles he believes in with Zille's return, a stoic Maimane sat in the front row.\n\nWhen Mashaba concluded, Maimane stepped up to the podium and praised him for the work he did in the city and committed the party to continue in a governance arrangement with the EFF, despite the enormous cleavages between the parties\u2019 ideologies and approaches to governance.\n\nHe then held Mashaba\u2019s hand aloft, like a boxing referee after a bout, praising him, before adding, \"You\u2019re a hero to me\u2026 a hero\u2026\"\n\nAnd this after Mashaba resigned his position and called a press conference to publicly launch an unrestrained and blistering attack on the party that he, Maimane, leads.\n\nMashaba, a favourite of the EFF, has now given the DA\u2019s opponents ample targets to aim for.\n\nHis statement and actions tell the public that the DA were unwilling and difficult in his endeavours to ensure that the city is cleaned up and returned to a functional state. He told the public the DA doesn\u2019t care about the poor and would rather prioritise the needs of the well-to-do. And he\u2019s denounced Zille as emblematic of the party\u2019s shift away from progressive politics and a return to white domination.\n\nMaimane, by appearing next to him and praising him as a \"hero\", is now seen to be endorsing Mashaba\u2019s parting salvo. It was remarkable: a party deployee publicly shaming the organisation and the party leader standing there all but cheering him on. It\u2019s like a smiling President Cyril Ramaphosa standing next to Zandile Gumede, the disgraced mayor of the eThekwini metropolitan municipality, while she blasts the ANC leadership and then thanking her for her words.\n\nMaimane is now in dangerous territory. His position has weakened significantly over the last 72 hours and there seems to be a buoyancy among his opponents.\n\nThe DA in Johannesburg is floundering. The instability at City Hall will be sought to be exploited by the EFF, a party with no track-record in government and whose governance mores are being shot to pieces with every passing revelation about VBS Bank looting.\n\nThe ANC, too, are champing at the bit to reclaim the mayor\u2019s parlour in Braamfontein. The party has a deplorable record in the city, which led to voters ejecting it in the 2016 municipal elections. But they'll take what they can get.\n\nVoters have punished the DA for its incoherence and infighting earlier this year and have been giving it more of the same medicine at subsequent by-elections. Its leadership\u2019s inability to manage and retain Mashaba in Johannesburg and Patricia de Lille in Cape Town, the country\u2019s two most important cities, will not go unnoticed.\n\nAnd neither will Maimane\u2019s vocal support for someone who launched a biting and vocal attack on the party.\n\nThis centre will most certainly not hold.", "description": "Herman Mashaba resigned as DA mayor of the City of Johannesburg on Monday, launching a stinging attack on his own party. In the audience sat the party's leader, Mmusi Maimane, who then called him \"a hero\". That doesn't bode well for him or his party. At all.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7959/7df73a7d905748a5a94b9908f3e7a8c2.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
