These are due to be hammered out into a \u201ccomposite\u201d at a late-night meeting on Sunday.\n\nBut the national executive committee (NEC) is threatening to pre-empt those discussions by tabling its own policy statement \u2013 a draft version of which suggests deferring the decision on whether to support remain until a special conference to be held after a Labour government has negotiated a Brexit deal.\n\nCorbyn made clear that was his position. \u201cWe would put both views and say look, this is the best deal we could get; this is the remain and hopefully reform option. These are the choices before you.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThe vast majority of Labour party supporters and members supported remain, but a significant minority voted the other way. The party, the people and the leader of this country should understand why people voted leave.\u201d\n\nCorbyn admitted he knew plans to ditch the role of deputy leader were under discussion, though insisted he was unaware that the \u201cparticular motion\u201d would be launched on Friday night.\n\n\u201cI was not aware that the particular motion was going to be moved at that time but I knew they would be discussing options, so when I heard of this I then proposed a statement to the NEC which I put myself, which was that we should have a consultation about having two deputy leaders in the future, which would reflect gender and ethnic balance in our society.\u201d\n\nThe attempt to abolish Watson\u2019s post was launched by Jon Lansman, the founder of the pro-Corbyn campaign group Momentum, and supported by 16 other members of the party\u2019s NEC.\n\nCorbyn also confirmed that Fisher, his policy chief, was preparing to quit at the end of this year. Fisher sent a blistering memo, leaked to the Sunday Times, citing a \u201cblizzard of lies and excuses\u201d and apparently claimed that the highest ranks of the party were engaged in \u201cclass war\u201d.\n\nCorbyn said: \u201cI\u2019ve obviously seen the words that Andrew wrote, and I discussed them with him at some length, immediately.\u201d He said Fisher would remain in post for the general election campaign. He added: \u201cI think he said that because he was extremely distressed at that point about whatever was going on, discussions within the office, in that moment.\u201d\n\nFisher was a central figure in compiling the 2017 general election manifesto. The Guardian understands he has recently been warning the shadow cabinet that Labour\u2019s position of trying to appeal to both leave and remain is beginning to damage the party\u2019s electoral standing.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m taking the party into the general election to end austerity, to bring forward policies that bring about a better standard of living and better opportunities for people all across this country. I\u2019m enjoying doing that,\u201d Corbyn said \u2013 adding that \u201cof course\u201d he would serve a full term, if elected as prime minister.", "description": "Labour leader risks infuriating activists and MPs as he plays down splits at party conference", "authors": ["Heather Stewart", "Andrew Rawnsley"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79cf9d478009e6782f9bae57fe5c0ef3fa9c4522/293_404_6427_3856/master/6427.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f0801f83b663dd7e9f2d3295a4f908f2", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
