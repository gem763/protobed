Nationals left fielder Juan Soto immediately through his arms up to signal for a dead ball, but not seeing the ball in the fence, Pederson's shot was initially ruled a home run.\n\nReplay quickly showed that the ball hit netting in the middle of the bullpen door \u2013 and went through \u2013 so the call was overturned.\n\nJoc Pederson with one of the weirdest doubles we've ever seen. pic.twitter.com/rjGbsJMPCN \u2014 Cut4 (@Cut4) October 10, 2019\n\nThe next batter, Max Muncy, would proceed to a hit a two-run homer that very clearly got over the fence.", "description": "The Dodgers thought they had a home run to lead off Game 5 against the Nationals.
