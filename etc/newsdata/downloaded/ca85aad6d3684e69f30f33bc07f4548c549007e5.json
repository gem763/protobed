He has a big heart. He thought he was doing the right thing 10 years ago when he took someone into his home.\"\n\nAccording to a probable cause affidavit, the Barnetts' daughter told a Tippecanoe County Sheriff's deputy in September 2014 that she came to the U.S. in 2008 as part of an adoption program. She said she had a form of dwarfism known as spondyloepiphyseal. The disorder is known for causing skeletal abnormalities, and on occasion, vision and hearing issues.\n\nThe affidavit stated that Peyton Manning Children's Hospital records show a doctor examined Barnett's daughter and approximated her to be 8 years old in 2010.\n\nProsecutors say that the Barnetts adopted the girl, who was from Ukraine, in 2010.

The probable cause affidavit does not give an exact date for when the survey was conducted.\n\nThe Barnetts legally changed the girl's age from 11 to 22, according to prosecutors. Michael Barnett told authorities in September 2019 that his wife told their daughter to say she was 22 if anyone asked and to explain that she looked young for her age.\n\nAsked Wednesday how a person's age can be changed, Michael Barnett's attorney said they would address that issue in the court process.\n\nAttny.
