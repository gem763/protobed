That\u2019s one of the blessings of liberty.\u201d\n\nDavid French is a prominent Never Trump writer and a darling of Southern Baptist evangelical leaders like Russell Moore and Al Mohler. Both French and his wife routinely attack evangelicals for supporting Donald Trump. Both French and his wife claim evangelicals compromise Christian beliefs for political expediency. French is a writer for National Review and an important constitutional lawyer for Christian religious liberty. French defended a neutral secular public square in a story published by the New Yorker. French in his defense of the liberal political order praised Drag Queen Story Hours.\n\nBut, what makes this New Yorker quote important is how revealing it is about French and elite evangelicalism. He defended Russell Moore, and thinks voting for Trump is bad; however, Drag Queen Story Time is one of the \u201cblessings of liberty.\u201d\n\nAccording to the New Yorker, \u201cAnd, oh, by the way, you can\u2019t define victory as the exclusion of your enemies from the public square. There are going to be Drag Queen Story Hours. They\u2019re going to happen. And, by the way, the fact that a person can get a room in a library and hold a Drag Queen Story Hour and get people to come? That\u2019s one of the blessings of liberty.\u201d\n\nBlessings of Liberty?\n\nOr the curse of license?\n\nThe modern world of liberal excess is a time where every man, woman (and all 73 other genders) do what is right in their own eyes.\n\nThis is the key problem with modern conservatives. They don\u2019t know what is worth conserving.\n\nConservatism is more than free markets, supply side tax rates and defending property rights. Conservationism is more than individual liberty. Real conservatism preserves our faith, families and liberty.\n\nFrench gets the liberty part right. We should defend liberty. However, liberty always has limits. It is the delicate balance the Founders undertook in creating the U.S. Constitution.\n\nFrench must admit the public square is never neutral. It is always promoting something, and in modern America the liberal order promotes sexual immorality. To call celebrations of this a blessing of liberty misses the point of both blessing and liberty.\n\nBut, like most Never Trumpers, French is wrong about politics.\n\nMoreover, this is revealing about a darling of the Southern Baptist political establishment. Both Russell Moore and Albert Mohler promote and platform French.\n\nFrench spoke on the topic of Intersectionality and Identity Politics at Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in February.\n\nThis is how Big Eva works.\n\nThey hold dangerous political ideas.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: this article was first published at Capstone Report.\n\nPulpit & Pen now offers subscribers a weekly newsletter.
