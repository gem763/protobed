I didn't walk for two years. I forgot what it is to stand, I forgot I was taller than a lot of people in the room,\" he said.\n\nIt took a lot longer to learn how to control the arms.\n\nThibault said: \"It was very difficult because it is a combination of multiple muscles and movements.\n\n\"This is the most impressive thing I do with the exoskeleton.\"\n\nHow good is the exoskeleton?\n\nThe 65kg of sophisticated robotics is not completely restoring function.\n\nHowever, it is a marked advance on similar approaches that allow people to control a single limb with their thoughts.\n\nThibault does need to be attached to a ceiling-harness in order to minimise the risk of him falling over in the exoskeleton - it means the device is not yet ready to move outside the laboratory.\n\n\"This is far from autonomous walking,\" Prof Alim-Louis Benabid, the president of the Clinatec Executive Board, told BBC News.\n\n\"He does not have the quick and precise movements not to fall, nobody on earth does this,\" he added.\n\nIn tasks where Thibault had to touch specific targets by using the exoskeleton to move his upper and lower arms and rotate his wrists, Thibault was successful 71% of the time.\n\nProf Benabid, who developed deep brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease, told the BBC: \"We have solved the problem and shown the principle is correct. This is proof we can extend the mobility of patients in an exoskeleton.\n\n\"This is in [the] direction of giving better quality of life.\"\n\nWhat is the next step?\n\nThe French scientists say they can continue to refine the technology.\n\nAt the moment they are limited by the amount of data they can read from the brain, send to a computer, interpret and send to the exoskeleton in real-time.\n\nThey have 350 milliseconds to go from thought to movement otherwise the system becomes difficult to control.\n\nIt means out of the 64 electrodes on each implant, the researchers are using only 32.\n\nSo there is still the potential to read the brain in more detail using more powerful computers and AI to interpret the information from the brain.\n\nThere are also plans to develop finger control to allow Thibault to pick up and move objects.\n\nHe has already used the implant to control a wheelchair.\n\nAre there more sinister roles for this technology?\n\nThere are scientists investigating ways of using exoskeletons to enhance human abilities, a field known as transhumanism, rather than overcome paralysis.\n\nThis includes military applications.\n\n\"We are absolutely not going in the direction of these extreme and stupid applications,\" Prof Benabid told the BBC.\n\nHe added: \"We are not in the enhanced human-being approach. Our job is to repair the injured patients who have lost function,\" Prof Benabid told the BBC.\n\nWhat do experts think?\n\nProf Tom Shakespeare, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: \"Although this study presents a welcome and exciting advance, we must remember that proof of concept is a long way from usable clinical possibility.\n\n\"A danger of hype always exists in this field.\n\n\"Even if ever workable, cost constraints mean that hi-tech options are never going to be available to most people in the world with spinal cord injury.\"\n\nHe said only 15% of people with disabilities had a wheelchair or other assistive devices.\n\nDetails of the exoskeleton have been published in The Lancet Neurology journal.\n\nFollow James on Twitter.", "description": "A man who had not walked for two years was able to move all his limbs thanks to new technology.", "authors": ["James Gallagher", "Health", "Science Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/473F/production/_109093281_clinatec_juliettetreillet-49.jpg"}
