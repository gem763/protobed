Along with the vindication that many felt at seeing a united cry against how the country has been run, there was also an unavoidable dread that set in at the sight of military patrols in the streets, live rounds being fired at unarmed protesters, batons cracking the heads of seemingly innocuous pedestrians, and police rounding up students in their homes.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t the first time Chile saw scenes like this.\n\nThe US-backed military brutality of the Augusto Pinochet regime laid the foundation for a restructuring of the country in the image of free-market crusaders imported from Chicago. By the time they were done, Chile had achieved what they called a \u2018miracle,\u2019 the private sector was involved in every sphere of life, free from the legal and ethical constraints under socialism, but with an economic decline not seen in the country since the 1930s. GDP fell by 14.3%, and 1 out of every 4 Chileans was left unemployed.\n\nAfter the first wave of Chileans fleeing the bloody aftermath of the right-wing coup, families like mine were part of a second large emigration in the 1980s who left to look for work.\n\nWhen Chileans voted to end Pinochet\u2019s rule in 1988, it was clear that the expectations were an end to state repression as well as a change in the institutions, laws and norms created under his regime. But in almost 30 years of civilian government, 20 of which were under purportedly \u2018left\u2019 governments, people saw the signs of wealth around them without being a part of it.\n\nAlso on rt.com The Russians are meddling again, this time in Chile, warns US diplomat\n\nAs Claudio Bravo, goalkeeper for the Chilean national football team and Manchester City, tweeted in the initial days of these demonstrations, \u201cThey sold our water, electricity, gas, education, health, pensions, medicines, our roads, forests, the Atacama salt flats, the glaciers, transportation into private hands. Anything else? Isn\u2019t this too much? We do not want a Chile for the few.\u201d\n\nThe sentiment expressed by Bravo, hardly a leftist in his own right, summarized the situation and sentiment in the streets.\n\nThe post-dictatorship consensus of Chile\u2019s political class has been to continue administering the neoliberal state set up by Pinochet and Co. but under the auspices of Washington. While the privatization of services and deregulations certainly began under Pinochet, the governments of the \u2018Concertaci\u00f3n,\u2019 comprising the Christian Democrats, Socialists, and others, did little to detain and reverse these, and in many ways continued them.\n\nIt is no coincidence that these protests started in Santiago\u2019s Metro system. Rapid transit in the capital has been increasingly built out under private-public partnerships, and the privatization of the Metro itself began under socialist president Michelle Bachelet.\n\nWhen these fares hikes were announced by the government of Sebastian Pinera, they were justified on the basis that \u2018an expert panel\u2019 determined fares should increase. Transit users were told that if they could not afford the increases, then they should get up earlier and go home later in order to avoid paying fares during peak hours.\n\nIt\u2019s this \u2018let them eat cake\u2019 attitude under the guise of technocracy, coupled with the shameless corruption of politicians of all political stripes, that has fueled the frustrations of daily living and finally caused this anger to hit a fever pitch.\n\nThe right-wing Chilean government has scrambled to present \u2018remedies\u2019 to this anger, including a pointless cabinet shuffle and meagre increases in minimum wages and pensions. But these measures are insufficient, and things have gone beyond the point where people will be pacified by them.\n\nIn the streets, Chileans are saying \u201cthis isn\u2019t about 30 cents (the increase in fares), it\u2019s about 30 years\u201d under the neoliberal state, which was also promoted by Washington and its appendages as a model to emulate and then exported across the region by brute force.\n\nAlso on rt.com Protesters in Chile disrupt lithium mines with road blockade amid growing anti-government demonstrations\n\nUS business interests\u2019 long standing ties in Chile, which was one of the principal reasons for Washington\u2019s involvement in the 1973 coup and support for the dictatorship that restored the place of US capital in the country, are central to shaping Chile\u2019s political role in the region. The dutifully promoted US business interests are integral to the neoliberal model pushed by successive Chilean governments in the region, and go hand-in-hand with Washington\u2019s foreign policy imperatives (as can be seen with attempts to topple the government of Venezuela and the transparent oil interests involved).\n\nAfter more than three decades, the majority of Chileans have now woken up from the neoliberal model and told the world that this model isn\u2019t as advertised. What is taking place in Chile\u2019s streets is neoliberalism\u2019s death knell, in the very place where it was birthed at the barrel of a gun.\n\nBut Chile isn\u2019t the only Latin American battleground for this fight.\n\nEarlier in October, Ecuadorians led massive protests against the austerity measures implemented by the government of Lenin Moreno under the terms of his agreement with the US-dominated International Monetary Fund. Later in the month, Evo Morales won another election in Bolivia, and US ally Mauricio Macri suffered a stunning first round defeat in Argentina.\n\nAlso on rt.com Confirmed as winner, Bolivia\u2019s Morales invites international community for election audit after opposition says vote was rigged\n\nIt may be too early to characterize this as a second \u2018Pink Tide\u2019 or something of the sort, but there is no doubt that something big is taking place that goes well beyond the streets of Santiago. This is bad news for Washington\u2019s allies in Latin America, and for the model they have attempted to force down people\u2019s throats across the region.\n\nBy Pablo Vivanco\n\nPablo Vivanco is a journalist and analyst specializing in politics and history in the Americas, and served as the Director of teleSUR English.
