Like their sibling the iPhone 11, they were mostly seen as iterative updates to Apple\u2019s existing iPhone XS and XS Max: relatively sedate changes to already winning devices. They now have three cameras, with an ultra-wide lens joining the standard wide angle and telephoto lenses on the rear. The displays are brighter. There\u2019s a new processor and a new version of iOS, both in their 13th iterations. And they come in a matte finish on the back, with a new midnight green option. It\u2019s not exactly an earth-shattering list of updates.\n\nBut after using an iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max for the past week, I think they\u2019re more than the sum of several lightly updated parts. These are some of the most well-balanced, most capable phones Apple \u2014 or anyone \u2014 has ever made. They have excellent battery life, processors that should keep them relevant for years to come, absolutely beautiful displays, and a new camera system that generally outperforms every other phone, which should get even better with a promised software update later this fall.\n\nYes, they\u2019re expensive. And yes, I think most people should probably buy an iPhone 11, which has most of the same features, including the same basic camera system, for $300 less. But if you want to pay more to have the best display and the best camera, the iPhone 11 Pro is worth the premium over the iPhone 11.\n\nOur review of Apple iPhone 11 Pro Verge Score 9 out of 10 Good Stuff Excellent camera\n\nTerrific battery life\n\nBeautiful display Bad Stuff iOS 13 is buggy\n\nExpensive\n\nNo headphone jack or dongle in the box\n\nThe garden is beautiful, but the walls grow ever higher Buy for $999.00 from Apple\n\nOur review of Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max Verge Score 9 out of 10 Good Stuff Excellent camera\n\nTerrific battery life\n\nBeautiful display Bad Stuff iOS 13 is buggy\n\nExpensive\n\nNo headphone jack or dongle in the box\n\nThe garden is beautiful, but the walls grow ever higher Buy for $1,099.00 from Apple\n\nThe headline feature of the iPhone 11 Pro is the new camera system, but I\u2019m going to start with battery life because I got so many questions about it. It seems like Apple made an incredibly obvious move this year: it made the phone a little thicker and put a bigger battery inside. The iPhone 11 Pro is 0.01 inch (0.4mm) thicker and 0.3 ounces (11 grams) heavier than the iPhone XS. But unless you\u2019re comparing them directly, you won\u2019t notice (and even then, it\u2019s extremely subtle). The difference is a little more noticeable if you\u2019re upgrading from something like an iPhone 7, however, as the 11 Pro is a full 1.7 ounces (50 grams) heavier.\n\nBetween the larger size and the removal of the 3D Touch system, there\u2019s more room inside the case for a bigger battery, which seems like a big part of Apple\u2019s claimed four-hour battery life increase from the iPhone XS and five-hour increase for the Pro Max from the XS Max.\n\nMy iPhone 11 Pro Max has run for 12 to 14 hours on a charge\n\nThose numbers are fairly difficult to test, however. You\u2019ll notice that the only hard battery life numbers Apple publishes now are fixed tests of single actions, like video and audio playback on a loop. That\u2019s not how anyone really uses a phone, and Apple\u2019s claims of improved battery life over the previous phones aren\u2019t really based on those tests. Instead, the company takes a huge dataset of real-world iPhone usage and runs it against a model of the new phone that accounts for the various processor, chipset, display, and OS power improvements and the larger battery capacity.\n\nIt\u2019s clever, but there\u2019s no way for reviewers to repeat and verify that test. So the best I can tell you is that Apple has historically been good about meeting its battery life claims, and the iPhone 11 Pro Max I\u2019ve been using every day for a week has consistently run for 12 to 14 hours on a single charge, with over 10 hours of screen-on time reported in the battery settings per 24-hour period.\n\nThat\u2019s compared to 8 to 10 hours of battery life at most for my iPhone XS Max, which is a marked improvement. It\u2019s not enough to make me stop charging at my desk throughout the day, and I\u2019ll definitely still carry a battery pack on trips. But it\u2019s a big bump, and it\u2019s better than most Android phones we\u2019ve tested.\n\nThe smaller iPhone 11 Pro also performed well. We used it all day for the review video, sent it out for several hours of shooting photo tests and 4K video in the evening, left it off the charger overnight, and it still had 50 percent of its battery left the next morning. We\u2019ll update this review with some more real-world usage numbers for the smaller phone at the end of the week.\n\nApple\u2019s also finally relented and included an 18-watt USB-C fast charger with the Pro phones, so you get a USB-C to Lightning cable as well. Apple\u2019s USB-C charger is not the smallest or prettiest charger out there, but anything\u2019s better than that slow 5W brick it\u2019s been including for years.\n\nAll in all, the iPhone 11 Pro battery life has been impressive, especially compared to any prior iPhone, save for last year\u2019s iPhone XR. Turns out, making the phone thicker and putting a bigger battery inside is a good idea.\n\nAgree to Continue: iPhone 11 Pro Every smart device now requires you to agree to a series of terms and conditions before you can use it \u2014 contracts that no one actually reads. It\u2019s impossible for us to read and analyze every single one of these agreements. But we\u2019re going to start counting exactly how many times you have to hit \u201cagree\u201d to use devices when we review them since these are agreements most people don\u2019t read and definitely can\u2019t negotiate. We\u2019re starting with the iPhone 11 and 11 Pro, which will serve as our baseline. To use an iPhone, you have to agree to: The Apple terms of service agreement, which you can have sent to you by email\n\nApple\u2019s warranty agreement, which you can have sent to you by email These agreements are not negotiable, and you cannot use the phone at all if you don\u2019t agree to them. The iPhone also prompts you to set up Apple Cash and Apple Pay at setup, which further means you have to agree to: The Apple Cash agreement, which specifies that services are actually provided by Green Dot Bank and Apple Payments, Inc, and further consists of the following agreements:\n\nThe Apple Cash terms and conditions\n\nThe electronic communications agreement\n\nThe Green Dot bank privacy policy\n\nDirect payments terms and conditions\n\nDirect payments privacy notice\n\nApple Payments, Inc, license If you add a credit card to Apple Pay, you have to agree to: The terms from your credit card provider, which do not have an option to be emailed Final tally: two mandatory agreements, six optional agreements for Apple Cash, one optional agreement for Apple Pay\n\nThe biggest physical difference from the XS is on the back where Apple says the rear glass is now stronger and comes in a frosted matte finish. It also integrates a glossy camera bump with three cameras. The whole back and bump is a single piece of glass that\u2019s milled out. (The iPhone 11 is the reverse: it has a glossy back, and the camera bump is matte.) It\u2019s a neat thing to be able to do with glass, but that doesn\u2019t make this big, silly square look any less big and silly. It\u2019s still a big square camera bump.\n\nI got a lot of questions about the new matte finish, and I think it\u2019s quite nice, especially in Apple\u2019s new midnight green color (which is a grayish, military green that people seem especially drawn to). The back didn\u2019t really pick up any fingerprints, but it does seem a tiny bit more slippery than the glossy back of the previous phones and the iPhone 11. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a big deal; most people will stick this thing in a case. A lot of people also asked me if the matte finish scratches as easily as Google\u2019s Pixel 3, and so far, the answer seems to be no.\n\nOf course, the big external change to the iPhone 11 Pro is the camera system. There\u2019s now an ultra-wide camera in addition to the standard and telephoto cameras on the back.\n\nAnd these new cameras have to compete. The power of iMessage lock-in means that most iPhone users in the US will probably upgrade to another iPhone regardless of whether the camera is slightly worse or better than the Pixel, but Apple doesn\u2019t have that advantage in huge markets like China and Europe where everyone uses WeChat or WhatsApp and switching platforms is much easier. And there\u2019s a pride element: the iPhone camera led the industry for years, but Google\u2019s Pixel cameras, in particular, have been outperforming the iPhone for two years now, and Chinese phone makers have been racing each other to add an endless array of photography features. I get the sense Apple is clearly feeling the pressure.\n\nThe iPhone 11 Pro has three cameras, all with different focal lengths: there\u2019s a new ultra-wide camera with an f/2.4 13mm lens, the f/1.8 26mm main camera with a slightly improved sensor, and the telephoto camera with the same sensor as last year but a faster 52mm f/2.0 lens. (All focal lengths are in 35mm equivalent.) The f/2.2 front camera is now 12 megapixels, up from 7, and it has a wider 24mm focal length so it can pull out to a slightly wider angle in landscape for selfies, which is incredibly fun.\n\nApple is clearly feeling the pressure from other phone cameras, and the iPhone 11 Pro cameras are a big step up\n\nApple\u2019s also updated its Smart HDR processing system, which I was not very impressed with when I reviewed the iPhone XS and XR last year, and I have grown to dislike it even more over time. To my eyes, Smart HDR unnaturally flattened images by aggressively lifting shadows and bringing down highlights, and it crushes details with a ton of smoothing and noise reduction.\n\nIt appears Apple took all of those criticisms to heart because the iPhone 11 Pro cameras are an enormous improvement over the XS, and they beat the Pixel and Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Note 10 Plus in most of our side-by-side comparisons. In fact, I think the iPhone 11 Pro is the best smartphone camera on the market right now.\n\n(These image sliders are all cropped in to show detail in the photos \u2014 there are some minor cropping differences to get the sliders to align. Click on the photos in the grids to see the full-size images.)\n\nThis shot of Verge video producer Mariya Abdulkaf outside in bright sunlight is really all you need to know: this photo shouldn\u2019t be too hard for any camera to do a good job, and every phone did just fine. But at 100 percent crop, the improvement from the iPhone XS to the iPhone 11 is stunning. The iPhone 11 is way sharper, with far more detail. I think the iPhone 11 also does a marginally better job than the Pixel 3, and it\u2019s far more natural than the Note 10\u2019s processing fiesta. (It\u2019s sharpened and smoothed! C\u2019mon now.)\n\nEarly reports indicate that the iPhone 11 sensor has a higher ISO range and faster possible shutter speeds. But Apple told me that the real improvements are due to a bump from an 8-bit rendering pipeline to 10 bits, and something it calls \u201csemantic rendering,\u201d which is basically an update to Smart HDR that recognizes individual elements of an image and adjusts them appropriately.\n\nFrom my conversations with Apple, semantic rendering basically goes like this:\n\nThe iPhone starts taking photos to a buffer the instant you open the camera app. So by the time you actually press the shutter button, it\u2019s captured four underexposed frames and the photo you want. Then it grabs one overexposed frame. (This is all basically the same as the iPhone XS and the Pixel 3, except the Pixel doesn\u2019t grab that overexposed frame.) Smart HDR looks for things in the photos it understands: the sky, faces, hair, facial hair, things like that. Then it uses the additional detail from the underexposed and overexposed frames to selectively process those areas of the image: hair gets sharpened, the sky gets de-noised but not sharpened, faces get relighted to make them look more even, and facial hair gets sharpened up. Smart HDR is also now less aggressive with highlights and shadows. Highlights on faces aren\u2019t corrected as aggressively as before because those highlights make photos look more natural, but other highlights and shadows are corrected to regain detail. The whole image gets saved and shows up in your camera roll. This all happens instantly every time you take a photo.\n\nThe improvements to smart HDR are applicable across cameras. Check out this comparison of the ultra-wides on the 11 Pro and the Note 10. The Note 10 did a better job of exposing the sky, but the 11 Pro is just a much sharper photo, with more detail.\n\nThe same goes with selfies: the iPhone 11 Pro evenly pulls up shadows on Mariya\u2019s face but preserves the contrast with the background, while the XS Max has pulled up shadows so much that it looks a little hazy. The Note 10 does all kinds of wacky skin smoothing, and while the Pixel 3 looks great, it has a little less detail than the iPhone. Look at her eyelashes. This is an impressive jump in photo quality.\n\nNow, there are places where the iPhone doesn\u2019t win. The XS struggled with backlit subjects, and while the 11 Pro is an improvement, it\u2019s still not great. This photo is really blue, and there\u2019s basically no detail in Mariya\u2019s face. I think the Note did the best overall job here.\n\nAnd while the iPhone 11 Pro is a lot better than the XS in low light, I think the Pixel still does a better job. Apple\u2019s promised a processing update for medium to low light images called \u201cdeep fusion,\u201d which is supposed to ship later this fall. But I wasn\u2019t able to test it, so right now, it\u2019s a little behind the curve. (Apple told me that deep fusion won\u2019t be a \u201cmode\u201d like Night mode. It\u2019ll just be how these medium-dark images get handled.)\n\nSpeaking of night modes, it\u2019s also really impressive, and it preserves a ton more detail than the Pixel. Apple\u2019s Night mode comes on automatically in the dark with a suggested exposure time, which you can tweak or turn off if you want. The Pixel shot here looks more dramatic, but look a little closer: the iPhone has preserved all of the detail in the brick and graffiti, which is basically gone in the Pixel shot.\n\nTwo more: look at all of the extra detail in the bushes in the iPhone shot, and that fence at the waterfront isn\u2019t even there in the Pixel photo. I think the Pixel continues to produce more contrasty, dramatic images than the iPhone 11 camera, but I\u2019d rather have the extra detail.\n\nSo the iPhone 11 camera does better in bright light than the Pixel 3 and Note 10, and Night mode beats the Pixel 3 more often than not. If the deep fusion update improves medium-to-low light performance as much as Apple says it will, the iPhone 11 will take better photos than the competition in every lighting situation.\n\nWe also spent a lot of time testing video recording, which Apple says is the best video ever on a smartphone. There\u2019s better stabilization, all three cameras can now shoot 4K60, and you can switch between lenses if you shoot at 4K30 and below. The gap between Apple\u2019s video camera and everyone else\u2019s was already big, and it\u2019s gotten bigger with the iPhone 11 Pro. But the best way to talk about that is actually on video, so go watch our video review for more.\n\nThere\u2019s a new display on the iPhone 11 that Apple is calling the Super Retina XDR display, a reference to Apple\u2019s fancy new Pro XDR monitor and the iPhone 11 Pro\u2019s increased peak brightness levels: 800 nits in standard mode outdoors and 1200 nits in the highlights of HDR content (compared to 625 nits in standard mode for the XS).\n\nI think it\u2019s more accurate to say that this is the first real HDR display Apple\u2019s put on a phone. The iPhone XS was theoretically capable of HDR playback, but I never found it convincing. The iPhone 11 Pro is very convincing. It\u2019s an obvious difference when watching a Dolby Vision movie like John Wick 3, and the display overall holds its own against the Note 10\u2019s excellent display.\n\nOf course, Apple and Google are still in a fight over video codecs, so you can\u2019t watch any 4K or HDR content on the iPhone 11 Pro from YouTube. This is getting past ridiculous; I am sure the iPhone has the processing power to handle Google\u2019s VP9 codec. Apple just doesn\u2019t want to let it, so you\u2019re stuck watching 1080p video from YouTube until these companies sort it out.\n\nyou can\u2019t watch any 4K or HDR content on the iPhone 11 Pro from YouTube\n\nApple\u2019s also tweaked its excellent True Tone display system: it now has a five-channel light sensor, down from six in the XS. Apple says it got better results by dropping the white channel and making the color channels more sensitive, and the end result is that I think the iPhone 11 Pro display has a slightly different color cast compared to my XS with True Tone on. It\u2019s a little bit warmer and greener. True Tone is one of the best unsung features of the iPhone, and I wish Android makers would copy it sooner rather than later.\n\n3D Touch is no more. It\u2019s been replaced on the iPhone 11 Pro by what Apple calls Haptic Touch. Haptic Touch is just long-pressing with haptic feedback; it\u2019s convincing, but it\u2019s definitely long-pressing. 3D Touch was a great idea that never really panned out, and the iPhone is not really any worse for its removal. In fact, some things are a little easier to figure out, like rearranging icons on the home screen since there\u2019s a context menu that pops up now. You don\u2019t have to explain to people that they have to press down on the camera icon on the lock screen. Peeking at links is a little different in iOS 13, but it\u2019s a little easier overall.\n\nApple says part of the reason it\u2019s moving to Haptic Touch is so that it can bring these little features to every iOS device, including the iPad, so expect to see the company lean into it a little.\n\nThe only place where I truly missed 3D Touch was the keyboard: you could press down anywhere on the keyboard to move the cursor around on the XS. With Haptic Touch, you press and hold on the spacebar. I never really realized how many times a day I used that one specific 3D Touch feature, and I miss it. I got used to it quickly last year when I used the iPhone XR, which also lacks 3D Touch, and I\u2019m getting used it again with the 11 Pro. And if that\u2019s the trade-off for a bigger battery, I\u2019ll take it.\n\nRelated The 3 best and worst features of the iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max\n\nThe iPhone 11 Pro speakers are really loud and generally sound better than ever. The iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro now have something called \u201cspatial audio,\u201d which Apple tells me is a virtual surround decoder that mostly supports Dolby formats, although it seems like games can use it without Dolby encoding as well.\n\nSpatial audio supports 5.1 and 7.1 surround \u2014 Netflix will play in Dolby Digital 5.1 \u2014 and it also supports Dolby Atmos in movies from the iTunes store, which is a little silly for stereo speakers, but it\u2019s there. I tested this a bunch, and, well, if you close your eyes and really believe, it sometimes sounds like sounds are coming from behind you. It\u2019s a phone, after all. But hey: Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos \u2014 I can\u2019t complain.\n\nThe iPhone 11 Pro features Apple\u2019s new A13 Bionic processor, which, as usual, benchmarks far above the competition. There\u2019s a lot of headroom here for things like AR, games, and high-end photo and video apps, but it\u2019s not like the A12 Bionic in the iPhone XS is slow \u2014 most of this extra power will be useful towards the end of this phone\u2019s life, not now, at the beginning. And I just don\u2019t think most people buying thousand-dollar \u201cpro\u201d phones will keep them around for more than a couple years, especially since Apple\u2019s pushing upgrades harder than ever as iPhone sales flatten out. (Have you seen this year\u2019s trade-in offers?) Thinking about what the company\u2019s huge lead in smartphone processors means for this high-end phone at launch time is tough. But it\u2019s a fast chip, and it\u2019ll hold up if you decide to keep this phone for years to come, which is a good thing.\n\nFace ID is a little bit faster and works at more angles, but it\u2019s not particularly dramatic. It just works a little bit better. That\u2019s the best kind of iterative improvement, especially since anything that encourages people to secure their phones is a good thing.\n\nThe most intriguing new feature of the iPhone 11 and 11 Pro is the new U1 chip inside, which will eventually be used for precise positioning using an ultra-wideband radio. It doesn\u2019t do anything right now, so I wasn\u2019t able to test it, but Apple says the forthcoming iOS 13.1 update will allow you to just point the phone at another U1 device to put it at the top of your AirDrop list. There are also lots of hints about things like unlocking car doors and locating objects, but none of that works yet, so we\u2019ll just have to see.\n\nSpeaking of iOS 13.1\u2026 I would maybe wait to get the iPhone 11 Pro until iOS 13.1 comes out on September 30th, just 10 days after the iPhone 11 and 11 Pro launch.\n\niOS 13 I didn\u2019t spend a lot of time on iOS 13 in this review. My colleague Chaim Gartenberg will have a full review of that coming alongside the release on September 19th. But here are his early impressions: It\u2019s buggy, at least with the initial release. It might be worth waiting until September 30th and iOS 13.1 to see if things improve.\n\nDark mode is good. The background is a true black that looks great on OLED iPhones.\n\nThe photos app might just be the best part of the update.\n\nBeing able to grant apps more limited location permissions is a very welcome addition.\n\nApple Maps is... fine now. Google still wins on overall data, but Maps is on par for basic usability at least.\n\nNew Reminder app is much better. iOS skeuomorphism is almost dead.\n\nCarPlay is really good now.\n\nMy iPhone 11 and 11 Pro review units are running iOS 13.0, and iOS 13.0 is pretty damn buggy. I saw all kinds of glitches and crashes during my week of testing, as did Verge executive editor Dieter Bohn with his iPhone 11 review unit running iOS 13. The home screen has crashed and relaunched. Messages glitches out and puts the text entry field at the top of the screen. AirDrop has crashed out so hard I\u2019ve had to restart the phone a few times to get it working again. The camera app lags from time to time. There are a lot of good new features in iOS 13, but it\u2019s clear that Apple\u2019s pushing hard to get it out, and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any harm in waiting a tick for these bugs to get cleared up.\n\nAssuming all the little bugs get fixed, the biggest new feature in iOS 13 is Dark Mode, which is very nice, but otherwise, it\u2019s a lot of little things: there\u2019s a swiping keyboard now. Reminders is a much better app. There are better photo-editing tools, and you can edit videos as well. Apple Maps keeps getting a tiny bit better every year. CarPlay has a more useful interface. Siri\u2019s voice is slightly smoother. I love \u2014 love!\u2014 the security feature that tells you when apps are using Bluetooth or location services and prompts you to cut them off. It\u2019s a lot of little things that add up, but if you handed this phone to someone using iOS 12, they might not even notice unless Dark Mode was on. We\u2019ll have a full review of iOS 13 (and 13.1 when it comes out), so stay tuned for that.\n\nThe iPhone 11 Pro is an expensive phone: it starts at $999 with 64GB of storage (which doesn\u2019t seem like enough space for this price), and the 11 Pro Max starts at $1,099. You can spec the Pro Max all the way up to $1,449 with 512GB of storage, which is a lot of money for a phone that doesn\u2019t really do that much more than take better telephoto shots than the $699 iPhone 11.\n\nSo if you\u2019re in the iOS ecosystem and you\u2019re thinking about upgrading, I think the easy choice is the iPhone 11. It offers almost everything you get from the Pro for $300 less: you\u2019ll still get the improved main camera, the fun new ultra-wide lens, the A13 processor, iOS 13, and so on.\n\nThe extra money for the Pro basically buys you a far superior display, a telephoto camera, and improved LTE performance. And if you want a smaller phone, the iPhone 11 Pro is a little smaller than the iPhone 11, which seems a tiny bit unfair to people who want smaller phones. (The entire lineup is huge, though, so if you were hoping for something to replace that aging iPhone SE, well, keep waiting.)\n\nthe iPhone 11 Pro stands out as one of the best flagship phones of the year\n\nI\u2019m very picky about displays and cameras, so I\u2019m going to get a Pro. In fact, the cameras on the iPhone 11 and 11 Pro are so improved that I think they\u2019re worth the year-over-year upgrade from last year\u2019s models for the first time in a long time. Add in the improved battery life, and the iPhone 11 Pro stands out as a major step forward from the XS, and one of the best flagship phones of the year.\n\nBut I would also wait a couple of weeks for Apple to ship some bug fixes to iOS 13 before hitting that buy button.", "description": "Apple\u2019s new iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max have the best cameras on a phone; a huge improvement in battery life; bright, beautiful displays; and they come in midnight green.
