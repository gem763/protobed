The White House has instructed Porter and another former aide to Trump not to appear at a House Judiciary Committee hearing Tuesday, Sept. 17, 2019. (Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP/file)\n\nThe White House is claiming immunity over two former aides subpoenaed by the House Judiciary Committee, blocking them from answering questions in a Tuesday hearing about what they told former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III.\n\nWhite House counsel Pat A. Cipollone directed Rick Dearborn, the former Trump campaign adviser and ex-White House deputy chief of staff, and Rob Porter, the former White House staff secretary, not to answer questions by the panel. The committee subpoenaed both ex-Trump officials \u2014 key witnesses in several instances of potential obstruction of justice laid out by Mueller \u2014 to testify Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThe President has directed Mr. Dearborn and Mr. Porter not to appear at the hearing scheduled for Tuesday, September 17, 2019,\u201d Cipollone wrote to House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) on Monday evening, later adding: \u201cThe Department of Justice has advised me that Mr. Dearborn and Mr. Porter are absolutely immune from compelled congressional testimony with respect to matters related to their service as senior advisers to the President.\u201d\n\nThe move was largely expected by House Democrats, who argue that the administration\u2019s frequent immunity assertions over potential witnesses in their probes are bogus. They\u2019re currently challenging many of those claims in court.\n\nThe White House did something similar to stop other top Trump officials Democrats sought to haul into the witness chair, including former White House counsel Don McGahn, from testifying. An appeals court is expected to rule on the claim over McGahn\u2019s testimony as soon as late October.\n\nIn a letter to the panel, Porter\u2019s attorney said his client was in an impossible situation, a fight between two branches of government that must be resolved before he appears before lawmakers.\n\n\u201cMr. Porter has served in all three branches of the Federal government and is mindful of their respective constitutional responsibilities and prerogatives,\u201d Porter\u2019s lawyer Brant W. Bishop wrote to the panel in a letter Monday night. \u201cHe now faces competing and incompatible demands from coordinate and coequal branches\u2026 Such conflicting demands must be resolved through an accommodation between the Executive and Legislative branches, or by the Judiciary.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cIn the meantime, because the inquiry at issue relates to his service as a senior official at the White House, Mr. Porter must respect the White House\u2019s instruction.\u201d\n\nDemocrats\u2019 Tuesday hearing, however, won\u2019t be without fireworks. Far from it: Trump\u2019s combative former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski intends to testify, pushing back on Democratic assertions that Trump did anything wrong.\n\nThe questioning, which many expect to be heated, will be the first time House Democrats will have a key witness in the Mueller investigation testifying in public \u2014 a move they welcome even if he\u2019s fiercely loyal to Trump.\n\nThe White House, in a letter to the committee, told Nalder that Lewandowski is not allowed to answer any questions about his communications with the president beyond what was in the Mueller report.\n\n\u201cAs explained below, Mr. Lewandowski\u2019s conversations with the President and with senior advisers to the President are protected from disclosure by long-settled principles protecting Executive Branch confidentiality interests and, as a result, the White House has directed Mr. Lewandowski not to provide information about such communications beyond the information provided in the portions of the report that have already been disclosed to the Committee,\u201d the letter reads.\n\nStill, Democrats believe they\u2019ll be able to do damage to the president by merely having Lewandowski confirm publicly what he already told Mueller\u2019s team. According to the Mueller report, Trump tried to get Lewandowski to convince former attorney general Jeff Sessions to limit the special counsel\u2019s investigation, one of the possible areas of obstruction laid out by Mueller\u2019s team.", "description": "The administration directed Rick Dearborn, the former White House deputy chief of staff, and Rob Porter, the former White House secretary, not to answer questions by the panel.
