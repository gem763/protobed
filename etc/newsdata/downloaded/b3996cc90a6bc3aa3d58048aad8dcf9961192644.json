The 28-year-old has struggled since suffering a knee injury this season and has also had ankle and hamstring problems during this campaign, restricting him to six appearances for his club.\n\nThe midfielder is one of Chelsea\u2019s key players and Lampard asked Deschamps not to pick him during the September international break. That prompted the France manager to joke about Olivier Giroud\u2019s lack of games this season. Yet Lampard was less than amused when Kant\u00e9 was not sent home after the Iceland match and said Chelsea\u2019s doctors struggled to get information from their France counterparts.\n\n\u201cThe Kant\u00e9 one was not a laughing matter because we communicated before the last international break because he was injured,\u201d Chelsea\u2019s manager said. \u201cLet\u2019s think what benefits the player. He didn\u2019t go, we both agreed on that. That\u2019s how things should work.\n\n\u201cAfter the first game when he pulled out, he then had a fitness test the day before the second game; it was clear he couldn\u2019t play. He then sat on the bench on the evening of the game, so that\u2019s not communication \u2026 our doctors were speaking and there were times when things weren\u2019t coming back to us when I would expect them to.\u201d\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nIt was a costly international break for Chelsea, with Denmark\u2019s Andreas Christensen suffering a hamstring injury that will sideline him for two weeks and Croatia\u2019s Mateo Kovacic a doubt to face Newcastle because of a thigh problem. Lampard is annoyed his medical staff did not have longer to treat Kant\u00e9.\n\n\u201cWe got a player back a bit later,\u201d he said. \u201cI understand when players are on international duty, they are their player as such, but it was clear he wasn\u2019t fit to play. We would have wanted him back to work on him but it\u2019s been and gone and as with every international player I will try and have open lines of communication with every manager.\u201d\n\nRoss Barkley could benefit from Kant\u00e9\u2019s absence after impressing during England\u2019s 6-0 win over Bulgaria, scoring twice and grabbing an assist. \u201cI was loving his arrival into the box,\u201d Lampard said. \u201cIt\u2019s what you always want to get when you\u2019re playing midfielders with attacking qualities. I\u2019m delighted to see players going away internationally and doing well, particularly if he hasn\u2019t been playing as much as he might like here.\u201d\n\nN\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9: so much more than just the Premier League\u2019s best midfielder | Barney Ronay Read more\n\nBarkley has struggled to hold down a place in the Chelsea side and Lampard feels the 25-year-old has room for improvement. \u201cOne thing from working with Ross is that he wants to listen and learn,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd he\u2019s got great talent, which is probably why people have maybe judged him at a level at a young age because we all get excited when young talent comes through in England.\n\n\u201cHis story and his injuries and coming here to Chelsea where it is competitive, we have given him challenges. It is up to him to show here what he showed for England on Monday night. He has done in parts already. Midfield players that can go by a player, use their left and right foot and come up with a moment out of nothing are gold, but you have to have the complete game with that. Ross certainly has those talents and can get better.\u201d", "description": "The Chelsea manager accused France of a lack of communication and criticised Didier Deschamps after N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 returned with a groin injury", "authors": ["Jacob Steinberg"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2692818f02cb8125b284cbf7474e284e3db020e/0_180_5025_3015/master/5025.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=349a15a65837b3ebfe1292a572ec7668", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
