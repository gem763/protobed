REUTERS/Issei Kato/File Photo\n\nFaced with narrowing margins and a dwindling population, regional banks have increased loans for property investment and to companies with low profitability, the central bank said in a twice-yearly report analysing Japan\u2019s banking system.\n\nDespite continued improvements in the economy, some of the loans have turned sour due to lax lending standards and a rising number of firms falling behind in restructuring, it said.\n\n\u201cCredit costs remain low but have recently started to rise, particularly for regional financial institutions,\u201d the BOJ said.\n\n\u201cAs they have not been able to secure adequate returns relative to the risks involved, their capital adequacy ratios have continued to decline moderately,\u201d the report said.\n\nIf such conditions persist, regional banks could lose the capacity to absorb losses from soured loans in the event of a major shakeout in financial markets, it said.\n\nBig banks have expanded overseas lending and investment in complex financial products, which make Japan\u2019s banking system more susceptible to global risks, the BOJ\u2019s report said.\n\nThe number of collateralised loan obligations (CLOs), a form of securitisation which pools bank loans to companies, has ballooned in recent years as investors hunt for higher returns by buying into loans to lower-rated and riskier companies.\n\nJapanese banks have also piled in. CLOs make up about 20% of their investment in overseas credit products, the BOJ said.\n\nTheir holdings account for approximately 15% of the total global CLO market, though most of the investment is in tranches with the highest credit rating, it said.\n\nStress tests show that Japanese banks\u2019 holdings of CLOs are resilient to credit risks, the BOJ said.\n\n\u201cHowever, attention should be paid to ... the risk of a decline in market prices from a ratings downgrade in the event of a sudden change in economic and market conditions,\u201d it said.\n\nThe BOJ\u2019s Financial System Report (FSR) is among factors the nine-member board will likely scrutinise in deciding monetary policy at its rate review on Oct. 30-31.\n\n\u201cThe latest FSR has almost no implication for monetary policy, in our view,\u201d Barclays analyst Tetsufumi Yamakawa said in a research note.\n\n\u201cHowever, we believe the BOJ\u2019s increasing concern about mounting financial vulnerabilities will likely lead over the longer run to a move to revise the framework of yield curve control (YCC),\u201d he said.\n\nUnder YCC, the BOJ guides short-term rates at -0.1% and the 10-year bond yield around 0%.\n\nFailure to fire up inflation to its elusive 2% target has forced the BOJ to maintain its massive stimulus programme for longer than expected, crushing financial institutions\u2019 margin and straining Japan\u2019s banking system.\n\nBOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda has stressed the central bank will carefully weigh the benefits and costs of any further easing of monetary policy.", "description": "Japanese commercial banks are loading up on complex financial products and risky loans in their hunt for yields, the central bank said on Thursday, warning of the accumulating cost of prolonged ultra-low interest rates.", "authors": ["Leika Kihara", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444379065&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N0C8", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
