Both brothers have pleaded not guilty and are being tried by a judge alone.\n\nPhillip's room in other photos appeared dusty and cluttered with CDs, DVDs, bottles, boxes, and rubbish.\n\nProsecutor Jeff Tunks said Ms Thompson became extremely isolated after her husband's death in 2012 and was totally dependent on her sons for her nutrition, mobility, and personal hygiene.\n\nHe told the court the brothers were aware in the preceding weeks of their mother's deteriorating condition and the need for medical attention.\n\nParamedic Megan Kuhner, who attended the Greystanes house after the triple-zero call, said Ms Thompson's room had a stench and smelt 'really poorly'.\n\nPhillip's room in other photos appeared dusty and cluttered with CDs, DVDs, bottles, boxes, and rubbish\n\nAustralian Federal Police diplomatic protection officer Phillip Thompson, 43, (pictured) is on trial for her manslaughter\n\nEverything was filthy and when Ms Kuhner first looked at the floor she thought it was just dirt and not actually carpet.\n\nThe patient, whose pallor was almost greyish, was lying in bed on a towel smelling of urine.\n\n'It was quite disgusting,' Ms Kuhner said. 'It was just soaked in urine and faecal matter.'\n\nMs Thompson had bruises, pressure sores and a large open wound on her bottom, a wound which contained faecal matter.\n\nWhen asked about medical treatment, David Thompson told her: 'She doesn't like to see doctors. She is very stubborn.'\n\nMs Kuhner noticed both sons were quite clean despite the house being filthy.\n\nAt one stage, Ms Thompson told her: 'I am so thankful to have my sons.'\n\nHis unemployed brother David Thompson, 40, is on trial alongside him before a judge alone\n\nThe court heard David finally called an ambulance saying his bedridden mother couldn't eat and had a wound on her backside, little over a week before her death\n\nBoth brothers have pleaded not guilty and claimed their mother brought her death on herself\n\nTriage nurse Lauren Cole said Ms Thompson was pale and generally unkempt and smelt of urine.\n\nShe had a deep, red inflamed wound on her bottom which was 'the size of my fist and I could put my fist in it'.\n\nBut defence lawyers told Justice Des Fagan the case was about choices made by the mother, who had previously refused any medical care.\n\n'We say Shirley Thompson died because of choices she herself made,' Tony Evers, acting for the younger brother, said.\n\nHe claimed she made choices about when, if and what to eat, about using the bathroom and about not seeking medical help.\n\n'It is true the house could have been cleaner, but of course he was not a professional. He was her son,' he said.\n\nA paramedic who attended the Greystanes house (pictured) after the triple-zero call, said Ms Thompson's room had a stench and smelt 'really poorly'\n\nA broken window at the home in western Sydney where Ms Thompson was allegedly neglected\n\nJanet Manuel, for Phillip Thompson, said her client was employed full-time and had provided the income for the family while his brother looked after the household.\n\n'The Crown is unable to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Shirley Thompson lacked the capacity to make decisions for her own care,' she said.\n\nIn his police interview, David Thompson said his mother refused to seek medical help after he noticed 'a thing on her backside like a sore'.\n\nAsked why he didn't just ring an ambulance himself, he said: 'I love her and I didn't want to upset her in any way.'\n\nThe trial continues.", "description": "Shirley Thompson, 72, died of blood poisoning in a Sydney hospital on September 2, 2017, suffering from infected bedsores down to the bone and a serious wound the size of a fist.", "authors": ["Nic White For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/03/19470902-0-image-a-80_1570586926392.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
