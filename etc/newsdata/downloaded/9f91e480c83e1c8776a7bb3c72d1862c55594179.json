Katie Hill admits to relationship with campaign staffer amid ethics probe", "language": "en", "text": "Rep. Katie Hill Katherine (Katie) Lauren HillThe Hill's Morning Report - Presented by Better Medicare Alliance - GOP snags mic with impeachment protest House Ethics Committee to investigate Katie Hill allegations Freshman Democrat Katie Hill denies improper relationship with staffer MORE (D-Calif.) late Wednesday admitted to an \u201cinappropriate\u201d relationship with a campaign aide as she faces a House investigation over allegations of being sexually involved with a congressional staffer.\n\nHill said in a letter to constituents that she said hopes can \u201cput to rest some of the gossip, innuendo and lies,\u201d adding that she engaged in the relationship with a female campaign aide \u201cdespite my better judgement.\u201d\n\n\u201cDuring the final tumultuous years of my abusive marriage, I became involved in a relationship with someone on my campaign,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI know that even a consensual relationship with a subordinate is inappropriate, but I still allowed it to happen against my better judgement. For that I apologize.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe conservative website RedState first published a nude photo of Hill, who identifies as bisexual, with an individual the publication described as a female campaign staffer. Hill has since said the U.S. Capitol Police are investigating how the photo was obtained by RedState.\n\n\u201c[T]he truth is, distributing intimate photos with the intent to publish them is a crime, and the perpetrator should be punished to the full extent of the law,\u201d Hill wrote. \u201cI have notified Capitol Police, who are investigating it, and therefore will have no further comment on the matter.\u201d\n\nHer letter came hours after the House Ethics Committee announced it was launching an investigation into allegations that Hill violated chamber rules by engaging in a sexual relationship with a staffer in her congressional office.\n\nHill, a freshman who flipped a GOP-held district last year, has denied any relationship with Graham Kelly, her legislative director, and said in a statement to The Hill Tuesday that the accusations are coming from her divorce from \u201can abusive husband.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fact is I am going through a divorce from an abusive husband who seems determined to try to humiliate me. I am disgusted that my opponents would seek to exploit such a private matter for political gain,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cAllegations that I have been involved in a relationship with Mr. Kelly are absolutely false,\u201d Hill added. \u201cI am saddened that the deeply personal matter of my divorce has been brought into public view and the vindictive claims of my ex have now involved the lives and reputations of unrelated parties.\u201d\n\nRedState was the first to allege that Hill was involved with Kelly, citing text messages involving Hill's estranged husband.\n\nHill said Wednesday she would fully cooperate with the Ethics Committee investigation.\n\n\u201cI am beyond grateful for the work the Ethics Committee does to ensure transparency in Congress. I welcome this investigation and will be cooperating fully to clear this matter up,\u201d Hill said in a statement.", "description": "Rep.
