It is also the day the three wise men , following a star in the desert night sky, appeared in Bethlehem at Jesus\u2019 side following his birth.\n\nStarting on January 6, Orthodox Eastern European Christians traditionally fast until the appearance of the first star in the night sky symbolising the birth of Jesus.\n\nIt is traditional to greet friends and family with \u201cChrist is born!\u201d and reply with \u201cGlory to him!\u201d\n\nThe Christmas Eve meal is traditionally meat and alcohol-free. It usually consists of 12 dishes symbolising the 12 apostles.\n\nA must on this occasion is \u201ckutia\u201d: a cold porridge-like dish made out of whole wheat, poppy seeds, raisins, walnuts and honey. The rest of the meal varies but frequently includes fried fish and beetroot soup made with vegetable stock, beans and cabbage.\n\nChristmas Day, January 7, starts with a visit to the church. Some Orthodox Christians prefer to go to a midnight mass on Christmas Eve.\n\nChristmas Day lunch comprises of a variety of dishes with the centrepiece of a roast suckling pig or a goose.\n\nContrary to Catholic Christmases, it is not customary to give presents in the Orthodox tradition. Orthodox Christians usually hand out gifts on December 19, St. Nicholas Day, or on New Year\u2019s Eve \u2013 December 31.\n\nMany Orthodox Christian countries use the Gregorian calendar in their day to day lives but often revert to the Julian calendar for their holy festivals.\n\nThe New Year, according to the Julian calendar, is on January 13-14 and the day of the Epiphany, celebrated on January 6 by Catholics, is celebrated by Orthodox Christians on January 19.\n\nOn the day of the Epiphany in the countries that adopted the Gregorian calendar like Bulgaria, and Greece, priests will often throw crucifixes in rivers or lakes which the faithful then dive into to retrieve.\n\nThe ceremony symbolises the baptism of Jesus.\n\nIn Ukraine the period between January 6 and January 19 is a time for \u201cVertep\u201d \u2013 a street puppet theatre performance which is a variation of the nativity play.\n\n\u201cVertep\u201d is accompanied by singing and dancing and has links to pre-Christian traditions. In recent years it has become increasingly popular with children to organise \u201cVertep\u201d performances and raise small amounts of cash.", "description": "Each year on January 6 and 7 millions of Orthodox Christians around the world celebrate Christmas.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/354219/1000x563_354219.jpg", "published_at": "2018-01-07"}
