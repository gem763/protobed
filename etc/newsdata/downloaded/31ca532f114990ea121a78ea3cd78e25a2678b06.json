The process will not be over without a full withdrawal,\u201d he warned.\n\nOn Monday, French President Emmanuel Macron told Putin that France wanted to see an extension of the ceasefire by Turkey. But Erdogan rejected this on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThere is no such proposal that was conveyed to me from Macron. Macron is in fact talking about such things mostly with terrorists,\u201d Erdogan said, referring to a meeting between Jihane Ahmed, the spokeswoman for the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), and the French leader.\n\nAnkara says the YPG is a \u201cterrorist\u201d offshoot of the PKK, which has been waging an insurgency inside Turkey since 1984. The PKK is blacklisted as a terrorist group by Ankara, the United States and the European Union.", "description": "Sochi (Russia) (AFP) \u2013 Russian President Vladimir Putin held talks with Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Tuesday as the Turkish leader threatened to restart", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/22/c378ba_moscow-position-has-strengthened-by-us-president-donald-trump-announcement-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
