The advantage of this Bill is that it enshrines the date in law.\u201d\n\nShe said the \u201ctime pressure\u201d involved in securing an election before a delayed Article 50 deadline meant the party would not pursue amendments such as votes for 16-year-olds to the Bill.\n\nThe PM has requested a three-month extension from Brussels, as per the terms of the Benn Act.\n\n\u201cI would love to see votes for 16\u2026 but I recognise that the time pressure we are under right now doesn\u2019t give us that luxury \u2013 January 31 isn\u2019t that far away,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Lib Dems said their Bill would not allow a general election unless Brexit was delayed until at least January 31 in order to push back the threat of leaving the European Union without an agreement \u2013 a move they hope will entice Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour Party to back it.\n\nShadow home secretary Diane Abbott said Labour would \u201cdiscuss\u201d what was being proposed with opposition colleagues.\n\nMr Corbyn had previously said he wanted to wait for the EU\u2019s decision over the length of the Article 50 extension before deciding whether to whip MPs in support of Mr Johnson\u2019s bid for a winter election.\n\nMs Abbot told Marr: \u201cWe\u2019ll discuss it with (Ms Swinson). What is problematic about the Bill is not necessarily the notion of an election on December 9, it\u2019s that the Bill is calling on the EU to give us an extension.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t dictate to the EU what length of extension they want to give. We have to hear from them.\u201d\n\nShadow home secretary Diane Abbott (Commons/PA)\n\nBut shadow health sectary Jon Ashworth struck a more combative note when he labelled the Lib Dem-SNP proposal \u201centirely ridiculous\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a stunt so the Lib Dems can get on the telly today,\u201d he told Sky News.\n\nA fresh opinion poll from researchers Opinium made for worrying reading for Labour, putting the Tories 16 points clear of the main opposition party.\n\nOpinium\u2019s survey predicts the Tories would take 40% of the vote, Labour 24% and the Lib Dems and Brexit Party following with 15 and 10 points respectively.\n\nMr Ashworth admitted he could see the polling was \u201cnot great\u201d for his party but said he thought Labour could \u201cwin people over to our programme\u201d during an election.", "description": "Culture Secretary Nicky Morgan said the Government would still be asking MPs to approve its own motion for an election on Monday.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/12/wire-20242710-1572178151-319_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
