Then she started getting compliments.\n\n\"I actually sing a lot but I never show people that I can do it so this is really a new experience for me,\" Poker told Labrador Morning, adding that it's important to her to sing in Innu-aimun because it's her first language.\n\nSam Rich is one of the teenagers singing about their hopes and dreams for the future in the community. (Facebook )\n\nSeven high school students at the Mushuau Innu Natuashish School produced the song with guidance from N'we Jinan, which means \"we live here\" in James Bay (Eastern) Cree. The organization has worked with hundreds of Indigenous youth across the country, giving them an opportunity to express themselves through art and music.\n\nN'we Jinan executive director David Hodges and videographer Andrei Savu travelled to Natuashish for a week with a mobile studio and helped the students tell stories from their own perspective.\n\n\"This is really about amplifying Indigenous youth voices and giving them different opportunities to connect through the arts,\" Hodges said.\n\n'Teenagers are sad'\n\nMushuau Uassits begins with Gwen singing:\n\nDo you see it's hard\n\nwhen there's nothing to do\n\nPeople drown in the dark\n\nso I'm running to you\n\n\"I like the lyrics,\" Poker said. \"It's about my hometown and what the situations are that's in Nat, like the drinking.\"\n\nShe wants adults to know what teens are going through, and that youth need more activities to do in the community, she said.\n\nI'm proud because I'm doing this. I'm doing the hip hop. - Garfield Rich\n\n\"Teenagers are sad, and the adults don't even know,\" she said, adding that parents need to spend more time with their children.\n\n\"They need to talk to them. Tell them how they feel,\" Poker said. \"It would make them feel loved, and wanted, that they matter.\"\n\nHer own family shows her love every day, she said, and she wants all of her friends to feel that way.\n\n\"My friends go through stuff. They always come over to my place because of their parents' drinking,\" she said, noting that her parents are sober and don't drink.\n\nAmplifying youth voices\n\nThe song created by the Natuashish youth has a strong, positive message to show where they're at in their personal lives, Hodges said. Hip hop is music that speaks to the teens' language, he said, as in the song's chorus:\n\nThe non-profit N'we Jinan works with Indigenous youth through its mobile studio program to produce songs from their perspective. (Submitted by David Hodges)\n\nWe are strong and we are proud\n\nWe're the future singing\n\nInnu-nikamu\n\nHear our voices, hear the sounds\n\nInnu Uassits\n\nInnu Eenouch\n\nWe love our land\n\nInnu Aitun\n\nHodges said working with Indigenous youth is about showing them that they have worth. The teenagers about their potential and value when given an opportunity to talk about the things that matter to them, he said.\n\nN'we Jinan's Dre records a video for the Natuashish high school students' song, Mushuau Uassits. (Submitted/David Hodges )\n\n\"Most of the time, young people never get the chance to really express themselves in a way they feel they're being heard,\" Hodges said.\n\n\"Most young people just feel like adults or people in their community, or people surrounding them, don't really care.\"\n\nThe group's job, he said, is to provide a safe and fun environment for learning while also creating something that is \"positive and super-impactful\" for their community and the surrounding communities.\n\nA strong message\n\n\"I'm proud because I'm doing this. I'm doing the hip hop,\" says Garfield Rich, 16. \"It was great, and I liked it.\"\n\nThe Natuashish high school students' hip-hop song describes their pride of being Innu, but also the struggles they face as teenagers. (Submitted/David Hodges )\n\nAlthough he expected it to be hard at first, Rich said he got into expressing himself through the writing process:\n\nNo more fighting, no more drinking\n\nThere's people dying, there's people missing\n\nThere's people crying, use our tradition\n\nInnu Natukun, the medicine is giving\n\n\"Me and my friends come up with it, and we started to write, and then we gave it to David. He was like, 'Whoa, whoa' and he liked it,\" he said of the lyrics.\n\nThe song is about \"sad stuff\" in the community, said Rich, who wants parents to \"sober up and teach something else to their kids. Teach them, teach them how to hunt.\"\n\nIt's an issue that's close to him, Rich said, because he's lost people himself.\n\nThe N'we Jinan Natuashish artists are Gwen Poker, Sam Rich, Cavelle Rich, Jersey Tshakapesh, Garfield Rich, Tyrese Rich and Cole Piwas.\n\nThe next step for the teens is fundraising to go to Montreal in April to attend an arts festival and youth conference organized by N'we Jinan, where they will perform their song.\n\nRead more from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador", "description": "A group of teenagers in Natuashish worked with a music producer to write and record a hip-hop song expressing their pride \u2014 and their struggles.", "authors": ["Cbc Reporter", "John Gaudi Reports Happy Valley-Goose Bay For Cbc'S Labrador Morning.", "Follow John Gaudi On Twitter"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5334056.1571944518!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/natuashish-hip-hop-kids.JPG", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
