At street corners around downtown Cairo, police in riot gear sit in trucks, waiting. The presence of plainclothes security agents has grown.\n\nThroughout the week, the Egyptian government has been preparing for this day, widening its biggest security crackdown in years. A once-obscure whistleblower, Mohamed Ali, whose videos alleging high-level corruption have struck a chord with frustrated Egyptians, is urging millions to protest on Friday.\n\nTheir goal: to demand the fall of authoritarian President Abdel Fatah al-Sissi.\n\n\u201cWe are going to protest because we are on the right side, the good side,\u201d said Mohamed Ali Shawky, 19, a university student. \u201cWe are doing this because we believe in the justice of our cause. That is what is making us stronger even when we are scared to death. It gives us faith, even when the regime has weapons and soldiers.\u201d\n\nWhether large numbers of protesters will join Shawki remains to be seen, but the Arab world\u2019s most populous nation is already more tense than at any moment since Sissi took office five years ago. Last Friday, several hundred protesters took to the streets in a demonstration that amounted to the biggest challenge to Sissi\u2019s rule.\n\nSince then, the government has arrested more than 1,900 people, according to the Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights, and the number is likely to rise. Many were nabbed in random sweeps near downtown\u2019s Tahrir Square, the epicenter of Egypt\u2019s 2011 Arab Spring uprising that toppled longtime autocratic president Hosni Mubarak. Others were arrested in areas known to be populated by those who had joined the 2011 revolution, activists said.\n\nOpposition politicians, journalists and activists have also been taken into custody, along with at least seven foreigners, as the Sissi government attempts to portray the emerging dissent as orchestrated by political foreign forces. Sissi, in a meeting with President Trump this week at U.N. General Assembly in New York, blamed the protests on \u201cpolitical Islamic groups.\u201d\n\nThe government has warned foreign correspondents to properly cover the unfolding events, even as it released a second statement Thursday saying that it has allowed hundreds of foreign correspondents to operate freely.\n\nThe changing tenor against Sissi on Egypt\u2019s streets is dividing the nation. In some corners, it has triggered a backlash against efforts to bring his government down. Many Egyptians, especially in upper middle class and affluent areas, remember how the 2011 revolts led to political and economic chaos, shattering the nation\u2019s all-important tourism industry. After last Friday\u2019s protests, Egypt\u2019s stock markets tumbled, triggering more apprehension.\n\nSuch fears have also been stoked by the government. It has mounted its own campaign in state-run newspapers and television, as well as on social media, to portray Sissi as honest and trustworthy.\n\nAmr Adeeb, a well-known pro-government television host, this week showed footage of a group of foreigners, including Palestinian, Jordanian and Turkish nationals, apparently \u201cconfessing\u201d that they were plotting against Egypt. No evidence was provided, however.\n\nThe government has also accused the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood movement of orchestrating the protests. Its candidate, Mohamed Morsi, became Egypt\u2019s first democratically elected president in 2012. A year later, the Egyptian army ousted Morsi in a coup engineered by Sissi, who was the nation\u2019s top military general at the time.\n\nOn Friday, pro-Sissi groups were planning to stage their own rally in the Nasr City enclave of Cairo.\n\nSince Sissi took office in 2014, his security forces have arrested tens of thousands of Muslim Brotherhood members and other opponents. Human rights groups have accused his government of widespread torture and other abuses. Hundreds of websites deemed anti-Sissi have been blocked, while most forms of independent media have been silenced.\n\nUnder Sissi, the army has grown more powerful. It owns countless businesses and is widely seen by many Egyptians as corrupt.\n\nSo when Ali, a disgruntled former government building contractor, began posting his videos online in early September from his self-exiled perch in Spain, millions across Egypt and the Arab world tuned in. The videos accuse Sissi and his generals of squandering millions in taxpayer funds to build villas, a hotel and palaces. That has angered millions of Egyptians who are suffering from rising prices and lowered state subsidies under Sissi. A third of the country\u2019s population is mired in extreme poverty.\n\nNow, Ali is calling for even larger demonstrations \u2014 \u201ca million-man march\u201d on Friday \u2014 and the government is taking no chances, even arresting those it suspects could influence protesters.\n\nThe detainees included Hazem Hosni, a political science professor and former elections spokesman for Sami Amman, a retired general who was arrested after he announced his candidacy to run against Sissi in a presidential election last year. Also taken into custody was Hassan Nafaa, a well-known journalist, and Khaled Dawood, a former politician and journalist.\n\nEgyptians on social media and in interviews said police and security agents have confiscated cellphones from people in downtown Cairo, especially near Tahrir Square. The phones\u2019 contents, including private photos, were inspected for any signs of participation in the protests. In some cases, security forces have beaten people for refusing to give up their phones.\n\nStill, there remains a sense of defiance among many Egyptians. Shawky, the student demonstrator, insisted that his real name be used, saying that he took part in last Friday\u2019s protests as well because he was \u201cfed up.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is not only one reason,\u201d said Shawky. \u201cI am suffering, seeing and living all this corruption, ignorance, sickness, repression and murder.\u201d\n\nHe joined not solely because of Ali\u2019s allegations, but because his videos \u201crepresent a chance, an opportunity for people to revive what has been dead,\u201d Shawky said. \u201cThese videos gave people the chance to regroup, and it . . . disclosed the corruption of this regime even more bluntly.\u201d\n\nMost of his friends who took part in last Friday\u2019s protests have been arrested, he said.\n\nOn Thursday, Ali released another video calling for protesters to avoid Tahrir Square and to protest in front of mosques and other venues across Cairo and other cities.\n\nShawky is listening.\n\n\u201cI pray to God this passes safely and smoothly,\u201d he said. \u201cI won\u2019t go to Tahrir. I will wait until a protest shapes up in any of the local areas around Matareya or Boulak or elsewhere. Hopefully, we will be able to gather.\u201d\n\nRead more\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "Security forces have launched a broad crackdown as they seek to prevent large protests called by a whistleblower amid frustrations over poverty and repression.", "authors": ["Sudarsan Raghavan", "Cairo Bureau Chief Covering North Africa", "Heba Farouk Mahfouz", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/CT_gMgj4WJlSgrIzZvPBId8xBW4=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HKGJOBG564I6TMMZ6Y4L6LBUB4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
