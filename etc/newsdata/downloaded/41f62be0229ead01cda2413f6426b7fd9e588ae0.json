Domestic banks with under $700 billion in assets, which includes all but a handful of the nation\u2019s largest firms, would enjoy some degree of relaxed capital and liquidity rules.\n\nFed staff estimated the final rules would lower capital requirements by about 0.6% and liquidity requirements would drop by about 2% for all affected banks.\n\nGlobally systemically important U.S. banks, including JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), Citigroup Inc (C.N), Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) would not benefit from the changes however.\n\nOn Thursday the Fed also finalized a new regulatory regime for foreign banks operating in the United States. The rules relax capital, liquidity and stress testing requirements for subsidiaries of foreign banks but retain stricter standards for firms that engage in riskier activities like short-term funding.\n\nThursday\u2019s rules package also includes a relaxed schedule for when foreign and domestic banks must submit \u201cliving wills\u201d to the regulator detailing how they could be safely dissolved.\n\nIn a win for foreign banks, the Fed said it was no longer considering establishing its own stricter liquidity requirements for foreign bank branches. Instead, the Fed will work with international regulators on the issue. The Fed had previously considered stricter rules for branches out of a concern that overseas lenders could use them to shield assets from oversight.\n\nBut the Fed opted to apply a higher liquidity standard to all larger lenders in its final rule.\n\nIn its original proposal, the Fed sought comment on setting a reduced liquidity ratio for larger firms somewhere between 70% and 85% of the full requirement for global banks. In the final rule, the Fed stuck to the high end of that scale for banks with over $250 billion in assets.", "description": "The U.S. Federal Reserve on Thursday unveiled a final package of rules easing capital and liquidity requirements for domestic U.S. and foreign banks that were originally introduced following the 2007-2009 global financial crisis.", "authors": ["Pete Schroeder", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439375121&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF991WD", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
