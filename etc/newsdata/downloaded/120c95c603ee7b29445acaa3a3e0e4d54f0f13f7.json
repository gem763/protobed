One Sunday a month, the city bans cars from the city center.\n\nLondon charges a congestion fee for entering the busiest neighborhoods (something New York will do in 2021 and Los Angeles is considering).\n\nSelf-driving cars could add to the gridlock, which is why the National Association of City Transportation Officials (NACTO) published a blueprint to help cities get ready for the autonomous era.\n\n\"What we would really like to see happen is AV tech to be used as tool to meet their transportation goals, rather than using AVs as an end goal themselves.\" says NACTO policy associate Sudha Bharadwaj.\n\nTo be effective, AVs need to be shared, say researchers at the Institute of Transportation Studies at University of California-Davis.\n\nWithout pooling, vehicle use would increase 15\u201320% by 2050, according to the report.\n\nThe catch: Most Americans prefer to commute in private vehicles, one study found.\n\nCarpooling peaked during the 1970s energy crisis, dropping from 20% in 1980 to less than 10% today, says UC-Davis professor Dan Sperling.\n\nMass transit accounts for just 1% of all U.S. passenger miles traveled, and just 2% of total trips, he says.\n\nTransportation network companies like Uber and Lyft have siphoned riders away from public transit systems, which are declining as a result.\n\n\"TNCs have shown that people are crying out for higher quality mobility services,\" Sperling tells Axios.\n\nWhat's needed: Cities need to revamp their transportation policies to discourage single-passenger vehicles and encourage autonomous ride-sharing and public transit, experts say. A few cities have already seen early successes:\n\nIn Seattle more people are riding the bus and a new light rail system after the city invested to improve public transit.\n\nVancouver boosted transit ridership via SkyTrain, the world\u2019s longest automated rail network, which hauls more than 495,000 passengers per day.\n\nL.A. is partnering with Via, an on-demand shuttle service, to give people rides to busy public transit stations.\n\nThe bottom line: \"If you give people other options for getting around, they\u2019ll take them, as long as they're reasonable and convenient,\" NACTO's Alex Engel tells Axios.", "description": "But cities need to revamp their transportation policies to discourage single-passenger vehicles.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/NJ4_kgQoYzT1IRw8gxBm9UuDxgE=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/10/09/1570638128698.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
