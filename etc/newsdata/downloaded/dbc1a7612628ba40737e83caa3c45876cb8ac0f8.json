They stand for democracy and human rights, but we are still waiting for this stance to begin.\u201d\n\nKhashoggi, a Saudi journalist who was critical of his country\u2019s government, was killed on October 2 last year in a planned operation carried out by top aides to bin Salman.\n\nHe had gone to the Saudi consulate in Istanbul to collect papers he needed to marry Cengiz. The two had met at a conference in May last year and were planning their lives together.\n\nThe Turkish doctoral student said goodbye to him at the gates of the consulate. \u201cSee you soon. Wait for me here,\u201d he told her. She waited outside for hours, and even returned the next day. But she would never see him again.\n\nIn the days after his disappearance, Saudi officials would deny any knowledge of his whereabouts. The official story shifted as new information was released by Turkish investigators, until eventually the Saudi government claimed the murder was carried out by rogue agents acting independently.\n\nThe CIA and some Western governments would later come to the conclusion that the crown prince had personally ordered Khashoggi\u2019s killing. Bin Salman has repeatedly denied any involvement.\n\nEleven people are currently on trial for the killing in Saudi Arabia, but his body has never been found.\n\nRead more\n\n\u2018Jamal is protecting us\u2019: Saudis reflect year after Khashoggi murder\n\nOver the past year, Cengiz has been relentless in pursuit of the truth about what happened to her partner, and refused to allow his name to disappear from the headlines.\n\n\u201cMy life has changed completely,\u201d she says. \u201cI used to lead a simple, modest life, and now I have a huge responsibility, to be the face of Jamal on the international stage, in the media. I had wanted only to be Jamal\u2019s wife, and his companion.\u201d\n\nTo this day, Cengiz doesn\u2019t fully understand why the decision was taken to murder her fianc\u00e9e.\n\n\u201cJamal was not in complete opposition to them, he was from that country and he worked close to them. But he disagreed with them on certain issues, and this angered them; he wrote for an American paper and his voice had a lot of reach. He was a patriotic person and loved his country. He was optimistic about his future,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cHe was not only a journalist, he was a great man, and not only to me. I lost my partner, and Muslims and the world lost a great man.\u201d\n\nIn an interview broadcast this weekend, Mohammad bin Salman told CBS's 60 Minutes that he ultimately bore \"full responsibility\" for the killing a year ago, but he denied ordering it.\n\nDespite Western intelligence agencies linking Bin Salman to Khashoggi\u2019s death, there has been little appetite for any meaningful break in ties with Saudi Arabia. US President Donald Trump described it as the \"worst cover-up in history\", but he has insisted Washington\u2019s relationship with the kingdom was too lucrative to dismiss.", "description": "The fianc\u00e9e of murdered journalist Jamal Khashoggi has called for the international community to hold his killers accountable, one year on from his death.In an interview with The Independent, Hatice Cengiz says there has been \u201cno accountability\u201d for the murder, believed to have been ordered by the Saudi", "authors": ["Richard Hall"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/0icQSOXEu2mZcACa9aQSUQ--~B/aD0zNTE7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/b020a7cfe6798b9edec524a26364a744"}
