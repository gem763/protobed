Doug Collins (R-Ga.), ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, blasted Democrats Wednesday for jumping to conclusions about President Trump's call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky before knowing the facts.\n\n\u201cThe transcript between President Trump and Ukrainian President Zelensky reveals that Democrats have again leapt to conclusions before looking at the facts,\" he said in a statement. \"There was no quid pro quo and nothing to justify the clamor House Democrats caused yesterday. The real danger here is that Democrats keep using baseless accusations in hopes of crippling a successful presidency.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, he reminded the American public that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's announcement of an impeachment inquiry is essentially meaningless at this point.\n\n\"Speaker Pelosi\u2019s decree changes absolutely nothing,\" he tweeted. \"As I have been telling Chairman Nadler for weeks, merely claiming the House is conducting an impeachment inquiry doesn\u2019t make it so. Until the full House votes to authorize an inquiry, nobody is conducting a formal inquiry.\"\n\nSpeaker Pelosi\u2019s decree changes absolutely nothing. As I have been telling Chairman Nadler for weeks, merely claiming the House is conducting an impeachment inquiry doesn\u2019t make it so. Until the full House votes to authorize an inquiry, nobody is conducting a formal inquiry. \u2014 Rep. Doug Collins (@RepDougCollins) September 24, 2019\n\nIn a statement, he explained that Pelosi's move is not \"what impeachment looks like.\"\n\nThis is the first partisan \u201cimpeachment\u201d in the history of the republic, and the real victims are the American people. The chaos that began in the #JudiciaryCommittee is now seeping into the rest of the House. Full statement here: https://t.co/2K6cnCTLMY \u2014 Rep. Doug Collins (@RepDougCollins) September 25, 2019\n\n\u201cNo matter how many Democrats subscribe to the fantasy that the House began an impeachment inquiry\u2014whether in March, July, August or September\u2014neither Chairman Nadler nor Speaker Pelosi have unilateral authority to launch one,\" he said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cThis is the first partisan \u2018impeachment\u2019 in the history of the republic, and the real victims are the American people. They elected Donald Trump to be our president and their representatives to solve the border crisis and support a growing economy. Instead of accepting those facts, Democrats are sowing chaos, not producing legislative solutions. The chaos began in the Judiciary Committee, and now it\u2019s seeping into the rest of the House.\u201d", "description": ".09/25/2019 19:27:41PM EST.", "authors": ["Leah Barkoukis", "Matt Vespa", "Cortney O'Brien", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/39/936f0413-c664-40c9-8636-e2a935dc6bff.png", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
