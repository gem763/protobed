USA TODAY\n\nHOUSTON - Justin Verlander, one of the last players left in the Houston Astros\u2019 clubhouse Wednesday night, long after their humiliating loss to the Washington Nationals prompted a players-only meeting.\n\nHe looked at the remaining reporter by his locker, laughed, and pointed at his right shin.\n\n\u201cI was wondering why my shin is sore,\u2019\u2019 Verlander told USA TODAY Sports. \u201cSeriously. I was putting my pants on and thought, 'Man, it\u2019s sore right there.\u2019 I forgot the ball went off it.\n\n\u201cDamn, everything that could go wrong, did go wrong.\u2019\u2019\n\nVerlander laughed again, recalling the fourth inning play when he went scrambling for Ryan Zimmerman\u2019s soft hit to the right of the mound, diving, grabbing the ball bare-handed, and while trying to throw the ball between his legs, nailed his own leg.\n\n\u201cThe first 75 percent of that play was pretty (expletive) athletic,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cThe other 25 percent, not so much.\u2019\u2019\n\nJustin Verlander tried to make a play while falling down and ended up throwing the ball into his own leg \ud83d\ude02 pic.twitter.com/skNCND0NTE \u2014 FOX Sports: MLB (@MLBONFOX) October 24, 2019\n\nThe same, of course, can be said about the Astros\u2019 evening, watching a close game against the Washington Nationals disintegrate into utter embarrassment, resulting in a 12-3 loss.\n\nThe Nationals are halfway home to the first World Series title in Washington, D.C., since 1924, leading 2 games to 0, and dominating the heavily-favored Astros in every phase of the game.\n\n\u201cClearly, the Nats have outplayed us, bottom line,\" said Astros manager A.J. Hinch. \"They came into our building and played two really good games. We're going to have to try to sleep off the latter third of this game. \u2026\n\n\u201cThey're halfway to a race to four wins. Clearly, Game 3 becomes critical for us. I doubt the Nats are going to feel too confident that they have this sewed up and they can start planning the parade. We're going to give them a fight for it.\u2019\u2019\n\nWell, they better start quickly, because this World Series could be over by the weekend.\n\nJustin Verlander earned the loss in Game 2 of the World Series. (Photo: Troy Taormina, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nThe Astros, despite co-Cy Young favorites Gerrit Cole and Verlander taking the mound for Games 1 and 2, just watched them become first 20-game winners to lose the first two games of the World Series since Don Drysdale and Sandy Koufax of the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1965.\n\nThey will be trying to become only the second team since 1985 to lose their first two games at home and still win a best-of-seven series, and the first since the New York Yankees over the Atlanta Braves in 1996.\n\n\u201cI remember when we lost three in a row in New York (during the 2017 ALCS)\u2019\u2019 Astros third baseman Alex Bregman said, \u201cand the world was coming to an end. And the next thing you know, we\u2019re in the World Series. We\u2019ve been here before.\u2019\u2019\n\nAnd to a man, they believe this is the best team they\u2019ve ever been a part of in their lives.\n\n\u201cNot a lot of teams win 107 games,\u2019\u2019 Astros shortstop Carlos Correa said. \u201cThis is a special team. If there\u2019s a team out there that can do it, it\u2019s us.\u2019\u2019\n\nWell, they better hurry, or their season will come to an end this weekend.\n\nIf they weren\u2019t alarmed by this sudden turn of events, Verlander wouldn\u2019t\u2019 have called a players-only meeting after the game to discuss their woeful play, with ALCS MVP Jose Altuve jumping in and speaking.\n\n\u201cThose two said everything that needed to be said,\u2019\u2019 Astros outfielder Josh Reddick said. \u201cThere was nothing left that needed to be said.\u2019\u2019\n\nThey have been sloppy in the field. Reckless on the basepaths. Clueless in the clutch. And getting a whole lot of bad breaks.\n\nMaybe Nats starter Stephen Strasburg, who pitched yet another brilliant postseason game, raising his record to 4-0 with a 1.93 ERA, actually said it best after the Nats won the pennant.\n\n\u201cYou have a great year, and you can run into a buzz saw,\u2019\u2019 Strasburg said. \u201cMaybe this year, we\u2019re the buzz saw.\u2019\u2019\n\nWho would have imagined it, particularly coming from a team that was 19-31 in May, and now are two victories away from becoming only the second team in history to win a World Series being 12 games under .500?\n\n\u201cI think then it was kind of where we got our attitude,\u2019\u2019 said Nats third baseman Anthony Rendon , \u201cand said, Screw everybody else, we're not worrying about what's going outside of our clubhouse. We have to worry about the 25 guys that are in here and that are actually grinding.\u2019\u2019\n\nPardon the Astros for now stealing their mantra, with everyone now counting them out.\n\nThe Astros, outside Verlander, were quiet in the clubhouse. There was no music. No loud voices. Yet, they were unanimously defiant.\n\nYou want to believe they\u2019re in trouble.\n\nThey\u2019ll tell you it\u2019s no big deal.\n\n\u201cWe feel great,\u2019\u2019 outfielder Michael Brantley said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we won so many games in the regular season. This is a good team. We believe in one another. We have all of the confidence in the world.\"\n\nReally, the Astros\u2019 confidence was almost eerie after the game, with no signs of panic, distress, or even worry.\n\nNATS:Astros facing the unthinkable after Game 2 loss\n\nNEW LEADER: Move over Smoltz, JV new strikeout king\n\nThis is a team that just suffered their biggest postseason rout in franchise history. Only two teams in baseball history has given up more than 17 runs at home in their first two games at home. And they\u2019re playing a team that has won eight consecutive games, tied for the longest streak in postseason history.\n\nAnd, yet, there was Verlander, still cracking jokes, and loving Chicago Cubs\u2019 starter Yu Darvish\u2019s revenge tweet when he showed the video of Verlander throwing the ball against his leg, and wrote:\n\n\u201cJustin\u2026.Not doing a lot here to help us dispel the pitchers\u2019 aren\u2019t athletes thing.\u2019\u2019\n\nYep, just like Verlander tweeted about Darvish in 2018 when Darvish hit a double, slipped and fell rounding second base.\n\n\u201cI saw Darvish make fun of me,\u2019\u2019 Verlander said, \u201cand that was great. He\u2019s probably been waiting in the weeds forever, waiting for his opportunity for me to do something stupid.\u2019\u2019\n\nJustin.... \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f. Not doing a lot here to help us dispel the pitchers aren\u2019t athletes thing.https://t.co/Ne5E1FXEe2https://t.co/5UyZlpLyg9 \u2014 \u30c0\u30eb\u30d3\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u6709(Yu Darvish) (@faridyu) October 24, 2019\n\nVerlander will settle on just getting that first World Series victory, winless in five starts, but needs at least two victories by his teammates to assure there will be a Game 6 where he would be scheduled to pitch again.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t dwell on win-loss record anymore, do we?\u2019\u2019 Verlander cracked. \u201cI\u2019d like to win a couple. Hopefully, I\u2019ll get another opportunity.\u2019\u2019\n\nIf Verlander is going to pitch again this year, the Astros are going to need Zack Greinke to step up in Game 3, and rely on a bullpen game in Game 4. Someone needs to slow down the Nats\u2019 offense, which has hit .307 in the first two games, producing 23 hits and five homers.\n\n\u201cTop to bottom, I hadn\u2019t really paid that much attention to the National League,\u2019\u2019 Verlander said. \u201cThey\u2019re way better than what people were saying. Obviously, those guys in the middle (Anthony Rendon and Juan Soto) get a lot of headlines, but the rest of that lineup is legit. They can hit. And they work it. They have good approaches. They change their approach. They adjust from at-bat to an at-bat. It\u2019s a grind. You got your work cut out for you when you\u2019re out there.\n\n\u201cYou need those soft hits to be outs.\u2019\u2019\n\nWell, at least once in a while, but the Nationals keep putting the ball in play, striking out just 18 times in 75 at-bats.\n\n\u201cEverything they hit,\u2019\u2019 Astros catcher Martin Maldonado said, \u201cis a hit.\u2019\u2019\n\nSays Altuve: \u201cJust everything is going their way right now. Everything. Sooner or later, things are going to go our way.\u2019\u2019\n\nThey\u2019ve gone too far, played too great all season, to just roll over now.\n\nThey kept reminding themselves of that as they sauntered out of the clubhouse, preparing for their first games in Washington, D.C., since 2014, believing they\u2019ll be back in Houston next week, and not watching a Nats\u2019 parade on TV.\n\n\u201cPlayoffs are one game,\u2019\u2019 Verlander said. \u201cWould we rather be up 2-0, yeah. But things change. Things will start going our way.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be fine. Believe me. We\u2019ll be fine.\u2019\u2019\n\nFollow Bob Nightengale on Twitter: @Bnightengale", "description": "The Astros will try to become only the second team since 1985 to lose their first two games at home and still win the World Series vs. Nationals.", "authors": ["Bob Nightengale", "Published A.M.
