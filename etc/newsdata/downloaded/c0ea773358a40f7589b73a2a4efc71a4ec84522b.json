Winifred Watson stood her ground, persuaded her publisher to put the book out in spite of their worries about its risqu\u00e9 nature, and it became a huge hit. But that\u2019s only part of the story \u2013 which has an unusual and enchanting afterlife.\n\nMost of this story is beautifully told in the 2000 introduction to Persephone Books\u2019 edition by the retired Cambridge academic Henrietta Twycross-Martin. She describes it as a Cinderella-style fairytale full of surprises, ups, downs and then, happily, more ups.\n\nInitially \u2013 as noted \u2013 Miss Pettigrew was successfully brought to publication in 1938 and sold well, both in the UK and the US. It was translated into French, and the film rights were sold to Hollywood. Billie Burke, fresh from starring in The Wizard of Oz as the Good Witch of the North, was lined up to play Miss Pettigrew. But then the second world war started. The French translation didn\u2019t make it into shops thanks to the German invasion, while the film never happened because Hollywood studios were now focused \u201con making morale-boosters\u201d. Miss Pettigrew didn\u2019t fit the bill, no matter how cheering it might have been.\n\n\u201cIt was a disappointment,\u201d Watson said years later. \u201cI wish the Japanese had waited six months.\u201d At least the experience hadn\u2019t deprived her of her impish sense of humour.\n\nBut the war did effectively end her writing career. She released a novel called Leave and Bequeath in 1943 (\u201cpart murder-mystery and part psychological study set in a contemporary upper-class milieu in London and the home counties,\u201d according to Twycross-Martin) \u2013 but that was the last one. When her house in Jesmond (she spent almost her entire life in the suburbs of Newcastle) was bombed, she and her young family had to move in with her mother. This stopped her from producing any more novels. \u201cYou can\u2019t write if you are never alone,\u201d she later told Twycross-Martin.\n\nOf course, the fact that she came to speak to Twycross-Martin at all is a good indication of a happy ending. The academic came across the story when Persephone Quarterly magazine asked for recommendations for books to publish. She remembered her mother\u2019s favourite book, took it along to the publisher\u2019s office and they asked her to write an introduction. Researching Watson\u2019s life proved hard; there was precious little information about her as Methuen\u2019s records had also fallen victim to the war. But eventually she found an address for one Winifred Watson in Newcastle from 1974 and telephoned, on the off-chance that someone might know where the author was. \u201cTo our complete astonishment and delight,\u201d writes Twycross-Martin, \u201ca firm Newcastle voice replied, \u2018I am she.\u2019\u201d\n\nThis wonderful moment enabled Twycross-Martin to interview the then 93-year-old writer and get the biographical information that informs her splendid introduction. This done, the book was published in 2000 to a new round of rapturous reviews and thousands of sales. The success prompted the Times to send Anne Sebba to interview Watson. \u201cWell, it\u2019s rather nice, and most heartwarming,\u201d Watson said of her second burst of fame. \u201cBut it\u2019s not the same as when you\u2019re young. I\u2019ve got past all that being excited.\u201d\n\nMiss Pettigrew Lives for a Day: has naughtiness ever been so nice? Read more\n\nShe died two years later. Sadly, she hadn\u2019t lived long enough to see the Hollywood version of the book that eventually came out in 2008. Then again, I watched it last week and: ugh. In spite of the presence of both Amy Adams and Frances McDormand, and some spectacular art deco interiors, it was agonising. \u201cMcDormand is frankly bland and unresponsive in a role she clearly couldn\u2019t care less about; Adams\u2019s wide-eyed ingenue routine is on autopilot, and the whole thing looks like a sub-prime American TV movie,\u201d wrote Peter Bradshaw when the film came out in the UK. He gave it one star. This almost feels generous to a film that mauls this book so cruelly. Gone is the snappy dialogue, the steadily building hilarity of Miss Pettigrew\u2019s growing inebriation, and the sweetness of her being accepted and loved by a total stranger. (In the film, Miss LaFosse actually does think that Miss Pettigrew has come to work for her, thus breaking one of the key bonds in their relationship.)\n\nCuriously, the film is also far more prudish: no cocaine, innuendo or fun. It\u2019s quite a contrast with the book \u2013 but that also demonstrates what Wilson did so well. Even if it\u2019s flawed and problematic in parts, Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day is also rather wonderful, and deserves such a happy ending.", "description": "It took 70 years for Winifred Watson\u2019s novel to get the attention it deserves after world war scuppered her writing career \u2013 though Hollywood should have left it alone", "authors": ["Sam Jordison"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d783866f2bd2f8838d28e54810df376932933390/29_189_2929_1757/master/2929.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=64be7050e17151bc13f7d954b8561e19", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
