It is used to make bracelets, beads and ornaments.\n\nThe critically endangered bird plays a vital ecological role in seed dispersal. It is found in the forests of Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, south Myanmar and south Thailand. It has already been wiped out in Singapore.", "description": "The trade in exotic pets and endangered species is 60 per cent bigger than previously thought, putting 5,000 species at risk of extinction, new research shows.", "authors": ["Helena Horton", "Janet Daley", "Juliet Samuel", "Michael Deacon", "Sarah Champion"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/04/TELEMMGLPICT000210018684-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqXfJMPfENEq5oPh9E8lUElbXot50Qc_vM60sRY4jpCKQ.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
