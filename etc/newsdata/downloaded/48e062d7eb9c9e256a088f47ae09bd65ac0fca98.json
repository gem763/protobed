It\u2019s vibrant and feminine, with tuberose, white flowers, jasmine, orange blossom and ylang-ylang \u2013 given depth by musk and sandalwood. Perfectly balanced and it lasted all day.\n\n\n\nBuy now\n\nByredo slow dance, 50ml: \u00a3110, Byredo\n\nOf all the fragrances we tested, slow dance is the one we found ourselves reaching for most often \u2013 and not just for the Swedish brand\u2019s beautiful minimalist packaging. It\u2019s the perfect blend of classically feminine and masculine notes, both sweet and woody, with patchouli, vanilla and geranium, and stays on the skin all day.\n\n\n\nBuy now\n\nAerin Mediterranean honeysuckle, 50ml: \u00a399, Selfridges\n\nA summer holiday in a bottle, Aerin\u2019s Mediterranean honeysuckle blends citrus \u2013 grapefruit, bergamot and mandarin \u2013 with sweet florals: honeysuckle, lily of the valley and gardenia. It\u2019s light and fresh enough for daytime wear.\n\nBuy now\n\n\n\nLe Labo tonka 25, 50ml: \u00a3127, John Lewis & Partners\n\nCult brand Le Labo, with its simple apothecary-style bottles, rarely launches new scents, and Tonka 25 is its first new one in three years. Far from the overpowering sweetness that the eponymous note suggests, Tonka 25 is cozy and dark with cedar atlas taking centre-stage, as well as orange flower and musk. The perfect autumn fragrance.\n\n\n\nBuy now\n\nJo Malone London poppy & barley cologne, 30ml: \u00a348, John Lewis & Partners\n\nThis is a warm, summer English countryside sort of scent. Floral and golden with notes of rose, violet and blackcurrant as well as poppies, bran and barley \u2013 this is the fragrance equivalent of running through a field of wheat. We could still smell it on skin and clothes at the end of the day.\n\n\n\nBuy now\n\nDS & Durga notorious oud, 100ml: \u00a3220, Harrods\n\nCreated by Brooklyn-based perfumier DS & Durga (we\u2019re already huge fans of the brand\u2019s candles), notorious oud is a rich, opulent and unusual scent. A base of civet and papyrus, middle of oud and rose and top notes of samphor and saffron make for a big, Middle Eastern-inspired fragrance. It\u2019s undeniably a luxury purchase, but if you can afford it, more power to you.\n\n\n\nBuy now\n\nTom Ford metallique, 100ml: \u00a3137.50, Tom Ford\n\nMetal \u2013 invoked here in both name and packaging \u2013 is an unusual note to invoke in a perfume, but think of it metaphorically (strength, armour) rather than literally (that tangy metallic taste) and this fragrance makes more sense. Its blend of bergamot, pink pepper, heliotrope, basalm and sandalwood is at once cool, assertive and feminine.\n\n\n\nBuy now\n\nBvlgari splendida tubereuse mystique eau de parfum, 50ml: \u00a362.05, Escentual\n\nThis is a proper sensuous, night-time scent, with blackcurrant, vanilla and myrrh. Its key ingredient, tuberose \u2013 known as \u201cthe mistress of the night\u201d among perfume nerds for its seductive qualities \u2013 is usually harvested in the morning, but here it is picked in the evening, when it smells richer and creamier.\n\n\n\nBuy now\n\nNars audacious fragrance, 50ml: \u00a3125, Nars Cosmetics\n\nIt\u2019s taken iconic beauty brand Nars 25 years to launch its first fragrance, and 2019 was the year. It is just as bold as its name suggests, with frangipani, smokey incense, musk, cedar and ylang ylang. We love the packaging, which, with its dramatic black glass bottle and a half-sphere cap, looks great on our dressing table.\n\n\n\nBuy now\n\nElie Saab girl of now forever eau de parfum, 90ml: \u00a373.80, Debenhams\n\nDon\u2019t ask us what this perfume\u2019s name means, because we have no idea, but we do know that it\u2019s a delicious, fruity and bright scent, with top notes of lemon and raspberry, middle notes of almond and blackcurrant and a base of patchouli and vanilla. Good enough to eat.\n\n\n\nBuy now\n\nThe verdict: Perfumes of 2019\n\nGabrielle Chanel Essence is at once fresh and classic \u2013 a feminine but complex and not overly floral or sweet fragrance. Byredo, while a little pricier, has quickly become a firm favourite.\n\n\n\nIndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
