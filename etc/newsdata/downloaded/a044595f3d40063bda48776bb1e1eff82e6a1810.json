The carcasses were discovered after the first six elephants plunged to their deaths at the Haew Narok \u2013 \"Ravine of Hell\" - waterfall in Khao Yai National Park in northeastern Thailand, said Sompote Maneerat, spokesman for the National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation Department.\n\nThis photo by Thai News Pix taken on October 5, 2019 shows a dead elephant at the bottom of a waterfall after it fell to its death at Khao Yai National Park in central Thailand. PANUPONG CHANGCHAI\n\nPark officials said the first group of elephants evidently died when trying to reach a dead calf. The new victims are thought to have come from the same herd. The ravines usually fill up with gushing water during the rainy season.\n\nGovernor Nattapong Sirichana said that drones were used to help confirm the total number of dead elephants, Reuters reported.\n\nOfficials said that the death toll of 11 is the highest number of elephants to die in a single incident in Khao Yai. Eight elephants died at the same waterfall almost 30 years ago.\n\nThe elephant population at the park is estimated to be about 300.", "description": "The carcasses were discovered by a drone being used to investigate how the first six elephants plunged to their deaths at the Haew Narok - Ravine of Hell - waterfall in Khao Yai National Park", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/08/e142f3b2-ef65-47f3-b4be-04bf8a64d9f2/thumbnail/1200x630/e4193d32e267b2dfcd25bc0e3c66e870/elephant-gettyimages-1173747454.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
