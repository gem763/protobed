Contract talks began early on Wednesday and were continuing into the evening aimed at reaching a deal, but no agreement was expected immediately.\n\n\"We anticipated there would be an impact because of the strike,\" David Paterson, a spokesman for General Motors in Canada, told Reuters.\n\nThe Oshawa plant will continue to make sedans.\n\nSeparately, Democrats in the U.S. Congress ramped up criticism of GM over its decision to shift health insurance costs for its striking workers to the union and urged the company reach a deal.\n\nRepresentative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democrat, said on Twitter that the decision was \"straight barbarism.\" She added: \"GM workers are asking for a raise during a time of record profits. In response, GM execs cut off their health insurance.\"\n\nMany Democratic presidential candidates have issued similar comments.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Twitter of the dispute: \"Enough of the stonewalling. It\u2019s time for @GM to do the right thing.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Rachit Vats in Bengaluru, Allison Lampert in Montreal and David Shepardson in Washington; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta and Dan Grebler)", "description": "The lay-off announcement came three days after about 48,000 hourly workers went on strike across GM facilities in the United States.
