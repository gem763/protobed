From now on, group members commit to lead their companies \u201cfor the benefit of all stakeholders: customers, employees, suppliers, communities and shareholders.\u201d\n\nFor anyone dismayed by rising inequality, environmental destruction, or any of a host of other social ills, the announcement probably sounded like a nice first step, but many people have long wanted Big Business to put its money where its mouth is. If that includes you, there may be an ETF for that.\n\nThe Conscious Companies ETF KRMA, +0.26% , from a company called Global X, offers the chance to \u201cinvest in well-managed companies that achieve financial performance in a sustainable and responsible manner and exhibit positive Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance (ESG) characteristics.\u201d To do that, KRMA offers exposure to companies achieving positive outcomes for 5 key stakeholders: customers, suppliers, investors, local communities, and employees.\n\nGlobal X launched the fund in 2016 after seeing a gap in the existing ESG (environmental, social and governance investing) landscape, said Jay Jacobs, the company\u2019s head of research and strategy. Most ETF options at that time were, in Jacob\u2019s words, \u201cbenchmark-hugging.\u201d That is, they took a broad index, like the S&P 500, and just stripped out bad actors.\n\nRead: Do well by doing good with this fund that supports freedom and human rights\n\nBut Global-X wanted to come up with a set of ESG companies inclusively, not by default. The team looked to the principles espoused in the movement known as \u201cConscious Capitalism.\u201d That idea started with a book co-written by Whole Foods founder John Mackey and Raj Sisodia, a business professor.\n\n\u201c...Free enterprise capitalism is the most powerful system for social cooperation and human progress ever conceived. It is one of the most compelling ideas we humans have ever had. But we can aspire to even more.\u201d The Conscious Capitalist Credo\n\nKRMA\u2019s index provider was tasked with coming up with a list of companies to achieve those ideals. They use a mixture of public data sources, like surveys on the best companies to work for, as well as private ESG data providers on topics like relationships with suppliers, trustworthiness of CEOs, and more. The index also takes into account a company\u2019s consistency over time, Jacobs told MarketWatch.\n\nAt first glance, that methodology seems to produce some unexpected results. The fund\u2019s top ten holdings currently include three pharmaceutical companies, two regional electrical utilities, and Hershey Co. HSY, -2.31% That\u2019s because the fund isn\u2019t aiming to make \u201csector bets,\u201d Jacobs told MarketWatch, adding that it will generally behave like most U.S. equity funds, but \u201cmore refined.\u201d\n\nSome investors may also find the approach a bit nebulous. Global X produces multimedia materials, like a webinar, to explain its \u201cmulti-stakeholder operating system,\u201d which the company defines as \u201chow a firm manages its relationships with employees, customers, suppliers, investors, and communities.\u201d The materials have plenty of individual examples of this \u201cmulti-stakeholder\u201d approach in action, including Costco\u2019s \u201cstrong relationship with employees\u201d for example, but it may be hard to visualize the overall big picture.\n\nSee: Tired of market turbulence? These ETFs offer to define your financial outcomes\n\nTensie Whelan, director of the Center for Sustainable Business at the NYU Stern School of Business, told MarketWatch that KRMA\u2019s approach looks solid, but she cautioned that investors should know what they\u2019re buying. Because KRMA is agnostic about sectors, some investors may be surprised that the holdings aren\u2019t the typical \u201cimpacting investing\u201d core holdings \u2014 clean energy, for example.\n\nWhelan has conducted research quantifying how certain companies improved their returns by adopting sustainable practices. She wants to encourage companies to consider what she calls a \u201creturn on sustainability investment,\u201d and expects that eventually principles like the ones espoused in conscious capitalism will become the default.\n\nKRMA has about $66 million under management, according to the fund web site. It\u2019s returned 16.04% in the year to date, according to FactSet, and charges a management fee of 0.43%.\n\nThe benchmark S&P 500 SPX, +0.03% is up 15.0% year-to-date.\n\nRelated: Will a lava raft help save the Great Barrier Reef?", "description": "It\u2019s an exchange-traded fund that offers reasonable returns while allowing investors access to a basket of companies that practice good governance as defined...", "authors": ["Andrea Riquier"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GZ875_Medita_ZG_20181206223647.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-28"}
