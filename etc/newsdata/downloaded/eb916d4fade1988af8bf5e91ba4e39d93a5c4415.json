Give your greenhouse a spring (or rather autumn) clean\n\nIf you have a greenhouse then the autumn months present a great time to give it a bit of a facelift. Sweep out old plant debris, remove moss from the nooks and crannies and disinfect the paths, surfaces and glass to banish those tenacious overwintering pests and diseases. If you applied shading paint to avoid overheating in the height of summer, now\u2019s the time to scrub it off to maximise sunlight over the winter months.\n\n2. Plant and transplant\n\nAutumn brings with it regular rain but temperatures haven\u2019t yet plummeted. This means warm, moist soil, which helps plants to settle in and establish robust roots before going dormant for winter. As a result, it\u2019s a great time to move poorly placed plants or stick in some trees, hedging, fruit bushes or roses. With little growth going on above the surface, they can concentrate their energy on spreading their roots.", "description": "Wrap up warm, grab that trowel, and enjoy the dazzling display of autumn colours.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p06l2bb6.jpg"}
