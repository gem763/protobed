Bolton was the in-house skeptic who checked President Trump\u2019s most unorthodox instincts. Whether it was talking to North Korea, cooperating with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia or inviting the Taliban to Camp David, he was the national security adviser who said no.\n\nMr. Bolton\u2019s exit from the West Wing on Tuesday removes one of the last constraints on Mr. Trump\u2019s sense of the possible in world affairs. In not quite three years in the White House, Mr. Trump has cycled through more senior foreign policy and national security advisers than any other president, leaving him without the men who once were considered the adults in the room: Jim Mattis, Rex W. Tillerson, H. R. McMaster, John F. Kelly and more.\n\n\u201cThe departure of Bolton suggests that President Trump is going to be his own foreign policy adviser,\u201d said Martin S. Indyk, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations who served as a diplomat and National Security Council official during the Clinton administration.\n\nAnd no matter who replaces Mr. Bolton, \u201cit\u2019s not going to be an important position anymore \u2014 there really isn\u2019t going to be much of a process under Trump,\u201d said Eliot A. Cohen, who worked for Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice during the administration of President George W. Bush.", "description": "President Trump is now free to command his foreign policy after dumping John R.
