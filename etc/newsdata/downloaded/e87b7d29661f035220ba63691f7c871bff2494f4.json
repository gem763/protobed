At the summit, they ritually slaughtered thousands of sheep, lit candles and prayed during a weeklong ceremony to commemorate the 7th-century Muslim martyr Abbas ibn Ali.\n\nIt\u2019s an event that would have been unthinkable just a few decades ago, when the holy site was home to military barracks and religion was outlawed by Albania\u2019s communist dictatorship.\n\nUnder Albanian leader Enver Hoxha, who served as head of state from 1944 to 1985, Catholic priests were murdered, Sufi dervish lodges were demolished, monasteries were converted into warehouses, and more than 200 clerics of all faiths were jailed.\n\nBut since the ban was lifted in 1990 and the collapse of the regime a year later, the country has seen a mass religious revival.\n\nLarge crosses are common in front of homes and along roads. Public spaces are frequently used for religious events, and a small number of women now wear the hijab. Although in 1989, all Albanian citizens were labeled as \u201catheist,\u201d in 2011 only 2.5 percent identified themselves as such, according to the World Values Survey. In 2002, the city\u2019s main Catholic church opened its doors not far from Hoxha\u2019s mausoleum.\n\n\u201cThe more people believe, the more intolerant they are\u201d \u2014 Mustafa Nano, an Albanian political analyst, on the state of faith in the country\n\nHowever, not everyone is happy with the resurgence of religion in the Balkan nation.\n\nWhile the government has recognized five official religions \u2014 including Islam and Catholicism \u2014 the political establishment remains staunchly secular, keeping in line with a strong tradition that stretches back to the 19th century, when many nationalist leaders believed a non-religious, pan-Albanian identity was the only way to escape the Ottoman Empire\u2019s religious divisions.\n\nAs a result of this distance and otherwise limited resources, religious leaders say they struggle to get funding to rebuild the religious institutions destroyed during the dictatorship and are increasingly forced to seek support elsewhere.\n\n\u201cI am an international beggar,\u201d said Archbishop Anastasios, head of the Orthodox Church of Albania. \u201cWe may not have a church here without the support of Denmark and the [Switzerland-based] World Council of Churches.\u201d\n\n* * *\n\nUnder communism, the gag order on religion was total. \u201cCommunism here was not just atheist but anti-theist,\u201d said Archbishop George Anthony Frendo, speaking in his office behind Tirana\u2019s plain, airy Catholic cathedral. \u201cIt was literally a struggle against God.\u201d\n\nBut the massive resurgence of faith post-1990 is a sign that the government was never fully successful in suppressing it.\n\n\u201cEven when it was illegal, belief was never extinguished completely,\u201d said Artan Rama, a journalist and Orthodox Christian who lives in Tirana. \u201cDuring Orthodox Easter, my grandmother would boil just one egg, dye it red, and give it to me, with no explanation,\u201d he recalled.\n\nShe was afraid of explaining the tradition to her grandson, he later learned, because schoolteachers interrogated young children for signs of illegal religiosity in their families.\n\nNow, \u201cmore people have access to religious knowledge,\u201d said Loreta Aliko, the head of the State Committee on Cults, which mediates relations between religious communities and the state.\n\n\u201cIslam in Albania is completely compatible with human rights and democracy\u201d \u2014 Bujar Spahui, the leader of Albania\u2019s Sunni Muslim community\n\nThe committee provides religious groups with material support, such as electricity and water for places of worship. But trying to rebuild the religious infrastructure that was destroyed under the communist regime has been an uphill climb, she said.\n\nAlthough the country now counts some 800 mosques \u2014 up from zero in 1991 \u2014 it\u2019s still only half the number of mosques that existed in pre-communist Albania, for example.\n\nThe effort is complicated by the government\u2019s reluctance to get further involved.\n\nThe state\u2019s attempts to distance itself from grassroots religious movements have made these communities susceptible to foreign influence. Turkey, for example, has been the most active supporter of Albania\u2019s Muslim community, staking its claim on the fact that Albania used to belong to the Ottoman Empire.\n\nThe Diyanet, Turkey\u2019s religious ministry, is building a grand mosque in the Albanian capital. When it opens its doors next year, it will be the largest mosque in the Balkans.\n\nTurkish authorities are also reconstructing old mosques and Sufi lodges in small towns and villages across Albania. In the historic town of Berat, restoration projects commonly bear plaques noting the financial support of the Turkish Cooperation and Coordination Agency (TIKA).\n\nMembers of Albania\u2019s small but growing Salafi community \u2014 which advocates for a conservative, revivalist strain of Sunni Islam and seeks to return to the religion\u2019s early traditions \u2014 have turned to Saudi Arabia, which has offered scholarships in the Balkans since the 1960s.\n\nMany of the movement\u2019s most prominent members in Albania \u2014 as well as in neighboring Albanian-speaking countries like Kosovo and Macedonia \u2014 were educated in Saudi universities.\n\nThe movement even has its own TV channel \u2014 Peace TV, a branch of the global Salafi media channel created by the extremist Indian preacher Zakir Naik \u2014 that is headquartered in Kosovo but frequently features Albanian preachers as guests, including Genc Plumbi, a graduate of Saudi Arabia\u2019s Al-Imam Muhammad bin Saud Islamic University.\n\nThe Sufi community, too, relies on external support.\n\nBektashi Sufi leaders take regular trips to the holy city of Karbala in Iraq, invited by the keepers of its important Shiite (or Shia) shrines, in an effort to align with the international Shiite community.\n\n\u201cThe Shi\u2019a in Iraq are helping us a lot today,\u201d Edmond Brahimaj, the Bektashi\u2019s Baba Mondi, or world leader, said during the pilgrimage to Mount Tomorr.\n\nThe Albanian government, he implied, is not. \u201cHave you seen the road coming up here? The pilgrimage happens despite the government,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe cannot avoid foreign financial help,\u201d said Aliko, of the Cults Committee, who admits that the state has limited resources.\n\n* * *\n\nFor Albanian politicians, the resurgence in religious belief comes at an awkward time.\n\nThe country, which has been on a path toward accession to the European Union since 2014, is hoping to unblock a long-stalled process and get the green light to start negotiations about joining the bloc.\n\nEuropean leaders are expected to discuss the question of whether to open talks with Albania and North Macedonia this week. Although the European Commission said in May both countries had made the necessary progress on democratic standards and the rule of law, some countries \u2014 notably France and the Netherlands \u2014 worry the western Balkan nations haven\u2019t done enough to root out corruption, organized crime and poverty or reckon with its recent history of conflict.\n\nReligion may also be a consideration for Albania.\n\nMost of its European neighbors are majority Christian. If Albania were to join the EU, it would be its first Muslim-majority country.\n\nSome 61 percent of Albanians identify as Muslim, according to the 2011 census. Catholics make up about 10 percent, with Orthodox citizens at 7 percent.\n\nMuslim leaders insist that the resurgence of Islam among Albanians wouldn\u2019t lead to a culture clash with Europe. \u201cIslam in Albania is completely compatible with human rights and democracy,\u201d said Bujar Spahui, the leader of Albania\u2019s Sunni Muslim community, noting that, for the majority of Albanian Muslims, adhering to sharia (Islamic law) entails following the secular government.\n\nBut in recent years, the government has tried to downplay the size of its Muslim community. In one high-profile break from the country\u2019s secular traditions, Albania\u2019s charismatic basketball player-turned-prime minister, Edi Rama, has declared himself a Catholic and showily courted Pope Francis, who visited Albania on his first foreign trip in 2014.\n\nFor those hoping to be able to swiftly join the EU, there\u2019s concern that Albania\u2019s rediscovery of religiosity could pose a threat to those ambitions, especially if the country\u2019s politicians start to pick sides.\n\n\u201cWhen Albanian politicians are asked about what Albania can bring to the European Union, they tend to say \u2018interreligious tolerance,\u2019\u201d said Mustafa Nano, an Albanian political analyst, who is not religious.\n\n\u201cBut the reason this tolerance existed was because people were not serious believers,\u201d he argued. \u201cThe more people believe, the more intolerant they are.\u201d\n\nKrithika Varagur is an American journalist based in Southeast Asia whose book on Gulf proselytization will be published in the spring.
