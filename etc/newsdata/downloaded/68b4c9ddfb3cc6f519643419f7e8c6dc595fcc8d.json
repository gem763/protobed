The pharmacy chain said all other sizes of the talc would remain on its shelves.\n\n'Retailers are being extra cautious'\n\n\"It's not important at all in terms of the dollar figure to either CVS or J&J. What it tells you is that retailers are being extra cautious with how they are dealing with J&J's voluntary recall,\" Jefferies health-care analyst Jared Holz said.\n\nAll product returned to J&J through the recall process \u2014 whether the product is from the impacted lot or not \u2014 is removed from the marketplace permanently, the company said.\n\nRite Aid had informed its stores to pull all 623 gram bottles of Johnson's Baby Powder from shelves on Oct. 18 and store them in a secure location, company spokesperson Chris Savarese said.\n\n\"Additionally, we've applied a point of sale system block for this product to prevent it from being sold.\"\n\nWalmart has also removed and blocked all potentially impacted baby powder, a company spokesperson said in an emailed statement.\n\nJ&J's voluntary recall was limited to one lot of Johnson's Baby Powder produced and shipped in the United States in 2018, J&J said last week. The company added that testing by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as recently as a month ago found no asbestos in their talc.\n\nCommenting on CVS's move, J&J spokesperson Ernie Knewitz said, \"They are doing it store wide because they don't have the resources to go through at the store level and check all the SKUs (stock keeping units), check all the lot numbers.\"\n\nOther retailers are also expected to remove the product from their shelves as they want to avoid liability, said Eric Schiffer, chief executive officer of private equity firm Patriarch Organization.\n\n\"It wouldn't surprise me to see Amazon and other online retailers do the same,\" he added.\n\nJ&J has known for decades that asbestos lurked in its talc, Reuters reported last year. Internal company records, trial testimony and other evidence show that from at least 1971 to the early 2000s, the company's raw talc and finished powders sometimes tested positive for small amounts of asbestos.\n\nCompany executives, mine managers, scientists, doctors and lawyers fretted over the problem and how to address it, while failing to disclose it to regulators or the public, Reuters found.\n\nJ&J has repeatedly said that its talc products are safe, and that decades of studies have shown them to be asbestos-free and that they do not cause cancer.", "description": "Three major U.S. retailers, including Walmart, are removing all 22-ounce bottles of Johnson & Johnson's baby powder from their stores following the health-care conglomerate's recall last week of some bottles due to possible asbestos contamination.", "authors": ["Thomson Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5334994.1572010128!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/johnson-johnson-results.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
