To capitalize on the changing dynamics of the auto industry, Tesla TSLA recently acquired DeepScale, a California-based computer vision startup, in order to develop fully driverless cars. The startup focuses on \u201cdeep neural networks\u201d that use data and provide information to help a vehicle\u2019s in-car driverless technology \u201csee\u201d what's around it more effectively.\n\nDeepScale\u2019s Artificial Intelligence software for vehicles is named as Craver21. DeepScale engineering will optimize Tesla hardware to allow its vehicles to perform autonomous driving seamlessly. The buyout adds the much-needed talent to Tesla Autopilot team, which has seen the departure of a number of Autopilot executives and engineers in the past year. The financial details of the transaction have been kept under wraps.\n\nTesla\u2019s vehicles are not considered fully autonomous, i.e. Level 4, a designation by the Society of Automobile Engineers which means that the vehicle can operate in certain conditions without human intervention. Instead, vehicles from Tesla are Level 2.\n\nWhile Tesla is making attempts to perfect its self-driving technologies, the company is at the top of its game when it comes to electric vehicles. Although electric cars occupy a small portion of the global automobile market, Tesla has acquired a substantial market share within this niche segment. With Model 3 sedan being its flagship vehicle, Tesla has established itself as a leader in the EV segment. Notably, the company delivered a record 97,000 vehicles globally in the third quarter.\n\nWhile Tesla has been bearing the brunt of increasing R&D and SG&A costs, which have been denting profits; rising Model 3 delivery, which accounts for the bulk of its overall deliveries, is likely to aid its prospects.\n\nTesla, Inc.
