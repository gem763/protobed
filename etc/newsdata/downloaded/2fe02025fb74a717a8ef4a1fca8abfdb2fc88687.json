None of us have met before, but I know that half the room support Chelsea FC and the woman next to me likes to whip her towel around in the air and squeal when she gets excited. I\u2019m staring at my very sweaty reflection, and like my comrades, am singing \u201cI look good, I look good, I look good\u201d. I absolutely do not.\n\nThis is SoulCycle, the cult spinning class that describes itself as a \u201csanctuary\u201d rather than a workout, dubs its instructors \u201crockstars\u201d and claims to benefit the mind, body and soul in just 45 minutes. The American company is perhaps the most famous fitness studio in the world, having made cameo appearances in Hollywood films (notably, I Feel Pretty) and earned itself an unparalleled celebrity following, with Beyonc\u00e9, Victoria Beckham and Tom Cruise among its fans.\n\nA few years ago, there was nothing like it outside of the US. But thanks to the advent of boutique spinning studios such as Psycle and Boom Cycle \u2013 unmistakably inspired by SoulCycle \u2013 similar offerings exist around the UK. But SoulCycle is taking back its crown having opened its first London studio earlier this month. It\u2019s louder, slicker and, it must be said, far more American than any of its counterparts. My earnest Californian instructor even admitted this himself in my first SoulCycle class when he asked us to high five one another mid-way through. \u201cI know you Brits don\u2019t love it,\u201d he confessed, referring to our nation\u2019s signature stiff upper lip, \u201cbut I\u2019ve only just moved here, let\u2019s make friends with our neighbours!\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nI\u2019ve tried countless boutique exercise class in London, but as one of the first companies to convince us that it\u2019s socially acceptable to pay \u00a324 for a workout, SoulCycle has long been my white whale. I was desperate to find out what all the fuss was about: would I find it physically draining? Would I struggle to swallow the stream of happy-clappy aphorisms? Would I find my inner self and emerge reborn as a transcendent -and very toned \u2013 spiritual being? Anything was possible. Here\u2019s what happened when I tried SoulCycle for five days.\n\nDay one\n\nI feel like I\u2019ve just walked into Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s garage. Everything is white, there are inspiring slogans on the walls and everyone looks like they sell kombucha on Instagram. Even the filtered water machines look like something straight out of Kim Kardashian\u2019s private distillery. There\u2019s an expensive smoothie bar in the corner that sells drinks with names like \u201cSoul Life\u201d and \u201cMatcha Love\u201d and the women's changing rooms are packed with preposterously plush toiletries (Le Labo and Drunk Elephant). I smother my face in the free facial oil \u2013 it just felt like the right thing to do \u2013 and I\u2019m ready for my first class.\n\nMy instructor is a blonde-haired muscle man named Mantas who looked like he\u2019s leapt off the front of an Abercrombie & Fitch bag. He begins by taking us through some stretches and asks us to \u201cf***ing inhale\u201d before telling us to \u201cget to know\u201d our bikes as if they\u2019re Tinder dates. Then the lights go out and I suddenly notice there are candles surrounding the central podium Mantas\u2019 bike is on. The music begins \u2013 I think it\u2019s Kanye West but I can\u2019t be sure \u2013 there\u2019s a heavy beat pounding and a spotlight flashes on and off Mantas in time with the music. This feels like a nightclub. But as Mantas tells us to increase the resistance on our bikes and move our legs faster than is humanly possible, it soon becomes apparent that I am, in fact, exercising.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Luckily my bike is near the back, so Mantas doesn\u2019t call me out on this like he does with some of the other front-running riders. It\u2019s not long before he\u2019s asking us to fist-bump our neighbour and \u201cbe vocal\u201d ie make whooping sounds. Many people oblige while I snigger like a schoolgirl.\n\nThere\u2019s a brief weight-lifting segment featuring two 3kg dumbbells, which we use to perform bicep curls and overhead rows among other arm movements. Then a bit more spinning (we're told to spin standing up, return to sit on the bike and stand up again), some bumper sticker aphorisms from Mantas (\u201cwhen you see the finish line, you don\u2019t slow down, you speed up!\u201d) and it\u2019s over. I\u2019m very sweaty and I scuttle out before the end stretches.\n\nDay two\n\nI\u2019ve nearly arrived for my 8.15am class when I receive an email telling me the showers aren\u2019t working this morning at the studio. It\u2019s too late to turn back now, so I accept my fate of spending the day as a smelly person. Despite the message about the showers, the class is full.\n\nI head to my assigned bike and am shocked to find that it\u2019s on the front row in the middle. Nowhere to hide. Did I really choose this one?\n\nBefore the class, Mantas introduces himself to me and to the woman next to me, Mackenzie, who is also American and, naturally, a SoulCycle pro. We chat, mostly about spinning and Mantas\u2019 unbridled enthusiasm, until a disgruntled gentleman asks me to please get off his bike.\n\nWe do a lot of press-ups on the bike this morning, which I enjoy because it takes the pressure of my aching legs, sore from yesterday\u2019s class. There\u2019s no spotlight action, but Mantas is no less sprightly with his coaching: \u201cfind your journey, see it, take it\u201d, and the music motivates me through a rather painful weights session in which he asks us to perform the exercises lifting two weights in one hand \u2013 this portion of the class is longer than ones in the likes of Psycle and Boom Cycle.\n\nThe class comes to an end with the usual \u201ccongratulate your neighbour\u201d encouragement and I am relieved to exit and find that the showers are fixed. I celebrate my unexpected cleanliness by buying a protein shake. It costs \u00a37 and tastes like liquid avocado.\n\nDay three\n\nThis is when the chanting takes place. It\u2019s during the weights session and Mantas, who I\u2019m beginning to think lives here, has got us all chanting \u201cI look good\u201d with every shoulder press. I mouth the words because I can\u2019t bring myself to actually say them while looking at the ratty, sweaty mess that is my reflection.\n\nThis is also the class when I discover how many SoulCyclers support Chelsea FC, because Mantas has written \u201cLONDON\u201d on the misty mirror facing us all and asked us to shout out the names of the football teams we support (not before he asks us to clarify the British translation of \u201csoccer\u201d). It seems that only one woman is passionate enough to yelp out her team of choice (this is the same woman who whips her towel around in the air), prompting the rest of us who are too embarrassed/nervous to contradict her to concur when Mantas asks if we all support Chelsea. Given the ratio, I decide that half of these people are probably actual Chelsea fans.\n\nAfter the class, I feel like buying a small bottle of hydrating coconut water. It costs \u00a35. The feeling has gone.\n\nDay four\n\nAh, a new instructor. He\u2019s English but I don\u2019t catch his name \u2013 I hope Mantas is getting some sleep next door. The music is a bit grungier today \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of Papa Roach - there\u2019s minimal inspirational chit chat and I sweat far more. I soon realise this is probably because I\u2019m hungover. We spend almost the entire class riding on a high resistance, which feels incredibly tough on the legs and makes the whole thing feel a bit like mountain biking.\n\nThe tone of the class feels a little less cult-like and a little more British (I don\u2019t speak to anyone around me), and I realise I\u2019m pushing myself harder. The weights segment is shorter today and not as heavy because we stick to 3kg in each hand, all of which I\u2019m grateful for because my shoulders are sore from yesterday. When the class finishes, the woman next to me hops off her bike immediately without so much as a glimmer of eye contact. Normality, at last.\n\nDay five\n\nThis is the hardest class yet. It\u2019s led by a British woman named Lauren Naomi who is as energetic as a puppy in a playground. We move around the bike more than in previous classes, constantly changing our hand positioning and bopping from side to side in time with the music \u2013 ish. I think I\u2019m managing okay until she asks us to do a body roll. Lauren Naomi does this with the elegance of a gazelle and the rhythmic flair of someone in Step-Up. I almost topple over my bike.\n\n\u201cYou are your own worst enemy!\u201d she yelps as we enter the final stretch. \u201cI want you to look inside yourself and tell yourself you can do this! You got this!\u201d People are cheering, whooping, clapping. For a brief second, I forget that I\u2019m in indoor cycling studio and picture myself climbing Mount Everest. I cycle faster, harder and finish sweatier than I\u2019ve ever felt. Maybe there\u2019s something to this motivational chat.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nSoulCycle truly is like nothing I\u2019ve done before. Yes, it has spawned similar concepts, but nothing quite compares to the high-voltage, primal energy that suffuses every class. I might not have emerged a transcendental being after just five days, but once I let go of my hesitations and embraced SoulCycle\u2019s strange, American idiosyncrasies, there was something meditative about the experience. I felt calmer, cooler and more in touch with my body. I can see myself returning, though the \u00a324 price tag is a little steep for me to become a regular.\n\nBut who knows, after a few more inspirational soundbites and group chanting sessions, I might find a way to rationalise the expense. If not for the workout, then at least for the laughs.", "description": "I am in a candlelit basement with 60 people and we are chanting.
