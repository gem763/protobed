The protesters tore up paving stones from the sidewalk and scattered them on the road, commandeered plastic safety barriers and unscrewed metal railings to form makeshift roadblocks.\n\nPolice fired tear gas outside one station while tens of thousands of demonstrators marched down a main road where traffic came to a standstill. They sang along to the protest movement\u2019s anthem and held up placards depicting the Chinese flag as a Nazi swastika.\n\nPolice had beefed up security measures for the unauthorized rally, the latest in the 5-month-old unrest rocking the semi-autonomous Chinese city.\n\nMany of the supporters of the movement wore masks in defiance of a recently introduced ban on face coverings at public gatherings, and volunteers handed more out to the crowd.\n\nOrganizers said they wanted to use their right to protest, as guaranteed by the city\u2019s constitution despite the risk of arrest.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re using peaceful, rational, nonviolent way to voice our demands,\u201d Figo Chan, vice convener of the Civil Human Rights Front, told reporters. \u201cWe\u2019re not afraid of being arrested.

A witness told local broadcaster RTHK that the assailant shouted afterward that Hong Kong is \u201ca part of China\u201d and other pro-Beijing messages.\n\nThe movement sprang out of opposition to a government proposal for a China extradition bill and then ballooned into broader demands for full democracy and an inquiry into alleged police brutality.", "description": "HONG KONG (AP) \u2014 Hong Kong protesters again flooded streets on Sunday, ignoring a police ban on the rally and setting up barricades while demanding the", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/20/087991_aptopix-hong-kong-protests-34521-protesters-attack-man-who-was-stop-vandalizing-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
