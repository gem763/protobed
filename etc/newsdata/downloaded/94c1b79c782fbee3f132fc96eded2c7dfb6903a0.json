Early qualitative research shows that almost all of these non-voters can be turned into voters.\"\n\nHispanic voters nationwide have historically registered at lower rates than those of other demographic groups, leading to lower participation numbers.\n\n\n\nIn Texas, that trend was partially reversed in the 2018 midterms, when Hispanic participation numbers approached presidential election levels; in some heavily Hispanic counties, participation rose nearly 300 percent over the 2014 midterms.\n\n\n\n\u201cMany of us have long been working on turning Texas blue, and I\u2019ve never been more hopeful than I am for 2020, and the Latino community is the tide that will make it happen,\u201d said Rep. Veronica Escobar Veronica EscobarLawmakers from both sides of the aisle mourn Cummings Lawmakers, social media users praise photo of Pelosi confronting Trump Hispanic voters push campaigns to address gun violence MORE (D-Texas).\n\n\u201cThe DCCC\u2019s presence on the ground helps bolster the important work of a number of grassroots organizations and leaders who have long been engaging with the Latino community,\" added Escobar, referring to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.\n\nAccording to Latino Decisions, there are 403,000 Hispanic voters who are able to vote but are not registered in the eight target districts, and 283,000 registered voters who did not vote in 2018.\n\nThe DCCC joined in September with the Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC) campaign arm, Bold PAC, and the top Democratic leadership super PAC, House Majority PAC (HMP), to commission the study.\n\nThe effort marks a new approach to Texas Latinos by Democrats, spurred by unexpected success in the 2018 cycle and fewer pickup opportunities elsewhere after those midterms.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf you want to understand what really matters to folks whose support you want to earn, first you have to listen. That\u2019s why the DCCC is joining together with partner organizations and making early strategic investments that will help us better engage Latino communities across the country to inspire them to get involved and vote next year,\u201d said DCCC Chairwoman Rep. Cheri Bustos Cheryl (Cheri) Lea BustosImpeachment inquiry might be public by mid-November: report DCCC leader advises Democrats to keep messaging on impeachment 'simple' House Democratic campaign arm raises .4 million in third quarter MORE (D-Ill.).\n\n\n\nWhile Democratic pickups in the state in 2018 were reliant on record Hispanic participation and a backlash to anti-immigrant rhetoric, lower-profile candidates hurt participation in some competitive districts, according to the memo.\n\n\n\n\"Congressional candidate quality matters. For these voters who are not politically engaged, if voters don\u2019t like either candidate or don\u2019t know enough about either candidate, their default response is to simply continue to not vote,\" reads the memo.\n\n\n\nAnd Latino Decisions found Hispanic voters are responsive to \"kitchen table\" issues \u2014 particularly healthcare \u2014 but are also receptive to messages on President Trump Donald John TrumpNumber of uninsured children rises for second year, tops 4 million Trump moment from White House Halloween trick-or-treat event goes viral White House official says transcript of Ukraine call omitted key phrases: report MORE's rhetoric, immigration policy and anti-immigrant violence like the August El Paso shooting, where a gunman killed 22 people and injured 24 others.\n\n\n\n\u201cAll roads to keeping our majority in the House and winning back the White House will run through the Latino community. We must give Latinos a reason to vote for us. We can only do that by communicating early and often,\" said Rep. Sylvia Garc\u00eda (D-Texas), who along with Escobar is one of the first two Latinas to represent Texas in the House.\n\n\n\nTexas Latinos have remained elusive for Democrats in general elections for a variety of reasons, not least of which has been low spending by a party structure that saw better pickup opportunities elsewhere.\n\n\n\nAccording to the memo, many non-participating Latinos also felt \"races in Texas would continue to be noncompetitive, but learning how close these districts were in 2018 made them visibly\n\nsit up and take notice.\"\n\n\n\nLocal Democrats and grassroots activists have long clamored for long-term party commitments to Texas Latino voters, arguing the potential gains outweigh the costs.\n\n\n\nOne sticking point has been the expense of relatively long-term investments to take a voter from not registered to fully participating, in contrast to other regions and demographics where a larger proportion of voters register organically.\n\n\n\n\u201cBold PAC was proud to join the DCCC and House Majority PAC to conduct important research to engage the Latino community over a year before the 2020 election,\u201d said Bold PAC Chairman Rep. Tony C\u00e1rdenas (D-Calif.). \u201cThe early research we conducted together will set us on a clear path to winning the trust and support of the growing Latino community.\"", "description": "House Democrats aiming to flip six House seats in Texas in 2020 have commissioner a study meant to help the party increase the Latino vote.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/escobarveronica_062519gn_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
