He departed for Beijing on Sunday.\n\nNepal's Foreign Minister Pradeep Gyawali described Xi's visit as one of \"historic significance\" for Nepal.\n\n\"Our priority is to create opportunities for Nepal, joining it to China's development. We are focusing on connectivity between the two countries,\" he said.\n\nIn a signed article published in Nepali newspapers on Friday, Xi said he would use the two-day visit to \"renew friendship and explore cooperation with my Nepali friends\".\n\n\"It is important that we adopt a strategic and long-term perspective and draw up a blueprint for our bilateral relationship to take it to a new height in this new era,\" Xi added.\n\nPresident Rt.
