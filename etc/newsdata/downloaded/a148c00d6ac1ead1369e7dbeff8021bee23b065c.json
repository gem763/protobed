Subscribe to the newsletter here .\n\nYesterday we published transcripts from open question-and-answer sessions that Mark Zuckerberg held with his employees in July, along with selected audio excerpts from his answers. I tried to present the highlights of Zuckerberg in as neutral a fashion as possible \u2014 I had found them quite newsworthy, if not quite \u201cexplosive\u201d in the way that people sometimes assume any leaked audio must be.\n\nBut as you may have seen from the resulting coverage, within about 10 seconds of the story hitting Twitter, the story became \u201cFacebook CEO slams Elizabeth Warren.\u201d The truth was somewhat less dramatic \u2014 a presidential candidate had proposed her intention to break up a large business, and the business CEO promised to fight back against that proposal \u2014 but Zuckerberg\u2019s slightly-more-candid-than-usual framing set the stage for a good old-fashioned Twitter brawl.\n\nThe brawl kicked off when Warren herself fired off a series of tweets in which she welcomed the fight. (Welcoming the fight is 50 percent of Warren\u2019s brand \u2014 the other half is having a plan \u2014 and so anything a big tech company said in her general direction was always going to have a whiff of red meat about it.)\n\nWe have to fix a corrupt system that lets giant companies like Facebook engage in illegal anticompetitive practices, stomp on consumer privacy rights, and repeatedly fumble their responsibility to protect our democracy. #BreakUpBigTech https://t.co/c0qWuRb9NN \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 1, 2019\n\n\u201cImagine Facebook and Instagram trying to outdo each other to protect your privacy and keep misinformation out of your feed, instead of working together to sell your data, inundate you with misinformation, and undermine our election security,\u201d Warren tweeted. \u201cThat\u2019s why we need to #BreakUpBigTech.\u201d (Obligatory reminder that Facebook does not sell your data but rather rents your attention to advertisers based on the demographic and location data that you volunteer!)\n\nFacebook had declined to comment this week when I told them about the audio leak, but Warren\u2019s arrival on the scene had given Zuckerberg\u2019s remarks a slight tinge of scandal, prompting the company to act. And so Zuckerberg surprised me by sharing a link to the transcript on his own Facebook page, (How much extra traffic does The Verge see from someone sharing a link on Facebook to 117 million followers? Way less than you\u2019d think!)\n\nEvery week I do a Q&A at Facebook where employees get to ask me anything and I share openly what I'm thinking on all... Posted by Mark Zuckerberg on Tuesday, October 1, 2019\n\n\u201cEven though it was meant to be internal rather than public,\u201d Zuckerberg wrote, \u201cnow that it\u2019s out there, you can check it out if you\u2019re interested in seeing an unfiltered version of what I\u2019m thinking and telling employees on a bunch of topics like social responsibility, breaking up tech companies, Libra, neural computing interfaces, and doing the right thing over the long term.\u201d\n\nI found this to be a brilliant bit of narrative jiu-jitsu on the part of Facebook\u2019s communications and policy apparatus. In one fell swoop, the company removed any sense of impropriety from the remarks \u2014 while also inspiring a legion of conspiracy theorists to descend on my mentions demanding to know whether this all had been a deliberate leak from Facebook. It was not, for the record, and I continue to find hilarious the idea that Facebook \u2014 a company that refused to let CNET take so much of a picture of Zuckerberg last week as part of a glossy, access-driven preview of Oculus Connect \u2014 would secretly funnel me samizdat audio of the company\u2019s previously undisclosed efforts to neuter TikTok.\n\nBut that didn\u2019t stop folks from linking the publication of the transcript to the release of Bernie Sanders\u2019 latest fundraising report, Instagram chief Adam Mosseri\u2019s appearance on the Today show, the ninth anniversary of the release of the Social Network, the return of Pluto under a Sagittarius moon, and so on. Imagine these theories printed out on yellowing newsprint, taped to a wall and connected by sagging lengths of yarn, and you\u2019ll have some idea of what my Twitter mentions have been like over the past day.\n\nMy favorite approach for writers who decided to cover the transcript was to declare that there was absolutely nothing interesting about Zuckerberg\u2019s remarks at all, and then to wax on for a few thousand words about what they found interesting about it. (See Will Oremus and my forever newsletter crush, Ben Thompson.)\n\nFor the record, I continue to find the transcript interesting, less for what Zuckerberg says than for the insights into what his employees are afraid of. I said it in the initial piece, and I\u2019ll say it again: Facebook\u2019s employees are smart, they are self-aware, and they are asking vital questions about how the company will approach regulation, a potential breakup, competition, criticism and more. Taken together, their questions \u2014 along with Zuckerberg\u2019s hyper-rational responses \u2014 offer a memorable time capsule of Facebook at a fraught moment.\n\nI\u2019m glad I was able to share it with you all, and I\u2019ll continue to publish new highlights from the transcripts here over the next several days.\n\nIn fact, let\u2019s publish one right now.\n\nAll Hands On Deck: Hate speech\n\nHere\u2019s a question from the July Q&As that I found notable for two reasons. One, it gets at internal tensions around Facebook\u2019s hate speech policies. Two, Zuckerberg\u2019s answer \u2014 which is basically that too much content is hosted on Facebook for the company to apply any level of nuance to individual comments \u2014 speaks to how the challenge of content moderation has overwhelmed the company despite a massive investment in contracted moderators.\n\nQuestion: According to your policies \u201cmen are trash\u201d is considered tier-one hate speech. So what that means is that our classifiers are able to automatically delete most of the posts or comments that have this phrase in it. [Why?]\n\nMark Zuckerberg: The hate speech policies are the most fraught. So I\u2019ll walk you through the reasoning of how we got to this policy. And so there are a few things that are going on that I think you want to think about. So one is, gender is a protected category. So substitute in your mind while you\u2019re thinking through this, what if this were \u201cMuslims are trash,\u201d right? You would not want that on the service.\n\nSo as a generalization, that kind of framework and protocol that you\u2019ve handed to 30,000 people around the world who are doing the enforcements, the protocols need to be very specific in order to get any kind of consistent enforcement. So then you get to this question on the flip side, which is, \u201cAlright, well maybe you want to have a different policy for groups that have been historically disadvantaged or oppressed.\u201d Maybe you want to be able to say okay, well maybe people shouldn\u2019t say \u201cwomen are trash,\u201d but maybe \u201cmen are trash\u201d is okay.\n\nWe\u2019ve made the policy decision that we don\u2019t think that we should be in the business of assessing which group has been disadvantaged or oppressed, if for no other reason than that it can vary very differently from country to country. So we\u2019re talking about nuances in the US, but there are different ethnic groups or different religions that are in the majority or the minority in different countries, and just being able to track all that and make assessments with any kind of precision, and then deal to hand those rules to, again, 30,000 people who need to make consistent judgments, is just not going to happen. Or, we don\u2019t have the technology yet to do that.\n\nSo what we\u2019ve basically made the decision on is, we\u2019re going to look at these protected categories, whether it\u2019s things around gender or race or religion, and we\u2019re going to say that that we\u2019re going to enforce against them equally. And now that leads to the discussion that we had in the last question, which is that, is this perfect? No. It\u2019s really challenging to get to something \u2014 I mean, you\u2019re not gonna get any answer that everyone is going to agree with.\n\nSome of these things people think we take down too much, some things people think we take down too little. But we\u2019re trying to navigate this in a way where we have a principled approach for having a global framework that is actually enforceable around the world, because to some degree whenever you read about big mistakes that come up in our content enforcement, most of them are actually not because people disagree with the policy.\n\nThe question you\u2019re raising, this might be a case where you disagree with the policy, but most of the issues are because one of the 30,000 people who\u2019s made a call didn\u2019t apply the rules consistently. And then that kind of gets put on our motives, and people say \u201coh well no, you just did this because you\u2019re trying to censor some group of people\u201d or \u201cyou just did this because you don\u2019t care about protecting this group of people.\u201d It\u2019s really not that. We try very hard to get this right, as I think you probably all had exposure to here. It\u2019s just that there\u2019s one thing to try to have policies that are principled. It\u2019s another to execute this consistently with a low error rate, when you have 100 hundred billion pieces of content through our systems every day, and tens of thousands of people around the world executing this in more than 150 different languages, and a lot of different countries that have different traditions. So this is challenging stuff, but that\u2019s how we got to where we are.\n\nThe Ratio\n\nToday in news that could affect public perception of the tech platforms.\n\nTrending up: Mark Zuckerberg and Sen. Elizabeth Warren both did themselves favors in yesterday\u2019s brawl over the leaked transcript, I\u2019d say. Zuckerberg came across as calm, in control, and ready for battle; Warren got to make another entrenched interest look scared of her. Sometimes everybody wins.\n\nTrending down: Amazon workers in Sacramento protested the company\u2019s strict time-off rules, the latest instance of labor unrest at the company.\n\nGoverning\n\n\u2b50 The House of Representatives opened yet another probe into Amazon, Google and Facebook \u2014 this time about how the companies might be hurting small businesses. Here\u2019s what Rep. Nydia Velazquez, who leads the small business subcommittee, plans to focus on, according to Joe Light at Bloomberg:\n\nIn the hearing, Velazquez plans to home in on issues small businesses face when trying to compete with or promote themselves on the companies\u2019 platforms. That\u2019s a central issue in congressional and federal investigations of Amazon, whose online market is used by thousands of third-party sellers to reach customers. The inquiry could give ammunition to critics who complain that big internet platforms are abusing their dominance to harm competition.\n\nThe companies already face investigations from the House Antitrust Subcommittee, the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department.\n\nThe planned hearing is one more layer of scrutiny on top of a growing pile of hearings, pressure campaigns and formal investigations the companies face. The FTC and the Justice Department have already started potentially overlapping inquiries into whether large technology firms have violated antitrust law. The House Antitrust Subcommittee, led by Rhode Island Democrat David Cicilline, has held hearings and submitted intensive document requests to tech companies about potentially anti-competitive practices.\n\nComcast weighed in on the antitrust battle against Google, accusing the tech giant of using privacy concerns as a pretext to limit their ad division\u2019s ability to sell ads on behalf of clients\u2019 YouTube channels. (Paresh Dave and Sheila Dang / Reuters)\n\nSenator Mark Warner (D-VA) went on Recode Decode to discuss tech regulation. He said there is bipartisan agreement in Congress around the need for new digital privacy laws, and proposed three additional solutions, including forcing people to use their real names to post content.

(Jonathan Browning and Ellen Milligan / Bloomberg)\n\nIndustry\n\n\u2b50 Visa and Mastercard are reconsidering their involvement in Facebook\u2019s Libra network, following backlash from US and EU regulators. The financial institutions had originally signed on to help build and maintain the network, but when Facebook asked them to make their support public, they declined. Here\u2019s AnnaMaria Andriotis and Peter Rudegeair from The Wall Street Journal:\n\nMajor defections could imperil Libra, Facebook\u2019s attempt to persuade consumers to swap their national currencies for a digital coin that could be used to pay for goods and services on the internet. Without a network of financial partners that could help transfer currencies into Libra and global retailers to accept it as a form of payment, Libra\u2019s reach would be limited.\n\nLater, they went on:\n\nDavid Marcus, the Facebook executive in charge of the project, endured two days of tongue-lashings from members of Congress over the summer for the lack of details about how the new cryptocurrency would work as well as the company\u2019s past missteps on data privacy. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell told legislators he had \u201cserious concerns\u201d about Libra and the company\u2019s timetable of launching it next year.\n\nDavid Marcus responded to the story on Twitter by saying that \u201ccommitment to the mission is more important than anything else.\u201d Anything else! You hear that, Visa and Mastercard?!\n\nKara Swisher, for one, thought the Zuckerberg transcript was interesting.\n\nMark Zuckerberg might not understand what TikTok is really about \u2014 and he\u2019s underestimating the threat it poses as a result, this piece argues. While Instagram and Facebook are premised on originality and authenticity, TikTok is a place for entertainment and remixing pop culture.
