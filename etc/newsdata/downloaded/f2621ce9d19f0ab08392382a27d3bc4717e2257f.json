It has helped to save thousands of lives over recent years,\u201d the emailed statement said.\n\n\u201cThe truth is that strongly encrypted platforms are often used by pedophile rings, drug kingpins and terrorists to shield their criminal activity. Without sophisticated technologies, the law enforcement agencies meant to keep us all safe face insurmountable hurdles. NSO\u2019s technologies provide proportionate, lawful solutions to this issue.\u201d\n\nBut in a new blog post Tuesday, Citizen Lab singled out NSO Group for its questionable track record.\n\n\u201cAmong the many companies Citizen Lab has tracked, NSO group stands out in terms of the reckless abuse of its spyware by government clients,\u201d Citizen Lab said.\n\n\u201cAlthough the technology is marketed as a tool to assist governments in lawful investigations into crime and terrorism, Citizen Lab has identified dozens of cases where journalists, human rights activists and defenders, lawyers, international investigators, political opposition groups, and other members of civil society have been targeted with its spyware, called \u2018Pegasus.\u2019\u201d\n\nAccording to Citizen Lab, Pegasus is NSO Group\u2019s flagship software, and it allows attackers to obtain passwords, contact lists, calendar events, text messages and live phone calls once a device is infected. The attackers using Pegasus can even remotely turn on the phone\u2019s camera and microphone, and track movements using GPS.\n\nIn an op-ed in the Washington Post published concurrently with the lawsuit, WhatsApp head Will Cathcart said that this kind of surveillance must stop.\n\n\u201cThere was another disturbing pattern to the attack, as our lawsuit explains. It targeted at least 100 human-rights defenders, journalists and other members of civil society across the world,\u201d Cathcart wrote.\n\n\u201cThis should serve as a wake-up call for technology companies, governments and all Internet users. Tools that enable surveillance into our private lives are being abused, and the proliferation of this technology into the hands of irresponsible companies and governments puts us all at risk.\u201d\n\nFinancial Post\n\n\u2022 Email: jmcleod@nationalpost.com | Twitter: jamespmcleod", "description": "As many as 1,400 people were affected, including 'attorneys, journalists, human rights activists, political dissidents, diplomats' and others", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/whatsapp.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
