Earlier this week, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer had dishonestly dismissed O\u2019Rourke\u2019s calls for massive firearms confiscation by claiming he knew of no other Democrat who agreed with the idea. Last night, Beto fired back at Schumer by denigrating his leadership and suggesting that Schumer lacks the testicular fortitude to fight:\n\nMinority Leader Chuck Schumer: \"I don\u2019t know of any other Democrat who agrees with @BetoORourke.\"#NEW O'Rourke fires back tonight: \"Ask @SenSchumer what he\u2019s been able to get done. We still don\u2019t have background checks. Didn\u2019t have them when he was in the majority either.\" pic.twitter.com/2cGPtB8o5x \u2014 Jeffrey Cook (@JeffreyCook) September 20, 2019\n\nBeto O\u2019Rourke lit into Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer on gun control on Thursday, accusing him of doing \u201cabsolutely nothing\u201d on the issue. \u201cAsk Chuck Schumer what he\u2019s been able to get done,\u201d the Democratic presidential candidate told reporters after a town hall here, responding to Schumer\u2019s recent dismissal of O\u2019Rourke\u2019s call for a mandatory buyback of assault weapons. \u201cWe still don\u2019t have background checks. Didn\u2019t have them when he was in the majority, either. So the game that he\u2019s played, the politics that he\u2019s pursued have given us absolutely nothing and have produced a situation where we lose nearly 40,000 of our fellow Americans every year.\u201d \u2026 Of Schumer and mandatory buybacks, O\u2019Rourke said, \u201cWhat he may not know, but what I hear loud and clear\u2014 because I\u2019m traveling the country listening to my fellow Americans \u2014 is that the people are there.\u201d\n\nIf Schumer fibbed a bit in his response, Beto managed to double up on Schumer at least. First off, we do have background checks and have had them for decades. Try buying a firearm at a licensed gun dealer without one and see how far you get. (One journalist tried at a Walmart, and hilarity ensued.) What we don\u2019t have is background checks on private-to-private sales and transfers, which is a very small portion of all legal firearms transactions. Congress and the White House are looking to close that gap, but very few if any of the mass shootings that prompted this conversation would have been prevented by it. At least a few of the shooters would have been prevented from buying firearms had they been prosecuted properly for earlier offenses, however, because those would have showed up on their background checks.\n\nFurthermore, the 40K figure is all deaths from firearms including suicides, not the number of deaths each year from the weapons Beto wants confiscated \u2014 so-called \u201cassault weapons.\u201d As noted ad nauseam, long-barrel firearms (of which \u201cassault weapons\u201d is a subset) represent a minute percentage of overall firearms homicides \u2014 fewer than 4% in 2017. The actual number in 2017 was 403 homicides by rifles of all kinds, roughly 1% of the figure Beto\u2019s tossing around. (Needless to say, assault weapons get used in few if any suicides, either.)\n\nStill, it is in this reflexive state of ignorance and dishonesty that the Democrats will conduct their internecine war on gun-control purity. If Chuck Schumer is the main apostate obstacle to True Progressive Utopia, God help the rest of us who rely on reality and liberty. Praise the Lord and pass the \u2026 popcorn.", "description": "\"Ask Chuck Schumer what he's been able to get done.\"", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/beto-schumer.png", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
