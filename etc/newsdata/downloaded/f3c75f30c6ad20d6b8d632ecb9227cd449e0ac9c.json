The firm\u2019s chief US equity strategist, David Kostin, writes: \u201cWith the 10-year Treasury yield at just 1.5% and the Fed likely to cut two more times this year, investors should look for opportunities in dividend stocks.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, in a recent interview with CNBC, Mark Tepper, president and CEO of Strategic Wealth Partners, commented: \u201cAs an investor, it\u2019s important to understand that the 30-year yield is pretty much in line with the dividend yield on the S&P 500 right now. So, which would you rather own over the next 10 years?... You\u2019re getting the same yield with a growth component if you invest in stocks.\u201d\n\nFor investors looking to pick up some top dividend names, Goldman Sachs screened for stocks with both strong dividend growth and high dividend yields, based on dividend estimates and payout ratios. We used TipRanks to pinpoint three of the most promising stocks on Goldman Sachs\u2019 dividend growth list. As you will see all three of the stocks covered below have a buy consensus from the Street, based on the last three months of ratings:\n\nTelecom giant AT&T is one of the highest yielding dividend stocks singled out by Goldman Sachs. Currently investors receive a lucrative 5.63% yield, which translates to an annualized payout of $2.04 (paid quarterly). For comparison\u2019s sake, the average tech stock manages a dividend yield of just 0.96%. And you can add to the picture extremely compelling dividend growth of 34 consecutive years. That makes T one of the elite Dividend Aristocrats, S&P 500 companies with over 25 years of straight dividend growth.\n\nSuch a strong dividend outlook also provides foundation for the company\u2019s share price, which has been on a roll recently. Year-to-date, T has now surged 27% to $36.25. That\u2019s reflected in the fact that the stock\u2019s average analyst price target now falls below the current share price. However, T maintains its Strong Buy analyst consensus. Plus five-star Cowen & Co analyst Colby Synesael has just reiterated his T buy rating with a price target of $40 (10% upside potential).\n\nAccording to the analyst, shares can continue to grind higher over the coming months. He points out that T is still executing against its 2019 guidance, while potential asset sales (i.e. from the Latin American and tower portfolios) could reduce risk and help pay down debt.\n\nMeanwhile Tigress Financial\u2019s Ivan Feinseth has a Strong Buy rating on T, explaining: \u201cWe reiterate our Buy rating on AT&T as positive Business Performance trends continue to accelerate driven by the ramp-up of its high-speed 5G network, and the continued leverage of its WarnerMedia acquisition\u2026 We believe significant upside exists from current levels and continue to recommend purchase.\u201d Overall, six out of eight analysts covering the stock rate AT&T a buy right now.", "description": "According to Goldman Sachs, the time is now ripe for dividend investing.
