According to research,58% of Americans prefer saving to spending \u2014 but that doesn't mean that they're actually doing it. If you're not saving enough, it can be difficult to know exactly where to start. And even once you've started, it can take be a long road to get there. But the peace of mind and improved quality of life that come with finding stable financial footing are more than worth it.\n\nHere are some tips for moving beyond living paycheck to paycheck:\n\n1. Know your numbers.\n\nBefore you can start fixing your finances, you first need to take a deep breath and a good, long look at your spending.\n\nAccording to the financial coach Megan Robinson, the stress of living paycheck to paycheck often causes people to avoid a deep investigation of their bank accounts, making it impossible for them to track their money or create a savings plan.\n\n\"There's an adage that says, 'You can't manage what you don't measure,' and that's true when it comes to money,\" Robinson, who authors the personal-finance blog Goodbye to Broke, says. \"How much do you make each month? What are you spending? Where is your money going? You'll likely be stuck living paycheck to paycheck until you can answer these questions.\"\n\n2. Visualize your success.\n\nIt's hard to build new habits without the right motivation. After all, if saving money were easy, everyone would do it.\n\nRobinson recommends taking some time to visualize what your life will look like when you're no longer living paycheck to paycheck. With a clear understanding of what financial stability means for you and your loved ones, you'll be able to remember why you're bringing your lunch to work instead of splurging on takeout.\n\n\"This is the part that most people skip, and it can be detrimental to their long-term goal,\" Robinson says. \"Create a vision that motivates and inspires you to take action. That's where the real change happens.\"\n\n3. Build an emergency fund.\n\nOnce you've gotten a handle on your finances and motivations, you'll want to start building a small emergency fund that can tide you over in the event of an unforeseen expense.\n\nDavid Weliver, the founder of the personal-finance website Money Under 30, suggests starting a \"mini emergency fund\" equal to one paycheck, with the goal of eventually building toward three to six months' worth of expenses.\n\nTo this end, a Discover credit card can actually offer a major boost as you build your nest egg. With Discover, all the cash back you earn is matched at the end of your first year \u2013 automatically. Discover matches every dollar you earn and there is no limit to how much you can earn.\n\n4. Manage debt responsibly.\n\nDebt can derail even the most prudent savers, so it's important to come up with a strategic plan for dealing with it.\n\nWeliver recommends making sure your debt payments never amount to more than 40% of your take-home income, and that includes a mortgage. If you don't have a mortgage, it's best to shoot for 15% or less. If you find that you're paying more than this to lenders each month, it's time to reconfigure your loans to lower your monthly payments.\n\n\"Anything higher than 40% is going to be unsustainable and dangerous, so you'll want to look at options for reducing monthly payments, like refinancing or payment plans,\" Weliver says.\n\nGaining financial security can be a long process, but by taking small steps you can establish more stability and save more.\n\nClick here to learn more about Cash Back Match and Discover.\n\nThis post was created by Insider Studios with Discover.", "description": "It's important to save money for your future, but you shouldn't have to sacrifice enjoying your life.
