The agent reported he was using his rifle to clear broken glass from a window at the house where Valladares was being held when Valladares grabbed the weapon, and the agent fired.\n\nAcevedo declined to say how the agent\u2019s claims were inconsistent with what police found.\n\nAuthorities have not identified the agent and an FBI spokeswoman in Houston on Wednesday again declined to provide his name, only saying that he remains employed by the agency.\n\nAuthorities have said Valladares was kidnapped from his home in Conroe, north of Houston, as part of an attempt to extort money from his brother. The FBI tracked two male suspects to a motel, and those men led agents to a house in Houston where another suspect, a woman, was located with Valladares.\n\nAn FBI SWAT team began entering the house early on Jan. 25, 2018, with some agents entering through the front of the home and two agents breaking through a back window. The tool one agent used to break the window fell into the unlit home, while the second agent - who shot Valladares - used his assault rifle to continue breaking the glass, Acevedo said shortly after the shooting.\n\nValladares\u2019 wrists were bound as he sat on a couch just below the window. He grabbed the barrel of the agent\u2019s rifle. The agent, fearing the weapon could be used against other agents entering the home, fired twice, according to the agent\u2019s statement to investigators. Valladares was shot and died at a hospital.\n\nFour people were charged in the case, with one of them, Nicholas Chase Cunningham, sentenced last week to life in prison for aggravated robbery.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Federal authorities will not charge an FBI agent who fatally shot a hostage during a rescue attempt in Houston last year, a U.S. attorney's spokesman said Wednesday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/04/raid_man_killed_48898_c0-107-3380-2077_s1770x1032.jpg?9bdf34d200f00d2e479630d35b626f5da67c14ba"}
