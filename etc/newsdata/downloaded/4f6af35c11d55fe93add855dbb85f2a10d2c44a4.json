Let\u2019s go to the tape.", "language": "en", "published_at": "2019-01-10", "text": "Back in April 2015 \u2014 an era so distant in American history that it barely shimmers in and out of view, cloaked in the haze of everything that\u2019s happened since \u2014 Donald John Trump promised the United States that he would build a wall on the border with Mexico and that Mexico would cover the cost.\n\nIt was at an event in New Hampshire covered by Paul Steinhauser of NH1 News, targeting the state which, as it turns out, would provide Trump with his first victory in electoral politics. But at the time \u2014 despite Steinhauser\u2019s accurate assessment that it wasn\u2019t \u2014 it seemed like a joke. The TV guy was going to build a wall for free, huh? Okay. Good luck.\n\nThe point, though, is that Trump's insistence that Mexico would pay for the wall is, in fact, older than his campaign itself. At that New Hampshire event, he even said how it would happen, in broad strokes.\n\n\"I will take it from out of just a small fraction of the money they\u2019ve been screwing us for over the last number of years,\u201d he claimed.\n\nThat is salient in the moment because of the ongoing government shutdown that stems from Trump\u2019s insistence that the American \u2014 not the Mexican \u2014 government would pick up the tab. He went further in comments to reporters on Thursday, claiming that his frequent assertions that Mexico would pay for the wall were always meant to suggest an indirect payment, just like the assertion above.\n\nBREAKING NEWS\n\nTrump: During the campaign, I would say Mexico would pay for it, I NEVER SAID THIS and never meant they would write out a check. pic.twitter.com/wYCUhAzshp \u2014 Scott McGrew (@ScottMcGrew) January 10, 2019\n\n\"When during the campaign I would say, 'Mexico's going to pay for it,' obviously I never said this and I never meant they're going to write out a check,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI said they're going to pay for it. They are. They are paying for it with the incredible deal we made, called the United States, Mexico and Canada \u2014 USMCA \u2014 deal.\"\n\nTrump went on to note (unusually for the subject) that the trade deal hadn\u2019t yet been approved by Congress and, therefore, wasn\u2019t yet paying anything for anything. He did not, however, also point out that there is no actual mechanism within that deal that would accomplish the payment he insists will follow.\n\n\u201cWhen I said \u2018Mexico will pay for the wall\u2019 in front of thousands and thousands of people, obviously they\u2019re not going to write a check,\u201d he reiterated. \u201cBut they are paying for the wall indirectly, many, many times over, by the really great trade deal we just made.\u201d\n\nThe only problem? He did, at times, claim that Mexico would carry out the equivalent of signing over a check.\n\nIt\u2019s understandable that Trump might have forgotten that. After all, the mechanism he claimed would be used to force Mexico to pay up evolved so often during and after the campaign that it\u2019s a bit hard to keep track. Here is our best effort at compiling those claims, including at least one occasion when the implication was specifically that he\u2019d cajole Mexico into simply handing over the requisite money. (Much of this comes from the eternally useful database at Factba.se.)\n\nUpdate: Our JM Rieger dug up another example from April 2016 -- in which Trump says explicitly that they may pay with a check.\n\nApril 2015. Method: Trade deficit/deals.\n\nAs above: \u201cI will take it from out of just a small fraction of the money they\u2019ve been screwing us for over the last number of years.\u201d\n\nIt's worth noting that the trade deficit is not a function of an imbalance between governments but, instead, of the discrepancy between the value of goods and services purchased from or sold to either country. A reduction in the trade deficit does not generate money that the government can use to pay for a construction project.\n\nJune 16, 2015. Method: Unclear.\n\n\u201cI will have Mexico pay for that wall,\u201d he said at his campaign launch.\n\nSept. 15, 2015. Method: Dealmaking.\n\n\u201cMexico\u2019s going to pay for the wall, believe me,\u201d he said during a speech in Los Angeles. \u201cYou know, a lot of politicians have said, 'Oh, they\u2019re, not going to pay, he must be \u2014\u201d They don\u2019t know anything about \u2014 they never read \u2018The Art of the Deal.\u2019 \"\n\nOct. 28, 2015. Method: Trade deficit/deals.\n\nDuring a debate, Trump was asked about the claim.\n\n\u201cPeople say, \u2018Oh, how will you get Mexico to pay?\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cA politician \u2014 other than the people on this stage, I don\u2019t want to \u2014 a politician cannot get them to pay. I can. We lose, we have a trade imbalance of $50 billion a year. Believe me, the wall is peanuts by comparison.\u201d\n\nNov. 30, 2015. Method: The same way he got CNBC to shorten its debate.\n\n\u201cCNBC extended their debate by one hour, two days before. \u2026 And who\u2019s the one that said, \u2018No way, you\u2019re not going to do it.\u2019 I did. I could stand up there forever, but I said, \u2018You\u2019re not going to do it,\u2019 \u201d he said at a rally. \u201cAnd everybody told me, everybody \u2014 \u2018This is like the wall.\u2019 Everyone says, \u2018Oh, you\u2019ll never get Mexico to pay for the wall.\u2019 \u201d\n\nJan. 6, 2016. Method: Being a business guy.\n\n\u201cMexico is going to pay for the wall,\u201d Trump said in an interview with MSNBC. \u201cThey don\u2019t understand it. They say to me, some of the politicians, \u2018How are you going to get them to pay for the wall?\u2019 They don\u2019t get it, because I\u2019m a business guy, that is what I do.\u201d\n\nJan. 12, 2016. Method: Trade deficit/deals.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve even asked me, \u2018Donald, how can you possibly suggest that they pay \u2014\u2019 and you know how? Because they make billions of dollars a year ripping us off. Billions,\u201d he said. \u201cLook at the deficit we have with Mexico. And the wall is peanuts by comparison. You\u2019re not talking about that much money, relatively speaking.\u201d\n\nMarch 31, 2016. Method: Mexico would cut a check \u2014 or the U.S. would \u201ccompel\u201d the country to pay.\n\nAfter months of criticism over his claim that Mexico would pay, Trump\u2019s campaign sent The Washington Post a memo explaining exactly how it would work.\n\n\n\n(The Washington Post) (Philip Bump/(The Washington Post))\n\nFirst, the theory went, the government would propose blocking wire transfers from some noncitizens to people in Mexico. When the Mexican government protested, they would be told to pay for the wall in a lump sum, or the proposal would go into effect. The plan then lists a few other proposed mechanisms: the trade deficit, canceling visas for Mexicans or increasing visa fees.\n\nThis latter method, the document suggested, could be a source of revenue itself. As was noted at the time, most of these efforts to siphon money from Mexico would come from Mexican residents, not the government itself.\n\nApril 6, 2016. Method: Same.\n\nThe memo offered to The Post was published on Trump\u2019s campaign website.\n\nApril 13, 2016. Method: Maybe a check.\n\n\u201cYou know, the politicians say, \u2018They\u2019ll never pay...\u2019\u201d Trump said during a live event with Fox News' Sean Hannity. \u201c100 percent,\u201d he assured the cheering audience.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not going to write us a check, but...\u201d Hannity replied.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll pay. They\u2019ll pay. In one form or another,\" Trump said. \"They may even write us a check by the time they see what happens.\u201d\n\nJuly 27, 2016. Method: Unclear.\n\n\"I have these clowns in the back, these pundits,\u201d Trump said at a rally. \u201cAnd they're saying, 'Mexico's never going to pay for the wall.' Mexico \u2014 do you know how much money they make from us each year? And I'm not including with the drugs. I'm leaving that out.\"\n\nOct. 22, 2016. Method: Some form of reimbursement. In a \u201ccontract\u201d with voters, the Trump campaign pledged that a wall would be built \u201cwith the understanding that the country of Mexico will be reimbursing the United States for the full cost of such wall.\u201d\n\nOct. 25, 2016. Method: Outfoxing Mexican politicians.\n\n\u201cWhen people say, \u2018Well, they will never pay for the wall.\u2019 Of course they will, because they are making so much money,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey make it at the border, they make it every way. Because their politicians are sharper and shrewder than our politicians.\u201d\n\nNov. 4, 2016. Method: Trade deficit/deals.\n\n\u201cWe have a trade deficit with Mexico that nobody would believe,\u201d Trump said at one of his last campaign rallies. \u201cIt\u2019s a fraction of what we\u2019re talking about with respect to the cost of the wall, because a lot of politicians ask me the question, \u2018How are you going to get Mexico to pay?\u2019 \u201d\n\nOnce Trump won the presidency, he didn\u2019t talk about having Mexico pay for the wall quite as much.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nBut it did still come up.\n\nJan. 11, 2017. Method: A tax or a payment.\n\nAt his first news conference as president-elect, Trump said that he would push for construction on the wall to start immediately, even if payment from Mexico came later.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel like waiting a year or a year and a half. We\u2019re going to start building,\u201d he said. \u201cMexico in some form, and there are many different forms, will reimburse us, and they will reimburse us for the cost of the wall. That will happen, whether it\u2019s a tax or whether it\u2019s a payment \u2014 probably less likely that it\u2019s a payment. But it will happen.\u201d\n\nDishonest media says Mexico won't be paying for the wall if they pay a little later so the wall can be built more quickly. Media is fake! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 9, 2017\n\nJan. 25, 2017. Method: A complicated reimbursement.\n\n\"Ultimately, it'll come out of what's happening with Mexico,\u201d Trump told ABC's David Muir. \u201cWe're going to be starting those negotiations relatively soon. And we will be in a form reimbursed by Mexico, which I've always said.\"\n\n\"I'm just telling you, there will be a payment,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt will be in a form, perhaps a complicated form.\"\n\nJan. 26, 2017. Method: Revenue from overhauling the tax code.\n\n\"We're working on a tax reform bill that will reduce our trade deficits, increase American exports and will generate revenue from Mexico that will pay for the wall if we decide to go that route,\u201d Trump said during a speech. \u201cIt is time that the American people had a president fighting as hard for its citizens as other countries do for theirs, and that's exactly what I'm going to do for you. Believe me.\"\n\nJan. 27, 2017. Method: Withholding a meeting.\n\nIn a call with Mexico\u2019s president leaked to The Post, Trump threatened to call off an upcoming meeting.\n\n\u201cWe cannot say that anymore because if you are going to say that Mexico is not going to pay for the wall, then I do not want to meet with you guys anymore, because I cannot live with that,\u201d he said.\n\nApril 23, 2017. Method: Somehow.\n\nEventually, but at a later date so we can get started early, Mexico will be paying, in some form, for the badly needed border wall. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 23, 2017\n\nJune 21, 2017. Method: Solar panels to reduce the cost for Mexico.\n\n\"We're talking about the southern border, lots of sun, lots of heat,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe're thinking about building the wall as a solar wall so it creates energy and pays for itself. And this way, Mexico will have to pay much less money.\"\n\nAug. 27, 2017. Method: Reimbursement/other.\n\nWith Mexico being one of the highest crime Nations in the world, we must have THE WALL. Mexico will pay for it through reimbursement/other. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 27, 2017\n\nJan. 11, 2018. Method: One of 10 forms Trump could name.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always said we have to have a wall. I\u2019ve also said Mexico\u2019s got to pay for it \u2014 sometimes you know on occasion, I\u2019d add who\u2019s going to pay for it? Mexico. Well they will pay for it, OK?\u201d Trump told the Wall Street Journal. \u201cThere are many forms of payment. I could name 10 right now. There are many forms of payment, I didn\u2019t say how.\u201d\n\nAsked to name one such method, Trump cited the North American Free Trade Agreement renegotiation that led to USMCA.\n\nMay 29, 2018. Method: In an unspecified enjoyable way.\n\n\u201cThey make all of this money, and they do absolutely nothing to stop people from going through Mexico from Honduras and all these other countries \u2014 the caravan, all of this stuff \u2014 they do nothing to help us. Nothing,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to pay for the wall, and they\u2019re going to enjoy it. Okay?\u201d\n\nBy December, with the shutdown fight looming, Trump isolated the USMCA agreement as the source for that repayment.\n\nJan. 4. Method: USMCA.\n\n\u201cWhat we save on the USMCA \u2014 the new trade deal we have with Mexico and Canada \u2014 what we save on that, just with Mexico, will pay for the wall many times over just in a period of a year, two years and three years,\u201d Trump claimed at a news conference last week. \u201cSo I view that as, absolutely, Mexico is paying for the wall.\u201d\n\nPrecisely as he always said it would.", "description": "(He did.)", "authors": ["Philip Bump", "National Correspondent Focused Largely On The Numbers Behind Politics"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Pepe95EvtwS6fM3KL1fXzOzSl-U=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EZDGK4AU6AI6TK3ZGDGU66JG6I.jpg"}
