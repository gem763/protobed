His failure to form a government after the April ballot led to the new election on Tuesday.\n\nGantz, a former armed forces chief, beamed with confidence as he told a rally of his Blue and White Party that it appeared \u201cwe fulfilled our mission\u201d, and he pledged to work towards formation of a unity government.\n\nNetanyahu, he said, apparently \u201cdid not succeed in his mission\u201d to win a fifth term.\n\n\u201cWe will await the actual results,\u201d Gantz, 60, said.\n\nThe final election results can take more than a week, but partial results are published by the Knesset as the vote-counting proceeds, so a clearer picture will likely emerge within a day before the final tally.\n\nBy 6 a.m. about a quarter of the votes had been counted.\n\nRevised surveys by Israeli TV stations, several hours after polls closed, gave Likud 30 to 33 of parliament\u2019s 120 seats, a slight drop from earlier forecasts, versus 32 to 34 for Blue and White.\n\nRelated Coverage Netanyahu in post-election speech makes no victory claim\n\nNeither had enough support, at first glance, for a governing coalition of 61 legislators, and Netanyahu\u2019s ally-turned-rival, former Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman, emerged as a likely kingmaker as head of the far-right Yisrael Beitenu party.\n\nThe updated polls showed that without Yisrael Beitenu\u2019s projected eight to nine seats, stalemate could ensue: Likud would have the support of only up to 55 legislators, down from 57 in the earlier exit polls, for a right-wing coalition. Blue and White could enlist the backing of no more than 59 for a centre-left government.\n\nNetanyahu, who highlighted his close relationship with U.S. President Donald Trump during the campaign, said in his 3 a.m. speech at Likud election headquarters in Tel Aviv that he intended to establish a \u201cstrong Zionist government\u201d that would reflect the views of \u201cmany of the nation\u2019s people\u201d.\n\nHis description of a future administration appeared to open the way for Jewish parties not part of his current government to join.\n\nIt also seemed to be a swipe at Gantz, and the possibility that Netanyahu\u2019s rival might try for a governing coalition with the tacit support of an Arab party, which many right-wingers see as disloyal to Israel.\n\nThe Joint Arab List made a strong showing in Tuesday\u2019s election and was projected to capture 13 to 15 seats in the legislature, compared with 10 won by various Arab factions in April\u2019s election.\n\nCoalition-building could be complicated: Lieberman has said he would not join an alliance that included ultra-Orthodox parties - Netanyahu\u2019s traditional allies. Lieberman ran on a platform largely focused on weakening the influence that religious parties have on everyday life in Israel.\n\nGantz has ruled out participating in an administration with Netanyahu, if the Israeli leader is indicted on looming corruption charges.\n\nCORRUPTION CHARGES\n\nDubbed \u201cKing Bibi\u201d by his supporters, Netanyahu, 69, had already been stung by the April poll.\n\nBlue and White party leader Benny Gantz speaks at the party's headquarters following the announcement of exit polls during Israel's parliamentary election in Tel Aviv, Israel September 18, 2019. REUTERS/Corinna Kern\n\nThree corruption investigations and the Israeli attorney general\u2019s announced intention to charge him with fraud and bribery have also chipped away at Netanyahu\u2019s seeming invincibility, 10 years into consecutive terms as prime minister marked by a sharp focus on security that resonated with voters.\n\nNetanyahu, who can argue at a pre-trial hearing in October against indictment, has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nAn election loss could leave him more at risk of prosecution in the graft cases, without the shield of parliamentary immunity that his current political allies had promised to seek for him.\n\n\u201cUnless that miraculous turnabout between the exit polls and the actual results happens - the Netanyahu magic has been broken,\u201d Anshel Pfeffer, author of a Netanyahu biography, wrote in the left-wing Haaretz daily.\n\nCampaigns run by Likud and Blue and White pointed to only narrow differences on many important issues: the regional struggle against Iran, the Palestinian conflict, relations with the United States and the economy.\n\nAn end to the Netanyahu era would be unlikely to bring about a significant change in policy on hotly disputed issues in the peace process with the Palestinians that collapsed five years ago.\n\nBefore the last election, Trump gave Netanyahu a lift with U.S. recognition of Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, captured from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war. This time, the White House seems more preoccupied with Iran.\n\nThe Trump administration plans soon to release an Israeli-Palestinian peace plan that may prove a dead letter: The Palestinians have rejected it in advance as biased.\n\nIn what was widely seen as a bid to draw votes away from ultranationalist parties, Netanyahu last week announced his intention to annex the Jordan Valley in the occupied West Bank, where the Palestinians seek statehood.\n\nBut Blue and White, while vowing to pursue peace, has also said it would strengthen Israeli settlement blocs in the West Bank, with the Jordan Valley as Israel\u2019s \u201ceastern security border\u201d.\n\nIn Gaza, Palestinians awaited the results of the vote.\n\nSlideshow (22 Images)\n\n\u201cThis election affects many things in our life,\u201d said Mohamad Abdul Hay Hasaneen, a janitor in the city of Khan Younis. \u201cThere might be limited escalations after the election, but I don\u2019t think this would result in a full war.\u201d\n\n(Graphic: Netanyahu's annexation plans - here)", "description": "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was in a battle for political survival after exit polls following Tuesday's election showed the race too close to call and the Israeli leader's decade-long grip on power slipping.", "authors": ["Jeffrey Heller", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190918&t=2&i=1431071450&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8H06Y", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
