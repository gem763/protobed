(David Banks/Getty Images)\n\nA lot of late-breaking injury news this week; let\u2019s get you up to date.\n\n\u2022 How real is this Chase Edmonds emergence? We\u2019re about to find out. Per Adam Schefter, the Cardinals will be without David Johnson (ankle) for the next two games \u2014 Sunday against New Orleans, then Thursday versus San Francisco. Edmonds has his work cut out, given those opponents, but I\u2019ll be dialing him up wherever I can. Christian Kirk (ankle) is a game-time decision.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n\u2022 Alvin Kamara (ankle) is headed for an extended rest, per Schefter. Kamara won\u2019t play against Arizona, and then the Saints take their bye week. Latavius Murray is an easy punch against Arizona, while Drew Brees (thumb) returns as the starting quarterback. If you want to attack the spotty Arizona seam coverage, TE Josh Hill steps in for Jared Cook (ankle).\n\n\u2022 Keenan Allen (hamstring) is a game-day call at Chicago, and even if he plays, it\u2019s likely his snaps would be limited. Maybe this could lead to a Mike Williams spike game.\n\n\u2022 Matt Ryan (ankle) won\u2019t play against Seattle, his first missed start since 2009. Matt Schaub takes over, which means we lower our expectations for the entire Atlanta offense.\n\n\u2022 All signs point to Davante Adams (toe) not playing at Kansas City. And as expected, Matt Moore will play in place of Patrick Mahomes (knee). If you dare to buy into Sammy Watkins (hamstring), the Chiefs say he will be available.\n\n\u2022 Jon Gruden is cautiously optimistic he\u2019ll have Tyrell Williams (foot) and Josh Jacobs (shoulder) at Houston. The Raiders haven\u2019t played a true home game since Sept. 15.\n\n\u2022 Check on Jack Doyle before you commit; he had a partial practice Friday after working earlier in the week. He\u2019s dealing with a groin injury.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u2022 Dede Westbrook (shoulder/neck) is expected to play against the Jets. He\u2019s been in excellent form of late, even with Gardner Minshew starting to encounter growing pains.\n\n\u2022 Delanie Walker (ankle) needs some time, and won\u2019t play against Tampa Bay. If you\u2019re desperate for a fill-in, you could dial up Jonnu Smith. Another option is on the other sideline; with O.J. Howard (hamstring) unavailable, Cameron Brate is Tampa\u2019s clear tight-end starter.\n\n\u2022 According to Josina Anderson of ESPN, Josh Gordon (knee) could be medically cleared in 1-2 weeks. When he comes back, it won\u2019t be with the Patriots. I\u2019m not optimistic Gordon will be a fantasy factor again in 2019, but you can disagree if you like.\n\n\u2022 The wait for Chris Herndon (hamstring) never seems to end. He will not play at Jacksonville. Low-upside Ryan Griffin is the replacement.\n\n\u2022 It\u2019s difficult to trust the Giants passing game, but New York at least won\u2019t have to deal with Darius Slay (hamstring). Detroit\u2019s cover ace has been ruled out. Giants wideout Sterling Shepard (post-concussion) remains week-to-week.\n\n\u2022 Philadelphia\u2019s struggling offense won\u2019t have DeSean Jackson (abdomen) at Buffalo. Carson Wentz is certainly not an automatic fantasy start.\n\n\u2022 Parris Campbell (abdomen) might be able to play against the Broncos, which dulls the Zach Pascal breakout story somewhat.\n\n\u2022 The Vikings expect to have Adam Thielen (hamstring) for Week 9 against Kansas City. He did not play in Thursday\u2019s win over Washington.\n\n\u2022 If Case Keenum (post-concussion) is healthy, he will remain Washington\u2019s quarterback. No one wants to watch the Dwayne Hawkins experiment right now; he was awful at Minnesota.\n\nFollow the engaging Yahoo fantasy crew on Twitter: Andy Behrens, Dalton Del Don, Brad Evans, Matt Harmon, James Koh, Liz Loza, Scott Pianowski and Tank Williams.", "description": "Chase Edmonds and Latavius Murray get a significant boost with teammates hurt.
