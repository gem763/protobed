This series looks at which upgrades investors should act on. Specifically, we'll find out why analysts are revving their engines for VMware, NXP Semiconductors NV and Philip Morris.\n\nLet's take a closer look:\n\nVMware (VMW)\n\nFirst up, 5-star Wells Fargo analyst Philip Winslow upped his rating on VMware to 'buy' Tuesday. According to Winslow, the company behind everything from cloud to networking and security to digital workspace is worth about 17% more than it's currently selling for, and should hit $180 within the next 12 months. (To watch Winslow's track record, click here)\n\nWinslow wrote, \"Although VMware\u2019s core server virtualization business (vSphere) has performed well recently as existing customers continue to invest in their VMware infrastructure and the traction of newer products (NSX, vSAN, and vRealize) and services has been impressive, many investors have been concerned that the growing interest in deploying cloud-native and containerized applications into Kubernetes-centric environments will eventually reduce the relevancy of and customer demand for VMware\u2019s virtualization-centric product portfolio. Conversely, we believe the acquisitions of Bitnami, Heptio, and Pivotal Software, combined with the release of VMware Tanzu (particularly Project Pacific), will position VMware to emerge as the leader in the market for Kubernetes-based, multi-cloud platform solutions.\"\n\nOverall, the word on the Street rings largely bullish on this cloud computing giant, backing Winslow's confident move, with TipRanks analytics demonstrating VMW as a Buy. Out of 23 analysts polled in the last 3 months, 16 are bullish on VMware stock, 9 remain sidelined, and only one is bearish on the stock. With a return potential of nearly 14%, the stock's consensus target price stands at $175.83.

According to the analyst, this chip stock with the $110 stock price will rise to $130 a share within a year. (To watch Twigg's track record, click here)\n\nTwigg commented, \"We believe demand trends at NXPI have bottomed and channel inventories for the Company have begun to normalize. While we had previously had concerns regarding the impact of the pending QCOM acquisition on the Company\u2019s design pipeline, we believe these concerns are already reflected in the Company\u2019s current valuation (12x P/E 2020) and also believe NXPI\u2019s pending acquisition of MRVL\u2019s connectivity assets will partially offset this. While demand trends in automotive remain weak, we like the Company\u2019s outsized exposure to this segment (50% of revenues) longer term, and see opportunities for the Company to offset weak end demand via content growth associated with design wins within: 1) ADAS; 2) BMS (battery management systems) and the associated electrification of autos; and 3) Infotainment.\"\n\nAll in all, cautious optimism circles this semiconductor player, as TipRanks analytics exhibit NXPI as a Moderate Buy. Out of 12 analysts polled in the last 3 months, 7 are bullish on NXP Semiconductors stock, while 5 remain sidelined. With a return potential of 5.5%, the stock\u2019s consensus target price stands at $115.91.
