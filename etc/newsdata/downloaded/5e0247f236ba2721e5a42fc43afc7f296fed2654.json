It\u2019s wasn\u2019t clear what the issue was, and Google finally acknowledged that there was a problem in September.\n\nIt seems Google\u2019s had a breakthrough, issuing a statement to 9to5Google today saying it\u2019s found a fix for the issue, which was caused by an error in an automatic firmware update. Google says the fix will roll out to working devices soon to (hopefully) prevent them from bricking at any point in the future. The company will also replace affected Google Homes and Home Minis, even if they\u2019re out of warranty.\n\n\u201cWe are aware that a small number of Google Home and Google Home Mini devices are affected by an issue that causes the device to stop working. We have a fix that will prevent the issue from happening and will be rolling it out soon. We are replacing affected devices,\u201d the statement reads.", "description": "If your Google Home or Google Home Mini has recently stopped working, good news: Google will likely replace it.", "authors": ["Jay Peters", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZqnkEGpWLkk8Tz8gCvdJF7P_MjY=/0x56:2040x1124/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7396341/vpavic_161101_1258_0033.0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
