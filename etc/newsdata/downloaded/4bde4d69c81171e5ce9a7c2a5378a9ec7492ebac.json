O*NET includes highly detailed, task-level information on hundreds of occupations. The 545 occupations Brookings studied accounted for 90% of the U.S. workforce.\n\nEach occupation was assigned a digital score between 0 and 100. High digital occupations are those with scores over 60. They include software developers (91), computer system analysts (79) and financial managers (61). Medium digital occupations scored between 33 and 60, and include lawyers (58), automotive service technicians (55), office clerks (55) and registered nurses (55). Low digital occupations have a score below 33, and include security guards (31), restaurant cooks (18), construction laborers (17) and personal care aides (14).\n\nThe report has five main takeaways.\n\n\n\n1. The digitalization of the U.S. economy has been rapid since the early 2000s.\n\nIn 2002, 58% of jobs required low digital skills, 40% required medium digital skills and just 5% required high digital skills. A lot had changed by 2016. The share requiring low digital skills was almost cut in half, to 30%, while medium digital skills requirements rose modestly to 48% and the share of jobs requiring high digital kills more than quadrupled to 23%.\n\n2. The changes haven't been evenly distributed across occupations and industries.\n\nMany highly digital occupations became even more digital, including electronics engineers, aerospace engineers and statistical assistants. A number of previously middle-skill occupations became high-digital. Financial managers, for example, went from 41 to 61; supervisors of administrative workers rose from 39 to 64 and chemical engineers from 47 to 69.\n\nThe biggest advances in digitalization were seen in medium- and low-skill occupations. Many moderately digitalized occupations saw a considerable increase in their digital scores, such as automotive service technicians, registered nurses and human resources specialists.\n\nThe mean low-skill digital score more than doubled, from 14 in 2002 to 36 in 2016. Tool and die makers increased from 3 to 51, bus and truck mechanics from 17 to 48 and audio equipment technicians from 30 to 75.\n\n3. Digitalization is increasing job creation and wages in occupations at the high and low ends while helping to hollow out those in the middle.\n\nThe mean annual wage in 2016 was $72,896 in highly digital occupations, $48,274 in middle-level ones and $30,393 in low-digital occupations. Statistical analysis of the O*NET data shows there is a distinct wage premium for digital skills among occupations requiring the same educational level.\n\nIn addition, as Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist David Autor and others have long pointed out, the increased digitalization of the U.S. economy has contributed to the polarization of employment and wage distributions over the past two decades. Job opportunities have expanded in both high- and low-occupations while contracting in middle-skill white-collar and blue-collar jobs. Automation has been most successful when applied to tasks that follow precise, well-understood procedures that can be well described by a set of rules, and such tasks generally predominate in middle-skill occupations.\n\n4. Digitalization varies widely across geographic areas.\n\nBetween 2002 and 2016, the mean digitalization score across all states rose by 18 to 22 points while showing extensive variations. The District of Columbia had the highest mean digital score at 51. Massachusetts, Maryland, Virginia, and Connecticut all had scores exceeding 47. Hawaii, Wyoming and Louisiana had scores below 43. Nevada had the lowest score at 41.\n\nMetropolitan areas showed even more variations in mean digital scores, ranging from San Jose at 47 to Bakersfield, Calif., at 36. For the foreseeable future, superstar cities offer the best job opportunities for highly educated, highly skilled workers.\n\n\n\n5. Digitalization is changing the skills less-advantaged workers need to secure good jobs.\n\nFinally, the report defined midskill good jobs as those with the potential to help workers gain a well paid middle-class career without a four-year college degree. An analysis of the skill profiles of the 14 million or so American good jobs showed that their mean digital score was 50 in 2016, almost double their 2002 score of 29. \u201cPut another way, where 49 percent of these attainable full-time jobs required medium or high levels of digital competence 15 years ago, 87 percent of them do now.\u201d\n\nIrving Wladawsky-Berger worked at IBM from 1970 to 2007, and has been a strategic adviser to Citigroup, HBO and Mastercard and a visiting professor at Imperial College.
