Strictly contestants quickstep past breakup curse", "language": "en", "text": "Catherine Tyldesley admits her husband is getting ribbed about it, Will Bayley has no such fears because, he says, he\u2019s \u201ctoo ugly\u201d, while James Cracknell is more concerned about his lack of dancing skills.\n\nThe ex-Coronation street actor, Paralympian and retired Olympic rower are among 15 contestants about to submit themselves to not only the 17th season of Strictly Come Dancing, but also its so-called curse: the risk of the end of a relationship as a result of becoming romantically linked with a dance partner.\n\nAfter having the phenomenon explained to him, the Made in Chelsea star Jamie Laing said: \u201cOh no, everyone\u2019s going to become pregnant?\u201d\n\nLaing will avoid any trouble after being forced to pull out this week with an injury, although he will appear on Saturday night because the opening show is pre-recorded.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Emma Tynn and Chris Ramsey. Photograph: Ian West/PA\n\nThe idea of a curse might be funnier if it hadn\u2019t happened so often. Tyldesley admitted it had been a topic of conversation with her husband, Tom Pitfield.\n\n\u201cTom has got a WhatsApp group with all his mates. A lot of them are rugby players so there is a lot of banter going on. They are all like: \u2018Oh mate, you\u2019re screwed.\u2019 But he\u2019s just like: \u2018Whatevs.\u2019 It\u2019s not something \u2026 we\u2019re happily married. It\u2019s [the curse] a bizarre thing isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nIn previous years, Cracknell was reportedly asked by his then wife not to sign up because of curse fears. He said he was not dwelling on it, however, because he suspected he might not be on the programme for long.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m more worried about not being able to dance, that\u2019s the biggest concern for me \u2026 I\u2019ve got no skills in my locker.\u201d\n\nLast year the programme got wall-to-wall curse headlines after the comedian Seann Walsh and his dance partner Katya Jones, both of whom were in relationships, were snapped kissing.\n\nAsked about the risk, this year\u2019s comedian contestant Chris Ramsey turned the question into a promotional opportunity.\n\n\u201cMe and my wife have been married for five years, we\u2019ve got a child, but more importantly, me and my wife have got one of the top podcasts in the UK and if you think I\u2019m jeopardising that for any kind of fling you\u2019ve got another think coming.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Anneka Rice and Karim Zeroual.

This year \u2026 I\u2019ve done lots of new things and I just feel slightly reckless and out of control.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Will Bayley and Alex Scott. Photograph: Ian West/PA\n\nIn contrast, the table tennis champion Bayley said yes to going on Strictly in a heartbeat. \u201cNo one knows who I am so I\u2019m getting it out there.\u201d Is he worried about the curse? \u201cNo, not at all. I\u2019m too ugly!\u201d\n\nThe bookies\u2019 favourite to lift the crown is the former footballer Alex Scott, followed closely by the EastEnders actor Emma Barton.\n\nThe outsiders are the former footballer David James, and an American who is a superstar to many, but completely unknown to most.\n\nMichelle Visage is RuPaul\u2019s judging sidekick on the show Drag Race. She is also making a documentary about the breast implants she had removed six months ago. \u201cI was sick for 20 years and didn\u2019t know it,\u201d she said.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Emma Barton and Dev Griffin. Photograph: Lia Toby/Getty Images\n\n\u201cToxins are leaving my body that have been in for 30 years. It is kind of like a new body, a new beginning and I want to show women that they are not their bodies and they are not victim to what society says they need to be.\u201d\n\nJames, like Rice, had been asked several times to be on the show and always declined, including this year. \u201cThere is a thing about celebrity, as an ex-sportsman, which didn\u2019t sit right and I just assumed that celebrity shows were all similar, blah blah blah.\u201d\n\nIt was a chat with with his friend, the retired swimmer and former contestant Mark Foster, that changed his mind.\n\nAnd now he was in it, James wanted to win. As did everyone, he said. \u201cThe whole group are competitive.\u201d", "description": "Actors, sportspeople and celebrities dismiss risk of falling for dance partners", "authors": ["Mark Brown", "Adrian Chiles"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ec1edd2a1eff309b8c5cea059e870c04c58dee3/0_713_3471_2081/master/3471.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1f62eaf5933415b1cf46b5b0f39fd8ca", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
