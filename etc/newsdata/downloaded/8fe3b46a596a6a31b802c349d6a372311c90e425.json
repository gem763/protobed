Now, he\u2019s challenging the queen to a constitutional duel. The fate of an Australian prime minister 44 years ago suggests that could be a fatal mistake.\n\nThe British prime minister will refuse to leave office if he loses a vote of no confidence in Parliament, Britain\u2019s Sunday Times newspaper reported at the weekend. His office is preparing legal advice that the monarch\u2019s constitutional powers wouldn\u2019t permit her to sack him, the Sun newspaper reported Wednesday.\n\nThat reasoning may be legally flawed, as Charlie Falconer, the former cabinet minister in charge of Britain\u2019s courts has argued. But the high-stakes strategy may still seem to have merit. Britain\u2019s constitutional monarchs have been wary of intervening in politics since the 17th century, when one of Queen Elizabeth\u2019s predecessors was beheaded and another exiled to France for interfering with parliamentary business. By squatting in office, perhaps Johnson could jam the gears of politics until Oct. 31, when the United Kingdom will leave the European Union without a deal unless an extension or withdrawal agreement has been concluded.\n\nAt the same time, the Australian precedent ought to worry him.\n\nIn 1975, that country\u2019s prime minister, Gough Whitlam, also found himself in a deadlock. Following the death of a senator in his Labor Party, he lost the ability to pass appropriation bills through the upper house and fund the government. Rather than follow Whitlam\u2019s preferred solution of a partial Senate election, Governor General John Kerr \u2013 the queen\u2019s official representative in Australia \u2013 dismissed him and appointed the leader of the opposition, Malcolm Fraser, as a caretaker.\n\nThere was a bit more to the decision, though. As a condition of Fraser\u2019s appointment, Kerr required him to first guarantee the passage of the appropriation bills, and then call fresh elections. In other words, Fraser was required to end the immediate crisis so that an election wouldn't take place against the backdrop of a national emergency.\n\nCommonwealth countries tend to look to each other for legal precedents, especially in circumstances where there are few domestic analogies.(1) That makes the manner of Whitlam\u2019s dismissal relevant to the Brexit situation now.\n\nFor one thing, it underlines the fact that the choice of prime minister ultimately belongs to the monarch. In a scenario where Johnson refuses to leave office after losing a vote of no confidence, he might hope that bickering among MPs would prevent parliament selecting a figure to serve as caretaker prime minister.\n\nThe Whitlam example suggests that there\u2019s no need for the Crown to be so quiescent. If a prime minister loses the confidence of Parliament and has no realistic prospect of regaining it ahead of a looming deadline on the scale of Brexit, the queen could suggest whichever caretaker has the best prospect of commanding a majority \u2013 and even require that leader to take whatever limited actions are needed to avert the immediate crisis.\n\nThat sort of process may indeed be the best way to apply the U.K.\u2019s constitutional rules that Johnson hopes will bind the queen\u2019s hands, as Falconer wrote:\n\nOne way to fulfill this would be to appoint a middle-of-the-road figure (such as Speaker of the House of Commons John Bercow) as caretaker, and require that he seek an extension of the Article 50 period for leaving the European Union to January 31 before calling fresh elections.\n\nSuch a move would likely annoy supporters of Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, who think he should have right of first refusal, but that\u2019s a risk worth taking. The odds of the U.K. exiting the EU without a deal(2) are almost certainly higher if parliament gets bogged down on inter-party negotiations about who should lead a caretaker government. By directly choosing a successor to Johnson, that process would be short-circuited, forcing Brexit-leaning Labour MPs to actively back a vote of no confidence to remove the caretaker rather than allow parliamentary inertia to get the blame.", "description": "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Boris Johnson has spent the past week hinting that he\u2019d be prepared to defy an Act of Parliament that would force him to request a third extension to the U.K.\u2019s exit from the European Union.
