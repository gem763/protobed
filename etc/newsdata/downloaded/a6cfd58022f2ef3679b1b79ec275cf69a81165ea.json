They\u2019ve had a pod of over 100 dolphins swim along next to their ship, snorkeled with seahorses and octopi in Bonaire and accidentally crashed a Christmas party in a tiny village in Martinique that they immediately got invited to join.\n\n\u201cIf we get to a place and we like it, we stay. If we don\u2019t, we move on,\u201d Mark explains. And when they don\u2019t feel like doing anything at all, they don\u2019t: The first time we were scheduled to talk, Mark wrote me the morning of to cancel, saying: \u201cThe sun came out here. Can we chat next week?\u201d\n\nMark Erdos Mark and Cindy snorkeling\n\nOf course, it\u2019s not all, as Mark puts it, \u201ccocktails and dreaming.\u201d He says: \u201cThe good days are really, really good. The bad days you\u2019re down on your knees praying you\u2019re going to make it through the storm,\u201d he says. And, he adds: \u201cIt is expensive, I\u2019m not gonna lie.\u201d\n\nWhat does it cost to sail the world on your own boat? The Erdos\u2019 estimate they spend roughly $70,000 per year on their adventures (which includes the $3,700 they spend on catastrophic health insurance that covers them everywhere but the U.S.), though in the first year Mark says it was more like $110,000 as we \u201cdidn\u2019t know what we were doing \u2014 staying in marinas instead of dropping anchor [further out], replacing items instead of fixing them.\u201d He adds that you could do it for about $20,000 a year, \u201cbut you\u2019re not really having fun then\u201d \u2014 adding that he and Cindy rent cars, eat out and live the good life on their $70,000 budget.\n\n\u201cWe worked our butts off, saved and saved and saved for over 20 years, avoided debt and lived well within our means. There is no magic button to push landing in this lifestyle.\u201d Mark Erdos\n\nWondering what it might cost you to do the same? Mark points to this spreadsheet \u2014 he calls it the \u201cHoly Grail of boat budgets\u201d \u2014 made by a friend who tracked all his expenses when he sailed the world.\n\nOne big expense is the boat itself: The couple bought the boat used during the recession for a little over $360,000, Mark says. It was more than they\u2019d wanted to spend, Mark says, but Cindy agreed to work a few years longer so they could get it.\n\nThey still have expenses for it including repairs and upgrades when needed. \u201cOur boat wants for nothing. The boat is a diva. When the diva throws a fit, the diva gets what she wants,\u201d Cindy says.\n\nCindy Erdos Mark napping on the boat\n\nThey sleep on the boat so that saves them money on hotels and accommodations, but they sometimes pay to dock in marinas, and they spend most of the rest of their money on food and entertainment in the ports.\n\nHow did you save enough to be able to retire early and sail the world? \u201cWe both worked but lived off one paycheck and banked the other one,\u201d Mark says. (Mark worked in sales for most of his career, Cindy owned her own business.) \u201cWe worked our butts off, saved and saved and saved for over 20 years, avoided debt and lived well within our means,\u201d he adds. \u201cThere is no magic button to push landing in this lifestyle.\u201d\n\nHe adds that they \u201ctook full advantage of a company match 401K\u201d and \u201copened IRAs and Roths to the full allowance of the tax laws.\u201d And Cindy owned her own company, which Mark says allowed them to \u201creally sock away funds pre-tax.\u201d\n\nIn the early years, they were in 100% equities and got more conservative as they aged. They also favored S&P 500 funds and full market index funds, stayed the course during the recession, and hired a financial advisor, he says. They even had a little fun: \u201cI kept some money aside for what I termed as wildcat investing. Nothing ever hit big but it was fun to try,\u201d Mark says.\n\nThey weren\u2019t always savers. When they were first married in their early 20s, \u201cwe did something that was evil,\u201d Mark jokes, \u201cwe borrowed money.\u201d But they soon got rid of all the debt, and \u2014 both had grown up around boats \u2014 began to seriously talk about their dreams of one day sailing the world. \u201cThis was 30 years ago. We got out a pencil and paper, put together a series of tables on \u2018if we save this, this is the amount we could generate in income.\u201d They also shunned buying fancy cars and paid off their home in Atlanta in 15 years.\n\nCindy Erdos Mark looking out at the sea\n\nThey sold their home \u2014 themselves, to avoid Realtor commissions \u2014 and used the money from the transaction to fund the period of time they had to wait until they could start pulling money from their IRA. They are still U.S. citizens and pay U.S. taxes, which they file electronically. When I ask them about mail, Mark joked that they \u201cdon\u2019t want any \u2014 nothing good ever comes in the mail\u201d and says that they do most stuff like bill pay electronically.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t always easy, Mark says: \u201cAtlanta is materialistic. The hard part was avoiding the temptation to buy the nice car and the fancy house -- to still live within our means.\u201d But, he says, they reminded themselves of their ultimate goal \u2014 early retirement and a lifetime of sailing.\n\nMark also says he never viewed his career as a reflection of who he was as a person; instead he looked at it as a means to an end, a way to make a living. \u201cI joke that I would have shoveled dog sh** for $100,000 a year,\u201d he says. \u201cA job is a means to an end, a paycheck. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I used to enjoy what I did, but it wasn\u2019t who I was. I was a person who had a goal and the job was one of the stepping stones.\u201d\n\nDo you plan to keep doing this? \u201cWhen we started out we both agreed: As long as this is fun for both of us, we will keep doing it,\u201d Mark says. \u201cIt\u2019s been close a couple times,\u201d Mark jokes, citing some rough storms, \u201cbut so far we\u2019re both enjoying it still. We are both adventurous people, always wondering what is waiting around the corner.\u201d", "description": "Want to retire early?
