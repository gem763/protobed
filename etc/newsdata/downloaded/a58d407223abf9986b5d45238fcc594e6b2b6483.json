The film was made with a great respect for the indigenous people not just of North America but all over the world,\u201d Depp said.\n\n\"It's a pity that people jumped the gun and made these objections. However, their objections are their objections.\"\n\nHe continued: \u201dI can assure you that no one has any reason to go out to try to exploit.\n\n\u201cIt was a film made out of great respect and with great respect and love for the Native American peoples to bring light to them. They haven't had the greatest amount of help out of the United States government.\n\n\"The idea is as pure as it ever was, so we will come to an agreement so that everyone is happy.\"\n\nJust one day after Dior released the clip of its fragrance campaign, the French fashion brand removed the video from all social media accounts including Twitter, Instagram and YouTube.\n\nThe brand initially posted two clips of Canku Thomas One Star, a member of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe in South Dakota, performing the Fancy War Dance wearing a colourful traditional ensemble.\n\nIn the first clip, the dancer could be seen performing as a voiceover said: \u201cWe are the land.\u201d\n\nIn the caption the brand wrote: \u201cAn authentic journey deep into the Native American soul in a sacred, founding and secular territory.\u201d\n\nIn a second Instagram post, Dior shared images of Canku Thomas with a longer explanation of the brand\u2019s involvement with the Native American community.\n\n\u201cWith images saturated with colours and emotions, @c1star performs the mesmerising Fancy War Dance that embodies all the modernity of the Native American culture,\u201d the caption reads.\n\n\u201cA film developed as a close collaboration between the House of Dior and Native American consultants from the 50-year old Indigenous advocacy organization, @americansforindianopportunity in order to respect Indigenous cultures, values and heritage.\u201d\n\nDepp was also seen producing a guitar and playing a riff by guitarist Link Wray, who was part of the Native American Shawnee group.\n\nDior wrote that there would be \u201cmore to come\u201d on 1 September, but before the film was even released fully to the public, it already received backlash on social media.\n\n\u201cUsing Indigenous people and our culture for your new perfume aesthetic and feeling the need to name it \u2018Sauvage\u2019 is a completely bad take. Do better @Dior,\u201d one person wrote on Twitter.\n\nAnother added: \u201cCooooool, so you\u2019re telling me that @Dior is profiting off Indigenous culture/imagery, and hired JOHNNY DEPP to star in the ad for a perfume called SAUVAGE?! \u2026who thought this was okay? #boycottdior\u201d.\n\nIn a press release for the fragrance campaign, which is relaunching a scent first released in 2015 and previously advertised by Depp, the brand said the film is meant to be a continuation of the Hollywood star\u2019s last fragrance film, which saw him riding in the desert of the American West.\n\n\u201cThis new film is an echo to a \u2018declaration of love\u2019. A love letter to the spirit of a land that should be protected and cultures that should be celebrated, and to peoples that should be honoured,\u201d the brand wrote.\n\nIn 2016, Dior faced criticism for continuing to represent Depp following allegations of domestic abuse by his ex-wife Amber Heard.\n\nHeard accused Depp of domestic violence before settling the case for $7m (\u00a35.3m), which the Aquaman star donated to charity.\n\nJust one week after the settlement, Depp featured in a campaign for Sauvage alongside the slogan: \"Wild at heart.\"\n\nSocial media users accused the brand of poor timing and called for the actor to be dropped as the face of the fragrance.\n\n\"Johnny Depp may not be the best choice to represent the new 'Sauvage' fragrance considering the domestic abuse accusations. Bad timing,\" one person wrote on Twitter.\n\nDepp has always denied the abuse allegations and has said that they were, \"salacious false stories, gossip, misinformation, and lies\".", "description": "Johnny Depp has defended his latest campaign for Dior after it was pulled by the brand following accusations of cultural appropriation.", "authors": ["Sarah Young"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/08/30/20/screen-shot-2019-08-30-at-3.26.35-pm-0.png", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
