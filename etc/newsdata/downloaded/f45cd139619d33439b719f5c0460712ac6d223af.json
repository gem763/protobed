Thank-you for all your kind words, happy birthdays, cards, flowers and presents\u2026 #luckygirl x [sic].\u2019\n\nShe had to take a quick break from all the fun celebrations to get back to work on Strictly Come Dancing.\n\nLisa had to work her magic on the contestants for the show\u2019s Halloween special and shared a backstage close-up photo of Emma Barton\u2019s incredible make-up, including a shimmering red heart painted over her right eye.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Last nights make-up for my girl.. @theemmabarton assisted by @summerdyason We held our breath for over an hour!!!! #stillcantfeelmylegs#strictlyhalloween,\u2019 Lisa captioned the snap.\n\nBut then it was back to quaffing the champagne, with Lisa later sharing a lovely photo of her posing with her beloved mum Linda Armstrong.\n\nAlongside the cute snap, Lisa said: \u2018Celebrating my birthday with mama\u2026. #lovehersomuch!! @lindaarmstrong6220 #shesthebest x [sic].\u2019\n\nLisa has every reason to celebrate at the moment as she\u2019s reportedly landed a guest judge spot on BBC3\u2019s make-up series Glow Up.\n\nA source told The Sun: \u2018When Lisa was with Ant [McPartlin] she very much took the back seat. He was the TV star and a career on screen didn\u2019t massively appeal to her.\n\n\u2018ut she has been truly scooped up by the BBC and her Strictly family so when this offer came through to be a guest judge on Stacey\u2019s show Glow Up, and it was the Beeb, she jumped at the chance.\n\n\u2018She\u2019s really good on camera and is a leader in the make-up industry, so it makes sense.\u2019\n\nThe news has no doubt uplifted Lisa\u2019s spirits as she\u2019s had to publicly contend with her divorce from ex-husband Ant McPartlin over the past two years.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
