They have a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her so far.\u201d\n\nClinton did not name Gabbard, but the Hawaii congresswoman essentially acknowledged she was the target by blasting out a stunning Twitter thread against the former first lady.\n\n\u201cGreat! Thank you @HillaryClinton. You, the queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long, have finally come out from behind the curtain,\u201d Gabbard ranted at her fellow Democrat.\n\nGabbard, 38, accused 71-year-old Clinton, long a doyenne of the Washington establishment, of leading a \u201cconcerted campaign\u201d to destroy her reputation.\n\n\u201cNow we know \u2014 it was always you, through your proxies and powerful allies in the corporate media and war machine, afraid of the threat I pose,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s now clear that this primary is between you and me,\u201d she sneered. \u201cDon\u2019t cowardly hide behind your proxies. Join the race directly.\u201d\n\nClinton has said she is done running for president.\n\nGabbard\u2019s campaign is hanging by a thread. She is polling at barely one percent support in a sprawling field that includes former vice president Joe Biden and senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.\n\nHer tirade is startling given that it is from one presidential candidate to her own party\u2019s 2016 nominee, herself the target of Russian interference that year.\n\nUS media analysis has shown that sites tied to Russia have celebrated Gabbard\u2019s campaign launch, defended her controversial 2017 meeting with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, and attacked people who have suggested Gabbard is a pawn for Moscow.\n\nLast week The New York Times quoted influential Republicans who said they were impressed with her. Far-right conspiracy theorist Mike Cernovich said she \u201cseems very Trumpian.\u201d\n\nGabbard has rejected some of the support from rightwing or white nationalist sources, and during last week\u2019s Democratic debate she chastised the Times for publishing \u201csmears\u201d and said television commentators were \u201ccompletely despicable\u201d for calling her a Russian asset.\n\nThe US intelligence community has concluded that Russia interfered in the 2016 election to help boost Trump\u2019s chances of victory.\n\nClinton said it was clear Russia is laying the groundwork for similar interference in 2020.\n\nIn 2016, Green Party liberal Jill Stein won more votes than Trump\u2019s victory margin in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, states that could have secured the presidency for Clinton.", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 Hillary Clinton warned that Russia is grooming a US Democratic candidate for a third-party run next year, prompting the accused", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/20/6b21f5_democratic-presidential-hopeful-tulsi-gabbard-congresswoman-hawaii-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
