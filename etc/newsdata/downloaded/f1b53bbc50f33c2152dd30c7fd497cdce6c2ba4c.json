Trans students face bullying in school, which can lead to dropping out and landing in a high-risk, precarious line of work.\n\nI have walked \u201cRealness\u201d in balls before (\u201cTransman Realness: School Boy\u201d). After spending years as a tomboy who was maligned for my masculinity as a woman, receiving praise for my masculinity at a ball was incredibly gratifying. It was a way to celebrate my authenticity as a transgender man. For other binary trans people \u2014 those interested in passing \u2014 it might also affirm our ability to overcome the many obstacles to transitioning, which include discrimination from family, friends, doctors and others in our lives.\n\nBut the push to rethink \u201cRealness\u201d also has its merits, and offers the ballroom scene a chance to evolve and adapt to the times. It would be powerful if the category began to place less emphasis on aesthetics and more on character. For instance, my former house father Rucka Revlon told me about a time he once walked \u201cButchqueen Executive Realness,\u201d and the category called for a Clark Kent look. His creation: A costume that included custom-made Daily Planet business cards, a business suit and trench coat with a Superman outfit underneath, and other matching accessories. In this case, the category was as much about passing as straight as it was about passing as Clark Kent.\n\nWe are at a critical juncture, where a large number of L.G.B.T.Q. people don\u2019t have to hide who they are from the rest of the world. At the same time, living authentically as ourselves and daring to join others in the public sphere can still have real, life-or-death consequences. But I am not worried about the loss to ballroom history if \u201cRealness\u201d as it was originally conceived is abandoned \u2014 categories come and go in the ballroom scene. Some, like \u201cNostalgia\u201d or \u201cLeather vs. Suede,\u201d fall out of favor and are no longer used.\n\nAs the general public evolves in its understanding of gender identity and sexual orientation, and as the need to \u201cpass\u201d (either as a measure of acceptable gender aesthetics or as a mode of survival) becomes less pressing, the ballroom scene can alter its views on the category of \u201cRealness.\u201d This shift will make life a little easier for members of the community and open up new areas of artistic and creative opportunity within ballroom\u2019s future.\n\nSydney Baloue (@SydneyBaloue) is a writer and performer.
