Nigel Owens didn\u2019t get that memo.\n\nAt the Rugby World Cup in Japan, the Welsh referee seems to be second in visibility only to Michael Leitch, the captain of Japan whose face is everywhere thanks to his team\u2019s run through the pool stage and his posse of sponsors.\n\nOwens\u2018 face pops up in the stadiums, on TV, and online courtesy of witty advertisements for the referees\u2019 airline sponsor. He highlights bad traveler etiquette on flights by whistling for obstruction, offside, and failing to roll away. There\u2019s even a riff on his most famed line, the time he told a Treviso scrumhalf to stop shouting at him: \u201cThis is not soccer.\u201d\n\nOther lines of his have also passed into rugby legend.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to call me sir, I\u2019m from west Wales,\u201d Owens said in the Oxford-Cambridge Varsity Match.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to cheat, you cheat fair,\u201d he told Barbarians scrumhalf Andy Ellis after a crooked scrum feed against New Zealand.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t like to scrummage you\u2019re in the wrong position,\u201d he told the front rows of Munster and Toulouse.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m straighter than that one,\u201d he said after a Harlequins hooker\u2019s lineout throw-in was way off.\n\n\u201cDive like that again and come back here in two weeks and play, not today,\u201d he warned Scotland fullback Stuart Hogg at Newcastle\u2019s soccer stadium, St James\u2019 Park, at the previous Rugby World Cup.\n\nOwens says he doesn\u2019t prepare one-liners.\n\n\u201cI do not do one-liners to humiliate any players, and I certainly don\u2019t prepare any one-liners. I just go on the field to be myself,\u201d he says. \u201cI referee what\u2019s in front of me, and I referee to the best of my ability.\u201d\n\nThat firm but empathetic control of matches has him on course to referee a second Rugby World Cup final in the last months of his international career.\n\nReferees in Japan have drawn a distracting amount of the spotlight for policing high tackles, but Owens has avoided controversial moments while whistling three matches - with United States-Tonga to come on Sunday - and assisting in two others.\n\nOwens had Japan-Russia on opening night, and drew jeers from the partisan crown after rubbing out a Kotaro Matsushima try because the Japan winger dropped the ball reaching for the line. Cheers came minutes later when Matsushima scored legitimately. There was a quiet apology to the losing Canadians from Owens when he had to rule out what they thought was their first try against Italy. There was nothing but certainty in sending off Tomas Lavanini with video help after initially missing the Argentina lock\u2019s dangerous high tackle in the game against England.\n\nTo retired ref Jonathan Kaplan, whose record of 70 tests Owens surpassed in 2016, the Welshman is the best referee of this generation.\n\n\u201cHis communication skills and overall style set him apart from his peers and I enjoy watching him referee,\u201d says Kaplan, who, like Owens, also went to four Rugby World Cups.\n\nOwens says the best part of refereeing is being part of the game.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the next best seat to playing,\u201d he says. \u201cYou need to remember you\u2019re a small part of it. You are an important part of the game but not the most important part. The most important are the players, but as a referee you\u2019re very lucky and privileged to be facilitating the game.\u201d\n\nLike players, refs want to be in the big games. Owens had the most recent of the biggest ones, the 2015 Rugby World Cup final at Twickenham. It\u2019s a favorite memory for him also because it was a great final, he didn\u2019t affect the outcome, and he was moved after the final whistle when Australia\u2019s David Pocock and New Zealand\u2019s Jerome Kaino thanked him before commiserating and celebrating with their respective teams.\n\nHis other favorite match was South Africa-New Zealand in 2013 at Ellis Park, a nine-try classic the All Blacks won despite two yellow cards. The pace was so relentless that Owens was crippled by cramps at the end.\n\nOnly South Africa\u2019s Andre Watson has refereed two Rugby World Cup finals, in 1999 and 2003, and Owens could join him, but only if Wales fail to reach the Nov. 2 final at Yokohama.\n\nIf Wales does make the final, Owens still has a great occasion to look forward to. He\u2019s been given special dispensation to officiate Wales for the first time when it meets the Barbarians in November in Cardiff.\n\nThe 48-year-old Owens is deeply proud of his Welshness.\n\nHe wrote for the Sports Chronicle last month that he grew up in a village of 140 people and didn\u2019t speak English until he was about eight. He was advised at school to try refereeing by his teacher after he missed a match-winning conversion attempt in front of the posts.\n\nOwens came out as gay in 2007, and remains the only openly gay man in major rugby.\n\nWhen he began to think at 19 he was gay, he was conflicted and worried about it being revealed. The stress made him bulimic and suicidal. Now he\u2019s become an outspoken advocate of mental health services, encouraging people who need help to talk to someone or seek expert advice.\n\nBeing seen and heard. Owens got that memo.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Rugby referees are best seen and not heard, it is said.
