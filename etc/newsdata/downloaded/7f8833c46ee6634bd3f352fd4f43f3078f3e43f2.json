The bodies were being taken to Monterrey for DNA tests.\n\nDe la Garza said the victims could have been killed as long as two days ago at another location, then transported to San Juan, a town in Cadereyta municipality, about 75 miles south-west of the border crossing at Roma, Texas.\n\nMexican drug cartels have been waging an increasingly bloody war to control smuggling routes, the local drug market and extortion rackets, including shakedowns of migrants seeking to reach the United States.\n\nA drug gang allied with the Sinaloa cartel left 35 bodies at a freeway overpass in the city of Veracruz in September, and police found 32 other bodies, apparently killed by the same gang, a few days after that.\n\nThe goal apparently was to take over territory that had been dominated by the Zetas.\n\nTwenty-six bodies were found in November in Guadalajara, another territory being disputed by the Zetas and the Sinaloa group.\n\nSo far this month, 23 bodies were found dumped or hanging in the city of Nuevo Laredo, and 18 were found along a highway south of Guadalajara, Mexico's second-largest city.\n\nIn April, police found the mutilated bodies of 14 men in a minivan abandoned in downtown Nuevo Laredo, along with a message from an undisclosed drug gang.\n\nAlso in April, the tortured and bound bodies of seven men were dumped in the Pacific port city of Lazaro Cardenas along with messages signed by allies of the Sinaloa drug gang.\n\nOfficials last year found 183 bodies in mass graves in the Tamaulipas state town of San Fernando. They were believed to have been migrants killed by the Zetas drug cartel. Another 72 migrants, many of them from Central America, were found slain in San Fernando in 2010.", "description": "Zetas drug cartel takes responsibility for massacre, the latest in an escalating tally of mass killings near US border", "authors": ["Associated Press", "Luis Hern\u00e1ndez Navarro"], "top_image": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png", "published_at": "2012-05-13"}
