Some Democrats in conservative states took the position that it wasn\u2019t their fault that cases voters regarded as constitutionally wrong and morally unprincipled were being decided. Blame the justices, not them.\n\nThe assault on the court has become worse now that Democrats see their primary avenue to legal and cultural change slipping away. The latest is the post-confirmation assault on Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Opponents failed to deny him a seat on the court with testimony from Christine Blasey Ford, who couldn\u2019t remember important details of a sexual assault she claimed Justice Kavanaugh perpetrated on her.\n\nBut frustrated Democrats at The New York Times keep trying. The Times published a story last Sunday that alleged Justice Kavanaugh, while at Yale, \u201cexposed himself and friends pushed his penis into the hands of a female student.\u201d The incident was supposedly witnessed by a classmate, Max Stier, who went on to become a lawyer for Bill Clinton (oh, the irony), who supposedly communicated the story to the FBI and senators at the time of Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination.\n\nAccording to the AP, The Times story \u201cwas based on an upcoming book by Times reporters Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly, \u2018The Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation,\u2019 about the junior justice\u2019s brutal confirmation battle last year.\u201d\n\nJustice Kavanaugh denies the incident ever happened. The young woman the incident supposedly happened to has declined to be interviewed, and, according to friends, \u201cdoesn\u2019t recall the incident.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post reportedly had the same secondhand information about Justice Kavanaugh a year ago, but \u201cdid not run the article because they could not confirm key details of the story.\u201d\n\nThe Times, unconcerned with key details, went full-steam ahead. The rather weak editor\u2019s note they were forced to publish on Sunday \u201ccorrecting\u201d the story pointed out quite glaringly its journalistic ineptitude. And in what can only be described as an assault to its reputation as a trusted media outlet, The Times, said Andrew Sullivan in New York magazine, has \u201cabandoned liberalism for activism.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s an old journalistic cliche that says don\u2019t let facts get in the way of a good story and once again The Times is so eager to keep the Supreme Court and government in general under the control of Democrats that they will print anything, whether it is true or not, to further that goal.\n\nYou\u2019d think The Times\u2019 troubles would give other newspapers pause before they tried smearing a person\u2019s reputation in pursuit of political goals, but no.\n\nAfter The Times\u2019 half-hearted correction, The Washington Post jumped into the mud pit with stories about previous attempts to impeach Supreme Court justices and promoting claims by those who say Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation wasn\u2019t fair (it wasn\u2019t for him, but that\u2019s not what they mean).\n\nAs one would expect, several Democratic presidential candidates rushed to judgment and demanded Justice Kavanaugh be impeached. Questions have been raised, after all, but liberal Democrats are the ones who are raising them. It\u2019s always the seriousness of the charge, not whether the charge has merit. When the charge is proved bogus, the left moves onto new charges against the same or other persons whose views they oppose.\n\nAs a Wall Street Journal editorial noted, \u201cIt\u2019s important to understand that this assault on the justice is part of the left\u2019s larger campaign against the legitimacy of the current Supreme Court and an independent judiciary.\u201d\n\nThis is all the left has in their dwindling arsenal. They\u2019re still after President Trump\u2019s tax records. They hate his Supreme Court appointments. They are livid that his economic policies are working when they have always believed the economy was their issue \u2014 never mind their failure to achieve any level of success close to what Mr. Trump\u2019s administration has accomplished.\n\nIf the current Democratic Party were a defendant in court, it could credibly plead insanity. Let\u2019s see how far this insane behavior gets them with voters in the next election.\n\n\u2022 Cal Thomas, a nationally syndicated columnist, is the author of \u201cAmerica\u2019s Expiration Date: The Fall of Empires, Superpowers and the United States\u201d (HarperCollins/Zondervan, January 2020).\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
