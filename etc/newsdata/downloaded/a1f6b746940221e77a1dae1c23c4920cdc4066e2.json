It is a great way to browse the internet without getting tracked. There are a bunch of VPN apps that you can try.\n\nWe recommend OpenVPN on Google Play Store as the app is free to use and the UI is pretty straightforward too. Just select a different country other than India and you're pretty much good to go.\n\nDon't Miss 18.6 K SHARES 13.6 K SHARES 5 K SHARES 3.6 K SHARES 4.5 K SHARES\n\nReuters\n\nSwitching to Desktop App\n\nIf you don't want to switch to a VPN, you can also use the desktop app for Telegram from its official website. If your ISP on the PC/Laptop is blocking Telegram too, use VPN on Google Chrome browser extensions to circumvent this.\n\nAdd some DNS magic\n\nAdditionally, if you want you can even change the DNS (Domain Name System) on your router. To do this, log into your router's admin panel through the gateway 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.0.1.\n\nReuters\n\nNext, it'll ask you for a username/password. If you haven't set anything up, chances are it would be admin/admin respectively.\n\nNow locate DNS settings and enter Google's DNS (8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4) or Cloudfare DNS (1.1.1.1 and 1.0.0.1) and you should be able to connect to Telegram without any issues.", "description": "If you're an avid Telegram user, you might have noticed that the app might appear to be down after a law student from Kerela has filed a PIL to scrutinise the activity of the messenger in India.
