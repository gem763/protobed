His vehicle was set ablaze.\n\nAuthorities blocked text messaging services after the driver's death.\n\nNew Delhi had just restored call and text services for mobile phones on Monday, following a 72-day communications blackout, although internet services remain blocked. Landlines were restored previously.\n\nAll three killed were not from Kashmir, which has been split between India and Pakistan since 1947 and has been the spark of two wars and numerous skirmishes.\n\nNew Delhi sent in tens of thousands of extra troops ahead of the autonomy move in what was already one of the world's most heavily militarised zones.\n\n- Explosion, gunfire -\n\nAuthorities repeatedly said during the lockdown that Kashmir was mostly peaceful.\n\nSince August 5, protests have broken out, several civilians have died and security forces killed several militants in gun battles.\n\nEarly Wednesday, soldiers surrounded a residential area near Bijbehara town about 45 kilometres (28 miles) south of the main city of Srinagar after receiving reports about three alleged anti-India rebels.\n\n\"Three militants who all appear to be locals were killed in the operation in an exchange of fire, which was started based on intelligence about their presence in a house,\" senior police officer Munir Khan told AFP.\n\nResidents told AFP they were woken up by a loud explosion about 3:00 am local time, after which they heard gunfire that carried on intermittently for several hours.\n\nKhan said their bodies were not retrieved from the house but that an automatic assault rifle and one pistol were found after the operation.\n\nA witness told AFP via a mobile phone from the area that soldiers had blown up the house with explosives, sparking a fire that gutted the structure.\n\nIt was not clear if it was blown up before or after the gun fight.\n\nAn armed rebellion against Indian rule has raged in the valley since 1989, claiming tens of thousands of lives, mostly civilians.\n\nThe rebels have demanded independence or to join Pakistan which, like India, claims the region.", "description": "Two non-Kashmiris were shot dead by suspected militants and three alleged rebels were killed by security forces, police said Wednesday, the deadliest day in the Indian-administered Kashmir valley since New Delhi revoked its autonomy.
