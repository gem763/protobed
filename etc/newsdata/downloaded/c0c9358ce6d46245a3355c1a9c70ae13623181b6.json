Europe is deeply moved by the magnitude of this calamity and its global and long-term consequences.\"\n\nTusk added, \"We do not want to lecture anyone, we have no right to do so, as our own history is to a large extent a history of deforestation for land use and industry. But this is why we feel even more co-responsible for saving forests \u2014 on our continent and all around the world.\"\n\nIn addition to financial support, Tusk said the EU was ready to deploy emergency services missions under the auspices of the Union Civil Protection Mechanism, and he said the Copernicus satellite emergency system could be made available to provide maps of affected sites.", "description": "Council president concedes Europe has \u2018no right\u2019 to lecture given legacy of deforestation.", "authors": ["David M.
