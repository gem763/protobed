He\u2019s got the CIA. He\u2019s got the Pentagon. He\u2019s got a number of other agencies. Why did he use three private lawyers to get information on Biden from the Ukrainian government rather than go through all of the agencies of his government?\u201d Wallace asked Miller in an interview on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d\n\nTrump, according to a memo of his July 25 phone conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and an anonymous whistleblower complaint, repeatedly pressed Ukrainian officials to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter, and noted that his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, and Attorney General William Barr would be in contact with Ukraine on the probe. The investigation was based on a dubious claim that, as vice president in 2016, Biden pushed Ukraine\u2019s government to oust a prosecutor who was investigating Burisma, a Ukrainian gas company that had Hunter Biden on its board starting in 2014, receiving a $50,000 monthly salary.\n\nWhile Joe Biden did call for the prosecutor\u2019s removal, he was one of many international leaders who did so in response to concerns about corruption. Yet, despite the lack of evidence, Giuliani began pressing the Ukrainians to investigate the Bidens' role in the prosecutor\u2019s firing earlier this year.\n\n\u201cTwo different points, No. 1 \u2014 \u201d Miller began to respond but was interrupted by Wallace.\n\n\u201cHow about answering my question?\u201d Wallace pressed as Miller tried to discuss U.S. Attorney John Durham, who was picked by Barr to look into the origins of the FBI\u2019s investigation into possible collusion between Russia and Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign. Durham has been leading the probe into whether Ukraine was involved in any 2016 election efforts.\n\nMiller, in defense of the president, continued to say Trump\u2019s attorney general appointed Durham to investigate the Russia probe and Giuliani \u201camong others\u201d (including D.C. lawyers Joe diGenova and Victoria Toensing, Fox News reported Sunday) to investigate \u201cUkrainian corruption.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is proper and natural for frankly anybody concerned about the future of Ukraine and the United States to want to know information about corrupt dealings,\u201d he said.\n\nFox News anchor and moderator Chris Wallace and White House senior adviser Stephen Miller (Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images; photo by Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images) More\n\nTrump, according to the whistleblower complaint, personally ordered almost $400 million in military aid to be withheld from Ukraine prior to the July 25 call, and Ukrainians understood the conversation to mean they needed to move forward on specific corruption cases. It was amid this information that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced last week the formal impeachment inquiry into Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine.\n\nWhen Wallace asked why Trump withheld aid from Ukraine, Miller accused him of \u201cadmonishing\u201d the president, saying the Fox News host had a \u201ctone of judgment\u201d in all of his questions.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the president\u2019s job and sworn duty to safeguard taxpayers\u2019 dollars and the United States\u2019 government foreign policy,\u201d Miller said, presumably drawing reference from a popular Trump talking point deriding the cost of the Mueller probe. \u201cGetting to the bottom of a corruption scandal in the Ukraine is in the American national interest.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd if you want to understand why that complainant is so obviously politically biased when he says the president is threatening national security by trying to expose corruption, when he says \u2014 or she \u2014 that the president is hurting national security by trying to get to the bottom of a gigantic scandal that nobody has unearthed,\u201d Miller continued. \u201cThe president is the whistleblower here. The president of the United States is the whistleblower. And this individual is a saboteur trying to undermine a democratically elected government.\u201d", "description": "Fox News host Chris Wallace grilled White House adviser Stephen Miller on why President Trump used personal attorneys to press a foreign country to investigate a political rival rather than seek official channels for justice.", "authors": ["Kadia Tubman"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/.mKHQ3DgrP6iTgu0oSTNZA--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/69379190-e2dd-11e9-aa76-494d31b0b857", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
