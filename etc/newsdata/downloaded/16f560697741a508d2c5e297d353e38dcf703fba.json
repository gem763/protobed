Sign up here to get it in your inbox every weekday morning.\n\nBrexit talks are on the brink of collapse. At least that\u2019s what the British government briefed yesterday, putting the responsibility squarely on the shoulders of the European Union, and particularly German Chancellor Angela Merkel. For EU Council President Donald Tusk, the whole \u2018\u2018stupid blame game\u2019\u2019 doesn\u2019t do anyone any good. Neither side has yet been brave enough to finally pull the plug, but nothing has yet been arranged for today. The U.K. says they\u2019ll meet \u2018\u2018soon,\u2019\u2019 and the Commission is \u2018\u2018available.\u2019\u2019 An address by Jean-Claude Juncker and EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier at the European Parliament this afternoon might offer some clarity.\n\nWhat\u2019s Happening\n\nEurogroup Meets | Euro-area finance ministers meeting in Luxembourg today will debate the final key elements of a small budget for the currency bloc, seeking to cap two years of difficult negotiations over a tool that falls far short of Emmanuel Macron's original sweeping vision. Here\u2019s a look at the outstanding points and why a deal may still be elusive.\n\nNew Banker | Finance ministers are also due to endorse the appointment of Fabio Panetta, the Bank of Italy\u2019s No. 2 official, to the Executive Board of the ECB. He would become the fourth Italian in the central bank\u2019s leadership echelon since its creation, following in the footsteps of President Mario Draghi.\n\n5G Security | The EU will warn against a nightmare scenario whereby hackers or hostile states assume control of everything from electricity grids to police communications and home appliances. While it doesn\u2019t name China or Huawei, a new report opens the door to measures to prevent over-dependence on a single supplier, especially if it\u2019s from a country with poor democratic standards.\n\nBalkan Expansion | EU government envoys will debate starting accession negotiations with Albania and North Macedonia today. While the draft communique under discussion does give a green light, countries such as France, the Netherlands, Denmark, Greece and Bulgaria still have reservations (for different reasons), meaning that any positive nod would probably be vague, and have strings attached.\n\nPolish Elections | Opinion polls suggest Law & Justice will cement its grip on power in this Sunday\u2019s Polish election. The result of the vote may determine whether Poland\u2019s transformation \u2014whereby state companies became political machines, civil liberties were curtailed and public television was turned into a mouthpiece \u2014 becomes irreversible. It all started with a plane crash.\n\nIn Case You Missed It\n\nCarbon Tax | The EU is poised to bring trade policy into the fight against climate change, a move that risks stoking global tensions. Frans Timmermans, the designated EU climate czar, said that the EU should analyze introducing a carbon border tax, preventing European energy-intensive manufacturers such as steelmakers from relocating outside the EU to avoid emission curbs.\n\nVestager\u2019s Promise | Margrethe Vestager promised a clampdown on big tech during her European Parliament audition for a job that will equip her with greater weaponry to take on the Silicon Valley giants. Her five-year term will focus on digital-services rules to set new liability and safety limits for internet platforms. Here are her biggest hits so far.\n\nCrypto Assets | Crypto assets such as Libra could have a systemic effect on financial stability and should be regulated by the EU, according to the bloc\u2019s incoming financial services chief. Valdis Dombrovskis said the EU is currently working on a regulatory framework for cryptos, echoing concerns by authorities around the world about Facebook\u2019s plan for a digital currency.\n\nCar Pollution | Whatever happens with Brexit, Europe and the U.K. will be united by filthy air and a slowly unfolding public-health crisis caused by its embrace of diesel. Worldwide, 90% of people breathe dirty air, costing 7 million lives a year.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Welcome to the Brussels Edition, Bloomberg\u2019s daily briefing on what matters most in the heart of the European Union.
