(Image: PBS)\n\nBarney is a dinosaur who we all know from TV, but now Mattel is bringing Barney & Friends to the big screen.\n\nVariety reports that Mattel Films and Daniel Kaluuya\u2019s (Get Out, Black Panther) production company, 59%, are teaming up to make a live-action Barney movie about a stuffed purple dinosaur who\u2019s brought to life through the imaginations of children who all love to sing and dance to solve their problems.\n\n\u201cBarney was a ubiquitous figure in many of our childhoods, then he disappeared into the shadows, left misunderstood,\u201d Kaluuya said in curious statement. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to explore this compelling modern-day hero and see if his message of \u2018I love you, you love me\u2019 can stand the test of time.\u201d\n\nSo what will this new Barney for the 2020s look like exactly?\n\nMattel Films head Robbie Brenner explained that the movie will be something of a new spin on the classic children\u2019s TV series that\u2019ll appeal to audiences young and old. \u201cWorking with Daniel Kaluuya will enable us to take a completely new approach to Barney that will surprise audiences and subvert expectations,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThe project will speak to the nostalgia of the brand in a way that will resonate with adults, while entertaining today\u2019s kids.\u201d\n\nGiven how the basic Barney formula seems not to have changed all that much over the past three decades, it\u2019ll be interesting to see how the new Barney movie will \u201csubvert expectations,\u201d and if it\u2019ll end up taking the gritty-action adventure route Dora the Explorer\u2019s big-screen adaptation went with when the movie drops sometime in the future.", "description": "Barney is a dinosaur who we all know from TV, but now Mattel is bringing Barney & Friends to the big screen....", "authors": ["Kyle Mizokami", "Jennings Brown"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/uf5m2lt5zvgvygw6sv3x.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
