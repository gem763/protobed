It came together so beautifully in a way that no one would be able to plan with having the whale breaching and the submarine so close together. It all boiled down to right time, right place,\u201d Wise told Business Insider South Africa.\n\nWhile whales and the submarine are often spotted around these waters, images of the two so close together and in the same frame are rare.\n\n\u201cDue to so many sightings of whales along the coastline lately between Simon\u2019s Town and Fish Hoek I had spent the day heading from beach to beach to try and capture them. It was my fourth trip down to Long Beach, Simon\u2019s Town for that day, which is when I spotted a whale swimming close to the shoreline,\u201d said Wise.\n\n\u201cIn the beginning it wasn\u2019t very active, only being able to see its back as it swam along before it disappeared completely. Then suddenly, without warning, it started to breach in front of the submarine and that is when I started snapping away,\u201d said Wise.\n\nThe photobombing submarine, identified by readers on Reddit as being the SAS Manthatisi (S101), was making its way out of the Simon's Town harbour when it interjected Wise\u2019s shot. According to the thread, the sub is smoking because it is running its diesel generator to charge its batteries needed for use underwater.\n\nSee also: 25 stunning photos of synchronised swimmers taken at the perfect time\n\n\u201cThe moment happened so suddenly, I just took the opportunity to try and get the best shot possible and capture the beauty of a once in a lifetime moment,\u201d she said.\n\nAs the pic started to spread over social media one reader, whose husband was on board the submarine, kindly sent the post on to the crew.\n\nWise started taking photographs 6 years ago with a tiny hand held Samsung camera and enjoys taking scenic and wildlife photographs.\n\n\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "While whales and the submarine are often spotted around these waters, images of the two so close together and in the same frame are rare.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9377/2384bc108b5843b4ba7b4fd4f5e69bd7.png", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
