Minshew, a sixth-round draft pick, was forced to take over for the Jaguars last Sunday when Nick Foles broke his collarbone in the first quarter.\n\nAs Houston prepares to meet Jacksonville on Sunday in Minshew\u2019s first NFL start, Watson compared has debut in that opener to how things were the following week when he started.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a different energy coming off the bench to (playing) when everyone has been focused on you,\u201d Watson said. \u201cThe tape and everyone\u2019s been focused on everything that you\u2019re good at, what your weaknesses are, throughout the week. They have all days to focus on those things and try to put a game plan around you, and \u2026 it\u2019s hard to really explain unless you\u2019re in that position. It\u2019s a different type of feel.\u201d\n\nMinshew looked good last week against Kansas City, completing his first 13 passes and finishing 22 of 25 for 275 yards with two touchdowns and an interception in the 40-26 loss.\n\nJacksonville coach Doug Marrone was impressed with Minshew\u2019s performance and poise in his debut, but knows things will be tougher against a Texans team looking to bounce back from a wild 30-28 loss to New Orleans.\n\n\u201cThe challenge is, \u2018Hey listen, we have to repeat this. Where are we going to go?\u2019 There are some people who will question whether he can keep it up,\u201d Marron said. \u201c\u2018Do you think he can do that again?\u2019 I think that\u2019s the challenge, but the one thing I do know about the kid is that he will work his butt off this week, and he will do everything he possibly can, which you appreciate. I think he will have confidence and I think our opponent will be trying to knock the confidence out of him.\u201d\n\nNow that he knows starting he\u2019s trying to keep the same mindset he\u2019s always had.\n\n\u201cJust like any other week,\u201d Minshew said. \u201cTrying to be the best I can for the team. The role changes, but the approach doesn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nSome things to know about the Jaguars-Texans game:\n\nZEROES FOR WATT\n\nLast week was the first time in 105 career games when three-time Defensive Player of the Year J.J. Watt did not have a tackle or quarterback hit. The defensive end was asked if he was surprised to have zeroes across his stat line for the first time in his illustrious career.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve had bad games before and I\u2019ll have bad games again. People like to focus on it, and I don\u2019t blame them. I understand. But I\u2019m focused on Jacksonville. It\u2019s my job to go out there and not do that again, so that\u2019s what I\u2019ll do.\u201d\n\nWatt has had plenty of success against the Jaguars and has 16 career sacks against them, his second most against any team.\n\nSACKSONVILLE?\n\nJacksonville failed to sack Kansas City\u2019s Patrick Mahomes last week, and then defensive ends Calais Campbell (foot) and Yannick Ngakoue (hamstring) showed up on the injury report. It\u2019s not the ideal start for a team built around its defensive front. But the Jaguars have had success against Houston in recent years, making a combined 21 sacks in the last four meetings. Most of those came against Watson.\n\n\u201cHe is a very special quarterback, so it\u2019s important for us to make him uncomfortable,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cThat might give us our best chance to stop him. But the Saints got to him six times and still that last drive was incredible, spectacular.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just continuous pursuit,\u201d he continued. \u201cYou can never be satisfied. If you get there six times, you need to get there seven. He\u2019s incredible.\u201d\n\nHOPKINS VS. RAMSEY\n\nThe matchup between Houston receiver DeAndre Hopkins and Jacksonville cornerback Jalen Ramsey has become one of the more entertaining in the league. Ramsey has slowed Hopkins in some of the meetings and limited him to 50 yards in the first matchup last season. But Hopkins got the best of Ramsey in their last game when he caught a career-high 12 passes and finished with 147 yards receiving in a 20-3 win in December.\n\nINJURY WOES\n\nThe Jaguars have had an unusual run of key injuries in season openers.\n\nRunning back Chris Ivory, one of the team\u2019s top free agents in 2016, was hospitalized before the 2016 opener with a \u201cgeneral medical issue\u201d and missed several games. Receiver Allen Robinson tore knee ligaments in the 2017 opener and missed the rest of the season. Running back Leonard Fournette strained a hamstring in the 2018 opener and was sidelined for six of the next seven games. And now Foles is out indefinitely with a broken collarbone.\n\n\u201cHopefully we\u2019ve learned to handle adversity,\u201d receiver Marqise Lee said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Though Deshaun Watson has been Houston's starting quarterback for a while now, he vividly remembers being thrown into action midgame as a rookie in the team's opener, just as Jacksonville's Gardner Minshew was last week.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Kristie Rieken"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/11/jaguars_minshew_jaguars_20909_c0-84-2000-1250_s1770x1032.jpg?299aef161871dd3e8e2369fbee176c61f9e10561", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
