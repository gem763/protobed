The government appealed the court's finding to the FISA Court of Review, which sided with the lower court.\n\nUltimately, the FBI agreed to amend the querying process, requiring the agency to justify in writing why it is looking into any person in the U.S.\n\nFor years, civil liberties advocates have argued that the law at the center of the dispute \u2013 Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) \u2014 violates constitutional rights as it allows the government to collect data on Americans without a warrant.\n\nCongress last year reauthorized Section 702 with few alterations after a bitter battle between privacy activists and security hawks in both chambers.\n\n\u201cLast year, when Congress reauthorized Section 702 of FISA, it accepted the FBI\u2019s outright refusal to account for all its warrantless backdoor searches of Americans,\u201d Sen.
