Here's What To Know", "language": "en", "text": "More than a year after she fatally shot Botham Jean, 26, in his Dallas apartment on Sept. 6, 2018, a trial for Amber Guyger is now underway in the city. She is facing murder charges. The defense rested its case Monday, and prosecutors rested their case against Guyger on Thursday afternoon. The jury went for deliberation on Monday afternoon.\n\nGuyger, a former Dallas police officer, told 9-1-1 dispatchers and investigators that she mistakingly entered Jean\u2019s apartment thinking it was her own after ending a lengthy work shift. In their building, Jean\u2019s apartment was one floor directly above Guyger\u2019s. She was still in uniform, and Jean was unarmed. The incident sparked national outcry amid a string of fatal police shootings of unarmed black men.\n\nThough the case was at first investigated as an officer-involved shooting, Guyger was off-duty at the time, and the investigation protocol changed by the next day to include charges against Guyger, according to the Dallas Police Chief.\n\nHere\u2019s what to know about the trial.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

During closing statements, prosecutor Jason Fine said Guyger missed five cues that should have alerted her that she was at the wrong apartment, and said the jury should think from Jean\u2019s perspective. \u201cNobody had to die. She caused his death. She acted unreasonably,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Toby Shook, Guyger\u2019s attorney, urged the jury not to let their emotions get in the way of their verdict. He called the case a tragedy, one with no winners, and added that the state had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Guyger was not acting in self-defense. \u201cIf they can\u2019t do that, it\u2019s not guilty,\u201d he said.\n\nAmber Guyger took the stand on Friday, the fifth day of the trial. Through tears she told the court she was sorry, and said she wished it had been her who died that night. \u201cI never wanted to take an innocent person\u2019s life,\u201d she said. It was the first time she\u2019s spoken publicly since the shooting.\n\nGuyger demonstrated for the jury the way the events unfolded the night of the shooting. Defense attorney Toby Shook had Guyger stand up and demonstrate what happened in a reenactment of the night. Guyger began sobbing as she was handed a bullet proof vest to begin the demonstration. Judge Tammy Kemp then announced a recess to allow Guyger to compose herself.\n\nThe state of Texas rested its case against Guyger on Thursday afternoon, the fourth day of a trial that was expected to last two weeks. On Thursday, Texas Ranger Michael Adcock testified that Guyger did not have blood on her uniform and that her latex gloves appeared unused \u2014 the prosecution suggested this was a sign she did not attempt to save Jean\u2019s life after shooting him.\n\nThe first day of the trial was spent by the prosecution detailing all of the cues they argued Guyger missed that could have alerted her to being in the wrong location. Prosecutors also detailed sexually explicit text conversations between Guyger and another police officer the day of the shooting to put into question if she was actually fatigued after leaving work. This is an argument put forward by the defense.\n\nOn day two of the trial, Jean\u2019s neighbor from across the hall, Joshua Brown, told the court he met Jean for the first time earlier in the day on Sept. 6, 2018, the day Jean was shot. Brown became emotional, and had to take a break from questioning, after he described that he would often hear Jean singing gospel or Drake songs inside his apartment.\n\nOn day three of the trial on Wednesday, Jean\u2019s family witnessed police body-camera footage of the attempt to save his life, CNN reports. Judge Tammy Kemp had requested the footage be played in the court room, and later apologized to the court, saying \u201cI didn\u2019t even give any thought to the victim\u2019s family \u2014 the alleged victim\u2019s family being here,\u201d The Dallas Morning News reports.\n\nThis was the second time the body cam footage was show in court. The footage had played before jurors on day-2 as well, but the family had been given a warning prior, according to the Morning News.\n\nAlso on day three, David Armstrong, the Texas Ranger leading the investigation of the case, told the court without the jury present that he believed Guyger had not committed a crime. (The jury had left the room so Judge Kemp could determine what Armstrong\u2019s testimony could detail, and decided Armstrong could not testify before a jury whether he believed Guyer\u2019s reaction on the night of Sept. 6 was reasonable.) However, while the jury was present, Armstrong told the court that it was common for residents of the apartment complex where Guyger and Botham lived to be confused by the layout, according to the Morning News.\n\nWho was Botham Jean?\n\nJean grew up in St. Lucia, and moved to Arkansas in 2011, according to Dallas ABC affiliate WFAA, to study accounting and information technology at Harding University. He was a singer, according to a statement from the university, and often led campus events in worship.\n\n\u201cBotham was in the prime of his life,\u201d Jean\u2019s uncle, Ignatius Jean, told the Associated Press.\n\nJean graduated from Harding in 2016, and moved to Dallas to begin a career at PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC). Tim Ryan, PwC U.S. Chairman, later announced a campaign to address unconscious racial bias after learning of Jean\u2019s killing.\n\n\u201cFor many, Bo\u2019s death is the fullest manifestation of the bias that black people in this country regularly experience in their daily lives,\u201d Ryan wrote in an opinion piece for The Dallas Morning News. \u201cAs chief executives and business leaders, we may not have the power to stop tragedies like what happened to Bo from happening again. However, we do have power and influence, and there is a lot we can do to address implicit bias in order to make our workplaces and communities more just, equitable and inclusive.\u201d\n\nOn Sept. 6, Harding University announced the inaugural recipients of the Botham Jean scholarship at the university\u2019s School of Business Administration. The scholarship was established by Harding and PwC in Jean\u2019s honor.\n\n\u201cIn telling [Jean\u2019s] story, we challenge recipients to be great students and campus leaders, and most importantly, to follow Christ with their hearts,\u201d said Bryan Burks, Vice President of University Advancement, in a public statement. \u201cWhile Botham\u2019s life was cut short, he is remembered through this scholarship that will continue to impact the lives of our students for years to come.\u201d\n\nWhat has happened since the shooting in September 2018?\n\nAt a press conference the day after the shooting, Dallas Police Chief Rene\u00e9 Hall told reporters that Guyger\u2019s blood was tested for drug and alcohol use \u2014 the results of which have not been released publicly, but might be used as evidence in the trial \u2014 and a warrant was issued for her arrest. Hall added it wasn\u2019t clear what kind of interaction Guyger and Jean had when she entered the apartment. Guyger shot him, called 9-1-1 and police arrived in four minutes. Jean was taken to a hospital where he later died, Hall said.\n\nGuyger was charged with manslaughter and turned herself in after the police issued a warrant for her arrest three days after the shooting, according to records. The arrest warrant details that Guyger parked on the fourth floor of the apartment complex, though her apartment is on the third floor. When she arrived at the apartment she thought was hers, the door was \u201cslightly ajar\u201d and \u201cfully opened under the force of the key insertion.\u201d\n\nWith the door open, Guyger \u201c[believed] she had encountered a burglar, which was described as a large silhouette, across the room in her apartment,\u201d the warrant reads. Guyger said she then gave verbal commands that she claimed were ignored, it continues. \u201cAs a result, Guyger fired her handgun two times, striking [Jean] one time in the torso.\u201d\n\nTexas Rangers also arrived the day after the shooting to conduct an independent investigation.\n\nGuyger was fired by the Dallas Police Department on Sept. 24, the same day as Jean\u2019s funeral in St. Lucia. She had been employed by the police department for four years. Jean\u2019s family attorneys called the firing a success, according to the AP, but were committed to seeing her sentenced for murder. Guyger\u2019s attorney, Robert Rogers, called the decision to fire Guyger a bowing \u201cto pressure from anti-police groups,\u201d the AP reported. At the time, it was the first statement released by Guyger\u2019s representatives since the shooting.\n\nRogers added \u201cwords can never express our sorrow for the pain suffered by those who knew and loved Botham Jean.\u201d\n\nTIME has reached out to Guyger\u2019s attorney for comment.\n\nGuyger was later released on a $300,000 bond, according to WFAA.\n\nAdding to the already controversial case, the Dallas Police Department requested a search warrant for Jean\u2019s apartment the day after the shooting occurred. The police found 10.4 grams of marijuana. The publication of the warrant (and its findings) drew immediate backlash, and some called it a \u201csmear campaign\u201d against Jean.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pattern that we\u2019ve seen before,\u201d Lee Merritt, one of Jean\u2019s family attorneys, told WFAA. \u201cWe have a cop who clearly did something wrong. And instead of investigating the homicide \u2014 instead of going into her apartment and seeing what they can find, instead of collecting evidence relevant for the homicide investigation \u2014 they went out specifically looking for ways to tarnish the image of this young man.\u201d\n\nBy November 2018, a grand jury had upped the charge against Guyger from manslaughter to murder, and she now faces life in prison. Under a manslaughter charge, she faced 20 years in prison, according to the AP.\n\nA jury was selected in September of 2019, and opening statements began Monday.\n\nWhat could happen to Amber Guyger?\n\nGuyger, 31, is facing life in prison should a jury find her guilty of murder. If she is found not guilty of murder, she could still face lesser charges of manslaughter or criminally negligent homicide, according to The Dallas Morning News. (That she pulled the trigger and killed Jean is not in dispute.)\n\nThe jury, sequestered at the judge\u2019s request, are predominately women of color, according to the Morning News. Ten of the 12 are people of color \u2014 five are black. Eight of the jurors are women, and the four alternates are also women.\n\nWrite to Jasmine Aguilera at jasmine.aguilera@time.com.", "description": "Amber Guyger fatally shot Botham Jean in his Dallas apartment in 2018.
