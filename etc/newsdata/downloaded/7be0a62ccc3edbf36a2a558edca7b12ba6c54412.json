They have both been charged with sale of narcotic drugs, possession of narcotic drugs, possession of manufacturing equipment for narcotic drugs, possession of marijuana for sale and possession of a weapon in a drug offense -- all felonies.\n\nMaricopa County Sheriffs Office\n\nMaricopa County Sheriffs Office\n\nThe sheriff's office singled out the vape cartridges, especially in the wake of the current epidemic of illnesses in the country.\n\n\"These cartridges have been located throughout the country and have been associated with recent vaping deaths, were being manufactured in the residence,\" the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office said in a statement Wednesday announcing the arrests. \"Base (sic) on the equipment and the products located inside the residence, detectives believe this location was an apparent Closed Loop BHO Manufacturing Lab.\"\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration has specifically warned consumers against using THC-infused vaping products.\n\n\"In many cases of illness reported by the states, patients have acknowledged recent use of THC-containing vaping products while speaking to healthcare personnel, or in follow-up interviews by health department staff,\" according to an FDA release from Sept. 6.\n\nMaricopa County Sheriffs Office\n\nIn addition to the THC vaping cartridges, the pair was apparently extracting cannabis and adding it to snack food to sell. Among the products were \"Weedos,\" \"Sour Dab Kids\" and \"Weed Thins.\"\n\nPolice said they were tipped off to the drug house, and then conducted surveillance on the residence for days before getting a warrant.\n\n\"We are focused on protecting the young adults in our community,\u201d Maricopa County Sheriff Paul Penzone said. \"We will not tolerate criminal activity targeting adolescence for profit and at the expense of health.\"\n\nThe sheriff's office also seized a boat and an ATV from the residence.\n\nA vote to legalize recreational use of marijuana failed in Arizona in 2016, though users would only have been able to possess an ounce legally.
