Show Hide Here is the list of the 21 Conservative MPs who voted with the opposition and against the government on Tuesday night\u2019s motion to seize control of the parliamentary timetable in order to pave the way for a bill to block a no-deal Brexit. Guto Bebb, Aberconwy Richard Benyon, Newbury Steve Brine, Winchester Alistair Burt, North East Bedfordshire Greg Clark, Tunbridge Wells Kenneth Clarke, Rushcliffe David Gauke, South West Hertfordshire Justine Greening, Putney Dominic Grieve, Beaconsfield Sam Gyimah, East Surrey Philip Hammond, Runnymede and Weybridge Stephen Hammond, Wimbledon Richard Harrington, Watford Margot James, Stourbridge Sir Oliver Letwin, West Dorset Anne Milton, Guildford Caroline Nokes, Romsey and Southampton North Antoinette Sandbach, Eddisbury Sir Nicholas Soames, Mid Sussex Rory Stewart, Penrith and The Border Edward Vaizey, Wantage\n\n\n\nJohnson lost the vote by 328 to 301, a convincing majority of 27 for the rebels.\n\nThe PM had earlier described the legislation, drawn up by a cross-party coalition including the senior Tories Oliver Letwin and Dominic Grieve, as \u201cJeremy Corbyn\u2019s surrender bill\u201d.\n\nAfter his defeat, Johnson said he would never request the delay mandated in the rebels\u2019 bill, which he said would \u201chand control of the negotiations to the EU\u201d.\n\nIf MPs passed the bill on Wednesday, he said, \u201cthe people of this country will have to choose\u201d in an election that he would seek to schedule for 15 October.\n\nThe prime minister will need a two-thirds majority to secure a general election under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, and Jeremy Corbyn quickly made clear his party would not vote for the motion unless and until the anti no-deal bill had passed.\n\nPlay Video 0:41 MPs vote to seize control of the Commons and force vote on Brexit delay \u2013 video\n\n\u201cGet the bill through first in order to take no deal off the table,\u201d the Labour leader said.\n\nThe rebels hope to push the legislation through all its parliamentary stages by the end of the week \u2013 though they face a fierce battle in the Lords, where scores of Conservative peers are lining up to table wrecking amendments.\n\nJohnson held a series of meetings with potential rebels on Tuesday seeking to reassure them he was determined to strike a fresh Brexit deal with the EU27 and that MPs would be given plenty of time to debate and approve it.\n\nBut several Tories appear to have been emboldened rather than deterred by the threat of losing the party whip for the remainder of the parliament \u2013 and by Johnson\u2019s decision last week to suspend parliament.\n\nQ&A How does the Fixed-term Parliaments Act work? Show Hide Introduced by the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition, the act set in place five-year, fixed-term parliaments with elections to be held on the first Thursday in May in 2015, 2020, 2025 and so on.\n\nIn theory, the act makes the calling of any general election outside this term the decision of the House of Commons, not the prime minister. A vote by at least two-thirds of the Commons in favour of an early general election would formally fire the starting gun on the process \u2013 the input of the House of Lords is not required. The act also provides for an early poll if two-thirds of MPs pass a vote of no confidence in the government and no new government is formed within the following 14 days.\n\nThey expressed concerns about Johnson\u2019s failure to show any evidence of concrete progress in the negotiations with the EU27.\n\nHammond, Gauke and the former secretary of state for international development Rory Stewart were among the rebels, as was the veteran MP (and Winston Churchill\u2019s grandson) Nicholas Soames. All were later phoned in turn and told they had lost the Conservative whip.\n\nA source close to the rebels said last night: \u201cTonight\u2019s decisive result is the first step in a process to avert an undemocratic and damaging no deal. No 10 has responded by removing the whip from two former chancellors, a former lord chancellor and Winston Churchill\u2019s grandson. What has happened to the Conservative party?\u201d\n\nA number of the party\u2019s leading centrist voices, including Justine Greening, Soames and Alistair Burt, announced on Tuesday they would stand down at the next election.\n\nHammond, who less than six months ago was delivering his spring statement as chancellor, had said on Tuesday morning he was ready for the \u201cfight of a lifetime\u201d to hold his place in the Conservative party.\n\n\u201cI am going to defend my party against incomers, entryists, who are trying to turn it from a broad church to a narrow faction,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a thinly veiled swipe at the prime minister\u2019s chief strategist, Dominic Cummings, who is not a Conservative member, he said: \u201cPeople who are at the heart of this government, who are probably not even members of the Conservative party, care nothing about the future of the Conservatives and I intend to defend my party against them.\u201d\n\nThe Tory MP Phillip Lee took the more radical step of crossing the floor of the Commons to join the Liberal Democrats, removing the PM\u2019s majority just as Johnson prepared to address MPs about last week\u2019s G7 meeting.\n\nJohnson\u2019s G7 statement was just his second appearance at the dispatch box in parliament since he became prime minister in July. Addressing a raucous House of Commons, the PM claimed the motion drawn up by the cross-party coalition was \u201cwithout precedent in our history\u201d and would \u201cdestroy any chance of negotiation\u201d.\n\nHe said: \u201cThere is only one way to describe the bill: it is Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s surrender bill. That is what it is. It means running up the white flag. The bill is shameful.\n\n\u201cI want to make it clear to everybody in this house: there are no circumstances in which I will ever accept anything like it. I will never surrender the control of our negotiations in the way that the leader of the opposition is demanding.\u201d\n\nCorbyn said the measure was \u201ca last chance to stop this government riding roughshod over constitutional and democratic rights in this country, so that a cabal in Downing Street cannot crash us out without a deal, without any democratic mandate and against the majority of public opinion.\n\n\u201cThe prime minister is not winning friends in Europe; he is losing friends at home. His is a government with no mandate, no morals and, as of today, no majority,\u201d he said.\n\nLee\u2019s defection to the Lib Dems came after two moderate Tory former ministers, Justine Greening and Alistair Burt, said they would step down from parliament at the next general election.\n\nLee, in his resignation letter, said the Brexit process had transformed his \u201conce great party\u201d into \u201csomething more akin to a narrow faction\u201d.\n\nThe Guardian view on Boris Johnson\u2019s strategy: split party, divide country, win election | Editorial Read more\n\nWhile some of those MPs supporting the rebels\u2019 motion on Tuesday want to block Brexit, others would like to leave the EU with a deal.\n\nA group of Labour MPs, including Stephen Kinnock and Gloria De Piero, plan to table two amendments to Wednesday\u2019s bill, calling for the Brexit delay to be used to secure a deal \u2013 and a vote to be held on Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal agreement \u2013 including the last-ditch concessions she made shortly before she was forced to resign.\n\nUrging MPs to support the rebel motion on Tuesday, Letwin said that due to the imminent suspension of parliament, this was the final opportunity for MPs to legislate and have that legislation \u201cenforced on a reluctant government\u201d.\n\nThe West Dorset MP said Johnson\u2019s threat of a no-deal Brexit appeared to mean \u201cif they do not do what he wishes, he will throw himself into the abyss\u201d.\n\nAsked via an intervention whether the plan to delay Brexit until at least 31 January would not simply create confusion, Letwin said it was the best option on offer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s to provide the government with the time to seek to solve this problem and to enable parliament to help to resolve an issue which has proved very difficult,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t say it\u2019s easy to do by 31 January, but I\u2019m sure that it will not be done by 31 October. We are between a rock and a hard place, and in this instance the hard place is better than the rock. It is as simple as that. It\u2019s decision time.\n\n\u201cIf honourable members across the house want to prevent a no-deal exit on 31 October, they will have the opportunity to do so if, but only if they vote for this motion this evening. I hope they will do so.\u201d", "description": "MPs vote to seize control of Commons timetable in attempt to block no-deal Brexit", "authors": ["Heather Stewart", "Peter Walker", "Tom Kibasi"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/439d6504dfcc068eea9c16631f8967eaf437d7be/0_0_3189_1913/master/3189.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=226abdc7303ce89a41bc43306e6643f8"}
