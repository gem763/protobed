In the last year alone, ocean temperatures broke records, Antarctic melting reached unprecedented rates, and extreme weather swept through the US, Europe, and the Arctic.\n\nAccelerated planet-wide warming has been linked to more species extinctions, an increased number of annual heat-waves, and more frequent natural disasters like wildfires and hurricanes.\n\nAccording to the most recent report from the United Nations' International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), global temperatures will likely rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels between 2030 and 2052 if warming continues at the current rate. Staying under that threshold was the optimistic goal set in the Paris climate agreement.\n\nIf we hope to limit some of these climate change-related consequences, nations and industries must make drastic cuts \u2014 and soon \u2014 to greenhouse-gas emissions from energy production, transportation, industrial work, farming, and other sectors. An increasing number of people are demanding such action: In September, 4 million across 161 countries participated in a worldwide climate strike led by Swedish youth activist Greta Thunberg.\n\nBut if emissions continue to increase and Earth's temperature increases by more than 3 degrees Celsius, according to the IPCC , oceans would be an average of 3 feet higher by the year 2100. Those rising seas would displace 680 million people in low-lying coastal zones, along with 65 million citizens of small island states.\n\nRead More: Sea levels are projected to rise 3 feet within 80 years, according to a new UN report. Hundreds of millions of people could be displaced.\n\nEven if carbon emissions dropped to zero tomorrow, scientists say we'll still be watching human-driven climate change play out for centuries.\n\n\"There's no stopping global warming,\" Gavin Schmidt, a climate scientist and the director of NASA's Goddard Institute of Space Studies, previously told Business Insider. \"Everything that's happened so far is baked into the system.\"\n\nNow it's a matter of trying to \"save what we can save,\" according to Thunberg.\n\nHere's what the Earth could look like by 2100 in our best- and worst-case scenarios.", "description": "In the best-case scenario, the future of life on Earth looks worrisome.
