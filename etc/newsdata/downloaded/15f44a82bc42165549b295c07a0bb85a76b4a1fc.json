The turnaround is complete, we have delivered all the metrics we set ourselves.\"\n\nThe 54-year-old added: \"I am going to take some proper time out, recharge the batteries and think about what comes next.\"\n\nAnalysts at Shore Capital said he was \"the bloke that saved Tesco\".\n\nHe took the helm at a tumultuous time for the supermarket group, announcing shortly after he took over in 2014 that the retailer had been overstating its profits.\n\nThe company subsequently revealed a loss of \u00a36.4bn, the biggest-ever suffered by a UK retailer\n\nSince then Mr Lewis has set about reducing costs, with the latest of round job cuts announced in August when it said 4,500 staff in 153 Tesco Metro stores would lose their roles.\n\nHe also took on the discounters Aldi and Lidl by opening Jacks, Tesco's own discount chain.\n\n'Total surprise'\n\nMr Lewis also orchestrated Tesco's 2017 takeover of Booker, the biggest food wholesaler, in a \u00a33.7bn deal to create the \"UK's leading food business\".\n\nBernstein analyst Bruno Monteyne told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that there had been speculation about Mr Lewis' future after that deal as Booker's chief executive Charles Wilson had joined at the time.\n\n\"We're all trying to grapple exactly about the timing right now,\" said Mr Monteyne. His departure now was \"a total surprise\", he said.\n\nMr Lewis had joined five years ago \"at a very difficult moment\" for Tesco, Mr Monteyne said.\n\n\"Not only had it lost the trust of the customers, losing material market to the discounters, it ended up with an accounting fraud... internal morale broken. He really took over a broken company, and from being the most profitable retailer in Europe, suddenly had losses for the first time ever.\"\n\nAs with comedy, timing is everything in big business. Many chief executives overstay their welcome, failing to realise that the clock is always ticking; the average tenure of a FTSE 350 chief executive is 4.5 years, and coming down.\n\nDave Lewis, however, is clever enough to know that it's best to leave while the going is good.\n\nHe joined Tesco when it was in disarray and at a time of some drama. There had been a string of profits warnings, a boardroom bust-up leading to the departure of the chief executive and a nasty accounting scandal.\n\nMr Lewis moved quickly and the returns show in today's half-year results, which were rather overshadowed by Mr Lewis's departure. Sales were flat, but the operating margin hit 4%, a year before Mr Lewis said it would.\n\nThat is an achievement but Mr Lewis will know that running Tesco will not get any easier. Keeping Tesco at that level of operating margin is going to be a long, hard slog.\n\nThere will inevitably be speculation that he will return to Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer goods giant where he worked before joining Tesco.\n\nThe shares initially dipped but were trading nearly 2% higher at 243p as the results for the six months to 24 August were better than expected.\n\nOperating profit, excluding one-off items, rose by 25% at \u00a31.4bn.\n\nLike-for-like sales, which strip out revenue from new stores opened during the six months, rose 0.1% in the UK and Ireland.\n\nAt a group level, including operations in central Europe, notably Poland, and Asia, same store sales fell 0.4%.\n\nImage copyright TESCO Image caption Ken Murphy will have a \u00a31.35m salary\n\nWhen Mr Lewis joined Tesco from household goods company Unilever he was the first outsider to run the supermarket chain.\n\nSpeculation will turn to what he will do next, but Mr Lewis said: \"I'm going to step back and have a think about what I want to do next with my family. I'm 54 years old and I'm going to sit back and think where I can make the best contribution.\"\n\nHis successor, Mr Murphy, has also been hired from outside after a lengthy career with Boots, which is now part of Walgreens Boots Alliance.\n\nThe 52 year-old graduated from University College Cork and was educated at the Christian Brothers College.\n\nThe Irishman left Walgreens Boots Alliance in January 2019 when his last role was chief commercial officer, president of global brands. He remains as a consultant.\n\nBut he held a wide-range of roles, including a two year period as chief operating officer of Boots until October 2013.\n\nAt Tesco, his salary will be \u00a31.35m salary before bonuses, and his joining date has not yet been confirmed.\n\nIn-tray\n\n\"We would imagine that Mr Lewis may have been familiar with his replacement from his Unilever personal care days,\" said analysts at Shore Capital. \"Mr Murphy has big shoes to fill.\"\n\nThey expect continuity for now but when Mr Murphy does take the helm he will face a number of challenges:\n\nDeciding whether Jacks is an effective way to take on Lidl and Aldi\n\nAssessing any long-term impact of Brexit on its supply chain\n\nAdapting to the changing shopping habits of consumers\n\nConsidering the extent of the group's international business\n\nMr Allen described Mr Murphy as \"growth-orientated seasoned business leader\" and said he had been been looking for \"experience, proven leadership in international retail businesses, a strong strategic mind\"\n\nIn preparation for Brexit, Tesco said it was increasing its stock of long-life shelf products and noted that the UK imports about 50% of fresh food it needs", "description": "The chief executive said it was a \"personal\" decision as his replacement is named as Ken Murphy.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/C0B7/production/_109053394_tescoreuters.jpg"}
