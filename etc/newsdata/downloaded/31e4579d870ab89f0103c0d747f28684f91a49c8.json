It Ruined His Life.", "language": "en", "text": "The re-enactments of the show, even when they are bleak or disturbing or intimate, have a quality of distance that never lets you forget that you are watching reality at one remove; Zahedi\u2019s performances especially, even when they are \u201csad,\u201d are often comedic, playing up the absurdity of feeling. But the behind-the-scenes documentary footage is mesmerizing in a different way. It\u2019s raw and disturbing. The second season of \u201cThe Show\u201d includes footage of Zahedi and Field fighting about his direction and the script. They are cruel and nasty, as fights between couples can be. He yells at her; she taunts him and sticks out her tongue. At one point, she complains that Zahedi is being abusive. He turns to the cameraman. \u201cAre you filming this?\u201d he asks.\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, Zahedi never claims to represent people in their fullness. \u201cIt\u2019s about subtraction,\u201d he told me. In real life, we try to defuse tension, \u201clower the emotional temperature.\u201d His work erases all of those moments. \u201cIt makes it less complex and it distorts it, but it makes it stronger.\u201d\n\nIn other words, subjecting reality to art doesn\u2019t make it less real or less true. It makes it more real and more true.\n\nIt\u2019s never a difficult matter, in a magazine article, to make someone look bad. Not unlike \u201cThe Show\u201d itself, a magazine article involves including some details and leaving out others in order to create a story line. But I became aware, the more time I spent with Zahedi and the people from \u201cThe Show,\u201d that it would be unusually easy to vilify him. This is a man who has used his wife\u2019s mother\u2019s suicide as material. A man who feeds actors lines and sometimes hectors and even bullies them until he gets exactly the intonation and emphasis he wants. (Zahedi doesn\u2019t allow actors to work up to a moment; all he cares about is the moment itself.) He surrounds himself with fans who work free, doesn\u2019t hear \u201cno\u201d until it has been screamed a hundred times and declares anyone who isn\u2019t sacrificing themselves to his vision to be an enemy of art.\n\nAt some time in the past \u2014 50 years ago, two years ago \u2014 it might have been possible to watch \u201cThe Show\u201d and agree with Richard Linklater when he said that Zahedi\u2019s \u201cbody of work at the end of the day will be like a lengthy Walt Whitman poem. ... It will be one of the greatest poems ever written, because it applies to everybody.\u201d Zahedi wants to be an example, to inspire others to reveal themselves as he does. But the culture is no longer inclined to universalize the lives of male artists, especially when those autobiographies use as material the lives of the women around them. This just isn\u2019t a great time for male geniuses.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, there\u2019s Ashley. I\u2019m not going to say too much about Ashley, because she wishes she never agreed to be in \u201cThe Show.\u201d (She asked me not to use her last name in this article.) She started as a fan who helped out on set. Then, during a period when Zahedi and Field were experimenting with an open marriage, Ashley dated him. She participated in Season 2 for a while, re-enacting the relationship \u2014 she comes across as sweet and sympathetic \u2014 but eventually she quit, so Zahedi replaced her with two actors (one to do the kissing scenes). Performing events that she felt badly about in the first place, and participating in the flattening of her life for the sake of a narrow and distorted story line, was a bad experience. \u201cThe thing that was alluring about this project was the idea of the truth,\u201d she told me. \u201cThen you get on set and you realize that it\u2019s not the truth, but it\u2019s Caveh\u2019s truth.\u201d She met Zahedi when she was 24. All in all, the experience has made her \u201cmore guarded and less trusting.\u201d\n\nAshley looked miserable. I told Ashley my version of the truth: that I don\u2019t think she looks unsympathetic in the show, that people are more likely to judge Zahedi, not her. She bristled. \u201cI\u2019m not the victim here, and I\u2019m not going to allow myself be turned into a victim,\u201d she said. She thinks that art is worth whatever pain it causes in the world, even the pain it caused her. Field threatened to sue over the show, but Ashley refuses to stand in its way. When Zahedi dies, he will leave behind a complete document of his life \u2014 not her life, but his life. That\u2019s the goal of art, she said, her voice catching a little: to tell other people what it feels like to be alive.", "description": "Caveh Zahedi\u2019s abject, self-defeating, ethically questionable, maddeningly original approach to documentary.", "authors": ["Christine"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/03/magazine/03mag-zahedi/03mag-zahedi-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
