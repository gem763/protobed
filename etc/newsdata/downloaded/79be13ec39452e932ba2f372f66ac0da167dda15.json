Stewart: The Truth About the \u2018Deep State,\u2019 Donald Trump, and Jeffrey Epstein", "language": "en", "text": "Early in his career covering the financial industry, law enforcement and the unsightly pageant of American politics, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist James B. Stewart spent quality time with both Hillary Clinton during her husband\u2019s first term in the 1990s and Donald Trump in the late 1980s.\n\nOne was an activist first lady who, like Bill Clinton, was bitterly resentful of media scrutiny and had hoped to enlist Stewart\u2014a best-selling author whose just-published 10th book is Deep State: Trump, The FBI, and The Rule of Law\u2014to expose the rank unfairness of the press coverage of the Clintons and certify their probity and honesty.\n\nThe other was an outer-borough apartment building scion who was trying to recast himself as a high-flying corporate raider and wanted Stewart, then a Wall Street Journal reporter, to validate his status and acumen.\n\nNeither the Clintons nor Trump succeeded.\n\nStephen Colbert Mocks Trump Administration\u2019s \u2018Deep State\u2019 Paranoia\n\n\u201cHe invited me up to Trump Tower and said, \u2018This is completely off the record, deep background,\u2019\u201d Stewart told The Daily Beast. \u201cAnd then we\u2019re sitting there and the secretary walked in and said \u2018Mrs. So-and-so is here.\u2019 And Trump says, \u2018Show her in\u2019\u2014so much for being deep background, off-the-record. And so she walked in and he said, \u2018This is Mrs. So-and-so\u2019\u2014I don\u2019t remember her name, but she was from the Philippines\u2014\u2018and she is the richest woman in the world.\u2019 And I thought, \u2018Ohhh, interesting, I never heard of her. I thought the Queen was the richest woman in the world.\u2019\n\n\u201cAnd then he turned to her and said, \u2018James Stewart from the Wall Street Journal is here interviewing me. He is the most famous reporter in America.\u2019 At which point I knew she was not the richest woman in the world,\u201d Stewart recalled, adding he found the future president \u201ccharming and funny in kind of a mean way,\u201d but that he politely declined Trump\u2019s offers of a free flight on the Trump Shuttle, his money-losing airline that was soon to go under, a ride to La Guardia airport in his limo and, later on, persistent invitations to prize fights in Atlantic City.\n\n\u201cHe was always trying to get me to take something,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cFortunately, I had no interest in boxing. I had no interest in gambling.\u201d\n\nThe dapperly dressed Stewart, who happened to be celebrating his 68th birthday, was holding forth in a midtown Manhattan coffee emporium across the street from the New York Times, where he has been a star on the Business section since 2011.\n\nHe said he was currently toiling on an investigative report concerning the late Jeffrey Epstein, the plutocrat-pedophile whom Stewart visited at his Upper East Side mansion in August 2018. Stewart refused to provide details on his research or when he hopes to publish.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s at a delicate stage,\u201d he said.\n\nIn August, after Epstein was found hanged in his jail cell, apparently by his own hand, Stewart wrote a controversial column about their off-the-record encounter. At the time Stewart explained that he\u2019d met with Epstein because he was trying to ascertain if rumors were true that Tesla tycoon Elon Musk had asked the convicted sex offender to represent him in his search for a new CEO, and concluded that there was no credible evidence for that.\n\nStewart wrote that he declined Epstein\u2019s offer to cooperate with a book-length biography, and also spurned Epstein\u2019s invitation to have dinner with him, Michael Wolff and Woody Allen. Stewart told The Daily Beast that such an encounter would have been journalistically useless, to say nothing of the unattractive optics.\n\n\u201cHow creepy is that?\u201d he scoffed.\n\nStewart won\u2019t say precisely who cooperated with his latest book, beyond on-the-record interviews with fired FBI Director James Comey and, surprisingly, Steve Bannon\u2014who makes a cameo appearance to mock the \u201cDeep State\u201d conspiracy theory, embraced by Trump, that a cabal of faceless government bureaucrats are staging a secret coup against the duly elected president.\n\nThe \u201cdeep state conspiracy theory is for nut cases,\u201d Stewart approvingly quotes Bannon. \u201cAmerica isn\u2019t Turkey or Egypt,\u201d Bannon says, adding that while there\u2019s an entrenched bureaucracy, \u201cthere\u2019s nothing \u2018deep\u2019 about it. It\u2019s right in your face.\u201d\n\nComey, meanwhile, tells Stewart: \u201cThere\u2019s no Deep State looking to bring down elected officials and political leaders that represents a deep-seated center of power\u2026 But it\u2019s true in a way that should cause Americans to sleep better at night. There\u2019s a culture in the military, in the intelligence agencies, and in law enforcement that\u2019s rooted in the rule of law and reverence for the Constitution.\u201d", "description": "Photo Illustration by Lyne Lucien/The Daily Beast/GettyEarly in his career covering the financial industry, law enforcement and the unsightly pageant of American politics, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist James B.
