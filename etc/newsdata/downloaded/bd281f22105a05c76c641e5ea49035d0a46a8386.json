During the course of the debate the prime minister used the word \u201csurrender\u201d 13 times and said: \u201cWe will not betray the people who sent us here.\u201d\n\nPM branded a disgrace after he says best way to honour Jo Cox is to deliver Brexit Read more\n\nMany MPs picked up on Johnson\u2019s language, saying it was irresponsible and unfitting. And the prime minister appeared to point-blank refuse to go to Brussels to get an article 50 extension if there was no deal by the end of October, as now required by law. Here are some of the key exchanges.\n\nOn the prime minister\u2019s language\n\nPaula Sherriff (Labour, Dewsbury): \u201cI genuinely do not seek to stifle robust debate, but this evening the prime minister has continually used pejorative language to describe an act of parliament passed by this house. And I\u2019m sure you would agree, Mr Speaker, that we should not resort to using offensive, dangerous or inflammatory language for legislation that we do not like.\n\n\u201cAnd we stand here, Mr Speaker, under the shield of our departed friend [the murdered MP Jo Cox] with many of us in this place subject to death threats and abuse every single day. And let me tell the prime minister that they often quote his words, \u2018surrender\u2019, \u2018betrayal\u2019, \u2018traitor\u2019, and I for one am sick of it. And it has to come from the prime minister first. So I would be interested in hearing his opinion, he should be absolutely ashamed of himself.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The MP Paula Sherriff said the PM should not resort to using \u2018offensive, dangerous or inflammatory language\u2019 to describe legislation he did not like. Photograph: HO/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBoris Johnson (prime minister, Conservative, Uxbridge and South Ruislip): \u201cI think Mr Speaker, I have to tell you Mr Speaker, I have to say Mr Speaker, that I have never heard so much humbug in my life.\u201d\n\nOn honouring Jo Cox\u2019s memory\n\nTracy Brabin (Labour, Batley and Spen \u2013 Jo Cox\u2019s former constituency): \u201cHearing from the prime minister, words like \u2018the humiliation act\u2019, \u2018the surrender act\u2019, the capitulation act\u2019, all of these words are suggesting that because we disagree with him we are traitors, we are not patriots. Nothing could be further from the truth. Now, this may be a strategy to set the people against the establishment. I would like to gently suggest that he is the establishment and we are still people. As the woman who has taken over a seat that was left by our dear friend Jo Cox, can I ask him, in all honesty, as a human being, going forward, will he moderate his language so that we will all feel secure when going about our jobs.\u201d\n\nBoris Johnson: \u201cCan I say that the surest fire way \u2026 I think the \u2026 Of course there will be an attempt to obfuscate the effect of this act, but it does \u2026 the capitulation act or the surrender act, or whatever you want to call it. It does, it does, I\u2019m sorry but it greatly enfeebles this government\u2019s ability to negotiate. But what I will say is the best way to honour the memory and indeed the best way to bring this country together would be, I think, to get Brexit done.\u201d\n\nOn populist rhetoric\n\nCaroline Lucas (Green, Brighton Pavillion): \u201cThe tone of the prime minister\u2019s speech was truly shocking, and if he recognises that tensions are inflamed, it is up to him not to stoke them further by whipping up hatred, treating parliament with contempt and dividing our country still further. This populist rhetoric is not only unfitting for a prime minister; it is genuinely and seriously dangerous.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Referring to the murdered MP Jo Cox, Paula Sherriff said many MPs were subjected to death threats and abuse every day.

How despicable that, when he refers to members of this house who are doing their duty to protect our constituents, he uses language such as \u2018surrender\u2019. That language is not suitable for the prime minister of any country.\u201d\n\nOn MPs\u2019 families receiving death threats\n\nAnna Soubry (Independent Group for Change, Broxtowe): \u201cOn a point of order, Mr Speaker, I, too, am very sad that the prime minister has left, because I had hoped to raise this point of order to give him the opportunity to perhaps correct the record and reflect on his language and conduct in this house tonight. It gives me no pleasure to say that I am 62, I have been around and I have seen quite a lot of stuff in my life. It takes a lot to reduce this honourable member to tears. I am not alone tonight; there are others who I believe have left the estate, such has been their distress.\n\n\u201cI merely say to everybody in this place, but most notably to those who hold the highest of offices in this the most peculiar and extraordinary of political times, that the language that is used is incredibly important. Whatever side of the debate people are on, we have evidence that when they use words such as \u2018surrender\u2019 or \u2018capitulation\u2019, or others use the words \u2018traitor\u2019 and \u2018treason\u2019, there is a direct consequence. It means my mother receives a threat to her safety. It means my partner receives a death threat.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson, said she had reported a death threat against her child to the police. Photograph: BBC\n\nJo Swinson (Liberal Democrat leader, East Dunbartonshire): \u201cI fear that the public watching today will perhaps take the view that this house does not take sufficiently seriously threats of violence. Earlier today, we had the attorney general joke about wife beating. When asked whether they would bring forward the domestic abuse bill now that parliament has resumed, we had the government dismiss those requests, and we have had the comments that were made by the honourable member for Dewsbury [Paula Sherriff] recalling Jo Cox MP and the threats that MPs face on a daily basis \u2013 I may add that, today, I have reported to the police a threat against my child \u2013 and that was dismissed as humbug. This is a disgraceful state of affairs, and we must be able to find a way to conduct ourselves better.\u201d\n\nOn the distress caused to Jo Cox\u2019s family\n\nLucy Powell (Labour, Manchester Central): \u201cOn a point of order, Mr Speaker. I know that some of these points have been made already, but I just wanted to remind the house that Jo\u2019s murder did not happen in a vacuum. It happened in a context \u2013 a context that is not dissimilar to the context we find ourselves in today. I have heard from Jo\u2019s family this evening, and they have been very distressed by watching this place today. I know others have said it, but it has come from one side of the house: the language of \u2018surrender\u2019, of \u2018betrayal\u2019 and of \u2018capitulation\u2019. This is the kind of language and the context that led to the murder of an MP leaving her surgery of an evening in a small market town by somebody from the far right, and we cannot forget that context when we conduct ourselves. I just wanted to put that on the record.\u201d\n\nBoris Johnson urged to calm Commons 'inferno of rhetoric' Read more\n\nJohn Bercow (Speaker): \u201cThat point is duly noted. It is a very serious point. I do not want to add to it, but suffice it to say that although I do not know the Cox family anything \u200blike as well as the honourable lady or many other members here present, I do know members of the family. I have a strong empathy with the objectives of the Jo Cox Foundation, and indeed I am in touch with the family from time to time, including currently in relation to upcoming events, so I am not unsighted on the issues. I do not think any of us in this chamber will ever forget or entirely overcome our horror, revulsion and distress at what happened to a wonderful human being and the most dedicated of public servants. She was murdered for what she believed, for the values she held, and for her effectiveness in campaigning for them. We do not in any circumstances ever want to witness a repeat of that.\u201d\n\nOn seeking an extension to article 50\n\nIan Murray (Labour, Edinburgh South): \u201cThe problem that the prime minister has is that nobody in this house trusts him. He has been asked five times this evening if he would abide by all the provisions of the European Union [Withdrawal] [No. 2] Act, and he refuses to answer the question. So for the sixth and final time: if he does not get a deal or a no deal through this house by 19 October, will he seek an extension to 31 January from the European Union?\u201d\n\nBoris Johnson: \u201cNo.\u201d", "description": "Boris Johnson accused of using dangerous language in Wednesday\u2019s session", "authors": ["Martin Belam"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47b32bb0de1c485a57d3a3778ddd286ca5e1bcc3/404_9_2943_1766/master/2943.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=32860f5441cb32426cd0584c073c0d3a", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
