As things heated up in Santiago, however, protesters nearly 700 miles north locked down roadways in the Atacama salt flats, blocking access routes to some of the region\u2019s abundant lithium mines.\n\nAlso on rt.com Protesters in Chile reject reform proposal, face water cannon & tear gas as unrest continues (VIDEO, PHOTOS)\n\nChile is home to the world\u2019s largest lithium reserves, as well as one of the top producers of the lightweight metal \u2013 used in cell phone batteries and other electronics \u2013 the Chemical and Mining Society (SQM).\n\nThe effort to close the roads has been underway since Wednesday, Sergio Cubillos, president of the Atacama Indigenous Council, told Reuters, adding that SQM\u2019s operations were \u201ccompletely shut down\u201d by Friday.\n\nThe roads are closed.\n\nA Santiago-based spokeswoman for SQM told Reuters she had so far been unable to obtain confirmation about the halt in operations.\n\nCubillos also said that the blockades disrupted the work of US-based lithium company Albemarle. However, a company representative denied that its facilities had been affected, acknowledging only minor upsets due to nationwide disruptions in the country\u2019s public transportation system.\n\nAlso on rt.com \u2018We are at war!\u2019 Chile extends curfew, 1,000s of soldiers patrol streets as death toll in violent riots mounts (PHOTOS, VIDEOS)\n\nAs tens of thousands poured into Santiago and cities across Chile on Friday, chanting slogans and waving national flags, the police and military presence remained sizable. However, while rallies throughout the week were marked by eruptions of violence, Friday\u2019s gathering appeared to avoid major clashes, with both protesters and security forces showing more restraint.\n\nIf you don't speak spanish, I want you to know that today was the biggest march of Chile. 1.5 million people in the streets of Santiago protesting against all the injustice of the so called \"paradise\" of the neoliberal system #LaMarchaMasGrandeDeChile#ChileViolatesHumanRights\u064bpic.twitter.com/tyeynNypia \u2014 isis (@callmeisisxfi) October 26, 2019\n\nPresident Sebastian Pinera proposed a series of reforms on Tuesday night \u2013 which included lowered electricity costs and overturning the increase in transportation fees that sparked the rallies \u2013 but was largely rejected by the burgeoning protest movement, which apparently did not find the promises persuasive.\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
