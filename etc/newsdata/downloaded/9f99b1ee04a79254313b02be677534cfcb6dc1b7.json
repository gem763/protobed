The young woman is seemingly set to find a little bit of happiness with newcomer Luke (Max Parker) \u2014 that is, unless Luke turns out to be dangerous, which a lot of viewers believe him to be.\n\nVictoria\u2019s world came crashing down earlier this year when, after a night out with her pals, she was raped by Lee. After the police were unable to bring a case against the rapist, Robert (Ryan Hawley) set about seeking revenge on her behalf, and ended up getting himself arrested and charged with GBH with intent.\n\nMatters were made worse earlier this week when Lee died from his injuries, which led to Robert having to go on the run with husband Aaron (Danny Miller). As a result, Victoria has lost her brother too, and \u2014 with a baby on the way \u2014 she\u2019s got a lot on her plate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite her stresses, she could be set to find happiness, as it recently became apparent that there was chemistry between her and Luke \u2014 a man whom she met at the hospital last month.\n\nDuring last night\u2019s episode, the pair went for lunch \u2014 and they got along incredibly well. Yes, Luke certainly seems like a nice lad on the surface \u2014 and it\u2019s nice to see Victoria getting on with her life after all that\u2019s been through.\n\nThe question is: could there perhaps be more to Luke than meets the eye?\n\nWhen the pair first met, Victoria was convinced that Luke was up to no good, which \u2014 considering everything that she\u2019s been through, was more than justified \u2014 but, upon dicussing the matter further with Diane (Elizabeth Estensen), she came to the realisation that there was nothing to fear from this young man.\n\nHowever, what if Luke is, in fact, dangerous? The character has accidentally bumped into Victoria on several occasions \u2014 something which he acknowledged during their second meeting \u2014 so could her perhaps be stalking her?\n\nSince his first appearance at the hospital, some viewers have made clear on social media that they believe Luke\u2019s linked to Lee, which \u2014 considering Victoria has only encountered Luke on hospital grounds when she\u2019s been checking up on how Lee\u2019s doing \u2014 is rather plausible.\n\nLet\u2019s not forget that it was a trip to the hospital which led to Victoria encountering Lee\u2019s mum Wendy, so it\u2019s entirely possible that history would repeat itself where Luke is concerned. If Luke is mates with Lee, then it would explain these \u2018chance\u2019 encounters, for sure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat\u2019s more, before Robert hit him with the shovel, Lee relayed how the rape trial had negatively impacted his reputation, so perhaps \u2014 in an attempt to seek revenge \u2014 he roped his mate into a plan to target Victoria? It\u2019s certainly something he\u2019d be capable of, given everything he\u2019s already put Vic through.\n\nIf so, then the aim could be to get close to Victoria. However, the question is: is he simply be looking revenge, or is it the baby he\u2019s after?\n\nLuke demonstrated a certain degree of shock when he realised that Vic was pregnant during last night\u2019s episode, but could he perhaps have been feigning such a reaction in order to give a more convincing performance?\n\nRegardless of what his motivations might be, If Luke is operating on behalf of Lee, then he\u2019ll no doubt up his game now that Lee has died.\n\nOr maybe we\u2019re jumping the gun and Luke\u2019s just a nice guy?\n\nLet\u2019s hope it\u2019s the latter, as if anyone deserves to be happy, it\u2019s Victoria. Mind you, few people find happiness in the Dales, so whatever happens with Luke, there\u2019ll no doubt be plenty more conflict to come.\n\nEmmerdale continues on Wednesday 16th October at 7pm on ITV.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Victoria's new love interest appears to be nice on the surface \u2014 but could Luke perhaps have a darker, sinister side?", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/is-victoria-in-danger-from-luke-in-emmerdale_1571231956.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
