That period ended this week, and the foreign secretary, Marcelo Ebrard, is to meet with US officials on Tuesday.\n\nOn Friday, Ebrard said that the number of migrants apprehended at the US-Mexico border in August was 63,989, down from 144,266 in May.\n\nMigrants brave the 'Beast' as Mexico cracks down under US pressure Read more\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re showing that the strategy that Mexico put forward has been successful,\u201d Ebrard said. \u201cI don\u2019t expect a tariff threat Tuesday because it wouldn\u2019t make sense.\u201d\n\nMexico has reinforced security on its porous southern border and set up checkpoints on highways leading north, deploying 21,600 police and troops across the nation. Ebrard said there had been seven formal complaints of human rights violations involving the national guard.\n\nAndr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, the leftist president who took office on 1 December promising better treatment of migrants, has embraced the crackdown.\n\nIn recent weeks, he has seldom mentioned the US pressure and depicts the crackdown as a struggle to defend Mexican laws, claiming that migrant caravans were the work of human traffickers.\n\nMigrant rights activists say L\u00f3pez Obrador is simply dressing up the fact that he yielded to Trump\u2019s pressure tactics.\n\n\u201cMexico is just trying to comply with the US [demands] and cut down on migration, but it is improvising and violating the law,\u201d said Javier Mart\u00ednez, a lawyer for the Casa del Migrante shelter in the northern city of Saltillo. \u201cWe are seeing things we never saw before.\u201d\n\nMexico has raided freight trains that migrants ride north, and pulled thousands off buses and out of the freight compartments of trucks. The government has warned bus and taxi drivers they could lose their permits if they transport migrants.\n\nMexico's migration crackdown escalates dangers for Central Americans Read more\n\nActivists say that crackdowns by Mexican authorities force migrants to hike through unpopulated areas to avoid checkpoints, exposing them to greater risk from thieves, muggers and rapists who lie in wait.\n\nEbrard said on Friday that authorities had found 2,186 migrants inside 35 tractor trailers and said that nearly 40% were minors. Ebrard said 357 people had been charged in migrant-smuggling cases.\n\nThe Rev Alejandro Solalinde, who runs a migrant shelter in the southern state of Oaxaca, said Mexico essentially had no choice.\n\n\u201cIt was the least worse choice,\u201d Solalinde said of the government\u2019s decision. \u201cGiven that Donald Trump is an unstable person, full of surprises, we had to make this deal.\u201d", "description": "Country has cracked down on migration after Donald Trump threatened in May to slap tariffs on Mexican imports", "authors": ["Staff", "Agencies In Mexico City"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c60d921ac54d6ac8209c5ce53bccc7820188e887/0_44_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=afe344de0d800eb255c5346e1af8dea1", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
