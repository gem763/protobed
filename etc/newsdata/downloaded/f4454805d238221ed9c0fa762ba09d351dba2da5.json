It\u2019s a dumpster fire,\u201d Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) said at a Senate Banking Committee hearing on the White House\u2019s proposal to overhaul the way the nation finances mortgages.\n\n\u201cWe spent $190 billion of taxpayer money, and we\u2019re in worse shape,\u201d he said, referring to the bailout of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which were seized by Treasury a decade ago to stave off catastrophic losses in the crisis.\n\nThe hearing kicked off what promises to be a highly contentious debate over the plans released last week by the Departments of Treasury and Housing and Urban Development to scale back the federal government\u2019s massive role in the mortgage market. Republicans are focusing on what they say are growing risks in the system, while Democrats are mostly concerned about providing affordable housing.\n\nThe Treasury blueprint would overhaul Fannie and Freddie before releasing them from government control. A major component of the plan is building the companies\u2019 capital so they would be able to withstand an economic downturn without turning to taxpayers again.\n\nRight now, the companies are only allowed to retain a combined $6 billion in capital despite owning or guaranteeing $5.5 trillion of mortgages.\n\n\u201cI will tell you as a safety-and-soundness regulator, when I look at a $3 trillion institution that is leveraged 1,000 to 1, it keeps me up at night,\u201d Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Mark Calabria, the companies\u2019 regulator, told the committee.\n\n\u201cIf we do nothing, this is going to end very badly,\u201d he added.\n\nMorning Money Political intelligence on Washington and Wall Street \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

Before 2008, he said, the companies held 45 cents in capital for every $100 in mortgages; today that figure is 19 cents.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, HUD Secretary Ben Carson and Calabria all agreed with Crapo\u2019s assessment that the GSEs \u201care systemically important companies [and] that they continue to be too big to fail.\u201d\n\nYet when Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) pressed Mnuchin and Calabria on whether the Financial Stability Oversight Council, the uber regulator created after the crisis to spot emerging risks in the financial system, should subject Fannie and Freddie to greater oversight, they rejected the idea.\n\n\u201cBefore we raised public capital, we would make sure we understood that there was enough capital so that they did not need to be designated\u201d as \"systemically important\" by FSOC, Mnuchin said.\n\n\u201cIt appears to me from your administrative proposals, we could end up with a system that actually doesn\u2019t end too-big-to-fail and doesn\u2019t increase affordable access to credit \u2014 that is a grave concern to me,\u201d Warner said. The administration\u2019s plan, he said, is \u201cgoing to put us right back to where we were prior to 2008.\u201d\n\nMnuchin disputed Warner\u2019s characterization, and he and Calabria emphasized that the White House plan includes reforms to reduce the risk in the companies\u2019 portfolios.\n\nAs it stands, underwriting standards at Fannie and Freddie have \u201cgotten worse, not better,\u201d Calabria said, pointing to a \u201cmassive expansion\u201d of loans with high debt-to-income ratios in recent years.\n\n\u201cWhat you\u2019re describing today sounds even more dangerous than the conditions that we had prior to the last crisis,\u201d Sen. Martha McSally (R-Ariz.) said. \u201cHow is it that reforms haven\u2019t been made in order to prevent us being in similar conditions?\u201d\n\nCarson said reforms at the Federal Housing Administration have brought down delinquency rates.\n\nEfforts to reduce risk, though, would inevitably result in fewer people getting mortgages \u2014 a point Democrats on the committee made repeatedly.\n\nWhen Sen. Jack Reed (D-R.I.) pressed the officials to identify people who would not be able to get mortgages under the plan, Mnuchin said \u201cthere may be certain people today who really shouldn\u2019t get a mortgage because they can\u2019t afford them.\u201d\n\nCarson agreed.\n\n\u201cCertainly there are some people who probably should not be mortgage owners \u2014 in many cases very disabled people, elderly people, people who are drug-addicted, who are not going to be able to make the payments,\u201d Carson said. \u201cWe have other programs for individuals like that.\"", "description": "Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are way too undercapitalized, and lending standards have actually deteriorated since the housing crash, the officials said.", "authors": ["Katy O'Donnell"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/77/33/3799452d4bb0a0eb67aa7dc6666e/20190910-john-kennedy-hearing-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
