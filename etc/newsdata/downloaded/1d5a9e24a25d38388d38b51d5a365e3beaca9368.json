Here's What We Know So Far", "language": "en", "text": "Black Friday will be here before you know it, and we are sure you\u2019re dying to find out all about the best Black Friday deals and Cyber Monday discounts that Amazon, Walmart, Target, and the rest of the major retailers will have this year.\n\nBlack Friday used to mean heading out to the mall on the day after Thanksgiving, perhaps before the sun even came up. Then, \u201cBlack Friday\u201d shifted, with stores opening and deals launching in the hours after Thanksgiving dinner. Now, it very well can mean browsing through endless deals at Amazon days or even weeks before and after it\u2019s actually Black Friday (Friday, November 29, this year). Or sitting on your sofa in sweatpants in a turkey coma on Thanksgiving Day and scrolling through all the Black Friday deals on your phone.\n\nAmazon.com is probably the single biggest contributor to that sea change in the way people shop for Black Friday deals. Over the past few years, Amazon also has been one of the driving forces pushing Black Friday from a single shopping day to a weeks-long retail bonanza, with virtual doorbusters covering nearly every category: There are Amazon Black Friday phone deals, tablet deals, TV and audio electronics, home goods, gaming consoles and accessories, and more. Amazon also uses the retail tentpole as another opportunity to push its Amazon Prime subscription service.\n\nWe\u2019re still filling in the gaps on the details of Amazon\u2019s best Black Friday deals, so we\u2019ll be updating this post frequently (and similar stories focused on Walmart and Target) as soon as we hear about new deals (protip: bookmark this page!) Here\u2019s everything we know \u2014 or feel comfortable predicting \u2014 so far.\n\nWhen Does Amazon Announce Black Friday Deals?\n\nWhenever they want, because they\u2019re Amazon. Seriously, though, Amazon teased its first batch of deals a full week ahead of Black Friday last year. Since Black Friday 2019 is November 29, this means we can expect to start seeing Amazon Black Friday deals announced around November 21 or 22.\n\nAmazon Echo Show 8 | Courtesy of Amazon More\n\nWe can all but guarantee there will be deals on Amazon devices before, during, and after Black Friday. Deal experts predict Black Friday discounts of up to 60% off on Ring doorbells, Fire tablets, Echo smart speakers, Kindle e-readers, Echo earbuds, and other Amazon tech.\n\nWhen Do Amazon Black Friday Deals Start?\n\nThe idea that Black Friday lasts a mere day is behind the times. Amazon Black Friday deals were available from mid-November through the end of the week after Thanksgiving, so it\u2019s reasonable to assume Amazon will launch its deals on a similar time frame this year.\n\nHow Long Will Amazon Black Friday Deals Last?\n\nThis is kind of a trick question. For all practical purposes, Amazon Black Friday deals last until they sell out \u2014 which, if history is any guide, they will.\n\nStill wondering when do Amazon Black Friday deals end? OK, here\u2019s our best estimate, based on last year\u2019s dates: Black Friday deals tend to bleed into Cyber Monday deals, so we\u2019re predicting sales will run all the way through December 8, the Sunday after Cyber Monday.\n\nAmazon Black Friday Electronics Deals\n\nAmazon uses the holiday shopping season to heavily promote its own devices. It has been expanding its lineup of Echo devices, so we\u2019ll probably see lots of deals on those.", "description": "Look for huge discounts on TVs, tablets, and more.", "authors": ["Martha C.
