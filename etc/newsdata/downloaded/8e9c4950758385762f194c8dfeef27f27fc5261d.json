It\u2019s the recipe that most would consider a healthy, balanced diet to keep us trim right up until our 90s. Government guidelines recommend exactly this approach for all British adults.\n\nYet, a growing number of dietary experts passionately disagree.\n\nThe British Association for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (BAPEN) says this guidance neglects the most important factor when it comes to healthy eating \u2013 our age.\n\nEarlier this month, a Mail on Sunday investigation revealed the shocking scale of malnutrition in the UK, with over-65s at risk of starving to death. Dieticians warned that the Government\u2019s focus on eating less could be partly to blame.\n\n\u2018The advice fails to recognise that the nutritional requirements of a frail 80-year-old is very different to a 30-year-old,\u2019 says Dr Trevor Smith, of BAPEN.\n\n\u2018What constitutes a healthy diet varies depending on the stage of life you are at. The advice around nutrition should vary for different age groups.\u2019\n\nTeenagers, menopausal women, and thirtysomethings trying to conceive also have specific dietary requirements. It is vital information that could even help you live longer. So how do you know what to eat, when? Here, dieticians and health experts provide the answers.\n\nTeenagers, menopausal women, and thirtysomethings trying to conceive also have specific dietary requirements.

In late adolescence and during university, carbohydrates \u2013 made up of sugars, starches and fibres \u2013 are a vital source of energy.\n\n\u2018Your brain needs about 120g of carbohydrates daily to work properly,\u2019 says dietician Catherine Collins. \u2018This is easily met with a bowl of porridge and two slices of bread at lunch. Carbs like oats, wholemeal bread and sweet potatoes sustain energy for longer.\u2019\n\nStudies show those with diets high in slow-releasing carbohydrates have a reduced risk of obesity and heart conditions in later life.\n\nTRY THIS: Add a handful of noodles to a chicken and vegetable stir fry.\n\nStudies show those with diets high in slow-releasing carbohydrates have a reduced risk of obesity and heart conditions in later life\n\nDitch dairy-free diet\n\nThere are almost 250,000 vegan teenagers in the UK who avoid all animal products for the sake of the environment. But dodging dairy raises the risk of bone-wasting condition osteoporosis in later life.\n\nDairy products such as milk, cheese and yogurt are vital sources of calcium, which protect bones from damage. As adolescence is the peak time for bone development, under-19s are advised to consume 100mg more calcium than the rest of us.\n\n\u2018Bone density increases in adolescence and peaks in our late-20s,\u2019 says Collins. \u2018A lack of calcium during these years means bone strength may never reach its full potential, increasing the risk of early osteoporosis. You\u2019ll get the recommended daily dose of 800mg in one small pot of yogurt, a glass of milk and a small piece of cheese.\u2019\n\nTRY THIS: Grate two teaspoons of parmesan cheese over meals for an extra calcium boost.\n\nDespite the trend, cutting carbs is not always a healthy choice. In late adolescence and during university, carbohydrates \u2013 made up of sugars, starches and fibres \u2013 are a vital source of energy. Add noodles to a stir-fry (left) for brain fuel. Dairy products such as milk, cheese and yogurt are vital sources of calcium, which protect bones from damage\n\nTeens should eat steak\n\nRed meat has been vilified in recent years, with reports linking meat-heavy diets to some cancers.\n\nBut for youngsters \u2013 especially young women \u2013 the odd steak is important for brain, blood, lung and muscle health. Red meat is the richest source of the mineral iron, essential for transporting oxygen around the body. With the start of girls\u2019 menstrual cycles, and a sudden loss of iron in blood, teenage girls become at risk of deficiency. In late teens, the amount of iron the body needs dramatically increases \u2013 almost doubling to 14.8mg daily in girls.\n\nTRY THIS: Steak, or beef, minced or stewed for dinner a couple of nights weekly.\n\nAsparagus and broccoli for a baby\n\nMost British women have their first child at 29 years old. And would-be mums ought to be aware of a B-vitamin called folate, found in leaf-green vegetables, and essential for the formation of DNA. Deficiency in pregnancy can increase the risk of health problems in the growing baby.\n\nWhile those actively trying for a baby are encouraged to take a precautionary supplement, experts say a folate-heavy diet is a good idea \u2013 in case you\u2019re caught by surprise. \u2018The damage is often done by the time they find out they\u2019re pregnant,\u2019 says registered nutritionist Angela Dowden. \u2018A folate-rich diet, is a good insurance policy.\u2019\n\nTRY THIS: Stock up on folate-rich broccoli and asparagus. Opt for folate-fortified sliced bread and breakfast cereals.\n\nFor youngsters \u2013 especially young women \u2013 the odd steak is important for brain, blood, lung and muscle health. Those actively trying for a baby are encouraged to take a precautionary supplement, experts say a folate-heavy diet is a good idea. Stock up on folate-rich broccoli and asparagus\n\n36-65 years old\n\nFull-fat isn\u2019t banned\n\nSlowing metabolism and depleting hormones mean, in midlife, the health odds become stacked against us. Testosterone and oestrogen dip, hindering fat-burning. Weight gain between 45 and 60 years is specifically linked to higher mortality, according to a recent analysis. But this doesn\u2019t mean a low-fat diet. \u2018Many high-fat foods are high in calories, but all fatty foods should not be eliminated,\u2019 says dietician Cherry Hagger.\n\nIn fact, some types of fat have even been shown in studies to protect against heart disease, cognitive decline and keep us fuller for longer. \u2018Salmon or other fatty fish a few times a week, a handful of nuts and olive oil with meals are good choices,\u2019 says Hagger. It\u2019s the calorific fatty foods \u2013 pies, and pastries \u2013 that should be limited. \u2018Rather than banning foods, just cut down on portions a bit,\u2019 Hagger says.\n\nTRY THIS: Dip bread in olive oil instead of slathering with butter.\n\nEat plenty of potatoes\n\nBowel cancer is on the rise with 42,000 people newly diagnosed every year. Eating more of one nutrient could dramatically decrease your risk.\n\nFibre \u2013 found mainly in starchy carbohydrates such as wholemeal bread and pasta, oats and potatoes \u2013 could reduce the risk of the disease by up to a fifth. The nutrient is essential for digestion. High fibre intake is also associated with healthy blood sugar levels, decreasing the risk of obesity-related illness and type 2 diabetes, according to studies. \u2018A baked sweet or white potato including the skin contains almost a fifth of your daily fibre intake,\u2019 advises Collins.\n\nTRY THIS: Two spoons of porridge oats in your morning cereal.\n\n\u2018A baked sweet or white potato including the skin contains almost a fifth of your daily fibre intake,\u2019 advises Catherine Collins\n\nAn omelette boosts mood\n\nSelenium, found in eggs, nuts and shop-bought bread, boasts surprising health benefits for the middle-aged.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s essential for hormonal functions,\u2019 says Hagger. \u2018Some studies have found it is also linked to mood.\u2019 Other studies show that high intake may even be protective against the most common form of male cancer.\n\nIn a 2012 analysis of 13,000 men by the World Cancer Research Fund, those with high bodily concentrations of selenium were less likely to develop prostate cancer. Selenium is said to protect against cell and tissue damage, which may halt the development of tumours. Recommended daily intake is 75 micrograms for men, and 60 for women.\n\nTRY THIS: An omelette made with three eggs for a hearty breakfast.\n\nCheese is good for bones\n\nMany may have been put off cheese recently, following reports that regularly consuming dairy products could make men up to 72 per cent more likely to develop prostate cancer.\n\nBut the study was \u2018too weak\u2019 to be trusted, according to experts. The US team failed to account for other factors that influence cancer risk, such as being overweight or not physically active. And eating dairy is essential for bones health as we age.\n\n\u2018Calcium in dairy products such as cheese and milk protects our bones from age-related damage,\u2019 says Hagger. It\u2019s especially important for post-menopausal women.\n\n\u2018When bone-boosting oestrogen dips, women need twice as much calcium.\u2019\n\nTRY THIS: Eat some dairy every meal \u2013 crumble feta on salads.\n\nSelenium, found in eggs, nuts and shop-bought bread, boasts surprising health benefits for the middle-aged\n\n66 and beyond\n\nEat more protein\n\nProtein isn\u2019t just for the gym-obsessed. Older people should also boost their intake for healthy muscles. Found in meat, fish, cheese and baked beans, it is essential for growth and repair in the body.\n\nAgeing bodies process it less efficiently, so those over 65 need to consume more. Collins recommends at least 20g \u2013 the equivalent of a good-sized chicken breast or salmon fillet twice daily.\n\nTRY THIS: Top a jacket spud with protein-packed baked beans\n\nProtein isn\u2019t just for the gym-obsessed. Older people should also boost their intake for healthy muscles. Found in meat, fish, cheese and baked beans, it is essential for growth and repair in the body\n\nOily fish twice a week\n\nAlmost half of Europeans over 75 are deficient in Vitamin D \u2013 essential for the immune system, brain connectivity and helping bones absorb calcium.\n\nMost Vitamin D is synthesised in the skin via interaction with sunlight, but as we age, the skin becomes less efficient at producing it.\n\nStudies show that older adults spend less time outdoors, meaning they are even more at risk of deficiency.\n\nGet a boost from either oily fish such as one salmon fillet twice weekly, or a supplement, all year round.\n\nTRY THIS: Don\u2019t like salmon? Give sardines on toast a go.\n\nAlmost half of Europeans over 75 are deficient in Vitamin D \u2013 essential for the immune system, brain connectivity and helping bones absorb calcium. Get a boost from either oily fish such as one salmon fillet twice weekly, or a supplement, all year round\n\nStart to limit portions\n\nBeing over 70 dramatically increases the risk of type 2 diabetes, heart disease and dementia.\n\nThese conditions are more likely if you\u2019re one of the third of older Britons who are obese. \u2018It\u2019s fine to have some snacks, but eat smaller portions,\u2019 Collins says. \u2018Enjoy a takeaway as a treat, but don\u2019t get the naan and poppadoms, too.\u2019\n\nTRY THIS: Cut cakes into six slices rather than four.\n\nPuds if you\u2019re underweight\n\nOne-in-ten over-65s are underweight according to BAPEN. Muscle and bone mass rapidly deplete after the age of 60, making older adults at increased risk of falls and fractures.\n\nAge UK dietician Kiristine Farrer says: \u2018Eat puddings with custard or ice cream, use full-fat milk in cereal and spreads like peanut butter or cream cheese on crumpets. Snacking helps if three big meals are overwhelming.\u2019\n\nTRY THIS: Drink milkshakes if chewing is painful.\n\nMince for the blood cells\n\nOne-in-five over 60-year-olds are deficient in vitamin B12, essential for blood cells and nerve function. With age, our body is less able to absorb the mineral \u2013 found in red meat such a liver as well as milk and cheese.\n\nA daily dose of one egg, a large portion of cheese or a small portion of minced beef is enough.\n\nTRY THIS: Spread liver pate on toast for a B12-heavy lunch.", "description": "The British Association for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (BAPEN) says UK Government guidance neglects the most important factor when it comes to healthy eating - our age.", "authors": ["Anjana Gosai", "Eve Simmons For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/26/18/20218178-0-image-a-68_1572109737975.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
