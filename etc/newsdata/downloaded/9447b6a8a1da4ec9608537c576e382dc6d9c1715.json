Turnout in the dark damp polling day from students and older voters is difficult to predict. I know that the representation of the people act and the obligation on broadcasters to offer meticulously unbiased coverage will give extra profile to the smaller parties including, especially, the Brexit Party. And we\u2019ve not ever had an election like this, at a time like this, on in issue like this, ever.\n\nAll to play for, then? Maybe. It is certainly what that clucking idiot Jeremy Corbyn thinks \u2013 \u201cWe're going out there to fight an election campaign, and I can't wait\u201d. Jeremy Corbyn says Labour MPs are ready to back a general election \u2013 \u201cThis is the end of the debate, and we're going out there to win\u201d. With more (selfish) justification, it is also what these other clucking imbeciles, Jo Swinson and the SNP, believe. They\u2019ll probably do \u201cwell\u201d, increasing their representation in the House of Commons and, in the SNP\u2019s case, adding to pressure for a second Scottish independence referendum. But they will also bring upon themselves and the rest of us five years \u2013 or more \u2013 of Boris Johnson doing what the hell he wants with an overall Commons majority.\n\nBy Christmas Day, Britain will be well on the way to a hard Brexit. The Labour party will have fallen into another of its post-election defeat civil wars, and the Tories can get one with delivering the long-delayed Thatcher Fourth Term \u2013 liberalising and deregulating the country to create the lusted-after Singapore on Sea, a no-deal Brexit, if needed, and with no interference from parliament or the EU commissioners along the way. God, Johnson could be in until 2029!\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

The \"moderates\" will stand down or be purged. It\u2019s over for the welfare state.\n\nThe Johnson family, friends, cronies and hangers on will able to enjoy an exceptionally festive champagne break at Chequers like no other.

Everyone knows the only reason Labour backed it was because the Tories were going to win the vote on a snap election anyway \u2013 thanks to the Liberal Democrats and the SNP. They had a choice of looking cowardly or pretending they are \u201cup for it\u201d. Labour carries, therefore, less of the blame. Still, it is a terrible mistake by most of the opposition parties, and a wonderful gift for Boris Jonson. Only Carline Lucas of the Greens talks much sense publicly. She knows the planet won\u2019t be a winner either.\n\nYet the single salient fact in this election is the 12-point opinion poll lead the Conservatives enjoy over the Labour Party. Even with everything that has changed, British general elections are still basically won and lost in Labour-Conservative marginal seats, many in the Midlands, Lancashire and Yorkshire. The rest is quite distracting noise.\n\nFarage and Swinson will be able to tear chunks out of the two major parties, and the SNP and Plaid Cymru can do the same with more potency in Scotland and Wales. But mostly the smaller party insurgencies will take place in safer Lab/Con seats, and not enough. The net result will probably be a net swing compared to the 2017 election from Labour to the Conservatives. Johnson will win about 5 per cent less of the vote than Theresa May, say, but Corbyn will lose about half of the votes he won so impressively in 2017 \u2013 about 15 percentage points down. That adds up to a very a large swing indeed in historical terms.\n\nIt is also possible that Labour could actually go backwards in the 2019 general election campaign, as a similarly beleaguered Labour Party did in the 1983 general election, the previous low point, at 27 per cent or so of the popular vote. Corbyn's Labour, in other words, could plunge to its lowest vote share since 1918, when they got about 20 per cent. They are certainly divided and confused enough to make fools of themselves, though I freely admit the Tories have more than their share of clowns too. The \u201cconstructive ambiguity\u201d on Brexit that served them so well in 2017 will not work again; and recent real-world electoral tests suggest that it just alienates both sides of the argument.\n\nThe closer the Tories get to 40 per cent, and the closer Labour slumps to 20 per cent, the more chance Johnson will win big in parliamentary seats \u2013 beating David Cameron and John Major\u2019s previous modest majorities (of 12 in 2015 and 22 in 1992 respectively).\n\nIt is all something of a tragedy. In her many defences of her bold, i.e. foolhardy, move, Swinson argues that the votes in a parliament sadly aren\u2019t there for a second referendum, and there never will be unless (obviously) the Commons is suddenly flooded with liberal Democrats. Not on 18 per cent of the vote, it won\u2019t.\n\nThe point is that the opposition parties have and had Boris Johnson exactly where they needed him \u2013 caged. Labour and the Lib Dems could have played hardball with Johnson. They could have said that they would nod through his Withdrawal Agreement Bill \u2013 conditional on a confirmatory vote through a Final Say referendum. Eventually he would have caved, because he always does; Boris will sell anyone out, even himself, to stay in power. We\u2019ve seen that a lot. Instead, the turkeys have gifted him a snap election, an election on his own agenda, and the project of remaking Britain in his own image.\n\nI can only repeat the words of Neil Kinnock in the final desperate moments of the 1983 election as the Tories headed for a landslide, which were prophetic. I make no apology for quoting them in their full, chilling, form, and challenge anyone to say it better now:\n\n\u201cIf Margaret Thatcher is re-elected as prime minister on Thursday, I warn you.\n\nI warn you that you will have pain \u2013 when healing and relief depend upon payment.\n\n\u201cI warn you that you will have ignorance \u2013 when talents are untended and wits are wasted, when learning is a privilege and not a right.\n\n\u201cI warn you that you will have poverty \u2013 when pensions slip and benefits are whittled away by a government that won\u2019t pay in an economy that can\u2019t pay.\n\n\u201cI warn you that you will be cold \u2013 when fuel charges are used as a tax system that the rich don\u2019t notice and the poor can\u2019t afford.\n\n\u201cI warn you that you must not expect work \u2013 when many cannot spend, more will not be able to earn. When they don\u2019t earn, they don\u2019t spend.
