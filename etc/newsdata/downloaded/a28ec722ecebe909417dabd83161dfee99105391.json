A copy of the letter was uploaded to text storage site Pastebin and posted at tech news website The Verge.\n\n'Over the past several days we received credible information, from the Hong Kong Cybersecurity and Technology Crime Bureau, as well as from users in Hong Kong, that the app was being used maliciously to target individual officers for violence and to victimize individuals and property where no police are present,' the email read.\n\n'This use put the app in violation of Hong Kong law. Similarly, widespread abuse clearly violates our App Store guidelines barring personal harm.'\n\nApple did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe makers of HKmap.live have countered that the app gathers information from users, social networks and news outlets to show where police have gathered, not where they aren't.\n\nPeople attend a flash mob rally to show support for pro-democracy protesters in the Central district in Hong Kong on Friday.
