We are European.\n\n\"But after 45 years of really dramatic constitutional change, we must have a new relationship with the EU.\"\n\nThis speech was hugely important for Boris Johnson's Brexit deal.\n\nBe in no doubt that amongst those listening most closely, most intently, will be leaders in other European capitals, trying to gauge whether Mr Johnson is serious about a Brexit deal or whether he is paving the way for no-deal and looking to blame the EU.\n\nThis was actually a rather surprising speech because there was none of the aggressive, combative language that we had been expecting - none of the in your face, take it or leave it final offer that we were told would form the guts of his argument.\n\nInstead, it seemed Mr Johnson went out of his way to adopt a rather more emollient approach, saying how much he loved Europe, how the Tory Party wasn't an anti-European party and how Britain wasn't an anti-European country.\n\nWhat that meant was that Mr Johnson didn't endeavour to bring the house down in the conference hall. He didn't go for the easy Brussels bashing, and for the wider viewers in this country, there were no brand new policy announcements.\n\nYou sense Mr Johnson has calculated for the next few hours and days that the really crucial audience in terms of his premiership, and for his future, is not here in Manchester - it's in capitals around the EU.\n\nWhat does the EU think?\n\nImage copyright Reuters\n\nBefore Mr Johnson's speech, a European Commission spokeswoman said they would examine the proposals objectively, adding: \"We will listen carefully to the UK.\"\n\nShe said the EU wanted to agree a deal with the UK, saying \"an orderly withdrawal is far more preferable than a 'no-deal' scenario\".\n\nBut the spokeswoman also reminded the UK of its \"well-known criteria\", saying: \"In order for there to be a deal, we must have a legally operational solution that meets all the objectives of the backstop.\n\n\"[That means] preventing a hard border, preserving North-South cooperation and the all-island economy, and protecting the EU's Single Market and Ireland's place in it.\"\n\nThe BBC's Europe editor, Katya Adler said the bloc wanted to do a deal and needed to be seen to try.\n\nBut she added it was \"fundamentally misunderstanding the EU\" if the prime minister believed the other 26 EU leaders will turn round to Ireland and say they have to accept the proposals just they want to have a deal.\n\nWhat has been the reaction to his plans?\n\nImage copyright PA Media\n\nThere were huge rounds of applause for Mr Johnson from within the conference hall, showing support from his party.\n\nAfter the speech, one member said the PM was \"exactly what we need\", while another said she had been \"inspired\", adding: \"We are so fed up with nothing happening, but we feel like something will happen now because we think he will deliver.\"\n\nLeaving the hall, Tory MP Mims Davies described her leader as \"bombastic Boris\", saying: \"That [speech] was a message to the country, a message to our party and a message to the EU - we are ready to get on with this.\"\n\nBut the PM's plan has been branded as \"extreme\" and \"doomed to failure\" by the SNP's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, who said his strategy was leading towards a no-deal.\n\nShadow chancellor John McDonnell said the prime minister's speech was \"absolute bluster\" and he described it as a \"cynical manipulation to get a no-deal\".\n\nMr McDonnell also that any Brexit deal or no-deal should be put to the people to make the final decision.\n\nThe director general of the CBI, Dame Carolyn Fairbairn, praised the PM's \"optimistic vision for the UK\".\n\nBut she said his plan \"relies on a good Brexit deal\".\n\n\"The UK is at a crossroads,\" she said. \"[And] the no-deal turning ends in a very different place: a swamp that will slow the UK's every step for years to come.\"\n\nWhat else did Mr Johnson say in his speech?\n\nImage copyright PA Media\n\nThe PM also used the opportunity to criticise Parliament, saying it \"refuses to deliver Brexit, refuses to do anything constructive and refuses to have an election\".\n\nHe said: \"I am afraid that after three and a half years people are beginning to feel that they are being taken for fools.\"\n\nMr Johnson said the Tories were \"the party of the NHS\" because of their belief in capitalism, adding: \"We understand the vital symmetry at the heart of the modern British economy between a dynamic enterprise culture and great public services precisely because we are the party of capitalism.\"\n\nHe praised London as its former mayor, but pledged to \"unlock talent in every corner of the UK\", and ensure safety with his existing policies of 20,000 additional police officers and tackling county lines gangs.\n\nAnd he repeated more policy announcements from the conference on infrastructure, education, law and order.\n\nMr Johnson concluded: \"Let's get on with sensible moderate one nation but tax-cutting Tory government and, figuratively if not literally, let us send Jeremy Corbyn into orbit where he belongs.\n\n\"Let's get Brexit done [and] let's bring our country together.\"\n\nMr Johnson's conference speech clashed with Prime Minister's Questions, which started at 12.00 BST.\n\nNormally the Commons goes into recess for the Tory conference, but MPs voted against this amid the bitter fallout from the government's unlawful prorogation of Parliament.\n\nForeign Secretary Dominic Raab deputised for the prime minister, facing the shadow home secretary Diane Abbott over the despatch box.\n\nHe told MPs the government will present its written Brexit proposals to them later today.", "description": "Addressing his party conference in Manchester, the PM says his offer to the EU offers compromise on both sides.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07pw1g4.jpg"}
