I can\u2019t even begin to tell you how sad that is.\u201d\n\nWith an impeachment inquiry underway in the House, the risks of breaking ranks with the president are higher than ever. Mr. Trump prides himself on punching back against perceived enemies, publicly suggesting that \u201cspies\u201d and \u201ctraitors\u201d and people who turn \u201crat\u201d deserve to have their lives and their families destroyed. Small wonder that few congressional Republicans have dared express even gentle concern over Mr. Trump\u2019s increasingly erratic behavior.\n\nBut still the patriots come. Top of the list, of course, is the still-anonymous whistle-blower who touched off the impeachment drama by registering his concerns about Mr. Trump\u2019s clandestine effort to pressure Ukraine into conducting investigations that would benefit his re-election campaign. The concerns enumerated in the complaint have since been verified and magnified by multiple administration insiders, despite the White House\u2019s stonewalling mandate.\n\nOn Monday, Congress heard from Ms. Hill, the former top national security adviser on Russia and Europe , who detailed how Mr. Trump had done an end run around his own national security team, putting Ukraine policy in the hands of unqualified dilettantes like Gordon Sondland, whose $1 million donation to the Trump inaugural basically bought him the title of ambassador to the European Union, and Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer and favorite henchman.", "description": "Let us now praise these not-silent heroes.", "authors": ["Michelle Cottle"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/21/opinion/21deepstate/21deepstate-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
