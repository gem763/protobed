From the very first shot to its last, it\u2019s a show that doesn\u2019t waste a single moment, each episode serving a vital role in the story. And it\u2019s this consistency that has allowed for some of the most memorable episodes in television. But it\u2019s also the reason why my personal favourite and perhaps one of the show\u2019s greatest episodes doesn\u2019t get the spotlight it deserves. And it\u2019s not an episode with a major character death or a bombastic action sequence, but an episode about nothing.\n\nThe episode that I\u2019m referring to is the 10th episode of season three, \u201cFly.\u201d It\u2019s also perhaps the series\u2019 most polarising episode, some hailing it as one of the show\u2019s greatest, while heavily despised by others. The plot is simple. Walt discovers that a fly has entered his lab and becomes obsessed to get rid of it, while his partner, Jesse, tries to argue against this unreasonable obsession.\n\nJesse: Hey, what happened to your head?\n\nWalt: Nothing, I\u2019m fine.\n\nJesse: You didn\u2019t hit it really hard?\n\nWalt: My head is not the problem, Jesse. The fly is the problem.\n\nNate: That\u2019s it. There are no subplots or big action sequences. What we see is just these two characters in a lab trying to catch a fly. Consider the fact that the episode dropped right in the middle of a season progressing at an otherwise breakneck speed, and it\u2019s easy to see why many weren\u2019t so happy with it. A part of it, I think, has to do with what the episode is: what\u2019s known in the industry as a bottle episode.\n\n\u201cOuter Limits\u201d narrator: You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to the outer limits.\n\nNate: First coined by the creator of the \u201960s TV series \u201cThe Outer Limits,\u201d bottle episodes refer to episodes that could be produced cheaply by restricting the number of actors and locations. Although it\u2019s been around for some time, the series that really broke new ground was none other than \u201cSeinfeld,\u201d in the episode \u201cChinese Restaurant,\u201d where the entire plot revolves around Jerry and his friends just waiting for a table at a restaurant.\n\nHost: It will be five, 10 minutes.\n\nNate: NBC initially refused the episode, arguing that there was no real story to keep viewers engaged. It was only after Larry David threatened to quit the show that the episode was approved and went on to become one of the most critically acclaimed episodes in the entire series. It was even used as a joke in the later season.\n\nGeorge: Oh, forget the story.\n\nJerry: You gotta have a story.\n\nGeorge: Who says you gotta have a story? Remember when we were waiting for that table in that Chinese restaurant that time? That could be a TV show.\n\nNate: Since then, bottle episodes have popped up everywhere, sometimes as a creative tool.\n\nJeff: Tell your disappointment to suck it. I\u2019m doing a bottle episode.\n\nNate: And in the case of the \u201cFly,\u201d due to the budget. Nearing the end of the season, the series was hopelessly over budget, and showrunner Vince Gilligan and the writers were forced to come up with an episode set in one location to save the cost of moving their production trucks, hence the story of two characters trying to catch a fly. What\u2019s ironic is that the criticism against the episode is justified. The episode is really about nothing. It doesn\u2019t move the plot forward in any way, and despite everything that happens, nothing is ever changed or resolved by the end.\n\nTo understand the purpose of the episode, I think it\u2019s important to understand what influenced it. From Percy Bysshe Shelley, whose sonnets inspired the episode \u201cOzymandias,\u201d to Walt Whitman, whose work served as a major plot device, \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d is chock-full of both cultural and literary references.\n\nJesse: Place is full of dead-eyed douchebags, the hours suck, and nobody knows what\u2019s going on, so.\n\nGroup leader: Sounds kind of Kafkaesque.\n\nJesse: Yeah. Totally Kafkaesque.\n\nNate: While \u201cFly\u201d borrows from several different materials, the most prominent is \u201cWaiting for Godot\u201d by legendary playwright Samuel Beckett, a play about two men, Vladimir and Estragon, waiting for an individual named Godot, but we never find out who Godot is, and, spoiler alert, Godot never arrives. Instead, the play is really about the various philosophical contemplations the two share over the absurdity of their situation. \u201cFly\u201d and \u201cWaiting for Godot\u201d share this similar absurdist tone. Like \u201cGodot,\u201d the story is never about the fly but the two men, Walter and Jesse, trying to find meaning in it. And, similar to how the identity of Godot has been the subject of debate for many years, the fly is also capable of many different interpretations, from Walt\u2019s guilt for the death of Jesse\u2019s girlfriend to the loss of control over his own operation from Gus Fring\u2019s influence.\n\nWhat Vince Gilligan and the writers receive in return for the lack of bombastic action and an almost glacial pacing is a moment to explore these two characters, something as simple as how the two approach a problem. Walt uses what he knows, his knowledge in science and logic, to solve a problem.\n\nJesse: What positive? Positive what?\n\nWalt: Pressure. I\u2019ve turned the ventilation up to keep the outside out.\n\nNate: And when it doesn\u2019t work, he begins to seek out needlessly dangerous and riskier methods, while Jesse acts almost instinctively without putting much thought, reluctantly helping Walt without fully understanding the danger, their stark difference in character resulting in a constant state of conflict we will see repeat again and again. In fact, the entire plot is designed to show their toxic relationship, the two unable to accomplish a simple common goal without hurting one another, and the issue is only finally resolved when Jesse is left to work on his own, Walt unable to see the end of the chain of events he himself has caused, all of which will come back to haunt the two throughout the rest of the series.\n\nJesse: Just tell me you don\u2019t give a s\u2014 about me, and it\u2019s either this\u2026 it\u2019s either this, or you\u2019ll kill me the same way you killed Mike.\n\nNate: And their dialogue in the episode reveals a lot about how the two perceive one another. We get not one but two of what I think are some of the greatest monologues in the series, one from Jesse about his aunt who hallucinates an opossum in her house from the cancer that has metastasized to her brain.\n\nJesse: But it was good that that was when we decided to, you know, take her to the doctor \u2019cause then we knew what was up. You know, got her some treatment, meds so she wasn\u2019t stressing all the time. It was a lot better after that. She was a lot happier.\n\nNate: Jesse\u2019s story is one inspired by his concern for Walt, being the only one in the room to see the fly as a manifestation of something else, while Walter\u2019s monologue is that of something entirely different: his regrets.\n\nJesse: Perfect moment, for what? To drop dead? What, you are saying you want to die?\n\nWalt: I\u2019m saying\u2026I\u2019ve lived too long.\n\nNate: It\u2019s brilliant writing that shows what the two characters desire from one another. For Jesse, it is a sense of connection, and for Walt, a chance at redemption.\n\nWalt: I\u2019m sorry about Jane.\n\nNate: The writers of \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d accomplish all of this with just a fly. In fact, you can actually see the entire plot of this series in just this one episode. Walt\u2019s personal obsession getting Jesse reluctantly involved, leading to a series of dangerous decisions, and throughout, we see Jesse\u2019s many emotions towards him ranging from frustration, anger, and eventually resentment. Walt eventually realises how much he has hurt Jesse and attempts to come to terms with it, but in the end, nothing is resolved, everyone more damaged than when they began. \u201cFly\u201d is an episode that, in a lot of ways, embodies the genius of \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d: its ability to take a simple concept to discuss something much greater than itself, an example that shows that great television can be achieved without the need for big character moments or bombastic action sequences, but a focus on the story it tries to tell and an understanding that sometimes what seems like nothing could, in fact, be about everything.\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
