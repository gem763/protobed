Stocks edged modestly higher, the US dollar rose and futures bets on future rate reductions were pared.\n\n\"This is what the markets expected. It's very straight forward,\" said former Fed board member Frederic Mishkin, who added that he would have voted with the dissenters, against the latest cut.\n\nOn the positive side of the ledger, the Fed noted that America's labour market \"remains strong\" and that economic \"activity has been rising at a moderate rate\".\n\n\"Job gains have been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low.\"\n\n\"Although household spending has been rising at a strong pace, business fixed investment and exports remain weak.\"\n\n\"On a 12-month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy are running below 2 per cent.\n\n\"Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe decision to cut was not unanimous with Esther George and Eric Rosengren voting to hold the key policy rate steady. They have opposed all three Fed rate cuts this year as unnecessary.\n\nWith stocks at or close to record levels in the US, the latest rate cut forms a striking test for investors and policy makers over the question of whether ever-lower borrowing costs can continue to drive valuations.\n\nAt the same time, unemployment is near a 50-year low, inflation is moderate, and data earlier on Wednesday showed gross domestic product hasn't slowed as fast as many economists and some Fed officials feared.\n\nThat said, there are still some signs of weakness, particularly manufacturing, which has contracted as the global economy slowed. Businesses have pared investment in response to the US-China trade war that both raised tariffs on many goods, and also made the world a riskier place to make long-term commitments.\n\nWhile that has not had an obvious impact yet on US hiring or consumer spending, Fed officials felt a round of \"insurance\" rate cuts was appropriate to guard against a worse outcome. The Fed cut rates in July and again in September, and by doing so hoped to encourage businesses and consumers with more affordable borrowing costs.\n\nwith Reuters", "description": "The cut was made \"in light of the implications of global developments for the economic outlook as well as muted inflation pressures\".", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/630a06db25244795c28d054cb0756d452c714a09", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
