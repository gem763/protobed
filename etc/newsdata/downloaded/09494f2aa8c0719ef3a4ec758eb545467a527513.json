We knew nothing about it for so long.\n\n\u2018We were oblivious and it is just sick. I do wonder how many other children on the website are actually the victims.\n\n\u2018There could be so many other families out there like us. I am scared to death of putting any photos online now.\u2019\n\nOliver, now nine, was pictured alongside the photos of hundreds of other young children who have been the apparent victims of child abuse.\n\nBut Oliver\u2019s photographs were lifted from Facebook weeks after Jodie uploaded them in 2014.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey were used to illustrate the story of Riley Alston, who is not a relation, who was starved by his parents Justin and Brittany Alston. The abusive pair, both 21, were jailed in June 2014 for their atrocious crimes.\n\nJodie, who has four children with husband Gary, has called the discovery \u2018sick\u2019 (Picture: Jodie Alston /SWNS.COM)\n\nOne of the Alston\u2019s four children shares a name with an abused child (Picture:: Jodie Alston /SWNS.COM)\n\nJodie stumbled upon the images on Google after searching for results on her own son Riley, who is a budding footballer.\n\nShe said: \u2018I have never ever Googled my children before but I was just interested.\n\n\u2018I just couldn\u2019t believe Oliver\u2019s photo was being used about an actual child abuse case.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s terrifying to think someone has used such an innocent photo in this way. It has scared me to death.\u2019\n\nShe and husband Gary, 43, tried to contact the website directly to demand the photo be taken down but got no reply for weeks.\n\nInstead, Jodie managed to get the photos removed after contacting WordPress \u2013 the website host \u2013 directly.\n\nThe blog had a Facebook page where it posted its photos and articles until becoming inactive in February 2016.\n\nMrs Alston has urged other parents to check their online privacy settings (Picture: Jodie Alston /SWNS.COM)\n\nShe says she was \u2018scared to death\u2019 that innocent photos of her children ended up being used for a different purpose (Picture: Jodie Alston /SWNS.COM)\n\nPhotos of Oliver are still featured on that page, which features more than 3,100 pictures of children, despite his mum\u2019s efforts to contact Facebook to ask for the photos to be removed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJodie said: \u2018I have reported it to Facebook but have heard nothing back at all.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s a huge invasion of privacy. It makes you realise how careful you have to be with what you post online.\u2019\n\nShe added that she had posted countless photos of her family online since 2014 but has since removed all photos of Oliver, nine, Riley, eight, Archie, four and Orla-Mae, three \u2013 from social media and has now made her Facebook account private.\n\nShe urged other parents to be cautious about what they post online and to check their privacy settings.\n\nMetro.co.uk has contacted Lighting Their Way Home for comment.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
