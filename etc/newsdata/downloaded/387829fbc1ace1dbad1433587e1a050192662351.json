He also suggested the people involved had been \"spying\" and threatened \"big consequences\".\n\nThe administration suffered a week of damaging developments that included Trump publicly calling on Ukraine and China to investigate Biden and his son - echoing Democrats' accusation that the president was leveraging his power to target a political opponent.\n\nHouse impeachment investigators have subpoenaed the White House for documents on efforts by Mr Trump and his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, to pressure Ukraine into opening a probe of the Bidens.\n\n\"The evidence of wrongdoing by Donald Trump is hiding in plain sight,\" Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, who is part of the House Democratic leadership, said Sunday on ABC's \"This Week\".\n\n\"The president's own words in the public domain has indicated that he doesn't think there's any problem in soliciting foreign interference.\"\n\n'Deep state'\n\nMr Trump claims that Mr Biden improperly helped his son Hunter profit from business deals in Ukraine and China. The allegations related to Ukraine have been discredited, and those related to China aren't supported by publicly known details. Mr Biden's 2020 presidential campaign has dismissed the allegations as without merit.\n\nThe existence of a potential second whistle-blower, who may have more direct knowledge of Mr Trump's interactions with Ukraine, was first reported Friday by the New York Times.\n\nMr Trump responded in a tweet on Saturday, saying the \"Deep State\" is \"going to the bench\" for reinforcements.\n\nSenator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said the whistle-blowers - whose identities are protected by law - should be interviewed in public and under oath, suggesting that he would subpoena them if necessary.\n\n\"I'm going to insist upon that the whistle-blower - one or two, whatever - they come forward, under oath, so the public can judge their credibility,\" Ms Graham said on Fox News's \"Sunday Morning Futures\".\n\nOne of Mr Trump's staunchest Republican allies, Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, declined on Sunday to defend Mr Trump's suggestion, made to reporters outside the White House, that China investigate the Bidens. The president wasn't being serious, Mr Jordan said.\n\nJust kidding?\n\n\"I don't think he really meant go investigate\" and nobody \"really believes that the president of the United States thinks China's going to investigate,\" Mr Jordan said. \"I think he's getting the press all spun up on all of this.\"\n\nMr Biden, whose status as the 2020 Democratic front-runner has slipped as Mr Trump and other Republicans look to flip the narrative on Ukraine, pushed back late Saturday. In a Washington Post opinion piece, Mr Biden said Mr Trump is pushing \"debunked conspiracy theories and smears against me and my family.\"\n\n\"I will put the integrity of my whole career in public service to this nation up against Mr Trump's lack of integrity any day of the week,\" Mr Biden wrote. \"It all comes down to the abuse of power. That is the defining characteristic of the Trump presidency.\n\nBLOOMBERG", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Government & Economy - [WASHINGTON] The lead attorney representing a US intelligence official who came forward with a complaint against Donald Trump says his firm is now representing \"multiple whistle-blowers\" in connection with the matter, a new twist in the impeachment inquiry of the president. .
