This decision is of immediate effect,\" she wrote on Twitter.\n\nBerlin and Paris join fellow European countries the Netherlands, Norway, and Finland in their blockade, with the latter stating that the arms export ban concerned not only Turkey but also any other country involved in the fighting.\n\nTurkey launched its military operation into northern Syria on Wednesday, days after the US announced that it was pulling troops from the area.\n\nAnkara argues the offensive against the Western-backed, Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) \u2014 which is affiliated to Kurdish groups Turkey recognises as terror organisations \u2014 will allow the creation of a \"safe zone\" along its border where the more than three million Syrian refugees it currently hosts will be able to relocate.\n\nBut Western countries, including the European Union, the US, and Australia, have condemned the military operation, warning that it could have dangerous consequences.\n\nFrance and Germany were the third and fourth-largest arms exporters in the world between 2014 and 2018, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). The Netherlands, Norway and Finland were in 10th, 14th and 24th position respectively.\n\nTurkey, meanwhile, was ranked as the world's 13th biggest arms importer with most 60% of its imports originating from the US, followed by Spain (17%) and Italy (15%).\n\nMadrid and Rome have, for now, not taken similar decisions but EU leaders who will gather for a summit on October 17-18 in Brussels are expected to discuss a bloc-wide arms embargo to Turkey.\n\nThis article was corrected after it erroneously said Denmark had also stopped arms exports to Turkey.", "description": "Berlin and Paris join fellow European countries Norway, Denmark and Finland in their blockade, with the latter stating that the arms export ban concerned not only Turkey but also any other country involved in the fighting.", "authors": ["Alice Tidey"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/22/55/30/1000x563_cmsv2_51ba1f1e-90a8-5994-811c-d95da42cdd7b-4225530.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
