As of September 30, Sony has shipped 102.8 million PlayStation 4 consoles, surpassing even the Nintendo Wii.\n\nSony announced the news in its most recent financial statements, revealing that 2.8 PlayStation 4s were moved in the last quarter. Twitter user ZhugeEX has been tracking the data, so you can see how the global console shipment stack up.\n\nRemember these are sell-in numbers and not the sell-through ones. The PS4's lifetime sales were 91.6 million as of December 31, 2018.\n\nHere is a look at cumulative global console shipments for key platforms, launch aligned. The PS4 surpassed 100m faster than the PS2, Wii and PS1 and is now tracking alongside PS2. Will likely end around 120m+, higher than all home consoles except PS2 which sold just under 160m. pic.twitter.com/IEU4NX93X9 \u2014 Daniel Ahmad (@ZhugeEX) October 30, 2019\n\nThe PS4 is the blue line, the Wii is the red one, and the PS2 is the black one.
