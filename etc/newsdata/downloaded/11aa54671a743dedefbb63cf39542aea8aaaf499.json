The IG report shows that Comey had significant advance preparation time when testifying.\n\n\u201cWell, when you look at the manipulation of the intelligence or lying to the FISA court for political purposes you now know the evidence that we have is that Comey wasn't going to brief the president just to get him up to speed. He was acting as if he was an agent working for the 'Crossfire Hurricane' team,\u201d he said.\n\nOBAMA-ERA OFFICIALS CLAPPER, BRENNAN DEFEND COMEY IN WAKE OF IG REPORT\n\n\u201cSo, that is clear evidence that he was involved in this where before he's tried to pretend that he's like a step or two away from what happened\u2026Well the IG report really makes clear that that's not the case when you read through 80 pages,\u201d said Nunes.\n\nOn Monday, Senator Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told Smith that Comey \u201cignored all the rules and procedures in place to get an outcome he desired\u201d and that he wanted the president to be investigated.\n\n\u201cHe took the rules and procedures in his own hands to get an outcome. The rules be damned,\u201d Graham stated.\n\nOn Tuesday morning the president took to Twitter label the Russia investigation a \u201cgiant and illegal SCAM.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nNunes concluded he believes Comey and his team ran the \u201centire\u201d Russia probe under \u201cso-called counter-intelligence because you can go to secret courts.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know \u2026 really the question that we need to have answered is\u2026how did they get to decide what was classified or not classified? I think that's a very important question.\u201d", "description": "Congressman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., said Tuesday that former FBI Director James Comey is not in the clear yet following the release of the inspector general's report last week.", "authors": ["Julia Musto", "Julia Musto Works With Fox News Channel'S", "America'S Newsroom."], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/09/03/694940094001_6082970787001_6082974287001-vs.jpg"}
