When Beto O\u2019Rourke was running for the Senate, he had to walk a tight line. He still needed to appeal to his out-of-state donors who generally abhor guns, but he still needed to win votes in the Lone Star State. It\u2019s not an easy way to go and, as we now know, O\u2019Rourke wasn\u2019t successful in his bid. Did he fail to walk that line well enough? It\u2019s hard to say, though I suspect that might have played a role.\n\nNow that he\u2019s running for president, though, he doesn\u2019t need to worry too much about the opinions of Texans. That\u2019s why he\u2019s been on a full-court press against so-called \u201cassault weapons\u201d ever since El Paso.\n\nLast night, Beto once again made his intentions clear by saying \u201cHell yeah,\u201d he was going to come for our AR-15s.\n\nHe then repeated that message on Twitter, which prompted a response.\n\nA Republican state lawmaker from Texas has caused outcry for tweeting \u201cMy AR is ready for you Robert Francis\u201d after Democratic presidential candidate Robert Francis \u201cBeto\u201d O\u2019Rourke pledged to ban and confiscate AR-15 military-style rifles. Within hours, Twitter took down Briscoe Cain\u2019s post, which O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign labeled a \u201cdeath threat\u201d. \u201cIt violates our rules for threats of violence,\u201d a company spokesperson said late Thursday night. This is a death threat, Representative. Clearly, you shouldn\u2019t own an AR-15\u2014and neither should anyone else. pic.twitter.com/jsiZmwjMDs \u2014 Beto O\u2019Rourke (@BetoORourke) September 13, 2019 Earlier, Cain, a 34-year-old \u201cconservative Republican\u201d lawyer who represents a district outside of Houston, Texas, had mocked Twitter users who called his comment a threat of violence. \u201cYou\u2019re an idiot,\u201d he told one commenter. When O\u2019Rourke called the tweet a death threat, and said it proved that neither Cain nor anyone else should own an AR-15, Cain responded, \u201cYou\u2019re a child, Robert Francis.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the thing, though. It wasn\u2019t really a threat.\n\nIt was a warning.\n\nO\u2019Rourke continues to labor under this delusion that AR-15 owners will play nicely with him if he were to somehow win and get his way on the issue. He actually thinks we\u2019ll comply. He\u2019s convinced we will.\n\nAnd when he\u2019s warned that we won\u2019t, he does this.\n\n\u201cOh, you\u2019re threatening me!\u201d\n\nActual footage of Beto O\u2019Rouke upon reading Cain\u2019s tweet:\n\nIt\u2019s like him claiming that Meghan McCain was giving people permission to commit violence.\n\nBriscoe Cain is just the latest person to warn him of just what will transpire if the government decides to take people\u2019s guns. We\u2019re not playing around with him. We\u2019re giving him fair warning.\n\nThe problem is, Beto is just too freaking stupid to grasp what we\u2019re telling him.\n\nIf there\u2019s a saving grace to this, it\u2019s that Beto will never be president. He wouldn\u2019t have qualified for last night\u2019s debate if the DNC was using a less biased method to determine which polls mattered and which didn\u2019t. That means everything he\u2019s slinging around is bluster and little more.\n\nOh, don\u2019t get me wrong, he means it. He just won\u2019t get the chance to implement any of it.\n\nShould that change, though, he needs to understand that when people start dying, he doesn\u2019t get to pretend he didn\u2019t know this would happen. He\u2019s been warned. They\u2019ve all been warned what will happen if they decide Beto\u2019s idea is a good one and decide to implement it.\n\nCain is just the latest to do so.", "description": "O'Rourke says he's coming for our AR-15s.
