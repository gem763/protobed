So if the same login ID is watching content in London and Birmingham simultaneously, it\u2019s not going to be the same person.\n\n\u2018Casual credentials sharing is becoming too expensive to ignore,\u2019 said Jean Marc Racine, the CPO of Synamedia.\n\n\u2018Our new solution gives operators the ability to take action. Many casual users will be happy to pay an additional fee for a premium, shared service with a greater number of concurrent users.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s a great way to keep honest people honest while benefiting from an incremental revenue stream.\u2019\n\nThe program will flag what it thinks is an infringement to the service provider (Netflix, Amazon Prime or Hulu in the US) who can then decide what action to take. That might be an outright ban on the account or just a sternly-worded email telling them to pay for a premium account.\n\nThe artificial intelligence program does more than just play whack-a-mole with logins. It can actually build up patterns of behaviour. The company says that university campuses, for example, are a hotbed of credential sharing.\n\nSynamedia says its system is being trialled now by a number of content providers, although it won\u2019t say exactly who they are.", "description": "We could all soon be forced to do the unthinkable and pay for our own accounts.", "authors": ["Jasper Hamill"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/sec_46630411-c5c3_1571672080.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
