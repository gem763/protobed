In its initial court filing, Facebook said the operation may have raked in $9.4 million from its fake-engagement scheme, violating 1980s federal cybersecurity law.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe deal -- a portion of which must be approved by a judge -- bans the three individuals who ran the company from Facebook\u2019s services and requires the defendants to pay $500,000, according to court documents filed in federal court in California.\n\nThe penalty shows how Facebook\u2019s new legal team is \u201cdedicated to furthering the company\u2019s enforcement efforts,\u201d said Jessica Romero, a former prosecutor who oversees the team.\n\nFacebook sues South Korean analytics company to send \u2018message\u2019 about privacy to app developers\n\nFor Facebook, safeguarding its social network remains one of its most fundamental challenges: The very features that allow users to share posts and photos freely or take advantage of third-party apps can easily become vectors for fraud, misinformation and privacy abuses, putting people in jeopardy -- and earning the scorn of regulators.\n\nAD\n\nThe enormity of its task became apparent last month, when court documents in a fight between Facebook and the state of Massachusetts revealed the company discovered tens of thousands of apps that may have broken its rules, some of which may have improperly handled users\u2019 personal data. Facebook discovered the potential abuse as a result of an internal investigation it launched following the Cambridge Analytica scandal.\n\nAD\n\nFacebook suspends tens of thousands of apps following data investigation\n\nThat same app review also has resulted in at least three lawsuits brought by Romero's team, the company said in recent weeks.\n\nIn August, Facebook took aim at two developers -- one in Hong Kong, and another in Singapore -- who allegedly created tools available on Google's app store that infected smartphones with malware for the purpose of creating fake clicks on Facebook ads. Another brought in March charged that two Ukranian men used duplicitous software, which could be installed on a user's browser, to scrape information from Facebook users' profiles. Both are pending resolution in court.\n\nGoing forward, Romero said Facebook planned to target \u201canything that impacts our user safety whether it be because of privacy reasons, fraud or misleading information on our platforms.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "A new Facebook initiative to fight fraudulent app developers and advertisers in federal court notched an early victory this month, when the tech giant reached a settlement with a New Zealand company that had peddled fake likes on Instagram.", "authors": ["Tony Romm", "Senior Tech Policy Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Ivkic3zKqqTws8EztxES10hHZGk=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MTSEVSXFEYI6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg"}
