There is no lack of bragging about this. There is no lack of beautiful words.\n\n\u201cBut when it comes to our actual emissions and our ecological footprints per capita \u2013 if we include our consumption, our imports as well as aviation and shipping \u2013 then it\u2019s a whole other story.\u201d\n\nThe Swedish schoolgirl began a lone climate change protest in October 2018 outside the country\u2019s parliament.\n\nShe said she would refuse to attend school on Fridays until the Swedish government dealt with the intensifying ecological crisis.\n\nGreta\u2019s actions have sparked a global protest movement. Inspired by her, schoolchildren have walked out of their classrooms in a series of Friday protests.\n\nThe 16-year-old has also spoken in front of world leaders at the UN general assembly and Davos and was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, which was won by Ethiopian prime minister Abiy Ahmed.\n\n\u201cIn Sweden we live as if we had about 4 planets according to WWF and Global Footprint Network. And roughly the same goes for the entire Nordic region,\u201d the teenager said in her Instagram post.\n\n\u201cSo until you start to act in accordance with what the science says is needed to limit the global temperature rise below 1,5 degrees or even 2 degrees celsius, I \u2013 and Fridays For Future in Sweden \u2013 choose not to accept the Nordic Councils environmental award.\u201d", "description": "Greta Thunberg has turned down an environmental prize\u00a0worth 500,000 Swedish kronor (\u00a340,000).
