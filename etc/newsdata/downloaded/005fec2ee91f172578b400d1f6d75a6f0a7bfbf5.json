The ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, +0.00% posted its biggest one-day rise in around three months on Wednesday, while U.S. stocks and bond yields rose, dulling demand for gold.\n\nA stronger dollar can be a negative for currencies priced in the commodity as it makes them more expensive to users of other currencies, though the dollar index traded lower in Thursday dealings. Rising bond yields can also be a negative, increasing the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets like commodities. Treasury yields moved lower Thursday.\n\nAnalysts said bulls might find encouragement from signs of bargain hunting interest as gold, which has rallied in 2019, but pulled back.\n\nHoldings in gold exchange-traded funds tracked by Bloomberg \u201cwere topped up by over 22 tons \u2013 their biggest daily inflow in three months,\u201d wrote analysts at Commerzbank. \u201cFor the first time since February 2013, ETF holdings are thus above 2,500 tons again.\u201d\n\nThe gold-backed SPDR Gold Shares exchange-traded fund GLD, +0.34% was up 0.5% in Thursday dealings.\n\nIn other metals trade, October platinum PLV19, +0.59% rose 0.2% to $929.80 an ounce, while December palladium PAZ19, +1.53% was up 1.3% at $1,632 an ounce.\n\nDecember copper HGZ19, -0.86% fell 0.5% to $2.5985 a pound.", "description": "Gold futures head higher on Thursday, a day after a surge by the U.S. dollar prompted the precious metal to suffer its worst daily decline in nearly three...", "authors": ["Myra P.
