However there are now a bunch of contenders who may have seen a few cracks appear and questions arise after a mixed build-up by the defending champions.\n\nA scratchy win over Argentina, a draw with South Africa, and heaven forbid, a record loss to Australia had voracious New Zealand fans moving uncomfortably in their seats and radio phone-ins running hot. But the All Blacks have ability unlike any other side to adjust, respond and dominate, as shown a week after the record loss in Perth when they were back to their ruthless best at their home fortress Eden Park.\n\nTough selection calls were made for that match, and it was a signal towards the bombshell that was to come when the World Cup 31 were named and the 108-Test prop Owen Franks was missing. The coaching team had indicated a desire for big, mobile props who will carry hard into contact, a shift that has likely ended Franks\u2019 international career. One of New Zealand\u2019s great strengths has long been the superior ball skills of their tight forwards, their ability to slip a pass in close quarters or put a man into space, and that is reflected in the selections of Atu Moli and Angus Ta\u2019avao. Notably, the scrum was dominant in the second Bledisloe Cup Test, for which Franks had been dropped.\n\nBeing able to leave Franks, Ngani Laumape and Liam Squire behind shows the enviable depth at their disposal. But what the right combinations are and who starts the opening game against South Africa is the next question for the nation\u2019s four million selectors. Newcomers George Bridge and Sevu Reece have the ability to set the tournament alight a-la Nehe Milner-Skudder in 2015, and excelled when given the chance to start against Australia. The best midfield duo could be any combination of the four selected, while the loose-forward make-up is also a bone of contention.\n\nBrodie Retallick won\u2019t play until the quarter-finals, Ryan Crotty goes in after a lengthy layoff, Scott Barrett and Sonny Bill Williams both have had extended spells on the sideline while Richie Mo\u2019unga and Jack Goodhue took knocks in the Bledisloe series. While injuries are par for the course it\u2019s hardly been the smoothest buildup for both the All Blacks and their expectant, passionate but often anxiety-riddled fans.\n\nHowever, as is often the case, it\u2019s coach Steve Hansen who may have made the most salient observation about the All Blacks chances and those hoping to dethrone them. One constant, Hansen remarked, is that no other team is expected to win every single time they take the field, and that pressure can be overwhelming if you\u2019re not used to it. \u201cWe live there all the time\u201d he said.\n\n\u2022 Rikki Swannell is a freelance sports broadcaster and commentator for Sky Sport NZ", "description": "This time around there are question-marks over the All Blacks but no team is so equipped to answer them all", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/338b089a5f49bb7157e28cacc8fb000d7d03b834/0_0_500_300/master/500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6841190b7be57efcd6f3c08dde9ca5a1"}
