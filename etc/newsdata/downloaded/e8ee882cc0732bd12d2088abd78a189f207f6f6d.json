Israel held its second parliamentary election in six months this week, and it appears that Netanyahu's right-wing, Likud party will be unable to win a governing majority in the Knesset, the Israeli Parliament. Instead, it appears Likud and the centrist Blue and White Party will have an even number of seats in the Knesset, leaving Netanyahu's future as prime minister uncertain.\n\nGlobal Translations A new podcast series from POLITICO.
