I don\u2019t know what it is about the style that just makes me happy, but I truly feel they are the most versatile of shoes. Having a couple of options for ankle boots in your closet is always a good idea, but there are so many to choose from. To help you narrow down your search, we\u2019ve rounded up the top-rated boots from Amazon that you can get right now and they\u2019ll show up in just about two days. It\u2019s like magic, but real.\n\nLucky Brand Women's Basel Ankle Bootie, $90: With over a 4-star rating on almost 2,000 reviews, this is the bootie for you. Made from 100% leather with a 1.25\u201d stacked wooden heel, this bootie from Lucky comes in 40 (yes, 40) different color options to match anyone\u2019s style.\n\nCarlos by Carlos Santana Women's Brie Ankle Bootie, $60: If cushioning is your game, these boots are it for you. The insoles are fully-cushioned for all-day wear. Choose from four classic neutrals (or get all of them) to add to your shoe collection. Just zip \u2018em up and go.\n\nBlondo Women's Villa Waterproof Ankle Bootie, $120: Even though this boot is made of 100% suede, it\u2019s 100% waterproof. Coming in nine color options, you can wear this boot even when there isn\u2019t a chance of rain because it looks that dang good. The low profile also means you can pair it with jeans fairly easily.\n\nSODA Women Object Flats-Shoes, $26: These boots from SODA (maker of my personal favorite espadrilles) come in so many colors, I couldn\u2019t even count. The shaft is cut low enough to show a little ankle while the stacked heel gives a bit of lift. The added 0.5\u201d platform means you get even more comfort during the day.\n\nRefresh TILDON-02 Women's Elastic Chelsea Ankle Booties, $26: A bit more on the rugged side, these boots will add a little edge to your outfit. It\u2019s got a chunky 1.75\u201d heel and a higher shaft that jeans can be tucked into. Just a heads up, reviews say to size up half a size, as the toe can be a little narrow.\n\nScouted is internet shopping with a pulse.
