It strikes at American honor. What we have done to the Kurds will stand as a blood stain in the annals of American history,' said Romney.\n\nAnd the president has reciprocated the disdain, calling Romney 'pompous', a 'fool' and tweeting '#IMPEACHMITTROMNEY'.\n\nSpeaking to The Atlantic, Romney said that it is a 'critical time ' in America.\n\n'I hope that what I'm doing will open the way for people to take a different path,' he added.\n\nNow Romney is looking past his 2012 failed presidential run to Barack Obama, and instead working on how to shape the Republican party post-Trump.\n\nThough he is not planning to run for president again, he says he has a long to-do list.\n\n'My life is not defined in my own mind by political wins and losses,' he said. 'You know, I had my career in business, I've got my family, my faith\u2014that's kind of my life, and this is something I do to make a difference.'\n\n'Berating another person, or calling them names, or demeaning a class of people, not telling the truth - those are not private things,' he said of Trump\n\nRomney has been one of the president's most vocal Republican critics, with the president firing back in tweets earlier this month\n\nRomney said he doubts that the outcome of the 2020 election will mirror Trump's electoral wins from 2016.\n\n'We have to get young people and Hispanics and African Americans to vote Republican,' he said.\n\nEarlier this month, Romney went as far as to defend Joe Biden against Trump's request for Ukraine and China to investigate Biden's son Hunter.\n\n'When the only American citizen President Trump singles out for China's investigation is his political opponent in the midst of the Democratic nomination process, it strains credulity to suggest that it is anything other than politically motivated,' Romney wrote on Twitter.\n\n'By all appearances, the President's brazen and unprecedented appeal to China and to Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden is wrong and appalling,' he added.", "description": "Utah Senator Mitt Romney says he is looking past Trump's presidency and tells The Atlantic: 'The president will not be the president forever'.", "authors": ["Dailymail.Com Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/20/21/19966222-0-image-a-33_1571605094883.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
