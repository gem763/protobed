And is renting there that much cheaper?\n\nAs part of our weekly series, What I Rent, we hung out with Jamie, a creative consultant who rents in Brighton\u2019s centre.\n\nHe\u2019s lived in Brighton for 12 years and has been in the flat for four (Picture: Andrew Hasson/Metro.co.uk)\n\nHi, Jamie! How much do you pay to live here?\n\nRent is \u00a3895 per month, bills are roughly \u00a3200 per month including council tax, utilities, and internet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat do you get for what you pay?\n\nAn open plan living room and kitchen, one bedroom, and one bathroom.\n\nDo you think you have a good deal?\n\nI think it\u2019s a good deal for central Brighton but I don\u2019t want to think about comparing it to the rest of the UK! I guess it\u2019s expensive in comparison (apart from London).\n\nWhy do you live in Brighton?\n\nI\u2019ve lived in Brighton for 12 years and in this flat for just over four years. I came here for work and have not looked back. It\u2019s an amazing vibrant city where anything goes!\n\nThe creative consultant is a big fan of statement lighting (Picture: Andrew Hasson/Metro.co.uk)\n\nAre you happy where you live?\n\nYes, I love it. It\u2019s in a great location in the centre of the city, I have bars, clubs, restaurants and shops literally a few seconds walk away, the seafront and beach are less than five minutes away.\n\nI love being in a cool busy city, but the flat is also quiet and chilled (except when friends come round to party).\n\nDo you feel like you have enough space?\n\nYes, it\u2019s a well laid out space and the large front window and high ceilings make it feel spacious and airy.\n\nThere\u2019s not a massive amount of storage space, but that helps me keep the place minimal and clutter-free \u2013 which I like.\n\nEveryone needs their own name spelled out somewhere (Picture: Andrew Hasson/Metro.co.uk)\n\nHow did you find the flat?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThrough a letting agent \u2013 you have to be quick in Brighton if you like somewhere. I was the first to view and signed up immediately.\n\nWhat\u2019s it like living alone?\n\nI\u2019m an only child so I\u2019m used to having my own space/ I love living on my own as I have more freedom in the place, if I get bored or lonely I\u2019ll pop across the road to a coffee shop, and I have a great friendship group so there is always something to do.\n\nFailing that, there\u2019s always Grindr!\n\nHow have you made the flat feel like home?\n\nAll the furniture is mine, I\u2019ve invested in some art and I\u2019m slightly lighting obsessed. I\u2019ve used automated lighting throughout the flat that enables me to create various moods, my favourite of which is the 25 LED light tiles that can be synced to music (it\u2019s great for parties).\n\nThose lights change colour and can be timed to music (Picture: Andrew Hasson/Metro.co.uk)\n\nAre there any issues with the place?\n\nNo major issues \u2013 it can be a little cold in the winter, but the landlady agreed to an extra radiator that, along with a Dyson fan, has sorted that out.\n\nAre you planning to move again?\n\nNo immediate plans to move \u2013 I\u2019d always want to remain centrally located.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHave you considered buying a place?\n\nYes I\u2019d love to own a place in Brighton but financially that\u2019s just not going to work currently!\n\nSame. Shall we have a look around?\n\nThe living room, complete with plenty of cushions (Picture: Andrew Hasson/Metro.co.uk)\n\nWe like a nice pop of blue (Picture: Andrew Hasson/Metro.co.uk)\n\nWe imagine Jamie sits there and reads (Picture: Andrew Hasson/Metro.co.uk)\n\nLook, here are some books to confirm that theory (Picture: Andrew Hasson/Metro.co.uk)\n\nHere\u2019s the kitchen. Note the fancy lights under the cabinets (Picture: Andrew Hasson/Metro.co.uk)\n\nAnd a magnetic knife strip. Posh. (Picture: Andrew Hasson/Metro.co.uk)\n\nThere\u2019s a decent amount of storage (Picture: Andrew Hasson/Metro.co.uk)\n\nHere\u2019s the bedroom (Picture: Andrew Hasson/Metro.co.uk)\n\nFor someone who lives in Brighton, Jamie has a lot of London references in his flat (Picture: Andrew Hasson/Metro.co.uk)\n\nBut where are the towels? (Picture: Andrew Hasson/Metro.co.uk)\n\nHandy for planning out your commute\u2026 if you live in London (Picture: Andrew Hasson/Metro.co.uk)\n\nToothbrush by a reed diffuser. Very nice.
