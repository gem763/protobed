Giuliani, who have been indicted on charges of funneling cash from a Russian donor to his reelection campaign.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know those gentlemen,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House as he departed for a campaign rally in Minnesota. \u201cI don\u2019t know what they do. We have nothing to do with this.\u201d\n\nBut the president said there might be photographs of him with the pair because he often poses for pictures with people.\n\nLev Parnas and Igor Fruman were indicted late Wednesday on charges of conspiring to funnel money from a Russian donor to Republican election campaigns in the U.S., including $325,000 last year to America First Action, a pro-Trump super PAC. Two other men, David Correia and Andrey Kukushkin, also face charges.\n\nMr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman introduced Mr. Giuliani to a Ukrainian prosecutor to investigate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, a Democratic presidential candidate, and his son Hunter, who was on the board of directors of a Ukrainian gas company.\n\nShortly after the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York announced their indictments, the Democratic House committee chairmen leading the impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump issued subpoenas for Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman.\n\nHouse Democrats also subpoenaed Energy Secretary Rick Perry for Ukraine-related documents as part of their expanding impeachment inquiry. The chairmen of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Foreign Affairs, and Oversight and Reform committees said Mr. Perry has until Oct. 18 to comply.\n\nThe inquiry focuses on an anonymous whistleblower\u2019s complaint saying Mr. Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a July 25 phone call to investigate the Bidens. Mr. Trump was withholding military aid for Ukraine at the time, but Mr. Zelensky said Thursday that he didn\u2019t know the money was being blocked temporarily at the time of their phone call.\n\n\u201cThere was no pressure or blackmail from the U.S.,\u201d Mr. Zelensky told reporters during a marathon press conference. \u201cI had no idea the military aid was held up.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump said the Ukrainian leader\u2019s account should kill the Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cThat should be \u2018case over,\u2019\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThere shouldn\u2019t be any further questions.\u201d\n\nHe insisted again that he had done nothing wrong and said Democrats were wasting their time demanding documents and testimony from administration officials.\n\n\u201cHow many people can [Democrats] talk to? We had a simple conversation,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThe whistleblower, who seems to be a Democrat that\u2019s involved with a lot of people, gave a false interpretation of the conversation. So I don\u2019t know why they\u2019d be calling Rick Perry. I don\u2019t know why they\u2019d be calling all these people. It\u2019s a very bad situation for our country. You have to run a country. I just don\u2019t think you can have everybody testify.\u201d\n\nCiting Chairman Adam B. Schiff\u2019s made-up version of his phone call at a House intelligence committee hearing, the president said, \u201cWhat he did is criminal. The Democrats have committed crimes.\u201d\n\nIn his first campaign rally since Democrats announced their impeachment inquiry, Mr. Trump told supporters in Minneapolis Thursday night that \u2026\n\nMr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman face four charges including conspiracy, falsification of records and lying to the Federal Election Commission about political donations. The charges against the pair appear to be unrelated to their Ukraine activities.\n\nBoth men have donated heavily to Republican campaigns, including the contribution to America First Action in May 2018 through a business called Global Energy Producers, according to FEC data.\n\nProsecutors say the two men shielded the foreign source of the funds by laundering through their U.S. business. Mr. Fruman went so far as to intentionally misspell his name so the FEC wouldn\u2019t catch the donations, they said.\n\nThey were arrested at Washington Dulles International Airport before they could board an international flight with one-way tickets, said Geoffrey Berman, U.S. attorney for the Southern District. The men were seen earlier Wednesday having lunch with Mr. Giuliani at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, The Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nThe complaint says the men took part in political activities in the U.S. on behalf of at least one Ukrainian government official, including an effort to remove the U.S. ambassador in Kyiv, Marie Yovanovitch, who was recalled from her post in May.\n\nThe pair reportedly pledged to raise campaign funds for then-Rep. Pete Sessions, Texas Republican, and met with him at a pro-Trump super PAC event in 2018. Mr. Sessions is not charged but is referred to as \u201cCongressman-1\u201d in the indictment.\n\nThey also have claimed to have attended a small gathering with the president in Washington in May 2018 focused on the midterm elections.\n\nThe House committees are demanding that the two men testify and turn over documents related to efforts to get Ukrainian officials to investigate the Bidens, the Democratic National Committee or Hillary Clinton.\n\n\u201cYour clients are private citizens who are not employees of the executive branch,\u201d the committee chairmen wrote in a letter to Mr. Giuliani. \u201cThey may not evade requests from Congress for documents and information necessary to conduct our inquiry.\u201d\n\nThe federal investigation stemmed from a complaint filed by the Campaign Legal Center, an open government advocacy group. The organization uncovered the Trump campaign donation in July 2018.\n\n\u201cWe are pleased that federal law enforcement has conducted an investigation into these campaign finance crimes and made these two arrests. The public is now learning just how dangerous dark money can be in U.S. elections, including the potential for illegal foreign funds, which DOJ says were used here,\u201d said Trevor Potter, president of the Campaign Legal Center and former Republican chairman of the FEC.\n\n\u201cThe fact that these two individuals were working with Giuliani and Ukrainian government officials to alter U.S. policy in that country will obviously be relevant to the impeachment investigation,\u201d Mr. Potter said.\n\nIn issuing a subpoena to Mr. Perry, the Democratic committee chairmen said recent media reports \u201chave raised questions about any role you may have played in conveying or reinforcing the president\u2019s stark message to the Ukrainian president.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese reports have also raised significant questions about your efforts to press Ukrainian officials to change the management structure at a Ukrainian state-owned energy company to benefit individuals involved with Rudy Giuliani\u2019s push to get Ukrainian officials to interfere in our 2020 election,\u201d the chairmen added.\n\nThe president also confirmed that former Rep. Trey Gowdy, South Carolina Republican, won\u2019t be able to join his legal team as outside counsel in the impeachment defense until at least January because of what he called \u201clobbying rules.\u201d\n\n\u2981 Gabriella Mu\u00f1oz contributed to this report.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
