On 19 August, they suffered a 6-1 reversal away to champions Dundalk in the league-cup semi-final. Is this the biggest swing in the margin of victory/defeat for a team in consecutive games?\u201d asks John Shortall.\n\nWho is the oldest footballer to make their debut in a top-flight division? | The Knowledge Read more\n\nSo, 14\u2019s the score to beat. Earlier this month, symmetrical swings also added up to that number in the Northern Premier League, as Richard Worrall observes. \u201cThey had a 7-0 home win (v Grantham Town) on 8 October; four days later on 12 October they lost by a similar score playing away to FC United.\u201d\n\n\u201cFunnily enough we just saw a bigger swing in the World Cup qualifiers,\u201d says Chris Page. \u201cIran registered a 14-0 win over Cambodia, before falling 1-0 to Bahrain five days later. That\u2019s a swing of 15.\u201d\n\nEighty years ago, Robert Kaye reckons Hull City matched the 15-goal swing: on 31 December 1938 they lost 2-6 to Bradford, but next time out \u2013 on 14 January \u2013 they thumped Carlisle 11-0.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Iran thrashed Cambodia 14-0 in World Cup qualifying but five days later lost 1-0 to Bahrain \u2013 a swing of 15 goals. Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nHowever, the Oceania 2002 World Cup qualifying campaign can trump it, says Pablo Miguez. \u201cTonga defeated Samoa 1-0 in the opening game. They faced Australia in the second match, losing 22-0. I believe this was \u2013 for two days \u2013 a World Cup qualifying record \u2026 until Australia defeated American Samoa 31-0.\u201d Australia ended their four-game campaign with a goal difference of +66.\n\nMeanwhile, Chris Rawson found two teams playing back-to-back in late 1963, with a nine-goal swing ensuing: \u201cOn Boxing Day, Burnley hosted United (Bobby Charlton et al) at Turf Moor and ran out 6-1 winners, with future United star Willie Morgan scoring twice in front of 35,764. Two days later, the reverse fixture was held at Old Trafford, with United winning 5-1 having brought back the 17-year-old George Best to wear the No 11 shirt!\u201d\n\nPage has the final word, however. \u201cYou\u2019d be hard pressed to topple AS Adema\u2019s tally from 2002. On 31 October they recorded their famous world record 149-0 win over SO l\u2019Emyrne. Ten days later, they were eliminated from the Coupe de Madagascar, losing 3-2 to Fifafifi Toamasina. That\u2019s a swing of 150. I can\u2019t imagine anyone else having a greater fall from grace than that.\u201d So: anyone have 151?\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nStadiums with missing pieces\n\n\u201cApart from Oxford United,\u201d tweets Mighty Alan, \u201cwhich grounds have no seating/stand at one end of the ground?\u201d\n\nThree-sided grounds aren\u2019t uncommon. Martin O\u2019Gorman contributes Central Coast Stadium, home to A-League\u2019s Central Coast Mariners. \u201cAt least the view distracts from the dire football being played on the pitch,\u201d he snorts.\n\nOne spare end can be found at the homes of various Scottish sides, Kevyn Whitelaw observes. One end of Partick Thistle\u2019s Firhill is open, \u201cwhere once there was a decent-sized terrace\u201d. Hamilton Accies, who they used to groundshare with, \u201crelocated to a new stadium which also has one end open, with a double decker bus often parked there.\u201d\n\nMichael Haughey adds Falkirk Stadium, which has only three stands and a fence down one touchline. He also cites Campo de F\u00fatbol de Vallecas, home to Rayo Vallecano, with its permanent wall of advertising hoardings at one end \u2026\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Campo de F\u00fatbol de Vallecas, ideal for solo passing practice. Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo\n\nWhitelaw continues: \u201cI had a season ticket at Rayo Vallecano for a couple of years. Directly behind the hoardings are flats that overlook the ground. Locals used to \u2018rent out\u2019 balcony spaces for the bigger matches.\u201d\n\n\u201cHowever, the above can be bested,\u201d Haughey says. \u201cSince the turn of the millennium, the home of the sons of the rock, Dumbarton FC, has been a one-sided stadium with a fence running around the pitch.\u201d\n\nRob McEvoy has word of opportunism from Thailand: \u201cBG Pathum United have the three-sided Leo Stadium which is missing a stand down the side. The reason for this is that for some unknown reason they built the stadium close to the edge of their large plot of land (an old bottling plant, BG stands for Bangkok Glass).\u201d\n\nThe neighbours: a car showroom. \u201cRealising the club need that land, they want a kings ransom for it. The three sides built are really good as well. Interestingly, the owner of Oxford is Thai too, although he didn\u2019t build the ground.\u201d\n\nAny more strange tales behind wonky stadiums? Mail us or tweet @TheKnowledge_GU.\n\nKnowledge archive\n\n\u201cHave any managers or coaches been injured during a game while sitting on the bench or in the technical area?\u201d asked Davide Corran in August 2009.\n\nSome managers, it seems, are a magnet for trouble. Take Sydney FC\u2019s John Kosmina. \u201cJohn Kosmina was flattened by Danny Allsopp of Melbourne Victory during a game,\u201d suggests James Coppard. \u201cI don\u2019t think he was badly hurt at all but, this wasn\u2019t the first time he\u2019s had a tangle with a Melbourne player \u2013 in 2006, Victory\u2019s Kevin Muscat sent him tumbling too, while Kosmina was manager of Adelaide United. Personally, what I find weirdest is how the \u2018bench\u2019 at Melbourne\u2019s games appears to be flimsy garden chairs atop a plastic sheet? Surely that\u2019s just asking for trouble.\u201d\n\nIt should be pointed out that Kosmina, though floored, seemed to suffer little or no ill-effects from his tangles with opposition players. And, despite taking a trip to A&E, neither was Tromso coach, Harald Abrekk, after this incident (there\u2019s a little footage of the actual event scattered throughout the Norwegian phoenix-from-the-flames style reconstruction). \u201cThis took place in on 16 May 1995 at Aspmyra Stadium in Bodo,\u201d writes Jostein Nygard. \u201cIn this northern Norwegian \u2018derby\u2019 between Bodo/Glimt and Tromso (Bodo and Tromso might be 200 miles apart, but it\u2019s still considered a \u2018derby\u2019 here), on the most important round of the year (the night before the National Day), the Tromso coach, Harald Abrekk, was taken to the hospital after being \u2018hit\u2019 by the Bodo/Glimt physio.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s in Norwegian, but you should get a good impression of what happened,\u201d he adds rather optimistically of the video footage. \u201cIn the interview he tells about how they were up 2-1, and he did it to \u2018waste time\u2019 (the match ended 2-1, so I guess it worked). \u2018Were you hurt?\u2019 \u2018No.\u2019 \u2018Did it hurt at all?\u2019 \u2018No.\u2019\u201d\n\nOne manager who certainly was hurt in the dugout was the former Tottenham manager Juande Ramos. The then Sevilla manager was knocked unconscious by an object thrown from the Real Betis crowd after Freddie Kanout\u00e9 had equalised for the visitors in the city derby and the match was abandoned.\n\nUnfortunately Ramos is not alone in finding the technical area in Spain a dangerous place. The Real Sociedad coach Juan Manuel Lillo needed stitches after being struck by an object thrown from Real\u2019s own fans during the club\u2019s 0-0 draw with Eibar in November 2008.\n\nBut managers aren\u2019t always the victims of touchline violence, as Joe Marshall points out: \u201cI seem to remember Trevor Francis punching reserve team goalkeeper Alex Kolinko in the face when he was manager of Crystal Palace. I believe this resulted in Kolinko receiving a bloody nose.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Trevor Francis: don\u2019t test.

Has anyone ever gone longer between consecutive bookings or red cards?\u201d\n\nFrom Anthony Gee: \u201cThis weekend Dundee United, who were top of the Scottish Championship, were beaten 4-0 by Queen of the South. What is the biggest defeat for a league leader?\u201d\n\nChesterfield v Wrexham met in the FA Cup fourth qualifying round, with Wrexham winning Tuesday\u2019s replay, says Ken Foster. \u201cIn 1997 they also met in the FA Cup sixth round proper. Has there ever been a fixture separated by so many rounds before?\u201d\n\nRichard Wilson (@timomouse) So, @TheKnowledge_GU, has any side got a worse points/distance ratio than Carlisle to Plymouth? 1 point in 10,000 miles seems about as poor a ratio as you can get in the Uk. https://t.co/csaUSwr4wt\n\nEmail your questions and answers to knowledge@theguardian.com or tweet @TheKnowledge_GU.", "description": "Plus: lopsided stadiums and the potted history of injuries suffered from the sidelines", "authors": ["Guardian Sport"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a93ade08fa31ddfa00fa5db7e5bfc8ba6fe4b5f8/0_115_3822_2294/master/3822.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=20a1cde08b1ccc6817e4892d1640f4aa", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
