The Nasdaq Composite lost 0.2% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 54 points, or 0.2%, to 26842.\n\nDeclines among shares of semiconductor firms weighed on major indexes, with Texas Instruments dropping 9.1% after giving a downbeat outlook for the fourth quarter.\n\nHealth care stocks were mixed: Eli Lilly fell 5.4% after posting revenue that missed analysts' expectations and medical-device maker Boston Scientific climbed 5.9% after it raised its revenue growth target.\n\nAmong industrials, Boeing shares jumped 2.7% after the aerospace giant said profits more than halved in the latest quarter but indicated it still expects its 737 MAX to return to service by the end of the year.\n\nThe rally in Boeing shares helped keep the Dow industrials slightly higher for the day, even as the broader S&P 500 traded slightly lower.\n\nLater Wednesday, investors will get a read on quarterly results from companies including Microsoft, Ford Motor and Tesla. So far in the reporting season, S&P 500 companies have mostly managed to beat analysts' estimates, although investors note that expectations were relatively low heading into the fourth quarter.\n\nElsewhere, the Stoxx Europe 600 ticked down 0.1% after British lawmakers endorsed the terms of a Brexit agreement but rejected the government's proposed timetable.\n\nThe pound, which had fallen sharply after Tuesday's votes, edged up 0.1% against the U.S. dollar.\n\nParliament's rejection of Prime Minister Boris Johnson's legislative schedule for Brexit reduced the likelihood of a departure by Oct. 31, said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets. Mr. Johnson said Tuesday that he would try to trigger an election if lawmakers move too slowly in considering his deal.\n\n\"There are a lot of moving parts,\" which makes it hard for investors to position for what happens next, Mr. Hewson said. \"We are now in extension territory and we've been in that territory for a while.\"\n\nIn Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index fell 0.8%, posting its biggest one-day decline since the start of the month, following reports that China is preparing to replace the city's leader, Carrie Lam.\n\n--David Hodari and Akane Otani contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Caitlin Ostroff at caitlin.ostroff@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 23, 2019 10:00 ET (14:00 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
