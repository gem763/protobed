But to make it stable they will need either another party or support of minorities - Serbs, Turks, and Bosniaks - who together have 20 seats in the parliament.\n\nThe election, the fourth since Kosovo\u2019s declaration of independence in 2008, was called after Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj resigned in July when he was summoned to appear before a war crimes court.\n\nHe has been questioned over his role in the 1998-99 war as one of the commanders of the former Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), which fought for independence from Serbia. He denies wrongdoing.\n\nWhoever ends up running Kosovo next will have to face the issue of ties with Serbia, from which it declared independence in 2008. Normalization of ties between the two could help secure Pristina a seat in the United Nations.\n\n\u2018WE DON\u2019T HAVE TIME TO LOSE\u2019\n\n\u201cI will do the maximum to have the government as soon as possible because we are in the end of the year and we need to pass the budget,\u201d said Vetevendosje leader Albin Kurti, who according to Kosovo law will get the mandate to be the country\u2019s prime minister.\n\n\u201cTonight I will not knock on the LDK door but I will do the first thing tomorrow. We don\u2019t have time to lose,\u201d Kurti told T7 television.\n\nOpinion polls before the vote pointed to public dissatisfaction with Haradinaj\u2019s record at the head of a three-party governing coalition as boosting support for the opposition, which campaigned on platforms of tackling what they said is deeply rooted corruption.\n\nThe Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK), the largest party in the outgoing coalition, came in third with 21% of the votes, and a list led by Haradinaj got 11.5%, preliminary results showed.\n\nTurnout was 44.05%. The vote count did not include votes from the diaspora, which traditionally go to Vetevendosje mostly.\n\nAlbin Kurti, leader of the Self-Determination movement (Vetevendosje party), greets supporters after preliminary results of the parliamentary election in Pristina, Kosovo, October 7, 2019.

Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic said Belgrade would talk to elected Kosovo officials once the tariffs are abolished.\n\nThe United States and the European Union see tensions between Belgrade and Pristina as a major threat to regional stability and are pushing for a normalization of relations.\n\nOn Thursday, U.S. President Donald Trump appointed Richard Grenell, the straight-talking U.S. ambassador to Germany, as special envoy to try to inject new energy into the talks between Belgrade and Pristina.\n\nTwenty years after NATO bombing expelled Serbian forces, Belgrade refuses to recognize Kosovo as independent and, in concert with its ally Russia, has blocked Pristina\u2019s membership in international organizations, including the United Nations.\n\nIn 2013, Pristina and Belgrade agreed to an EU-mediated dialogue to normalize ties but little progress has been made.\n\nSlideshow (17 Images)\n\nThe election was overseen by more than 34,000 independent monitors, including 100 from the European Union.\n\nNo major incidents were reported but police said they detained at least 20 people for photographing their ballots.", "description": "The opposition leftist Vetevendosje party was set to come in first in Kosovo's parliamentary poll, but it will have to negotiate a coalition to form a government.", "authors": ["Fatos Bytyci", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191006&t=2&i=1437869377&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF950S2", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
