Two of those men have been in prison for 50 years, both having committed crimes when they were 17 years old, records from corrections department show.\n\nSome recent cases where inmates have been resentenced have garnered national attention, like that of Sheldry Topp, who was convicted of murder when he was 17 and was released in February after 56 years behind bars, also in Michigan.\n\nThe issue of life without parole also came up in the case of Alvin Kennard, who was 22 years old and not a juvenile when he faced that mandatory sentence for stealing $50.75 from a bakery and spent 36 years behind bars.\n\nAt the time, Alabama law mandated the harsh sentence because it was Kennard's fourth offense. The law has since been modified to give judges the option of granting parole.\n\n\"It\u2019s an issue that impacts thousands of people,\" said Liz Ryan, the president and CEO of the Youth First Initiative, referring to those who are waiting to be resentenced and their families. \"There are people in many states that are serving these sentences whose cases have not been reviewed.\u201d\n\nNow the Supreme Court is revisiting the issue of the constitutionality of juvenile sentences of life without parole in a case involving Lee Boyd Malvo, who was 17 years old when he participated in the Beltway Sniper attacks. His case was heard before the court this Wednesday.\n\nPHOTO: In this Oct. 26, 2004, file photo, Lee Boyd Malvo enters a courtroom in the Spotsylvania, Va., Circuit Court.

And the number of life sentences continues to increase, despite a decline in the violent crime rate since the 1990s, the group reports.\n\nThe U.S. is the only country in the world that sentences juveniles to life without parole, experts said. As of 2016, there were approximately 2,300 inmates who were serving life without parole for crimes committed as juveniles. Supreme Court cases over the past decade have chipped away at harsh sentencing for people convicted as juveniles, first by invalidating the death penalty, then targeting life without parole for those convicted of non-homicide crimes, followed by homicide.\n\nThe argument has been that children don't have the same level of maturity and appreciation of consequences that adults do. They also have a greater capacity for reform, advocates said.\n\n\"Life without parole is an especially harsh punishment for a juvenile,\" former Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote in the opinion of Graham v. Florida, a 2010 case that invalidated life without parole for juveniles who committed non-homicide crimes. \"Under this sentence a juvenile offender will on average serve more years and a greater percentage of his life in prison than an adult offender.\"", "description": "In 1996, Clifton Gibson was tried and convicted of first degree murder.
