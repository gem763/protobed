They know Verlander is waiting for them around the corner, and Cole is looming just beyond, and the Yankees\u2019 cold reality is this: to win the American League Championship Series, they will need to vanquish them both.\n\nThat grim reality was the consequence of the Yankees\u2019 unsightly 8-3 loss in Game 4 of the ALCS on Thursday night at Yankee Stadium \u2014 a game that moved the Astros, who now lead the best-of-seven series three games to one, to within one more win of a World Series date with the Washington Nationals, and pushed the Yankees to within one more loss of their season ending.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAstros mainstays George Springer and Carlos Correa each hit three-run homers \u2014 the former off Yankees starter Masahiro Tanaka in the third inning, the latter off reliever Chad Green in the sixth \u2014 to highlight what amounted to an explosion of runs for a Houston offense that still hasn\u2019t performed to its full, best-in-the-majors capabilities this month.\n\nAs if their plight isn\u2019t bad enough, the Yankees will next have to deal with Verlander, who received no decision in the Astros\u2019 victory in Game 2 and who is expected to get the ball Friday night in Game 5 at Yankee Stadium, opposing Yankees lefty James Paxton. Should the Yankees survive that, it would send the series back to Houston for Game 6 on Saturday. And if they win that as well, they would get Cole, the Astros\u2019 firewall and a pitcher who hasn\u2019t lost a decision since May 22, in Game 7.\n\n\u201cOur guys are studs, and I think they embrace the challenge,\u201d Yankees Manager Aaron Boone said. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to see them go out there and play our game.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cStranger things have happened in baseball,\u201d Yankees slugger Aaron Judge said. \u201cWe\u2019re down right now. But there\u2019s a lot of games still to play.\u201d\n\nGame 4 had been rescheduled from Wednesday night due to rain. Thursday\u2019s weather, by contrast, was dry, cool and windy, with the flags atop the stadium \u2014 lowered to half-mast to honor the passing of Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) \u2014 whipping and snapping in the wind. Any pop fly was an adventure. Occasionally, the playing field was visited by a stray plastic bag drifting in the wind.\n\nA crowd of 49,067 was by turns electric, restless and salty \u2014 booing lustily, for example, as the Yankees\u2019 infield booted four grounders, two each by first baseman D.J. LeMahieu and second baseman Gleyber Torres, and when struggling reliever Adam Ottavino failed to retire either of the two batters he faced in the eighth (one of whom reached on LeMahieu\u2019s second error). Twice, the public address announcer had to remind fans not to throw objects on the field.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe errors hurt,\u201d Yankees center fielder Aaron Hicks said. \u201cWe need to clean it up. Play our baseball \u2014 clean baseball. If we play the game the way we know we can play, we\u2019ll win ballgames.\u201d\n\nBut the crowd put aside its vitriol and rose to its feet in the eighth to bid a rousing farewell to veteran lefty CC Sabathia \u2014 who suffered an undisclosed shoulder injury at the end of a four-batter appearance and who, having already announced his retirement, has likely thrown the final pitch of his career \u2014 and some of the Astros stood on the top step of their dugout to join the ovation.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a warrior right there. That was tough to see,\u201d Judge said. \u201cThat\u2019s our leader, man. He left it all out there.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nFor all their offensive prowess this season \u2014 they led the majors in batting average, on-base percentage and slugging percentage \u2014 the Astros\u2019 lineup had struggled to produce this postseason, averaging a little more than three runs a game and hitting just .217/.286/.373 as a team entering Thursday. In the first three games of this series, they had gone 1 for 19 with runners in scoring position.\n\nAD\n\nOn Thursday night, their first chance with runners in scoring position came in the second inning, when Robinson Chirinos led off with a walk and Josh Reddick followed with a line-drive single to right. On a 1-0 count to Springer, Tanaka hung a splitter over the plate, and Springer crushed it into the seats in left.\n\nTanaka would depart one batter into the sixth, giving way to Green, who later that inning served up the 0-1 fastball that Correa crushed to left for another three-run homer. Tanaka was charged with three earned runs in all, the first time in eight career postseason starts that he had given up more than two.\n\nAD\n\nAstros starter Zack Greinke, meanwhile, survived an uncharacteristic bout of wildness \u2014 he walked three batters in the first inning alone, as many walks as he had issued in his previous nine starts combined \u2014 to pitch into the fifth inning, allowing only a single run in that messy first.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cZack getting out of the first with only [giving up] one run, having spent a lot of pitches \u2014 and a lot of stressful pitches . . . was pivotal for us to hang in there,\u201d Astros Manager A.J. Hinch said.\n\nThe Astros\u2019 lead swelled to 6-1 on Correa\u2019s homer in the top of the sixth, shrunk to 6-3 in the bottom of the sixth when Yankees catcher Gary Sanchez hit a two-run homer off rookie right-hander Josh James, then expanded to 8-3 thanks largely to the Yankees\u2019 spotty defense. Even then, Hinch took no chances, using all his best relievers to carry the lead home \u2014 Will Harris for three outs, Joe Smith for two and closer Roberto Osuna for four.\n\nAD\n\nBy the ninth inning, Yankee Stadium was a sea of empty seats and bitter resignation.\n\nThe Yankees, despite an unprecedented run of injuries, won 103 games this season, swept the Minnesota Twins in the Division Series and took the opener against the Astros. It has been a remarkable season. But its survival is now predicated upon a terrible equation.\n\nIt has been four months \u2014 dating back to a mid-June series in Cincinnati, of all places \u2014 since a team has won games started by Verlander and Cole within the same series. Over the entire 162-game regular season, no team hung a loss on both pitchers. To get to the World Series, the Yankees will almost certainly need to become the first.\n\nAD", "description": "George Springer\u2019s three-run homer gets Houston started in 8-3 win that gives Astros 3-1 lead in series.", "authors": ["Dave Sheinin", "National Baseball Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/O0kIne4CvP_vuwn7-YZ1Jxq-Zj8=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/O74FOMXRLMI6TBUT6SD6IZ4EVI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
