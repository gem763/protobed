You can see, I'm very guarded about what I have to say because this is an active court case.\"", "description": "Before Donald Trump's phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart sparked the whistleblower complaint that might lead\u00a0to impeachment, another whistleblower\u00a0had filed a different complaint, this one related to the president\u2019s tax returns.", "authors": ["Lily Puckett"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/02/19/gettyimages-1173107188.jpg"}
