With Jason Roy in the team we are a better team and with him coming in at four, hopefully with the new ball worn off and myself and Rory Burns doing our job at the top, it allows him to come in and play his way. He\u2019s a great player to have there.\u201d\n\nDenly made his debut as an opener over the over the winter, but made just 23 runs, averaging 11.5, in two innings.\n\nDenly averages 37.33 at No 3, while he now averages 22.42 at No 4.\n\nRoy has played seven of his eight Test match innings as an opener, averaging 8.85, though he did make 72 when coming in at No 3 against Ireland at Lord\u2019s.", "description": "Joe Denly has confirmed he will swap places with\u00a0Jason Roy to open the batting for\u00a0England\u00a0with Rory Burns in the\u00a0fourth Ashes Test.
