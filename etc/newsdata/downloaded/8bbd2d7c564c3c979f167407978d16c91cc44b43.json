The speech will also touch on election campaign issues like the health service and living standards.\n\nWhat can we expect to see on the day of the speech?\n\nTo put it bluntly, a lot of gold and carriages.\n\nThe address is just part of the ceremony that marks the State Opening of Parliament that starts with a procession during which the Queen travels from Buckingham Palace to Westminster in a carriage.\n\nWhy hasn't there been a speech for so long?\n\nOne reason \u2014 Brexit.\n\nWhile there is usually a Queen's Speech once a year, former prime minister Theresa May said the UK would have a parliamentary session lasting two years to focus on Brexit.\n\n\"This last session ended up dragging on even longer because there just weren't the numbers in parliament and they were waiting to try to deal with Brexit before starting a new session,\" Maddy Thimont-Jack, Senior Researcher at the Institute for Government, told Euronews.\n\nThere is controversy around Johnson's choice to hold a Queen's Speech now due to the fact that many are expecting an election soon, she added.\n\nThis would mean the parliamentary session won't last long and would mean the speech reflects what the Conservative Party's big policies might be in their election manifesto.\n\n\"It's controversial to ask the Queen to read something out that is so politically motivated,\" said Thimont-Jack, but she added it is within the government's right to suspend parliament and start a new session.\n\nWhat happens after the speech?\n\nOnce the monarch has delivered her address, six days of debate over different elements of the speech will take place in the House of Commons, after which MPs will vote on it.\n\nThe wording of the motion that MPs will actually vote on forms part of the ceremony surrounding the event, as it is essentially thanking the Queen for the speech. In reality, they are voting on the content of the address.\n\nWhat happens if MPs vote against it?\n\nThe opposition usually votes it down, but the real question this time, according to Thimont-Jack, is if the government can win a vote this way without the numbers to get anything through parliament.\n\nIt started with a slim majority, relying on the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), but has since removed the whip from several of its MPs.\n\nUsually, if the government lost such a vote, it would be expected to call an election, but to do this UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson would need support from two-thirds of MPs \u2014 which he doesn't currently appear to have.\n\n\"We could end up in a very strange scenario where the government can't pass its Queen's Speech but still can't get the numbers for a general election, said Thimont-Jack. \"This has never really happened before and it's unclear what will happen next.\"\n\nExactly when the vote on the Queen's Speech will take place should be set after it is read out.\n\nIf it takes place after an extension of Article 50 (the deadline for the UK to leave the European Union) has been negotiated with the EU, it's more likely Johnson could get the numbers to call an election, she added.\n\nAs we are seeing with many stages of the Brexit process \u2014 timing is everything.", "description": "\"We could end up in a very strange scenario where the government can't pass its Queen's Speech but still can't get the numbers for a general election.
