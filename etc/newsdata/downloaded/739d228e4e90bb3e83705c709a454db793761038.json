Saw the flames through the side window,\u201d Rand told WJCL.\n\nThe Vietnam veteran quickly grabbed Curly and called 911.\n\nFirefighters were not able to salvage half of Rand\u2019s home, but they were able to save his medals from his military service during the Vietnam War.\n\nRand said that ultimately, it was Curly who saved his life because he predicted the roof would have collapsed on him if he did not get up in time.\n\nCommunity members in Rand\u2019s neighborhood have set up a GoFundMe page to offset the costs of fixing the damage to Rand\u2019s home. As of Thursday afternoon, it has raised $2,600 of its $5,000 goal.", "description": "A South Carolina dog is being hailed as a hero for waking up his owner during a house fire on Monday morning, an act which saved his life.", "authors": ["Katherine Rodriguez"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/curly-the-good-boy-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
