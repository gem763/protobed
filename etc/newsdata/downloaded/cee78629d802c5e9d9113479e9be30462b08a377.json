(Picture: AFP)\n\nFormer Tory minister Sir Oliver Letwin is trying to add an amendment to today\u2019s vote which would withhold approval of the deal unless and until implementing legislation has passed.\n\nThis keeps the Benn Act extension in place until all the legal boxes are ticked and would prevent an \u2018accidental no-deal departure.\u2019\n\nThe Benn Act was passed by MPs earlier this year, and forced the government to seek a three month extension to the EU deadline if no new withdrawal agreement was made before October 31st.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nWhat happens if the new deal is rejected?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat is not the only scenario under which a no-deal could happen.\n\nMPs have until October 31st to agree to a new Brexit deal.\n\nUnless the EU grant and extension to that deadline, the UK could end up leaving with a no-deal by default.\n\nA no-deal is still possible if MPs reject today\u2019s vote (Picture: AFP)\n\nAlthough bills have been passed to force the government to seek an extension, there is no guarantee the EU will grant this.\n\nIf the Withdrawal Agreement is passed by parliament and the transition period kicks in that doesn\u2019t mean the possibility of no deal is removed entirely\u2014it just means a different kind of no deal.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
