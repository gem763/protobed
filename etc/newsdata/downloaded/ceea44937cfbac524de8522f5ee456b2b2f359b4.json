I have been left with no option but to seek legal action.\n\n'Anna gave her life fighting for freedom and the rights and lives of others.\n\n'It is an embarrassment to the UK and a disgrace and shame on Turkey that her body has been left to rot in the rubble of a ruined city.'\n\nHer father Dirk (pictured with her sister Rose at a memorial service in their native Lewes, Sussex), a musician who lives in the Sussex countryside, has been trying to bring her remains back to Britain since then\n\nAnna, who got straight As in her GCSEs at \u00a310,000-a-year St Mary's Hall girls' school in Brighton, travelled to Syria via Lebanon in 2017.\n\nShe was helping evacuate locals from Afrin alongside an all-female brigade of the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG).\n\nPictured: Dirk Campbell\n\nIn March she had just stepped outside when a fighter plane dropped a bomb. She died with an AK-47 in her hand.\n\nHer father told of how she dropped out of her English degree at the University of Sheffield and became involved with radical left-wing activists.\n\nWhen her mother Adrienne, who took on her first march at the age of 11, died of breast cancer in 2012, she became more determined to take up a social cause.\n\nMr Campbell has previously told of how difficult it has been to come to terms with her death, and decision to travel to Syria.\n\nBut, speaking ahead of a BBC documentary in July, he said: 'One doesn't really come to terms with a thing like that. I should have done more.\n\n'I thought what she was doing was important enough for her that I could support her by feeling proud so that she didn't feel like she was out on a limb on her own.'\n\nMr Campbell added that he urged his daughter not to travel to Syria, as did her friends and family, but said arguing was 'futile'.\n\nThe YPG, which has about 50,000 Kurdish men and women fighting against IS in the north of the country, controlled the city of Afrin before it was captured by the Turkish military in the week of Anna's death.", "description": "Anna Campbell, 26, originally from Lewes, East Sussex, died fighting alongside Kurdish forces in the northern Syrian city of Afrin after it was hit by an air strike in March 2018.", "authors": ["Lara Keay For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/08/20119890-0-image-a-2_1571902827619.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
