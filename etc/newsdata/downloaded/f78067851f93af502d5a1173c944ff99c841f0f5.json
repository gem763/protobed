The e-commerce giant is expected to report adjusted earnings per share of $7.06 on revenue of $68.70 billion dollars, according to analysts polled by Bloomberg. And one expert predicts Amazon\u2019s nationwide rollout for one-day prime shipping will remain top of mind for investors.\n\nAmazon reports quarterly earnings this Thursday after the bell. More\n\n\u201cHistorically when Amazon has been investing like it is now with all the investments in next-day delivery, they\u2019re not so worried about margins.

More\n\n\u201cI liken it to buying a house to renovate. You don\u2019t know what you have until you start ripping off the plaster and drywall. And when you start messing around with supply chain, faster delivery times, and getting product close to the customer, there\u2019s a lot of things that need to be done. And I think Amazon learned some of that in Q2. They\u2019ll learn more in Q3,\u201d O\u2019Shea said.\n\nAmazon\u2019s stock has fallen nearly 10% in the last 3 months.\n\nMcKenzie Stratigopoulos is a producer at Yahoo Finance.
