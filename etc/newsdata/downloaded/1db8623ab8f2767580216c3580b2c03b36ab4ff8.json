(Image: Mark Bagley, Marvel Comics)\n\nTwo-thousand nineteen: A bad year for the media, by and large. Venture capitalists running amok, local news structures being torn apart and shut down, institutions being reshaped and ruined by the influence of massive tech companies like Facebook and Google. That\u2019s the real world, at least. In superhero comics? It\u2019s never been a better time, apparently.\n\nThat\u2019s why, in the wake of DC\u2019s wonderfully zany Jimmy Olsen series from Matt Fraction and Steve Lieber \u2014 which takes a lighter look at media antics in the year 2019 through the delightfully hapless pal of Superman \u2014 it\u2019s interesting to see Marvel announce that New York\u2019s paper of residence, the Daily Bugle, is getting its own comic book.\n\nPenned by Incognegro\u2019s Mat Johnson, making his Marvel debut, and with art from Black Panther and the Crew\u2019s Mack Chater, the five-issue miniseries is called Amazing Spider-Man: Daily Bugle and will serve as a loose crossover between events spiraling out of the main Amazing Spider-Man comic series and Daredevil.\n\nFollowing Bugle Editor-in-Chief Robbie Robertson and the tireless staff of Peter Parker\u2019s occasional employer, the miniseries will see the paper attempt to tackle speaking truth to power in a New York where the Kingpin of Crime holds the mayor\u2019s office.\n\nBut when Bugle sources track down a lead on a story about Spider-Man and Wilson Fisk, they soon find themselves caught up in a story that promises to change the way we see NYC\u2019s friendly neighbourhood superhero. Presumably in a way that is perhaps not so friendly.\n\nThe full cover for Amazing Spider-Man: Daily Bugle #1. (Image: Mark Bagley, Marvel Comics)\n\nIt\u2019s an interesting way to tell stories about the media, through the lens of their role in such a weird society as one where superheroes exist \u2014 especially considering that journalism is a field that finds itself wrapped up in plenty of superheroic lives. Look at how Clark Kent is about to undergo his own ethical trial after revealing (again) that he\u2019s secretly been Superman while also being one of the Daily Planet\u2019s top reporters!\n\nAlthough it\u2019s likely going to focus on this mystery of whatever the story from Fisk and Spidey\u2019s past ends up being, I hope Amazing Spider-Man: Daily Bugle will take some time to examine its media setting in a superhero world, and not just because I happen to be a member of the media myself.\n\nIt\u2019s a longstanding relationship with superhero storytelling that deserves to be mined, as much as I want to see if Robbie and his staff also have to put up with things like a former colleague pivoting to podcasting, or weird banal quibbles like, say, autoplaying video ads eating away at the Bugle\u2019s website to the chagrin of reader and writer alike.\n\nAmazing Spider-Man: Daily Bugle begins in January 2020.", "description": "Two-thousand nineteen: A bad year for the media, by and large.
