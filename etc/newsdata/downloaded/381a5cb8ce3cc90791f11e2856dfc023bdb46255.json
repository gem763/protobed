Swirling wind sees stones shoot through the sky", "language": "en", "text": "A group of explorers climbing a peak in Western Australia were thrilled when they stumbled on a natural phenomenon.\n\nFootage taken at the top of Bluff Knoll at Western Australia's Stirling Range National Park show the travellers throwing the rocks into swirling winds.\n\nBut rather than falling off the edge of the mountain as expected, the stones instead were sent flying back towards the sender.\n\nThe footage posted to Instagram last week showed friends Jack Driscoll and Tristan Forkin attempting to catch the wind just right as they threw stones over the edge of Bluff Knoll.\n\nAfter one failed attempt by Jack, both he and Tristan managed to use the upward wind to make two small stones shoot off into the breeze, with one boomeranging back right over Tristan's head.\n\nJack can be heard saying 'this is the one everyone' before his first successful attempt, which is met by laughter and disbelief from his companions.\n\nJack and Tristan are back in Australia after travelling the world.\n\nAlong with a friend from Canada they decided to visit Bluff Knoll, near where they both live.\n\nThe duo picked the spot because it was only a relatively short five hours from where they lived.\n\n'We camped at the campsite close by so we could get up at three before the sun to watch the sunrise from the top,' Jack said.\n\n'After putting my face over the edge so to see how high we were, I realized there was a strong upward draft leading us to float rocks on the wind.'", "description": "Footage taken at  Bluff Knoll at Western Australia's Stirling Range National Park show travellers throwing stones into swirling winds - but the rocks don't behave as you would expect.", "authors": ["Charlie Co\u00eb For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/01/19468126-0-image-a-4_1570579292424.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
