Hey, folks, the new guys at quarterback did pretty darn well for your teams.\n\nTeddy Bridgewater was steady in place of Drew Brees, guiding the Saints to victory in Seattle, as tough a place to win as any.\n\nKyle Allen, probably most famous in the NFL for once being a teammate of Kyler Murray\u2019s at Texas A&M;, was a revelation in place of Cam Newton as the Panthers got their first victory of the season, in Arizona.\n\nGardner Minshew is making Jaguars fans wonder why he was a sixth-round draft pick, stepping in for Nick Foles and looking like a starter (and future star).\n\nDaniel Jones, the guy who caused Giants general manager Dave Gettleman to be vilified for drafting the Duke QB sixth overall last April, looked worthy of a No. 1 overall pick. He stepped in for what the TV announcers were calling a New York legend, the benched Eli Manning, and lifted the team to last-minute victory at Tampa.\n\nOnly Mason Rudolph, replacing Ben Roethlisberger (elbow surgery) for the Steelers, didn\u2019t get a win among the newcomers. But he didn\u2019t embarrass himself at all - and had Pittsburgh in position to beat San Francisco.\n\nPlus, in Indianapolis, this stuff isn\u2019t new for Jacoby Brissett, but his name certainly belongs high on the list of quarterbacks - eight teams already have them - who were not considered the starter last month and now are in charge of their teams.\n\nYes, one-quarter of the league, as injuries, ineffectiveness and in one case, a retirement (Andrew Luck), created a sea wave of change that still could turn into a tsunami.\n\nThere\u2019s no guarantees the likes of Marcus Mariota, Case Keenum, Jameis Winston or even Andy Dalton, despite his solid performances in Cincinnati\u2019s 0-3 start, will remain behind center.\n\nAnd that\u2019s not even considering more injuries that often come, no matter how much NFL rules try to protect the passer.\n\nFor Week 3, though, let\u2019s celebrate these youngsters who stepped in and stepped up.\n\nKYLE ALLEN, PANTHERS\n\nIn his second-career start, Allen had four touchdown passes and a 144.4 QB rating.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a guy who really keeps his composure,\u201d Carolina coach Ron Rivera said. \u201cHe understands. He\u2019s smart. He\u2019s got a good football mind.\u201d\n\nNot to mention the arm and legs he showed.\n\nDANIEL JONES\n\nAt some point, it was clear the struggling Giants would turn to Jones. It came a bit earlier than some expected. So did his first NFL heroics.\n\nJones threw for 336 yards and two touchdowns and also ran for two TDs, including the go-ahead score with 1:16 remaining as New York rallied from an 18-point halftime hole to win 32-31.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s certain things that I knew about this kid when we drafted him. He was tough, he was competitive, and in my opinion he\u2019s a winner,\u201d Giants coach Pat Shurmur said. \u201cNow the rest of it is just quarterback stuff. But those first three things give him a chance to move forward.\u201d\n\nTEDDY BRIDGEWATER\n\nIt\u2019s been a long road back for Bridgewater, who looked like Minnesota\u2019s franchise quarterback before a severe knee injury forced him to miss almost two seasons.\n\nTeaming with coach Sean Payton, whose offensive expertise obviously isn\u2019t limited to handing game plans to Brees, Bridgewater was exactly what the team needed.\n\n\u201cI said all week Teddy is a leader,\u201d Saints running back Alvin Kamara said after Bridgewater threw for a touchdown, was not picked, and helped New Orleans to a huge road victory. \u201cHe had composure. He had poise and we got it done.\u201d\n\nGARDNER MINSHEW\n\nThe rookie threw two touchdown passes against Tennessee last Thursday and also had a receiver drop a ball in the end zone. He\u2019s already a star in North Florida.\n\n\u201cNothing rattles this kid,\u201d coach Doug Marrone said. \u201cHe\u2019s really good at communication and I think he\u2019s really good at preparing himself and making sure there are no surprises out there for him. That\u2019s just a guy that has a maniacal work ethic.\u201d\n\nMASON RUDOLPH\n\nThe showing by the second-year QB, basically a caddie for Roethlisberger until now, should calm the three rivers a bit in Pittsburgh. Rudolph wasn\u2019t spectacular, but also was victimized by some errors around him in the 24-20 loss to the Niners. He has no reason to hang his head.\n\n\u201cFor a young guy to come and start his first game in an away game on the West Coast and going against a great team, I think he handled himself well,\u201d wideout JuJu Smith-Schuster said. \u201cThere were situations where we messed up, didn\u2019t execute or turned the ball over, he stayed positive and kept us going.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Oh, the moans and groans in Nawlins.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Barry Wilner"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/23/giants_buccaneers_football_29643_c0-71-4359-2612_s1770x1032.jpg?55087b7028368309db6344564bf0a5fc4acb12da", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
