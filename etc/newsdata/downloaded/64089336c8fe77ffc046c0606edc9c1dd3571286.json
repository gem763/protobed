Mount St. Helena in Napa County reported sustained winds at 66 mph and gusts to 82 mph; another station near the Kincade Fire, in Healdsburg Hills in Sonoma County, reported 80 mph gusts. Healdsburg Hills North saw a gust to 93 mph.\n\nWith wildfire movement rapidly evolving, the Sonoma County sheriff\u2019s office issued a dire alert for residents in parts of Santa Rosa: \u201cLeave while you still can.\u201d Roughly 175,000 people live in the city of Santa Rosa, and many of them will join the 90,000 in Sonoma County who were already told to get out.\n\nAnd while people fled, fires continued to pop up, fueled by unrelenting winds and bone-dry air.\n\nOvernight progression of the #KincadeFire as seen on GOES-17 Satellite Fire Temperature imagery.

The worst of those fires, the Tubbs Fire, destroyed 5,636 structures and killed 22 people as it swept across Sonoma County, across subdivisions and into Santa Rosa the night of Oct. 8, 2017.\n\nUnlike the 2017 event, however, the ongoing windstorm is forecast to last nearly two days and be closely followed by more potential offshore wind events in the coming week. It\u2019s also affecting lower elevations more than typical high-wind events do in this region.\n\n[Evacuation orders expand significantly as wildfires spread in historic windstorm]\n\nFor Sunday, the Storm Prediction Center has parts of the North Bay at \u201cextremely critical\u201d fire danger, its highest fire weather risk category, over an area that includes Napa County, neighboring Solano and Colusa counties, and Yolo County near Sacramento, where meteorologists expect sustained winds to peak between 35 and 50 mph and for gusts to top 70 mph. Widespread relative humidity readings below 10 percent will continue as dry, downslope winds spread across the region.\n\nStrong upper-level winds, moving in concert with northeasterly surface winds, are helping to strengthen gusts at the surface, leading to \u201cexplosive fire growth potential.\"\n\nFire chasing\n\nCraig Clements, a fire meteorologist at San Jose State University, expected that these conditions would develop. On Saturday, while thousands were traveling south on the US 101 freeway to escape the fire danger, Clements was heading north to the front lines of the Kincade Fire.\n\nThe mass exodus seemed warranted.\n\n\u201cThis is going to be a wind-driven fire like no one\u2019s seen before,\u201d he said in a Saturday afternoon interview. \u201cThis is probably one of the biggest weather incidents in California history.\u201d\n\nClements and his team at the Fire Weather Research Lab deploy sophisticated technology, including a truck-mounted radar, to study how extreme fires behave and spread, a field in which real-world data is lacking.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re collecting weather data near the fire fronts to both understand extreme fire behavior but also to have a data set for testing next-generation fire behavior models,\u201d he said. These newer models consider not only how weather drives fire, but also how the heat from the fire feeds back into the weather system.\n\n#kincadefire extreme fire behavior with flame lengths and flame heights 100s of feet.

The winds are drying the air out as they descend over the Sierra Nevada and into the Sacramento Valley and again as they move down the lower-elevation coast ranges.\n\nNull said that although this event is likely to be similar in magnitude to the October 2017 windstorm, it could be put into historical context only after a detailed analysis.\n\nMeteorologists, though, have a quick way to determine its overall strength; they look at the pressure gradient, or the difference in surface air pressure, between San Francisco (lower pressure area) and Winnemucca in northern Nevada (higher pressure area). During the 2017 North Bay firestorms, that gradient was -17.8 millibars. The latest overnight reading had the gradient at -11.5 and counting.\n\nIn general, the greater the pressure gradient, the higher the winds will be, as air flows from higher to lower pressure.\n\nWhether a windstorm becomes a firestorm that becomes a disaster is not just about the large-scale weather pattern, but a series of contributing factors. These include population growth near forested areas, evacuation decisions, the dryness of vegetation and more.\n\nClimate lays the foundation for wildfire by affecting how dry vegetation will become, and how easily it will burn. As the climate has warmed, vegetation is drying out faster.\n\nWith repeated dry winds, combined with brief but record-breaking heat waves in California over the summer and fall, plants are now extremely dry around the Bay Area and the North Bay.\n\nIf the Tubbs Fire had erupted 10 miles farther north, for example, \u201cyou change the whole metric for what the impacts are,\u201d Null said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just the wind, it\u2019s a cascade of events,\u201d he said.", "description": "For several days, meteorologists saw the potential for this weekend's conditions to match or beat those of the deadly 2017 fires.", "authors": ["Diana Leonard", "October At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/XTvDE0wH3ghpMcyyxGh-CfE2Y3k=/1484x0/d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/10-27-2019/t_ce850e6d7985467ba400c2ecd9fba33a_name_fire.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
