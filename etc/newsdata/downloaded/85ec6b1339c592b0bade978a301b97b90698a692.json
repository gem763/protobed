Cory Booker (D-NJ) recently sat down with NPR and discussed his struggle connecting with black voters in America, a struggle he denied.\n\nBooker\u2019s comments were made during an episode of NPR\u2019s \u201cOff Script,\u201d where a conversation between Booker and two voters was moderated by Ari Shapiro.\n\n\u201cWhen we talk about the presidential candidacy, a lot of times they say they don\u2019t feel like you are the voice \u2014 the black voice \u2014 for the black youth,\u201d said education advocate Shanell Dunns. \u201cHow do you respond to not being able to connect to that demographic of youth?\u201d\n\nBooker quipped back, denying the claim that many black voters do not see him as \u201cthe black voice\u201d for black youth.\n\n\u201cWell, No. 1: I think we actually do connect to it. Some of our biggest support is from HBCUs to African American young people who are big activists for our campaign. It\u2019s one of the groups we do very well in,\u201d Booker said.\n\nA recent poll showed Booker trailing several Democrat presidential hopefuls in regards to support from black voters. Those who outrank Booker with support from black voters include former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA).\n\nBooker went on to note his work with the First Step Act.\n\n\u201cSo let my work speak for me,\u201d Booker said. \u201cIn the United States Senate, I\u2019ve pushed more than a dozen bills on these issues that span from police accountability all the way to the bill that I actually got passed \u2026 the First Step Act, which has already led to the liberation of thousands of people, overwhelmingly black and Latino people.\u201d\n\nShapiro then pressed Booker on his record as Newark mayor from 2006 until 2013, specifically the Justice Department\u2019s investigation into the city\u2019s police force, which received \u201cserious allegations of civil rights violations.\u201d\n\n\u201cI inherited the police department with decades-long problems and patterns and practices,\u201d Booker claimed as he responded to Shapiro.\n\nBooker also stated his administration made \u201ctremendous strides\u201d to correct problems within the police force.\n\n\u201cAt first I was like, \u2018Why do I need the DOJ?\u2019 But when they presented us with the data, we saw that we were not moving fast enough to correct the problems,\u201d he added.", "description": "Cory Booker (D-NJ) recently sat down with NPR and discussed his struggle connecting with black voters in America, a struggle he denied.", "authors": ["Kyle Morris"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1171051244-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
