It ensured the Polish striker matched Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang\u2019s Bundesliga record of scoring in each of the first eight games of the season. The former Dortmund striker managed it in 2015. Lewandowski also became the first to score in eight consecutive league games for Bayern since Dutch forward Roy Makaay in 2005.\n\nBayern\u2019s first-half performance was marred by many small mistakes, though both sides missed good chances to score.\n\nGnabry made no mistake four minutes into the second half with a fine individual goal, but the visitors were stunned again by Cordova\u2019s late leveler.\n\nUnion Berlin ended a run of four defeats by beating Freiburg 2-0 at home, Leipzig was held 1-1 at unbeaten Wolfsburg, Hertha Berlin came back to draw 1-1 at Werder Bremen and Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf defeated 10-man Mainz 1-0.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews/com/Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nCiar\u00e1n Fahey on Twitter: https://twitter/com/cfahey/AP\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Alfred Finnbogason scored in injury time to earn Augsburg a 2-2 draw with Bayern Munich and prevent the German champion from reclaiming the top spot in the Bundesliga on Saturday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Ciar\u00e1n Fahey"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/19/germany_soccer_bundesliga_52511_c0-168-4044-2527_s1200x700.jpg?8f4df776a8a4480eeb851f516d5bee9cc4b95236", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
