That included highlighting a past impeachment effort that failed badly.\n\n\u25cf At least four national security officials raised alarms about Ukraine policy before and after Trump call with Ukrainian president.\n\n\u25cf White House political appointees overrode career staffers before freezing Ukraine aid.\n\n\u25cf Two business associates of Trump personal lawyer Giuliani arrested at airport as they tried to leave United States.\n\nThe whistleblower complaint | The rough transcript of Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky |The letter from White House counsel to House leaders\n\n2:10 p.m.: Yovanovitch appearing under a subpoena\n\nHouse investigators said that they issued a subpoena to compel the appearance of Yovanovitch after learning Thursday night that the State Department had directed her not to appear Friday for a voluntary interview.\n\n\u201cThis is the latest example of the Administration\u2019s efforts to conceal the facts from the American people and obstruct our lawful and constitutionally-authorized impeachment inquiry,\u201d three Democratic chairmen said in a joint statement. \u201cAs is required of her, the Ambassador is now complying with the subpoena and answering questions from both Democratic and Republican Members and staff.\u201d\n\nIn the statement, the chairmen also renewed a warning to the White House that preventing witness cooperation \u201cwill be deemed obstruction of a co-equal branch of government and an adverse inference may be drawn against the President on the underlying allegations of corruption and coverup.\u201d\n\nThe statement came from Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), House Oversight and Reform Committee Chairman Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.) and House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot L. Engel (D-N.Y.).\n\n2 p.m.: White House talking points suggest a \u2018serious danger\u2019 Yovanovitch will reveal information without authorization\n\nIn talking points distributed to Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill, the White House suggested arguing that Yovanovitch is in a \u201cprecarious position\u201d because she is appearing for her deposition without State Department lawyers.\n\n\u201cWe are not concerned with any information Yovanovitch might share, because the President did nothing wrong,\u201d the talking points say. \u201cBut we are concerned that Schiff is putting her a precarious position by having her testify in secret without State Department lawyers be present.\n\n\u201cOnly State Department lawyers would be able to provide Yovanovitch with the correct counsel on what is classified or privileged and without that counsel there is serious danger that she could breach her obligations as a current employee not to reveal such information without authorization.\u201d\n\nWhile Yovanovitch was recalled from her post in Ukraine in May, she remains a State Department employee.\n\nThe White House talking points, which were shared by a Republican official, also suggest saying that Schiff is not only acting in complete disregard of Yovanovitch, he is furthering a \u201csham show trial that no one should seek to participate in.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy throwing those protections out the window, Rep. Schiff has shown the world that he is willing to ride roughshod over fair process and to use career officials to further a baseless political objective without any regard for the officials themselves,\u201d the talking points say.\n\n\u2014 Rachael Bade\n\n12:45 p.m.: Pelosi vows Trump \u2018will be held accountable\u2019\n\nIn a letter to House Democrats ahead of a planned conference call Friday, Pelosi touted \u201cincreased outside validation of our efforts\u201d and thanked colleagues for their \u201cseriousness of purpose\u201d during the impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cThe President\u2019s actions threaten our national security, violate our Constitution and undermine the integrity of our elections,\u201d Pelosi wrote to fellow Democrats. \u201cNo one is above the law. The President will be held accountable.\u201d\n\nPelosi pointed to a court ruling Friday as validation of the oversight authority of Congress, which the Trump administration has been resisting. The federal appeals court ruling rejected Trump\u2019s bid to block a House panel from subpoenaing business records from his accounting firm.\n\nPelosi also pointed to a statement this week by 17 former Watergate special prosecutors supportive of the impeachment inquiry, as well as another from conservative lawyers from past Republican administrations.\n\n12:10 p.m.: Trump highlights previous effort to impeach him that failed badly\n\nIn late-morning tweets and retweets, Trump returned to taunting \u201cDo Nothing Democrats\u201d and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) and also highlighted a previous effort to impeach him that failed badly.\n\nAs House investigators were hearing testimony behind closed doors on Capitol Hill, Trump shared a blog post by Fox News host Sean Hannity headlined \u201cFlashback to DEC 2017: 58 Dems Vote to Impeach Trump for Criticizing NFL Anthem Protesters.\u201d\n\nHannity was referring to a December 2017 vote forced by Rep. Al Green (D-Tex.), who introduced articles of impeachment describing Trump as a bigot who incites hate.\n\nGreen\u2019s articles of impeachment cited Trump\u2019s repeated criticism of mostly African American NFL players who knelt during the national anthem as a form of protest against abuse by police officers.\n\nThe articles of impeachment also included references to Trump\u2019s remarks in the aftermath of a deadly white supremacist rally in Charlottesville and his attacks on Rep. Frederica S. Wilson (D-Fla.), an African American lawmaker.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) opposed Green\u2019s measure, which was blocked by a vote of 364 to 58.\n\n12 p.m.: Yovanovitch tells Congress Trump pressured State Dept. to remove her\n\nThe former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine whose abrupt ouster in May has become a topic of interest for House impeachment investigators said Friday that her departure came as a direct result of pressure Trump placed on the State Department to remove her, according to her prepared remarks before Congress obtained by The Washington Post.\n\nYovanovitch told lawmakers that she was forced to leave Kiev on \u201cthe next plane\u201d in the spring and subsequently removed from her post, with the State Department\u2019s No. 2 official telling her that, though she had done nothing wrong, the president had lost confidence in her, and that the State Department had been under significant pressure to remove her since the summer of 2018.\n\nIn explaining her departure, she acknowledged months of criticisms by President Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani, who had accused her of privately badmouthing the president and seeking to protect the interests of Biden and his son who served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company.\n\nYovanovitch denied those allegations and said she was \u201cincredulous\u201d that her superiors decided to remove her based on \u201cunfounded and false claims by people with clearly questionable motives.\u201d\n\nRead more here.\n\n\u2014 Karoun Demirjian, John Hudson and Paul Sonne\n\n11:40 a.m.: Cummings hails court ruling as \u2018resounding victory for Congressional oversight\u2019\n\nHouse Oversight and Reform Committee Chairman Elijah E. Cummings hailed a court ruling Friday related to Trump\u2019s business records as \u201ca fundamental and resounding victory for Congressional oversight, our Constitutional system of checks and balances, and the rule of law.\u201d\n\nThe Maryland Democrat issued a statement following a 2-1 ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit that allows Congress to seek eight years of Trump\u2019s business records from his accounting firm Mazars.\n\n\u201cFor far too long, the President has placed his personal interests over the interests of the American people,\u201d Cummings said. \u201cAfter months of delay, it is time for the President to stop blocking Mazars from complying with the Committee\u2019s lawful subpoena. We must fulfill our stated legislative and oversight objectives and permit the American people to obtain answers about some of the deeply troubling questions regarding the President\u2019s adherence to Constitutional and statutory requirements to avoid conflicts of interest.\u201d\n\n10:45 a.m.: Appeals court rules against Trump in fight with Congress over president\u2019s accounting firm records\n\nCongress can seek eight years of Trump\u2019s business records from his accounting firm, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled Friday in one of several legal battles over access to the president\u2019s financial data.\n\nIn a 2-1 ruling, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit upheld Congress\u2019s broad investigative powers and rejected the president\u2019s bid to block lawmakers from subpoenaing the documents.\n\nThe case is one of several clashes between the Democrat-controlled House and the Republican president over Trump\u2019s data that is expected to reach the Supreme Court. In this case, the judges ruled that Trump\u2019s arguments \u2014 that the subpoenas were invalid because Congress lacked a \u201clegitimate legislative purpose\u201d for its subpoenas \u2014 were incorrect.\n\n\u201cContrary to the President\u2019s arguments, the Committee possesses authority under both the House Rules and the Constitution to issue the subpoena, and Mazars [Trump\u2019s accounting firm] must comply,\u201d Judges David S. Tatel and Patricia A. Millett wrote for the court. Both were appointed by Democratic presidents.\n\nRead more here.\n\n\u2014 Ann E. Marimow, Spencer S. Hsu and David A. Fahrenthold\n\n10:40 a.m.: Trump obfuscates, misleads and exaggerates to make his case against impeachment\n\nTrump\u2019s propensity to mislead, misconstrue and obfuscate is escalating as he confronts the threat of becoming just the third president in U.S. history to be impeached.\n\nFor days, Trump and his allies have repeatedly charged that the whistleblower \u2014 whose complaint about Trump\u2019s call with the president of Ukraine set off the current impeachment inquiry \u2014 made up a \u201cfalse story,\u201d even though many of the claims have been shown to be accurate. The president has insisted that his top Democratic and Republican critics on Capitol Hill should be impeached for their efforts against him, despite a centuries-old precedent that prevents such an action.\n\nAnd White House lawyers this week sent congressional leaders an eight-page letter vowing not to cooperate with the House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry that was laden with imprecise or misleading interpretations of congressional oversight powers and the chamber\u2019s constitutional right to impeach, according to legal experts.\n\nRead more here.\n\n\u2014 Seung Min Kim\n\n10:30 a.m.: Maryland\u2019s Larry Hogan becomes third GOP governor to support impeachment inquiry\n\nMaryland Gov. Larry Hogan is the latest Republican elected official to say he supports the Trump impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cI think we do need an inquiry because we have to get to the bottom of it,\u201d Hogan told Margaret Hoover of PBS\u2019s Firing Line, in an interview that was taped Thursday night and will be aired in full on Friday. \u201cI don\u2019t see any other way to get to the facts.\u201d\n\nThe popular two-term governor said he is \u201cnot ready\u201d to say he supports an impeachment or a removal of the president, but thinks an inquiry of his conduct is warranted. House Democrats launched an inquiry just over two weeks ago, focusing on Trump\u2019s pressure on the Ukrainian president to investigate Biden and his son.\n\nHogan joins fellow Republican Govs. Phil Scott (Vermont) and Charlie Baker (Mass.) in backing an investigation. But Hogan, who is term-limited and decided against a primary challenge to Trump earlier this year, also raised concerns about the process moving forward.\n\nRead more here.\n\n\u2014 Ovetta Wiggins\n\n10:10 a.m.: Yovanovitch arrives for deposition\n\nMarie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, arrived at the Capitol for a scheduled closed-door deposition in front of three House committees.\n\nShe did not answer questions from reporters as she entered the building.\n\nUp until the time of her arrival, there was uncertainty about whether the White House or State Department would try to block her testimony.\n\n8:50 a.m.: Sondland to appear for deposition next week, lawyers say\n\nU.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland will appear for a deposition next week under subpoena in the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry but cannot turn over documents requested by investigators, his lawyers said Friday.\n\nThe State Department blocked Sondland from appearing before the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight and Reform committees on Tuesday with an overnight order not to show. Democrats subsequently issued a subpoena for his testimony, and later that day the White House informed Democratic leaders they had no intention of cooperating with the investigation.\n\n\u201cNotwithstanding the State Department\u2019s current direction to not testify, Ambassador Sondland will honor the Committees\u2019 subpoena, and he looks forward to testifying on Thursday,\u201d Sondland\u2019s lawyers said in a statement. \u201cAmbassador Sondland has at all times acted with integrity and in the interests of the United States. He has no agenda apart from answering the Committees\u2019 questions fully and truthfully.\u201d\n\nThe lawyers, Robert Luskin and Kwame Manley, said that State Department regulations prohibit Sondland from producing documents concerning his official responsibilities and that the department has the \u201csole authority\u201d to do so.\n\n\u201cAmbassador Sondland hopes the materials will be shared with the Committees in advance of his Thursday testimony,\u201d they added.\n\nSondland was one of a handful of U.S. diplomats who facilitated Trump\u2019s interactions with Ukrainian leaders, according to a trove of text messages that former U.S. special envoy Kurt Volker provided to House investigators last week. Messages that were released publicly show that the administration sought a promise from Ukrainian leaders to investigate the 2016 election and the energy firm, Burisma, that had paid Hunter Biden to sit on its board.\n\n\u2014 Karoun Demirjian\n\n8 a.m.: Trump heading to another campaign rally on Friday night\n\nTrump is scheduled to leave the White House shortly after 4 p.m. and head to Lake Charles, La., where thousands of supporters are expected for another campaign rally on Friday night.\n\nDuring a rally Thursday night in Minneapolis, Trump leveled some of his most personal attacks yet against Biden and his family, highlighting unsubstantiated claims about his potential 2020 rival\u2019s son and using profanity to describe Biden\u2019s tenure as vice president.\n\nAmong other things, Trump mocked Hunter Biden\u2019s personal problems, including his discharge from the Navy after he tested positive for cocaine use.\n\n\u201cHunter, you know nothing about energy, you know nothing about China, you know nothing about anything, frankly,\u201d Trump said to a near-capacity crowd. \u201cHunter, you\u2019re a loser.\u201d\n\nJoe Biden went on Twitter after the rally, referring to his appearance at a town hall hosted by the Human Rights Campaign and CNN on LGBTQ issues.\n\n\u201cI spent my night at the HRC forum talking about the fundamental respect every human being deserves,\u201d Biden tweeted. \u201cYou spent yours showing how little respect for anyone else you have. America is so much stronger than your weakness, @realDonaldTrump.\u201d\n\nBefore leaving Washington Friday afternoon, Trump is scheduled to have photos taken with Little League championship baseball and softball teams and meet with Chinese Vice Premier Han Zheng.\n\n7 a.m.: Former ambassador to Ukraine scheduled for deposition Friday morning\n\nYovanovitch is expected to be deposed at 10 a.m. by House investigators Friday as part of the ongoing impeachment inquiry, despite the White House\u2019s stated objections and refusal to cooperate with the Democratic-led proceedings.\n\nYovanovitch was confirmed as ambassador to Ukraine in August 2016, but recalled in May, after conservative activists \u2014 including Giuliani \u2014 accused her of being biased against Trump. State Department officials have said the accusations against the career diplomat are baseless.\n\nShe is one of several current and former diplomats that the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight committees have identified as witnesses in their probe into whether Trump pressured Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate his political rivals.\n\nThe panels have issued subpoenas to the White House, Giuliani and two business associates, and several Cabinet-level officials, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Secretary of Energy Rick Perry, Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper and the acting director of the Office of Management and Budget, Russell T. Vought, requesting materials related to the administration\u2019s interactions with Ukraine.\n\nBut to date, the panels have recorded only one deposition \u2014 with former special U.S. envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker, who quit his post hours after he was requested to appear for a deposition.\n\nRead more here.\n\n\u2014 Karoun Demirjian\n\n6:45 a.m.: New revelations about Trump test Pelosi\u2019s narrow impeachment strategy\n\nRecent revelations about Trump\u2019s conduct are testing the limits of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s narrow impeachment strategy, leading some Democrats to wonder whether the probe should be expanded beyond the Ukraine scandal.\n\nSince House Democrats launched their impeachment inquiry just over two weeks ago, Pelosi (D-Calif.) and her top lieutenants have coalesced around a plan to focus on Trump\u2019s pressure on the Ukrainian president to investigate Biden, a 2020 presidential candidate, and his son Hunter.\n\nThe episode, Democrats argue, is clear-cut, easy for Americans to understand and doesn\u2019t require further proof as the White House has released a rough transcript of the call.\n\nBut a spate of allegations about other possible abuses have led some Democrats to rethink the strategy.\n\nRead more here.\n\n\u2014 Rachael Bade\n\n6:40 a.m.: George Conway takes shot at Giuliani\n\nGeorge Conway, the conservative lawyer and spouse of White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, took a shot at Giuliani on Friday, referring to the arrests this week of two of his associates on charges they schemed to funnel foreign money to U.S. politicians while trying to influence U.S.-Ukraine relations.\n\n\u201cRudy 1986 would have indicted Rudy 2019 in a New York minute,\u201d Conway tweeted.\n\nIn 1986, Giuliani was a federal prosecutor, serving as U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York.\n\nHis two associates, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, who had been helping Giuliani investigate Biden, were arrested Wednesday evening at Dulles International Airport outside Washington, where they had one-way tickets on a flight out of the country, officials said.", "description": "House investigators are hearing from one key witness in the impeachment inquiry on Friday as another bucked the State Department and agreed to testify next week under subpoena.", "authors": ["John Wagner", "National Reporter Leading The Post'S Breaking Political News Team", "October At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/EG_3I5PszfOH27G6lYA6wdwf-H0=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JCLJY7HLVEI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
