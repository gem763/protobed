The audit firm also must fully detail its work to the company\u2019s audit committee in writing.\n\nIn several cases, PwC mischaracterized nonaudit work as audit services to auditor committees, the SEC said. The firm failed to adequately review and monitor whether audit clients\u2019 audit committees had approved the nonauditing services it was providing, the SEC said.\n\nThe frequency of PwC\u2019s alleged improper conduct over that period could be part of a systemic industry problem, Michael Shaub, an accounting professor at Texas A&M University\u2019s Mays Business School, said in an interview. \u201cTrust probably builds between the auditor and the audit committee and, over time, it leads to sloppiness,\u201d Mr. Shaub said.\n\nThe alleged violation of auditor independence rules involves one unnamed company in 2014. PwC made decisions over the implementation and design of an audit client\u2019s financial-statement software, thus violating rules that prohibit an independent auditor from performing management functions.\n\nMr. Sprankle, who is based in California and has been a partner at PwC since 2014, agreed to a $25,000 civil money penalty and suspension from practicing or appearing before the SEC. He can apply for reinstatement after four years.\n\nMr. Sprankle continues to serve as a partner at the firm, a PwC spokesperson said.\n\nA PwC spokesman added that the company is \u201cpleased to have resolved this matter and remains committed to continuous improvement.\u201d The firm said it would continue to add additional processes and controls to maintain independence. In the coming months, PwC said it would submit two reports on detailed audit policies and its plans to evaluate them, the SEC said.\n\nPwC has strengthened its internal controls since 2014, including reviewing and recommending services around internal controls, risk management and related systems, a spokesperson for the firm said.\n\nThe SEC declined to comment beyond the release and orders.\n\nPwC earlier this year reached a $335 million settlement with Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. over its audits of Colonial Bank.\n\nWrite to Mark Maurer at mark.maurer@wsj.com", "description": "The allegations of improper conduct were in connection to a total of 19 engagements with 15 unidentified companies over a three-year period ending in 2016.", "authors": ["Mark Maurer"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-110059/social", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
