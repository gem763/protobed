I think it is much healthier to do that in a decentralised way,\u201d he says\n\nCostello tells Chanticleer he never actually said the Future Fund itself should run multiple accounts. In a speech delivered two years ago Costello said the federal government should set up an entity that he labelled the Super Guarantee Agency which could contract out its funds management to the Future Fund Management Agency.\n\nCostello said: \"There would be huge economies of scale. It would end the fight between the industry and the profit sector over who gets the benefit of the default funds.\"\n\nRussell argued that Australians lacked trust in government run institutions.\n\nBoards of directors ought to be as keen as Frydenberg's review panel to get to know Russell given his strong views about environmental, social and governance issues. Not surprisingly, Russell is not a supporter of the negative views about \u201csocial issues\u201d expressed by Ben Morton, assistant minister to the prime minister and cabinet.\n\n\u201cWhen AustralianSuper is talking to companies we are very much focused on the long-term investment that we have with these companies,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cWe absolutely see the need for us to make sure that companies have arrangements to deal with all the ESG-type risks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt is true that part of the benefits of scale give our investment team the capacity to take positions in businesses, not just here in Australia but around the world.\n\n\u201cThat's an extra degree of freedom that our investment teams have that comes with scale.\n\n\u201cBut, again, we are doing that because we think that they are a good investment that we can do better than others and that we can deliver returns for our members that we would not be able to get if we invested somewhere else.\n\n\u201cSo, I see AustralianSuper as part of the competitive process that Australian companies are on the ball in terms of managing risks appropriately and that they are on the ball in terms of managing the assets appropriately.\u201d\n\nFiduciary duty\n\nWhen it comes to climate change Russell believes the trustees of super funds in Australia have a fiduciary duty to ensure companies they invest in are addressing the risks caused by global warming.\n\n\u201cWe are a long-term investor and so we are very interested in the capacity of the companies that we invest in to go on delivering good returns to the members,\u201d he says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cA lot of the issues that companies now have to grapple with are issues which have a material impact on the capacity of the company to operate effectively in the future.\n\n\u201cIn a sense there are all these range of issues that companies need to be focused on because of the risks they carry for the future profitability of the business itself.\n\n\u201cIn fact, the regulators here \u2013 APRA and the Reserve Bank \u2013 have a focus on the duties that directors have to make sure that the companies and business they are responsible for actually have in place strategies and response to the effect of climate change.\n\n\u201cIt's part and parcel of what the regulators see as their duties to make sure that the directors are taking it seriously. AustralianSuper is very much in the same position. We want to invest in companies that we are confident have taken account of how their business will respond or be affected by climate change.\n\n\u201cThat conversation is an important conversation that AustralianSuper has to have just to be able to say to our members that we have safeguarded their interests and are doing our best to ensure that the companies we invest in not only are going to be able to deal with climate change, but have a strategy which will enable them to actually do that in a successful manner.\u201d", "description": "AustralianSuper chairman Don Russell says former Treasurer Peter Costello's idea of making a government -run default fund for super savings makes no sense.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.7936%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_140/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/b84a5ff736e16980bb998498ae88d58ae057c67f", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
