Can they earn their first win of 2019 and avoid going 0-2 to two bitter division rivals? Here\u2019s what to watch for:\n\nOpponent: Dallas Cowboys (1-0)\n\nWhere: FedEx Field, Landover, Maryland\n\nWhen: Sunday, Sept. 15, 1 p.m.\n\nTelevision: Fox\n\nRadio: The Team 980, ESPN 630AM\n\nWhat to watch for:\n\n- Adrian Peterson will make his season debut after Derrius Guice underwent surgery to repair his meniscus. The backfield has produced an unexpected amount of dramatics early on this year after Peterson was deactivated for Week 1. Coach Jay Gruden said after Washington\u2019s loss they\u2019d find a use for Peterson \u201cif we have a game where we think we can run the ball 55 times in the I formation.\u201d Whoops \u2014 now the future Hall of Famer will be the RB1 while Guice heals.\n\n- The defense gave up 25 points in the second half to let the Eagles come from behind and win 32-27. This week is no easier task, as the Redskins face an offense starring Dak Prescott, Ezekiel Elliott, Amari Cooper and Jason Witten. If Washington gets out to an early lead again, will there be another collapse or will the D protect the advantage?\n\n- Sunday is Washington\u2019s home opener, and after overall attendance dropped last year, naturally there are questions about how many fans will attend the game and how many will be sporting burgundy and gold. The Cowboys have a strong contingent of fans in the D.C. area that usually make themselves at home at FedEx Field once a year. But when the Cowboys visited in 2018, the Redskins won 20-17.\n\nPre-game reading:\n\nLosing their home-field advantage took years of ineptitude, but the #Redskins did it, @thomloverro writes. https://t.co/UyjEm02Sqj \u2014 WashTimes Sports (@WashTimesSports) September 13, 2019\n\n\n\nJay Gruden called #Redskins receiver Terry McLaurin the \u201cno. 1 special teams player\u201d in the draft. McLaurin set his goals much higher. @Matthew_Paras\u2019s story: https://t.co/SW2YtuVRkP \u2014 WashTimes Sports (@WashTimesSports) September 13, 2019\n\n\n\nICYMI: Derrius Guice undergoes surgery for meniscus tear #Redskins https://t.co/EJSArX1fTW \u2014 WashTimes Sports (@WashTimesSports) September 13, 2019\n\n\n\nSunday\u2019s loss boiled down to two simple post-halftime #Redskins realities: A defense that can\u2019t get off the field and an offense that can\u2019t stay on it.
