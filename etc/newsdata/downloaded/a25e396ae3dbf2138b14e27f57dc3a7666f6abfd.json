But this couldn\u2019t be further from the truth, in fact, face oils will hydrate, moisturise and give your skin a powerful hit, more than most creams do, due to their liquid consistency.\n\nOils work in a different way to creams and lotions and are some of the best products for treating not only very dry or flaky skin, but also oily and combination skin types. The right facial oils will moisturise without creating a greasy texture and will help regulate and maintain your skin\u2019s natural oil barrier by balancing sebum production.\n\nAt night time in particular, it\u2019s important to use more nourishing oils that work in tandem with the skin\u2019s natural nightly repair mode, especially if you\u2019re getting less than eight hour\u2019s shut-eye, which unfortunately is the case for most of us.\n\nOlder skin will especially benefit from introducing a face oil at night, as the skin tends to be thinner, drier and lacklustre as skin ages. These evening face oils will not only create a sense of calm and balance, thanks to their sleepy scents, but also work hard on your skin to ensure you wake up with a luminous glow, no matter how sleep-deprived you may be \u2013 or feel.\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews.

Well, here\u2019s your answer. One of our favourite beauty brands, Elemis, has based a range of its skincare on the principle that our skin follows natural circadian rhythms, creating waves of activity which trigger cells to perform certain processes at specific times of the day, with repair and renewal being boosted during the night. With this in mind, Elemis has combined perilla seed oil, omega 3, vitamin E and anti-oxidants to deliver a powerful burst to tired and ageing skin. Plus, it has a pleasant smell and sinks into the skin immediately, leaving no greasy residue on your pillowcase.
