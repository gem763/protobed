The video in question is the latest episode of PewDiePie's running series of meme commentary, where he mentioned the pro-democracy protests happening in Hong Kong.\n\n\"I got banned from China. That's right,\" PewDiePie said in his video from Friday. \"If you search anything PewDiePie related on any Reddit-related forum in China, or YouTube-related videos, it will just be completely blank.\"\n\nA snapchat from PewDiePie's video that he uses to illustrate his ban in China.

References to Winnie the Pooh \u2014 including a recent Disney film featuring the character \u2014 have been largely censored in China, especially as the bear has become a notable figure once again during the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong.\n\nPewDiePie seemed to take a great deal of pleasure in being banned in China, and said he \"knew it was going to happen.\" Popular DJ Zedd tweeted at PewDiePie to welcome him to the club: Zedd said he was banned in China earlier this month for liking a tweet about South Park, a show that itself is heavily censored in the country for being critical.\n\nIt's not exactly clear what the \"ban\" on PewDiePie exactly means. YouTube, where PewDiePie's content lives, has been blocked in China since 2009 behind the government's \"Great Firewall\" of internet censorship. Nevertheless, PewDiePie still maintains a Chinese fanbase, many of whom use VPNs, software that cloaks the source of internet activity, to skirt China's restricted internet.\n\nReddit users who are supposedly in China (Reddit is OK there) have said that online forums and social platforms have been scrubbed of posts and messages about PewDiePie. However, others have pointed out that searching for PewDiePie online, including via China's search engine Baidu, still yield results.", "description": "PewDiePie drew similarities between Chinese president Xi Jinping to Winnie the Pooh, a comparison made by many pro-democracy Hong Kong protesters.", "authors": ["Paige Leskin"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5dade342cc4a0a0a565d34b5?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
