In 1994, the park was listed by UNESCO as among World Heritage Sites in danger.\n\n\u201cThe invasion began in August (2018). In December, it accelerated,\u201d said Hubert Mulongoy, the park spokesman.\n\nAt least three people have been killed in clashes between the Pygmies and park rangers, although the circumstances of the deaths remain unclear.\n\nIn Munyange village on the edge of the park, Pygmy chief Jean-Marie Kasula said his community had simply \u201cdecided to return to our land in strength\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been suffering for 48 years,\u201d he said. \u201c(\u2026) This is our Eden!\u201d\n\nThe interview was abruptly cut short by Kasula when he angrily rejected questions he deemed \u201cpolitical.\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u2018Manipulation\u2019 \u2013\n\nUnderpinning his response is a complex story involving powerful men and long-standing resentment, mixed with a high-octane election year in 2018.\n\nThe park\u2019s management say a community of about 6,000 Pygmies living on the edge of the park have been egged on by influential figures in the region.\n\nArmy officers, provincial ministers, members of the provincial legislature and traders were outraged when a new park director, De-Dieu Bya\u2019Ombe Balongelwa, set about closing their farms, located deep inside the park, after his appointment in April last year.\n\n\u201cThere were armed men on the farms. These were purely military operations,\u201d Balongelwa told AFP.\n\n\u201cThe farmers vowed to use every means to undermine us. Using the Pygmies to come and destroy the park is one of them,\u201d said the director, who is given round-the-clock protection by two armed rangers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve done what others didn\u2019t dare do.\u201d\n\nMarine Gauthier, a university academic and consultant in forestry management, said it was \u201cplausible\u201d that the Pygmies were being manipulated, \u201cbut that doesn\u2019t detract from their long-standing and genuine anger.\u201d\n\nPark authorities say some Pygmies are among the ranks of the rangers and are doing what they can to ease the conflict.\n\nThe deforested zone is a tiny slice of the protected terrain \u2014 a tropical highland treasure almost the size of Delaware, extending over 6,000 square kilometres (2,300 square miles).\n\nThe park reaches up to neighbouring North Kivu and Maniema, largely lawless provinces where militia violence, poaching and illegal traffic in minerals are rampant.\n\n\u2013 People and poverty \u2013\n\nBut the conflict and the chopping down of trees affect the showcase region of the park: its higher ground that is home to gorillas accessible to the well-heeled visitors, who typically number about 2,000 a year.\n\nThe front line is scarcely an hour\u2019s drive from the provincial capital Bukavu, located in a densely populated region like everywhere on the shores of Lake Kivu.\n\nThe demographic pressure is apparent all the way to threatened land in the park.\n\nResidents cut down trees and burn wood on the spot to make \u201cmakala\u201d (charcoal) \u2014 the sole source of fuel for many rural Congolese, who are extremely poor and have no access to electricity.\n\nOn a stripped tract of land, women flee at the sight of rangers, running with heavy bags of makala, which they can sell for the equivalent of $20.\n\nWith journalists looking on, chief ranger Chadrack Kasereka spoke firmly to the women.\n\n\u201cI told them to stop illegal activities in the park,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have been told to pass on the message.\u201d", "description": "KAHUZI-BIEGA NATIONAL PARK (RD Congo) (AFP) \u2013 Aged almost 17 years, Bonane is an eastern lowland gorilla, a survivor in a critically endangered", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/13/4f87a5_gorillas-dwindled-250-in-park-sanctuary-high-stakes-conflict-threatens-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
