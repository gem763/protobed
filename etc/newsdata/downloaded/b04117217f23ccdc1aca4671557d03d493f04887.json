The waiting can feel so long.\n\nThis was your second time around; did you feel more comfortable, and how did the previous experience help you?\n\nI felt very comfortable this time around. In my audition this year I wasn't nervous at all.\n\nWhat was your favourite performance?\n\nMy favourite performance was Malokazi because I got good feedback from the judges.\n\nIs there a song that you wish you could have performed before you left?\n\nThe one song that I wished I could have performed is Listen by Beyonc\u00e9.\n\nWhat are you going to take away from this experience?\n\nWhat I have taken away from this experience is confidence, confidence, confidence.\n\nTune in to Idols SA Sundays at 17:00 on Mzansi Magic (DStv 161).\n\n\n\nCompiled by Leandra Engelbrecht.\n\n\n\n(Photos supplied: Mzansi Magic)", "description": "Nqobile Gumede reached the end of her 'Idols SA' journey in the latest episode of the reality show.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7900/0a5f68d44d174408b8600657bcfeced6.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
