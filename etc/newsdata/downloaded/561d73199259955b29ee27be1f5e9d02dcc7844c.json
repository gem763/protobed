UPDATE 1-Canada's Liberal party promises net-zero carbon emissions by 2050\n\nBy Moira Warburton\n\nTORONTO, Sept 24 (Reuters) - Canada's Liberal party committed to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 if re-elected in next month's federal election, and will beat the current 2030 emissions goal with its plan, the party said in a release on Tuesday.\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau's party will \"help workers prepare for a clean energy transition,\" the release said.\n\nTrudeau and the Liberals face a difficult reelection campaign, with a resurgent Green party on the left and in the wake of a blackface scandal which has soured voters towards him.\n\nAlthough Trudeau's government implemented a national carbon tax, he has faced harsh criticism from climate-focused voters, particularly in British Columbia on Canada's west coast, for purchasing the Trans Mountain pipeline from Kinder Morgan (NYSE: ) to ensure its construction.\n\nThe net-zero announcement comes just days after thousands protested for action on climate change, including in cities across Canada, with more strikes planned for Friday.\n\nNet-zero carbon emissions means that some sectors could still pollute, but their carbon would be offset by other measures.\n\nThe Liberal press release notes that many other governments, including the European Union, have already made a commitment to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.\n\n\"It is time for Canada to join governments and leading businesses around the world ... in order to further tackle the worsening climate crisis,\" Environment Minister Catherine McKenna said.\n\nThe Liberal plan also includes setting legally binding five-year milestones and appointing a group of scientists and economists to advise on the path to a net-zero economy.", "description": "Liberal party promises net-zero carbon emissions by 2050", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEA9M12S_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
