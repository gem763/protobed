A place in the Rugby World Cup semifinals. An unprecedented seven straight wins over its bitter rival.\n\nFor England and its jubilant fans, days do not get much better than this.\n\nMaking it worse for the Wallabies, an Australian masterminded the entire thing.\n\n\"At this moment,\" said England coach Eddie Jones, when asked if he had any sympathy for his native country, \"there's not a lot of sympathy. No.\"\n\nA humiliating 33-13 loss to Australia at the 2015 World Cup contributed to England's pool-stage exit in the tournament it was hosting and led to the hiring of Jones, who was tasked with getting the world's wealthiest rugby union back on track.\n\nGame-defining period\n\nThis was the biggest game of his tenure and he nailed it.\n\nStrong in defence and clinical in attack, England scored four tries to one and displayed the kind of mental resilience the team has lacked in recent years under ones.\n\nAustralia, which led 3-0 after a dominant first 15 minutes, reduced the deficit to 17-16 with a converted try soon after halftime. England responded with 10 points in the next five minutes in a game-defining period at Japan.\n\nNext for England is a semifinal match against New Zealand, the defending champion and the world's top-ranked team, in Yokohama\n\nThe Wallabies failed to reach the semifinals for only the third time in nine editions of the World Cup, and each of their quarter-final losses have come against England.\n\nIndeed, the English are going through a period of unprecedented dominance over their old foes, having won their last seven matches against Australia since the 2015 World Cup.\n\nThis latest win equaled the record margin of victory, 24 points, which also came under Jones, a 30-6 win in 2017 at Twickenham.\n\nNew Zealand 46, Ireland 14\n\nIt's one thing to beat the All Blacks in Chicago or Dublin. It's an entirely different challenge at the Rugby World Cup, where they feel right at home.\n\nTwo-time defending champion New Zealand scored seven tries in a 46-14 demolition of Ireland on Saturday in Tokyo to move into a semifinal against England, which beat Australia 40-16 earlier in Oita, Japan.\n\nThe result was virtually beyond doubt by halftime, when the All Blacks led 22-0, and the continuance of two opposing streaks seemed certain.\n\nNew Zealand extended its unbeaten run at the World Cup since an upset quarter-final loss to France in 2007. Ireland is now 0-8 in World Cup knockout games.\n\nScott Barrett of New Zealand, right, wins the line-out over Ireland\u2019s Peter O'Mahony in their quarter-final match at the Tokyo Stadium on Saturday.
