Mere days later, on Monday, the two were seen strolling arm-in-arm through a Venetian piazza, equipped with the staples of a romantic getaway: a camera that is not on a phone and cigarettes. A source told E! News that the couple \u201clooked comfortable together and walked close. They checked out little tourist stands and were chatting the entire time. They walked down narrow alleyways and let their shoulders bump. They never stopped holding hands.\u201d Except in the image above, perhaps because one of them (Pete?) had an itch.\n\nThe couple has been in Italy since at least Friday, when they attended the premiere of Qualley\u2019s new film, Seberg, at the Venice Film Festival. Davidson was not on the red carpet, but he was seen seated directly behind Qualley at the screening. So we know at least that the relationship is moving at a rate too fast for VIP-seating charts to comprehend. Us Weekly reported that on Sunday, the two dressed up and got in a water taxi \u201claughing together as they headed out for the evening.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Mega Agency\n\nLast week, a source told Us Weekly that \u201c[t]hey\u2019ve been seeing each other for a couple of months and Margaret is really excited about him.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m haunted by the image of Qualley and Davidson\u2019s shoulders begrudgingly touching in a flagrant display of affectionate torsos, but otherwise this seems nice!", "description": "New couple Pete Davidson and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood actress Margaret Qualley traveled to Venice, Italy.", "authors": ["Hannah Gold"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/09/03/03-pete-davidson-margaret-qualley-lede.w1200.h630.jpg"}
