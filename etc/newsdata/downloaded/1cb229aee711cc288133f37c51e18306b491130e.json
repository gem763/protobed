It\u2019s time to hit back hard. Extreme measures invite extreme responses, and given his determination to push through a no-deal Brexit, alongside Michel Barnier\u2019s confirmation that the backstop is non-negotiable, the door must now be open to justifiably Revoke Article 50 to bring back calm to the nation, protect the unity of the UK, safeguard our economy and put a stop to his absurd spending on the biggest Tory white elephant of all time.\n\nBrexit should never have gotten this far given its entirely speculative and unfounded origins, the muddled mix of lies and issues introduced into the 2016 campaign, and the repeated attacks on our democracy launched by a series of extreme right MPs.\n\nA properly elected PM would be putting his or her head on the block with conduct of this kind, let alone an unelected, pompous, arrogant \u201clittle big man\u201d with delusions of grandeur, and a penchant for a \u201clittle Britain\u201d style of kingdom, alongside an endless squandering of wealth borne of our hard work through years of unwarranted, Tory-imposed austerity.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nArticle 50 should be revoked at once, pending a full investigation into the behaviour of this atrocious and vile self-serving party and its mini-me leadership.\n\nLeading people requires a measure of decency and integrity. Leading a great nation demands much more besides.\n\nThis bunch have no more integrity than the dead kipper Johnson tried to deceive us with.\n\nRevoke, hold them to account, and put the Brexit issue to a properly informed, confirmatory referendum, with a view to whatever measured steps are then deemed most conducive to fulfilling its proper mandate.\n\nThis shabby Tory party should be outlawed as an enemy to the state.\n\nTolerance has proper boundaries too.\n\nMichael Cunliffe\n\nIlkley\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Will voters listen to these voices from the past and reward Conservatives for their dishonesty? Will they look back and remember what they have witnessed: a group of people who put themselves and their party before the country, whose actions may well destroy the Union with Scotland and Northern Ireland and condemned most of us to a poorer future? Or will they \u201ctake back control\u201d and vote for true change and get rid of them once and for all?\n\nJohn Simpson\n\nRoss on Wye\n\nWe voted for no-deal Brexit\n\nThe MPs who are trying to stop no deal by saying that the people who voted for Brexit did not vote for no deal are wrong. In the leaflet sent to every household by the government at a cost of \u00a39m, the people were told by the government that in effect we would have no trade deal with the EU if we left the EU.\n\nQuote \u201cThe Government judges it could result in 10 years or more of uncertainty as the UK unpicks our relationship with the EU and renegotiates new arrangements with the EU and over 50 other countries around the world.\u201d\n\nWe were advised to accept the deal that David Cameron had negotiated with the EU. This would suggest that in voting to leave the EU the people voted for no deal.\n\nBen Johnson\n\nAddress supplied\n\nRestoring democracy\n\nYour editorial argues that only a final say in another referendum will restore democracy. When the Liberal Democrats, among others who campaign for a second referendum, have explicitly stated that they will not accept the result if the vote is again to leave the EU, it is difficult to see how this will bring matters to a conclusion.\n\nJulian Gall\n\nGodalming\n\nLiar, liar\n\nI share some of John Rentoul\u2019s reservations about the press using the terms \u201clie\u201d or \u201cliar\u201d, and agree that the facts should speak for themselves. However, the press could do a lot more to make sure those facts were clear.\n\nThe notion of balance does not mean finding one person to say something is true and another to say it is not, when it manifestly is not true. By all means avoid imputing motives when a politician tells an untruth, but do shout from the rooftops that it *is* untrue, and back up the assertion with checkable references.\n\nRachael Padman\n\nNewmarket\n\nHong Kong protests\n\nThe brutality dealt to the people of Hong Kong by police as they courageously and tenaciously demonstrate for their freedom has exposed the terror, cruelty and male violence (as well as all-pervasive surveillance and politically motivated arrests) that underpins the Xi dictatorship in China.\n\nGenevieve Forde\n\nAotearoa, New Zealand", "description": "Boris Johnson is kicking our democracy in the head relentlessly and without any conscience.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/08/30/19/boris-johnson-gesture.jpg"}
