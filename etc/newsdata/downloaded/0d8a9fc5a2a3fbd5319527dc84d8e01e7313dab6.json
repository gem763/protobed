All told, more than two-thirds of the consumer goods the United States imports from China now face higher taxes. The administration had largely avoided hitting consumer items in its earlier rounds of tariff increases.\n\nBut with prices of many retail goods now likely to rise, the Trump administration\u2019s move threatens the U.S. economy\u2019s main driver: consumer spending. As businesses pull back on investment spending and exports slow in the face of weak global growth, American shoppers have been a key bright spot for the economy.\n\n\u201cWe have got a great economy,\u201d said Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa. \u201cBut I do think that the uncertainty caused by volatile tariff situation and this developing trade war could jeopardize that strength, and that growth, and that is I think that\u2019s a legitimate concern,\u201d he told ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d\n\nAs a result of Trump\u2019s higher tariffs, many U.S. companies have warned that they will be forced to pass on to their customers the higher prices they will pay on Chinese imports. Some businesses, though, may decide in the end to absorb the higher costs rather than raise prices for their customers.\n\nIn China, authorities began charging higher duties on American imports at midday Sunday, according to employees who answered the phone at customs offices in Beijing and the southern port of Guangzhou. They declined to give their names.\n\nTariffs of 10% and 5% apply to items ranging from frozen sweet corn and pork liver to marble and bicycle tires, the government announced earlier.\n\nAfter Sunday\u2019s move, 87% of textiles and clothing the United States buys from China and 52% of shoes will be subject to import taxes.\n\nOn Dec. 15, the Trump administration is scheduled to impose a second round of 15% tariffs \u2014 this time on roughly $160 billion of imports. If those duties take effect, virtually all goods imported from China will be covered.\n\nThe Chinese government has released a list of American imports targeted for penalties on Dec. 15 if the U.S. tariff hikes take effect. In total, Beijing says Sunday\u2019s penalties and the planned December increases will apply to $75 billion of American goods.\n\nWashington and Beijing are locked in a war over U.S. complaints that China steals U.S. trade secrets and unfairly subsidizes its own companies in its drive to develop global competitors in such high-tech industries as artificial intelligence and electric cars.\n\n\u201cI give the president credit for challenging China on some of its really egregious behavior\u201d on intellectual property and technology transfers, for example, Toomey said. He said he hopes that\u2019s what Trump\u2019s focus is, \u201cnot just the fact that Chinese clothing and shoes are popular among consumers. That\u2019s not the problem.\u201d\n\nIf China changes its behavior \u201cin a meaningful way in that area ... then we will have ended up in a better place. That\u2019s what I\u2019m hoping for. But let\u2019s be honest. In the meantime, we\u2019re doing damage. It\u2019s a double-edged sword,\u201d he said.\n\nTo try to force Beijing to reform its trade practices, the Trump administration has imposed import taxes on billions of dollars\u2019 worth of Chinese imports, and China has retaliated with tariffs on U.S. exports.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing taking on China. Unfortunately, he\u2019s done it the wrong way,\u201d said AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo take on China there has to be a multilateral approach. One country can\u2019t take on China to try to dry up its overcapacity because they just send it through to you in other ways,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump has insisted that China itself pays the tariffs. But in fact, economic research has concluded that the costs of the duties fall on U.S. businesses and consumers. Trump had indirectly acknowledged the tariffs\u2019 impact by delaying some of the duties until Dec. 15, after holiday goods are already on store shelves.\n\nA study by J.P. Morgan found that Trump\u2019s tariffs will cost the average U.S. household $1,000 a year. That study was done before Trump raised the Sept. 1 and Dec. 15 tariffs to 15% from 10%.\n\nThe president has also announced that existing 25% tariffs on a separate group of $250 billion of Chinese imports will increase to 30% on Oct. 1.\n\nThat cost could weaken an already slowing U.S. economy. Though consumer spending grew last quarter at its fastest pace in five years, the overall economy expanded at just a modest 2% annual rate, down from a 3.1% rate in the first three months of the year.\n\nThe economy is widely expected to slow further in the months ahead as income growth slows, businesses delay expansions and higher prices from tariffs depress consumer spending. Companies have already reduced investment spending, and exports have dropped against a backdrop of slower global growth.\n\nAmericans have already turned more pessimistic. The University of Michigan\u2019s consumer sentiment index, released Friday, fell by the most since December 2012.\n\n\u201cThe data indicate that the erosion of consumer confidence due to tariff policies is now well underway,\u201d said Richard Curtin, who oversees the index.\n\nSome retailers may eat the cost of the tariffs. Target confirmed to The Associated Press that it warned suppliers that it won\u2019t accept cost increases arising from the China tariffs. But many smaller retailers won\u2019t have the bargaining power to make such demands and will pass the costs to customers.\n\nPhilip Levy, chief economist at the San Francisco freight company Flexport who was an adviser in President George W. Bush administration, said it\u2019s hard to say for sure when the latest tariffs may hit U.S. customers in the form of higher prices.\n\nBut, he added, \u201cIf you had to pick a time to do it, this is the worst possible time\u201d because it\u2019s when the bulk of holiday goods are brought into the country.", "description": "The United States and China on Sunday put in place their latest tariff increases on each other\u2019s goods, potentially raising prices Americans pay for some...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HO933_china__ZG_20190807063911.jpg"}
