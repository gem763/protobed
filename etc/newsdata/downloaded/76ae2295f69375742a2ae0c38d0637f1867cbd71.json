That's down 40,000 b/d from its September estimate.\n\nThe group, which consists of some of the world's most powerful oil-producing nations, kept its forecast for 2020 in line with last month's projections. It expects world oil demand to grow by 1.08 million b/d next year.\n\nThe report comes as the U.S.-China trade war continues to cloud prospects for the global economy and fuel demand.\n\nHigh-level negotiators from the world's two largest economies will resume trade talks on Thursday, seeking to secure a breakthrough to end their long-running dispute.\n\nHowever, China, the world's largest importer of oil, has tempered expectations for a trade resolution.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has said tariffs on Chinese imports will increase on October 15 if no progress is made in this week's bilateral trade negotiations.", "description": "The move is likely to add to growing pressure on the producer group to impose a deeper round of supply cuts at its December meeting.", "authors": ["Sam Meredith"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105589530-1542972752856bp.jpg?v=1542972927", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
