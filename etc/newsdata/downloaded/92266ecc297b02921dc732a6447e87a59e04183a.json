They said they\u2019re intent on finding something with more teeth.\n\nRepublican leaders were noncommittal on the resolution, saying they\u2019re looking to hear more from the Trump administration first \u2014 though they made clear they\u2019re not happy with how the president\u2019s moves have played out.\n\n\u201cThis violence needs to end,\u201d said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who called the escalating clash \u201ccompletely unacceptable.\u201d\n\nCongress was away on a two-week vacation when the president late on Oct. 6 announced a snap withdrawal of the several dozen U.S. troops who had been stationed in Syria, where they were assisting Kurdish forces in fighting Islamic State rebels and holding Islamic State captives.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan saw Mr. Trump\u2019s move as a green light to invade northern Syria and do battle with the Kurds, who he sees as enemies. The U.S. considers both sides to be allies, putting Mr. Trump in a tricky spot, made all the stickier by reports that Islamic State fighters have staged jail breaks and Russia and Iran are eyeing the chance to make their own gains.\n\nMr. Trump now says he feels betrayed by Mr. Erdogan\u2019s moves and has tried to re-cork the bottle, saying U.S. troops will remain in the Middle East to keep a lid on the situation.\n\nHe said Thursday he\u2019s sending Vice President Mike Pence to Turkey for emergency negotiations.\n\nBut Mr. Trump is also intent on fending off Congress\u2019s desire to get more involved.\n\nHe imposed new sanctions this week on Turkey and said there\u2019s more where that came from should Mr. Erdogan not cease and desist.\n\n\u201cThey ship a lot of steel to the United States. They make a lot of money shipping steel. They won\u2019t be making so much money,\u201d he warned at the White House Tuesday.\n\nMembers of Congress, many of whom used to be fans of sanctions over military action, said the president\u2019s sanctions won\u2019t cut it this time.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer said Congress needs to vote this week to rebuke Mr. Trump and demand he reverse his policy.\n\nHe and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi revealed a bipartisan resolution faulting Mr. Trump.\n\nMr. Schumer said it will be a major test for Republicans.\n\n\u201cThey will have far more success in getting the president to reverse course and change his views,\u201d the New York Democrat said. \u201cThey know it\u2019s dangerous. Are they still going to be afraid to criticize President Trump?\u201d\n\nThe resolution is being sponsored by Reps. Eliot Engel, a Democrat, and Michael McCaul, a Republican, and Sens. Robert Menendez, a Democrat and Todd Young, a Republican.\n\n\u201cI think we clearly need to send a message as a country that what the Turks have done is unacceptable,\u201d Mr. Young said. \u201cAt the same time that needs to be balanced against any dynamic that might be created and further push the Turks to align with other countries.\u201d\n\nOne prominent name was not listed as a sponsor: Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican who has been a close ally of Mr. Trump\u2019s on a number of fights but who has been critical of the president for withdrawing the troops.\n\nHe said he\u2019s working with Mrs. Pelosi on a new sanctions bill, though she said Tuesday he\u2019s gotten \u201ca little weak\u201d in his language.\n\nMr. Graham now says he blames Turkey, not Mr. Trump, for what went wrong. Mr. Graham told Fox News that Mr. Erdogan lied to him two weeks ago about his intentions in the region.\n\nMr. Graham said far from a green light, Mr. Trump cautioned Mr. Erdogan to be restrained in whatever actions he did take in Syria.\n\nHe said he was on a phone call with Mr. Trump and Mr. Erdogan Monday and the Turkish leader promised to keep his forces from Kobani, an area held by the Kurds, to prevent an escalation.\n\n\u201cMore to follow,\u201d Mr. Graham told reporters.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear, though, how many of his fellow Republicans are ready to back him.\n\nSome took a wait-and-see approach to what they work out, while others said they\u2019re certain they can\u2019t support it.\n\n\u201cLindsey Graham\u2019s been wrong about almost every foreign policy decision of the last two decades,\u201d Sen. Rand Paul, Kentucky Republican, said in an interview on CNN.\n\nHe said if Congress really wants to have U.S. troops get involved, it should vote to declare war and make the case to the public that it\u2019s in the national interest.\n\nThere were no takers for that proposal on Capitol Hill Tuesday.\n\n\u2022 Dave Boyer contributed to this article.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
