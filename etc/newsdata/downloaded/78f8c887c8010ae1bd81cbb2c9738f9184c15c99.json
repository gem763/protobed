It allows us to draw a line under these issues.\"\n\nIt was a badly needed victory for Mr Albanese, whose fledgling authority was being undermined the longer Mr Setka held out.\n\nPush has created powerful enemies\n\nLabor sources believed the broader public would welcome Mr Albanese prevailing over Mr Setka, who is an intimidating character.\n\nInternally, the push has created powerful enemies in the party's industrial left union base which is still fuming over Labor's support this week for free trade agreements with Peru, Indonesia and Hong Kong.\n\nHeavyweights within the CFMEU, including national secretary Michael O'Connor, the Maritime Union of Australia and the Electrical Trades Union have always been sceptical of Mr Albanese as leader but have become increasingly confrontational and vocal in their criticisms of him.\n\nLabor's support for the FTAs and their perceived weakening of labour protections have over the past week seen Mr O'Connor publicly threaten to disrupt ALP conferences and ETU Victorian secretary Troy Gray accuse Mr Albanese of failing as a leader.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJacqui Lambie is still demanding John Setka must resign as head of the CFMEU. Alex Ellinghausen\n\nUnion sources said Mr Setka had himself grown increasingly unhappy in the last few weeks and believed Mr Albanese was using him as a distraction from answering internal union criticisms.\n\nMr Setka said defiantly that he would remain as secretary of the Victorian division of the union, a move which presents a broader risk to the union movement.\n\nThe government is all but assured of receiving Senate crossbench support for its controversial Ensuring Integrity Bill which will facilitate the deregistration of rogue unions and officials, and enable union mergers to be blocked.\n\nSenator Lambie has long been threatening to vote for the bill unless Mr Setka resigns as head of the union and she said on Wednesday that his decision to quit Labor was not enough.\n\n\"She wants him to resign from his position as the head of the CFMEU,'' her spokeswoman said.\n\nIndustrial Relations Minister Christian Porter said Mr Setka was only part of the problem with the CFMEU.\n\n\"If Mr Albanese was serious about wanting to rid Labor of rogue union thugs, he should stop the Labor party taking money from Mr Setka\u2019s union,'' he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Whilst wanting to rid his own party of the thuggery and intimidation of one of the CFMEU\u2019s leaders, Mr Albanese is still willing to inflict this behaviour on Australian workplaces.\"\n\nDeputy Labor leader Richard Marles dismissed this.\n\n\"John Setka doesn't define the CFMEU. This was about John Setka. And his relationship to the CFMEU is a matter for them. But the CFMEU is a much bigger organisation than just one person.\"\n\nA 'betrayal of working Australians'\n\nMr Albanese, who initially had Mr Setka suspended but struggled to expel him, said he would always stand up for the rights of trade unions but so, too, would he defend the values of the Labor party.\n\n\"Through his actions he demonstrated values that were not consistent with the values which the Australian Labor Party holds dear,'' Mr Albanese said.\n\n\"One of those values is respect for women. The fact he has been convicted of breaching a family violence order and the fact that he was also convicted and pleaded guilty to harassment indicates that that is the case.\n\n\"There has also been a range of activity in breach of both the Victorian rules of the ALP and the values of the Australian Labor Party. \"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn angry Mr Setka accused Mr Albanese of a smear campaign that was \"based on a lie that he denigrated family violence campaigner Rosie Batty at the National Executive meeting''.\n\n\u201cEnough is enough. I can no longer ignore the effect this is having on my family, along with Anthony Albanese\u2019s betrayal of working Australians and the core values of the Labor party and union movement.\u201d\n\nHe claimed his decision was personal and was motivated by disdain for Mr Albanese's leadership, including Labor's recent decision to support the FTAs.\n\n\u201cThe core values on which the Labor Party was built have been totally eroded under Mr Albanese\u2019s leadership and I cannot support him as a member of the ALP any longer,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Setka said Mr Albanese\u2019s \"betrayal of working Australians\" culminated last week with his support for the free trade agreements.\n\n\u201cThis is a complete betrayal of working Australians who will lose jobs to foreign workers as a result,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt was the last straw for me and a sign of just how far out of touch Mr Albanese is with our fundamental principles.\u201d", "description": "John Setka's resignation from the Labor Party has failed to appease Senate crossbencher Jacqui Lambie who says she will vote for a bill making it easier to deregister rogue unions and officials.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2286%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_31/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/5069d2b5694c296c7460ba0b79a7c94d067d1161", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
