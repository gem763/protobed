Their careful removal and the construction of a new home for them are likely to further delay the monument and add considerably to the final costs of a project that is already hugely over budget and behind schedule.\n\nThe budgetary committee of the Bundestag recently approved extra funding for the monument, bringing the costs up to \u20ac17m from an original sum of \u20ac10m.\n\nThe decision to build the monument to freedom and unity was made by the Bundestag in 2007. It was supposed to be completed in time for the 30th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall next month, but there is now considerable doubt as to whether even a later date \u2013 3 October 2020, three decades after the reunification of East and West Germany took place \u2013 can be met.\n\nThe bowl of the winning design, by the architects Milla & Partner, is to be inscribed with the words, \u201cWir sind das Volk, wir sind ein Volk\u201d\u2013 we are the people, we are one people, echoing the rallying cry of demonstrators in former East Germany in the months leading up to the fall of the Wall.\n\nThe appeal to move the bats came from the Nature Protection Association, Nabu, who took legal action in an attempt to halt the project. They argue that the Daubenton\u2019s bats, Myotis daubentonii, have turned the pedestal of the monument, on which the tilting bowl is supposed to sit, into both their summer and winter quarters. Once the bats have been removed, they advised that a tarpaulin should prevent them from re-entering the pedestal.\n\nAs well as being found a new place to live, the bats will also require a suitable hunting ground.\n\nAccording to a report in the Tagesspiegel newspaper, conservationists are hoping some or all of a 600-metre stretch of the River Spree will be renaturated, at an estimated cost of more than \u20ac1m, to provide a new habitat and a sufficient supply of insects on which the bats can live.\n\nMilla & Partner dispute that the bats are still in the pedestal, arguing that they have already moved to the wooded area of Pl\u00e4nterwald in the east of Berlin, driven out by the noise and artificial lighting at the memorial construction site.", "description": "Removal and rehoming of rare species is likely to hamper project already beset by delays", "authors": ["Kate Connolly"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd5c6cd9693d0e34d03459069f9ab220dd080657/0_192_3072_1842/master/3072.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8e35bb2fa3cb6aabc739917bb4a94f18", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
