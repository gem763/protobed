In the days since, the takes have been coming in hot. On Twitter, the reaction seems to fall into twocamps: It\u2019s either a near-perfect masterpiece, or it\u2019s a dangerous manifesto for radical and lonely white men who may look to Arthur Fleck\u2019s deranged descent into the Joker of comic-book lore as heroic instead of villainous.\n\nThe reality is that the film \u2014 and most of its thoughtful critiques \u2014 falls somewhere in between. Joker is an impressive cinematic achievement, featuring an extraordinary (albeit a tad exhibitionist) performance by Joaquin Phoenix as Fleck, and it\u2019s a poisonous story for a fraught time. Did we really need a brutal movie about a white terrorist figure who uses gun violence to enact revenge on the society that rejects him? And did we need it now?\n\nI think the answer to that question is no. Ultimately, Joker is a story that empathizes with a violent sociopath. Fleck is a clown-by-hire and aspiring comedian living with his mother. The most ironic and tragic cruelty of his life is that he\u2019s got a condition that causes him to laugh maniacally at inappropriate times.He is bullied and beat up \u2014 by a group of kids on the street, his coworkers, some rich suits on the subway \u2014 and the film uses these encounters to explain his murderous origins. \u201cJoker is the antihero the alienated and angry have been waiting for, and that\u2019s precisely the problem,\u201d wrote Sarah Hagi in a column about the film for the Globe and Mail. \u201cI do yawn at the idea of another story in which white men are offered a sort of understanding for their violence.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s exactly why I couldn\u2019t enjoy the film, even though I concede that it\u2019s really well done. The message that \u201cwell, of course he became a mass murderer, society gave him no choice!\u201d is dangerous on its own. But if you consider the larger social context of turning \u201ca supervillain into a kind of folk hero\u201d in a world where Dylann Roof, Elliot Rodger, and Faisal Hussain exist, it\u2019s even more distressing.\n\nUnfortunately for women who write things on the internet, threats come to with the gig, particularly when the thing you are writing about is comic book movies.\n\nIn response to her piece, Hagi received emails with subject lines including \u201ca white dude\u2019s feedback on your Globe review\u201d and ones that accused her of \u201chating white people\u201d and \u201cracism against whites.\u201d (Hagi is a Black Muslim woman.) Writer Kayleigh Donaldson shared her thoughts via Twitter about Phoenix\u2019s performance and was the subject of nasty comments calling her criticism \u201cuseless\u201d and making fun of her for getting paid to give her opinion on movies. Tonja Ren\u00e9e Stidhum\u2019s piece on the Black culture site The Root also received a slew of inappropriate comments.\n\nThe fact that critics \u2014 mostly women \u2014 are facing the wrath of Joker fans who are already invoking the fanboy venom we\u2019ve become accustom to (see: Star Wars) doesn\u2019t surprise me. Unfortunately for women who write things on the internet, threats come to with the gig, particularly when the thing you are writing about is comic book movies. In Hagi\u2019s case, being called a \u201creverse racist\u201d (a thing that does not exist) is nothing new for critics of color, especially women critics of color. But it\u2019s still infuriating. One reader didn\u2019t understand why Hagi brought up race at all in her essay. Remember, Joker\u2018s narrative focuses on a white dude\u2019s pain. (Even though he gets a Black \u201clove interest\u201d in the enigmatic Zazie Beetz.) The argument that identity politics shouldn\u2019t be discussed over a film that director Todd Phillips describes as a \u201ccharacter study\u201d and is literally a two-hour exploration of one man\u2019s identity is preposterous.", "description": "Joker had its North American premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival on Monday.
