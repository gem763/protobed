She won all her races last year and won in Dubai this year.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of Group One winners this time, but she has beaten nearly all of them. She is the best.\u201d\n\nAfter five Group One wins in a row \u2013 including the Japan Cup and the Dubai Turf \u2013 the darling of Japanese racing came unstuck in June\u2019s Yasuda Kinen (1,600m) after suffering interference early in proceedings.\n\nBut Lemaire is confident that third-placed finish will be nothing but a distant memory come Sunday afternoon.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s coming off a lay-off but I think she\u2019ll perform very well,\u201d he said. \u201cShe knows her work and does it easily but I did feel her relax a bit at the end of work this week, so I used the whip [for that reason] and also because I wanted to check her gait after the finish line.\n\n\u201cLast week she\u2019d been a bit winded, but not this week. I think she was at about 80 per cent [for her work in the mornings]. She\u2019ll give that extra 20 per cent for the race and that will make quite a difference.\u201d\n\nAlmond Eye proved 12 months ago she has no trouble performing at the top level after an extended stint in the paddock, winning the Group One Shuka Sho (2,000m) after five months away from the track.\n\n\u201cShe returned from time off for the Shuka Sho and won that. In the Yasuda Kinen, other than the start it was a very good race. If we hadn\u2019t had to struggle for position at the start in that, I think we definitely would have won,\u201d Lemaire said.\n\nAlmond Eye is entered for the Mile and the Cup at December\u2019s Hong Kong International Races and connections have suggested she will either defend her crown in the Japan Cup in late-November or make the trip to Sha Tin.\n\nWin Bright takes the HK$24 million FWD QEII Cup!

It\u2019s possible she\u2019ll improve a bit after the Tenno Sho,\u201d he said. \u201cI think she was in the best condition for the Japan Cup [last preparation].\u201d\n\nOf the challengers, the Katsuhiko Sumii-trained Saturnalia \u2013 a two-time Group One winner over 2,000m \u2013 looks the most likely to extend Almond Eye\u2019s losing streak, while 2018 Japanese Derby winner Wagnerian and Danon Premium are also in the market.\n\nAlso in the race is Win Bright, who took out this year\u2019s Group One QE II Cup (2,000m) at Sha Tin as a rank outsider.", "description": "Almond Eye hasn\u2019t raced in nearly five months and comes off an unexpected loss at her last start but jockey Christophe Lemaire has no doubt about what will unfold in Sunday\u2019s Group One Tenno Sho Autumn (2,000m) at Tokyo Racecourse....", "authors": ["Sam Agars", "Tom Biddington", "Trenton Akers"], "top_image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_image_scmp_generic/public/d8/images/methode/2019/10/26/2b6ee036-f7b7-11e9-87ad-fce8e65242a6_image_hires_151524.JPG?itok=-Rm0h9x5&v=1572074131", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
