House Democrats also have threatened legislation that would block big tech companies from getting into banking.\n\nIt should not be the role of a private company to try to get a sovereign currency like a sovereign state. \u2014 French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire\n\nWaters has called Libra \"a new Swiss-based financial system\" that potentially is too big to fail and could require a taxpayer bailout.\n\nFrench Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Wednesday that the EU should not allow Facebook to develop the currency project on \"European territory\" because it threatens the monetary sovereignty of member countries.\n\n\"It should not be the role of a private company to try to get a sovereign currency like a sovereign state,\" Le Maire said.\n\nUnlike digital currencies such as bitcoin or Ethereum, Facebook's plan calls for Libra to be backed by real currencies.\n\nDavid Marcus, the Facebook executive leading the project, told lawmakers over two days of congressional hearings in July that Facebook would not launch the currency project until it had received all the necessary approvals from regulators and secured safeguards to protect the privacy of users' data.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarcus said Facebook will not control Libra because Facebook will be only one of about 100 companies and nonprofits in an association that will manage the currency. Earlier this week, Paypal said it was going to pull out of the project.\n\nThe plan would open low-cost online commerce to millions of people around the world who lack access to bank accounts, and would make it cheaper to send money across borders, Marcus said. He did not agree to a suspension of the plan or a pilot project, as several lawmakers urged.\n\nFacebook, with nearly 2.5 billion users worldwide, is under heavy scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators following a series of data privacy scandals, including lapses in opening the personal data of millions of users to President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign.\n\nThe Justice Department, the Federal Trade Commission and the House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee are all conducting investigations of Facebook and the other big tech companies amid accusations of abuse of their market power to crush competition.\n\nZuckerberg had three days of private meetings in Washington last month with Trump and several lawmakers who, like the president, are critics of the tech industry.\n\nHe also met with the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee to discuss ways to prevent foreign actors from disrupting next year's elections. In a separate session, Zuckerberg told the leaders of the House Judiciary Committee that the company would cooperate with their antitrust investigation.\n\nZuckerberg last testified to Congress in the spring, when he was questioned about privacy, election interference and other issues.\n\nAAP", "description": "Congress has summoned Mark Zuckerberg to discuss concerns about Facebook's new planned cryptocurrency and the social media giant's market power.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4898%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_483%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/38b4d710084f7e94e93ffa4d2d1810c01011a3c5", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
