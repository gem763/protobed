Trump said in tweets \u201cI informed John Bolton last night that his services are no longer needed at the White House. I disagreed strongly with many of his suggestions, as did others in the Administration, and therefore ... I asked John for his resignation, which was given to me this morning.\u201d\n\nBolton however insisted he had resigned, saying in a counter-tweet: \u201cI offered to resign last night and President Trump said, \u2018Let\u2019s talk about it tomorrow\u201d. He then sent a flurry of texts to media outlets including Fox News and The Washington Post maintaining that he had left of his own accord.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nBolton\u2019s fall is being viewed as a victory for Mike Pompeo. The two men had differed vocally and increasingly on a number of issues including talks being held with the Taliban and the attempted detente with Kim Jong-un of North Korea.\n\nJust after the national security adviser\u2019s departure, Pompeo was happy to acknowledge: \u201cThere were definitely places that Ambassador Bolton and I had different views about how we should proceed\u201d. Later a smiling secretary of state told journalists: \u201cI\u2019ll leave it to the president to talk about the reasons he made the decision but I but I would say this, the president\u2019s entitled to the staff that he wants.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

But the president and his national security adviser were always going to be a difficult fit.\n\nBoth were Vietnam draft dodgers, but Bolton was a superhawk, one of the orchestrators of the Iraq invasion, calling for regime change in a swathe of countries he deemed to be America\u2019s enemies. Trump, however, is not a war president and many of his supporters are isolationists who blamed the sending of US forces into Iraq and Afghanistan on the Washington establishment.\n\nBolton had advocated overthrowing the governments of Iraq, Iran, North Korea, Syria, Venezuela, Yemen and Cuba. But, crucially he has, at the same time, been sceptical about what Trump declares to be his great foreign policy triumph, his supposed detente with Kim Jong-un.\n\nBolton, one can argue, was right in saying that Trump had got little out of the North Korean regime after his two summits with Kim, but that is not what the president wanted to hear and Pompeo, who had carried out much of the shuttle diplomacy with Pyongyang, also felt aggrieved.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Trump, however, wanted a peace deal he would declare as a victory and one that would enable him to bring the troops home. Pompeo, for his part, had backed the talks, even though he was said to have disagreed with the proposed draft settlement which emerged at Doha from US envoy Zalmay Khalilzad.\n\nFor Trump, the centrepiece of his Afghan success was going to be a Camp David meeting between the Afghan president Ashraf Ghani and Taliban leaders. Bolton had opposed the summit and had reportedly argued forcefully about it with the president.\n\nAt the end Trump declared that he was abandoning the peace talks after a Taliban car bombing in Kabul which killed an American soldier and 11 other people. But, according to White House officials, the president remained angry at what he saw as his national security adviser undermining one of his flagship initiatives.\n\nIran was one arena on which the two men could be expected to be in sync. Trump had pulled the US out of the nuclear pact of international states with Tehran: an agreement with which the other signatories - Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China - as well the United Nations and western intelligence agencies stressed was working.\n\nHowever, despite the instigation of Israel and a Saudi-led Sunni bloc to militarily confront Iran, Trump had pulled back from the point which could lead to an armed clash with Iran. He has also been talking increasingly of the possibility of a face-to-face meeting with the country\u2019s president, Hassan Rouhani.\n\nBolton, who had once declared he would celebrate regime change in Tehran in 2019, was for continuing to ratchet up pressure on Iran. Israel has been urging the US administration not to negotiate with the Iranians at this stage and Benjamin Netanyahu flew to London last week to lobby Vice President Mike Pence and defence secretary Mark Esper, who were on a visit to the UK, not to hold talks.\n\nEsper, however, told a journalists in London that he favoured dialogue with Iran and backed an initiative towards this by Emmanuel Macron. Pompeo subsequently stated that he could foresee a meeting between Rouhani and Trump at the UN general assembly later this month.\n\nBolton had been recommended for the job of UN ambassador to Trump at the beginning of his presidency particularly because of his empathy with the Israeli right, according to Michael Wolff in his book Fire and Fury.\n\nRoger Ailes, the former Fox News chairman and longtime Trump adviser, is said to have told the president: \u201dHe is a bomb thrower and a strange little fucker. But you need him, who else is good?\u201d\n\nTrump, however, decided that the face did not fit. He did not like Bolton\u2019s walrus moustache. Steve Bannon, his former chief strategist recalled: \u201cThe moustache is a major problem. Trump doesn\u2019t think he looked the part.\u201d\n\nAiles had acknowledged while pressing for his candidate that \u201cBolton had got in trouble in the past because he got in a fight in a hotel one night and chased some woman\u201d in Moscow in 1994. Bannon apparently quipped: \u201cIf I told Trump that, he might have got the UN job.\u201d\n\nThe UN job went to Nikki Haley, who has also since left the Trump team. Bolton eventually got his job in the White House after Trump\u2019s second national security adviser, Lieutenant General HR McMaster, resigned.\n\nBolton has now gone, having found out that the president may have learned to tolerate the moustache, but would not tolerate someone who regularly challenged his world view.
