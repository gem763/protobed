A penetration tester will report the vulnerable entry point to a company, so they can patch it, while an attacker would exploit the vulnerability for malicious purposes.\n\nAn uninvited pen-test\n\nSecurity researchers like Nux carry out these penetration tests because companies like AT&T have bug bounty programs through which they invite this type of traffic being aimed at their applications.\n\nThe FBI does not have a bug bounty program, nor does it invite such pen-tests.\n\nBy redirecting the penetration test to the FBI's Tips portal, AT&T had effectively put researchers in a position where they'd be launching uninvited penetration tests at a US government's website.\n\n\"The [pen-test] traffic is 100% legit so it would look like a real attack,\" Marcus J. Carey, CEO at penetration-testing firm Threatcare, told ZDNet in an online conversation this week.\n\n\"These are legit researchers looking for vulnerabilities using standard and custom tools. It's a long shot but there could be a legit exploit reflected through AT&T that compromises the FBI.\"\n\nAT&T has removed the redirection over the weekend after ZDNet reached out last week. A spokesperson did not return additional requests for comment. The FBI did not want to comment.\n\n\"This surely shouldn't be a standard practice,\" Carey told ZDNet. \"I'm confident that the FBI is not cool with attacks being forwarded to their servers.\"\n\nMisunderstandings happen all the time\n\nThis entire situation looks silly and some sort of joke on the part of AT&T's IT staff, rather than something malicious.\n\nHowever, misunderstandings happen all the time, especially when authorities have to deal with security researchers. There have been numerous cases in the past when legitimate security researchers have been misunderstood and mistreated by law enforcement.\n\nFor example, in May 2016, security researcher David Levin was arrested for disclosing vulnerabilities in the US election website. In January 2017, Justin Schafer was raided and detained by the FBI after he reported to a healthcare entity that they were exposing FTP servers with patient data.\n\nIn July 2017, a Hungarian teen was arrested for reporting vulnerabilities in Budapest's public transport e-Ticket system. Just this month, two security researchers were arrested in Iowa for breaking into a courthouse as part of a physical penetration test, even if they had all their paperwork authorizing the test.", "description": "Exclusive: Security researcher gets a nasty surprise while hunting for bugs on AT&T's websites.", "authors": ["Catalin Cimpanu"], "top_image": "https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/12/20/c3651d8f-429d-425d-8bd0-297c674ee7a1/thumbnail/770x578/22f4f9ce42b35160bb976833dc8f4379/at-t-lab.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
