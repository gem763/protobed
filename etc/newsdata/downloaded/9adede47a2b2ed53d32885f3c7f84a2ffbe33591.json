USA TODAY\n\nMINNEAPOLIS \u2013 President Donald Trump has repeatedly boasted that he plans to flip the blue state of Minnesota in 2020, and to try to prove his point he's headed to the Democratic bastion of Minneapolis Thursday for his first campaign rally since House Democrats launched an imppeachment inquiry against him.\n\nMinneapolis, a sanctuary city known for its left-leaning politics, is also home to Rep. Ilhan Omar, a Somali-born freshman lawmaker the president has repeatedly lashed out at on Twitter and cast as the one of the faces of the Democratic party.\n\nOmar, who won 78% of her district in 2018, enjoys wide support in her hometown of Minneapolis. The city is preparing to greet the president by holding a massive protest outside Target Center in downtown Minneapolis, where he will speak Thursday.\n\nThe president's rally comes a day after a Fox News poll released Wednesday night that found 51% of voters support impeaching Trump impeached and removing him from office, a new high since the House began an impeachment inquiry into allegations he pressured Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter.\n\nTrump weighed in on the poll Thursday, saying \"Whoever their Pollster is, they suck.\"\n\nThousands are expected to attend the Minneapolis protest, which will center on fighting Trump's anti-immigration policies and what critics see as divisive rhetoric, according to Giselda Guiterrez, an organizer with Minnesota Immigrant Rights Action Committee (MIRAC), which is coordinating the demonstration with other local activist groups. She expects a large turnout among the city's diverse community.\n\nIIhan Omar, a member of AOC Plus 3, will win us the Great State of Minnesota.

But no smear will ever stop me from working toward what I\u2019m in Congress to do:\n\n\n\n\u2705 Pass Medicare for All\n\n\u2705 Raise the minimum wage\n\n\u2705 Repeal the Muslim ban\n\n\u2705 Enact a Green New Deal\n\n\u2705 Impeach Trump \u2014 Ilhan Omar (@IlhanMN) October 10, 2019\n\nTrump:: As Turkey pounds Syria, Trump downplays ties to Kurds: 'They didn't help us in the Second World War'\n\nBut the battle for Minnesota began well before Omar was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 2018. Minnesota, which hasn't elected a Republican president since Richard Nixon in 1972, narrowly voted for Hillary Clinton by 1.5% in 2016. Trump, who lost by a margin of 44,000 votes, has indicated he thinks he can close that gap in 2020.\n\nAccording to Republican National Committee (RNC) officials, the campaign has built out a training program since 2016 that counts nearly 1,000 local volunteers across the state as part of the Trump Leadership Victory Initiative. Republicans have focused much of their attention on rural parts of Minnesota, where the GOP flipped two congressional seats during the 2018 midterm election.\n\nRep.

The venue, Target Center, tried to pass off the bill to the Trump campaign, which responded by threatening to sue for breach of contract. Trump weighed in on the fracas on Twitter on Tuesday, calling the mayor \"lightweight\" and calling on his supporters to \"dump\" both Frey and Omar.\n\nThe lightweight mayor is hurting the great police and other wonderful supporters. 72,000 ticket requests already. Dump Frey and Omar! Make America Great Again! https://t.co/ibTqvSbsbn \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 8, 2019\n\nAccording to the Trump campaign, the Target Center withdrew its request to pay security fees upfront. Trump supporters stormed the mayor's office Wednesday to protest the cost of the event.\n\nThe president also took issue with a recent Minnesota Police Department policy change barring off-duty officers from wearing uniforms to political events. The police union responded by designing \"Cops for Trump\" shirts that officers plan to wear and sell at the event.\n\n'Sea of red':Minnesota police barred from wearing uniforms to Trump rally\n\nWinning Minnesota would be an uphill battle for the president. Trump's net approval ratings have dropped from +3 in January 2017 to -11, according to Morning Consult.\n\nLocal Minneapolis resident James Allison said he's not convinced by the numbers just yet.\n\n\"I've talked to a lot of people who have voted Democratic or typically vote Democratic, and they're voting for Trump this time around,\" the 38-year-old said. \"There's a whole host of reasons that people are voting for him, but hate and fascism are not among them.\"\n\nBut Jackie Craig, who works with Women's March Minnesota and plans to attend Thursday's protest, said she believes his strategy in Minnesota isn't working.\n\n\"I think he's actually bringing people closer together, and people here more understanding of each other's differences and supporting one another,\" she said. \"And that diversity and inclusiveness will be on display outside the rally.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/10/10/donald-trump-rally-ilhan-omars-minneapolis-district/3901543002/", "description": "Ahead of his visit Minneapolis, Donald Trump has amplified his attacks on Rep.
