My brain only sees earface man and 1/2 droopy face girl. Great wedding,' another wrote sarcastically.\n\nMany people speculated about how the wedding day went down for the unknown couple.\n\nDragged: Reddit users couldn't wrap their heads around the edited photo, with some calling it reminiscent of having a 'fever dream'\n\nOne person mocked, 'Do you, Earface, take Tinychin to be your lawfully wedded wife, promising to love and cherish, through joy and sorrow, sickness and health, and whatever challenges you may face, for as long as you both shall live?'\n\nThe general consensus was that people could not 'decipher' how the couple were left looking so different from their human selves.\n\nCountless Reddit commentors even said they had been 'staring' at the photograph trying to understand it.\n\nOne person even drew parallels to optical illusions where you have to figure out what an abstract image is trying to depict.\n\n'I can semi decipher the groom, but the bride I can't figure it out. And usually I'm good at seeing both items in those 'is it a witch or young woman?' Vase or whatever else the item is. Lol,' a user said.\n\nOthers just seemed confused as to why a couple would pay for their wedding photos to look this way.\n\nMajor confusion: While everyone had different things to say, the general consensus was one of confusion and bemusement\n\n'Who signed off on this? Were they blind and lied to? This is hilarious,' said one person.\n\n'Can you do our wedding photos? It'll count as your wedding gift - plus you'll get lots of exposure! Not a problem,' joked another.\n\nSomeone else added, 'This picture is terrifying. It's the stuff of nightmares. Someone paid for this??'\n\n'Now that I've laughed and looked at this long enough was it possible they were going for a Tim Burton theme here,' questioned one person.\n\nAnother said that they had seen a similar character in the movie Men in Black.\n\nThe viral photo comes just days after a Canadian couple became the talk of the internet after posing for an ill-judged The Handmaid's Tale photo shoot.\n\nThe photo of Kendra Munro and Torsten Mueller, who live in Cambridge, Ontario, where The Handmaid's Tale is filmed, spread like wildfire after it was shared by the photographers - and not in a good way.\n\nSocial media users slammed the now-infamous images for 'missing the point' of the show and they were widely condemned online.", "description": "An unknown couple became the talk of Reddit when their wedding photo made it on to a thread.
