Reporter: Tim Scott, the senate's only African-American Republican, said he didn't think the president's use of the term was racially charged, but -- I get his absolute rejection of the process. I wouldn't use the word lynching. Reporter: And listen to what senate majority leader Mitch Mcconnell told our Mary Is that how you would characterize this inquiry, as a lynching?
