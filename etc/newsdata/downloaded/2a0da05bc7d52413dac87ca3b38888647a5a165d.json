Such militias have become a fixture here with Iran's rising influence. They sometimes operate in conjunction with Iraqi security forces but they retain their own command structures.\n\nThe Iraqi security sources told Reuters that the leaders of Iran-aligned militias decided on their own to help put down the mass protests against the government of Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi, whose one-year-old administration is backed by powerful Iran-backed armed groups and political factions.\n\n\u201cWe have confirmed evidence that the snipers were elements of militias reporting directly to their commander instead of the chief commander of the armed forces,\u201d said one of the Iraqi security sources. \u201cThey belong to a group that is very close to the Iranians.\u201d\n\nA second Iraqi security source, who attended daily government security briefings, said militia men clad in black shot protesters on the third day of unrest, when the death toll soared to more than 50 from about half a dozen. The fighters were directed by Abu Zainab al-Lami, head of security for the Hashid, a grouping of mostly Shi\u2019ite Muslim paramilitaries backed by Iran, the second source said. The Hashid leader was tasked with quashing the protests by a group of other senior militia commanders, the source said. The sources did not say how many snipers were deployed by militia groups.\n\nA spokesman for the Hashid, Ahmed al-Assadi, denied the groups took part in the crackdown. \u201cNo members were present in the protest areas. None of the elements of the Hashid took part in confronting protesters,\u201d al-Assadi said in a statement to Reuters.\n\nIraqi Interior Ministry spokesman Saad Maal said state security forces did not fire directly at protesters and blamed unnamed \u201cvicious\u201d shooters for the mass deaths and injuries. The government has opened an investigation to determine who shot the protesters and who ordered it, Maal said in a news conference on Oct. 6.\n\nThe assertion that security forces did not participate in the violence seemed to contradict an earlier statement on Oct. 14 from the Iraqi government, which admitted state security forces had used excessive force and promised to hold individuals accountable for violence against civilians.\n\nAn official with the prime minister\u2019s office said in a statement to Reuters Wednesday that it would be \u201cpremature to lay the blame on any parties, whether from Hashid or other security forces, before we end the investigation. Let\u2019s wait and see who gave the order \u2018shoot to kill.\u2019\u201d\n\nIran\u2019s role in responding to the demonstrations was another reminder of Tehran\u2019s reach in Iraq, where a sizable number of former militia commanders are now members of parliament and support the Iranian agenda. Stability of the Iraqi government is in the best interests of Iran, which has been steadily amassing influence in Iraq since 2003, when the U.S.-led invasion toppled the Islamic Republic\u2019s arch-enemy Saddam Hussein. Iran is Iraq\u2019s biggest trading partner.\n\nIran's delegation to the United Nations did not immediately respond Wednesday afternoon to questions from Reuters about its support of militias and their involvement in the violence against protesters. Leaders of militias in Iraq have denied getting training and weapons from Iran.\n\n\n\n\n\nSNIPERS ON ROOFTOPS\n\nAs protests entered their third day, on Oct. 3, snipers appeared on Baghdad rooftops. A Reuters cameraman who was covering the unrest near Baghdad\u2019s Tahrir Square that afternoon said he saw a sniper, wearing a balaclava and dressed in black as he stood on top of an under-construction building that overlooked the demonstrations.\n\nProtesters fled as the sniper opened fire. One protester who was shot in the head was carried away in a large crowd. Another who was shot in the head appeared to have died and was rushed off in a truck. When his phone rang, a friend recognized that the man\u2019s brother was calling.", "description": "Iran-backed militias deployed snipers on Baghdad rooftops during the Iraq\u2019s deadliest anti-government protests in years, two Iraqi security officials told Reuters.
