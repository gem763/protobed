Book vendors are selling an average 19,800 copies of the Constitution every month since Trump became president in January 2017, The NPD Group, a market research company, said Tuesday.\n\nThat monthly average is more than double the average monthly sales during the Democratic administration of Barack Obama\u2019s first term (7,500 sales) and more than triple the monthly sales during the Republican administration of George W. Bush\u2019s second term (5,600).\n\n\u201cCurrent year-to-date sales are more than 50,000 units higher than at any point in the terms of both Barack Obama and George W. Bush, and we still have more than two months left in 2019,\u201d said Kristen McLean, books industry analyst, NPD Bookscan.\n\n\u2018Current year-to-date sales are more than 50,000 units higher than at any point in the terms of both Barack Obama and George W.

Constitution sales spiked the day Trump earned the Republican nomination in July 2016, when he was elected in November 2016 and during his January inauguration.\n\nAnother spike occurred during the Supreme Court confirmation for Judge Brett Kavanaugh in September 2018, NPD said. Christine Blasey Ford, a college professor, accused the judge of sexual assaulting her during their high school days. Kavanaugh denied any inappropriate conduct.\n\nThey saw a notable rise in August 2017 when white nationalist demonstrations in Charlottesville, Va. turned violent. (At the time, Trump said there were \u201cbad people\u201d among the demonstrators, \u201cyou also had people that were very fine people, on both sides.\u201d)\n\nConsumers bought 275,000 print edition of the constitution in 2016, the year of presidential election, according to the NPD Group. That\u2019s the largest amount of print edition sales of the Constitution since the company\u2019s NPD BookScan started monitoring book sales in 2004.\n\nCoastal cities accounted for the higher sales of the Constitution in 2016. The West Coast has been a stronghold for Democratic presidential nominees, as has the northeast. In 2010, Southern cities had higher than average sales in Republican-leaning states such as Alabama, Texas and Arkansas.\n\nOn Amazon AMZN, +1.25%, a copy of the Constitution sells for $1 in paperback and $8.49 in hardback. Barnes & Noble\u2019s Nook users can read a digital version for 99 cents. (Barnes and Noble did not immediately respond to request for comment. Amazon declined to comment.)", "description": "Though sales have been brisk throughout the Trump era, they\u2019ve surged during certain events, according to NPD Bookscan.", "authors": ["Andrew Keshner"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HN531_Donald_ZG_20190717104308.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
