Still stay alert. We have strong forces in and around Halle and stabilize the situation until all information is secured.\"\n\nThe shooter allegedly ranted about feminism and immigration while wearing military fatigues and a helmet camera.\n\nA woman was then shot dead outside the synagogue where around 80 people were praying.\n\n(Image: ATV-Studio Halle/AFP via Getty I)\n\n(Image: TWITCH/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nAnother man was then shot dead after the gunman drove to a kebab shop close to the synagogue before opening fire a second time.\n\nWitnesses said the attacker used a submachine gun and threw a grenade into the Jewish cemetery, leaving people injured.\n\nKonrad R\u00f6sler, 28, a railway employee, told publication Bild: \"I stood in the doner shop. You have the man in army clothes with rifle. Then he threw something that looked like a grenade.\n\n\"But it was more like a Pollenb\u00f6ller. The thing has rebounded in the door frame. Then he shot into the glass.\n\n\"I found a toilet and locked myself up there. Then I heard another bang. At some point I heard the police and I made myself known and went out.\"\n\n(Image: ATV-Studio Halle/AFP via Getty I)\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nA blood-covered taxi driver was also reportedly rushed to hospital by air ambulance after he tried to stop the suspects from fleeing in his car.\n\nHis wife was also injured and is in hospital too.\n\nPolice urged people to stay inside as they tracked down the shooter.\n\nResidents were warned of the incident via an app which urged people to stay away from windows and doors.\n\nThe filming of Wednesday's attack echoed another horrific shooting halfway around the world, when a far-right white supremacist in March killed 51 people at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand and livestreamed much of the attack on Facebook.\n\nThat massacre drew strong criticism of social media giants for not immediately finding and blocking such a violent video.\n\nIt said: \"Firearms use in urban areas. Do not leave buildings and apartments away from windows and doors.

So far, we always felt safe, there was no evidence that we were in danger.\"\n\nGerman chancellor Angela Merkel attended an evening vigil at a historic synagogue in central Berlin in honour of the victims.\n\nMrs Merkel condemned the shooting, her spokesman saying she offered \"solidarity for all Jews on the holy day of Yom Kippur\".\n\nThe Chancellor had \"deep sympathy\" for the victims' families, government spokesman Steffen Seibert said, adding her 'thanks to all the security forces who are still on the scene'.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also condemned the attack, saying it was \"a new expression of anti-Semitism on the rise in Europe\".", "description": "The suspect has been named as 27-year-old Stephan Balliet who allegedly ranted about feminism and mmigration while wearing military fatigues and a helmet camera", "authors": ["Abigail O'Leary", "Image", "Atv-Studio Halle Afp Via Getty I", "Twitch Afp Via Getty Images", "Reuters", "Dpa Afp Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20547974.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GERMANY-SHOOTING-CRIME-JUDAISM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
