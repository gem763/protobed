(AP Photo/Charlie Riedel)\n\nIf this college football season was a television series, you could jump right in this weekend without needing to catch up on previous episodes.\n\nThe first six weeks have been entertaining, sure, but really not much has happened. No plot twists. No significant new story lines. Take a glance at the Top 25 and your friends can get you up to speed in five minutes.\n\nWeek 7 feels like the first of the season you can't miss. A season-high four games match ranked teams, all involving at least one top-10 team. Two more top-10 teams are facing high-profile rivals that have been in turmoil. Pretty much every game is a conference game. Both Death Valleys should be rocking Saturday.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThe Red River Rivalry is a good place to start with its noon ET kickoff. No. 11 Texas has emerged from several years of mediocrity to again be a legitimate threat to No. 6 Oklahoma in the Big 12. The Longhorns and Sooners split two games last season, including the Big 12 championship. Final combined score: Oklahoma 84, Texas 75.\n\nThe headliner under the lights is No. 7 Florida at No. 5 LSU. The Gators are playing in a second-straight top-10 matchup after a home victory against Auburn. The annual SEC crossover rivalry has been one of the most competitive in the conference in recent years. The last seven meetings have been decided by 11 points or fewer, including six one-possession games.\n\nIn between, No. 1 Alabama visits No. 24 Texas A&M; No. 2 Clemson hosts Florida State; No. 10 Penn State is at No. 17 Iowa; and No. 9 Notre Dame faces Southern California.\n\nA note of caution: The odds makers are not forecasting as much drama as the rankings and/or history suggests with most of the marquee matchups. Only one (Penn State-Iowa) has a point spread of less than 10 points as of Wednesday.\n\nThe picks:\n\nFRIDAY\n\nStory continues\n\nColorado (plus 21) at No. 13 Oregon\n\nQB Justin Herbert has only occasionally looked like a future top-tier NFL draft pick this season, but the Buffs' pass defense has been dreadful (9.5 yards per pass, 126th in the nation) ...
