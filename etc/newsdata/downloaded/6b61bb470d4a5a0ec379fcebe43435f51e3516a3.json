I just don\u2019t believe it\u2019s something we should engage in in a public manner.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI\u2019m not going to be baited into taking a position at all.\u201d\n\nDisney owns theme parks in Shanghai and Hong Kong, and counts on Chinese moviegoers to buy tickets to its Marvel superhero movies, like Avengers: Endgame and Captain Marvel.\n\nBut gaining access to Chinese consumers requires Disney to maintain warm relations with the repressive Communist party in Beijing.\n\nThe Disney-owned ESPN came under fire recently when it was reported that network executives forbade its journalists from discussing the China-NBA controversy on air.\n\nApple has also come under scrutiny for its close ties with China, which is where it manufactures products like the iPhone.\n\nIger expressed a similar reluctance to talk about China earlier this week during an interview with CNBC in which he called the NBA controversy \u201ca cautionary tale\u201d and said that being \u201cculturally correct\u201d in China is important.\n\nThe 68-year-old Iger reportedly told the audience on Tuesday that he still plans to retire from Disney in 2021.\n\nFollow David Ng on Twitter @HeyItsDavidNg.
