For years, Ohio State has been casually referred to as \u201cThe Ohio State University\u201d during player introductions on national NFL broadcasts, spawning a bit of a movement that was embraced by fans and the athletic department itself. The inclusion of the article before the name of the university was always mocked a bit but beloved by Buckeye Nation.\n\nJosh Gerben, a trademark attorney who has been the representative in over 4,000 trademark cases, says that the USPTO\u2019s denial of the application is clear and straight forward.\n\n\u201cFirst, the clothing company Marc Jacobs filed an application for \u2018The\u2019 that predates Ohio State's filing. If the Marc Jacobs application would ultimately register, the [Patent and Trademark Office] found it would likely block Ohio State's application,\u201d Gerben told FOX Business.\n\n\u201cSecond, the [Patent and Trademark Office] noted that Ohio State was not using the word \u2018The\u2019 as a trademark. In other words, Ohio State is not using the word \u2018The\u2019 as a brand. It is only using the word \u2018The\u2019 in an ornamental fashion across the front of a shirt and hat.\"\n\nThe university has had success with other, quirky trademarks over the years. Past Ohio State head coaches such as Urban Meyer and Woody Hayes have had their names trademarked.\n\nTrademarking of the word \"The\" was to extend only to things such as apparel sales and other retail merchandise. It wasn\u2019t a carte blanche trademark of the word in all circumstances in perpetuity.\n\nBut just because Wednesday\u2019s ruling was setback doesn\u2019t mean that Ohio State can\u2019t \u2013 and won\u2019t \u2013 proceed in their trademark application for this specific word. Gerben sees them being able to move forward and possibly pass the trademark.\n\n\"The\" Ohio State University is very much alive. (Trademark pending).\n\n\u201cThe university's application is still very much alive. At this point they could work to develop better labels and tags for the clothing items,\u201d Gerben said.\n\n\u201cThis would help the university get around the portion of the refusal about not having proper \u2018trademark use\u2019 of the word \u2018The.\u2019 Also, the trademark application filed by Marc Jacobs is having its own issues \u2013 the [Patent and Trademark Office] found that Marc Jacobs not properly using the word \u2018The\u2019 on its clothing items either. Therefore, if the Marc Jacobs application does not get approved, and, the university reworks its labeling for the shirts and hats, it is very possible the [Patent and Trademark Office] could still approve this trademark for registration.\u201d", "description": "Ohio State's trademark application for the word 'The' is far from dead, says one patent attorney.", "authors": ["Kristian Dyer"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/02/0/0/48dc9286-OSU.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"}
