Rand Paul continued Friday, with both lawmakers saying it was an important debate for the direction of the party\u2019s foreign policy.\n\nSpeaking at the House GOP retreat in Baltimore Friday morning, Ms. Cheney said she \u201cenjoyed\u201d the Twitter spat with the Kentucky senator.\n\n\u201cI thought it was an enlightening exchange,\u201d the congresswoman told reporters at the retreat. \u201cHere I thought the Senate was dull.\u201d\n\nThe feud began Wednesday when Mr. Paul shared an article criticizing Ms. Cheney for being at odds with President Trump\u2019s position on the war in Afghanistan.\n\nIt continued throughout the week after the president fired his National Security Adviser John R. Bolton \u2014 with Mr. Paul accusing Ms. Cheney of \u201cwarmongering\u201d and being slammed for his 2016 campaign in return.\n\nThe Wyoming Republican continued to swipe at Mr. Paul\u2019s failed presidential run, arguing Americans don\u2019t respond to his isolationist ideas.\n\n\u201cThere are issues that surround whether or not you put America first, as President Trump does, or blame America first as Rand Paul does and has for years,\u201d she said.\n\nMr. Paul fired back Friday afternoon, doubling down on accusing Ms. Cheney of opposing the president\u2019s foreign policy strategy.\n\n\u201cFew people have been as wrong on foreign policy over the last few years as the neocons and Liz Cheney. The Twitter exchange represents a real and significant debate on the future of our foreign policy between realists like myself and NeverTrumper neoconservatives like Cheney.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if the feud was a symptom of a larger rift in the party over foreign policy, Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy dismissed the idea.\n\nHe said Republicans embrace a rigorous debate, before swiping at Democrats for the number of primary challengers current members are facing from more liberal candidates.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
