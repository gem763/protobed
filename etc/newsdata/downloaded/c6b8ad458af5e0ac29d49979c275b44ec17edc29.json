Take me to the future now", "language": "en", "text": "I had been driving the A-Class again because I had been fairly dismissive of cars you talk to, like the latest Benzes. These Benzes claim to have \u201cnatural speech recognition\u201d that allows you to ask things in your own way rather than follow standard voice commands. They also claim to use AI to predict your moods and respond. Benz claims, perhaps rather creepily, that MBUX will remind you to ring your mum on the way home, if you normally do, but forget.\n\nHave one for a few weeks, they said. It takes that long to learn your voice, and understand your habits. And it takes a driver time to learn all the different ways you can access information and control the car via voice, a swathe of touchscreens and smartphone app.\n\nThe me Connect app lets you commune with the car even when you've got out to admire the view.\n\nCricket stat aficionados will love the app. It allows you to engage with your car over a cup of coffee. I could check how much fuel I had in percentage terms, and the range it would give me, and the state of the brake linings and coolant level. I could read Mercedes-Benz news, handy hints and updates. I could look up an address on the phone and send it to the vehicle, so the satnav was primed and ready to go.\n\nThe system is capable of predictive navigation \u2013 rerouting you on the way to the office because of traffic, even though you haven\u2019t set a destination, or drawing attention to points of interest along the way when you have.\n\nPresumably before long, the physical key itself will be merely a back-up for the day you lose your phone.\n\nSome of the information is surprising. For example the short trip to drop a colleague to the station was only 2.8 kilometres but used 18.1 L/100 km. That was almost twice the car\u2019s long-term total of 9.8 L/100 km (the car had travelled 3639 km in its life, at an average of 35 km/h).\n\nIt is possible to start the engine remotely (an extra PIN is needed for security) to get the air-conditioning up to temperature before leaving. I felt guilty running a petrol engine in an empty car, but this will be great with a battery vehicle, mid-summer or mid-winter.\n\nThe interior is as smart as the MBUX multimedia system.\n\nThe car sends a notification if left unlocked. Remote unlocking is equally useful. If your passengers make it to the car before you do, they can text and you can let them in. Your phone can find your car, even if you can\u2019t. An upcoming Digital Vehicle Key will allow you to lend the car remotely, by texting an entry-and-starting code to a friend (or those in a car sharing scheme). Presumably before long, the physical key itself will be merely a back-up for the day you lose your phone.\n\nWere there any creepy \u201cplease ring mum\u201d messages for me? Fortunately, no, nor was there a huge amount of predictive behaviour, though that suited me fine. If I told the car I was hot or cold it would adjust the temperature, but on more complex matters it often asked what the hell I was talking about, even if not in those words. Maybe I didn\u2019t talk to it enough, or in a sufficiently nice voice; nonetheless, it was better than most on the simple stuff, such as \u201cHey Mercedes, take me to number 123 Pacific Highway.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt this is the future, the car as an extension of the smartphone. Things are being added all the time. While I had the A250, the ability to compare nearby petrol prices was added, along with \u201cweather at destination\u201d. These were both catch-ups with the Audi system, but Benz has some things others don\u2019t. As with smartphones themselves, it\u2019s probable that all products in each price class will end up with broadly similar features.\n\nIn the end I was hugely impressed by most of MBUX, even if it didn\u2019t quite deliver the promised \u201cemotional bond between driver and vehicle\u201d. And, MBUX aside, it was a shame to give back the A250. With 4MATIC (all-wheel drive), AMG enhancements, and just about every option including an excellent head-up display and an array of driver assistance systems, it was a rather elevated $67,420-plus on roads.\n\nYet it was everything you\u2019d really want in a city car: spritely, comfortable, hugely competent and even self-aware. It knows when it\u2019s taken a hit.\n\nMERCEDES A250 4MATIC\n\nPrice $54,800 (excluding on road costs); $67,420 as tested\n\nEngine 2-litre turbo four-cylinder (petrol)\n\nPower/torque 165 kW/350 Nm\n\nFuel economy 6.6 L/100 km (combined cycle)\n\nCO\u2082 150 g/km", "description": "The AI-equipped A250 packs a lot of smarts into a small package.
