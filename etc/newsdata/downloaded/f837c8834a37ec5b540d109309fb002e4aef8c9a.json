Paul Daniels sawing Debbie McGee in half, or Harry Potter chanting \u201cExpecto patronum\u201d? Or perhaps just a sweaty little man (they are almost always men) trying gamely to placate a party of sugar-high six-year-olds with balloons while their parents slip out the back?\n\nWith its razzmatazz, secrecy and ritualised trickery, being a magician is not a calling most associate with a social conscience. But there is an intellectual dimension to magic that was already old the first time someone thought of putting an egg into a bag and then making it disappear (believed to be in the 16th century). Good magicians have always understood and exploited the psychological blind spots of their audience. In 1876, a magician known as Professor Hoffmann collected a series of articles he had written for a popular boys\u2019 magazine into a book, Modern Magic, which explained how classic tricks were performed. \u201cHe believed young people should learn to perform magic because it would be useful in their professional lives and in the furtherance of the British empire,\u201d one present-day acolyte, Will Houston, tells me. \u201cMagic teaches you to stand in front of a room and talk, problem-solve, deceive and spot deception.\u201d\n\nToday, the practical applications of magic are being used by a new generation to conjure up a better world.\n\nThe \u2018magic humanitarian\u2019\n\nJamie Balfour-Paul\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jamie Balfour-Paul \u2026 \u2018In Lebanon, if you don\u2019t have a rabbit, you might as well go home.\u2019 Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian\n\nBalfour-Paul, AKA Jamie Gibberish, is a former charity worker who works his magic on some of the world\u2019s most deprived children in refugee camps around the Middle East and the north of Africa. He travels with little except an ornate wooden box he picked up years ago in Egypt. \u201cI try to make a point of getting everything into that box, and I choose props based on familiarity \u2013 newspapers, bottles, ropes,\u201d he says. \u201cBut in Lebanon [where he is based], if you don\u2019t have a rabbit, you might as well go home.\u201d At one point he had three of them hopping around his Beirut flat because they kept growing too big to fit into a hat.\n\nA shy man, he comes alive when swallowing a balloon or pulling a multicoloured streamer from his mouth, but his first charity job was as a volunteer agricultural adviser on a tree-planting scheme in Palestine. After rising up the ranks into management, he decided he wanted to return to working directly with the people he had set out to help.\n\nNow he has set up a charity called Magic for Smiles. \u201c\u2018Psychosocial\u2019 is a bit of a buzzword. But being in a community where your parents don\u2019t have any status, and you can\u2019t play because it\u2019s quite cramped, is very stressful. There\u2019s obviously happiness and de-stressing through entertainment, but magic also helps with concentration, creativity and interaction. Funding is a problem, and it\u2019s quite a lonely life; just me and my bunnies driving around. But it\u2019s worth it to see the children\u2019s faces light up.\u201d\n\nMagicians in residence at Cambridge University\n\nClive Wilkins and Nicky Clayton\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Clive Wilkins and Nicky Clayton \u2026 \u2018Maybe we can trick ourselves into seeing further.\u2019 Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian\n\n\u201cPick a number between one and 100,\u201d says Clive Wilkins. So I do, but don\u2019t tell him which one. For him and his professional partner, Nicky Clayton, magic is no less than a portal to the future. Clayton is a professor of comparative cognition in the psychology department at Cambridge University, where Wilkins \u2013 an artist and novelist as well as a magician \u2013 has a permanent residency. The pair met at a tango class and are never seen abroad together without identical homburg hats.\n\nBut their showbizzy style conceals a serious academic purpose, which they are promoting around the world in illustrated lectures designed to fundamentally challenge the way people think (next stops: China and Germany). \u201cThe argument we have been developing is that magic reveals a number of interesting roadblocks in our thinking,\u201d says Clayton. Such as? \u201cThere\u2019s egocentric bias \u2013 where we think others see and think more like us than they really do; and confirmation bias, where we see what we expect to see, so can miss the most obvious things. Magic capitalises on these blind spots in our thinking; magic occurs in the mind of the spectator, not the hands of the magician.\u201d\n\nWilkins seamlessly picks up the baton: \u201cWe suggest that the human brain has been very good at creating civilisation over the last millennia, but in a postmodern world, scientists and artists are wondering what the next development is going to be. Perhaps the way forward is to find some alternative way of seeing. Maybe we can trick ourselves into seeing further. We have to see over and above ourselves.\u201d With that, he waves a piece of paper in my face. It reads \u201c46\u201d, the number I had almost forgotten I picked. I leave with the roadblocks rattling in my brain.\n\nThe student magician\n\nCat Lee\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Cat Lee \u2026 \u2018Now I am who I am, and I can never thank them enough.\u2019 Photograph: Richard Eaton/Breathe Magic\n\n\u201cAt 19, I couldn\u2019t cook or pour a drink. I\u2019d never eaten with a knife and fork. It\u2019s really embarrassing on a date to ask: \u2018Please can you cut up my food?\u2019\u201d says Cat Lee, who is based in Merseyside. She is now a poised 22-year-old law graduate, but is more interested in developing her modelling career than pursuing a legal career. Part of the thrill of it, she says, is that her bookers don\u2019t know she has cerebral palsy.\n\nThe turning point in her life came when her mother signed her up for a summer camp for young people with hemiplegia, a condition that leaves one side of the body incapacitated, and can be caused by stroke, epilepsy or a head injury, as well as cerebral palsy. The camps are run by Breathe Arts Health Research, a charity set up more than a decade ago by a group of magicians who believed the dexterity used in magic tricks could be used therapeutically to help young people who had little support from the health system.\n\nWorking with occupational therapists from a London hospital, they discovered that some children could make life-changing progress in coordination \u2013 and confidence \u2013 in just a fortnight. Its co-founder David Owen (who is also a barrister) demonstrates a trick \u2013 the mystery of the jumping coins \u2013 in which money appears to leap from one place to another. Repeating it in slow motion, he shows how it involves a series of 10 movements, from pinching the coins to pick them up to pressing both palms flat on the table and turning hands over together and separately. \u201cIt\u2019s a professional-level piece of magic that some children master and others don\u2019t, but for all of them, it is building skills that most of us take for granted,\u201d he says.\n\nCat was one of their successes, who left the 10-day course capable of building an independent life and is now a mentor, encouraging younger children at the camps. She doesn\u2019t do magic tricks herself, but uses the props to exercise her hands. She credits the performance skills she learned with enabling her to overcome her physical difficulties and the resulting psychological ones. Her tears well up as she recalls the camp\u2019s impact on her life. \u201cNow I am who I am, and I can never thank them enough.\u201d\n\nThe medical magician and the surgeon\n\nWill Houston and Roger Kneebone\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Roger Kneebone and Will Houston \u2026 \u2018I realised there were far deeper parallels around capturing and managing attention.\u2019 Photograph: Jill Mead/The Guardian\n\n\u201cAs a student, I saw medicine as a science. As a surgeon, I saw it as a skill. As a GP, I saw it much more as a performance, and as a patient, I see it as all three,\u201d says Prof Roger Kneebone. He is sitting in the cafe at the Wellcome Trust in London. Opposite him is a younger man whose gaze is steady and intense, and whose hands are in constant motion, flicking and cutting a pack of playing cards.\n\nKneebone runs a master\u2019s course in surgical education at Imperial College, and the man with him is Will Houston, one of the UK\u2019s leading closeup magicians and editor of the Magic Circle\u2019s house magazine, the Magic Circular. Five years ago, they started working together to investigate the parallels between magic and surgery.\n\n\u201cFirst, I was looking at dexterity, as both involve sleight of hand,\u201d says Kneebone, \u201cbut most of a surgeon\u2019s time isn\u2019t spent in the operating theatre, and I realised there were far deeper parallels around capturing and managing attention.\u201d He set up a radical department of performance science and appointed Houston its magician in residence, and they began to give joint lectures.\n\nMagicians are, by necessity, secretive, Houston says, but there is a separation between a magic trick and the techniques used to make it work \u2013 such as how to create a theatrically exaggerated state that looks natural, and shift attention with your gaze. \u201cIf you want someone to look at an object, look at it. If you want them to look at you, look at them.\u201d He illustrates his point with a baffling three-coin vanishing trick.\n\nA medical consultation is a complicated process in which a surgeon has to listen to a patient while simultaneously making judgments and taking clinical notes. The ability to create a connection \u2013 to hold that patient in thrall \u2013 hasn\u2019t traditionally been considered part of a surgeon\u2019s skill set, yet it is as important to clinical practice as it is to a magic show, they explain. For the patient, it\u2019s the difference between feeling heard, and safe, or just another statistic, another chore. \u201cMagic doesn\u2019t work if you do it at people and neither does medicine,\u201d says Kneebone. \u201cA medical consultation is all about dual narratives: what is really going on and what seems to be going on, so even if you\u2019re delivering bad news, the patient has a sense they are further on.\u201d\n\nThe magic special needs teacher\n\nGoldie Puricelli\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jazzy Whipps and Goldie Puricelli performing Signed Magic. Photograph: Martin Suker\n\n\u201cMy whole interest in magic came from an interaction with a 16-year-old autistic boy,\u201d says Goldie Puricelli. \u201cHe was into magic, so I learned a trick out of a cracker and when I showed it to him, it sparked concentration. It was only a crappy little trick, but it stopped me in my tracks.\u201d\n\nWithin two years, Puricelli had charmed her way into the Magic Circle with a repertoire of tricks involving cards and coins. A one-time teenage runaway, Puricelli has worked for 20 years in a south London special needs unit, and began using magic as an incentive for children with dyslexia. \u201cI said I\u2019d reward them with a new trick every week before I realised how hard that was,\u201d she laughs. \u201cBut it\u2019s great, especially for the girls, because then they go on and learn for themselves.\u201d\n\nSoon, she was wondering if she could put it to work for another marginalised sector by incorporating British Sign Language. This would stop deaf people being excluded from the magic of magic by having to look simultaneously at the magician and an interpreter. \u201cEveryone, from magicians to interpreters, said it couldn\u2019t be done because it involved using two languages simultaneously,\u201d she says. So she teamed up with a deaf YouTuber, Jazzy Whipps, and within an hour they had scripted a bilingual card trick. It wasn\u2019t just any old trick, but one regarded as a holy grail of closeup magic which involves identifying a randomly selected playing card in a pack and is known in the magic community as Any Card at Any Number.\n\nPuricelli is now turning her attention back to autistic teenagers to see if she can use simple tricks to help them with social interaction. The signs so far are good. \u201cIt\u2019s a double illusion,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s the trick itself, but also the illusion of intimacy. People on the autism spectrum tend to struggle to make eye contact and the trick gives them a way of connecting within their safe boundary.\u201d Importantly, for young people who often feel they have no prospects, she says, \u201cit also gives them a skill that can lead somewhere\u201d.\n\nSmoke and Mirrors: The Psychology of Magic, at the Wellcome Collection, London, is on until 15 September.", "description": "Forget trying to saw Debbie McGee in half \u2013 some conjurers are using their skills to help surgeons, refugee children and even imagine a better future", "authors": ["Claire Armitstead"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b651a80eb61dec3a629a13f302ee89b9a31a369f/0_55_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0b94f5e737fcf483db2f83bd8e40acca", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
