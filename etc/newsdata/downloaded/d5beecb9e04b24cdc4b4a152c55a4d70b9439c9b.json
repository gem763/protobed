She and Schiff were in touch throughout the weekend, syncing up strategies and talking points, according to an official familiar with the conversations\u2026\n\nTwo White House officials said they are also not worried about defying or mocking Nadler because Pelosi has made it clear she is not interested in impeachment and the House Democratic Caucus is split about what to do to counter Trump.", "description": "", "authors": ["Washingtonpost.Com Politics Weve-Been-Very-Weak-House-Democrats-Decry-Their-Oversight-Of-Trump-Push-Pelosi-On-Impeachment"], "top_image": ""}
