F--- Trump!\" behind him, making for a somewhat awkward segment.\n\nYou can watch the moment below, as captured by Sara Pearl of Move On:\n\nThe chants against US President Donald Trump could stem from more than just political differences. Earlier in the tournament, Trump traded bards with USWNT superstar Megan Rapinoe.\n\n\n\nRapinoe was asked about a potential White House visit should the Americans go on to win the tournament, to which she responded, \"I'm not going to the f------ White House.\"\n\nTrump, in turn, said that Rapinoe should \"win before she talks,\" beginning yet another Twitter feud with the sports world from his seat in the Oval Office.\n\nWhile the United States women aren't expected to appear at the White House any time soon, the team did accept an invitation to tour the House of Representatives from Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nReceive a single WhatsApp every morning with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "Soccer fans in France were clearly on Megan Rapinoe's side in her ongoing feud with the American president.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9081/349f287104bd48e09b1289ac214bea4c.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-07"}
