On Tuesday, M+S declined to comment on this when contacted by BT.\n\nThe five-star Andaz Singapore, managed by Hyatt Hotels Corporation, opened its doors in late 2017 and was the first Andaz hotel in South-east Asia.\n\nThe hotel occupies the top 15 floors of the 39-storey Duo Tower and features a rooftop venue, an observation deck, a string of restaurants and bars, and premium meeting facilities.\n\nThe Andaz sale is subject to customary closing conditions. JLL is the appointed advisor for the transaction.\n\nHoi Hup Realty\u2019s chairman Wong Swee Chun said on Tuesday: \u201cWe are attracted to the rarity of this high-quality luxury hotel offering as well as its historic significance, being one of the landmark projects by M+S.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are especially excited by the strategic location of the hotel, with Andaz Singapore occupying a key node in the transformative Beach Road and Ophir-Rochor Corridor.\u201d\n\nKemmy Tan, chief executive officer of M+S, said that the record price of S$475 million reflects the hotel\u2019s potential for growth in tandem with the evolution of the Bugis district as an extension of the existing central business district.\n\n\u201cThe proposed transaction will allow us to maximise returns to our shareholders, while handing over the reins to a very established and exciting developer in Hoi Hup to take the asset forward,\u201d Ms Tan added.\n\nDuo Tower is part of the two-tower mixed-use Duo development on Beach Road by M+S, which is a 60:40 joint venture between Malaysian sovereign wealth fund Khazanah Nasional and Singapore investment firm Temasek Holdings.\n\nAside from Andaz, Duo Tower also comprises 570,000 square feet (sq ft) of prime Grade-A commercial space on Levels 4 to 23, and a 56,000 sq ft retail component, Duo Galleria, on Level 1 and Basement 3. The other tower, Duo Residences, has 49 storeys and houses 660 units.\n\nIn July, M+S confirmed it was selling Duo\u2019s office and retail areas for S$1.575 billion, or S$2,570 per square foot of net lettable area, to Allianz Real Estate and Hong Kong private equity firm Gaw Capital Partners.\n\nThe Duo development sits on a site with a 99-year leasehold tenure starting from July 1, 2011.\n\nM+S will continue to own and manage Marina One in Marina Bay, which comprises 1.88 million sq ft of prime Grade A office space, 140,000 sq ft of retail space, and 1,042 luxury apartments.", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Real Estate - THE national joint venture between Malaysia and Singapore, M+S Pte Ltd, on Tuesday announced it will sell the luxury hotel component of the signature Duo mixed-use project for S$475 million to Hoi Hup Realty. .
