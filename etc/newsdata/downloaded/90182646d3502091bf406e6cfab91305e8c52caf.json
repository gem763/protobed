Nobody in the room was even tempted to laugh.\n\nThe change in England's attacking play under coach Southgate has been fundamental and feels permanent. They will face the Czechs having scored 19 goals in four qualifying games for next summer's European Championship.\n\nJaroslav Silhavy has praised England's attack, but also pinpointed their defence as a weakness\n\nGareth Southgate said he was miserable for a month after conceding three against Kosovo\n\nInjuries and poor form have been an issue for England's defence in recent outings\n\nThe only problem is that all coins have two sides and the wrong side of this one concerns England's defending. Silhavy had something to say about that, too.\n\n'We were quite surprised when we learned the Kosovo match ended 5-3,' he said. 'England maybe could have scored nine goals, so they have great attacking strength. But what we saw in that game was England are not perfect and we hope to take advantage.'\n\nThis hardly represents a rallying cry for a national team who lost 5-0 at Wembley in March, but Silhavy's observations were appropriate all the same.\n\nSouthgate's England came of age as an attacking force during the 2018 World Cup and they have continued in that vein. That style has taken them to the brink of qualification.\n\nAt times, England's football can be thrilling and it has been a while since we have said that.\n\nNevertheless, the national team's defensive issues are real and potentially damaging with so few competitive games remaining between now and Euro 2020.\n\nEngland's work at the back against Kosovo in Southampton was poor and not a one-off.\n\n'Every area of our game has to be right,' said Southgate. 'You have to keep clean sheets in major tournaments.'\n\nThis is the point. England's football has been more than good enough to qualify easily. But Southgate does not wish to simply play in next summer's tournament \u2014 he wishes to win it.\n\nMuch of the competition will take place in England, so the opportunity is significant.\n\n'English football looks to be in a healthy state,' added Southgate. 'But it's only when we deliver at a tournament that we can really say that.'\n\nWe will possibly know a little more about England's durability after Friday's game and what looks set to be tense night in Sofia against Bulgaria on Monday.\n\nEngland's current problem is finding a central defensive partner for Harry Maguire\n\nJohn Stones is currently out injured, and not historically solid for England in any case\n\nTwo away games will place England under greater pressure in terms of possession and territory than anything they have experienced since losing 3-1 to Holland in the Nations League in Portugal last summer. Then, next month, comes a visit to Prishtina and a return fixture against free-wheeling Kosovo.\n\nSouthgate admits that he was 'miserable for a month' after that 5-3 game and, as a former central defender, that is understandable. What would make him smile is a central defender to play alongside Harry Maguire.\n\nWith Manchester City's John Stones injured and not historically reliable for England anyway, Southgate's two options are Liverpool's Joe Gomez and Michael Keane of Everton.\n\nPretty soon, one of them is going to have to step forward.\n\nEngland are well stocked at full back and that remains a strength. Not so in the middle, where Gomez has not recovered form from last season's knee injury and Keane will have travelled here burdened by memories of a personal horror show against Kosovo.\n\nGomez remains the better option but only if he rediscovers form. He was poor against Salzburg for Liverpool in the Champions League and dropped as his team beat Leicester.\n\nSouthgate will have felt that disappointment almost as keenly as the player and it may be the reason he is expected to give Keane another run alongside Maguire on Friday.\n\n'It's clear that some of our defenders who've picked up more caps over the last couple of years either aren't with us or haven't been playing regularly for their clubs,' added Southgate.\n\n'So it's a different situation to solve, but we've got to just work with the players on the training ground to make sure that's an area of focus for us.\n\n'We're going to score goals and play good football but everything has to be right.'\n\nJoe Gomez is one option at the back, but only if he can rediscover his good form\n\nSouthgate's calm pragmatism is an asset as England negotiate challenging issues on and off the field during this brief visit to Eastern Europe \u2014 and it will be an asset as the nation starts its usual clamour for glory ahead of next summer.\n\nSouthgate wants his team to enjoy qualification if it does come on Friday, but not too much. The coach sees this as a staging post on the road to something much more significant. Hopefully his players view it the same way.", "description": "Changing times in English football were summed up rather well in Prague on Thursday night by Czech coach Jaroslav Silhavy.
