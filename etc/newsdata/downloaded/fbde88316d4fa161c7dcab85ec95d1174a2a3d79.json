Photo: Ollie Millington/Getty Images\n\nBen: Today, a member of the nonviolent, intentionally disruptive environmental movement Extinction Rebellion was dragged down from the top of a London tube train, in a widely seen video. Is angering city dwellers (and many elected officials) a rational strategy for drawing attention to a threat that is not being taken nearly seriously enough by governments?\n\nDavid: Probably from some perspective it\u2019s rational, but it doesn\u2019t strike me as especially effective \u2014 as most of XR has already acknowledged, essentially disavowing the action (which was taken by one part of the decentralized network, over some objections, apparently, from the other parts).\n\nIn general, attacks on the \u201cpowers that be\u201d strike me as more appealing lines of attack than those that target the public defined more broadly. But then again XR\u2019s been pushing the envelope on this question since they first began protesting, doing a lot more to really disrupt life in London than most protest movements tend to feel comfortable doing. And it\u2019s been, I think, pretty effective. Rupert Read is one of the central XR spokespeople, and while he also criticized the Tube action, he\u2019d just a few days ago described the general principle of disruptive protest this way: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if they like us personally, what matters is that they hear our message.\u201d\n\nBen: By terming the protests \u201ceffective,\u201d do you mean simply that they put climate change front and center in people\u2019s minds more so than it would be otherwise?\n\nDavid: Well, presumably you\u2019d want to make people more sympathetic to your cause, too!\n\nBen: Oh yeah, that.\n\nDavid: And this action very much failed on that front. Of course there\u2019s also the sort of crossed-wire-ness of protesting climate change by stopping public transportation, which is, among other things, a \u201csolution\u201d to climate change (at least, something we\u2019ll need more of). But in general, I\u2019ve been really struck at just how much XR has been able to accomplish over there by protesting in ways that strike me, on first blush, as recognizably fringe-y.\n\nOne question that raises is whether the general public \u2014 especially in the U.K., but also elsewhere \u2014 might be more receptive to more aggressive protest action on climate than most activists have previously believed. The Tube thing was a kind of practical test of that, and does seem really to have backfired. But more broadly I do think they\u2019ve been able to open up considerably more protest space and energy than I would\u2019ve guessed possible not that long ago.\n\nBen: For those of us not following this closely \u2014 what have they accomplished?\n\nDavid: Well, the conservative British Parliament, in the midst of a Brexit crisis, declared a climate emergency and committed to zero carbon for the country by 2050. The Labour Party has come out in favor of a 2030 zero-carbon target \u2014 so aggressive I\u2019m not even sure it\u2019s possible. And just today, as Boris announced the deal he\u2019d struck in Brussels, he celebrated by saying Parliament could now get back to work \u2014 listing the environment as one of the four things they needed to tackle. That\u2019s not all XR, of course. But their role has not been insignificant \u2014 in fact I\u2019m not sure we would\u2019ve seen any of it without them. And even in a very bottom-line kind of way, they\u2019ve inspired many many thousands of Londoners to go pretty all-in on a very aggressive climate protest movement! That alone is pretty significant.\n\nBen: That seems like a smashing success in a short period of time.\n\nDavid: Yeah, I mean, we\u2019ll see whether that 2050 pledge gets met \u2014 considering basically no climate pledges ever made by any country ever have been fulfilled, it\u2019s very much an open question. But it\u2019s still a notable development, I think, to be setting those targets. This one is even, they say, \u201clegally binding,\u201d though I don\u2019t think anyone really knows what that means.\n\nBen: Between this and the even more high-profile movement commandeered by Greta Thunberg, it feels like a watershed few months for climate protest. As the climate crisis worsens, do you expect the tactics employed by such movements to become a lot bolder? Not to be morbid, but I\u2019m a bit surprised there hasn\u2019t been widespread ecoterrorism yet.\n\nDavid: Well, some people cite the Christchurch and El Paso shootings as forms of that \u2014 each cited ecological concerns in their manifestos, though I don\u2019t think it\u2019s really accurate to say either was predominantly focused on them. But I assume you\u2019re asking about left-wing terrorism, and I do think that\u2019s likely to pop up more as things get worse and people get more frustrated. Nevertheless, there\u2019ll probably always be a bit of an ideological imbalance, since far-right responses to climate change do converge a little more quickly and naturally on nihilism. In general I think the political response to warming is going to be, primarily, just messy. We tend to assume the narrative is going to unfold in one direction, even if we\u2019re not sure which: ecofascism or ecosocialism, for instance. But the more likely scenario is that the future will be like the world we live in now, with a whole lot of different responses coming from all different parts of the political spectrum, the heterodoxy unfortunately making it a lot harder to engineer any kind of global response, which is probably what we need.\n\nBen: As you\u2019ve written, there\u2019s a new urgency in the air now, spurred on by the apocalyptic U.N. report last year and the cascading climate disasters that have taken place just in the last year. To what extent does this new atmosphere, even if it hasn\u2019t translated politically, change your thinking about the feasibility of taking on the issue?\n\nDavid: I think it\u2019s made a whole lot more possible! What is considered politically acceptable now, in a place like the U.S. but also across the world, is very different than anyone would\u2019ve guessed a year ago.There does seem to be a meaningful constituency of people who really, really care about the issue. It\u2019s far from a majority, but when you combine the intensity of some small percentage of the public (say, 5 percent) with the casual concern of the majority (on climate, about three-quarters of Americans say they are worried), that can be a recipe for real dramatic policy change, which is what\u2019s necessary.\n\nBut public opinion is just the very first step. And when you look at what it takes to get major policy passed, and what logistical and capital obstacles there are to major infrastructure projects, and how little time we really have to radically cut our emissions to avoid global catastrophe, and how big a role China and India and the rest of the world will play in determining that future \u2026 It\u2019s still very, very hard for me to imagine we find a way to stay below 2 degrees of warming, which the U.N. says would increase damages from storms and sea-level rise a hundredfold (among many, many other devastating impacts). So we\u2019re going to be living in a world shaped and defined by climate change, even as it plays a more and more central role in our politics.", "description": "Is Extinction Rebellion, which uses intentionally divisive tactics to disrupt city-dwellers\u2019 lives, the future of climate protest?
