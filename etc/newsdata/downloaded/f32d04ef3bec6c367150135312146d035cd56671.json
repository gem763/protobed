No, Trump Will. No, Warren Will", "language": "en", "text": "(Bloomberg) -- Wall Street\u2019s best minds are falling over themselves to describe the cataclysms that would befall equities should Elizabeth Warren get elected. It\u2019s a brand of analysis whose recent track record is abysmal.\n\nThe S&P 500 will plunge 25% if the Democrat becomes president, says Paul Tudor Jones, the hedge fund manager. Discovery Capital Management founder Rob Citrone says she\u2019s \u201cthe single biggest risk for the market\u201d and calculates the downside at up to 20%. Billionaire Leon Cooperman told CNBC earlier this month that the market would drop 25% if Warren or Bernie Sanders win.\n\nThat\u2019s a lot of certainty to attach to predictions Wall Street has shown no ability to get right in the past. The confidence sounds particularly rich considering what investors said about the man Warren aims to dethrone, Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cStrategists predicting the impact of a presidential election are worse than the pollsters,\u201d Matt Maley, equity strategist at Miller Tabak + Co., said by phone. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the best contrary indicators out there.\u201d\n\nSure, the forecasts could come true. Maybe Warren\u2019s plans to rein in Wall Street and corporate America will kill the economy, or maybe the bull market will just die of old age. But the evidence is scant a president\u2019s political leanings do much to sway stocks. Variations in equity performance when a Democrat is in the White House are almost negligible when compared with Republicans, according to research from Vanguard that was published before the 2016 election.\n\nEveryone knows stocks soared under Trump. Everyone did not know that would happen before he won. Heading into November 2016, strategists and economists focused on his unpredictability, his protectionist ideas, instead of pro-growth policies like tax cuts. Many predicted a more volatile Trump would send stocks into a correction.\n\nStrategists at RBC Capital Markets LLC said prior to Election Day that a Trump victory would send the S&P 500 down 10 to 12%. Barclays had predicted a drop of as much as 13%. The team at JPMorgan advised investors to sell the rebound that materialized just a few hours after Trump won.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just stock handicappers. Two economics professors, Justin Wolfers and Eric Zitzewitz, wrote a paper on the topic for Brookings in October 2016. They analyzed the futures market during the first presidential debate and extrapolated the reaction to conclude a Trump win would send stocks down 10% to 15%. A Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist posited that a Trump presidency would cause a stock market crash and could plunge the global economy into recession.\n\nPartly, it was a reflection of polling data. Since Trump was viewed as a long shot, many predicted investors would be shocked into selling if he won. That was the thinking at Citigroup, where strategists said the S&P 500 could lose 3% to 5% immediately. They added that a Trump win would also pose risks to stocks in the long term.\n\nThe first prediction came true. S&P 500 futures were halted after a 5% plunge in the hours after the 2016 race was called. But they rebounded just as fast and the index has gained more than 40% since Trump\u2019s election.\n\nIt was much the same for Barack Obama as he ran for re-election against Mitt Romney in 2012. Two months ahead of the election, nearly 50% of respondents in a Bloomberg survey said a win for the incumbent would be a negative for U.S. financial markets. That\u2019s even after the S&P gained 42% from Obama\u2019s first election to his second.\n\nAmong prognosticators who muffed the call was Donald Trump, who said in a November 2012 tweet that both the stock market and the U.S. dollar would plunge following Obama\u2019s second victory. The S&P 500 rose almost 50% in that term, bringing his eight-year return to 112%, while Bloomberg\u2019s dollar index gained 21% in the four years that ended in November 2016.\n\nIn the heat of an election, people let their emotions take over and exaggerate the impact a president will have on the economy and markets, according to Mark Hackett, chief of investment research at Nationwide Funds Group.\n\n\u201cThe most nay-saying people to Barack Obama will admit that there was not a transformation of our economy in any way that they would\u2019ve feared the day he got elected. Same thing with the Democrats with Trump. There hasn\u2019t been this transformation that was feared,\u201d Hackett said in an interview at Bloomberg\u2019s New York headquarters. \u201cOur economy is bigger than one person or one election cycle.\u201d\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Wall Street\u2019s best minds are falling over themselves to describe the cataclysms that would befall equities should Elizabeth Warren get elected.
