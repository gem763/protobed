Construction has yet to be completed, but the memorandum said TGOD had invested $107 million in the facility and its equipment. Under the terms of the offering, the licensed producer was willing to pay a little more than $10 million per year in rent over an initial lease term of 15 years and would be subject to annual rent increases of two per cent.\n\nTGOD spokesperson Sebastien Bouchard said the Mississauga, Ont.-based company had previously disclosed in an Oct. 9 press release that it had been engaged in discussions for \u201cordinary course commercial bank facilities and equipment leasing.\u201d TGOD received offers for the facility, Bouchard said, but was unable to come to an agreement with prospective buyers.\n\n\u201cBased on current market conditions, we didn\u2019t get the offer on the terms and within the timeframe we needed so we had to disclose we\u2019re reviewing alternative options,\u201d said Bouchard, who explained that the company was looking to bridge financing and that the Ancaster facility was off the market.\n\nWhile Bouchard said that TGOD had not been interested in selling the property since Oct. 8, it remained listed on the website of Stream Capital Partners, a net lease and sale leaseback advisory firm based in Chicago, through Thursday afternoon.\n\nThe listing, which suggested the property was still for sale, was taken down after the Post inquired about its online presence. Neither Stream Capital Partners nor TGOD appeared to realize that it was still online.\n\nThe memorandum was intended for the eyes of prospective investors in the property. TGOD mentioned that it was looking into \u201cequipment leasing\u201d multiple times this year but did not appear to specifically indicate that its entire Ancaster facility was on the market.\n\nTGOD is one of several licensed producers struggling for liquidity in a dried-up marketplace.\n\nIn the memorandum, TGOD is described as a \u201cwell-financed company with robust market cap,\u201d but its stock price has declined significantly after touching a 52-week high of $5.81 in March. On Thursday the shares closed at $1.15 in Toronto.\n\nWe didn't get the offer on the terms and within the timeframe we needed\n\nOn Oct. 18, the company said it was looking to raise between $70 million and $80 million to implement a new strategic construction and operating plan that would see it slash its 2020 target capacity from 147,500 kg to between 20,000 and 22,000 kg. The raise would also allow the company to become profitable in the second quarter of 2020, it said.\n\nDaniel Sax, the CEO of Sensi Properties, a cannabis real estate investment company, said it didn\u2019t surprise him to see TGOD try to sell its Ancaster facility. In late August, Hamilton-based Beleave Inc. announced it signed a letter of intent to leaseback its London, Ont., facility in a deal that would net the company $7 million.\n\n\u201c(Real estate) will eventually move off these companies\u2019 books,\u201d Sax said. \u201cYou\u2019re seeing an acceleration of that happening in which the free flowing money in the public markets is just no longer there. The time these companies could raise $200 million overnight is gone so they\u2019re looking around at alternate financing sources.\u201d\n\nSax was also not surprised to see that the property hadn\u2019t sold, saying that the $94 million asking price was \u201cout of line.\u201d\n\n\u201cCannabis companies tend to think it is worth what they put into the facility and from a real estate valuation standpoint it is not at all,\u201d he said.\n\nBecause the cannabis industry is still in its infancy and it\u2019s difficult to say which companies will still be operating in 15 years, any kind of long-term deal could come with risks for prospective buyers.\n\nIf a cannabis producer were to fail after selling its property in such a manner, Sax said the property would immediately be worth significantly less because it would no longer have a licensed producer operating inside.\n\nTrina Fraser, a cannabis lawyer with Brazeau Seller Law, said that a landlord would not be able to automatically take on the licence of a producer.\n\n\u201cIf all they\u2019re buying is the land then no, you\u2019re not able as the landlord to say \u2018You\u2019re in default under your lease and I\u2019m stepping in your shoes to continue operating this business,\u2019\u201d Fraser said. \u201cThe licence doesn\u2019t automatically go with the property.\u201d", "description": "The Ontario-based company has invested $107 million in the facility and its equipment", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/marijuana-1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
