In Game 1, Ronald Acu\u00f1a Jr. hit a two-run homer off of Carlos Mart\u00ednez in the ninth inning, helping close what was a four-run deficit. An exited Acu\u00f1a who, earlier in the game did not run hard out of the box on what turned into a long single that he thought had home run distance, gesticulated wildly towards his dugout as he rounded the bases. After the game, Mart\u00ednez said of Acu\u00f1a, \u201cI wanted him to respect the game and respect me as a veteran player.\u201d\n\nThings were civil between the two sides in Games 2, 3, and 4. In Game 5, the Cardinals hung a 10-spot in the top of the first inning, giving Jack Flaherty a virtually insurmountable cushion before he ever took the mound. Flaherty threw a great game, holding the Braves to one run across six innings. He made only two mistakes: allowing a solo home run to Josh Donaldson in the fourth inning, and hitting Acu\u00f1a with a fastball in the fifth. Acu\u00f1a wasn\u2019t happy about it, understandably. Warnings were issued to both sides and the game went on without any further incident?\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nIt\u2019s tough to say, as an outsider, if Flaherty clearly intended to hit Acu\u00f1a. Flaherty was ahead 1-2. Catcher Yadier Molina set up inside and Flaherty missed his spot by a lot. It doesn\u2019t seem like the most obvious spot to hit Acu\u00f1a. Others would say that provided the necessary subterfuge for plausible deniability, plus the Cardinals had almost no risk in giving Acu\u00f1a a free base.\n\nAfter the game Flaherty denied hitting Acu\u00f1a on purpose, but also inadvertently tipped his hand. Per Jeff Jones, Flaherty said:\n\nStory continues\n\nWe were trying to go in. WE\u2019ve got two strikes on him, we were trying to go in. If we\u2019re gonna go in, we\u2019re gonna go in tight. It hit him. He took exception to it. That\u2019s the guy he wants to be. That\u2019s how it is. He\u2019s been having all his antics all series. The guy hits a ball off the wall, he gets a single out of it. So he wants to take exception to it, he can do whatever he wants. He can talk all he wants. But we tried to go in, we talk, our scouting report is go in, we go in. So it got away, it hit him. He wants to take exception to it, he can do whatever he wants.\n\nThat Flaherty pointed to Acu\u00f1a\u2019s \u201cantics,\u201d even while denying intent, points to intent.\n\nFurthermore, manager Mike Shildt used Acu\u00f1a\u2019s behavior in his postgame rallying speech to his team. Bench player Randy Arozarena live streamed the speech, which probably won\u2019t sit well with anyone with the Cardinals. STL Sports Central has the video in which Shildt says, \u201cThe [Braves] started some [stuff]. We finished the [stuff]. And that\u2019s how we roll. No one [messes] with us ever. Now, I don\u2019t give a [hoot] who we play. We\u2019re gonna [mess] them up. We\u2019re gonna take it right to them the whole [freaking] way. We\u2019re gonna kick their [freaking] [butt].\u201d\n\nAcu\u00f1a\u2019s behavior was clearly on the Cardinals\u2019 mind all series long. Given his postgame denial and Shildt\u2019s speech, the claim there was no intent behind Flaherty\u2019s pitch looks spurious at best.", "description": "The Cardinals weren't the biggest fans of Ronald Acu\u00f1a Jr. during the NLDS.
