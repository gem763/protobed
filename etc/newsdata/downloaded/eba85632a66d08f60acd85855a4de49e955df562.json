The shock of Mulvaney\u2019s admission was only compounded by the flippancy with which he delivered it: For those troubled by it, he told reporters, \u201cget over it.\u201d Mulvaney later walked the claim back, but even in the eyes of the president\u2019s closest confidants, the damage was done. For a White House staffer, there is perhaps no worse place to be than in Sean Hannity\u2019s crosshairs, and that\u2019s where Mulvaney found himself yesterday, after undercutting the administration\u2019s talking points on impeachment in a way that not even a Trump-loving Fox News host could spin. Shortly after the press conference, Hannity excoriated the acting chief on his radio show: \u201cWhat is Mulvaney even talking about?\u201d Hannity scoffed. \u201cI just think he\u2019s dumb, I really do. I don\u2019t even think he knows what he\u2019s talking about. That\u2019s my take on it.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, in the course of combusting the White House\u2019s narrative on impeachment, Mulvaney unwittingly demonstrated why, at this fraught moment in Trump\u2019s presidency, he may be untouchable: Should Trump fire him and leave him aggrieved, Mulvaney could prove a damaging witness in Congress\u2019s impeachment investigation.\n\nA former White House official said Trump \u201cwill be feeling the pain of having pushed out [former National Security Adviser John] Bolton at a very inopportune time. He won\u2019t make the same mistake with Mulvaney, however frustrated he may be with him. Now, their interests are aligned. They sink or swim together.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Plott", "Theatlantic.Com Politics Archive Mick-Mulvaney-Impeachment"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
