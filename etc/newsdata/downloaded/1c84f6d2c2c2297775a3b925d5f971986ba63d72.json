Kurdish-led fighters repelled the Islamist extremists and had held the town with the backing of American troops until President Trump abruptly withdrew them from the region last week.\n\nSyrian state television showed about half a dozen Syrian soldiers milling around a pickup truck mounted with a machine gun. They were greeted by a small crowd of local residents, some of whom carried portraits of Mr. Assad.", "description": "Hours after the Kurds forged a deal with their onetime enemies in the Syrian government, the Syrian Army raced northwest to help battle Turkish-led forces.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/14/world/14syria-briefing/14syria-briefing-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
