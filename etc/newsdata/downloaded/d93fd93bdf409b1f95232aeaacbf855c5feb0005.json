He also argued that he made the move fair and square and without the advantage of a tow.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

It is such a strange deal to have. If Seb gets past, he gets past, and Ferrari wins. It's just a very strange situation to be in.\"\n\nVettel ultimately retired with an engine failure, allowing Hamilton to take advantage of the ensuing virtual safety car period by taking a free pit stop and assuming the lead.\n\nOn a miserable afternoon for Ferrari, Leclerc then dropped behind Valtteri Bottas after a gamble to stop for fresh tyres backfired.\n\nHamilton went on to claim his ninth victory of the year to move 73 points clear of Bottas in the standings and 107 ahead of Leclerc with just 130 points to play for.\n\nThe British driver, 34, could now wrap up his sixth world championship as early as next month's Mexican Grand Prix.\n\n\"We are just trying to take things one race at a time, put one foot in front of the other and not stumble,\" said Hamilton.\n\n\"When you have a battle like this, you're working flat out, turning over every stone and questioning every little thing you can do better. We love that challenge and I'm really excited for the next races.\"\n\nPA", "description": "Jenson Button has questioned Ferrari's controversial decision to strike a tactical deal before Sunday's Russian Grand Prix.
