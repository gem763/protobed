Prime Minister Hun Sen, in office since 1985, and Mr. Rainsy have tangled for more than a quarter-century, with the opposition leader twice going into extended periods of exile.\n\n\u201cLet us return to take back our homes, our land and our country from Hun Sen!\u201d a defiant Mr. Rainsy told a rally of his Cambodia National Rescue Party last month in Australia, vowing to bring a delegation of party leaders and some 2 million Cambodian migrant workers with him when he goes home. \u201cDon\u2019t let him rob them from us.\u201d\n\nNot many people expect Mr. Rainsy, 70, to arrive in the capital Phnom Penh, after authorities warned they have \u201cprepared handcuffs\u201d for him. He has not been in the country since late 2015 to avoid what were widely condemned as politically motivated convictions on defamation and other charges, while continuing to oversee the CNRP while abroad.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see how Sam Rainsy braves the risks on his own and returns to Cambodia, unless he is well-protected diplomatically and well-escorted physically, like a puppet to someone,\u201d said Chhang Song, who recently retired as an adviser to the prime minister.\n\nMr. Chhang, who was once information minister for ill-fated, U.S.-backed government of Cambodian President Lon Nol before it collapsed in 1975, predicted Mr. Rainsy would face a cool reception on his return.\n\n\u201cThough having been initially strongly popular, Sam Rainsy is an aristocrat to the teeth and is losing considerably his support from the Cambodian people as he has failed many of his promises,\u201d he said in an interview.\n\nCraig Etcheson, a founder of the Phnom Penh-based Documentation Center of Cambodia charting the abuses of the 1975-79 Khmer Rouge regime, also was skeptical in an interview that the opposition leader would actually come back.\n\n\u201cI do not expect that he will return,\u201d Mr. Etcheson said. \u201cRainsy has publicly announced several times that he will return to face the multiple legal cases against him, but he has never actually done so without the prospect of a royal pardon\u201d \u2014 a pardon Mr. Etcheson said was highly unlikely.\n\n\u201cClaiming that he will return to Cambodia does seem to cause a mild amount of turbulence inside the Phnom Penh regime, but on the other hand, repeatedly assuring his supporters that he will return and then failing to follow through may also gradually degrade both his own credibility and the esprit of his followers,\u201d Mr. Etcheson added.\n\nMr. Rainsy repeatedly promised he would return home, including a no-show last September after he promised to \u201cconfiscate the ill-gotten fortune of the Hun Sen family and their cronies.\u201d\n\nThe pending November return is timed to coincide with the national celebrations to mark Cambodia\u2019s independence from colonial France in 1953.\n\nMr. Rainsy and his followers may be counting on international pressure to protect him, but the Hun Sen government has proven impervious to outside pressure in the past.\n\n\u201cMr. Rainsy is a convicted person,\u201d Justice Ministry spokesman Chin Malin said Aug. 17. \u201cWhen he returns, our authorities will implement the court order and arrest him.\u201d\n\nThe Foreign Ministry recently told Cambodia\u2019s embassies not to issue visas to six European Parliament members or anyone else wanting to escort Mr. Rainsy to Phnom Penh. And the government warned Mr. Rainsy\u2019s supporters not to protect him if he arrives.\n\n\u201cPlease do not use yourselves as shields for the convicts. It is useless,\u201d said Hun Sen\u2019s Cambodian People\u2019s Party spokesman Sok Eysan on Aug. 18. \u201cFor those convicts, the authorities have prepared handcuffs for them.\n\n\u201cNov. 9 is Independence Day for Cambodian people in the whole country. It is not a day for convicts and rebel groups,\u201d Mr. Eysan said.\n\nBut opposition leaders say Sam Rainsy\u2019s leadership is badly needed to challenge the government\u2019s increasing grip on power.\n\n\u201cRainsy has been very effective from outside Cambodia, but inside Cambodia, people are being arrested and imprisoned on suspicion of supporting him. The pressure on him to return has been intense,\u201d Rich Garella, a onetime press secretary to Mr. Rainsy, said in an interview.\n\n\u201cIt appears that he [Hun Sen] is very worried, since he is using threats and intimidation to discourage Rainsy from returning,\u201d he added.\n\nAnd Mr. Rainsy appears ready to defy Hun Sen one more time.\n\n\u201cI appeal to all armed forces \u2014 brothers, sons and nephews \u2014 not to listen to dictators, don\u2019t take orders from dictators to kill our own people,\u201d he told last month\u2019s party rally in Australia, according to a report by Radio Free Asia.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
