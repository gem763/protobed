Combatting election manipulation is now one of the company\u2019s stated priorities.\n\nRecall also the quiet, protracted fessing-up Facebook did around the part it played in Myanmar\u2019s genocide against Muslims.\n\nMost famously, this strategy benefited Facebook during the Cambridge Analytica scandal, where successive drips of information showed the company\u2019s knowledge of possible malfeasance stretched back farther and the scale of misuse was larger than initially reported, all as momentum around the rapidly complicating story dwindled.\n\nUnfortunately, the strategy appears to be working, more or less.\n\nYou might be wondering why we\u2019re talking about this again, now, and the answer, of course, is that Facebook is pulling its favourite trick again. Remember how, in the wake of the Cambridge scandal, the platform decided to take a long, hard look at how much access it was providing to developers and the largely unvetted apps they were dumping onto the social network?\n\nZuckerberg promised, in March of 2018, to \u201cinvestigate all apps that had access to large amounts of information before we changed our platform to dramatically reduce data access in 2014\u201d. By May, the platform suspended around 200 apps, and that number doubled by August. Now, over a year later, Facebook informed the public that \u201ctens of thousands have been suspended for a variety of reasons\u201d.\n\nTens of thousands! How many tens? What happened to all the numbers between 400 and a theoretically infinite number of thousands? By way of explanation, Facebook noted that:\n\nWe initially identified apps for investigation based on how many users they had and how much data they could access. Now, we also identify apps based on signals associated with an app\u2019s potential to abuse our policies.\n\nThe platform claims that, somehow, these tens of thousands of potentially abusive apps were only associated with around 400 individual developers, and that many were \u201cstill in their testing phase\u201d.\n\nWill we, at some point in the future, learn our data was even less secure than we currently believe and that there were considerably more untoward apps floating around Facebook? As the company repeatedly noted in this week\u2019s blog post, \u201cour investigation is not yet complete\u201d.", "description": "The most powerful tool in Facebook\u2019s considerable arsenal isn\u2019t its incalculable trove of user data or yearly revenue that exceeds the GDP of more than a few sovereign nations \u2014 it\u2019s the platform\u2019s ability to spread out any PR disaster over months or years so that all but the most dogged beat reporters stop...", "authors": ["David Tracy", "Ryan F.
