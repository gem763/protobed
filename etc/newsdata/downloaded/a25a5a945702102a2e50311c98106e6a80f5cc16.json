Elijah Cummings, Democratic leader and regular Trump target, dies at 68", "language": "en", "text": "After undergoing an unspecified medical procedure, the Democratic leader did not return to his office this week, the Baltimore Sun reported. A statement from his office said that he had passed away due to \u201ccomplications concerning longstanding health challenges.\"\n\nBorn to a family of Southern sharecroppers and Baptist preachers, Mr. Cummings grew up in the racially fractured Baltimore of the 1950s and 1960s. At 11, he helped integrate a local swimming pool while being attacked with bottles and rocks. \u201cPerry Mason,\u201d the popular TV series about a fictional defense lawyer, inspired him to enter the legal profession.\n\n\u201cMany young men in my neighborhood were going to reform school,\u201d he told the East Texas Review. \u201cThough I didn\u2019t completely know what reform school was, I knew that Perry Mason won a lot of cases. I also thought that these young men probably needed lawyers.\u201d\n\nIn the Maryland House of Delegates, he became the youngest chairman of the Legislative Black Caucus and the first African American to serve as speaker pro tempore, the member who presides in the speaker\u2019s absence.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn 1996, he won the seat in the U.S. House of Representatives that Kweisi Mfume (D) vacated to become NAACP president. Mr. Cummings eventually served as chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus and as ranking Democrat and then chairman of what became the House Oversight and Reform Committee.\n\nHe drew national attention as Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s chief defender during 2015 congressional hearings into her handling of the attack three years earlier on U.S. government facilities in Benghazi, Libya. The attack killed U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans.\n\nHe was \u201cthe quintessential speaking-truth-to-power representative,\u201d said Herbert C. Smith, a political science professor at McDaniel College in Westminster, Md. \u201cCummings has never shied from a very forceful give-and-take.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe death of Freddie Gray\n\nBaltimore\u2019s plight informed Mr. Cummings\u2019s life and work on Capitol Hill, a connection exemplified by his response to the death of 25-year-old Freddie Gray in April 2015 and the explosion of outrage that came after it.\n\nGray died of injuries suffered while riding, improperly secured, in a police van after he was arrested for carrying a knife, in his pocket, that police said was illegal. His death ignited rioting in Baltimore and elevated tensions nationally over perceived racism and excessive violence in law enforcement.\n\nSpeaking at the funeral, Mr. Cummings, who lived near where Gray was arrested, bemoaned the presence of media to chronicle Gray\u2019s death without celebrating his life.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cDid you see him? Did you see him?\u201d Mr. Cummings asked in his booming baritone. The church exploded with applause, and civil rights activist Jesse L. Jackson sat, rapt, behind him. \u201cDid you see him?\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve often said, our children are the living messages we send to a future we will never see,\u201d he said, his voice rising. \u201cBut now our children are sending us to a future they will never see! There\u2019s something wrong with that picture!\u201d\n\nWhen looting began, hours after the funeral, Mr. Cummings rushed, bullhorn in hand, to a troubled West Baltimore neighborhood, where he worked to restore order and to assure residents that authorities were taking the case seriously. (Six officers would be charged in Gray\u2019s death, although prosecutors failed to secure a conviction against any of them.)\n\nAD\n\nAmid the unrest, he and a dozen other residents marched, arm in arm, through the streets, singing \u201cThis Little Light of Mine.\u201d\n\nMr. Cummings was known for showing the same kind of commitment in the House. The bullhorn he wielded in West Baltimore was emblazoned with a gold label that read, \u201cThe gentleman will not yield.\u201d It was a gift from his Democratic colleagues, bestowed after Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) silenced Mr. Cummings\u2019s microphone at a 2014 hearing into complaints that the Internal Revenue Service had unfairly targeted conservative nonprofit groups.\n\nAD\n\nThe next year, while serving on the House Select Committee on Benghazi, he sparred with Chairman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) during hearings Republicans convened to examine Clinton\u2019s role in the Benghazi debacle.\n\nAD\n\nWhen Gowdy interrogated Clinton about Libya-related emails sent from a longtime confidant of hers, Sidney Blumenthal, Mr. Cummings interjected: \u201cGentleman, yield! Gentleman, yield! You have made several inaccurate statements.\u201d\n\nTalking to reporters in the hallway later, Mr. Cummings said his primary purpose was not to defend Clinton but to seek \u201cthe truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet the world see it,\u201d he said.\n\nThe experience didn\u2019t appear to sour Gowdy on Mr. Cummings.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about politics to him; he says what he believes,\u201d Gowdy told the Hill newspaper. \u201cAnd you can tell the ones who are saying it because it was in a memo they got that morning, and you can tell the ones who it\u2019s coming from their soul. And with Mr. Cummings, it\u2019s coming from his soul.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDealing With Trump\n\nThe first two years of the Trump administration were agonizing for Mr. Cummings. While battling ill health, including heart surgery, and as many other democrats advocated a strategy of resistance to the divisive president, he made fruitless efforts to work with the newly elected Republican in the White House and found himself sidelined by his House colleagues in the GOP majority.\n\nIn a bipartisan gesture, he attended Trump\u2019s inauguration and, at the luncheon afterward, raised an issue on which he felt they could find common ground, lowering prescription drug prices. In that and in future encounters, he urged the president to pursue policies that could unite the country and burnish his legacy. The congressman said that after a few promising meetings, he never heard from Trump again.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cPerhaps if I knew then what I know now, I wouldn\u2019t have had a lot of hope,\u201d Mr. Cummings later remarked. \u201cHe is a man who quite often calls the truth a lie and calls a lie the truth.\u201d\n\nAs ranking Democrat on the Oversight Committee, Mr. Cummings became a leading voice against the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to add a citizenship question to the 2020 Census, a change that critics contended would discourage participation by documented and undocumented immigrants alike.\n\nHe was also a forceful opponent of an immigration policy that separated thousands of children from their parents after they illegally crossed the southern U.S. border. He described the Trump White House as inhumane in its use of \u201cchild internment camps.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAfter Democrats won control of the House in the November 2018 midterm elections, Mr. Cummings was elevated to chairman of the Oversight Committee, a position that he used to sound further alarms. He spearheaded probes into security clearances issued by the White House over the objections of career officials and payments made during the 2016 campaign to silence women who claimed to have had affairs with Trump.\n\nAD\n\nMr. Cummings had a combative streak, but he was adept at calming volatile situations, such as the sharp exchange between Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) and Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) during a hearing in February 2019.\n\nThe Oversight Committee was taking testimony from Michael Cohen, Trump\u2019s former personal lawyer, and Tlaib accused Meadows of pulling a \u201cracist\u201d stunt by having a black woman, an administration employee, stand behind him. Meadows demanded that her words be stricken from the record.\n\nMr. Cummings called Meadows \u201cone of my best friends\u201d and prompted Tlaib to say that she was not calling Meadows a racist. By the next day, the conservative Meadows and liberal freshman Tlaib were hugging in public.\n\n\u201cInteraction, man,\u201d Mr. Cummings said by way of explanation. \u201cHuman interaction, that\u2019s all.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nLawyer and lawmaker\n\nElijah Eugene Cummings was born in Baltimore on Jan. 18, 1951. His father worked at a chemical factory, his mother at a pickle factory and later as a maid while raising seven children. Both parents came from sharecropping families in South Carolina. Although they struggled to feed their family, his parents would can apples and peaches and give half the preserves to people in need.\n\nThe proprietor of a Baltimore drugstore where Mr. Cummings worked paid his application fee to Howard University and, during Mr. Cummings\u2019s time as a Howard student, regularly sent him $10 with a note that read, \u201cHang in there.\u201d\n\nAt Howard, he served as student government president, and he received a bachelor\u2019s degree in political science in 1973. He received a law degree from the University of Maryland three years later and practiced law, mostly in private practice, for nearly two decades.\n\nHe also helped law students develop their oral and writing skills as chief judge on the Maryland Moot Court, a competition in which students submit briefs and present oral arguments in a hypothetical appellate case.\n\nIn the Maryland House of Delegates, where Mr. Cummings served from 1983 to 1996, he championed a ban on alcohol and tobacco ads on inner-city billboards in Baltimore \u2014 the first prohibition of its kind in a major U.S. city.\n\nOn Capitol Hill, Mr. Cummings was among the minority of House members and senators who voted in 2002 against authorizing a military invasion of Iraq. President George W. Bush\u2019s administration, in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, was alleging that Iraq continued to possess and develop weapons of mass destruction. Mr. Cummings said there was not sufficient evidence of such weapons to \u201csend our young people off to war and thereby place their lives in harm\u2019s way,\u201d an opinion supported by subsequent investigations.\n\nAlso in 2002, Mr. Cummings was elected chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, a position he used to push for increased funding for public education and the Head Start program.\n\nHe was the only member of the House delegation from Maryland to oppose the release of the Starr Report, which contained salacious details of President Bill Clinton\u2019s affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.\n\nHis first marriage, to Joyce Matthews, ended in divorce after a long separation. In 2008, he married Maya Rockeymoore, a policy consultant. Besides his wife, survivors include a daughter from his first marriage; and two children from other relationships.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, he had financial difficulties. He was sued by creditors and owed $30,000 in federal taxes, which he eventually paid. He told the Baltimore Sun that during his time as a congressman, he endured two winters without heat because he could not afford to fix his furnace.\n\nHe has said the money problems stemmed from his struggles to keep his law practice afloat while running for Congress and also from helping to support his three children. \u201cI have a moral conscience that is real central,\u201d he told the newspaper. \u201cI didn\u2019t ask the federal government or anyone else to do me any favors.\u201d\n\nMr. Cummings said he considered running to succeed Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.), who did not seek reelection in 2016, but decided that he was needed in Baltimore to help the riot-torn city.\n\nA member of New Psalmist Baptist Church in Baltimore, Mr. Cummings said he was driven by his faith and secure in his conviction that history would recognize his resolve to stand up for what he believed was right.\n\n\u201cIn the city of Baltimore, there are over a thousand monuments, and not one monument is erected to memorialize a critic,\u201d he once said in a speech. \u201cEvery one of the monuments is erected to memorialize one who was severely criticized.", "description": "Rep.
