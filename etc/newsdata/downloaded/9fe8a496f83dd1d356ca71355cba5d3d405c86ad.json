REUTERS/Francois Lenoir/File Photo\n\nIn a document that is part of draft budget plans submitted to the European Commission on Tuesday, the government said it expects economic output to expand by 2.1% this year, less than a previous forecast of 2.2%. It sees growth of 1.8% next year, below a previous forecast of 1.9%.\n\nSpain has mostly had caretaker or minority governments for years, meaning the budget has often been simply rolled over from one year to the next.\n\nSpaniards will vote on Nov. 10 in the country\u2019s fourth parliamentary election in four years. A caretaker government has been in place since an inconclusive poll in April.\n\nSpain left the budget deficit forecast unchanged from its target of 2% of gross domestic product this year, but raised it to 1.7% of GDP from a previous 1.1% for 2020.\n\nThis takes into account the fact that new taxes, including on global technology companies, that were planned earlier this year could not be adopted in parliament.\n\nThe Budget Ministry said the forecast for 2020 could be revised if and when Spain is able to form a government and pass a budget in parliament.\n\nThe euro zone\u2019s fourth largest economy has consistently outperformed much of Europe since it emerged from a five-year slump in 2013, and the 2019 forecast still points to a growth well above the projected 1.1% growth rate for the currency bloc.\n\nThe ministry said in the document that Spanish growth would moderate from previous years, citing \u201can increasingly uncertain international context marked by the slowdown in economic activity and the persistence of commercial and geopolitical tensions that affect international trade and investment\u201d.\n\nThe Budget Ministry said the cut in the growth forecast was also due to a change in the methodology Spain uses to calculate GDP.\n\nThe figures sent to Brussels include a 0.9% raise in state pensions and a 2% in public workers\u2019 salaries, but otherwise largely keep to the budget approved in 2018 by the previous conservative government of Mariano Rajoy.\n\nIn a recent TV interview, acting Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said that, if elected next month, he aimed to get a budget approved by parliament in the first quarter of 2020.\n\nOn Tuesday, Economy Minister Nadia Calvino told RNE radio she could not rule out a global economic crisis but that \u201cthe probability right now (is) not very high, nobody sees Europe entering into recession in the short term, and less so Spain\u201d.\n\nOn Monday, European Central Bank Vice-President Luis de Guindos also ruled out a recession in Europe but foresaw the bloc experiencing lower economic growth for a longer period.\n\nThe government\u2019s downward revisions come after the Bank of Spain said in September that the Spanish economy was likely to grow much more slowly than expected this year due to weaker investment and private consumption and a slowdown in Europe.", "description": "Spain's acting government has lowered its growth forecasts due to domestic and external factors such as trade tensions and raised its deficit estimate, just as political gridlock narrows Madrid's room for maneuver on budgetary matters.", "authors": ["Bel\u00e9n Carre\u00f1o", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1441093804&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E0ZC", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
