Five attackers, a member of the National Guard, a civilian and an escaped prisoner died in the gun battles.\n\nThe elder Guzm\u00e1n has been sentenced to life in prison in the U.S. Ovidio Guzm\u00e1n was indicted in 2018 in Washington, along with a fourth brother, on charges of trafficking cocaine, methamphetamine and marijuana.\n\nThe government said it decided to drop the operation Thursday to avoid further loss of life. Critics say it ceded territory to a cartel.\n\n\u201cWe are not dictators, we are not tyrants,\u201d L\u00f3pez Obrador said Saturday. \u201cWe will always respect the life of all human beings, and that way peace can be achieved.\u201d\n\nMexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard told reporters Saturday that L\u00f3pez Obrador and Trump agreed by phone the two countries will work together to \u201cfreeze\u201d the flow of weapons into Mexico.\n\nThe high caliber, military-grade weapons deployed by cartel members on Thursday are not legal for civilian use in the country and Mexican authorities believe most of them came from the U.S.\n\nEbrard said that he will meet with his U.S. counterparts in the coming days to advance efforts to stem the illicit entry of weapons into Mexico.\n\nMexican officials estimate that more than 200 civilians would have died had they not turned over Ovidio Guzm\u00e1n on Thursday. The cartel enforcers had positioned themselves in front of a housing complex where wives and children of soldiers live.\n\n\u201cMexico has abandoned the idea of collateral damage,\u201d said Ebrard.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said Saturday he received a phone call from U.S. President Donald Trump to express \"solidarity\" over the events this week in the northern Mexican city of Culiacan, where the government backed off from an attempt to arrest a drug suspect in the face of extraordinary cartel violence.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Amy Guthrie"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/19/Mexico_Government_On_The_Run_48470.jpg-e9bda_c0-507-6016-4016_s1200x700.jpg?0f29ac60c9dba85c0bc67643391f18b42d4564f5", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
