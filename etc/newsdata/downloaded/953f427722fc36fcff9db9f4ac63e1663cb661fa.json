They were found among pellets regurgitated by the birds.\n\nSmall bundles of green fishing net and twine from the sea were also discovered among the undigested food, again likely to have been mistaken by the gulls for tasty morsels.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Within just an hour we\u2019d collected thousands of bands and handfuls of fishing waste.\n\n\u201cThe gull breeding season was disappointingly poor in 2019 and these hidden human pressures are doing nothing to help our seabirds.\u201d\n\nMullion Island is a small, rocky outpost off the Lizard Peninsula, cared for by the National Trust, that provides a sanctuary for nesting seabirds including gulls, cormorants and shags.\n\nNumbers of great black-backed gull have fallen by nearly one-third in recent years, while the herring gull \u2013 the species notorious for pinching food from tourists \u2013 now appears on the UK Red List of Birds of Conservation Concern.\n\nThe National Trust said it was distressing to see seabirds becoming victims of human activity, and called on businesses to consider how they dispose of plastic, latex and other materials that could harm wildlife.\n\nMark Avery, a bird scientist and former conservation director of the RSPB, told The Independent it was another example of how humans polluting the oceans was having consequences for birds and mammals in the food chain.\n\n\u201cSwallowing rubber bands will reduce the amount of space in a bird\u2019s stomach for proper food and nutrition,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe know that bits of plastic remain stuck in birds\u2019 guts and bit by bit get broken down. Rubber bands won\u2019t be good for them, and might actually be very bad.\n\n\u201cSeabirds can live up to 25 years so that\u2019s more than two decades of hoovering up all the rubbish we chuck in the oceans.\u201d", "description": "When an uninhabited island became littered with thousands of brown, yellow and green elastic bands, experts were initially baffled.
