Photos by Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images and Eva Hambach/AFP/Getty Images.\n\nWay back in 2017, John Oliver started calling the early Trump-era scandals \u201cStupid Watergates.\u201d This blossomed over the years into a series of segments on episodes in the Donald Trump presidency that could be characterized as \u201ca scandal with all the potential ramifications of Watergate, but where everyone involved is stupid and bad at everything.\u201d He could have aired such episodes almost daily, but at some juncture, the Stupid Watergates just morphed into our daily political lives. As Oliver would continue to argue, the question was always less \u201cWhat did the president know and when did he know it,\u201d as it was \u201cIs the president physically capable of knowing things at all?\u201d\n\nLater, Oliver would say of the series that \u201cunfortunately, it was supposed to be just a self-contained joke, but current events are making it more and more relevant. Which is not normally how jokes work.\u201d Stupid Watergate lived on, but the formulation also helps explain the speed with which we seem to be waking up to the joke. As my colleague Lili Loofbourow explains, \u201cAmericans still don\u2019t quite believe that things that are done in the open are bad; it might be a joke, or a bit, or a performance, or a mistake. (We can\u2019t even agree that Trump is lying because maybe he believes in his heart that the \u2018falsehood\u2019 is true.) Convincing the public of ill intent seems to require a \u2018revelation\u2019 or an \u2018exposure\u2019 or a secret.\u201d Everyone was so persuaded Donald Trump was always joking that we couldn\u2019t quite get John Oliver\u2019s joke.\n\nAs a general matter, jokes are funny because they are at least partially true. Here, we have crossed a line where the joke is so true, it\u2019s hardly funny. Donald Trump is not competent and many of the people with whom he surrounds himself\u2014until he fires them\u2014are not competent either. The primary work of his highest officials appears to have been hiding evidence of his malfeasance and ineptitude from us and pretending that work was heroic. Donald Trump never made sense in gatherings of foreign leaders, or among the victims of tragedies, or in any setting that wasn\u2019t a staged stadium rally or photo-op. But somehow, we stopped believing that he would be caught out for this gross incompetence and absurdity, or even for the inherent lawlessness and corruption, and tried to laugh it all off. In the face of outrageous immorality, we were told we had a derangement problem.\n\nJokes are funny because they are at least partially true. Here, we have crossed a line where the joke is so true, it\u2019s hardly funny.\n\nThat seems to have changed. Welcome to Stupid Watergate, Part 1,000, in which the joke is finally not on you. Welcome to Stupid Watergate, in which somehow, after nearly three years of pinging around inside the \u201cnothing matters\u201d shruggy emoji, within the span of one week, something is finally, possibly, maybe going to stick. Donald Trump may actually be brought down\u2014by an entirely unforced error involving his obsession with an insane Fox News talking point about Ukrainian \u201ccorruption,\u201d Joe Biden, and, of course\u2014because it\u2019s Stupid Watergate\u2014Hillary\u2019s emails. The spectacular flameout of Rudy Giuliani, the implosion at the State Department, and the president\u2019s mounting incoherence also swirled together to propel the meltdown along. As the days roll on, nobody can seemingly help themselves from implicating everybody else, which makes the fast-track impeachment inquiry more a clipping service than an imponderable mystery.\n\nAnd because it\u2019s Stupid Watergate, it\u2019s not just the cover-up, or even just the crime, but also the scorching ineptitude. Don\u2019t for a moment forget about the myriad people who were alarmed by Trump\u2019s efforts to get Ukraine to find dirt on his political opponent and yet did nothing, as well as the deeply stupid people who were alarmed by Trump\u2019s efforts to get Ukraine to find dirt on his political opponent and tried to bury it. Because that there is some next-level stupid. And that too continues to unspool as we learn that other phone calls, with Russia and Saudi Arabia, were similarly disappeared.\n\nFrom even the early days of Oliver\u2019s \u201cStupid Watergate,\u201d these scandals have followed the same general arc. Generally the pattern has been that Trump and his incandescently mediocre family and hapless enablers do something moronic (such as suggesting that Obama wiretapped him) and we all recoil in horror. That is followed by hasty claims that this was just Trump being Trump, and what can you do. As a result of the soft bigotry of ever-lowered expectations, the Trumpier Trump acted, the shruggier we became, until it actually appeared that he was slyly enrolling Americans in tolerating the stupidity and training us to accept yet more of the same. At some midpoint in this incubus, it seemed that nothing would ever seem stupid, or at least surprisingly stupid, ever again. And that is where the joke went to die.\n\nGet the Angle in Your Inbox Slate\u2019s sharpest takes, curated and distilled by Slate\u2019s copy desk, delivered to your inbox every day.

And yet Donald Trump seems to have dispatched Giuliani, his modern-day Roy Cohn/Michael Cohen/Watergate plumber, not to pay hush money to porn stars, as any respectable fixer might, but to advance Trump\u2019s personal political ambitions under the guise of international diplomacy. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Giuliani, who has soaked far too long in the Hofstadter bath bomb of deep state/Biden-gate/but-her-emails logic, actually believes he should be lauded as a hero for his efforts to follow through on Trump\u2019s requests. But even the staunchest of Trump\u2019s defenders must be wondering who authorized Trump\u2019s personal attorney to lope around the globe, possibly without security clearance, pressuring sovereign leaders of foreign nations into interning for the Trump 2020 campaign. The State Department was unequivocal on this one point: \u201cMr. Giuliani is a private citizen and acts in a personal capacity as a lawyer for President Trump. He does not speak on behalf of the U.S. Government.\u201d When Giuliani defended himself by insisting that he was authorized because he was working alongside actual government employees Kurt Volker and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, it turned out he was just accidentally throwing these men under the bus to be flattened right along with him.\n\nGiuliani aside, the other reason it\u2019s taken some time for the country to figure out how to respond to the onslaught of Stupid Watergates is because Donald Trump, while certainly often his own worst enemy, has perennially managed to also be his own best asset. His lies are so outlandish that everyone believes they must be jokes; his jokes are so grotesque everyone believes they must be lies. His contempt for the law is so acute, everyone starts to doubt that the law is of any fundamental utility. In this case, it\u2019s not even clear that Trump has realized he did anything wrong\u2014the whistleblower\u2019s original complaint makes apparent that everyone in the White House assumed the now-infamous Ukrainian phone call would be routine, probably because Trump thought it was. It seems entirely possible he never saw a problem. (The complaint suggests that while staffers realized they\u2019d need to do something to hide the full substance of the call, Trump was not worried about it.) He was not worried about confessing to two Russian visitors or Lester Holt his real reasons for firing James Comey, either.\n\nThat\u2019s because Trump has one fatal flaw, one that Richard Nixon did not quite share. As a lifelong narcissist, Donald Trump genuinely believes he can do nothing wrong. He perhaps even genuinely believes that anything he has ever done that has been wrong is not, in fact, wrong. He further believes that the presidency is the perfect gig for him because presidents can do nothing illegal. And, somewhat pathetically, he apparently seems to think that if he could just explain his rightness about all things to everyone, we would finally give him the love he so desperately craves. And so, unlike Nixon, who at some point did give himself over to the cover-up, Donald Trump just keeps trying to publicly justify the crimes.\n\nIn the past week alone, instead of just keeping quiet, Donald Trump has instead directed his energies to try to convince us that he is right and we are wrong. He wants us to understand and accept that his threatening calls to foreign leaders are \u201cvery legal and very good,\u201d and also \u201cperfect,\u201d and that a whistleblower and those who spoke to the whistleblower are in fact \u201cclose to\u201d spies who should be executed for treason. When hundreds of former foreign service officers express horror at Trump\u2019s antics, and his behavior shows him to be manifestly unwell, he keeps repeating that he is perfect and stable and good, because he thinks he is (and after all, his assumption on this point has until now been proved correct).\n\nIt\u2019s unfortunately not even a little bit clear that the Ukraine scandal will be the bracing smack on the nose that brings a majority of a narcotized public back to something that approximates reality. It is clear that we\u2019re hurtling faster and faster toward a reckoning of some kind. It seems perfectly possible that the more Trump tries to cajole and browbeat us into accepting his awesomeness, the worse it will become for him. Perhaps at some point his enablers will have to admit that they\u2019ve wasted three years kissing the ring of an emperor who\u2019s wearing \u2026 well \u2026 nothing but a ring. But it also seems perfectly possible that whatever we\u2019re about to experience will continue to split us into two countries, living two irreconcilable realities, inhabiting two un-gettable jokes\u2014on Sunday night, Trump, quoting Fox News, tweeted that if the impeachment inquiry into him is successful, it will cause a \u201cCivil War like fracture\u201d in America.
