That attitude is represented well by a tweet that went viral last year from The Atlantic's Derek Thompson: \"MoviePass isn't a business so much as a late-capitalist welfare program that redistributes hundreds of millions of dollars from venture capital to subsidize American leisure.\"\n\nThe joke here hinges on the fact that venture capitalists \u2014 who can certainly afford to light a few hundred million dollars on fire \u2014 are the losers. But that's not actually what happened with MoviePass.\n\nThe venture capitalists who invested early in MoviePass were paid out when the startup was bought by Helios and Matheson Analytics in a deal that valued it at more than $50 million. After Helios and Matheson took a controlling stake in MoviePass in 2017, the service dropped its price to $10 per month, and the gargantuan losses, to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars, began in earnest.\n\nAt the time, Helios and Matheson, which was run by the penny-stock guru Ted Farnsworth and had ties to an Indian company accused of massive fraud, was listed on the Nasdaq with the ticker HMNY. To cover MoviePass' losses, Helios and Matheson flooded the market with millions of new shares.\n\nMany retail investors who believed in the MoviePass product snatched up the new shares, only to see the value of their stakes crater as the stock fell more than 99.99%. Helios and Matheson was eventually kicked off the Nasdaq.\n\nLast summer, I spoke with Helios and Matheson investors who felt betrayed, both by management and by the Wall Street analysts who kept \"buy\" ratings on the stock for months while it plunged, as their firms made millions helping Helios and Matheson sell new shares. One retiree investor, Ken, talked to me about losing around $190,000 from investing in MoviePass.\n\nAs some of my readers pointed out, those investors should have known better. Of course they should have. But it's a lot harder to laugh at an unsophisticated investor who lost a big chunk of his retirement savings \u2014 like Ken did \u2014 than it is to laugh at a venture capitalist who made a bad bet.", "description": "Contrary to a popular media narrative, venture capitalists were not the ones who lost money on MoviePass' downfall.
