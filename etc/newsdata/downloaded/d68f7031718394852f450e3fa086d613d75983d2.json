But all of that is poised to change now that offensive line coach Bill Callahan has been promoted to interim head coach following Gruden\u2019s firing Monday. Callahan said he wants to instill a run-first mentality on offense.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe No. 1 benefactor from the change figures to be Peterson.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hyped about it,\u201d Peterson said. \u201cYou look at the first four weeks \u2026 totally opposite from what we did last year when we were able to be more successful as a team. Like I\u2019ve said, obviously something isn\u2019t working, so there needs to be some kind of change. It feels good to have this change.\u201d\n\nThe Redskins have attempted just 17.6 rushes per game after averaging 25.9 a year ago. Some of the discrepancy can be attributed to the team falling behind and needing to throw the ball to catch up. But Peterson said there have been opportunities to establish more of a rhythm in the running game that the team didn\u2019t take.\n\nAD\n\nPeterson pointed to a seven-yard first-down run late in the first quarter of Sunday\u2019s loss to the New England Patriots called \u201c14 structure\u201d on which he nearly broke loose. Defensive lineman Lawrence Guy was cut to the ground but got up and pulled Peterson down by the tail of his jersey.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt was that close,\u201d Peterson said, snapping his fingers. \u201cI don\u2019t see that play again till the next quarter. It\u2019s like, God, I\u2019m in a rhythm, I\u2019m feeling it, and you just simmer back down on the sideline just anxiously waiting to get back in there to get that look again. Now, I know how Bill loves to run the ball. He might line right back up and run it again. So it\u2019ll be a different mind-set for the guys up front, and we\u2019ll be able to set the tone.\u201d\n\nCallahan has said that he wants to see more rushing attempts out of the offense, and there is more to the strategy than him simply being an old-school coach looking to return to the days of three yards and a cloud of dust. This team doesn\u2019t have the aerial weaponry to throw the ball all over the field the way some NFL offenses can, especially with tight end Jordan Reed out with a concussion. Rookie wideout Terry McLaurin has been a pleasant surprise, but the other receivers have been lacking, and the team still doesn\u2019t have an established starting quarterback. Callahan has said he will announced his starter Friday for Sunday\u2019s game at the Miami Dolphins.\n\nAD\n\nThe hope is a more consistent dedication to the running game will put the team in better down-and-distance situations. Being in third and long often has contributed to Washington\u2019s 31st-ranked third-down conversion rate of 24 percent. And an inability to stay on the field has led to more plays for the defense; the Redskins average the third-lowest time of possession in the NFL at 26 minutes 31 seconds.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe all know we\u2019re going to have to throw the football at some point. This is the National Football League, and you\u2019re going to have to throw the football to win,\u201d Callahan said. \u201c\u2026 But I do think running the ball sets an attitude, sets a physical style. It sends a message, and it puts confidence in your line and your backs. It takes a little bit more pressure off the quarterback as well.\u201d\n\nThe team is averaging 3.9 yards per carry, a total inflated by last week\u2019s 65-yard touchdown run by wide receiver Steven Sims Jr. But Callahan said he is more concerned with the numbers of run attempts and pass completions.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIf you have more than an opponent, really you\u2019re in good shape to win the football game,\u201d Callahan said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very high percentage \u2014 I think it\u2019s over 80 percent. \u2026 It\u2019s not always perfect. \u2026 It\u2019s just an identity that I believe in. So if we can combine those two and create big plays off of it, I think we\u2019ll be successful.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nPeterson and the offensive linemen seem happy with the new direction.\n\n\u201cTo grow up being an offensive lineman, you kind of have to have that in your DNA,\u201d guard Wes Martin said, \u201cto enjoy coming off the ball and moving people against their will. So, yeah, we enjoy that.\u201d\n\nMartin (chest), linebacker Josh Harvey-Clemons (hamstring) and Reed (concussion) did not practice Thursday. Offensive tackle Donald Penn (hamstring) was limited, along with tight end Vernon Davis (concussion), tackle Morgan Moses (shoulder), safety Deshazor Everett (ankle) and guard Brandon Scherff (ankle).\n\nThe Redskins announced Wednesday that they had promoted Phil Rauscher to offensive line coach and hired Aaron Stamn as an offensive assistant.\n\nMore Redskins coverage:\n\nAD", "description": "Washington's interim head coach is hoping to improve the team's time of possession and cut down on third-and-long situations.", "authors": ["Kareem Copeland", "Reporter Covering The Washington Redskins"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Wyb_1TS6sqpzDVaNGpA7dUNrCFY=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/W6A5CPHIQAI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
