Headed into yet another \"crunch\" week for Brexit where anything could happen, the UK is careering towards a true crisis.\n\nA special sitting of parliament on Saturday resulted in another defeat for Johnson. Lawmakers, stung by his repeated efforts to bypass them, slapped him with an amendment that required him to ask the EU to defer Brexit until January 31. Johnson grudgingly sent that letter \u2014 unsigned \u2014 late in the evening. He sent another \u2014 this one he signed \u2014 arguing a further delay would be a mistake.\n\nThere are two things to watch: whether the EU grants an extension and the gyrations in the UK Parliament. Debate on the Withdrawal Agreement Bill (which implements Brexit) could begin as soon as Tuesday, after the prime minister makes another attempt on Monday to get Parliament to sign off on the principle of his deal.\n\nIt's a massive gamble for a leader lacking a parliamentary majority. The whole thing will be decided by a handful of votes. Johnson will need all of his powers of persuasion and famous oratory wit. The ticking clock, and the desire among lawmakers to avoid a chaotic no-deal exit, might help him.\n\nIn the incredible three-year soap opera of Brexit, the finale will be a cliff-hanger.\n\nBloomberg further reported that the UK could crash out of the European Union on October 31 if Parliament rejects Johnson's Brexit deal, a leading cabinet minister warned.\n\n\n\nMichael Gove said he was confident the prime minister had enough support in Parliament to get the agreement over the line as he warned that lawmakers had increased the risk of a no-deal Brexit by forcing Johnson to ask the EU for a delay. A vote on the plan could come as soon as this week.\n\n\n\n\"If we don\u2019t back this deal, then the risk is that the European Council may not grant an extension,\u201d Gove, who is in charge of no-deal Brexit preparations, told Sky TV's \"Sophy Ridge on Sunday\" show. \u201cWe can\u2019t bet on that. It's not a sure thing.\"\n\n\n\nBound by a law he opposed, Johnson on Saturday formally asked the EU to delay Brexit until January 31. But he made clear that he\u2019d rather Britain leave without delay and refused to sign the letter requesting an extension to his Oct. 31 target. European Council President Donald Tusk will now start consulting EU leaders on how to react.", "description": "It's 11 days until the UK is due to shed its European Union membership and, as Prime Minister Boris Johnson so often says, \"take back control\".", "authors": ["Rosalind Mathieson"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8554/c556c70955964b37b1728d241ba2dd43.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
