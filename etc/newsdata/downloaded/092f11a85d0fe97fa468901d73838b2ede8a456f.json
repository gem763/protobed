A company owned by the American billionaire has been lined up as the potential promoter.\n\n\u201cWe are thrilled to announce that Formula One and Hard Rock Stadium have reached an agreement in principle to host the first-ever Formula One Miami Grand Prix at Hard Rock Stadium,\u201d Dolphins CEO Tom Garfinkel and Sean Bratches, Formula One\u2019s managing director of commercial operations, said in a joint statement.\n\n\u201cWith an estimated annual impact of more than $400 million and 35,000 room nights, the Formula One Miami Grand Prix will be an economic juggernaut for South Florida each and every year.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are deeply grateful to our fans, elected officials and the local tourism industry for their patience and support throughout this process,\u201d they said.\n\nFormula One will have a record 22 races next year, with a new race in Vietnam added to the calendar.\n\nThe race would be a second grand prix in the United States after the one in Austin, Texas.\n\nThe plan is expected to be met with opposition from Miami Gardens residents and businesses and will need the approval of the Miami-Dade County Commission to go forward.", "description": "Miami will host a Formula One Grand Prix in May 2021, subject to local government approval, after the sport announced a deal on Tuesday with the city's Hard Rock Stadium.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
