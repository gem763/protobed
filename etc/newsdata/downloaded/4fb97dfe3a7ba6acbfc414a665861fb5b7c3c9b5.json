And Beth has a boyfriend and is also in an open relationship.\n\nThe open relationship works for the trio, who are not in a throuple yet but say they may choose to be in the future.\n\n\u2018A monogamous relationship can sometimes feel like I\u2019m taking my love and shining it like a flashlight on one person,\u2019 says Ryan.\n\n\u2018In a sexually fluid relationship, your love is like a sun and it radiates in all directions.\u2019\n\nDarrien (right) and Ryan got spiritually married after two months of meeting (Picture: SWNS)\n\nRyan, a music producer, and Darrien, a meditation guide, met on MeetMindful, a dating app for mindful people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDarrien said: \u2018I joined the app because I wanted to meet people who were into the conscious lifestyle and aware of what they ate, how they felt and the choices they were making.\n\n\u2018I originally downloaded the app to talk to girls, but before I changed my preferences, Ryan\u2019s face popped up.\n\n\u2018We met shortly after. We fell in love right away. Love is limitless and we don\u2019t have to put a lock on love.\n\n\u2018He told me that he was also fluid and he had an attraction to both sexes.\n\n\u2018We decided to be in an open relationship and that we were going to see each other and other people too.\u2019\n\nDarrien met Beth on Tinder (Picture: SWNS)\n\nMoving in together after two weeks, the couple opted against a legal marriage because they didn\u2019t want the government to define their love.\n\nIn October 2018, the pair travelled to the Sequoia National Forest in California for their wedding, changing their surnames to Seqqo\u00ffa in honor of their ceremony.\n\nIn July, Darrien began dating Beth, a student and hairstylist, who she had met on Tinder 18 months before.\n\nSpeaking of her girlfriend Beth, Darrien said: \u2018It felt like we had known each other for a long time. It\u2019s been really cool to be able to nurture this feminine bond.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRyan initially had some doubts about Darrien\u2019s relationship with Beth.\n\nHe said: \u2018At first I was a little hesitant about Beth.\n\n\u2018She was a relationship from the past and we were growing and releasing old patterns and creating new realities for ourselves, not just following our physical desires.\n\nRyan is in one relationship only at the moment but is open to more in future (Picture: SWNS)\n\n\u2018But once I met Beth I knew it was a genuine thing. It\u2019s all love and I can feel the love and it\u2019s great to just get more and more love.\n\n\u2018I can feel jealous but I have to remember that it\u2019s free and open love. We want to allow each other to be the best version of ourselves.\u2019\n\nAlthough Ryan says \u2018doesn\u2019t have time\u2019 to date other people right now, he believes that in the future he will have his own girlfriend or boyfriend or become a \u2018throuple\u2019.\n\nHe continued: \u2018I\u2019m just going with the flow and whatever is meant to be, will be. It\u2019s not something I\u2019m pushing or forcing at all.\u2019\n\nBeth added: \u2018I get to enjoy the best of both worlds. They are night and day.\n\n\u2018There are two parts of me that feel completed. It\u2019s possible to love more than one person.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Love is something that can be spread rather than just contained to one person.\u2019\n\nMORE: Falling for a polyamorous man changed what I thought love was\n\nMORE: Polyamorous triad with three kids want more children and are open to more lovers\n\nMORE: Are we moving towards a society where everyone is polyamorous or in open relationships?\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Darrien Leathers, 23, and Ryan Meyers, 27 had a 'spiritual marriage' and some months later Darrien entered a relationship with Beth Sanchez.", "authors": ["Faima Bakar"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_92954834_1572259620.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
