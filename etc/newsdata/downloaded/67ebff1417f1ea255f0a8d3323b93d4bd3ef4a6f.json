Developed by Studio Cross Culture and KT, Hyodol is being used by hundreds of elderly residents in Seoul.

[PARK SANG-MOON, ESTHER CHUNG]\n\nResidents of Sinwol-dong, Yangcheon District, western Seoul, meet with the district mayor at a local community center on Oct. 1 to discuss the latest technological solution for the frequent noise of airplanes flying over their neighborhood due to its proximity to Gimpo International Airport. [PARK SANG-MOON]\n\nLee, a 76-year-old resident of a small neighborhood in Yangcheon District in the western end of Seoul, spends most of his time alone in his basement apartment.There are some days when he goes an entire day without uttering a single word to anyone.But three months ago, Lee met Aria.\u201cAria,\u201d Lee called out, using the name that the SK Telecom-provided artificial intelligence (AI) device, NUGU, recognizes as its own. \u201cI feel like listening to Kim Bu-ja today.\u201d\u201cHere\u2019s one of your favorites,\u201d the machine responded, playing Kim\u2019s \u201cWhat To Do\u201d (1975).His one-room apartment was soon filled with upbeat trot music.Lee was one of 300 households, many of them one-person, selected by the Yangcheon District Office this year to be serviced by the NUGU voice recognition technology as part of the district\u2019s smart city initiatives.\u201cWe\u2019ve provided elderly residents with NUGU so that they can check simple things like the day\u2019s weather and listen to music just by speaking to the machine,\u201d said Chong Seung-ryong, an employee of SK Telecom. \u201cThe machines can also call 911 when the users call out for help. Since we began installing the machines a few months ago, at least seven users have received help by calling the authorities through the machine.\u201dYangcheon District was selected as a so-called smart city test bed by the city government of Seoul in January this year, along with Seongdong District in eastern Seoul. The two districts were granted 3.6 billion won ($3.04 million) from the city government to experiment with smart city projects over the next three years.The hype for smart city development has consumed a number of city administrations around the world. But experts have been raising concerns about their relatability to the actual consumers of such public policies.\u201cAround 53 percent of the population [in Mexico] experiences some level of poverty,\u201d said Javier Berain, chief technology officer of Mexico City\u2019s Digital Agency for Public Innovation, at a meeting of representatives of cities around the world hosted by the World Smart Sustainable Cities Organization in Seongnam, Gyeonggi, on Oct. 15. \u201cThere are people without access to running water, education and other basic needs. So why invest in something like a digital agency? Does it make sense?\u201dIn a special report to commemorate the 19th anniversary of the foundation of the paper, the Korea JoongAng Daily tried to answer this question by visiting technology test beds in Seoul and speaking to local residents about the city\u2019s AI and Internet of Things (IoT) programs.Seoul was selected as the third smartest city in the world in surveys by McKinsey Global Institute and Singapore-based Eden Strategy Institute in 2018.\u201cBut a lot of Seoul\u2019s smart city initiatives have focused on applying the technology to infrastructure,\u201d Seoul Metropolitan Government said in its statement when it announced its smart city plan in March this year.\u201cThey have not been sustainable due to lack of investments or lack of interest by local residents for whom these smart city initiatives were not very tangible.\u201dPart of Seoul\u2019s strategy has been to focus on the aging population in the city and to bring the technology to their homes.Today, 14.9 percent of the population in Korea, or some 7.38 million people, are aged 65 and over, according to Statistics Korea. The number will reach 37 percent in 2045, surpassing Japan\u2019s expected 36.7 percent that year.And more of these elderly residents live alone. The number of people aged over 65 who live alone jumped from 16 percent of the total population in 2000 to 19.4 percent as of last year, according to Statistics Korea.In Yangcheon, 23 percent of the population aged 65 and over, or 13,864 people, live alone.\u201cIn places like Yangcheon and Seongdong, areas that have high proportions of residential population, good technology can actually change people\u2019s lives,\u201d said Kim Su-young, district mayor of Yangcheon, at a meeting with residents at the district office on Oct. 1. \u201cFor instance, we have a lot of elderly residents who live alone in Yangcheon and it\u2019s not always easy to check on them every day to see how they are doing.\u201cWe started experimenting with what\u2019s called smart electronic plugs, which can be plugged into a socket in a household and will record the amount of electricity used per day,\u201d she said. \u201cThe data is transferred to a social worker, who can check on the person if suddenly there is no electricity usage for a day.\u201dThe IoT-programmed plugs have been installed in 1,000 homes in Seongdong and Yangcheon as of this year. The Seoul city government intends to expand this number to 2,000 by 2020 and 4,000 by 2022.Some local community centers throughout Seoul have partnered with corporations and telecommunication giants to provide IoT-programmed robots for single-person, elderly households.Studio Cross Culture has developed a robot named Hyodol with KT, through which an IoT interface and sensors installed in the robot allow elderly citizens who live alone to communicate with their relatives without having to learn how to use a smartphone.\u201cHyodol is a smart toy for seniors which collects the user\u2019s data for 24 hours using IoT sensors that are all around the surface of the toy,\u201d said Kim Ji-hee, CEO of Studio Cross Culture, at the Seoul Smart City Summit and Conference on Oct. 1.\u201cWith the input of information on when the senior citizen has to take medicine and eat their meals, as well as when they have to go and see a doctor for a regular checkup, Hyodol will remind the user of these appointments.\u201cChildren and grandchildren who live away from their elderly relatives can use the system\u2019s mobile application to record voice messages and send them to Hyodol, who will then play the message for the users,\u201d Kim said. \u201cAnd Hyodol will also send text messages to the user\u2019s family members if its sensors detect the user is at home but cannot detect any movement from the user for a prolonged period of time.\u201dThere are 255 Hyodols in use in Guro District, western Seoul, 50 in Seongdong, 50 at Seoul Medical Center in central Seoul and 12 in Yeongdeungpo District in western Seoul and Eunpyeong District in northern Seoul, according to Studio Cross Culture.While the company advertises its product with video footage of users expressing satisfaction and showing affection for their IoT robots, there is still some taboo in Korean society, once known for its filial duty and culture, about turning to emerging technology to take care of elderly relatives living alone.\u201cThere have been cases of some of these elderly parents receiving help because of the smart plugs,\u201d said an official of the elderly care department of the Seoul city government. \u201cBut their children would rather not let others find out about the fact that such plugs were installed at their parents\u2019 homes in the first place.\u201dWhen the reporter asked the official for an opportunity to interview a resident of a home where an IoT-programmed electricity plug was installed, the official said none would comply with the request.But experts are focusing on the positive applications of applying AI and IoT to elderly care.\u201cI think developments like Hyodol are moving in the right direction,\u201d said Ha Jung-hwa, a professor in the Department of Social Welfare at Seoul National University. \u201cOf course it would be best if children lived near their elderly parents and could check on them regularly. But there are those who cannot carry out this duty.\u201dIn response to the reporter\u2019s question about seeking alternative solutions through legislation - such as expanding the number of vacation days or designating some vacation days for family time - Ha said there are some limits to this possible solution.\u201cEven if such legislative measures were to designate additional holidays for family time, there is no mechanism to force people to spend that time with their elderly parents,\u201d Ha said. \u201cIn the meanwhile, these technological developments are helpful for those who would rather that their parents be able to stay at home with the help of AI and technology than have them move into nursing homes.\u201d\u201cAdditionally, these developments may increasingly meet the needs of the next generation when they become elderly citizens,\u201d Ha said.\u201cThe baby boomers are unlike today\u2019s elderly generation, and they may prefer to receive technology\u2019s help if it means they can be more self-reliant rather than relying on their children as they age.\u201dSinwol-dong in Yangcheon is the closest point to Gimpo International Airport in the district.The sound of an airplane flying over the area filled the air every five minutes or so when the reporter visited the district on the afternoon of Oct. 1.\u201cCome around 6 p.m. or 7 p.m., you\u2019ll hear a plane pass by every two minutes,\u201d said Lee Soo-woong, a 76-year-old resident of Sinwol-dong, who has been living there for over 30 years. \u201cIt\u2019s a miracle that we haven\u2019t lost our minds.\u201dAbout a dozen residents of Sinwol-dong gathered at a local community center that day for a meeting with Kim, the district mayor, to hear about one of the district\u2019s smart city projects that involves installing noise-canceling devices at homes.\u201cWe\u2019ve installed three of these devices in Sinwol-dong, and what it does is that it sends out waves to cancel out the sounds whenever it picks up the sound of an airplane,\u201d said Won Young-o, CEO of Liberabit, a company that uses emerging technology to produce products that are helpful for certain vulnerable groups in society, which in this case, are the residents near the airport. \u201cIt will take around three to four months for the AI program in the devices to collect information on the airplane sound waves and to respond more effectively.\u201dBut for some residents, smart technology was not what they were looking for.\u201cAre you telling me to endure all this in the meanwhile?\u201d one woman present at the meeting asked the district mayor. \u201cCan\u2019t you tell we need a solution now? Are you telling us this is the only solution you have regarding the plane nuisance?\u201d\u201cOf course there are other solutions and we are working on changes in the legislation so that more of the residents affected in this area can also receive support from the government,\u201d Kim said. \u201cBut I need you to tell me, after having used the devices for a few months, whether you think they worked so that the district office can decide whether to offer them more widely in the area. I know what you\u2019re going through, I also live in an affected region.\u201dAs Kim finished her sentence, another plane flew over, drowning her voice out.A number of residents spoke at once as the buzz of the plane rumbled away.\u201cI\u2019m telling you, this will not work,\u201d Lee said. \u201cMaybe the device would work in an indoor area, but do we stay at home all the time? We\u2019re asking for a more fundamental solution. If you cannot pay us the compensation fees, then at least pay for our move somewhere else.\u201d\u201cThe government should just buy this land here and help us move elsewhere,\u201d said another resident, who asked not to be named.Kim left the meeting after having assured the residents the district is doing all it can to convince lawmakers to adjust the law regarding compensation for those affected by the plane noise.The gap in the city administration\u2019s smart city policies and the citizens\u2019 understanding of them, like in the case of some projects in Sinwol-dong, has been an issue for city administrations around the world.\u201cPeople have been doing things a certain way for a years and they don\u2019t like to change,\u201d said Berain. \u201cIt is easy to fail when you force people to do things. The best way is to try to convince people that what we are trying to implement is best for them and also for the city.\u201d\u201cFor instance, I think some smart cities in Korea like Songdo made enormous progress, but the challenge is to take advantage of the extraordinary technology progress in a way that does not lose sight of the human factor,\u201d said Richard Smith, president of the Pinkerton Foundation, at the Seoul International Business Advisory Council on Sept. 20. \u201cIn other words, there is a need to engage citizens in creations of their own urban environment.\u201dSome projects, like the noise-canceling devices in Sinwol-dong, may simply be in need of more time.\u201cThere can be resistance to new products and new technology,\u201d Won told the Korea JoongAng Daily over the phone following the meeting at the community center in Sinwol-dong, Yangcheon. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to wait until the people have experienced whether the technology works for them or not.\u201dRegarding other smart city projects in Seoul, it may simply be that more investment is needed in the infrastructure to support the use of emerging technology.Seongdong District - the other one of the two special smart city districts of Seoul - has focused its smart city experiments on environmental conservation. It built one solar-powered electric vehicle charging station, which is one out of three in Seoul built by local governments, 11 fine dust sensors at bus stops, schools and construction sites and IoT programmed air purification systems in three day care centers.\u201cIt\u2019s all good to experiment with these projects, but what Seoul truly needs to be on the next step toward becoming smarter is an automated meter infrastructure [AMI],\u201d said Lee Kyung-taek, head of the air quality department of Seongdong District Office who is in charge of all smart city experiments in the district. \u201cAMI would enable all energy use in every building in the city to be connected and regulated, which means we can be smarter about our energy use. Research about the infrastructure has been done since the Lee Myung-bak administration but the government has not been willing to invest in it as the AMI conversion is expected to cost at least 1 trillion won.\u201dThere is a city in the United States that has applied the AMI technology to a regional water supply system.\u201cWe invested $21 million for the AMI conversion and we\u2019ll be getting our payback in about 10 years,\u201d said Vernon Adam, engineering services manager of the water department of Aurora city government in Colorado, at the conference of World Smart Sustainable Cities Organization on Oct. 15. \u201cWe have so far installed a part of the system, and we will get our feedback from the people before we go live. Total deployment will take four years, but we will take our time, because in the long term, we are empowering citizens to conserve water by engaging them in the process.\u201dIn the case of Aurora, Adam said, the benefits \u201cfar outweighed the costs\u201d due to expensive water rights in the western part of the United States.\u201cYou need city leaders who are willing to embrace this change,\u201d Adam said. \u201cBecause it takes that vision to implement these new technologies.\u201dFor some experts, developing into smarter cities is not a matter of choice.\u201cAI gives a machine the ability to reason and have human-like characteristics,\u201d said Daniela Rus, professor of computer science at MIT, at the Seoul International Business Advisory Council on Sept. 20. \u201cTogether these new technologies are enabling a future that has the same profound impact that computation has had in our lives. Autonomous driving, for instance, will give our parents and grandparents a much better time after retirement. It\u2019s not a matter of if but a matter of when.\u201dShe emphasized, however, that at the center of these developments will always be humans, not machines.\u201cAI is a set of tools created by the people,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not inherently good or bad, it\u2019s what we choose to do with them.\u201dBY ESTHER CHUNG [chung.juhee@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://pds.joins.com/jmnet/koreajoongangdaily/_data/photo/2019/10/28195415.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
