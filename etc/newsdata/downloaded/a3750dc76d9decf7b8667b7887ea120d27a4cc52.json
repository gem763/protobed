Marshall has 170 stores in North America, 59 of them in airports.\n\nWHSmith will pay for Marshall by raising \u00a3155million from shareholders in an underwritten share placing and by taking on more debt.\n\nIncoming chief executive Carl Cowling, who starts in November, said: 'We've known the business for about four years. We've been watching the market for years trying to think of the best ways to break in.'\n\nThe deal comes a year after WHSmith bought travel accessories business InMotion for \u00a3155million.\n\nWHSmith said it expects the deal to result in 'mid-single digit EPS accretion in the first full financial year following Completion, and to approach double digits EPS accretion in the second full financial year following Completion.' The group expects the deal to be completed early next year.\n\nShares in WHSmith are up 6.32 per cent or 132p to 2,220p, marking the highest they have been since around January 2018.\n\nIn its preliminary annual results, WHSmith said it had upped its dividend by 8 per cent to 58.2p a share.\n\nNews of the deal with Marshall emerged as the retailer revealed total sales jumped 11 per cent across the business to \u00a31.4billion.\n\nIts travel division grew by 22 per cent to \u00a3817million, primarily due to the purchase of InMotion, or up 3 per cent on a like-for-like basis. Trading profits in the division jumped \u00a3117million.\n\nPre-tax profits for the year to 31 August increased by 1 per cent to \u00a3135million.\n\nTravel is the biggest driver for WHSmith and now accounts for two thirds of profits for the business.\n\nHospital stores performed particularly well, with sales up 12 per cent over the year, but the group has faced criticism in the past for high prices on those sites and poor choices of healthy food.\n\nAirport revenue jumped 5 per cent, while revenue in railway stores grew by 1 per cent.\n\nPlans: WH Smith is ploughing ahead with plans to expand further into the US\n\nDonald Brown, senior investment manager at Brewin Dolphin, said: 'WHSmith continues to be a tale of two businesses.\n\n'Despite the challenging retail backdrop, the group is delivering strong growth at its travel division, where its 1,019 units delivered a 22 per cent rise in sales.\n\n'This compared to flat sales on the high street, only supported by healthy stationery sales.\n\n'The planned acquisition of the US-based Marshall Retail Group will add 170 new locations, including 59 at airports. This could be a significant move for WHSmith and a declared 8 per cent increase in the final dividend should be viewed as a positive that the balance sheet can cover the extra debt.'\n\nMeanwhile, Ed Monk, an associate director from Fidelity Personal Investing, said: 'WHSmith might seem an unlikely success story. As countless other famous UK retail chains have failed and folded, WH Smith has reorganised and cut out a new niche for itself.\n\n'With little fuss, it has spent the past decade reinventing itself as primarily, a travel station retailer - selling bottles of water to train commuters and paperbacks to flyers in departure lounges - while its traditional high street stationary and newsagent stores have declined.\n\n'The question for investors now is whether the benefits of that evolution have now played out.\n\n'After years of stellar returns the share price has moved sideways in the past 12 months and valuations are on the high side, approaching 20 times price-to-earnings. The deal to buy specialist US airport electrical chain InMotion represented a move into a new market, and the results today show the deal is bearing fruit.'", "description": "While WH Smith looks set to continue losing money across its high street branches in the UK, the deal with Marshall will enable it\u00a0 to continue expanding at travel hubs in the US.", "authors": ["Jane Denton For Thisismoney", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
