This is needed and wanted by the people,\" he said.\n\nThe president also reminded ministers not to disagree in public, saying they were free to debate things within government meetings.\n\nDespite Widodo's efforts since coming to power in 2014 to make it easier to start a business, investors still found it difficult to enter some sectors, he said in May.\n\nOn Wednesday, after swearing in the ministers, he ordered them to revise 74 laws by applying \"omnibus laws\", or legislation that encompasses diverse and unrelated issues.\n\nForeign direct investment into Indonesia has been sluggish in recent years because of factors such as regulatory uncertainty and weak commodity prices. Widodo has complained the country has not attracted as much investment from manufacturers trying to move out of China compared with other Southeast Asian countries.\n\nWidodo kept several economic ministers from his first term in the new team, including Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati and longtime ally Luhut Pandjaitan, who oversees maritime affairs, natural resources and investment.\n\nOther appointments include the co-founder of startup Gojek, Nadiem Makarim, as education minister and politician Airlangga Hartarto as chief economic affairs minister.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Gayatri Suroyo.
