It provides another deep dive into the hidden world of the Vatican City, marvelling at its mystique with agnostic fervour. The Venice film festival screened two episodes of the forthcoming nine-part series, each preceded by an abridged summary of what went before. But even in this bowdlerised form, it looks splendid, like Michelangelo\u2019s Piet\u00e0, which is scarred by a terrorist bomb at the top of episode seven.\n\nThe New Pope (a co-production by Sky Atlantic, HBO and Canal+) picks up where The Young Pope left off, with Pius XIII (Jude Law) in a coma and the Holy See scurrying to come up with a replacement. The most viable candidate is Sir John Brannox (beautifully embodied by John Malkovich), an intellectual English aristo renowned for a theological text, The Middle Way, that he wrote in his youth. On arriving at his stately pile, with its shades of Brideshead Revisited, the Catholic delegates are drawn into a realm that is almost as arcane and thick with secrets as the one they\u2019ve left behind in Rome. Brannox lounges at its centre, apparently all-knowing and all-seeing. \u201cHe\u2019s persuasive, seductive. He envelops you,\u201d remarks the Holy See\u2019s marketing chief Sofia (C\u00e9cile de France). \u201cThe man seems to be made of velvet.\u201d\n\nAs with the man, so with the series. Sorrentino possesses style to burn and elegance to squander. The New Pope loops and darts from one gorgeous set piece to the next, whether it\u2019s a religious tableau set to haunting dance music or a nocturnal stroll through a wintry Venice. The whole thing is so immaculate that it risks holding the viewer at arm\u2019s length. But then the director will gently lance us with a moment of emotional truth, drawing our attention to the pensive old cardinal who was abused as a boy, or the emaciated child in the bed of a supposedly cursed house. Sorrentino\u2019s grand mansion contains many doors. Crucially, we are made to feel that behind each is a story that would merit its own standalone drama.\n\nPope Pius XIII maybe mouldering in the hospital but his presence walks the corridors of this show. Law appears in ghostly form, laying a consoling hand on a shoulder or parading in Speedos on the beach at the Lido. (Sorrentino has always relished juggling the profound with the profane.) It\u2019s good to have him back, but on the evidence of two episodes, I\u2019m more taken with the new arrival. Malkovich plays delicate Brannox with a purring, campy charisma; resplendent in a purple suit, a smudge of mascara beneath watchful eyes. When he\u2019s not reclining on the chaises longues, Brannox likes sitting upright on a stool, caressing his harp. Plop him on a toadstool and pass the man a hookah. He\u2019d be a dead ringer for the caterpillar out of Alice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland.\n\n\u2022The New Pope screened at the Venice film festival; it will be broadcast on HBO in the US and Sky Atlantic in the UK", "description": "Jude Law haunts Paolo Sorrentino\u2019s glorious follow-up to The Young Pope, but Malkovich\u2019s purring pontiff-in-waiting is divine", "authors": ["Xan Brooks"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7abc88b87c5f851549c06d0bbb4afecac592bc3/0_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTQucG5n&enable=upscale&s=057c343dd5c324c3581f97d4c6824d0a"}
