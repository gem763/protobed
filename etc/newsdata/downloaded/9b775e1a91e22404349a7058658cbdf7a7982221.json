I did shows. I did singing on All Together Now and League Of Their Own, and Una was always very supportive of me doing that.\n\n\"She\u2019d always coach me a little bit. But she doesn\u2019t have very much patience with me because I\u2019m not the best singer. And, she\u2019d be like: \u201cdo this\u201d and I\u2019m like \u201cI don\u2019t know what that is,\u201d and she\u2019d be like: \u201ceveryone knows what that is in the singing industry!\u201d\n\n\"So, it\u2019s been great for us to go and actually work with real vocal coaches and learn how to harmonize and learn all the serious sides about being in a band together.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\"So I did get the tiniest fraction of a little bit of head start. But we all have individual starts: Levi comes from a musical school, Tom was in a boyband back in 1964.\"\n\nHe wants Una to forgive him for how their marriage ended.\n\nThe sportsman told The Sun: \"I hope Una will forgive me. I made the biggest mistake and the most \u00adstupid mistake you can make in a relationship.\"\n\n(Image: ben_foden/Instagram)\n\nHe added: \"We seemed like a perfect match but people never know what happens behind closed doors. I think it\u2019s safe to say that Una and I were struggling for a number of years.\n\n\"Me doing what I did was the final nail in the coffin.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Una has moved on with Irish sportsman David Breen. She found love after bumping into her man in a coffee shop.", "description": "After a tweet from him was unearthed saying the show was on it's last legs, the former rugby star has spoken out again", "authors": ["Sam Elliott", "Charlotte Tutton", "Image", "Wireimage", "Getty Images Europe", "Pa", "Ben_Foden Instagram"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article14206220.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Una-Healy-and-Ben-Foden.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
