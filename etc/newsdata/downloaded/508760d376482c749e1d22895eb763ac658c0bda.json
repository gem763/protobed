With the highest rate of suicide in years, experts say it's long overdue.

So it\u2019s perhaps no surprise that their latest endeavor, to enact mental health days in schools nationwide, is taking off.\n\nThis week Florida became the newest state to address this issue with House Bill 315, legislation that would allow (but not require) Florida schools to offer students \u201cone mental health day for each semester as an excused absence.\u201d Florida State Representative Susan Valdes (D-Tampa), the lead sponsor on the bill, told the Tallahassee Democrat that her bill is aimed at combating stigma and alleviating the stress that students face today. \u201cIn the age of social media, the Internet, and constant bombardment of negative news and events, our children are bearing the brunt of a quickly-changing society,\u201d Valdes told the local paper. \u201cIt is time for us to take mental health as a whole more seriously.\u201d\n\nFlorida\u2019s measure \u2014 if passed \u2014 would take effect next year, but is just one of several that have been introduced nationwide. In 2018, Utah was the first state to enact legislation on the topic, by expanding the definition of \u201csick\u201d to include mental health issues. Then, in July, teen activists in Oregon worked to pass a bill that allows students to take as many as five mental health days over a three-month period in the state. Other states, like Virginia, have passed limited measures in certain school districts, while others, like New York, are working on proposals.\n\nThe laws, which have largely been applauded on social media, come on the heels of a June report from the Journal of the American Medical Association that found suicide levels among young adults to be at the highest levels since 2000. An October report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention presented even more troubling statistics, noting a 56 percent increase in suicides among people aged 10 to 17 between 2007 and 2017. Now the second leading cause of death in that age group, suicide has often been linked to anxiety and depression \u2014 two conditions that teens also face in high numbers. In a February poll from the Pew Research Center, 70 percent of teens said they view anxiety and depression as a major problem among people their age (the highest percentage of any issue they face).\n\nJennifer Rothman, senior manager of youth and young adult initiatives at the National Alliance on Mental Illness, says it\u2019s this awareness among teens that is fueling the change nationwide. \u201cWe're really seeing young people stand up and advocate for this,\u201d Rothman tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cWhen the people being affected are the ones standing up, lawmakers and school personnel notice. This is an ongoing issue and it's not getting better, it's getting worse.\u201d\n\nRothman, who coordinates a presentation on mental health for schools, titled \u201cEnding the Silence,\u201d says the ability to take a sick day when suffering from anxiety or depression isn\u2019t just helpful \u2014 it\u2019s healing. \u201cIt allows [students] to speak up and say \u2018I need a mental health day, I'm not feeling well.\u2019 It starts the conversation,\u201d she says. \u201cIf a family wasn't aware their child had issues with their mental health, this can really spark some conversations about maybe finding treatment and getting help.\u201d NAMI has also created a new online resource for parents, a free, six-session education guide.\n\nBut beyond opening up dialogue with loved ones, Rothman thinks the laws are a powerful sign of progress in the education world. \u201cSchools are showing that they're supporting their students, they recognize this is an issue and they want to address it,\u201d she tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cAll of this works together against the stigma because people are so ashamed, but in reality, there is nothing to be ashamed of. We all need mental health days.\u201d\n\nIf you or someone you know needs help, please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255).\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "A new bill in Florida would allow students to call in sick for mental health reasons.
