On Sunday they briefly occupied the main train station in Barcelona before cutting traffic on a main avenue of the city.\n\nAnti-riot police have been discreetly deployed to Catalonia, but the interior ministry has refused to give numbers.\n\nFor many, the situation has brought back memories of tensions in the street in the run-up to the October 1 referendum which was marred by police violence, and ahead of the short-lived independence declaration of October 27.\n\nIn recent weeks, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has made it clear that his government will not tolerate any violence, warning he will not hesitate to renew a suspension of Catalan autonomy as happened two years ago.\n\nThe situation is worrying the main Catalan business lobby which said although the verdict would have a \u201csignificant emotional impact\u201d, it was important the response avoided disrupting \u201cbusiness activity or social cohesion\u201d.\n\n\u2013 Sedition not rebellion \u2013\n\nThe court is widely reported in the media to have chosen to sentence them for sedition and not rebellion, which carries a far heavier sentence.\n\nBut after those leaks, the president of the court, Manuel Marchena, warned on Saturday that no decision is final until it has been signed by all seven judges. The signature is expected on Monday or Tuesday at the latest.\n\nBy definition, rebellion is \u201crising up in a violent and public manner\u201d to, among other things, \u201cdeclare independence for part of the (Spanish) territory\u201d.\n\nSedition, however, is \u201crising up publicly and in turbulent fashion\u201d to \u201cprevent by force or in an illegal way\u201d the law from being applied, or the application of an administrative or legal decision.\n\nThe trial comes just weeks before Spain heads to the polls for its fourth election in as many years, putting the Catalan question once more at the centre of the political debate.\n\nAlthough Sanchez\u2019s government is hoping the trial\u2019s end might give fresh impetus to dialogue, Junqueras\u2019 leftwing ERC party has said it would not be possible without an \u201camnesty\u201d for \u201cpolitical prisoners and those in exile\u201d.", "description": "Madrid (AFP) \u2013 Spain\u2019s Supreme Court is expected to issue a verdict Monday in the controversial case of 12 Catalan leaders over their role in", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/13/66e4f3_situation-has-brought-memories-run-up-referendum-2017-top-spain-court-rule-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
