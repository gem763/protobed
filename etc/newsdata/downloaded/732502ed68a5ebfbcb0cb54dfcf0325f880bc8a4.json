Saturn is now the solar system's moon king.\n\nAstronomers Monday announced the discovery of 20 new moons in orbit around Saturn, giving the planet a total of 82. That tops Jupiter and its 79 moons.\n\nThe finding was announced Monday by the International Astronomical Union\u2019s Minor Planet Center.\n\nThe Carnegie Institution for Science\u2019s Scott Sheppard, who led the discovery team, said 100 even tinier moons may be orbiting Saturn, still waiting to be found.\n\n\u201cUsing some of the largest telescopes in the world, we are now completing the inventory of small moons around the giant planets,\u201d said Sheppard. \u201cThey play a crucial role in helping us determine how our solar system\u2019s planets formed and evolved.\u201d\n\nEach of the newly discovered moons is about three miles in diameter. Seventeen of them orbit the planet backwards, or in a retrograde direction, meaning their movement is opposite of the planet\u2019s rotation around its axis.\n\nAn artist\u2019s conception of the 20 newly discovered moons and their orbits around Saturn. These discoveries bring the planet\u2019s total moon count to 82, surpassing Jupiter for the most in our solar system.

The contest opens Monday and closes in December.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/10/07/saturn-moons-20-new-moons-planet-now-has-more-moons-than-jupiter/3902220002/", "description": "Astronomers Monday announced the discovery of 20\u00a0new moons in orbit\u00a0around Saturn, giving the planet a total of 82.
