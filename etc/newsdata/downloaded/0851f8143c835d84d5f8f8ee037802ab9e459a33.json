REUTERS/George Frey/File Photo\n\nThe plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers moved swiftly to fight the request companies including AmerisourceBergen Corp (ABC.N), Cardinal Health Inc (CAH.N) and McKesson Corp (MCK.N) had made on Saturday for U.S. District Judge Dan Polster in Cleveland, Ohio, to step aside from the litigation.\n\nIn Monday\u2019s brief, lawyers for the plaintiffs said the defendants had waived their ability to seek Polster\u2019s recusal, noting they were relying on statements he made more than a year ago to belatedly seek his disqualification.\n\n\u201cIf these Defendants really thought recusal was necessary, they were required to raise the issue sooner - much sooner,\u201d the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers wrote.\n\nMore than 2,500 lawsuits by state and local governments are pending nationally, accusing drug manufacturers of deceptively marketing opioids in ways that downplayed their risks, and drug distributors of failing to detect and halt suspicious orders.\n\nThe companies deny wrongdoing. Nearly 2,100 of the lawsuits are before Polster, while others are in state courts.\n\nThe companies had argued in Saturday\u2019s motion that Polster, who has long pushed for a settlement that could \u201cdo something meaningful to abate this crisis,\u201d had made a series of public statements since 2018 that could cause a reasonable person to question his impartiality.\n\nThey said those statements, made in court hearings and media interviews, raised the prospect that he had improperly prejudged their liability ahead of the first trial on Oct. 21 involving two Ohio counties seeking $8 billion.\n\nIn Monday\u2019s brief, the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers said the companies did not take action when Polster made those comments and actively participated in court-overseen settlement talks without objection.\n\nPolster \u201chas at no time expressed improper or biased views about the liability of any defendant, much less views based on extra-judicial sources,\u201d the lawyers wrote.\n\nThe companies who joined Saturday\u2019s motion also include CVS Health Corp (CVS.N) and Walmart Inc (WMT.N). The defendants did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nOpioids were involved in 400,000 overdose deaths from 1999 to 2017, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nOxyContin maker Purdue Pharma, one of the lead defendants, filed for bankruptcy protection on Monday after reaching a tentative deal to resolve claims in the federal litigation and by 24 U.S. states.", "description": "Lawyers for cities and counties suing drug companies over the opioid epidemic on Monday objected to a bid by pharmaceutical distributors and pharmacies to disqualify the federal judge overseeing the cases, saying it had no basis and came too late.", "authors": ["Nate Raymond", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190916&t=2&i=1430565960&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8F1HU", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
