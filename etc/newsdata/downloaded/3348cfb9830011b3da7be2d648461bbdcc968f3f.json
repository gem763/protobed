BHGE -7.55%\n\nA slowdown in the prolific Permian Basin, the center of the shale boom, as well as weakness in crude prices have punished its shares along with those of industry heavyweights Halliburton HAL 0.10% and Schlumberger . SLB -0.37% Things may be looking up for investors in the sector, though.\n\nShareholders can\u2019t be blamed for feeling blue. Last month the International Energy Agency cited a \u201cfragile\u201d outlook for demand partly because of the U.S.-China trade dispute. The agency said global oil demand was up only 520,000 barrels a day in January to May, the lowest increase for the period since 2008. West Texas Intermediate prices are around one-quarter lower than they were at the beginning of the year.\n\nThe U.S. Energy Information Administration predicted earlier this week that U.S. crude-oil production will average 12.2 million barrels a day in 2019 and 13.2 million in 2020, both records. But booming production doesn\u2019t necessarily equal impressive spending, or even profits. Shale producers are feeling financial strain. They were meant to be the driving growth engine in the market as the short drilling cycle makes them more nimble. More than two dozen U.S. oil-and-gas producers have filed for bankruptcy so far this year, though\u2014almost as many as in the whole of last year. Others are being more cautious about spending as shareholders focus on heretofore elusive free cash flow from the shale patch.\n\nService companies have responded by tightening their own belts. Evercore ISI projects that capital expenditures at Halliburton will be 6.9% and 6.2% of 2019 and 2020 sales, respectively, versus 6.7% and 8.4% in 2017 and 2018. Schlumberger\u2019s similar metric is now 5% versus at least 10% historically.\n\nThe three biggest servicing companies have different exposure to the U.S. market. The majority of Halliburton\u2019s business is helping fields in North America, whereas Schlumberger and Baker Hughes are only about one-third exposed. The North American figures include some conventional fields.\n\nBut there is a bright spot to the conservatism creeping into the shale patch: As shale producers focus on discipline rather than growth, the servicing businesses are steadier, too. Their earnings might look more like an industrial concern rather than a boom-and-bust commodity business\u2014a welcome development for their valuations. In the past, the financial swings in oil field services have been wilder and more punishing than for drillers themselves.\n\nOffshore oil drilling, meanwhile, is coming back to life, too, with rig counts and utilization rates increasing from recent lows. Companies are seizing the moment to look abroad. Baker Hughes Chief Executive Lorenzo Simonelli recently said at a conference that international offshore was a key focus area. The company grew offshore orders 9% and revenues 6% in the first half of this year versus the same period last year, with international being the strongest. Halliburton recently sold out of equipment in the North Sea. Schlumberger\u2019s international revenue increased 8% in the first half of the year compared with the same period last year while North America land revenue has declined 12%.\n\nHalliburton\u2019s shares have fallen almost 50% over the past year; Schlumberger\u2019s are off almost 40% while Baker Hughes\u2019s are down by about one-third. The broader PHLX Oil Service Index is down by about half this year. Halliburton\u2019s price/earnings ratio has been nearly halved since late January, according to FactSet. Schlumberger\u2019s similar figure is down by almost one-third.\n\nIf the business is becoming less boom and bust, though, then investors have fallen victim to a slippery slope.\n\nWrite to Lauren Silva Laughlin at lauren.silvalaughlin@wsj.com", "description": "Shale drillers may be suffering, but investors have punished the stocks that service them too much.", "authors": ["Lauren Silva Laughlin", "Lauren.Silvalaughlin Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-106430/social", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
