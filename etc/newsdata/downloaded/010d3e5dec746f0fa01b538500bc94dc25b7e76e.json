Milwaukee dropped two games in back of Washington for the top NL wild-card spot with two games left.\n\nMore concerning was the status of Braun.\n\nBraun hit an RBI single in the first inning and played left field in the bottom half. He was pulled in the second.\n\n\u201cI felt it running to first base in my first at-bat and it didn\u2019t loosen up at all when I was on defense in the bottom of the first. I\u2019ll have to get an MRI to see the severity and see where we\u2019re at,\u201d Braun said. \u201cIt\u2019s encouraging, it feels better now than it did then. If it felt worse now that would have been a bad sign and more concerning.\u201d\n\nThe Brewers are already without 2018 NL MVP Christian Yelich, who is done for the season with a fractured kneecap, and infielder Mike Moustakas is nursing a sore left elbow. Despite the injuries, Milwaukee had won 18 of 20 coming into the final series of the season.\n\nNow Braun\u2019s availability is in doubt for the next two games, and possibly longer.\n\n\u201cThe timing of it isn\u2019t ideal. We have a lot of things going on,\u201d Braun said. \u201cWe\u2019re already dealing with Moose being out the last couple of days, we want to be as close to full strength and full health as we approach the end of the season.\u201d\n\nLorenzo Cain homered, Keston Hiura had four hits and Brewers starter Zach Davies had a single before being lifted for a pinch-hitter in the sixth. He allowed just one run on two hits before departing with a 2-1 lead.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad I finished strong in the month of September,\u201d Davies said. \u201cTough loss today but, one, we\u2019re still in the postseason and, two, there\u2019s still two more games to be played.\u201d\n\nPinch-hitter Raimel Tapia connected for a grand slam to cap Colorado\u2019s seven-run sixth inning that made it 8-2.\n\nThe Brewers allowed a total of 13 runs during their winning streak, but a bullpen that was 12-0 over the last 20 games imploded against Colorado.\n\nThe Rockies sent 12 batters to the plate in the sixth and needed just four hits to score seven times. Ray Black (0-1) gave up a leadoff homer to Charlie Blackmon, his 32nd, and left without recording an out after three batters.\n\nDaniel Murphy put Colorado ahead with an RBI single, Tony Wolters drove in another with a bases-loaded walk and Tapia followed with the second pinch-hit grand slam of his career, tagging Jay Jackson.\n\nThe Brewers issued seven walks in the game, five in the sixth inning.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s too many in one inning. That\u2019s probably too many in one game,\u201d manager Craig Counsell said.\n\nRyan McMahon hit a two-run homer in Colorado\u2019s three-run seventh inning. Milwaukee scored two in the eighth and three in the ninth.\n\nAntonio Senzatela (11-11) pitched six solid innings, allowing two runs on seven hits and fanning seven. He left trailing 2-1 before his team rallied.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t have his best fastball but he competes as hard as anyone,\u201d manager Bud Black said. \u201cHe\u2019s a tough kid and he can roll his way through a game.\u201d\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nBrewers: Counsell said Moustakas has been bothered with soreness in his left elbow recently and he wants to give him a couple of days off this weekend to get ready for the postseason. Counsell said batting doesn\u2019t bother the elbow, and he pinch-hit in the ninth on Friday night.\n\n\u201cThe hope here is two days here,\u201d Counsell said. \u201cThe goal is trying to put this behind him so we\u2019re not worried about this in October.\u201d\n\nRockies: RHP Carlos Estevez is dealing with a sore back and the flu and will likely not pitch again this season, Black said.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nBrewers LHP Gio Gonzalez (3-2, 3.70 ERA) will make his seventh career start against Colorado when he takes the mound against Rockies RHP Chi Chi Gonz\u00e1lez (2-6, 5.68).\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The September surge for the Milwaukee Brewers took a hit Friday night, and the rare loss could be more costly than one game.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Michael Kelly"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/27/brewers_rockies_baseball_42079_c0-265-4405-2833_s1770x1032.jpg?d337a5e54fccc12225fd9fc4143b94fe98e2c29a", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
