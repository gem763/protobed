(AP) - Rookie center Jack Hughes need not be too disappointed over the dud he and the New Jersey Devils produced in the No. 1 draft pick\u2019s debut in an NHL competitive setting Friday night.\n\nOverlooking the 6-4 loss to Buffalo at the Sabres\u2019 prospects tournament, Devils minor-league coach Mark Dennehy was more impressed by how Hughes\u2018 focus never wavered when the game was essentially out of reach.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s 6-3 and we\u2019re on the power play, and he asked me a question that tells me not only is he locked in, but that he\u2019s a student of the game,\u201d said Dennehy, declining to share the specific question Hughes asked.\n\n\u201cIt was a situational thing, and as a coach, for a player at his young age to sort of change gears was pretty impressive to me,\u201d said the AHL Binghamton coach, who was behind the bench.\n\n\u201cAs skilled as he is, he\u2019s a competitor, too,\u201d Dennehy said. \u201cI know he\u2019s not happy with the result. But I think he showed everybody especially the Devils\u2018 fans that he\u2019s got a bright future.\u201d\n\nThe 18-year-old Hughes wasn\u2019t in much of a talkative mood following a game the Devils trailed 6-0 before scoring four times over the final 23 minutes.\n\n\u201cWe could\u2019ve played better,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cI felt OK in my game. First game of the year, so just a building block.\u201d\n\nThough he scored a goal, Hughes was more disappointed in the several chances he missed. Turnovers were an issue, too, for Hughes, who coughed up the puck several times in the opening period.\n\n\u201cIt was more just getting my feet wet again,\u201d said Hughes, whose last game was representing the United States at the World Championships in May. \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s only a start.\u201d\n\nHis night got off to a bad start when Hughes fell while losing a faceoff in the Devils end, which led to the Buffalo\u2019s Kyle Olson opening the scoring 30 seconds in. On Hughes\u2018 next shift, he coughed up the puck at his own blue line.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until midway through the opening period, when Hughes began showing off the play-making skills which led him to set the two-year USA Hockey National Developmental Program scoring record with 228 points (74 goals, 154 assists) in 110 career games.\n\nDriving into the right corner of the Sabres end, he eluded a defender and made a no-look pass to the left point to set up a scoring chance.\n\nHughes\u2018 highlight came with 3:43 left in the second period. After getting knocked down by Buffalo\u2019s Casey Fitzgerald in the Sabres end, Hughes got up, raced to coral a loose puck and scored the Devils\u2018 first goal.\n\n\u201cIt was more beat the goalie to the spot, grab the puck, spin around and shoot,\u201d Hughes said, describing the goal. \u201cYeah, it was nice. Good to get on the board. But, I mean, I had five or six other chances and should\u2019ve scored at least one or two more.\u201d\n\nHughes and the Devils\u2018 prospects will get two more games in Buffalo to knock the rust off before the team opens training camp next week. And that\u2019s when most eyes will be on Hughes, the 5-foot-10 play-making center from Orlando, Florida, who was the eighth American to be selected with the No. 1 pick.\n\nHughes was part of a Devils lineup that featured two other first-round picks: center Michael McLeod (selected 12th overall in 2016) and defenseman Ty Smith (17th in 2018). And then there\u2019s newly signed forward Jesper Boqvist, a 2017 second-round selection, whose 35 points tied him for second among players 21 and younger in the Swedish Hockey League last season.\n\nThe Devils are counting on Hughes to immediately contribute to a roster that\u2019s been restocked after New Jersey finished last in the Metropolitan Division. A day after drafting Hughes, New Jersey turned heads by acquiring defenseman P.K. Subban in a trade with Nashville, and also signed power forward Wayne Simmonds in free agency.\n\nThough they\u2019ve yet to meet in person, Subban is already looking forward to assisting in Hughes\u2018 development.\n\n\u201cI think the focus needs to be on his development as a player. He\u2019s got a lot of time, and there\u2019s going to be a learning curve,\u201d Subban told The Associated Press. \u201cBut he\u2019s a tremendous talent, and you\u2019re going to see when the puck drops. I\u2019m just excited to be able to try to help someone like that in any way I can.\u201d\n\nDevils head coach John Hynes watched from the stands and liked what he saw in Hughes\u2018 first game.\n\n\u201cI liked his speed. I liked his competitiveness. I think all in all for him, it\u2019s a pretty good first game,\u201d Hynes said.\n\n___\n\nAP Hockey Writer Stephen Whyno contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Rookie center Jack Hughes need not be too disappointed over the dud he and the New Jersey Devils produced in the No. 1 draft pick's debut in an NHL competitive setting Friday night.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "John Wawrow"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/06/devils_hughes_hockey_65909_c0-167-3980-2487_s1770x1032.jpg?6cd99da0b311b1a0b61d19570abc3f6248750a29", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
