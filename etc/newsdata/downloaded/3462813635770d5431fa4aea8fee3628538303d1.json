Watch What Happens When The NRA Confronts Eric 'Nuke 'Em' Swalwell", "language": "en", "text": "On Tuesday, the National Rifle Association decided to confront Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA) following the House Judiciary Committee's mark up on various gun control legislation, including implementing red flag laws on a federal level and banning so-called \"high capacity\" magazines. Swalwell is a member of the Judiciary Committee and has made it his personal mission to make sure law-abiding gun owners are disarmed. in the past, he even went so far as to say he would nuke gun owners who refused to hand over their firearms.\n\nThe NRA asked Swalwell multiple questions. Naturally, he couldn't answer them.\n\nHe had no comment about the San Francisco Board of Supervisors calling NRA members \"terrorists.\" Because, seriously, how do you defend something so stupid and ludicrous?\n\nHe's perviously called for an assault weapons ban but he can't define what an \"assault weapon\" really is. But, for anti-gunners, it typically means a firearm that's big, black and scary. If it has a scope or looks tactical in nature, it's even more \"assaulty.\"\n\nAnd when asked if he still wanted to nuke gun owners, all Swalwell could do was smirk.\n\nThe truth of the matter is, gun owners are getting the last laugh, Swalwell. We're here. We're strong. We're ready and willing to fight. And we won't let others forget about your personal vendetta against us. And it's because of us that you were polling at 0 percent and had to drop out of the 2020 presidential race.\n\nWe have two words for you Swalwell: MOLON LABE.", "description": "Hilarious..09/11/2019 9:50:01AM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann", "Leah Barkoukis", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/60/94a3cd3e-eeea-4657-94c2-97e02f23676f.png", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
