So it was definitely hard to just shut those words out because most of the words that they did use were very hurtful.\u201d\n\nAlanna Romero Pashe, 13, was bullied when she was going to elementary school in Manitoba. She now lives in Toronto. (CBC)\n\nAlanna is not alone.\n\nCBC found that 47 per cent of kids in kindergarten to Grade 8 have been called hateful names or we subjected to hateful comments.\n\nThe findings are from an online survey of more than 4,000 young Canadians aged 14 to 21.\n\nAlanna would cry a lot and her grades started to slip until she moved from Manitoba to Ontario and went to a new school in Grade 6.\n\nDavid Fan, 17, who is from Toronto, was also picked on.\n\nHe was even beaten up and punched at recess.\n\n\u201cI remember at nighttime, I just couldn\u2019t sleep,\u201d he said. \u201cI was just crying.

(CBC)\n\nThe survey also found that 35 per cent of kids are physically assaulted while in elementary or middle school.\n\nDavid felt he couldn\u2019t speak to his parents about it because he was ashamed, so he reached out to the Kids Help Phone.\n\n\u201cOne of the best things about it is the counsellors were anonymous and they didn\u2019t know me so I didn\u2019t feel like I was being judged,\u201d he said.\n\nEventually David did talk to his parents.\n\nThey spoke to the school principal and the school board, and the bullying stopped.\n\nThat\u2019s the advice 16-year-old Erin Kendal has for kids who are bullied.\n\n\u201cFirstly, who do you feel comfortable talking to? Is it a teacher, a parent, a principal?\u201d she said.\n\nErin Kendal, 16, was bullied throughout elementary school.
