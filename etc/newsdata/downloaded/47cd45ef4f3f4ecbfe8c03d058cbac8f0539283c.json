We were in the warehouse of a newspaper in rural New Hampshire in February, and, in front of several dozen white folks, he delivered his now-familiar refrain: \u201cThe opposite of Donald Trump is an Asian man who likes math!\"\n\nAs a wave of laughter rolled through the room, lingering a few beats longer than the joke probably deserved, I watched the faces in the crowd exude relief, even gratitude, over the permission they\u2019d just been granted to treat the good-at-math-Asian-guy stereotype as benign, even funny. For the crowd, the joke was cathartic, releasing a tension most would not have quite known they were feeling before he dispelled it. By leaning into the stereotype, Yang effectively said: Remind me \u2014 why should I be on the defensive about this?\n\nOutlook \u2022 Perspective Wesley Yang is a columnist for Tablet and the author of \u201cThe Souls of Yellow Folk.\u201d is a columnist for Tablet and the author of \u201cThe Souls of Yellow Folk.\u201d Follow @wesyang\n\nThe line is now shouted in unison by the boisterous crowds he draws to his rallies. Members of the #YangGang, as his admirers are known, are among the most energized factions supporting any presidential candidate on social media: They wear blue hats and shirts emblazoned with \u201cMATH\u201d \u2014 an acronym for the slogan Make America Think Harder. They chant \u201cPowerPoint,\u201d and they pumped $10 million into Yang\u2019s coffers in the third quarter of this year, putting a once-unknown candidate who\u2019s never held elective office ahead of multiple governors and members of Congress in fundraising, and he\u2019s tied for sixth place with 3 percent support among those planning to vote in the 2020 primaries and caucuses, according to the most recent Economist-YouGov poll.\n\nThe symbolism of his messaging \u2014 at once joyous, ironic, weirdly earnest, self-deprecating and proud \u2014 should be instantly clear to anyone who has labored in a white-collar workplace. Yang is casting himself as a proverbial spreadsheet jockey who is going off script and demanding to be put in charge immediately, because the alphas and apple-polishers who call the shots are failing.\n\nIt\u2019s fitting that such an unexpected political movement would have an Asian American man as its underdog figurehead. Yang is a stand-in \u2014 and hero \u2014 for all the people who have acquired a deep understanding of how things actually work while toiling away in the obscurity where others are content to keep them confined, running the technical infrastructure. That\u2019s the role in which we are most habituated to seeing Americans of Asian descent: hyper-competent but deferential, best suited for those essential but essentially subordinate roles \u2014 and no other.\n\nWhat were all those spreadsheet jockeys, data modelers, computer programmers, lawyers, consultants and investment bankers doing in the 1990s and 2000s? They were optimizing American capitalism. They were pricing out credit default swaps and bundling mortgage-backed securities. They were building the legal and technical pathways of overseas supply chains. They were constructing industrial robots in factories in the Midwest. \u201cThe reason why Donald Trump\u2019s our president today is that we automated away 4 million manufacturing jobs in Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin,\u201d Yang says. And what are they doing today? They are building next-generation technologies to do the same thing to call-center workers, truck drivers, retail employees and fast-food workers \u2014 to millions of middle-aged, middle-income Americans, particularly those with no more than high school educations. Yang calls it \u201cthe fourth industrial revolution,\u201d the \u201cgreatest technological shift in human history\u201d and the most pressing issue that almost no one has been talking about.\n\nYang is a kind of defector from the knowledge-worker class he once epitomized as an Ivy League-educated corporate lawyer and chief executive of a test-prep company. The seven years he spent building a nonprofit called Venture for America, matching graduates of top colleges with start-ups in Rust Belt cities, made him acutely conscious of both the injury that his cohort has done (and is working tirelessly to expand) in the service of corporate America, and the volatile reaction this injury has stirred up. His campaign is an attempt to fashion a technocratic response to populist demands \u2014 by simply giving people money. The overt emphasis on being an Asian American math nerd frames his signature policy, a universal basic income (UBI) of $1,000 per month for every American adult, as a responsible, sober-minded and data-driven measure to \u201crebalance the economy,\u201d rather than the giveaway it looks like. The core mission of Yang\u2019s campaign is to get people to see UBI, which he calls the \u201cFreedom Dividend,\u201d as the former rather than the latter, and he\u2019s exploiting every angle he can \u2014 including stereotypes \u2014 toward that end.\n\nFrustration with how little conventional politicians have done to address the onslaught from the next wave of technological disruption drove Yang into the presidential race. It\u2019s a phenomenon he describes at length in his book, \u201cThe War on Normal People.\u201d He says: \u201cDonald Trump in 2016 said he was going to make America great again, and what was Hillary Clinton\u2019s response? America\u2019s already great,\u201d adding, \u201cThat was not the right answer.\u201d In Yang\u2019s view, the right answer is a permanent stimulus routed through the pockets of every American to help them build a post-automation economy.\n\nHis belief is that, eventually, an American working class told to accept an ever-reduced standard of living \u2014 while the corporate beneficiaries of our system show indifference toward the despair, suicide, alcoholism and opiate abuse afflicting those left behind \u2014 could lash out with a fury that makes Trump look like a mild precursor. When Yang explains that \u201cTrump got many of the problems right,\u201d even if the president gets many solutions wrong, it is this dynamic he has in mind, and it is this economic wound that he proposes to heal with UBI and a raft of other policies focused on rescuing Americans from the zero-sum \u201cmind-set of scarcity\u201d currently deranging our politics.\n\n\n\nAndrew Yang speaks to voters at the Iowa State Fair on Aug. 9 in Des Moines. His emphasis on being an Asian American math nerd helps him pitch one of his central policy ideas: a universal basic income. (Salwan Georges/The Washington Post)\n\nYang has somehow used the bleakest vision of any candidate to generate the most fun of all the campaigns: He has tweeted video of himself playing Rachmaninoff on the piano, skateboarded, crowd-surfed, done the Cupid Shuffle and challenged Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) to a game of one-on-one basketball. The #YangGang calls out instances when their candidate is left off mainstream media infographics \u2014 neglect that only feeds their ardor. They love it when he revels in his underdog status, as he did when he tweeted, \u201cIt\u2019s all fun and games until Andrew Yang passes you in the polls.\u201d\n\nYang has cracked the code on how to be something that doesn\u2019t have much precedent in our political culture: an Asian American man able to summon and inspire large, enthusiastic crowds across the country in support of his bid for national leadership, charismatic enough to commandeer a spotlight that no one had wanted to train on him. After interviewing him, Politico senior politics editor Charlie Mahtesian tweeted: \u201cYang was much better than some of the veteran pols we\u2019ve seen before in the office \u2014 easy to see why he\u2019s got a following. Authentic, comfortable in his own skin, able to articulate a coherent reason for running, minimal amount of b.s. in answers to a wide range of questions.\u201d (Two other Democratic contenders, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (Hawaii) and Sen. Kamala Harris (Calif.), have Asian roots but don\u2019t conspicuously frame themselves as Asian American candidates.)\n\nIt turns out that being this figure doesn\u2019t entail being a scold about race. As Yang brought his Asian jokes to the televised debates (there\u2019s also the one about knowing a lot of doctors), some Asian American progressives took him to task for embracing a facially positive stereotype that, in their view, is \u201creaffirming toxic tropes\u201d and traps Asian Americans within a \u201cmodel minority\u201d framing. These critics were voicing the general strictness on matters of identity to which we are all supposed to defer these days. This month, Yang met with some of them and explained that while he respected and understood their objections, he sees it differently. And he\u2019s not an outlier: In one 2018 study, when asked if people nowadays \u201cdon\u2019t take racism seriously enough\u201d or if they\u2019re \u201ctoo sensitive about things to do with race,\u201d 73 percent of Asian Americans said people are \u201ctoo sensitive,\u201d more than the 60 percent overall who said the same.\n\n\n\nYang with supporters at a campaign event in New York in May. Their signs reference the candidate's ideas about \"human capitalism\" and his \"MATH\" slogan: Make America Think Harder. (Andres Kudacki/For The Washington Post)\n\nThe criticisms fundamentally miss Yang\u2019s objectives. His humor breaks the ice surrounding the first thing you notice about him \u2014 and the thing audiences are least prepared to parse. It has the paradoxical effect of highlighting how few of the identity-based hopes or antagonisms plaguing other candidacies affect the Asian American guy \u201cwho wants to give everyone $1,000 a month.\u201d Asian Americans, only about 6 percent of the population and heavily clustered in a few states, are often overlooked as a group. But given the overheated rhetoric surrounding other identity categories, for Yang, this lack of visibility could turn out to be a strength.\n\nIn the hierarchy of the schoolyard, the Andrew Yangs of the world were often the quarry of white bros like podcaster and \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d washout Shane Gillis. But in the world run by Big Data, it\u2019s Yang who is the New York millionaire with ties to Silicon Valley. When Yang forgave Gillis for mocking him as a \u201cJew C----,\u201d it wasn\u2019t just out of electoral expediency (though it was that, too) but because he believes that the key to stability between America\u2019s hinterlands and urban areas, to averting the civil disorder he spells out in his book, is a truce. After watching Gillis\u2019s comedy, Yang decided he wasn\u2019t the evil pariah that the progressive consensus assessed but instead \u201ca still-forming comedian from central Pennsylvania.\u201d This magnanimity isn\u2019t a capitulation, it\u2019s a sign of strength.\n\nYang grasps that, despite the grievances many Asian Americans justifiably hold about discrimination, members of the best-educated and highest-earning group in America shouldn\u2019t linger on victimhood.\n\nIn an era when activists debate whether a white man should lead the Democratic Party, or pollsters ask voters whether a woman or a minority can beat Trump, Yang arrives without baggage because he\u2019s an outsider to the black-white binary at the core of American racial tension. A country that not long ago elected its first black president to his second term, and Trump to his first, could well find a respite from this whipsaw dynamic in the very marginality of an Asian American candidate. Neither especially loved nor feared by either side of this divide, an Asian American might become what the country can agree to settle on: an honest broker. Accordingly, Yang has received welcoming treatment from Tucker Carlson, Ben Shapiro, Joe Rogan, Charlamagne Tha God and at Rev. Al Sharpton\u2019s National Action Network convention. Once derided as the candidate of NEETs and incels, Yang recently got a thumbs-up from #MeToo oracle Alyssa Milano, who told the hosts of the View, \u201cI love him\u201d because he\u2019s \u201cchanged the narrative.\u201d\n\nYang remains a long shot, and UBI still may be too outlandish for a lot of voters. But his presence in the Democratic debates has propelled his platform from the fringe to the national conversation, and he now has a unique political movement and its accompanying infrastructure. He\u2019s gone from being a novelty candidate to providing a glimpse at a future when Asian Americans become universal figures in American political life, and realize their potential not just to serve but to lead.", "description": "How to interpret the rise of the first competitive Asian American presidential candidate.", "authors": ["Wesley Yang"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/NlkSzwHbzdU9xHPUS785LdMqz3A=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CMSRUQLKIVEYHK7BVHF235VTOE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
