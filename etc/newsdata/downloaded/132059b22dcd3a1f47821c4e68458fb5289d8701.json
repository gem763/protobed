William Jackson Harper plays James, a junior associate at Bilott\u2019s firm.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Dart Waters, official trailer\n\nIt took nearly 20 years since he first took on that case in West Virginia, but Bilott\u2019s work eventually began to pay off. In 2005, DuPont reached a $16.5m settlement with the Environmental Protection Agency, which had accused the company of withholding information about the chemical PFOA, a type of PFAS, which was toxic and had been leeching out into the environment.\n\nIn 2017, DuPont and its spinoff company Chemours agreed to pay more than $671m to about 3,550 people who had been affected by PFOA leaking from a chemical plant in Parkersburg, West Virginia.\n\nBoth firms denied any wrongdoing.\n\nForever chemicals\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency has yet to ban PFOA, although some companies have phased out its use, they continue to use other types of PFAS chemicals, that \u201care just as bad\u201d Bilott said. Some of these chemicals are still used in some common products such as non-stick pans, waterproof makeup, plastic food packaging despite scientific evidence linking PFAS exposure with cancer, thyroid problems, and developmental issues in children. Because they don\u2019t break down in the environment, PFAS have been nicknamed \u201cforever chemicals\u201d. Some varieties can persist in the human body for years, if not decades.\n\nBy promoting the upcoming movie, and Bilott\u2019s book Exposure \u2013 which was released Tuesday \u2013 the actor and the lawyer said they hope to increase public awareness of just how ubiquitous the chemicals are, and mobilize people into action.\n\nWhy you need to know about PFAS, the chemicals in pizza boxes and rainwear Read more\n\n\u201cPFOA is pervasive. It is everywhere and it is forever,\u201d Ruffalo told the Guardian over email.\n\n\u201cWe have been poisoned and the corporation that has been doing it has known for years it has been doing it. And it has been covering it up,\u201d he said, referring to the legal actions. \u201cAnd I want people to know and to be outraged by that. And to protect themselves and their families.\u201d\n\nOne concern, he said, was that some schools serve children their lunches in plates and trays containing PFAS, Ruffalo said at the CEH event. \u201cIt would take 10 parents calling to any school to stop that tomorrow,\u201d he said.\n\nBilott added that he\u2019s heartened to see governments moving toward legislation to phase the chemicals out of everyday products. In the US, Congress is seeking to address PFAS as part of a 2020 defense bill, after reports found high levels of the chemicals in groundwater near military installations and airports that use firefighting foam containing PFAS. Companies like DuPont and 3M have maintained that the chemicals pose no health risk at current levels.\n\nLast year, a United Nations added PFAS chemicals PFOA and PFOS, to a list of toxic substances that should be globally banned.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about something here that\u2019s in water all over the country, all over the world. It\u2019s in everybody\u2019s blood,\u201d Bilott said. \u201cThe more attention we can bring to this, the better.\u201d", "description": "Mark Ruffalo\u2019s new film tells the story of environmental lawyer Rob Billot who took on DuPont over contaminated water from one of its plants", "authors": ["Maanvi Singh"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4602a2235186ca3277e9cbb7c79944af61a2969b/139_0_3153_1892/master/3153.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a7095870479017470a3d0872406be33f", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
