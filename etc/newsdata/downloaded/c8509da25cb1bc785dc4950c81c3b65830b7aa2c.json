Now that is set to change.\n\nFor more stories go to www.BusinessInsider.co.za.\n\nForeign refugees are now one step away from being able to practically claim against South Africa's Unemployment Insurance Fund (UIF), decades and two major court cases later.\n\nAsylum seekers who enter South Africa looking for protected status as formal refugees are eligible to work as soon as they register at refugee reception centres, while their claim is being evaluated. They can, and often do, contribute to UIF \u2013 but were barred from claiming against the fund when they lost their jobs because they lacked South African identity documents.\n\nUntil 2009 the regulations that govern UIF payments required a South African ID book or South African passport in order to eligible for payments.\n\nIn that year the rules were updated \u2013 with retrospective effect \u2013 to include \"non-RSA\" identity documents and \"valid foreign identity documents and passports\".\n\nBut even then asylum seekers, if they did have such documents at all, were barred from payouts, the Equality Court heard in a matter decided in 2017. The department of labour said its systems simply did not allow people without local ID or passport numbers to be registered to receive the cash they were, in other respects, eligible for.\n\nThe department was ordered to fix its systems.\n\nTwo years later, in February 2019, the government initially opposed a claim in the high court about the same issue, then at the last minute before a hearing in the high court conceded that the system is unfair.\n\nThis week labour minister Thulas Nxesi published an update to the UIF regulations, kicking off a 30-day comment window before they can be made final.\n\n\n\nUnder the new wording a valid identity document to claim against UIF will include \u201cpermits and other identifying documents contemplated in or issued in terms of the Refugees Act\u201d.\n\nThat law stipulates the paperwork that must be issued to those claiming refugee status as soon as they cross into South Africa, and the more detailed paperwork issued when they register at reception centres.\n\nIn terms of a court order on the February case, the government had nine months to update the regulations in such fashion, a deadline that expires in July.\n\nOn Wednesday the Werksmans pro bono legal team behind that order said it will be studying the draft regulations to ensure they are fully complaint with the high court's directions.\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa", "description": "A small draft update to regulations means an asylum seeker in South Africa will have the documents necessary to claim against unemployment insurance they pay towards.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9455/5467917a98f94fe080a146a366ab6e0a.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
