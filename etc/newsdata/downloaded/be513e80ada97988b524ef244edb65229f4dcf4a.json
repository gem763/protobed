They assess that \u201c1 in 4 women struggle to afford period products due to a lack of income.\u201d They also believe \u201cperiod stigma\u201d is making menstruation a \u201ctaboo topic,\u201d despite the emergence of the Women\u2019s March movement, which resulted in Ashley Judd\u2019s infamous \u201cNasty Woman\u201d speech in the nation\u2019s capital in 2017.\n\n\u201cI am not as nasty as a man who looks like he bathes in Cheetos dust,\u201d Judd said, later lamenting \u201cbloodstains\u201d on her bedsheets:\n\nI am nasty like my bloodstains on my bed sheets. We do not actually choose if and when we had our periods. We do not like throwing away our favorite pairs of underpants. Why are pads and tampons still taxed when Viagra and Rogaine are not? Is your erection really more than protecting the parts of my womanhood? Is the bloodstain on my jeans more embarrassing than the thinning of your hair?\n\nActivists are pushing rallies across all 50 states in hopes of \u201cdemanding real change to making period products more accessible for all and ending the #TamponTax.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf faces were bleeding, someone would do something,\u201d the PERIOD Movement tweeted alongside a video of people \u2014 including men \u2014 with bloody noses.\n\n\u201cTHIS SATURDAY is the first-ever #NationalPeriodDay. We\u2019re hosting rallies in all 50 states to demand menstrual equity and an end to the #tampontax,\u201d it added.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to have PMS to be f*cking pissed off about this, but it helps,\u201d those in the video stated:\n\n\ud83d\udd34If faces were bleeding, someone would do something \ud83d\udd34THIS SATURDAY is the first-ever #NationalPeriodDay.

Simply put \u2014 MENSTRUAL HYGIENE IS A RIGHT, NOT A PRIVILEGE. We are the Menstrual Movement \u2014 fighting for equitable access to menstrual hygiene, and breaking down the stigma surrounding periods. This fight is on ALL OF US, and we must TAKE ACTION NOW. Unlike most poverty-related issues, this one is solvable. Along with destigmatizing periods, we are calling for: 1. Clean and healthy period products to be freely accessible in schools, shelters, and prisons 2. Eliminate the \u201ctampon tax\u201d \u2013 exempt period products from the sales tax.\n\nFar-left \u201cSquad\u201d member Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) tweeted support of the movement, noting her role as a co-sponsor of the Menstrual Equity for All Act:\n\nIt\u2019s time that we acknowledge menstrual health as a critical part of care. No student should be forced to miss school because they don\u2019t have access to affordable menstrual products. That\u2019s why I am a proud cosponsor of the Menstrual Equity for All Act. #NationalPeriodDay \u2014 Rep. Ilhan Omar (@Ilhan) October 9, 2019\n\nThe PERIOD Movement is encouraging activists to promote the cause on Saturday by using the hashtags \u201c#NATIONALPERIODDAY\u201d and \u201c#PERIODPOWER.\u201d", "description": "Left-wing activists are preparing for the \"world's first National Period Day\" in an effort to elevate \"the issue of period poverty.\"", "authors": ["Hannah Bleau"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/pads-period-poverty-tampon-tax-store-ap-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
