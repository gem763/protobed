Absolutely,\u201d Mulvaney said. \u201cNo question about that. But that\u2019s it, and that\u2019s why we held up the money.\u201d\n\nMulvaney said that Trump was concerned about corruption in Ukraine, including its efforts in the 2016 election during a press briefing with reporters on Thursday afternoon.\n\n\u201cThe look-back to what happened in 2016 certainly was part of the thing that he was worried about in corruption with that nation,\u201d Mulvaney said. \u201cAnd that is absolutely appropriate.\u201d\n\nDemocrats immediately jumped on Mulvaney\u2019s statement, declaring that it was proof that the president had a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d agreement with the foreign aid.\n\nBut Mulvaney said it was a common request.\n\n\u201cWe do that all the time with foreign policy,\u201d he said, referring to requirements for foreign aid before it was released.\n\n\u201cI have news for everybody, get over it. There\u2019s going to be political influence in foreign policy,\u201d Mulvaney said.\n\nHe said that asking Ukraine for help in an investigation into the 2016 election was an ongoing Justice Department investigation and \u201ccompletely legitimate.\u201d\n\nHe also said that the holdup on delivering aid funds had nothing to do with Ukraine investigating former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\n\u201cThe money that was held up had nothing to do with Biden,\u201d Mulvaney said.\n\nTrump spoke about investigating the Democrat National Committee server and Crowdstrike in his call with Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky, which was later released by the White House.\n\nCrowdStrike, the cybersecurity firm that examined the DNC server and said it was hacked by the Russians, was founded by Ukrainian Dmitri Alperovitch (now an American citizen) and funded by Ukrainian oligarch Viktor Pinchuk. The DNC did not turn over the server to the FBI to conduct their own investigation.\n\nMayor Rudy Giuliani has repeatedly demanded further investigations into the Ukranian effort to assist the DNC dig up political dirt on the president in the 2016 election.", "description": "Mick Mulvaney confirmed that Donald Trump wanted Ukraine to commit to an investigation into attempts to meddle in the 2016 election.", "authors": ["Charlie Spiering"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Mulvaney-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
