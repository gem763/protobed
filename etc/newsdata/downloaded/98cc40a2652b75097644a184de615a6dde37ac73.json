We\u2019ve all known that the network is anti-Trump garbage. They couldn\u2019t report on President Trump\u2019s visit to Japan accurately; you all remember the koi fish feeding screw-up, right? They screwed up on the Wikileaks story. In that epic fail, some donor said he had keyword access to the trove of emails from then-Clinton campaign chair John Podesta and the Democratic National Committee. It was sent to Trump, his son, and other top aides. The problem is that the documents were already made public. Checking the time stamp would\u2019ve been elementary, right? And how about the time they got played by Michael Cohen\u2019s attorney, Lanny Davis, over the Trump Tower meeting. In that circus, there were allegations that Trump knew about the meeting his son was having with some Russians. No evidence was provided but super-secret sources told CNN so it must be true, right. It wasn\u2019t.\n\nSo, should we be shocked that the network\u2019s hosts and its management led by Jeff Zucker hate the president? The animus has caused them to make epic blunders. We all knew this. And now we have solid evidence, as a source, Cary Poarch, came forward to James O\u2019Keefe providing videos of the networks anti-Trump bias. In one instance, top Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway was being interviewed by host Jake Tapper.\n\nUPDATE: #ExposeCNN full part 3 dropping tomorrow...but don\u2019t worry, we got something for you today too.\n\n\n\nCC: @jaketapper pic.twitter.com/qviC75oxvU \u2014 James O'Keefe (@JamesOKeefeIII) October 16, 2019\n\nBREAKING: @CNN Media Coordinator Christian Sierra states 'Jeff Zucker goes into the control room while @JakeTapper is interviewing @kellyannepolls'; tells Executive Producer to skip commercials, extend 7 minute interview to 25 minutes to \"just f**king nail her\"#ExposeCNN pic.twitter.com/nccxLvtT46 \u2014 James O'Keefe (@JamesOKeefeIII) October 16, 2019\n\nMedia Coordinator Christian Sierra said that Zucker came into the control room, where he ordered that commercials were to be nixed and extend the interview. That was an order given to the executive producer of Tapper\u2019s show. This seven-minute hit became a 25-minute exchange with the goal of nailing Conway on air.\n\nSierra said that Zucker was telling Tapper through his earpiece to \u201ckeep going\u2026don\u2019t stop.\u201d\n\n\u201cKellyanne Conway is a prude face,\u201d said Sierra. The point, and again\u2014nothing earth-shattering here, is that when there\u2019s an opportunity to screw over a Trump surrogate or adviser\u2014don\u2019t be shocked if Zucker sees it and then takes control in the hopes of capturing a train wreck. As Tim noted, if you saw commercials from last night\u2019s debate, the network isn\u2019t exactly hiding its hatred towards Trump.\n\nJust remember that this network that\u2019s perpetually stuck in third place would be showing re-runs of game shows if it weren\u2019t for airports. But it still nice to torch them. Poarch also said that overall, there is a general rule: if you're a full-blown Trump supporter, right, or even right of center, CNN is not the place for you. All of our suspicions are being confirmed, but also why would you go over to CNN if you were a conservative. We all know Fox News is much better.", "description": ".10/16/2019 16:38:30PM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa", "Timothy Meads", "Bronson Stocking", "Cortney O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/154/8d36935f-3848-404b-bb38-2dba87557ecc.png", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
