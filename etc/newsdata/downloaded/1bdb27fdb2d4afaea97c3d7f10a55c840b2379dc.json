Here's an explanation of what happened today - and what happens next.\n\nWhat happened today?\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nBoris Johnson lost a historic House of Commons vote - which now means he is legally obliged to ask for a Brexit delay by 11pm tonight.\n\nHere's how it worked.\n\nThe Prime Minister had wanted to force MPs into a straight \"meaningful vote\" on his Brexit deal. That would have either accepted or rejected it - end of story.\n\nAnd if it'd been accepted, it would have locked in a legal countdown to October 31.\n\nBut instead, MPs voted 322-306 for an amendment to \"withhold\" approval for the Brexit deal, \"unless and until\" every part of it has passed into UK law.\n\nSir Oliver Letwin, the ringleader, insisted he wasn't trying to scupper Brexit - merely setting up an insurance policy to prevent no-deal by accident.\n\nBut the consequence is we still don't have a Brexit deal by 11pm tonight. That's a legal deadline laid down under a law called the Benn Act.\n\nThe Benn Act says Boris Johnson must send a letter to the EU asking for a three-month delay to Brexit, if there's no agreement by 11pm tonight.\n\nWill Boris Johnson ask for a Brexit delay tonight?\n\n(Image: UK PARLIAMENT/AFP via Getty Imag)\n\nBoris Johnson seems almost certain to send a letter to the EU by 11pm tonight - very begrudgingly.\n\nNo10 aides were staying tight-lipped but did say the government will abide by the law.\n\nBut whether the PM has any other tricks up his sleeve to get round the extension remains to be seen.\n\nHe has already asked EU leaders to say they would veto any delay - so he can frame a deal vs no deal choice for MPs.\n\nBut wait - he said he wouldn't! What's that all about?\n\n(Image: UK PARLIAMENT/AFP via Getty Imag)\n\nAha! Not quite.\n\nMr Johnson carefully avoided saying if he would or wouldn't send the legal letter asking for a delay.\n\nBut he did say: \"I will not negotiate a delay with the EU and neither does the law compel me to do so!\"\n\nWhat Boris Johnson is doing here is saying that, even if forced to ask for a delay, he will make things as difficult and annoying as possible for the EU.\n\nThe PM added: \"I will tell our friends and colleagues in the EU exactly what I\u2019ve told everyone in the last 88 days that I\u2019ve served as Prime Minister: that further delay would be bad for this country, bad for the European Union and bad for democracy.\n\n\"Since I became Prime Minister I\u2018ve said we must get on and get Brexit done on October 31 so that this country can move on. That policy remains unchanged.\n\n\"No delays, and I will continue to do all I can to get Brexit done on October 31.\"\n\nCan the EU refuse to grant a delay?\n\n(Image: POOL/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nTechnically, yes.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron went furthest. \"I am not trying to read into the future but I do not think we shall grant any further delay,\u201d he said last week.\n\nBut very few people seriously expect the EU to say no if a request comes in.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel is among those who has indicated as much.\n\nThe big question is how long an extension would be.\n\nWould they grant just two weeks to allow the withdrawal bill legislation to pass through Parliament?\n\nOr would they insist on a longer one - until the end of January as set out in the Benn Act perhaps - to give the UK time to resolve this once and for all.\n\nIs Boris Johnson's Brexit deal dead now?\n\n(Image: UK PARLIAMENT/AFP via Getty Imag)\n\nNo, not at all.\n\nIn fact, it's not actually affected by today's vote.\n\nDespite Boris Johnson's intentions, today's Commons showdown ended up being not very much to do with the deal at all.\n\nWhat will happen next?\n\n(Image: UK PARLIAMENT/AFP via Getty Imag)\n\nThe government now plans to have another go at the 'meaningful vote' on the Brexit deal on Monday afternoon.\n\nIt's not guaranteed - Speaker John Bercow will make a ruling on Monday on whether bringing the same vote again is within Commons rules.\n\nAfter that, ministers will introduce the Withdrawal Agreement Bill - the parallel process that encodes the Brexit deal into law.\n\nMPs are expected to have their first big vote on the Bill, known as a \"second reading\", on Tuesday. It would be rushed through Commons stages, potentially by Thursday, before being rushed over to the House of Lords.\n\nThe idea is that, even if legally Boris Johnson has to ask for a delay, Brexit will be voted through and done and dusted by October 31 anyway.\n\nWill the Brexit deal pass?\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nIt can. Though that doesn't mean it will - the vote's on a knife edge.\n\nThe PM's DUP allies vowed to vote against, while Labour oppose the deal for watering down workers' rights.\n\nSo victory hinges on just a few Tories and Labour MPs in Leave seats.\n\nWhat are the sticking points in the Brexit deal?\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nThe same as they were before today's drama.\n\nBoris Johnson finally agreed a Brexit deal with the EU on October 17 - keeping a transition period to December 2020 and the \u00a339bn divorce bill, but scrapping the Irish backstop.\n\nIn the backstop's place would effectively be 'two borders' in a hybrid system.\n\nNorthern Ireland and Britain would share a legal customs territory - technically forcing customs checks on goods crossing the 310-mile border with the Republic.\n\nBut in practice, to avoid checks at the border, the checks will instead happen when goods reach Northern Ireland on the island of Ireland. Critics say this puts a customs border across the Irish Sea.\n\nNorthern Ireland and the Republic would share some EU single market rules - forcing checks on manufactured and agricultural products crossing the Irish Sea.\n\nThe Northern Ireland Assembly - known as Stormont - will get a vote every four years on whether to let EU law continue.\n\nBut this vote could be passed by a simple majority - denying the DUP a veto on staying under EU laws long-term.\n\nMeanwhile commitments on workers' rights were deprioritised - moved to the non-legally-binding Political Declaration for agreement later.\n\nOn Friday night Boris Johnson unveiled a last-minute offer on workers\u2019 rights after his deal watered them down. But it was slammed by Labour\u2019s leadership and the TUC as not worth the paper it\u2019s written on.\n\nI still don't understand the Letwin amendment. Can you explain more?\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nThis is a bit tricky to explain.\n\nBut basically, it's because today was never going to be the final vote on the Brexit deal.\n\nMPs will get loads more votes on something called the Withdrawal Agreement Bill, which is an instrument used to pass the deal formally into law.\n\nThe problem is that if the Bill got stuck or disputed, the 'Benn Act' - which forces the PM to seek a delay to Brexit if there's no deal - would have lapsed because it has an October 19 deadline.\n\nSir Oliver feared that, if the Withdrawal Agreement Bill somehow got snarled up after October 19, we would have been left in legal limbo on October 31.\n\nSo his amendment refused to approve the Brexit deal \"unless and until\" every single vote on the legislation is safely passed.\n\nThis meant Boris Johnson missed the 11pm deadline on October 19 to have a confirmed Brexit deal, so legally, he had to ask for a delay.\n\nWhat does all this mean for a second referendum?\n\n(Image: Peter Summers)\n\nThere is likely to be an attempt to tag a second referendum onto the Brexit legislation.\n\nLabour MPs Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson are expected to bring back their amendment, which could get the backing of the Labour frontbench.\n\nBut it is far from clear whether the numbers are there in Parliament for a fresh public vote - so they may hold off yet again.\n\nThe Government has also indicated they would try to thwart any second referendum, possibly by refusing to sign off the cash.\n\nHowever the EU has said it would willingly grant a longer Brexit extension to hold one, or a general election.\n\nWhat does this all mean for a general election?\n\n(Image: Kiran Ridley)\n\nIf MPs spend the next two weeks legislating on Brexit , a general election cannot be held before Christmas.\n\nLabour is unlikely to trigger a confidence vote, which could collapse Boris Johnson's administration, while the legislative process is ongoing.\n\nAnd because of the five-weeks legally needed between the calling of a snap ballot and a poll being held, taking up parliamentary time until Halloween mean the earliest ballot would be held is in January.\n\nThat is because Cabinet Secretary Sir Mark Sedwill has reportedly warned an election should not take place after December 12 in the run-up to Christmas.\n\nBut early January will not see an election either because no-one wants the festive season to be overshadowed by electoral campaigning.\n\nSo the next likely date would be mid-February.", "description": "Boris Johnson's bid for a 'Super Saturday' on Brexit has ended in humiliation - and yet more delay.
