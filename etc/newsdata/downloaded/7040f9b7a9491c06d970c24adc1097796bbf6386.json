The water cannon fired blue jets of water, used elsewhere in the world to help identify protesters later.\n\n\u201cRadical protesters are currently occupying Harcourt Road in Admiralty, vandalizing Central Government Offices and repeatedly throwing petrol bombs inside,\u201d police said in a statement.\n\nThousands of protesters, many clad in black masks, caps and shades to obscure their identity, raced through the streets of the financial hub in cat-and-mouse tactics with police, setting street fires and blocking roads in the heart of the city.\n\nAuthorities moved quickly to douse the fires and police fired volleys of tear gas to disperse protesters, including in the bustling shopping and tourist district of Causeway Bay.\n\nViolence erupted in the district of Fortress Hill on the east of the island as men in white T-shirts, some wielding rods, clashed with anti-government activists.\n\nA heavy police presence could be seen in and around subway stations. Rail operator MTR Corp has become a prime target of vandalism, with activists angry that it closes stations during protests and prevents demonstrators from gathering.\n\nShops in key protest areas once again shuttered early as more than three months of demonstrations continued to take a toll on business.\n\nRelated Coverage Hong Kong police fire tear gas to break up protesters\n\nThe Airport Authority said on Sunday passenger numbers fell 12.4% year-on-year in August to six million. Protesters last month jammed the airport arrivals hall, leading to canceled or delayed flights as they sought to draw world attention to their fight for democracy.\n\nBut while chaotic scenes of protesters clashing with police have been beamed live to the world - at times under gleaming skyscrapers in the heart of the financial center - life for many in the Chinese-ruled territory proceeds relatively normally.\n\nBRITISH CONSULATE RALLY\n\nWhile the turnout on Sunday was smaller than previous weekends, the unrest underscores the defiance of many activists.\n\nDemonstrators are angry about what they see as creeping interference by Beijing in their city\u2019s affairs despite a promise of autonomy.\n\nThe spark for the protests was planned legislation, now withdrawn, that would have allowed people to be sent to mainland China for trial.\n\nThe protests have since broadened into calls for universal suffrage.\n\nEarlier on Sunday, protesters gathered peacefully outside the British Consulate, calling on Britain to rein in China and ensure it respects the city\u2019s freedoms.\n\nThe Sino-British Joint Declaration, signed in 1984, lays out Hong Kong\u2019s future after its return to China in 1997, a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula that ensures freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland.\n\nAn anti-government protester throws back a tear gas canister at the police during a demonstration near Central Government Complex in Hong Kong, China, September 15, 2019.

It has accused foreign powers, particularly the United States and Britain, of fomenting the unrest and told them to mind their own business.\n\nBritain says it has a legal responsibility to ensure China abides by the 1984 declaration.\n\nHong Kong island was granted to Britain \u201cin perpetuity\u201d in 1842 at the end of the First Opium War. Kowloon, a peninsula on the mainland opposite Hong Kong island, joined later, after the Second Opium War.\n\nThe colony was expanded to include the New Territories, to the north of Kowloon, on a 99-year lease, in 1898.\n\nBritain returned all of the territory to China, which never recognized the \u201cunequal treaties\u201d, in 1997.\n\n\u201cThe Joint Declaration is a legally binding treaty between the UK and China that remains as valid today as it was when it was signed and ratified over 30 years ago,\u201d a British Foreign Office spokeswoman said in June.\n\n\u201cAs a co-signatory, the UK government will continue to defend our position.\u201d\n\nSlideshow (29 Images)\n\nBut it was not immediately clear what Britain could or would want to do to defend that position.\n\nIt is pinning its hopes on closer trade and investment cooperation with China, which since 1997 has risen to become the world\u2019s second-largest economy, after it leaves the European Union at the end of next month.", "description": "Hong Kong police fired water cannon and volleys of tear gas to disperse protesters throwing petrol bombs at government buildings on Sunday, as months of sometimes violent demonstrations showed no sign of letting up.", "authors": ["Marius Zaharia", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190915&t=2&i=1430070471&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8E07G", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
