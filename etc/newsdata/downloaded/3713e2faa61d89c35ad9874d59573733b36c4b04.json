Elizabeth Warren has been \u201cextremely evasive\u201d on whether she would raise middle-class taxes to help implement a universal \u201cMedicare for All\u201d health care system.\n\n\u201cSen. Warren is known for being straightforward and was extremely evasive when asked that question, and we\u2019ve seen that repeatedly,\u201d Mr. Buttigieg, mayor of South Bend, Indiana, said on CNN.\n\n\u201cI think that If you are proud of your plan and it\u2019s the right plan, you should defend it in straightforward terms,\u201d Mr. Buttigieg said. \u201cAnd I think it\u2019s puzzling that when everybody knows the answer to that question of whether her plan and Sen. [Bernard] Sanders\u2019 plan will raise middle-class taxes is yes, why you wouldn\u2019t just say so and explain why you think that\u2019s the better way forward.\u201d\n\nAsked multiple times during last week\u2019s Democratic debate whether middle-class taxes would go up under her plan, Ms. Warren of Massachusetts pivoted and said health care costs would go down.\n\nMr. Buttigieg on Thursday unveiled his own health care proposal that includes a public insurance option and said his plan would not require raising middle-class taxes.\n\n\u201cIt does create a way for everybody to be covered, and I think that\u2019s what most Americans want,\u201d he said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
