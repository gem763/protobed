Why is he chasing three grown men?\"\n\nThe men navigated the trail for a couple of anxious minutes before finally stopping to see if they had shaken their stalker.\n\n'This isn't normal'\n\nSuddenly, the bear reappeared only metres away.\n\n\"That's when I kind of got a knot in my stomach,\" said Martyn. \"Like, this isn't good, this isn't normal. [A bear] shouldn't be chasing us for that long, for over a kilometre.\"\n\nBrad Martyn says the bear chased him and his two friends for over a kilometre. (submitted by Brad Martyn)\n\nOn the video, you can hear the panic rising in the men's voices as they try to figure out what to do.\n\nThey finally decide to position their bikes to try to look bigger and then start yelling and throwing rocks.\n\nThe bear reluctantly moves away but still followed the men for a short time after, albeit from a greater distance.\n\nMartyn says he's no stranger to bear encounters having spent years mountain biking in Whistler, Squamish and the Lower Mainland. But, he says, this time he felt nervous.\n\n\"Normally they just smell you and take off,\" he said. \"I don't know if he was curious or smelled food or maybe he was a younger bear that just wanted somebody to play with.\"\n\nMartyn say next time he goes mountain biking on Seymour, he'll pack bear spray.", "description": "The entire encounter was\u00a0captured\u00a0on a helmet-mounted camera and plays out like a scene from a scary movie.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5306347.1570061389!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/bear-chases-cyclists.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
