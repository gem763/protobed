Reid and Associates Inc. filed a federal lawsuit against DuVernay and Netflix on Monday.\n\nThey say the movie's depiction of the 'Reid Technique' of questioning suspects is inaccurate - and claims that cops used the method to 'squeeze statements' from the Central Park Five suspects are defamatory.\n\nThe Reid Technique is a three-step process for solving a crime that involves a behavior analysis interview with a 'non-accusatory' question and answer session meant to procure information from a suspect in a controlled environment, according to exerts from the second edition of 'Essentials of the Reid Technique: Criminal Investigations and Confessions'.\n\n'The clinical nature of the interview, including the asking of specific behavior provoking questions, is designed to provide the investigator with verbal, paralinguistic and nonverbal behavior symptoms which either support probable truthfulness or deception,' co-authors Brian C. Jayne and Joseph P. Buckley wrote.\n\nThe Reid Technique has become standard practice in law enforcement despite criticism that it routinely tricks suspects, especially children, into giving false confessions.\n\nThe training company's namesake, late police officer John E. Reid, developed the Reid Technique in the 1940s and '50s. He died in 1982.\n\n'When They See Us' tells the true story of the Central Park Five, five black and Latino New York teenagers who were falsely convicted of charges relating to the brutal rape of a white woman who was jogging in Central Park on April 20, 1989.\n\nJohn E. Reid and Associates Inc.says DuVernay's film lies about how the Reid Technique was used by police to produce false confessions from of the Central Park Five characters in her movie\n\nChapter four of DuVernay's film series includes Manhattan assistant D.A. Nancy Ryan's takedown of how police rounded up random black and Latino teenagers before depriving them of food, sleep and access to their parents or an attorney while interrogating each of them from seven to more than 24 hours\n\nAsante Blackk, from left, Jharrel Jerome, Caleel Harris, Ethan Herisse, and Marquis Rodriguez portray the teenage versions of the Central Park Five characters in 'When They See Us'\n\n(From left to right) Real life Central Park Five exonerees Antron McCray, Raymond Santana, ore than a decade after their conviction and years of prison time, Kevin Richardson, Raymond Santana, Kevin Richardson, Korey Wise, and Yusef Salaam with 'When They See Us' director Ava DuVernay (center) during arrivals of the 71st Primetime Emmy Awards on September 22\n\nMore than a decade after their conviction and years of prison time, Kevin Richardson, Raymond Santana, Antron McCray, Yusef Salaam, and Korey Wise were all exonerated by DNA evidence and a confession from the actual rapist, Matias Reyes, whose DNA matched a sample taken at the scene at the time of the incident.\n\nChapter four of DuVernay's film series includes Manhattan assistant D.A. Nancy Ryan's takedown of how police rounded up random black and Latino teenagers before depriving them of food, sleep and access to their parents or an attorney while interrogating each of them for up to 24 hours.\n\n'You squeezed statements out of them after 42 hours of questioning and coercing, without food, bathroom breaks, withholding parental supervision,' Ryan tells Detective Sheehan during the scene.\n\n'The Reid Technique has been universally rejected,' she adds.\n\nCentral Park Five lead prosecutor Elizabeth Lederer played by actress Vera Farmiga (left) in 'When They See Us' resigned from her teaching position at Columbia Law School after the movie was released\n\nPublic backlash from 'When They See Us' compelled a publisher to drop retired Manhattan district attorney-turned author Linda Fairstein, portrayed in the film series by Felicity Huffman (left) who helped seal the fate of the Central Park Five in 1990. Fairstein was also asked to resign from a number of non-profit boards after the film series' release\n\nReid's attorneys argue the assertion that the Reid Technique has been 'universally rejected' is false and that the movie implies all of the improper methods used on the Central Park Five are consistent with the Reid Technique, which it says has caused reputational damage to the Reid company.\n\n'Defendants intended to incite an audience reaction against Reid for what occurred in the Central Park Jogger Case and for the coercive interrogation tactics that continue to be used today,' the suit reads. 'Defendants published the statements in an effort to cause a condemnation of the Reid Technique.'\n\nNetflix and DuVernay have not responded publicly to the allegations yet.\n\nTheir award-winning film already compelled a publisher to cease doing business with retired Manhattan district attorney-turned author Linda Fairstein, who helped seal the fate of the Central Park Five in 1990.\n\nFairstein was also asked to resign from a number of non-profit boards after the release of 'When They See Us' led to renewed outrage and backlash, which also forced Central Park Five lead prosecutor Elizabeth Lederer to resign from her teaching position at Columbia Law School.", "description": "John E.
