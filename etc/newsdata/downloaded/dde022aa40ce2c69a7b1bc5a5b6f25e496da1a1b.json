A spate of appearances on cable news shows never provided the \"viral moment\" he sought to jumpstart his campaign. And his frequent trips out of town weighed on his approval ratings back home.\n\nIn August, he caught flak for taking to social media to marvel at the beauty of Nevada\u2019s Red Rock Canyon, where he was taking a hike during a trip covered by campaign and government expenses. \u201cGreetings from \u2014 anywhere but the Big Apple,\u201d the New York Post jabbed.\n\nBut on Friday, he was all Big Apple pride.\n\n\u201cI have been working constantly throughout the last four months on things that really matter to New Yorkers,\u201d he told reporters outside Gracie Mansion, the mayor\u2019s official residence on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.\n\nHe referenced the business of government he has tended to in recent months \u2014 passing the annual city budget and reaching a deal on pay parity for child care workers.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been doing plan after plan, progress of all kinds. I think everyday New Yorkers get it. I think the insiders like to talk about it a certain way, but everyday New Yorkers see things happening all the time,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ll be seeing a lot more over the next two years, three months and 11 days.\u201d\n\nAn hour or so earlier, he bristled when a radio caller \u2014 seemingly an \u201ceveryday New Yorker\u201d \u2014 began his question by welcoming the mayor back to New York. \u201cI never left,\u201d he said, clearly irked by the assertion.\n\nAfter taking questions for 10 minutes outside Gracie Mansion, the mayor boarded a downtown subway to the climate march. The rare train ride \u2014 he's typically driven around the city by his police detail \u2014 provided him a chance to show unity with crowds of New Yorkers as pictures poured into Twitter.\n\nWhether de Blasio continues to be active and present during his remaining time in office is an open question.\n\nHe has already decided to reactivate his federal and state political action committees to support candidates and policies throughout the country, campaign senior adviser Jon Paul Lupo said on Friday.\n\nLupo, who previously worked in City Hall, is opening his own firm and plans to work on that effort. The PACs also served as exploratory committees for de Blasio in an unusual campaign finance scheme that prompted two complaints with the Federal Election Commission.\n\nIn fact, the FEC sent his campaign a letter this week demanding more information about the PACs\u2019 record-keeping.\n\nBut on Friday, de Blasio appeared almost jovial, pleased with his decision to run and at peace with his decision to drop out.\n\nHe said he began to realize he had no path to victory when he failed to meet the donor and polling qualifications the Democratic National Committee set in place for the September debate.\n\nLooking to Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, who qualified for a debate in July after missing the threshold in June, de Blasio pressed on anyway.\n\n\u201cI indicated to all you guys a couple weeks back that the debates to me had become the main street of this election season. That does not mean they\u2019re particularly satisfying enterprises,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut as we went over the last few weeks, every day that passed, it got tougher as there wasn\u2019t more progress,\u201d he said.\n\nA source familiar with his decision said he had hoped his appearance on CNN for a one-on-one town hall-style interview in August would give him the exposure he needed to increase his poll numbers and fundraising totals.\n\nBut both remained stagnant. So, following a final swing through South Carolina over the weekend and a speech at an AFL-CIO presidential summit in Philadelphia on Tuesday, he decided to pull the plug.\n\n\u201cWe were watching the polling to see if anything was moving and it just wasn\u2019t moving,\u201d de Blasio said. \u201cSo in the end, you know, you gotta make decisions based on the facts and sometimes it\u2019s just not your time. And that\u2019s okay.\u201d\n\nHis campaign staffers, who have been working out of a shared office space in Gowanus for the past few months, are now deciding whether to return to City Hall, where most of them worked before taking leave.\n\nJon Green, the political director for the campaign and a former City Hall senior adviser, said he is undecided on his next move. And no one would say what de Blasio\u2019s son, recent college graduate Dante de Blasio, has planned. Dante has been a fixture in the mayor\u2019s political career for years and had a paid job on this campaign.\n\n\u201cBill de Blasio has two more years to communicate the actual good he's done in NYC, work on a better relationship with the reporters who cover him and the elected officials who should be with him, and get more things done for the people of this City,\u201d tweeted his former adviser Rebecca Katz, a political consultant who said she is not aligned with any presidential campaign. \u201cI hope he succeeds.\u201d", "description": "He tweeted the classic \u201cI heart NY\u201d slogan to accompany a picture of the demonstration.", "authors": ["Sally Goldenberg"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/00/6b/289c8ce741ce9a03cae5ff86bb93/gettyimages-1169848755-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
