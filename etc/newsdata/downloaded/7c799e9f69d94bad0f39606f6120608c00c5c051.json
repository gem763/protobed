Will the WAB now move to the next stage of the parliamentary process?\n\nNo. Because even though MPs voted in favour of the Bill, they voted by 322 to 308 to reject Mr Johnson\u2019s plan to take the legislation through the Commons in just three days.\n\nMr Johnson told MPs he would \u2018pause\u2019 the WAB until the EU takes a decision on whether to grant another Brexit delay.\n\nHow did the EU react to the development?\n\nA spokeswoman for European Commission said they have taken note of Tuesday night\u2019s result and \u2018expects the UK Government to inform us about the next steps\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEuropean Council President Donald Tusk later said he will recommend the EU accept the UK\u2019s request for a Brexit extension.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nDo MPs just want more time to study the WAB?\n\nThere is a desire for more time to scrutinise the legislation, yes. SNP MP Joanna Cherry QC said the programme motion was \u2018frankly ludicrous for such complex legislation\u2019.\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn has offered to work with the Government to agree a \u2018reasonable timetable\u2019 for the WAB.\n\nMr Corbyn said this would be a \u2018sensible\u2019 way forward. Time will tell as to whether the Prime Minister agrees.\n\nJeremy Corbyn has said he would work with the Government to agree a \u2018reasonable timetable\u2019 (Picture: EPA)\n\nCould there be an extension?\n\nUnder the terms of the Benn Act, which was passed against the PM\u2019s wishes, the Prime Minister was compelled to write to the EU asking for a three-month Brexit extension if he had not secured a deal by 11pm UK time on October 19.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe told the Commons: \u2018I will not negotiate a delay with the EU, and neither does the law compel me to do so.\u2019\n\nBut he did send two letters to European Council President Donald Tusk.\n\nFirst, there was an unsigned photocopy of the request he was obliged to send under the Benn Act, followed by a letter explaining why the Government did not actually want an extension.\n\nThe EU has yet to take a decision on whether to grant another delay, but European Council President Donald Tusk said he will recommend the EU27 accept the UK request for an extension.\n\nThere is also talk in Westminster of a technical extension to allow the UK to leave the EU once the Bill has passed.\n\nThe EU has yet to take a decision on whether to grant another delay (Picture: EPA)\n\nWill there be a General Election?\n\nAll the main party leaders have said they want one but they wanted to make sure Mr Johnson would not carry out a no-deal Brexit on October 31.\n\nThe opposition has insisted it wants to ensure a Brexit extension before agreeing to a poll.\n\nShadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer has said that a snap election would be \u2018inevitable\u2019 if EU withdrawal is delayed.\n\nMr Corbyn has said they have to be \u2018absolutely clear\u2019 that there will be an extension and no crashing out of the EU.\n\nHow could the Government call an election?\n\nThe Government could table a motion under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, but this would require a two thirds majority.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOr, they could table a one-line Bill.\n\nIf opposition MPs refuse to back any Government moves to force an election, Mr Johnson may make the extraordinary decision to trigger a confidence motion in his own administration.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nWill the UK leave the EU on October 31?\n\nThe Prime Minister has pledged to take Britain out of the EU by the Halloween deadline \u2018do or die\u2019.\n\nHe told MPs on Tuesday night that he would consult with other EU leaders on what should happen next.\n\nAs it stands, it looks unlikely that Brexit will happen on Mr Johnson\u2019s preferred date.", "description": "The Prime Minister has vowed to push for an election if EU leaders sanction a Brexit extension of up to three months.
