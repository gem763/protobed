But the company apparently has some other products to announce, too, including its newest Chromebook: a 13.3-inch, 4K new Pixelbook, according to 9to5Google.\n\nThe Chromebook, officially to be called the Pixelbook Go, is said to harken closer to Google\u2019s original Chromebook Pixel from 2013, with a simple clamshell design, as opposed to the transforming 2-in-1 design of the Pixelbook or the tablet-style Pixel Slate.\n\nFall hardware season continues\n\nThe Pixelbook Go has apparently been in development for a while, with Google confirming that it had future Chromebooks in the works back in April, along with FCC filings for the product hitting in July. Pictures of the device have also recently leaked out in the past few weeks, showing off a design with more rounded corners than the usually angular design Google has opted for with its past Chromebooks.\n\n9to5Google\u2019s report also sheds light on the specs for the Pixelbook Go: it\u2019ll have a 16:9, 13.3-inch touchscreen with options for either an FHD or 4K panel. That\u2019s a big change for Google, which has used 3:2 aspect ratio displays on its previous Chromebooks to better display webpages and documents. Internal hardware will have a wide variety of configurations to choose from, with Intel Core m3, i5, and i7 processors; 8GB or 16GB of RAM; and 64GB, 128GB, or 256GB of storage.\n\nAs for ports, the Pixelbook Go will have USB-C ports (one on each side) and a 3.5mm headphone jack. The laptop itself is said to feature a magnesium alloy body, which apparently makes it as light or lighter than the original Pixelbook.\n\nThere\u2019s no word yet on price or release date, but we\u2019ll likely find those out soon when Google officially announces the Pixelbook Go at its October 15th event. The Verge has reached out to Google for comment and will update this post if we hear back.", "description": "The Pixelbook Go is a straight laptop, not a 2-in-1", "authors": ["Chaim Gartenberg", "Sep"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g05g08yIsufoXeXcBnXMIlUvxwg=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9379057/jbareham_170921_2006_0438.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
