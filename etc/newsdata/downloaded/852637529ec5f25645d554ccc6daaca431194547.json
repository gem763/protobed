How long you\u2019re on it is a whole different matter, but I would have no choice but to take it up based on a Senate rule on impeachment.\u201d\n\nEven before the House began work on impeachment, speculation surfaced that McConnell could simply stall the process when and if it reached the Senate, possibly using the same rationale that he used to bury President Obama\u2019s nomination of Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court in 2016: that with a new election looming, the voters should have a \u201cvoice\u201d in the process. The Senate majority leader, who exercises virtually unchallenged power to determine what comes to the floor for a vote, has also been unilaterally holding up consideration of hundreds of bills passed by the House this year, including a widely supported measure on background checks for gun purchasers.\n\nThe Constitution gives the Senate the power to try the president if he is impeached by the House, but it does not set a timetable for the process.\n\nBut McConnell said he was prepared to see a trial \u2014 which would require 67 votes for conviction and removal from office \u2014 play out, and the Senate staff memo backs that position. \u201cThere is no way we could somehow bar the doors and prevent the managers from presenting the articles to the Senate,\u201d stated the memo. \u201cThe rules of impeachment are clear on this point.\u201d\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell at the Capitol in August.

If the House were to act, the Senate immediately goes into a trial.\u201d\n\nMcConnell\u2019s political interests appear to be complicated. If the president survives a Senate trial, he could claim vindication in his reelection campaign. But the removal vote is seen as dangerous for some Republican senators up for reelection in 2020 in states where Trump is less popular, including Susan Collins of Maine, Cory Gardner of Colorado, Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Martha McSally of Arizona.\n\n\u201cVoters are going to see this as a stinking fish. I don\u2019t think voters are going to want their member of Congress or Senate to be up here defending the president\u2019s actions,\u201d Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., told Politico. \u201cIt\u2019ll be interesting to see what happens when Republicans come back from this [October] recess.\u201d\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the formal impeachment inquiry into Trump last Tuesday after the White House released a memo of Trump\u2019s conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Following the decision was the release of an anonymous whistleblower complaint against the president over his repeated attempts to enlist Ukrainian officials to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, and allegedly withholding almost $400 million in military aid from Ukraine as leverage. Depositions and hearings on the matter are already scheduled for this week.\n\n_____\n\nDownload the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:", "description": "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Monday that if the House impeaches President Trump he will \u201chave no choice\u201d but to hold a trial in the Senate and a vote on removing the president from office.", "authors": ["Christopher Wilson", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/4O1shhRJJysCJ52RcZCQwg--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/bb80b3b0-e39f-11e9-bfff-357cac9a7608", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
