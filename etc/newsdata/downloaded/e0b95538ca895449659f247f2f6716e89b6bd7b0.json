The idea, known as \"march-in rights,\" would allow the government to \"march in\" and break a patent to allow a cheaper version of a drug to be made by another company.\n\nThe move has long been controversial and the authority to use it has never been invoked before. But Democratic presidential candidates are increasingly embracing the idea and touting it as a concrete action they could take if they win the White House, given that it does not require congressional action.\n\nCandidates have also touted the idea as a way to one-up President Trump Donald John TrumpPelosi hits back at Trump over letter: 'Only the latest attempt to cover up his betrayal of our democracy' Trump directed Perry, State Dept. officials to talk to Giuliani on Ukraine: report Murkowski warns against rushing to conclusions on Trump impeachment MORE on drug prices, an issue which is a top priority for voters. While Trump has railed against high drug prices and proposed some steps to address the issue, he has yet to oversee any major action that has gone on to lower prices.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBreaking drug patents to lower prices gained new attention on Monday, when South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg Peter (Pete) Paul ButtigiegSmall-dollar donors reshape Democratic race Fifth DNC debate to be held Nov. 20 in Georgia Warren, Biden running neck and neck in Democratic primary: poll MORE, a Democratic contender, included it in his campaign proposal on drug prices.\n\nSens.

America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, the insurance industry trade group, called for using similar authority, known as Section 1498, in a letter to the Trump administration last year.\n\n\u201cNobody has used it for this purpose, but we now are seeing multiple presidential candidates saying they now will invoke this authority,\u201d said Maura Calsyn, a health policy expert at the Center for American Progress, a think tank aligned with mainstream Democrats and that supports using march-in rights to lower drug prices.\n\nCalsyn said the idea from the Democratic side stands in contrast to Trump\u2019s moves.\n\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t heard anything about this in all of their talk about lowering drug prices, which they haven\u2019t done,\u201d she said.", "description": "Democratic presidential candidates are threatening to take a drastic step that even the Obama administration rejected to lower drug prices without congressional approval.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/meds_money.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
