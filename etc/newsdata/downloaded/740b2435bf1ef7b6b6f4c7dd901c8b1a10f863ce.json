This could see prices for new customers increasing as they offset fairer premiums for renewing customers,\u201d Wright said.", "description": "The cost of a comprehensive motor insurance policy in Britain fell 1% in the third quarter, pushed down by uncertainty from the personal injury discount rate change in July and the market watchdog's interim report on general insurance pricing practices, a survey showed.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
