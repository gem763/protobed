The two men were arrested and charged last week with violating campaign finance law connected to hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations to US political campaigns.\n\nThe indictment accuses Parnas and Fruman of trying to conceal the source of the payments and funneling foreign money into domestic politics. One of the people they contributed to, prosecutors said, is a former Republican congressman who was part of a lobbying campaign to oust Marie Yovanovitch, who served at the time as the US ambassador to Ukraine.\n\nIn addition to examining Giuliani's finances, The Journal reported that federal prosecutors have interviewed witnesses about the former New York mayor since at least August about his potential role in the alleged conspiracy involving Parnas and Fruman.\n\nRead more: FBI officials were 'rattled' and 'blindsided' by Trump's call for Ukraine to manufacture dirt on Joe Biden\n\nGiuliani told The Journal he hadn't done anything wrong and had not been informed of any investigation, adding, \"They can look at my Ukraine business all they want.\"\n\nGiuliani has represented Trump since last spring. He is a key player in efforts to urge the Ukrainian government to dig up dirt on former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, related to the latter's work for the Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma Holdings.", "description": "Prosecutors are reportedly examining Giuliani's role in pushing for the ouster of the US's former ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch.", "authors": ["Sonam Sheth"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5c4816542bdd7f4d5825d6c2?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
