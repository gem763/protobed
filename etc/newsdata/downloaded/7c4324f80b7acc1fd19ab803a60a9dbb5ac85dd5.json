It also suggests avoiding sending four or five messages if one will be enough to get your message across.\n\n\u201cOn a group chat, sending several messages at a time looks domineering, and can be confusing for other members playing catch-up on the conversation,\u201d the guide adds. \u201cAnd if someone leaves their phone unattended for a few minutes only to return to 27 new messages, it\u2019s hard to resist checking what all the excitement is about.\u201d\n\nThe guide also takes umbrage with gossip, urging readers to \u201crefrain from broadcasting other people\u2019s private information on a group chat\u201d because this might make the people you\u2019re talking about feel \u201cexposed and embarrassed\u201d.\n\nIn a tip that might be useful to those in the initial stages of dating and perhaps are communicating on an app, the guide suggests replying promptly to messages where possible. Or, if you\u2019re too busy to respond, ensure you have push notifications turned on so can read the message without letting the other person know it has been seen.\n\n\u201cAnd unless a message is urgent, wait at least a day before chasing someone for a reply,\u201d it adds. \u201cBugging someone for a response after only a few hours is inconsiderate and puts the other person on the defensive.\u201d\n\nUnsurprisingly, the guide does not advocate ghosting. Instead, it suggests ending an interaction with a \u201cbrief, polite explanation\u201d, suggesting giving the person a phone call if you have been dating them.\n\nYou can read more tips from Debrett\u2019s on the \u201ccorrect\u201d way to message someone here.", "description": "You might think that in 2019, etiquette is a lost art \u2013 does it really matter what type of spoon you use to eat your dessert?
