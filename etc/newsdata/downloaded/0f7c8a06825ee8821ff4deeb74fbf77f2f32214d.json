That is not right.\"\n\nA pro-democracy protester at one Lennon Wall who only gave his name as Wong defended the use of violence.\n\n\"We know that they will not listen if we rally in peace because we are not on the same level,\" he said.\n\nSome Lennon Walls were torn down by pro-Beijing activists last weekend. The large mosaics of Post-it notes calling for democracy have cropped up in underpasses, outside shopping centres, at bus stops and universities and outside the Legislative Council.\n\nThe anti-government protesters are angry about what they see as creeping Chinese interference in Hong Kong, which returned to China in 1997 under a \"one country, two systems\" formula guaranteeing freedoms that are not enjoyed on the mainland.\n\nChina dismisses the accusation. It has accused foreign governments, including the United States and Britain, of fanning anti-China sentiment.", "description": "Hong Kong protesters were rebuilding \"Lennon Walls\" of anti-government graffiti on Saturday as they marked the fifth anniversary of the \"Umbrella\" pro-democracy movement that gridlocked the territory for weeks.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106154032-1569666575203gettyimages-1171584772.jpeg?v=1569666719", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
