There was an outright split between the folks in Rachel and the event's original planners.\n\nThe latter group posted the following statement on its website:\n\n\"Due to the lack of infrastructure, planning, and risk management, along with concerns raised for the safety of the expected 10,000+ attendees, we decided to transition Alienstock away from the Rachel festival towards a safer alternative.\n\nWe are officially disconnecting from the Little A'LE'INN, Rachel NV, and AlienStock's affiliation with them. We will no longer offer our logo, social media, website or Matty Roberts likeness or scheduled appearance. In short, the relationship has ended permanently.\n\nAlienStock will be moving to a safe, clean secure area in Downtown Las Vegas as an alternative.\n\nWe are not interested in, nor will we tolerate any involvement in a FYREFEST 2.0. We foresee a possible humanitarian disaster in the works, and we can't participate in any capacity at this point.\n\nAlienStock is a brand that stands for unity and concern for like minded people. It's grown into much more than a location. It's a phenomenon that can only promise absolute safety and peace, and we need to move the Festival to guarantee that.\"\n\nYikes.", "description": "It started off as a Facebook joke, and has since spiraled into something much bigger than anyone anticipated.", "authors": ["Ben Gilbert"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d39cf08100a241d9d3087a4-1334-667.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
