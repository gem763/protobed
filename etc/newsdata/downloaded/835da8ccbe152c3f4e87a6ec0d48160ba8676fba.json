Halpert told reporters that since the mid-1990's government-issued temperature outlooks are generally 30 to 35 percent more accurate on temperature than random guesses.\n\nForecasters are confident, however, that the weather will be warmer and wetter in Alaska and Hawaii, according to Halpert.\n\nThere is also a \"modest\" probability for a warmer winter in large parts of the U.S., from the West across the South to the East Coast.\n\n\"The Northern Plains, Upper Mississippi Valley, and the western Great Lakes have equal chances for below-, near- or above-average temperatures,\" according to forecasters.\n\nDALLAS STARS' TYLER SEGUIN LOSES HOME IN TORNADO, SAYS IT'S AN 'EXTREMELY SAD SIGHT TO SEE'\n\nIn terms of precipitation, wetter-than-average conditions are likely in Alaska and Hawaii, in addition to parts of the Northern Plains, Upper Mississippi Valley, the Great Lakes and parts of the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast.\n\n\"Drier-than-average conditions are most likely for Louisiana, parts of Texas, Mississippi, Arkansas and Oklahoma as well areas of northern and central California,\" according to NOAA.\n\nA \"bomb cyclone\" over the spring helped usher in significant and historic flooding across the central U.S. that impacted nearly 17 million people. But by summer and early fall, drought developed across much of the South, affecting 20 percent of the country.\n\n\"Abnormally dry conditions are present across much of the Southern U.S., with areas of the most severe drought in the Four Corners region of the Southwest, central Texas and parts of the Southeast,\" according to forecasters. \"Drought is expected to improve in portions of the Southeast, Mid-Atlantic, Alaska, and Hawaii, while persisting in central Texas and the Southwest.\"\n\nNOAA stresses that seasonal outlooks do not include seasonal snowfall amounts as those are generally not predictable more than a week in advance.\n\n\"Even during a warmer-than-average winter, periods of cold temperatures and snowfall are expected,\" the agency states.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAccuWeather has said in its own winter forecast that an active weather pattern will take hold in the Northeast, with stormy conditions as the Southeast sees more rain. The Pacific Northwest will stay mild, while Arctic cold will make a return mid-winter across the Midwest.\n\nThe Farmers' Almanac, which says it bases its long-range forecast \"on a mathematical and astronomical formula developed in 1818,\" has said \"bitterly cold winter conditions\" will be in place from areas east of the Rockies all the way to the Appalachians, with the coldest outbreak of the season arriving during the final week of January and lasting through the beginning of February.\n\nThe Farmer's Almanac said that this upcoming winter will be \"filled with so many ups and downs on the thermometer, it may remind you of a 'Polar Coaster.'\"", "description": "This upcoming winter may be warmer overall, but government forecasters are advising that there may be some \"large swings\" due to volatile weather\u00a0patterns.", "authors": ["Travis Fedschun", "Travis Fedschun Is A Reporter For Foxnews.Com.
