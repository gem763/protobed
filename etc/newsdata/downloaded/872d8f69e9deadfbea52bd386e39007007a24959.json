They were the better team today.\n\n'Like I said before, I don't know what to say. We've got to keep trying, keep fighting and keep improving.\n\n'It\u2019s a hard moment for us but we\u2019re United, we\u2019ve got to keep fighting'.\n\nThe result puts more pressure on United who are now 15 points behind league leaders Liverpool after eight games and just two above the relegation zone.\n\nThe club are also struggling to score goals having not found the net in their last two games.\n\nDavid De Gea criticised his team for the manner in how they conceded their goal\n\nDe Gea said: 'It\u2019s probably the most difficult time since I\u2019ve been here. We can\u2019t even score just one goal in two games.\n\n'Sorry to the fans. We will keep fighting for sure, we will come back.\n\n'I think we defend quite well. It\u2019s true that they had good chances to score but we conceded the goal from our own corner so that cannot happen. It\u2019s not acceptable \u2013 not just this game, the whole season.'", "description": "David De Gea has apologised to Manchester United supporters following their latest setback after a 1-0 defeat to Newcastle United.
