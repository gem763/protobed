The deadline for leaving is the end of this month.\n\n\u201cWe have now entered the final, most intensive stage\u201d of preparations, according to a government official. \u201cWith less than two weeks until 31 October, hundreds of civil servants will from today move to work on these operational matters.\u201d\n\nJohnson\u2019s plan to win approval of his newly minted deal with the EU was set back when the House of Commons, in a rare Saturday meeting, voted 322-306 in favor of an amendment that required him to ask the EU for the delay. Bound by a law he opposed, Johnson formally asked the EU to delay Brexit until Jan. 31. But he made clear that he\u2019d rather Britain leave without delay and refused to sign the letter requesting an extension to his Oct. 31 target.\n\nJohnson\u2019s reverse knocked the pound in early Asian trading, though any weakness may be short lived, analysts at Credit Agricole and Natwest Markets wrote in research notes. Even though political uncertainty remains, both banks see a diminishing risk of the U.K. crashing out of the bloc without a deal, with Credit Agricole predicting the pound reaching $1.36 and Natwest forecasting $1.35.\n\nThe Times of London on Sunday, citing unnamed diplomatic sources, said the EU is ready to grant a three-month extension if Parliament fails to approve the deal, with the U.K. able to leave on the 1st or 15th of November, December or January if an accord is ratified. If Johnson calls a second referendum, or meets other obstacles, governments led by Germany would push for a longer extension, possibly pushing the deadline to June 2020, the Times said.\n\nGove\u2019s Warning\n\nOne of the leading members of Johnson\u2019s cabinet warned lawmakers on Sunday the country could crash out on Oct. 31 if Parliament rejectsJohnson\u2019s Brexit deal.\n\nMichael Gove said he was confident the prime minister had enough support in Parliament to get the agreement over the line as he warned that lawmakers had increased the risk of a no-deal Brexit by forcing Johnson to ask the EU for a delay. A vote on the plan could come as soon as this week.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t back this deal, then the risk is that the European Council may not grant an extension,\u201d Gove, who is in charge of no-deal Brexit preparations, told Sky TV\u2019s \u201cSophy Ridge on Sunday\u201d show. \u201cWe can\u2019t bet on that. It\u2019s not a sure thing.\u201d\n\nHours after the Saturday vote, French President Emmanuel Macron made it clear the deal had been negotiated and that further delay in Britain\u2019s departure was \u201cin no one\u2019s interest.\u201d However, Finnish Prime Minister Antti Rinne said Sunday that it would be \u201csensible\u201d to grant an extension. A unanimous agreement among EU nations is needed to approve a delay.\n\nJohnson now plans to push through the legislation needed to take Britain out of the EU at the end of the month, and the slender margin of Saturday\u2019s vote suggests he could succeed.\n\nTimetable\n\nThe Withdrawal Agreement Bill could begin its journey as soon as Tuesday, after Johnson makes another attempt on Monday to get Parliament to sign off on the principle of his deal. If a vote is permitted tomorrow and Johnson wins, he could withdraw the request for an extension.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to deliver by the 31st of October,\u201d Gove said. \u201cWe are going to ensure that we get this deal done and I\u2019m confident that with the support of good people with whom we may have disagreed in the past, but who respect democracy, we will get this deal done.\u201d\n\nForeign Secretary Dominic Raab also expressed optimism, telling BBC TV\u2019s \u201cAndrew Marr\u201d show that \u201cwe appear to have the numbers to get this through.\u201d\n\nJohnson received a boost earlier Sunday when former cabinet minister Amber Rudd, who walked out of the government and the Tory party in protest at the expulsion of 21 colleagues, said she and many among those kicked out are ready to support his deal.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Sign up to our\u00a0Brexit\u00a0Bulletin, follow us @Brexit\u00a0and\u00a0subscribe to our podcast.The U.K. accelerated its preparations to leave the European Union without an agreement on Oct. 31 as the bloc was reportedly poised to give Prime Minister Boris Johnson more time, if he needs it, to work out", "authors": ["Andrew Atkinson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/9JpoldxN2NDsqQK4dloulg--~B/aD0xMzMzO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/8d34c862c9048da89161776f1ec5935b", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
