Her phone regularly buzzed with calls from lawmakers and other top officials seeking to get through to the president.\n\nThe White House did not initially respond to requests for comment about Ms Westerhout's ouster, leaving her abrupt departure shrouded in mystery for hours. Mr Trump, who praised Ms Westerhout as \"a good person,\" did not specify what information Ms Westerhout divulged about his family.\n\nThe New York Times reported Thursday that Ms Westerhout had been forced out after Mr Trump learned of her comments in the off-the-record dinner with reporters, which took place earlier this month in New Jersey.\n\nPolitico reported Friday that Ms Westerhout had made comments bragging about having a better relationship with Mr Trump than the president's own daughters, Ivanka and Tiffany.\n\nPolitico also reported that Ms Westerhout said Mr Trump did not want to be seen in pictures with Tiffany because of her weight.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

That law bars federal employees from engaging in politics during work.\n\nA former aide for the Republican National Committee, Ms Westerhout also worked on presidential candidate Mitt Romney's 2012 campaign.\n\nShe quickly became a fixture in Mr Trump's inner circle, serving as personal assistant and gatekeeper for the president.\n\nMr Trump told The Washington Post's Bob Woodward last year that Ms Westerhout was the person to contact in order to directly reach him at the White House.\n\n\"Madeleine is the key,\" Mr Trump said. \"She's the secret.\"\n\nThe Washington Post", "description": "Donald Trump said he dismissed his personal assistant, Madeleine Westerhout, after she divulged personal information about the Trump family during an off-the-record dinner with reporters. \"I think it was automatic,\" Mr\u00a0Trump told reporters Friday of Ms Westerhout's departure. \"I don't say 'fire' or 'not fire.'
