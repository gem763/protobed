Nonetheless, he added, the vast majority of North Koreans \"are now engaged in such market activity for their survival\".\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in North Korea Tomas Ojea Quintana says he has seen no improvement in North Korea in the three years he has been the special rapporteur [File: Denis Balibouse/Reuters]\n\nPrison camps\n\nIronically, he said, the government's failure to regulate nascent market activity was creating increasing inequality based on wealth, \"where only those with money have access to basic rights such as education, healthcare, freedom of movement and adequate housing\".\n\nQuintana said severe restrictions on basic freedoms remained widespread, and there was surveillance and close monitoring of civilians.\n\n\"North Korean people continue to live in the entrenched fear of being sent to a political prison camp,\" called a kwanliso, he said.\n\n\"If you are considered to be a spy of the hostile countries or a traitor, when in reality you are simply exercising your basic human rights, you can be suddenly taken by agents of the Ministry of State Security to a kwanliso and never be seen again,\" Quintana said.\n\n\"Suspects' families are never informed of the decisions or of the whereabouts of their relatives.\"\n\nOn the issue of North Koreans who have fled to China, Quintana said in the past six months he has received information from family members living in South Korea of an increasing number of these escapees being detained in China.\n\nHe said any North Korean who escapes should not be forcibly returned because there are substantial grounds to believe they would be tortured or subjected to other human rights violations.\n\n\"I appreciate the government of China's increased engagement with me on this concern, and I hope that this will lead to greater compliance with international standards,\" he said.\n\nQuintana said North Korea has accepted 132 recommendations from other UN member states, including one \"to grant immediate, free and unimpeded access to international humanitarian organisations to provide assistance to the most vulnerable groups, including prisoners.\"\n\nHe said this could lead to the first international access to places of detention, \"and could, therefore, be an opportunity to improve prison conditions.\"", "description": "Tomas Ojea Quintana says government policies creating 'alarming level' of food insecurity in reclusive state.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/23/a5609f84799a46d98b80e114a0c1fd21_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
