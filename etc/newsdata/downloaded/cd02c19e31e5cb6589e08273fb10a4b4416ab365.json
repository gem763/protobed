They see the culture changing around them, and they fear that their beliefs will soon be marginalized as a form of bigotry. Others think these fears are overblown and say Christians should stop complaining about imaginary persecution.\n\nIn his new book Free to Believe, religious freedom attorney Luke Goodrich challenges both sides of this debate, offering a fresh perspective on the most controversial religious freedom conflicts today. With keen insights on conflicts over abortion, sexual orientation, gender identity, Islam, and the public square, Goodrich argues that threats to religious freedom are real \u2013 but they might not be quite what you think.\n\nJoin us for a refreshing conversation on why religious freedom matters, how it is threatened, and how to protect it.\n\nSign up to receive invitations to all public events.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.heritage.org/sites/default/files/styles/facebook_optimized/public/images/2019-10/GettyImages-951870822.jpg?itok=KZU7p8iB", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
