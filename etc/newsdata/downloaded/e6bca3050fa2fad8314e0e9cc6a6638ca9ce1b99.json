Years later, Cameron also found himself heading down a path of self-destruction.\n\nThe son of Michael Douglas and grandson of Kirk Douglas has penned a memoir titled \u201cLong Way Home,\u201d which details his personal struggles and recovery.\n\n\u201cThe ups and downs of drug addiction are entirely predictable\u2026 There\u2019s a comfort in that,\u201d the 40-year-old wrote in his book, which was excerpted by People magazine.\n\nMICHAEL DOUGLAS THOUGHT HE WAS 'GOING TO LOSE' SON CAMERON TO DRUG ADDICTION\n\nMICHAEL DOUGLAS DISHES ON HIS ADVICE TO DAUGHTER CARYS AS SHE STARTS DATING: 'WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU'RE FRIENDS?\u2019\n\n\u201c[Drugs] were, for me, a path out of loneliness,\u201d added Douglas.\n\nAccording to the outlet, Cameron Douglas started drinking and smoking marijuana as a teenager before he developed a full-blown addiction to cocaine and heroin.\n\nDouglas shared that growing up as an only child to a very young mother and a famous father, who was often away, became increasingly difficult.\n\n\u201cI was maybe trying to make sense of things ... and trying to figure out where I fit in,\u201d Douglas told People. \u201cThen there were the awkward [teen] years and for whatever reason, I started drifting towards kids who were smoking, drinking and [other] things and I tied that in with friendship ... and then it just kept going from there.\u201d\n\nMICHAEL DOUGLAS ON THE COLLEGE ADMISSIONS SCANDAL: 'IT\u2019S JUST EGREGIOUS'\n\nMICHAEL DOUGLAS AND CATHERINE ZETA-JONES CELEBRATE EXACTLY 25-YEAR AGE DIFFERENCE\n\nBy his 20s, Douglas was dealing methamphetamine to support his habit, the outlet revealed. Douglas\u2019 addiction became so severe he was using cocaine daily and endured drug-induced seizures\n\n\u201cI hated the wreckage I saw in my life because of drugs, but I just couldn\u2019t stop,\u201d explained Douglas. \u201cIt\u2019s the sneaky power, the stranglehold that addiction has when you\u2019re in the throes of it,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you get that far down the rabbit hole, there are a couple options: there\u2019s prison and then there\u2019s death.\u201d\n\nIn 2009, a DEA sting operation landed Douglas behind bars and he received a five-year prison term for conspiracy to distribute meth and cocaine. His sentence was extended by another five years after he was found with drugs while incarcerated.\n\n\u201cSomething inside of me broke,\u201d he said.\n\nCATHERINE ZETA-JONES \u2018DEVASTATED\u2019 BY SEXUAL HARASSMENT ALLEGATIONS MADE AGAINST MICHAEL DOUGLAS\n\nKIRK DOUGLAS, 102, POSES FOR FAMILY PHOTO FEATURING FOUR GENERATIONS: \u2018FAMILY FIRST\u2019\n\nIt was during his time in prison that Douglas finally got sober and began thinking about his future\n\n\u201cFor a long time I quite honestly thought I just wasn\u2019t put together properly, that I didn\u2019t have the characteristics necessary for real success in life,\u201d said Douglas. \u201cI know now that was the addiction talking.\u201d\n\nDouglas spent nearly eight years in prison before being released in 2016.\n\nToday, Douglas is a proud father to daughter Lua, 1, whom he shares with longtime girlfriend Viviane Thiebes, 41.

Now, he hopes his story will inspire other addicts to \u201cseek help \u2014 and maybe save a life.\u201d\n\nMichael, 75, previously admitted to People that he and Douglas\u2019 mother, model and producer Diandra Luker, 63, believed their son would ultimately succumb to his demons.\n\n\u201cThere were moments when hope dwindled ... and then it\u2019s just a train out of the station,\u201d Michael confessed. \u201cLife became a series of crises. I thought I was going to lose him.\u201d\n\nFox News' Jessica Napoli contributed to this report.", "description": "Cameron Douglas is all too familiar with addiction.", "authors": ["Stephanie Nolasco"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/douglas.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
