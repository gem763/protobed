The bad news didn\u2019t stop there: same-store sales dropped 12%.\n\nAt least GameStop\u2019s management seem to know they have a problem.\n\n\u201cWe are committed to acting with a sense of urgency to address the areas of the business that are critical to achieving long-term success and value creation for all our stakeholders,\u201d George Sherman, GameStop\u2019s chief executive officer, said in a news release with the earnings report. \u201cWe will set GameStop on the correct strategic path and fully leverage our unique position and brand in the video game industry.\u201d\n\nIn July, Barron\u2019s Jack Hough included GameStop in his list of retail stocks that were cheap for a reason. One reason: Worries that digital downloads could hurt GameStop\u2019s used-disc business.\n\nThat may be happening. \u201cAt first glance, GameStop\u2019s F2Q 2019 results were much worse than consensus expectations and provide further evidence the new management team has a difficult task ahead as it attempts to turn the company around in our opinion,\u201d writes Loop Capital Markets\u2019 Anthony Chukumba. \u201cWe were particularly discouraged by the continued weakness in pre-owned and value video game products sales (which dropped by a high-teens percentage despite a YoY gross margin decline) and management\u2019s worse-than-expected F2019 diluted EPS guidance.\u201d\n\nGameStop stock has dropped 15% to $4.31 at 4:37 p.m. in after-hours trading. It gained 6.9% in regular trading hours Tuesday.\n\nWrite to Ben Levisohn at Ben.Levisohn@barrons.com", "description": "GameStop reported a loss of 32 cents a share, missing forecasts for an 18 cents share, according to FactSet, on sales of $1.29 billion, below estimates for $1.34 billion.
