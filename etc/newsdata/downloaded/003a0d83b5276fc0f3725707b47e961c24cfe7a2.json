So did our man in Biarritz.\n\nBIARRITZ, France \u2014 If Boris Johnson can swim out to sea and then spin a Brexit yarn out of it, then \"you can too.\"\n\nThose were the not necessarily wise words of a lifeguard on the beach in Biarritz when I asked him if I could swim out to a large rock that the British prime minister had brought to international attention during the G7.\n\nJohnson took a swim in the Atlantic on Sunday, and claimed he had found a hidden hole in the rock. \"Let me give you a metaphor. I swam round that rock this morning,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cFrom here you cannot tell there is a gigantic hole in that rock. There is a way through.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy point to the EU is that there is a way through, but you can't find the way through if you just sit on the beach,\u201d he said.\n\nThe problem with that story is that you can see the hole in the rock \u2014 called the Roche Ronde \u2014 quite clearly from the beach. You can even see it in Johnson's own press photo.\n\nSo was Johnson telling porkies again? Or is there really something else on that rock?\n\nAs soon as the Biarritz beach was open to the public again after the summit, I decided to find out.\n\nRed flags and warning signs at the beach told me not to go in the water, and locals said it is dangerous to swim to the rock because of underwater currents. But to my great surprise, a lifeguard was open to the idea. After briefly chatting with him about Johnson and Brexit, he said I could enter the water, saying: \"If he can do it, you can too.\"\n\nAfter a few minutes I reached the rock. It's very steep at the front but accessible from the back. And yes, there's a big hole right in the middle that you can swim through.\n\nI swam into the hole and searched for a clue to Johnson having been there. Initials carved in the rock, a message in a bottle? Sadly, nothing.\n\nBut just as I was about to give up, I spotted a warning sign \u2014 written red on white \u2014 on the front side of the rock, warning swimmers not to climb on the rock and jump into the water.\n\nMaybe that's the lesson Johnson learned from his swimming adventure: Don't jump from the cliff edge.", "description": "The UK PM swam out to a rock off the French coast.
