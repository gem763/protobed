Their fans, too, have faced government wrath. In 2017, seven concertgoers were detained by police in Egypt for waving rainbow flags, charged with \"promoting sexual deviancy.\"\n\nThey were was scheduled to perform at Lebanon's Byblos International Festival this summer, but their set was cancelled \"to prevent bloodshed and preserve security,\" organizers said.\n\nIn the months leading up to the event, religious groups launched a campaign against the band, calling their music a \"danger to society.\"\n\nYo Yo Ma played Tayf by Mashrou' Leila (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/mashrou3leila?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@mashrou3leila</a>) in his concert in Jbeil. I am speechless and moved.<br>Music is universal, no one can ever change that.<br>You can stop the original artists from playing, but you can't stop their music from spreading.<br>Here is Yo Yo Ma's rendition <a href=\"https://t.co/7H6g5Tiw9V\">pic.twitter.com/7H6g5Tiw9V</a> \u2014@BlueCoffee__\n\nBut the festival still earned them international headlines after legendary cellist Yo-Yo Ma performed their song Tayf (Ghost).\n\nSo for Sinno, the Ma tribute \u2014 which ended with the cellist thrusting his fist in the air \u2014 was a bittersweet moment of solidarity.\n\n\"It's amazing that we still live in a world where artists can have each other's backs that way. [But] on the other hand it was just very sad for me that it had to happen ... on our 'home turf,'\" he said.\n\nClimate, refugee activism\n\nThough Sinno is one of the few visibly gay celebrities in Arab media, he's quick to note the band's music is hardly focused on any one political impulse.\n\nCalvary, the first single from their latest album The Beirut School, takes on the Israel-Palestine conflict.\n\nThe song, and its accompanying video, centre around the \"energized idealism\" of youth facing conflict only to be \"defeated\" by political fatigue, according to a description on the band's YouTube channel.\n\n\"Calvary explicitly has a little bit of a song that we wrote after the incident in Egypt, as a direct reaction to that,\" Sinno told Paper Magazine in an interview.\n\nThe band has also tackled climate change in a recording from a raft in the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nIn partnership with Greenpeace, Mashrou' Leila performed their song Bahr floating alongside the environmental group's sail boat Rainbow Warrior ahead of 2016 climate talks in Morocco.\n\n\"We changed the lyrics to the song so that they would be directly about, basically, how necessary it is to try and use solar power as a resource, especially in places like the Middle East and the Arab world,\" Sinno said.\n\nIn another recording from the same partnership, the group pays tribute to those lost at sea in memory of migrants who died while travelling to Europe by raft.\n\n\"This was obviously \u2014 still is \u2014 unfortunately the situation with a lot of refugees that have to go on similar life rafts to try and get to Europe ... to flee political situations that they're confronted with in the Middle East,\" he said.\n\n'We really push ourselves to grow'\n\nThough they may not be well known this far north, Sinno says Canada \u2014 Montreal in particular \u2014 holds a special place in his heart.\n\nOne of the group's early albums was recorded in the city, and Sinno was in a long distance relationship with someone living in the city.\n\n\"So, you know, coming back here always feels like coming back to one of our homes,\" he said.\n\nMashrou' Leila recently released their first song recorded in English, Calvary. (Tarek Moukkadem)\n\nAs Mashrou' Leila celebrates their 10th anniversary, the group is looking to make inroads in the West. Calvary is their first release featuring English lyrics.\n\nNow, with a decade of experimenting with sound and genre, Sinno says the group still has more to do.\n\n\"As musicians, all four of us are not the kind of people that want to find something comfortable and stay there,\" he told Day 6.\n\n\"We really push ourselves to grow as musicians just because we also get bored of doing the same thing.\"\n\nWritten by Jason Vermes.
