Henry purchased the Reds from Tom Hicks and George Gillett for \u00a3300m in October 2010, initially under the guise of New England Sports Ventures.\n\nLiverpool's first match under the new ownership was a 2-0 derby defeat to Everton , their last loss to their Merseyside rivals.\n\nPlenty has been and gone since, including four managers, multiple close title calls and the Champions League victory in June.\n\nUpon their arrival, NESV made a number of key promises to supporters and they have been fulfilled in the nine years that followed, reports the Liverpool Echo.\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\n1. Attracting best players and writing off debt\n\nAfter completing the takeover, the new owners vowed to \"eliminate all of the acquisition debt placed on LFC by its previous owners\".\n\nThey also said they were \"committed to creating a long-term, financially strong foundation for the club and dedicated to ensuring the club has the financial resources to be successful again and attract the best players.\"\n\nAn annual loss of nearly \u00a350m before tax is now \u00a339m profit after tax, while revenue has more than doubled.\n\nOn the pitch, the Reds have smashed their transfer record more than once and bought big-name stars before moving them on for a huge profit.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n2. Turning losses into wins\n\nIn his initial address, John W Henry said: \"\"We regard our role as that of stewards for the club with a primary focus on returning the club to greatness on and off the field for the long-term.\n\n\"We are committed first and foremost to winning. We have a history of winning, and today we want supporters to know that this approach is what we intend to bring to this great club.\"\n\nIt's safe to say Liverpool have turned things around, losing just once in the Premier League last season.\n\nThey've also made the Champions League final in each of the last two seasons and have won every match domestically this term.\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n3. Competing for trophies\n\nJohn W Henry and Tom Werner insisted they shared an objective of \"stabilising the club and ultimately returning Liverpool FC to its rightful place in English and European football, successful and competing for trophies.\"\n\nLiverpool won the League Cup in 2012 and then came close to winning the title in 2014 under Brendan Rodgers.\n\nDisappointments in domestic and European finals followed under Klopp before Liverpool became European champions in June.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n4. Culture of winning\n\nOn the afternoon of the takeover, Henry said: \"We're here to win. We have a tradition of winning. We'll do whatever we need to do.\"\n\nLiverpool have embarked on a stunning winning run to go eight points clear at the top of the Premier League.\n\nManchester City pose a special threat but Liverpool are clear favourites to win their first ever title of the Premier League era.\n\nIt would mark a special ending to FSG's decade on Merseyside, if the title is at Anfield in May.", "description": "John W.
