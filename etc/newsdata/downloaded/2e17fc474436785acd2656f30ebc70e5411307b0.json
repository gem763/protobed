REUTERS/Shamil Zhumatov/File Photo\n\nThe EU, which Turkey still aspires to join, had already condemned the Turkish air and artillery strikes on Kurdish militia in northeast Syria but has been infuriated by President Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s threats to send refugees to Europe.\n\n\u201cThis offensive is going to cause serious humanitarian devastation,\u201d Jean-Yves Le Drian said as he arrived for a meeting with his EU counterparts in Luxembourg.\n\n\u201cFrance expects from this meeting ... a specific demand to end the offensive ... a firm position on arms exports to Turkey and ... that the United States holds a meeting of the international coalition (against Islamic State),\u201d he told reporters.\n\nHis comments came hours before the French soccer team were due to host Turkey for a Euro 2020 qualifying match. There have been calls in France to cancel the match.\n\nGerman Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said the Turkish offensive, which had resulted in an alliance of the Kurds and Syria\u2019s Bashir al-Assad, had turned the things on their head and made matters more difficult.\n\n\u201cWe are also fearing, and we are seeing it already, that this is leading to a strengthening of IS, which we absolutely must prevent,\u201d Maas told reporters, referring to Islamic State.\n\nGermany and France have already suspended arms exports to Turkey and Maas said the European Union needed to united in their calls to Ankara.\n\nThe EU exported some 45 million euros ($50 million) in arms and ammunition to Turkey last year, according to the EU\u2019s statistics office Eurostat, with Italy, Spain, Britain and Germany the main exporters. Data for military aircraft was not immediately available.\n\n\u201cWe do not wish to support this war and do not want to make arms available,\u201d Maas said.\n\n\u201cBut it is important to stay in dialogue with Turkey in order to influence it, but if that does not succeed then we have to have further measures in reserve,\u201d he continued.\n\nSpanish Foreign Minister Josep Borrell said he favoured ending arms sales to Turkey. Asked if was angry with U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw troops from northern Syria, which coincided with the Turkish offensive, Borrell said.\n\n\u201cI am not angry. I\u2019m just taking a rational position, in a very difficult situation in which every EU country will be, I hope, against Turkish actions.\u201d", "description": "European Union foreign ministers must again condemn Turkey's offensive in Syria, call for an arms embargo on Ankara and request that the United States hold a meeting of the coalition against Islamic State, France's foreign minister said on Monday.", "authors": ["Robin Emmott", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191014&t=2&i=1440671460&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9D0PZ", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
