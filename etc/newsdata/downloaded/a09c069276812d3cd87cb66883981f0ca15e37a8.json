He was in his London studio, an airy two-story space lined with sleek models of its creations.\n\n\u201cThe delivery date is in the first half of next year, and that is sooner than it might seem,\u201d Mr. Bannenberg said. \u201cIt\u2019s fine when it\u2019s superficial \u2014 let\u2019s say they liked the plates or towels on their friend\u2019s yacht \u2014 but if you\u2019re not careful it can verge on, \u2018Oh, my friend\u2019s gym was like this, can we have something similar?\u2019 or, \u2018I would really like to add a submersible vessel.\u2019\u201d", "description": "Billionaires won\u2019t stop buying superyachts.
