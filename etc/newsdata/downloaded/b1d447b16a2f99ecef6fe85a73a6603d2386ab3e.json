But this isn\u2019t a normal class, and you\u2019re not just watching the lectures: They\u2019re watching you back. Every time the facial recognition system decides that you look bored, distracted, or tuned out, it makes a note. And after each lecture, it only asks you about content from those moments.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a hypothetical system; it\u2019s a real one deployed by a company called Nestor. And if you don\u2019t like the sound of it, you\u2019re not alone. Neither do the actual students.\n\nWhen I asked the man behind the system, French inventor Marcel Saucet, how the students in these classes feel about being watched, he admitted that they didn\u2019t like it. They felt violated and surveilled, he said, but he shrugged off any implication that it was his fault. \u201cEverybody is doing this,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt\u2019s really early and shocking, but we cannot go against natural laws of evolution.\u201d\n\nAs a reporter who covers technology and the future, I constantly hear variations of this line as technologists attempt to apply the theory Charles Darwin made famous in biology to their own work. I\u2019m told that there is a progression of technology, a movement that is bigger than any individual inventor or CEO. They say they are simply caught in a tide, swept along in a current they cannot fight. They say it inevitably leads them to facial recognition (now even being deployed on children), smart speakers that record your intimate conversations, and doorbells that narc on your neighbors. They say we can\u2019t blame these companies for the erosion of privacy or democracy or trust in public institutions \u2014 that was all going to happen sooner or later.\n\n\u201cWhen have we ever been able to keep the genie in the bottle?\u201d they ask. Besides, they argue, people buy this stuff so they must want it. Companies are simply responding to \u201cnatural selection\u201d by consumers. There is nobody to blame for this, they say. It\u2019s as natural as gravity.\n\nNo natural process is creating a \u201csmart\u201d hairbrush\n\nPerhaps no one states this belief more clearly than inventor and futurist Ray Kurzweil in his 2005 book The Singularity Is Near: \u201cThe ongoing acceleration of technology is the implication and inevitable result of what I call the law of accelerating returns, which describes the acceleration of the pace of and the exponential growth of the products of an evolutionary process.\u201d\n\nIn fact, our world is shaped by humans who make decisions, and technology companies are no different.\n\nTo claim that these devices are the result of some kind of ever-improving natural process not only misunderstands how evolution works, but it also suggests that everything from biological weapons to fraudulent startups like Theranos to Juicero (the $400 machine that squeezed juice out of packets) are necessary and natural.\n\nWhile these \u201cinnovations\u201d range from the dangerous to the silly, they share a common thread: Nothing about them is \u201cnatural.\u201d No natural process is creating a \u201csmart\u201d hairbrush or a \u201csmart\u201d flip flop or a \u201csmart\u201d condom. Or a Bluetooth-enabled toaster, a cryptocurrency from a photography company, or an internet-connected air freshener.\n\nEvolution is a terrible metaphor for technology\n\nTechnologists\u2019 desire to make a parallel to evolution is flawed at its very foundation. Evolution is driven by random mutation \u2014 mistakes, not plans. (And while some inventions may indeed be the result of mishaps, the decision of a company to patent, produce, and market those inventions is not.) Evolution doesn\u2019t have meetings about the market, the environment, the customer base. Evolution doesn\u2019t patent things or do focus groups. Evolution doesn\u2019t spend millions of dollars lobbying Congress to ensure that its plans go unfettered.\n\nIn some situations, even if we can\u2019t literally put a technological genie back in a bottle, we can artificially intervene to make sure the genie plays by specific rules.\n\nEvolution is driven by mistakes, not plans\n\nThere are clear laws about what companies can and can\u2019t do in the realm of biological weapons. The FDA ensures drugs are tested for efficacy and safety before they can be sold. The USDA ensures new food research is done with care. We don\u2019t let anybody frack or drill for oil or build nuclear power plants wherever they like. We don\u2019t let just anybody make and sell cars or airplanes or guns.\n\nSo the assertion that technology companies can\u2019t possibly be shaped or restrained with the public\u2019s interest in mind is to argue that they are fundamentally different from any other industry. They\u2019re not.\n\nThis idea persists in part because Americans cannot resist the allure of \u201cprogress\u201d\n\nIn many ways, the American tech mogul blaming some invisible arc of innovation for his choices is simply an echo of the very ethos that founded America: progress at all costs. The men and women who colonized America largely saw progress as a march, a continual straight path, forward at all times, never to be questioned or slowed. Benjamin Franklin (himself an inventor) once wrote: \u201cThe rapid progress true science now makes occasions my regretting sometimes that I was born so soon. It is impossible to imagine the height to which may be carried, in a thousand years, the power of man over matter.\u201d\n\nSo to suggest a slowing \u2014 or perhaps even (god forbid) a reverse \u2014 seems antithetical to the fabric of America. When former Uber engineer Anthony Levandowski says, \u201cWhat already happened doesn\u2019t really matter. You don\u2019t need to know that history to build on what they made. In technology, all that matters is tomorrow,\u201d he is echoing the sentiments of our nation\u2019s founders.\n\n\u201cThese arguments for corporate supremacy and technological progress are so deeply connected in the American mind,\u201d says Luke Stark, a researcher who studies behavior and computing at Microsoft Research Montreal. \u201cIt\u2019s really tied to the whole American manifest destiny and the broader history of American settler colonialism.\u201d The attitude is that we must march on, forward, westward, no matter what stands in our way. Going back is simply not an option.\n\nEven those afraid of all-seeing corporations argue that instead of pressing pause, we, the consumers, must simply move forward more quickly. \u201cWhat I try to focus on is not to try to stop the march of technological progress,\u201d Yuval Noah Harari, a historian and the author of Sapiens, told Time magazine. \u201cInstead, I try to run faster.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really tied to the whole American manifest destiny\u201d\n\nThis endless, punishing race in the name of \u201cprogress\u201d is often what drives consumer behavior, too. Despite the \u201cAmerican dream\u201d \u2014 security, safety, prosperity \u2014 being more and more out of reach for everyday Americans, the idea that it\u2019s just around the corner drives people to purchase these products.\n\nIf you have the newest app, people think their lives will be easier, you\u2019ll have more free time, more quality time. Commercials promise more backyard barbecues under sparklers and birthday surprise parties facilitated by internet-connected light bulbs.\n\nAnd when we buy the products, tech companies take that as a green light to continue on their \u201cinevitable\u201d path, inching ever toward a world where Amazon knows exactly what you\u2019re doing, thinking, feeling \u2014 perhaps even before you do. \u201cIt\u2019s all a loop,\u201d says Stark. \u201cIt\u2019s weird. That\u2019s what puts people in this bind. They think they should be able to have it all. They can\u2019t, and technology is a kind of prophylactic to cope with this stuff.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the most telling place this kind of loop shows up is in the high-tech baby device market: Bluetooth diapers, internet-connected baby monitors, an anklet that keeps track of your infant\u2019s every move, heartbeat, and temperature fluctuation. In a country with an ever-eroding social safety net, parents are sold these surveillance devices under the guise of care and love, with a healthy dash of paranoia.\n\nAs Stark writes in his paper on consumers who surveil their loved ones, \u201cParents (in particular mothers) have long been reminded by advertisers that their children are at risk \u2014 from external threats, poor nutrition, social exclusion, the mother\u2019s own failures as a parent \u2014 and that their surest route to protecting their children, and ameliorating their (newly provoked) anxiety about these dangers, is consumption.\u201d\n\nBuying this device, even if the details are a bit creepy, shows that you care, that you\u2019re a good parent. And because parents are shamed and nudged into buying these tracking devices, more and more of them pop up on the market. It\u2019s these purchases that technologists equate to \u201cnatural selection,\u201d but it\u2019s nearly impossible for most people to opt out of a lot of these arrangements.\n\nWith great power comes great responsibility\n\nOften consumers don\u2019t have much power of selection at all. Those who run small businesses find it nearly impossible to walk away from Facebook, Instagram, Yelp, Etsy, even Amazon. Employers often mandate that their workers use certain apps or systems like Zoom, Slack, and Google Docs. \u201cIt is only the hyper-privileged who are now saying, \u2018I\u2019m not going to give my kids this,\u2019 or, \u2018I\u2019m not on social media,\u2019\u201d says Rumman Chowdhury, a data scientist at Accenture. \u201cYou actually have to be so comfortable in your privilege that you can opt out of things.\u201d\n\nAnd so we\u2019re left with a tech world claiming to be driven by our desires when those decisions aren\u2019t ones that most consumers feel good about. There\u2019s a growing chasm between how everyday users feel about the technology around them and how companies decide what to make. And yet, these companies say they have our best interests in mind. We can\u2019t go back, they say. We can\u2019t stop the \u201cnatural evolution of technology.\u201d But the \u201cnatural evolution of technology\u201d was never a thing to begin with, and it\u2019s time to question what \u201cprogress\u201d actually means.\n\nRose Eveleth is a writer and producer who explores how humans tangle with science and technology.
