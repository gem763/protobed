Hundreds were wounded and more than 1,000 people were arrested, according to the Ecuadorian Ombudsman.\n\nMoreno had called a national state of emergency only four hours after protests began. While violent protests in the capital Quito also forced the government to move its operations to the coastal city of Guayaquil last week.\n\nLarge areas in the centre of Quito were looked like the aftermath of a battle zone on Monday.\n\nDuring the demononstrations, protesters also blocked roads and occupied six oil wells, stopping production for days. Ecuador's economy lost some $3bn, which was felt in various sectors, including the flower and broccoli industries which declared a state of emergency for their losses.\n\n'I don't trust Moreno'\n\nDespite the return to calm, some protesters weren't happy with Sunday's decision, saying reforms should be called off entirely, rather than a plan to make new ones.\n\n191010193825529\n\n\"I don't trust President Moreno,\" said Pilar, who refused to give her last name for fear of reprisals. She went to the celebrations at El Arbolito, carrying a metal pot and spoon to bang on.\n\n\"I came to say we will not give up!\" she told Al Jazeera, \"We will keep going until we feel content and compliant with the new measures.\"\n\nThe decision to scrap the reforms caught many by surprise. Moreno had been firm throughout the protests that he would not repeal the reform, saying they were necessary to address the country's fiscal deficit, and formed part of an agreement for a $4.2bn loan it received from the International Monetary Fund earlier this year.\n\nPeople pass bricks from hand to hand during a cleanup of the streets in the aftermath of the last days' protests, after the government of Ecuadorian President Lenin Moreno agreed to repeal a decree that ended fuel subsidies [Henry Romero/Reuters]\n\nPolitical analyst Decio Machado said this is a historic moment, as he's never seen this kind of resolution to this kind of conflict before.\n\nBut the president's decision on Sunday also puts the government in a very vulnerable position, Machado said. Many on the far right who agreed with the reforms now view Moreno's flip as a sign of weakness.\n\nMachado said that it was also clear that Moreno's government drastically underestimated the indigenous resistance.\n\n191013074626945\n\n\"The resolution that we came to yesterday could have been made in the third day of the strikes, and this country would have saved a lot of economic and human losses,\" Machado told Al Jazeera.\n\nApart from the reforms, indigenous leaders also demanded that the government take responsibility for the deaths and wounded in last week's protests, and demand that Interior Minister Maria Paula Romo and Minister of Defensce Oswaldo Jarrin resign over their antagonistic positions during the protests. Moreno did not publicly comment on these requests.\n\nMeanwhile, protesters and volunteers partook in a massive clean-up initiative on Monday, removing the debris from roads and parks in the centre of Quito.\n\nPilataxi, with his face covered with soot from the past days of fighting, says he is looking forward to going home, but he's willing to return.\n\n\"If the government doesn't comply, we will come back with more force, and the President knows this,\" Pilataxi said.", "description": "Many celebrate the return of fuel subsidies, but urge caution over plans to come up with new belt-tightening measures.", "authors": ["Kimberley Brown"], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/14/36ae52fe85db472d9ed30f689ce8fd90_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
