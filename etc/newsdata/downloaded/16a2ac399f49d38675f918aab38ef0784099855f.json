The company delivered earnings per share of $3.03 versus the street\u2019s estimate of $2.84 on revenue of $64 billion compared with expectation at $62.99 billion.\n\nThe big story continues to be major growth in Services, iPad and Wearables while iPhone and Mac sales continue to shrink year-over-year.\n\nAs you\u2019ll remember, Apple no longer reports unit sales of its iPhone, Mac and iPad lines, something that is largely the result of declining unit sales and higher average selling prices. Services, Wearables and Other, and iPad saw year-over-year gains, while the iPhone and Mac lines are still seeing revenue slumps.\n\niPhone sales were down 9% year-over-year, to $33.36 billion\n\nServices were up 18% YoY, to $12.5 billion\n\nMac sales were down 5% YoY, to $6.99 billion\n\n\u201cWearables, Home, and Accessories\u201d were up 54% YoY, to $6.52 billion\n\niPad sales were up 17% YoY, to $4.66 billion\n\nThe company is continuing to add to some of its highest-growth businesses. The company announced the release of a new high-end set of AirPods yesterday, which will likely increase average selling prices among its wearables division. The company also has a number of paid services, including Apple TV+, that will be launching soon.", "description": "Apple\u2019s iPhone sales still make up over half of its quarterly revenues, but they are slowly shrinking in importance as other divisions in the company pick up speed.
