Their odds of winning the Senate are only about one in three, however \u2014 meaning that in the event of a Trump loss, conservatives could feel the relief of sweet, sweet gridlock as Congress simply refuses to pass Medicare for All and zillion-dollar handouts to college grads.\n\nBut there is good reason to temper your optimism about such a scenario: Congress has handed over to the executive branch a frighteningly broad ability to make laws by itself. The campaign has given us some previews of this \u2014 Kamala Harris wants to go after guns and Elizabeth Warren would target fracking, whether Congress likes it or not \u2014 though the candidates have mostly been focused on their biggest and most expensive pieces of proposed legislation.\n\nLast week, however, the liberal American Prospect rolled out a series of articles proposing a meaty \u201cDay One Agenda\u201d for the next Democrat in charge of the White House. This president could roll back Trump\u2019s deregulatory efforts, bring backed stalled Obama initiatives, and launch government giveaways and major assaults on business, all without the legislative branch\u2019s help. Read it and weep.\n\nThink it would take a vote in Congress to cancel \u201calmost all\u201d student debt? Think again, says Marcia Brown. Citing a forthcoming law-review article by Luke Herrine, Brown notes a provision of federal law giving the Department of Education the authority to \u201ccompromise, waive, or release\u201d claims against student borrowers. While other actors in the executive branch (the attorney general and the Office of Management and Budget) might have to sign off, the department could in theory use this authority to simply stop collecting student debt.\n\nThink Trump got us out of Obama\u2019s Clean Power Plan for good? You shouldn\u2019t, Ben Adler says. The next president could take us back down that path. And since carbon emissions are far lower today than anyone expected \u2014 thanks to fracking and other technological improvements \u2014 the next president could \u201cgo further and increase the rule\u2019s ambition.\u201d\n\nThink the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is a done deal, so long as Democrats don\u2019t have enough votes in Congress to undermine it? Nope, writes Victor Fleischer. The IRS can\u2019t repeal the law, but it can aggressively reinterpret many of its provisions, not to mention provisions in the rest of our enormous tax code, in ways that affect the taxation of huge sums of money.\n\nThere\u2019s lots more: A Democratic president could go after drug companies by threatening to let generics manufacturers make patented drugs, create \u201cpostal banking\u201d by executive fiat, bring back aggressive antitrust enforcement against the biggest and most successful companies, and make pot \u201ceffectively legal.\u201d\n\nOkay, that last one I\u2019m fine with. But how do we stop the rest?\n\nOne way would have been for Republicans to rein in the executive branch in the two years they controlled Congress, albeit without a filibuster-proof margin in the Senate, but that didn\u2019t happen. Another would be to hold the White House, or at least luck into a moderate Democrat not eager to test the limits of executive power. Once a Democratic president actually starts trying this stuff, though, the issue will fall to the courts. (There\u2019s yet another article about that!)\n\nThe easiest way to argue against an abuse of executive power is to say that the relevant statute passed by Congress doesn\u2019t actually authorize it. Though courts have typically given executive agencies broad deference when it comes to interpreting laws, many conservative judges have shown signs that they want to reverse this trend. Some of the actions outlined above do fall well within the discretion Congress has handed over to the executive branch, but the more aggressive ones go far beyond anything Congress anticipated when passing the laws in question.\n\nIn some situations, such as when the president simply refuses to enforce a law, it can also be argued that the president is violating the Constitution\u2019s command that he \u201ctake care\u201d to faithfully execute the laws. But there\u2019s very little precedent for such cases, and it can be difficult to find someone harmed by the action with standing to sue, or to distinguish a failure to \u201ctake care\u201d from normal discretion regarding how laws are executed.", "description": "The betting market PredictIt gives the Democrats about a 60 percent chance of capturing the presidency next year.
