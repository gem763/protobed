(C. Stanley Photography/Round House Theatre)\n\nTheater critic\n\nSometimes, you can just feel actors inviting you to share their joy in being someone else for a spell. The experience is a special brand of mutual exhilaration: their wonderful privilege, in having the opportunity to conjure another soul for you, and yours, in the knowledge that they are going through this process for your edification.\n\nThese thoughts come to mind as you watch the women of the playful and piquant \u201cSchool Girls; or, the African Mean Girls Play,\u201d Jocelyn Bioh\u2019s charming comedy of adolescent angst. A satirical study of the universal insecurities and hierarchical struggles of West African teenage girls, the play receives first-class treatment from director Nicole A. Watson and a cast eager to spread the aforesaid joy.\n\n\u201cThe African Mean Girls Play\u201d was a big hit in late 2017 for off-Broadway\u2019s MCC Theater, and there\u2019s no reason it shouldn\u2019t be one as well for Round House Theatre, which is back in its Bethesda home after an extensive interior makeover. Before, the company lobby looked like the reception area of a medical practice; now, redesigned in warmer tones and outfitted with a bar that runs half the length of the space, it\u2019s a welcoming way station on your path to a performance.\n\nThe theater itself has undergone modification, with the installation of a thrust stage, one that, as its name implies, extends into the audience more generously. The overall effect is a renovation matching the upgrade of Round House in recent years as a purveyor of dramatic art. More refined surroundings harmonize with the refinements in the productions.\n\nIf a company wants to perk up the place, then Bioh\u2019s play seems an ideal adornment, too. At 85 minutes, it\u2019s abbreviated, even a bit slight. But the playwright seems to know these characters inside and out, so there\u2019s no time wasted in an audience getting to know them, too.\n\nThe play takes place in 1986 in a girls\u2019 school in southeastern Ghana; in the way cliques form and the students coo over clothes and singers, it may as well be just off the Beltway. As in Tina Fey\u2019s \u201cMean Girls,\u201d the social dynamic at the Aburi Girls\u2019 Senior High School is diabolically Darwinian. Paulina (Kashayna Johnson) is Aburi\u2019s Regina George, the bullying leader of the pack, brooking no back talk from her cowed posse: best friend Ama (Awa Sal Secka), acolytes Mercy and Gifty (Debora Crabbe and Moriamo Temidayo Akibu), and browbeaten Nana (Jade Jones). The forthcoming auditions for the Miss Ghana beauty pageant have the girls in a tizzy \u2014 and Paulina in high dudgeon as a lighter-skinned transfer student, Ericka (Claire Saunders) steals the favor of a preening judge, former beauty queen Eloise (Shirine Babb).\n\n\n\nClaire Saunders (Ericka), center, and the cast of \u201cSchool Girls; or, the African Mean Girls Play\u201d at Round House Theatre. (C. Stanley Photography/Round House Theatre)\n\nInterlaced throughout \u201cSchool Girls\u201d is a note of poignancy: for these girls, the pageant is not an example of female exploitation or marker of shabby Western values. In a developing country, it seems, it\u2019s one of the few sure ways up and out. To this aspirational idea, Bioh adds the divisive issue of how beauty is perceived in a black society. The resentments that boil over in the play reflect some of the distorted priorities that white standards for physical perfection have imposed on the rest of the world. Not that Ericka, who\u2019s moved to Ghana from Ohio, does not understand racial injustice: being biracial in America left scars for her as well.\n\nFiltered through the sensibilities of Bioh\u2019s characters, though, \u201cSchool Girls\u201d is an affectionate portrait, rather than a harsh or self-righteous one. The actresses playing the students themselves are dynamite comedians, especially Crabbe and Akibu, in supposedly subordinate roles; their reactions to Johnson\u2019s Paulina, and to each other, are a production unto itself. Secka imbues the taken-for-granted Ama with impressive depth, and you ache for the pressure that Paulina puts on Jones\u2019s Nana, who pines for acceptance.\n\nJohnson carries off the most challenging role with exceptional skill, revealing Paulina\u2019s objectionable aspects before we get to see a more sympathetic side. The anger and the vulnerability both come through.\n\nBy the way: Peruse the program bios and notice how many of these actresses are based in Washington. Let\u2019s see more of all of them!\n\nAnd watch for the funny way Watson guides the actresses through a butchered version of a Whitney Huston song. It\u2019s the spirit of Pyramus and Thisbe from \u201cA Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream\u201d transferred to the shores of Africa.\n\nPaige Hathaway\u2019s design for the school cafeteria and Ivania Stack\u2019s prom-style dresses for the auditions fittingly enhance the play\u2019s exuberance \u2014 all in service of an excitement that fills a refreshed space with a freshness of talent.\n\nSchool Girls; or, the African Mean Girls Play, by Jocelyn Bioh.
