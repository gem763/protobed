The captains were placed at the very front. When stretching finished, the music cut off immediately and the players soon huddled up. After meeting for a brief second, they dispersed \u2014 running, not walking, to their position drills.\n\nAnd when the session concluded, the Redskins did something that is standard operating procedure at practically every high school football practice in America: They ran sprints.\n\nWelcome to the Bill Callahan era.\n\nIn his first practice as the Redskins\u2019 interim coach, Callahan sent a clear signal that the ousted Jay Gruden is no longer in charge. The central goal? The 63-year-old said he wants the Redskins to get back to the fundamentals.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the name of the game,\u201d Callahan said. \u201cIf you\u2019re not good in your fundamentals, you\u2019re not going to have them in the latter of the game. That mental toughness about fundamentals is important.\u201d\n\nCallahan wants the Redskins to play tighter, mistake-free football. Over the Redskins\u2019 0-5 start, Washington has been a sloppy football team \u2014 racking up the third-most penalties in the NFL. The Redskins also have been woefully inefficient on third down, posting the second-worst conversion rate (24.53%) in the league.\n\nCallahan wants fewer penalties. So, at practice, the Redskins had college referees brought in to observe and call plays as if they were actually taking place during a game. Washington specifically called the league office to request nearby NFL officials to come to practices.\n\nCallahan said he plans for the referees to show up again in the near future.\n\n\u201cI think it can help,\u201d tackle Morgan Moses said, \u201cbecause they obviously see something we don\u2019t see. \u2026 It helps us to figure out what they\u2019re looking at.\u201d\n\nMultiple players inside the locker room Wednesday noted the tempo in practice was faster;\n\nDuring team drills, the Redskins focused on \u201cdrive starters\u201d \u2014 the plays they will run specifically at the beginning of each series.\n\nCallahan outlined his expectations to the group in a team meeting, telling players there is no \u201cmagic formula\u201d to get the season turned around.\n\n\u201cWe just have to work every day,\u201d defensive lineman Jonathan Allen said.\n\nThe old-school approach is part of why fundamentals are so important for Callahan.\n\nIt\u2019s like being a golfer, he said. If a golfer isn\u2019t on the driving range every day, he\u2019s not going to get better. His swing and the timing will be off.\n\nAs for the running, Callahan says it\u2019s about conditioning.\n\nThe Redskins have had well-chronicled problems with second-half collapses \u2014 they\u2019ve been outscored 77-33 in five games. The running and the sprints are aimed at improving conditioning so the Redskins don\u2019t run out of gas late.\n\nSprints were a form of discipline under Gruden, who made the offensive and defensive lines run sideline to sideline in training camp after a mid-practice brawl. They rarely ran sprints during the regular season.\n\nMoses, though, welcomes the change.\n\n\u201cThis thing is not going to get fixed in one day,\u201d Moses said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to sit here and say, \u2018Hey, we\u2019re going to go down to Miami and blow them out.\u2019 We have to come together because 0-5 start, for this franchise, it\u2019s just embarrassing. Especially when you have a franchise that has so much history in it.\n\n\u201cWe have to put a better product out there.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
