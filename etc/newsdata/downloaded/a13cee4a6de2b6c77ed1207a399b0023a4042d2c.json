Anacom is expected to share the outcome of the consultation in January 2020.\n\nIf approved, the regulator said it will allocate six bands, including 700 megahertz, to ensure the transition to the next generation of mobile networks, and 3.6 gigahertz, which is able to provide needed capacity for 5G supported services.\n\n\u201cThe allocation of rights of use for frequencies should be subject to an auction procedure as this is a potentially a more transparent and objective process for all stakeholders and less intrusive in their business plans,\u201d Anacom said in statement.\n\nThe Portuguese unit of telecommunications firm Altice , the country\u2019s largest operator, said last year it was working with China\u2019s Huawei to make Portugal a European leader in the development and roll-out of 5G networks.\n\nAltice Portugal told Reuters it is evaluating Anacom\u2019s auction proposal.\n\nIts main rivals, NOS and Vodafone Portugal, could not be immediately reached for comment.", "description": "Portugal's telecommunications market regulator Anacom plans to hold an auction between April and June next year to allocate next-generation 5G frequencies to national operators, it said on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
