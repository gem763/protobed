That injunction would remain in place while the case is being litigated in the courts.\n\nCALIFORNIA FEDERAL JUDGE REIMPOSES NATIONWIDE BAN ON TRUMP ASYLUM POLICY, DEFYING APPEALS COURT\n\nThe government\u2019s new brief warned the court that unless the nationwide injunction is lifted, it \u201cwould severely disrupt the orderly administration of an already overburdened asylum system.\u201d\n\nThat federal district court order follows a federal appeals court decision last month narrowing the scope of that injunction to just California. The American Civil Liberties Union and other groups then went back to the district court seeking to have the nationwide injunction reimposed, which the district court in California did on Monday, defying the appeals court.\n\n\u201cWhile nationwide injunctions are not the \u2018general rule,\u2019 they are appropriate \u2018where such breadth [is] necessary to remedy a plaintiff\u2019s harm,\u2019\u201d U.S. District Judge Jon Tigar wrote. \u201cThis is such a case. Accordingly, and for the reasons set forth above, the Court grants the [immigrant rights] Organizations\u2019 motion to restore the nationwide scope of the injunction.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration in July announced the sweeping new policy tightening restrictions for asylum seekers. The new rule requires most migrants entering through America\u2019s southern border to first seek asylum in one of the countries they traversed \u2013 whether in Mexico, in Central America, or elsewhere on their journey. In most cases, only if that application is denied would they then be able to seek asylum in the United States.\n\nMonday's ruling is another defeat for the administration on its asylum policies, and a win for immigrant rights groups.\n\nThe ACLU\u2019s Lee Gelernt celebrated the order Monday, saying, \u201cThe court recognized there is grave danger facing asylum-seekers along the entire stretch of the southern border.\u201d\n\nThe White House ripped the ruling.\n\n\"Immigration and border security policy cannot be run by any single district court judge who decides to issue a nationwide injunction,\" press secretary Stephanie Grisham said.", "description": "The Supreme Court is considering an emergency appeal from the Justice Department that would allow them to enforce, for now, the Trump administration\u2019s ban on asylum for anyone trying to cross the southern border by transiting through a third country, such as Mexico.", "authors": ["Shannon Bream", "Shannon Bream Currently Serves As Anchor Of Fox News Channel'S", "Fnc"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/07/18/694940094001_6060905911001_6060901895001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
