And although the NBA has received criticism in the U.S. for perceived kowtowing to China, league commissioner Adam Silver has backed employees' right to free speech.\n\nThe league issued a statement Thursday condemning the actions of the Rockets PR staffer who cut off the CNN reporter.\n\nThe first Nets-Lakers preseason game appeared to be in jeopardy in the aftermath of Morey's tweet, but the game was played in Shanghai on Thursday, although several media events, including player availability, was cancelled.\n\nFans at the game were seen wearing NBA jerseys, but many were also proudly waving the Chinese flag.\n\nThe teams are set to face off again tomorrow in Shenzhen, which shares a 22-mile (37 kilometer) border with Hong Kong.\n\nThe city has been a highly sensitive region since the unrest broke out in June. Beijing sent hundreds of military vehicles and more than 10,000 paramilitary officers to the city in August in a warning to protesters.\n\nPeople walk by the NBA flagship retail store on October 9 in Beijing after the US basketball league and China fell out due to a pro-Hong Kong tweet from the Rockets general manager\n\nChinese fans wearing a T-shirt to mock the NBA amid the tensions as they waiting for the league's players outside a hotel in Shanghai ahead of an exhibition game on October 10\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers and the Brooklyn Nets had been scheduled to address news conferences this afternoon.\n\nAmong the players, the Lakers' LeBron James is one of the most popular sports stars in the Far East.\n\nBut journalists will not be able to interview the teams' executives or the players for the rest of their China visit.\n\n'We have decided not to hold media availability for our teams for the remainder of our trip in China,' the league said in a statement.\n\nIt added: 'They have been placed into a complicated and unprecedented situation while abroad and we believe it would be unfair to ask them to address these matters in real time.'\n\nWhy is China angry at the NBA? 'I did not intend my tweet to cause any offence to Rockets fans and friends of mine in China,' Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey (pictured) apologized to Beijing Morey's initial tweet showed the words 'Fight For Freedom. Stand With Hong Kong' The dispute between China and the NBA began on October 4 when Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey posted an image captioned 'Fight for Freedom; Stand with Hong Kong' on Twitter. His Tweet caused an instant outrage in China because the country views the unrest as a 'separatist movement' masterminded by 'Western forces' against the Communist regime. Morey deleted his tweet and apologized to 'Rockets fans and friends of mine in China'. In a statement, the NBA called Morey's post 'regrettable.' But Adam Silver, the commissioner of the NBA, backed Morey's initial tweet and promised to protect his employees' right to free speech - remarks that further angered Beijing. Adam Silver, Commissioner of the NBA, showed his support for freedom of speech amid the controversy surrounding Morey's post about the protests in Hong Kong China's state broadcaster CCTV, which owns the right to air the NBA games in the country, cancelled the airing of the two preseason games. Hordes of Chinese companies have cut ties with the league. Products related to the Rockets were removed from shops across the country. Tencent, which owns the digital streaming rights for the NBA in China, also said they would suspend the broadcasting of the games. The Chinese internet giant had signed a five-year deal, reported to be worth $1.5 billion, with the basketball association.\n\nSuch an incident occurred Thursday in Japan, where CNN's Christina Macfarlane was cut off by a Rockets PR staffer when asking Westbrook and Harden about their willingness to speak out in the future.\n\n'The NBA has always been a league that prides itself on its players and its coaches being able to speak out openly about political and societal affairs,' Macfarlane said at a press conference following a Rockets exhibition in Japan.\n\n'I just wonder after the events of this week, and the fallout we've seen, whether you both feel differently about speaking out in that way in the future?'\n\n'Excuse me, we are taking basketball questions only,' a voice can be heard telling Macfarlane.\n\nCNN's Christina Macfarlane was not allowed to ask James Harden or Russell Westbrook about China and its relationship with the NBA yesterday during a press conference in Japan\n\nJames Harden, pictured in Japan yesterday after an exhibition game, apologized to China on Monday even though he had not publicly expressed any views previously on the matter\n\nBoth James Harden (left) and Russell Westbrook (right) have business interests in China\n\nMacfarlane quickly responded: 'It's a legitimate question.'\n\n'It's not,' the PR staffer said.\n\nUndeterred, Macfarlane continued to press.\n\n'This is an event that's happened this week during the NBA,' she said.\n\n'It's already been answered,' the PR staffer replied.\n\nMacfarlane made one last attempt to direct the question to Harden, who remained silent.\n\n'This is a question that's not been answered,' Macfarlane said. 'James?'\n\nNeither player responded to Macfarlane's question and she ultimately surrendered the microphone.\n\nHarden has been praised in China after fans spotted him wearing a Chinese bracelet (circled)\n\nHarden and Westbrook have been hailed as heroes in China after apologizing and expressing their love for Beijing following their general manager's tweet.\n\nStanding next to Westbrook, Harden told the press on Monday: 'We apologize. You know, we love China, we love playing there. For both of us individually, we go there once or twice a year.\n\n'They show us the most important love. We appreciate them as a fan base.\n\n'We love everything there about them and we appreciate the support that they give us individually and as organisation.'\n\nChinese fans also praised both for wearing Chinese clothing and accessories.\n\nHarden wore a Chinese coin-shaped bracelet during his apology and Westbrook sported a Chinese-style jacket at a press conference on Tuesday.\n\nWestbrook has also been highly praised in China after choosing to wear a Chinese-style tunic jacket in a press conference (right) after his debut show against the Toronto Raptors (left)\n\nThe NBA has released a statement condemning the actions of the Rockets PR staffer.\n\n'During today's Houston Rockets media availability, a team representative inappropriately interjected to prevent CNN's Christina Macfarlane from receiving an answer to her question,' read the statement.\n\n'We've apologized to Ms. Macfarlane as this was inconsistent with how the NBA conducts media events.'\n\nBefore the fallout, the Houston Rockets were one of the most popular basketball teams in China after Shanghai-native Yao Ming was recruited by it in 2002.\n\nThe 7foot6 center is now the head of the Chinese Basketball Association and the counterpart of NBA's Silver.", "description": "The NBA has scrapped journalists' access to  players from the Los Angeles Lakers and the Brooklyn Nets, who are preparing for a pre-season game in China near the border of Hong Kong.", "authors": ["Billie Thomson For Mailonline", "Alex Raskin Sports News Editor For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/11/19583040-0-image-a-13_1570790409808.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
