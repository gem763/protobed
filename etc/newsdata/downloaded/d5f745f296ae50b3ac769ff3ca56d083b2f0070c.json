The Story Doesn\u2019t End Here.", "language": "en", "text": "As Sarah Chayes, who long worked in Afghanistan and has written an important book \u2014 \u201cThieves of State: Why Corruption Threatens Global Security\u201d \u2014 puts it: \u201cNothing feeds extremism more than the in-your-face corruption and injustice\u201d that some of America\u2019s closest Middle East allies administer daily to their people.\n\nThe third ISIS faction was composed of the true religious ideologues, led by al-Baghdadi. They have their own apocalyptic version of Islam. But it would not have resonated so far and wide were it not for the first two factors listed above.\n\nAnd that leads us back to Trump and his foreign policy. Trump has never met a dictator he did not like. He is blind to the fact that the next al-Baghdadi is being incubated today in some prison in Egypt, where President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt, whom Trump once actually called \u201cmy favorite dictator,\u2019\u2019 is not only rounding up violent Jihadists but liberal nonviolent journalists, activists and politicians. Their only crime is that they want to have a say in their country\u2019s future and help to create an environment where they can realize their full potential \u2014 so they will not have to look for dignity, power, a job or a girl\u2019s hand from extremist groups like ISIS.\n\nWhen Trump praises Baghdadi as his favorite victim and el-Sisi as his favorite dictator, all he is doing is walking in place. We\u2019re actually getting nowhere.\n\nAnd that brings me back to Syria. Syrian Sunnis supported ISIS for the same reason Iraqi Sunnis did. Iran, the pro-Iranian Hezbollah militia, the Shiite-Alawite Syrian regime of Bashar Assad and Russia have all collaborated to create a pro-Iranian Shiite minority government in Damascus. Of course they gave Trump a free pass to kill Baghdadi! His death just makes it that much easier for them to rule Syria without sharing power with the Sunnis. As long as that\u2019s the case, there will be no stability there.\n\nFinally, Trump kept going on and on in his news conference about how he, in his infinite wisdom, was keeping U.S. troops in Syria to protect the oil fields there so maybe U.S. oil companies could exploit them. He even boasted that while he was against the Iraq war, we should have taken over all of Iraq\u2019s oil fields to pay for it.\n\nThis is disgusting talk, and again, a prescription for trouble in the future. If America has any role in the Middle East today, it is not to protect the oil wells, but to protect and enhance what I call the \u201cislands of decency.\u201d", "description": "President Trump boasts of defeating the Islamic State.
