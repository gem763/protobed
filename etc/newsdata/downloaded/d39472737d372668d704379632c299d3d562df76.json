Before, the vast majority of people couldn't tell you what a yield curve is, never mind an inverted one.\n\nIt is of course still likely to be a pretty small minority of people who concern themselves with bond market terminology, but a growing one.\n\nWith an election next year in America Donald Trump and his administration will use all the tools available to keep the US economy growing\n\nThe inversion of the yield curve should not come as a surprise as it has been on the cards since last year.\n\nIt is also inevitable that one will materialise at fairly regular intervals through the years.\n\nThis is because underlying all the financial markets jargon and news headlines an inverted yield curve simply means investors expect there to be higher levels of risk in the short term than the long.\n\nIn other words it means a majority of people think we are in for a choppy year or so, economically speaking.\n\nIt is important to make a key distinction when referring to the yield curve, inverted or otherwise.\n\nWe are talking about the United States. More specifically the government issued bonds of the United States.\n\nOther yield curves may well invert such as here in the United Kingdom but they don't have significant implications outside of their home turf.\n\nAs far as the global economy is concerned the United States is the keystone. China is playing a large role too but the US is still number one.\n\nThe fact that we are primarily concerned with the United States and its government issued debt is the basis for optimism that a recession will be fleeting and shallow, or possibly avoided altogether in the near term.\n\nThe optimistic case rest on two key pillars. First there is the fact that while an inverted yield curve has been a precursor to a recession on several occasions over recent decades, the rules of the game may have changed since the last time it foreshadowed a major slowdown.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's massive monetary stimulus programme may have altered the bond market and underlying economy in fundamental ways\n\nThis is because of the unprecedented monetary policy steps taken by the Federal Reserve and other central banks over the past decade.\n\nAmerica's great QE programme was unlike anything seen in human history. Over the course of 2009 and 2010 the Federal Reserve System went from holding around $700billion of assets to $2.1trillion.\n\nIt did this by pumping freshly issued cash into the economy via a buying spree of 'troubled assets' such as mortgage-backed bonds.\n\nThere is a very real possibility this has altered the bond market and underlying economy in fundamental ways which are yet to be fully understood and therefore make the past an unreliable guide to the future.\n\nThe second of these pillars of hope lies in the prospect of fiscal stimulus. In fact today's rally in the stock market reflects precisely this expectation.\n\nIf America embarks on serious tax cutting and government spending it could very well keep the economic show on the road.\n\nDemocrats are jostling for position as they seek the party's backing to take on Donald Trump\n\nWhat makes this course of action all the more likely is the looming 2020 election where incumbent President Donald Trump and his administration will do all in their power to head off an economic slowdown in the run-up to the November vote.\n\nIt's the economy, stupid. The phrase coined by Bill Clinton adviser James Carville back in 1992 and later adapted in The Thick of It to 'It's the economy, Stewpot' holds as true as ever.\n\nAn economy in recession is the last thing an incumbent wants when seeking re-election as it make the odds of winning very slim. A strong economy brings with it a high chance of victory at the ballot box.\n\nThe economy and people's personal finances are the biggest factors in where their vote goes in most cases.\n\nWe can expect Trump to throw the kitchen sink at keeping the train rolling and it may just work.", "description": "Warning lights on the global economy have been flashing red over the past couple of weeks with journalists and other commentators queuing up to issue a gloomy prognosis.", "authors": ["Alex Sebastian For This Is Money", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
