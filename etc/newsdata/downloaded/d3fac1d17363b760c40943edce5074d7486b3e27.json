The NBA should feel confident in its position and stand up for the free speech rights of its employees.\"\n\nYang's comments were just the latest perspective added to an ongoing controversy surrounding Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey's support for pro-democracy, anti-Beijing protesters in Hong Kong.\n\nANDREW YANG RAISES $10M IN LAST QUARTER, TRIPLES PREVIOUS FUNDRAISING FIGURE\n\nThat support, expressed in a now-deleted tweet, caused a massive backlash in China, where state-run China Central Television (CCTV) said it would not air two exhibition games between the Los Angeles Lakers and Brooklyn Nets. The outlet also took aim at NBA commissioner Adam Silver, who defended Morey's right to free speech.\n\n\u201cWe voice our strong dissatisfaction and opposition to Adam Silver offering as an excuse the right to freedom of expression,\u201d CCTV said, according to The New York Times. \u201cWe believe that no comments challenging national sovereignty and social stability fall within the scope of freedom of expression.\u201d\n\nOthers in the NBA have faced American criticism for their responses. ESPN anchor Keith Olbermann had scathing criticism for Rockets player James Harden after he apologized to China.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"The @NBA\u2019s obsequiousness on this, from [Nets owner] @joetsai1999 to the smarmy league Statement on @dmorey to this Harden remark, is embarrassing beyond words. To stand up for the democratic freedoms we have here is to risk alienating those who would suppress them,\" Olbermann tweeted on Monday.\n\nNormally outspoken Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr also provoked backlash when he declined to comment on the issue.", "description": "Andrew Yang, a businessman and 2020 hopeful, condemned the Chinese government's decision not to broadcast two NBA games, claiming that the nation was mainly hurting its own people.", "authors": ["Sam Dorman", "Sam Dorman Is A Reporter With Fox News.
