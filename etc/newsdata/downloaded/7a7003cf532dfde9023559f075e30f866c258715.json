REUTERS/Toru Hanai/File Photo\n\nA slowdown in China and the U.S.-China trade war have emerged as risks for Japan\u2019s recovery prospects, but policymakers have put their faith in spending by consumers and businesses at home to offset the risks to the outlook.\n\nJapan\u2019s core orders, a highly volatile data series regarded as an indicator of capital spending in the coming six to nine months, fell 2.4% in August from the previous month, Cabinet Office data showed on Thursday.\n\nThe drop was largely in line with a 2.5% decline predicted by economists in a Reuters poll and followed a sharp 6.6% fall in July, the largest month-on-month loss since a 7.8% drop in May.\n\nFrom a year earlier, core orders, which exclude those of ships and electricity, lost 14.5% in August, the biggest year-on-year drop since November 2014, Refinitiv data showed.\n\n\u201c(The reading) suggests capital spending is weakening,\u201d said Atsushi Takeda, chief economist at Itochu Economic Research Institute.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s likely it has peaked out from a cyclical perspective, as pressure from the U.S.-China trade war continues and focus is also on the impact of the sales tax hike.\u201d\n\nCapital expenditure has been among the few areas of strength in the economy as non-manufacturers continue to invest heavily on automation to cope with a tight labor market, offsetting the weakness in manufacturers\u2019 spending. Declines in capex could add to speculation the government will boost spending.\n\nThe Bank of Japan has faced heightened expectations it could ease policy at its Oct. 30-31 board meeting to dampen the impact from weakening external demand.\n\nJapan\u2019s economy has recently benefited from strong domestic demand, although there are concerns the country\u2019s higher consumption tax this month could hurt the outlook. A Reuters Tankan poll earlier on Thursday showed Japanese manufacturers\u2019 business outlook was less pessimistic in October while service-sector sentiment rose to a three-month high.\n\nSome consolation this week also came from household spending data, which rose for a ninth straight month in August, the longest such streak since comparable data became available in 2001, data on Tuesday showed.\n\nA bright spot in Thursday\u2019s data was a 21.3% month-on-month jump in orders from overseas, the biggest rise since October 2015, though it was mainly driven by big-ticket items, including for railway cars and planes.\n\nStill, the outlook for Japan\u2019s economy, the world\u2019s third-largest, remains murky as manufacturers face challenges from prolonged contractions in exports and production.\n\nWhile the economy grew an annualized 1.3% in the second quarter, some analysts have warned it could be left without growth drivers if domestic demand falters.\n\nThe Cabinet Office on Thursday maintained its assessment on machinery orders to say they are showing a pick up.\n\n\u201cThere was a big rise in June and that was followed by a fall in July and August,\u201d said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.\n\nBy sector, core orders from manufacturers fell 1.0% in August from the previous month, declining again after rising in July, while those from the service-sector fell 8.0%, the Cabinet Office data showed.", "description": "Japan's core machinery orders slipped for the second consecutive month in August, suggesting deeper fissures in business investment and the broader economy from slowing global trade.", "authors": ["Daniel Leussink", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439048638&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9900F", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
