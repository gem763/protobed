Further, 37 percent say lawmakers should end their impeachment probe, while four percent remain undecided on the matter. When it comes to a Senate impeachment trial, 46 percent are in favor of convicting President Trump and 47 percent are against.\n\nThe poll, conducted by telephone, is made up of 1,000 registered voters and was taken between October 23rd and 26th. It has a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points.\n\nThe USA TODAY/Suffolk poll is the second survey in recent days showing a considerable number of Americans are against impeaching President Trump. According to an NBC News/SurveyMonkey poll published on Friday, Americans are split down party lines on whether to oust the president. Forty-nine percent believe he should be impeached and removed from office, 49 percent oppose the move.\n\nLast month, House Democrats launched an impeachment inquiry against President Trump over his July 25th telephone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, accusing the president of attempting to pressure his counterpart to probe allegations of corruption against former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden. Both world leaders have denied the charges and the White House has released a transcript of the call to show no wrongdoing occurred.\n\nUnder pressure from House Republicans and moderate Democrats, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced Monday that Congress will vote to formalize their impeachment inquiry. The move is expected to put an end to House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA) conducting closed-door interviews with current and former Trump administration officials inside Capitol Hill\u2019s SCIF room, a compartmented facility for sensitive information. House Republicans have accused Schiff of using the secret room to selectively leak excerpts of witnesses\u2019 testimony to the media to boost public opinion for impeachment.", "description": "A newly-released poll found less than 40% of registered voters believe House Democrats should vote to impeach President Donald Trump.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1184008912-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
