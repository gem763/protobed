Adam Abram said in a late Tuesday statement.\n\nPembroke, Bermuda-based James River said it expects to boost reserves for the third quarter by $55 million to $60 million net of reinsurance recoveries, mostly related to its commercial auto line with its Excess and Surplus Lines segment for 2016 and 2017. The rest of those losses stem from prior underwriting years in the company\u2019s casualty reinsurance segment.\n\nRead now: Uber customers paid more than $6 billion in cash last year, and accounting for it isn\u2019t easy\n\nThe company JRVR, -22.17% is expecting to report growth of 72% in core E&S lines gross written premiums from the year-earlier quarter. It is expecting to report earnings after market close on Nov. 6.\n\nB. Riley analyst Randy Binner downgraded the stock to sell from neutral on the news and cut his stock price target to $40 from $45.\n\nThe Raiser account is about 20% of James River\u2019s trailing 12-months premiums and about 35% of trailing 12-month premiums in the E&S segment, Binner wrote in a note to clients. The insurer announced a roughly $2 a share reserve charge related to the Uber risk, which is about 3% of total reserves.\n\n\u201cWhile we do not have full 3Q19 financials, the expected top-line decrease from the fall off of the Uber book, margin compression from reduced scale, and increased conservatism on reserve adequacy has moved 2019 estimated EPS from $2.60 to $1.00, and 2020 estimated EPS from $2.65 to $2.25,\u201d the analyst wrote.\n\nSunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst Mark Hughes downgraded the stock to hold from buy.\n\n\u201cCommercial auto has been a very challenging line for the industry as a whole and presumably more so for Uber, perhaps a function of its high profile,\u201d Hughes wrote. \u201cWe have commented recently on the growing concern regarding the phenomenon of \u2018social inflation\u2019 which often manifests in higher jury awards, which make it challenging for insurers to accurately forecast future payouts.\u201d\n\nUber shares UBER, -0.89% were down 1% Wednesday, and have fallen 35% in the last three months amid growing concerns about a path to profitability.\n\nRead: The path to profitability for Uber and Lyft looks more like a dead end\n\nJames River has fallen 18%, while the S&P 500 SPX, +1.00% has fallen 2.3% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.79% has fallen about 2%.\n\nRead now: IPO market has begun pushing back on growth-at-all-costs private companies", "description": "Shares of insurer James River Group Holdings Ltd. tumbled 22% Wednesday, putting them on track for their biggest one-day percentage decline since February of...", "authors": ["Ciara Linnane", "Corporate News Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HJ371_uber05_ZG_20190510125620.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
