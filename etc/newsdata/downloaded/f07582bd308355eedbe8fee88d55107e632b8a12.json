But Republicans say it would give them more leeway to call their own witnesses, and put swing-state Democrats on the record on launching the impeachment inquiry.\n\nGraham added on Tuesday night that Trump should get \"the same rights that any American has if you\u2019re giving a parking ticket to confront the witnesses against you: can\u2019t be based on hearsay.\"\n\n\u201cWe cannot allow future presidents and this president to be impeached based on an inquiry in the House that\u2019s never been voted upon that does not allow the president to confront the witnesses against him, to call witnesses on his behalf, and cross-examine people who are accusing him of misdeeds,\u201d he added.\n\nThe House is holding near daily closed-door depositions with current and former administration officials as part of their inquiry focused on Trump asking Ukraine to investigate the Bidens and whether or not he held up aid to try to pressure the country. The inquiry is being overseen by the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight Committees.", "description": "Sen.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/grahamlindsey_102219gn2_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
