Court\u2019s order. So I\u2019m paying him!\n\n\"The court order, and I quote, says I have to pay him 'the sum of $7,500'. That\u2019s it. It does not say how.\"\n\nNoticing she could pay the sum by any means she wished, Brandi went to her local bank to explain her plan to pay her cheating ex entirely in coins.\n\nAfter telling staff the whole story, she said the 'beautiful little ladies' were more than happy to assist her in turning the settlement into ten-cent coins, as well as supporting her with a payment plan.\n\n(Image: Facebook)\n\nTen huge boxes of coins weighing roughly 160kg were then sent to her husband to deal with.\n\nPeople loved her 'genius' move, with one commenting: \"I wish we could see his reaction lol, good for you!\"\n\nIt's not the first time a split couple have used divorce proceedings to get back at one another after a man was ordered to pay his ex-wife \u00a3145,000 in compensation for the 27 years of their marriage she had spent doing the housework and raising their children.\n\nThe woman, now in her 70s, had gained an economics degree but gave up her career after tying the knot to become a housewife.\n\nAs she was now considered 'too old' to find a job, a judge found it to be a 'reasonable' sum 'in order to rebalance the disparate economic situation of the spouses resulting from the marriage and its breakup.\"\n\nBe careful who you mess with.", "description": "Brandi Lee explained the situation to staff at the bank, who were more than happy to help with her 'genius' plan", "authors": ["Luke Matthews", "Image", "Facebook"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20748557.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Brandi-Lee.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
