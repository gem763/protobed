For starters, those points are generally rights afforded to a suspect in a criminal trial \u2014 not to the president during an impeachment proceeding in the House of Representatives.\n\nRead: Joe Biden Just Called for Trump's Impeachment: \u2018He Has Indicted Himself\u2019\n\nImpeachment by the House more closely resembles the process of being indicted by a grand jury, where witnesses testify in secret so they can speak freely while prosecutors decide whether to bring criminal charges.\n\nIf the House votes to impeach, Trump will then face trial in the Senate before he\u2019s either cleared or kicked out of office.\n\n\u201cThere are no due process rights stipulated in impeachment hearings \u2014 they just don\u2019t exist,\u201d said Howell. \u201cThis is about removing an individual from office, and it\u2019s not about putting somebody in jail. The consequences, and the standards, are very different.\u201d\n\nUltimately, Trump's unhinged letter may end up doing him more harm than good. Democrats have already signaled that they plan on citing Trump's blanket defiance as yet another reason to evict him from the presidency.\n\nDemocrats are weighing whether to impeach Trump over his efforts to pressure Ukraine to launch an investigation of his 2020 Democratic rival Joe Biden, including on a phone call with Ukraine\u2019s president on July 25.\n\n\u201cIf they are stonewalled now, they\u2019ll take it as further evidence of obstruction,\u201d Richard Arenberg, a former Hill staffer for Democrats, told VICE News. \u201cAnd they can drop all that evidence into a second article of impeachment.\u201d\n\nPelosi appeared to receive Trump\u2019s letter as precisely that kind of material.\n\n\u201cThis letter is manifestly wrong,\u201d Pelosi said in a statement. \u201cThe White House should be warned that continued efforts to hide the truth of the President\u2019s abuse of power from the American people will be regarded as further evidence of obstruction.\u201d\n\nCover: U.S. President Donald Trump speaks at a signing ceremony at the White House in Washington on Oct. 7, 2019, for a bilateral trade agreement with Japan.
