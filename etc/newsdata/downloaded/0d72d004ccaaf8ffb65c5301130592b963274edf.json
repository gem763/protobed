(Getty Images)\n\n\u201cHe put that out on social media, which led to the confrontation\u201d with Mayock.\n\nWednesday\u2019s Instagram story, in which Brown posted the letter from Mayock detailing that he\u2019d been fined nearly $14,000 for skipping the team\u2019s pre-game walkthrough on August 22, was just the first of several: on Friday night he posted a tightly-produced video that included audio of a phone conversation between himself and Raiders coach Jon Gruden that said \u201cFree me!\u201d\n\n[Watch NFL games on your phone for FREE with the Yahoo Sports app]\n\nOn Saturday morning there was a rambling Instagram caption that ended with \u201cRelease me.\u201d\n\nNot long after, Oakland acceded to his demand.\n\n\u2018There was a robust market\u2019\n\nMortensen also affirmed what Drew Rosenhaus, Brown\u2019s agent, claimed - that despite all of the drama, there was strong interest in the the receiver.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cRosenhaus said there was a robust market for Antonio Brown - he\u2019s not lying,\u201d Mortensen said. \u201cI checked around, there were teams seriously interested. Russell Wilson was kind of campaigning for him in Seattle because he worked with [Brown] in L.A. in the offseason and at various times, and yes, Cleveland Browns. John Dorsey, the general manager there, he\u2019d consider anything.\n\n\u201cBut what they all found out was this was pretty much a fait accompli,\u201d that Brown would wind up with New England, Mortensen said. \u201c[Bill] Belichick actually offered a first-round pick to the Steelers, [general manager] Kevin Colbert wanted more, but really didn\u2019t want to trade him at all, and went on and took the third and fifth from the Raiders.\u201d\n\nUnderstandably, Pittsburgh did not want to trade Brown to another AFC North team or its AFC rival, the Patriots, earlier this year, but Brown\u2019s apparently highly-coordinated temper tantrums got him what he wanted.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:\n\n\n\n", "description": "Several teams showed interest in signing Brown after he was released by Oakland.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/oayEqzYLwwvcHpflm6qfSA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/fkmvb1X7EG4iK3zC6zu9MA--~B/aD0yNjIwO3c9MzkzMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/a52509d0-d252-11e9-bbbf-8805acf6b1bd", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
