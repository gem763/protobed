Returns have historically been humdrum compared with U.S. peers, who also raised about five times more capital than Europe\u2019s $10 billion haul in 2018.\n\nThe transatlantic deficit may be closing, however, as optimistic private valuations of U.S. VC-backed companies come unstuck. Shares in Uber Technologies, Slack Technologies and Peloton Interactive are down 25% on average since listing this year. WeWork parent The We Company didn\u2019t even get that far.\n\nData presented at last week\u2019s Venture Capital Forum in Paris by the European Investment Fund, one of the public backers of the bloc\u2019s VCs, implies there may be a systematic overvaluation problem in America. U.S. \u201cICT unicorns\u201d, or VC-backed companies in the information and communication technology sector worth $1 billion or more, have historically been valued at roughly 5.5 times the amount of venture money invested by the time they reached that milestone. But when their backers managed to cash out the multiple shrunk to about 4.5, according to the data set used by the EIF which stretches back over a decade.\n\nIn Europe, the opposite is true: the bloc\u2019s star ICT companies were worth almost 5 times invested capital at the time of reaching unicorn status, and their backers went on to realise a 5.5 times multiple. The takeaway is that European private tech valuations are closer to reality than those stateside.\n\nOr at least that\u2019s the hope of many attendees at Venture Capital Forum. The theory is that America\u2019s historic strength - tons of cash - is now a weakness, since startups are bloated and overvalued. In Europe, by contrast, there\u2019s less money chasing each promising opportunity, which bodes well for returns.\n\nOld World tech investors still face unique challenges, including slow GDP growth and a patchwork of 30-odd economies with different rules and languages. That\u2019s partly why major venture money has historically steered clear. But the data suggests those obstacles are surmountable: European and U.S. VC returns have both been around 15% to 20% in recent years, according to data presented by Amadeus Capital Partners\u2019 Anne Glover at the forum. In the mid-1990s, there was a 20 percentage point gap.
