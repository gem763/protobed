Then, to my horror, a female voice that I don\u2019t recognize starts talking to my 18-month-old son. He looks around the room and then at the ceiling, wondering who\u2019s there. The voice is laughing when it chimes in. She says we have a nice house and encourages the nanny to respond. She does not. The voice even jokes that she hopes we don\u2019t change our password. I am sick to my stomach. After about five minutes of verbal \u201cjoy riding,\u201d the voice starts to get agitated at the nanny\u2019s lack of response and then snaps, in a very threatening voice: \u201cI\u2019m coming for the baby if you don\u2019t answer me, bitch!\u201d\n\n\u201cMy jaw drops. We unplug the cameras and change all passwords. The nanny has taken our son to the park down the street in an effort to escape. However, the damage has been done,\u201d he said.\n\nA similar instance occurred in January when a couple in Chicago, Illinois, said a hacker with a manly voice spoke to their baby through their home\u2019s Nest security camera.\n\n\u201cMy blood ran cold,\u201d said Arjun Sud.\n\nHe told reporters that the hacker shouted obscenities at him and his wife and even raised the upstairs thermostat to 90 degrees.\n\n\u201cAnd then they messed with our thermostat?\u201d his wife, Jessica, asked. \u201cWho does that?\u201d\n\nHowever, the Google product page stated that the camera is \u201cdesigned to help you look after your home and family \u2014 even when you\u2019re away.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith 24/7 live streaming, a versatile magnetic stand, person alerts with Nest Aware and one app for all your Nest products, Nest Cam Indoor helps you keep an eye on what matters. From anywhere.\u201d\n\nA couple in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, said they no longer feel safe after a hacker spoke to them through their camera and began playing vulgar music.\n\n\u201cIt gives me the chills just talking about it,\u201d said Samantha Westmoreland.\n\nNewcombe wrote that he was disappointed at Google\u2019s lack of response regarding the security breach and said the company blames the individual for using a compromised password.\n\n\u201cI am reminded of Google\u2019s former motto: \u2018Don\u2019t be evil\u2019 (now buried in literally the last sentence of their code of conduct). It is not evil to bring a product to market before the privacy has been completely figured out, but it is evil to let someone threaten to kidnap an 18-month-old and have no real response,\u201d he concluded.", "description": "A father in California is warning others after a Google Nest Cam hacker threatened to kidnap his son from their home.", "authors": ["Amy Furr"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/02/wi/ap/25/ijvgv1_google-assisting-nest-50514-file-25-2017-file-frame-grab-video-shows-nest-e1550685384735.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
