This cropped up repeatedly, in posts by multiple Facebook users, in multiple private groups.\n\nFor example this post appeared in one pro-Brexit group:\n\nImage copyright Facebook Image caption Many posts spoke of hanging MPs for treason\n\nEarlier this year, Labour MP Yvette Cooper questioned a Facebook representative about closed groups at a parliamentary hearing, highlighting one with 30,000 members which included a post calling for her and her family to be shot. The group was later removed.\n\nCooper told the BBC: \"We have raised concerns about closed groups with Facebook on a number of occasions and their answers have never been good enough.\"\n\n\"Social media companies have a responsibility to proactively seek out this content both with technology and proper moderators,\" she said.\n\nIn August, Facebook changed the name of \"closed\" groups to \"private\" groups. Groups once referred to as \"open\" are now called \"public\" on the network.\n\nIn a statement, a Facebook spokesperson said: \"Every single piece of content in private groups can be reported to us. We also use artificial intelligence technology to proactively identify and remove harmful content in these groups, as we do across Facebook.\n\n\"Where we see harmful content in private groups, we remove it.\n\n\"The proportion of content we remove proactively thanks to this technology and also reactively in response to user reports is broadly the same across public and private groups.\"\n\nImage copyright Parliament TV Image caption Yvette Cooper has previously expressed frustration with the tech firms\n\nCooper argues that independent regulation is needed, as well as bigger fines for companies that are slow to deal with violent content.\n\nIn response to the BBC investigation, she said: \"Complacency or claiming ignorance is outrageous when we all know the appalling consequences there can be if hateful and violent content is allowed to proliferate.\"\n\nImage copyright Facebook Image caption Another image in a pro-Brexit Facebook group\n\nDeath threat comments\n\nAs well as pictures like the ones above, violent messages appear in the comments section beneath more innocuous posts.\n\nThe BBC found dozens of examples of such comments in closed groups, including multiple examples of death threats aimed at specific MPs.\n\nThe profiles of the commenters indicate they are real people who live in the UK.\n\nImage copyright Facebook Image caption Dozens of the comments contained death threats against MPs\n\nAnti-Brexit groups\n\nOf the multiple closed groups seen by the BBC, pro-Brexit ones tended to have more violent content.\n\nA Newsnight investigation at the time of the European elections in May reached the same conclusion.\n\nHowever, we found that Remain-backing groups also contained violent comments, including death threats.\n\nImage copyright Facebook Image caption Pro-EU groups also contained death threats\n\nWhat's next for privacy on Facebook?\n\nFacebook is in the process of increasing its focusing on private communication, following scandals such as the one involving Cambridge Analytica,\n\n\"I believe the future of communication will increasingly shift to private, encrypted services where people can be confident what they say to each other stays secure and their messages and content won't stick around forever,\" chief executive Mark Zuckerberg wrote in a blog post earlier this year.\n\n\"Privacy gives people the freedom to be themselves and connect more naturally, which is why we build social networks,\" he wrote.\n\nIn practice, this means a greater emphasis on closed spaces such as private groups or Facebook Messenger rather than on public groups or the public News Feed. However, experts say this means extreme content can spread virally, largely unnoticed by outsiders.\n\n\"Closed social media channels have become a hotbed of illegal and harmful content over recent years,\" says Chloe Colliver of the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a think tank that investigates online extremism and polarisation.\n\n\"With little to no access for researchers in these spaces, social media platforms' responsibility to monitor and remove illegal and threatening behaviour is going largely unchecked, including in closed Facebook groups.\"\n\nLast year's yellow vest protests in France were largely organised in closed Facebook groups, meaning authorities knew very little about them until they suddenly turned violent, while during recent election campaigns in India and Brazil, misinformation spread in groups on WhatsApp, the encrypted chat app owned by Facebook.\n\nClosed groups have also been associated with medical conspiracy theories and sexist bullying.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Tech giants, such as Facebook and Google, are set to play a huge role in the next UK general election.\n\nChloe Colliver says the rise of closed groups \"leaves public figures, but also vulnerable minority groups, open to increasingly violent attacks online, and the subsequent fear of violence spilling over into the offline world.\n\n\"The threat to our democratic representatives and the broader ability for all citizens to feel safe engaging in democratic debate is enormous.\"\n\nA Facebook spokesperson said: \"The group raised by Yvette Cooper has been removed because it violates our policies, and we are investigating the additional content flagged by the BBC.\n\n\"In two years we've almost tripled the proportion of hate speech we proactively remove from Facebook before it's reported to us to 65%, but we know there's more to do. We'll continue to improve our technology and engage with policymakers to ensure our platforms remain safe.\"\n\nWhat did you think of this story? Have you seen something worth investigating?
