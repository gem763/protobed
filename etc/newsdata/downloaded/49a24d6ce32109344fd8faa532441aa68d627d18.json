Last week, authorities confirmed that Francisco was arrested at a motel in the San Antonio, Texas area.\n\nIn February, Francisco \u2014 dubbed the \u201cCrown Prince\u201d of the Latin Kings gang in 2005 \u2014 was released from federal prison after President Donald Trump signed into law the First Step Act, promoted by a coalition of Democrats, Republicans, and progressive and libertarian nonprofits.\n\nAccording to an investigative report by the Providence Journal\u2018s Brian Amaral and Katie Mulvaney, Francisco was convicted in 2005 for dealing crack cocaine and powder cocaine. The conviction was Francisco\u2019s third drug conviction, thus he was given a mandatory life sentence in federal prison.\n\nAfter Trump signed the First Step Act into law, though, Francisco had his life sentence for crack dealing reduced and he was released in February of this year, along with the other 3,100 convicts released this year by the new law.\n\nBefore his release, Francisco pleaded with the court that he had turned his life around, noting his taking part in rehabilitation programs in prison, which advocates of the First Step Act readily cited to make their case that even violent convicts could be reformed and thus released.\n\nOn July 13, about six months after being released from prison, Francisco was accused of breaking into the home of his ex-girlfriend and charged with domestic violence. Three months later, on October 2nd, police said Francisco stabbed Pine to death and immediately skipped town in an attempt to evade murder charges.\n\n\u201cI just want an answer,\u201d Pine\u2019s nephew Jay Chattelle told the Providence Journal. \u201cI just want to know what happened to my uncle. But at the same time, you\u2019re thinking, \u2018Once this is all done, Uncle Troy is still not here.'\u201d\n\nBefore his release from federal prison, Providence law enforcement officials warned that the former gang leader would likely commit additional crimes if released.\n\n\u201cSome criminals deserve to spend their lives incarcerated,\u201d Providence Police Department Deputy Chief Thomas Verdi told the Providence Journal. \u201cJoel is one.\u201d\n\nIn November 2018, Breitbart News reported that the First Step Act would result in the release of thousands of drug traffickers from prison despite their dealing deadly drugs such as fentanyl and heroin. A report this year by Fox News\u2019s Tucker Carlson stated that the First Step Act had successfully released about 240 sex offenders, nearly 60 convicted murderers and assailants, as well as almost 1,000 inmates convicted for drug crimes.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.
