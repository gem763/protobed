The NBA\u2019s streaming partner, Tencent, cut its schedule down to only include the Los Angeles Lakers-Los Angeles Clippers game, too, severely limiting options for Chinese fans to watch the first real action of the 2019-20 season.\n\nThe move, in reality, is not that surprising following the seemingly never-ending conflict between the NBA and China \u2014 which stemmed from Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey\u2019s seven-word tweet supporting pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong.\n\nChina did not take Morey\u2019s tweet well, and even pressured the league to fire him over it. They have also cut all ties with the Rockets and suspended numerous business deals with the NBA, something that commissioner Adam Silver said has caused \u201csubstantial\u201d financial consequences for the league. Several teams have even explored scenarios where the salary cap drops 10 to 15 percent as a result of the feud.\n\nCCTV issued a warning to Silver on Saturday, too, saying he could face \u201cretribution\u201d for defaming China and supporting Morey in an editorial. It also claimed he \u201cfabricated lies out of nothing and has sought to paint China as unforgiving\u201d in order to \u201cplease some American politicians.\u201d\n\nWhile most of the NBA\u2019s opening night content was tough to find in China, the international conflict was front and center in the United States.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) penned an Op-Ed in USA Today on Tuesday morning urging the NBA to stand up to China. Shaquille O\u2019Neal then supported Morey on TNT\u2019s \u201cInside the NBA\u201d pregame show, saying he was right to speak up for what he believed in.\n\nA Hong Kong flag was even flying in the background of the TNT show, which was broadcasting live outside of the Staples Center in Los Angeles. Thousands of \u201cFight For Freedom, Stand With Hong Kong\u201d shirts were reportedly being handed out to fans around the arena, too.\n\nHong Kong flag in prime position behind TNT\u2019s halftime show pic.twitter.com/MQjWJoCPr5 \u2014 Henry Bushnell (@HenryBushnell) October 23, 2019\n\nThe NBA declined to comment to ESPN about CCTV\u2019s decision not to air the games, something the network usually does on opening night.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "The lengthy conflict between the NBA and China took another turn Tuesday when CCTV declined to air the league\u2019s season openers.", "authors": ["Ryan Young", "Yahoo Sports Contributor"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/0lcbke1Sx7Lz6OVPG4cPHg--~B/aD0yNjQwO3c9Mzg5MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/a56ae2d0-f538-11e9-bd3c-c1295bbef23a", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
