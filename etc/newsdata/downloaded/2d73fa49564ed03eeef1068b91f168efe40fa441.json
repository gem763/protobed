The figure represents a decrease in his fund-raising pace from earlier in the summer.\n\nMr. Buttigieg\u2019s total for the third fund-raising quarter, which ended Monday, was $5.8 million less than the 2020 Democratic field-leading $ 24.9 million he raised during the previous fund-raising period, which ran from April to June.\n\n\u201cThis is great news and shows that in a crowded field, Pete continues to stand out as having the vision and leadership voters know we need to tackle the urgent problems facing our country,\u201d Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s campaign manager, Mike Schmuhl, wrote in a Tuesday morning email announcing the total. \u201cIt also positions us solidly as one of the top three fund-raisers in this race.\u201d\n\n[Which Democrats are leading the 2020 presidential race this week?]\n\nBut poll results indicate that Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s fund-raising haul has not so far elevated him into the first tier of the campaign\u2019s 19-candidate field. The latest polls of Iowa and New Hampshire show the 37-year-old mayor well behind Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., and slightly behind Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.", "description": "The total is a decrease from the last quarter when he topped the field in fund-raising with almost $25 million in donations.", "authors": ["Reid J.
