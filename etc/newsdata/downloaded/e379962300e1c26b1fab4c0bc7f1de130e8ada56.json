They are a constant concern for British agriculture and wildlife, with hundreds of threats intercepted at the border each year.\n\nThe UK is already seeing the arrival of Asian hornets which can cause anaphylactic shock, and future threats include the Asian tiger mosquito, which carries chikungunya and dengue fever.\n\nCurrently, the UK benefits from an EU-wide regulation to repel these invaders, with intelligence-gathering, disease alerts and research all being undertaken on a European scale.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

The report estimates that about 40 more non-native species will become invasive within 20 years.\n\nMPs recommend the government introduces an invasive species border force by the end of 2020. The government should also factor in invasive species risk assessments in bilateral trade agreements, they recommended.\n\nMary Creagh MP, chair of the Environmental Audit Committee, said invasive species were one of the \u201ctop five threats\u201d to the natural environment. \u201cGovernment funding to tackle invasive species is tiny and fails to match the scale of the threat,\u201d she said.\n\nSome non-native species now established in the UK are harmful to human health, including non-native deer carrying lyme disease and oak processionary moth caterpillars, which can cause skin irritation and breathing difficulties.\n\nNon-native grey squirrels are blamed for the decline in British reds by competing for food and infecting the native animals with the squirrel pox virus.\n\nInvasive species have become more of a problem due to increasing rates of trade and arrivals often attach to the hull of ships or \u201chitchhike\u201d in the ballast water of ships.\n\nMs Creagh said: \u201cWe\u2019re witnessing changes from climate change that put the future of our natural landscape at risk. Oak processionary moth caterpillars can strip an oak tree bare as well as posing a hazard to our own health.\n\n\u201cWe face losing half of the UK\u2019s native ash trees to ash dieback within a century, costing \u00a315bn. New regulations to halt their progress are welcome but they are too little, too late.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: \u201cInvasive non-native species not only challenge the survival of some of our rarest species but damage our natural ecosystems as well as costing the economy more than \u00a31.7bn per year.\n\n\u201cWe are committed to being leaders in tackling invasive species, and our 25-year environment plan commits us to enhancing the biosecurity of the country even further.\n\n\u201cWe welcome the Environmental Audit Committee\u2019s report and will now carefully consider its findings and recommendations.\u201d", "description": "The UK needs a \u201ccitizen\u2019s army\u201d to tackle the threat of dangerous pests and diseases which could cost the economy \u00a31.8bn\u00a0a year, MPs have warned.\u00a0 Current funding for biosecurity is estimated to be \u00a3220m\u00a0a year but invasive species\u00a0projects receive less than 1 per cent of that amount (\u00a30.9m).", "authors": ["Phoebe Weston"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/24/12/istock-1019958696.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
