Plato and Shakespeare and Proust are there, of course, but so are lesser-known figures, like Ivo Andric, a Yugoslav who won the 1961 Nobel Prize in Literature, and Taha Hussein, an important Egyptian writer and intellectual.\n\nMany in the literary world delighted in trying to decipher the meanings behind Professor Bloom\u2019s sometimes idiosyncratic choices. Some puzzled over his judgment, for example, that of all John Updike\u2019s considerable body of work, only the novel \u201cThe Witches of Eastwick\u201d would last. Professor Bloom\u2019s critics noted that Mr. Updike had once referred to Professor Bloom\u2019s writings as \u201ctorturous.\u201d Philip Roth, a friend of Professor Bloom\u2019s, garnered six mentions. Alice Walker was ignored altogether, but the poet J.D. McClatchy and the critics David Bromwich and Barbara Packer, all students of Professor Bloom\u2019s, made the cut.\n\nLater, in \u201cThe Anatomy of Influence\u201d \u2014 a 2011 book he called, prematurely, his \u201cvirtual swan song\u201d \u2014 Professor Bloom seemed to soften his canonical stance, conceding that a critic of any heritage is obliged to take seriously other traditions, including non-Western.\n\nThe spotlight he commanded as a powerful cultural figure did not always flatter him. In 1990, GQ magazine, in an article titled \u201cBloom in Love,\u201d portrayed him as having had intimate entanglements with female students. (\u201cA disgusting piece of character assassination,\u201d he was quoted as telling Mr. Begley in The Times Magazine.) And in a 2004 article in New York magazine, the writer Naomi Wolf wrote that he had once put his hand on her inner thigh when she was an undergraduate student. \u201cBeautiful, brilliant students surrounded him,\u201d she wrote. \u201cHe was a vortex of power and intellectual charisma.\u201d\n\nProfessor Bloom vigorously denied her accusation.\n\nThe clarity of his prose was also questioned. \u201cHarold is not a particularly good explainer,\u201d his friend the poet John Hollander once told The Times, adding, \u201cHe\u2019ll get hold of a word and allow this to generate a concept for him, but he\u2019s not in a position to say very clearly what he means and what he\u2019s doing.\u201d", "description": "Called the most notorious literary critic in America, Professor Bloom argued for the superiority of giants like Shakespeare, Chaucer and Kafka.", "authors": ["Dinitia Smith"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/15/obituaries/00Bloom3/00Bloom3-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
