Developed by Debayan Saha, who has also been a Global Biodesign Fellow at Stanford University. This device is attached with the exhaust of the vehicle. He claims that one car fitted with PM 2.5 can eliminate pollution released from 10 cars in its vicinity.\n\nHe said in a statement to PTI, \"The technology developed by us uses a combination of electric energy and wave energy to influence the pollutants like PM 2.5 such that they act like a magnet attracting other particulate pollutants from the ambient atmosphere to get attached to it. As they grow bigger in size they become heavy and fall off safely on the ground like soil,\"\n\nDon't Miss 696 SHARES 552 SHARES\n\nHe further added, \"One car on the street can now alleviate the pollution in its immediate environment, and potentially neutralize the pollution emitted from 10 cars in its vicinity. Diving really deep into the problem they found main culprit is not PM 2.5 but its tiny size because of which it can easily enter into our lungs and bloodstream.\"\n\nSaha plans to commercialise this product and is currently in talks with various organisations.\n\nReuters\n\nRecent research also revealed that air pollution is fastening the process of memory loss in people and ageing the brain by 10 years. One of the lead researchers stated, \"When it comes to remembering a string of words, a 50-year-old in polluted Chelsea performs like a 60-year-old in Plymouth.\"\n\nRecently, Delhi's air quality went down considerably. Even the Center-run System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR) advised people of the sensitive category to avoid morning walks and any other outdoor activities. Spike in pollution levels has also considerably risen the respiratory and eye-irritation problems in people.", "description": "Many cities across the globe are currently combating air pollution, and automotive vehicles are one of the main reasons for this.
