The C-17 crew\u2019s overnight stay at Trump\u2019s Turnberry resort in Scotland earlier this year, first reported by POLITICO on Friday, was not an isolated incident.\n\nIn September 2018, on its way back to the U.S. from Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, a unit of the Maine Air National Guard landed at Prestwick Airport, the airport closest to Trump\u2019s luxury waterfront resort. The crew and their passengers then spent the night at his hotel, according to one person who was present, an Instagram post and a voucher detailing the crew\u2019s itinerary reviewed by POLITICO.", "description": "", "authors": ["Politico.Com Story"], "top_image": ""}
