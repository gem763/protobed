Morgan.\n\nMatekja said that he cut his overweight rating on U.S. equities to neutral and he now believes \u201cthat international stocks will be an outperformer going forward,\u201d given that U.S. stocks are now relatively expensive after outperforming European stocks by 25% during the past two years.\n\n\u2018Eurozone is trading cheap,\u2019 Matejka said.\n\nFurthermore, he predicted that recent weakness in the European economy, reflected by weak readings in purchasing manager index (PMI) surveys, are set to rebound as monetary stimulus and the likely resolution of Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union drive business confidence and spending.\n\n\u201cFundamentally, we believe the long downtrend in Eurozone PMIs should be coming to an end,\u201d Matejka wrote. \u201cThe only time when Eurozone new orders were meaningfully weaker than current was during the great financial crisis crash, when credit markets stopped working and banks balance sheets were under pressure.\u201d\n\nRead More: Europe stocks end at new 22-month highs; HSBC slumps\n\nThat isn\u2019t the case this time around, Matejka argued, as \u201cthe latest ECB bank lending survey, out just last week, showed and improvement in lending standards.\u201d\n\nAnother important factor is the European Central Bank, which affirmed last week its plan to begin making net asset purchases of \u20ac20 billion a month as it resumes its quantitative easing strategy, aimed at keeping interest rates low and growing the money supply. \u201cThere is a positive, leading relationship between the [growth in eurozone money supply] and PMIs,\u201d such that money growth is \u201cpointing to an imminent rebound in PMIs,\u201d Matejka wrote.\n\nAnother force that could help to drive European equities in the quarters ahead is fiscal stimulus, usually defined as increased government spending and tax cuts. While European leaders, especially those in Germany, have resisted calls for more deficit spending, there is a clear case for increasing investment, given that many of these countries can borrow at negative interest rates.\n\n\u201cThe populist movements around the world are likely to drive more fiscal policy action in both regions, especially in Europe, which should allow the central banks to exit their extraordinary monetary policies and help valuations to rise,\u201d wrote Lisa Shalett, chief investment officer at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, in a Monday note to clients.\n\nAt his penultimate meeting last month, outgoing ECB President Mario Draghi declared that it was \u201chigh time for fiscal policy\u201d to boost Europe\u2019s flagging economy, as he cautioned about the limits of central bankers.\n\nOthers see reasons for optimism in the European labor market. \u201c[I] believe that Eurozone data is simply not as weak as the narrative spun by the media consensus, with the main exception of German exports,\u201d wrote Christopher Wood, head of global equity strategy at Jefferies, in a Sunday note. \u201cThe bulk of employment growth in France, Italy and Spain in recent quarters, for example, has been in permanent jobs as opposed to temporary ones, while wage growth in the Eurozone has also been accelerating.\u201d", "description": "European stocks have lagged behind their American cousins for years, but that may be about to change", "authors": ["Chris Matthews", "Markets Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS454_EUFLAG_ZG_20191002023428.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
