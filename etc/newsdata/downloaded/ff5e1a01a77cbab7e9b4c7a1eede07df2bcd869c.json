America's premier basketball league, the NBA, has more than 800 million viewers in China, generating well in excess of $US1 billion ($1.5 billion) in revenue for its US owners.\n\n\"Nike promotes itself as a so-called social-justice champion, but when it comes to Hong Kong, it prefers checking its social conscience at the door,\" Mr Pence said.\n\nThe Vice President also hit out at some of the league's biggest stars and team owners for \"siding with the Chinese Communist Party and silencing free speech\".\n\n\"The NBA is acting like a wholly owned subsidiary of the authoritarian regime.\"\n\nIn a pointed remark aimed squarely at the professed support among a growing number of American companies for centre-left social causes, Mr Pence warned: \"A progressive corporate culture that willfully ignores the abuse of human rights is not progressive - it's repressive.\"\n\n\"America is reaching out our hand to China and we hope that soon Beijing will reach back, this time with deeds not words.\" \u2014 Mike Pence\n\nThe timing of Mr Pence's remarks are coming under careful scrutiny. As the Trump administration's most senior overtly hawkish figure on China he has been forced to pull his horns in on numerous occasions this year for fear of derailing the trade talks.\n\nHe postponed a speech on China in June ahead of a meeting of leaders in Asia aimed at getting the trade talks back on track.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, hopes have been rising over prospects for a so-called \"phase one\" deal between Mr Trump and China's president Xi Jinping in Chile next month.\n\nWhile Mr Pence accused China of becoming \"even more aggressive and destabilising\" since last year, he also insisted the US doesn't want to decouple from the world's second biggest economy.\n\n\"We stand with you, we are inspired by you. We urge you to stay on the path of non-violent protest,\" Pence said of the protesters in Hong Kong. AP\n\n\"The United States does not seek confrontation with China. We seek a level playing field, open markets, fair trade and a respect for our values,\" he said. Mr Pence added that Mr Trump is still \"optimistic\" a deal can be made.\n\n\"America is reaching out our hand to China and we hope that soon Beijing will reach back, this time with deeds not words, and with renewed respect for America.\"\n\nHe said that over the last few years Beijing has increased its interventions in Hong Kong and \"engaged in actions that curtail the rights and liberties that Hong Kong\u2019s people were guaranteed through a binding international agreement\".\n\nHe said the United States stands with the protesters in Hong Kong.\n\n\"We stand with you, we are inspired by you. We urge you to stay on the path of non-violent protest,\" Pence said.", "description": "\"The NBA is acting like a wholly owned subsidiary of the authoritarian regime.\" Mike Pence slams US companies for trying to appease China's human rights abuses.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2708%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_60/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/72b44932705fcd891c9ff8fd4abbcca04b52abe2", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
