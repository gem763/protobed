This is when a criminal tricks their victim into sending money directly from their savings to an account which the criminal controls.\n\nIn the first half of the year, APP fraud losses totalled \u00a3208m in 58,000 cases - the vast majority of victims being individuals, rather than businesses. The number of cases was 69% higher, and losses 40% higher than the same period a year earlier. However, banks said there were better records of these scams being made by banks, and victims were more likely to come forward.\n\nOnly \u00a339m (19%) of this was refunded by the banks. Until recently, banks considered payments to have been agreed to by victims, so would not automatically refund the money as they would in other types of fraud, such as when debit card details were compromised.\n\nNew code\n\nIn May, a group of the biggest banks agreed to a new voluntary code which included a new set of criteria to judge whether the customer should get the money back. It is proposed that the compensation would come from a central pot gathered from a transaction fee on all bank transfers over \u00a330 and paid by those banks signed up to the scheme.\n\nNow any victim who has taken reasonable care, or has any element of vulnerability, is much more likely to receive a refund of the lost money. A victim who has been \"grossly negligent\" will not be reimbursed.\n\nHaving only launched in May, the effect of the scheme is yet to be seen in the fraud figures which cover the first half of the year.\n\nOne bank - TSB - has broken ranks in announcing a guarantee that it would automatically refund all \"innocent\" customers who have been defrauded.\n\nHowever, other banks have suggested that a blanket refund policy would simply encourage fraudsters to try their luck.", "description": "Romance scams rose by 64% in the first half of the year, figures show, as fraudsters target victims directly.", "authors": ["Kevin Peachey", "Personal Finance Reporter"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/CAEA/production/_108964915_elspet.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
