Volumes at Union Pacific were also lower in the first and second quarters.\n\nHigher shipments from industrial customers in the latest period were more than offset by weaker shipments for agricultural goods, energy products and higher-value items, the company said.\n\nUnion Pacific, based in Omaha, Neb., reported a quarterly profit of $1.56 billion, or $2.22 a share, compared with $1.59 billion, or $2.15 a share, the year earlier. Analysts predicted $2.31 a share in adjusted profit, according to FactSet.\n\nRevenue fell 7% from the year earlier to $5.52 billion, less than the $5.67 billion forecast by Wall Street analysts.\n\nRailroads operating in the U.S. are wrestling with a series of challenges, including trade tensions that have damped Chinese purchases of agricultural products, lower demand from utilities for thermal coal and a slowing manufacturing sector.\n\nU.S. railroads hauled about 21.3 million carloads and intermodal units during the first 41 weeks of the year, down 4% compared with the comparable period in 2018, according to the Association of American Railroads.\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 17, 2019 08:43 ET (12:43 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
