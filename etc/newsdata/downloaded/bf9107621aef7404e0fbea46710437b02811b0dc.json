However, last month, the national average rent decreased for the first time in two years.\n\nThat's according to apartment listing site Rent Cafe's September 2019 Apartment Market Report, which found that the national average dropped 0.1% to $1,471 from August. National rents also saw the slowest year over year growth (3.2%) in 13 months.\n\nWhile small, the decrease could be a good sign for renters: It may signal slightly lower rent prices going forward, according to data from real estate intelligence source Yardi Matrix.\n\nThat's true even in major cities: \"Since last month, apartment rents saw minor declines in more than half of the cities we analyzed,\" the report says. \"Small and large cities lead the trend, with prices dropping in 59% of small cities and 56% of large cities.\"\n\nIf you are looking to find more affordable rent in a major metro area, it's possible. Here are 13 cities where the average apartment rent sits below the national average of $1,471 per month, according to the Rent Cafe report.", "description": "Apartment listing site Rent Cafe released its Apartment Market Report for September 2019 with news that the national average rent went down for the first time in two years.", "authors": ["Anna Hecht"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106188189-1571343816592gettyimages-9108440221.jpg?v=1571343896", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
