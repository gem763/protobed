The ground is dry. It's been dry for a while here as we've come through summer,\" Lindner said. \"The initial parts of this rainfall will go toward saturating the ground.\"\n\nKen Graham, director of the National Hurricane Center, said the Houston area and parts of the upper Texas coast and East Texas could get significant rainfall through Thursday as the storm moves north. Imelda's rain bands were also stretching into Louisiana.\n\nThe weather center said flash flood watches were in effect for Southeast Texas and extreme southwest Louisiana, though additional weakening was forecast for the next two days.\n\nCBS Houston affiliate KHOU-TV reported some of the areas of heaviest rainfall were still sitting over the coastline and in the Gulf of Mexico Wednesday morning.\n\nWhile there could be some isolated structure flooding in the Houston area, widespread house flooding from Imelda \"doesn't look likely at this point,\" Lindner said.\n\nHowever, he said residents who live in flood prone areas should still be mindful and take extra precautions.\n\nOfficials in the Houston area were preparing high-water vehicles and staging rescue boats Tuesday.\n\nAt of early Wednesday morning, there were no widespread reports of high water on freeways or in structures, KHOU said.\n\nThe Galveston school district was those that canceled Wednesday classes, the station noted.\n\nImelda is the first named storm to impact the Houston area since Hurricane Harvey, according to the National Weather Service. Harvey dumped nearly 50 inches of rain on parts of the flood prone-city in August 2017, flooding more than 150,000 homes in the Houston area and causing an estimated $125 billion in damage in Texas.\n\nThe system, which formed Tuesday, quickly made landfall as a tropical storm near Freeport, Texas, with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph, then weakened just as quickly to a tropical depression. Some parts of Harris County and neighboring Galveston County had already received about 4 inches of rain through Tuesday afternoon.", "description": "Forecasters say the flood-prone city and Galveston could get up to foot-and-half of rain in some spots from the tropical depression, which was once a tropical storm", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/18/3cb45621-1c2f-4a06-b1a5-195908cc6f32/thumbnail/1200x630/75396b05cf2a7870e4a357c553c6c61e/stuck-suv-houston-flooding-tropical-depression-imedla-091819.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
