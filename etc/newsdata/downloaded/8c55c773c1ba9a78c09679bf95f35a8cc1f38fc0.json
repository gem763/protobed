Saudis Race to Restore Oil Output After Crippling Aramco Attack\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Saudi Arabia is racing to restore oil production after a brazen drone strike on a key Aramco facility slashed its output by half, or about 5% of world supply, an assault that the U.S. has blamed on Iran.\n\nState energy producer Saudi Aramco lost about 5.7 million barrels per day of output after 10 unmanned aerial vehicles on Saturday struck the world\u2019s biggest crude-processing facility in Abqaiq and the kingdom\u2019s second-biggest oil field in Khurais, the company said.\n\nThe attack will likely rattle oil markets and cast a shadow on Aramco\u2019s preparations for what could be the world\u2019s biggest stake sale. It\u2019s also set to escalate a showdown pitting Saudi Arabia and the U.S. against Iran, which backs proxy groups from Yemen to Iran and Lebanon.\n\nThe disruption is \u201cquite significant,\u201d Mele Kyari, chief executive officer of state producer Nigerian National Petroleum Corp., told Bloomberg Television on Sunday. \u201cIf it\u2019s protracted it could be a big challenge for the oil markets.\u201d\n\nThe attack is the biggest on Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil infrastructure since Iraq\u2019s Saddam Hussein fired Scud missiles into the kingdom during the first Gulf War. The damage highlights the vulnerability of the Saudi industry that supplies 10% of the world\u2019s . The kingdon\u2019s benchmark stock index tumbled as much as 3.1% on Sunday in Riyadh.\n\nIran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen claimed responsibility for the attacks, but U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo blamed Iran directly without offering evidence for that conclusion. Iran\u2019s Foreign Ministry described Pompeo\u2019s remarks as \u201cblind and fruitless accusations.\u201d\n\nThe Houthis, who are fighting Saudi-backed forces in Yemen, have claimed responsibility for most of the strikes against Aramco installations.\n\nAramco Repairs\n\n\u201cWork is underway to restore production and a progress update will be provided in around 48 hours,\u201d said Amin Nasser, Aramco\u2019s president and chief executive officer. Aramco is working to compensate clients for some of the shortfall from its reserves.\n\nSaudi Aramco, which pumped about 9.8 million barrels a day in August, will be able to keep customers supplied for several weeks by drawing on a global storage network.\n\nThe Saudis hold millions of barrels in tanks in the kingdom itself, plus three strategic locations around the world: Rotterdam in the Netherlands, Okinawa in Japan, and Sidi Kerir on the Mediterranean coast of Egypt.\n\nU.S. Reserves\n\nThe U.S. Department of Energy said it\u2019s prepared to dip into the Strategic Petroleum Oil Reserves if necessary to offset any market disruption.\n\nSaudi Arabia, the biggest producer in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, has been leading the group in production cuts to mop up a surplus of crude in the market. So when half of Saudi Arabia\u2019s production is knocked out, the question is how long the disruption lasts.\n\n\u201cThe global economy can ill afford higher oil prices at a time of economic slowdown,\u201d Ole Hansen, head of commodities strategy at Saxo Bank A/S in Copenhagen, said in an emailed response to questions. So while a surge in prices driven by lower supply \u201cmay temporarily remove the focus on slowing demand, it could, if prolonged, potentially reduce demand growth expectations even more.\u201d", "description": "Saudis Race to Restore Oil Output After Crippling Aramco Attack", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEC490GP_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
