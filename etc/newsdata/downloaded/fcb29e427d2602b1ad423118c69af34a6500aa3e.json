According to the New York Times, the terms include the Sackler family paying $3 billion in cash over seven years and no admission of wrongdoing. The company will also dissolve into a new one that will still sell OxyContin \u2014 with the revenue going towards the plaintiffs. Furthermore, Purdue is expected to file for bankruptcy.\n\nThe Times described the agreement as \u201clandmark moment in the long-running effort to compel Purdue Pharma... to have their day of reckoning for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people from overdoses and the calamitous systemic costs.\u201d\n\nPurdue had a different take on the news.\n\n\u201cWhile Purdue Pharma is prepared to defend itself vigorously in the opioid litigation, the company has made clear that it sees little good coming from years of wasteful litigation and appeals,\u201d Purdue Pharma said in a statement to Yahoo Finance. \u201cThe people and communities affected by the opioid crisis need help now. Purdue believes a constructive global resolution is the best path forward, and the company is actively working with the state attorneys general and other plaintiffs to achieve this outcome.\u201d\n\n\u2018They\u2019re certainly going to be paying a great deal of money\u2019\n\nOn August 27, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) was ordered to pay $572 million to the state of Oklahoma. This came after a judge ruled that the company breached the state\u2019s public nuisance law by using \u201cfalse, misleading, and dangerous marketing campaigns [that] have caused exponentially increasing rates of addiction, overdose deaths, and Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome.\u201d\n\nFrank Huntley, who struggled with addiction, walks with Pill Man, a skeleton made from his oxycontin and methadone prescription bottles, along Pennsylvania Avenue August 30, 2019, in Washington, DC.

We are working with partners to find ways to help those in need.\u201d\n\nBetween Purdue Pharma and J&J, \u201cthey\u2019re certainly going to be paying a great deal of money,\u201d Michelle Mello, a law and health research and policy professor at Stanford University, told Yahoo Finance. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any doubt about that. I think the only question is whether they will manage to reach a global settlement ahead of the October trial. There will be a reckoning financially. They will also, if they have not done already, have to reckon with other marketing practices that need to change.\u201d\n\n\u2018A wave of a reckoning\u2019\n\nThere is growing resentment towards pharmaceutical companies across the country \u2014 a recent Gallup poll indicated that the pharmaceutical industry is the lowest-rated industry in the U.S.\n\nAs of August 30, 2019, 48 states and the District of Columbia have filed lawsuits against Purdue Pharma over the company\u2019s marketing practices related to opioids. In New York, is accused of using aggressive, sophisticated marketing strategies in addition to \u201can army of sales representatives and unbranded \u2018patient advocacy\u2019 websites\u201d to change opioid prescribing norms into the 2000s.\n\n48 states and D.C. have sued Purdue Pharma.
