Each time the Iraqi national, with his wife and three children \u2013 the youngest just four \u2013 have been forced to return.\n\nNow, as the weather worsens and makes conditions at sea more difficult, the family has turned to lorries, spending every night trying to board trucks in the hope that they can finally reach the UK.\n\nThe 42-year-old knows the risks of being stowed away in the trailer of a lorry are potentially fatal, as they were for 39 people found dead in Essex this week. But like others living in makeshift camps in northern France after fleeing persecution, he sees little choice.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

The criminal networks are often installed within the makeshift encampments, and are said to have significant influence over the choices of desperate refugees.\n\nA deterioration in conditions for displaced people in the region is said to have increased demand, pushing people into taking bigger risks to cross to Britain. Four people have died while making desperate attempts to cross the English Channel over the past three months, while the 39 deaths in Grays this week has placed a sharp focus on the dangers of people smuggling.\n\nThe overall numbers of people attempting unauthorised Channel crossings to the UK is more than 3,000 each month, with Home Office figures showing more than 35,000 attempts to cross were prevented by border force officials in northern France and Belgium alone last year.\n\nSalman and his family are currently sleeping in a nature reserve in Grande-Synthe, Dunkirk, where the conditions have been described by charities as the worst ever seen for refugees in the region. Until recently, there was no access to drinking water, forcing many to drink from a nearby lake.\n\nMedical professionals say levels of poor health and disease has surged among the displaced population since last month, when they were forced to move to the nature reserve following the unprecedented mass eviction of a nearby gym, which had been providing them with shelter and sanitation.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

The authority has never taken such radical measures. The police coming, taking the tents, leaving children in the rain, preventing charities from distributing food and clothes,\u201d says Mr Wallyn. \u201cThese people need help. We can\u2019t leave them like this, with nothing. It\u2019s absolutely outrageous.\u201d\n\nChloe Lorieux, programme coordinator of Doctors of the World, says the situation in Dunkirk is \u201cworse than ever\u201d, with the charity treating 40 to 60 people in the settlement each day for medical problems \u2013 double that of six weeks ago.\n\n\u201cThe conditions are so bad and when you don\u2019t have access and you don\u2019t have access to water, you can\u2019t be clean, and then wounds get dirty, and you become much more susceptible and it is harder to recover,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cLast week there wasn\u2019t even drinkable water. They were drinking from the lake. They need at least toilets and showers. And when your tents are removed every day, you have nothing to protect you from the weather, it\u2019s cold and wet, and that creates more infections.\u201c\n\nMs Lorieux says the constant evictions are also leading to a steep decline in mental health: \u201cPeople are exhausted and very stressed. They can never rest. They are always having to move. We see children are reacting badly, hyperactivity. They are tense. Some self-harming. They are disturbed.\u201d\n\nClaire Millot, general secretary of refugee charity Salam, echoes the claims that things were worse than they have ever been. She says: \u201cWe\u2019re going backwards because we had a situation like this 10 years ago, but there were between 30 and 70 people. Now there are 500 people.\n\n\u201cThey were making tea with lake water. It\u2019s frightening because there\u2019s also a huge police presence. They come several times per week. It\u2019s getting cold. We\u2019ve had awful rain. People are sick. It\u2019s completely inhuman.\u201d\n\nThirty miles away in Calais, where there are fewer families and more young men and unaccompanied minors, conditions are also at breaking point, with police carrying out constant evictions of any form of encampment.\n\n\u201cI need to go the illegal way because there is no chance,\u201d says 15-year-old Ahmed, from Afghanistan, who explains that he travelled to France alone after fleeing persecution from extremists in his country, and hopes to join his uncle in Britain.\n\nTo pursue his desperate bid to reach the country to reunite with his relative, the teenager is living a squalid existence alongside dozens of other unaccompanied minors. \u201cThere\u2019s no food, no water,\u201d he says. \u201cThe police come and take everything. They take our jackets. They spray us.\u201d\n\nMaddy Allen, field manager at Help Refugees, says tightening security measures in a bid to stop people making unauthorised Channel crossings was only pushing people to make more dangerous journeys.\n\n\u201cThe security measures in Calais and Dunkirk are getting tougher so people are taking alternative routes. It\u2019s going to continue if they keep making the safer and \u2018irregular\u2019 routes more dangerous and more difficult,\u201d she adds.\n\nThe Home Office said people forced to flee their countries should claim protection in the first safe country they enter, and said it offered legal routes for those who had been granted asylum elsewhere in Europe and had a relative in the UK", "description": "Salman and his family have set off across the Channel three times in the hope that this time they might make it to British shores.
