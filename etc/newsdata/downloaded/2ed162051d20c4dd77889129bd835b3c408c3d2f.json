(AP) - Former Sharks longtime captain Patrick Marleau is returning to San Jose where he is the franchise leader in five major categories, signing a one-year contract Wednesday.\n\nAn unrestricted free agent who is a three-time All-Star, Marleau recorded 84 points with 43 goals and 41 assists in 164 games over the past two seasons with the Maple Leafs.\n\nMarleau, who turned 40 last month, spent his initial 19 seasons with the Sharks and they made the playoffs in 17 of those years. Marleau served as captain from 2003-09. He will certainly be a fan favorite once more.\n\nHe ranks first in franchise history for points (1,082), goals (508), power-play goals (160), game-winning goals (98) and games played (1,493). His 574 assists are second-most in Sharks franchise history.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/tag/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Former Sharks longtime captain Patrick Marleau is returning to San Jose where he is the franchise leader in five major categories, signing a one-year contract Wednesday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
