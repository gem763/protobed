It\u2019s vlog city time, vlog time with your boys Christian and JB\u2019 before mirroring the boys\u2019 inspirational message to fans by saying: \u2018It\u2019s not what you do, it\u2019s who you are.\u2019\n\nWhile at the time some fans thought Justin may have been shading Logan, it appears that the YouTuber actually took the reference from the Sorry hit-maker as a compliment and, since then, the two have struck up some sort of friendship.\n\nOlajide William Olatunji aka KSI and Logan Paul have been trash talking each other for some time and now celebs like Justin Bieber are taking sides. (Picture: Michael Tran/Getty Images)\n\nThe pair have been supportive of one another and their work for some time now. Justin first weighed in on Logan and KSI\u2019s ongoing feud by backing Logan in his Instagram comments in August earlier this year, before urging Logan to \u2018rip KSI\u2019s head off\u2019 in September.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA little dramatic perhaps, but still, it\u2019s clear Justin is gunning for Logan in the tense showdown to come.\n\nUnderstandably, KSI was less than impressed with Bieber\u2019s barbs, telling TMZ Sport earlier this month: \u2018I hope Justin Bieber\u2019s gonna be ringside, so after I knock out Logan, I can be like, \u2018Whose head was gonna get ripped off?!? You p***k.\u2019\u2019\n\nKSI does not count himself a Justin Bieber fan (Picture: Gotham/GC Images)\n\nWell what do you know, it appears the Biebs will be ringside at the match, as Logan sent a shout-out this week to his friends, family and fans that will be attending the fight, confirming that Justin will be in attendance and will be sitting in prime position for the event \u2013 next to the YouTube star\u2019s parents.\n\n\u2018There\u2019s going to be some big celebrities coming, I think Bieber is coming. I\u2019m gonna place him next to my mother and father,\u2019 Logan said.\n\nLogan\u2019s support for Justin goes beyond just inviting him to watch him fight though. Just this week, Logan Paul shared a post to his Stories on Instagram, showing support for Justin\u2019s music ahead of his potential new album release before Christmas.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t look like the pals were close enough for Logan to secure an invite to Justin\u2019s star-studded wedding to Hailey Bieber earlier this month however, but perhaps the YouTuber would have been too busy training for the fight to attend anyway.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMORE: Everything we know so far about Logan Paul and KSI\u2019s boxing rematch after last year\u2019s draw\n\nMORE: Jake Paul spars with no one as he practices karate moves on camera ahead of Logan Paul and KSI rematch", "description": "Logan Paul revealed that Justin Bieber will be in the audience to watch his hugely-anticipated boxing fight again fellow internet star KSI.", "authors": ["Rachael Martin"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/logan-paul-and-justin-bieber_1572431532.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
