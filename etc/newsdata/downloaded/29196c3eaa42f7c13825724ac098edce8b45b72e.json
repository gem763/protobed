It is time to reclaim our independence.\n\n\"Our job is to deliver independence. My call is that the referendum must happen next year. And we are getting ready,\" she added, to cheers from members of the SNP, Scotland's main political party.\n\nAs the law stands, to hold another referendum legally, Scotland would need the permission of the British government in Westminster.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said it would be \"totally wrong\" to hold another referendum, and that to hold a vote, the UK government would need to transfer powers to Scotland's devolved parliament where Sturgeon sits.\n\nSturgeon said she would demand those powers, under Section 30 of the Scotland Act, to ensure any vote was legal.\n\n\"Before the end of this year, I will demand the transfer of power that puts the legality of a referendum beyond any doubt,\" she said.\n\nThe SNP has often expressed its sympathy for the cause of Catalan separatists. On Monday, Spain's Supreme Court jailed nine Catalan separatist leaders for their role in a failed independence bid. [nL5N26Z134]\n\nSturgeon said that though she understood the importance of the rule of law, \"any law that sends politicians to prison for organizing a vote is a law that surely needs to change.\"\n\nShe added: \"the politicians and activists from Catalonia... are peaceful campaigners for the right to self-determination just like we are.\"", "description": "Britain as a whole voted in 2016 to leave the European Union but Scotland voted to remain.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106182597-1571155301352gettyimages-1176004272.jpeg?v=1571155338", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
