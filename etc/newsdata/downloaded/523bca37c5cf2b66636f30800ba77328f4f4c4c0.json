REUTERS/Morteza Nikoubazl/File Photo\n\nDUBAI (Reuters) - Iranian Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Thursday European countries were unlikely to help Iran against U.S. sanctions, and Tehran \u201cshould give up all hope\u201d in that regard, according to his official website.\n\nBritain, France and Germany, parties to a 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, have tried to set up a trade mechanism to barter humanitarian and food goods with Iran after the United States withdrew from the deal last year and re-imposed sanctions. But the mechanism is still not operational.\n\nIran has repeatedly said it will ramp up its nuclear activities unless the European countries do more to protect its economy from the impact of the U.S. sanctions.\n\nRelated Coverage Pompeo has no comment on possibility of U.S.-Iran prisoner swap\n\n\u201cDespite their promises, the Europeans have practically adhered to America\u2019s sanctions and have not taken any action and are unlikely to do anything for the Islamic Republic in the future. So one should give up all hope on Europeans,\u201d Khamenei was quoted as saying.\n\n\u201cThere should be no trust in countries that have held the banner of hostility to (Iran\u2019s) Islamic system, led by the United States and some European countries, because they are openly hostile to the Iranian people,\u201d Khamenei said.\n\n\u201cThe road to interaction and negotiations is open to all countries other than America and the Zionist regime (Israel),\u201d Khamenei told members of a powerful clerical body.", "description": "Iranian Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Thursday European countries were unlikely to help Iran against U.S. sanctions, and Tehran \"should give up all hope\" in that regard, according to his official website.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1434110995&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P0V9", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
