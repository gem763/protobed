Actually, you wouldn\u2019t have seen any before Zelensky, the former TV comedian who played an accidental president only to be elected for real in May, and by a landslide. Witnesses said the scene was like a \u201cmedicine\u201d for people in the strategic port city, which has buried hundreds of civilians and soldiers in the past five years of war.\n\nJust a few weeks ago the 41-year-old Zelensky won his office by declaring he was a tough leader coming to break the old molds in Ukraine\u2019s domestic and foreign policy, and since the day of his inauguration the list of radical decisions has been growing. Zelensky dissolved the parliament and sent a clear message to Moscow about its incursions in the east of the country since 2014: both \u201cDonbass and Crimea are Ukraine,\u201d he declared unequivocally, even though Russian President Vladimir Putin has annexed Crimea.\n\nZelensky quickly fired Ukraine\u2019s top officials, appointing instead young, reliably loyal friends of his to the key positions.\n\nHis critics said that it was a new style of cronyism, doubting that his new people with little or no experience in public office could handle important decisions, expose billion-dollar corruption, and investigate dozens of murders committed during the Ukrainian revolution of 2014, as well as other major crimes. But Zelensky continued to appoint people he could trust.\n\nZelensky has defined two wars in Ukraine, \u201cthe war with Russia and the war with corruption.\u201d During his meetings in France and Germany this week, Zelensky focused on ending the war in Donbass and bringing dozens of Ukrainian prisoners back home. If that did not work, he called to expand the mechanism of sanctions against Russia. \u201cThe strategic course of Ukraine to achieve full-fledged membership in the E.U. and NATO, which is secured in the constitution of Ukraine, remains unchanged,\u201d he said at a meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg earlier this month.\n\nThe war on corruption promises to be tough and long. Last month in a Delaware court Ukraine\u2019s Privat Bank filed a suit against Zelensky\u2019s longtime business partner, Ihor Kolomoisky, for \u201chundreds of millions of dollars,\u201d accusing the oligarch of \u201cunjust enrichment\u201d in \u201ca series of brazen fraudulent schemes.\u201d\n\nUkraine\u2019s first lady, Olena Zelenskaya, admitted to The Daily Beast that her husband was upset about the accusations against his former business partner, the patron of the television network where he made his fame. But she insisted that President Zelensky was independent from the oligarch. \u201cVolodymyr is never going to be anybody\u2019s puppet,\u201d she said.\n\nIn spite of recommendations from Washington\u2019s special envoy for Ukraine, Kurt Walker, Zelensky appointed his 42-year-old aide on legal issues, Andrei Bogdan, to be head of the presidential administration. He made his childhood friend, Ivan Bakanov, the acting head of the SBU, the Security Service of Ukraine.\n\nIt is still a question when, if ever, Zelensky is going to negotiate peace with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Moscow has made it clear that it will not accept Ukraine integrating fully with the E.U. and NATO, and for now Moscow is accusing Ukraine of \u201caggression.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday the editor-in-chief of Russia Today, Margarita Simonyan, said that Ukraine had conducted a denial of service attack on Moscow\u2019s call center for Putin\u2019s annual question and answer session.\n\nIn a gesture respected by many in Kiev, Zelensky did not welcome attempts by Donald Trump\u2019s lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, to politicize Ukraine\u2019s investigations of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and, in a separate case, former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s son, Hunter Biden.\n\nYuliya Mostovaya, editor of Mirror Weekly and a wise analyst of Ukraine\u2019s politics for three decades, told The Daily Beast that Zelensky is still enjoying \u201cthe lightness of being\u201d with no memory of Soviet, post-Soviet, or even post-revolutionary intrigues in the government. \u201cYes, maybe he does not realize the scale of responsibility, yet, but to every splash of criticism I want to say, \u2018Maybe that\u2019s the way to do it.\u2019\u201d\n\nAfter the Giuliani episode, says Mostovaya, she understands Zelensky\u2019s desire to keep Ukraine from being \u201ccrushed between the millstones of America\u2019s 2020 presidential election; his priority now is to figure out the piles of issues at home.\u201d But, she cautioned, \u201cTrump\u2019s allies will not give up their attempts to drag Ukraine into their political game.\u201d\n\nWithout thinking much about consequences, Trump\u2019s lawyer named Kiev politician Serhiy Leschenko one of the \u201cenemies of Donald Trump\u201d\u2014a serious accusation targeting one of Ukraine\u2019s most articulate democrats.\n\nLeschenko notes that Giuliani was working with Prosecutor General Yuriy Lutsenko, whose dismissal has been announced by Zelensky and \u201cwho\u2019s been lying to Washington.\u201d The claim about Joe Biden is that he asked for a case against Burisma Holding to be closed. Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, served on its board. \u201cThat is not true,\u201d Leschenko told The Daily Beast. \u201cIt was Lutsenko who closed the case, himself. Lutsenko has also been lying to Giuliani about the \u2018fraudulent\u2019 corruption case against Manafort.\u201d\n\nThe Giuliani affair was outgoing President Petro Poroshenko\u2019s \u201clegacy\u201d for the new team in power, Mostovaya said. \u201cFirst Poroshenko thought he could make some political capital by dragging Ukraine in the U.S. politics on the Democrats\u2019 side, then backing Trump in order to silence American financial intelligence here in Ukraine and save his own capital and freedom.\u201d\n\nThere are indeed layers of issues in the legacy handed to Zelensky.\n\nOne of them is the debate about the state language, a beloved topic for Russia\u2019s propagandists, who blamed Poroshenko for welcoming bans on Russian-language culture, making it a cornerstone of the artificially created conflict in Donbass.\n\nIn one sweeping statement, Zelensky liberated his people from tensions around that issue: he spoke Russian in Mariupol, the language majority of people speak in eastern regions of Ukraine. \u201cYou are the city of great warriors, great people, great Ukrainians,\u201d he told his audience there last weekend. \u201cTo be honest, it does not matter to me what language you speak, you are always Ukrainians, we all understand each other; I am convinced that no propaganda will ever influence you and me.\u201d\n\nLocal businessmen and activists met with the president to see if he was a man of action, not just of big words. Galina Odnorog, a local politician and entrepreneur, had a chance to speak with Zelensky in her usual straightforward manner, rolling out a problem after problem.\n\n\u201cZelensky\u2019s eyes widened when I told him that Mariupol cannot provide its own bread for our citizens, thanks to the corrupt schemes in law enforcement agencies,\u201d Odnorog told The Daily Beast. \u201cHe immediately ordered Interior Minister Arsen Avakov to help me solve the problem.\u201d\n\nOdnorog said she had tears in her eyes when she saw her country\u2019s president, soaking wet, playing with local kids in the fountain. Since 2014, Odnorgog, a volunteer leader, has been providing food and ammunition for soldiers on the front lines, medicine for wounded in the hospitals.\n\n\u201cI was amazed to see how easy it was to deal with Zelensky,\u201d she said. \u201cOf course his critics and opponents are not going to let their grip go easily. We\u2019ll see if his ministers fulfill his orders. But for now we want to celebrate the moment: it feels like Zelensky is a healer of our wounds.\u201d", "description": "Volodymir Zelensky is vowing to break the old molds\u2014from his personal appearance and the people he\u2019s appointing, to his hard pro-NATO stance and speaking Russian in East Ukraine.", "authors": ["Anna Nemtsova"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1561149857/190621-nemtsova-ukraine-tease_tj1pe5", "published_at": "2019-06-22"}
