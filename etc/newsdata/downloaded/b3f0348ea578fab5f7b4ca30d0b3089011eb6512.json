Police are unsure where the lingerie came from.\n\n'I'll never forget that sight,' Eshcrich said. 'The whole premise of somebody in my house in my bathroom changing into lingerie \u2014 it's extremely unnerving as you could imagine.'\n\nCourt records show that McGuire has a history of sexual deviance charges dating back to his time as an active duty service member at Fort Hood in the early 2000s.\n\nMcGuire was taken into custody later Saturday morning after leading police K9s on a chase through the neighborhood. Police lent him some shorts as he was completely nude\n\nHe masturbated publicly in several convenience and department stores including K-Mart and Walmart, where he once 'approached a woman, and, while standing close to her and smiling, exposed his penis and masturbated,' according to court documents reported by Oxygen.\n\nIn another instance in 2003, McGuire was accused of fondling himself in the toy and cosmetic sections of a Target.\n\n'He went into the toy department of a Target department store, pulled out his penis, and masturbated,' court documents stated.\n\n'He then went to the cosmetics aisle of the store, exposed his penis and masturbated until he ejaculated,' the documents state.\n\nMcGuire is seen being taken into custody. Court records show that he has a history of sexual deviancy, including fondling himself in the toy and cosmetic sections of a Target\n\n'Afterward, he rubbed his semen into the carpet with his foot and wiped his hands on the wall and a piece of clothing from a nearby cart,' the documents recount.\n\nA military judge in Texas sentenced him to 10 months confinement and a bad-conduct discharge from the Army related to the series of indecent exposures.\n\nA psychiatrist at the time diagnosed McGuire with substance abuse issues and 'exhibitionism.'\n\nAfter his arrest on Saturday, McGuire was charged with burglary and indecent exposure with a prior, both felonies, as well as misdemeanor counts of prowling on private property and trespassing.\n\nHe is being held in the Placerville Jail pending bond of $129,000. It was not immediately clear whether he has an attorney to speak on his behalf.", "description": "Shaun Derrick McGuire, 37, was arrested early on Saturday after leading officers on a foot pursuit in\u00a0El Dorado Hills, California, a quiet suburb on the eastern outskirts of Sacramento.", "authors": ["Keith Griffith For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/21/19758598-0-image-a-2_1571172241749.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
