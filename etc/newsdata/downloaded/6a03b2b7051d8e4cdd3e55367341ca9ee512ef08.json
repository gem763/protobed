For the second time this trip, her dress -- this one a striped maxi by Martin Grant -- was recycled from a past appearance. She had previously worn the dress in October 2018 during an event on Bondi Beach in Australia.\n\nRoyal expert Katie Nicholl explained the significance behind the dress.\n\n\"This was one that we had seen her wear in Australia on her first overseas tour,\" she told Entertainment Tonight. \"We've seen her recycle a couple items of clothing, but this dress was significant because she stepped out in it just days after announcing her pregnancy, which I think has led to some speculation that 'Could we be hearing imminent news of another royal baby?'\"\n\n\"Well, it might be a little premature for that,\" she added. \"I can tell you, having seen Meghan very up close today that she looks incredibly trimmed, she looks incredibly fit and she is absolutely glowing! She is really happy to be here in South Africa and she looks absolutely beautiful.\"\n\nMeghan Markle and Prince Harry's tour of Africa will total 10 days and include visits to four different countries. They brought their son, Archie Harrison, 4 months, with them.", "description": "Duchess of Sussex Meghan Markle made light of a potentially awkward situation during  an engagement in Cape Town.", "authors": ["Gibson Johns"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/dGw31Tm6PZfVPk4O8MIySw--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMDI4O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims3/GLOB/crop/1159x760+258+47/resize/1028x675!/format/jpg/quality/85/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-09/c2f499d0-df18-11e9-b77f-14935ccd615d", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
