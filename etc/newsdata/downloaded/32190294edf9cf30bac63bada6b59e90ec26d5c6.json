Quinlivan walked in two of Chanel\u2019s fashion shows before coming out as transgender in 2017. This is a little piece of history for the company. She has been hired as the face of Chanel Beauty in ads.\n\nWhen I think of the House of Chanel, I think of the legendary Chanel suit, introduced by Coco Chanel in 1925. It was a simple wool suit but it was revolutionary at the time. I remember my mother wearing a modern version of the fashion classic, back in the day. Or, I think of the company\u2019s iconic double C logo. What I don\u2019t think about is a transgender woman applying their high-end make-up products.\n\nWe will be made to accept the transgender agenda whether we want to or not. I wrote that sentence at the beginning of August in a post I did about Victoria Secret\u2019s first transgender model. Here we are again, less than a month later. Another big name in the fashion industry bows to the new normal. Transgenderism is being normalized, primarily by the folks who align themselves with the party of science. The woke generation doesn\u2019t see the irony.\n\nQuinlivan wrote about being the first openly transgender model hired by Chanel on Instagram. She knew she would lose work when she went public and that is given as a reason for working for Chanel modeling fashion before she was honest with the company.\n\nAdditionally, Quinlivan reveals that she had walked in two shows for Chanel prior to coming out publicly as trans in 2017. \u201cWhen I came out I knew I\u2019d stop working with some brands\u2026 I thought I\u2019d never work with the iconic house of Chanel ever again,\u201d she says. And yet, here she is, the first openly trans model to appear in Chanel Beauty advertising. Quinlivan\u2019s post has already gotten a slew of likes and other positive feedback from fans and fellow models alike. \u201cAmazing. Congratulations darling!!\u201d comments Laverne Cox, and there are hundreds more where that came from.\n\nThe model\u2019s emotional announcement is being heralded by the media. She is 25 years old, from Boston, and is a perfect representative for the Millennials who believe in fluid sexuality and boys becoming girls and vice versa. In reality, science tells us that there are two genders \u2013 man or woman. Gender is binary if a person is going with science. If emotions define your world, I guess transgenderism is normal. Corporations are trying to stay out in front of cultural trends. It\u2019s easier to go along than to risk the wrath of a social media mob.\n\nSince coming out, Quinlivan has worked with brands including Milk Makeup, Porter Magazine, Louis Vuitton, Maison Margiela Fragrances and Redken. She\u2019s also been an outspoken advocate for transgender models and the #MeToo movement. \u201cThe world will kick you down, spit on you, and tell you you\u2019re worthless,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s your job to have the strength to stand up and push on, to keep fighting, Because if you give up then you will never experience the tears of triumph.\u201d\n\nUS magazine celebrated the Thursday announcement from Quinlivan by publishing a piece about \u201cfive things you have to know about this industry pioneer.\u201d One of the five things is the fact that Quinlivan came out to her mother at the age of 16 and claims she didn\u2019t even know about transgenderism at that age. I suppose that shows how far the agenda has come in just nine years. Today\u2019s high school age teens don\u2019t even bat an eye over transgenderism \u2013 it\u2019s just accepted.\n\nI do wonder what other make-up models think about her hiring. She worked for Milk Makeup, Redken, and Maison Margiela but I don\u2019t find any comments from other models about that. It seems to me that transgender models hired for these jobs that natural-born female models would expect to have will cause tension. It\u2019s like transgender athletics pushing their way into sports competitions. Transgender female athletes will always beat natural-born females and they are beginning to speak out about that. As they should.\n\nChanel can check the diversity box now and not worry about the outraged mob coming for them. At least not until the next thing. The dirty little secret about appeasing social justice warriors, whether under pressure to do so or just getting out in front, is that it is never enough.", "description": "Fashion history", "authors": ["Karen Townsend", "Ed Morrissey", "Taylor Millard", "John Sexton", "Andrew Malcolm"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/13d081d3-ca67-4afc-948a-f1fa2b0ce86b.jpg"}
