Did anybody get back to so-and-so? How is my stepdaughter adjusting to her apartment in New York City? Sometimes those early-morning moments are her only chance, as the junior Senator from California and a top Democratic presidential candidate, to think through the events of the past day.\n\n\u201cOh, I worry,\u201d she says, \u201cI worry.\u201d Sitting at a table upstairs from the stage where she\u2019s just held a town hall in Waterloo, Iowa, Harris begins to laugh, that deep, body-shaking laugh of hers. \u201cLet me just tell you, I was born worrying. I had a mother who worried, I had a grandmother who worried. It\u2019s kind of in my blood.\u201d\n\nThat jolt awake at 3 a.m. has become Harris\u2019 campaign theme, the crux of her wandering stump speech. What wakes the American people at 3 a.m., she says, is not ideological mudslinging but practical concerns: holding down a job, getting through a health crisis, weathering hurricanes and tornadoes. Harris\u2019 \u201c3 a.m. agenda,\u201d as she calls it, is the backbone of her campaign\u2019s policy approach, a road map of solutions for the middle class. But so far it has failed to get much traction. At a time when the electorate is looking for sharp definitions and ambitious visions, her emphasis strikes some Democrats as vague and noncommittal.\n\nAnd so Harris is here, in Iowa, trying to regain her footing in the race. After a promising start in January, her campaign has stalled. While she is in the competition for the nomination, she\u2019s stuck in the mid\u2013single digits in most national and early-state polls and draws modest crowds. Perhaps three dozen people showed up to see her in Waterloo, where they were packed into a few rows in front of the stage so that the large room\u2013an ornate century-old former department store\u2013wouldn\u2019t look so empty.\n\nIn mid-September, Harris said she\u2019d be focusing on the first-to-vote caucus state. It was something of an unwitting announcement: she was overheard in Washington joking to a colleague, \u201cI\u2019m f-cking moving to Iowa.\u201d (At least, a staffer quipped, \u201cshe didn\u2019t say, \u2018I\u2019m moving to f-cking Iowa.'\u201d) Her campaign is doubling its staff in the state, to more than 130 people, and she has pledged to visit every week for the foreseeable future. \u201cI\u2019m really excited about it,\u201d she tells me, saying the opportunity to engage in \u201cold-school retail politics\u201d reminds her of her San Francisco political roots. \u201cI like people.\u201d\n\nPhotograph by Nolwen Cifuentes for TIME\n\nPeople like Harris too; they just can\u2019t quite place her. Like the acquaintance you recognize but can\u2019t recall how you met, she seems both familiar and yet mysterious. Is she a liberal or a moderate, establishment or populist, reformer or radical? Critics point out that she has flip-flopped or obfuscated her positions on important policy issues, like health care and immigration, and the speeches she could use to define herself often devolve into paeans to unity.\n\nFor all that, however, Harris remains in the hunt. She consistently polls among the top five candidates in the jumbled Democratic field, and she has the financial resources to remain viable. Her campaign raised $11.6 million in the quarter ending Sept. 30\u2013a respectable haul, although far short of what some other front runners pulled in. As more long-shot candidates bow out of the race, campaign officials expect Harris to benefit from voters\u2019 renewed focus. With a little luck, they say, she still has a fairly clear path to the nomination.\n\nAmong the top-polling Democrats, some churn seems inevitable. Former Vice President Joe Biden remains the apparent front runner, but his unsteady debate performances and shambling campaign have many insiders convinced he\u2019s on the brink of collapse. When and if that happens, the next leading candidates, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, could face a rebellion from mainstream Democrats who see them as too left-wing. In such a world, Harris would be well positioned as the alternative: a practical idealist with undeniable political skills and a respected track record of problem-solving rather than grandstanding. As a 54-year-old black woman, she also offers a compelling profile for Democrats hungry for diversity and fresh faces. Among the top-tier candidates, who also include Pete Buttigieg, she is one of two women and the only person of color. And she\u2019s younger than the three septuagenarian front runners by a decade and a half.\n\nMeanwhile, as the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives moves toward impeachment, another piece of Harris\u2019 record may supercharge her candidacy in the coming months: her background in law enforcement. At a time when liberals are clamoring to make the criminal-justice system less punitive, her record as a district attorney and state attorney general has been a liability. But in this new political climate, voters may relish the idea of seeing Harris\u2013with her icy prosecutor\u2019s glare\u2013square off against President Trump on the national stage.\n\n\u201cThis guy has completely trampled on the rule of law, avoided consequence and accountability under law,\u201d she says of the President. \u201cFor all the sh-t people give me for being a prosecutor, listen. I believe there should be accountability and consequence.\u201d\n\nSeptember Dawn Bottoms for TIME\n\nHarris lives in Los Angeles now, where her husband of five years, entertainment lawyer Douglas Emhoff, is based. L.A. is only the latest of many places she\u2019s put down roots, she tells me in an interview in a law office on the city\u2019s west side. But home, to her, always conjures memories of a Berkeley duplex where she lived with her mother and sister above a nursery school.\n\nBorn in Oakland, Harris had an itinerant childhood, moving from California to Illinois to Wisconsin to Montreal as her parents pursued academic careers. Her mother and father were both immigrants who came to the U.S. to attend the University of California, Berkeley. Shyamala Gopalan, Harris\u2019 mother, came from India to get a Ph.D. in nutrition and endocrinology, while Donald Harris, her father, came from Jamaica to study economics. As a result, most of Harris\u2019 family members were overseas. She learned, like many children of immigrants, that family and community aren\u2019t necessarily something you are born into; they are something you make. Her memories are replete with references to surrogate grandmas and second mothers, godparents and godchildren, aunts and uncles, none of whom are related.\n\nHarris\u2019 parents met in the 1960s in the civil rights movement. Both were members of a small group of students who met to discuss black consciousness and liberation. They were unabashedly radical: the group\u2019s heroes were \u201cMalcolm, Fidel, Che,\u201d says Aubrey LaBrie, a leader of the group. Some in the group were involved in the founding of the Black Panther Party, he says. Now in his 80s, with graying braids and a voice made hoarse by Parkinson\u2019s, LaBrie remembers Harris\u2019 parents as committed activists, joining in a protest of the local Woolworth\u2019s to express solidarity with a sit-in at a segregated lunch counter at a Woolworth\u2019s in the South. Gopalan, who died of cancer in 2009, was \u201cvery feisty, strong-willed, very assertive,\u201d he says.\n\nSeptember Dawn Bottoms for TIME\n\nHarris recalls being steeped in her parents\u2019 activism. In speeches, she says she remembers being surrounded by \u201ca bunch of adults who spent all their time marching and shouting\u2013for justice!\u201d Once, she told me, she came down the stairs of her childhood house in Berkeley to see free bobby carved in wet cement, after the Black Panther leader Bobby Seale was arrested.\n\nShe was also on the front lines in her own way. In 1970, when she entered first grade, Harris was in the second class of children to be bused across town to integrate an elementary school that had previously been 95% white. It was a 40-minute journey each way. She did not, at the time, understand that she was a pawn in grownups\u2019 sociopolitical experimentation\u2013a lack of trauma that, she jokes, presents a challenge in politics. \u201cPeople are like, \u2018Tell us your suffering, tell us how hard it was,'\u201d she says. \u201cBut I was raised by proud people. I was raised to know and believe we had everything we needed.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s easy to see how this upbringing shaped Harris\u2019 standing as an outsider\u2013someone who had to convince others she belonged, no matter where she was. But she was the kind of outsider who was determined to get inside. She was always trying to find commonalities, even as she was aware of the difficulty of making herself understood in different contexts. \u201cThe reality is that when you are the so-called minority,\u201d she says, \u201cyou learn many languages, necessarily.\u201d\n\nWhile others, including her own mother and sister, a former American Civil Liberties Union leader, sought to protest and advocate from outside, Harris worked to find her way into institutions where no one like her had ever been in charge. After graduating from Howard University, the historically black college in Washington, D.C., and the University of California\u2019s Hastings College of the Law, she became a prosecutor, first at the DA\u2019s office in Oakland\u2019s Alameda County and then in San Francisco. In 2003, when Harris announced she would run for San Francisco DA against her former boss, many of her liberal friends balked. Lateefah Simon, who had worked with Harris to get police and prosecutors to treat underage girls in the sex trade as victims rather than criminals, remembers telling Harris she was disappointed by her decision. But Harris was unfazed. \u201cShe\u2019d say, \u2018Are you going to be outside all the time with a bullhorn, or are you going to be inside, deeply in the face of folks with decisionmaking power?'\u201d Simon remembers. To Harris, Simon recalls, the way to make change was not to protest the system, but to take it over.\n\nCourtesy of Kamala Harris\n\nHarris\u2019 underdog campaign did better than expected. Partly as a result of her relationship with her former boyfriend Willie Brown, the legendary California politician who was then speaker of the state assembly, Harris had cultivated a strong fundraising base among the city\u2019s wealthy socialites. Brown, 30 years her senior and technically still married, had also appointed Harris to boards and introduced her to his political network when they were dating in the 1990s, sparking accusations of nepotism.\n\nBut Harris\u2019 campaign was also uniquely her own. She put down her headquarters in one of the city\u2019s poorest black neighborhoods, pounded the pavement and used an ironing board as a standing desk. She ran on a platform of restoring competence to the bumbling department and relentlessly criticized the incumbent for his low conviction rate for major crimes. She won in a landslide.\n\nThe law is written in black and white, but prosecutors have tremendous discretion to shape the way it is applied. It\u2019s a prosecutor who decides to put sex workers in jail while letting their customers off. It\u2019s a prosecutor who decides that a white teenager who kills is a good kid who deserves a second chance, but that a black teenager who commits the same crime is a predator who should be locked up for life. It\u2019s a prosecutor who often decides that a woman who reports rape just doesn\u2019t seem believable, even when there\u2019s physical evidence. It was a prosecutor who decided, in 2008, that Jeffrey Epstein deserved essentially house arrest for the serial sexual abuse of dozens of young women. Modern reformers seeking to curtail mass incarceration increasingly argue that no amount of policy reform will fix a system whose decisionmakers are vulnerable to certain blind spots. When Harris took over as DA, Simon remembers her pointing out all the framed photos of past DAs along a wall. The portraits were all of white men until her face appeared at the end of the line, a 40-year-old black woman.\n\nIt would not be easy to bring a new perspective inside the system. Just a few months into her tenure as San Francisco DA, a young gang member killed a San Francisco cop in the same rough neighborhood where she\u2019d headquartered her campaign. Harris, who had run on her opposition to capital punishment, announced she would not seek the death penalty. The decision sparked a major controversy that some thought would end her political career before it started. From the pulpit at the officer\u2019s funeral, both California\u2019s senior Senator, Dianne Feinstein, and the head of the police union called for the death penalty as Harris sat stunned in the audience. She stuck by her decision in the face of the firestorm, ultimately securing a sentence of life without parole.\n\nCourtesy of Howard University\n\nA couple of years later, as a wave of homicides swept the city, Harris again saw her convictions tested. While other elected officials proposed putting more cops on the street and beefing up gang enforcement, she wanted a new approach. \u201cInstead of just accepting these statistics and reacting, I asked my team to tell me, Who are the homicide victims under the age of 25?\u201d she says. Both the victims and the perpetrators, they discovered, had something in common: more than 90% were high school dropouts. Many started missing class in elementary school, quickly falling too far behind to ever catch up.\n\nSeeing an opening, Harris began sending notices to the families of chronically truant kids. In meetings, her office\u2019s representatives outlined the services that might help the family, but also reminded them that parents whose kids didn\u2019t go to school were committing a crime and could be subject to fines and arrest. Even some members of Harris\u2019 own staff considered her approach overly threatening to struggling families, but Harris blazed ahead. \u201cShe said to me, \u2018[People] will stop for a stray dog before they will stop for a black child alone in the middle of the day,'\u201d recalls Simon, the former colleague.\n\nThe thought of it still fills Harris with fury. \u201cPeople had no expectations from these children,\u201d she says. \u201cThey had no understanding of the capacity of these children. The system was not responding to what was in my mind a crisis. We improved attendance by over 30%. No parent ever went to jail. It was about what I could do, in my limited capacity, based on the position I had.\u201d The controversy still dogs Harris, however, Exhibit A for liberals who say she punished those she should have been trying to help.\n\nSeptember Dawn Bottoms for TIME\n\nWhen Simon expressed her doubts, Harris would remind her of all the funerals she\u2019d attended. For all the people you\u2019ve buried, was anybody ever held accountable? The women raped and left for dead on street corners, who is going to see them? \u201cBlack people want law enforcement,\u201d says Simon, who considers herself a prison abolitionist. \u201cWe just don\u2019t want them to kill our children.\u201d\n\nAfter two terms as DA, Harris ran for state attorney general, winning a close race against the Republican DA of Los Angeles. As attorney general, she went after big banks and the pharmaceutical industry, for-profit colleges and oil companies. She refused to defend the voter-approved Proposition 8 banning gay marriage, paving the way for the Supreme Court\u2019s 2015 decision legalizing it, and she created a bureau of children\u2019s justice to oversee children\u2019s services.\n\nBut she also backed down from many fights, declining to endorse ballot initiatives that would have reformed the three-strikes law and ended the death penalty. She even appealed a federal court decision striking down the death penalty as unconstitutional, successfully reinstating a penalty she claimed to oppose.\n\nCriminal-justice reformers charge that Harris is cautious at best and hypocritical at worst, an ambitious pol who wants to have it both ways and lacks the guts to pursue bold reforms. A new wave of progressive DAs like Philadelphia\u2019s Larry Krasner has gone much further than Harris ever did, with initiatives like restricting the use of cash bail, which reformers say unfairly penalizes the poor while allowing the rich to buy their way out of jail. \u201cThere\u2019s sort of a laundry list for what it means to be a progressive prosecutor, and she doesn\u2019t check a single one of the boxes,\u201d says Lara Bazelon, a professor at the University of San Francisco School of Law. \u201cAt least she didn\u2019t when she was an actual prosecutor and she was in a position to do something to make the system more fair.\u201d\n\nHarris, Bazelon notes, dismissed the idea of legalizing marijuana as recently as 2014, but now that it\u2019s popular she supports it. \u201cThat seems to be a theme: once she\u2019s not in any sort of political risk, and there\u2019s a consensus that a reform is a good thing, she\u2019s behind it,\u201d Bazelon said. \u201cBut when it\u2019s time to be bold and do the right thing, she doesn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nSeptember Dawn Bottoms for TIME\n\nSince her election to the Senate in 2016, Harris has thrilled liberal audiences with her punishing interrogations of Trump Administration officials. She made former Attorney General Jeff Sessions blanch and Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh squirm. And in May, she deftly filleted the current Attorney General, William Barr, asking him, \u201cHas the President or anyone at the White House ever asked or suggested that you open an investigation of anyone?\u201d Barr was reduced to stuttering. He wouldn\u2019t or couldn\u2019t answer. In recent weeks, the clip has gone viral again as new questions have arisen about Barr\u2019s involvement in the President\u2019s political pressuring of foreign governments.\n\nSitting in the office in Los Angeles, Harris says she asked that question on a prosecutor\u2019s hunch. \u201cIt has become clear to me that these are the kinds of questions you have to ask members of this Administration,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat kind of unethical requests has this President made of you? I knew by instinct and by example that it is not beyond him to think that America\u2019s justice system is his personal apparatus for political gain. He\u2019s made that quite clear.\u201d\n\nNow that the process to impeach Trump is under way\u2013something Harris called for, but not until several other candidates beat her to it\u2013many liberals fantasize about her as the prosecutor of the impeachment trial in the Senate. The Harris they see in those hearings is the Harris they crave: sharp, ruthless, oppositional. (Unfortunately for her campaign, ethics rules prevent her from using those clips to raise money.) But that\u2019s not the Harris they get on the campaign trail. Presidential candidate Harris wants to be about unity, about uplift, about bringing people together around not a particular agenda but a sense of \u201cwho we are.\u201d Campaigning to fix what keeps people up at night, she might just cure America\u2019s insomnia by putting us to sleep with platitudes.\n\nSeptember Dawn Bottoms for TIME\n\nVarious commentators have found Harris elusive, and she can be hard to pin down on policy positions. Early in her presidential campaign she called for abolishing private health insurance, then took it back, then later released a health care plan that would be government-run but allow for both public and private health insurance. In the first debate, Harris scored a clean hit on Biden with her attack on his opposition to federally mandated busing in the 1970s, and surged in the polls. But in the ensuing days she couldn\u2019t definitively describe her own position on busing. When I asked her what ought to be done about the ongoing segregation of public schools, she spent several minutes discussing the need to \u201cspeak the truth about all of this,\u201d before finally settling on a prescription: \u201cTo deal with this issue,\u201d she said, \u201cwe need to collect the data and then we need to expose it.\u201d\n\nBy upbringing and orientation, Harris seems to have a strong sense of right and wrong and a fierce drive to fight injustice, coupled with virtually no large-scale policy instincts. Presented with a problem, she looks for ways to solve it, starting with data, guided by few firm ideological convictions. \u201cAll these grand ideas that academics and so many have about how you\u2019re going to transform the world,\u201d she says. \u201cBut, you know, pay attention to the basics.\u201d\n\nPerhaps, in these days of brutal ideological combat, that kind of pragmatism could be sold as refreshing. But in Harris\u2019 case it seems to be having the opposite effect. Some of the attendees at her events in Iowa told me they don\u2019t think she\u2019s progressive enough; others said she strikes them as too far left. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t gone far enough to get the activists behind her, but she\u2019s gone too far for some of the moderates,\u201d says Larry Gerston, a professor emeritus of political science at San Jose State University. \u201cSo she\u2019s in kind of a no-person\u2019s-land in terms of having a good base.\u201d And yet, polls indicate that Democratic voters still want to like her\u2013if only they can figure out what she\u2019s about. The race is far from over. Iowa voters are notorious for shopping around until the end.\n\nOn a clear early-fall day, more than 100 people have come to hear Harris speak in a pub in Coralville. \u201cI like Biden, but I want someone new,\u201d says 71-year-old Jane Carlson, a retired university worker. \u201cI don\u2019t want yesterday. I want tomorrow.\u201d\n\nHarris bounds onto the stage, all gleaming smiles and upbeat energy. \u201cSo, I\u2019m moving here!\u201d she says with a big laugh, and then turns serious. \u201cWe are at an inflection moment in the history of our country,\u201d she tells the crowd, \u201ca moment in time requiring us to look in the mirror and ask a question, that question being, Who are we?\u201d\n\nWhile Harris is still speaking, a few people begin to trickle out the back of the venue. Elizabeth Warren is holding an event a little ways down the road, they tell me, and they don\u2019t want to miss it.\n\nWith reporting by Lissandra Villa/Washington", "description": "", "authors": ["Molly Ball"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/tim191014v1_harris.cover_.jpg?quality=85&w=1012"}
