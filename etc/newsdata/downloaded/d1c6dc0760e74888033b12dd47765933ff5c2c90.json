He appeared Saturday under subpoena after the State Department sought to block his testimony, according to an official working on the impeachment inquiry.\n\nInvestigators are trying to piece together efforts by Trump and his associates and diplomats to pressure Ukraine\u2019s leaders to open up investigations into the president\u2019s political rivals, including Joe Biden. A central part of the inquiry is whether Trump withheld military aid to the besieged country and refused a White House meeting with its president, Volodymyr Zelensky, until Ukraine publicly declared its intent to investigate Biden and a debunked conspiracy theory about a Democratic email server.\n\nLawmakers have deposed several current and former State Department officials in order to learn more about the extent to which American diplomats were involved in or had knowledge of the events in question. Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, has said he was in contact with State Department officials \u2014 some of whom testified that they were troubled by Giuliani\u2019s involvement and Trump\u2019s efforts to pressure them to work with Giuliani.\n\nReeker did not plan to give an opening statement when he testified behind closed doors on Saturday. Beyond the Yovanovitch ouster, \u201che doesn\u2019t really have that much knowledge or involvement in the rest of the story,\u201d the person said.\n\nReeker spends about half of his time in Europe, meeting with ambassadors and other diplomats. He is tasked with ensuring that all U.S. diplomatic posts throughout the continent are fully staffed, so he found himself in the middle of the firestorm when Yovanovitch was recalled to Washington in May.\n\nIt was unclear if Reeker defended Yovanovitch, who came under attack from Giuliani over a series of unsubstantiated allegations. Other current and former State Department officials who have testified before House impeachment investigators defended Yovanovitch and spoke out internally against her ouster.\n\nOne of those officials, Michael McKinley, a former top adviser to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, testified that he resigned earlier this month in part because the department was unwilling to protect Yovanovitch from false and politically-motivated attacks.\n\nMcKinley, who stepped down a week before testifying, attributed his resignation in part to \u201cthe failure, in my view, of the State Department to offer support to foreign service employees caught up in the impeachment inquiry on Ukraine,\u201d according to a source familiar with his testimony. He said he \u201ccould no longer look the other way as colleagues are denied the professional support and respect they deserve from us all.\u201d\n\nThe State Department\u2019s inspector general briefed congressional aides earlier this month about an apparent attempt to smear Yovanovitch. The watchdog, Steve Linick, told staffers that a packet of documents containing misinformation about Yovanovitch was sent to Pompeo\u2019s office earlier this year from an unknown source.\n\nDemocrats said the documents represented further evidence that Giuliani and others were trying to tear down Yovanovitch.\n\nTrump himself criticized Yovanovitch during a July 25 phone call with Zelensky, calling her \u201cbad news.\u201d That conversation is at the center of the impeachment inquiry because, according to a readout of the call, Trump pressured Zelensky to launch investigations targeting Biden and his son, Hunter.\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS POLITICO Playbook Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics.

He testified that Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, said Trump personally told him that he wanted Ukraine to publicly announce investigations targeting the president\u2019s political opponents before U.S. would release the military aid.\n\nDemocrats are expected to continue holding closed-door depositions for at least the next two weeks before moving the impeachment inquiry into the open. Democratic leaders have defended the secrecy of the evidence-gathering process amid claims from Republicans that Democrats are running a \u201csham\u201d investigation that lacks basic transparency.\n\nKyle Cheney contributed to this story.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/7f/7c/ec07d7784e5c8e278d8dd1a4300c/191026-reeker-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
