Robert Pattinson and Robert Eggers. Photo: A24\n\nWith 2015\u2019s The Witch, Robert Eggers showed that there was nothing quite so frightening as the Puritan mind. By replicating the setting and vernacular of 17th-century Plymouth, his thriller about a family settling in the wilderness immersed us in a particular mind-set and belief system; suddenly, witches were real. Now, with the bleakly gorgeous and impossibly tense The Lighthouse, opening October 18, he places us in a remote late-19th-century lighthouse, where two men \u2014 an old sailor played by Willem Dafoe and a novice played by Robert Pattinson \u2014 find themselves at odds, driven by drink, savage weather, and mysterious visions.\n\nWhat comes first for you \u2014 the period and the setting or the story?\n\nI tend to imagine the atmosphere of the film before the story. The reason why it became this period in The Lighthouse is because I wanted to have a foghorn, and I wanted to have a Fresnel lens. Fresnel was a Frenchman who designed a lens that could magnify light greatly; it used to have oil lamps that had little concave mirrors \u2014 many, many, many, concave mirrors that would rotate to reflect the light out. It looks like a crazy Art Deco sculpture. That was important to having the mystery of the light as a plot device. Having that Fresnel light was going to be key, so actually, this lighthouse is in a state of really terrible disrepair for the period. Before the Civil War, American lighthouses were often shitholes, like the lighthouse station in my film. But then the United States Lighthouse Establishment was established, and it took keeping your lighthouse in good shape very seriously \u2014 so you have to imagine that this place was so remote that the inspectors would never come to check it out. Jarin [Blaschke, the cinematographer] and I went to one of the few lighthouses in North America that has a working Fresnel lens, at Pigeon Point in Northern California, for a research trip. We could have just stared at this thing all night. It is hypnotic.\n\nHow do you approach research with these films?\n\nHead on. Maybe I\u2019ll get tired of it but I don\u2019t really have any interest in making contemporary film. Part of what is fun to me is doing the research. If I wasn\u2019t doing this kind of creative work, I probably would\u2019ve been an archeologist \u2014 trying to understand where we are, and where we\u2019re going from where we came from, is what is the most exciting to me. The other thing I find, if I ever did do a contemporary film, it would probably have to be extremely low budget. Otherwise, it would be so fussy-looking that it would be shameful. When doing something in the past, I have to create or re-create the material world. That is very satisfying.\n\nAlso, I strive for period accuracy, which is not important to good design. In fact, most films that are well designed stray from the path, but I like having the rigor of saying, \u201cThis is what we\u2019re aiming for,\u201d whereas other directors or designers have to invent a world. That would be sort of overwhelming for me to have that responsibility. For this movie, certainly it\u2019s very much a collaboration with all of the heads of department, but there is a way in which I\u2019m like, \u201cThis is the teakettle that\u2019s supposed to be there, so find this teakettle. I don\u2019t need to see options of ten; I just need to find that one.\u201d I find that\u2019s a very satisfying way to work.\n\nBut it\u2019s about more than period accuracy, isn\u2019t it? In The Witch, for example, you immerse us in the psychology of the period, so that we will find the things they found scary to also be scary.\n\nI\u2019m sort of looking for half-forgotten things at the perimeter of contemporary consciousness. With The Witch, there\u2019s the hare. We don\u2019t have European brown hares in the United States, so the witch lore surrounding hares we don\u2019t have \u2014 but it\u2019s massive in Western Europe. I was in Northern Ireland recently and talking to someone who hunts hares who was saying, \u201cWhen I see one of these hares, she\u2019s a witch.\u201d It\u2019s just something that she grew up thinking. So with The Witch, some people are like, \u201cWhat\u2019s the deal with the bunny?\u201d but a lot of people find that they are really creeped out by the hare and they don\u2019t quite know why.\n\nWillem Dafoe and Robert Pattinson in The Lighthouse.

Were you worried at all that they might not have any?\n\nOf course, that was scary. With The Witch and all my theater work, I got to audition people to death and I got to read people together. But when you\u2019re working with names of a certain notoriety, they\u2019re not going to read. So you just have to trust your gut. I\u2019ve been asked before why they seemed like a good pair and I probably should, some morning or evening, give that a good think, because I don\u2019t know why it made sense to me. They have cheekbones and noses. Somehow, the way they looked together was part of it. Especially because this movie plays around with identity in an interesting way. There are ways in which Rob and Willem began their careers more differently, and their approach to the work couldn\u2019t be more different. Though [when you look at] how Dafoe\u2019s continued to navigate his career, and how Rob has chosen to position himself post-Twilight, they are both looking for interesting things. Rob turned down an offer on another film to do mine, because he said that while he liked it, \u201cthat role wasn\u2019t weird, and I only want to do weird things. This is weird enough.\u201d\n\nAs I understand it, Pattinson and Dafoe have very different acting styles and different processes. Does that prompt you to direct them differently?\n\nYou have to direct them differently. Every actor demands different things. Every human being you come in contact with in your life, you have to deal with in slightly different ways. And certainly when you\u2019re trying to provoke a performance that will carry an entire movie, whatever works for them is what you have to do. It is a weird balance, because how do I direct with them within what my own approach is? There is friction. I want everyone to trust each other and skip happily down the lane, and I think that finally everyone trusted each other, but we weren\u2019t skipping down the lane all the time. Because they work very differently, it wasn\u2019t always simple \u2014 but it was great for the film and very enjoyable. I wouldn\u2019t say that my overall experience of The Lighthouse was fun. It was quite miserable and difficult, but I did have fun everyday working with them.\n\nWhen you say everyone wasn\u2019t always skipping down the lane, what do you mean?\n\nThere are really demanding scenes, and they\u2019re working differently. [With Willem in the finished film] you\u2019re often looking at bits and pieces of all of his takes. And with Rob it\u2019s usually take one or take 57 \u2014 all of that scene is one thing. How do you keep that in balance? It\u2019s difficult for everybody. Funny.\n\nThere\u2019s this weird romantic element between the two characters. It\u2019s almost homoerotic.\n\nIt is homoerotic, but that doesn\u2019t mean that they actually want to sleep with each other. But the way that we shoot Rob\u2019s muscles is homoerotic. It just is.\n\nI was reminded, watching the film, that the image of the lighthouse itself, in culture, is a symbol not just of mystery but also of romance.\n\nJung would love that. And it is a giant phallus.\n\nYou sometimes cut from the machinery of the lighthouse to shots of Dafoe\u2019s body, as if he\u2019s becoming one with the lighthouse.\n\nWhen Rodrigo Teixeira, one of our Brazilian producers, first read the script, he texted me: \u201cWillem is a lighthouse. Rob is not a lighthouse. This is the movie.\u201d\n\nCan you tell me about the location?\n\nWe shot on the southern tip of Nova Scotia in a place called Cape Forchu. That is a peninsula off the fishing village of Yarmouth. It\u2019s just like a spin of volcanic rock, and it was a really, really punishing location. There were several nor\u2019easters when we were building the lighthouse. The seawater was freezing on the scaffolding. The wind is not exaggerated in the film. Even if I was a yard from you, I might not be able to hear you against the wind.\n\nWould the film have been different if the location had been more hospitable?\n\nOh, it\u2019s intentional. I wanted it to be miserable and challenging.\n\nYour characters often speak in archaic ways, and your stories, despite having genre elements, often move toward abstraction and fragmentation. How do you not lose your audience?\n\nObviously, you\u2019re afraid it\u2019s not going to work. But Jarin and I, when we\u2019re conceiving the shots, are always very considerate of which character\u2019s point of view the scene is being told from. We make all of our choices based on that, and I think that gives [the audience] something to hang our coats on, so we can feel comfortable.\n\nI was really struck by the sound design of The Lighthouse. From what you\u2019re telling me, it sounds like you probably had to create a lot of that afterward, especially if you can\u2019t hear anything when you\u2019re shooting.\n\nThe music and the sound design merge in this film quite often, and there are some things that I would consider music and that composers consider music but that other human beings might consider sound design. [Laughs.] The sound of light over the lens was a glass harmonica, which was sort of perhaps too on-the-nose but I think it works quite well. A lot of friction mallets on various objects \u2014 mostly cymbals, but all kinds of musical instruments. There was a point at which Michael Schaefer at New Regency emailed me and said, \u201cThe score is terrible, like a Yeti moaning. I beg you to ask yourself, When is the obscurity of the score adding to the tension and when is it just weird?\u201d And that was a very helpful note.\n\nThe Witch is often grouped together with films like The Babadook and Hereditary and others in that contentious category of \u201celevated horror.\u201d What\u2019s your relationship to genre? Does it feel limiting sometimes to have to sell a movie as something specific that then creates all sorts of genre expectations?\n\nBeing a wannabe auteur and my favorite filmmakers being part of the dead canon of European, Japanese art-house masters, I want to say that I don\u2019t want to care about genre and how it\u2019s limiting and all of that stuff. And there are some people who stick by specific definitions of what genre is and they don\u2019t like what I\u2019m doing, which is perfectly fine. The Lighthouse isn\u2019t scary. A few people have said it is, but I don\u2019t think it is. I think where genre is limiting is that in the marketplace, you have to put things in a box to create expectations to make a profit, and that\u2019s where you run into trouble. There are people who really do say, \u201cGive me my money back because I paid to get scared and I didn\u2019t ever once throw my popcorn in the air.\u201d That\u2019s fair enough. On the other hand, I wouldn\u2019t have the incredible opportunity to be making cinema if it wasn\u2019t for genre. Genre gave me the opportunity to get a movie fucking financed. The Lighthouse couldn\u2019t have been made without this kind of freedom that is allowed to some filmmakers to be able to play around with genre. Jennifer Kent\u2019s Nightingale [her follow-up to The Babadook] is more horrific than any horror movie \u2014 but also, I don\u2019t think you could make that movie without this kind of freedom.\n\n*A version of this article appears in the September 2, 2019, issue of New York Magazine.
