The guys are working through it,\" United Technologies Chief Executive Greg Hayes told analysts on a conference call.\n\nNo one was hurt in the three incidents, which all took place during flights over France between London and Geneva. But parts from two of the A220 engines were found on the ground.\n\nFrance's air-accident agency - the Bureau of Enquiry and Analysis for Civil Aviation Safety - has launched a rare appeal for 150 volunteers to help search a wooded area in eastern France for a key component of the engines during the coming weeks.\n\nFuel savings\n\nPratt & Whitney set off a chain reaction of new aircraft designs or upgrades in 2008, when it announced its new geared turbofan engine, promising 16 percent fuel savings. But since then, it has wrestled with a spate of performance or reliability problems and delays.\n\nAlthough software problems can take time to fix, experts say they are more likely rectified with a software update rather than by designing a new part.\n\nFormerly known as the CSeries, the 110-130-seat A220 was designed by Canada's Bombardier Inc and was one of the first to adopt the new Pratt & Whitney technology. Bombardier sold the programme to Airbus last year due to heavy losses.\n\nThe Airbus version of the engines is not affected by the recent problems and is not subject to checks.\n\nSome competing Brazilian aircrafts such as the Embraer 190 and 195-E2 have also been subject to such engine checks, but reportedly use a different version of the software from the larger A220.", "description": "Reuters sources claim a software issue is suspected in Airbus A220 engine blowouts.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/24/d16882e327204ee481500d12fdaf2291_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
