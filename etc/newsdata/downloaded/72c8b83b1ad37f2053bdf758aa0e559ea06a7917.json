(Charley Gallay/Getty Images for Netflix)\n\nAn organization that will receive $200,000 from the National Football League came under fire this week for photos of its founder cutting young men\u2019s dreadlocks, sparking a campaign where people shared celebratory pictures of their locs.\n\nTwitter users criticized Chicago-based Crushers Club for now-deleted photos that the nonprofit shared in 2016 of Founder and Executive Director Sally Hazelgrove, a white woman, cutting off two black men\u2019s locs. Twitter user \u201cResist Programming,\u201d who posted the pictures, called the hair-cutting \u201ctroubling.\u201d The caption on one of the photos said, \u201cAnd another Crusher let me cut his dreads off! It\u2019s symbolic of change and their desire for a better life!\u201d\n\n\u201cI did not think about the ramifications,\" Hazelgrove told The Washington Post on Friday. \u201cI can understand how I could be interpreted as insensitive, but that certainly was not our intention. I was trying to support his decision.\u201d\n\nPerhaps Jay-Z, Meek Mill, Meghan Trainor, Vic Mensa, and Rapsody can ask Sally Hazelgrove about her thinking behind the encouragement to cut off young Black male dreads. pic.twitter.com/GW59UuRgpJ \u2014 Resist Programming \ud83d\udef0 (@RzstProgramming) September 5, 2019\n\nTo some African Americans, the choice to style their hair in locs is a way of owning their cultural heritage, especially as it stands apart from traditionally European hairstyles. As The Washington Post\u2019s Danielle Douglas-Gabriel previously reported:\n\nFew things in African American culture are more politicized than hair. Whether it\u2019s chemically straightened, attached to a synthetic mane or left in its natural state, our hair takes on all sorts of meaning, often without intention. Much of this is rooted in the outsider status of our hair in a society that deems European standards of beauty inherently more valuable than any others.\n\nHazelgrove on Friday said two of the young men that participate in Crushers\u2019 leadership, boxing and music programs asked her a few years ago to cut their hair. One had been involved in gang activity and crime, she said, and \u201cwanted to change his life.\u201d\n\nOne of the individuals in the photos, whose first name is Kobe, confirmed Hazelgrove\u2019s story in a short video posted Friday.\n\n\u201cCut my head like three years ago. That was something I wanted to do,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause I was tired of it. Tired of gang banging, tired of messing up. Now I\u2019m a changed young man, trying to see bigger and better dreams.\u201d\n\nHe had volunteered to speak out after he heard about the backlash, Hazelgrove said.\n\nFilmmaker Ava DuVernay responded to the hair-cutting photos by asking her Twitter followers to celebrate the beauty of their locs by sharing pictures of them with the hashtag #loclife.\n\nLet\u2019s replace those images of a Trump supporter gleefully cutting a young black man\u2019s locs to give him a \u201cbetter life\u201d... with the beauty and majesty of life with locs.

Currently I'm an Executive Director of an HIV/AIDS non-profit and a doctoral student.

The league is partnering on the program with Roc Nation, the entertainment company of rapper and entrepreneur Jay-Z.\n\nThe NFL and Roc Nation did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the league\u2019s donation.\n\nThe images of a white woman cutting young black men\u2019s hair echoed an incident last year when a 16-year-old wrestler in New Jersey was forced to cut his dreadlocks before a match or forfeit. Critics saw the ultimatum as an instance of racial bias.\n\nRead more:\n\nDo LGBTQ athletes owe the public a revelation about their sexuality?
