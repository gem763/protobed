Younger patients may need additional surgery related to their devices in perhaps five, 10 or 15 years.\n\nBreasts can change for a variety of reasons, including pregnancy, nursing, weight changes and hormonal changes like menopause.\n\n\u201cIt is helpful to plan from a financial perspective that you\u2019re not just paying the cost of that one surgery,\u201d she said. \u201cImplants are devices \u2014 they need surveillance, and sometimes they need to be replaced.\u201d\n\nBreasts can change for a variety of reasons, including pregnancy, nursing, weight changes and hormonal changes like menopause, added Herluf Lund, a St. Louis-based plastic surgeon and member of the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, in a statement sent to MarketWatch.\n\n\u201cAs the breasts change through life, the breast implants that were selected at an earlier stage of life may not longer meet the needs or the desires of the patient, meaning the patient may need to exchange her breast implants for a different size or shape to meet her goals,\u201d he said.\n\nBreast augmentation was the most popular cosmetic surgical procedure in 2018, with 313,000 procedures performed, according to data from the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, another trade group. Breast-augmentation surgery costs $3,824 on average, according to the organization, while the average cost for implant-removal surgery is $2,566.\n\n\u201cWe have heard from many women that they are not fully informed of the risks when considering breast implants,\u201d FDA principal deputy commissioner Amy Abernethy and Jeffrey Shuren, the director of the FDA\u2019s Center for Devices and Radiological Health, said in a statement. \u201cThey\u2019ve stated that they need more information to facilitate meaningful conversations with their doctors and to make appropriate decisions for themselves.\u201d\n\nThe agency\u2019s draft guidance will be open for public comment for the next 60 days; manufacturers can then choose to follow the finalized guidance or opt for their own FDA-compliant labeling methods.\n\nBoxed warnings call attention to \u2018serious of life-threatening risks\u2019\n\nA boxed warning is one of the FDA\u2019s most serious warnings. It typically appears in a bold font in black box on prescription drug labels and is designed to \u201ccall attention to serious or life-threatening risks,\u201d according to the agency.\n\nFor example, the agency added boxed warnings to some prescription opioid pain medicines and some drugs that treat anxiety in 2016 after discovering that combining the two medicines could result in death.\n\nThe FDA also recommended that breast-implant manufacturers provide a \u2018patient-decision checklist\u2019 along with informational brochures or booklets.\n\nThe FDA also recommended that breast-implant manufacturers provide a \u201cpatient-decision checklist\u201d along with informational brochures or booklets, for use during a patient-surgeon consultation.\n\nA sample checklist published by the FDA included information on considerations for a successful breast-implant candidate, surgery risks, cancer risk, long-term impacts of implants, and systemic symptoms some women have reported following their procedures.\n\nManufacturers could also include easy-to-grasp product ingredient information on labels and provide more information on the patient \u201cdevice card\u201d that contains details on the specific implants they have, the FDA further advised.\n\nPatients with silicone gel-filled implants should receive screenings for ruptures to their implants after five or six years, then every two years following the initial screening, the agency suggested.\n\nPatients have been asking for better warnings of the risks\n\nWomen who said they had endured complications related to their breast implants urged the FDA during a March advisory-panel meeting to provide better warnings of the risks, the Washington Post reported at the time.\n\nAllergan AGN, -0.41% voluntarily recalled its Biocell textured breast implants and tissue expanders at the FDA\u2019s request in July, after the agency cited increased risk of breast implant-associated anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL), a kind of non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma linked to the products.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve heard loud and clear from the public advisory panel meeting we held earlier this year and from the information we\u2019ve gathered from other ongoing efforts to engage with patients and stakeholders that there is a distinct opportunity to do more to protect women who are considering breast implants,\u201d Abernethy and Shuren\u2019s statement said.\n\n\u2018Previous communications to patients interested in breast implants for either reconstruction or augmentation purposes were felt to be overly lengthy and confusing.\u2019\n\nLund said that the measures prescribed by the FDA were \u201cmeant to enhance the process by which patients receive and understand the information needed as part of the informed consent process.\u201d \u201cPrevious communications to patients interested in breast implants for either reconstruction or augmentation purposes were felt to be overly lengthy and confusing,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd Pusic urged consumers to consider the FDA\u2019s new recommendations within the larger context of risks and benefits surrounding such procedures. Breast implants, particularly in cases of post-mastectomy reconstruction, can boost a woman\u2019s body image and quality of life, she said.\n\n\u201cThe more we can ensure that systematically women are being informed of the risks and benefits of surgery, that\u2019s good,\u201d Pusic added.\n\nImplant patients would not actually see the boxed warning, because they don\u2019t typically interact with an implant\u2019s device packaging, Pusic said. So it\u2019s important that the woman get information on risks and benefits early on, when she\u2019s discussing the procedure with her doctor during a consultation.\n\nAsked about how the boxed warning might help inform patients, an FDA spokeswoman said, \u201cThe patient checklist contains the same info as in the boxed warning. So the patient would check off item by item.\u201d\n\nA spokeswoman for Allergan, a leading breast-implant manufacturer, told MarketWatch in a statement: \u201cAllergan fully supports ensuring patients are informed about the risks and benefits of breast implants. Allergan will continue to work with the FDA to ensure patient materials are clear and informative.\u201d\n\nMentor, a Johnson & Johnson JNJ, +0.35% subsidiary that makes breast implants, recently launched a new patient website with an \u201cenhanced safety section,\u201d a company spokeswoman said. \u201cThough Mentor is still reviewing the proposed draft guidance in detail, we look forward to actively participating in the discussion on the proposed guidance,\u201d she added.\n\nIdeal Implant and Sientra SIEN, +0.00% \u2014 the other two manufacturers of approved breast implants in the U.S., according to the FDA \u2014 did not immediately return requests for comment on the agency\u2019s recommendations.", "description": "\u2018There is a distinct opportunity to do more to protect women who are considering breast implants,\u2019 FDA officials said.", "authors": ["Meera Jagannathan"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT873_implan_ZG_20191023133838.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
