Fryderyk Chopin has been the subject of many biographies and films, but some of the most famous stories about him are invented, according to Walker's extensive research.\n\nHis definitive biography, Fryderyk Chopin, is a 2019 finalist for the Governor General's Literary Award for nonfiction. The winners will be announced on Oct. 29, 2019.\n\nWalker talked to CBC Books about how he researched and wrote Fryderyk Chopin.\n\nFrom Lizst to Chopin\n\n\"I spent 25 years writing the biography of Franz Lizst in three volumes and that won various international prizes. At the end of that very long process, I started to suffer from the literary equivalent of postpartum depression. I felt that I needed another long-range project to keep me working as a writer. My choice fell on Chopin.\n\nIt would be impossible for me to write a biography of any composer whose music I did not love. - Alan Walker\n\n\"I returned to my early childhood because I was trained as a pianist. I took my first piano lessons when I was six or seven years old. There are certain pieces by Chopin, which are not technically difficult \u2014 although they're filled with musical substance \u2014 and it is therefore possible for a small child to come to grips with one or two of the preludes or waltzes.\n\n\"This gave me a way into Chopin's music. I fell in love with those pieces and various other pieces that I got to know along the way. They remained with me for life. Some years later, I became a producer at the British Broadcasting Corporation in London and I worked with some world-famous pianists. I was able to draw on my memories of those encounters and these wonderful interpretations as I was writing my book.\n\n\"It would be impossible for me to write a biography of any composer whose music I did not love. The preferred role of any biographer is surely that of counsel for the defence. There are many biographers who like to play counsel for the prosecution, but they generally fail, and the reason is simple. A prosecutor meets closed doors. A defender is invited to enter them.\"\n\nPolish composer and pianist Frederick Francois Chopin (1810 - 1849). Original Publication: People Disc - HJ0255.

Nowadays the transmission of sources is very important. I knew that once I embarked on this project that I would have to travel in search of documents in foreign archives. The problem with earlier biographies, and particularly with Chopin is that \u2014 in the absence of scientifically verifiable information about his life and his work \u2014 his earlier biographers rushed to fill this vacuum with fantasy and fiction.\n\n\"One of the most famous [false] stories has been immortalized by Hollywood in A Song to Remember. Chopin's about to leave Warsaw forever as a result of the 1830 November uprising, which was crushed by the Russians. Chopin got out just in time. His confr\u00e8res gave him a sample of Polish earth to take with him so that it could be buried with him whenever and wherever he died. We know that never took place, so that's one story that had to be jettisoned.\n\n\"Another one is the famous deathbed note that he was supposed to have scribbled to his doctors before he died to have his body opened because he feared being buried alive. That's also a fantasy. We know that this particular note was written years earlier by by Chopin's father on his deathbed.\n\nThere are many other instances of the book being a corrective biography. I would go on forever if I were to list them all. - Alan Walker\n\n\"There are many other instances of the book being a corrective biography. I would go on forever if I were to list them all. Though some of them are quite small, when you add them all together, I think it means that my Chopin biography will make a difference.\"\n\nAnalogue writing\n\n\"I first wrote the entire Chopin biography in longhand on children's multi-coloured Jumbo pads \u2014 yellow, pink, green and red. I dislike using a computer for writing. Unless the words flow down my right arm I feel that they do not belong to me. The first drafts of my text on coloured notepaper are now in my personal archive at McMaster University.\"\n\nLessons learned\n\n\"The biggest physical challenge in writing the book involved international travel and sojourns in foreign countries \u2014 Poland, France, and Britain especially, where many Chopin manuscripts are to be found. The biggest intellectual challenge involved making a complicated story accessible to the general reader, and if possible turning it into a page-turner.\n\n\"The lesson one learns from writing large-scale biographies is the time-honoured one: human beings are complicated, and even my book of nearly 800 pages is not long enough to do Chopin full justice. I recall the words of a Hungarian friend, after she learned of my interest in writing a life of Franz Liszt: 'Remember, it takes a life to study a life.'\"\n\nAlan Walker's comments have been edited for length and clarity.", "description": "Alan Walker is a finalist for the 2019 Governor General's Literary Award for nonfiction for his biography Fryderyk Chopin.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5303118.1569878442!/fileImage/httpImage/image.png_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/fryderyk-chopin-by-alan-walker.png", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
