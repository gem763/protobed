(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nWith Mariana Alfaro\n\nTHE BIG IDEA: \u201cWow,\u201d Judge Beryl Howell said in her courtroom on Tuesday.\n\nA lawyer representing President Trump\u2019s Justice Department had just made the audacious argument that the courts erred in 1974 by allowing Congress to review materials from the Watergate grand jury. Without that \u201croad map,\u201d which formed the backbone of the House impeachment hearings, the depths of Richard Nixon\u2019s corruption might never have been known. Nixon probably would have served out his full second term.\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee has been trying to secure some of the grand-jury materials that former special counsel Bob Mueller relied upon to prepare his report on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Attorney General Bill Barr\u2019s team is fighting tooth and nail to keep them secret. Their latest gambit is to claim that the landmark ruling 45 years ago by John Sirica, which was upheld on appeal, relied on an \u201cambiguous\u201d interpretation of law that no longer is valid. Howell, who is now the chief judge of the same federal court, seemed taken aback. During a two-hour hearing, she described this as one of several \u201cextreme\u201d arguments that the DOJ has staked out in this case.\n\nRemarkably, this was not actually the Trump administration\u2019s most brazen claim of executive power on Tuesday. Not even close.\n\nThe day started with the State Department blocking Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, from appearing for a scheduled deposition to discuss his role in the Ukraine scandal. The directive apparently came via a voice mail left for Robert Luskin, the ambassador\u2019s attorney, at 12:30 a.m. Luskin said that his client flew in from Brussels and was willing to testify but that he felt obligated to follow the order to not show up.\n\nA few hours later, Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani announced that he will disregard a House subpoena for documents related to his efforts in Ukraine. \u201cLet them hold me in contempt,\u201d Giuliani declared.\n\nTuesday ended with White House counsel Pat Cipollone announcing that Trump will not cooperate in any way with the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry. In a fiery eight-page letter to Nancy Pelosi that sounded more like Trump\u2019s tweets than serious legal analysis, Cipollone said the president has done nothing wrong, called the proceedings against him illegitimate and accused Democrats of trying to overturn the results of the 2016 election. \u201cTo fulfill his duties to the American people, the Constitution, the executive branch, and all future occupants of the Office of the presidency, President Trump and his administration cannot participate in your partisan and unconstitutional inquiry under these circumstances,\u201d Cipollone wrote.\n\nTrump has demonstrated a consistent disdain for the rule of law since taking office, from declaring a national emergency to divert money from the military construction budget for his border wall to musing that guns should be taken away from people without due process. But Tuesday\u2019s frontal challenge to the fundamental system of checks and balances takes the cake.\n\n-- The absolutist position articulated in Cipollone\u2019s letter follows Trump\u2019s increasingly provocative assertions of his own power. \u201cArticle II allows me to do whatever I want,\u201d Trump said this summer. The president was making the point during an interview with ABC News that he could have fired Mueller and ended his probe if he wanted to do so. He\u2019s made variations of this statement several times in the past few months, from a gaggle on the White House lawn to an 80-minute speech at a conference for pro-Trump students. \u201cI have to the right to do whatever I want as president,\u201d Trump told the kids.\n\nArticle II enumerates several specific powers for the president but by no means gives him total power. Quite the opposite. In fact, the impeachment clause is in Section Four of Article II. Removing a president for \u201ctreason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors\u201d is literally, by definition, a constitutional act.\n\n-- Substantively, many legal experts agree, the arguments in the White House\u2019s latest letter are specious. Impeachment is literally a constitutional remedy. It cannot be \u201cunconstitutional,\u201d as Cipollone claimed in his letter. Several prominent attorneys, including conservatives, rebuked the White House counsel for putting his name on such an incendiary letter.\n\n\u201cThis letter is bananas,\u201d said Gregg Nunziata, who previously served as general counsel for Marco Rubio and, before that, the chief nominations counsel for Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee. \u201cA barely-lawyered temper tantrum. A middle finger to Congress and its oversight responsibilities. No Member of Congress should accept it, no matter his or her view on the behavior of Pelosi, Schiff, or Trump. Things are bad. Things will get worse.\u201d\n\n\u201cI cannot fathom how any self-respecting member of the bar could affix his name to this letter. It\u2019s pure hackery, and it disgraces the profession,\u201d added conservative legal luminary George Conway, who worked for Ken Starr during the investigation that led to Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment. He is married to counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway but has emerged as an outspoken Trump critic.\n\n-- \u201cHe is shaking the foundations of the republic,\u201d said Kerry Kircher, the House counsel for the Republican majority between 2011 and 2016. \u201cHe is poking his fingers into all of the places where we have norms and traditions and things that both parties have respected for years, and he has blown all of those out the window,\u201d Kircher explained earlier this week, before the Cipollone letter, to Seung Min Kim and Rachael Bade.\n\n-- The president has left little doubt that he\u2019s personally behind the decision to stonewall and to try running down the clock. He indicated on Twitter that it was his call to gag Sondland. \u201cI would love to send [him] to testify, but unfortunately he would be testifying before a totally compromised kangaroo court,\u201d the president tweeted on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cTrump has regularly told White House officials that he does not want to cooperate with the House committees conducting oversight,\u201d sources tell Karoun Demirjian, Josh Dawsey, Shane Harris and John Wagner. \u201cHe was livid last week after the release of text messages from Kurt Volker [special envoy to Ukraine] and news accounts from testimony that seemed to undercut his administration\u2019s case,\u201d a White House official said on background.\n\n-- Trump may be our most litigious president ever, but he\u2019s not a lawyer. For that reason, the White House\u2019s announcement that it won\u2019t cooperate ought to be viewed more as a political strategy than a legal one. He\u2019d much rather duke it out with Democrats over something like document production, which can make people\u2019s eyes glaze over, than answer for his underlying conduct at the heart of the impeachment inquiry. He knows that not cooperating will make it harder for investigators to get to the bottom of what really happened, specifically how directly involved he was.\n\n-- Pelosi responded that Democrats won\u2019t be deterred. She promised that House investigators will keep looking into Trump\u2019s alleged efforts to coerce a foreign country to dig up dirt on a domestic political rival while simultaneously holding up vital assistance that Ukraine needed to fend off the ongoing Russian invasion. \u201cThe White House should be warned that continued efforts to hide the truth of the President\u2019s abuse of power from the American people will be regarded as further evidence of obstruction,\u201d Pelosi said in a statement. \u201cMr. President, you are not above the law. You will be held accountable.\u201d\n\nAttorney General Bill Barr speaks last week in Topeka, Kan. (Ed Zurga/Getty Images)\n\n-- The bigger picture: Under Barr, the Justice Department has increasingly intervened on Trump\u2019s behalf, including when he sues other people. The Barr Justice Department has pushed for a breathtaking expansion of presidential immunity, even as Trump\u2019s lawyers make sometimes contradictory arguments in legal filings. \u201cIn the most recent instance, [last] Wednesday, the department took Trump\u2019s side in a federal lawsuit against the Manhattan district attorney. In that case, Trump has sought to block a subpoena for his tax returns \u2014 using the precedent-shattering argument that a sitting president shouldn\u2019t be investigated by any prosecutor, for any reason, anywhere,\u201d David Fahrenthold, Ann Marimow and Robert Barnes report:\n\n\u201cDuring Trump\u2019s term, federal lawyers have defended him against three lawsuits alleging he is violating the Constitution by continuing to do business with foreign governments through his family business. \u2026 In two other cases, the Justice Department has supported Trump as he seeks to block congressional investigations of his finances \u2014 by suing the committees investigating him and suing the companies the committees subpoenaed for records. \u2026 In both cases, Trump said the subpoenas are invalid because they lack a \u2018legitimate legislative purpose\u2019 \u2014 that is, they\u2019re not tied to pending legislation. The argument is that Congress should not investigate the president\u2019s conduct; that\u2019s a job for prosecutors. \u2026\n\n\u201cThe Justice Department also advised the Treasury Department to refuse a request from the House Ways and Means Committee to inspect Trump\u2019s tax returns. The law says the returns must be turned over when requested. But the Justice Department still said no: Its reasoning was again that there was no \u2018legitimate legislative purpose\u2019 behind the request, so it was not valid. \u2026\n\n\u201cIn the Manhattan district attorney suit, Trump\u2019s private attorneys have turned their arguments from those other lawsuits inside out. Before, they said Congress should not obtain Trump\u2019s records because that job was reserved for prosecutors. In this separate case, Trump\u2019s private attorneys have said prosecutors shouldn\u2019t obtain them. That job, they said, was reserved for Congress. \u2018The Framers eliminated this possibility, and assigned the task to \u2026 Congress\u2019 by creating the impeachment process, Trump\u2019s private attorneys wrote.\u201d\n\nThe White House is now arguing, with the Cipollone letter, that the impeachment process \u2013 cited in New York as a reason why prosecutors shouldn\u2019t get Trump\u2019s tax returns \u2013 is illegitimate.\n\nTrump departs the Oval Office after giving the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Ed Meese. (Alex Brandon/AP)\n\n-- On Monday, the federal judge in the New York case dismissed Trump\u2019s lawsuit seeking to block the Manhattan district attorney from obtaining his tax returns. Judge Victor Marrero broadly rejected Trump\u2019s claim that a president cannot be investigated by any prosecutor, anywhere, for any reason. He said this position it \u201crepugnant\u201d to the concept that no man is above the law. \u201cThe Court cannot square a vision of presidential immunity that would place the President above the law with the text of the Constitution, the historical record, the relevant case law\u201d or any other authority, the judge wrote in a 75-page ruling. \u201cThis Court cannot endorse such a categorical and limitless assertion of presidential immunity from judicial process.\u201d The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has issued a stay of the subpoena, pending Trump's appeal.\n\n-- It\u2019s not just Marrero and Howell: Trump\u2019s over-the-top claims of absolute executive power have been rejected by other federal judges, as well. In May, for example, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta of the District of Columbia compared Trump to James Buchanan who claimed in 1860 that the House didn\u2019t have the power to investigate him. \u201cBuchanan feared that, if the House were to exercise such authority, it \u2018would establish a precedent dangerous and embarrassing to all my successors, to whatever political party they might be attached,\u2019\u201d Mehta wrote in his 41-page opinion. \u201cSome 160 years later, President Donald J. Trump has taken up the fight of his predecessor.\u201d\n\nMehta rejected an effort by Trump\u2019s lawyers to quash a subpoena from the House Oversight Committee for records from the president\u2019s accounting firm. He offered a meaty history lesson for a president who has never cared much for the discipline, citing Woodrow Wilson, Warren Harding, Nixon and Clinton as he outlined why the House is entitled to records it seeks. After recounting the Whitewater, Watergate and Teapot Dome investigations, Mehta concluded: \u201cThis court is not prepared to roll back the tide of history.\u201d\n\nBut such rebukes have not stopped Trump and his team from defiantly trying to roll back the tide of history anyway.\n\n-- It seems increasingly inevitable that the Supreme Court will be forced to adjudicate some of these disputes. Perhaps Trump is counting on the five justices appointed by Republican presidents, including his picks Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch, to protect him. When Nixon\u2019s refusal to turn over White House tapes got to the high court in 1974, he lost unanimously in U.S. v. Nixon.\n\n\u201cMaybe Nixon was wrongly decided,\u201d Kavanaugh once said, \u201cheresy though it is to say so.\u201d\n\nTHE LATEST DEVELOPMENTS ON IMPEACHMENT:\n\n-- CNN reports that Trump personally urged Secretary of Energy Rick Perry, as well as Sondland and Volker, to deal directly with Giuliani when the Ukrainian president sought to meet with him: Trump \u201csaid that if President Volodymyr Zelensky wanted to meet with him, Giuliani would have to be convinced first, one source said. \u2018If they can satisfy Rudy, they can satisfy the President,\u2019 a person familiar with the meeting said.\u201d Needless to say, this is a clear circumvention of official channels.\n\n-- Sondland revealed during a July interview with an English-language Ukrainian television network that he spoke with Trump just before the president called Zelensky. Philip Bump reports: \u201cA call between Sondland and Trump shortly before the Trump-Zelensky call could be significant, given one of those newly released text messages. At 8:36 a.m., Volker texted a Zelensky aide named Andrey Yermak. \u2018Heard from White House,\u2019 Volker wrote. \u2018Assuming President [Zelensky] convinces trump he will investigate / \u2018get to the bottom of what happened\u2019 in 2016, we will nail down date for visit to Washington. Good luck!\u2019 \u2026 Sondland\u2019s reference to speaking to Trump around the same time hints at the possibility of a more direct line from Volker\u2019s offer through Sondland to Trump. In the July 26 interview, Sondland emphasized his close working relationship with Volker and Perry on Ukraine issues. He described the three as the \u2018three amigos\u2019 and said that they had \u2018been tasked with sort of overseeing the Ukraine-U.S. relationship between our contacts at the highest levels of the U.S. government and now the highest levels of the Ukrainian government.\u2019\u201d\n\n-- House Democrats are still trying to negotiate terms to secure the initial whistleblower\u2019s closed-door testimony. From Karoun, Josh, Shane and John: \u201cThe whistleblower wrote in a two-page memo that the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general provided last week to the congressional intelligence committees that a White House official called the substance of the July 25 call \u2018crazy\u2019 and \u2018frightening\u2019 and suggested that Trump may have violated federal election laws by asking Zelensky for a \u2018favor\u2019 of investigating the Bidens. A person familiar with the memo added that the White House official also thought it was improper that the record of the call was moved to a highly classified server. \u2026 The House panels are also expected in the days ahead to issue subpoenas for three Soviet-born operatives \u2014 Lev Parnas, Igor Fruman and Semyon Kislin \u2014 who assisted Giuliani in Ukraine and have thus far resisted congressional summonses.\u201d\n\nLooking to bolster his defense team, Trump is also likely to add former congressman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) to serve as an outside lawyer for the impeachment process, senior White House officials said. Gowdy led the House\u2019s select committee that investigated the 2012 attacks in Benghazi, repeatedly demanding witnesses and documents from the Obama administration.\n\n-- Former national security officials are fighting back as Trump claims that impeachment is the result of a \u201cdeep state\u201d conspiracy against him. David Nakamura reports: \u201cThose who have come forward since the Ukraine impeachment inquiry was announced said they are determined to make clear that Trump\u2019s conduct falls well outside the institutional boundaries of the presidency. \u2018What is happening currently is not normal,\u2019 said Andrea Kendall-Taylor, who served as a U.S. intelligence officer on Russia and Eurasia before stepping down in 2018. \u2018This represents a deviation from the way that these institutions regularly function. And when the institutions don\u2019t work, that is a national security threat.\u2019 She was among 90 national security veterans who signed an open letter published Sunday in support of the anonymous whistleblower who filed a complaint that Trump had acted improperly in asking the Ukrainian president to investigate [Joe] Biden in a July phone call. \u2026\n\n\u201c Roberta Jacobsen , who stepped down as U.S. ambassador to Mexico in 2018, conceded that ex-career officials publicly opposing Trump could contribute to a broader perception of partisanship. But she signed onto the open letter because Trump\u2019s conduct \u2018so violates the rules that you were brought up on and because you think it\u2019s just dangerous for the United States.\u2019\u201d\n\n, who stepped down as U.S. ambassador to Mexico in 2018, conceded that ex-career officials publicly opposing Trump could contribute to a broader perception of partisanship.

During his time in the Navy, he was trained that his commander \u2018was to be obeyed,\u2019 and current officers have a similar responsibility, he said. But now out of uniform, McGrath said he feels compelled to speak out. \u2018This is a unique, deep and long-lasting threat,\u2019 he said.\u201d\n\n-- Democrats want to take a fresh look at whether the sale of anti-tank missiles to Ukraine last year was in any way connected to the country\u2019s decision to halt investigations into Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. From Politico: \u201c\u2018I think that\u2019s all part of the fact finding that members of the six committees need to pursue, and as a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, it\u2019s something that I\u2019m very interested in,\u2019 said Rep. Jim Costa in an interview. House Foreign Affairs Committee members Rep. Gerry Connolly and Tom Malinowski are also interested. \u2026 The U.S. completed its shipment of Javelin anti-tank missiles to Ukraine in May 2018, finalizing a sale that was pushed by lawmakers in both parties and reluctantly approved by Trump in November 2017. In April 2018, then-Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko ordered Ukraine\u2019s top anti-corruption prosecutor Yuriy Lutsenko\u2014who\u2019d been tasked with investigating corruption that occurred under former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych\u2014to stop cooperating with special counsel Robert Mueller.\u201d\n\n-- China publicly rejected Trump\u2019s call to investigate Joe Biden and his son. From the South China Morning Post: \u201c\u2018China has long pursued the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries,\u2019 foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said on Tuesday. \u2018We have no intention of intervening in the domestic affairs of the United States. Our position is consistent and clear.\u2019 \u2026 In addition to maintaining the non-interference principle, a Chinese investigation into the Bidens would be likely to offend both Democrats and Republicans, further intensifying concerns that China is interfering in U.S. presidential election.\u201d\n\n-- Trump loyalists in the House were blindsided when the White House blocked Sondland from testifying. They're now pressing for better coordination as impeachment moves forward. From Bloomberg: Ohio Republican Rep. Jim Jordan, \u201cwho is the senior Republican on the Oversight and Reform Committee, expressed regret that the panels wouldn\u2019t hear from Sondland on Tuesday. But he said he understands why the State Department blocked the deposition ... House Republicans are holding almost daily strategy sessions led by Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy to combat the Democratic impeachment effort. Tuesday\u2019s episode was the latest in what some Republicans have complained is the less-than-tight coordination between the White House and Trump\u2019s Republican defenders in Congress.\u201d\n\n-- Rep. Ralph Abraham, the Republican candidate for governor of Louisiana, introduced a resolution to expel Nancy Pelosi from the House, calling her efforts to investigate the president a \u201cvicious crusade\u201d and \u201cnothing more than a politically-motivated witch hunt.\u201d The resolution, which stands no chance of passing, hasn\u2019t secured many Republican co-sponsors, per Fox News. But it's a reminder of the politics of impeachment in a place like Louisiana.\n\n-- Former U.S. attorney Joseph E. diGenova, a frequent Trump defender, called whistleblowers \u201csuicide bombers\u201d and accused Democrats of \u201cregicide\u201d during a Fox News interview with Giuliani and Laura Ingraham. \u201cThis is regicide by another name, fake impeachment,\u201d diGenova said as Giuliani sat next to him. \u201cThe Democrats in the House want to destroy the president.\u201d Last month, Fox News's Chris Wallace reported that diGenova and his wife helped Giuliani get \u201coppo research\u201d on Biden. During the interview with Ingraham, diGenova refuted the report as \u201cabsolutely false.\u201d (Allyson Chiu)\n\n-- Notable commentary:\n\nWelcome to the Daily 202, PowerPost's morning briefing for decision-makers.\n\nSign up to receive the newsletter.\n\nWHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:\n\nAn illustration of the three winners of the 2019 Nobel Prize in chemistry.

Steven Reed, a county probate judge, beat television station owner David Woods in a runoff. Half the capital city\u2019s population is black, but whites have continued to maintain a tight grip on power. \u201cMontgomery is one of only three cities in six Deep South states with a population of 100,000 or more that had not previously elected an African American as mayor,\u201d the Montgomery Advertiser notes. \u201cReed was the first African American elected as the county's probate judge in 2012. In 2015, he was the first probate judge in Alabama to issue same-sex marriage licenses. \u2026 Reed said he wants to invest in public transportation and address the issue of brown water and food deserts in some of Montgomery's communities.\u201d\n\nTimes have been changing in the city, where George Wallace once ruled with an iron fist and Jefferson Davis took the oath of office to become the Confederacy\u2019s first president. Last year, a museum to highlight the dark history of lynching opened across from where the city\u2019s slave market used to be. \u201cMontgomery is a city with limitless potential, a city that has no limits outside of our imagination,\u201d Reed said in his victory speech. \u201cThe only thing that can hold us back is our fears. When we come together, there's nothing that we can't accomplish.\u201d\n\n-- The Mystics lost to the Connecticut Sun 90-86, keeping the WNBA title just out of Washington\u2019s reach and bringing a decisive Game 5 to the city.

The Sun led twice by large margins \u2014 18 points in the first quarter and 16 in the third \u2014 only to see its leads disappear at the hands of the sharpshooting Mystics. Leading by one point with less than a minute to go, the Sun survived by keeping Washington from getting a clean look in the game\u2019s final seconds.\u201d\n\nTurkish-backed Syrian rebel fighters head to an area near the Turkish border north of Aleppo. (Nazeer Al-Khatib/Afp Via Getty Images)\n\nTHE NEW WORLD ORDER:\n\n-- President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced today that Turkey\u2019s military has launched a long-expected offensive into northeastern Syria targeting U.S.-allied Syrian Kurdish fighters who have played a central role in battling the Islamic State militant group. (Developing.)\n\n-- Syrian Kurds are mobilizing civilian defenses. Kareem Fahim, Karen DeYoung and Asser Khatab report: \u201cThe Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria announced three days of \u2018public alarm\u2019 and urged people to \u2018go to the border region adjacent to Turkey to carry out their moral duty and show resistance.\u2019\u201d\n\n-- Pentagon officials said the U.S. won\u2019t take over Islamic State prisons if Kurdish forces withdraw. Missy Ryan and Liz Sly report: \u201cKurdish officials said that guards were still in place at the more than 20 prisons and camps under their control but were prepared to move, raising the possibility that about 11,000 militants and their families could escape. U.S. officials \u2026 said the Pentagon did not have enough forces to oversee the prisons if those facilities were left unguarded, nor a mandate to do so. \u2026 The potential for a battle between two American allies in Syria has intensified the Trump administration\u2019s struggle to find a solution for the detainees and about 70,000 displaced women and children housed in separate camps, some of whom are militant supporters.\u201d\n\n-- The furor over the decision to pull American troops out of northeastern Syria began with the poorly conceived White House statement about a phone conversation between Trump and Erdogan. \u201cThe results have been rapid and remain unpredictable \u2014 and, in the view of critics, amount to the abandonment of America\u2019s Syrian Kurdish allies to a massive Turkish military assault,\" Karen DeYoung and Kareem Fahim write at the top of a lengthy tick-tock on the SNAFU. \"National security aides \u2014 most of whom had not seen the call announcement the night before \u2014 quickly mobilized to repair the damage, and the presidential tone changed. ...\n\n\u201cAn administration official said Mazloum Kobane Abdi, the commander of the Kurdish-dominated Syrian Democratic Force, sent a message to U.S. forces in Syria saying he knew that the recent decisions were not theirs and that they would always be brothers. \u2026 Early Wednesday morning, the Islamic State sought to take advantage of the focus on the border to the north by staging an attack shortly before 2 a.m. in the group\u2019s former capital, Raqqa, according to a statement from the SDF. Three suicide bombers attacked SDF military positions in the city and a gun battle erupted with an unknown number of militants nearby, the statement said. As allies and regional actors try to unscramble the president\u2019s conflicting statements, Erdogan\u2019s government has remained on message, insisting that the invasion is a certainty and that its target, the SDF, is an imminent threat to Turkey\u2019s national security.\u201d\n\n-- Joseph Votel, who oversaw the campaign against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria as the leader of U.S. Central Command, and counterterrorism expert Elizabeth Dent, who worked with the State Department\u2019s Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, argue in a must-read piece for the Atlantic that Trump's decision threatens to undo years of gains: \u201cOver four years, the SDF freed tens of thousands of square miles and millions of people from the grip of ISIS. Throughout the fight, it sustained nearly 11,000 casualties. By comparison, six U.S. service members, as well as two civilians, have been killed in the anti-ISIS campaign. Key to this effective relationship was mutual trust, constant communication, and clear expectations. The partnership was not without its difficulties. That included working through the December 2018 announcement of our sudden departure and our subsequent agreement with Turkey to pursue a security mechanism for the border areas. But each time, the strong mutual trust built on the ground between our military members and the SDF preserved our momentum. The sudden policy change this week breaks that trust at the most crucial juncture and leaves our partners with very limited options.\"\n\n-- Foreign affairs columnist David Ignatius is hearing that the Russians are working in cahoots with Ankara:\n\n...And finally there is the scary issue of the thousands of ISIS detainees and families, who may be breaking out of camps and prisons after Turkish attack--with NO American back-up plan.

Craig Timberg and Tony Romm report: \u201cThe Senate Intelligence Committee, a Republican-led panel that has been investigating foreign electoral interference for more than 2\u00bd years, said in blunt language that Russians worked to damage [Hillary Clinton] while bolstering [Trump] \u2014 and made clear that fresh rounds of interference are likely ahead of the 2020 vote. \u2026 Though the 85-page report itself had extensive redactions, in the visible sections, lawmakers urged their peers in Congress to act, including through the potential adoption of new regulations that would the disclosure of ad buyers more transparent. The report also called on the White House and the executive branch to adopt a more forceful, public role, warning Americans about the ways in which dangerous misinformation can spread while creating new teams within the U.S. government to monitor for threats and share intelligence with industry.\n\n\u201cThe recommendations call for Silicon Valley to more extensively share intelligence among companies \u2026 The committee report recounts extensive Russian manipulation of Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Twitter, Google and other major platforms with the goal of dividing Americans, suppressing African American turnout and helping elect Trump president. \u2026 [The] report described how efforts to manipulate Americans over social media operated in multiple steps. Fake accounts operating from Russia started by ingratiating themselves into online conversations using nonpolitical comments, then switched to overtly partisan content. \u2026 The report also noted that the paid advertisements on Facebook, Instagram and other platforms were much less important than the free viral context created by teams of Russian disinformation operatives working across multiple platforms.\u201d\n\n-- A top secret unit within the Russian intelligence system skilled in subversion, sabotage and assassination is attempting to destabilize Europe, security officials say. Michael Schwirtz reports in the New York Times: \u201cThe group, known as Unit 29155, has operated for at least a decade, yet Western officials only recently discovered it. Intelligence officials in four Western countries say it is unclear how often the unit is mobilized and warn that it is impossible to know when and where its operatives will strike. \u2026 Hidden behind concrete walls at the headquarters of the 161st Special Purpose Specialist Training Center in eastern Moscow, the unit sits within the command hierarchy of the Russian military intelligence agency, widely known as the G.R.U. \u2026 In the months before the 2016 presidential election, American officials say two G.R.U. cyber units, known as 26165 and 74455, hacked into the servers of the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign, and then published embarrassing internal communications.\"\n\n-- The Taliban vowed to launch massive attacks on Afghanistan\u2019s election day. The chaos was relatively small. Susannah George reports: \u201cThe relative calm on election day is a rare success for the country\u2019s military and police forces, which have struggled in combat with the Taliban. Afghan and American officials attribute the low toll to aggressive planning and coordination, after months of intense military pressure on Taliban strongholds.\"\n\n-- A new U.N. report details dozens of civilian deaths \u2013 including 14 children -- in U.S. airstrikes against Taliban drug labs. (Sayed Salahuddin)\n\n-- American companies are scrambling to avoid fallout with China over Hong Kong. Jeanne Whalen, Ben Golliver and Steven Zeitchik report: \u201cTiffany & Co., which relies on the Chinese market for double-digit revenue growth, scrapped a global advertising image that some in China perceived as supporting Hong Kong protesters, even though the company said the image was taken weeks before the demonstrations began. Blizzard Entertainment, the Irvine, Calif.-based video-game giant, suspended a professional player for one year for reportedly shouting \u2018Liberate Hong Kong!\u2019 during an interview. \u2026 With Hong Kong in its fourth month of street protests, China is increasingly imposing the same strictures on what\u2019s said about it beyond its borders.\u201d\n\n-- In an internal memo, ESPN ordered that any discussion of Houston Rockets\u2019 General Manager Daryl Morey avoid political discussions about China or Hong Kong and instead focus on basketball, per Deadspin.\n\n-- An anonymous official in Boris Johnson\u2019s office said negotiations with European leaders over Brexit were \u201cessentially impossible\u201d after the British prime minister concluded a phone call with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Loveday Morris and William Booth report: \u201cEuropean officials hit back that Johnson was trying to blame them for a breakdown in talks. \u2018What\u2019s at stake is not winning some stupid blame game,\u2019 tweeted European Council President Donald Tusk. \u2018At stake is the future of Europe and the UK as well as the security and interests of our people. You don\u2019t want a deal, you don\u2019t want an extension, you don\u2019t want to revoke, quo vadis?\u2019 Tusk challenged Johnson, mimicking the prime minister\u2019s frequent use of Latin. \u2018Quo vadis?\u2019 means \u2018Where are you going?\u2019\u201d\n\n-- Ecuadoran President Len\u00edn Moreno moved the government out of the capital of Quito as protests grow. Rachelle Krygier reports: \u201cLeonidas Iza, president of the Indigenous Farmers Movement of Cotopaxi, said the protesters weren\u2019t trying to oust Moreno but to pressure him to reverse his policies.\u201d\n\nTHE DOMESTIC AGENDA:\n\n-- Trump\u2019s nominees could play a pivotal role as the Supreme Court decides on protections for gay and transgender workers. During its first day on the case, the court appeared divided. Robert Barnes and Ann E. Marimow report: \u201cChief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., whose questions in court gave no signal about his views on the case, was careful with pronouns, at one point using the neutral \u2018they\u2019 to refer to an individual. Lawyers for the gay and transgender individuals challenging their firings seemed to pitch their arguments to Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, a conservative who advocates a close textual reading of statutes. During the sexual orientation arguments, he pushed lawyers for the government and the employers to acknowledge that sex seemed to be at least a \u2018contributing cause\u2019 to the terminations. But during arguments in the transgender case, he wondered if \u2018when a case is really close,\u2019 courts should make decisions that might cause \u2018massive social upheaval\u2019 rather than leave it up to Congress. [Kavanaugh], the court\u2019s newest member, kept a low profile during the two hours of argument, asking only one question. There seemed little doubt that the court\u2019s four liberal members would find that Title VII covered gay and transgender workers. But one of the court\u2019s five conservatives would have to join them to form a majority.\u201d\n\n-- A federal judge said the FBI\u2019s searches for information on Americans \u2013 including its own personnel \u2013 violated the law. Ellen Nakashima reports: \u201cCourt opinions disclosed Tuesday by U.S. intelligence officials also show that, despite concerns raised by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC), the FBI resisted for nearly a year to change its procedures for tracking its queries for the data of Americans. \u2026 In the most noteworthy violation disclosed Tuesday, the FBI in March 2017 conducted queries on databases using more than 70,000 email addresses or phone numbers of FBI employees or contractors. The bureau proceeded with the queries despite the advice of its general counsel, though it did not review the results, according to an October 2018 court opinion.\u201d\n\n-- Nearly one million migrants were arrested along the Mexico border in the 2019 fiscal year, the most since 2007. Nick Miroff reports: \u201cMark Morgan, the acting CBP commissioner, told reporters at a White House briefing that more than 52,000 migrants were taken into custody in September at U.S. ports of entry and between them, a decline of 18 percent from August. Overall, U.S. border authorities made 977,509 arrests during fiscal 2019, up 88 percent from last year and the highest total since 2007. Morgan called it a \u2018staggering\u2019 increase. Arrests by U.S. border agents reached an all-time high of 1.6 million in 2000, but Department of Homeland Security officials insist that the migration wave they faced this year is unlike anything in the past.\u201d\n\n-- Seven Ivy League schools, plus Stanford, Northwestern and 10 other elite schools, filed an amicus brief with the Supreme Court opposing the Trump administration\u2019s effort to roll back the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, per the Stanford Daily.\n\n-- Last year, for the first time in history, U.S. billionaires paid a lower tax rate than the working class. Christopher Ingraham reports: \u201c\u2018The Triumph of Injustice,\u2019 by economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman of the University of California at Berkeley, presents a first-of-its kind analysis of Americans\u2019 effective tax rates since the 1960s. It finds that in 2018 the average effective tax rate paid by the richest 400 families in the country was 23 percent, a full percentage point lower than the 24.2 percent rate paid by the bottom half of American households. In 1980, by contrast, the 400 richest had an effective tax rate of 47 percent. In 1960, their tax rate was as high as 56 percent. The effective tax rate paid by the bottom 50 percent, by contrast, has changed little over time.\"\n\n-- Trump is considering weakening Obama-era rules that curb corporate inversions. From Bloomberg: \u201cThe Treasury is looking at regulations intended to prevent American firms from lowering their U.S. tax bills by shifting income to their offshore branches that they can loan to their domestic branches and deduct the interest off their Internal Revenue Service bills. The department is also contemplating repealing them entirely to replace them with something more business-friendly.\"\n\n-- Education Secretary Betsy DeVos faces potential sanctions or a finding that she\u2019s in contempt of court for continuing to collect on the debt of former students at the bankrupt Corinthian Colleges. From Bloomberg: \u201c\u2018I\u2019m not sure if this is contempt or sanctions,\u2019 U.S. Magistrate Judge Sallie Kim told lawyers for the Education Department at a hearing Monday in San Francisco. \u2018I\u2019m not sending anyone to jail yet but it\u2019s good to know I have that ability.\u2019 The judge said she was \u201castounded\u201d that the department violated her June order to stop collecting the debts from students, who had been promised refunds of their tuition. \u2018At best it is gross negligence, at worst it\u2019s an intentional flouting of my order,\u2019 Kim warned lawyers.\u201d\n\n-- The acting director of the Department of Interior\u2019s Bureau of Land Management has repeatedly denied climate change and in a 1990s speech said there is no ozone hole. From CNN: \u201cWilliam Perry Pendley was appointed by Interior Secretary David Bernhardt \u2026 in July 2019. \u2026 In other comments uncovered during a CNN KFile review of his social media activity, writings and public appearances, Pendley cited an anti-Muslim figure to claim Islam was at war with the United States, compared undocumented immigrants to cancer and blamed them for diseases.\"\n\n-- One of the nation\u2019s largest utilities began shutting off power for what could be nearly a million Californians in an attempt to lessen the risk of wildfires. Scott Wilson reports: \u201cThe intentional shut-off encompasses more than half of the state\u2019s 58 counties and spans much of Northern California, where two of the deadliest fires in state history have occurred in the past two years. It is the most extensive planned power outage ever employed in California and represents a fresh, expensive inconvenience to residents of a state confronting the sharpening consequences of a changing climate. Pacific Gas & Electric, the utility behind the power shut-off, was found responsible for sparking one of those fires, which blazed through Paradise, Calif., last year.\"\n\n-- Four school systems are suing Juul, saying the e-cigarette company spurred a vaping epidemic in students. Moriah Balingit reports: \u201cThe four districts \u2014 Olathe Public Schools in Kansas, Three Village Central School District in New York, Francis Howell School District in Missouri and La Conner School District \u2014 contend that Juul purposefully marketed to teenagers and engineered products to make them popular among young people. The sleek devices emit a thin vapor and look like USB drives, making them difficult for adults to detect. \u2026 The fallout has also included expenses related to discipline, with student suspensions skyrocketing in some schools. In the Francis Howell School District, suspensions for nicotine infractions more than quadrupled over the past four years, with 248 students punished in the 2018-2019 school year, according to the lawsuit.\u201d\n\n-- The Dallas police identified three suspects in the fatal shooting of Joshua Brown, a key witness in the trial of Amber Guyger, the white former officer convicted of murdering her unarmed black neighbor, Botham Jean, in his own home. Police denied any wrongdoing in Brown\u2019s death. Brittany Shammas and Reis Thebault report: \u201cJoshua Brown was shot to death on Friday, 10 days after he testified against Guyger. The timing fueled rumors that his role in the trial had made him a target, with some alleging a conspiracy by local law enforcement. But on Tuesday, police emphatically denied the claims and identified three suspects in the shooting, men they said who traveled from Alexandria, La., to Dallas to buy drugs from Brown and then exchanged gunfire with him when the deal went south. \u2026 The Brown family lawyer, who also represents Jean\u2019s family, continued his calls for the Dallas department to recuse itself from the investigation.\"\n\n2020 WATCH:\n\n-- Bernie Sanders said he was \u201cdumb\u201d to ignore symptoms presaging the heart attack he suffered last week. Chelsea Janes reports: Sanders \u201curged others not to make the same mistake. He also admitted that he will have to reduce the number of campaign events he holds a day because of his health. \u2018During this campaign, I\u2019ve been doing in some cases three or four rallies a day, running all over the state \u2014 Iowa, New Hampshire, wherever,\u2019 Sanders told reporters outside his home in Burlington, Vt. \u2018And yet I, in the last month or two, just was more fatigued than I usually have been. And I should have listened to those symptoms.\u2019\n\n\"Sanders visited a cardiologist Tuesday morning, and when he returned, he told reporters, \u2018We\u2019re gonna change the nature of the campaign a bit.\u2019 \u2018Probably not doing four rallies a day,\u2019 said Sanders, who had adopted a more furious campaign schedule than many of his much younger opponents. Sanders, who has committed to releasing his medical records before the first primary votes but has not yet done so, said Tuesday he would provide the information at \u2018the appropriate time.\u2019 ... Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) \u2014 fellow septuagenarians who join Sanders at the top of most polls \u2014 have also committed to releasing their medical records.\u201d\n\n-- Tragic: Sanders\u2019s daughter-in-law, Rain\u00e8 Riggs, died at 46 last weekend, just two days after being diagnosed with neuroendocrine cancer. Riggs, a neuropsychologist and the wife of Levi Sanders, passed away the day the senator returned to Vermont after suffering the heart attack. (Daily Beast)\n\n-- Warren, facing questions from critics, reiterated that she was fired from her teaching job because she was pregnant. Annie Linskey reports: \u201cThe anecdote about her tenure at Riverdale elementary school in northern New Jersey is a key part of her stump speech, used to connect with women in her audiences. In Warren\u2019s telling, the episode is straightforward and echoes an experience that many other young women had in the 1970s. But some political adversaries seized on a newly surfaced video of Warren telling the story with a different emphasis \u2014 in 2007, before she was in elected office \u2014 along with freshly uncovered school board documents from the early 1970s to raise doubts about Warren\u2019s account. Republicans also compared the issue to Warren\u2019s past claim that she was Native American, which resulted in her apology last year to tribes ... Yet while the story has played repeatedly on Fox News and conservative outlets, it is not clear the new materials contradict Warren\u2019s recounting of the episode in a material way. \u2026 Warren\u2019s campaign accounted for the different explanations by saying she has opened up more about episodes of past discrimination now that she is a public official. She made her first run for office in 2012.\u201d\n\n-- Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) endorsed Biden for president, snubbing California's junior senator, Kamala Harris, per the San Francisco Chronicle.\n\n-- After the Trump campaign threatened to sue a Minneapolis arena for passing along a half-million-dollar security bill from the city to cover costs of the president\u2019s political rally there later this week, the venue withdrew the request, according to Trump\u2019s campaign manager. Colby Itkowitz reports: \u201cMinneapolis officials told the Target Center, where Trump is slated to appear Thursday night, that it would be responsible for the $530,000 the city says it will need to beef up security for [the] visit. The Target Center planned to pass that bill along to the Trump campaign and said the campaign would have to pay or it could not use the arena. But after a day of angry tweets from the president, mostly directly at the Democratic Minneapolis mayor, the Trump campaign announced Tuesday evening that the arena will not be canceling the contract and the campaign will not be paying any additional fees. \u2026 It was not immediately clear whether the Target Center or the city will absorb the costs.\u201d\n\n-- It is worth remembering the Trump campaign has not paid at least 10 cities for the public safety costs of hosting the president, per the Center for Public Integrity.\n\n-- A new tool from YouTube allows political ad buyers to book slots through February, causing a rush among campaign staffers. From the Journal: \u201c\u2018People acted quickly with what was available,\u2019 said a staffer for one of the Democratic front-runners, who added that the campaign snatched up slots in early voting states such as Iowa and South Carolina. Already a big destination for digital ads, YouTube \u2026 is stepping up its efforts to snag more political-ad dollars away from local television and Facebook Inc. The YouTube initiatives aim to take advantage of the growing sums being spent on advertising by a historically large field of presidential candidates.\u201d\n\n-- The Post is now tracking the House retirements from the 116th Congress, which so far are overwhelmingly Republican:\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ:\n\nTrump taunted Hillary Clinton by asking her to join the presidential race, to which the former secretary of state responded:\n\nDon\u2019t tempt me.
