Other Silk Road merchants brought news of the flames as they would trave l to other lands.\n\nIt's why the country earned the moniker the \"land of fire.\"\n\nRelated content The mud volcano capital of the world\n\nAncient religion\n\nSuch fires were once plentiful in Azerbaijan, but because they led to a reduction of gas pressure underground, interfering with commercial gas extraction, most have been snuffed out.\n\nYanar Dag is one of the few remaining examples, and perhaps the most impressive.\n\nAt one time they played a key role in the ancient Zoroastrian religion, which was founded in Iran and flourished in Azerbaijan in the first millennium BCE.\n\nl e v a r t\n\nFor Zoroastrians, fire is a link between humans and the supernatural world, and a medium through which spiritual insight and wisdom can be gained. It's purifying, life-sustaining and a vital part of worship.\n\nToday, most visitors who arrive at the no-frills Yanar Dag visitors' center come for the spectacle rather than religious fulfillment.\n\nThe experience is most impressive at night, or in winter. When snow falls, the flakes dissolve in the air without ever touching the ground, says Rahila.\n\nDespite the claimed antiquity of the Yanar Dag flames -- some argue that this particular fire may only have been ignited in the 1950s -- it's a long 30-minute drive north from the center of Baku just to see it. The center offers only a small cafe and there's not much else in the area.\n\nRelated content Naftalan: The Azerbaijan resort where guests bathe in crude oil\n\nAteshgah Fire Temple\n\nFor a deeper insight into Azerbaijan's history of fire worship, visitors should head east of Baku to Ateshgah Fire Temple.\n\n\"Since ancient times, they think that [their] god is here,\" says our guide, as we enter the pentagonal complex which was built in the 17th and 18th century by Indian settlers in Baku.\n\nFire rituals at this site date back to the 10th century or earlier. The name Ateshgah comes from the Persian for \"home of fire\" and the centerpiece of the complex is a cupola-topped altar shrine, built upon a natural gas vent.\n\nA natural, eternal flame burned here on the central altar until 1969, but these days the fire is fed from Baku's main gas supply and is only lit for visitors.\n\nThe temple is associated with Zoroastrianism but it's as a Hindu place of worship that its history is better documented.\n\nMerchants and ascetics\n\nBuilt like a caravanserai-style travelers' inn, the complex has a walled courtyard surrounded by 24 cells and rooms.\n\nThese were variously used by pilgrims, passing merchants (whose donations were a vital source of income) and resident ascetics, some of whom submitted themselves to ordeals such as lying on caustic quicklime, wearing heavy chains, or keeping an arm in one position for years on end.\n\nThe temple fell out of use as a place of worship in the late 19th century, at a time when the development of the surrounding oil fields meant that veneration of Mammon was gaining a stronger hold.", "description": "Azerbaijan is known as the \"Land of Fire\" for the naturally occurring fires that burn continuously on the Absheron Peninsula, most famously at Yanar Dag mountainside.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/w_1200/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F181030090641-yanar-dag-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2018-10-31"}
