The last line has Apfel, asked how she used to dress as a teenager, innocuously responding: \"Oh my God, I can't remember that far back.\"\n\nHowever, the translation submitted by Uniqlo's Korean arm subtitled its version slightly differently, reading: \"I can't remember things that happened more than 80 years ago.\"\n\nCritics claimed that Uniqlo intentionally translated the older woman's line as such in order to mock victims of sexual slavery as it could refer to the period of the second world war, when the Korean Peninsula was under Japan's brutal colonial rule and an estimated 200,000 women - mostly from Korea - were pushed into sexual slavery in front-line brothels.\n\nThe phrase \"Uniqlo comfort women\" - in reference to the euphemism commonly used to describe the victims of sexual slavery - was among the most-searched terms on Naver, South Korea's largest online platform, over the weekend, and demonstrators protested outside Uniqlo shops on Monday.\n\nUniqlo has denied any intention to cause upset.\n\n\"We did not have any political motive,\" the company said in a statement. \"However, we decided to halt the advertisement after taking into considerations that some people were disturbed by that part of the contents.\"\n\nThe company added that the translation was intended to emphasise the age difference between the two models and to make it easier for South Korean customers to understand the meaning of the statement.\n\nSee how the iconic @IrisBApfel styles her UNIQLO Fleece.
