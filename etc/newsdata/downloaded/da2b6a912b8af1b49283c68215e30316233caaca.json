Once you identify these, find companies which are set to become leaders in the new market.\n\nTechnology is one of those sectors which tends to present many new developments. These companies mint billionaires from founders and make millions more for the savvy individual investors who get into them early. And one of the big new-new things in technology is Artificial Intelligence stocks, or AI.\n\nAI is a big blanket of technology and application. Even some of the most mundane bits of mechanicals can be called AI. Take most modern transmissions in cars. Transmissions used to be dumb. They shifted in pre-determined patterns if automatic \u2014 or merely followed the shifts from manual inputs from drivers. But today\u2019s automatic units including from ZF (a public-private company in Germany) have learning capabilities which adapt, learning how the driver of the car operates.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThen there is the example that I use on a daily basis involves artificial intelligence (AI). I have a Bloomberg Terminal, which is a vital tool for pulling all sorts of data and information on any economy, market or security. But it also comes with over 2,700 journalists around the globe generating news and other stories each and every day.\n\nBut interestingly, Bloomberg has adopted AI which combs basic company news releases as well as economic data releases and other basic news and lets its army of robotic writers do the work which increasingly provides a larger percentage of its posted stories.\n\nNothing yet subjective in the robotic writing \u2014 but you never know how this will develop. By the way, I am not a robot.\n\nBut AI has a lot further to go. It can and will lead to autonomous cars and new medical and surgical treatments, as well as design of goods and a host of other applications. This also includes trading of stocks, bonds and other securities. But like for any newer, developing and evolving technology, AI has a lot than can go wrong for individual companies. So, I\u2019ll present some artificial intelligence stocks that are proven in their capabilities and will be there for the longer run. And to boot, they also pay dividends.\n\n\n\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence Stocks to Buy: Hercules Capital (HTGC)\n\nArtificial Intelligence Stocks to Buy: Hercules Capital More\n\nHercules Capital Total Return Source Bloomberg\n\nHercules Capital (NYSE:HTGC) is based in the U.S. tech mecca of Palo Alto, California, with offices around the nation. It focuses on working with technology companies and has a good track record of financing startups that become bold-faced names in the tech market. The company makes loans and provides other financing, and it also takes equity participation in its portfolio companies. It then works with them like bankers used to do by guiding them along to an exit strategy of being bought or through an IPO.\n\nIt has numerous hardware and software companies that are part and parcel of the AI sector.\n\nIts net interest margin (NIM) which is measure of the cost of funding against interest earnings is ample at 8.9% and the efficiency ratio is good at 52.5% (the lower the ratio, the greater the profitability). Revenues are up 8.8% for the trailing year. That feeds a nice annual dividend stream, including regular special distributions, yielding around 10%.\n\nIt is a proven performer \u2014 including for the year to date, with a return so far of 18%, before you count in the dividends.\n\n\n\n\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT)\n\nMicrosoft Total Return, Source: Bloomberg\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a major provider of all sorts of software and services which are mission critical for AI. The company offers software and systems which are used to design and operate AI components and whole systems. And to make AI truly work \u2014 particularly with remote devices, including autonomous cars \u2014 you need cloud computing. And Microsoft is currently the second largest cloud company with its Azure services unit.\n\nStory continues", "description": "One of the best ways to invest for longer-term growth is to identify massive, ground-shifting developments.
