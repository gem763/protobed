(Image: TV Tokyo)\n\nHe\u2019s finally bloody done it. Ash Ketchum, star of the Pok\u00e9mon anime and perennial clutcher of defeat from the jaws of victory, is finally the winner of a Regional Pok\u00e9mon League. The world of Pok\u00e9mon fandom is rejoicing with him, including... himself?\n\nWell, actually it\u2019s sort of herself: in the first eight seasons of the western dub of the Pok\u00e9mon anime, Ash was voiced by voiceover actress Veronica Taylor. Although since then, all the way up to the currently airing Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon anime, Ash has been voiced by Sarah Natochenny, to many fans Taylor is the Ash voice they grew up with, and Taylor clearly still relishes just how much the character means to fans.\n\nWhich means that today\u2019s news is extra cause for celebration. The latest episode of Sun and Moon aired in Japan this weekend, and saw Ash triumph over Gladion to become the inaugural winner of the Alola Region Pok\u00e9mon League.\n\nWhile previously in the anime Ash has won major tournaments like the Orange Island Challenge and Battle Frontier, neither held the same status as either the anime or the video game series\u2019 traditional Regional League competitions.\n\nAll the way from Kanto up to Kalos, Ash has faced crushing defeat after crushing defeat in the anime versions of the Regional League battles \u2014 the Kalos loss in Pok\u00e9mon XYZ being the closest his got, causing heartbreak among fans when it seemed like he had a killer Pok\u00e9mon team and was, at last, about to break his losing streak. But two years later he\u2019s finally done it, and Taylor took to Twitter (with the help of a little Ash figurine) to deliver an inspirational message to the character she once embodied:\n\nCongratulations to Ash Ketchum on winning the Pok\u00e9mon League from Ash\u2019s \u2018younger\u2019 self, circa 1998...yup, hard work, determination, good friends, and a bit of luck pay off! #pokemon #ashketchum #winning pic.twitter.com/JhgRcGJBEy \u2014 Veronica Taylor (@TheVeronicaT) September 15, 2019\n\nHey, Ash! It\u2019s your younger \u2014 but still the same age \u2014 self, Ash Ketchum! Congratulations on winning the Pok\u00e9mon League! I wanna say I always knew you could do it, but really? I didn\u2019t. I only knew that to achieve your goals, you had to train hard \u2014 and that is true, but along the way I\u2019ve found out the importance of constantly learning, and challenging yourself, and being open to new experiences. That, by helping others, you help yourself. And mostly: it\u2019s not winning that counts, but how you play the game. But man, it sure feels good to win. Congratulations, and keep up the good work. I gotta go \u2014 Mum\u2019s making dinner with Mr. Mime. Catch you later!\n\nAwww. It\u2019s nice to see Taylor acknowledge her character\u2019s journey, even if she\u2019s no longer actually a part of it. It makes Ash\u2019s win all the sweeter.", "description": "He\u2019s finally bloody done it.
