Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens, 72,000 of whom have moved to Florida since 2017, when Hurricane Maria devastated the island, and they are immediately eligible to vote. Trump\u2019s handling of the disaster \u2014 and his spreading of unfounded conspiracy theories casting doubt on the death toll \u2014 has left him with a near-rock-bottom 21 percent favorability rating among Boricua voters.\n\nTrump\u2019s support among Haitian Americans has also taken a beating since he last campaigned in their community in 2016 and pledged: \u201cI want to be your greatest champion.\u201d Instead, Trump has threatened to remove the Temporary Protected Status, commonly called TPS, of 56,000 Haitian immigrants who came to the U.S. after a 2011 earthquake rocked the country. And he allegedly called Haiti a \u201c shithole\u201d behind closed doors.\n\n\u201cBad words are bad words. Nobody likes to hear their home country called a shithole,\u201d said Hans Mardy, a Republican Haitian-American activist. \u201cAs a Republican, I would like to see a better collaboration with our government.\u201d\n\nAbout 115,000 Florida voters were born in Haiti, according to data compiled by University of Florida political science professor Dan Smith, and they turn out at higher rates than the statewide average. Smith estimated that about 8 in 10 Haitian-Americans vote Democrat.", "description": "", "authors": ["Politico.Com News"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
