REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann More\n\nStill, the pressure in borrowing costs pushed the New York Fed to dust off its books on an overnight repo facility that it had not used in over a decade. On Tuesday morning, the New York Fed\u2019s trading desk announced that it would inject some liquidity into the banking system by buying up to $75 billion in repurchase agreements, in which the bank buys up Treasury and federal agency debt and sells them back when the repo expires.\n\nThe desk originally planned to carry out the operation at 9:30 a.m. ET, but \u201ctechnical difficulties\u201d delayed the repo program by about 25 minutes.\n\nThe auction ended up generating about $53 billion in agreements.\n\nThe wonky episode added another wrinkle to the Fed\u2019s looming decision on interest rates, as policymakers convene in Washington today for a two-day meeting that will conclude with a rates announcement tomorrow afternoon.\n\nWhy the spike?\n\nIt breaks down to demand in the repo market, where banks and Wall Street dealers lend to one another overnight to meet day-to-day financing needs. With this critical type of short-term funding underpinning the banking system, the repo market is perceived to be the \u201cplumbing\u201d of the U.S. financial system.\n\nIn the case of spiking repo market rates Tuesday, borrowers were looking to cover corporate tax payments and settlement of newly auctioned U.S. Treasuries. With bank reserves hard to come by, some dealers were paying as much as 10% for repo agreements on Tuesday.\n\nAll Markets Summit More\n\nRepo rates across the board rose; the average Treasury general collateral repo rate increased 33 basis points from 2.28% on Friday to 2.61% Tuesday. In the same timeframe, the Secured Overnight Financing Rate jumped from 2.20% to 2.43%.\n\nBoth of those figures breached the high end of the Fed\u2019s target of 2% to 2.25%, the range where the central bank has explicitly said it would like the benchmark interest rate to be.\n\nThe liquidity crunch was anticipated by some shops on Wall Street. Bank of America Merrill Lynch had warned that the due date on corporate tax payments would pull $75 billion to $100 billion out of funding markets. All the while, the U.S. government is hoping to fill its Treasury general account (TGA) by funding $155 billion of debt over the course of September.\n\n\u201cThe TGA rebuild today represents a large reserve drain and the withdrawal of this cash from money markets has materially tightened funding,\u201d BAML wrote Sept. 17.\n\nBut both of these forces appear to be temporary, writes Peter Tchir at Academy Securities. Tchir said that 1-month repo rates and 3-month LIBOR appeared to show no spike, showing that not all corners of overnight financing are flashing alarm signs.\n\n\u201cI think this will all be over in a couple of days and many of us will regret not having gone for a walk outside to get a cup of coffee on this beautiful day,\u201d Tchir wrote Sept. 17.", "description": "The Federal Reserve scrambled to regain control of interest rates as repo markets faced a liquidity crunch.", "authors": ["Brian Cheung"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/8xZGRWF4pSX93qAoYgq60Q--~B/aD0zMjUzO3c9NDg4MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/04891f00-d97f-11e9-a7f7-789f11547897", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
