The FBI, state police, missing persons unit, helicopters and the downtown ship dive crew have been part of the search effort.\n\nDulce's mother reported to authorities that she saw her daughter playing on the swings with her 3-year-old brother, about 30 yards away, while she remained in her car with an 8-year-old relative. The mother said the toddler returned to her car without his sister and she was unable to find her, according to a statement from the Bridgetown Police Department.\n\nGaimari said that authorities expanded the search area about a mile and a half in each direction around the park on Friday, to make sure that they had covered their tracks. He would not say what, if anything, was recovered.\n\nGaimari also addressed rumors that Dulce's mother had been arrested, calling them \"erroneous.\"\n\nBridgeton Police Department\n\nThe New Jersey State Police issued an Amber Alert for Dulce early Wednesday after investigators interviewed people who were in the area at the time she vanished. Based on those interviews, detectives believe Dulce was taken by an unidentified man, who was light-skinned and possibly Hispanic, wearing a black shirt and red pants with orange sneakers. He was described as being around 5-foot-6 to 5-foot-8 and having a thin build, acne and no facial hair.\n\nWebb-McCrae said the investigation has led them to a place where \"we just want to talk to the man described.\" They are looking into the possibility that the person who took Dulce could be in the state or somewhere else in the country.\n\nShe said the public should be aware of any behavioral changes they observe in those close to them, including any sudden changes in appearances, plans, or vehicles.\n\nWebb-McCrae emphasized that state police, her office and the FBI were not concerned with anyone's immigration status if they did come forward with information.\n\nOn Friday, local authorities announced that the reward money for any information had been increased from $25,000.\n\nThe FBI, the prosecutor's office, and the New Jersey State Policemen's Benevolent Association are each contributing $5,000. Two local businesses, Tortilleria El Paisano and Newfield National Bank, are each offering $10,000.\n\nDulce's grandmother addressed the public on Thursday, begging anyone with information to come forward.\n\n\"Please, if you have any information help us find my granddaughter, do not be afraid of the police,\" she said in Spanish at a press conference. \"We have not been able to eat or sleep. You can't imagine what we are going through. We are very sad.\"", "description": "The reward for information on Dulce Maria Alavez, the 5-year-old girl who has been missing since Monday, increased Friday.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/dulce-ht-er-190918_hpMain_v4x3_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
