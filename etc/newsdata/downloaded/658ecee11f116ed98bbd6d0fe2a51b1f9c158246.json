Obviously, our first-team manager has a say.\n\n\u2018Three lads could have possibly gone on loan \u2013 Angel Gomes, Tahith Chong and James Garner \u2013 but he wanted to keep them here and have a look at them on tour. So a decision will be made, no doubt, for January as well. Hopefully, all three will be in the first team and not going anywhere.\n\n\u2018As we know at this club, lads have got into the first team and a lot of it has been through circumstances they\u2019ve got no control over. They\u2019ve been presented with an opportunity and they\u2019ve taken the opportunity so now a couple of them are regulars on the team sheet each week. We\u2019ve had opportunities that have cropped up from nowhere. That\u2019s football.\n\n\u2018Hopefully, some of the lads out on loan now will also catch the eye as some have gone out with a perception of their ability and where they\u2019ll end up but hopefully they\u2019ll come back and people will say maybe we\u2019ve got a little diamond.\u2019\n\nMORE: Manchester United fear difficulties in landing new signings in January transfer window\n\nMORE: Mauricio Pochettino would be \u2018silly\u2019 to leave Tottenham for Manchester United, says Harry Redknapp", "description": "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and his backroom staff at Manchester United are set to decide on the futures of Gomes, Chong and Garner.", "authors": ["Metro Sport Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1179418734_1571147810.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
