The technology has been tested on a S-70 Black Hawk (pictured)\n\nSikorsky, a subsidiary of Lockeheed Martin, which specializes in global security and aerospace, aims to make this autonomous technology easily retrofit on any existing aircraft.\n\nThe firm also has hopes to provide pilots a range of autonomy modes 'so they can commit more time toward their mission, according to company officials, Military.com reported.\n\nThis includes autonomy layered within the fly-by-wire system, semi automatic, electronic avionics system that uses computers to process flight control.\n\nIgor Cherepinsky, Sikorsky Director of Autonomy said in a phone call, 'We will show the world that this is capable... [of] being operated from the ground sometime next year.'\n\nThe helicopter is said to have recorded 54.5 flight hours on the remote-controlled system and has topped speeds of 172 miles per hour.\n\nThe team conducted the first flight test on May 29th in West Palm Beach, Florida and since then, has 'moved on to rate command attitude hold mode,' Chief test pilot Mark Ward explained.\n\nOver the next few months, test pilots will attempt to control the helicopter at wider ranges and different speeds.\n\nAlthough many may see this as a robot takeover in the military, Cherepinsky has noted that the technology is designed 'to augment the pilots, not replace the pilots.'\n\nThe helicopter is said to have recorded 54.5 flight hours on the remote-controlled system and has topped speeds of 172 miles per hour. The team conducted the first flight test on May 29th in West Palm Beach, Florida (pictured)\n\nHowever, it will allow for customers to commit fewer aviation personnel per aircraft by virtue of the system, he said.\n\nThe announcement of the OPV comes just a year after Army pilots demonstrated similar abilities with the Sikorsky Autonomy Research Aircraft, or SARA.\n\nThe modified S-76B used the company's MATRIX software and hardware combinations for its autonomous flight.\n\nThis technology has been routinely tested since 2013 and has been tested in a series of mission tests , according to Defense News.\n\nAlthough many may see this as a robot takeover in the military, Cherepinsky has noted that the technology is designed 'to augment the pilots, not replace the pilots\n\n'MATRIX is designed to improve flight operations and augment the pilot in the difficult flight conditions where helicopters are called on to operate: among wires, trees and buildings and in dangerous weather conditions,' Cherepinsky separately told Military.com.\n\n'We are developing this system to the highest standards for not only military qualification, but also working closely with the FAA on certification, enabling MATRIX technology to be used on military, commercial and civil fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft that carry both cargo and passengers.'", "description": "New technology could transform military copters into a remote-controlled, pilotless war machine that tops speeds of 172 MPH.
