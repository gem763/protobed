As CNET reported in May, Google began rolling out speed limits, speed cameras and mobile speed cameras in over 40 countries. A month earlier it began testing reports for slowdowns to help drivers seek other routes to avoid traffic jams.\n\nNow iPhone owners who use Google Maps will gain the ability to report crashes, speed traps and traffic slowdowns, bringing iOS in line with Android.\n\nAnd thanks to Apple CarPlay support for Google Maps, iPhone owners should be able to see some of these Waze features on the infotainment system.\n\nGoogle is also enabling reports of four new types of incidents for both Android and iOS. These include construction, lane closures, disabled vehicles, and objects like debris on the road.\n\nTo report an incident, users can tap on the information bar at the bottom of the app, tap the + sign and then tap 'Add a report'. Users can choose between Crash, Speed Trap, Slowdown, Construction, Lane closure, Disabled vehicle, or Object on road.\n\nThe integration of Waze features in Google Maps executes what many believed Google would do after acquiring Waze in 2013, but that's really only started to ramp up over the past year.\n\nThe iOS features and the new incident report types are rolling out globally this week, according to Google.", "description": "Google Maps users on iOS and Android can now enjoy top features from Google-owned Waze.", "authors": ["Liam Tung"], "top_image": "https://zdnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/18/ef1aeddf-daa9-4a92-a203-d83689b1f7b9/thumbnail/770x578/7aa20eccd047c159e06090ea5bff9bd9/gettyimages-10356842641.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
