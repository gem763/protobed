We are finally seeing some competition coming to this market, especially for entry-level, small businesses. Last week Capitec announced its acquisition of Mercantile Bank with the intention of starting a business bank early next year and this week FNB launched its SME business banking offering, First Business Zero.\n\nFirst Business Zero is a digital platform business bank which will be available from 1 November 2019. Its accounts have zero monthly banking fees and free card swipes, although there are pay-as-you-go fees on transfers and debit orders. The catch is that this is only available for sole proprietor businesses with an annual turnover up to R5 million. So, this is not for the more established, incorporated businesses.\n\nConsidering that a sole proprietor does not have to open a business account and can bank in their own name, it doesn\u2019t necessarily make sense for a sole proprietor to open a business bank account, given the traditionally higher fees.\n\nBy offering a low-cost business banking solution, FNB Business CEO Mike Vacy-Lyle says a small business can start to build up a track record with the bank when it comes to accessing credit. Vacy-Lyle says entrepreneurs struggle to access financing in their own names as they cannot provide payslips. FNB is using a credit score card specifically aimed at small businesses, which will allow automatic credit approval after six months of trading. \u201cBetter use of data, understanding client context, and easier credit applications through scoring and digitisation, as well as lower origination costs, have led to better, deeper credit underwriting and quicker turnaround times. This has made borrowing from FNB Business a much better experience with better pricing,\u201d adds Vacy-Lyle.\n\nAnother feature is the inter-operable QR code for accepting payments. This is available for all business banking customers who can now apply for a QR code linked to their business account. This effectively allows the business\u2019 customers to pay using their SnapScan, Zapper or Masterpass app. The merchant fee is 2% for debit cards and 3% for credit cards.\n\nFNB has invested billions of rands in developing a business banking platform that offers holistic and integrated financial solutions to all types of businesses\n\nDespite paying no monthly account fee, First Business Zero customers also get free access to FNB Business\u2019 suite of free value-added services, including instant accounting software, invoicing, cash flow and payroll. The account also includes an FNB Connect SIM card that includes free data, minutes and SMSes (up to 100MB of data, 30 voice minutes and 30 SMSes).\n\n\u201cFNB has invested billions of rands in developing a business banking platform that offers holistic and integrated financial solutions to all types of businesses. To maintain our market-leading position, it is essential that our business model continually evolve to provide relevant solutions for customers, from learning how to start, run and grow a business to registering a company, opening a bank account, applying for credit and managing the business\u2019 daily affairs,\u201d says Vacy-Lyle, adding that the sole proprietor account is the testing phase in developing a more digitalised solution for all business customers. By the middle of next year FNB expects to roll out solutions for incorporated businesses, although the fees will reflect the complexity of the banking solutions offered.\n\nFree online entrepreneur course\n\nFNB has also launched a new digital, app-based entrepreneurship learning programme (Fundaba) which is available to all FNB customers who can download the programme for free on the FNB banking app.\n\nFundaba is a free interactive e-learning business education platform and comprises multimedia content, such as videos, podcasts, quizzes, templates and tools, for all FNB customers to learn about entrepreneurship and running a business.\n\nJesse Weinberg, head of the SME Segment at FNB, says the bank conducted extensive research and worked with hundreds of local business owners and mentors to provide users with critical knowledge and practical help to assist them as they navigate the business journey; from incubating a business idea to starting, running and growing a business in South Africa. SMEs can also actively share and provide feedback on various educational chapters to constantly increase the effectiveness and relevance of the content.\n\nThe name Fundaba was created through the combination of the South African words \u2018fundi\u2019 (colloquially it means expert) and \u2018indaba\u2019 (discussion). The course consists of 12 modules across four life cycle stages of a business (incubate, start, run and grow) and follows a South African entrepreneur\u2019s journey as he builds his first business - Lebo\u2019s Bakery. All audio and video content is available in five local languages: isiZulu, isiXhosa, Sesotho, English and Afrikaans.", "description": "While competition in the retail banking sector has driven down fees, business banking has remained largely uncompetitive and expensive.
