But 81 true or redshirt freshmen have played in the past two-plus seasons, and 39 players have already made their Bears debut this season.\n\nEnter Grant Teaff, who was 15-6 against Rice as Baylor\u2019s coach from 1972-92, to give the current Bears a history lesson about the rivalry. Teaff addressed the team going into the game after talking to Rhule all summer about Baylor playing Rice for the 82nd time.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing that he gets up there and it\u2019s just, bang, and you have 130 people sitting in the team room just mesmerized at his every word,\u201d Rhule said. \u201cHe really breathed life into the history of this game.\u201d\n\nRhule also has interest in the stadium where President John F. Kennedy gave his \u201cWe choose to go to the moon!\u201d speech in September 1962, and where Super Bowl VIII was played in January 1974.\n\n\u201cTo know the history \u2026 that to me as a fan of college football is really, really important,\u201d Rhule said.\n\nIt is the second weekend in a row that the Owls (0-3) are a big underdog at home against a Big 12 opponent, though their 48-13 loss to Texas came at the home of the NFL\u2019s Houston Texans.\n\nRice has lost 25 of its last 28 games, and is 2-14 under second-year coach Mike Bloomgren.\n\n\u201cI think the toughest part about striving for greatness is the journey,\u201d said Bloomgren, a former Stanford assistant. \u201cWe all want it to happen faster. I promise nobody is in more of a rush than me. But, we\u2019re going to step back and keep working on the process and know that we\u2019re building a very solid culture.\u201d\n\nGETTING GREEN BACK\n\nRice quarterback Wiley Green could return against Baylor. He has been out since sustaining a neck injury early in the Sept. 6 game at Wake Forest. He was getting treatment and was back at practice this week.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t rush him back,\u201d Bloomgren said. \u201cWe think there\u2019s a good chance he\u2019s going to play this Saturday.\u201d\n\nGreen is still a freshman after throwing for 621 yards and four touchdowns in three games last season.\n\nLONG RUNS\n\nBaylor has rushed for 636 yards in its first two games, but Rhule cautioned that the Bears need to realize how some of those yards came and stay focused on that aspect of the game.\n\n\u201cYou know we had a lot of yards, so sometimes \u2026 the offensive line starts thinking hey well we\u2019re really blocking guys well,\u201d Rhule said.\n\nThe Bears have had some long runs, some when runners reversed field. Four different players have runs of at least 38 yards, and their leading rusher is dual-threat backup quarterback Gerry Bohanon.\n\nSCOUTING HELP\n\nRhule said Baylor can absolutely take something from Rice playing one of its Big 12 rivals last week.\n\n\u201cI think it was really good for us to get a picture of some of the things that they did versus a team in Texas who at least structurally is built the same way we are. I thought it was good for us to get that picture,\u201d he said.\n\nEXTRA POINTS\n\nBaylor has won eight in a row against Rice, and leads the overall series 49-30-2. \u2026 Rice linebacker Blaze Alldredge had 4 \u00bd tackles for loss against Texas. The Owls\u2019 18 TFLs are seven more than they had in the first three games last season. \u2026 Baylor\u2019s four-game winning streak is its longest since starting 6-0 in 2016, before the Bears lost 15 of their next 17 games through the 2017 season.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: http://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Baylor and Rice spent eight decades together in the old Southwest Conference, though their meetings have become much more sporadic since the end of that league.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/07/utsa_baylor_football_14673_c0-228-3644-2352_s1770x1032.jpg?c63c9768d3767229866c622d7b204ce8e457ae89", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
