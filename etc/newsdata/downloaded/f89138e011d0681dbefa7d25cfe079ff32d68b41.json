Yesterday, Instagram posts and Twitter threads started popping up alleging that Travis had cheated on Kylie with Rojean Kar (aka YungSweetRo), which...nope! Not so much!\n\n\n\nPhoto credit: Instagram More\n\nE! News reports that Rojean hit up her (now private) Instagram Stories and wrote \"None of these rumors are true, it's just the internet creating a false narrative. Please stop spreading lies & leave him, her & I alone because it's affecting real lives. Thank you.\"\n\n\"Yungsweetro\" posted something about rumors between Travis Scott and her. She said everything is fake. Waht do you think?\ud83d\udc86 pic.twitter.com/M6VkdNQRnr \u2014 BADGALIGGY\ud83d\udc51\ud83c\udf52 (@Badgaliggy) October 3, 2019\n\nGood to know. And meanwhile, an Us Weekly source also reiterated that the cheating rumors are a reach, saying \"Any rumors of cheating are totally and completely false and press should really report on facts rather than rumors and speculation.\u201d\n\nFYI that the real reason for Kylie and Travis' split was non-stop fighting and also (apparently) the fact that Kylie was ready for marriage and another baby, while Travis wasn't. But either way Kylie says she and Travis are working on their \"friendship\" and concentrating on their daughter Stormi:\n\nTravis and i are on great terms and our main focus right now is Stormi \u203c\ufe0f our friendship and our daughter is priority \u2014 Kylie Jenner (@KylieJenner) October 3, 2019\n\nP.S. Kylie's also not actually dating her ex-boyfriend Tyga again (despite rolling up to his recording studio late Tuesday night) in case that whole thing was stressing you out. Which let's be real: it was.\n\nYou Might Also Like\n\n\n\n", "description": "*cancels plans, dives in*", "authors": ["Mehera"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/U8LLcfV6ImJ53DK2BPszyg--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cosmopolitan_438/d732041135b7ce585a57364960e6327f", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
