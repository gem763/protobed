In a statement, the company called the settlement \u201cthe right course of action.\u201d", "description": "Mylan NV will pay a $30 million civil fine to settle U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charges it concealed a possible loss related to a federal probe on whether it overcharged Medicaid by hundreds of millions of dollars for sales of its EpiPen Auto-Injector.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190927&t=2&i=1434571240&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8Q17E", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
