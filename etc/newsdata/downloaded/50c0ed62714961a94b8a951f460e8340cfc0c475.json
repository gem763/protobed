This is certainly that time.\u201d\n\nWilson is survived by his wife Juli, two young sons and other family members.\n\nThe church was founded in Riverside in 1973 and now has 15,000 people with campuses in Southern California and Hawaii that host large-scale evangelistic events.\n\nWilson had spoken openly about his struggle with depression and his desire to help others.\n\nOn his Instagram page, he wrote in August: \u201cAdmitting you struggle with mental health doesn\u2019t make you a bad Christian.\u201d He also wrote \u201cI\u2019m a Christian who also struggles with depression. This exists, and it\u2019s ok to admit it.\u201d\n\nThe outreach group he and his wife founded in 2016 sought to end the stigma of mental illness and connect people to resources including a 24-hour crisis line.\n\nWilson died a day before World Suicide Prevention Day, which he posted about on his Twitter feed.\n\nLaurie said Wilson\u2019s death is a reminder that spiritual leaders also struggle.\n\n\u201cSometimes people may think that as pastors or spiritual leaders we are somehow above the pain and struggles of everyday people,\u201d Laurie wrote. \u201cWe are the ones who are supposed to have all the answers. But we do not.\u201d\n\nHe urged anyone in need to seek help.\n\n\u2022 In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255. In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14.
