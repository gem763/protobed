You've had your lives ruined by petty, nonsensical 'safety' rules. Now a brilliant new book explodes the myths\n\nOften 'health and safety' is abused by private and public organisations\n\nNow ID is needed if someone buying Christmas crackers looks under 16\n\n\n\nMost reasons given for not using mobiles on airplanes are bogus\n\n\n\nSummer 2009. One of us, Tracey, is standing at the back of a long and hot security queue to get into the House of Commons. She is wearing a jacket and carrying her handbag. From within, her mobile phone rings. She goes to answer it.\n\n\u2018Get off that phone!\u2019 screams an officious security guard.\n\n\u2018Er, hang on, why?\u2019 asks Tracey who, as director of the Sense About Science charity \u2013 an organisation that promotes public understanding of science \u2013 knows more about how mobiles work than most.\n\n\u2018Because we all want to go home alive tonight!\u2019 comes the unanswerable response.\n\nFor your 'ealth an' safety: A new book looks at the way in which the seemingly unanswerable interests of 'safety and security' are being used and abused\n\nExchanges like the one above are an increasing feature of modern life. And after being confronted with petty officialdom and apparently random rule-making once too often Tracey and I decided to write a book looking at the way in which the seemingly unanswerable interests of \u2018safety and security\u2019 are being used by companies, officials and security agencies all over the world and in all walks of life from airports to schools, hospitals, swimming pools and parks.\n\nThese rules are making life more complicated, more expensive and more frustrating than it needs to be.\n\nIf you are travelling through an airport with hand luggage, you will already have dumped your bottle of shampoo and abandoned your water (only to find yourself queuing for replacements at twice the price a few metres air-side from security).\n\nYou will have kicked yourself for leaving your good nail file in your toiletry bag as this will now be at the bottom of a ten-gallon drum, along with discarded snow globes, bottles of aftershave, key rings and a variety of artifacts and souvenirs whose plane-hijacking potential could never have been anticipated by their owners.\n\nIf you visited the London Olympics, you probably had your picnic drinks confiscated on arrival. And if you have ever tried to find out to which hospital ward a relative has been taken, boarded a train from London to Paris with a penknife in your backpack, taken more than two children to a public swimming pool, or dropped in to help with reading classes at your local school, you will have discovered that, in the interests of safety and security, you can\u2019t. Most of us have encountered safety and security rules that appear to defy logic and common sense.\n\nTerrorism? Liquids kept in containers of less than 100ml can be taken on airplanes - but only if they are scanned separately in a clear bag at security\n\nCyclists cannot leave their bikes near government buildings because of fears that the frames might be turned into bombs; children have to use more complex encryption in the passwords for their school intranets than the US Government used to defend its Cold War nuclear arsenal. Is all of this making us safer?\n\nWe are not arguing for danger. The world is a much safer place than it was even a generation ago and this is thanks, in no small part, to sensible rules and evidence-based measures. It used to be legal to drive a car when paralytic with alcohol; now it is not, and that is a very good thing. We know that in many cases security forces are doing a good, quiet job keeping us safe.\n\nBut the rules have to make sense. Very often they do not.\n\nIt is probably quite hard, for instance, to blow anything up with Christmas crackers, but that is not the way some people see it.\n\nIn December 2013, Ben Meghreblian set off for his staff Christmas party. He had agreed to bring along the Christmas crackers. He grabbed a nice-looking box from his local Marks & Spencer and went to the till to pay for them.\n\nThe assistant looked at the crackers, then looked at Ben and asked him for ID. When he asked why, she pointed to a sign on the shelf: \u2018It is a criminal offence to sell a product containing explosives to anyone under 16.\u2019 Ben was 34.\n\nSAFETY MYTH BUSTED #1\n\nMYTH: Heat from radio waves and the potential for sparks mean mobiles should ON NO ACCOUNT be switched on at petrol stations. Petrol, after all, is one of the most flammable substances known to man. THE REALITY... Petrol is not as flammable as we suppose. Dropped cigarettes do not light petrol. The chances of a mobile spark doing so are virtually nil. There is no known case of a mobile igniting petrol.\n\nIt turned out there\u2019s no evidence of mobiles interfering with hospital equipment, either, whereas walkie-talkies do. Many medics now carry mobiles\n\nHe was asked to wait about while a further assistant was summoned who was then able to approve the ID and the sale. To buy six crackers.\n\nWe discovered that Ben\u2019s experience was far from an isolated incident.\n\n\n\nThe Pyrotechnic Articles (Safety) Regulations 2010 seem to have made retailers so nervous that they train their staff to be cautious to the point of absurdity.\n\nCrackers are included in the scope of the pyrotechnic regulations because they contain minuscule amounts of silver fulminate, which is a controlled explosive.\n\nParadoxically, children\u2019s toy gun caps and \u2018snappit\u2019 bangers, which also contain silver fulminate, are not covered by the regulations.\n\nThis substance has also caused crackers to fall foul of laws relating to the transportation of explosives.\n\nIn 2007 the snaps from 650 crackers destined for troops serving in Afghanistan had to be removed because of a ban on \u2018carrying explosives in RAF aircraft\u2019. The irony seemed to be lost on the regulators.\n\nMobile phones, for some reason, have acquired an almost magical aura of bogus danger.\n\n\n\nWe have been told for years that we are not supposed to use a mobile phone on an aircraft.\n\nIf you questioned it you were probably told that the radio signals they send out as they search for base stations are powerful enough to scramble an aircraft\u2019s delicate electronic controls and navigation systems.\n\nOr that they could interfere with the vital communications between the plane and air-traffic control; or that they will throw the fly-by-wire control system into turmoil. All this is almost complete nonsense.\n\nDeadly serious: In 2006, the 'gravestone hysteria' saw councils topple hundreds of thousands of headstones to protect the public\n\nIn 1999 Neil Whitehouse, was jailed for a year after \u2018recklessly and negligently\u2019 endangering the lives of everyone on board a flight from Manchester to Madrid. The court was told that he had \u2018repeatedly refused\u2019 to turn off his mobile phone when asked by cabin crew.\n\nExperts testified that the phone could interfere with the aircraft\u2019s navigation systems and after the verdict the British Civil Aviation Authority issued a statement strongly supporting the prosecution. Greater Manchester Police, in its new-found role as an authority in the science of electromagnetic interference and avionics systems, did the same.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: a large airliner will regularly carry several hundred passengers and on any given flight more than 50 of those people will have forgotten to turn off their phones.\n\nHow come no crash has ever been attributed to a mobile phone?\n\nWe spoke to Dr Martyn Thomas, a software engineer, electronics expert and chairman of the Royal Academy of Engineering\u2019s IT panel. According to Dr Thomas, the mobile phone ban came about partly as a result of conversations and anecdotes rather than research:\n\nSAFETY MYTH BUSTED #2\n\nMYTH: Terrorists hiding in aeroplane toilet cubicles can mix three benign liquids \u2013 drain cleaner, nail varnish remover and hair dye \u2013 to form triacetone tri peroxide (TATP), which can make fuselage-shattering bombs\n\nTHE REALITY...This would require a controlled temperature, specialist kit, hours to prepare, then more hours while it dries to a powder.\n\nUK scientists took four days and 30 attempts to create such an explosion \u2013 in a lab! The rule banning liquids has no relevance to commercial air travel\n\n\u2018It was just a general precaution backed up with a string of anecdotes, none of which could be substantiated in terms of actual [engineering] trials and evidence.\u2019\n\nIn fact, we discovered that in nearly all instances where mobile phone use is banned or restricted \u2013 general hospital wards, garage forecourts and so forth, there is zero evidence that the use of these devices poses a real risk and no examples where anyone has ever been harmed.\n\nOnce the big steel door of safety has swung shut, it has proved very difficult for people armed with the evidence to push it open again.\n\nWhile it is hard to challenge a rule because it looks like you are condoning terrorism or compromising air passenger safety, it is much, much harder to argue your case if it looks like you may be endangering children.\n\nYet so often, we found, new and ludicrous rules have proliferated around schools, playing areas, sports grounds and pools \u2013 all in the interests of safety and \u2018child protection\u2019 and yet which, on closer inspection, are based on nothing more than assumptions \u2013 and often a complete misreading by the \u2018authorities\u2019 of what the rules actually say.\n\nIn 2006 Ken Paine was standing on the touchline of a football pitch in Ashford, Kent. He was there to watch his son Jake play in a local under-16s match. Things turned surreal when he pulled out a camera to take a picture.\n\nHe later told reporters: \u2018The referee stopped the play, and came over to me and asked if I was a member of the press. I said, \u201cNo.\u201d \u2018He said, \u201cSo why are you taking photographs?\u201d\n\n\u2018I said, \u201cBecause my son\u2019s playing.\u201d And he said, \u201cWell, you can\u2019t do that, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d \u2018I said, \u201cWell, why not?\u201d And he said, \u201cBecause of the Child Protection Act.\u201d \u2019\n\nNo fire here: The chances of a mobile spark igniting petrol are virtually nil\n\nAs parents, we have both been faced with people who have tried to stop us doing things that used to be considered completely acceptable such as taking pictures of our children in sports matches, at football practice and in school plays.\n\nWe did some checking, which was no straightforward matter because, like many of these rules, no one seems to be responsible for them. We contacted the Department for Education, the Football Association and child-safeguarding experts at the NSPCC.\n\nWe also contacted the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office (ICO), which polices the Data Protection Act (DPA). Is it illegal to take pictures of kids playing football? No, it turns out. What about nativity plays and the like? \u2018No rules at all.\u2019\n\nIn fact, we met exasperation from these official bodies.\n\nThe Health and Safety Executive is fed up to its back teeth with cases where \u2018health and safety\u2019 is cited without foundation, to justify everything from the cutting down of fruit trees (in case they encourage wasps), to the desecration of millions of gravestones by \u2018safety consultants\u2019, to banning triangular cakes from school canteens, because said pastries slightly resemble ninja throwing weapons.\n\nSAFETY MYTH BUSTED #3\n\nMYTH: At the peak of the hysteria, councils toppled hundreds of thousands of headstones to protect the public.\n\nBereaved relatives were ordered to pay hundreds of pounds to make graves \u2018secure\u2019. In some regions, no graveyard went unscathed\n\nIN REALITY... A six-year-old boy was killed in 2000 when he climbed on top of an old headstone. But the majority of affected gravestones were modest and modern, incapable of killing anyone. The senseless policy caused misery and vast damage. The law was changed, but not one person was sacked\n\nSo what can you do when faced with a jobsworth in a uniform or down the other end of the line saying you cannot do something that you suspect is neither against the law nor will pose any realistic threat to safety?\n\nAsk for evidence. Ask them to justify it. And don\u2019t accept vague references to safety or security rules. If someone says the DPA is preventing them from being helpful, ask them to explain in what way exactly, and which part of the act is relevant.\n\nAs the ICO says: \u2018The ICO has just issued guidance urging parents to challenge anyone trying to use the DPA as a duck-out in this way.\u2019\n\nWhen something has been done \u2018in the interests of safety\u2019, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that it is in our interests.\n\n\n\nMany new safety rules, and much of the modern security business, create self-interested jobs and markets and cadres of self-sustaining bureaucracy that progress from one perceived threat to the next.\n\nSo, \u2018in the interests of safety\u2019 might well turn out to mean \u2018in the interests of a lucrative consultancy that offers advice on internet safety\u2019 or \u2018in the interests of a big business with an Olympics retail licence\u2019.\n\nThe interests of safety could even mean, we found, \u2018contrary to your interests\u2019 or \u2018endangering you because no one bothered to check the evidence\u2019, because many safety rules introduce unintended and undesirable consequences, such as discouraging people from learning to swim or to manage risks effectively.\n\nRules made in the name of safety and security that ignore the consequences lead to a lack of accountability \u2013 to the belief that social responsibility has been discharged merely by introducing the rule.\n\nThis is the opposite of more responsibility and safety, and it might well explain why we don\u2019t feel particularly safe even though we are surrounded by ever more security guards and safety officers.\n\nIt\u2019s within our power to change that. Unless we press the case, organisations won\u2019t drop pointless and counter-productive rules.\n\nBut by asking the right questions at the right times, we can stem the tide of safety and security rules and even, as some of the determined people in our book found, roll it back.\n\n\u00a9Tracey Brown and Michael Hanlon, 2014", "description": "TRACEY BROWN AND MICHAEL HANLON looks at the way in which the seemingly unanswerable interests of \u2018safety and security\u2019 are being used and abused.", "authors": ["Michael Hanlon For The Daily Mail", "Tracey Brown"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/06/14/article-2657898-1EC3BDD300000578-451_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2014-06-14"}
