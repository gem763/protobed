Hannah Gaber, USA TODAY\n\nUnfortunately, the biggest loser of the night was human civilization. Not one question about climate change.\n\nAll 12 leading Democratic candidates for president got a chance to demonstrate why they were able to meet the requirements to pack on the stage for the fourth debate Tuesday.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren stayed feisty and focused in her new role as frontrunner.\n\nFormer vice president Joe Biden was optimistic and self-congratulatory as tried to win the John McCain name-dropping contest. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard confounded everyone by spreading the blame for the slaughter of the Kurds in Northern Syria that Donald Trump invited to members of \u201cboth parties.\u201d And Andrew Yang got to say lots of things as if no one had ever thought of them before.\n\nBut the winner of the night was older than the two youngest candidates on stage \u2014 Gabbard, 38, and Mayor Pete Buttigieg, 37 \u2014 combined.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders, 78, returned to the campaign trail after recovering from a heart attack to deliver his strongest debate performance of the campaign. He was lively, funny and persuasive. At one, point he even seemed to convince billionaire Tom Steyer that billionaires shouldn\u2019t exist.\n\nSanders also took Joe Biden\u2019s constant praise of bipartisanship and the vice president\u2019s pointed boast, \u201cI\u2019m the only one up here to get anything really big done.\u201d\n\nIn Westerville, Ohio, on Oct. 15, 2019. (Photo: Win McNamee/Getty Images)\n\n\u201cJoe, you talked about working with Republicans and getting things done,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cBut you know what you also got done \u2014 and I say this as a good friend \u2014 you got the disastrous war in Iraq done. You got a bankruptcy bill, which is hurting middle class families all over this country. You got trade agreements like NAFTA and PNTR (permanent normal trade relations) with China done, which have cost us 4 million jobs. Let's get to Medicare for all. If we stood together, we could create the greatest health care system in the world.\u201d\n\nA conservative's take: Winners and losers in the Democratic debate from columnist Glenn Harlan Reynolds\n\nBut Bernie\u2019s biggest moment of the night didn\u2019t happen on stage. In the closing minutes of the debate, news broke that one of the brightest young stars on America\u2019s left, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, will endorse the 2016 Democratic primary runner-up this weekend.\n\nThis gives the democratic socialist from Vermont the chance to break the momentum of Warren\u2019s steady rise in the polls, though he notably hasn\u2019t take a shot at the senator from Massachusetts on the debate stage yet. Instead, he sided with her several times as she was cornered, echoing her arguments for systemic change.\n\nThe format of the debate followed much better than the previous three. It\u2019s unclear is if this was because the moderators allowed the candidates more air to answer and rebut each other or because self-help guru Marianne Williamson wasn\u2019t on the stage. Whatever it is, they should do more of it.\n\nWhile there are still miles to go before anyone actually votes for a nominee, the race for the chance to oppose Trump will likely remain a tossup between Sanders, Warren and Biden. This is mostly because the rest of the candidates have done a better job of cancelling each other out than breaking through.\n\nWhile the debates have led to some blips in the polls \u2014 most notably for Kamala Harris after the second debate \u2014 the crowded stage format has the effect of blurring candidates together, especially since every debate seems to rehash the same Medicare for All contentions over and over until even Bernie Sanders seems a little bored by the fray.\n\nAnother huge winner of the night was impeachment, which is now polling over 50%.\n\nEvery candidate on stage backs the inquiry in the House and no candidate showed any willingness to echo the attacks on Hunter Biden that Trump pressured Ukraine\u2019s president Volodymyr Zelensky into trumping up.\n\nUnfortunately, the biggest loser of the night was human civilization.\n\nWhile there was a question about Ellen DeGeneres\u2019 defense of her kindness to former president and torture purveyor George W. Bush, there wasn\u2019t one question about climate change. Future generations will have to be satisfied knowing that we were much too busy worrying about rich people getting along in luxury boxes to stop the planet from boiling.\n\nJason Sattler, a writer based in Ann Arbor, Michigan, is a member of USA TODAY\u2019s Board of Contributors and host of \"The GOTMFV Show\" podcast.
