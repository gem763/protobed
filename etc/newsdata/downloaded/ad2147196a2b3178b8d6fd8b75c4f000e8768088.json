(The Logic)\n\nTalking point: In August, IAC said it would spin off Match and Angi Homeservices, which owns HomeAdvisor and Angie\u2019s List. The latter is on hold until the Match sale goes through. Match has a US$21-billion market cap, so a sale would bring in significant cash for the American holding company. It could use that influx to revive Angi, whose shares are down 56 per cent this year, and boost recent acquisitions Turo, a car-sharing firm, and Fixd Repair, a home-warranty firm. There are, however, a number of potential complications for the sale. One of Tinder\u2019s co-founders is suing IAC for allegedly undervaluing Tinder\u2019s growth potential.", "description": "", "authors": ["Zane Schwartz"], "top_image": "https://thelogic.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/WP_Logo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
