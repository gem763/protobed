Key economic metrics are flashing red for the US and the European Union as tensions between the two reach new highs. The latest readings from prominent purchasing managers' indexes show manufacturing sectors the US and EU struggling amid global trade conflict and slowing economies.

The index fell to 52.6 last month from 55.3 in August, reaching its lowest reading in three years. Any reading above 50 signals expansion, while those below 50 hint at sector contraction. Several of the purchasing managers surveyed blamed tariffs from the US-China trade war for impacting supply chain efficiencies. The increased expenses pressure managers to find other ways to keep margins strong, including passing the extra costs to consumers. \"We are actively pursuing alternate sources for our China-based production. At this point, we have not passed on tariff costs to our customers, but we are evaluating all options,\" one respondent said. IHS Markit's eurozone-based services index reflected a similar decline in a Thursday release. The metric hit 51.6 in September, down from 53.5 in the prior month and showing the weakest increase in activity since the start of the year. The continent has suffered significantly from economic contraction in Germany and Italy. Though the pullback began in Germany's manufacturing sector, the September figures point to the downturn affecting multiple nations and spilling over into service industries as well. \"Yesterday's WTO ruling against the EU on Airbus lets Trump play 'trade war' with a new part of the world,\" Stenn Group president Kerstin Braun said.\n\nManufacturing Adam Glanzman/Getty Images Manufacturing sentiments are plummeting between the US and EU as well, with surveyed purchasing managers signaling new lows for economic optimism. The Institute for Supply Management announced Tuesday its manufacturing index dropped to 47.8 last month, the metric's lowest level since June 2009. President Trump's trade war with China has added pressure to US firms, as tariffs on thousands of products have raised expenses and affected several companies' bottom lines in recent quarters. Factories aren't faring much better in Europe. IHS Markit's Eurozone manufacturing index fell to 45.7 in September, down from 47 the month prior and remaining below the key median. The tumble was primarily caused by the sharpest decline in new orders since 2012, and forecasts for the rest of the year aren't promising. Businesses' sentiments will likely \"remain downbeat about the year ahead,\" IHS Markit chief business economist Chris Williamson said, attributing the bleak outlook to \"trade war worries, signs of slowing global economic growth and geopolitical concerns.\"", "description": "The latest purchasing managers' surveys from IHS Markit    and the Institute for Supply Management detail slowing growth    for manufacturing and services a...", "authors": ["Finanzen.Net Gmbh"], "top_image": "https://markets.businessinsider.com/apple-touch-icon.png", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
