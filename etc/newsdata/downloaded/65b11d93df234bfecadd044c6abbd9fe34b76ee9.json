She makes it all happen (Picture: Dirty Dancing)\n\nWhy do I love the film Dirty Dancing? Would it be too much to say it\u2019s like the wind through my tree?\n\nYes, maybe, but it wouldn\u2019t be far off. It has everything \u2013 daughters and fathers, sisters, neglected wives, fear of how a pregnancy will affect your career, low-life scum and rich w*nk*rs, and how to handle them all.\n\nIt\u2019s like an instruction manual for girls \u2013 well, middle-class girls anyway. Girls like me who sometimes have a bit of a urge to get out there and do something a bit crazy.\n\nNice girls who suddenly want to carry a watermelon and get dirty with the \u2018wrong\u2019 sort of man.\n\nIt\u2019s why I\u2019ve written a book about my love for it; it\u2019s part memoir and another part homage to the greatest film of all time. The film is a feminist manifesto and it\u2019s certainly played a role in the way I live my life \u2013 something that the book explores.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m so happy that Dirty Dancing is now widely getting the more serious recognition it deserves \u2013 with it being among the 10 most watched films on Netflix last month and with screenings lined up for the anniversary of its release next week. It was dismissed for years as an enjoyable but largely insignificant piece of entertaining fluff \u2013 a commercial hit, yes, but nothing more.\n\nWhen in fact it is an important rite-of-passage story for girls.\n\nThe female lead, Baby, is about as active in the story as it is possible to be. She makes it all happen.\n\nEvery last moment is down to her, from the funding of an illegal abortion to the offer to fill in and learn the dance. To the extraordinary first seduction, and then the exoneration of Johnny as a thief.\n\nShe drives the entire plot.\n\nIn its way, it is a feminist manifesto \u2013 a story with a heroine who has to defy her family, stand up for her principles, save the man she loves, and is finally lifted up in a floaty pink dress.\n\nYes, you can still be a powerful woman in a floaty pink dress, after all. And you should never put up with being put in a corner, no matter how you\u2019re dressed.\n\nI\u2019m glad it came into my life all those years ago and I promise not to neglect it again.\n\nThe thing about Dirty Dancing is that it has some magic ingredient that makes you feel invincible. You enter Baby\u2019s world, and you come out feeling better and stronger.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat more could you want from a heroine? What more could you want from anything?\n\nThe lessons are still there for any girl who wishes to heed them (Picture: Vestron/Kobal/REX/Shutterstock (5884882z))\n\nI was worried when I started looking at the film in detail, it would not stand up to scrutiny, or that it would disappear through my fingers into nothing.\n\nInstead, there was more packed in there than I had even imagined. It works as entertainment, yes, of course but the political messages are as fresh and pertinent now as ever.\n\nThe lessons are still there for any girl who wishes to heed them too. I\u2019d make it required viewing for teenage boys and girls \u2013 it should be taught in schools.\n\nThe syllabus would be things like: How to stand up for yourself. How to help others without judgement as well as how not to be a passenger in your own life.\n\nThat\u2019s not to mention other key things we can take from it like: What consensual sex looks like, you should take risks and live in the moment and a \u2018yes\u2019 is almost always better than a \u2018no\u2019 when an opportunity to learn something new is presented.\n\nAnd finally, don\u2019t let anyone put you in a corner. You are the hero of your own story.\n\nAll of the above, I learned from Dirty Dancing.\n\nThese lessons are present in other films, books, TV shows and plays of course but not usually in one place.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s an addictive story, with a satisfying and yet open end. We get to write the next bit, with our own lives.\n\nI\u2019ve been following its mantras since the day it was released. I\u2019ll watch Dirty Dancing again on my eightieth birthday and report back if anything has changed.\n\nUntil then, let\u2019s have the time of our lives, whatever we do.\n\nWe are the heroes. We drive the story. We make it happen.\n\nI Carried A Watermelon by HQ, HarperCollins is published on the 10th October in hardback, ebook and audiobook.\n\nMORE: Britain\u2019s Got Talent\u2019s Paddy, 85, and Nicko take on iconic Dirty Dancing routine in Champions final\n\nMORE: Jennifer Aniston\u2019s ex Justin Theroux forced her to watch her first film Leprechaun during date night\n\nMORE: Katheryn Winnick wraps up new film with \u2018wonderful\u2019 Liam Neeson ahead of Vikings final", "description": "Yes, you can still be a powerful woman in a floaty pink dress.", "authors": ["Katy Brand"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-144187584_1570802988.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
