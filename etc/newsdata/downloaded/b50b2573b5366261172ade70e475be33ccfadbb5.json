Wilson, a key player in the messy run-up to the 2003 Iraq invasion and whose ex-wife, Valerie Plame, went from secretive CIA officer to household name, died Friday at his home in New Mexico.\n\nMr. Wilson, who was 69, died of organ failure, according to a Washington Post report that quoted Ms. Plame. The couple divorced in 2017.\n\nA former diplomat, Mr. Wilson was thrust into the headlines after the CIA dispatched him to Africa to investigate whether Saddam Hussein had purchased enriched \u201cyellowcake\u201d uranium from Niger.\n\nHe couldn\u2019t produce evidence of the purchase during a fact-finding mission in 2002, undercutting President George W. Bush\u2019s claim in his 2003 State of the Union address \u2014 citing British intelligence \u2014 that Iraq was able to develop weapons of mass destruction. The claim served as a pretext for the Iraq invasion that March.\n\nMr. Wilson called out the Bush administration for relying on secondhand intelligence, leading to a confrontation with the White House that spilled into the public eye.\n\nColumnist Robert M. Novak wrote that while Mr. Wilson wasn\u2019t a CIA officer, his \u201cwife, Valerie Plame, is an agency operative on weapons of mass destruction.\u201d\n\nSuddenly outed, Ms. Plame was forced to leave the CIA.\n\nShe and Mr. Wilson sued Vice President Richard B. Cheney, his former chief of staff, I. Lewis \u201cScooter\u201d Libby, and adviser Karl Rove on the belief they leaked Ms. Plame\u2019s name to Mr. Novak.\n\nThough the suit didn\u2019t go anywhere, Mr. Libby was convicted of perjury, prompting a commutation of his prison term by Mr. Bush and a pardon from President Trump.\n\nMs. Plame is running for Congress in New Mexico, hoping to replace Democratic Rep. Ben Ray Lujan as he seeks a Senate seat.\n\nMr. Lujan expressed \u201cprofound sadness\u201d at the news of Mr. Wilson\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cAmbassador Wilson was a devoted patriot who put country and duty before politics and who had the courage to speak the truth in the face of extreme criticism,\u201d he said. \u201cWith his passing, our country lost a faithful public servant.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
