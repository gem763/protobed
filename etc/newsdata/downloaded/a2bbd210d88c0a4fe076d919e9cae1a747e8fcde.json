The company said the app, HKmap.live, was used to target the police.\n\nCook had defended the removal in the face of criticism for appeasing mainland China, telling Apple workers that \"this decision best protects our users\".\n\nChina's State Administration for Market Regulation said in a statement on its website that its chief, Xiao Yaqing, and Cook discussed topics including Apple expanding investment in China, consumer rights protection and fulfilling corporate social responsibility. It did not give more details.\n\nApple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nChina is a key market for Apple. Apple's smartphone market share fell to 5.8% in the June quarter from 6.4% in the same period a year ago, according to research firm Canalys, as China's homegrown Huawei Technologies Co Ltd became the dominant smartphone seller.\n\nThe meeting also comes days before China holds the World Internet Conference in Wuzhen in China's eastern Zhejiang province. The event in the past has attracted overseas company executives, foreign diplomats and Chinese government officials.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if Cook will be a participant at the conference this year. He last attended the event in 2017.
