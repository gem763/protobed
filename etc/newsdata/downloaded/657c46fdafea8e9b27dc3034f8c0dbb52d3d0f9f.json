the legal process for the UK's departure.\n\nWhile stopping short of calling for that himself, Mr Watson will say it is not too late for Labour to \"win back\" Remain voters from the Lib Dems if it campaigns \"unequivocally\" to remain.\n\n\"My experience on the doorstep tells me most of those who've deserted us over our Brexit policy did so with deep regret and would greatly prefer to come back,\" he will add.\n\n\"They just want us to take an unequivocal position that whatever happens we'll fight to remain, and to sound like we mean it.\"\n\nMr Watson will say that, though \"very difficult\", he and many others \"respected the result of the 2016 referendum for a long time\".\n\nBut, he will add: \"There eventually comes a point when circumstances are so changed, when so much new information has emerged that we didn't have in 2016, when so many people feel differently to how they felt then, that you have to say, no... the only proper way to proceed in such circumstances is to consult the people again.\"\n\n'No appetite'\n\nLabour MP Mr Smith told BBC Radio 4's Today programme there was \"no such thing as a good Brexit deal\", and to pursue one was \"at odds with Labour values\".\n\nBut his fellow Labour MP, Gareth Snell - one of a group of MPs in the party wanting to bring back an amended version of the original withdrawal agreement - said the \"numbers simply don't exist\" in Parliament to approve a further referendum.\n\nHe told Today: \"The public have no appetite for a second referendum. The doors I knock every week\u2026 [voters] are not telling me they want to go back to the divisive referendum [but] they want a decision on this process to be taken as soon as possible.\"\n\nSpeaking to the Trades Union Congress on Tuesday, Sir Keir Starmer will say that another referendum is the only way of \"cleaning up the mess left by the Tories\".\n\n\"And - of course - 'remain' should and will be on the ballot paper along with a credible option to leave.\"", "description": "Tom Watson says another referendum, with Labour backing Remain, can resolve the deadlock.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/0A4A/production/_108743620_mediaitem108743619.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
