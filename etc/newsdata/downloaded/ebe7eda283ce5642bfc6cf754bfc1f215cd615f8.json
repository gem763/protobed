Tomorrow he is in the group.\n\n(Image: NurPhoto/PA Images)\n\n\u201cWe need his quality, his skill. We need his consistency. We need his positive mentality. Then we need him to help us on the pitch.\n\n\u201cI want now like in the pre-season, like a month ago, for him to help us on the pitch.\u201d\n\nA string of first-team stars including Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, David Luiz, Calum Chambers and Granit Xhaka will not travel to Anfield.\n\nAs a result, Ozil is likely to be the most senior player on show for Arsenal.\n\n(Image: CameraSport via Getty Images)\n\nWhen asked whether Ozil could captain the team, Emery replied: \u201cIt depends. He could be yes.\u201d\n\nThe pressure is building on Emery after a mixed start to the season took a turn for the worse on Sunday.\n\nCrystal Palace fought back from two goals behind to earn a point at the Emirates Stadium but the game was overshadowed by Xhaka telling the home fans \u2018f*** off\u2019 when he was replaced on the hour mark.\n\n(Image: David Price)\n\nWhen asked about Xhaka, Emery said: \u201cIt\u2019s not easy for him and for the team. He is now devastated, sad. We spoke yesterday and Sunday night and this morning.\n\n\u201cHe trained normally with the group but he is devastated. He is sad about that situation.\n\n\u201cHis commitment is great every time. He wants to help. His behaviour was perfect in training, with the group and club. Really he knows he was wrong.\n\n\u201cHe feels inside, very deep. It\u2019s normal as a human. Every player needs the supporters\u2019 support.\u201d", "description": "Mesut Ozil has been frozen out by Unai Emery but has been named in Arsenal's squad for the Carabao Cup clash at Anfield", "authors": ["Alex Harris", "Image", "Nurphoto Pa Images", "Camerasport Via Getty Images", "David Price"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20733038.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Arsenal-v-Nottingham-Forest-Carabao-Cup-Third-Round.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
