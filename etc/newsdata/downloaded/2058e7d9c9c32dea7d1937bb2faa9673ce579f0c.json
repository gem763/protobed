The number of contracts in the first hour stood at just 5 total. At press time (10 or so hours later), 28 contracts had been traded, with just one at a sub-$10,000 price.\n\nAnd that\u2019s just for the monthly bitcoin contract. For the daily bitcoin contract \u2013 arguably Bakkt\u2019s flagship product \u2013 the volume looks even more tepid.\n\nThe first such contract appears to have been traded some 18 hours after Bakkt went live, at a price of $9,975.00, according to the data feed on ICE\u2019s website.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m shocked there isn\u2019t any volume,\u201d said Lanre Sarumi, CEO of LevelTradingField. \u201cI absolutely thought that contract was going to fly out of the gate. Very odd.\u201d\n\nBy that time, trading in the monthly contract totaled 66 bitcoin.\n\nThe daily settling futures contract has been part of Bakkt\u2019s vision from the get-go; the monthly one was added only later after ICE met delays getting regulatory approval for the platform.\n\nBakkt didn\u2019t respond to several requests for comment Monday.\n\nSome online commentators believe the slow start is a natural progression for regulated futures products.\n\nSu Zhu, CEO and CIO of Singapore-based hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, said that most regulated futures contracts see low adoption on the first day, simply because not all futures brokers are ready to clear them.\n\nPopular analyst Joseph Young also echoed the sentiment via a tweet arguing that volumes will rise as a brokers \u201cget ready.\u201d\n\nIt will be interesting to see if trading volumes pick up during the week ahead, according to market analyst Alex Kruger.\n\nBitcoin futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) registered a volume of $460 million in its first week in December 2017. So far, Bakkt futures have registered a volume of just over $280,000.\n\nBitcoin drops on Bakkt launch\n\nThe bitcoin market has seen no discernible boost from the launch. The spot price of bitcoin (BTC) dropped below $10,000 at 00:17 UTC near today\u2019s open trading period.\n\nMany observers believe Bakkt\u2019s physically-settled futures are a game-changer and could bring in more institutional volume. Cryptocurrency analyst and trader Scott Melker in August called Bakkt futures the most bullish development in the history of bitcoin. This is due to the fact that physically delivered futures require the actual purchase of bitcoins.\n\nThat said, exactly how impactful the launch will be to the markets and crypto in general remains speculative. Moreover, a rise in trading volumes does not always lead to bullish price action \u2013 after all, futures can be utilized to create short positions.\n\nHence, viewing a Bakkt-driven rise in volumes as a price-bullish development could prove costly for traders.\n\nFurther, BTC suffered losses following the launch of CME and CBOE futures in December 2017, as seen in the chart below.\n\nDaily chart\n\nAs can be seen, the market started its almost 90 percent from BTC\u2019s all-time spot price high of $20,000 after the launch of bitcoin futures in late 2017.\n\nFurther, the market likely priced in the Bakkt launch in August. Back then, the futures launch announcement from the Bakkt Trust Company, a subsidiary of Bakkt Holdings \u2013 which is licensed by the State of New York to provide custody of bitcoin \u2013 stoked investor sentiment on August 17 and prices rose to $10,940.\n\nThe markets soon sobered up and a swift rejection followed, bringing a roughly 14.53 percent drawdown to $9,300 by August 29.\n\nUPDATE (19:20 UTC): This article was updated with additional details about trading volume for Bakkt\u2019s monthly and daily bitcoin contracts.\n\nDisclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency at the time of writing.\n\nNikhilesh De and Marc Hochstein contributed reporting.\n\nBakkt CEO Kelly Loeffler (center) image via CoinDesk archives; chart via Trading View", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.coindesk.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Bakkt-e1552518775413.jpg"}
