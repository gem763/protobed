These 29 popular apps have a collective 10 million downloads.\n\n24 of these apps belonged to the HiddAd category. To the uninitiated, HiddAd apps are known to notoriously hide their icon after the first launch from the app drawer and create a shortcut on Home Screen.\n\nThe intention behind this is because is to not let users uninstall the app. When users actually launch the app through the shortcut on the home screen, these apps start flashing full-screen ads on the screen.\n\nDon't Miss 533 SHARES 514 SHARES 311 SHARES\n\nQuick Heal\n\nRemaining 5 apps are classic adware and get installed through the route of advertisements when a user visits social media sites like YouTube, Facebook, etc. Google has removed these 29 apps and if your phone has any of them it is highly recommended that you delete them.\n\nThis isn't the first time Google has gone ahead and removed harmful apps on the Play Store. In August, researchers from Georgia Institute of Technology and the Ohio State University had found over 1600 vulnerabilities in the support ecosystem in over 5000 free apps available on Google's Play Store.\n\nThese vulnerabilities were spotted in the backend systems that provide content and advertising to smartphone apps with the help of cloud-based servers. They also allowed hackers to breach into databases where personal information exists. This can include memory on a user's device. The study for this was presented at the 2019 USENIX Security Symposium in the US on August 15, 2019.", "description": "Google's Play Store has a poor track record of hosting malicious and harmful apps on its app store.
