If you look at the record of these guys, they are accustomed to winning. They want to win. In free agency, we brought in Landon Collins. A great leader. A great player. Wants to win. We haven\u2019t put it together. We\u2019ve made too many mistakes on game day, but the effort of the players and the rest of this organization is fantastic.\u201d\n\nSince Allen was hired in 2010, the Redskins are just 59-89-1 \u2014 with only two playoff appearances in that span.\n\nWashington has also had multiple off-the-field controversies that have led to turmoil and dysfunction surrounding the team.\n\nAsked why is it is so hard to set a proper culture that leads to winning football games, Allen said he didn\u2019t \u201cnecessarily agree with the premise.\u201d\n\n\u201cLast year at this time, we\u2019re in first place and we\u2019re doing well,\u201d Allen said. \u201cSo it was working pretty damn good. Unfortunately, our quarterback (Alex Smith) got injured. The pieces are here for a winning team. We have to put them in the right place, believe in each other and keep fighting for a goal.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s only one way you win \u2014 you have to work. You have to get better and you have to beat your opponent. And that\u2019s what we have to do. I believe these players and these coaches will do that.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
