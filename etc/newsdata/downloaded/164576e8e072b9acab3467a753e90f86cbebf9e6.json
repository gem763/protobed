Whichever it was, the chicken nugget \u2014 that crust-enveloped chunk of bird that\u2019s become a staple of dinners served on high chairs and in fast-food clamshells across the land \u2014 definitely came after that. And now, like a rapper shortening his name, there\u2019s just the nugget, the plant-based version of the familiar, dunkable finger food.\n\nVegetarian nuggets have been around for years, of course, but there\u2019s a potential disrupter in the game: Tyson Foods, the world\u2019s second-largest poultry processor, recently introduced a new chicken-less line called Raised & Rooted. The nuggets are made with pea protein, the coolest kid at the veggie party these days, and the company claims they\u2019ve got both a \u201ccravingly crispy batter\u201d and a great taste.\n\nThe decision to dub such veggie-based products simply \u201cnuggets\u201d is an interesting one. \u201cNugget\u201d is practically synonymous with chicken \u2014 and McDonald\u2019s is the reason.\n\n\n\nMeatless nuggets, left; Tyson\u2019s chicken nuggets, right.\n\nAllow me to drag you down an etymological rabbit hole for a moment, will you?\n\nThe term \u201cchicken nugget\u201d seems to have been in occasional use before the fast-food giant debuted its McNuggets in 1983, but it was hardly a household one. The phrase pops up here and there in the annals of chicken history: A 1967 promotion by the National Broiler Council (now the National Chicken Council) introduced a recipe for nuggets that called for boning breasts and cutting them into pieces to \u201croll in seasoned crumbs.\u201d And a Mrs. Thomas Young of Searcy, Ark., won the 1971 National Chicken Cooking Contest with a concoction called \u201cDipper\u2019s Nuggets.\u201d\n\n[Impossible vs. Beyond: We tested cook-at-home versions to see who makes a better vegan burger]\n\nBut the nugget turned juggernaut only after McDonald\u2019s named its battered poultry product the McNugget. (The inventor of the snack that came to be known as the nugget, a Cornell professor named Robert Baker, actually called it a \u201cChicken Crispie\u201d or a \u201cchicken stick.\u201d)\n\nBy 1986, America was full-throttle nuts for nugs. A Washington Post story about the craze was headlined \u201cNugget Mania\u201d and described the chicken chunks as \u201cthe hot dog of the \u201980s.\u201d\n\nAnd they\u2019re still popular, with countless variations (dinosaur-shaped! air-fried! maple-waffle seasoned!) to be found in grocery freezer cases. Not that they are universally loved \u2014 along the way, they\u2019ve taken more hits to their reputation than Lindsay Lohan. They\u2019re often made a symbol of the obesity epidemic and America\u2019s dysfunctional relationship with food. And urban legends about what\u2019s actually inside that crust has prompted the National Chicken Council to post a defense of the product. (Anytime you have to remind people that \u201cthere is no pink slime\u201d in your product, you know there\u2019s a PR problem.)\n\nWhich brings us to the nugget\u2019s latest chapter: the plant-based option. Now that Big Chicken is going meatless, we set out to try the new guy on the plant-based block. We tasted the new nuggets along with a few other veggie options for comparison \u2014 and for the poultri-vores among us, there also were Tyson\u2019s classic, real chicken nuggets to remind us of the Platonic ideal.\n\nSo are Tyson\u2019s newest nuggets up to scratch? In short, cluck no. Here\u2019s what our panel had to say:\n\n\n\nTyson\u2019s Raised & Rooted nuggets.\n\nRaised & Rooted Nuggets\n\nAlas, the hyped newbie was most of our testers\u2019 least favorite \u2014 even at first sight. \u201cHe\u2019s so pale,\u201d lamented one.\n\nSeveral pointed out a strange chemical flavor that had us canceling this wannabe bird. \u201cFake smoke? No, just no,\u201d opined another. \u201cIs something burning?\u201d someone asked. And its consistency, which included a couple of nuggets with chunks inside them that popped out from the rest of the filling (\u201ca nugget inside a nugget \u2014 whoa and ew\u201d), was just as unpopular. \u201cThe \u2018chicken\u2019 looks like some kind of brain foam.\u201d\n\nBut not everyone was a hater; the nugget did get one first-place rating from a taster who praised its \u201cpeppery breading\u201d and \u201cnice and crispy\u201d character. Just be careful not the sleep on this one \u2014 even its fan didn\u2019t enjoy the Raised & Rooted version when its temperature dropped: \u201cIt\u2019s gnarly when it cools.\u201d\n\n\n\nMorningstar nuggets.\n\nMorningstar Farms Chik\u2019n Nuggets\n\nFrom the company that\u2019s been making faux, soy-based meats for 40-plus years, this nugget didn\u2019t elicit strong opinions from many of our tasters, who collectively gave this an \u201ceh, pretty good.\u201d Most found this to be a little softer than the real thing, but it was generally tepidly liked.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d one taster summed up. \u201cWould eat again,\u201d said another.\n\n\n\nQuorn nuggets.\n\nQuorn Meatless Nugget\n\nThis was the breakout star of our tasting, the Beyonc\u00e9 to Tyson\u2019s Kelly Rowland. Which seemed unlikely, since the first ingredient in this product is something called \u201cmycoprotein,\u201d which is a more palatable moniker for \u201cfungal protein.\u201d\n\nThis nugget did turn out to be the fungi at the party, though, with tasters liking its pepper-flecked crust (\u201calmost homemade\u201d) and its \u201cmeat-like attack\u201d on the palate. Some faulted the texture as \u201cgummy,\u201d but that\u2019s actually pretty much the way a real chicken nugget goes down, as we were reminded by the original version we tasted (shown below). \u201cHonestly, the interior texture is better than real chicken,\u201d said one.\n\nAlice Crites and Magda Jean-Louis contributed to this report.\n\n\n\nTyson\u2019s chicken nuggets.\n\nMore from Voraciously:\n\nMcDonald\u2019s gets into the veggie burger game, testing a Beyond Meat patty in Canada\n\nThe key to White Claw\u2019s surging popularity: Marketing to a post-gender world\n\nWe did it, America.
