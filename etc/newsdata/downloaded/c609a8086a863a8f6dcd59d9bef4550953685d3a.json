This document \u2014 it wasn\u2019t part of the official conciliar proceedings \u2014 became synonymous in Latin America with \u201cliberation theology,\u201d the theological school condemned by the Vatican in 1984 as Marxist. In a statement that year on liberation theology, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, head of the Vatican\u2019s doctrinal authority, wrote in the Church\u2019s name (and published with Pope JP2\u2019s approval):\n\nThe present Instruction has a much more limited and precise purpose: to draw the attention of pastors, theologians, and all the faithful to the deviations, and risks of deviation, damaging to the faith and to Christian living, that are brought about by certain forms of liberation theology which use, in an insufficiently critical manner, concepts borrowed from various currents of Marxist thought. This warning should in no way be interpreted as a disavowal of all those who want to respond generously and with an authentic evangelical spirit to the \u201cpreferential option for the poor.\u201d It should not at all serve as an excuse for those who maintain the attitude of neutrality and indifference in the face of the tragic and pressing problems of human misery and injustice. It is, on the contrary, dictated by the certitude that the serious ideological deviations which it points out tends inevitably to betray the cause of the poor. More than ever, it is important that numerous Christians, whose faith is clear and who are committed to live the Christian life in its fullness, become involved in the struggle for justice, freedom, and human dignity because of their love for their disinherited, oppressed, and persecuted brothers and sisters. More than ever, the Church intends to condemn abuses, injustices, and attacks against freedom, wherever they occur and whoever commits them. She intends to struggle, by her own means, for the defense and advancement of the rights of mankind, especially of the poor.\n\nMore:\n\n5. The new \u2018hermeneutic\u2019 inherent in the \u201ctheologies of liberation\u201d leads to an essentially \u2018political\u2019 re-reading of the Scriptures. Thus, a major importance is given to the Exodus event inasmuch as it is a liberation from political servitude. Likewise, a political reading of the \u201cMagnificat\u201d is proposed. The mistake here is not in bringing attention to a political dimension of the readings of Scripture, but in making of this one dimension the principal or exclusive component. This leads to a reductionist reading of the Bible. 6. Likewise, one places oneself within the perspective of a temporal messianism, which is one of the most radical of the expressions of secularization of the Kingdom of God and of its absorption into the immanence of human history. 7. In giving such priority to the political dimension, one is led to deny the \u2018radical newness\u2019 of the New Testament and above all to misunderstand the person of Our Lord Jesus Christ, true God and true man, and thus the specific character of the salvation he gave us, that is above all liberation from sin, which is the source of all evils. 8. Moreover in setting aside the authoritative interpretation of the Church, denounced as classist, one is at the same time departing from tradition. In that way, one is robbed of an essential theological criterion of interpretation, and in the vacuum thus created, one welcomes the most radical theses of rationalist exegesis. Without a critical eye, one returns to the opposition of the \u201cJesus of history\u201d versus the \u201cJesus of faith.\u201d 9. Of course the creeds of the faith are literally preserved, especially the Chalcedonian creed, but a new meaning is given to them which is a negation of the faith of the Church. On one hand, the Christological doctrine of Tradition is rejected in the name of class; on the other hand, one claims to meet again the \u201cJesus of history\u201d coming from the revolutionary experience of the struggle of the poor for their liberation. 10. One claims to be reliving an experience similar to that of Jesus. The experience of the poor struggling for their liberation, which was Jesus\u2019 experience, would thus reveal, and it alone, the knowledge of the true God and the Kingdom. 11. Faith in the Incarnate Word, dead and risen for all men, and whom \u201cGod made Lord and Christ\u201d [25] is denied. In its place is substituted a figure of Jesus who is a kind of symbol who sums up in Himself the requirements of the struggle of the oppressed. 12. An exclusively political interpretation is thus given to the death of Christ. In this way, its value for salvation and the whole economy of redemption is denied. 13. This new interpretation thus touches the whole of the Christian mystery. 14. In a general way, this brings about what can be an inversion of symbols. Thus, instead of seeing, with St. Paul, a figure of baptism in the Exodus, [26] some end up making of it a symbol of the political liberation of the people. 15. When the same hermeneutical criterion is applied to the life and to the hierarchical constitution of the Church, the relationship between the hierarchy and the \u201cbase\u201d becomes the relationship of obedient domination to the law of the struggle of the classes. Sacramentality, which is at the root of the ecclesial ministries and which makes of the Church a spiritual reality which cannot be reduced to a purely sociological analysis, is quite simply ignored. 16. This inversion of symbols is likewise verified in the area of the \u2018sacraments\u2019. The Eucharist is no longer to be understood as the real sacramental presence of the reconciling sacrifice, and as the gift of the Body and Blood of Christ. It becomes a celebration of the people in their struggle. As a consequence, the unity of the Church is radically denied. Unity, reconciliation, and communion in love are no longer seen as a gift we receive from Christ. [27] It is the historical class of the poor who by means of their struggle will build unity. For them, the struggle of the classes is the way to unity. The Eucharist thus becomes the Eucharist of the class. At the same time, they deny the triumphant force of the love of God which has been given to us.\n\nIt is important for younger readers to know that in the early 1980s, liberation theology adherents \u2014 including many Latin American priests and religious \u2014 were allied with Marxist guerrillas and fellow travelers. It was a big problem, and Pope JP2 addressed it authoritatively.\n\nThat was then. Now Catholicism has a Latin American pope who has been described \u2014 by Cardinal Kasper and others \u2014 as embodying the Pact of the Catacombs. In this report from Crux, we learn of the details of the renewed Pact of the Catacombs. Excerpt:\n\nThe new pact contains 14 points, the first of which is a call to defend the Amazon rainforest in the face of global warming and depletion of natural resources. The first three, in fact, concern care for God\u2019s creation and a reminder that man is not the owner of \u201cMother Earth, but rather the sons and daughters,\u201d called to be caregivers. The original 42 bishops who signed the 1965 pact pledged to \u201ctry to live according to the ordinary manner of our people in all that concerns housing, food, [and] means of transport\u2026. We renounce forever the appearance and the substance of wealth, especially in clothing \u2026 and symbols made of precious metals.\u201d In the Amazon version, it\u2019s not until the fourth point that signatories affirm their \u201cpreferential option for the poor,\u201d underlining native peoples in particular, making them protagonists in society and in the Church, helping them \u201cpreserve their lands, cultures, languages, stories, identities and spiritualities.\u201d The following point calls on the Church to abandon \u201call types of colonist mentality and posture,\u201d welcoming the cultural, ethnic and linguistic diversity in dialogue \u201cwith all spiritual traditions.\u201d\n\nIn the new document \u2014 a full copy of which I have only seen on Twitter; I\u2019ll post a link when I find one \u2014 it appears that whereas the 1965 predecessor held up \u201cthe poor\u201d as its \u201cpreferential\u201d group, this one holds up the indigenous peoples of the Amazon. Point 5 reads:\n\nTo abandon completely, in our dioceses, parishes and groups all types of colonialist mentality and posture, welcoming and valuing cultural, linguistic, and ethnic diversity in a respectful dialogue with all spiritual traditions.\n\nHmm. Does giving up \u201ccolonialist mentality and posture\u201d mean surrendering to syncretism? Based on what has been happening at the Amazon Synod so far \u2014 see here \u2014 it would appear so.\n\nLatin America is home to about 40 percent of the world\u2019s Catholics, but the Catholic Church is hemorrhaging members there, losing many of them to Evangelical or Pentecostal churches. Pew goes deep on the demographics and rationales in this 2014 survey of Latin America. Among the findings:\n\nSyncretism remains a problem for all the Christian churches in Latin America. According to Pew:\n\nMany Latin Americans \u2013 including substantial percentages of both Catholics and Protestants \u2013 say they subscribe to beliefs and practices often associated with Afro-Caribbean, Afro-Brazilian or indigenous religions. For example, at least a third of adults in every country surveyed believe in the \u201cevil eye,\u201d the idea that certain people can cast curses or spells that cause harm. Beliefs in witchcraft and reincarnation also are widespread, held by 20% or more of the population in most countries. Other beliefs and practices vary widely from country to country. For instance, a majority of Mexicans (60%) and more than a third of Bolivians (39%) say they make offerings of food, drinks, candles or flowers to spirits, but just one-in-ten Uruguayans (9%) do so. Overall, the survey finds the highest levels of indigenous or Afro-Caribbean religious practice in Panama, where most people (58%) \u2013 including 66% of Panamanian Catholics and 46% of Protestants \u2013 engage in at least three out of the eight indigenous beliefs and practices mentioned in the survey.\n\nSS. Popes John XXIII and Paul VI had their Ostpolitik \u2014 an irenic approach to relations between the Catholic Church and the countries of the Soviet bloc. That came to an end with the election of the Polish pope, who was confrontational towards the Soviets. Now Pope Francis\u2019s church, with the Latin American and German episcopate in the lead, appears to be formulating an Amazonpolitik, characterized by an irenic approach to relations with pagan indigenous peoples of Latin America.\n\nAgain, it remains to be seen what the signatories of the new Catacombs pact mean by \u201cto abandon completely\u201d a \u201ccolonialist mentality and posture\u201d and to \u201cwelcome\u201d engagement with \u201call spiritual traditions.\u201d Events in Rome this month strongly suggest that it means ceasing to claim that the Catholic Church has the Gospel truth, and that the indigenous peoples need conversion. The new Pact of the Catacombs instantiates what you might call a \u201cpreferential option for the pagans.\u201d It looks like a surrender to syncretism.\n\nMeanwhile, in Rome last night, some Catholics fought back against the syncretism, stealing the fertility idols \u2014 earlier, a Catholic communications official clarified that they were NOT supposed to represent the Virgin Mary, but rather \u201can indigenous woman who represents life\u201d and is \u201cneither pagan nor sacred\u201d (though there was a pagan ceremony involving prostration before them, in front of Francis) \u2014 from the Catholic church where they were on display, and throwing them into the Tiber. The casting them into the river begins around the 3:15 mark:\n\nUPDATE: From a tradd(ish?) Catholic, addressing left-liberal Catholics wailing this morning about the \u201ciconoclasm\u201d of throwing the fertility idols into the Tiber:\n\nI would say that I love all the concern about \"iconoclasm\" from people who have spent their entire careers defending the systematic destruction of thousands of churches and the erasure of ancient and venerable devotional practices, but the Discourse is too boring. \u2014 Matthew Walther (@matthewwalther) October 21, 2019\n\nhttps://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "description": "", "authors": ["Rod Dreher"], "top_image": "https://www.theamericanconservative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-21-at-9.53.22-AM-e1571669631912.png", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
