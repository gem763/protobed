Both players entered their losers finals match with the threat of elimination looming overhead.\n\nXanxus opened strong, making smart use of Super Saiyan Blue Vegito\u2019s annoying mixup tools and assists to put some serious damage on Kid Buu, a major part of BNBNN\u2019s team. This forced BNBBN into early usage of Sparking \u2014 a mode that empowers and heals characters \u2014 to save Kid Buu, giving Xanxus an advantage later in the match.\n\nThat said, BNBBN isn\u2019t considered one of the best Dragon Ball FighterZ players in the world for nothing, and he soon began to make a comeback against the Filipino upstart.\n\nWith just 24 seconds left on the in-game clock, both competitors had been reduced to one character apiece: Super Saiyan Vegeta for Xanxus and Kid Buu for BNBBN. As has been the case since the game\u2019s release, Super Saiyan Vegeta is an incredible assist character, but he otherwise falters when put into one-on-one situations, whereas Kid Buu excels in just about every stage of a match.\n\nAgain, it seemed BNBBN would put this one away, but that\u2019s when Xanxus employed a unique strategy in Dragon Ball FighterZ competition: running out the clock. By making smart use of his movement tools to keep away from BNBBN and going for lengthy combos, Xanxus was able to whittle away at the clock. As the seconds ticked down, BNBBN fought valiantly, but in the end, it was a losing effort. Xanxus took the round, grinning as the rarely seen \u201cTIME\u2019S UP\u201d graphic appeared on the screen.\n\nIt\u2019s certainly not as prevalent a tactic in fighting games as it is in, say, American football, where many games end with one team running out the clock while preserving a point lead, but every now and then, a fighting game match presents a similar situation.\n\nAfter all, the player with the most health left when the timer runs down in a fighting game will take the win, and thus folks who find themselves with a life lead in the final seconds of a game tend to have the advantage. This strategy isn\u2019t always looked upon in the most favourable light, mostly in the Super Smash Bros. community, but it\u2019s a viable tactic that makes great use of in-game systems to win at any cost.\n\nTime outs are particularly rare in Dragon Ball FighterZ due to a variety of factors. First, the in-game clock is absolutely massive at 300 in-game seconds, which tick away at about the same rate as real-world seconds. That\u2019s already five full minutes with which competitors are allowed to play. And unlike in other fighting games, time stops whenever characters perform supers which, if you\u2019ve ever watched a DBFZ match, you\u2019d know those get used all the time.\n\nSure, the damage dealt per second doesn\u2019t tend to be as high as one would expect from a three-on-three Vs. style game, but it\u2019s enough to get the job done most of the time. I can\u2019t remember the last time I saw a time out in serious DBFZ match, and the SEAM 2019 commentators were just as shocked by Xanxus managing to win with one.\n\nIt might seem anti-climactic, but in the fighting game community, a win is a win. This ethos permeates every level of competition. The in-game clock is there for a reason, and when it gets low, it\u2019s well within a player\u2019s rights to use that to their advantage if they have the life lead.\n\nXanxus did not manage to beat BNBBN in the full set, but for one round, he took an incredible Dragon Ball FighterZ player to the limit and walked away the winner \u2014 even if only temporarily. And that\u2019s something he can hang his hat on.", "description": "The Dragon Ball FighterZ finals bracket at South East Asia Major (SEAM) 2019 in Singapore this past weekend featured a very rare sight: a time out victory....", "authors": ["Gita Jackson", "Sarah Basford"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/grfwa4cmmkafvsigwqbq.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
