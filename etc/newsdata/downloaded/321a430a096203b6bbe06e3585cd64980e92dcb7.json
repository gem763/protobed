The original Jurassic Park trio of Laura Dern, Sam Neill, and Jeff Goldblum will be reuniting and starring together in Jurassic World 3, for the first time since the 1993 original. (While there have been a few sequels within the franchise, the gang has never fully overlapped until now.) Per Deadline, the trio will join Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard at a pivotal time for human-dino relations: The last film found the revived beasts escaping the island into the real world, where, we presume, they have a hankering for sampling the finest of flesh humans have to offer. And the herbivorous ones will attack all of our best shrubbery! Colin Trevorrow will also be back to direct, with production estimated to begin early next year.", "description": "Original Jurassic Park stars Laura Dern, Sam Neill, and Jeff Goldblum will be starring in Jurassic World 3 alongside Chris Pratt.", "authors": ["Devon Ivie"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/25/25-urassic-world-3.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
