Investigators concluded that he displayed a lack of candor when asked about the leak.\n\nThe U.S. attorney in Washington, Jessie Liu, recommended moving forward with unspecified charges against McCabe, according to people familiar with the situation who were not authorized to comment publicly. McCabe's lawyers appealed that decision to Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen, who rejected their request, one of the people said. McCabe's lawyers were informed of that decision Thursday.\n\nThe decision clears the way for prosecutors to ask a grand jury to indict McCabe, though it was unclear Thursday whether that would happen. Whether McCabe is indicted will be up to a federal grand jury in Washington.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney's Office in Washington declined to comment.\n\nThe recommendation that McCabe be charged is the latest fallout from the FBI's handling of investigations around the 2016 presidential election, when agents investigated both of the major-party candidates. Those investigations \u2013 into Russian meddling to help Trump win the presidency and Democrat Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server \u2013 inserted the FBI into the center of fraught political controversies.\n\nAndrew McCabe was a frequent target of the president's ire. More\n\nThen-Attorney General Jeff Sessions fired McCabe after a Justice Department Inspector General\u2019s report found he misstated his involvement in a leak to The Wall Street Journal days before the election about an FBI investigation into the Clinton Foundation. He was ousted days before he could begin collecting retirement benefits.\n\nMcCabe, who became acting FBI director after Trump fired James Comey in May 2017, has been the target of the president's attacks. Trump accused law enforcement officials of partisan investigations of him, his campaign and his administration. Inquiries led to charges against a half-dozen of Trump's aides and advisers.\n\nTrump applauded the decision to fire McCabe in March 2018, calling it \"a great day for democracy.\u201d Trump called McCabe a \"major sleazebag\" and argued that his conduct was akin to treason for favoring Clinton, Trump's Democratic rival in 2016.\n\nThe election-year investigations roiled the top ranks of the FBI. Internal investigators faulted McCabe and Comey for violating Justice Department rules in the final months of the campaign. Lower-level staffers were fired or reassigned.\n\nThe Justice Department announced Aug. 29 that Comey violated bureau policies for keeping private memos about his conversations with Trump, then having a friend describe the contents of one memo to The New York Times for a story. The department didn't charge Comey criminally.\n\nMcCabe's firing came after the inspector general investigated the information behind a Wall Street Journal story about the Clinton Foundation to determine whether it was an unauthorized leak and if so, who was the source. The story appeared online Oct. 30, 2016, and in print Oct. 31, which was a week after another story reported that McCabe terminated the foundation probe under pressure from the Justice Department.", "description": "Federal prosecutors recommended that the former FBI deputy director be charged.
