Azour, who previously served as Lebanon's minister of finance from 2005 to 2008, said that if the government dedicates itself to executing functional governance, that translates into better services and job creation. Unemployment in Lebanon currently hovers between 35% and 40%.\n\n\"Therefore, I think it's very important now to stabilize the financial situation by addressing the fiscal imbalances, by providing clear direction of reforms that addresses some of the long lasting issues, the structural problems, and also to show that there is a resolve to have the state function to service the needs and aspirations of the people in the street.\"\n\nLebanon's banks remain closed eleven days into the mostly peaceful protests, sparking fears of a rush on the banks and a depletion of the country's dollar reserves once they do finally reopen.\n\nTo address this fear, Lebanon has put a temporary ban on taking large amounts of dollar cash out of the country. Many blame Lebanon's dangerously low foreign currency levels on the policies of its central bank governor Riad Salameh.", "description": "Lebanon's leaders need to win back the confidence of its citizenry not by announcing reforms, but by their actual implementation, the IMF's Middle East and Central Asia director told CNBC.", "authors": ["Natasha Turak"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106206378-1572241343769gettyimages-1178449466.jpg?v=1572241507", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
