'Each training I'm suffering because of pain. Every race I train hard.\n\n'Training and riding and doing competition are medicine for me. I push so hard - to push literally all my fear and everything away.'\n\nVervoort (left, in Doha, and right, in hospital) had spoken openly about being unable to sleep, as her eyesight disappeared and painkillers became less effective against her agonising seizures\n\nIt had initially been reported the brave Paralympian intended to die after the Games in Brazil (pictured) when she told a French newspaper the Rio Paralympics was her 'last wish'\n\nThe inspirational athlete Vervoort is seen playing with her Labrador Zenn (left and right) as she lies in a hospital bed\n\nIn an interview the Telegraph in 2017, Vervoort said from her hospital bed the pain had become too much, adding: 'I don't want to suffer any more.'\n\nShe spoke with her pet Labrador Zenn by her side, saying she had already thought about every detail of her death and had written letters to her loved-ones.\n\nVervoort said at the time she wanted white butterflies to be released from a red box when she died, as well as her ashes to be scattered in the sea off Lanzarote where she spent Christmases since 2008.\n\nShe continued: 'It's too hard for me now.

Euthanasia, the act of deliberately ending someone's life to relieve them of their suffering, was legalised in Belgium in 2003. Legalisation came a year after the Netherlands, which approved the controversial practice for people in 'unbearable' suffering. In 2007, 495 Belgians chose to die through euthanasia. Figures revealed there were 2,028 such deaths in the country in 2016 and 2,309 in 2017. Luxembourg is the only other country in Europe that has approved euthanasia and assisted suicide \u2013 both of which remain illegal in the UK. The two acts involve a different degree of involvement from the doctor. Under the Suicide Act 1961, it is illegal to knowingly help someone end their life - known as assisted suicide. It carries a maximum 14-year prison sentence. Euthanasia is considered either manslaughter or murder, depending on the circumstances. It is punishable with a maximum penalty of up to life imprisonment. Countries such as Spain, Sweden, England, Italy, Hungary, and Norway allow passive euthanasia under strict circumstances. Passive euthanasia is when a patient suffers from an incurable disease and decides not to apply life-prolonging treatments, such as artificial nutrition or hydration.\n\nVervoort was a strong advocate of the right to choose euthanasia.\n\nLike training hard, she said it gave her control and put 'my own life in my hands'.\n\n'I'm really scared, but those (euthanasia) papers give me a lot of peace of mind because I know when it's enough for me, I have those papers,' she said.\n\n'If I didn't have those papers, I think I'd have done suicide already. I think there will be fewer suicides when every country has the law of euthanasia. ... I hope everybody sees that this is not murder, but it makes people live longer.'\n\nVervoort's health problems began in 2000 when she was struck down by the rare disease, progressive tetraplegia, which paralysed her. The cause of her condition originated from a rare deformity between her fifth and sixth cerebral vertebrae, doctors believe.\n\nTo aid her recovery, she started playing wheelchair basketball before building up to triathlon and competing in the 2007 Hawaii Ironman.\n\nBut by 2008, Vervoort's condition deteriorated, meaning she was unable to take part in triathlon and instead moved on to wheelchair sprinting.\n\nThe athlete showed her will to live by tackling tough training but her deteriorating condition meant she had to give it up.\n\nHer pain was so severe at times that she would lose consciousness, and said the sight of her in agony has caused others to pass out.\n\nVervoort also had epileptic seizures and had one in 2014 when she was cooking pasta and spilled boiling water over her legs. That resulted in a four-month hospital stay.\n\nShe later became paralysed up to her breasts.\n\nHer pain was so severe at times that she would lose consciousness, and said the sight of her in agony has caused others to pass out\n\nTo aid her recovery, she started playing wheelchair basketball before building up to triathlon and competing in the 2007 Hawaii Ironman.

She said she can be pain-free one minute, and nearly pass out a few minutes later.\n\n'You have to live day-by-day and enjoy the little moments,' she said. 'Everybody tomorrow can have a car accident and die, or a heart attack and die. It can be tomorrow for everybody.'\n\nVervoort called herself a 'crazy lady'.\n\nVervoort's (left, with Michelle Stilwell of Canada and bronze medallist Kerry Morgan of the US in 2012) health problems began in 2000 when she was struck down by the rare disease, progressive tetraplegia, which paralysed her\n\nIn the past she said it gave her the control and 'puts my own life in my hands'.

I get more and more depressed. I never had these feelings before. I cry a lot.' Pictured in 2012\n\nShe talked of flying in an F-16 fighter jet, riding in a rally car, and she was curating a museum of her life going back to at least 14 when she was diagnosed with her rare illness.\n\nShe had spiky hair and wanted to be remembered as the lady who was 'always laughing, always smiling'.\n\n'I feel different about death now than years ago,' Vervoort said previously. 'For me I think death is something like they operate on you, you go to sleep and you never wake up. For me it's something peaceful.'\n\nVervoort said in 2017 there would be Champagne at her wake and added: 'The people will cry, but I want them also to give thanks for the life I had, for the fact that I'm happy now I'm at peace.'\n\nAbove all, she said she wanted to inspire as many as people through her sporting achievements.\n\nIn Belgium she ranked alongside the likes of Manchester City superstar Kevin De Bruyne as a sports figure.\n\n'The best goal you can have is to make people happy,' she said in 2017.\n\nEuthanasia was legalised in Belgium in 2002, and can take place with the written consent of three doctors.\n\nIt was the second country in the world to legalise euthanasia after Holland liberalised the law a year earlier.\n\nPreviously Vervoort has said of euthanasia: 'I feel different about death now than years ago.\n\n'For me I think death is something like they operate on you, you go to sleep and you never wake up. For me it's something peaceful.'\n\nDiest will have a book of condolence to Vervoort in its town hall from Wednesday.", "description": "Belgian wheelchair sprinter Marieke Vervoort suffered with constant pain and paralysis in her legs.
