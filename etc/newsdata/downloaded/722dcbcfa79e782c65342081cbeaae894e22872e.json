REUTERS/Jason Lee/File Photo\n\nThe Solomon Islands was the sixth country to switch allegiance to China since President Tsai Ing-wen took office in Taiwan in 2016. Its decision on Monday dealt her a new blow in her struggle to secure re-election in January amid criticism of her handling of rising tension with Beijing.\n\nTaiwan has condemned China for luring its allies with promises of easy loans and aid, accusations Beijing denies.\n\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying implied Taiwan was the one guilty of practicing dollar diplomacy.\n\n\u201cOf course, for those who are used to buying diplomacy with money, they may not understand that some principles cannot be bought, and that trust cannot be bought,\u201d Hua told a daily news briefing.\n\nThe Solomon Islands\u2019 decision to go with China was in line with the trend of the times, and it would have China\u2019s full support, she added.\n\n\u201cWe believe that the establishment and development of diplomatic relations with the People\u2019s Republic of China, with more than 1.4 billion people and the world\u2019s second largest economy with a bright future, will surely bring unprecedented opportunities for development for the Solomon Islands.\u201d\n\nHua did not directly answer a question on when China would formally establish ties with the Solomons, citing only an old Chinese expression meaning that everything will happen at the right time: \u201cWhen a melon is ripe, it falls off its stem; and when water flows, a channel is formed\u201d.\n\nThe Solomon Islands said it felt \u201cprofound gratitude\u201d to the government and people of Taiwan for the deep and friendly relations and cooperation over 36 years.\n\nThe Solomons would establish a bilateral cooperation framework with China to immediately address areas previously supported by Taiwan, the government said in a statement, posted on social media.\n\nONLY SIXTEEN\n\nTaiwan now has formal relations with only 16 countries, many of them small, less developed nations in Central America and the Pacific, including Belize and Nauru.\n\nChina claims Taiwan as its territory and says it has no right to formal ties with any nation.\n\nThe Solomon Islands\u2019 decision followed a months-long review of the pros and cons of a switch to Beijing, which was offering $8.5 million in development funds to replace support from Taiwan.\n\nChina has in recent years been expanding its influence in the South Pacific, to the concern of the United States and its main ally in the region, Australia.\n\nTaiwan has been losing allies in other parts of the world too.\n\nBurkina Faso, the Dominican Republic, Sao Tome and Principe, Panama and El Salvador have cut off ties with Taipei in recent years.\n\nBeijing has stepped up its pressure on Taiwan, including sending regular Chinese bomber patrols around the island, since Tsai took office.\n\nChina suspects Tsai of pushing for Taiwan\u2019s formal independence, a red line for Beijing. She says she wants to maintain the status quo, but will defend Taiwan\u2019s freedom and democracy.", "description": "The Solomon Islands will have unprecedented development opportunities now that it has ditched ties with Taiwan in favour of China, Beijing said on Tuesday, a major victory for China in its campaign to pressure the self-ruled, democratic island.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190917&t=2&i=1430772442&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8G0LT", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
