It emulates a stock exchange by providing market data such as 52-week high and low prices.\n\nSneaker resale is becoming a fiercely contested market as a raft of sites vie to cater to often-young shoppers who collect rare merchandise and try to sell it at a markup online.\n\nA pair of Nike Dunks that once retailed for $200 sold on StockX in July for $13,500.\n\nThe growth has fueled new funding. In February, Foot Locker Inc. said it was investing $100 million in Goat Group, an online sneaker reseller. Last December, Farfetch Ltd. said it was acquiring Stadium Goods in a deal valued at $250 million.\n\nStockX in June closed a $110 million funding round that valued the company at $1 billion.\n\nThe Bleacher Report deal is StockX\u2019s first effort to lure users to its online marketplace with content from a media partner, StockX Chief Executive Officer Scott Cutler said. He added that the company could form similar tie-ups with other partners.\n\n\u201cWe want to be in the places where our community is convening and gathering information,\u201d Mr. Cutler said. \u201cAs we grow into the next phase of our business\u2014we have customers in 170 countries around the world and are rapidly expanding outside of the U.S.\u2014we expect to expand these types of partnerships at a global level.\u201d\n\nRelated Video Sneaker Con co-founder Yu-Ming Wu and Hayden Sharitt, a 21-year-old resale business owner, take us inside the industry where some sellers make millions of dollars on pre-owned shoes, as they attend a sneaker trading show in Cleveland.

StockX has previously set up marketing installations at events like South by Southwest in Austin, Texas, and ComplexCon in Long Beach, California.\n\nStockX is on pace to facilitate more than $1 billion in transactions this year, according to the company. The company has previously said its platform could handle more than $6 billion of annual sales by 2025.\n\nStockX makes money by collecting a 3% processing fee, plus transaction fees that range from 9.5% for sneakers and streetwear to 14.5% for handbags. Its revenue has doubled over the past year, the company said.\n\nCorrections & Amplifications\n\nAn earlier version of this article misstated the surname of StockX Chief Executive Officer Scott Cutler as Cullen.
