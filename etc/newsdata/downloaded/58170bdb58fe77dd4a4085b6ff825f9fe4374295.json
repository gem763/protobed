Last week during a similar round of crucial Brexit votes I was back in A&E with the same problem and in excruciating pain.\u201d\n\nThe MP added that the events left in her tears out of frustration that she was \u201cdismissed\u201d and told to \u201csimply live with a syndrome that causes so much pain and risk on a monthly basis\u201d.\n\nIn a Twitter thread after the event, Haigh revealed that she had not discussed her experiences with many people but realised that by not sharing her story, she was \u201cperpetuating tropes\u201d that talking about periods was \u201cunclean and shameful\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to normalise discussion about women\u2019s health and about periods so that women can seek treatment and support for their condition,\u201d Haigh wrote.\n\n\u201cBy speaking out in Parliament, I hope that together we can seriously move this agenda forward and demonstrate to millions of women across the country that their voices are heard and that we no longer will allow them to suffer in silence.\u201d\n\nHaigh has since received messages of support from Twitter users, praising her for raising awareness of conditions like PCOS and endometriosis.\n\n\u201cWell done for speaking out, I know many women who struggle with these problems and they absolutely need more understanding and support,\u201d one person commented.\n\nAnother wrote: \u201cYes!!!! It\u2019s a lifelong debilitating condition in some cases. I\u2019m a US patient but fully support your work. Thank you.\u201d\n\nThe debate, which was held to help raise awareness of endometriosis in the workplace, was led by Conservative MP Alec Shelbrooke.\n\nShelbrooke stated that raising awareness of the condition, especially amongst employers, was paramount to tackling this disease and that being aware of the chronic condition would help people be more understanding and sympathetic to those who suffer from it.\n\nEarlier this month, MPs announced they would be launching an inquiry into endometriosis after thousands of women revealed how the condition negatively impacted their lives.\n\nMore than 13,500 women took part in a study conducted by the BBC, with nearly all of them stating the condition had been detrimental to their careers, sex lives and mental health.", "description": "A Labour MP has opened up about experiencing a ruptured ovarian cyst to help tackle the stigma surrounding periods.
