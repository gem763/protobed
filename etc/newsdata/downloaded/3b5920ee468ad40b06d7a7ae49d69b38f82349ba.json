The streaming network announced today that it\u2019s added a special from Slate titled Stage Fright, which is described as a mix of stand-up, clips from her childhood, and interviews with her family. Throughout the course of the special, Slate \u201covercomes her stage fright while telling stories about her visit to a midnight Catholic Mass and the ghosts that haunted her childhood home.\u201d Here\u2019s the announcement video Slate posted about the special today:\n\nSlate has been pretty open about her stage fright over the years. Speaking to Vulture in 2016, she said, \u201cI look forward to being seen, and to accepting that part of myself that needs attention and is willing to give something nice to get something nice. I look forward to being a little scared \u2026 I look forward to pushing myself to be confident, because I get crazy stage fright, always have, and I feel proud every time I push through that.\u201d She also said she didn\u2019t want to record her own stand-up at the time for a special, explaining, \u201cI want to let my stand-up be small and immediate and let it float up into the sky like a balloon when I\u2019m done. I want to not fetishize what I do as a comedian, but I also want to keep it exactly what I want it to be. I don\u2019t want notes on it. I don\u2019t want people to be able to dissect it.\u201d Thankfully, we can all have the pleasure of finding out how Slate got over that fear when Stage Fright makes its Netflix debut on Tuesday, October 22.", "description": "\u201cSNL\u201d alum Jenny Slate is heading to Netflix next month with the premiere of her first comedy special, \u201cStage Fright.\u201d It will be a mix of stand-up, clips from her childhood, and interviews with her family.", "authors": ["Megh Wright"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/16/16-jenny-slate.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
