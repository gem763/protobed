As the last \u201cadult in the room\u201d at the White House, observers worried that his departure would loosen the president\u2019s behavior even further. Days after the news broke though, Christmas and the government shutdown pushed Mattis\u2019s resignation into the background.\n\nNow, nine months later, he\u2019s beginning to speak publicly again. For the latest issue of the magazine, Editor in Chief Jeffrey Goldberg wrote about a series of conversations he had with Mattis. He rejoins Radio Atlantic with the host Edward-Isaac Dovere.\n\nListen for:\n\nWhether Mattis, the most respected figure to serve in Trump\u2019s Cabinet, will speak openly about the president before the election;\n\nWhy a defense secretary may not be the check on a president that many believe him to be (as Goldberg says, the commander in chief is a democratically elected \u201cnuclear monarch\u201d);\n\nAnd whether the departure of the last \u201cadult in the room\u201d has mattered.
