Will they hurt the former VP anyway?", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE President Trump held a press conference today to discuss the recent whistleblower accusation and impeachment inquiries. USA TODAY\n\nThe release of a summary of President Donald Trump's controversial phone call with Ukraine\u2019s president has intensified Democrats\u2019 contention that the president committed an impeachable offense by asking a foreign leader to investigate his political rival Joe Biden.\n\nBut even as Democrats express outrage over Trump\u2019s apparent desire for Ukraine officials to dig up dirt on Biden, the impeachment inquiry has created a complicated dynamic for the former vice president and top 2020 presidential contender, political analysts, voters and Democratic strategists say.\n\nThe scandal has also put the spotlight on Biden\u2019s son Hunter Biden\u2019s past work for a Ukraine energy company and given Trump the opportunity to raise doubts about Biden with voters, analysts say.\n\nCLOSE Whistleblowers have been at time essential and detrimental to a country's democracy, but what makes them different than a leaker? We explain. Just the FAQs, USA TODAY\n\nNo proof has emerged to support Trump's allegations about Biden and Ukraine. But as Trump's interaction with Ukraine percolates in the headlines, potentially for months to come, will the facts be obscured for voters?\n\n\u201cThere is a real concern for Biden that many people aren\u2019t going to take the time to sort out the issues and make a decision about what\u2019s right and wrong,\u201d says Karen Kedrowski, a political scientist at Iowa State University. \u201cInstead, it\u2019s really going to contribute to this general idea Trump\u2019s wants to push that there is something smarmy about Biden. It\u2019s exactly what Trump did to Hillary Clinton.\u201d\n\nThe situation also comes amidst the release of a pair of polls \u2014 a national survey and one in the first-in-the-nation caucus state of Iowa \u2014 in recent days that show Biden in a dead heat with Sen. Elizabeth Warren in the battle for the Democratic nomination. While the nomination race is tightening, multiple polls have shown Biden leading Trump by a wider margin in a head-to-head race than any other Democratic candidate.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden leaves after a fundraiser appearance Wednesday, Sept. 25, 2019, in Manhattan Beach, Calif. (Photo: Marcio Jose Sanchez, AP)\n\nAs details of Trump\u2019s July 25 call in which he urged Ukraine\u2019s president Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden became public, the former vice president and his campaign aides pushed back against unsubstantiated accusations floated by Trump and his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani about the Bidens.\n\nImpeachment: What would it take to impeach Donald Trump? Here's how the constitutional process works\n\nLawmakers get first look: 'Deeply disturbing': Lawmakers read whistleblower complaint at center of Trump-Ukraine scandal\n\nMore: 'I would like you to do us a favor.' What Trump and Zelensky said in their July 25 phone call\n\nTrump and Giuliani contend that Biden, while vice president, forced the firing of Ukraine\u2019s then-top prosecutor Viktor Shokin because Shokin was investigating an oligarch connected to Burisma Group. Burisma is an energy company where Hunter Biden previously held a seat on the board of directors that paid him $50,000 per month.\n\nBut the Obama administration, along with several European nations, said they in fact pressed for the firing of Shokin because he was feckless in rooting out corruption in the Eastern European nation.\n\nThe attempt by Trump to turn the focus on Biden and his son has enraged the former vice president and some of his surrogates.\n\n\u201cIf this isn\u2019t treason, what is?\u201d said South Carolina state Sen. Dick Harpootlian, a top Biden backer in the Palmetto state, which will hold the fourth primary of 2020 election cycle. \u201cThis is clear cut. (Trump) concedes he called a foreign power. He concedes he asked them to investigate the Bidens. He implied that the foreign aid was conditioned on him doing an investigation. If you recruit a foreign power to interfere in our elections, that\u2019s treason.\u201d\n\nFollowing the release of the summary of the Trump-Zelensky call, Biden on Wednesday called it \"a tragedy for this country that our president put personal politics above his sacred oath.\" Biden added in a statement that he hoped to turn the page as Congress moves forward with its impeachment inquiry and focus on presenting his vision to voters.\n\n\"I will continue to focus my campaign not on how Donald Trump abused his power to come after my family, but on how he has turned his back on America's families,\" Biden said.\n\nBiden, who spent more than 40 years in elected office, is fiercely protective of his family and speaks often of the inspiration of his late son Beau Biden, the former Delaware attorney general who died in 2015 of brain cancer while the former vice president was still in office.\n\nPresident Donald Trump meets with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy at the InterContinental Barclay New York hotel during the United Nations General Assembly on Sept. 25, 2019, in New York. (Photo: Evan Vucci, AP)\n\nHe more rarely speaks publicly of Hunter Biden, 49, a Yale-educated attorney who worked as an executive for the Delaware-based banks MBNA, a top campaign contributor to Biden's senate campaigns, and also did lucrative work as a lobbyist and was partner in a advisory firm.\n\nHunter Biden earlier this year spoke to the New Yorker magazine about his years-long struggles with drug and alcohol addiction. He was kicked out of the Naval Reserve in 2014 after a failed drug test.\n\nThe younger Biden, who divorced in 2016 after 23 years of marriage, also grabbed headlines after it became public that he was dating his late brother\u2019s widow, Hallie. This past spring, Hunter then married a South African woman named Melissa Cohen.\n\nBiden told supporters at a fundraiser in the Bel Air section of Los Angeles Wednesday that he anticipated that Trump would go after his family members.\n\nBiden recalled that as he pondered whether to make a bid for the White House that his grandchildren asked for a family meeting where they told him they were worried that he wasn\u2019t going to run.\n\n\u201cI was worried because I knew what was going to happen if I ran,\" said Biden recalling conversations he had with his grandchildren. \"And they said, \u2018But we understand Pop\u2019 and then they each gave their own story that they had written out a note as to how mean they knew it was going to be, but why (we) had to do it.\u201d\n\nBiden's son: Hunter Biden: A brief bio of former Vice President Joe Biden's son\n\nDemocratic presidential hopefuls Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren and Former Vice President Joe Biden shake hands as they arrive onstage for the third Democratic primary debate of the 2020 presidential campaign season hosted by ABC News in partnership with Univision at Texas Southern University in Houston, Texas on Sept.12, 2019.

Brown, AFP/Getty Images)\n\nMiriam Kenning, 69, a Democrat from Ottumwa, Iowa, stopped Biden as he campaigned last weekend at the Polk County Democrats Steak Fry in Des Moines amid reports of Trump pressuring Zelensky to probe the Bidens. She squeezed Biden\u2019s arm, thanked him for his service during the Obama administration, and told him to keep up the fight.\n\nIn an interview, Kenning expressed outrage that Trump would attempt to encourage a foreign leader to investigate Biden. But Kenning also had a measure of concern that Trump could benefit by sullying Biden\u2019s reputation with swing voters as the impeachment inquiry plays out in Washington.\n\n\u201cOf course it impacts me,\u201d said Kenning, who said Biden is among five Democratic White House hopefuls she is weighing caucusing for in February. \u201cI worry about them battering him over his son\u2019s life. I just think when I go and knock on doors of the little old ladies \u2014 and how all they get their information from the local (conservative) news stations' coverage about all of this. What I fear the old ladies will be saying to me is, \u2018Biden wasn\u2019t right. Something is wrong.\u2019 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right, but it\u2019s reality. And that\u2019s what\u2019s sad.\u201d\n\nThe Trump-aligned Great America PAC announced Wednesday plans for a six-figure ad buy in which they\u2019ll highlight Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings in Ukraine and China while his father served as vice president. The ads, which the PAC dubbed \u201cwhite privilege,\u201d will air on Fox News and online.\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign has also expressed frustration with the Trump team\u2019s efforts to try to turn Trump\u2019s Ukraine scandal into an issue for Biden.\n\nAfter House Speaker Nancy Pelosi this week announced she was opening an impeachment inquiry, Republican National Committee chairwoman Ronna McDaniel called on Biden to release transcripts of his calls with Ukraine and China officials during his time as vice president.\n\nBiden campaign national press secretary TJ Ducklo slammed McDaniel\u2019s request as nonsensical.\n\n\u201cImagine our disbelief that Republicans called for Joe Biden to break the law and release classified transcripts he doesn't have access to or permission to release, given their track record for holding politicians who commit crimes accountable and their general ethical and moral conduct across the board,\u201d Ducklo said. \u201cWith their newfound sense of transparency, will they also ask President Donald Trump to release his tax returns, something he promised to do nearly 4 years ago?\u201d\n\nSam Johnson, a Democratic strategist in South Carolina, said that situation could potentially prove to be a great opportunity for Biden.\n\n\u201cHis selling point has been that he could stand up to Trump,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt could potentially offer Joe the opportunity to have a unique conversation with Trump where he could say, \u2018Look, my family did nothing wrong and this is not how you act presidential.\u2019 This is an opportunity for him to show voters that he could stand a step above primary candidates and a step above Trump above himself.\u201d\n\nFor now, it seems unlikely that Biden\u2019s Democratic rivals will raise questions about Hunter Biden\u2019s overseas business dealings.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden calls for impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump (Photo: From @Joe Biden / Facebook)\n\nSouth Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who is trailing Biden in the polls, said unequivocally in a CNN interview Tuesday that he would not raise questions about the former vice president\u2019s son to make his case for his own candidacy.\n\n\u201cI don't think we should allow this kind of \u2018whataboutism\u2019 that allows what was clearly an egregious pattern of behavior by this president to turn into an excuse to allow them to say, \u2018Look over there. Look at this thing that happened,\u2019\" Buttigieg said. \u201cWe are talking about an extraordinary, perhaps unprecedented breach of the oath of office by the American president, and if they tried to change the subject, we've got to make sure that that can't happen.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, Biden faces a difficult task in having to fight Trump\u2019s efforts to muddy his record as voters begin to tune into the 2020 election, said Ross Baker, a Rutgers University political scientist.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a contamination effect on the Biden campaign,\u201d Baker said. \u201cEven though he isn\u2019t the bearer of the pathogen, he is forced to wear the surgical mask. It\u2019s not becoming in the course of the campaign \u2014 even if you\u2019re completely in the clear \u2014 to have to explain things that your opponent is saying about you even if they aren\u2019t true.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/09/26/joe-biden-tries-avoid-trump-bringing-him-down-impeachment-inquiry-looms/2446704001/", "description": "The impeachment inquiry targeted at President Trump over Ukraine has created\u00a0a complicated dynamic for former vice president Joe Biden's 2020 campaign.", "authors": ["Aamer Madhani", "Published A.M.
