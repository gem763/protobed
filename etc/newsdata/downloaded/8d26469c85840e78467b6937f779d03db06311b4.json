They took place even as Giuliani was representing President Trump as the Mueller investigation was ongoing, and while he was serving as one of President Trump\u2019s more regular advisers and confidants. Giuliani is still working as the president's lawyer, even though the redacted Mueller report has been delivered to the Department of Justice and made public.\n\nWhile the Bahraini government was enlisting Giuliani for help with its police force, it was also attempting to influence Trump administration policy.\n\nBahrain officially employs half a dozen lobbying and public-relations firms in the United States, according to the Justice Department\u2019s database of registered foreign agents. They work on issues ranging from counterterrorism efforts to trade and foreign investment promotion to more vaguely defined advocacy and public affairs initiatives. Specific goals in Washington, D.C., include stepping up military cooperation and an effort to win an exemption to Trump administration steel and aluminum tariffs.\n\nBahrain\u2019s Ministry of Interior did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nGiuliani was spotted in Bahrain last December at a royal palace in Manama, meeting with the king of the critical U.S. ally in the Middle East. At the time, the Bahrain News Agency, a government-run news service, reported that Giuliani and King Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa talked about \u201cBahraini-U.S. relations,\u201d and characterized Trump\u2019s personal lawyer as the leader of a \u201chigh-level US delegation.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times reported on that visit in December, and indicated that Giuliani was seeking business with the Bahraini government. But the official establishment of that business relationship has not been previously reported.\n\nAsked by The Daily Beast if he and the king discussed Trump during their December photo op, Giuliani said, \u201cI can\u2019t recall,\u201d and insisted that the discussion was \u201cpretty strictly for us [to] train the police.\u201d\n\nGiuliani said that his firm\u2019s official work with Bahrain \u201cdoesn\u2019t involve any lobbying,\u201d and doesn\u2019t involve \u201cgiving policy advice\u201d or legal work. \u201cI never discussed Bahrain with anybody in the [Trump] administration including the president,\u201d he said. \u201c[Our] contract has clauses in it that say no lobbying, no foreign representation\u2026 I provide you a service. I don\u2019t get involved in trying to solve your problems with the U.S. government.\u201d\n\nGiuliani did not provide The Daily Beast with a copy of the contract as of press time.\n\nIn his role as a member of President Trump\u2019s outside legal team, Giuliani isn\u2019t a government employee and thus not bound by laws that bar U.S. government officials (including White House attorneys) from simultaneously working for a foreign government. Still, the distinction hasn\u2019t stopped government ethicists and watchdogs from calling into question the virtue of Giuliani\u2019s foreign work, and pursuit of work in several countries, as he holds such a close working and personal relationship with President Trump.\n\n\u201cGiuliani getting paid by a repressive foreign government while he acts as the president\u2019s personal attorney and advisor looks really bad,\u201d said Brendan Fischer, the director of federal reforms at the Campaign Legal Center. \u201cEven if Giuliani's contract with Bahrain doesn\u2019t include lobbying, it is easy to imagine that the Bahraini government anticipates that giving money to the president\u2019s close advisor is going to help Bahrain promote its interests inside the White House.\u201d\n\nGiuliani\u2019s work for could raise additional eyebrows owing to the country\u2019s highly-criticized human rights record, which has included brutally suppressing protesters and political opposition, allegations of torture committed by the police, and stripping activists of their citizenship. Asked about this track record, Giuliani said he views Bahrain as \u201cone of the more progressive Muslim countries,\u201d and that \u201cI actually think they\u2019re one of the better Gulf countries on human rights,\u201d citing the number of women elected to parliament, for instance.\n\nGiuliani\u2019s work abroad has been a common\u2014and routinely controversial\u2014feature of his time within Trump\u2019s inner sanctum. In addition to scoring a contract with Bahrain, the president\u2019s lawyer has plans to travel to Ukraine on Sunday morning to help encourage investigators in the country to look into both the origins of the Mueller probe and dealings involving Joe Biden.\n\nAs The New York Times reported, Giuliani has been actively seeking information on the involvement of Hunter Biden, the former vice president\u2019s son, in an energy company owned by a Ukrainian oligarch. In the Obama era, the former vice president had pushed for the ouster of a Ukrainian prosecutor whose office controlled the investigations of the company, on which Hunter Biden sat on the board.\n\nGiuliani, the president, and various sectors of conservative and pro-Trump media have framed this as the next big Democratic scandal to emerge in a presidential race, on par with Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails. However, a Bloomberg story published this week said that a former Ukrainian official and official documents had presented a timeline that undercut the notion that Biden had intervened on his son\u2019s behalf.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m doing this as part of my role as the president\u2019s lawyer to follow up on [leads],\u201d Giuliani told The Daily Beast. \u201cThis is what a defense lawyer does\u2026I\u2019m going after it like a hound dog.\u201d Trump\u2019s attorney also noted that he\u2019s been briefing the president on his progress, and that they\u2019ve had multiple conversations on the topic, though he wouldn\u2019t go into further detail.\n\nGiuliani did say that, based on their private chats, he believed he had the full blessing of President Trump to pursue this private investigation\u2014one now explicitly designed to yield potentially damaging information on one of the president\u2019s a top 2020 challengers.\n\n\u201cThe president has expressed the same level of interest in this that he\u2019s expressed in the Steele affidavit,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to investigate this and trying to figure this all out. I don\u2019t have electronic surveillance, or a grand jury.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m having too much fun,\u201d Giuliani added, letting out a couple of chuckles. \u201cOne day, I\u2019m gonna have to go back to boring lawyer work.\u201d", "description": "The president\u2019s lawyer has signed a contract with Bahrain even as he continues to rep Donald Trump.", "authors": ["Asawin Suebsaeng", "Lachlan Markay", "White House Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1557510803/190510-Swin-rudy-tease_rs2cqg", "published_at": "2019-05-10"}
