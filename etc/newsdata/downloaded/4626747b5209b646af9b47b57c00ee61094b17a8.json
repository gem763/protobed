The Bengals have never reached the playoffs after opening the season 0-3, let alone four straight losses. Dating back to last season, Cincinnati has lost six straight and 13 of its last 15 games.\n\n\u201cIn football, there\u2019s going to be ups and downs, there\u2019s going to be good plays and bad plays,\u201d cornerback Dre Kirkpatrick said. \u201cBut the most frustrating thing to me is losing.\u201d\n\nPittsburgh has won nine straight against the Bengals and 12 of 13 overall, with Cincinnati\u2019s only victory at Heinz Field in 2015 during that time. The Bengals are 6-16 in primetime games - including 2-6 on Monday night - since 2011, when quarterback Andy Dalton was a rookie.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, I can take the losing, but when you go out there and get embarrassed, Monday night, prime time . I have too much pride to go out there and showcase what we showcased,\u201d receive Tyler Boyd said.\n\nDalton entered the game second in the league in passing, but he was held to just 171 yards. Joe Mixon had 62 yards for a Bengals\u2018 offense that ranks last in the league in rushing. Receiver A.J. Green worked out before pregame warmups, but he missed his fourth game with an ankle injury suffered in training camp.\n\n\u201cWe have to make plays, we have to execute better,\u201d Dalton said. \u201cIt\u2019s everywhere and it starts with me. We have to improve what we\u2019ve done to this point because it\u2019s nowhere near the level that we want to play.\u201d\n\nPittsburgh fumbled on its second offensive play and Cincinnati turned it into an early 3-0 lead following a 28-yard Randy Bullock field goal. The Bengals begin the series on the Pittsburgh 15, but only managed five yards before Bullock\u2019s kick.\n\nAfter the field goal, the Cincinnati offense went three-and-out three times and fumbled another time in its next four possessions, as the Steeler defense harassed Dalton, and finished with eight sacks.\n\nCincinnati, trailing 7-3 in the second quarter, pushed to the Pittsburgh 11. But the drive stalled on the ninth play when Bud Dupree forced a Dalton fumble, recovered by T.J. Watt, giving possession - and the momentum - to Pittsburgh.\n\n\u201cWe have to score when the defense turns the ball over,\u201d Boyd said. \u201cWhen we had the fumble, we had to score on that drive, as well. If we score on both of those drives, the game would\u2019ve been different.\u201d\n\nThe Steeler offense peppered the Bengals\u2018 defense with short, high-percentage passes. Mason Rudolph, making his second NFL start with the injured Ben Roethlisberger sidelined for the season, was an efficient 24 of 28 for 229 yards and two touchdowns. James Conner and Jaylen Samuels combined for 208 total yards and two touchdowns on 36 touches. Samuels didn\u2019t touch the ball during Pittsburgh\u2019s loss last week at San Francisco.\n\nPittsburgh turned a 10-3 halftime lead to a 14-point advantage on the opening drive of the third quarter. Samuels hit Conner with a 21-yard wildcat pitch and then punched it in for a 2-yard touchdown on the next play, making it 17-3.\n\nTwo plays after a Cincinnati three-and-out, Rudolph found a wide-open Diontae Johnson for a 43-yard touchdown and a 24-3 lead.\n\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s watching and you\u2019re trying to get a big win to show that you\u2019re not the team you were the first three weeks,\u201d Bengals linebacker Preston Brown said. \u201cBut we showed that we are that team, so we have to fight and show everybody that we can get better. If not, we\u2019re going to keep losing a lot of games.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Cincinnati Bengals couldn't dig out of a winless hole despite a prime-time road matchup against their biggest rival.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Dan Scifo"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/01/bengals_steelers_football_06720_c0-126-3000-1875_s1770x1032.jpg?85e3f3a90d2b6cb216aa7875ca9e51bf768c5416", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
