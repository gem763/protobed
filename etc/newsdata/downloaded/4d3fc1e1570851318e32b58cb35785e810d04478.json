I wanted to stay, I wanted to play here and continue my career at Juve.\n\n\"I think I can still give a lot and I showed a glimpse of that against Inter.\n\n\"That's exactly what I wanted. Both me and Higuain - that's what we want.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\n\"I believe that the two of us spoke little of everything that happened, but we wanted to stay at Juventus and ... well, look - we both have scored goals at Inter. It's better to talk on the pitch with facts.\"\n\nAfter failing to land Dybala in January, both Manchester United and Tottenham have struggled.\n\nUnited in particular have lacked goals and creativity that the playmaker could have offered, failing to replace Alexis Sanchez and Romelu Lukaku, both on the losing side as Dybala downed Inter Milan at the weekend.", "description": "Paulo Dybala has given his verdict on his summer as he stayed at Juventus after Man Utd and Tottenham transfer interest", "authors": ["Rich Jones", "Image", "Sipa Usa Pa Images", "Getty Images", "Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article18923055.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Juventus-v-Atalanta-Serie-A-Juventus-Stadium.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
