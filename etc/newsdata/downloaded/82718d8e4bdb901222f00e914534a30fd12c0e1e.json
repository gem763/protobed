When we do that we will build a future for all of our people.\u201d Patrice Motsepe\n\nThose who donate more than R50 million would be entitled to have representatives on both the advisory council and technical committee that will assess applications for funding.\n\n\n\nThe advisory council, Motsepe said, would be similar to a board of directors and the 33 churches would have two representatives on it and another on the committee. The rest of both governance structures would be made up from the foundation and experts in corporate governance, law, audit and business development.\n\n\u201cWhat makes this partnership unique is that it is driven and focused on our religious and faith-based organisations and initiating projects to help create jobs,\u201d Motsepe said, adding that the money was not for the churches but job-creating initiatives in communities.\n\nRead: Motsepe gives eSwatini university a R10m boost\n\nAsked why the fund had not opted to partner with government, Motsepe said: \u201cI don\u2019t like working with government.\u201d\n\nHe cited government\u2019s bureaucratic red tape as an obstacle. \u201cGovernment is critically important but they waste time and decisions don\u2019t get taken quickly and they have meetings upon meetings.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to City Press on the sideline of the event, Precious Moloi-Motsepe, co-founder of the foundation, said both companies and non-profit organisations would be allowed to apply for funding.\n\n\u201cThe important thing is that the businesses that are brought to us are not self-enriching projects.\n\n\u201cWe need to see that you will be creating jobs,\u201d she said.\n\nShe pointed out that the details on whether the funding would be granted or interest-free loans or a combination of both were yet to be ironed out.\n\n\u201cAs a foundation, we have no profit motive, so we are putting seed capital and hoping other philanthropists will also come and contribute,\u201d she said.\n\nMotsepe recently also announced that he was involved in setting up another fund to help emerging black farmers.\n\n\n\nAccording to BusinessLive, Motsepe announced the fund at the African Farmers Association of SA (Afasa) agribusiness transformation conference, held in Bloemfontein earlier this month.\n\nHe said that the fund would focus on assisting those in agriculture, agribusiness and related industries.\n\n\u201cWe need black farmers to be part of sustainable, commercially viable and profitable enterprises.
