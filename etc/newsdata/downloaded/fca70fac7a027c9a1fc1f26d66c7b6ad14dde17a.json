As the horse-drawn cart carried the former queen, her blonde hair shorn and prematurely grey, through the streets of Paris to her execution in 1793, the crowds jostled to spit and hurl insults at her.\n\nShe was 37, an Austrian-born \u201cforeigner\u201d accused of treason and of being aloof, branded a shameless spendthrift and nicknamed \u201cMadame Deficit\u201d for the bills she had run up on the finest clothes and jewels.\n\nWorse still, Marie-Antoinette was considered scandalously indifferent to the plight of the starving poor and forever damned for words there is no evidence she ever said: \u201cQu\u2019ils mangent de la brioche\u201d (Let them eat cake).\n\nToday, however, the woman France loved to hate has become a 21st-century popular icon who draws crowds to her former home at Versailles. Her image features on boxes of chocolates and macarons snapped up by tourists and she is celebrated in literature, contemporary arts and cinema.\n\nThis week, to mark the anniversary of her death, the exhibition Marie-Antoinette: the Metamorphosis of an Image opens at the Conciergerie, a former prison on the left bank of the River Seine, where the queen was held in a cell before her execution.\n\nIt features 200 works of art and objects including her last letter, portraits, caricatures and other representations, and contemporary uses of her image in manga, film and fashion.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The last letter of Marie-Antoinette. Photograph: Archives nationales\n\n\u201cThere has been a proliferation of images of Marie-Antoinette, from her lifetime to now, as if each era, each group, wanted to create \u2018their\u2019 queen: from foreign traitor to martyr, from teenage hero to exemplary mother, from the woman of culture to the fashion icon,\u201d reads the exhibition programme. \u201cAs much as she seemed out of step with the France of her time, where she was little understood, her image flourished after \u2013 and especially in the last few years.\u201d\n\nPhilippe B\u00e9laval, the president of the French Centre for National Monuments, which oversees the Conciergerie, likened Marie-Antoinette\u2019s \u201ctragic destiny\u201d to that of the late Diana, Princess of Wales.\n\n\u201cLike the Princess of Wales, Marie-Antoinette was this young, beautiful and slightly unhappy royal who was the victim of political circumstances and not prepared for the situation she had to confront,\u201d B\u00e9laval told the Guardian. \u201cShe had luxurious tastes but she represented the best of a certain period of French culture.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A poster advertising the Metamorphosis of Marie-Antoinette Exhibition at the Concierge, Paris. Photograph: Concierge, Paris\n\nB\u00e9laval said the queen\u2019s rehabilitation was more personal than political. \u201cThe history of the French Revolution is complex and Marie-Antoinette did not show complete loyalty to her country and was no supporter of the revolution, but the absolute dignity she showed through her final tribulations, the terrible trial in which she was accused of all sort of abominations, and her death make us pity her for the inhumane treatment she endured.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need to look away from her political faults to see that she was very badly treated.\u201d", "description": "Paris show includes contemporary treatment of woman France loved to hate in mangas, fashion and film", "authors": ["Kim Willsher"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc93e10ae59ccca949ee7a6163de7104d0d60d1c/0_823_5694_3416/master/5694.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=50e3709cd5aba92fb7a7453f0ef66c01", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
