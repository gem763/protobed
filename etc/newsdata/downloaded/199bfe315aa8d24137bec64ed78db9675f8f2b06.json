Some righty wanted attention and knew that an inflammatory attack on AOC is a cheap way to achieve that.\n\n2. AOC herself would notice and claim victimhood because that\u2019s half of her political shtick, the other half being theatrical defiance of the left\u2019s enemies.\n\n3. Allegations of racism/incitement/what have you would immediately begin flying because \u201ctacky\u201d just isn\u2019t a damning enough critique in 2019.\n\nHow\u2019d I do?\n\nRepublicans are running TV ads setting pictures of me on fire to convince people they aren\u2019t racist. Life is weird! \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) September 13, 2019\n\nKnow that this wasn\u2019t an ad for young conservatives of color \u2013 that was the pretense. What you just watched was a love letter to the GOP\u2019s white supremacist case. https://t.co/zvp1EB02c5 \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) September 13, 2019\n\nGOP\u2019s message: No policy, no facts, just displays of violence + corporations like @ABCNetwork & Sinclair who amplify them. They profit from burning my likeness on TV. But who pays for heightened security? Who answers the phones for the threats resulting from a violent, false ad? https://t.co/Gr1XhEbwDC \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) September 13, 2019\n\nExactly my thoughts. The mere act of burning her image is a display of violence. Folks need to stick to facts & policy positions. They need to stop fear mongering & more importantly demonizing members of Congress. FYI: No one puts her residents (and our planet) first, like @AOC https://t.co/K2Qz1N0PeN \u2014 Rashida Tlaib (@RashidaTlaib) September 13, 2019\n\nThe spot aired during a debate in which Democrats accused Trump of having \u201cdirected\u201d a mass murder last month in El Paso, notes Ben Shapiro, in case you\u2019re wondering how seriously to take the hand-wringing about incitement. (\u201cObviously he didn\u2019t pull the trigger, but he\u2019s certainly been tweeting out the ammunition,\u201d said Kamala Harris.) The person behind the spot isn\u2019t a white supremacist, she\u2019s a Cambodian-American named Elizabeth Heng who ran for Congress last year, lost, and has now started a PAC called New Faces GOP aimed at promoting young nonwhite Republicans. That may also explain the focus on Ocasio-Cortez \u2014 it\u2019s not just an easy way to grab eyeballs, it\u2019s a challenge to the most famous young (and nonwhite) leftist in the country.\n\nLefties are now trying to organize a boycott of ABC for airing the ad, which will flex AOC\u2019s muscles but also help Heng by martyring her on the right and calling even more attention to the ad. That was also predictable; I\u2019m embarrassed I didn\u2019t foresee it as step four in the inevitable fallout last night. What a perfect little episode of modern American politics, all wrapped up in just 18 hours or so.", "description": "\u201cThis is the face of socialism.
