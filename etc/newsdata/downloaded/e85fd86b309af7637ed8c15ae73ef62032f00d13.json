That mark didn't improve in the playoffs, with Houston's relievers posting a 5.40 mark.\n\nThat didn't matter, however, as a deep and talented lineup plus a strong starting rotation led the Astros to their first-ever World Series win.\n\nThis season, the starting staff is still loaded, and the batting order is one of the league's best.\n\nBut what makes the 2019 Astros this year's best team (and arguably one of the better ones all-time should they win the Fall Classic) is a stout and reliable bullpen.\n\nYes, closer Roberto Osuna nearly blew the game by allowing a game-tying two-run homer, but the Astros wouldn't have been in the position to win without their strong relief staff dominating for much of the night.\n\nBrad Peacock set the tone in the first inning by setting the Yanks down in order on just seven pitches, sending the already raucous Minute Maid crowd into a frenzy. That gave Houston a picture-perfect beginning, as Brian McTaggart of MLB.com noted:\n\nThat momentum only continued with Gurriel's shot to give Houston a 3-0 edge. The homer put the Astros in great historical position, per MLB Stats:\n\nPeacock didn't get through the second, but the path to the pennant continued with Josh James, who struck out Brett Gardner with runners on first and second.\n\nThen James labored through an inning, and he left the third with the bases loaded and two outs. But the Astros' train kept moving, and Ryan Pressly got shortstop Didi Gregorious on a groundout.\n\nHowever, Pressly immediately left the game with right knee discomfort, forcing manager AJ Hinch back to the bullpen.\n\nJose Urquidy was then called upon to eat the middle innings, and he did so while allowing just one run on a Gio Urshela solo shot.\n\nOnce again, an Astros reliever ran into trouble when Urquidy put two runners on with two outs. But they were left stranded again, as Will Harris got out of the inning.\n\nThe Astros largely coasted from there until the ninth thanks to Harris and Joe Smith. Osuna couldn't finish the job, but the relievers behind him gave Houston enough breathing room for Altuve to become the hero.\n\nNow Houston enters the World Series flying high against a Washington Nationals team it should be favored against.\n\nBoth rosters have great starting pitching and solid lineups, but the Astros' bullpen is deeper than that of the Nationals, who have relied heavily on Sean Doolittle, Daniel Hudson and starters to close the back end of games.\n\nHouston proved that it can throw seven relievers out there if needed, as it did on Saturday. That gives the Astros the edge in the Fall Classic.\n\nToo Little, Too Late for Yanks\n\nIn Greek mythology, Zeus punished Sisyphus and forced him to roll a boulder up a hill for eternity only to see it tumble at the peak.\n\nThat story represented the Yankees' ALCS.\n\nIn three of their four losses, the theme was the same: The Yankees fell behind in the early frames and were forced to play catchup.\n\nEach time, they made dents in the Astros' lead and provided hope they would come through.\n\nEach time, the Yankees did not do so, and the boulder rolled back down the hill.\n\nMore of the same occurred in Game 6 on four different plays.\n\nIn the third inning, the Yanks placed runners on first and second with one out when Aaron Hicks looked as though he smacked a three-run homer. The sweet swing played tricks on fans watching at home, however, as Hicks got under the ball for a long flyout.\n\nOne inning later, Brett Gardner hit a shot down the right field line that cleared the fence, but the ball tailed to the right and just foul.\n\nThe Yanks got two runners on again in the sixth with Didi Gregorius at the dish with one out, and he laced a liner into right field. But Josh Reddick caught the ball inches from the ground with a fantastic dive.\n\nIf one diving catch wasn't enough, Michael Brantley added to the Yanks' misery with one of his own in the seventh, and he doubled off Aaron Judge to boot:\n\nFormer Brooklyn Dodgers general manager Branch Rickey once called baseball a \"game of inches,\" and that sentiment couldn't have been more true for the Yankees this series.\n\nThe Bronx Bombers were on the right end of a close play in the ninth when LeMahieu's home run just barely cleared Springer's glove, but Jose Altuve left no doubt about his homer to send Houston to the Fall Classic.\n\nCredit to the Yankees for winning 103 games and making the ALCS despite seeing 30 players land on the injured list throughout the season, including staff ace Luis Severino and sluggers Aaron Judge and Giancarlo Stanton.\n\nBut the result is undoubtedly disappointing for the Yanks, who will exit the postseason at the hands of the eventual World Series winner for three straight years if Houston pulls through.\n\nWhat's Next?\n\nThe Astros will host the Washington Nationals for Game 1 of the World Series on Tuesday at 8:08 p.m. ET. Fox will televise the game.\n\nWashington, which swept the St. Louis Cardinals in four games to win the National League pennant, is making its first-ever World Series appearance.", "description": "Jose Altuve hit a walk-off two-run homer in the bottom of the ninth to send the Houston Astros to the World Series with a 6-4 win over the New York Yankees  in Game 6 of the American League Championship Series on Saturday at Minute Maid Park...", "authors": ["Paul Kasabian"], "top_image": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/834/052/hi-res-03e9c47307d5e37e106614a49be7ab27_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
