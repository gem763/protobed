And when choosing, make sure the pillow is made from a breathable fabric as your face will be breathing directly onto it during the night.\n\nWhat are the most common sleeping positions in Australia? * According to 55 per cent of Australians who took part in a survey commissioned by bedding specialists Ecosa, side sleeping is a preferred position. * Freestyle sleeping, a way of sleeping that's not fixed to any one position, was revealed as the second most popular with 23 per cent saying its their preferred sleeping style. * Back sleeping ranked as the third most popular with 15 per cent of those questioned saying it was their preferred position. * Data showed that just 6.7 per cent of participants who took part in the survey admitted to sleeping on their stomachs.

Memory foam is known for its ability to both conform to the shape of your head and support it. This prevents your head from sinking in too deeply like it would in a regular pillow. It's made to distribute weight evenly, avoiding unnecessary strain on the neck and spine. Source: Ecosa.com.au\n\nBack sleepers:\n\nBack sleeping isn't generally a highly ranked position, however, it's a sleeping style believed to be best for your back.\n\nMr Carter explained this method of sleeping supports the head and allows the spine to rest in a neutral position.\n\n'For anyone who sleeps this way on the regular, the thickness of your pillow is really important when buying new or upgrading,' he said.\n\nBack sleepers fare better with a pillow that's quite thin but offers enough elevation to keep your head slightly raised.\n\nA memory foam pillow is generally considered best for those who prefer this position as the material offers a consistent and comfortable level of support.", "description": "When it comes to getting a good night's sleep, choosing the correct pillow helps.
