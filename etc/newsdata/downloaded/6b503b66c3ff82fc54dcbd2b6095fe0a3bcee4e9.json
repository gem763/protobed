This makes the drug very difficult to test for.\n\nDr Chris Pudney, who came up with the idea, said: \u201cMy partner is a psychiatrist and she was telling me that currently they don\u2019t have a way to confirm when they suspect spice use, they just don\u2019t know for sure.\n\n(Image: University of Bath 2019)\n\n\u201cYou can test for it with a urine or blood sample that is sent off to a lab, but that takes a few days and so in most cases it\u2019s pointless.\n\n\u201cI started looking into the chemistry and it\u2019s actually similar to something we have developed for detection of biological molecules. We decided on saliva because it seemed tractable and less invasive than some other options.\u201d\n\nAt the moment, the test is just a prototype, but has sparked the interest of several drug charities and homeless charities, as well as the NHS .\n\n(Image: Julian Hamilton / Daily Mirror)\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nDr Jenny Scott, who also worked on the test, said: \u201cSpice can be used to \u2018zombify\u2019 people, escaping them from the reality in which they find themselves, making them highly vulnerable.\n\n\u201cTwo thirds of prison governors report concern about new psychoactive substances use in their prisons, including spice. Use of spice and other synthetic cannabinoids is estimated at about 10% amongst prisoners, and has placed a strain on emergency healthcare.\n\n\u201cOur collaborative research work with homeless people who use drugs has found spice is commonly taken by them also.\n\n\u201cDetection and confirmation of spice use early on when someone is found incoherent gives a chance to start timely treatment for their symptoms.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\n\u201cFurther down the line, we can foresee the kit being used as part of a care pathway that avoids the need to hospitalise some patients if appropriate healthcare can be given where they are.\u201d\n\nThe team hopes to start trialling the test with medical professionals within a year.\n\nDr Pudney added: \u201cWe\u2019ve proved the concept with a test that\u2019s simple and very accurate. The hardware is compact and portable and the results are easy to understand. We\u2019re working on software now, so that the user has a simple \u2018one click\u2019 way to use it.\u201d", "description": "The team hopes the saliva test, which takes just five minutes, could help to treat people suffering the horrible side effects of spice more quickly", "authors": ["Shivali Best", "Image", "University Of Bath", "Julian Hamilton", "Daily Mirror", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article8468825.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/GettyImages-483036588.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
