And I think that a lot of reporters were doing it to get famous. I mean, yeah, they\u2019re writing books now. I mean, they\u2019re all getting famous off of this presidency. And so, I think it's great what we're doing now.\u201d\n\nGrisham, who has rarely participated in on-camera interviews since becoming press secretary in June, praised her boss as \u201chis own best spokesperson\u201d and claimed he is \u201cthe most accessible president in history, as all of the media knows\u201d \u2014 citing Trump\u2019s frequent informal gaggles with the White House press corps.\n\nGrisham also suggested that reporters\u2019 criticisms of the president\u2019s previous press secretaries, Sean Spicer and Sarah Huckabee Sanders, played a role in Trump\u2019s decision to discontinue the briefings.\n\n\u201cI think that it\u2019s so important that, you know, the spokesperson for the president can adequately speak to his policies and get his message out there, and I think the president saw that that's not what was happening,\u201d she said. \u201cIt had become, again, theater, and they weren't being good to his people. And he doesn't like that. He\u2019s very loyal to his people, and he put a stop to it.\u201d\n\nSpicer was widely mocked for his combative and sometimes stumbling performances during the daily White House news briefings, which memorably became a subject of parody by actress Melissa McCarthy on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d\n\nSanders oversaw the end of the daily briefings amid mounting questions from journalists regarding her credibility. She opted to develop a regular presence on cable news programs, especially \"Fox & Friends,\" where she would bludgeon the president\u2019s detractors.\n\nGrisham has been largely reluctant to advocate on-air for the administration\u2019s priorities, but she weighed in Monday on the controversy surrounding Trump\u2019s summer conversation with Ukraine\u2019s president that is quickly consuming the White House and Capitol Hill.\n\n\"The president made it very clear he did absolutely nothing wrong. This is just another reason for Democrats and for the media to attack and look for things that just aren't there,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal initially reported on Friday that Trump urged newly elected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy roughly eight times during a July 25 phone call to work with Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s son.\n\nTrump confirmed Sunday that he discussed Biden, the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, during his call with Zelenskiy.\n\n\u201cThe conversation I had was largely congratulatory, was largely corruption, all of the corruption taking place,\u201d he told reporters outside the White House. \u201cWas largely the fact that we don\u2019t want our people, like Vice President Biden and his son, creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine.\u201d", "description": "Stephanie Grisham derided the on-camera sessions as \"theater.\"", "authors": ["Quint Forgey"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
