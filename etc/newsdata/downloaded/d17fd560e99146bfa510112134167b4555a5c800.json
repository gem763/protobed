The latest Mario Maker glitch that players have discovered allows creators to use every item in the game in every style, even if they\u2019re exclusive to the Super Mario 3D World variant.\n\nThe key to this glitch is \u201ccorrupting\u201d a level \u2014 that is, breaking it in such a way that causes Super Mario Maker 2\u2019s glitch-detection system to delete the stage automatically. This involves placing a question mark block, putting a track over the block, and attaching a coin to the track over the block. Removing the track forces the block and the coin to occupy the same space, which normally isn\u2019t possible. Players then need to place an item \u2014 the demo video below uses a clown car, but anything should do \u2014 so that it is pinned to the right-most space of the item bar at the top of the screen.\n\nUpon saving and loading this corrupted level, it will be auto-deleted and removed from Course Bot. From there, players must repeatedly make a new level until it opens with the Super Mario 3D World style (the Super Mario Maker 2 stage builder randomly starts in one of the five styles).\n\nNow, placing the item that was saved on the item bar will turn it into a \u201cconverted item,\u201d which will be invisible when placed into the level and take on the appearance of the item to its left in the item bar. All that\u2019s left is to pin a 3D World-exclusive item, like the blinking block, to the item bar in the same way that the clown car was pinned previously, save the level, wait for Course Bot to delete it, and then create a new stage in any style.\n\nIf these steps were followed correctly \u2014 believe me, it\u2019s a lot easier than it sounds \u2014 the active item upon starting a new level will be the one pinned from the Super Mario 3D World style. Depending on the item, it might be fully functional but invisible, crash the game, or simply not work as intended.\n\nFurthermore, some can be used but won\u2019t escape the Super Mario Maker 2 glitch-detection system, meaning they can\u2019t be saved or uploaded. It should also be noted that Nintendo has been very diligent about deleting uploaded levels, even those that don\u2019t include glitches, so it\u2019s likely that any levels utilising this item-swapping method won\u2019t survive online for very long either.\n\nWhile neat, this doesn\u2019t appear to have many practical applications outside of building frustrating troll levels. One cool idea, however, is to build clear pipes from Super Mario 3D World and overlay inert green pipes over them in other styles, making them appear to function in the same way with a visible indication of where folks will travel upon entering them.\n\nThat said, the Super Mario Maker 2 community is a creative bunch, especially when they find ways to shrug off Nintendo\u2019s restrictions. Let\u2019s just hope folks can check out any levels created with this glitch before they\u2019re inevitably removed from Nintendo servers.", "description": "Super Mario Maker 2 is an endlessly creative game, but things get even crazier when players incorporate glitches into their levels.
