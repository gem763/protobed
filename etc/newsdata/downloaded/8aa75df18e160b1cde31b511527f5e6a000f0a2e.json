Pence said Trump spoke directly to Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump communicated to him very clearly that the United States of American wants Turkey to stop the invasion, implement an immediate ceasefire and to begin to negotiate with Kurdish forces in Syria to bring an end to the violence,\u201d Pence said.\n\nThe Americans were scrambling for Syria\u2019s exits, a move criticized at home and abroad as opening the door to a resurgence of the Islamic State group whose violent takeover of Syrian and Iraq lands five years ago was the reason American forces came in the first place.\n\nTrump said the approximately 1,000 U.S. troops who had been partnering with local Kurdish fighters to battle IS in northern Syria are leaving the country. They will remain in the Middle East, he said, to \u201cmonitor the situation\u201d and to prevent a revival of IS \u2014 a goal that even Trump\u2019s allies say has become much harder as a result of the U.S. pullout.\n\nThe Turks began attacks in Syria last week against the Syrian Kurdish fighters, whom the Turks see as terrorists. On Monday, Syrian government troops moved north toward the border region, setting up a potential clash with Turkish-led forces.\n\nTrump said Turkey\u2019s invasion is \u201cprecipitating a humanitarian crisis and setting conditions for possible war crimes,\u201d a reference to reports of Turkish-backed fighters executing Kurdish fighters on the battlefield.\n\nThe Kurdish forces previously allied with the U.S. said they had reached a deal with President Bashar Assad\u2019s government to help them fend off Turkey\u2019s invasion, a move that brings Russian forces deeper into the conflict.\n\nIn his sanctions announcement, Trump said he was halting trade negotiations with Turkey and raising steel tariffs. He said he would soon sign an order permitting sanctions to be imposed on current and former Turkish officials.\n\n\u201cI am fully prepared to swiftly destroy Turkey\u2019s economy if Turkish leaders continue down this dangerous and destructive path,\u201d Trump said.\n\nAmerican troops consolidated their positions in northern Syria on Monday and prepared to evacuate equipment in advance of a full withdrawal , a U.S. defense official said.\n\nThe official, who was not authorized to be quoted by name, said U.S. officials were weighing options for a potential future counter-IS campaign, including the possibility of waging it with a combination of air power and special operations forces based outside of Syria, perhaps in Iraq.\n\nThe hurried preparations for a U.S. exit were triggered by Trump\u2019s decision Saturday to expand a limited troop pullout into a complete withdrawal.\n\nDefense Secretary Mark Esper said Monday he would travel to NATO headquarters in Brussels next week to urge European allies to impose \u201cdiplomatic and economic measures\u201d against Turkey \u2014 a fellow NATO ally \u2014 for what Esper called Ankara\u2019s \u201cegregious\u201d actions.\n\nEsper said Turkey\u2019s incursion had created unacceptable risk to U.S. forces in northern Syria and \u201cwe also are at risk of being engulfed in a broader conflict.\u201d\n\nThe only exception to the U.S. withdrawal from Syria is a group of perhaps 200 troops who will remain at a base called Tanf in southern Syria near the Jordanian border along the strategically important Baghdad-to-Damascus highway. Those troops work with Syrian opposition forces unrelated to the Kurdish-led fighters in northern Syria.\n\nEsper said the U.S. withdrawal would be done carefully to protect the troops and to ensure that no U.S. equipment was left behind. He declined to say how long that might take.\n\nIn a series of tweets Monday, Trump defended his gamble that pulling U.S. forces out of Syria would not weaken U.S. security and credibility. He took sarcastic swipes at critics who say his Syria withdrawal amounts to a betrayal of the Kurds and plays into the hands of Russia.\n\n\u201cAnyone who wants to assist Syria in protecting the Kurds is good with me, whether it is Russia, China, or Napoleon Bonaparte,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI hope they all do great, we are 7,000 miles away!\u201d\n\nTrump has dug in on his decision to pull out the troops, believing it fulfills a key campaign promise and will be a winning issue in the 2020 election, according to White House officials.\n\nThis has effectively ended a five-year effort to partner with Syrian Kurdish and Arab fighters to ensure a lasting defeat of the Islamic State group. Hundreds of IS supporters escaped a holding camp amid clashes between invading Turkish-led forces and Kurdish fighters, and analysts said an IS resurgence seemed more likely, just months after Trump declared the extremists defeated.\n\nRepublican Senate leader Mitch McConnell, normally a staunch Trump supporter, said he was \u201cgravely concerned\u201d by events in Syria and Trump\u2019s response so far.\n\nWithdrawing U.S. forces from Syria \u201cwould re-create the very conditions that we have worked hard to destroy and invite the resurgence of ISIS,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cAnd such a withdrawal would also create a broader power vacuum in Syria that will be exploited by Iran and Russia, a catastrophic outcome for the United States\u2019 strategic interests.\u201d\n\nHowever, Trump got quick support from Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who had lambasted his withdrawal decision last week as \u201cshortsighted,\u201d \u2018\u2019irresponsible\u201d and \u201cunnerving to its core.\u201d On Monday, echoing Trump, Graham said on Fox News Channel that the current situation was Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s fault and Turkey would face \u201ccrippling sanctions\u201d from the U.S. on its economy.\n\nPence said the sanctions announced Monday were only the beginning \u201cunless Turkey is willing to embrace a ceasefire, come to the negotiating table and end the violence.\u201d\n\nThe Kurds have turned to the Syrian government and Russia for military assistance, further complicating the battlefield.\n\nThe prospect of enhancing the Syrian government\u2019s position on the battlefield and inviting Russia to get more directly involved is seen by Trump\u2019s critics as a major mistake. But he tweeted that it shouldn\u2019t matter.\n\n\u201cOthers may want to come in and fight for one side or the other,\u201d he wrote. \u201cLet them!\u201d\n\nNew Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said Trump is weakening America. \u2018To be clear, this administration\u2019s chaotic and haphazard approach to policy by tweet is endangering the lives of U.S. troops and civilians,\u201d Menendez said in a statement.", "description": "Vice President Mike Pence says he\u2019s being dispatched to the Middle East by President Donald Trump as U.S. troops pull out of northeast Syria and Turkish...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT280_pence1_ZG_20191014182920.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
