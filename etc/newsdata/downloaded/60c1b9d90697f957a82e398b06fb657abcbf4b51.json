You can form your own view.

Even after that time traffic flows may reach only 50-70 per cent of current flow levels and delays could continue for \u201csignificantly longer\u201d;\n\nDisruption in the ports will cause \u201csignificant\u201d queues in Kent and other routes to France and will have an impact on the supply of medicines and medical supplies;\n\nThere will not be \u201can overall shortage of food\u201d in the UK, but the choice of products will reduce and prices increase. Low income groups will be \u201cdisproportionately affected by any price rises in food and fuel\u201d;\n\nShortages of chemicals could affect the supply of clean water to hundreds of thousands of people, requiring \u201curgent action\u201d, though the risk of this is rated \u201clow\u201d.\n\nShadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said: \u201cThese documents confirm the severe risks of a no-deal Brexit, which Labour has worked so hard to block. It is completely irresponsible for the government to have tried to ignore these stark warnings and prevent the public from seeing the evidence.\n\n\u201cBoris Johnson must now admit that he has been dishonest with the British people about the consequence of a no-deal Brexit. It is also now more important than ever that parliament is recalled and has the opportunity to scrutinise these documents and take all steps necessary to stop no-deal.\u201d\n\nAnd former justice secretary David Gauke \u2013 who was expelled from the Conservatives by Mr Johnson last week \u2013 said: \u201cIf anyone wondered why so many ministers in the last government are strongly opposed to a no-deal Brexit, read the Yellowhammer documents.\n\n\u201cBut the problems with no deal don\u2019t end with the short-term disruption. It\u2019s in the long term when the real damage will be done.\u201d\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Inside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

The leaked version of the passage warned that resulting strike action at refineries \u201cwould lead to disruptions to fuel availability for 1-2 weeks in the regions they directly supply\u201d.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

And panic buying at the pumps could also lead to shortages in other parts of the country.\n\nBusiness and holiday travellers could face increased immigration checks, with delays at Eurotunnel and Dover terminals, as well as at arrivals in EU ports and airports.\n\nAlthough energy supplies would not run out, there are likely to be \u201csignificant\u201d price hikes.\n\nUK citizens on the continent can be expected to lose the rights of EU nationals, with a \u201cmixed picture\u201d on how each of the 27 member states will treat them, warns the Yellowhammer document. Rights to healthcare for UK state pensioners and tourists in EU states will stop abruptly on 1 November, requiring additional insurance in some cases. A minority of Britons falling ill abroad could face \u201csubstantial\u201d costs.\n\nUp to 282 EU and EEA fishing vessels could enter UK waters illegally on day one, causing \u201canger and frustration\u201d among British fishermen which could lead to \u201cclashes\u201d between boats. Pressures on the authorities may put at risk their ability to deal with illegal fishing, smuggling and illegal migration, violent disputes or blockading of ports.\n\nAn expected increase in inflation could \u201csignificantly\u201d affect adult social care providers and lead to companies failing over the six months after Brexit. Providers\u2019 resources could be stretched by disruption affecting staff and transport.\n\nSome cross-border financial services will be disrupted, as will the flow of personal data between the UK and the remaining EU. Data and information sharing between law enforcement agencies will be reduced.\n\nGibraltar will see disruption to supplies of goods, food and medicine and delays of four hours or more for workers and travellers crossing the border into Spain, adversely affecting its economy.", "description": "Official assessments forced out of the government by MPs have confirmed doomsday warnings of the impact of a no-deal Brexit which ministers dismissed as outdated only weeks ago.
