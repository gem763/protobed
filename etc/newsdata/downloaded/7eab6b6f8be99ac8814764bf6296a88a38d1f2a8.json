I don't think so, I never had been before.\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\n\"And being ginger is not the best thing in the world... I did [hate] it [red hair] when I was your age but now I'm a bit older, it's not so bad. And at least it's become slightly cool with Harry Potter and Ron Weasley.\"\n\nCharlie said while she's not in shape, gardening has helped maintain her fitness levels because she has good stamina.\n\nHowever, the gardening guru did say she wasn't the \"most agile of people\" anymore.\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\nShe added: \"Have you seen me? I'm not in shape! But gardening keeps me fit... I've got stamina but I wouldn't say I'm the most agile of people these days.\"\n\nCharlie was catapulted into the limelight on BBC garden makeover programme Garden Force.\n\nThe BBC show aired from 1997 until 2005; Charlie starred alongside Alan Titchmarsh and Tommy Walsh in 1997.\n\nThe beauty courted attention when she would go braless in her skimpy ensembles.\n\nPreviously, Charlie voiced her concerns she would never get rid of the \"bra-less\" tag.\n\nShe said: \"It was all very silly. I remember Esther Rantzen said to me, 'You'll be referred to as the bra-less one for the rest of your life. I'm still referred to as the buck-toothed presenter of That's Life',\" she said in 2014.\n\n\"People still comment on it to me. Some of them are male fans, some of them are female.\n\n\"It is sometimes just more comfortable not having a bra on. I didn't plan it.\"", "description": "The green-fingered TV presenter admitted she didn't ever consider herself a sex symbol in her TV heyday", "authors": ["Lily Waddell", "Image", "Bbc"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20536629.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_EHP_CHP_081019CHARLIE-DIMMOCK_5538JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
