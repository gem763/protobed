But to us, it\u2019s long-overdue counterpunching right into the progs\u2019 soft gut. (Note: The author knows some of the conservatives allegedly involved, but was not involved in this glorious initiative).\n\nThis is righteous retribution, and the screaming and hollering about it is further evidence that there\u2019s plenty of dirt to dig up.\n\nWelcome to Accountability City. Population: All you liberal media jerks.\n\nFor years, these pompous hacks have clobbered ordinary folks whose only \u201ccrime\u201d is making fun of Obama at a rodeo, or making a funny meme about liberals, or understanding that there are only two genders. They pored over the social media accounts of lesser mortals, highlighting thought crimes and sometimes thoughtlessness with malignant glee. They tried to teach us rubes the lesson that disobedience and defiance bring cancellation. They took normal people and hauled them up onto the Aztec altar of human sacrifice to have their beating hearts cut out to appease the demon demi-gods of wokeness.\n\nTake that, grandmother who likes Trump on Facebook.\n\nTake that, random congressional staffer who gets snarky about the Obama girls\u2019 partying.\n\nTake that, restaurant that supports candidates the Santa Monica swells dislike.\n\nTake that, kid who stands there while some Frigidaireborne ranger veteran of Dick Blumenthal\u2019s platoon in \u2018Nam channels Elizabeth Warren by pounding a drum.\n\nAnd now these media cretins are stunned \u2013 stunned, I say \u2013 at the fact that these new rules they created are going to be applied as a suppository of justice right back at \u2018em.\n\n\u201cThis is terrible!\u201d they fume, outraged that the very same standard of transparency that they wish to apply to their enemies is getting applied to them, too. It\u2019s vitally important that the preferences and positions of ordinary citizens can be publicly exposed so liberal bully boyz and bully girlz and non-gender conforming bullyz can harass, assault and intimidate their victims into submission.\n\nYet, it\u2019s also vitally important that the racist, homophobic and otherwise obnoxious ravings of our alleged betters remain hidden because\u2026\n\nBecause\u2026\n\nWell, just because.\n\nYou know, there\u2019s an undeniable satisfaction to be had from Alinskying these weasels, in taking the New Rules they pioneered and ramming them down these lefty punks\u2019 collective collectivist throat. After all, we\u2019ve been warning them for years that the idea of a two-track system of social accountability \u2013 one where there\u2019s one set of rules for the elite and another for us Normals \u2013 is totally unsustainable. But to point out that these are new rules is almost beside the point.\n\nTo our elite, there are no rules, at least not for them. The concept of rules is simply inapplicable to them. There are rules for us Normals \u2013 how else would they be able to hold onto their prestige, power and sinecures if not for a complex web of formal and informal social regulations designed to keep us in thrall and leave them unaccountable for their myriad failures? No, there are no rules for them. Rules are limitations. Rules create obstacles. Rules limit the ability to do as one pleases. The will of the elite is justification enough; rules are actually immoral when applied to our betters because rules might foil our betters from fully exercising their better natures to Normals\u2019 disadvantage.\n\nExcept we\u2019re not playing that.\n\nNot anymore.\n\nWhat\u2019s notable about the fallout from this revelation is how few conservatives wimped out with the kind of Fredocon bleating about how this is not who we are and we\u2019re better than that. Even formerly squishy conservatives are no longer being sissies about getting their hands dirty pummeling leftist jerks in the public arena. Sure, some of the Ahoy Boyz on Joe Walsh\u2019s campaign team probably fussed about it, but no one reads their crappy cruise brochure so how would we know? The rest of conservatism is unified through the magic of hysterical laughter.\n\nConservative wokeness is spreading.\n\nSee, the media\u2019s \u201cBut we\u2019re a bunch of neutral truthtellers dedicated to the truth and to telling it!\u201d act just got to be too much. You can\u2019t have all the respect and deference an objective news monk might deserve yet still get to act like an active partisan. Dinner is not all dessert \u2013 you gotta eat your vegetables, too, and the broccoli is you not inserting your personal opinions into the news. The ice cream sundae is you being respected as unbiased. You gotta gobble your veggies, but they don\u2019t want to.\n\nThe NYT\u2019s leaked transcript from a few weeks ago wrecked any chance of anyone falling for their \u201cAll The News That\u2019s Fit To Print\u201d baloney again \u2013 when the scribblers are hassling their editor because the paper isn\u2019t calling Trump \u201cracist\u201d often enough, you\u2019ve Old Yeller\u2019d objectivity. When you openly plan to replace American history with a garbage narrative designed to undermine the moral foundation of its citizenry\u2019s right to self-government in order to solidify your own caste\u2019s hold on power, you\u2019ve chosen a side in the Octagon, so don\u2019t be shocked if someone figuratively busts a chair over your skull.\n\nOh well.\n\nYou media hacks chose a side, and now you\u2019re going to be treated like anyone else who chose a side. Sometimes, it hurts. The thing is, we conservatives are used to it. We can take it. But you\u2019re not. You\u2019re soft, and weak, and when you get hit it\u2019s going to hurt bad.\n\nToo bad.\n\nYour suffering shall be glorious.\n\nOur mainstream media is garbage and if you want to read a vivid account of what happens if the left establishes the dictatorship our media dreams of in the ruins of the blue states, check out my action-packed yet hilarious novels, People's Republic, Indian Country and Wildfire. After liberals become unbearable, the United States splits into red and blue countries and antics ensue. The Never Trump losers hate my books and tried to label them \u201cAppalling,\u201d so you know they\u2019re good!", "description": "You must have a heart of stone not to burst .09/02/2019 3:00:05AM EST.", "authors": ["Kurt", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2017/56/1e77a335-8e82-4c2f-9a7d-ba54b80a6a3b.jpg"}
