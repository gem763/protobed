Canada are without a win in their last 10 World Cup matches.\n\nThe cancellation means that only one game was held at the Kamaishi Recovery Memorial Stadium \u2014 Uruguay\u2019s stunning, 30-27 upset of Fiji in Pool D.\n\nThe stadium, the only purpose-built venue at the World Cup, was built on the site of a school which was the scene for the \u201cMiracle of Kamaishi\u201d, when more than 400 children sprinted into the mountains to safety.\n\n\u201cOur hearts go out to the teams and also their fans, but also the people of Kamaishi, who have been incredible during what has been a special journey in recent years,\u201d said Gilpin.\n\n\u201cNobody will be more disappointed than them, but also nobody would have better empathy with the decision.\u201d\n\nOrganisers said fans should not travel to the stadium, which will be closed, and they would be entitled to a full refund.\n\nThere have been landslides and flooding in the vicinity of the stadium and along access roads to the venue following torrential rain throughout the night, organisers said in a statement.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Detailed inspections\u2019 \u2013\n\nAll eyes are now on whether the do-or-die match between hosts Japan and Scotland in Yokohama will go ahead.\n\nDetailed venue inspections at Hanazono and Yokohama are currently underway, and an update will be published when that important process has been completed, World Rugby said in a statement.\n\nThe Japan-Scotland game has become the subject of an ugly war of words, with the Scots threatening legal action if it is not played.\n\nIf the match were cancelled, it would be awarded as a 0-0 draw \u2014 sending the Scots home and Japan through to their first quarter-final.\n\nHagibis made landfall on Saturday evening and barrelled across the country, bringing fierce winds and torrential rain.\n\nIt was a direct hit on Tokyo and Yokohama, a city of some three million just south of the capital.\n\nAcross the country, at least three people died and several others were injured or reported missing due to the storm, which brought \u201cunprecedented\u201d amounts of rain to the country.\n\nSevere flooding has already taken place with many rivers breaking their banks, including the Tama River which runs through Tokyo.\n\nOrganisers have come in for hefty criticism for cancelling two matches planned for Saturday \u2014 England vs France and New Zealand vs Italy.\n\nIt was the first time in the 32-year history of the Rugby World Cup that a match has been cancelled and fuelled criticism of tournament organisers for hosting it in Japan during typhoon season.\n\nHowever, organisers said that despite a \u201crobust\u201d contingency plan, the scale of Hagibis, which covered practically the entire country, meant it was unsafe and impractical to move those matches to another venue.", "description": "Tokyo (AFP) \u2013 Rugby World Cup organisers on Sunday announced the cancellation of the match between Namibia and Canada due to Typhoon Hagibis but", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/12/1af884_typhoon-hagibis-brought-unprecedented-rain-large-parts-japan-rugby-world-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
