They rewrite their own history.\"\n\nHirtle pointed to the 2013 referendum in the Falklands where 99.8 percent of islanders voted to remain British.\n\nOf the 1,517 voters, only three said 'No', while one ballot was invalid.\n\n\"In Argentina, I'm sure there are plenty of people who'd like to see an island have their own freedom and the right to their own self determination, but there are other people who don't want that,\" said Sally Heathman, 25, a communications and media assistant for the Falkland Islands government.\n\nBritain has claimed the Falklands since settling the West island in 1765, while Argentina says it inherited the archipelago from former colonial power Spain, which invoked sovereignty in 1767 after purchasing a French settlement on the East island.\n\n- 'Saber rattling' -\n\nUnder Kirchner, South America's third biggest economy made threatening noises regarding the Falklands' main link with the outside world: their weekly flight to and from Chile's capital Santiago, which uses Argentine airspace.\n\nWith a second weekly flight from Sao Paulo in Brazil due to begin in November, a change of administration in Buenos Aires could put that at risk.\n\n\"I wouldn't be at all surprised if there was ... a problem with the second flight,\" said Keith Heathman, 76, a driver for Battlefield Tours.\n\nThe flight from Santiago, through Punta Arenas on Chile's southern tip, is operated by LATAM, which will organize the Sao Paulo fight.\n\nSally Ellis, 48, is the Falklands agent for LATAM and says the Chilean-based company won't allow any mention of the islands in its inflight magazine.\n\nShe said in the past there has been pressure to stop the flight but branded it \"saber rattling.\"\n\nMany Argentines, such as 50-year-old Walter Goncalves, visit the Falklands to pay their respects at the Argentine cemetery near Darwin.\n\nGoncalves braved the biting cold, wind, sleet and snow to hike key battlegrounds such as Mounts Longdon, Tumbledown and Two Sisters.\n\n\"I didn't want to die without seeing them,\" he told AFP.\n\n\"Malvinas is a battle that isn't over for an Argentine,\" he said.\n\n\"It's a battle in which an Argentine will always try to have them recognized as Argentine, because they are Argentine.\"\n\nOnce a month, the Santiago flight stops off in Rio Gallegos in Argentine Patagonia, while the new Sao Paulo flight is due for a monthly stop in Cordoba -- Argentina's second biggest city.\n\n\"It would be cutting off their nose to spite their face,\" if Argentina impeded those flights, said Ellis.\n\n- 'They asked for a bribe' -\n\nSome, though, fear for the future if the liberal, market-friendly Macri loses the election.\n\nAustralian Darrel Day, who runs an adventure tourism company out of Stanley, said that under the Kirchner administration he had a yacht seized in Argentina and had to pay a $186,000 bond in cash to release it.\n\n\"They openly asked for a bribe,\" said the 49-year-old. \"Macri got on top of the corruption. Dealing with Aduana (Argentine customs) is a lot easier\" now.\n\n\"That's why I'm so worried about\" Fernandez winning the election.\n\nFalkland Islanders are a resilient bunch, though, and know how to manage hardship.\n\nOccasionally the boat carrying food supplies is delayed due to bad weather.\n\n\"You're running a bit low on your food stores and you think: oh it's OK, I can get it from a tin or there's meat in the freezer or something along those lines,\" said Sally Heathman.", "description": "Argentina is going to the polls on October 27 with a Peronist politician backed by former president Cristina Kirchner expected to win an outright majority, something that has got Falkland Islanders worried.
