Schiff of California, learned about the outlines of a C.I.A. officer\u2019s concerns that President Trump had abused his power days before the officer filed a whistle-blower complaint, according to a spokesman and current and former American officials.\n\nThe early account by the future whistle-blower shows how determined he was to make known his allegations that Mr. Trump asked Ukraine\u2019s government to interfere on his behalf in the 2020 election. It also explains how Mr. Schiff knew to press for the complaint when the Trump administration initially blocked lawmakers from seeing it.\n\nThe C.I.A. officer approached a House Intelligence Committee aide with his concerns about Mr. Trump only after he had had a colleague first convey them to the C.I.A.\u2019s top lawyer. Concerned about how that initial avenue for airing his allegations through the C.I.A. was unfolding, the officer then approached the House aide. In both cases, the original accusation was vague.\n\nThe House staff member, following the committee\u2019s procedures, suggested the officer find a lawyer to advise him and meet with an inspector general, with whom he could file a whistle-blower complaint. The aide shared some of what the officer conveyed to Mr. Schiff. The aide did not share the whistle-blower\u2019s identity with Mr. Schiff, an official said.", "description": "Days before filing a whistle-blower complaint, a C.I.A. officer brought a vague version of his accusations to an aide on the House Intelligence Committee.", "authors": ["Julian E.
