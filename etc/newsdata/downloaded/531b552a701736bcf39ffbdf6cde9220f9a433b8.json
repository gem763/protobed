Here we chart its feathered history\n\nFierce triumvirate of pop \u2013 Miley Cyrus, Ariana Grande and Lana Del Rey \u2013 pull out all the stops in the video for Don\u2019t Call Me Angel. It has all the aesthetics of a classic pop video \u2013 a boxing ring \u00e0 la Christina Aguilera\u2019s Dirrty, a room full of futuristic computers, a grape buffet - but most importantly, there are three pairs of wings, adorned by its three stars.\n\nWhile Destiny\u2019s Child were distinctly wing-free in the video for their Charlie\u2019s Angels theme Independent Women Pt 1, and Pink shunned it in her Charlie\u2019s Angels: Full Throttle track, the William Orbit-fuelled Feel Good Time, the fluttering trope has appeared throughout pop\u2019s history. It is multifaceted, too: the wing motif is not only utilised when the artist hopes to convey innocence, earnestness or the afterlife, but a new generation has realised you can sport the angelic accessories and still look hard. To pay tribute to the feathered friend, here\u2019s a rundown of some of pop\u2019s finest wing moments.\n\nMariah Carey\u2019s Butterfly wings\n\nThe elusive musician missed an opportunity when she used galloping horses instead of be-winged caterpillars in her Butterfly video, but she has certainly milked the imagery since then. Mimi reached her wing-based peak when she brought out a soft drink called Butterfly, described as \u201ca melodic beverage inspired by the magic of Mariah Carey\u201d. Yes, really.\n\nPaul McCartney\u2019s Wings\n\nLegend has it that Macca came up with the band name Wings as Stella McCartney was born. Hailed by Alan Partridge as \u201cthe band the Beatles could have been\u201d, but lambasted by Paul McCartney as \u201cterrible\u201d, who can argue with the majesty of Jet?\n\nMarilyn Manson\u2019s goth wings\n\nJust plain scary. See also: Adam Lambert, David Bowie\u2019s skeletal disco wings that lit up the Glass Spider tour.\n\nWestlife: Flying Without Wings\n\nIf muscle tops made a man fly, then the bestooled boyband would be soaring in the video for their 1999 MOR ballad.\n\nKanye West: Grammys, with wings\n\nYeezy went full angel at the 2005 Grammys, slipping into a pair of feathery numbers mid-Jesus Walks. Oh, of course he did. It\u2019s lucky he created the heavenly diversion or it would have been remembered as the year that Maroon 5 beat him to best new artist.\n\nMiley Cyrus: Can\u2019t Be Tamed wings\n\nDon\u2019t Call Me Angel is not Cyrus\u2019s first dalliance with wings in a music video. She wore a huge pair of flappers in her clip for Can\u2019t Be Tamed, taking the metaphor even further by cavorting in a birdcage and pole-dancing in a cage. A bit like Rachel Stevens gone bad.\n\nLady Gaga: serial flapper\n\nMother Monster debuted a hint of wing in the Born This Way video, went minimalist angel in Applause and unleashed the full feather at 2016\u2019s Victoria\u2019s Secret catwalk show. She even forced her piano to wear them at the 2018 Grammys.\n\nLittle Mix: Wings\n\nLittle Mix added to pop\u2019s wing-based canon with their 2012 hit. In its video, however, it seemed that budget stretched to headgear, chairs and dancers, but no literal wings, just the metaphorical kind.\n\nHarry Styles: Sign of the Times\u2019 wings\n\nWho needs wings when you\u2019ve got a voluminous coat? Styles achieved the Westlife-like feat of flying without wings in his video. He also walked on water, so there might have been a little camera trickery involved. Or strings, like on the early Steps tours, when H would fly over the audience like a freshly shaven Jesus.\n\nBillie Eilish: emo wings\n\nEilish appeared to sprout actual wings for her All the Good Girls Go to Hell video and chucked in actual tar and fire.\n\nKaty Perry: going large\n\nIf Grande, Cyrus and Del Ray thought they were impressing fans with their modest wings, they obviously hadn\u2019t seen photos of Katy Perry at the 2018 Met Gala. Never knowingly understated, K-Pez added the added feathery accessories to her gold Versace dress and nearly knocked someone out.
