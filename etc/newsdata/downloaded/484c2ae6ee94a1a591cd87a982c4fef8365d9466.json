The Company believes that non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted operating income and free cash flow provide a meaningful perspective on its business results as the Company utilizes this information to evaluate and manage the business. We use adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EPS, adjusted net/operating income, adjusted tax rate and adjusted interest expense to exclude the impact of non-operating items, such as amortization expense, taxes, acquisition and integration expenses, and non-core operating losses to aid investors in better understanding our core performance results. We use free cash flow to represent the cash generated after capital expenditures to maintain our business. We present constant currency information, such as organic revenue, to help assess how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations to aid investors in better understanding our international operational performance.\n\nOur non-GAAP disclosure has limitations as an analytical tool, should not be viewed as a substitute for financial information determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP, nor is it necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies.\n\nWhen we provide our long term projections for organic revenue growth, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted operating margin and free cash flow on a forward-looking basis, the closest corresponding GAAP measure and a reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP expectation and the corresponding GAAP measure generally is not available without unreasonable effort due to the length, high variability, complexity and low visibility associated with the non-GAAP expectation projected against the multi-year forecast which could significantly impact the GAAP measure.\n\nView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20191014005175/en/\n\nContacts\n\nInvestor Contact:\n\nWill Gabrielski\n\nVice President, Investor Relations\n\n213.593.8208\n\nWilliam.Gabrielski@aecom.com\n\nMedia Contact:\n\nBrendan Ranson-Walsh\n\nVice President, Global Communications & Corporate Responsibility\n\n213.996.2367\n\nBrendan.Ranson-Walsh@aecom.com", "description": "The sale of the Management Services business at an 11.6x multiple of EBITDA represents a material premium to AECOM\u2019s valuation and provides substantial capital for debt reduction and stock repurchases.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
