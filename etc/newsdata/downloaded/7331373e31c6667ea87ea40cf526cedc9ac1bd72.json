Boko is backed by former president Ian Khama, who handed over to Masisi last year but has since fallen into a bitter power struggle with him.\n\n\u201cI hope the people of Botswana ... will rewrite the history of this country, will write a different script for the economy,\u201d Boko said after voting in Gaborone, the capital. \u201cIt is an epic moment.\u201d\n\nIn the run up to the poll, he warned he would reject any results tainted by fraud, raising the specter that Botswana, which has only known one-sided elections, could witness its first rancorous dispute over a tight result.\n\nOf Botswana\u2019s population of 2.2 million people, 924,000 registered voters will elect 57 national assembly and 490 local government representatives.\n\nThe winning party\u2019s candidate then becomes president.\n\nPolls opened at 6:30 a.m. (0430 GMT) and close at 7 p.m.\n\nMasisi is standing on his record on tackling corruption, such as making a declaration of assets obligatory for public sector officials, and slashing bureaucracy for small businesses.\n\n\u201cWe are going to ... tackle the challenges that the country is facing ... improving the value chain of our national products whether it\u2019s in tourism or minerals,\u201d Masisi said after voting in his home village of Moshupa. \u201cThis will help us achieve our goal of migrating toward a high-income country.\u201d\n\nKhama, the son of founding president Seretse Khama, quarreled with Masisi over cabinet posts and the new president\u2019s controversial scrapping of an elephant hunting ban in May, which Khama had enforced four years earlier. Elephants, however, have not been an issue during the campaign.\n\nThe main concerns for the Batswana are unemployment at around 20% and stark inequalities despite equitable state spending on health and education. To tackle either, the winner will need to do more to diversify the economy.\n\nMbakisi Gopolang, 25, waiting to vote at a primary school in Gaborone, said he was disappointed by the BDP.\n\n\u201cThe last ten years have been regressive, so I don\u2019t want continuation of that. I am voting for a party that will drive economic growth, empower citizens and get rid of corruption and bring about transparency,\u201d he said.\n\nDiamond mining fell to a fifth of GDP in 2018, compared with half in the 1990s, but it still makes up three quarters of foreign exchange earnings, even as banking and tourism command a greater share of output.", "description": "Botswana voted on Wednesday in a general election that is expected to provide the first genuine challenge to the ruling Botswana Democratic Party (BDP) in its five decades of dominance over southern Africa's wealthiest and most stable nation.", "authors": ["Brian Benza", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
