Pivot, which has a market value of about $43 million, was issued a U.S. patent on Smart Edge's technology in July.\n\nIntel, which expects to close the Smart Edge deal in the fourth quarter, views 5G as a chance to expand its sales beyond personal computers and data centers, its two largest business segments.\n\nIn 5G networks, more data will be stored on computers scattered near cell towers and other network gear. Storing the data there, a practice called \"edge computing\" in the industry, is expected to help large files like videos show up more quickly on users' screens than if they were stored in centralized data centers.\n\n\"We plan to take full advantage of our combined technologies and teams to accelerate the development of the edge computing market,\" Dan Rodriguez, a general manager of the network compute division in Intel's data center group, said in a statement.\n\nIntel's shares rose nearly 1% to $52.15 in morning trade, while of Pivot Technology stock gained 4.9% to C$0.70.", "description": "US chipmaker Intel is buying Smart Edge from Toronto-based Pivot Technology Solutions.", "authors": ["Stephen Nellis"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da6ddea4af90976846563c3?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
