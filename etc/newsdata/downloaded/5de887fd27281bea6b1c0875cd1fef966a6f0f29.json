Japan will progress as Pool A winners if they beat Scotland on Sunday - that's for definite. If Japan lost to Scotland and Ireland beat Samoa with a bonus point, then Ireland will top the pool.\n\nIreland will qualify whatever happens if they can get a bonus-point win against Samoa on Saturday. Assuming Scotland get a bonus-point win against Russia on Wednesday, they will go through at Japan's expense - on head-to-head - if they beat the hosts in Yokohama and deny them a losing bonus point.\n\nIf Japan get a losing bonus point against Scotland, moving to 15 points, Scotland would have to get a winning bonus point to go through (on head-to-head). If Japan get a losing bonus point and a four-try bonus point (to move to 16 points) there is nothing Scotland can do even if they win both of their remaining matches with bonus points.", "description": "As the Rugby World Cup pool stages head towards a thrilling finale on Sunday October 13, Telegraph Sport casts an eye over the goings-on in each pool.", "authors": ["Telegraph Sport", "Brian Moore"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/rugby-world-cup/2019/10/08/TELEMMGLPICT000211823642-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqcyG6LyhsS63JuUbUYhnXPScFQDNsFZP_t3eNHHRB7oE.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
