(Was this email forwarded to you? Sign up here.)\n\nA showdown looms over WeWork\u2019s top job\n\nSome directors and large investors in WeWork \u2014 including the company\u2019s biggest backer, SoftBank \u2014 are discussing whether and how to oust its co-founder Adam Neumann as C.E.O., the NYT reports. But Mr. Neumann doesn\u2019t want to go, setting up a potential boardroom battle for the ages.\n\nThe discussions arose after some big money managers refused to invest in WeWork unless the company brought in an experienced operator, according to the NYT. Their reluctance to take part in WeWork\u2019s I.P.O. led the company to postpone the stock offering \u2014 even after reducing its valuation to as low as $15 billion, from $47 billion.\n\nHaving SoftBank on board for any insurrection is key. The Japanese tech giant has invested over $10.5 billion in WeWork. While SoftBank has tried to cultivate an image of supporting entrepreneurs, defending Mr. Neumann has become harder.\n\nOusting Mr. Neumann could be tricky, since he controls the company through a special class of shares. The WSJ notes that he could replace the entire board \u2014 though that would be a hugely risky move unlikely to ease investors\u2019 concerns over the company\u2019s stability.", "description": "DealBook Briefing: Some directors and large investors in the company, including SoftBank, want Adam Neumann out as C.E.O.
