Now, CEO Tim Cook tries to explain why they were right to ban an app released in aid of protestors.\n\nImages courtesy: Reuters\n\nApple had initially rejected HKmap.liv from the App Store earlier this month. It's a crowdsourced mapping app that uses data submitted by users to populate information about live events. The iPhone maker eventually changed its mind and allowed the app, which Hong Kong residents were using to mark the location of police garrisons.\n\nThen Apple turned heel again and banned the app permanently, apparently under Chinese pressure. People in Hong Kong and elsewhere were incensed by not only the biased decision, but also the fact that Apple was effectively helping a government subjugate civilians.\n\nNow, an internal email from within Apple has emerged, where Tim Cook addresses employees about the issue. He claims it was being misused in ways that would threaten the police, as well as the general public.\n\nDon't Miss 752 SHARES 465 SHARES\n\n\"The app in question allowed for the crowdsourced reporting and mapping of police checkpoints, protest hotspots, and other information,\" Cook wrote. \"On its own, this information is benign. However, over the past several days we received credible information, from the Hong Kong Cybersecurity and Technology Crime Bureau, as well as from users in Hong Kong, that the app was being used maliciously to target individual officers for violence and to victimize individuals and property where no police are present.\"\n\nOf course, Cook doesn't offer any specifics as far as these \"incidents\" are concerned. It's certainly a scary thought, but ultimately one that doesn't hold much water, given that HKmap.ive marked where protests were and police gatherings, not locations with a lack of them as implied. In fact the only people reporting the latter are Chinese state-run media.\n\nApple has been on the receiving end of harsh criticism concerning the decision, but has made no implications it may reverse it. For now, the app at least continues to function for the people in Hong Kong that already have it, but it can't be downloaded anymore.", "description": "Apple has been on the receiving end of harsh criticism across the world lately for kowtowing to Chinese demands surrounding the protests in Hong Kong.
