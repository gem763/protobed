Thankfully we haven\u2019t seen any of the truly horrific fires like the ones that hit the Golden State in the past couple of years, but conditions are tenuous. This has led Pacific Gas & Electric to once again shut off power to certain hazardous areas where high winds are expected.\n\nThis week, Governor Gavin Newsom was in Oakland and was asked about this issue by a reporter. His response? People \u201cshould be outraged\u201d and \u201cinfuriated.\u201d (CBS San Francisco)\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom said in Oakland on Tuesday that the estimated 800,000 customers across California who will be affected by a Public Safety Power Shutoff by PG&E starting on Wednesday should be \u201coutraged\u201d and \u201cinfuriated.\u201d The utility is planning the shut-off as a precaution due to high wildfire risk. But Newsom, who spoke to reporters after he signed a rent cap measure at the West Oakland Senior Center, said the power shutoff \u201cwas anticipated many months ago and this is the (utility) industry\u2019s best practice.\u201d\n\nSo people should be outraged and infuriated at PG&E. Okay, Governor. But notice how quickly he turned around and provided every reason imaginable for people not to be outraged or infuriated. He started by saying that the power outages were predicted months ago and they are a \u201cbest practice\u201d for the utility.\n\nBut he didn\u2019t stop there. One Newsom got started it was as if he couldn\u2019t find the off switch for his mouth. He went on to describe the \u201cintense winds and low humidity\u201d that lead to potential wildfires if power lines come down. He then seemed to defend the utility company, saying the power outages were \u201cbased on their determination of what\u2019s in the best interest of their customers in partnership and consultation with the Office of Emergency Services, CalFire and experts in this field.\u201d\n\nFinally, he finished off with a statement saying that power outages had to do with \u201cpublic safety and saving lives.\u201d\n\nWait a minute, here. Weren\u2019t people supposed to be outraged and infuriated? You know, because PG&E is trying to ensure public safety and save lives?\n\nKeep in mind the other reason that PG&E is doing this. It\u2019s because when they didn\u2019t shut off everyone\u2019s power and some fires broke out from downed power lines, they were sued by individuals and fined by the government to the point where they had to file for bankruptcy last January. One more round of financial hits like that and there won\u2019t be a utility company to keep the lights on. (Literally) So, of course, they\u2019re going to kill the power until they can upgrade the grid.\n\nThe worst part is that downed power lines may indeed have been responsible for some of the fires, but humans caused more of them, along with lightning strikes and acts of God. There will be more fires anyway. The only difference is people won\u2019t have any power so they probably won\u2019t catch the warnings on television.", "description": "... about this situation we helped cause", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/newsom.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
