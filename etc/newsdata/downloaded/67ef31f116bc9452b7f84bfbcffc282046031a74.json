But with passenger numbers forecast to double by 2037, experts say emissions will rise if more is not done.\n\nIn 2016, ICAO brokered the first global industrial climate initiative with a medium-term scheme to help airlines avoid adding to their net emissions from 2020.\n\nThe Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation requires most airlines to limit emissions or offset them by purchasing credits from environmental projects.\n\nIndustry says around $40 billion in climate financing will be generated between 2020 and 2035.\n\nEurope, environmentalists and the industry itself, want ICAO to commit now to setting longer-term goals at its 2022 assembly.\n\n\u201cDuring the ICAO assembly, we will join with our industry partners to call for a significant and ambitious long-term target for CO2 reduction,\u201d said Angela Gittens, director general of Airports Council International.", "description": "Teenage activist Greta Thunberg, who inspired a \"flight-shaming\" movement against air travel, is spearheading a climate change strike on Friday in Montreal where U.N. aviation leaders are gathering to debate plane emission targets.", "authors": ["Allison Lampert", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190927&t=2&i=1434426014&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8Q0BF", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
