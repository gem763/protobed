HBO did not confirm the news.\n\nAs many as five \"Thrones\" successor series have been put into early stages of development by HBO, but before Tuesday's announcement only the reportedly scrapped Watts pilot had entered production, and none had received a full series order.\n\n\u00a9 2019 AFP", "description": "A prequel series to global TV phenomenon \"Game of Thrones\" has been ordered, WarnerMedia announced Tuesday, as it set out launch details for its new HBO Max streaming service.
