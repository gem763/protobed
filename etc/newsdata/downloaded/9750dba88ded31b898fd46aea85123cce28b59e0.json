REUTERS/Sarah Silbiger\n\nEbrard met with U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, and had a briefer exchange with President Donald Trump, to review progress in efforts to curb a surge in Central American migrants.\n\nPence acknowledged Mexico\u2019s efforts. He said U.S. officials would work with Mexico to expand implementation of the Migrant Protection Protocols to speed up processing of asylum claims, according to a White House statement.\n\nMexico\u2019s strategy of putting more than 25,000 National Guard militarized police along its borders and stepping up raids on people traffickers has been a success, Ebrard told a news conference.\n\n\u201cWhat Mexico has done is working,\u201d said Ebrard, admitting that border crossings were still up from averages in September, \u201cbut the tendency is irreversible ... It is something that we think will be permanent.\u201d\n\nFollowing threats by Trump to impose tariffs on all its goods, Mexico on June 7 pledged to take a series of steps to contain migrants, and the two governments agreed to review that effort after 90 days.\n\nEbrard said tariffs were not discussed. \u201cIt was not the purpose of the meeting. I would say Mexico in this moment is far from the tariffs, far from that possibility,\u201d he said.\n\nMexico brought up the illicit flows of arms from the United States that Mexican authorities want to freeze, according to Ebrard, who said earlier on Twitter that would be Mexico\u2019s priority at the meeting.\n\nSuccessive Mexican governments have argued that illicit arms sales and gun-running from the United States into Mexico have fueled turf wars between drug gangs and clashes with security forces, exacerbating social problems and adding to migratory pressures.\n\nMore than 200,000 people have been killed in gang-fueled violence, and over 40,000 have disappeared since former President Felipe Calderon sent in the armed forces to tackle Mexico\u2019s powerful drug cartels at the end of 2006.\n\nRelated Coverage Mexican foreign minister cites sharp decrease in immigration to U.S.\n\nPresident Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, a leftist who took office in December, has vowed to end the lawlessness, but 2019 is on track to be Mexico\u2019s most violent year on record.\n\nThis month, Trump and U.S. officials have praised Mexico and Central American countries for helping cut U.S. border arrests by nearly 60% from earlier this year. But the issue remains fraught in the run-up to the 2020 U.S. presidential election.\n\nTrump campaigned for office in 2015-16 pledging to halt the flow of illegal immigrants and drugs from Mexico. The Mexican government has persistently argued that disputes over U.S.-Mexico border security are a shared responsibility.", "description": "Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard\u00a0said after a White House meeting on Tuesday that there has been a \"significant decrease\" in U.S.-bound immigration through Mexico, especially from Central America, and he expects the trend to continue.", "authors": ["Alexandra Alper", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190910&t=2&i=1428483016&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8928F", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
