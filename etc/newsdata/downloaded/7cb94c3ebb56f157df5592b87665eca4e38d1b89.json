A student had kicked her in the head while crowdsurfing during a school dance, and since then she's experienced multiple seizures and a failing memory that resets every two hours.\n\nBefore the incident, Riley was a bright student and active athlete. Now she can't remember what happened to her earlier in the day.\n\n\"I'm very confused,\" Riley told ABC News. \"I've tried to think back, and I can't.\"\n\nRiley has been in and out of the hospital and doctors still deem her case a medical mystery. They can't find anything physically wrong with her through CT scans or MRIs, which makes coming up with the proper diagnosis nearly impossible.\n\nAccording to the ABC News report, research shows that after six months of short-term memory loss, the damage can become irreversible, so Riley's family is frantic to find new opinions and options.\n\n\"They told us that she may just be like this forever, and I am not OK with that,\" said Sarah Horner, Riley's mom.\n\nNot only does the memory loss cause problems for Riley at school \u2014 even minor things like remembering where her locker is located is an hourly battle \u2014 but it's taking an extra emotional toll on her family life.\n\n\"My brother passed away last week,\" said Sarah. \"And she probably has no idea. And we tell her every day, but she has no idea about it.\"\n\nTo grapple with her situation, Riley writes detailed notes in class, takes photos of things that are happening and sets an alarm for every two hours so she can revisit everything that's just happened.\n\n\"I'm not making memories.\" said Riley. \"And I'm just really scared.\"", "description": "For the several months, she wakes up every morning thinking it's June 11 \u2014 the day she got kicked in the head and lost her memory.", "authors": ["Katie Mather"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/riDN0pAVV9IdbwPH5hRamA--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMDI4O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims3/GLOB/crop/618x406+5+3/resize/1028x675!/format/jpg/quality/85/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/b4b75080-d4c1-11e9-987f-b12452ae6088", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
