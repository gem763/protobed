The amount of plastics consumed by a given individual would depend largely on where they live and what they eat, they said.\n\nThey also added that the impact on human health of microplastic consumption was still not well understood.\n\nHowever microplastic particles smaller than 130 micrometres in diameter \"have the potential to translocate into human tissues (and) trigger a localised immune response\".\n\nDanger of microplastics not clear\n\nAlastair Grant, Professor of Ecology at the University of East Anglia, said there was no evidence that the plastic particles identified in the study posed any \"significant danger to human health\".\n\nGrant, who was not involved in the research, added that it was likely that only a small percentage of particles inhaled actually reached the lungs.\n\n\"One of the two sources for particle concentrations in air says that the observed fibres are too large to be inhaled, so the numbers of particles that actually reach our lungs will be much smaller than the numbers quoted,\" he said.\n\nThe authors said more research was needed to better understand how many microparticles reach the lungs and stomach, and what, if any, danger this poses.\n\n\"The most effective way to reduce human consumption of microplastics will likely be to reduce the production and use of plastics,\" they said.\n\nKEEP UPDATED on the latest news by subscribing to our FREE newsletter.\n\n- FOLLOW News24 on Twitter", "description": "Humans eat and breathe in tens of thousands of microplastic particles every year, according to a new analysis that raised fresh questions over how plastic waste could directly impact our health.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8822/0e91b431726a47d7a308e4ad81ccf6d2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-06-06"}
