After the women spoke out, the company said it would do more to protect female athletes' pay during and after pregnancy.\n\n\"I think everything I went through this year ... it just brings it all back that it's so much bigger than myself,\" Felix, who went on to become the first sponsored athlete for Athleta, told ESPN at the world championships in Doha, Qatar.\n\nFelix was not the only mom to win at the world championships.\n\nJamaican sprinter Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce celebrated her win in the 100-meter race with her 2-year-old son and called it a \"victory for motherhood,\" according to ESPN.\n\nFraser-Pryce told ESPN she sat on her bed and cried when she found out she was pregnant, but said of her decision to keep competing, \"I knew how I felt and I knew I wasn't ready to go. I had something left to do, and I stayed focused on the goal.\"", "description": "Olympic sprinter Allyson Felix broke a world track record held by Usain Bolt 10 months after giving birth.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/allyson-felix-gty-ml-191001_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
