I want to be calm but, really, he was wrong in this action.\"\n\n\"We are working with every player about how to deal with the pressure. The reaction was wrong and we will discuss it with him.\n\n\"I have had similar situations. When supporters are criticising us we need to stand up and stay calm. They are the reason for our work. We need to stay calm when they are applauding and when they are criticising us.\"\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\nFans also chanted the name of out-of-favour midfielder Mesut Ozil, showing their support of the playmaker after being shunned by Emery so far this season.\n\nThe Gunners face a tough trip to Liverpool in the Carabao Cup on Wednesday night before hosting Wolves at the Emirates on Saturday.", "description": "Arsenal experienced a miserable afternoon at home to Crystal Palace whilst being watched by visiting director Josh Kroenke", "authors": ["Rich Jones", "Image", "Arsenal Fc Via Getty Images", "Afp Via Getty Images", "Action Images Via Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20741113.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Arsenal-Pre-Season-Tour-of-the-United-States.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
