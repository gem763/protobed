In sports betting, touts, or self-proclaimed experts who sell their picks to the public, are traditionally seen as unreliable at best, often offering little to no evidence to back up their assertions or prove a successful track record.\n\n\u201cTo me, a reputable tout is somebody that will never accept money if the picks lose, and then they have their full record with every single recommendation they\u2019ve ever made documented,\u201d Schwimer said. \u201cAgain, to my knowledge, there\u2019s nobody else that does anything like this.\u201d\n\nWith 19 states now offering legal sports betting in some form and the overall gambling market worth billions of dollars annually, Schwimer argues that a transparent service based on provable data, rather than an arcane or nonexistent system, is the key to improving the industry\u2019s questionable reputation. To that end, Jambos has pledged to publish the result of every recommendation it makes, complete with time stamps, and offer refunds of up to $10,000 if the picks don\u2019t break even.\n\nWhile little data exists on the size of the sports betting tout industry, Schwimer sees the independent operators selling their picks on social media and other platforms as his chief competition \u2013 though he insists his team of data scientists has created a truly proprietary service.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo date, Schwimer has raised about $23 million for Jambos from several investors, including former Goldman Sachs executive Steve Duncker, who sits on the board of the New York Racing Association. The idea to apply data analytics to sports betting arose from meetings with executives for pro teams, who asked for proof that the modeling formula worked. Schwimer headed to Las Vegas to test the system at local sportsbooks.\n\n\u201cAfter 16 days, I was shut out of every major sportsbook and casino \u2013 shut out down to the posted limit,\u201d Schwimer said. Sportsbooks often limit bets from players on a winning streak.\n\n\u201cThat was shocking to me, because I\u2019m used to the stock market part of the world, where if you want to buy shares in a company, you don\u2019t get stopped,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s when I had the idea \u2013 'hey, I can\u2019t bet $300,000 on a game, but a thousand people can bet $300 on a game.' That\u2019s what got me to Jambos.\u201d\n\nTo predict game outcomes, Schwimer\u2019s team has assembled a forecasting system down to individual player-level models. For example, data analysis might show that a certain NFL team runs a Cover 3 defense and that their opponent has plays and personnel ideally suited to exploiting that coverage.\n\nRather than make a small-scale profit by placing their own bets, Schwimer and his partners decided a subscription service would be more lucrative. After a lengthy test run that began in December 2018, Jambos launched its subscription service in August. The company has made more than 3,000 game recommendations so far.\n\nA week-long pick subscription costs $250. In return, subscribers receive a minimum of 50 bet recommendations and $300 back if they finish \u201cdown units,\u201d or below their break-even point. A 17-week package costs $3,000 with a $10,000 money-back guarantee.\n\nSchwimer won\u2019t rule out working with sports franchises on data analytics in the future. But for now, the potential windfall from sports betting is too much to ignore.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in constant discussions, but what we do know is, anything that we do with a team on that type of a level, we\u2019re probably going to have to give up the Jambos subscription service and doing stuff like that, so it\u2019s going to have to be a really good offer from the team to be able to do that,\u201d he said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "Michael Schwimer founded Jambos Picks, a subscription service that uses a model developed by top-tier sports data analysts to predict game outcomes across the NFL, NBA and other major sports leagues.", "authors": ["Thomas Barrabi"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/media.foxbusiness.com/BrightCove/854081161001/201908/3822/0/0/854081161001_6077806495001_6077808847001-vs.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
