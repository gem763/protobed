At this point in time, it\u2019s just one day at a time. That\u2019s a cliche, but man, is that so true for us.\u201d\n\nThe Nationals held a 2-1 series lead into Saturday after the Astros won 4-1 on Friday. Game 5 will be 8:07 p.m. Sunday, with Scherzer pitching opposite Gerrit Cole. If needed, the series then would return to Houston on Tuesday.\n\nScherzer tries to set the right example for the Nationals even on days he does not pitch.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s just having fun and setting the tone that you\u2019re accountable for everything you do in between your starts as well,\u201d he said. \u201cIn order to pitch as well as you can, it takes the other four days to be able to do that.\u201d\n\nScherzer was on the injured list twice this summer and made just 27 starts \u2014 his lowest since 2008.\n\nHe earned the win Game 1 of the World Series, giving up five hits and two earned runs over five innings with seven strikeouts.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
