Lovecraft comes from the fear of the unknown. Sea Salt, released today on PC, PlayStation 4 and Switch, flips that script by putting the player in control of a monstrous horde that terrifies seaside communities full of humans who, rather than being afraid, are ready to defend themselves. It\u2019s a tough game, but controlling a marauding horde rather than a single person makes for a unique horror experience.\n\nSea Salt begins with a simple premise: Dagon, an ocean-dwelling deity that first appeared in Lovecraft\u2019s short story of the same name, demands a list of specific human sacrifices from his most faithful human servant, a self-styled bishop of Dagon worship. But when it comes time for the bishop himself to take the plunge, he refuses, forcing Dagon to send multitudes of minions to raid the shoreline for sacrifices instead. The player does this by wielding Dagon\u2019s influence through an on-screen cursor, directing monsters\u2019 movement and giving them basic, one-button commands to attack and regroup.\n\nSea Salt starts by giving players one apostle \u2014 a sort of class or character archetype that begins each level with different monsters and attributes \u2014 and one creature, but your roster expands quickly as levels are cleared and challenges are completed. Although I spent most of my time with the starting apostle, I soon had a ton of different choices in how to build my horde.\n\nEach monster has its own stats and abilities, making them useful in different situations. The swarm, for instance, will generally form the basis of Dagon\u2019s army due to the large numbers in which you receive them. Cultists are long-range specialists that can provide cover for the rest of the horde. Crabs are resistant to fire and shotgun blasts.\n\nJust as horror has been used to drive many a doomed Lovecraft protagonist mad, so too does it play a role in Sea Salt. In addition to stats like health and speed, each creature is also rated on how well they horrify the humans they encounter, which in turn makes the enemies more vulnerable to attack as they run away screaming.\n\nSince the humans soon begin to arm themselves with pitchforks and Molotov cocktails, horrifying them is necessary. Building your horde with only speed or damage in mind is a recipe for disaster in later levels.\n\nSea Salt can get a little unwieldy as your horde grows. Players are only able to give the monsters general commands like attack or regroup. Without the ability to directly control them, I\u2019ve had cultists decide to launch fireballs at inanimate objects rather than the shotgun-wielding humans right in front of them and swarms get caught on the corners of buildings as they struggle to navigate where I direct them.\n\nEarly boss battles \u2014 which include a bomb-throwing admiral, an anchor-swinging longshoreman, and a group of torch-wielding villagers intent on protecting a local monastery \u2014 were a chore, as even when I figured out the basic patterns, it felt impossible to direct my monsters in such a way that they could escape unscathed. I also experienced lengthy periods of slowdown as my horde grew to massive proportions and on-screen elements like fire were introduced, although it\u2019s possible this problem is unique to the Switch version.\n\nSea Salt is unforgiving: While I can deal with a little bit of punishment, the more hectic battles often feel like a crapshoot, with victory decided more by luck than any sound strategy or tactics, especially when the game\u2019s performance begins to stumble.\n\nThat said, there\u2019s something strangely satisfying about rampaging through the game\u2019s levels with an army of fishmen and giant crabs. Just don\u2019t expect to have a firm grasp on them as they do their dark lord\u2019s bidding.", "description": "Much of the horror in the works of H.P. Lovecraft comes from the fear of the unknown.
