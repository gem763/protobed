Lindsey Graham backed President Trump's new characterization of the Democratic-led impeachment inquiry, calling it a \"lynching\" in a tweet Tuesday morning.\n\nTrump tweeted said the reason why the Democrats are \"lynching\" him through the impeachment inquiry is because they are doing it \"without due process or fairness or any legal rights,\" adding despite the circumstances, \"we will WIN!\"\n\nSo some day, if a Democrat becomes President and the Republicans win the House, even by a tiny margin, they can impeach the President, without due process or fairness or any legal rights. All Republicans must remember what they are witnessing here - a lynching. But we will WIN! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 22, 2019\n\n\"It shows a lot of things about our national media when it\u2019s about Trump who cares about the process? As long as you get him. Yeah, this is a lynching in every since. It is unAmerican,\" Graham told reporters.\n\n\"I\u2019ve never seen a situation in my lifetime as a lawyer where somebody is accused of a major misconduct who cannot confront the accuser, call witnesses on their behalf and have the discussion in the light of day so the public can judge. If this continues in the house it is a complete sham and I\u2019ll do everything I can to make sure it doesn\u2019t live very long in the Senate,\" he said.\n\nWhile Trump is getting some support from Republicans over the characterization, others have said it goes too far.\n\nRep. Adam Kinzinger (R-IL) tweeted, \"We can all disagree on the process, and argue merits. But never should we use terms like 'lynching' here.\"\n\nWe can all disagree on the process, and argue merits. But never should we use terms like \u201clynching\u201d here. The painful scourge in our history has no comparison to politics, and @realDonaldTrump should retract this immediately. May God help us to return to a better way. https://t.co/URKNgxUfiv \u2014 Adam Kinzinger (@RepKinzinger) October 22, 2019\n\n\n\n", "description": ".10/22/2019 12:18:01PM EST.", "authors": ["Julio Rosas", "Cortney O'Brien", "Matt Vespa", "Timothy Meads", "Guy Benson"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/images/2019/295/9bb62cc0-3915-4b74-abed-cab1c06f0ad1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
