The U.S. State Department initially blocked the EU ambassador, whose text messages revealed by lawmakers indicated he was aware of such efforts, from appearing before investigators. But after receiving a subpoena, Sondland\u2019s attorney said his client would appear before the three committees spearheading the probe on Thursday.\n\nHill, the president's former top Russia adviser, was the first White House official to cooperate in the Democrats' investigation of the Ukraine scandal. According to the New York Times\u2019 report, Hill described Sondland metaphorically as driving in an unfamiliar place with no guardrails and no GPS.\n\nShe said she thought Sondland\u2019s actions made him vulnerable to foreign governments due to his inexperience, and described how he often used a personal cellphone for official diplomatic matters.\n\nHill also said Sondland would repeatedly tell foreign officials they could visit the White House whenever they wanted, prompting one instance in which Romanian officials showed up at the president\u2019s residence without an appointment.\n\nShe reportedly told investigators that Sondland would provide the cellphone numbers of American officials to foreigners, which posed a counterintelligence risk, according to the report.\n\nHill said she and her boss, then national security adviser John Bolton, were so concerned by what they saw that she went to White House lawyers.", "description": "Former foreign policy adviser reportedly told House impeachment investigators she had concerns about US ambassador to the EU.", "authors": ["Emma Anderson", "David M.
