New York City\u2019s congestion pricing surcharge adds $2.75 onto each Uber and Lyft ride, analysts said. That Big Apple surcharge is separate from congestion pricing that will go into effect in 2021.\n\nWedbush Securities also said the California bill \u2014 if signed into law \u2014 would drive up consumer costs, but didn\u2019t price out the extra ride costs.\n\nBefore California riders dig a little deeper in their wallet, they should remember the bill\u2019s still pending.\n\nThe legislation, known as Assembly Bill 5, says workers are \u201cemployees\u201d if the company controls the person\u2019s work and that work is a core part of the company\u2019s business model. Someone who\u2019s an \u201cemployee\u201d in the eyes of the bill is eligible for benefits like minimum hourly wage, workers\u2019 compensation and protection from discrimination and sexual harassment.\n\nSee also: Why freelancers face an uphill battle against sexual harassers\n\nAhead of Uber\u2019s IPO in May, thousands of workers briefly went on strike across the globe to protest pay and working conditions driving for Lyft and Uber.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom supports the bill but told the Wall Street Journal he is talking with Uber UBER, -0.17% and Lyft LYFT, -1.18% about how they\u2019ll be affected.\n\nThe two companies, along with DoorDash, say they\u2019ll spend a combined $90 million for a 2020 ballot initiative addressing who\u2019s eligible to be a full-time worker and who\u2019s an independent contractor.\n\nEven before the bill\u2019s passage, some observers said that Uber and Lyft prices were artificially low and bound for a bump up if the Silicon Valley companies want to turn profits.\n\nA Lyft statement didn\u2019t address whether it would pass costs on to riders if the bill took effect in its current form. But a spokesman said many rides-hare drivers wanted a \u201cthoughtful solution that balances flexibility with an earnings standard and benefits. The fact that there were more than 50 industries carved out of AB5 is very telling. We are fully prepared to take this issue to the voters of California to preserve the freedom and access drivers and riders want and need.\u201d\n\nTony West, Uber\u2019s chief legal officer, told reporters Wednesday that lawmakers were \u201cmissing a real opportunity to lead the nation\u201d by passing the measure instead of a proposal backed by the ridesharing industry. He said the company will keep pressing for \u201cthe independence and choice that drivers tell us again and again in surveys, polls, focus groups, and personal conversations that they value most.\u201d\n\nHe added that 92% of Uber drivers in America spent less than 40 hours a week on the road, while 45% drove less than 10 hours a week.\n\nUber shares are down more than 18% since they started trading in May and Lyft shares are down 40% from the company\u2019s trading start in late March. The S&P 500 SPX, -1.92% is up 7.5% over the past six month and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -1.96% is up more than 5% in that time.", "description": "The bill is good news for drivers, but may cost passengers.", "authors": ["Andrew Keshner"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR136_uber_c_ZG_20190911151943.jpg"}
