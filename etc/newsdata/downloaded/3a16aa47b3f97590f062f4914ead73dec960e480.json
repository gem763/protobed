Mitt Romney (R-Utah) on Sunday responded to allegations that President Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden and his son, condemning them as \"troubling in the extreme\" and tweeting that it's \"[c]ritical for the facts to come out.\"\n\nWhy it matters: Romney's comments are the harshest to come from a Republican senator thus far, with others largely remaining silent or dismissing the allegations as gossip. It's worth noting, however, that both Trump and his lawyer Rudy Giuliani confirmed on Sunday that the president discussed Biden during a July 25 phone call with Zelensky, though they contend that there was no \"quid pro quo\" involved.", "description": "\"Critical for the facts to come out.\"", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/fAKoSGKs6vcVnsB7a6R7rP-3ew8=/0x104:5435x3161/1920x1080/2019/09/22/1569184213153.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
