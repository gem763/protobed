Step inside the squat, utilitarian collection of buildings, however, and it\u2019s a very different story. Statuesque, extravagantly coiffed figures strut about the corridors in wigs, sequins and retro block-colour suits. Elsewhere, lithe dancers in garish-glamorous leisurewear languidly limber up, presided over by MC Pray Tell (recent Emmy winner Billy Porter), in an extravagant ensemble befitting a pearly king. In the middle of it all, underneath the biggest disco ball imaginable, is powerhouse television hit-maker Ryan Murphy.\n\nWe are on the set of Pose, Murphy\u2019s flamboyant drama (co-created with long-term collaborator Brad Falchuk) set in the New York underground ballroom scene of the late 1980s, and his latest bid to capture the zeitgeist through a story from the recent past. Murphy\u2019s 2018 mega-deal with Netflix sealed his title as \u201cthe most powerful man in TV\u201d, but he has earned his crown creating groundbreaking shows both about and starring people whom TV has traditionally ignored.\n\nBefore the first episode even aired, Pose was already making history, with five of the leads \u2013 Indya Moore, Mj Rodriguez, Dominique Jackson, Hailie Sahar and Angelica Ross \u2013 played by transgender women, and another 45 trans performers cast in the wider ensemble, the most ever in a scripted television show. Season two jumps forward 18 months to the summer of 1990, when Madonna\u2019s Vogue was No 1 in the charts, and ballroom culture was going mainstream. Yet it was also a time when New York\u2019s LGBTQ community was hit by the HIV/Aids emergency.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Vogue\u2019s gallery... Billy Porter as Pray Tell in Pose. Photograph: Michael Parmelee/FX/Kobal/REX/Shutterstock\n\n\u201cI was interested in the idea of a community in crisis and under siege,\u201d says Murphy, who is also directing today\u2019s episode. \u201cThe medications that have helped stop the plague, the holocaust, came out in 1996, so I hope to end the show right as that happened, to really show the decimation of a world.\u201d\n\nA self-declared \u201cgay kid from Indiana who moved to Hollywood in 1989 with $55 in savings in my pocket\u201d, Murphy has always been drawn to the margins. And, difficult though it may be to recall, there once was a time when \u2013 rather than the man who, last February, signed a whopping $300m deal with Netflix \u2013 he was \u201csomebody who couldn\u2019t sell a script and was being told that everything I did was too gay or too out-there\u201d. The feedback did not cause him to deviate from his vision. \u201cI only wrote or created shows that I really wanted to watch, so they inevitably had gay characters and trans characters and minorities,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I made them the leads instead of the sidekicks, because that is what I did in my own life.\u201d\n\nThe cast of TV drama Pose: \u2018Without us Madonna would be nothing\u2019 Read more\n\nMurphy, 53, has been writing for a living since his late teens, first working as an entertainment journalist before moving into screenwriting in the late 1990s with the teen comedy Popular. He truly came to prominence, however, with Nip/Tuck, his dark psychological comedy set in a plastic-surgery practice. Since then, he has indisputably changed the industry, taking mainstream his offbeat celebration of the camp with high-school pep-squad musical comedy-drama Glee, teen murder mystery Scream Queens, and the miniseries Feud: Bette and Joan, a colourful dramatisation of the rivalry between Bette Davis (Susan Sarandon) and Joan Crawford (Jessica Lange) during the making of Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?. If that wasn\u2019t enough, Murphy is also responsible for popularising the much-imitated anthology format both with the twisted American Horror Story, which features a rotating cast of Murphy regulars (Sarah Paulson, Jessica Lange, Kathy Bates) in a range of ghoulish setups, and the ripped-from-the-headlines American Crime Story, which has earned acclaim for its retelling of the OJ Simpson trial and the 1997 murder of Gianni Versace.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Getting a bit of work done...

With his radical, pro-LGBTQ hiring policies and representation, Murphy is changing the face of the industry, on both sides of the camera.\n\n\u201cI think I only really began to understand the power of the medium around the time of OJ and The Normal Heart [the film Murphy directed about the Aids crisis in New York City in the 1980s],\u201d he says, speaking in front of a red glitter curtain between takes. \u201cThe Normal Heart aired, and I remember looking at Twitter, and so many young people had posted about it, saying: \u2018I had no idea this happened.\u2019 And then I saw it with OJ, with the rehabilitation of [prosecutor] Marcia Clark, from shill to feminist hero.\u201d\n\nWith Pose, he says, \u201cthe whole theme of the show is: what does it feel like when you are invited to the party, when you suddenly have a place at the table? And what does it feel like when that invitation is then taken away? Look at the world we live in, and look at who our president is. A lot of us thought that we had made it \u2013 Obama was president! \u2013 but no. Those rights are now more fragile than ever.\u201d\n\nHe is more than happy to admit that his shows are political, and that their mission is to educate as much as entertain. \u201cThere is not a lot of LGBTQ history out there; I grew up knowing nothing,\u201d he says. \u201cIn the first episode of season two, we introduce a place called Hart Island, which I\u2019d never heard of, an island off Manhattan where the bodies of thousands of people who had died of Aids were put on shipping containers and buried in mass graves.\u201d They recreated the island for the show. \u201cThat\u2019s a powerful thing to put out into the world.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Gwynning at any cost... Gwyneth Paltrow in The Politician. Photograph: Courtesy of Netflix\n\nWhen Murphy sleeps is anyone\u2019s guess; alongside season two of Pose, this year has also seen the release of The Politician, his first original show for Netflix, starring Ben Platt and Gwyneth Paltrow. Murphy has said that the show cost as much as The Crown to make, part of a commitment on his part to do things that are \u201cbig and commercial, fun and shiny\u201d. His tone, which he describes as \u201cbaroque\u201d, is anything but subtle, and tends to divide critics \u2013 this newspaper called American Horror Story \u201cthe Marmite of TV shows\u201d, and The Politician has taken some flak for its frantic and somewhat artificial style.\n\nWhatever Murphy creates, it tends to stir conversation or controversy. He is currently working on the next instalment of the American Crime Story anthology: Impeachment, which will tackle the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal and the subsequent impeachment proceedings against Bill Clinton. In something of a coup, Lewinsky herself has signed on to be a producer, part of an attempt by the former White House intern to \u201cfully reclaim my narrative\u201d. As if the series wasn\u2019t controversy-courting enough, its release date is scheduled for autumn 2020, smack in the middle of US election season. (Murphy, apparently surprised by the backlash to the proposed date, has said that he has \u201cnot committed yet on when we\u2019re going to release it\u201d.)\n\nLess controversially, Murphy is also adapting pioneering LGBTQ Broadway play The Boys in the Band into a Netflix film to air next year. \u201cThe stuff I always wanted to make, now, mainstream companies will step up and give you millions of dollars to do,\u201d he says. \u201cThey know there\u2019s an audience for this, and they will show up. That is a very big difference from when I was starting out, when I wasn\u2019t allowed to even write a gay character.\u201d\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just him \u2013 the Murphy effect is tangible. \u201cMore and more showrunners, writers, networks, are taking people who are marginalised and making them the leads,\u201d he notes. \u201cThese people have gone from being sidekicks at best to being captains of their own story. And that\u2019s significant.\u201d\n\nMurphy\u2019s most memorable characters:\n\nby Stuart Heritage\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Susan Sarandon as Bette Davis in Feud: Bette and Joan.

Arguably the worst dad in TV history.\n\nGeorgina Hobart The Politician\n\nGwyneth Paltrow is more a meme than an actor now; an out-of-touch wellness maven who doesn\u2019t recognise her own co-stars. Her character on The Politician is the perfect crystallisation of that mindset.\n\nPray Tell Pose\n\nPose isn\u2019t exactly shy and retiring, but Billy Porter\u2019s Pray Tell manages to outshine the rest of the cast put together. He rightly won an Emmy for his star turn.\n\nSeason two of Pose begins with a double bill Saturday 26 October, 10.20pm, BBC Two", "description": "With hit series like Pose, Glee and American Horror Story, he brought marginalised characters to the masses.
