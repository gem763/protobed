Some things have been going on in my life that I needed to write about.

And he's a kidney donor. And I've come on here to ask you what blood group you are. If you are an O-positive I'll take it off you. James added: 'And I'm not a match.'\n\nThe You're Beautiful hitmaker revealed that he has written a song called Monsters on his new album Once Upon A Mind which details how he feels about his father and his diagnosis.\n\nJames said: 'Really that has been an amazing moment. Because when you realise your father's mortality it's a great opportunity to say the things I'd like to say to him.\n\n'What blood type are you'? The singer, 45, asked host Kate Garraway what her blood type was during their interview as he admitted that his dad Charles needed an organ transplant\n\n'So I have written a song called Monsters for him. It says I'm not your son, you're not my father, we are just two grown men saying goodbye.'\n\nHis father Colonel Charles Blount, a former cavalry officer, has been diagnosed with stage 4 chronic kidney disease.\n\nDuring the interview James revealed that his album wasn't 'all misery' and detailed the other meanings behind his songs, including his wife and kids.\n\nHe said: 'I've come on here to ask you what blood group you are. Some things have been going on in my life that I needed to write about. My father has not been very well actually'\n\nHe said: 'He needs a new kidney. And he's a kidney donor. And I've come on here to ask you what blood group you are. If you are an O-positive I'll take it off you. James added: 'And I'm not a match'\n\nHe said: 'But it's not all misery, I have children so wrote songs about them . I go away on tour a lot and leave my wife to pick up the pieces of our family, so there's songs for her too.'\n\nAs well as going on tour, James has bought and is in the process of refurbishing a pub in Chelsea called The Fox and Pheasant.\n\nWhen quizzed on whether his wife is annoyed that he's come off tour and bought a pub, he joked: 'No we're both alcoholics, so it worked well! It\u2019s the fox and pheasant in Chelsea. I'm heavily involved in the refurb!\n\n'People ask where to and I say let\u2019s go to my pub. We do play music, but we generally stay away from mine until five to midnight when we want everyone to leave.'\n\nHe added: 'I take the micky out of myself a lot, but I take music v seriously. I got into music and it helps me say things I couldn't say otherwise. It's wonderful to say these things to the people I care about.'", "description": "James Blunt has made a plea for a kidney donor for his unwell father after revealing he isn't a match during an appearance on Good Morning Britain on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Charlotte Dean For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/12/20080186-0-image-a-41_1571829078992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
