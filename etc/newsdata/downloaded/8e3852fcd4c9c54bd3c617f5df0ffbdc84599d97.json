Malkin, author of the upcoming book Open Borders Inc.: Who\u2019s Funding America\u2019s Destruction, is \"marching right into the belly of the beast to blow the whistle on the dark money groups and individuals funding America\u2019s illegal immigration crisis.\"\n\nMalkin will travel to 18 cities that defy federal immigration policy, exposing businesses as well as Republican and Democratic officials who endanger American lives with reckless sanctuary city policies and illegal immigration employment. Certain local ordinances enacted by elected \"leaders\" forbid police and other public servants from cooperating with federal agencies such as Immigration and Customs Enforcement. For example, many of these jurisdictions refuse to honor ICE detainer requests, and willingly release violators of American immigration law despite requests that local police hold these individuals until they can be taken into custody by federal authorities.\n\nAccording to a press release sent by Regnery Publishing, Malkin \"will be sharing her deep-dive dossier of the funders and foot soldiers of immigration anarchy here and around the globe with Americans whose cities have been battered by the immigration crisis.\"\n\nOpen Borders publishes on September 10, 2019. It can be purchased here. Below are confirmed events for national tour:", "description": ".09/04/2019 19:39:30PM EST.", "authors": ["Timothy Meads", "Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa", "Katie Pavlich"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/images/2019/247/c557812b-f611-4269-9188-4c43723022cc.png"}
