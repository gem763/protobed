It\u2019s about pay and benefits, but underlying that is a real breakdown between British Airways and its pilots.\n\n\u201cWe need to find a way of resolving both the dispute between us and and finding a way to rebuild that trust.\n\n\u201cAlthough we have a small gap between us in pound-note terms, for the last few months British Airways has said, \u2018We are not going to budge at all unless pilots pay for any increase themselves\u2019.\u201d He said that \u201cpilots simply won\u2019t stand\u201d self-financed pay rises.\n\n\u201cOur pilot members are very, very angry, and very, very resolved in their determination to see through this dispute to a successful conclusion for them.\n\n\u201cEqually British Airways has dug its heels in and is taking a bullying attitude now towards its pilots.\n\n\u201cI hope that we can drag British Airways back to the table with some genuine negotiations, because I know we can compromise our position.\u201d\n\nA BA spokesperson said: \u201cWe understand the frustration and disruption Balpa\u2019s strike action has caused our customers.\n\n\u201cAfter many months of trying to resolve the pay dispute, we are extremely sorry that it has come to this.\n\n\u201cWe remain ready and willing to return to talks with Balpa.\u201d\n\nMr Strutton said that the union had hoped BA would operate more flights during the stoppage, saying: \u201cWe do genuinely regret the disruption to passengers. We wish that British Airways was running more of its operation to get people away.\u201d\n\nThe BA spokesperson said: \u201cUnfortunately, with no detail from Balpa on which pilots would strike, we had no way of predicting how many would come to work or which aircraft they are qualified to fly, so we had no option but to cancel nearly 100 per cent our flights.\u201d\n\nA 24-hour stoppage is planned for Friday 27 September. To avoid paying cash compensation to passengers, British Airways will need to inform them of cancellations on Wednesday or Thursday this week.", "description": "All British Airways outbound flights from Heathrow and Gatwick have been grounded by the pilots\u2019 strike for a second day \u2013 wrecking the plans of almost 100,000 passengers and costing the airline up to \u00a350m in lost revenue and additional costs.
