That especially holds true with Hyun-Jin Ryu of the Dodgers struggling lately (2 G, 14 ER, 9 IP). The Indians are convincing -320 moneyline favorites while facing a White Sox team that ranks 25th in wRC+ with the fourth-highest strikeout rate (25.6%). Add it all up, and I\u2019m more than willing to entertain Bieber\u2019s cumbersome salary through all formats.\n\nAlso Consider: Chris Paddack, Trevor Williams\n\nCATCHER / FIRST BASE\n\nMatt Beaty - LA Dodgers (vs. Colorado)\n\nStory continues\n\nI\u2019m all about a Dodgers\u2019 stack tonight, and Beaty kicks things off as a quality mid-range option stepping in against Colorado RHP Antonio Senzatela\u2019s .371 wOBA split to left-handed bats. Beaty has been stepping up lately, recording three multi-hit outings, six runs, five RBIs, and two stolen bases over his past five starts. This is an excellent spot to keep the momentum, and Beaty won\u2019t break the bank either.\n\nAlso Consider: Carlos Santana, Ryan O\u2019Hearn\n\nSECOND BASE\n\nGavin Lux - LA Dodgers (vs. Colorado)\n\nLux is probably my favorite \u201cper dollar\u201d play of this slate. Most DFS sites still have the rookie priced too low despite coming out of the gate with three hits and three runs across his first two major league games. Lux is another left-handed bat who is poised to jump on the aforementioned generosity of Colorado RHP Senzatela, and I highly recommend him through all DFS formats.\n\nAlso Consider: Whit Merrifield, Jason Kipnis\n\nTHIRD BASE\n\nMatt Chapman - Oakland (vs. LA Angels)\n\nChapman is heating up with four hits, one homer, and four RBI (one stolen base) over his past four outings. Tonight\u2019s draw against Angels\u2019 LHP Patrick Sandoval makes for an excellent spot to keep the heater alive. Sandoval looked better in his most recent start (5 IP, 0 ER, 9 K), but that came against a Rangers\u2019 offense that ranks 27th in wRC+ while facing left-handed pitching. In other words, the rookie southpaw will have a tough time keeping that pace against an Oakland lineup that ranks seventh against lefties. Chapman is a prime candidate to jump all over the platoon advantage in this one.\n\nAlso consider: Rafael Devers, Justin Turner\n\nSHORTSTOP\n\nCorey Seager - LA Dodgers (vs. Colorado)\n\nLet\u2019s get back to this Dodgers\u2019 stack against Colorado RHP Senzatela\u2019s .371 wOBA split to left-handed bats. Los Angeles rightfully checks in with the highest scoring projection of this slate, and Seager is another mid-range lift within that. You can catch the Dodgers\u2019 shortstop for a cheaper salary (on some DFS sites) than other top players at his position (Lindor, Bogaerts, Semien, Mondesi), making Seager even more enticing for cash games.\n\nAlso Consider: Xander Bogaerts, Adalberto Mondesi\n\nOUTFIELD\n\nAndrew Benintendi - Boston (vs. Minnesota)\n\nBenintendi had been relatively quiet from a fantasy perspective over the past two weeks. His salary has fallen as a result, and the Red Sox outfielder enjoyed a nice breakout performance by going 2-4 with a double and homer last night. We could see more of the same against Minnesota RHP Jose Berrios, who has noticed a lack of velocity and consistency throughout the second half of the season. Berrios was able to end a stretch of four shaky outings with a quality start last week against the White Sox. However, facing an intimidating Boston offense in Fenway Park could tell a different story. Benintendi represents a solid buy-low opportunity against him.\n\nAlex Gordon - Kansas City (vs. Detroit)\n\nI\u2019m almost embarrassed that we\u2019ve made it this far in the article without picking on Detroit RHP Edwin Jackson. Let\u2019s be real for a moment, Jackson is nothing more than a filler for the lowly Tigers to sacrifice in order to close out this nightmare season. The journeyman hurler has been generous against batters of either handedness while allowing 16 earned runs through 12.1 innings over his last three starts. I\u2019m not expecting things to improve against the Royals tonight, and Alex Gordon makes for an intriguing mid-range lift opposite of Jackson.\n\nAlso consider: Nelson Cruz, Mookie Betts, A.J.
