His head was physically misshapen. He was inconsolable.\n\n'He had PTSD and a mental breakdown and was off school for three months. I wasn't letting him go back there.\n\n'He tried to kill himself when he was 11. He was reliving it in his sleep, crying and begging for help - it was just heartbreaking to see.'\n\nShe said Jake's autism made it hard for him to explain his emotions and has undergone two years of counselling but still struggles with anxiety.\n\nJake's mother Diane (pictured) has now joined a campaign to change laws around bullying in the hope of saving children's lives\n\nHe now does not feel safe on his own in the world and the family are unable to go on holiday because he struggles in different situations and with large groups.\n\nDiane, who has three other children, has joined up with other parents of children who have been victims of bullying.\n\nThey will be visiting schools across the country to share their stories in the hope of minimising bullying.\n\nJake's autism made it hard for him to explain his emotions\n\nThe campaign will be launched on October 25 by Jason Barnett from Leeds, an advocate for vulnerable children and a former teacher.\n\nThe group is made up of more than 75 families across the UK with some having lost children to suicide after being bullied.\n\nA spokesman for the de Ferrers Academy, where Jake was a pupil at the time of the attack, said: 'The academy has a range of strategies in place to minimise bullying and clear procedures to address it should it occur.\n\n'We operate an entirely non-teaching support and guidance structure to ensure that pastoral staff are always available should a student need to report an issue.\n\n'This is supplemented by inclusion centres on each campus and staff who provide counselling, should the need arise.\n\nJake was a pupil at the de Ferrers Academy in Staffordshire (pictured) at the time of the attack\n\n'As part of our safeguarding review with the local authority, we have also introduced an email student helpline for bullying which guarantees a response within the day.\n\n'All bullying incidents are recorded and reported to the local governing body.'\n\nFor confidential support call the Samaritans on 116123 or visit a local Samaritans branch, see www.samaritans.org for details.", "description": "Jake Warfield, from Staffordshire, was left with serious injuries to his face, head, arms, knees and shoulder after the horrific attack.
