Photo: Daniel J Vasquez\n\nThe script for Anna Moench\u2019s Mothers begins with a lot of notes. There are prescriptions for casting, props, and set; a list of rules governing character interaction in the play\u2019s first act; and a long explanation of the racial dynamics Moench wants to explore. Mothers, she writes, takes place in \u201can off-kilter, fun-house mirror version of our reality, an alternate universe [where] people of color are at the top of the hierarchy, and white people (called \u2018beige people\u2019 in this world) are at the bottom.\u201d But, she adds, \u201cthe audience will feel a sickening feeling as the racial power dynamics of our world and history start clawing their way onstage in Act Two.\u201d\n\nThere are plenty of reasons, racial and gender power dynamics among them, that audiences might get a \u201csickening feeling\u201d as Mothers plummets toward its final destination: It\u2019s an apocalypse play about parenting, or a parenting play about the apocalypse, and over the course of its intermissionless two acts, the land it lives in \u2014 a land of petty, privileged rivalry over all things baby \u2014 morphs into something more akin to Sarah Kane\u2019s Blasted. The play\u2019s second half is devoted to all sorts of survival-based horrors, but here\u2019s the thing: That sickening feeling Moench is hoping for? I didn\u2019t feel it. I got the idea that probably I should, but something about the play\u2019s progression left me cold. Mothers wants to dig into a lot of things \u2014 race, gender, class, primal instinct, our fears of the world\u2019s ever-increasing litany of terrors, how all of these things affect what it means to be a parent, especially a mom \u2014 but its observations, even its twists, often feel more predictable than revelatory. Meanwhile, Robert Ross Parker\u2019s very clean production creates a sense of disconnect from the story\u2019s descent into gritty, bloody chaos.\n\nWe begin at a Mommy Baby Meetup in an undefined suburb outside \u201cThe City.\u201d (In Moench\u2019s off-kilter reality, we might be in a version of Connecticut or Orange County, with the lights of New York or L.A. glowing just over the horizon.) Wilson Chin\u2019s slick, modular set has a futuristic waiting-room feel \u2014 pink floor, fake plants, white geometric \u201cfurniture\u201d that you can\u2019t really sit on. Three mothers look out through the fourth wall, watching their children in an unseen play area. Two \u2014 Meg (Satomi Blair) and Vick (Jasmine Batchelor) \u2014 are old friends, and Vick is in town for a visit, notably without her child. Ariana (Maechi Aharanwa) is Meg\u2019s new bestie. She\u2019s got three kids (\u201cYou\u2019re like the mom guru!\u201d Meg gushes) and plenty of opinions on Vick\u2019s parenting choices. As tensions flare oh-so-politely between busy working mom Vick and proudly stay-at-home mom Ariana, the vapid, cheery Meg attempts to play both sides \u2014 while Ty (Max Gordon Moore), the only dad at the play place, and Gladys (Tina Chilip), a watchful, taciturn nanny, look on.\n\nFor a while, Mothers is all about the familiar competition bubbling up among Vick, Ariana, and Meg. It\u2019s a three-way wrestling match of upper- middle-class passive aggression \u2014 whose baby walked/talked/read first, whose pediatrician/sex life/work-life balance is best \u2014 plus the odd reminder that we\u2019re not quite in Kansas anymore. \u201cMy husband\u2019s beige \u2026 So my son\u2019s half-beige,\u201d Vick says, smiling, groping to make conversation with Ty. \u201cI\u2019m just saying I\u2019m an ally,\u201d she adds hastily.\n\nMoench is cataloguing recognizable microaggressions, presumptions, and privileges inside a slightly skewed frame. And it\u2019s not that her jabs don\u2019t land and that some of them aren\u2019t pretty funny \u2014 it\u2019s just that they don\u2019t quite add up. The accusations Ariana and Vick toss at each other quickly start to feel tired; the replacements of things like Facebook and Instagram with Facenet and Constapic are good for a brief grin but for little more; and the play, despite some escalation in the mothers\u2019 rivalry, soon starts to tread water. But then there\u2019s nothing like a literal explosion to get yourself out of a rut. Halfway through Mothers, the play place \u2014 the town, the country presumably \u2014 is hit with some kind of attack. The game changes: We\u2019re no longer in Desperate Housewives or Dance Moms but in full-on Survivor mode, but for real.\n\nThe problem is, we don\u2019t really feel the force of that grim reality for a long, long time, if ever. Moench herself asks in her script that big teddy bears be used in place of the mothers\u2019 babies, and notes that \u201ca bold, abstracted, heightened set is preferable in production.\u201d Parker and Chin have obeyed these directives, and although bits of Chin\u2019s set collapse during the explosion, they do it so cleanly \u2014 and are accompanied by so little else in the aesthetic world to tell the story of sudden rupture and heightening chaos \u2014 that we have a hard time registering the fact that the world as these mothers know it really has come to an end. Eventually (and not really surprisingly: Moench follows the pretty basic rules of apocalypse fiction), some horrible decisions have to be made, and some gruesome shit goes down. When the atrocities began, I heard the audience member next to me whisper to her friend, \u201cWait \u2026 what? Why?\u201d Parker\u2019s staging isn\u2019t telling the visual story of the play\u2019s true stakes. The space and the characters stay too kempt for too long. When Ty reports on soldiers outside the walls who would \u201clike, for sure\u201d rape the women were they to venture out, we say, in our dutiful audience brains, \u201cOkay\u201d \u2014 but our stomachs don\u2019t turn. We don\u2019t quite believe it.\n\nBoth the petty drama of Mothers\u2019s first act and the dark, anarchic descent of its second act have a wearying lack of real surprise to them \u2014 and so it\u2019s the little moments, the character eccentricities and pops of personality, that keep us engaged. Batchelor is sharp and thoughtful as Vick, a smart, self-justifying lawyer with a lot of hidden pain who really suffers fools poorly. She\u2019s freaky-funny when she bursts out, wild-eyed and completely serious in a moment of joking about how frequently her 9-month-old son wakes her up at night: \u201cNOT AGAIN! NO! NO! FUCK YOU! I\u2019M GOING TO KILL US BOTH, RIGHT NOW!\u201d And Aharanwa does a great queen bee \u2014 the kind of woman who will sweetly give you advice all day long and might cut you if you return the favor. She\u2019s hilarious to watch in the background while Vick and Meg get into a fight, delightedly eating snacks and darting her eyes back and forth between them like she\u2019s watching pro tennis. And as \u201cTy the Guy,\u201d Moore does weird, excellent work with one of the show\u2019s wackiest moments: A long, house-lights-up monologue straight to the audience in which he explains to us that, at least when he\u2019s not flaccid, he\u2019s got a very large penis.\n\nThat monologue is in fact the last in a series. Just before the world falls apart, Ariana, Meg, and Vick all get to speak their truths, too, and these moments of unvarnished honesty are some of the most affecting in the play. They stand noticeably outside the rules Mothers has set for itself, and I found myself wishing that Moench had found a way to infuse her play with more of these deep dives into each character\u2019s psyche. All these women start to fracture and fade in the play\u2019s second act, while Chilip\u2019s Gladys \u2014 the unbreakable immigrant, the mother who\u2019s caring for other people\u2019s children, the one who will do what it takes, with no bourgeois pussyfooting or shame \u2014 comes predictably to the fore. (And, equally predictably, the play\u2019s only man heads quickly toward monster.) Chilip does serious, focused, nicely underplayed work as Gladys, but she can\u2019t change the fact that the story she\u2019s given to play out, class commentary though it may be, is one we\u2019ve heard before. What we haven\u2019t heard are the specific voices of these people \u2014 women and man, mothers and father. Mothers is most alive when we get a glimpse, however briefly and whether they\u2019re fighting for status or survival, of their real, full dimensions.\n\nMothers is at the Duke on 42nd Street through October 12.", "description": "Theater Review: Anna Moench\u2019s \u2018Mothers\u2019 at the Duke on 42nd Street, Produced by the Playwrights Realm", "authors": ["Sara Holdren"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/25/25-mothers.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
