AP\n\nWhile Radcliffe sees a need to ensure fairness, the 45-year-old Briton did not sound any alarms.\n\nThe sport has seen a dramatic change from 1960 when Ethiopia's barefoot Abebe Bikila won the Rome Olympic marathon in two hours, 15 minutes, 16 seconds.\n\nThe top five times in men's marathons plus Kipchoge's unofficial record of 1:59.40 minutes set in Vienna were all run in the revolutionary footwear in the last 13 months.\n\nLegal shoes?\n\nInternational Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) rules say that an athlete can run barefoot, or even with one shoe, but Rule 143.2 states, \"shoes must not be constructed so as to give athletes any unfair assistance or advantage\" and that \"any type of shoe used must be reasonably available to all\".\n\nRecent social media chatter, however, indicates that the IAAF is concerned enough that has launched an investigation into whether the new shoes are legal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nContacted by Reuters, the IAAF did not immediately respond for a request for confirmation.\n\nBrigid Kosgei of poses with her time after winning the Chicago Marathon while setting a world record. AP\n\nAthletics is far from the first sport to wrestle with technology.

Kirsty Wigglesworth\n\nSwimming took the extraordinary step in 2010 of banning high-tech suits after dozens of records were being set at almost every meet.\n\nLike climbing Mount Everest, runners will continue to attempt to scale higher peaks said Radcliffe, whether in high-tech shoes or bare feet.\n\n\"The beauty around the two hours is because it was there,\" said Radcliffe.\n\n\"In the women's race, we don't actually know where that barrier equivalent might lie. The mythical element of that big number is to be broken through.\n\n\"I think it is a continued progression for people to improve and they are always looking to improve further, just the same as any area of life.\"\n\nReuters", "description": "Eliud Kipchoge and Brigid Kosgei broke records this month.
