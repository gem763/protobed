He invited one to his home to look at his paintings. He then subjected her to sexual assaults in his bedroom and in his daughter's bedroom, leaving her so scared she decided to 'play dead'.\n\nSmith was found guilty at Dundee Sheriff Court (pictured), he showed no emotion as the verdict was passed against him\n\nShe said: 'I didn't say anything to him, I was extremely frightened, very, very intimidated, because he was acting in a way I never expected.\n\n'He said I should go to his bed. I did as I was told \u2013 I was scared. I curled myself up into a ball so I would be completely inaccessible, but it didn't work. I was playing dead.'\n\nSheriff John Rafferty deferred sentence until November 7 for reports and ordered Smith's name be placed on the sex offenders' register.\n\nHe told Smith: 'I found the Crown witnesses to be credible and reliable, in the main exceedingly impressive witnesses, and in some instances courageous witnesses. The case against you is compelling.'\n\nSmith showed no emotion at the verdict. The court heard he had been suspended from the school for nine months and would lose his job.", "description": "A Dundee art teacher who would drop pencils under desks to leer at students has been found guilty of indecent assault.
