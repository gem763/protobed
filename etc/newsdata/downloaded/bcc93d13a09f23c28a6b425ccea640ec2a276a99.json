August also saw five failed leveraged loan offerings, according to Bloomberg News, after a decade of easy credit.\n\nInvestors often view the leveraged loan market as a canary in the coal mine, because economic weakness is likely to show up first in companies with heavy debt burdens.\n\nCLO funds sell bonds to finance the purchase of leveraged loans to a range of already highly indebted corporate borrowers. Investors have pointed to waning liquidity in lower-rated bonds as a potentially troublesome development in the sector.\n\nSee: Warning signs are flashing in funds that buy leveraged loans\n\nLeveraged loans also are floating-rate instruments, which has made them less attractive to investors as the U.S. central bank has embarked on its current rate-cutting cycle to bolster the economy.\n\nBank of America analysts said rates likely have room to \u201cgo lower on the back of continuous market disruptions from trade negotiations, poor economic data, and political gridlock\u201d and worsen the \u201crelative value picture for floating rate assets,\u201d while potentially \u201cextending the capital flight from retail loan funds.\u201d\n\nThis chart shows the billions of dollars that have been pulled out of loan funds this year by investors:\n\nBank of America Merrill Lynch Billions have been pouring out of loan funds\n\n\u201cA replay of the broad-market selloff seen in 4Q18 is not entirely out of the question, though lacking a clear catalyst for such a sharp spike in volatility, spread widening is expected to continue at a slow and orderly pace,\u201d the BAML team wrote.\n\nOn Monday, the Chicago PMI business barometer, a key measure of business conditions in the region, dropped to 47.1 in September from 50.4 in the prior month. Any reading below 50 indicates worsening conditions.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, CLOs and leveraged loans lately have been again in the cross hairs of regulators and elected officials.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, in a letter last week to Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Jay Clayton, criticized the SEC for having \u201cfailed to use the regulatory tools\u201d it was granted a decade ago to crack down on inflated bond ratings, a catalyst of the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nWarren\u2019s letter singled out the boom in CLO funds as source of worry.\n\n\u201cI am especially concerned about collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), given the rapid growth of CLOs and the lack of appropriate responses from federal agencies, including the SEC,\u201d she wrote.\n\n\u201cThese securitizations have helped enable increased leveraged loans that are generally poorly underwritten and include few protections for lenders and investors, which creates significant risk to the financial system and the American economy.\u201d\n\nWarren asked the SEC to respond to a list of her questions no later than Oct. 18, including any progress the regulator has made in shifting ratings agencies away from the current issuer-paid model, which allows issuers to pick only for the best possible ratings for their bond deals, while ignoring any lower grades it doesn\u2019t like.", "description": "Investor weariness over corporate stress signals could spark another sharp, fourth-quarter selloff in CLO funds, which buy the bulk of loans to debt-laden...", "authors": ["Joy Wiltermuth", "Markets Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS353_CLO_ZG_20190930172534.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
