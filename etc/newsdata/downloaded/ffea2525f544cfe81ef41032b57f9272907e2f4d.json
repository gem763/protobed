It has previously said its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization was positive for 2017 and 2018.\n\nThe company has also faced backlash in numerous places where it operates. It has been accused of helping property owners avoid paying income taxes on rental income and disrupting rental market balances, and has been accused of fraud and abuse.", "description": "Short-term rental company Airbnb says it plans to go public next year and list its shares on the stock exchange.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5008332.1549481142!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/hotels-france-airbnb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
