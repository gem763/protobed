Her website also touts John 3:16 and describes, in a bio section, her work as a mission. She also states she is a Christian.\n\nIn the 12-page lawsuit filed by a socially conservative litigator, the Virginia Beach-based American Center for Law and Justice, attorney for Ms. Carter claim Virginia\u2019s Fair Housing Law chills their plaintiff\u2019s free speech, by proscribing against expressions of religiosity and \u201crequiring the removal of all religious statements or material on any of their communications, websites, and advertising material.\u201d\n\nAccording to Virginia\u2019s Fair Housing statute, a Realtor cannot give the impression of partiality with regard to a range of protected classes, including religion. \u201cThe use of words or symbols associated with a particular religion, national origin, sex, or race shall be prima facie evidence of an illegal preference,\u201d reads state law.\n\nA media contact for the Virginia Real Estate Board declined to respond immediately to request for comment from The Washington Times.\n\n\u201cThe investigation did not find any acts of discrimination by Ms. Carter,\u201d says the lawsuit, which also states she maintains a \u201creligiously diverse client base that includes Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, Catholics, and Evangelical Christians.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a very important case. We\u2019re seeing more of this targeted discrimination against Christians in the name of stopping discrimination, and that\u2019s what\u2019s so absurd about this case is they\u2019re actually doing to her what they falsely claim she has done,\u201d Matt Clark, senior counsel for the ACLJ, told CBN News earlier this month.\n\nMs. Carter asks for an injunction against the state law, calling it unconstitutional under the Virginia statute on religious freedom.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
