final countdown as Boris Johnson races against clock for a deal", "language": "en", "text": "Boris Johnson held a series of talks last night with backbenchers and DUP leaders (Picture: PA)\n\nBoris Johnson faces a race against the clock to secure a Brexit deal and get Tory Eurosceptics and the DUP onside to back him.\n\nThe Prime Minister carried out a charm offensive in Downing Street on Tuesday evening as he held a series of talks with backbenchers and the leaders of the DUP.\n\nMeanwhile, his negotiating team worked through the night as reports increased that a deal was nearing, with a solution said to be forthcoming on the Irish border.\n\nMr Johnson knows he must have members of the European Research Group (ERG), a band of hardline Tory Eurosceptics, on board or his deal has little chance of making it through a vote in the House of Commons.\n\nIt was his predecessor Theresa May\u2019s failure to secure the ERG\u2019s support that led to her Withdrawal Agreement being defeated three times.\n\nOwen Patterson said a border down the Irish sea was \u2018unacceptable\u2019 (Picture: PA)\n\nBut, despite a flurry of meetings at Number 10, there were reports that Mr Johnson\u2019s exit terms were causing splits in the ERG.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChair Steve Baker MP, speaking outside Downing Street, said he was \u2018optimistic\u2019 that Mr Johnson\u2019s team in Brussels would finalise a \u2018tolerable deal that I will be able to vote for\u2019.\n\nBoohoo.com 'send nudes' adverts banned for objectifying women\n\nMark Francois said the meeting was \u2018interesting\u2019 and added \u2018there\u2019ll be further chats to have\u2019, while former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith and anti-EU battler Sir Bill Cash MP also emerged from Downing Street.\n\nJacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons and a former ERG chair, told LBC: \u2018I think the votes are there now for a deal.\u2019\n\nBut, in an interview with The Sun, former environment secretary Owen Paterson dubbed it \u2018unacceptable\u2019 that Mr Johnson was reportedly preparing to agree to a border down the Irish Sea, creating custom checks on goods travelling between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.\n\nThe Guardian reported senior sources on both sides of the Channel saying that a draft treaty could be published on Wednesday morning after the UK agreed in principle there will be a customs border in the Irish Sea.\n\nDUP leader Arlene foster avoided journalists outside Number Ten last night (Picture: stock image/PA)\n\nWhile still in office, Mrs May said such an arrangement could never be accepted by a British prime minister.\n\nMr Paterson said: \u2018We await the full details of the new deal to see exactly how they address the objections to the dead Theresa May deal, but dual-tariff systems like this would be, as Priti Patel has said, unacceptable.\u2019\n\nMan who filmed himself raping girl, 5, may never be released from prison\n\nThe DUP, in a statement after their second audience with the PM in as many days, were also decidedly lukewarm on the mooted proposals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018We respect the fact negotiations are ongoing and therefore cannot give a detailed commentary but it would be fair to indicate gaps remain and further work is required,\u2019 a spokesman said.\n\nLeader Arlene Foster and her deputy Nigel Dodds slipped out of the back exit of Downing Street and avoided waiting journalists following the meeting.\n\nNumber 10 officials were privately playing down suggestions of a Brussels breakthrough and the PM\u2019s decision to hold Cabinet in the late afternoon indicated that negotiators still require time to finalise a deal before Thursday\u2019s crunch European Council summit.\n\nAddressing journalists on Tuesday, the PM\u2019s official spokesman said: \u2018Talks remain constructive but there is more work still to do.\u2019\n\nMichel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, warned Mr Johnson it was \u2018high time to turn good intentions into legal text\u2019 (Picture: AP)\n\nA deal will need to be published, along with a legal text, if the EU27 are to consider ratifying the Withdrawal Agreement at their gathering this week, meaning the pressure is on to sign off on the draft agreement.\n\nMichel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, warned Mr Johnson it was \u2018high time to turn good intentions into legal text\u2019.\n\nThomas Cook CEO urged to pay \u00a3750,000 bonus to staff who lost their jobs\n\nIrish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, in a press conference in Dublin, said it remained uncertain whether a deal would be ready in time for the Brussels summit.\n\n\u2018The initial indications (from the EU) are that we are making progress, negotiations are moving in the right direction,\u2019 he told reporters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018But whether we will be able to conclude a revised Withdrawal Agreement, which is an international treaty, in time for the summit, that\u2019s as of now unclear.\u2019\n\nMr Varadkar also revealed that the PM told him during their meeting last week he was \u2018confident\u2019 he would be able to do what Theresa May thrice failed to do by getting a deal through the House of Commons.\n\nDowning Street officials are understood to have been meeting with various parliamentary factions in recent days as negotiators hammer out a deal.\n\nMr Barnier struck a positive note after meeting Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay at the General Affairs Council on Tuesday morning.\n\nHe debriefed EU27 ministers in Luxembourg before tweeting: \u2018Talks are difficult but I believe an agreement is still possible.\u2019\n\nMeanwhile, Downing Street said Mr Johnson told French president Emmanuel Macron in a phone call that UK officials would \u2018continue to work hard\u2019 on securing a Brexit deal.\n\nThe two-day EU summit is crucial because the PM must get a new deal approved by MPs by Saturday if he is to avoid a clash over asking for a Brexit delay.\n\nWoman screams 'I'm not a beast' as she's found guilty of child abuse\n\nThe Benn Act passed by MPs opposed to a no-deal, including Tory rebels, says he must ask for an extension to Article 50 if MPs do not back a deal by then.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are fears that a loophole could be used to avoid this, with the PM repeatedly ruling out making the extension request under his \u2018do or die\u2019 pledge to get Brexit done by the Halloween deadline.\n\nRegardless of the outcome in Brussels, a showdown is anticipated in an emergency sitting of Parliament on Saturday, the first in 37 years, if the Government requests the unusual move and it is backed by MPs.\n\nMr Johnson, if he intends to ask MPs to sit on Saturday, must put a motion before the Commons on Wednesday, which will be voted upon on Thursday.\n\nDuring the weekend session, they will be able to back or reject any deal presented to them, or there will be discussions on what to do next in the Brexit saga.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats have put forward an amendment to the Queen\u2019s Speech for Tuesday to test whether there is support for a second referendum.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
