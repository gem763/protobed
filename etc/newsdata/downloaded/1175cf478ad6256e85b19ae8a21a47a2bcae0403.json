In every other instance with vouchers you can usually use all the credit together.\n\n\u201cWe are now going to be left with multiples of vouchers that need to be used within 12 months with no means of being able to afford the money or the time to use them all.\u201d\n\nAfter The Independent intervened, Aer Lingus agreed to pay the couple a lump sum of \u00a3925 to allow them to book without restriction.\n\nA spokesperson for the airline said: \u201cAs stated on our website, a maximum of one voucher is permitted per transaction.\n\n\u201cEqually the voucher must be in the name of the person travelling. However we enable guests to change the name on the voucher via the \u2018Manage Voucher\u2019 function on our website.\n\n\u201cAll terms and conditions regarding Aer Lingus vouchers are detailed on aerlingus.com.\u201d\n\nWith a \u00a39 flat fee for issuing gift cards, the airline earned \u00a381 in transaction fees from selling the nine vouchers.\n\nAer Lingus\u2019s close rival, Ryanair, charges \u00a32 per voucher.
