(AP) - Chicago Bears coach Matt Nagy recalled the big slide and the bigger recovery that followed.\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs opened the 2015 season with a victory, then dropped five in a row. They didn\u2019t lose again until Tom Brady and the New England Patriots beat them in a divisional playoff game. An assistant on Andy Reid\u2019s staff at the time, Nagy is hoping for something similar in his second season in Chicago.\n\nWith three straight losses heading into a playoff rematch at Philadelphia, the Bears (3-4) look more like a team coming apart than one poised to make a run at a second straight NFC North championship. They\u2019re last in the division, 3\u00bd games behind first-place Green Bay, yet Nagy sees similarities to those Chiefs.\n\n\u201cThe No. 1 natural feeling I remember as a coach was that it\u2019s really easy to start feeling (bad), because we lost five in a row. You got a point where you felt, \u2018Man, this is challenging,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cYou put in all this time and effort, the players put in all this time and effort, and you just can\u2019t get that win.\u201d\n\nNagy remembers a team staying the course, rallying around quarterback Alex Smith and, in a flash, salvaging a season that seemed to be slipping away. The Chiefs won 10 in a row to finish the regular season, starting with a burden-lifting victory over Pittsburgh, and then took out Houston on the road in the playoffs before losing at New England.\n\nHe\u2019s banking on the Bears making a big turnaround, just like the one in Kansas City four years ago. Chicago came in with huge expectations after winning the NFC North at 12-4 in Nagy\u2019s first season. But the Bears are coming off a stinging 17-16 loss to the Los Angeles Chargers that intensified questions about the direction of the team.\n\nIt didn\u2019t matter that the defense bounced back from two subpar outings or that Bears finally committed to the run, with David Montgomery going off for a career-high 135 yards.\n\nThe struggling Trubisky played better for most of the game, throwing for 253 yards and a touchdown. But he also committed two fourth-quarter turnovers.\n\nThe offense stalled in the red zone, with one touchdown to show for five trips inside the 20. Nagy opted to have Trubisky take a knee with about 40 seconds remaining rather than try to get closer to the end zone, and Eddy Pineiro missed a 41-yard field goal wide left as time expired.\n\nIt added up to a gut-wrenching loss.\n\n\u201cYou always believe the next one is going to be a good game for you to get back on track and go in the direction where we want to go,\u201d Trubisky said. \u201cIt\u2019s just honest conversations that we\u2019re having with each other and ourselves and just trying to find ways that we could continue to improve and get better and get back on track, and the focus is on being 1-0 this week.\u201d\n\nThe Bears never lost more than two in a row last season. Back-to-back losses dropped them to 3-3, and then they went on a 9-1 run that catapulted them to the playoffs for the first time since 2010.\n\nNagy insists this year\u2019s team is capable of a breakthrough - just like last season and just like Kansas City in 2015.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m seeing is I have players coming up to me that are telling me, \u2018We\u2019ve got this, Coach.\u2019 That\u2019s all I really need, which is cool,\u201d Nagy said.\n\nLinebacker Danny Trevathan said his faith hasn\u2019t wavered in Nagy or the team.\n\n\u201cI trust him because I know the type of person he is,\u201d Trevathan said. \u201cI trust him because he put us in a good situation. He has our back. Some coaches throw you under the bus.\u201d\n\nReceiver Taylor Gabriel said, \u201cIt\u2019s just showing Nagy we have faith in him and what he\u2019s trying to accomplish, he\u2019s trying to do. Whatever he\u2019s giving to us, we\u2019re telling him that we\u2019re ready for it.\u201d\n\nNOTES: Nagy wouldn\u2019t really elaborate on comments this week by Pineiro, who said he would have preferred having the ball placed in the middle of the field rather than the left hash on his game-ending miss. \u201cWe have a communication process that we used,\u201d Nagy said. \u201cAnd we felt very comfortable in that situation with what we did.\u201d \u2026 The Bears announced longtime public address announcer Jim Riebandt will retire after the season. He has been involved with Chicago\u2019s home games since 1979 and has been the full-time PA announcer since 1982.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Chicago Bears coach Matt Nagy recalled the big slide and the bigger recovery that followed.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Andrew Seligman"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/30/chargers_bears_football_52750_c0-57-4345-2591_s1200x700.jpg?30bd5a1e25799a8adbf6dab84644ea58a4d80d50", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
