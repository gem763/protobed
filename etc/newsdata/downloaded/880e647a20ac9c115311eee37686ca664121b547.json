Tanvi Barman doesn't know the kids at first, but she said that changes quickly.\n\n\"Within an hour, they're holding my hands, they're tugging on my sleeve, and they really trust me,\" she said.\n\nSome of the children have never had a birthday celebration before. CBS News attended one recent party Barman threw for two children, including 1-year-old Tianah.\n\nTanvi Barman hosts birthday parties for children in homeless shelters.
