The \u201cLet\u2019s Be Honest\u201d campaign will share original content with real stories from American families who talk about their personal struggles to make ends meet, promote news stories and facts, and respond to individuals\u2019 concerns about keeping their heads above water in this economy.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s Be Honest\u201d comes as the latest stage of Priorities\u2019 previously announced $100 million investment beginning in Wisconsin, Florida, Pennsylvania, and Michigan. The campaign will launch today and will continue through 2020, creating an integrated ecosystem where individuals browsing Facebook or YouTube, reading news articles, and searching Google will see a variety of pieces of content that work in conjunction with each other to help working families understand that they are not alone in their financial struggles in Trump\u2019s economy. The ecosystem will present these stories by sharing testimonials, statistics, and news articles, making both emotional and factual appeals to viewers to better inform them about the effect these policies are having on them, their communities, and their country.\n\nExamples of the ads can be found here, here, here, and here.\n\n\u201cThere is a disconnect between the rhetoric coming from the White House, the economic headlines covered on cable news, and the real life economic challenges American families are facing across the country. It\u2019s time to be honest about the financial anxiety millions of families are feeling and why: it\u2019s because time and time again, Trump has shown that his only concern is making sure corporations get richer,\u201d said Guy Cecil, Chairman of Priorities USA. \u201cPeople feel like no matter how hard they work, they just can\u2019t get ahead, and Priorities USA is committed to making sure Americans hear that truth. This ad campaign will meet Americans where they are, sharing the stories of people like them facing daunting economic challenges in their daily lives at a time when this administration is prioritizing the rich and big corporations at the expense of everyone else.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://priorities.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Priorities_share.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
