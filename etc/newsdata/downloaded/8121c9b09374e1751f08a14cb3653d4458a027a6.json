The move also authorizes Durham to impanel a grand jury and file charges.\n\n\u201cIf true, this shows Bill Barr is doing EXACTLY his job: following the facts Those who damaged America and broke the law to spread this hoax are about to face accountability,\u201d Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC) tweeted in response to the Times\u2019 report.\n\nThe development comes after an NBC report revealed Barr recently expanded his agency\u2019s review, noting that Durham has \u201cfound something significant and critics should be careful.\u201d As part of the inquiry, Durham has sought interviews with CIA analysts who assessed Russia\u2019s activities during the 2016 presidential election, prompting some of them to hire lawyers, NBC News stated.\n\nDurham has been tasked with determining whether the Justice Department, FBI and intelligence authorities improperly surveilled the 2016 Trump campaign as part of their investigation into now-debunked coordination with Russia during the last presidential election. Special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation found insufficient evidence of a criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia.\n\nThe hard-nosed U.S. attorney has reportedly received briefings on the \u201cfour corners\u201d of the FBI\u2019s use of Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrants as part of its controversial counterintelligence operation into the Trump campaign. \u201cDurham is specifically reviewing the FISA warrant obtained by the FBI to surveil former Trump aide Carter Page, as well as general issues relating to surveillance during the 2016 campaign and matters flowing from the FISA process,\u201d Fox News reported.\n\nThe FBI used the Steele dossier to obtain a FISA warrant to surveil Carter Page, but did not disclose to the FISA court that Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign or the Democrat National Committee (DNC) funded the dossier, despite indicating that the dossier was compiled as opposition research. Barr has described the dossier as \u201copposition research\u201d with \u201cclear mistakes.\u201d\n\nTestifying before Congress in May, Barr told lawmakers he believed \u201cspying did occur\u201d on the Trump campaign, but stopped short of saying whether it was done improperly.\n\n\u201cI think spying on a political campaign is a big deal,\u201d he told the Senate Appropriations Committee, before adding, \u201cI am not suggesting that those rules were violated, but I think it\u2019s important to look at them.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly said his campaign was illegally surveilled and has even accused officials of treason. \u201cMy Campaign for President was conclusively spied on,\u201d the president wrote on Twitter in May. \u201cNothing like this has ever happened in American Politics. A really bad situation. TREASON means long jail sentences, and this was TREASON!\u201d\n\nThe Justice Department declined to comment on the Times\u2019 report.", "description": "The Justice Department's sweeping review into the origins of its Russia probe is now a criminal investigation, according to reports.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/05/William-Barr-salute-ap-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
