Erik Raney said.\n\nThe warrants served shortly after 9 a.m. are \u201ca pretty standard\u201d part of the ongoing investigation into the tragedy to determine whether any crimes were committed, he said. The office was ringed in red \u201ccrime scene\u201d tape as more than a dozen agents took photos and carried out boxes.\n\nThirty-four people died when the Conception burned and sank before dawn on Sept. 2. They were sleeping in a cramped bunkroom below the main deck and their escape routes were blocked by fire.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

The search for the final body was suspended this weekend because of strong winds and rough seas, Raney said.\n\n\u201cThe dive teams are going to get together Monday to develop a plan. We\u2019re hoping they\u2019re back in the water on Tuesday,\u201d he said Sunday.\n\nCoast Guard records show the Conception passed its two most recent inspections with no safety violations. Previous customers said Truth Aquatics and the captains of its three boats were very safety conscious.\n\nAuthorities are focused on determining the cause of the fire and are looking at many things, including how batteries and electronics were stored and charged. They will also look into how the crew was trained and what crewmembers were doing at the time of the fire. The boat\u2019s design will also come under scrutiny, particularly whether a bunkroom escape hatch was adequate.\n\nFive crew members jumped overboard after trying to rescue the 33 scuba divers and one crew member whose escape routes were blocked by fire, federal authorities and the boat\u2019s owner said. The crew, including the captain, said they were driven back by flames, smoke and heat.\n\nThey jumped from the bridge area to the main deck \u2014 one breaking a leg in the effort \u2014 and tried to get through the double doors of the galley, which were on fire.\n\nThat cut off both escape routes from the sleeping quarters: a stairway and an escape hatch that exited in the galley area. The crew then tried, but failed, to get into windows at the front of the vessel.\n\nTruth Aquatics pre-emptively filed a lawsuit Thursday under a pre-Civil War provision of maritime law that could protect it from potentially costly payouts to families of the dead, a move condemned by some observers as disrespectful and callous.\n\nThe company said in a statement posted Friday on Instagram that the lawsuit is an \u201cunfortunate side of these tragedies\u201d and pinned the action on insurance companies and other so-called stakeholders.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Authorities served search warrants Sunday at the Southern California company that owned the scuba boat that caught fire, killing 34 people.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/california-boat-fire-search-warrant.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
