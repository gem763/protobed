When these people run out of hope, they break, and they're going to break... they're going to leave... they're going to lose themselves,' Jones said of the farmers.\n\nJones said he hopes that Mr Morrison will begin to start looking after his own backyard, before choking up and becoming emotional while talking about his father.\n\n'We will fight because I have been exactly where the people of Bourke are. My old man would be ashamed of me if I didn't fight,' he said.\n\n'I can't speak for Canberra,' Mr Jones said, fighting back tears, before he told producers to cut to an ad break.\n\nAlan Jones has broken down on live television as he vows to fight for drought-stricken farmers after his row with Scott Morrison (pictured) about drought relief\n\nAlan Jones broke down on live television after discussing the drought (pictured) and row with Scott Morrison\n\nWhen the show returned, Jones apologised before further criticising Mr Morrison's slow response to drought relief.\n\nJones said that politicians have never been where the farmers have been, before he warned Mr Morrison that he could be facing political fallout.\n\nThe row between the radio host and prime minister took place on Tuesday morning, with loyal voters turning on Mr Morrison.\n\nIn one particularly heated moment, the radio host interrupted Mr Morrison and bluntly told him: 'Oh don't talk to me, I'm a farmer's son and you're not.'\n\nAfter the interview Jones was overrun with calls from listeners, many of whom voted Liberal, as they lined up to slam the Prime Minster, calling him 'arrogant' and a 'waste of space'.\n\nThe radio host appeared on Sky News on Tuesday night where he was discussing how he has been overrun with calls from emotional farmers who praised him for taking on the nation's leader\n\nA fired-up Jones was urging the PM to do more to help farmers who cannot afford feed and water to keep livestock alive.\n\n'These people, Prime Minister, cannot survive today,' Jones said angrily.\n\n'They are sending the breeding stock to the sale yard to be slaughtered, they're walking off their farms. They need cash now. Now. Just as we gave a billion dollars to Indonesia over a tsunami. This is a drought tsunami.'\n\nMr Morrison explained that he couldn't make it rain and that $318million has already helped in the past year.\n\nHow does that feed a cow? Jones repeatedly asked the PM\n\n'The direct cash grant support is going into farming communities, including directly to farmers,' Mr Morrison said.\n\nBut Jones interrupted, saying: 'They're not getting it!'\n\nMr Morrison continued: 'Alan, if you could let me finish. There's $318.5 million...'\n\n'I don't know where the money is Prime Minister,' Jones interjected.\n\nAs Mr Morrison tried to make his point, Jones cut in with a blunt remark: 'Oh don't talk to me, I'm a farmer's son and you're not.'\n\nMr Morrison continued trying to explain how aid has helped while a frustrated Jones kept interjecting and asking: 'How does that feed a cow?'\n\nMr Jones said he hopes that Mr Morrison will begin to start looking after his own backyard before choking up and becoming emotional while talking about his father\n\nJones then criticised the Farm Household Allowance scheme, which gives farmers fortnightly payments and, in some cases, lump sum payments of up to $12,000.\n\n'You say Farm Household Allowance. Now PM, come on. You go and tell Jenny that she can live on $250 a week,' Jones said.\n\n'It's not $250 a week Alan. It's not just that,' Mr Morrison replied.\n\n'If you live in the city, and your business goes bust or you lose your job, then you have access to Newstart. But if you are on a farm property and you get access to the Farm Household Allowance.'\n\nJones did not accept his answer and pressed the PM further by asking: 'Why are they walking off? Why are they sending their cattle to slaughter?'\n\n'Because of the drought, that's why,' said the PM.\n\nMr Morrison then admitted he couldn't save farmers from some hardship.\n\nJones (pictured) angrily interrupted the PM several times during the interview\n\n'The government, whether it's state, federal or anyone else, we can do a lot of things to try and help people get through this. But the government can't make it rain, and it can't make life as it was before the drought,' he said.\n\n'We both want the same thing. We want the farmers to be able to get through this drought. But we can't kid ourselves that there's a magic wand and a magic cash splash that's going to make this thing totally solved.'\n\nAt times during the interview, Jones became exasperated as he repeatedly interrupted the Prime Minister and sighed and tutted when Mr Morrison spoke.\n\nDespite Jones' combative stance, 2GB listeners said they were disappointed by the Prime Minister.\n\nOne named Robert said: 'My blood's boiling after hearing that. Complete failure as a Prime Minister. He's arrogant. They've been conning the public after the election.'\n\nAnother named Michelle added: 'I'm a dairy farmer's daughter. That interview should sign the end of his Prime Ministership. Just absolutely diabolical.'\n\nOne listener named Chris said: 'Today we've nailed him to a post. He's a failure.'\n\nSome of the 2GB listeners said they had voted for Mr Morrison in the election in May, bringing him victory against the odds for which he credited 'quiet Australians'.\n\nHe was referring to rural, regional and older Australians who go about their business without making a fuss or sharing their opinions before polling day.\n\nAn aerial view of a severely drought affected farm 40km north-east of Coonabarabran, NSW\n\nListeners' responses to the PM Mr Morrison defended the aid package to farmers which includes money for counselling. One caller said there would be no mental health issues if farmers could afford to keep breeding stock alive. One named Robert said: 'My blood's boiling after hearing that. Complete failure as a Prime Minister. He's arrogant. They've been conning the public after the election.' Another named Michelle added: 'I'm a dairy farmer's daughter. That interview should sign the end of his Prime Ministership. Just absolutely diabolical.' One listener named Chris said: 'Today we've nailed him to a post. He's a failure.'\n\nThe tense interview came after Mr Morrison was in Tamworth on Sunday with Premier Gladys Berejiklian to announce a $1billion investment in dams and water infrastructure projects around New South Wales.\n\nThe 50/50 investment includes a $480million new Dungowan Dam near Tamworth, along with a a $650million upgrade of Wyangala Dam in the NSW Central West.\n\n'I love working with premiers that want to build dams,' a beaming prime minister told reporters.\n\n'And not just say they want to do it but are actually going to do it and roll-up their sleeves and ensure that we can get these built.'\n\nSuch infrastructure will aid regional and rural communities build drought resistance into the future.\n\nThe joint venture will also help free-up NSW funding to allow progress for critical town water projects across the state.\n\n'We want to get these projects underway because this is about water supply and security,' Mr Morrison said.\n\n'These projects don't happen overnight but we're working as quickly as possible to get all the necessary work done so we can start digging.'\n\nMs Berejiklian estimated the new dam will take about four years to build.\n\nThere will also be an initial $24 million 50/50 investment for the proposed 100,000-megalitre Border Rivers project on the Mole River, near the Queensland border.\n\nA boat ramp leads to the drought-affected Split Rock Dam near Tamworth in rural Australia\n\n'I'm a farmer's son and you're not': Jones slams ScoMo: A transcript PRIME MINISTER: You've asked me to come on the programme and I'm happy to do it, love to, and let me tell you where that $318 million goes. There was a $129.5 million which was extending the Farm Household Allowance. JONES: $250 a week. PRIME MINISTER: There was $5 million in rural financial counselling services. JONES: Counselling. PRIME MINISTER: There was $115.8 million that went directly into communities, drought communities, into individual shires, a million dollars in each. JONES: PM, how does that feed a cow? PM, how does that feed a cow? PRIME MINISTER: I'd like to answer you\u2026 JONES: How does that feed a cow, PM? PRIME MINISTER: And I'm sure your listeners would like to know where that $300 million-plus has gone in the past year. $15 million to help them with looking after the pests and weeds on their property. There's... JONES: How does that feed a cow? How does that feed a cow? PRIME MINISTER: Alan, if you've got pests and weeds which are running\u2026 JONES: Oh, PM, don't talk to me. I'm a farmer's son, you're not. PRIME MINISTER: Farmers are telling us directly, Alan. And as you know, the fodder subsidies and the freight subsidies are provided by state governments. That's part of the National Drought Agreement. JONES: They can't afford their component of the subsidy, they can't afford it. PRIME MINISTER: Alan, what I'm telling you is that the fodder subsidies and the freight subsidies are handled by state governments. The direct financial\u2026 JONES: I know, it's a national disaster, PM. Take over the whole show. Why don't you take over the whole show? It's a national disaster. You say Farm Household Allowance. Now, PM, come on. You go and tell Jenny that she can live on 250 bucks a week. They get $250 a week. PRIME MINISTER: It's not just $250 a week, Alan. JONES: It's $250 a week. PRIME MINISTER: It's not just that because unlike any other form of income support in the country... if you live in the city and your business goes bust or you lose your job, then you have access to Newstart and that's available to everybody across the country. JONES: How does that feed a cow and to keep it alive? PRIME MINISTER: But if you are on a farm property and you are a farmer or a grazier you get access during drought periods, and not just in drought periods, to the Farm Household Allowance. JONES: Well, PM, why are they walking off? Why are they walking off? Why are they sending their cattle to slaughter? If we lose the breeding stock\u2026 PRIME MINISTER: Because it's a drought, Alan, that's why. JONES: Well, how can you make sure we don't send our breeding stock to slaughter? PRIME MINISTER: Alan, there is... the government, whether it's state, federal or anyone else, we can do a lot of things to help people try and get through this. But the government cannot make it rain. And the government can't make life as it was before the drought. And if anyone is suggesting that could be done then they are lying to the people of rural and regional Australia.\n\nOpposition Leader Anthony Albanese was unimpressed by such promises after six years of federal coalition governments.\n\n'Tony Abbott's come and gone, Malcolm Turnbull's come and gone, Barnaby Joyce's come and gone, Scott Morrison's there, they haven't dug a hole yet,' Mr Albanese told reporters in Sydney.\n\nWe can't kid ourselves that there's a magic wand and a magic cash splash that's going to make this thing totally solved Mr Morrison on the drought\n\n'Well wait and see what happens.What I do know is that this government has no national drought strategy.'\n\nThe Nature Conservation Council also warned the NSW government to retain thorough assessment of water infrastructure projects to avoid ecological catastrophes, like the mass fish kills earlier this year.\n\n'We need thorough assessment of water infrastructure projects now more than ever to ensure we don't make matters worse,' the council's chief executive Chris Gambian said in a statement.\n\n'The problems we are facing today are a direct result of this government refusing to listen to its own planning experts, who warned of this looming water crisis six years ago.'", "description": "Alan Jones appeared on Sky News on Tuesday where he discussed how he has been overrun with calls from emotional Australian farmers and broke down in emotional segment.", "authors": ["Lauren Ferri", "Charlie Moore For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/11/19735578-0-image-a-26_1571135554170.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
