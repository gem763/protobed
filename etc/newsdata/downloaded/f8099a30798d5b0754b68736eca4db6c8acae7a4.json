These messages indicate that Boeing withheld damning information from the FAA, which is highly disturbing,\u201d DeFazio wrote to Chao.\n\nHe went on to request the Transportation Department immediately send unredacted email exchanges between employees to his committee, saying it is \u201cunacceptable\u201d that his panel is just now finding out about the messages.\n\nThe messages between the employees raised eyebrows because of the blunt assessment of their concerns over the jet\u2019s systems.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s running rampant in the sim,\u201d a pilot reportedly wrote in a message to a colleague, referencing the automated system. The pilot added that while he wasn't great at flying, the system was \"egregious.\"\n\nThe Boeing 737 Max has been grounded since March, and the FAA has maintained that there is no \u201cprescribed timeline\" for returning it to passenger service.\n\n\u201cAs I have said repeatedly throughout the course of my Committee\u2019s investigation, it is imperative that we get answers as to what went wrong, resulting in the two crashes and the deaths of 346 people. On behalf of the victims and their loved ones, as well as the entire flying public, safety must always be the priority. I expect your full cooperation going forward,\u201d DeFazio wrote.", "description": "Rep.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/chaoelaine_091919gn3_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
