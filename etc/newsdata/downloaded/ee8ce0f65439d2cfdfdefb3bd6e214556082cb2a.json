Surfing. Streets, coolest sport? Skateboarding. Outdoor coolest sport? Climbing.\n\n\u201cSo suddenly, in one giant stroke they add the three environments; the outdoor, the ocean and urban. It will be the single most important program change in decades, probably ever.\u201d\n\nInstead of leaning on the experience of established Olympic sports in preparing for Tokyo 2020, Aguerre thinks some of the traditional disciplines could learn a thing or two from surfing, which has also been provisionally included in the program for Paris 2024.\n\n\u201cThe old sports need to adapt,\u201d said Aguerre. \u201c(IOC) President (Thomas) Bach is very clear about that from the first speech he made when he accepted his election he said \u2018change or be changed.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThe evolution of the species is one of those that change... or the ones that didn\u2019t change that are nowhere to be found.\u201d\n\nSome sports, including badminton, taekwondo and modern pentathlon, have come under pressure to justify their inclusion in the Olympics while question marks hang over the futures of weightlifting and boxing due to financial irregularities and doping scandals.\n\nAguerre pushed hard for an Olympic slot after becoming ISA chief in 1994 but the seeds were sown 80 years earlier when surfing pioneer and Olympic gold medalist swimmer Duke Kahanamoku first proposed its inclusion at Stockholm 1912.\n\nYet it was not until Argentine Aguerre had a discussion with then-IOC presidential candidate Bach in 2013 that things began to gain traction.\n\nThree years later in Rio de Janeiro, Aguerre finally got the news he had been hoping for.\n\n\u201cIt is something that I dreamed about for many, many, many years,\u201d said a beaming Aguerre. \u201cIt was very hard. Basically it seemed impossible for a couple of decades and then suddenly a set came and we were in the right place to paddle and catch that Olympic wave.\u201d\n\nWhile it took a long time for surfing to get on the Olympic program, Aguerre puts it down to the carefree nature of the sport.\n\nOn the evening of the vote in Rio three years ago, a journalist asked him why it had taken 100 years to get surfing into the Olympics.\n\n\"My answer is: \u2018maybe we were busy surfing,'\u201d Aguerre laughed.\n\n\u201cIt is true, it sounds like a joke but in reality we are surfers. We are not really an organized sport to the point where you need fields, gloves, memberships, lockers, we don\u2019t have anything. Basically you arrive at the beach, wrap ourselves in a towel, put on a wetsuit if it is cold, get on the beach and then go.\u201d\n\n\u00a9 (c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2019.", "description": "As \"cool\" sports such as surfing, skateboarding and climbing prepare to make their Olympic debut in Tokyo, the president of surfing's governing body has told Reuters that more traditional sports must adapt or face being dropped from the Games.
