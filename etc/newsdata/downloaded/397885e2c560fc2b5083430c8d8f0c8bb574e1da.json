I'll keep you out of Europe, out of the next European war. And a sense of the other in American life. In that book, it's American Jewry, American Jews, that are the worrisome other that he uses as kindling for a dry run at fascism.\u201d\n\nSimon compared Trump\u2019s political approach to that of Lindbergh\u2019s character in the book.\n\n\u201cThere's a very simple message that Trump used effectively to outrun the party system,\u201d he says. \u201cNow the other is people of color, immigrants, people who are not white, people who are not straight, people who are a little bit off of what previous generations of Americans might have called \u2018normal, white America,\u2019 you know, and all that that phrase entails.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo there's a very real reason to do \u2018The Plot Against America\u2019 now,\u201d Simon adds.\n\nThe premise of the show may remind viewers of \u201cThe Man in the High Castle,\u201d a program on Amazon Prime (AMZN) that adapted the 1962 novel of that name by Philip K. Dick. The novel and show take place decades after Japan and Germany have defeated the United States in World War II, the latter country becoming a fascist vassal split between the victors. Hulu\u2019s adaptation of Atwood\u2019s \u201cA Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d similarly depicts U.S. territory under an authoritarian regime.\n\nSimon is best known for creating the HBO show \u201cThe Wire,\u201d which ran for five seasons in the mid-2000s. His other shows include \u201cTreme,\u201d \u201cShow Me a Hero,\u201d and most recently \u201cThe Deuce,\u201d starring James Franco and Maggie Gyllenhaal. Simon won an Emmy in 2000 and has been nominated for four since. He previously worked as a journalist for the Baltimore Sun and is the author of \u201cHomicide: A Year on the Killing Streets,\u201d which chronicles his year with detectives from the homicide unit of Baltimore\u2019s police department.\n\nSimon made the comments during a conversation that aired in an episode of Yahoo Finance\u2019s \u201cInfluencers with Andy Serwer,\u201d a weekly interview series with leaders in business, politics, and entertainment.\n\nTelevision writer and producer David Simon appears on Influencers with Andy Serwer. More\n\n\u2018There is an ethic of how you have to behave\u2019\n\nAfter criticizing Trump, Simon said he believes the president should be impeached, though he acknowledged it may face political hurdles.\n\n\u201cWhether it's successful or not, whether it's politically viable or not, there is an ethic of how you have to behave and what rules have to apply if the American republic is going to survive,\u201d Simon says.\n\n\u201cIf you say this doesn't merit the response of the other branch of government to assert for the Constitution and for what the Constitution says fundamentally, then that document's meaningless. And the construct, the checks and balances of the republic, have been rendered moot.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "David Simon's new show is based on \u201cThe Plot Against America,\u201d a work of alternative history by the late Philip Roth that depicts the emergence of a proto-fascist America after the election of aviator and isolationist Charles Lindbergh", "authors": ["Max Zahn"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/T.SiESe4Uld568ntVz95jA--~B/aD0xNTEyO3c9MjM3OTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/6246ae60-f61b-11e9-b1ff-8f34c97d9086", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
