Ride hailing app Uber was valued at nearly $75.5 billion when it went public in May.\n\nWhen companies went public in the 1990s and early 2000s, many of them were worth only a fraction of those sky-high valuations nowadays, said Case \u2014 who now runs the Washington, D.C.-based venture firm Revolution, which he co-founded in 2005. He's also chairman of the philanthropic Case Foundation, which he established with his wife Jean in 1997.\n\n\"When AOL went public in 1992, it was the first internet company to go public, we raised $10 million, and the valuation that day was $70 million,\" Case recalled. \"When Amazon went public, it was $300 million. I think Microsoft was about $300 million. Now they're waiting until they're five or $10 [billion] or $20 billion.\"\n\nThe billionaire Case, who now looks to partner with entrepreneurs through Revolution, argued, \"The upside, in terms of IPOs, of 20 years ago is not there today.\"", "description": "\"The upside, in terms of IPOs of 20 years ago, is not there today,\" says the AOL co-founder Steve Case.", "authors": ["Jessica Bursztynsky"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/103557182-Steve_Case_c.jpg?v=1461005729", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
