Whooping cough, medically known as pertussis, causes coughing bouts which can last for up several months. It is spread through sneezes, and the first symptoms are often a runny nose, watery eyes and sore throat. The infection has its name because between coughs children can make a 'whoop' sound when they gasp for breath, the NHS says. Complications of whooping cough can include breathing difficulties, weight loss, brain damage and even death, in some cases. Complications of whooping cough can include breathing difficulties, weight loss, brain damage and even death, in some cases\n\nProfessor Read, director of the NIHR Southampton Biomedical Research Centre, said: 'The study showed that the bacterium which causes whooping cough can lurk silently in the nose and throat of even healthy members of the community.\n\n'This is extremely important as it explains why we are seeing episodic outbreaks of whooping cough throughout the world, with serious disease occurring in those people who are not vaccinated or who had their vaccines a long time ago.'\n\nThere were 25,891 cases of whooping cough diagnosed in the UK between 2012 and 2018 compared to 6,216 between 2005 and 2011 \u2013 a four-fold increase, according to UHS.\n\nExperts blame the rising number of cases on growing anti-vaccination sentiments and a relatively new jab being less effective than its predecessor.\n\nA UHS spokesman said: 'Adults suffer a milder form of the disease compared to young children but can still have an unpleasant cough for up to three months, while babies under the age of six months can be vulnerable to severe and life-threatening complications.\n\n'Although a vaccine is offered to all babies in the UK \u2013 where 18 have died as a result of the infection since 2012 \u2013 it does not offer lifelong protection and is now less effective than it was 15 years ago.\n\n'This is why the Southampton discovery is so significant \u2013 it means the bacteria can spread from person to person, silently, and cause disease in those who are not immune, including babies, and those not vaccinated.'\n\nThe study, which involved academics from 22 institutions across 11 countries, was published in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases.\n\nWhooping cough is spread through sneezes, and the first symptoms are often a runny nose, watery eyes and sore throat.\n\nThe infection has its name because between coughs children can make a 'whoop' sound when they gasp for breath, the NHS says.\n\nComplications of whooping cough can include breathing difficulties, weight loss, brain damage and even death, in some cases.\n\nThe youngest babies \u2013 between birth and three months \u2013 are at the highest risk of being admitted to intensive care or dying.", "description": "The hiding bacteria means people can unknowingly transmit the infection to other people leading to sporadic outbreaks of the condition, according to medics at University Hospital Southampton.", "authors": ["Stephen Matthews Health Editor For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/10/20076774-0-image-a-3_1571824490023.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
