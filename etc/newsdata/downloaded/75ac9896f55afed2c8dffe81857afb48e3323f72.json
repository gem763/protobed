In Brussels, police used water cannon on Saturday to disperse hundreds of Extinction Rebellion activists gathered in a square.\n\nPolice ordered a halt to all of the group\u2019s protests in London on Monday, saying those who did not comply would be arrested. They have already made around 1,500 arrests over the past eight days, including more than 90 at a day of actions in the British capital\u2019s financial district on Monday.\n\nMore than 1,400 people have been arrested in 20 cities in other countries, Extinction Rebellion said.\n\nCo-founder of the Extinction Rebellion group, Gail Bradbrook, sits atop the doorway into the Department of Transport, during an Extinction Rebellion protest in London, Britain, October 15, 2019. REUTERS/Henry Nicholls\n\nThe British government reinforced the police call on it to stop. \u201cWhile we share people\u2019s concerns about global warming, and respect the right to peaceful protest, it should not disrupt people\u2019s day-to-day lives,\u201d a government spokeswoman said.\n\nThe activists oppose plans to run the HS2 rail project through ancient woodlands. The ministry says the rail line will slash journey times between central and northern England and the capital and be much more efficient in carbon terms than driving.\n\nThe project is billions of pounds over budget and running late and an independent review is considering whether it should go ahead.\n\nAn activist who tried to lock herself to the ministry said the project would be a \u201cscar across the belly of this land\u201d destroying vital habitats for barn owls, bees and birds.\n\n\u201cEverybody who is not paying attention is numb at the moment. We all use tactics to numb ourselves because this is scary,\u201d said the woman, who gave her name as April, before she was taken away in a police van.\n\nLater, police began arresting Extinction Rebellion activists who had assembled to block a road running past the headquarters of the MI5 security service to highlight the risks climate change poses to food security, a Reuters witness said.\n\n\u201cA significant policing operation continues and we will take robust action against anyone engaged in unlawful protests at locations targeted by Extinction Rebellion,\u201d London police\u2019s Deputy Assistant Commissioner Laurence Taylor said.\n\nExtinction Rebellion said HS2 would damage or destroy 108 ancient woodlands in the largest single act of deforestation in Britain since World War One.\n\nSlideshow (7 Images)\n\nThe transport ministry said 7 million new trees and shrubs, including over 40 native species specific to each location will be planted as part of the programme.\n\nSupporters say HS2 would give Britain the kind of fast rail services enjoyed by other major countries. Current estimates predict it will cost around 88 billion pounds ($111.5 billion).", "description": "Climate change activists, including one of the founders of Extinction Rebellion, defied a police order to end protests on Tuesday after a week of disruption in London, targeting Britain's transport ministry and security agency MI5.", "authors": ["Matthew Green", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1441110713&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E0DT", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
