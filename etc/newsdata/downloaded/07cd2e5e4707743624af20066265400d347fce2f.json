Not something to be proud of to the say the least.\n\nWe as a nation boast all the time about our immense development and technological advancement and yet we fail to feed our own population. Forget combating global hunger by 2030, India has to resolve its national hunger problem which otherwise will pose a unique crisis of its own.\n\nReuters\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's talk numbers now. Almost 194 million Indians go hungry everyday, 67 lakh tons of food is wasted in our country every year worth a whopping 92,000 crores.\n\nSo clearly, availability of food isn't an issue but wastage of food that could have come to good use considering India's malnourished children is a big problem. And that's why we need to come together and curb habits. Below, you'll get to know all the simple ways that will enable us to reduce food wastage.\n\n1. Keep a check how many groceries you're buying.\n\nUnsplash\n\nDon't Miss 1 K SHARES 121 SHARES 215 SHARES 158 SHARES\n\nYes, a stocked fridge and kitchen provides immense comfort but rarely do we eat everything we buy. Instead, choose to buy grocery weekly or even alternate week, that way, you are buying only what you need and replenishing all that is over. It's essential to plan meals in such a way that you consume exactly what is bought.\n\n2. Stop ordering food from outside when you have food at home.\n\nInstagram\n\nWe have all been there done that. Just because we don't like what's made at home, we order from outside. Please stop. Eat what is made at home, this will help you reduce your personal food wastage exceptionally.\n\n3. Store smartly.\n\nUnsplash\n\nProper food storage can increase food shelf life exponentially. Use air-tight containers for most foods and ensure your fridge is set on the correct temperature. Proper storage will keep food fresh for longer making it usable for for longer and for more meals.\n\n4. Don't discard fruits and vegetables because they look ugly.\n\nPexels\n\nWe always want the most good looking bunch of bananas and spinach that isn't rotten. And anything that might have the slightest black marks, we are quick to discard those food items. Most of the time, only the skin is ruined and the vegetable or fruit is perfectly okay from inside. Please make a thorough inspection before throwing away unused items.\n\n5. Use those food items that won't be good after 72 hours FIRST.\n\nUnsplash\n\nI have always seen my mom do this. Before you start cooking something for yourself or your family, it's advisable to segregate ingredients that you won't be able to consumer 72 hours later. Using those segregated ingredients, whip up a nice meal. That way you are saving money and reducing good wastage.\n\n6. Restaurants should start charging customers for wasting food.\n\nReuters\n\nIt's hilarious how we waste the food we pay for. It makes no sense. In order to discourage people from ordering more than they can consume, restaurants should charging customers extra for wasting food. Since money is the only source of hurting us the most, consumers will become conscious of what and how much they order.\n\n7. Instead of a next big purchase, choose to feed the poor.\n\nReuters\n\nWe all are always saving up for something or the other right? A brand new car, house or just shoes. Instead of all of that, you can choose to feed atleast 50-100 people who sleep on an empty stomach every night. Imagine all the good deed you will be spreading and the blessings you will get.\n\n8. Use leftovers wisely!\n\nPexels\n\nThere is absolutely no shame in eating left-over food. You can come up with unique ways of using left-overs. You can make a lot of dishes from leftovers. For instance, using leftover fruits for a quick smoothie or juice the next morning. Or using leftover veggies to make a pizza by adding cheese and layering it on a pizza base or dough. Leftover dal makes for great dal parathas the whole family can enjoy.\n\n9. Freeze.\n\nUnsplash\n\nFreezing anything and everything instantly increases the food item's shelf space. So instead of mindlessly throwing leftovers or food away, it makes sense to freeze food in proper storage and keep consuming as required.\n\n10. Get in to the habit of drinking soups.\n\nPexels\n\nThis is for those who are super lazy and for those who always buy a lot more than they intended. Whatever ingredients are left, throw them in boiling water and make soup out of it. Soup fills you up and has way lesser calories than a proper dinner.\n\n11. Just because you can't eat it, doesn't mean it's of no value.\n\nUnsplash\n\nIf vegetables and fruits in your fridge go bad, you can literally use them on your face. Rubbing slices of potato gives a nice glow to your face. Egg yolk makes for a great hair pack. Sugar mixed with honey is really good for lightening your elbows. Next time you have any vegetables or fruits lying idle in your fridge, just search for what you can do with them and your skin will be thanking you later.\n\n12. Understand expiration dates.\n\nReuters\n\nMost food products will last much longer than the specified date. All of this is a marketing gimmick. \u201cUse by,\u201d \u201cbest by,\u201d \u201cenjoy by\u201d \u2014 these are generally not expiration dates but suggestions as to when the product is at its freshest.\n\n13. When hosting, keep fewer food options.\n\nPexels\n\nWe are so done with judging people when they choose to serve less food. It's sensible. Two or three dishes are enough for any party.", "description": "Let's talk numbers now.
