Where is the server? I want to see the server.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump speaks to reporters in the Oval Office on Wednesday as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo looks on.

According to CNN, the FBI \u201clooked at the imaged copies of the DNC \u2014 essentially an electronic copy of everything that was on the server\u201d and determined that Moscow was behind the hack. The fact that investigators never looked at the physical server has led some conspiracy theorists, and now the president, to suggest foul play.\n\nThe president claimed \u201cthey say\u201d the server \u201cis being held by a company owned by an individual who is from Ukraine.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u201d would appear to be wrong. CrowdStrike, a U.S. cybersecurity firm that helped the DNC conduct the investigation, was referenced by Trump during his call with Zelensky. Fringe conspiracy theorists have falsely claimed that CrowdStrike\u2019s founder, Dmitri Alperovitch, is Ukrainian and would therefore have a motive to blame the hack on Russia. But Alperovitch is not Ukrainian; he is a Russian-born U.S. citizen.\n\nIn an interview with ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week With George Stephanopoulos\u201d in late September, Tom Bossert, who served as Trump\u2019s first homeland security adviser, said he and his staff repeatedly told the president there was no basis to the theory that Ukraine, not Russia, intervened in the 2016 election.\n\n\u201cIt is completely debunked,\u201d Bossert said. \u201cI am deeply frustrated with what he and the legal team is doing and repeating that debunked theory to the president. It sticks in his mind when he hears it over and over again, and for clarity here, George, let me just again repeat that it has no validity.\u201d\n\n_____\n\nDownload the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:", "description": "President Trump on Wednesday sought to advance the Ukraine conspiracy theory that his aides had warned him repeatedly was \u201ccompletely debunked.\u201d", "authors": ["Dylan Stableford", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/7L_8ut1bDRLL_aekyxR21g--~B/aD0zNDg0O3c9NTIyNjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/d6c43180-f02c-11e9-b697-606967afdaff", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
