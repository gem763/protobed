Who knows whether it will happen or not [winning a title], I\u2019m still quite weak in areas. Mark\u2019s safety was fantastic today, every time I came to the table I seemed to be snookered or on the top cush.\u2019\n\nOne person who is convinced that Gilbert will get his hands on a trophy is Selby who rates the Angry Farmer extremely highly as a player and as a person.\n\n\u2018To play Dave in the final is an absolute privilege. It\u2019s only a matter of time for him, you can\u2019t be as good as him and not win tournaments, I would expect him to win one this year and then the floodgates will open and he\u2019ll win many more.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m pleased for myself but gutted for him at the same time because he\u2019s a great, great player and an even better lad off the table.\n\n\u2018If I wasn\u2019t in the final I\u2019d have been rooting for him or come back up here to support him, that\u2019s how much I like the kid.\n\n\u2018So, gutted for him, but he keeps knocking on the door, semi-finals of the Worlds, four ranking finals, it\u2019s only a matter of time until he turns that runner-up spot into a win, and when he does do that I think he\u2019ll win a lot more.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSelby and Gilbert will both be back in action at the World Open which begins on 28 October in Yushan.\n\nThat was the scene of Gilbert\u2019s most heartbreaking defeat last year, when he lost the final 10-9 to Mark Williams having led 9-5 against the three-time world champion.\n\nMORE: Mark Selby\u2019s English Open win is likely the performance of the season, reckons Ronnie O\u2019Sullivan\n\nMORE: Mark Selby annihilates David Gilbert in English Open final to claim first title in over a year", "description": "David Gilbert had no complaints after being shown an 'absolute Mark Selby masterclass' in a 9-1 thrashing in the English Open final.
