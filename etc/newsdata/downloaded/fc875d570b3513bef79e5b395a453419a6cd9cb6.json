He's suggesting, if not screaming, that you can't back Latino issues and still love America. He couldn't be any more obvious if he were carrying a Tiki torch at Charlottesville himself.\u201d\n\nIf you thought that, you're right. But if you start calling Trump a racist or a white nationalist, bad news: You\u2019re now a volunteer in the Trump campaign. This is the fight he wants to have.\n\nIn his upcoming book, \"Merge Left: Fusing Race and Class, Winning Elections, and Saving America,\" Ian Haney L\u00f3pez reveals that Trump\u2019s only really big innovation in dog whistling is that he invites charges of racism. He loves these indictments. His 2016 campaign even celebrated them.\n\nNo facts needed in dog whistle politics\n\nLet\u2019s step back. You know Trump used the racist conspiracy theory that Mexican immigrants are \u201crapists\u201d sent to bring us \u201cdrugs\u201d and \u201ccrime\" to launch his campaign. You also know immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than native-born Americans (such as, say, members of the Trump campaign).\n\nBut facts don\u2019t matter that much to dog whistle politics \u2014 which is why it didn\u2019t matter to most Republicans that there was no evidence that Barack Obama was a foreign, Muslim traitor who faked his own birth.\n\nInstead, for 50 years, dog whistling has painted a racist nightmare. From Richard Nixon onward, we\u2019ve heard that people of color are we\u2019ve heard that people of color are dangerous, criminal threats to \"law and order.\" From Ronald Reagan forward, we\u2019ve been told people of color don\u2019t deserve our care: They\u2019re \u201cwelfare queens\u201d rather than \u201chardworking Americans.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump at a campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico, on Sept. 16, 2019. More\n\nAmong many critics today, it\u2019s common to charge Trump with blatant racism. He plays the race card \u201cface up,\u201d historian Joseph Ellis recently said. Watch liberal-leaning cable news and you\u2019ll soon hear something like, \u201cThose aren\u2019t dog whistles, they\u2019re foghorns!\u201d\n\nThis is definitely true \u2026 but only for Trump\u2019s critics, Haney L\u00f3pez observes in his book. They hear the obvious racial undertones and assume that anyone who doesn\u2019t reject this hatred is as racist as Trump. But this sidesteps reality.\n\nDon't let Trump distract you\n\nThe vast majority of Trump\u2019s supporters do not believe he\u2019s a racist. A Quinnipiac poll conducted in July found that about 9 out of 10 Republicans deny Trump is a racist. In fact, 57% of those who approved of his job performance in an August poll said discrimination against whites is a very or somewhat serious problem today.\n\nEven more shocking to Trump\u2019s critics is research from Haney L\u00f3pez showing that majorities of Democrats and people of color view messages about \u201cterrorist countries,\u201d \u201ccriminal gangs,\u201d \u201cillegal immigration\u201d and needing to \u201ctake care of our own people first\u201d as commonsense and convincing. The code is still working \u2014 even with people of color and Democrats \u2014 even if the most engaged critics see through it.\n\nEl Paso shooting: Open season on Hispanics in America thanks to racist in chief\n\nWhy does Trump want to be called a racist?\n\nBecause then you\u2019re not pointing out how he\u2019s ripping you off, threatening human survival and crushing jobs.\n\nInstead, you\u2019re strengthening his basic story line. Trump wants voters to go to the polls believing that America is locked in a cage fight between warring racial groups: \u201cWho is the real racist, the person warning about illegal immigrants or the person saying that\u2019s racist?\u201d When that\u2019s the debate, Trump wins.\n\nRacism is a deliberate strategy", "description": "'Who is the real racist, the person warning about illegal immigrants or the person saying that\u2019s racist?'
