Here\u2019s how not to miss the mark.\n\nYou login to Facebook and your heart sinks. There at the top of your feed is a post from a friend who\u2019s pouring out her heart about the death of her beloved grandmother. As soon as you finish reading you comment on the post, telling her how sorry you are for her loss and offer her handy advice about how she can get through this difficult time.\n\nIt seems as if it\u2019s the right thing to do \u2013 but a new study shows that often this kind of response does more harm than good. In the recent survey conducted by American health website WebMD over 1 000 respondents revealed when they were grieving, they found social-media posts, messages or unsolicited advice pointless, irritating and, in most, cases actively distressing.\n\nComments such as \u201ceverything happens for a reason\u201d, \u201cit could be worse\u201d and \u201cthey\u2019re in a better place\u201d were indicated as being among the most loathed platitudes dispensed by friends and acquaintances.\n\nSo how should you respond when someone you care about is in mourning?\n\nYou can\u2019t just ignore her loss but the last thing you want is to say something that\u2019s just going to make her feel worse. It\u2019s human nature to want to wrap up the situation and tie it with a bow, says Dr Seth J Gillihan, a psychology professor at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nWe yearn to say something that will make the person feel better but as well-intentioned as your words of comfort are, they may not be what a friend needs to hear at that moment.\n\n\u201cWe try to fix the person\u2019s grief, to take it away, either by minimising it, or by trying to offer advice like, \u2018This was helpful to my aunt when she lost her husband\u2019,\u201d Gillihan explains.\n\nOthers make the mistake of disappearing because they think the grieving person wants space or out of fear they might say the wrong thing.\n\n\u201cDeath is final, there\u2019s nothing you can do when someone has passed on, and because an individual feels they don\u2019t have a solution, they often choose to stay away,\u201d says Charity Mkone, a psychologist for the South African Depression and Anxiety Group (Sadag). But it\u2019s actually in grief that your friends and loved ones need you the most. Here\u2019s a bit of guidance on what to say and do.\n\nWORDS OF COMFORT\n\nON SOCIAL MEDIA\n\nPeople often choose to break the news of a death on social media because it\u2019s the quickest way of informing others about their loss, says Johannesburg psychologist Venise Germanos. \u201cIt also offers choice in engaging with people\u2019s condolences when the time is right for the individual,\u201d she adds.\n\nIn general, etiquette experts advise that if this is how the grieving person has chosen to communicate their loss then unless you know them very well, you should stick to this medium. If you send them a private message they may feel obliged to respond. If the loss is fresh, post a response to their message on social media, then give them a bit of space and reach out later.\n\nHowever, if the person is a close friend then she\u2019ll definitely want to hear from you. In this situation it\u2019s appropriate for you contact them directly. There\u2019s no universally appropriate thing to say, says Yoav Van der Heyden, a Cape Town psychologist.\n\n\u201cBut keep in mind whether you\u2019re sending a message personally to someone, or you\u2019re sending it online in a space where people are watching, people will always judge. So be true to your own values,\u201d he adds.\n\nGenerally it\u2019s best to avoid tired old platitudes. Rather aim to be sincere. A post saying, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. From the other posts you\u2019ve shared about her, she sounded like such an incredible woman. Thinking of you during this sad time.\u201d\n\nIf you actually knew your friend\u2019s grandmother maybe you could share a favourite memory. This will be a great comfort, says etiquette expert Anna Post of the Emily Post Institute, because you\u2019ll be helping to keep her memory alive. But avoid discussing details of her death or saying things such as, \u201cIt\u2019s a relief she isn\u2019t suffering anymore.\u201d That\u2019s for your bereaved friend to say \u2013 but only when she feels ready.\n\nTO A COLLEAGUE\n\nWords such as \u201cI\u2019m sorry for your loss,\u201d can sound so hollow but this phrase is an effective way of acknowledging the traumatic event without getting too emotional. Van der Heyden says you should avoid laying on the sympathy too thick \u2013 the last thing you want to do is reduce your poor colleague to tears when she\u2019s trying so hard to keep things together at work.\n\n\u201cLess is often more unless one has a good relationship, then more sharing may be suitable,\u201d he says.\n\nAfter the funeral of a loved one mourners often find themselves alone \u2013 where once they were deluged with offers of help, now they\u2019re expected to pick themselves up and carry on. And it\u2019s exactly at this time, as they return to their daily life, when they may feel at their most vulnerable. This is where other people beyond their close friendship circle can offer valuable support. Make it clear you\u2019re available should the person need any help, whether it\u2019s with their workload or just having someone to talk to about how they\u2019re feeling, says Sandra Jackson, a social worker with counselling organisation Family and Marriage Society of South Africa (Famsa).\n\n\u201cThis can be extremely helpful for someone who\u2019s grieving and feeling alone once the formalities of laying their loved one to rest is over,\u201d she adds. \u201cAlthough they may rather seek emotional comfort outside, knowing there\u2019s a support system at work will make them feel that their grief is acknowledged.\u201d\n\nSPEAKING TO A FRIEND\n\nMkone advises calling your friend, expressing 2sympathies and asking how they would like you to help. Sometimes people are too proud to ask for help, or are so overwhelmed they may not even know what it is that they want. In this instance, offering to look after their children to give them space to grieve may be well received, or volunteering to help with flowers or eats for the memorial service. However, Jackson adds that often the best thing you can do is being willing to sit with them in their grief and lend an ear without feeling the need to rush in with words of advice.\n\n\u201cWhile many of us worry about what to say to a grieving person it\u2019s actually more important to listen \u2013 and be present while doing so,\u201d she says. Don\u2019t shy away from talking about the deceased, Mkone says, but avoid imposing your views and beliefs about death.\n\nA DISTANT FAMILY RELATIVE\n\nMany of the rules mentioned above apply in this instance too. Try to keep it real. Jackson recommends acknowledging the situation and expressing concern by saying something such as, \u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear this happened to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cOffer to help with specific tasks such as the funeral arrangements, food shopping, transporting children to and from school,\u201d she says.", "description": "Offering condolences when a person you care about has suffered a loss is tricky.
