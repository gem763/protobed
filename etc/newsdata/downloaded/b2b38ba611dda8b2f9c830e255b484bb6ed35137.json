The vast majority of the sample was male, and all participants who were also Ashley Madison users were male.\n\nResults showed that people with histories of misconduct were significantly more likely to use the site.\n\n\"Our results show that personal sexual conduct is correlated with professional conduct,\" said Samuel Kruger, one of the authors of the study. \"Eliminating sexual misconduct in the workplace could have the extra benefit of contributing to more ethical corporate cultures in general.\"\n\nCheating is the behavior of 'self-gratifiers'\n\nBreakup recovery and dating coach Cherlyn Chong told Insider she had long suspected the link. She calls the men who are most prone to this behavior \"self-gratifiers.\"\n\n\"There are two main things from what I see, and they are entitlement and self-gratification,\" she said. \"They think they can get away with it, and it fuels their ego.\"\n\nSelf-gratification, she explained, is when someone can't sit with an uncomfortable feeling before leaping onto the next thing that makes them feel good about themselves.

Or it could mean starting an affair because you're unsatisfied with your career.\n\n\"Cheating is very intense, it's very passionate, and very exciting, until it blows apart,\" said Chong. \"This is them jumping onto the next best thing that gratifies them.\"\n\nIt's not only confined to the workplace, either. These men also tend to enjoy drinking, smoking, pornography, and drugs, she said. They also spend a lot of money on material things and like to gamble.\n\ndiy13 / Shutterstock\n\n'It always gets worse'\n\nAccording to Chong, the more men get away with their bad behavior, the bolder they get, so \"it always gets worse.\"\n\n\"A workplace misconduct can start really small, then it spirals, and results in him cheating,\" she said. \"People like that, the entitlement and the self gratification is in their identity, it is part of them, and because it is in their core it tends to seep out in multiple areas of their lives including in their career and their marriage.\"\n\nShe said self-gratifiers tend to be \"pseudo-confident,\" which is the air of having the ability to do anything, but really not having many skills at all.\n\n\"Once they want something they actually get it,\" she said. \"They tend to be sort of the most senior person at work, even though they don't do much, because they have this pseudo-confidence and people think they can do it.\"\n\nShe said they have other traits like being excessively charming, which helps them worm their way out of claims of harassment.\n\n\"It's quite creepy,\" Chong said. \"If they talk about themselves a lot, about how much money they earn, how successful they are ... that's one of the major red flags.\"\n\nRead more:\n\nA woman who cheats on her husband using Ashley Madison's services told us why she does it\n\nWomen sometimes cheat on their husbands \u2014 but not for the reasons you think\n\nAshley Madison now has 60 million users.
