Here's what you need to know:\n\nSALES: Revenue for the quarter fell 2% to EUR15.23 billion from EUR15.61 billion. BASF beat an analyst consensus forecast provided by the company of EUR15.17 billion.\n\nNET PROFIT: Net profit fell to EUR911 million from EUR1.2 billion for the same year-earlier period. The consensus forecast stood at EUR607 million.\n\nEBIT BEFORE SPECIAL ITEMS: EBIT before special items fell 24% to EUR1.12 billion from EUR1.47 billion. Here, BASF beat consensus figures by 6%, which was partly thanks to a one-off gain from a land sale in Switzerland, Baader Helvea says.\n\nWHAT WE WATCHED:\n\n-GUIDANCE: BASF backed its 2019 outlook, which it downgraded earlier this year. It forecasted a slight decline in sales and a drop of up to 30% in EBIT before special items.\n\nDZ Bank expects a revenue decline of 2% and a drop in EBIT before special items of 29% for the year. \"The global economy remains weak, especially in Europe and the automotive sector,\" the bank says.\n\n-MARGIN RECOVERY: BASF's Materials and Chemicals divisions performed weakly, with sales falling 13% and 22% respectively compared with the year-earlier period. Its Agriculture Solutions and Surface Technologies businesses performed significantly stronger than expected, Baader Helvea says.\n\nBASF's first two quarters already saw earnings slump, NordLB says, adding that this continued in the third quarter as well.\n\nWrite to Kim Richters at kim.richters@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 24, 2019 10:32 ET (14:32 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
