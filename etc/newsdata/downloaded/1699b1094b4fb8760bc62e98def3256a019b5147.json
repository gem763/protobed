People contract the disease when inhaling Legionella bacteria; it\u2019s not spread via person-to-person contact.

It can be found in soil and water, but more commonly causes infection when it multiplies in water systems (e.g., hot tubs and air conditioners).\n\nLEGIONNAIRES' DISEASE OUTBREAK AT ATLANTA HOTEL IS NOW LARGEST EVER RECORDED IN GEORGIA, HEALTH OFFICIAL SAYS\n\nThe disease is treatable with antibiotics and those who are sickened typically recover in full.
