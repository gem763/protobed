It\u2019s the only poll that strives to decide definitively which feathered friend was the fairest feathered friend of them all over the past year. It\u2019s so vitally important.\n\nOther publications have chimed in with their various ringing endorsements of the poll, which this year features a First Round class of 50 birds, which will be subsequently whittled down to 10 for a Second Round vote.\n\nThis year, however, PEDESTRIAN.TV is taking a different tact.\n\nIn these troubled and tumultuous times, we feel quite strongly that it\u2019s not the place of media to explicitly tell you who you should cast your vote for in a poll of such obvious significance.\n\nRather, it\u2019s for the benefit of everyone that you engage directly with the poll by researching each candidate and gaining an independent understanding of where they stand.\n\nREAD MORE Check Out This Shithead Magpie Literally Riding The Coattails Of A Wedge-Tailed Eagle\n\nSome of you may favour the salt-aired majesty of the white-bellied sea eagle.\n\nSome of you may be drawn in by the populist appeal of the common Australian magpie.\n\nSome of you may be attracted to the Southern cassowary, with its unyielding lust for death.\n\nHell, some of you may even lean to the extremes of the scale; to the Australian brush turkey (hard-left communist), or to the Black swan (radical capitalist with nationalist leanings).\n\nThe point is, whoever it is you vote for in the 2019 Bird of the Year poll, do so freely, without external influence, for whichever bird suits your world view best.\n\nAs long as it\u2019s not the garbage Pelican: The bird that sucks.\n\nIt is our belief that its beak can hold more than its belly can, and that as such it cannot EVER be trusted.\n\nThe fuck is it hiding in there? What\u2019s going on? Why won\u2019t it reveal its secrets? Neck too damn big. Far too much chin skin. Very suspicious!\n\nDo note vote for the Pelican.\n\nDo not give it what it wants.", "description": "The Guardian has thrown its annual Bird of the Year poll open, and our official position is simple: Do not vote for the garbage Pelican. It sucks.", "authors": ["Cam Tyeson"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/pelican.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
