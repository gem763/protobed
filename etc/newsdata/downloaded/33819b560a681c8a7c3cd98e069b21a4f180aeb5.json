Those cuts came on Wednesday, as the Fed announced a cut of the main target rate to a range of 1.75 to 2 per cent.\n\nDonald Trump, who had repeatedly slammed Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and demanded the Fed do a sweeping cut to the current rate, tweeted shortly after the announcement: \"Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve Fail Again. No \u201cguts,\u201d no sense, no vision! A terrible communicator!\"\n\nThe second modest cut was announced on Wednesday afternoon, as Mr Powell was set to deliver remarks at a press conference that would likely focus on current global economic challenges like the trade confrontation between Washington and Beijing, as well as the recent attacks on a series of oil production sites in Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe Fed said it believed the labour market \u201cremains strong\u201d and \u201ceconomic activity has been rising at a moderate rate\u201d. It also suggested further cuts could happen in the near future, saying it would \"act as appropriate\" in order to maintain the economy on an upward trajectory.\n\n\u201cJob gains have been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low,\u201d the statement continued. \u201cAlthough household spending has been rising at a strong pace, business fixed investment and exports have weakened.\u201d\n\nThe Fed is also monitoring the global slowdown, especially in Europe, and Britain\u2019s effort to leave the European Union. A disruptive Brexit could destabilise not just Europe but the US economy, too, according to experts.\n\nThe most serious threat to the expansion is widely seen as Mr Trump\u2019s trade war. The increased import taxes he has imposed on goods from China and Europe \u2014 and the counter-tariffs other nations have applied to US exports \u2014 have hurt many American companies and paralysed their plans for investment and expansion.\n\nRead more\n\nTrump insists China will suffer from trade war as US economy struggles\n\nIn recent days, the Trump administration and Beijing have acted to de-escalate tensions before a new round of trade talks planned for October in Washington.\n\nYet most analysts foresee no significant agreement emerging this fall in the conflict, which is fundamentally over Beijing\u2019s aggressive drive to supplant America\u2019s technological dominance.\n\nBalanced against a possible truce in the trade war are events that could undercut the economy, from a strike at General Motors to the attack that has temporarily reduced Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil production. The Trump administration says Iran is behind the attack, raising already high US-Iran tensions.\n\nhttp://players.brightcove.net/624246174001/default_default/index.html?videoId=5837728067001\n\nSupport free-thinking journalism and attend Independent events\n\nSo far, most economists say the temporary loss of Saudi production won\u2019t end up hurting the US economy, primarily because there remains plenty of global supply.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report\n\nRead more\n\nRead more Trump insists China will suffer from trade war as US economy struggles", "description": "The Federal Reserve has once again cut interest rates for a second time amid fears of a global economic downturn and concerns Donald Trump\u2019s trade wars with China could risk further instability among world markets.The Fed previously cut the rate to a range of 2 to 2.5 per cent in July, while hinting", "authors": ["Chris Riotta"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/F0VGrd4vJC_RsK3XuOnx6Q--~B/aD0zNjU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/692c30366215dbfad5301cd946993fab", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
