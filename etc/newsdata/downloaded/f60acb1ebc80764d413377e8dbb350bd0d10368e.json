The towns lie on a strategic supply route and the crossing between them had only been open for government or military traffic.\n\nIslamic State in 2014 seized vast swathes of land in both Iraq and Syria, declaring a caliphate across both countries. Iraq declared victory over the group in 2017 and it lost its last territory in Syria earlier this year.\n\nIraq\u2019s government recently called for the reinstatement of Syria\u2019s membership of the Arab League, which was suspended in 2011 over its crackdown on protesters at the start of the civil war.", "description": "Iraq's Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi has approved the reopening on Monday of the Qaim border-crossing with Syria, state news agency INA said, the latest sign of normalization between Baghdad and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
