Information is crowdsourced by users through a Telegram bot and similar channels.\n\nApple reportedly told the developer \u201cwe have verified with the Hong Kong cybersecurity and technology crime bureau that the app has been used to target and ambush police, threaten public safety, and criminals have used it to victimise residents in areas where they know there is no law enforcement\u201d, according to an excerpt shared on HKmap.live\u2019s Telegram channel.\n\n'Protecting rioters': China warns Apple over app that tracks Hong Kong police Read more\n\nThe app has been available for less than a week after making its debut on 5 October, according to the South China Morning Post.\n\nOn Twitter, HKmap.Live said it never solicits or promotes criminal activity and its moderators vote down content that appeared to do that.\n\nThe company said Apple\u2019s decision was \u201cclearly a political decision to suppress freedom and human rights in #Hong Kong\u201d.\n\nThe removal of HKmap.Live from the iTunes Store follows an editorial in China\u2019s People\u2019s Daily on Wednesday that accused Apple of \u201cprotecting rioters\u201d with its \u201cpoisonous app\u201d.\n\nApple is the fourth American company to come under fire this week for alleged involvement in the Hong Kong protests, which have entered their fifth month.\n\nThe NBA sports league found itself in hot water after Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey tweeted support for the Hong Kong protests. The Houston Rockets is one of the most popular NBA teams in China as it is the former team of Chinese basketball giant Yao Ming.\n\nLuxury retailer Tiffany & Co. meanwhile was forced to pull an ad campaign that evoked similar imagery to a Hong Kong protest movement. The ad showed a woman covering her eye, something protesters have done after police shot a female protester in the right eye.\n\nAmerican gaming company Blizzard Entertainment has also faced backlash and a possible boycott after it banned a player for making public comments supporting the Hong Kong protests during a tournament.\n\nThe removal of HKMap.Live, however, is likely to have little impact on the protests because previously downloaded versions of the app still appear to be functioning on iOS.\n\nA browser version is still available online, as is an Android version of the app, which has been available for download in the Google Play store since 18 September.\n\nMany protesters also prefer to use encrypted app Telegram to share police movements, where channels share similar information in real time to users.", "description": "Creators of HKmap.Live accused Apple of \u2018political decision to suppress freedom\u2019 in Hong Kong", "authors": ["Erin Hale"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3f3e5570a0aaf9ee182fd7026fa6bdc497543b3/102_3_3244_1947/master/3244.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5a75e50fb8292ee95ed9cc61cdbf470c", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
