The match took place under a media blackout, and the South Koreans first spoke to journalists about the conditions on their return to Seoul on Thursday.\n\nThe team\u2019s general manager, Choi Young-il, said the South Korean football association (KFA) would discuss whether to submit a complaint to FIFA over what he described as North Korea\u2019s failure to properly accommodate the visiting team and decision to block media and spectators.\n\nChoi told reporters at Incheon airport that the North Koreans played like they were \u201cwaging a war\u201d, violently swinging their elbows and hands and driving into their opponents knee-first when competing for balls in the air. \u201cI have never seen something like this in soccer before,\u201d he said.\n\nSon Heung-min, South Korea\u2019s captain and Tottenham striker, said: \u201cThe opponents were very rough, and there were moments when very abusive language was exchanged. It was hard to concentrate on the match because you were thinking about avoiding injury first ... It\u2019s an accomplishment that we returned from a game like that without injury.\u201d\n\nNo foreign media were allowed and the game was not broadcast live.\n\nThe Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, who also attended the match, issued a statement on Tuesday saying he was \u201cdisappointed to see there were no fans in the stands\u201d.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe were surprised by this and by several issues related to its live broadcast and problems with visas and access for foreign journalists.\u201d\n\nPyongyang\u2019s official Korean Central News Agency published only a brief match report, saying the \u201cgame of attacks and counterattacks ended in a draw 0-0\u201d.\n\nNorth Korea did provide a DVD recording of the match to South Korean football officials, but the South Korean TV channel KBS cancelled plans to broadcast the game on tape delay because of the video\u2019s poor quality, according to the broadcaster and the KFA.\n\n\u201cWe probably won\u2019t get another video from North Korea,\u201d said Park Jae-sung, a KFA official, adding the video was unfit for South Korea\u2019s high-definition TV services.\n\nThe North had been expected to have a clear home advantage in a 50,000-capacity stadium devoid of opposition fans, but South Korean players and football officials were surprised to discover there would be no home support either.\n\nSon said it was regrettable that South Korea, which has a stronger team on paper, could not return with three points, but admitted their opponents\u2019 physical playing style had affected morale.\n\nWhen they were not playing or training, South Korean players and staff were holed up at the Koryo hotel, which appeared to have no other guests, Choi said. They had no outside contact, having left their mobile phones at the South Korean embassy in Beijing before entering the North. Choi said North Korean officials did not inform the South Korean team the match would be played in an empty stadium.\n\n\u201cWe got there an hour and a half early and kept thinking that the gate will open and a crowd of 50,000 would pour in,\u201d Choi said. \u201cBut the gate never opened until the end.\u201d\n\nThe game was the first competitive meeting between the national men\u2019s teams in the North Korean capital, although the North hosted the South in a friendly in 1990.", "description": "South considering complaint over match, played in empty stadium amid media blackout", "authors": ["Associated Press In Seoul"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6f3bbfc1175658977e6d7dae0552b10397e3e204/0_0_5149_3090/master/5149.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=908cbd5ccae3c3efd05e70655e3c7ccc", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
