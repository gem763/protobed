But after a series of profit warnings, the price had fallen to just a fraction of that. Earlier this year, analysts at Citigroup bank described the travel firm's shares as \"worthless\".\n\nIn May, Thomas Cook reported a \u00a31.5bn loss for the first half of its financial year, with \u00a31.1bn of the loss caused by the decision to write down the value of My Travel, the business it merged with in 2007.\n\nHowever, it warned of \"further headwinds\" for the rest of the year and said there was \"now little doubt\" that Brexit had caused customers to delay their summer holiday plans.\n\nThe company then put its airline up for sale in an attempt to raise badly-needed funds.\n\nThomas Cook later announced it was in advanced talks with its banks and largest shareholder, China's Fosun.\n\nThe troubled operator hoped to seal a rescue led by Fosun, but the creditor banks issued a last-minute demand that the travel company find an extra \u00a3200m, which it was unable to do.\n\nImage copyright PA Image caption 2018's summer heatwave in the UK was blamed for falling bookings\n\nThe company's boss, Peter Fankhauser, said the firm had \"worked exhaustively\" to salvage the rescue package and it was \"deeply distressing\" that it could not be saved.\n\nThe package holiday share of the market has remained broadly unchanged.\n\nOne reason for this is that most air package holidays sold by travel companies based in the UK have ATOL protection.\n\nThis protection means that if the business collapses while travellers are away on holiday, they will be able to finish their trip and then travel home.\n\nIf a business folds before someone's trip, the scheme will provide a refund or replacement holiday.", "description": "The travel giant failed to raise money to secure its future after three profit warnings in a year.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/CDB4/production/_97606625_spainbeachgetty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
