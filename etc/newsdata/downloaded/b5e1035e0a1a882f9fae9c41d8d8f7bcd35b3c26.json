She died of cancer at 15 in March 2017. (Courtesy of Jacqueline Dooley)\n\nIn a calendar full of months dedicated to specific illnesses, September is particularly painful. This is the month focused on childhood cancer awareness. You\u2019ll see gold everywhere \u2014 gold ribbons, gold banners, gold-themed profile photos on social media, all in the name of awareness and remembrance for children battling cancer. And kids, like my Ana, who lost that fight.\n\nFor those of us who\u2019ve lost a child to cancer, gold is the color of sorrow, not hope. We are left with the burden of remembering \u2014 not just our children, but how they died, how we couldn\u2019t save them.\n\nEach year in the United States, roughly 16,000 children from birth to age 19 will be diagnosed with cancer and 1,780 of them will die of it.\n\nAna died on March 22, 2017, at age 15, of a rare type of cancerous tumor.\n\nYet she\u2019s always with me, always at the periphery of every thought, every moment. I still say good night to her. I talk to her in the morning as I replenish the bird feeders. It\u2019s no burden for me to remember Ana, but keeping her memory alive in the minds and hearts of other people? I\u2019m finding this a challenge, particularly as time passes.\n\nIn the beginning, it wasn\u2019t difficult because everyone was grieving. Ana was in the thoughts and hearts of an entire community of people who had been with us, cheering us on and rooting for Ana, for five years. But life, as they say, goes on.\n\n\n\nA plaque honoring Ana Dooley in a park in New York. (Jacqueline Dooley)\n\nExcept when it doesn\u2019t.\n\nAn average of about 17 percent of children die within five years of a cancer diagnosis. For those who survive beyond five years, 18 percent will die within 30 years.\n\nAna lived for four years and six months after her initial diagnosis in September 2012.\n\nWe didn\u2019t have a funeral. We couldn\u2019t bear to bury her. Instead, we had her body cremated. We picked up her ashes from the funeral home two weeks later. They were in a black, unmarked cardboard box, which I slipped onto a shelf as if it was an oddly shaped book and not the remains of my daughter.\n\nI drive by that funeral home several times a week. At first, it was impossible to suppress the image that rose up, unbidden, whenever I passed it \u2014 Ana, laid out on a metal gurney, a blanket pulled up to her chest. Her skin was the color of porcelain and she was so impossibly cold. Except for these details, she could\u2019ve been sleeping.\n\nShe held two identical stuffed alligators under each arm \u2014 she\u2019d called them \u201cChoobie,\u201d and she\u2019d loved them her entire life. They were cremated with her.\n\nTwo months after she died, we had a memorial celebration on what would\u2019ve been her 16th birthday. We gathered at the small private school in Woodstock, N.Y., that had embraced Ana \u2014 a place she loved and that loved her.\n\nBy then we\u2019d moved her ashes to an urn made by a local potter who painted a hummingbird on the front beneath Ana\u2019s name. The hummingbird was inspired by a tattoo design that Ana liked. She\u2019d hoped to get the tattoo before she died, but she was too young and far too sick. The potter had combined the hummingbird with one of Ana\u2019s drawings \u2014 a blue flower with periwinkle petals.\n\nI\u2019m reminded of the tattoo Ana never got every day when I walk past her urn to sit down at my desk.\n\nYou see, my office was Ana\u2019s bedroom. My work area is spread across one wall, but the rest of the room still belongs to her.\n\nBehind me are Ana\u2019s shelves, filled with items she loved \u2014 candles, trinkets and bowls she\u2019d made in pottery class. The urn occupies a corner of those shelves.\n\nWe glued a chunk of celestite to the lid \u2014 it was Ana\u2019s favorite stone. Four paper cranes adorn this small altar \u2014 one for each member of our immediate family. The last crane Ana ever folded is the orange one.\n\nOn average, a child loses 70 potential life years when they die of cancer, compared with 15 potential life years for adults.\n\nNear our home in New York\u2019s mid-Hudson Valley, there are several places where we\u2019ve honored Ana\u2019s memory. They are our attempt to let people know that she lived. She was real. A plaque with her name on it is secured to a slab of bluestone in a local park.\n\nWe used to take Ana and her younger sister to this park when they were little. Ana loved to catch frogs in the park\u2019s tiny pond. She was a master frog catcher, but she was always gentle. She\u2019d catch them, cup them in her hands for a minute or two, then set them free. Ana had called the park \u201cThe Frog Pond\u201d and the name stuck. She loved going there even as a teenager.\n\nAfter we installed the plaque, we scattered some of her ashes in the frog pond.\n\nA yellow magnolia tree was planted near the entrance to the small private school that Ana attended from first through eighth grades. At its base sits a handmade steppingstone that reads, \u201cAna\u2019s Tree.\u201d\n\nAbout 30 miles away in Woodstock, a circular gazebo made from rough-cut logs and a bench swings surrounds another tree at the school where Ana attended ninth and 10th grade. This one is a maple. We planted the tree in Ana\u2019s memory during her memorial service two years ago.\n\nAna\u2019s former classmates completed the gazebo and hung their own plaque in her honor last year. The gazebo is a welcome respite for students, teachers and parents who can sit and contemplate the beautiful school grounds that Ana loved.\n\n\u201cThe space is never empty,\u201d a teacher told me during my last visit.\n\nIt never feels like enough \u2014 these tokens of our love for Ana \u2014 but at least it\u2019s something.\n\nAs many as 20 percent of \u00admothers and 35 percent of \u00adfathers \u00adreported symptoms of \u00adpost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) five years after their child\u2019s death.\n\nMy friend Jodi made me a quilt from some of Ana\u2019s favorite clothes. It took me months to do more than drape it over a chair. I could barely look at it, much less touch it.\n\nI have every single item of clothing memorized \u2014 the owl pajamas, the sherbet-colored rainbow sweater, the Buffy T-shirt that she\u2019d worn until it had practically disintegrated. I would give anything to wash and fold Ana\u2019s clothes again, literally anything.\n\nBut all I have is this quilt. These days, I drape it over my legs and run my hands over each square of fabric. It helps with the remembering.\n\nI remember Ana by writing about her. I tell and retell her story \u2014 not just the story of how she died, but the story of who she was, of how she lived. I remember her by saying her name. I\u2019ll keep saying her name until I can no longer speak.\n\nI light candles for her, watch her favorite TV shows and turn my Facebook page gold in September. I am learning, slowly, to find joy in her memory because that\u2019s all I can do. It\u2019s all I have left.\n\nOnly four drugs have been approved for first-instance use in treating childhood cancer since 1980. And annually, from 2007 through 2016, less than 4 percent of the National Cancer Institute\u2019s budget was allocated to fund pediatric cancer research.\n\nThe truth is, there\u2019s no single way to remember a dead child. Every family copes with this loss differently. I wish there weren\u2019t so many of us out here \u2014 grieflings, bereaved parents, the tribe of \u201cafter.\u201d I had no idea how many of us existed until I became one of them. Now I know at least 10 parents who have lost a child to cancer.\n\nMy hope is that some day no family will lose a child from cancer and that gold of September will simply represent the autumn harvest and the turning leaves, not the suffering of a child with cancer.\n\nRead more\n\nCaring at home for a child with cancer can leave family members with risky tasks\n\n\u2018Immoral and barbaric\u2019: cancer-surviving judge blasts insurer for denying treatment\n\nHow palliative care is helping cancer patients, targeting the physical and existential threats they face", "description": "Nearly 1,800 children die of the disease.
