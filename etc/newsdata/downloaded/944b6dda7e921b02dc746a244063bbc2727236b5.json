That\u2019s why the extended plan is to offer an adapted version of the Salesforce Field Service Lightning mobile app \u2014 typically used for onsite job management, providing real-time collaboration and access to information such as scheduling and knowledge bases \u2014 to local stakeholders like lifeguards, surf school teachers, and marine biologists. Those \u201cfield workers\u201d will be able to access the collected information, such as how many sharks were spotted at any given time and where. The rationale is that by providing such tools that involve the community in the process, they\u2019ll trust the AI technology as a solution.\n\n\u201cThis application is unique because we\u2019ve had the privilege of building it hand in hand with our community partners,\u201d explains McCauley. \u201cFor us, it was a fantastic opportunity to apply AI to not only capture data of value to shark researchers, but to also be able to try to be helpful to our community by sharing that data.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also about understanding a traditionally misunderstood species \u2014 where they\u2019re swimming and why, their behavior and feeding patterns. If we\u2019re able to give these creatures their space and predict when they might come into contact with people, McCauley says, we\u2019ll be better prepared to keep beaches safe, too. Not to mention the sharks, who are still a \u201cvulnerable\u201d species \u2014 one step up from \u201cendangered\u201d status. The end use case of such technology isn\u2019t just a practical use of AI \u2014 although it is that, and an undeniably cool one. It\u2019s also a way to bring technology to a place it hasn\u2019t traditionally been: the beach.\n\n\u201cLifeguards do a superb job of protecting all of us when we head to the beach,\u201d says McCauley. \u201cBut they are constantly on the lookout for next-gen tools and technologies to help them better assess the situation at their beaches. AI could very well be one of those new tools.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
