None of that is arguably at work this time, at least for now.\n\nInstead, what\u2019s making investors nervous about a recession is a global, geopolitical shock to business sentiment that\u2019s prompting U.S. companies to curb spending amid uncertainties from the U.S.-China trade war to Britain\u2019s potential pullout from the European Union.\n\n\u201cThe global economy continues to soften and we are taking steps to cut capacity,\u2019\u2019 FedEx Corp (NYSE: ). Chief Executive Officer Fred Smith said in a Sept. 17 conference call. The slowdown is being \u201cdriven by increasing trade tensions and policy uncertainty.\u2019\u2019\n\nThat poses problems for Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and his fellow policy makers as they decide whether to cut interest rates later this month for the third time this year.\n\nThe unusual nature of the forces at play -- and the fact that many of them are geopolitical and emanate from abroad -- makes it more difficult for policy makers to decide how far to go in easing credit.\n\nThere\u2019s even a question of how effective rate cuts will be in an economy where business executives fear such dire developments as the breakup of global supply chains.\n\nPowell is expected to deliver his latest thinking on the outlook when he speaks to the National Association for Business Economics in Denver at 2:30 p.m. U.S. East Coast time on Tuesday. He said last week that despite some risks, the U.S. economy is in a \u201cgood place,\u2019\u2019 and that the Fed\u2019s job is \u201cto keep it there.\u2019\u2019\n\nBreak or Bounce?\n\nIf business pessimism turns out to be overdone, there\u2019s even a chance the economy could snap back as companies rev up outlays and monetary stimulus kicks in with greater force.\n\n\u201cThe scenarios are quite extreme,\u2019\u2019 JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: ) & Co. chief economist Bruce Kasman said. \u201cEither we bend and then break or we bend and then bounce.\u2019\u2019\n\nA study by IHS Markit\u2019s Macroeconomic Advisers calculated that gross domestic product could be boosted by roughly 0.5% if uncertainty over trade policy ultimately dissipates.\n\nNegotiators from the U.S. and China are scheduled to meet on Thursday for the first high-level talks since July, though hopes of a breakthrough are not high.\n\nWhat Bloomberg\u2019s Economists Say\n\nBloomberg\u2019s model puts the chance of a downturn in the next 12 months at about 25%. \u201cThat is a warning sign, but not yet a panic signal. The chances of a recession are higher than they were at the start of the year. They are lower than they were over the summer, and before previous downturns.\u201d-- Eliza Winger, Yelena Shulyatyeva and Andrew Husby.\n\nMoody\u2019s Analytics Inc. chief economist Mark Zandi said a recession is all but inevitable if President Donald Trump follows through on his threat to impose tariffs on virtually all U.S. imports from China by the end of this year.\n\nSuch a move would probably rock financial markets and hurt the economy, said Matthew Luzzetti, chief U.S. economist for Deutsche Bank (DE: ) Securities. In the event that happened, he said the odds of a downturn would rise to 50-50.\n\nSome other analysts are not as pessimistic. Former International Monetary Fund chief economist Maury Obstfeld said a ratcheting up of tariffs on China would likely lead to slower growth, but not a recession.\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t see what would set off a broad contraction in activity,\u2019\u2019 said Obstfeld, who is now a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\n\nThat\u2019s because many of the traditional drivers of downturns seem to missing in action:\n\nInflation isn\u2019t high and rising. If anything, it\u2019s too low, at least as far as the Fed is concerned.\n\nThe central bank isn\u2019t raising interest rates. It\u2019s lowering them.\n\nStock prices are elevated, but arguably not in bubble territory given the low level of rates.\n\nAnd households are not over-leveraged and generally are in good financial shape.\n\n\u201cThe consumer right now in the U.S., at least in terms of our business, is doing really well,\u201d Hugh Johnston, chief financial officer for PepsiCo (NASDAQ: ) Inc. said in a recent interview.\n\n\u201cYou have a lot of trouble identifying what the trigger would be for a recession in the U.S., especially a deep one,\u2019\u2019 said Andrew Hollenhorst, chief U.S. economist for Citigroup Inc (NYSE: ). \u201cThat makes us feel a little less concerned.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe put the chances of a recession over the next 12 months at about 30%.\n\nVeteran forecaster Allen Sinai said the current situation reminds him of the lead-up to the 1990-91 recession. Companies back then responded to a profit squeeze from rising wages by cutting back spending and hiring.\n\nThis time it is slowing sales abroad that could prompt U.S. companies to pull back, said Sinai, president of Decision Economics Inc.\n\nHe said the lesson from the earlier period is that the Fed needs to respond aggressively and preemptively to the danger of a recession.\n\nThe trouble is that the outlook is far from clear.\n\nSome risks, like Brexit, have yet to materialize. Others, like the U.S.-China tit-for-tat tariffs, have soured business sentiment but only recently begun to crimp output.\n\n\u201cWe are having a hard time judging how large this geopolitical shock is,\u2019\u2019 said JPMorgan\u2019s Kasman, who reckons that the odds of a recession over the next 12 months are 35% to 40%.", "description": "New Kind of Recession Threat Presents Problem for Powell and Fed", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic80a40d190db4c4aac8f2ab35e83d751c.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
