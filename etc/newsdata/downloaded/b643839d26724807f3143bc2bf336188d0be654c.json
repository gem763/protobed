I did nothing wrong\u2026 My son\u2019s statement speaks for itself.\u201d With this response, Biden acted like a parent during a teacher conference who chooses to be willfully ignorant of the idea that his child could never, ever do anything wrong.\n\nTo recap: Hunter Biden worked for an oil and gas company in Ukraine, making egregious sums of money while his father was Vice President. That employment was investigated by Ukrainian anti-corruption officials and there was found to be no wrongdoing. Still, President Trump urged Ukrainian officials to open up another investigation into Hunter \u2014 or else he would not administer aid to the country, a quid pro quo of sorts, leveraging international funds to benefit him in the national election. This is at the heart of the current ongoing impeachment inquiry into the President that\u2019s lighting up our phones with notifications.\n\nBiden\u2019s response wasn\u2019t wrong. It was just that he was right in the way that any parent who says that, well, they didn\u2019t see their kid shove another kid on a playground so it must not have happened is right. While Ukrainian anti-corruption officials did open an investigation into Hunter\u2019s employment and found that there was no criminal illegal activity, that doesn\u2019t mean that Hunter trading on his father\u2019s name is morally good. There\u2019s a difference between \u2018legal\u2019 and \u2018right\u2019 and Biden seems to be skirting the line of those two concepts when he says that Hunter did nothing wrong.\n\nHunter did the wrong, immoral thing that harms our democracy: he utilized the currency of his father, who was at the time the second in command to the most powerful man in the free world, to get a cushy position at a Ukrainian company to the tune of $50,000 a month. That the Ukrainian officials found no wrongdoing in those actions is probably because the former Vice President is not a dumb-dumb. What likely amounted to a \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d policy at home has shielded both Hunter and his father from criminal activity and ensures that there was no illegality. But profiting off the office of the president, however legal it may be, is certainly not a moral good.\n\nWhat Hunter Biden did, it should be noted, is typical. He didn\u2019t do anything that kids of other famous politicians or even actors and performers haven\u2019t benefited from. Hunter, like the Trump kiddos, was born on third base \u2014 privy to wealth, access, and a family name that bought him influence. That is the Washington, D.C., way, after all. When elected officials leave office, they go through a revolving door into the lobbying industry and use their name and access to important people to help influence policy.\n\nTheir kids often do the same. This is to say nothing of Ivanka, Don Jr., Eric, and Jared Kushner, who court international business deals and licenses as their father shapes foreign policy. The difference between Hunter and Don Jr., however, is that while Hunter and his dad probably didn\u2019t talk about his work, it\u2019s hard to imagine that the Trump kids don\u2019t talk business with their dear old dad. It\u2019s also extremely hard to believe that Trump doesn\u2019t use such considerations when he shapes his own foreign policy, as has been suggested by the Turkey and Syria debacle. (Trump Tower Istanbul, the only business property of Trump\u2019s in Europe, is said to be a major factor in his decision to pull back troops from Syria and allow our long-standing allies, the Kurds, to be slaughtered by Turkey. Few can forget the call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which he said: \u201cActually, the last time I traveled to the United States I stayed in New York near Central Park and I stayed at the Trump Tower.\u201d)\n\nBut still, Hunter working for a foreign company while his dad helped shape foreign policy is, while maybe not as brazenly illegal as the Trump clan\u2019s actions, more nefarious than, say, Jenna Bush Hager\u2019s morning spot on Hoda and Jenna or Meghan McCain\u2019s tenure on The View. Would those two descendants of political titans have gotten their jobs without their parents? No, not likely. Nepotism lives on. But even if Hunter did nothing illegal, the fact that the children of elected officials can use their names to get them jobs, money, and influence, should give one pause. After all, political office today is a powerhouse for profit.", "description": "It's okay to admit when your kid did something shady, Joe.", "authors": ["Lizzy Francis"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/0E7TSNgwbdHLNa1NKZYtjA--~B/aD00ODU7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/fatherly_721/09b789987442cdae10de61bfa837f8f2", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
