Instead, the sector is struggling to hold a trading range that started early this summer. The outlook weakened after various chip companies warned that the second half would come in weaker than expected. Investors need to decide if the strength in chip sales earlier this year was due to customers hoarding supply ahead of tariffs. Or will the refresh in smartphones, led by Samsung, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Huawei and others, give a lift in demand?\n\nThe uncertainties in chip sales through the rest of the year are already adding volatility to semiconductor stocks. Already trading at low price-to-earnings multiples, value investors seeking growth in the chip sector have several companies to pick from. And since chip stocks may enjoy strong profit growth when demand rebounds, they do not need to pay investors a dividend. Instead, they may grow cash levels and increase capital expenditures when the market improves.\n\nThere are seven semiconductor stocks that investors should consider buying now at current levels.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\n\n\n\n\nSemiconductor Stocks to Buy: Micron (MU)\n\nLooks like This Momentum in Micron Stock Is for Real More\n\nSource: Charles Knowles / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicron stock fell from $50 to the low $40s after the company released fourth-quarter results that beat consensus estimates. Investors fretted over the significantly weaker NAND outlook. Bit growth \u2014 one way to represent the projected increased in demand \u2014 will slow in 2020 due to excess supply. Still, for 2019, DRAM supply growth is trailing demand while cost reductions for the fiscal year are moderating. This suggests a demand-supply equilibrium for both NAND and DRAM. Plus, Micron is not slowing down on product innovation.\n\nMicron shipped the first 1z-nanometer products, giving it feature size leadership. 75% of its production was 1x while 1Y output will increase. Its 96-layer 3D NAND is becoming a bigger portion of its mix, which should lift profit margins. It is also using replacement gate dyes for the first time, which reduces the replacement gate transition.\n\nNear-term worries over excess supply conditions could pull MU stock to below $40 for an extended period. But the market demand for its product will only grow in the coming years. Consumer solid-state drives are now mainstream for computers. Non-volatile memory express \u2014 an interface protocol built for SSDs \u2014 will lift Micron\u2019s market share. In mobile, NAND shipments tripled year-over-year. As 5G rolls out, LP5 DRAM demand will increase. Data center and graphics are a strong market and Micron is at the heart of the business. And in automotive, weak sales will not hurt revenues from this segment. Auto companies are adding more computer components, which will lift demand.\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia (NVDA)\n\nShould You Buy Nvidia Stock Ahead of Today's Earnings? Not So Fast! More\n\nSource: michelmond / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is well above the $135 lows set in June 2019. Investors continued to accumulate Nvidia stock after its second-quarter report posted on Aug. 15. Chief among its growth segments is its dominance in the GPU market for PCs. Gaming companies continue to support the company\u2019s RTX platform. In Q2, a growing number of AAA titles announced support for RTX, including Activision Blizzard\u2019s (NASDAQ:ATVI) Call of Duty, Cyberpunk 777, Watchdogs: Legion and Wolfenstein: Youngblood.\n\nWith RTX cards\u2019 inclusion in hundreds of original-equipment-manufacturer laptops will give the GPU segment a strong lift in revenue. Nvidia\u2019s solution offers energy efficiency through the Turing architecture and Max-Q technology enables a thin and light form factor.", "description": "If it were not for the U.S.-China trade war escalating and then de-escalating throughout the last year, semiconductor stocks would trend higher.
