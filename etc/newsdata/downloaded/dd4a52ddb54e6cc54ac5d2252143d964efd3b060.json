(Image: Warner Bros.)\n\nWe\u2019re drawing nearer to Joker\u2019s theatrical release, and as we do we\u2019re seeing more theatres across the country respond to the possibility, credible or otherwise, of the film being a possible flashpoint for incel violence.\n\nNow, Entertainment Weekly reports that Alamo Drafthouse, an Austin-based theatre chain which operates 40 theatre locations across the U.S., is taking steps to increase security during screenings of the film.\n\n\u201cThere have been some guest inquiries surrounding next week\u2019s Joker screenings, and what we\u2019re doing as a company to ensure staff and guest safety, which is at all times our primary concern,\u201d a spokesperson for the theatre chain said, in a statement obtained by EW.\n\n\u201cWe engage with local law enforcement on an ongoing basis about security at our theatres, and while we\u2019re unaware of any specific threat or concern, we will have additional security personnel present at each location for opening weekend for the comfort of our staff and guests. Additionally, cosplaying will be allowed, however, guests in costume are always subject to search at the discretion of theatre staff at any time, and may be asked to leave for any reason.\u201d\n\nThe Drafthouse isn\u2019t the only American theatre to take notable action in preparation for the film: Landmark Theatres, a chain that services 56 theatres, has banned cosplay entirely for the film, for both guests and employees.\n\nControversy about the film has built over the past few months, as concerns over the film\u2019s possibly sympathetic depiction of the Joker as a disaffected white man have mounted.\n\nConsidering that disaffected white men have been major perpetrators in the United States\u2019 ongoing gun violence crisis, many have feared that Joker could be a flashpoint for similar violence. Recently, we reported that the U.S. military has issued an advisory to its employees regarding the possibility, and victims of the Aurora shooting have released a statement against the film. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that no credible threats have so far been identified.\n\nJoker premiered, sans press, last night in Los Angeles, and will be hitting theatres on October 3 in Australia.", "description": "We\u2019re drawing nearer to Joker\u2019s theatrical release, and as we do we\u2019re seeing more theatres across the country respond to the possibility, credible or otherwise, of the film being a possible flashpoint for incel violence....", "authors": ["Julie Muncy", "Tom Mckay"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/owdaekoqb1ngbaqhiojs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
