On both sides, the MX-30\u2019s rear doors open from the back rather than the front, and there\u2019s also no center pillar, providing a large entrance when both doors are open. AutoCar reports that Mazda last used these \u201cfreestyle\u201d doors on its RX-8.\n\nOutside of its design, the specs of Mazda\u2019s EV crossover are a little more understated. Its drivetrain offers 141 bhp, but AutoCar reports that its 35.5kWh battery is only expected to get a range of around 130 miles. That\u2019s far less than the likes of the Tesla Model 3 (250 miles with its Standard Range Plus version), or the Chevy Bolt (238 miles), and is more in line with the Nissan Leaf (84 miles), or Mini Electric (145 miles). Mazda told AutoCar that it went with a smaller battery to reduce emissions over the total lifecycle of the vehicle, and anticipates the MX-30 being bought as a second car by many households.\n\nInternally, the MX-30 includes a 7-inch touchscreen which can be used to control the car\u2019s aircon (a first for a Mazda, according to AutoCar). This touchscreen sits above a gear shifter on the car\u2019s central console, which is partially constructed out of cork.\n\nMazda plans to start accepting pre-orders for the MX-30 next summer, and expects the car to ship in Japan in the second half of the year, and to Europe in early 2021. CNET reports that the car is also destined for the US. Exact pricing is yet to be confirmed, but AutoCar notes that the MX-30 is expected to start at below \u00a330,000 (around $38,500).", "description": "The Mazda MX-30 is the first all-electric car from the Japanese automaker.
