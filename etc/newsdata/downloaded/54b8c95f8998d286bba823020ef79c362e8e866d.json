I kind of dropped him in it.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe boys moved to the school in May and Claire said Alfiee-Joe suffers from anxiety but after a good week they took him for a treat and a haircut.\n\nShe now believes it will take around six weeks for the boys\u2019 hair to grow back to an acceptable length.\n\nShe said: \u2018If they are going to keep him in that long he\u2019s going to be scaling the walls. It\u2019s just a bit over the top.\n\n\u2018Alfiee stayed up until 11.30pm last night worrying because he didn\u2019t want to go to school. He sits and worries about things.\n\n\u2018My other son \u2013 he is a model student \u2013 is devastated he is now being punished for a hair cut.\u2019\n\nThe school\u2019s head teacher said the parents would have been made aware of the rules (Picture: BPM)\n\nClaire said the boys\u2019 previous schools did not have a problem with the style, but the school\u2019s head teacher, Simon Webb, says they would have been aware of the rules.\n\nHe said: \u2018Whenever we have new parents come into any one of our academies we take the parents through the home school agreement.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s a set of statements which we believe are agreed between the home and school in terms of uniform, behaviour and general support the school can offer parents and advise parents. We are open to anyone coming in with any concerns and any worries.\n\n\u2018That school agreement is signed by parents before children arrive and 99 to 100% of the time we never have to refer to that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I think in this case the parents have chosen to take their boys and have their hairs cut in a way which is not appropriate to the academy and makes the boys stand out more than any normal haircut.\n\nMum Claire Mitchell, 28, received a call to say that her eldest son\u2019s hair went against the rules (Picture: BPM)\n\n\u2018This isn\u2019t the first time this has happened. Rather than ask the children to stay off school like most secondary schools would, we take the children off the play ground and sit in the library or a classroom with an adult who can supervise them. In this way they are safe and not punished.\u2019\n\nHowever, Claire is still not happy. She said: \u2018The policy doesn\u2019t specify what an extreme haircut is, it says no decorative designs. They asked for designs but I said no \u2013 I don\u2019t see the problem with a parting.\n\n\u2018I do not want to send them to school looking scruffy, I want them to represent the school and look smart.\n\n\u2018If it was going to distract other children then they are happy with them in the classroom, so they have to stay off the play ground?\u2019\n\nShe then told teachers her other son Declan had the same haircut so he was banned from the playground as well (Picture: BPM)\n\nClaire has resorted to picking the boys up at lunchtime and taking them home for an hour.\n\nShe said: \u2018I\u2019m now having to pick them up at lunch time and break time. I also have a six month old and a house and things to do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Taking them out at lunch time and break time they feel like they are being punished for their hairstyle.\n\n\u2018I said I will bring you home and you can have your lunch and have a charge around the garden. I can\u2019t do it every day though, I have a baby.\n\n\u2018My little girl is autistic and now she wants to come home because her brothers are.\u2019\n\nShe added: \u2018I have been trying to speak to them they are just passing messages through the office.\n\n\u2018I said this doesn\u2019t specify the designs in the hair and that\u2019s just the parting in the hair it\u2019s not attention-seeking. I said I didn\u2019t realise, I know about the designs. It\u2019s been a nightmare.\u2019", "description": "A mother has expressed her shock at two of her children being told they can't play outside because they breached school rules about haircuts.
