Col. Alexander Vindman, the White House national security official who testified in the impeachment inquiry.\n\nWallace said, \u201cLieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman, who is right now testifying in the impeachment probe represents the beating heart of the quintessential American story. He and his family, Jewish refugees carrying only their suitcases and $750, based on reporting in \u201cThe New York Times,\u201d fled the Soviet Union when he was 3 years old in search of a better life. His father worked multiple jobs and learned English at night so his son could grow up, graduate from college, receive a military commission, and serve the United States in the form of multiple overseas tours on combat deployment in Iraq. In 2003, Vindman was injured by an IED. He was awarded a purple heart.\u201d\n\n\u201dVindman has a master\u2019s degree from Harvard,\u201d she continued. \u201cHe\u2019s worked in several embassies and joined the National Security Council last year after passing extensive background check. Unlike some other West Wing Advisers we know. His biography and life of service make the attacks against him remarkable. At a time when attacks on once sacred institutions and their leaders have stopped being noteworthy or newsworthy. Trump went from not knowing him to calling him a Never-Trumper in the course of an hour and a half this morning. That\u2019s nothing compared to the smear campaign happening on cable news.\u201d\n\nAfter playing video clips of Fox News\u2019 Laura Ingraham, Justice Department lawyer during the George W. Bush administration John Yoo and former Congressman Sean Duffy, Wallace said, \u201cExcept those people aren\u2019t chickenshit like the three of you and they know that he passed a background check that the president\u2019s daughter and son-in-law didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN", "description": "On Tuesday's broadcast of MSNBC's \"Deadline,\" host\u00a0Nicolle Wallace\u00a0called three defenders of President Donald Trump \"chickenshit,\" for questioning the | Clips", "authors": ["Pam Key"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/Nicolle-Wallace--640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
