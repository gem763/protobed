You can find it in POLITICO's weekly print edition and online on Fridays.\n\nREADY, STEADY, OH!\n\n\u201cGet ready,\u201d sang The Temptations in one of the most life-affirming pieces of music ever recorded. \u201cGet ready,\u201d said the British government as it unveiled its no-deal Brexit preparations, to the sound of audible groaning.\n\nYes, the \u00a3100 million public information campaign urging people to make sure they are prepared for Britain\u2019s departure from the EU has finally been launched. There are adverts to run on TV, radio, social media and billboards, but most importantly a website full of handy advice and a questionnaire.\n\nIf, for the sake of argument, you were a British citizen living in another EU country, question 5 is this: \u201cDo you plan to travel after 31 October 2019?\u201d Not \u2018do you plan to travel just after 31 October 2019?\u2019 or \u2018do you have travel booked?\u201d But do you ever want to travel again! Is it a trap to flush out Remainers who enjoy going to exotic places with their spicy food and, well, foreigners?\n\nThe landing page of the same site features the bold statement \u201cThe UK will leave the EU on 31 October 2019.\u201d That\u2019s very much in keeping with Boris Johnson\u2019s line since he became PM. But it\u2019s a high-risk game that the cosplay Donald Trump is playing and if it fails he could go down in the record books as the PM with the shortest tenure in British history.\n\nGeorge Canning holds that record. He was PM for 119 days (if you\u2019re prime minister in Italy for 119 days you get a statue and a public holiday named after you). Johnson took office on July 24, so will pass Canning\u2019s mark on November 20. If he survives that long, Johnson will need a new prime ministerial role model, and there\u2019s only one candidate. No, not Churchill, but Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman. He was the first man to be given official use of the title Prime Minister and once said \u201cI am an immense believer in bed, in constantly keeping horizontal ... The heart and everything else go slower, and the whole system is refreshed.\u201d He died after a series of heart attacks.\n\nDOS AND DON'TS\n\nDON\u2019T: Bother with Mike Pence\n\nSay what you like about Donald Trump (no, really, say what you like) but at least he\u2019s interesting. So imagine booking Trump and getting Mike Pence, as happened to the poor Poles at the weekend. It\u2019s like having a ticket to see Iggy Pop and getting Mumford & Sons. At least Poland has so few high-ranking female politicians it couldn\u2019t cause the famously women-averse Pence any embarrassment.\n\nDON\u2019T: Slouch\n\nMan of the people and Leader of the House Jacob Rees-Mogg was a walking, talking, lying down ad for voting against the government Tuesday. As well as being photographed virtually horizontal on the front bench of the Commons, he also said the plan to stop a no-deal Brexit is \u201cthe most unconstitutional use of this house since the days of Charles Stewart Parnell.\u201d That resulted in the bizarre sight of a member of parliament from 1875 to 1891 trending on Twitter \u2014 and not just Rees-Mogg!\n\nDON\u2019T: Call the mayor of London sadistic\n\nFrom the man who gave us the \u201cPrince of Whales\u201d comes \u201cSadique Kahn.\u201d Yes, Donald Trump, sworn enemy of the English language, was at it again, royally mucking up the mayor\u2019s name and inadvertently using the French word for sadist and the German word for boat.\n\nCAPTION COMPETITION\n\nPaul Dallison is POLITICO's Slot News Editor", "description": "The UK\u2019s new website on leaving the EU contains a surprising question.", "authors": ["Paul Dallison"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1157645465-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
