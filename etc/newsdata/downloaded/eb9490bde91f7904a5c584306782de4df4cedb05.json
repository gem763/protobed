At this point, the market looks very likely to reenter the area, but obviously it is an area that has been rather noisy, and therefore could cause quite a bit of trouble for traders.\n\nUSD/JPY Video 09.09.19\n\nLooking at the chart, there are a couple of long wicks above that continue to show signs of resistance. The 50 day EMA slicing through that area of course is another reason to think that perhaps the sellers are starting to step in. Simply put, this pair is a barometer of risk appetite and it\u2019s likely that we will continue to see a lot of erratic behavior due to the fact that there are a multitude of issues out there that could cause risk appetite to wax and wane. The US/China trade situation has gotten better over the last couple of days, but quite frankly nothing has truly changed. Because of this, it\u2019s likely that the pair will continue to be choppy to say the least. Now that we have the jobs number out of the way, it\u2019s likely that we will eventually get some type of move, but the initial reaction was a bit muted, as professional traders will start to add volume to the market on Monday. If we do break to the upside, the \u00a5108 level will be the initial target. Underneath, the \u00a5105 level is massive support.\n\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\n\nMore From FXEMPIRE:", "description": "The US dollar initially tried to rally during the trading session on Friday but ran into a bit of a buzz saw of resistance at the \u00a5107 level.
