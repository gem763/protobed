But a new study found that cancer patients raising money on GoFundMe are only reaching about a quarter of their goal on average.\n\nA new research letter in the medical journal JAMA Internal Medicine identified the 20 most prevalent cancers in the United States and studied more than 1,000 GoFundMe pages last October. The paper says that medical bills such as co-pays or out-of-pocket drug costs, and medical travel expenses were cited among the most pressing financial needs.\n\nOn average, the campaigns studied set a goal of about $20,000 and took home about $5,000.\n\nResearchers looked at both insured and uninsured patients. Those affected the most by these costs are patients and families without insurance, the study said. Underinsured or uninsured patients sought higher donation amounts, and received only about 19% of their goal on average.\n\n\"Although the Affordable Care Act reduced the uninsured rate, cost containment measures have not been realized by all patients,\" the study noted.", "description": "The cost of cancer treatment has gotten so high that patients and their families are turning to crowdfunding websites, like GoFundMe.
