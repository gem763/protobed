He added that bank employees \u201cbelieved that the transactions in question would be processed outside the U.S. financial system.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nAs part of the agreement, British Arab neither admitted to nor denied the alleged violations.\n\nThe settlement is the latest since the U.S. eased sanctions against Sudan in 2017. The Trump administration removed sanctions that blocked American investment and trade with Sudan but left in place other punitive measures such as the inclusion of Sudan on the state sponsor of terrorism list.\n\nBritish Arab allegedly processed 72 so-called \u201cbulk funding\u201d transactions related to Sudan between 2010 and 2014, totalling around $191 million, according to the settlement agreement. The Treasury said in the agreement that the bank operated U.S.-dollar accounts for at least seven Sudanese financial institutions, including the Central Bank of Sudan.\n\nBritish Arab also set up a funding arrangement that it believed wouldn\u2019t involve U.S. jurisdiction, the Treasury said. British Arab allegedly set up a U.S.-dollar account with a non-U.S. bank located in a country that imports Sudanese-origin oil to facilitate payments related to Sudan, and transferred periodic U.S.-dollar-denominated funds from other non-U.S. financial institutions in Europe to fund that account, according to the settlement. British Arab then used the account to facilitate payments for its Sudanese clients, the settlement said.\n\nThe funding arrangement was set up in a way that British Arab believed that the U.S.-dollar-denominated transactions would be settled outside of the U.S., without going through the U.S. financial system, according to the settlement.\n\nHowever, the Sudan-related payments that British Arab processed outside of the U.S. were financed by transactions that were routed through multiple U.S. financial institutions and utilized the U.S. financial system, according to the settlement.\n\nOFAC said British Arab notified the agency in 2014 about an internal investigation into possible sanctions violations.\n\nBritish Arab has taken steps to remediate the issue, including exiting the Sudanese market in late 2014, OFAC said. The company also hired new senior management, including a new chief executive, chief financial officer, chief compliance officer and general counsel, according to OFAC.\n\nWrite to Mengqi Sun at mengqi.sun@wsj.com", "description": "British Arab Commercial Bank agreed to pay $4 million to settle allegations that it violated U.S. sanctions on Sudan, the U.S. Treasury Department said.", "authors": ["Mengqi Sun"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-108349/social", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
