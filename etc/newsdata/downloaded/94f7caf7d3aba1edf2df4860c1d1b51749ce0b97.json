This process will only start now to give the SANC the opportunity to investigate,\" she added.\n\nDuring Williams' bail application in the Blue Downs Magistrate's Court, the hospital's head of administration, Philip Wolfaard, told magistrate Bukiwa Sambudla that she faced possible suspension for bringing the hospital into disrepute and could also face disciplinary action if reported to the SANC.\n\nThe Daily Voice reported that Sambudla had scrapped Williams' 24-hour house arrest on Monday.\n\nSambudla reportedly said it was in the court's view not in the interest of justice to allow Williams to work with the vulnerable, including children, the sick or disabled.\n\nWilliams, Princess Gopie, Porcha Jonkers, Amber Booysen and Desmond Alexander were charged following the attack on Van Niekerk.\n\nThe Elsies River woman is accused of threatening Van Niekerk with her two dogs, saying in Afrikaans they would \"bite out your vagina\".\n\nVan Niekerk was allegedly beaten with a knobkerrie and forced to eat dog faeces from a clear bag after being warned not to vomit \"because her kitchen is clean\".\n\nAfterwards, Williams reportedly took the two dogs and Van Niekerk to Jonkers' house and got into an argument with Jonkers, also for allegedly sleeping with her boyfriend.\n\nShe then allegedly assaulted her with a dog chain. Jonkers said she almost lost consciousness when Williams allegedly tried to strangle her with it, but Gopie intervened.\n\nWilliams allegedly took the dog faeces that she had brought with her, threw it on the ground and made Van Niekerk eat it again.\n\nVan Niekerk was also allegedly hit with the knobkerrie.\n\nThe case has been postponed to November 22.", "description": "Cape Town theatre nurse Elizabeth Williams, who is accused of forcing a love rival to eat dog faeces, is no longer employed by Tygerberg Hospital.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9192/10b1cc8fc2b64a9b96006e0ecf8b3958.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
