Tevez\u2019s goals in the run-in helped the Hammers escape relegation at the Yorkshire club\u2019s expense.\n\nIt will take more than a point to erase the sense of injustice still felt by some at Bramall Lane about the affair, but Mousset\u2019s 69th-minute equaliser that cancelled out Robert Snodgrass\u2019s 44th -minute opening goal ensured Chris Wilder\u2019s side derived a measure of satisfaction from the first league meeting between the two clubs since.\n\nMousset, signed from Bournemouth for \u00a310 million, had been dropped to the bench despite his winner against Arsenal on Monday. Within six minutes of being introduced, he had struck again, finishing with a first-time shot after West Ham failed to clear George Baldock\u2019s cross, preserving his side\u2019s unbeaten away record since returning to the Premier League.\n\n\u201cHe is still not up to speed and a lot was taken out of him on Monday, not just physically but psychologically too,\u201d said the Sheffield United manager. \u201cIt can be the easy thing to keep the right team but I didn\u2019t think it was the right thing to do. For him to come on is great for him. He looked a threat. He is difficult to play against and I\u2019m delighted he finished that opportunity.\u201d", "description": "Lys Mousset proved Sheffield United\u2019s saviour for the second time in a week, and silenced those West Ham United fans wearing Carlos Tevez face masks.", "authors": ["Ian Whittell", "Sam Wallace"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/26/TELEMMGLPICT000214214020-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq-pfgFGBz9L_4V5dRQnfCxd6yN5CV7Pul_xM_LGnPwu0.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
