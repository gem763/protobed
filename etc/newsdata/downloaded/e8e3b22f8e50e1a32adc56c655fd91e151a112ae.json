That included Mamayev playing a soccer game in an exercise yard on Valentine\u2019s Day while in pre-trial custody.\n\nThey will be released on Sept. 17 if there is no appeal from prosecutors. The court said prosecutors supported the parole.\n\nKokorin has played 48 times for Russia, while Mamayev made 15 international appearances from 2010-16. Kokorin is a free agent, though Zenit hasn\u2019t ruled out re-signing, while Krasnodar has tried to cancel its contract with Mamayev.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/tag/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Two Russian national team soccer players were let out on parole Friday after serving part of their prison sentences for a series of brawls.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/06/russia_players_paroled_57061_c0-242-3760-2434_s1770x1032.jpg?731111463bd7df3aa8bc0ba3dcc180adaea7d5d7", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
