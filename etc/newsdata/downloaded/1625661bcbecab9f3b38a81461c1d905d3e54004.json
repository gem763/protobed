It dates from 10 days after Mr Johnson became prime minister.\n\nRetailers said the document confirmed what they have been saying will happen in the event of a no-deal Brexit.\n\n\"Fresh food availability will decrease, consumer choice will decrease, and prices will rise,\" Helen Dickinson of the British Retail Consortium said.\n\nAnd the British Medical Association described the Yellowhammer file as \"alarming\" and that it confirmed its warnings about no-deal, including the threat of medical supply shortages.\n\nLabour's shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer said: \"These documents confirm the severe risks of a no-deal Brexit, which Labour has worked so hard to block.\n\n\"It is completely irresponsible for the government to have tried to ignore these stark warnings and prevent the public from seeing the evidence.\"\n\nMPs voted on Monday to order the release of all internal correspondence and communications, including e-mails, texts and WhatsApp messages, between nine No 10 advisers relating to Parliament's suspension.\n\nBut the government has said it will not comply with the MPs' request, citing potential legal breaches of data protection and employment rights.\n\nThis is not an \"old\" Yellowhammer assessment, as was claimed by the government in August.\n\nIt is from the latest internal no-deal planning, from August, from well within the time of Boris Johnson's administration.\n\nThe government hopes that its recent efforts will change some of the most concerning aspects of what is titled a \"reasonable worst case assumptions\" document, but they are yet to be able to make those changes.\n\nEverything hinges on the core assumption made about disruption to freight traffic across the Channel - that over half would be stuck for up to two and a half days.\n\nThose assumptions on trade flow have improved recently, but are still poor, and enough to have several highly concerning consequences, from fresh food supply, to stability in Northern Ireland, to social care providers and supplies of medicines for people and animals.\n\nI have also been assured that a widely circulated version of this document, from the same day, had the phrase \"base scenario\".\n\nIt is somewhat confusing that there can be a base case of a worst case planning assumption.\n\nIn any event, these are the real, plausible short-term shocks from a no-deal Brexit.\n\nThe section on Northern Ireland is particularly concerning. In many respects it is incredible to have such a list of the plausible consequences of what is government policy.\n\nIt is not difficult to see why the government resisted its release. It is unlikely to improve the mood of an already sceptical Commons.\n\nBut it is really the first tangible, quotable, warts and all assessment of what Whitehall fears could be around the corner.\n\nMr Gove said the legal advice received by Mr Johnson before requesting the prorogation of Parliament was in the public domain after being disclosed as part of the ongoing court cases, but there was no justification for the \"far broader\" information being sought.\n\n\"To name individuals without any regard for their rights or the consequences of doing so goes far beyond any reasonable right of Parliament under this procedure.\n\n\"These individuals have no right of reply, and the procedure used fails to afford them any of the protections that would properly be in place.\n\n\"It offends against basic principles of fairness and the Civil Service duty of care towards its employees,\" he said.\n\nHe said it was ministers, not civil servants or special advisers, who were ultimately accountable to Parliament for decisions taken.\n\nThe request, therefore was \"inappropriate in principle and in practice, would on its own terms purport to require the government to contravene the law, and is singularly unfair to the named individuals\".", "description": "The Yellowhammer plan warns of riots and food price rises but ministers say it is not a prediction.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/182D1/production/_108752099_mediaitem108757467.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
