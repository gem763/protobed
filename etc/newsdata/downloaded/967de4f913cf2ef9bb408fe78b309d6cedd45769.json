Love my brothers! Thank you for all the prayers! Everything looking good so far!\u201d Mahomes tweeted.\n\nMahomes, 24, was injured early in the second quarter on a fourth-down quarterback sneak. Last year\u2019s NFL Most Valuable Player was helped off the field by trainers.\n\nThe Chiefs improved to 5-2, two games ahead of Oakland atop the AFC West division.\n\nIf the short-term timetable is correct, Mahomes would miss home games against Green Bay and Minnesota as well as a November 10 trip to Tennessee.\n\nAfter that comes a November 18 contest at the Los Angeles Chargers followed by an off week, so if Mahomes needs more time to recover he could get two weeks while missing only one more game.\n\nKansas City\u2019s next contest after that would be a December 1 home clash with Oakland. A week later comes a high-profile matchup at New England against the currently undefeated Patriots, the reigning Super Bowl champions led by six-time NFL champion Tom Brady.", "description": "New York (AFP) \u2013 Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes has a dislocated right kneecap and will miss at least three weeks of the NFL season", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/19/d906fb_kansas-city-chiefs-quarterback-patrick-mahomes-is-helped-off-field-suffering-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
