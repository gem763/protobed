And in some ways, it really is. Dumb because it\u2019s a yes-or-no question \u2014 the kind that\u2019s bad for quotes and uninviting to follow ups. And dumb because the answer, as it turns out, is as self-evident as it seems.\n\nBut that\u2019s precisely why I don\u2019t get it! Which brings me back to confusion, questions.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nSo much of sports writing is done from a perspective of practiced familiarity. We ask players about the sport as people who can never understand it on a bodily level as well as they do, but who endeavor to bridge that divide as seamlessly as possible. In other words, we try not to look stupid by marveling, say, at the basic locomotions of the game. Sure, a monster home run or a nasty strikeout will inspire headlines about superhuman power and deftness. But, apparently, you\u2019re not supposed to say that pop flies seem really hard to catch and that making soft contact stings like hell.\n\nOr, that the most impressive part of a diving catch is not the catch but the dive and the fact that they do it at all because: Doesn\u2019t that hurt?\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Cubs outfielder Jason Heyward.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not as bad as you think,\u201d said Yankees center fielder Cameron Maybin. Except that\u2019s not saying much because I think it seems really, really bad.\n\nStory continues\n\nThink about it: Do you ever land face first on the ground as part of your job? And if you did, wouldn\u2019t that be the end of strenuous physical activity for the day, if not the week? I don\u2019t mean that facetiously or as part of a self-effacing punchline. I\u2019m used to seeing all sorts of athletic feats beyond my personal capabilities on a professional stage. But it\u2019s not that I can\u2019t imagine what it would feel like to belly flop onto the unforgiving earth \u2014 it\u2019s that I can. Which is why I never do it, at least not on purpose.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t wanna say \u2018hurt.\u2019 It feels like \u2026 backyard football? You ever play backyard football? It just feels like playing backyard football,\u201d Maybin said.\n\nBut I don\u2019t play backyard football. Not at 29 years old.\n\n\u201cWhen you think that, your feet are on hard ground. You\u2019re not really thinking about the grass. You\u2019re not diving in here, you\u2019re on grass,\u201d Maybin explained from Yankee Stadium\u2019s carpeted clubhouse.\n\nConditions do seem to be key. Not all diving catches are created equal when it comes to the pain factor.\n\n\u201cIf the ground is wet, you slide. If you were running really fast and you got momentum and you actually slide well, no,\u201d said veteran Diamondbacks outfielder Adam Jones, asked whether diving catches hurt. \u201cIf you don\u2019t land well, yes.\u201d\n\n\u201cBest time is when it\u2019s been raining. You slide, it\u2019s easy,\u201d Giants outfielder Mike Yastrzemski said. \u201cWarning tracks are not fun, walls are not fun. The wall is the last place you want to be.\u201d\n\nAlas, sometimes the last place you want to be is exactly where you are.\n\n\u201cYears ago, I caught it right at the wall, it was off [Robinson] Cano,\u201d Jones said. \u201cAs soon as I caught it, I smashed into the wall. Next thing I knew, I had a busted bursa sac in my knee and had to get it drained. It looked like Zinfandel.\u201d\n\n(Apologies for including that analogy, but how much zin were you drinking anyway? Red, not white.)\n\nAnd sometimes it\u2019s not the place on the field but the ballpark itself that\u2019s the problem. Rays center fielder Kevin Kiermaier is a web gem machine, which is all the more impressive when you consider he\u2019s making half those catches on artificial turf.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s non-forgiving,\u201d he said. \u201cIf your skin is just rubbing on that, it\u2019s gonna give you a nice little friction burn. Those don\u2019t feel good. I feel it five to 10 minutes afterward and then when I go shower. I have cuts constantly here from the outfield and then that hot water hits you, you realize that my skin was a little bit more banged up than I thought.\u201d\n\nKK's good for at least one of these a game.\n\n\n\n... and it never gets old. pic.twitter.com/AAkGcptqVa \u2014 Tampa Bay Rays (@RaysBaseball) June 30, 2018\n\nSo, OK, sounds like it hurts. And me? I don\u2019t think I could make myself do it again after the first busted bursa sac or thigh-length turf burn.\n\n\u201cYes you would,\u201d Jones said. \u201cIf you were on the field, you would.\u201d\n\nHow?\n\n\u201cAdrenaline,\u201d Kiermaier said. \u201cIf I did that just on my own time, it wouldn\u2019t feel great. But when you\u2019re out there in front of all the fans and everything, you see the ball in the air, for me I have a mindset where my eyes just light up. I can\u2019t really speak for anyone else but for me: Adrenaline.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen the adrenaline goes away, that\u2019s when it hurts the most,\u201d Heyward said.\n\nThat seems to be the consensus. Ask about it in the clubhouse a few hours before game time and you\u2019ll get seemingly logically inconsistent answers that Yes, it hurts, and No, if it comes up tonight, I won\u2019t hesitate to hurl my only body onto the ground despite an evolutionary human inclination to preserve the species by avoiding experiences that previously induced pain.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not even thinking about it. You just go for the ball and jumping or diving, stuff just happens,\u201d said Padres rookie shortstop Fernando Tatis Jr., who after taking the art of bodily disregard into the infield, has missed the latter part of his rookie season because of a stress reaction in his lower back. (That injury came from repeated swings.)\n\n\u201cIt does hurt, but it\u2019s part of our job and it\u2019s what we gotta do for the game,\u201d he added.\n\nHe would say that. He\u2019s 20. Maybin, 32, said that he\u2019ll still sacrifice his safety for a catch \u2014 but it better be a sure thing.\n\n\u201cEarly in my career, it was like, run into walls, dive for everything. Now it\u2019s like, OK let me take care of my body. So if I can\u2019t catch this standing up, I gotta know I can catch it diving if I\u2019m gonna lay out.\u201d\n\nMakes sense, especially when you consider that it feels a hell of a lot worse to fall flat on your face for no reason at all.\n\n\u201cIt always hurts, but when you make the play, it feels a lot better. You don\u2019t feel it as much,\u201d Yastrzemski said. \u201cBut when you feel the ball trickle back behind you going to the wall you kinda lay there like, yeah that hurt a little more.\u201d\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Diving catches look painful.
