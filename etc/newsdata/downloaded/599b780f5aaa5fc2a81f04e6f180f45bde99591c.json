In a memo forwarded to TIME, Herring clarified to staff that while clerks are still obligated to ask about race, respondents should not be denied marriage licenses for refusing to answer.\n\nHerring\u2019s memo said that, in his conclusion, the state law \u201cdoes not require a clerk to refuse to issue a marriage license when the applicant declines to identify his or her race, and that clerks should issue a license regardless of an applicant\u2019s answer or non-answer to that inquiry.\u201d\n\nHerring\u2019s office confirmed to TIME that the Virginia State Registrar has sent court clerks new marriage license forms, which now includes the option \u201cDeclined to Answer\u201d by the question asking about applicants\u2019 race.\n\nThose changes follow a federal lawsuit filed earlier this month by three couples who allege that a Virginia law requiring marriage applicants to identify their race is unconstitutional.\n\nSeptember\u2019s lawsuit was brought by Virginia civil rights lawyer Victor M. Glasberg, reported the Richmond Times-Dispatch. The suit argued that Virginia\u2019s race question on marriage applications, \u201creflects a regulatory scheme embodied in the Virginia Racial Integrity Act of 1924, originally called \u2018An Act to Preserve the Integrity of the White Race.\u2019 The requirement to identify by \u2018race\u2019 uses terms grounded in ignorance and bigotry, not in science.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were happy to help quickly resolve this issue and get these couples what they asked for,\u201d said Herring in a statement to TIME. \u201cThese changes will ensure that no Virginian will be forced to label themselves in order to get married. I appreciate the courage these couples showed in raising this issue, and I wish them all the best in their lives together.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday, Herring tweeted out an article on the state\u2019s rule change for marriage licenses, writing, \u201cGlad we were able to help resolve this situation quickly.\u201d\n\nGlad we were able to help resolve this situation quickly. https://t.co/bfK4m1RmQ7 \u2014 Mark Herring (@MarkHerringVA) September 14, 2019\n\nThat change comes just over half a century after the landmark 1967 Loving v. Virginia decision, in which the Supreme Court struck down the state\u2019s law against interracial marriage and invalidated similar laws in 15 other states.\n\nHerring, a Democrat, was embroiled in a scandal that nearly swamped the party\u2019s state leadership this past February, after he admitted that he had worn blackface while at college. That revelation followed the emergence of a racist photo from Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam\u2019s 1984 medical school yearbook, and sexual assault allegations against lieutenant governor Justin Fairfax.", "description": "The state has new forms, which let applicants \u201cDeclined to Answer\u201d about race", "authors": ["Alejandro De La Garza"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/mg3suiJ8beDthMK8oyTtlQ--~B/aD02ODM7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/cfa3d1035d99f90be8c43c5c3a09e961"}
