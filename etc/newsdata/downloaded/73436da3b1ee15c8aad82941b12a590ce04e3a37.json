The second one was the protector,\u201d said the actor, 72. \u201cNow I have grown a conscience in this one.\u201d\n\nBut fans can rest assured that, even if he has become more human, the Terminator is a long way from laying down his weapons.\n\nThe ingredients that made the original movie and its acclaimed sequel \u201cTerminator 2: Judgment Day\u201d such hits remain in place \u2014 breathless chases, spectacular shoot-outs and fight scenes laden with state-of-the-art special effects.\n\nGlossing over the other, poorly received sequels and spin-offs that came after \u201cT2,\u201d the latest film also reconnects with another key element from the first two films \u2014 Linda Hamilton, more angry than ever in her role as Sarah Connor.\n\nMost of the film takes place in 2022, but it begins where \u201cTerminator 2\u201d left off in 1991 \u2014 Connor has just prevented the future eradication of the human race by machines equipped with artificial intelligence known as Skynet.\n\n\u2013 \u2018You\u2019re just afraid\u2019 \u2013\n\nFor Hamilton, the decision to return to this iconic role 28 years later was not an easy one. She told AFP how she had long since built a comfortable life for herself away from big Hollywood productions.\n\n\u201cIt took me a long time to agree to do it,\u201d she said. \u201cI eventually started going, \u2018You\u2019re just afraid.\u2019\n\n\u201cAnd when I\u2019m afraid, then I have to do it.\u201d\n\nMore than letting down the audience, \u201cI was afraid I was going to disappoint Sarah Connor,\u201d admitted Hamilton, 63.\n\n\u201cAll these years I sort of felt like the first two films were very complete and resisted doing any more, largely because Jim Cameron wasn\u2019t involved.\u201d\n\nCameron returns not just as a producer for \u201cDark Fate\u201d but also participated in writing the script, while Tim Miller (\u201cDeadpool\u201d) directs.\n\nDesperate and aimless, \u201cSarah Connor is no longer human,\u201d said Hamilton. \u201cAnd the Arnold character is more human \u2014 I like that flip.\u201d\n\nAnxious not to reveal plot details, Hamilton said that beyond its action scenes, the film \u2014 like its predecessors \u2014 is about \u201cwhat is it that makes us human.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Testosterone \u2013\n\nThe film sees Connor find a new raison d\u2019etre in protecting young Dani Ramos (Natalia Reyes), who is being pursued by the most sophisticated-yet Terminator from the future (Gabriel Luna).\n\nA human \u201caugmented\u201d by technology and also sent from the future, played by Mackenzie Davis, is also part of the chase.\n\nFor Hamilton, signing back up meant a year of strenuous physical training \u2014 and the even more unpleasant experience of taking testosterone prescribed by her doctor to help her build muscle.\n\n\u201cThere came a day where I was angry about something and I couldn\u2019t sleep and my blood pressure is spiking and I\u2019m kind of flying off the handle. And, I\u2019m like, \u2018This is the hormones talking,\u2019\u201d Hamilton recalled.\n\n\u201cIf this is what it feels like to be a man, forget it!\u201d\n\nFormer \u201cMr Universe\u201d winner Schwarzenegger, who continues to train every day, had it easier.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not as if I have to start all over again,\u201d he told AFP.\n\nFor him, the main challenge was acting in front of green screens used to later generate computer-driven special effects.\n\n\u201cIt gets a little bit more tedious, because you\u2019re now working a lot of times with stuff that doesn\u2019t exist,\u201d he said. \u201cSo when you have a Hummer fly towards you, when you\u2019re inside the airplane and you\u2019re crashing, it was really never there.\u201d\n\nWhile Schwarzenegger has been repeating \u201cI\u2019ll be back\u201d \u2014 his famous line from the original \u2014 since 1984, it is Hamilton who steals the phrase in \u201cDark Fate.\u201d But will either of them sign up for more Terminator films?\n\n\u201cIf the fans want to see more of me, they will make the voices be heard\u2026 It\u2019s kind of like in politics \u2014 the people should decide,\u201d joked the former governor of California.\n\n\u201cIt depends on how this movie performs \u2014 it\u2019s a really very expensive film,\u201d said Hamilton, adding that the film was envisioned as the start of a new trilogy.\n\n\u201cI might be back.\u201d", "description": "Los Angeles (AFP) \u2013 The Terminator has come a long way since Arnold Schwarzenegger first portrayed the cyborg assassin in James Cameron\u2019s 1984", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/29/347cd4_arnold-schwarzenegger-linda-hamilton-are-reprising-roles-terminator-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
