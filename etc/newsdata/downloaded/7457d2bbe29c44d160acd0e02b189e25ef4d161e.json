News of the supposed \"bombshell\" prompted calls from numerous 2020 Democratic candidates to impeach Kavanaugh.\n\n'PART OF WHAT MOTIVATED' CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD WAS TO PUT POLITICAL 'ASTERISK' ON KAVANAUGH, LAWYER ADMITS\n\nIn a major revision late Sunday, a Times editors' note added a significant detail \u2014 that several friends of the alleged victim said she did not recall the purported sexual assault in question at all. The Times also stated for the first time that the alleged victim had refused to be interviewed and has made no comment about the episode.\n\nThe only firsthand statement concerning the supposed attack in the original piece, which was published on Saturday, came from a Clinton-connected lawyer, Max Stier, who claimed to have witnessed it.\n\nThe Times' revision says: \"Editors' Note: An earlier version of this article, which was adapted from a forthcoming book, did not include one element of the book's account regarding an assertion by a Yale classmate that friends of Brett Kavanaugh pushed his penis into the hand of a female student at a drunken dorm party. The book reports that the female student declined to be interviewed and friends say that she does not recall the incident. That information has been added to the article.\"\n\nScarborough noted that author and Fox News contributor Mollie Hemingway first pointed out the \"glaring omission.\"\n\n\u201cThere were Mollie Hemingway and others on Twitter saying that, in fact, she had no recollection of this happening and her friends were saying the same thing,\" he noted to AP White House reporter Jonathan Lemire.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"I could not believe The New York Times would write this piece without that information contained in it. Are you surprised 24 hours ... went by before they clarified that fact?\u201d\n\nHe also hit the Times for failing to note that Stier was the opposing counsel of Kavanaugh in the Monica Lewinsky case.\n\n\"I just don't understand why they didn't put this information in the article.\"\n\nFox News' Gregg Re contributed to this report.", "description": "MSNBC host Joe Scarborough expressed disbelief Monday that the New York Times ran an explosive story about a supposed new allegation against\u00a0Supreme Court Justice\u00a0Brett Kavanaugh\u00a0without including key information about the alleged vicitm.", "authors": ["David Montanaro", "David Montanaro Is A Senior Editor With Fox News."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/Scarboroug-Kavanaugh-NYT.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
