(Rich Pedroncelli/AP)\n\nColt, a U.S. firearms company that traces its history to the 1830s, announced Thursday that it would suspend the production of rifles for the civilian market \u2014 including the AR-15, a weapon infamous for its popularity among the country\u2019s mass shooters.\n\nThere are already so many of the weapons in the country that the market is saturated and executives decided \u201cit is good sense to follow consumer demand,\u201d the manufacturer\u2019s president and chief executive said in a statement.\n\n\u201cGiven this level of manufacturing capacity, we believe there is adequate supply for modern sporting rifles for the foreseeable future,\u201d Dennis Veilleux said, adding that the pivot was not permanent.\n\nThe announcement comes at the tail end of a summer bookended by mass shootings in Virginia Beach; El Paso; Dayton, Ohio; and West Texas and as Democratic candidates for president have ratcheted up rhetoric on gun control.\n\nAt the Sept. 12 Democratic presidential debate, former congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke said he is committed to a mandatory buyback of assault-style rifles.\n\n\u201cWhen we see that being used against children,\u201d he said, \u201chell yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.\u201d\n\nVeilleux said his company remains a fierce advocate for gun rights and for the consumer gun market.\n\n\u201cColt has been a stout supporter of the Second Amendment for over 180 years, remains so, and will continue to provide its customers with the finest quality firearms in the world,\u201d he said.\n\nThe company will concentrate on its military and law enforcement contracts, which Veilleux said are \u201cabsorbing all of Colt\u2019s manufacturing capacity for rifles.\u201d\n\nIn the past few years, major retailers across the country have curbed or discontinued gun sales \u2014 pressed by public outcry but also by competition from local firearm stores and online retailers.\n\nIn 2015, Walmart stopped selling the AR-15 and other semiautomatic weapons. And in early September \u2014 after two deadly shootings inside its stores this summer \u2014 the retail giant announced that it would stop selling ammunition for military-style weapons, and it asked customers not to openly carry firearms in its stores.\n\nLast year, Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods stopped selling assault-style weapons, and in March the retailer announced that it would pull all guns and ammunition off the shelves of nearly 20 percent of its stores.\n\nAn article in the National Rifle Association\u2019s Shooting Illustrated last week foreshadowed Colt\u2019s shift. Paul Spitale, Colt\u2019s senior vice president for commercial business, told the publication that his company had seen \u201ca pretty sharp decline in rifle sales\u201d and a \u201csignificant inventory buildup by our distributors.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe listen to our customers,\u201d Spitale said. \u201cThe whole basis for our reorganization was consumer feedback. ... It\u2019s not forever.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAs mass shootings rise, experts say high-capacity magazines should be the focus\n\nThis back-to-school PSA from Sandy Hook Promise is a punch in the gut\n\nThe terrible numbers that grow with each mass shooting", "description": "\"We believe there is adequate supply for modern sporting rifles for the foreseeable future,\" the gunmaker's president said.", "authors": ["Reis Thebault", "National", "Breaking News Reporter", "September At Pm", "Reis Thebault Is A Reporter Covering National", "Breaking News.
