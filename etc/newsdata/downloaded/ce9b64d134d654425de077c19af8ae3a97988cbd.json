On YouTube, Instagram, Facebook and Twitch, there is an ecosystem of users who publish videos of themselves performing vape tricks (playing with the smoke that comes out from e-cigarettes), reviewing flavors and equipment, or showing users how to cook up their own vape liquids. Millions watch them every day.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn recent weeks, this community has been rocked by the national discussion around vaping, driven in part by the federal investigation of more than 450 cases of lung disease linked to e-cigarettes, including six deaths. Many of these patients have reported using cannabis cartridges, but health officials say it is too early to eliminate other types of vaping.\n\nPeople such as Culley, who call themselves \u201cvape advocates,\u201d \u201cvape influencers\u201d or \u201cprofessional vapers,\u201d have feared for days that amid the highly publicized reports of these deaths, officials might respond to pressure from vape critics with a blanket ban on flavored e-cigarettes. They have worried that adult vapers \u2014 their peers, their subscribers and themselves \u2014 might become collateral damage in a debate that has focused predominantly on the negative effects of vaping on youth smokers.\n\nOn Wednesday, they said, these fears were confirmed.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt was one of the worst days that I\u2019ve experienced in the vaping community,\u201d Culley said in an interview.\n\nMatthew Elliott, a 28-year-old \u201cvape influencer\u201d from Long Island, said: \u201cMy first reaction was that I almost threw up. I was sick to my stomach.\u201d\n\nSome of these influencers, nearly all of whom turned to vaping as a means of quitting smoking, worry that without flavored e-cigarettes, they will slip back into smoking regular cigarettes, which health experts agree is more harmful than vaping. Others say that they will \u201cfigure out a way\u201d to get their favorite flavors but that the proposed ban will probably create a wider black market for first-time users, including children. Several influencers who produce vaping-related content for a living are starting to consider alternative careers.\n\nAD\n\nAs of 2017, slightly fewer than 7 million adults used e-cigarettes, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Professional vapers claim that this number is much higher today and that a significant percentage will turn against President Trump if he pushes the ban through.\n\nAD\n\nAdults like flavors, too\n\nSupporters of the ban say it is meant to target the growing use of e-cigarettes among teenagers who favor fruity, menthol or mint flavors. But Tony Brittan, who uploads vaping videos at Vapor Trail Channel on YouTube, says the range of flavors is also what draws many adult users away from cigarettes and toward vaping. His personal favorites are cereal- and oat-flavored liquids.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the thing that differentiates vaping from the cigarettes. After you taste some of these flavors, you won\u2019t want the tobacco ones,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they take the flavors away, I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to stay off the cigarettes.\u201d\n\nCulley said most adult vapers agree that just-tobacco liquid tastes bad; some also feel turned off by the taste because it reminds them of cigarettes.\n\n\u201cThe youths are experimenting with these products, and frankly it\u2019s ruining it for the rest of us,\u201d Elliott said.\n\nElliott, who has worked in a vape shop and at an e-liquid company and now works full time as a professional vaper, said that if the ban goes through, he expects that he will have to find a new line of work.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to have to go back to security or bartending,\u201d he said. \u201cI based the last five years of my life around this industry.\u201d\n\nOther influencers say they are less concerned in the short term, because they serve an international market and have developed direct relationships with companies based overseas, though they note that the future of the industry remains murky.\n\n\u201cBecause of this anti-vaping backlash, could YouTube ban us at some point?\u201d Culley asked. \u201cWe really don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nYouTube did not respond to inquiries asking whether it planned to change any of its rules around vaping-related content but wrote that the platform generally does not prohibit videos that show vaping unless it includes inappropriate content, including, for example, minors smoking.\n\nAD\n\nProfessional vapers say that their goal is not to spread smoking to children and that, based on viewership statistics, their audiences largely comprise adults. All the influencers interviewed for this report have warnings on their accounts and videos saying that their content is not designed for those below the age of 18 or 21.\n\nAD\n\nHer temperature spiked the day she decided to stop vaping. Now she\u2019s on life support.\n\nVape critics and health officials say there is a spreading epidemic of youth e-cigarette use in the country. But professional vapers say the number often cited \u2014 more than a quarter of high school students have used e-cigarettes in the past 30 days \u2014 over-represents how many teenagers are regularly using e-cigarettes. They also argue that the vaping-related deaths in recent weeks have been linked to a specific type of liquid and not to all flavored e-cigarettes.\n\nThe government\u2019s response, they argue, has been the equivalent of \u201cpublic hysteria.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s literally like if there\u2019s a salmonella outbreak \u2014 and this happens all the time \u2014 and this comes from a specific kind of broccoli, and the FDA comes out and says: \u2018You know what? Just stop eating for the next six months. Just in case,\u2019 \u201d professional vaper Ryan Hall said in a video that has been watched more than 92,000 times. \u201cIt\u2019s literally that ridiculous, what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nA vow to #Resist\n\nHours after Trump announced the plans for a ban on Wednesday, a meme started circulating among vaping enthusiasts. It shows Trump with his hands up, holding two bouquets of cigarettes in each fist. Underneath, in bolded text, is the phrase, \u201cMAKE AMERICA SMOKE AGAIN.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nProfessional vapers have shared this meme widely, some using the hashtag #Resist and others writing long captions vowing to fight the ban. Vaping enthusiasts who connect online or meet at conferences held across the country every year belong to a tightknit community, in part because many bond over the experience of quitting regular cigarettes for e-cigarettes, Culley said.\n\n\u201cWe feel like these products saved our lives,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are super passionate about vaping, and I don\u2019t think people outside vaping understand that.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nElliot said just hours after the announcement that he had heard of \u201cmany people in the industry who were die-hard supporters of President Trump who have now denounced their support of him.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of revolting in a sense,\u201d said Daniel Batista, another influencer who posts on YouTube as DJLsb Vapes. \u201cThe government is lying to its citizens.\u201d\n\nAt the Oval Office meeting Wednesday, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said the administration is working on a plan to \u201cclear the market\u201d of flavored e-cigarettes that is likely to go into effect next week.\n\nSome professional vapers such as Elliott say they intend to fight the ban until the day it is implemented. Others are less optimistic.\n\n\u201cPeople are outraged, confused, bewildered, [but] when you\u2019re up against the government, it\u2019s very hard to fight,\u201d Brittan said.\n\nAD\n\nAt the end of his 30-minute live stream Wednesday, Culley, sitting in front of a shelf crowded with vape equipment, told viewers to keep their heads up.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tough, it\u2019s been a [bad] couple weeks,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just got to do everything we can and see how this all plays out.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nA woman has been in a coma for weeks after using mercury-tainted skin cream\n\nSixth person dies of vaping-related illness\n\nOpioid crackdown forces pain patients to taper off drugs they say they need", "description": "On YouTube and elsewhere, an ecosystem of users says the government is overreacting, harming livelihoods and driving people back to tobacco cigarettes.", "authors": ["Rebecca Tan", "Local Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/rkOs66uH2vvr5b-GdyocbU_tQEo=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/J5QMD7GVOYI6TCJEDW35VR4X7M.jpg"}
