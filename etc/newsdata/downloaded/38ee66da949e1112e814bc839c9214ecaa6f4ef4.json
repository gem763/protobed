In the wake of mass killings there and in places such as Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, last year, the call for reforms \u2014 such as raising age limits for gun purchases, expanding background checks, or banning assault weapons \u2014 has grown louder. But outright gun bans of the sort undertaken by the United Kingdom, Australia or New Zealand are much more difficult to implement in the United States.\n\n'There is a legal headache'\n\nNew Zealand last year banned \"military-style\" firearms after a mass murderer used such weapons to kill 50 people in attacks on mosques in Christchurch. In the U.K., a mass shooting in Dunblane Primary School in Scotland in 1996 left 17 dead, including the shooter. The government reacted by banning all handguns \u2014 more powerful weapons had already been banned previously \u2014 and held a gun amnesty that collected more than 162,000 handguns. A gun amnesty lets people hand over weapons that may have been obtained illegally, without the fear of prosecution. Since Dunblane, only one mass shooting has taken place in the U.K., when 10 were killed in Cumbria in 2010.\n\nPrime Minister John Major with wife Norma lays floral tribute at Dunblane after the shooting tragedy on March 17, 1996.

The government implemented a ban on semi-automatic and automatic weapons, and also held a gun amnesty. A subsequent amnesty held last year saw Australians hand over more than 57,000 guns. The country hasn't had a mass shooting since the massacre in 1996. Countries such as the U.K and Australia can implement such policies, however, because they do not have a constitutional right to bear arms, Darrell Miller, a professor of law at Duke University, told CNBC last year. \"These are countries that don't have Second Amendment right to arms, so there's no constitutional right that has to be addressed with respect to gun reform policies of any type, whereas in the U.S., there is a legal headache,\" Miller said. \"The Amendment forbids similar measures.\"\n\nMembers of the audience listen at the National Rifle Association (NRA) Leadership Forum in Atlanta, Georgia on April 28, 2017.

An April report in the New Yorker indicated that the NRA has run into financial trouble this year.\n\nStates may be the place for activists to start", "description": "Activists point to New Zealand, UK and Australian gun control laws, but experts say their examples are hard for the USA to emulate.", "authors": ["Andrew Wong"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105045702-GettyImages-589140564.jpg?v=1532563674"}
