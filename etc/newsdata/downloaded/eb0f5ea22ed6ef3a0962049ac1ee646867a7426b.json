(Paul Chiasson/The Canadian Press)\n\nDuring the 2015 election, the Conservatives refused to participate in an English consortium debate, opting for alternative formats and triggering a debate about debates. The snub resulted in the creation of a Leaders' Debate Commission, led by former governor general David Johnston, tasked with organizing these English and French debates.\n\nIn order to qualify for the debate, the commission decided parties had to meet at least two of the three requirements:\n\nHave a member in the House of Commons elected under their party's banner.\n\nBe running candidates in at least 90 per cent of all ridings.\n\nCandidates secured at least four per cent of the vote in the last election or the party has a legitimate chance of winning seats, based on polling data and the discretion of the debate commissioner.\n\nThe requirements mean People's Party of Canada Leader Maxime Bernier did not automatically qualify for the debate. He's submitted a list of five PPC candidates he feels would have an advantage going into the campaign. The commission will make a final decision by Sept. 16.\n\nSeveral other independently organized debates are planned for the campaign, but Trudeau hasn't agreed to all of them. Macleans hosted the first debate in 2015 and will do so again on Sept. 12. The Conservatives, the NDP and the Greens are participating, but the Liberals have said no. The debate will go on regardless.\n\nThe Munk Debates also hope to reprise their 2015 showdown focused on foreign policy on Oct. 1. Again, Scheer, Singh and May have said they will take part, but Trudeau is out. Organizers are pressuring him to change his mind or else they'll set out an \"empty chair.\"\n\nTrudeau, however, has agreed to a TVA debate in Quebec, which hosted a French-language debate in 2015. He will be joined by Scheer, Singh and Blanchet on Oct. 2. The Greens were not invited.\n\nAsk a question\n\nThe Oct. 7 and Oct. 10 debates will include questions from the public. So here's your chance to get your question in. What would you like to ask the federal leaders?\n\nWrite your question in the box below. Some of the best will be selected and asked to the leaders.", "description": "Five federal party leaders will face off in the English-language debate on Oct.\u00a07.
