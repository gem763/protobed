The company has its sights set on entering China, which could be its most lucrative international market.\n\nChefs in Hong Kong, Macau, and Singapore are already using the plant-based patties, and CEO Pat Brown says he\u2019s laser-focused on further expansion in Asia.\n\n\u201cThe launches have been incredibly successful. Our sales in the past several months have grown fourfold in all those [Asian] markets. There are restaurants in Singapore, for example, where we outsell beef from a cow by four to one. We chose those cities, in part, because they\u2019re culinary crossroads, so we wanted to see how it would perform and how it would be received, served in traditional Asian cuisine,\u201d he told Yahoo Finance.\n\nClose-up of Impossible Whopper, a meat-free item using engineered, plant-protein based burger patty from food technology company Impossible, during a limited market test at a Burger King restaurant in the San Francisco Bay Area, Danville, California, June 26, 2019.

And the growth in China is vastly greater than overall global growth. And when you when you see fires coming out of the Amazon, it probably means someone in China is eating a burger,\u201d he said.\n\nCredit: David Foster/Yahoo Finance More\n\nBrown believes that if the success across Asia thus far is any indication, Chinese demand for the Impossible Burger will be insatiable.\n\n\u201dWe expect there to be tremendous, positive reception for our product in China. We've already seen it in the few cases we've tested. We're doing an event in Shanghai in November, where we have permission to serve our product in China, even though we haven't gone through all the regulatory hoops yet. And I think that's going to be a real great test. But so far, it's it's been great,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe hope to be selling in China within a year or two. We're looking for partners, we're talking to people \u2014 government leaders and party leaders. I think that there's a huge advantage for China, because they're totally import-dependent for their meat supply, and that\u2019s not a good place to be. So I think we have we have something that will be a huge win-win for Chinese consumers,\u201d he added.\n\nIn addition to U.S. competitors like Beyond Meat racing to get the Chinese eater, plenty of homegrown plant-based players are already up and running, including Shenzhen-based Whole Perfect Food.\n\nBrown also said he\u2019s talking with partners in Korea and Southeast Asia, though he wouldn\u2019t provide a concrete timeline.\n\nMelody Hahm is a senior correspondent at Yahoo Finance, covering entrepreneurship, technology and culture.
