First, the House Judiciary chair makes it crystal clear that he intends to impeach Donald Trump. Second, Nadler clearly wants to stay out of any calls to impeach Brett Kavanaugh, despite the hornet\u2019s nest the New York Times kicked over the weekend:\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee is too tied up with \u201cimpeaching the president\u201d to take immediate action on a potential investigation into sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler said Monday. \u201cWe have our hands full with impeaching the president right now and that\u2019s going to take up our limited resources and time for a while,\u201d Nadler said on WNYC when pressed by host Brian Lehrer.\n\nWell \u2026 that\u2019s one explanation, anyway. God forbid we should cheapen impeachment any more than it\u2019s already being cheapened by Nadler. Why not impeach Neil Gorsuch and Samuel Alito, too? How about an undersecretary or two at Justice while we\u2019re at it?\n\nAll of the calls for Kavanaugh\u2019s impeachment might well undermine what little support Nadler has. John wrote about the polling on this question earlier today, which was already bad and is getting worse the closer we get to the 2020 election. The gap between voters\u2019 interests and their perception of the party\u2019s interests should worry House Democrats heading into the next cycle, especially those who won their midterm elections in previous Republican districts.\n\nIf Nadler has to choose \u2014 and he clearly does \u2014 he\u2019s going to choose to pursue Trump, not Kavanaugh. The Democratic frontrunners might have climbed out onto the New York Times\u2019 limb before reality sawed it off, but Nadler doesn\u2019t have to follow suit. The facts haven\u2019t actually changed at all despite the hysteria on the Left over the weekend except to make the case against Kavanaugh weaker rather than stronger. Just because all of his friends jumped off a credibility bridge doesn\u2019t mean Nadler needs to do so, as the parents of teens are wont to scold.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean Nadler will take a pass on Kavanaugh entirely, of course. He tells Lehrer that he still wants to do a deep dive on Kavanaugh at some point:\n\nNadler said his first move to investigate Kavanaugh would come next month, when FBI Director Christopher Wray appears for a previously scheduled hearing that will now feature a significant focus on the Supreme Court justice\u2019s past \u2014 and whether the FBI\u2019s background check was thorough enough. Nadler said his panel\u2019s primary focus would be determining whether Kavanaugh lied to the Senate. \u201cThese deeds that he allegedly did years ago would be very relevant to a senator voting for or against his nomination,\u201d Nadler said.\n\nAh yes, the old \u201cKavanaugh\u2019s perjury\u201d canard. Not even Nadler was buying that at the time, and Wray has already testified to these exact questions almost a year ago. It\u2019ll be a rehash of old material at best, although exactly when that would take place is anyone\u2019s guess. Nadler has so many irons in the fire with Trump that it might take years before they get around to Kavanaugh, at which point even more people will be wondering what the point of such an investigation really is. Other than sour grapes, which also appears to be the prime motivating factor behind both demands for impeachment.\n\nUpdate: CNN\u2019s Chris Cillizza concludes that nothing\u2019s going to happen to Kavanaugh:\n\nEven if the Democratic-controlled House managed to impeach Kavanaugh \u2014 and that is no sure thing \u2014 there is almost no chance that the Senate would convict him. Republicans hold 53 Senate seats, which means that 20 of them would need to vote along with Democrats in order for Kavanaugh to be removed. Short of some hugely damning \u2014 and indisputably true \u2014 new facts about Kavanaugh\u2019s past, it\u2019s impossible to see such a thing happening. All of which means that no matter how many books get written about Kavanaugh\u2019s past, his future is almost certainly on the Supreme Court.\n\nThe same is true for Trump, except that impeachment might impact his re-election bid next year. How it would impact it is up for debate, of course. Kavanaugh, on the other hand, is on the Supreme Court for life. So what\u2019s the point?", "description": "Just (im)peachy.", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/nadler-hearing.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
