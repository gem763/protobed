(Photo: Jeenah Moon, AP)\n\nFour people were killed and three injured in a Saturday morning shooting at an illegal gambling site in Brooklyn, New York police said.\n\nThe shooting happened before 7 a.m. on Utica Avenue in the Crown Heights area, NYPD Chief of Detectives Dermot F. Shea said at a media briefing Saturday.\n\nShea described the scene as \"chaotic\" when officers first responded.\n\nTwo firearms were recovered and there's evidence of at least 15 shots fired, he said, adding that more firearms may be found.\n\nThe victims range in age from 32 to 49 years old. Four men died, and two men and one woman were injured. He described their injuries as non life-threatening and said they are receiving treatment at a hospital.\n\nHe said the families of the victims had not been notified but that two victims appeared to live outside New York while the others lived throughout Brooklyn.\n\nAn eighth person was injured in the leg while trying to flee the location, he said.\n\nNo arrests have been made.\n\nShea said it's too early to say what caused the shooting or if was a gambling dispute or a robbery. He said there's \"nothing to indicate\" it's gang-related.\n\nThe site has had no history of complaints over the last couple of years, police said.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/10/12/brooklyn-shooting-multiple-dead-gambling-site/3957256002/", "description": "New York police say four people were killed and three others injured in a shooting at an illegal gambling site in Brooklyn.", "authors": ["Rachel Aretakis", "Published A.M.
