Japan Airlines is committed to providing customers with the highest levels of quality in every aspect of its service and this function was originally implemented based on customer feedback.\n\n'Customers with children have voiced opinions to sit in seats occupied by other traveling children to avoid any inconvenience to those traveling without family members. Therefore, the company took the initiative to create a function in the domestic market in 2013 and for the international market in 2017.'", "description": "Japan Airlines introduced a feature on its booking system that indicates which seats on the plane will be occupied by infants up to the age of two.", "authors": ["Jennifer Newton For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/26/15/18967394-0-image-a-31_1569507678625.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
