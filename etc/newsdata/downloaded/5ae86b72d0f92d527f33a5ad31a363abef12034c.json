Sign up here.\n\nA former Colorado cop spent just 90 days in jail for handcuffing and raping a woman when he was on duty in 2017. Now, almost a year later, the Justice Department slapped him with federal charges.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in Colorado announced Monday that they\u2019re now pursuing new civil rights charges against Curtis Lee Arganbright, who was a senior police officer with the Denver-area suburb of Westminster at the time of the alleged assault. The FBI had already filed a search warrant in June to gather the 42-year-old officer\u2019s uniform and handcuffs as evidence.\n\nIf convicted of the new charges, Arganbright could face up to 10 years in prison. He\u2019s currently on probation.\n\nThe assault allegations only cost Arganbright his job and 90 days in jail after he agreed to plead guilty to misdemeanor charges of unlawful sexual contact and misconduct last October. His short sentence drew local outrage.\n\nOn an early morning in August 2017, Arganbright pulled over his squad car near the suburb of Broomfield so he could handcuff and rape the woman he was supposed to be escorting home. The 36-year-old was only with him because the hospital where she was being treated for intoxication accused her of stealing items from the emergency room, and agreed not to press charges if police made sure she got home safely.\n\nArganbright then dropped the woman off, gave her his business card, and said she \u201cbetter not tell anyone about this,\u201d according to an affidavit obtained by KUSA, an NBC affiliate in Denver.\n\nREAD: Homeless man sentenced to 15 years for possession of powdered milk that we guess tested as cocaine?\n\nShe went back to the same hospital the day after the assault and requested a rape kit examination, saying the police officer raped her, according to KUSA. Arganbright was arrested days later. But the woman later refused to testify in court, according to the Colorado Sun. Her mother told the court how traumatized she was in her stead.\n\n\u201cUnderstand, please, this person has given my family and my daughter a life sentence,\u201d the woman\u2019s mother told District Judge Michael Goodbee during a sentencing hearing last November, according to the Associated Press.\n\nWhen the new civil rights charges were filed Monday, Arganbright waived his right to an indictment at a hearing in federal court, according to the Washington Post. The Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice is also prosecuting the case along with the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office of Colorado.\n\nCover image: (Katja Kircher via Getty Images)", "description": "He pulled over his squad car to rape a woman he was supposed to be escorting home from the hospital.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5daf3dc43075cc000aa6a423/lede/1571765974345-GettyImages-159637077.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.8426xh;0xw,0.0013xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
