Rugby World Cup team of round two 1/15 1, Ellis Genge (England) The loosehead prop may have only come on for England at half-time, but there had not been a run at the World Cup from a prop quite like what Genge produced against the USA. A barn-storming run saw him outpace one defender and trample over another, breaking the best part of 50 metres before it took two men to stop him. He was also excellent in the scrum to win countless penalties as the USA wilted. AP 2/15 2. Julian Montoya (Argentina) It takes something special to shine in Agustin Creevy\u2019s absence, but Montoya delivered with an excellent hat-trick to help lead Argentina to victory over Tonga. Montoya was smart to stay wide following a lineout for his first try, was the beneficiary of the rolling maul for the second and powered his way over from close range for a classy 26-minute hat-trick. AP 3/15 3. Levan Chilachava (Georgia) It\u2019s not often a Georgian makes the team of the round, but Chilachava lead an inspired Georgian pack to dominate Uruguay in their Sunday clash, scoring a try in the bonus-point victory and monstering the opposition front row in the scrum.

Lood de Jager (South Africa) The Springbok needed a big performance to strengthen his case for selection in what is a very competitive area for South Africa, and the giant second row delivered emphatically with a man-of-the-match performance. He may not have got on the scoresheet, but his impact in destroying Namibia\u2019s gameplan was standout nonetheless. AP 6/15 6.

Wainwright did not look out of place up against one of the greats of the game against David Pocock, and it was his ball-carrying ability that really stood out in an eye-catching performance. Getty Images 7/15 7. Lewis Ludlam (England) A remarkable rise to prominence saw Ludlam score his first World Cup try for England in the demolition of the USA, but it was his all-round performance last week that earns him his place in the side. From nowhere, Ludlam is emerging as a very important member of the England team. AFP/Getty Images 8/15 8.

Gareth Davies (Wales) Australia could not keep Davies out of the game in Tokyo, with the scrum-half twice intercepting Will Genia and Bernard Foley and nearly bagging himself a third in the second half.

AP\n\n\u201cCurry is big enough to play six. He\u2019s got the sense to play six. We thought we\u2019d give a go in the World Cup warm-up games. He\u2019s adjusted really well to it.\u201d\n\nJones\u2019s words tell you a lot about the rugby intelligence of a man who remains England\u2019s youngest player, in what is also the youngest back row named in the professional era. At 21 years old, Curry is being asked a great deal to learn a new trade while on the big stage that is a World Cup.\n\nHaving examples to look at helps, and Curry has mentioned his admiration for Pocock in the recent past while out in Japan. But when you have a Rugby World Cup winner guiding you in the form of team manager and mentor Richard Hill, it\u2019s safe to say that Curry is in safe hands.\n\nHill was part of England\u2019s most talented and well-balanced back row, forming a formidable partnership with openside flanker Neil Back and No 8 Lawrence Dallaglio \u2013 and not always in that order. The ability to move Hill to the back of the scrum or to the openside, or Dallaglio to six, stemmed from what Sir Clive Woodward wanted the balance of his pack to be, and Jones appears to be doing the same.\n\n\u201cUltimately, it is working as a three in terms of the back row, making sure everyone is getting on the ball, talking about the breakdown, making sure the six and seven are spreading the workload in carrying,\u201d Curry explained.\n\n\u201cI have had a few conversations with Richard Hill and Mark Wilson. I spoke to him about how he found it and what he thought about it, especially the way Pocock adapted his role. But at the end of the day I don\u2019t think there is anything massively different. I want to stay true to myself and how I want to play and from that adapt to what the team needs after that.\n\n\u201cThe toughest thing is probably the edge defence. Naturally you want to make a tackle and then get up and make another tackle but you need to try to work the big lads inside you and try to keep them all safe, and then try to get yourself into those positions out wide. That is pretty difficult sometimes.\n\n\u201cRugby is a thinking game and this is just a different thought of thinking. But I try to stay true to myself.\u201d\n\nYet there is more to Curry and Underhill than meets the eye. The pair dubbed by Jones as his \u2018Kamizake Kids\u2019 have forged an \u201celectric\u201d bond that spreads way beyond the rugby field. Their youth and exuberance when with England shines through brighter than most, to the point that by Curry\u2019s own admission, the pair are considered \u201cquite weird\u201d.\n\nAnother trait of Curry\u2019s is rather embarrassingly his sleepwalking, which Underhill stitched him up with by revealing it publicly. \u201cHe had one night with George Ford, he had to be moved because he was sleepwalking so much and just being a nuisance. I think he was in front of a TV trying to knock it over.\u201d\n\nBut thankfully there are fewer sleepless nights in Japan for the young Sale Sharks flanker. \"There has been none \u2013 I have had five-star reviews from George Kruis and Billy Vunipola,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cI try to walk out of the room but I didn\u2019t get out of it, I walked into the TV. But the last few weeks have been good. I thought it was more my brother to be honest, I didn\u2019t realise I had it. It happens occasionally, but it\u2019s not really a thing. It\u2019s just horrible timing that it has happened now because everyone thinks I always do it, but it\u2019s pretty rare.\n\n\u201cIt sounds like at 12 o\u2019clock at night we\u2019re all running around the house but that doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nYet that has not stopped Joe Marler \u2013 the man tasked with England\u2019s in-house fines system \u2013 to come up with a unique punishment for the squad. \" One of the fines is taking Sam and I both for lunch. It probably doesn\u2019t reflect too well on the both of us! It\u2019s probably one of the worst fines.\n\n\u201cWe are probably too good company, too electric. Probably people can't handle it. He is a bit calmer. He is very relaxed and chilled, I am a bit less relaxed and chilled. That's the biggest [thing]. Apart from that, we are both pretty weird.\"\n\nIt reflects what they offer to the team on the pitch, an electricity that Jones will hope shocks Argentina if they sleepwalk into the traps set by Curry and Underhill. Against Tonga, they combined for 26 tackles and three turnovers \u2013 enough to suggest that it is a trial worth sticking with but nothing yet to shout about. But if they can reap success against a much more established pack such as Argentina\u2019s, people may just start talking about Curry, Underhill and Vunipola in the same way as great back rows of days gone by.", "description": "England's \u2018Kamikaze Kids\u2019 are causing far more disruption at the Rugby World Cup than simply at breakdown, with Tom Curry and Sam Underhill set to be unleashed once more on Argentina to book their place in the quarter-finals.
