Time will tell.\n\nTime was something robbed from my mum, Maureen.\n\n(Image: Mirrorpix)\n\nShe was a brilliant woman. She brought up eight kids, was strong, sociable, never got ill and never moaned.\n\nShe was diagnosed when she was in her early 70s and never accepted it. I was 39 and my youngest, Ciara, was three at the time.\n\nIt was heartbreaking to see my wonderful mum become someone else.\n\nShe turned \u00adaggressive, which was horrendous because she was the most laid-back woman you\u2019d ever meet.\n\nAll of a sudden she\u2019d be this angry, violent person we didn\u2019t recognise.\n\nWe tried to look after Mum for the first two or three years.\n\nShe had her own \u00adsheltered accommodation but we had to take her out of that.\n\nShe\u2019d started to do things that were dangerous.\n\nShe would put the kettle on the gas ring and me and my brother would go around and the whole flat would be filled with smoke but she\u2019d be sitting there, oblivious.\n\nShe lost all concept of time.\n\nOnce, she walked to my house at 4am and hammered on the door and when I answered, she said: \u201cWhy are you still in bed? You're lazy.\u201d\n\nMy mum, when she was well, was always out and about \u2013 she loved her bingo and was involved in the church.\n\nShe went to church every day and did loads of charity events with them.\n\nShe used to walk for miles too \u2013 she hated being indoors.\n\nThe disease took all that from her. My family watched her sink and felt helpless.\n\nIt got to a point where it was too dangerous for Mum to be left on her own.\n\nWe found her a great home, Chaseley Care Home in Blackpool, and the staff were fantastic.\n\nThey looked after her so well.\n\nWe saw her every day and we\u2019d take her out in a \u00adwheelchair. Then it got to the stage where she was bedridden.\n\nShe was only 5ft but had been a size 20 most of her life. By the end she was only about four-and-a-half stone.\n\nShe just \u00adwithered away.\n\nMy mum was tormented. She didn\u2019t know any of us by the end, there\u2019d be nothing in her eyes, she wouldn\u2019t even speak.\n\nWe celebrated her 80th birthday early. If there is a god, he listened to me, because she passed away peacefully in her sleep.\n\nIt was about 10.30pm. It was extremely upsetting but, I\u2019ve got to be honest, when I got home there was such a sense of relief.\n\nI\u2019m terrified of the disease now. Terrified it will take me and mean I do not recognise my own children.\n\nEvery time I forget where I\u2019ve put my car keys, I have a mild panic attack.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nI desperately hope this drug will be the turning point. The massive breakthrough that will change millions of lives.\n\nAfter years of supporting Alzheimer\u2019s charities and donating to try to find a cure, this has brought hope.\n\nPeople see Alzheimer\u2019s as an old person\u2019s disease but it is not \u2013 it can even affect \u00adchildren. It can come at any time.\n\nIf they have managed to find something that could slow it down, hopefully we are a step closer to getting rid of it once and for all.\n\nNo one should have to go through that awful suffering.", "description": "If they have managed to find something that could slow Alzheimer's down, hopefully we are a step closer to getting rid of it once and for all", "authors": ["Coleen Nolan", "Image", "Mirrorpix", "Itv"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20728818.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_The-Nolan-Sisters-with-their-mother-Maureen-Nolan.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
