Concerns that foreign businesses have raised about China include being forced to transfer technology to their Chinese partners and government subsidies for state-owned enterprises that distort competition.\n\n\"I think we need to make some big changes in the way we do business together. I hesitate to say all the onus of change just fall on China,\" Roach, who's also a former chairman for Morgan Stanley Asia, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Asia\" on Tuesday.\n\nHe added that instead of using threats to force China to change its trade and business practices, the U.S. may find it more effective to negotiate a bilateral investment treaty with the Asian country.\n\n\"Bilateral investment treaty opens up the Chinese market to our multinationals \u2014 which we need to do \u2014 and provide protection for that, and opens up our market to them. If we can negotiate that, that would be a huge breakthrough,\" he said.\n\nAmid the ongoing U.S.-China trade war, multiple news outlets reported last week that the White House was in the early stages of considering some curbs on U.S. investments in China. White House trade advisor Peter Navarro and others in President Donald Trump's administration denied those reports.", "description": "The U.S. also has to re-look the way it's engaging with China to address its complaints, said Stephen Roach, a senior fellow at Yale University.", "authors": ["Yen Nee Lee Saheli Roy Choudhury", "Yen Nee Lee", "Saheli Roy Choudhury"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105912849-1557862472926trumpxi.jpg?v=1569900864", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
