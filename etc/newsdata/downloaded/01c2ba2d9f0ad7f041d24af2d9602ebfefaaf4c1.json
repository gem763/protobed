On our side we can do better, we can improve the car so let\u2019s see.\u201d\n\nVettel has won four times in Singapore, the same as five-times world champion Hamilton with the pair the most successful drivers at the event.\n\nHis last win in the city state came in 2015, his first year with Ferrari.\n\nThe German heads into this weekend\u2019s race off the back of a scrappy display at Monza, Ferrari\u2019s home race, where he spun off and was sanctioned by stewards for rejoining the track dangerously.\n\nThat was the latest in a series of mistakes going back to last year\u2019s German Grand Prix and he is now 13 points behind Leclerc in the standings.\n\nThe German\u2019s current form has fueled speculation, despite his statements to the contrary, that he might not see out his Ferrari contract which runs out at the end of 2020.\n\n\u201cCertainly not the best one right now,\u201d said Vettel when asked if this was the worst point of his career. \u201cBut also it\u2019s not the worst one either.\n\n\u201cI still love racing and I look forward to a lot of races this year to hopefully get in a better position and finish the season in the way we want.\n\n\u201cThen prepare for next year.\u201d", "description": "Sebastian Vettel led Ferrari\u2019s charge in practice for the Singapore Grand Prix on Friday but the German\u2019s Formula One victory drought, already more than a year long, still looked set to continue.", "authors": ["Abhishek Takle", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190920&t=2&i=1432136741&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8J26F-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
