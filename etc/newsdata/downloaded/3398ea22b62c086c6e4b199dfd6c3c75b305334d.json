USA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 There is no strain of joy quite like when a team, a town, gets its first taste of World Series glory in at least a generation.\n\nFrom Kansas City to Cleveland, Houston to Queens, baseball\u2019s circus has in recent years arrived in long-forgotten places with a vigor strong enough to stoke the masses and hold off winter just a few more days.\n\nAnd now it is our nation\u2019s capital\u2019s turn.\n\nThe Washington Nationals have advanced to the first World Series in their franchise history, an odd and curious past that began in Montreal and landed just south of the Capitol in 2005. Their D.C. period was an oft-blue one, marked first by ghastly teams that befitted the District\u2019s sordid baseball history and then by star-crossed clubs that stubbed their toe in winner-take-all games in 2012, 2016 and 2017.\n\nThese Nationals, though, are not staggering into the Fall Classic like an oversize Teddy Roosevelt tripping over the finish line of their iconic Presidents\u2019 Race.\n\nAfter Tuesday night\u2019s 7-4 dispatching of the St. Louis Cardinals in Game 4 of the National League Championship Series, these Nationals come in with credentials that belie their franchise \u2013 and their city\u2019s \u2013 odd baseball past.\n\nRyan Zimmerman and Anthony Rendon celebrate after the Washington Nationals won the pennant. (Photo: Geoff Burke, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nSince their infamous 19-31 start, the Nationals are 81-40 \u2013 climbing from the nether reaches of the National League East to claw their way into a home wild card game.\n\nSince entering the playoffs, they have won eight of 10 games, a fascinating mix of derring-do and dominance - erasing 3-1, eighth-inning deficits in win-or-go-home games against the Brewers and Dodgers, followed by an utter splattering of the Cardinals, who never so much as took the lead in this NLCS.\n\nAnd so Washington will see its first World Series since 1933, when the Senators succumbed in five games to Carl Hubbell\u2019s New York Giants.\n\nThe Houston Astros or New York Yankees will arrive with greater fanfare and pedigrees \u2013 winners of 107 and 103 games, respectively, Houston boasting a World Series title as recently as 2017 and the Yankees with 27 such flags decorating their billion-dollar manse in the Bronx.\n\nThese Nationals? Well, they are an appropriate bunch to introduce this delirious, absurd civic celebration called the World Series to a town gradually regaining its baseball bearings.\n\nFor this club, imperfection is a feature, not a bug, its terrible start and its collection of game-weathered veterans \u2013 viejos, they like to call themselves \u2013 creating a collective feeling of improbable invincibility.\n\nHowie Kendrick? Your National League Championship Series MVP. He's 36 years old, with an iron glove and no true position and never has has never advanced past a league championship series.\n\nYet he may have more to do with the makeup of this club than anyone.\n\nWhen Kendrick tore an Achilles tendon in May 2018, an injury-ravaged club looked at its roster of available outfielders and didn\u2019t find an answer until its Class A roster \u2013 and a 19-year-old slugger named Juan Soto.\n\nSoto became a good player in 2018 and a superstar in 2019, by which time Kendrick had returned from his Achilles tear and promptly tore the cover off the baseball like never before.\n\nHis grand slam in Game 5 of the Division Series is the biggest hit in franchise history. His three doubles in Game 3 of the NLCS put the Cardinals away.\n\n\u201cSome of the best things,\u201d Kendrick said after his three-double performance, \u201ccome from the unexpected moments. I talk with Max (Scherzer) quite a bit, and we're like, \u2018Man, don't you wish you could go back and be how you are now then?\u2019\n\n\u201cAnd he goes, no, I wouldn't change it because all those failures are helping you with the success now.\u201d\n\nRyan Zimmerman could relate.\n\nThe Nationals' original draft pick in 2005 weathered the 100-loss seasons and the many demands on his time as the lone mainstay through years of rebuilding. He entered the month answering questions about these possibly being his last days with the club, his role marginalized by his age (35) and a battle with plantar fasciitis.\n\nNow, he\u2019ll enter this World Series yet another glorious reclamation project, batting .333 with a .913 OPS, a huge Division Series home run and an iconic defensive play to momentarily preserve a no-hitter.\n\n\u201cYou don't often get to play for one team your whole career and not be an individual that understands what goes on, not only in the clubhouse, but in this organization for this city. He means all that to everybody around here,\u201d says his manager, Dave Martinez.\n\nOh, Martinez has been through the wringer. He was an overmatched rookie manager in 2018, trying to replace the beloved Dusty Baker and guide a playoff-ready team to the next level. Instead, his inexperience was exposed.\n\nA year later, \u201cNationals manager\u201d had replaced \u201cRedskins quarterback\u201d as the most reviled man in town, with Martinez presumed to take the fall for the 19-31 start.\n\nInstead, he coined a phrase now emblazoned on towels, shirts, and dugout \u2013 Stay In the Fight \u2013 and made do with a terrible bullpen until reinforcements arrived.\n\nHe missed a week in September to undergo a heart procedure, a sobering reminder of how consuming his job is. Yet all around him were reminders of the game\u2019s joys.\n\nThe Nationals dance after home runs. They group-hug the reticent ace, Stephen Strasburg, after he finishes off yet another dominant outing. And they provide a reminder that in this town where matters so heavy are decided every day, a little levity is OK.\n\n\u201cAt the end, it's just a game,\u201d says their peerless third baseman and NL MVP hopeful, Anthony Rendon. \u201cThere are bigger things going on in this world than the 90 feet bases and the 330-foot fences.\n\n\u201cI mean, if you don't have fun out here in this game or in anything that you do, you probably shouldn't be doing it. So in the end, just have fun.\u201d\n\nCome Sunday, the Nationals will be boarding a plane for Houston or a train to New York, prohibitive underdogs who have seen worse than Gerrit Cole or Aroldis Chapman glowering atop a mound.\n\nOn Oct. 25, the District will host its first World Series game in 86 years. It was a long wait for a team to come back, and a seemingly more torturous wait for one good enough to get back in the Fall Classic.\n\nFinally, D.C. has just that. And there couldn\u2019t be a heartier, more deserving group to deliver that dose of joy only a World Series run can provide.", "description": "The Washington Nationals have advanced to the first World Series in their franchise history, an odd and curious past that began in Montreal and landed just south of the Capitol in 2005.", "authors": ["Gabe Lacques", "Published P.M.
