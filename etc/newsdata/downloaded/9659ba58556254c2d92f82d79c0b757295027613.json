The UK company blamed its \u201cdisappointing\u201d performance on the challenges of expanding both in the US and the EU simultaneously.\n\n\u201cWith the benefit of hindsight, we were not adequately prepared for the additional complexities of planning and trading across our expanded warehouse footprint,\u201d Asos said in a statement, adding that it lost focus on some of its core tasks.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

September data from the British Retail Consortium and KPMG marked the slowest growth in online sales on record, while total sales fell 1.3 per cent from a year earlier.\n\nMore specific data from Kantar showed that online sales of clothing and footwear dipped 0.2 per cent in the 24 weeks to 25 August compared with the same period last year \u2013 the first drop since the consultancy firm started collecting the data a decade ago.\n\n\u201cThe online market isn\u2019t immune to the challenges seen in the overall clothing market,\u201d said Glen Tooke, a consumer specialist at Kantar.\n\n\u201cWe can link the performance of the market to shaky consumer confidence. It\u2019s increasingly difficult for retailers to get consumers to part with their cash.\u201d\n\nDespite the weak results from Asos, its shares soared by a quarter on Wednesday, with investors encouraged by the steps the retailer is taking to address its long-running problems.", "description": "Asos has reported a nearly 70 per cent plunge in annual profit as it has grappled with running a vastly expanded number of warehouses.
