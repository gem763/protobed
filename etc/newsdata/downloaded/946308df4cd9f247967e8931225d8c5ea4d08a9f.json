The figure missed all estimates in a Bloomberg survey that had called for an increase from August\u2019s 49.1.\n\nTreasury yields plummeted, the dollar erased gains and U.S. stocks swung to losses after the report. The group\u2019s production gauge slipped to a 10-year low while the employment measure also dropped to the lowest since January 2016. That\u2019s a worrying sign before a jobs report Friday that\u2019s forecast to show private payroll growth remains subdued.\n\nThe second straight reading below 50 -- the line separating expansion and contraction -- extends the drop from a 14-year high just over a year earlier and raised concern about a recession even after two straight interest-rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. Slowing global growth has damped demand for manufactured goods at home and abroad while trade policy uncertainty has disturbed supply chains and put hiring plans on hold.\n\nRecent manufacturing data \u201cmake you worried that this could spread from the manufacturing sector to the services sector,\u201d said Torsten Slok, chief economist at Deutsche Bank AG. \u201cWhen the employment report comes on Friday we will have an even better idea on whether this is just a manufacturing issue or whether this is something that not only continues to deteriorate but is also spreading.\u201d\n\nThe group said just three of 18 industries reported growth in September, the lowest total since April 2009. Contracting industries were led by apparel, leather and allied products; printing and related support activities; and wood products. The only expansions were in miscellaneous manufacturing; food, beverage and tobacco products; and chemical products.\n\nISM\u2019s measure of new orders, considered a leading indicator of downturns, edged up slightly to 47.3 from an August reading that matched the weakest of this expansion. The production index declined to 47.3, while the inventories gauge fell to 46.9, the lowest since late 2016.\n\nISM\u2019s trade gauges showed American producers are struggling with headwinds from abroad as well as the effects of a resurgent dollar. The measure of export orders, a proxy for overseas demand, fell to 41, the lowest level since March 2009, while the imports index remained in contraction.\n\nThe overall gauge will probably continue to be subdued unless there\u2019s a pickup in new orders, Timothy Fiore, chair of ISM\u2019s manufacturing survey committee, told reporters on a call. \u201cThe single biggest way to do that is to open up the new export orders,\u201d he said. \u201cThere needs to be some relaxation here in trade.\u201d\n\nWhat Bloomberg\u2019s Economists Say\n\n\u201cA sub-50 ISM does not imply overall recession in the U.S. -- a sub-44 ISM would. However, there is little reason to believe that conditions are due to deteriorate to that extent for domestic production.\u201d-- Andrew Husby and Carl RiccadonnaClick here to read the full note.\n\nWhile manufacturing makes up just over a tenth of gross domestic product, slowing in the sector combined with cooler business investment and economic growth puts the longest-ever American expansion in a more precarious position. Greater weakness may threaten President Donald Trump\u2019s re-election prospects in 2020.\n\nShortly after the report, Trump renewed his attacks on the Fed and Chairman Jerome Powell, saying they \u201callowed the Dollar to get so strong,\u201d hurting manufacturers. Fed officials \u201cdon\u2019t have a clue\u201d and are \u201cpathetic,\u201d the president tweeted.\n\nSupplier deliveries was the only sub-index above 50, which for that gauge indicates slower deliveries. A Fed measure of production already signaled U.S. manufacturing is in a recession when it contracted in the first half of this year.\n\nThe pullback in the employment gauge, to 46.3 from 47.4, comes amid economist projections that the main monthly Labor Department report Friday will show limited manufacturing payroll growth. Economists forecast a 3,000 gain in factory employment for a second month.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Explore what\u2019s moving the global economy in the new season of the Stephanomics podcast.
