Was it poor judgment to be in the middle of something that is a swamp in many ways? Yeah,\" he said in an exclusive sit-down with ABC's Amy Robach at his Los Angeles home.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBiden said he did not discuss the Burisma Holdings board seat with his father, except for one \"brief exchange\" that was previously reported.\n\nA photo obtained by Fox News last month showed Joe Biden and Hunter golfing in the Hamptons with Devon Archer, who served on the board of the Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma Holdings with Hunter. Joe Biden had told Fox News that he never discussed his son\u2019s foreign business dealings with him.\n\n\"I don't regret being on the board. What I regret is not taking into account that there would be a Rudy Giuliani and a president of the United States that would be listening to this ridiculous conspiracy idea,\" he said, claiming that the allegations of impropriety have been \"debunked by everyone.\"\n\nFox News' David Montanaro contributed to this report.", "description": "Some Democrats are questioning why Hunter Biden would hold an interview that touched on his overseas business dealings\u00a0ahead of his father's presidential debate, according to Bret Baier.", "authors": ["Charles Creitz"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/baier-biden.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
