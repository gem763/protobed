Kurdish-led forces said they withdrew from the key border town of Ras al Ain during a ceasefire period. Washington signalled it could revoke sanctions if the pause were to become permanent.\n\n\"With the truce scheduled to end on Tuesday night, TRY's traders will be on the edge,\" wrote Rabobank FX strategists Piotr Matys and Jane Foley.\n\nAs the threat of sanctions still loom, it may be prudent for Turkey's central bank to refrain from lowering interest rates further at its meeting on Thursday to offer the lira at least some support should fighting in northern Syria resume, they said.\n\nU.S. sanction against Turkey's offensive into Syria and the threat of more have seen the currency give up around 3% so far this month.\n\nSouth Africa's rand rose 0.2%. President Cyril Ramaphosa said he would soon announce a permanent chief executive for state-run embattled utility Eskom.\n\nEskom's nationwide blackouts last week had pressured the currency and stocks, but the rand had firmed on Friday after the government released a long-delayed plan for electricity generation to address crippling power cuts.\n\nInvestors in central and eastern European markets watched Brexit developments after British lawmakers delayed a crucial vote on a Brexit deal agreed upon by the United Kingdom and European Union last week, forcing PM Boris Johnson to seek an extension beyond the Oct. 31 deadline.\n\nFor GRAPHIC on emerging market FX performance 2019, see http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh For GRAPHIC on MSCI emerging index performance 2019, see https://tmsnrt.rs/2OusNdX\n\nFor TOP NEWS across emerging markets\n\nFor CENTRAL EUROPE market report, see\n\nFor TURKISH market report, see\n\nFor RUSSIAN market report, see (Reporting by Susan Mathew in Bengaluru; Editing by Alison Williams)", "description": "By Susan MathewOct 21 (Reuters) - Signs of progress in U.S.-China trade  talks lifted emerging stocks on Monday and propelled an index of  developing world...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
