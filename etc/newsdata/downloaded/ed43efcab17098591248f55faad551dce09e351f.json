REUTERS/Brian Snyder\n\nMarjorie Klapper received less than the four-month prison term that federal prosecutors in Boston sought after she admitted to paying $15,000 to have a corrupt test proctor secretly correct her son\u2019s answers on the ACT college entrance exam.\n\nU.S. District Judge Indira Talwani also ordered the 50-year-old to pay a $9,500 fine. She previously pleaded guilty in May to conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud.\n\nLawyers for Klapper did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nKlapper is among 52 people charged with participating in a vast scheme in which wealthy parents conspired with a California college admissions consultant to use bribery and other forms of fraud to secure the admission of their children to top schools.\n\nWilliam \u201cRick\u201d Singer, the consultant, pleaded guilty in March to charges that he facilitated cheating on college entrance exams and helped bribe sports coaches at universities to present his clients\u2019 children as fake athletic recruits.\n\nThe 35 parents charged in the investigation include executives and celebrities, such as \u201cDesperate Housewives\u201d star Felicity Huffman and \u201cFull House\u201d actress Lori Loughlin.\n\nHuffman reported to prison on Tuesday after she admitted to engaging in the college exam cheating scheme and was sentenced to a 14-day term. Loughlin has pleaded not guilty.\n\nProsecutors said Klapper in 2017 arranged through Singer to have an associate pose as a proctor for her son\u2019s ACT exam to correct his answers at a test center Singer controlled through bribery.\n\nThe proctor was Mark Riddell, a former counselor at a Florida private school who pleaded guilty in April to secretly taking SAT and ACT college entrance exams in place of Singer\u2019s clients\u2019 children or correcting their answers.\n\nProsecutors said that Klapper\u2019s son used the fraudulent ACT score he received to apply to universities in Arizona, California, Colorado and elsewhere.", "description": "The owner of a California jewelry business was sentenced on Wednesday to three weeks in prison for her role in what prosecutors say is the largest college admissions scam uncovered in the United States.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441610796&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F1WQ", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
