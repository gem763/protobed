In spite of what most pea packaging says, frozen peas cook through in a couple of minutes (sometimes less, depending on how scorching your soup is). Put them in too early, and the peas end up mushy, losing the texture that makes them such a delight in the first place.\n\nAlso, by adding a scoop of frozen peas to soup that is too hot to heat, you cool the soup to a temperature that is still hot, but less likely to cause injury. Everyone wins, including your mouth (which has been burned before, I\u2019m sure). Just cook your soup as you normally would and, once you\u2019re ready to serve it, stir in the peas, let them cook for a minute or two, and serve your soup.", "description": "Frozen peas add a pop of sweetness and colour to all sorts of dishes, but I particularly appreciate them in rich soups and stews.
