This time, having already beaten Ireland three weeks ago, it did not even feel like a real surprise.\n\nThey were faster, sharper, more inventive and, roared on by the vast majority of the delirious red-and-white-clad crowd, absolutely relentless in everything they did as they became the first tier-two team to reach the last eight since Fiji in 2007.\n\nHaving won all four of their matches to top Pool A with 19 points, they will face the Springboks again in the quarterfinals and the twice-champions will be taking absolutely nothing for granted.\n\nThe result also meant that Ireland, Pool A runners-up on 16 points, will play New Zealand.\n\n\"Tonight we went another level,\" said Japan coach Jamie Joseph. \"They wanted it as much as the Scots and gave as much as they could. This is what it takes to win big test matches.\"\n\nJapan's players bow to the crowd after defeating Scotland 28-21.

Fukuoka and Matsushima again put on the afterburners and then a mesmerizing series of off-loads and side-steps ended with Shota Horie presenting supporting prop Inagaki with an unmissable opportunity.\n\nJapan were playing with a speed and intensity that the Scots just could not live with and got a third try at the end of the half when Tim Lafaele slipped through a deft grubber that bounced perfectly into the arms of Fukuoka.\n\nIt was then bedlam two minutes into the second half when Fukuoka stripped Chris Harris and galloped clear for a fourth and bonus-point clinching try.\n\nJapan's Kenki Fukuoka scores his team's fourth try.

The atmosphere was absolutely fantastic and you didn't want to be the team that was losing in that atmosphere.\"\n\n\u00a9 Thomson Reuters 2019.", "description": "Japan produced a scintillating display of attacking rugby then withheld a spirited Scotland fightback to triumph 28-21 on a memorable night in Yokohama and reach the Rugby World Cup quarterfinals for the first time on Sunday.
