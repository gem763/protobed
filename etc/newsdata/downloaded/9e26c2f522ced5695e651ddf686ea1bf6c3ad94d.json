Photo: J.P. McDade/Twitter\n\nOne of the best New York comedy traditions is \u2018Schtick or Treat,\u2019 the annual live show hosted by Mark Normand and Matt Ruby and produced by Luisa D\u00edez. It\u2019s a show where comedians get into the Halloween spirit by performing stand-up sets in disguise as other comedians (never forget Tyler Fischer\u2019s 2017 performance as Bill Burr), or in some cases, Frankensteined versions of other public figures, like when Jeremy Kaplowitz went viral last year with his clip as \u201cDemetri Martin Shkreli.\u201d This year\u2019s show took place at the Knitting Factory in Brooklyn last night, and thankfully clips from the event have been rolling in throughout the day for those of us who weren\u2019t lucky enough to see the show in person.\n\nJ.P. McDade, who performed as Sebastian Maniscalco last year, returned this year with a truly inspired invention: \u201cBernie Mac Sanders.\u201d It\u2019s better seen than explained, but Ruby\u2019s intro detailing the incident that created this bizarre mutant provides a nice setup: \u201cAfter a long day on the campaign trail, Senator Bernie Sanders decided to relax with his favorite film: Def Comedy Jam All-Stars Volume 2 on VHS. When lightning struck the VCR, blah blah blah.\u201d\n\nAs promised: Bernie Mac Sanders\n\n(NSFW language of course) pic.twitter.com/1CGLc0UdLg \u2014 J.P. McDade (@jp_mcdade) October 29, 2019\n\nJeremy Kaplowitz delivered yet another widely shared performance \u2014 this time, \u201c1990s Jerry Seinfeld Doing Bits About His 17-Year-Old Girlfriend.\u201d In case you forgot the legendary stand-up was once in a relationship with a 17-year-old when he was 38, Kaplowitz is here to remind you with plenty of punch lines to back it up: \u201cYou ever notice how girlfriends are always talking about math homework? What is going on with that?\u201d\n\nAnother great performance is this two-part clip featuring Gianmarco Soresi and Chris Cafero, who did a set together as 2019\u2019s most unlikely comedy duo, John Mulaney and Pete Davidson \u2014 and at a few points it\u2019s pretty, to use the Bill Burr term, brutal. \u201cOne might say that Pete is the Chris Farley to my David Spade: I\u2019m vanilla with just a dash of snark,\u201d Soresi, as Mulaney, says. \u201cYeah,\u201d Cafero as Davidson responds, \u201cand I\u2019m gonna die young.\u201d Watch the second clip to hear all about their experience going to see Joker together:\n\nPete Davidson & @mulaney at Schtick or Treat (1/2) pic.twitter.com/4XPHnw0Pwj \u2014 Gianmarco Soresi (@GianmarcoSoresi) October 29, 2019\n\nPete Davidson & @mulaney at Schtick or Treat (2/2) pic.twitter.com/SU8AfphrIP \u2014 Gianmarco Soresi (@GianmarcoSoresi) October 29, 2019\n\nMaybe you\u2019re a Maria Bamford fan, but you\u2019re probably not as big of a fan as Julia Clare is, judging by how perfectly her impersonation nails the stand-up\u2019s nervous energy and ability to seamlessly flip from one character voice to another:\n\nMaria Bamford is one of the GOAT and I wrote a set as her for Schtick or Treat so I could pace nervously and talk about killing myself as much as I have always wanted pic.twitter.com/8zmXlv278S \u2014 Julia Claire (@ohJuliatweets) October 29, 2019\n\nThanks to this very short clip from Pedro Salinas, we now know what Ray Romano thinks of Nanette:\n\nSchtick or Treat was great last night. Unfortunately a disheveled Ray Romano dropped in and ruined the whole show with angry, reactionary material. This is all I could capture before his security crew violently escorted me out pic.twitter.com/pnOFVcWEZZ \u2014 Pedro Salinas (@salinas_pedro) October 29, 2019\n\nAnd with this performance by Anya Volz, Bill Burr can now say he\u2019s performed stand-up while pregnant. \u201cYou know what? It\u2019s not that bad!\u201d Volz\u2019s Burr says. \u201cI don\u2019t know what these broads have been complaining about. It\u2019s like women found the one thing they can do that men can\u2019t and still found a reason to bitch about it.\u201d\n\nAfter Ali Wong and Amy Schumer did it, the world has been on the edge of its seats wondering who will be next. Last night Bill Burr gave the people what they wanted: his very own pregnancy special. Congrats, Bill!!! pic.twitter.com/nATjWFkyc7 \u2014 Anya Volz (@AnyaVolz) October 29, 2019\n\nHead over to producer Luisa D\u00edez\u2019s Twitter feed for more clips from the show.", "description": "The annual \u201cSchtick or Treat\u201d show in New York gave us great impersonations of John Mulaney, Pete Davidson, Maria Bamford, Jerry Seinfeld, and even \u201cBernie Mac Sanders.\u201d", "authors": ["Megh Wright"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/29/29-schtick-or-treat.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
