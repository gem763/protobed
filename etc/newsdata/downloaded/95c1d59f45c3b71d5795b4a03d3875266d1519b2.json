The organisation has begun approaching members of civil society who were affected by the alleged hacks.\n\nJohn Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at Citizen Lab, said WhatsApp\u2019s action was \u201ca major positive step forward for human rights protections online and will absolutely set a precedent\u201d.\n\nHe accused NSO of acting with disregard to the people who were being targeted. \u201cWhile telling the public it is concerned about human rights, the commercial spyware industry has attempted to carve out an unaccountable space for itself, whereby virtue of its proximity to governments, it claims it is acting lawfully, yet prefers to disclaim any responsibility for that behaviour when it suits them.\u201d\n\nWhatsApp\u2019s announcement comes six months after it disclosed it had discovered a vulnerability that allowed cyber-attackers to install surveillance software on to both iPhones and Android phones by ringing targets using the application\u2019s phone function. It was unclear at that time how many of WhatsApp\u2019s 1.5bn users were affected.\n\nSince then, WhatsApp, working alongside Citizens Lab, has been attempting to establish how many attacks were launched in the days before the vulnerability was closed. The company is understood to have been shocked at what it found.\n\nIn its lawsuit, it has accused NSO of \u201cunlawful access and use of WhatsApp computers, several of which are located in California\u201d.\n\nIt also claims NSO \u201ctook a number of steps, using WhatsApp servers and the WhatsApp Service without authorisation, to send discrete malware components (\u2018malicious code\u2019) to target devices\u201d \u2013 and that this was done in a way to \u201cconceal defendants\u2019 identity and involvement\u201d.\n\nThe WhatsApp lawsuit is not the only one directed at NSO. The company has been accused of targeting Omar Abdulaziz, who was a close associate of Jamal Khashoggi before the Washington Post journalist was murdered in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last year.\n\nNSO has said it reviews allegations of abuse by clients and that it reserves the right to strip customers of their licences.\n\nThe company was acquired earlier this year by a London-based private equity firm called Novalpina Capital, which in June said it would unveil new governance standards at the company.\n\nNSO has in the past vigorously defended the use of its technology and surveillance software, which is known as Pegasus, as a law enforcement tool that could help prevent crime and terror attacks. Novalpina has credited NSO technology for disrupting plans for a terrorist attack at a crowded stadium in Europe and, citing the Mexican government, said it assisted in the 2011 arrest of the drug kingpin known as El Chapo.\n\nThe Israeli company released details of that new \u201chuman rights policy\u201d in November, which it said was founded on \u201cunequivocal respect for human rights\u201d. Among other initiatives, it vowed to integrate new due diligence procedures to identify, prevent, and mitigate \u201cadverse human rights impacts\u201d due to the possible abuse of its technology.\n\nIt also said it would conduct an evaluation of the \u201cpotential for adverse human rights impacts\u201d arising through the misuse of NSO products, as well as enforcing \u201ccontractual obligations\u201d that would prevent NSO\u2019s customers from using its products for anything other than the investigation of serious crime.\n\nBut the new policy was criticised by some human rights and cyber-surveillance experts, including the UN\u2019s Kaye.\n\nIn an 18 October letter to Shalev Hulio, one of NSO\u2019s founders, Kaye raised questions about the efficacy of the new human rights guidelines and due diligence procedures, and suggested NSO seemed entirely reliant on its own customers to self-report abuse of its products.\n\nNSO Group said: \u201cIn the strongest possible terms, we dispute today\u2019s allegations and will vigorously fight them. The sole purpose of NSO is to provide technology to licensed government intelligence and law enforcement agencies to help them fight terrorism and serious crime. Our technology is not designed or licensed for use against human rights activists and journalists. It has helped to save thousands of lives over recent years.\n\n\u201cThe truth is that strongly encrypted platforms are often used by paedophile rings, drug kingpins and terrorists to shield their criminal activity. Without sophisticated technologies, the law enforcement agencies meant to keep us all safe face insurmountable hurdles. NSO\u2019s technologies provide proportionate, lawful solutions to this issue.\n\n\u201cWe consider any other use of our products than to prevent serious crime and terrorism a misuse, which is contractually prohibited. We take action if we detect any misuse. This technology is rooted in the protection of human rights \u2013 including the right to life, security and bodily integrity \u2013 and that\u2019s why we have sought alignment with the UN guiding principles on business and human rights, to make sure our products are respecting all fundamental human rights.\u201d\n\n\u2022 If you have been affected by or have information on the alleged WhatsApp hack please contact Nick.Hopkins@theguardian.com or Stephanie.Kirchgaessner@theguardian.com\n\n.\n\n\n\n", "description": "NSO Group\u2019s spyware allegedly used in cyber-attacks on lawyers and journalists", "authors": ["Nick Hopkins", "Stephanie Kirchgaessner"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3ffbbafe1ef87bfa3f066e137a932587fa1f2d8/0_11_4074_2444/master/4074.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=fcf32e2db3c56e37294452b5caf106e6", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
