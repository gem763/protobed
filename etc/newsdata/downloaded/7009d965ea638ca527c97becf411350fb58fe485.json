He then exited the game early but returned in the Saints' 13-6 victory.\n\nKamara played 39 of the team's 66 offensive snaps -- his lowest snap count of the season -- and carried 11 times for 31 yards. For the season, he has rushed 86 times for 373 yards (4.3 avg.) with one rushing touchdown. He has also caught 33 passes for 276 yards and a receiving touchdown.\n\nFollowing the game, New Orleans coach Sean Payton said Kamara was dealing with two injuries.\n\n\"Obviously, he had the swollen ankle coming into the game, but he was ready to go,\" Payton said. \"He tweaked his knee.\"\n\nAlthough Payton didn't appear overly concerned about Kamara's status, ESPN reported Tuesday that the Saints worked out running back Travaris Cadet on Monday. Cadet has had two stints with New Orleans since entering the NFL in 2012.\n\nThe Saints (5-1) will face the Bears (3-2) at Soldier Field on Sunday afternoon.\n\n--Field Level Media", "description": "New Orleans Saints running back Alvin Kamara will be limited in practice this  week due to a high-ankle sprain but still hopes to play Sunday at Chicago, NFL...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
