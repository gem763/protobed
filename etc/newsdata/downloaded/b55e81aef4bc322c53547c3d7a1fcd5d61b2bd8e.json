It's sad to think someone, who I have accepted to follow me is betraying for either money or to keep a relationship with the press.\"\n\nWitty Dave had an idea and responded to Coleen.\n\nHe suggested: \"Make a false story, tell people different things, see which 1 comes out = find the culprit.\"\n\n(Image: Twitter/@dbuzz89)\n\nFeisty mother-of-five Rebekah, 37, is currently in the middle of a very public spat with fellow WAG Coleen Rooney.\n\nColeen, 33, took to social media on Wednesday to reveal she had suspected someone had been betraying her for years and had proof that her 'former' friend Rebekah was the culprit.\n\nManchester lad Dave then shared his idea with the WAG - and now his scheme has come to light, he has changed his Twitter profile to: \"Detective who recently solved the coleen rooney vs rebekah vardy case 9sic)\".\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nColeen revealed she found the guilty person by using a process of elimination and blocking her other followers on her private Instagram account.\n\nIt now appears that Coleen adopted a similar process to Dave's idea as she revealed how she uncovered Rebeka as the guilty account.\n\n(Image: Twitter/@dbuzz89)\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nColeen went on an extraordinary Twitter rant where she accused the wife of Jamie Vardy or others who have access to her social media, of betraying her trust by leaking information from her private Instagram account.\n\nColeen, 33, told her followers she became suspicious when stories were getting published about her that only her select followers could know about.\n\nIt was then that she came up with a plan to catch whoever it was by planting false stories about her basement flooding, returning to TV and gender selection to see if they got reported.\n\nColeen admitted she blocked all of the accounts that followed her - except the one belonging to Rebekah Vardy - and found that the false stories made it to the press\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nColeen wrote: \"For a few years now someone who I trusted to follow me on my personal Instagram account has been consistently informing the sun newspaper of my private posts and stories.\n\n\n\n\"There has been so much information given to them about me, my friends and family - all without my permission or knowledge.\n\n\"After a long time of trying to figure out who it could be, for various reasons, I had a suspicion.\"\n\nShe explained: \"To try and prove this, I came up with an idea. I blocked everyone from viewing my Instagram stories except one account (those on my private account must have been wondering why I haven\u2019t had stories on there for a while.)\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\"Over the past five months I have posted a series of false stories to see if they made their way into the Sun newspaper. And you know what, they did!\n\n\"The story about gender selection in Mexico, the story about returning to TV and then the later story about the basement flooding in my new house.\n\n\n\n\"It\u2019s been tough keeping it to myself and not making any comment at all, especially when the stories have been leaked, however I had to.\n\n(Image: Ken McKay/ITV/REX/Shutterstock)\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Now I know for certain which account / individual it\u2019s come from. I have saved and screens hotted all the original stories which clearly show just one person has viewed them.\n\n\"It\u2019s.........
