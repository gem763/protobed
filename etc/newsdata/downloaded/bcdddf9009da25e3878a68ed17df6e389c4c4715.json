A Kurdish reporter, whom Trump addressed as \u201cMr. Kurd,\u201d had asked the president what the U.S. relationship with Kurds would be following the defeat of ISIS.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to get along very well. We do get along great with the Kurds. We\u2019re trying to help them a lot. Don\u2019t forget, that\u2019s their territory. We have to help them,\u201d Trump answered. \u201cI want to help them.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t forget. I don\u2019t forget,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are great people.\u201d\n\nDuring Wednesday\u2019s press opportunity, the president said that the Kurds were \u201cno angels\u201d and that their fight over land had \u201cnothing to do with us.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s decision to withdraw U.S. troops and leave the Syrian Kurds to fight a Turkish military offensive alone was met with bipartisan backlash. Trump imposed sanctions Monday against Turkey in an attempt to dissuade them from the assault. However, they were removed Thursday after Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan agreed to a 120-hour pause in fighting while Kurdish forces withdraw and surrender their territory.", "description": "\"The Daily Show\" dug up the president's comments last year that he would \"never forget\" the Kurds' sacrifice in the battle against ISIS.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da8fcf32000000912506073.png?cache=326qqqpe2q&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
