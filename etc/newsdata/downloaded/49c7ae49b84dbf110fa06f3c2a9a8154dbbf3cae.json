Terrifying.\n\nBut, while a certain level of worry is normal, excessive anxiety can be problematic and can lead to serious stress-related symptoms.\n\nA new study by Probio7 has found that 44% of new parents worry about their baby\u2019s health daily, with almost 20% having concerns on an hourly basis.\n\nThe poll of more than 1,000 UK parents also found that more than half seek medical advice, including a visit to the GP, every month.\n\n69% use the internet to search their baby\u2019s health signs and symptoms regularly \u2013 either on an hourly, daily or weekly basis.\n\nThe worries that parents had were wide-ranging, but there were a few things that came up again and again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe parents surveyed worried the most about when, why and how much their baby cries.\n\nOf those concerned over tears, 36% were anxious every hour.\n\nParent\u2019s second favourite worry is over the regularity, consistency and colour of their little one\u2019s poo. And coming in third, was anxiousness over how much or how little baby slept.\n\nFeeling anxious to this level on an hourly basis isn\u2019t healthy or helpful, and worryingly, the survey also found that many parents were turning to booze for comfort.\n\n18% of women and 23% of men say that they find relief from worry about their baby in a glass of wine. This number skyrockets for divorced couples, with 50% of single, divorced parents using wine for comfort.\n\nParents often sought relief through internet searches for advice, and 50% booked regular visits to their GP for reassurance.\n\nFor 29% of mums, they felt that their baby crying frequently had damaged their relationship. And that figure was even higher for male responses \u2013 38% \u2013 suggesting that men may find infant crying more detrimental than women.\n\n17% of parents surveyed claimed to have suffered from depression when their baby was first born. It could be that age and experience offer some advantage because the levels of depression were highest among the youngest respondents (aged 18-24).\n\n\u2018This survey suggests parents are worrying most about colic, toileting and sleep,\u2019 says Berta Corbera, Probio7 nutritionist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Optimal gut health for babies is not only beneficial directly for the gut in terms of reducing colic, reflux, loose stools or constipation; it is also vital for immune health. A probiotic can help the baby\u2019s mood, sleep, energy and general wellbeing.\u2019\n\nMORE: Are gyms doing enough to protect members with eating disorders and exercise addiction?\n\nMORE: Greggs is giving out free bakes to loyal fans\n\nMORE: Don\u2019t use toothpaste to try to tighten your vagina\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "A new study has found that parents, consumed with worry over their new baby's health, are turning to alcohol for comfort.", "authors": ["Natalie Morris"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/sex-after-a-child_1570790333.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
