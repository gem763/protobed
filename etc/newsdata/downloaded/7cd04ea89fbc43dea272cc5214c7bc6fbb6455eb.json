To be both fair and to incentivise employees, companies often used a metric based approach where they promote their best performers at each level up the organisational hierarchy.\n\nBut a new study published on SSRN titled \u201cPromotions and the Peter Principle\u201d says that \u2013 in sales organisations at least \u2013 promoting the top performers exclusively could result in \u201cfirms promoting workers who decrease subordinate performance by 30%.\u201d\n\nThis is because \u201cthe best worker is not always the best candidate for manager,\u201d according to authors Alan Benson, Danielle Li, and Kelly Shue. And in the research the authors set out to prove this statement empirically.\n\nAnyone who has worked in business or government for an extended period will be familiar with the Peter Principle, which was articulated by Peter and Hull in 1969. The principal states that, \u201cin a hierarchy, every employee tends to rise to his level of incompetence\u201d.\n\nFor example, many of us have worked with really good operators who get promoted and have fallen flat as they were unable to transfer the skill of generating sales and revenue to managing people.\n\nBut if it\u2019s not the best performers getting promoted then who exactly should business leaders promote?\n\nThat\u2019s the point of the research with Benson, Li, and Shue noting:\n\n\u201cWhen management requires skills that are different from those required for lower-level work, the best workers may not make the best managers. In these cases, do firms promote someone who excels in her current position or someone who is likely to excel as a manager?\n\n\u201cIf firms promote workers based on their current performance, they may end up with worse managers. Yet if firms promote workers based on traits that predict managerial performance, they may pass over higher-performing workers, thereby weakening incentives for workers to perform well in their current roles\u201d.\n\nIn order to try to find an empirical answer to the question of who should be promoted, the authors modified the Peter Principle from Peter and Hull\u2019s original \u201cincompetence\u201d hypothesis to one which defined the Peter Principle as a promotion policy which:\n\nPlaces positive weight on worker sales performance; and\n\nPlaces more weight on sales performance than a policy aimed solely at maximising managerial quality\n\nDuring their empirical tests the findings concluded that \u201ctop ranked sales workers are actually worse managers at the margin\u201d and that as a result \u201cfirms can improve expected managerial quality by placing less weight on sales\u201d.\n\nSource: @chicagoboothrev on Twitter\n\nNaturally, there is a continuum along which employees will sit in terms of sales success and managerial success that follows. But the authors do suggest there is a marker for solid management credentials and potential in a worker\u2019s statistics for sales collaboration.\n\nWhile Benson and his colleagues say the results in this regard are \u201csuggestive rather than conclusive\u201d they highlight that \u201cworkers\u2019 collaboration experience \u2014 as measured by the number of people they share sales credits with \u2014 is an observable characteristic that firms could weight more positively in promotion decisions if their only goal were to improve managerial match quality\u201d.\n\nTeam players, not lone wolves, the authors say.\n\nThis means business leaders are still faced with the trade-off between promoting employees who they know may be worse managers than some of their underperforming peers who have a better skill set for management positions.\n\nThere isn\u2019t an easy answer and each company is likely to handle this conundrum differently.\n\nThe authors suggest the evidence shows companies are making a trade-off between motivating the current workforce \u2013 work hard, get promoted \u2013 and parachuting employees who are more suited to management, yet are lower performers, in over the top of the high achievers.\n\nIn the end, business leaders need to balance the sometimes competing goals of using performance as the sole method of promotion and the reality that this could lead to the promotion of a person who actually diminishes the performance of the team once in a manager role.\n\nOr perhaps, as the study shows, business leaders might take the cultural high road and make collaboration one of the key criteria and in doing so build better teams, maintain strong sales, and promote better managers.\n\nIn the end that\u2019s likely to get better outcomes for the business and its employees.\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
