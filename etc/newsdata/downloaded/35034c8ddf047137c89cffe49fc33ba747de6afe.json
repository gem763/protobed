Certain stages of your program you feel that\u2019s what you want to do and to me, we\u2019ve been there and we\u2019ve done that. Now we\u2019ve got to finish.\u201d\n\nOf course, it won\u2019t be easy. Indiana (2-0) has lost 23 consecutive games in this series dating to a tie in 1990.\n\nTwo years ago in Allen\u2019s head coaching debut, the Hoosiers were trailing 20-17 late in the third quarter before losing 49-21. Last year in Columbus, they were down 35-26 after three before falling 49-26.\n\nWhat will it take for the Indiana to finish strong?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s obviously executing on the field in those situation, which they have done that and we have not,\u201d Allen said. \u201cAlso, it\u2019s that the depth you have in your program to be able to keep playing guys and keep them fresh and being able to play at that high of a level in the fourth quarter.\u201d\n\nIndiana believes it finally has the depth to stay with Ohio State (2-0), which is as strong as ever.\n\nNew starting quarterback Justin Fields has been putting together a Heisman Trophy-worthy highlight reel and running back J.K. Dobbins ran for 181 yards in his college debut the last time he visited Bloomington. The offense averages 43.5 points and the defense has yielded only three points in the first half of its first two games.\n\nAnd if the Buckeyes learned anything from their last regular-season trip to the state of Indiana - a blowout loss at Purdue last season - it\u2019s that they can\u2019t take anything for granted even in this series.\n\n\u201cThe mentality we have is if you\u2019re the champ, you\u2019re the boxer, they\u2019re going to try to knock you out every time,\u201d Buckeyes coach Ryan Day said. \u201cWe have to bring it every single week.\u201d\n\nROLLING FIELDS\n\nFields has thrown for six touchdowns and run for three more in his first two games with the Buckeyes. He\u2019s second in Ohio State history to Dwayne Haskins Jr. for most touchdown passes in his first two starts. Haskins threw nine TD passes in the first two games last year. And the three TD runs are a school record for a quarterback in his first two starts. But the Georgia transfer doesn\u2019t care about the numbers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just really focused on wins, so as long as we win,\u201d Fields said.\n\nPROMISING PENIX\n\nIndiana\u2019s Michael Penix Jr. has shown what he\u2019s capable of in his first two career starts. After throwing for 326 yards, one TD and two interceptions and running for 67 yards in the season opener, Penix cleaned things up last week and was an efficient 14 of 20 with 197 yards and two TDs before taking a seat late in the first half. The redshirt freshman knows he will have to be every bit as good Saturday.\n\nYOUNG & THE LINE\n\nIndiana is one of six teams in the Football Bowl Subdivision that has not yet allowed a sack. Buckeyes defensive end Chase Young could change things in a hurry. The junior already has three sacks this season, 17 in his career and is trying to join Mike Vrabel as the second player in school history to record multiple seasons with 10 or more sacks.\n\nNOT SATISFIED\n\nBoth teams are coming off lopsided shutouts. Indiana routed Eastern Illinois 52-0 last week while Ohio State ran away from Cincinnati 42-0. Both coaches also believe they\u2019ll need to play even better this week.\n\n\u201cThe immature player, the immature coach looks at it and says everything is good, we won. We won pretty handily,\u201d Day said. \u201cThe fact of the matter is that the issues are on film. As the level of play increases through conference play, as the season goes on, those issues aren\u2019t going to go away.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Indiana Hoosiers feel like they are watching movie sequels each time they see tape of their most recent games against Ohio State: Competitive for three quarters before wearing down in the fourth.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Michael Marot"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/07/cincinnati_ohio_st_football_49713_c0-155-3694-2308_s1770x1032.jpg?4168cf7fb30d2bae6320c54486f8aebff976ca41", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
