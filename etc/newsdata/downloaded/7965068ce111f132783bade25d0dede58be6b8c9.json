(AP) - The knock on Darren Waller for most of his brief NFL career has been that his team couldn\u2019t count on him.\n\nAn injury cut short his first season and two suspensions limited his availability the next two seasons. Given a second chance by the Oakland Raiders, Waller is making sure not to squander the opportunity.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes my way, make something happen,\u201d Waller said Wednesday. \u201cJust be consistent. Don\u2019t be erratic. Most of my career to this point has been erratic. It\u2019s been like, \u2018OK, can we rely on him.\u2019 I\u2019ve done it for three weeks but can I do it again another week.\u201d\n\nWaller has made a lot happen so far, catching seven passes in the opener followed by six the following week and then grabbing 13 for 134 yards in a loss at Minnesota last Sunday - finishing one shy of matching the team record for catches in a game held by Hall of Famer Tim Brown and Brandon Myers.\n\nHis 26 catches surpass the 18 he had in 22 career games coming into the season and are one shy of Antonio Gates\u2019 2007 mark for the most ever by a tight end in the first three weeks of a season.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to ever get ahead of it, but we think he\u2019s very special,\u201d quarterback Derek Carr said. \u201cObviously the production is now showing up. What he doesn\u2019t get enough credit for is he\u2019ll one play get a reverse speed play, then the next play he\u2019s blocking (Minnesota defensive end Danielle) Hunter in pass protection, then the next he\u2019s running a slant on Trae Waynes. You don\u2019t find those guys. They\u2019re not around. The fact that we have one of those is pretty awesome.\u201d\n\nWaller has seemingly come out of nowhere to become Oakland\u2019s most dangerous offensive player the first three weeks. He caught just 51 passes in three college seasons as a wide receiver in Georgia Tech\u2019s option offense. He was then drafted in the sixth round by Baltimore in 2015 but had little impact with the Ravens as he dealt with substance abuse problems that he detailed on HBO\u2019s \u201cHard Knocks\u201d this summer.\n\nWaller said he was \u201cgetting high like literally every day\u201d during training camp in 2016 when he described himself as a \u201cvegetable.\u201d He said he used opiates, Xanax and cocaine.\n\nWaller was suspended the first four games that season for violating the NFL\u2019s substance abuse policy. He violated it again the following year and was suspended for the entire 2017 season, leading him to finally attend rehab sessions. He said this summer that he has celebrated his two-year anniversary of being clean.\n\nWaller was reinstated in August 2018 and spent most of the season on the Ravens practice squad before being signed by the Raiders on Nov. 27. He had six catches for 75 yards over the final four games in 2018 but showed the Raiders enough for them to let Jared Cook leave in free agency and make Waller their No. 1 receiving tight end.\n\n\u201cThey told me that I was going to get the opportunity,\u201d Waller said. \u201cAs soon as you hear that, after all of the things that I\u2019ve been through, I was like, I get one opportunity, that\u2019s all I need.\u201d\n\nWaller has improved as a blocker this season but is at his most dangerous when he is detached as a receiver in the slot or out wide and can use his athleticism to exploit bigger defenders and size to take advantage of smaller ones. He has made 15 of his 26 catches when detached from the line at the start of the play.\n\nThat ability has allowed the Raiders to utilize two tight end formations more often this season to great effect. Oakland has more than doubled its use of one-back, two tight end groupings so far this season, gaining more than 1 yard more per play than in all other alignments.\n\n\u201cOur tight ends can block, so if we get a nickel defense, we feel like we can run the football,\u201d coach Jon Gruden said. \u201cAnd if they come out in the base defense, we think our guys are versatile enough to be functional and do a lot of things in the passing game. So, that\u2019s a really good personnel grouping for us, one we are going to continue to probe and utilize.\u201d\n\nNOTES: The Raiders promoted LB Justin Phillips from the practice squad and released WR Ryan Grant, who started the first two games. \u2026 Oakland also signed LB Dakota Allen off the Rams practice squad and placed LB Marquel Lee on IR. \u2026 The Raiders signed LB Quentin Poling to the practice squad.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The knock on Darren Waller for most of his brief NFL career has been that his team couldn't count on him.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Josh Dubow"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/12/chiefs_raiders_football_95159_c0-125-3000-1874_s1770x1032.jpg?f52fad753beb582a85b1710fc9f6c2ec1ddbd99f", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
