We will want many more young visionaries like the Young Rich Listers if we are to keep up.\n\nSo there are Melanie Perkins and Cliff Obrecht of Canva, who decided that something more intuitive than standard graphic design software was needed and now have 15 million users. Australia\u2019s new open banking rules will need digital products that can turn them into a new competitive consumer banking marketplace.\n\nThat is what Fred Schebesta wants to do by shifting his Finder.com from comparing financial products, to doing the switching for the customer. There is Cyan Ta\u2019eed, who with husband Collis, has reached fourth on the list with a digital marketplace for digital assets themselves. Or there is New York-based Israeli-Australian Ori Allon, one of 27 expat Young Rich Listers, whose online property platform Compass aims to make buying and selling a house simpler and more transparent.\n\nThey are, of course, dwarfed by Atlassian, which has capped the advance of the young new tech boom by putting its software founders, Scott Farquhar and Mike Cannon-Brookes, into the Rich 200 top 10 among the Lowy, Rinehart and Triguboff names.\n\nAtlassian is already worth more than Telstra or Wesfarmers. And as Rich List editor Michael Bailey explains, in terms of enterprise value the likes of Compass and Afterpay now bear down on listed stalwarts such as Qantas or REA Group. The Young Rich are making a bigger impact on corporate Australia than ever.\n\nBut nobody on this list belongs to some leisured class. Their money is tied up in the companies they are trying to build. History says that they will live or die by creative destruction \u2013 the churn even among the Rich 200 establishment is very high. The cheap money created by central banks has pumped company valuations, but a sceptical marketplace will also find them out. The humiliation of WeWork and its cancelled New York IPO is one of many which have failed to find public investors to back weak business models.\n\nThe median wealth of the Young Rich is now $68 million, double 2018\u2019s. Earlier this year, Labor made an attack on wealth and supposed unfairness the centrepiece of its election campaign, thinking it would be an easy route to the Lodge. But voters sensed the silliness of it: yes, Australia would be more equal if the people on the Young Rich List got up and left, but it would not be more prosperous. And Labor\u2019s dystopia did not fit their lived experience.\n\nThe opportunities thrown up by this era of digital disruption will make fortunes for those who have the wit, the enterprise, the determination or the luck to make the most of them. Sure that might mean that they bloat the fortunes of the \u201ctop 1 per cent\u201d. But repeated studies have shown that there has been no significant overall widening of income inequality in Australia over the past two or three decades. The same is basically true for wealth, as well as income. the just released 2019 Credit Suisse global wealth report shows that 66 per cent of Australians have wealth above $US100,000 ($146,000), which is among the world\u2019s highest. Encouraging entrepreneurs and wealth creators remains essential to maintaining this privilege.", "description": "Australia's Young Rich look closer in profile to the global giants of disruption who are rewiring the world economy", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.4608%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_971%2C$y_591/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/8ad0584b740f5697dcf22ce14efd78d61efa7ac7", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
