Josephine read the article, and started crying.\n\nAt around midnight on 17 May 1959, Kelso Cochrane, a 32-year old man from Antigua who\u2019d settled in London five years earlier, was a five-minute stroll away from his bedsit in the rundown northern edge of Notting Hill, in North Kensington. He was returning from Paddington General Hospital, where he\u2019d been treated for a thumb he\u2019d broken at work as a carpenter earlier that week.\n\nAs he approached the corner of Southam Street and Golborne Road, six white youths closed in. Witnesses described pushing and shoving, as Kelso tried to defend himself. Then the youths ran off. In the melee, one of them had driven a knife into the main chamber of his heart, a blow delivered with unusual force, the coroner said later.\n\nNo one was convicted for the crime, despite the killer\u2019s identity being \u201cthe worst kept secret in Notting Hill\u201d. But like the death of Stephen Lawrence 34 years later, the murder had a lasting impact.\n\nIt came eight months after the Notting Hill race riots, some of the most serious racial violence in Britain of the last century. It also came against the backdrop of intense far-right activity in the area. The previous month, Sir Oswald Mosley, Britain\u2019s wartime fascist leader, had declared that he would stand for parliament in North Kensington in the 1959 general election. At the packed, public meeting marking the announcement, The Times noted that: \u201cMost of the questions addressed to Sir Oswald Mosley concerned aspects of the colour question, and to these he answered emphatically: \u2018We are determined they shall go home.\u2019\u2019\u2019\n\nNews of the murder and the unease on the streets of Notting Hill spread alarm in the corridors of power, according to declassified documents. The prime minister, Harold Macmillan, convened a special meeting of ministers; Rab Butler, the home secretary, called for witnesses and was considering, a report said, \u201crecruiting coloured police as part of his campaign to end racial tension\u201d. The police \u2013 to the incredulity of many \u2013 swiftly denied any racial motive to the killing.\n\nCampaigners, meanwhile, rallied to demand justice for Kelso Cochrane and to call for laws banning racial discrimination. Prominent among them was Claudia Jones, the Trinidadian-born communist who\u2019d been deported from America during the McCarthy witch-hunts, and who a few months before, had started the forerunner to the Notting Hill Carnival.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Six years later, in 1965 the UK\u2019s first Race Relations Act was finally passed.\n\nGrowing up in Harlem, Josephine knew none of this. Following her shock discovery at work in her office in Brooklyn though, we made contact (I\u2019d investigated the case for a 2006 BBC documentary), and I put her in touch with some of her Antiguan relatives.\n\nFinally, last month \u2013 on the 60th anniversary of her father\u2019s death and the day before what might have been his 93rd birthday \u2013 Josephine left the United States for the first time, and flew to London to retrace her father\u2019s footsteps.\n\nThe 66-year-old grandmother who I meet in the arrivals area at Heathrow is tall, as her father was, and ebullient, just as Kelso\u2019s friends have described him. She is also, as I discover over the next three days, an eloquent narrator of her own tumultuous story.\n\nJosephine was born in 1953, two years year after Kelso married her mother Kansas, who\u2019s still alive, who he\u2019d met after moving to the US. However, in February 1954, he was deported to Antigua for overstaying his American visa. Borrowing money for a ticket from his brother Stanley, he made his way to England, where he worked as a carpenter while nurturing hopes of becoming a lawyer. But he wanted to return to the US. In September 1956, he applied for citizenship with his wife\u2019s support.\n\nThe following May his request was accepted. But according to documents in the National Archives, Kansas withdrew her backing after meeting another man. Kelso also began a relationship, with a Jamaican trainee nurse called Olivia Ellington. (The writer Zadie Smith\u2019s new book of short stories contains a fictionalised account of Kelso and Olivia\u2019s last days together.)\n\nOn 30 May 1959, two weeks after Kelso was murdered, a Daily Chronicle journalist wrote that he\u2019d located Kansas in a New York boarding house, and broke the news of her husband\u2019s death. \u201cClutching her six-year-old daughter\u2019s [Josephine\u2019s] hand, Mrs Cochrane said: \u2018It is such a shock. I read in the papers that someone had died in the Notting Hill troubles. I never thought that it would be Kelso.\u2019\u201d\n\nOver a coffee on a wet, blustery day on the Portobello Road, where her dad had spent some of his final afternoon shopping in the market, Josephine dismisses the report. She has no memories of the incident and says such a quote would never have passed her mother\u2019s lips. She also has no memories of her dad. But she remembers the dolls and the tea set he sent her from England, and the picture of him in uniform, which was on the piano when she was growing up.\n\n\u201cI wanted a father. Everybody else had one. So I wanted to know why mine wasn\u2019t there,\u201d she says. \u201cI used to ask my mother: \u2018Did he ever know us?\u2019 She said: \u2018Of course. He used to come home in the evening and put you in his lap and rock you to sleep.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut when Josephine asked her how he\u2019d died, perhaps to protect her, Kansas clammed up. \u201cMy mother didn\u2019t really want to talk about it. She would just say that he was killed in a war, or on some kind of military service.\u201d\n\nWhen she turned 19, Josephine set out to discover the truth. She approached a veterans\u2019 organisation for details, but to no avail. \u201cThey told me there was no war at that time. I said there had to be, because my father died in one.\u201d\n\nAfter a while, Josephine says, she lost hope, and headed down \u201cthe road of self-destruction\u201d. For around 15 years she led a life of crime and drugs: \u201cIn and out of prison. In and out of college. Never finishing nothing. Never doing what I\u2019m supposed to do\u2026 I became addicted to cocaine and stole for my living. And I got caught quite a few times. Then one day I got tired.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019d grown up in the Nation of Islam, but in prison adopted the Sunni faith. \u201cThe Nation of Islam was about Malcolm X and Farrakhan and it was more militant, but it taught me my African history. I needed to be more submissive to the Creator. And that\u2019s where jail came in. It took a long time for me to really let go of the negative way I was living, but after two or three times in jail, it finally happened. My mother gave me such a strong foundation of education that I didn\u2019t stay down in the gutter.\u201d\n\nShe went back to college and threw herself into her studies. \u201cSometimes I didn\u2019t have the money for school, so I had to go back to work. Thank God for my mother, because she took my children and made sure they were all right, and my sisters were there to help too.\u201d\n\nIt was on a jail programme that she realised how badly she wanted her father, and the sense of abandonment that had seeped in and affected her own relationships. Drugs had helped mask her feelings about her dad, she says. As she emerged from those lost years, the feelings resurfaced. Her trip to London is a way of helping to resolve them.\n\nWe walk up Ladbroke Grove to the small brick church where Kelso\u2019s funeral was held 60 years ago. Afterwards, 1,000 people had silently followed his cort\u00e8ge up to Kensal Green cemetery. Three hundred metres away we stop on Bevington Road, where Kelso was living in a bedsit in a freshly painted Victorian terrace that\u2019s since been torn down \u2013 before we head the short distance up Golborne Road, and the scene of the murder. As we cross the iron bridge that Kelso stumbled towards after being ambushed, Josephine appears to visibly tense. \u201cOh my gosh,\u201d she says.\n\nShe crosses the road and studies the blue plaque that was unveiled 10 years ago, on the 50th anniversary of his death. It reads: \u201cKelso Cochrane. Antiguan carpenter was fatally stabbed on this site. His death outraged and unified the community leading to the lasting cosmopolitan tradition in North Kensington.\u201d\n\nThat evening, Josephine is in the little library a few metres away for the launch of the Kelso Cochrane Memorial Archive. It\u2019s been initiated by Isis Amlak, one of the local activists who\u2019ve kept her father\u2019s memory alive through the years. For Amlak and others, the way the community came together to demand change in the wake of Kelso\u2019s murder is part of North Kensington\u2019s history of resistance: a history that continues today in the struggle for justice for the victims of the Grenfell fire.\n\nFollowing music and speeches, the crowd, which includes Antigua\u2019s high commissioner, Karen-Mae Hill, the local MP, Emma Dent Coad, and members of Kelso\u2019s extended family, look on as Josephine addresses them:\n\n\u201cAfter the dark road, and after my learning experience, I was still on the quest to find my dad... I came here and I wanted to meet all you people who have been holding on to his memory for so long. And I do believe that you have held on to his memory so that I can be the one to receive it.\u201d\n\nThe next day, Josephine visits her dad\u2019s grave for the first time; the site where, in 1959, people rushed forward as his coffin was lowered into the earth and hundreds had sung hymns for an hour afterwards, with \u201cdeeply emotional emphasis\u201d said The Times. \u201cBlack hands clasped white as the mourners quietly dispersed,\u201d the Daily Worker newspaper reported. \u201cThe absence of bitterness and the determination of the organised coloured people had made it a deeply moving occasion.\u201d\n\nYet whatever changes her father\u2019s death heralded, Josephine sees the same issues being played out today in different ways. \u201cThings might have changed on paper. But in the hearts of mankind, it hasn\u2019t changed. We\u2019re doing the same things we did [then]. It\u2019s a mad circle.\u201d She talks of the \u201cmass incarceration\u201d of black men in the US, the deaths of innocent black people at the hands of the police , and her fears for her grandson as he walks the streets.\n\nIn Britain, she could have cited the Windrush scandal, the divisions being stoked in white communities by far-right extremists (as detailed in a report this week), or the 93 people who died as a result of racially motivated attacks in the 15 years since the Macpherson Report into Stephen Lawrence\u2019s death was published. But while societies struggle to move on, Josephine appears to have.\n\n\u201cComing to London is like the closing of a door. I\u2019ve walked in my father\u2019s footsteps. I\u2019ve said goodbye to him. And I want him to know that we never forgot him. We love him,\u201d she says.\n\nMark Olden is the author of \u2018Murder in Notting Hill\u2019, an investigation into Kelso Cochrane\u2019s murder", "description": "It was early in 2007, and Josephine Cochrane, a social worker in Brooklyn, New York, was having a bad day.\u00a0\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d her supervisor asked.
