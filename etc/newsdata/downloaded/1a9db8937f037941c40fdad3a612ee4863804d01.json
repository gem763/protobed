After the elections, the \"progress of the peace process\" would be a priority, he said.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "President Trump claimed on Twitter Saturday that the Taliban have\u00a0\u201cnever been hit harder,\u201d one week\u00a0after he abruptly canceled peace talks with the Islamist organization.", "authors": ["Morgan Phillips"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/AP19252812373145.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
