REUTERS/Daniel Tapia\n\nPolice responded with tear gas in the worst unrest for years in the oil-producing Andean nation.\n\n\u201cDown with the package!\u201d demonstrators shouted, referring to measures enacted this week as Moreno puts Ecuador on a centrist, market-friendly path after years of leftist rule.\n\nWith the fuel subsidy cut taking effect on Thursday, taxi, bus and truck drivers blocked streets from early morning in the highland capital Quito and in Guayaquil on the Pacific coast.\n\nIndigenous groups, students and unions joined the action, barricading roads with rocks and burning tires.\n\nIn Quito, masked youths faced off with riot police who drove them back with tear gas and deployed armoured vehicles.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an indefinite action until the government overturns the decree on subsidies. We\u2019re paralysing the nation,\u201d said bus transport leader Abel Gomez.\n\nOfficials say the elimination of fuel subsidies was necessary to lift a struggling economy and stop smuggling.\n\nMoreno, who won election in 2017 to replace Rafael Correa, told reporters the \u201cperverse\u201d and highly costly subsidy, in place for 40 years, had distorted the economy and protests would not be allowed to paralyse Ecuador.\n\n\u201cTo ensure citizens\u2019 security and avoid chaos, I have ordered a national state of emergency,\u201d the president said of the measure that suspends some rights and empowers the military to keep order.\n\n\u201cI have the courage to make the right decisions for the nation.\u201d\n\nDiesel prices rose from $1.03 to $2.30 per gallon while gasoline rose from $1.85 to $2.39.\n\nMARCH ON PALACE\n\nAs darkness fell, several thousand marchers headed for the presidential palace in downtown Quito, which was ringed by police and soldiers.\n\nIn Guayaquil, several shops were looted, authorities said. In Ecuador\u2019s third city, Cuenca, the local opposition mayor led a protest.\n\nInterior Minister Maria Romo said 19 people were arrested for blocking roads and other crimes.\n\n\u201cThe lack of transport affects us all, but equally the rise in gasoline prices will affect us,\u201d said Cesar Lopez, 39, trying to reach his business in Quito on foot.\n\nWith a population of more than 17 million people, Ecuador has a long history of political instability. Street protests toppled three presidents during economic turmoil in the decade before Correa took power in 2007.\n\nEconomy Minister Richard Martinez said on Wednesday that Ecuador hoped to save about $1.5 billion a year from eliminating fuel subsidies. Along with tax reforms, the government would benefit by about $2.27 billion, he said.\n\nOn Tuesday, Ecuador announced it was leaving the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to pump more oil and raise revenues.\n\nEcuador pumps nearly 550,000 barrels per day.\n\nState energy company Petroecuador said oil facilities were operating normally despite Thursday\u2019s unrest.\n\nThe government wants to reduce the fiscal deficit from an estimated $3.6 billion this year to under $1 billion in 2020.\n\nEcuador\u2019s debt grew under Correa, who endorsed Moreno in the 2017 election but has since become a critic of his successor\u2019s turn toward more market-friendly economic policies.\n\nMoreno\u2019s government has improved relations with the United States and reached a $4.2 billion loan deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in February, dependent on unspecified structural changes.\n\nSlideshow (11 Images)\n\nScepticism of the IMF runs strong in Ecuador and throughout Latin America, where many blame austerity policies for economic hardship.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll close all the main roads,\u201d said taxi driver Sergio Menoscal, 55, helping to block streets in Guayaquil.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re tired of false promises ... we can\u2019t be blind to a government that has done nothing for the people.\u201d", "description": "Ecuador's President Lenin Moreno declared a state of emergency on Thursday as protesters hurled stones and erected burning barricades after the end of decades-old fuel subsidies as part of a $2 billion government fiscal reform package.", "authors": ["Jose Llangari", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191003&t=2&i=1436769800&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF921OM"}
