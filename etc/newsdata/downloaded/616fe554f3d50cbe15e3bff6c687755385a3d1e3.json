You know what it was? The shooting schedule was we thought that was when it was going to be the warmest, and it just so happens that there was a cold spell that week, and it was awful.\u2019\n\n\u2018It was the weirdest thing that I\u2019ve ever had to film, and it was kind of unexpected,\u2019 he continued. \u2018I\u2019m not so claustrophobic really, but something within us knows that\u2019s not the right thing to be doing. To be buried alive.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExplaining how they managed to get the savage shots, Paul continued: \u2018I was in an open grave, and there was a tube that went underground and had this thing that I had to put in my mouth so I can breathe.\n\n\u2018I wasn\u2019t buried too much because I had to get out but it was substantial. So I would get in, they would start putting dirt over me and I\u2019m like \u201coh. I don\u2019t like this!\u201d because we would all wait until the last minute and then they would put it over my head.\u2019\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\n\u2018They would start rolling before they did it so I didn\u2019t have to wait, but they did it several times,\u2019 he continued.\n\n\u2018So my head\u2019s on the side, I\u2019m breathing through a tube, I can\u2019t see a thing, I feel a weight of all the dirt and I have to wait until action and they tap the tube in case I can\u2019t hear it.\n\n\u2018It was not\u2026fun.\u2019\n\nThings get complicated when Miles returns home to find his double taking over his life (Picture: Netflix)\n\nWhile Paul went through potentially a life-threatening situation (in a nappy no less), it seems that everyone around him was a little less bothered about it \u2013 particularly residents near the public New York park the gang shot the scenes in.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Somebody coming out of the ground wearing a diaper? \u201cThat\u2019s only the third weirdest thing we\u2019ve seen today!\u201d,\u2019 Paul joked.\n\nMore: Netflix Just because Breaking Bad got El Camino doesn\u2019t mean Friends needs film reboot Netflix shuts down production on Cowboy Bepop after John Cho injury Netflix horror movie Hush leaves viewers 'scared' and 'peeing their pants'\n\nFor his character Miles though, almost dying from being buried alive turns out to be the least of his problems, and he returns home to find out he\u2019s been replaced with a better, happier, clone version of himself.\n\nTrying to adjust to this new addition to his life, one of the many things he needs to figure out is what the hell happened \u2013 and how to tell his wife Kate (Aisling Bea) that she\u2019s now kind of married to two people.\n\nLiving With Yourself is available now on Netflix.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
