But it was a big move.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump wrote in a post on Twitter that the United States had agreed to delay increasing tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese imports from Oct. 1 to Oct. 15 \u201cas a gesture of good will.\u201d The tariffs were set to increase to 30% from 25% on the goods.\n\nTrump said he hoped to reach a trade agreement with China following more than a year of tit-for-tat exchanges of tariffs that have roiled global markets.\n\n\u201cI deal with them and I know them and I like them,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope we can do something.\u201d\n\nAsian stocks rose on Thursday, while China\u2019s yuan currency was also up 0.27 percent in offshore trade, as investors hoped for a thaw in U.S.-China trade frictions.\n\nDeputy trade negotiators are due to meet in Washington in mid-September, with minister-level talks to follow in October. Exact dates for the meetings have not been released.\n\nThe gestures may ease tensions ahead of the negotiations, but some analysts don\u2019t see it as a signal that both sides are readying a deal.\n\n\u201cThe exemption could be seen as a gesture of sincerity towards the U.S. ahead of negotiations in October but is probably more a means of supporting the economy,\u201d ING\u2019s Greater China economist Iris Pang wrote in a note.\n\n\u201cThere are still many uncertainties in the coming trade talks. An exemption list of just 16 items will not change China\u2019s stance,\u201d she said.\n\nIndeed, the exempted list pales in comparison to over 5,000 types of U.S. products that are already subject to China\u2019s additional tariffs. Moreover, major U.S. imports, such as soybeans and pork, are still subject to hefty additional duties, as China has ramped up imports from Brazil and other supplying countries.\n\nBeijing has said it would work on exempting some U.S. products from tariffs if they are not easily substituted from elsewhere. The United States is by far China\u2019s largest supplier of whey, which is an important ingredient in piglet feed and difficult to source in large volumes from elsewhere.\n\nAnalysts say that with its duties on soybeans and U.S.-made cars, China is taking aim at a key political support base of Trump, mainly the factories and farms across the Midwest and South at a time of receding momentum in the world\u2019s top economy.\n\nChina has imposed several rounds of duties on U.S. goods in retaliation against U.S. Section 301 tariffs, beginning last year in July and August with a 25% levy on about $50 billion of U.S. imports.\n\nIn all, the United States and China have slapped tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of goods in a bitter trade war that has raised the specter of a global recession, with further tariffs slated to take effect in coming months.\n\nThe items on the two tariff exemption lists - posted on the ministry\u2019s website - will not be subject to additional duties imposed by China on U.S. goods \u201cas countermeasures to U.S. Section 301 measures,\u201d the ministry said in its statement.\n\nThe exemption will take effect on Sept. 17 and be valid for a year through to Sept. 16, 2020, it said. Beijing said in May that it would start a waiver program, amid growing worries over the cost of the protracted trade war on its already slowing economy.\n\nING\u2019s Pang noted the United States had also exempted imports of 110 Chinese products from tariffs in July, including high-value items such as medical equipment and parts.\n\nTALKS\n\nChinese Vice Premier Liu He, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are expected to meet in early October in the U.S. capital, but key officials are tamping down expectations for a major accord.\n\nFor two years, the Trump administration has sought to pressure China to make sweeping changes to its policies on intellectual property protection, forced transfers of technology to Chinese firms, industrial subsidies and market access.\n\nBeijing and Washington were close to a deal last spring but U.S. officials said China backed away from an agreed text over a reluctance to change laws to address U.S. complaints.\n\nContainers are seen at the Yangshan Deep Water Port in Shanghai, China August 6, 2019.
