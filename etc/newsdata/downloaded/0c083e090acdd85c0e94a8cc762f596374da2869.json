Then It Sued Them.", "language": "en", "published_at": "2019-09-03", "text": "In 2013, officials of Carlsbad , which is self-insured, formed a task force called the Mayor\u2019s Hospital Reform Committee to address the strain on its budget over health care costs for city employees . Administrators considered sending employees to neighboring towns for care before they were able to negotiate lower rates for key services.\n\nIn a presentation to the state legislature in 2015, the mining company Intrepid Potash, a major employer in Carlsbad, calculated that it would be cheaper for one of its workers to travel to Hawaii for a gall bladder operation \u2014 including airfare for two, and a seven-day island cruise \u2014 than to get the procedure at the local hospital. The company still encourages employees to seek care out of town when possible.\n\nIn May, a nationwide survey by the RAND Corporation found that private insurers paid Carlsbad Medical Center five times more than Medicare would have paid for the same services \u2014 about twice the figure in the state overall.\n\nCarlsbad Medical Center is owned by Community Health Systems, a chain of hospitals based in Franklin, Tenn. An investigation in 2014 by the Santa Fe New Mexican newspaper found that the three hospitals charging the highest prices in the state were all owned by that chain.\n\nIn 2015, the company paid $98 million to the federal government to settle charges that it had inflated revenue by admitting patients unnecessarily. Community Health Systems admitted no wrongdoing.\n\nIn 2018, a unit of the company agreed to pay $260 million to settle charges, brought by the Department of Justice, that it had systematically overbilled for emergency room visits. Company officials noted that the fraud occurred before C.H.S. bought the subsidiary.\n\nThere are alternative hospitals near Carlsbad, but the closest is more than 40 minutes away, in the town of Artesia \u2014 which residents may find too far to drive to in an emergency.
