In fact, heavy industry has actually suffered more this time round, because of the disruption caused by the U.S.-China tariff spat and tougher emissions regulations in the car industry. The German economy in particular has proven vulnerable.\n\nWhat is different this time round is that three years of rising employment and pay seem to have imbued household budgets with a higher degree of resilience. Last week, government statisticians revised down U.S. economic growth for the second quarter to 2%, due to the impact of weaker-than-expected exports and inventory investment, but recorded a strong pickup in company earnings and consumer spending\u2014now upgraded to its strongest reading since 2014. Official figures also showed a sharp rise in U.S. consumer spending in July.\n\nThis has benefited much of the consumer-led economy. During the first half, earnings declined in S&P 500 sectors like industrials, materials and energy, but this was offset by profit growth in consumer industries, health care and even banks. Manufacturing is, after all, only 10% of the U.S. economy.\n\nAs a result, S&P 500 earnings per share are up almost 20% relative to the second quarter of 2018. In more export-dependent Europe, Euro Stoxx 50 earnings are only down slightly over the same period. Profits were much weaker in the 2015-2016 deceleration, particularly in Europe, where domestically focused industries are also holding up much better.\n\nThe disconcerting result has been strong equity returns despite an avalanche of gloomy headlines about the world economy.\n\nOne way stock analysts have made sense of the contradiction is with cautious earnings forecasts.\n\nThis can be seen in the gap between the profit growth they expect S&P 500 corporations to report in the next 12 months and the profit growth companies have actually reported for the last 12 months. The two metrics tend to be correlated. This year, however, actual profits in the U.S. have started outpacing profit expectations by the most since 2011. The opposite was true in 2015 and 2016.\n\nOf course, the gloom will prove justified if the unemployment rate rises and consumers\u2019 pockets get squeezed. Consumer sentiment data has started weakening and, unlike in 2016, there is the risk that Beijing won\u2019t unleash enough fiscal stimulus to set global demand back on track.\n\nShoppers carrying retail bags while walking in the SoHo neighborhood of New York in March.

Without a recession on the horizon, it seems unfair to dismiss the S&P 500 as overbought or simply supported by lower bond yields and central-bank policy.\n\nJudging by the resilience of corporate profits so far, equity investors should party like it isn\u2019t 2015.\n\nWrite to Jon Sindreu at jon.sindreu@wsj.com", "description": "Equity analysts are pessimistic about earnings, but U.S. consumers keep fueling the stock market.", "authors": ["Jon Sindreu", "Jon.Sindreu Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-103274/social"}
