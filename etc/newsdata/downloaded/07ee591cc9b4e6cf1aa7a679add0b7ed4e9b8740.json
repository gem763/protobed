You need D'Angelo to say, 'Yeah, I'll come.\" He had other offers. A lot of times that's like a three-team trade, they just don't happen.\n\n\"Somebody in that equation goes, 'I don't want to deal with this.' Because no one really had to -- well, Brooklyn didn't have to do it and Kevin didn't have to do it. So when you have a situation like that and you are trying to hold all these things up, it's very easy for somebody to say, 'I'm tired of this, why would I do this?' The hardest part, to be honest, was [Russell] wanting to come. Not knowing that. For his situation, once Kyrie and Kevin said they were going there, he knew that his days there were done. So he was probably looking around the league, for him to say, 'I want to go play there.' That's flattering for our organization.\"\n\n[RELATED: KD now has his own team in Nets after leaving Dubs]\n\nThe Warriors now will enter the next phase of their franchise after a dynastic five-year run that saw them win three titles and go to five straight NBA Finals.\n\nStory continues\n\nDuring the summer, the NBA landscape changed, with anywhere from six to 10 teams now having a legitimate shot at winning the NBA title. The Western Conference saw an influx of talent and the Warriors will be relying on Russell to help Steph Curry and Draymond Green survive in the rough and tumble West, especially with Klay Thompson out until at least the All-Star break with a torn ACL.\n\nMyers pulled off a minor miracle in bringing in Russell in exchange for Durant. Now it's up to him, Curry and Green to make sure the good times keep on rolling in the Bay Area.\n\nBob Myers reveals how difficult D'Angelo Russell-Kevin Durant trade was originally appeared on NBC Sports Bay Area", "description": "The Warriors pulled off a small miracle in acquiring D'Angelo Russell.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/id7SFEAWlc7NWjRSdt3R.g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ZMV3reW68NGsKTdUwpYj6A--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/csnbayarea.com/08606421bd514a2d2649e7d96644f9a4", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
