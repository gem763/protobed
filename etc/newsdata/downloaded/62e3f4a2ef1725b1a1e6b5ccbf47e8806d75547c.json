Ltd. and AltaCorp Capital Inc.\n\nThe trip, which was booked well ahead of time, occurred while the world was in turmoil following high-precision missile attacks on Abqaiq, the world\u2019s largest oil-processing facility and one that handles 60 per cent of Saudi Arabian Oil Co.\u2019s production (better known as Saudi Aramco).\n\nThe Aramco refinery strike clearly reminded these folks on Wall Street that energy security is not just some abstraction Alberta Premier Jason Kenney\n\n\u201cThe Aramco refinery strike clearly reminded these folks on Wall Street that energy security is not just some abstraction and Middle East energy is highly volatile. It could not have been a better backstop for my trip, which was to underscore the reliability of Canada as a major source of energy,\u201d Kenney said, referring to the 15-per-cent surge in global oil prices and the double-digit stock gains by oil companies, including Canadian producers.\n\nAnalysts said the attacks re-introduced a \u201cgeopolitical risk premium\u201d that had been absent from the market for the past five years, which will cause major oil-importing countries such as China to re-examine their supply chains amid fresh concerns about energy security and potentially boost the case for investing in oil-producing countries like Canada with less geopolitical risk.\n\nKenney, who was elected earlier this year on a promise to boost the local oilpatch, said he\u2019s aware the oil and gas sector has fallen out of favour with institutional investors around the world as its equities have underperformed the market. Still, he is trying to seize on some of the newly resurfaced concerns about energy security and geopolitical risk and, so far, his message seems to have found a receptive audience in New York.\n\nCanada and Brazil are the two places that are going to benefit Robert Johnston of Eurasia Group\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any geopolitical risk in Canada,\u201d said Robert Johnston, managing director, global energy and natural resources, at the Eurasia Group, a political risk research and consulting firm.\n\nHe said Canadian oil producers have been upset about a lack of new pipelines that have hampered the growth of supply from Alberta and Saskatchewan, but these lower-order regulatory risks pale in comparison to the risk of violence in the Middle East and elsewhere.\n\nJohnston, who met with Kenney while the premier was in New York, said he\u2019s \u201cbullish\u201d on Canada\u2019s ability to boost its production and take some of the market share that Saudi Arabia and other members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries could lose over the longer term as a result of the fallout from the missile strikes.\n\n\u201cCanada and Brazil are the two places that are going to benefit,\u201d he said, noting that both countries have large investable oil reserves and major investors are looking for scale.\n\nIf that investment happens, it would represent a dramatic reversal of fortunes for the Canadian oilpatch, where the only reliable trend in recent years has been a consistent exodus of capital and foreign operators from plays such as the oilsands.\n\nCanada\u2019s energy industry needs to see progress on pipelines and a clearer regulatory system before investors will return en masse\n\nShares in most upstream oil and gas companies are trading at or near all-time lows and the amount of money those companies are spending on drilling for new oil and gas has nosedived.\n\nCanadian producers are on pace to invest $19.5 billion in conventional oil and gas projects in the country this year and $12 billion in the oilsands, which is down 58 per cent and 64 per cent, respectively, from peak levels in 2014, according to ARC Energy Research Institute data.\n\nSpending on new projects is also on the decline elsewhere, with the notable exception of the Permian Basin in West Texas, which has been the world\u2019s hottest oil play in recent years, hoovering up almost all the available capital for oil investment.\n\nOPEC\u2019s most recent World Oil Outlook noted that upstream investment in new oil supply peaked at US$527 billion in 2014, then fell 26 per cent in 2015 and 24 per cent in 2016. Investment slightly recovered by five per cent in 2017 and is projected to rise six per cent per year from 2018 through 2023.\n\nOthers are more bullish.\n\nFor example, the International Energy Agency in its most recent outlook forecasts that upstream spending on oil and gas will increase to US$580 billion between 2018 and 2025, from US$540 billion in 2017, and then rise again to an average of US$740 billion between 2025 and 2040.\n\nEnergy-focused hedge funds are also now managing more money than they did before the oil price crash of 2014, according to Eurekahedge, a Singapore-based firm that analyzes hedge-fund trends.\n\nIts data show that 228 energy-focused hedge funds managed US$59.5 billion in assets as of August 2019, up 10 per cent from US$53.8 billion last year and 25 per cent from US$47.5 billion in 2013.\n\nEurekahedge data come from a combination of both long and short funds, so it isn\u2019t necessarily a clear indication of bullishness in oil.\n\nHowever, active long-only energy fund managers in Canada have been shifting their investment dollars back into the country after years of investing elsewhere, particularly into U.S. producers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m reinvigorated about our sector,\u201d said Rafi Tahmazian, managing director and senior portfolio manager at Canoe Financial LP.\n\nTahmazian shifted his investments to the U.S. in the fall of 2015, but has been buying Canadian oil companies since this past spring.\n\n\u201cI do believe this sector trades at skeletal values,\u201d he said, adding that he expects the attacks on Saudi Arabia could lead to more \u201cspeculative capital\u201d being deployed in the Canadian energy sector.\n\nRight now, Tahmazian said, oil investors are watching the fallout from the attacks and evaluating how the Saudis are managing it.\n\nIn the days that followed the attacks, Saudi officials blamed Iran, but also presented a brave face in an attempt to calm the market. They promised to honour all their contracts to supply oil, complete repairs quickly and, critically, go ahead with a planned initial public offering of Crown jewel Saudi Aramco.\n\nOil prices dropped slightly following those assurances, because Saudi and United States officials said there was more than enough oil in storage to keep the market well supplied.\n\nBut many analysts and investors believe it will take longer to repair the facilities than the Saudis are admitting, draining oil in storage to critical levels, and that further escalation in the Middle East will cause additional supply shocks.\n\nIn the meantime, investors and oil importers are looking for other jurisdictions to invest their cash and source their crude.\n\n\u201cSaudi\u2019s own inventories, which are already in decline, will face heightened pressure as the country strives to normalize exports, particularly given that we do not take the official repair timetable at face value,\u201d Raymond James analysts said in a note published Monday, which added that \u201cthe odds of military escalation between Saudi and Iran are more likely than the market is currently pricing into oil.\u201d\n\nMost analysts expect oil prices will likely increase further if oil storage levels sharply decline, Abqaiq repairs are extensive and time consuming, or there are additional attacks.\n\n\u201cThe market is not pricing in a retaliation premium,\u201d RBC Capital Markets managing director, global energy strategy Michael Tran said, adding the Saudis are unlikely to allow the attacks to go unchecked.\n\nCanadian oil producers could potentially benefit from any disruption in the oil market and pitch their country as a logical place to rely on for energy security, Tran said, if only it had new pipelines operating today.\n\nFor example, he said, China currently relies on just five countries for two-thirds of its oil imports: Saudi Arabia supplies 15 per cent while Iran and Venezuela combined have historically accounted for another 10 per cent. Saudi Arabia\u2019s abilities are now in question and supplies from the latter two countries have been interrupted by sanctions and, in the case of Venezuela, economic collapse.\n\n25 per cent of Chinese imports are now hamstrung\n\n\u201cSo 25 per cent of Chinese imports are now hamstrung,\u201d Tran said, adding that China imports a lot of heavier oil so Western Canada Select heavy blends would be \u201ca perfect fit.\u201d\n\nBill Farren-Price, a long-time analyst of Middle East geopolitics and director of RS Energy Group, a Calgary-based investment adviser, said the attacks on Abqaiq represented the largest hit to oil supplies since Iraq\u2019s invasion of Kuwait in 1990.\n\n\u201cMore than half of Saudi crude went offline,\u201d he said.\n\nFarren-Price said the attacks are likely to have two consequences for major oil-importing countries. It will cause countries such as China, India, South Korea and Japan to \u201cbroaden their base of supply,\u201d and it will potentially push those countries to take more steps toward electrifying their transportation sectors through regulations or directives that encourage the adoption of more electric vehicles.\n\n\u201cThis could be a push to move on from the oil era,\u201d he said, especially if supply disruptions have any longer-term effects that wreak havoc on oil-importing countries and alter the long-term outlook for oil demand.\n\nBoth scenarios could potentially prove a boost to non-OPEC oil and gas producers, including Canada.\n\nIf Asian oil-importing countries opt for more electrification of their grid, the move would likely result in rising demand for natural gas to produce caseload electricity. Analysts say in that case, Canadian producers exporting liquefied natural gas from proposed projects off the West Coast could stand to benefit.\n\n\u201c(The attacks) absolutely should be an eye opener,\u201d said Les Stelmach, senior vice-president and portfolio manager at Franklin Bissett Investment Management, who added it\u2019s likely that some generalist funds currently underweight on oil and gas investments will likely move to buy into the sector.\n\nStelmach said, however, the Canadian energy industry needs to see meaningful progress on pipelines and a clearer regulatory system before investors will move back into the Canadian oilpatch en masse.\n\nOn that issue, Kenney said he\u2019s optimistic that progress is being made on new pipeline projects and that companies such as Enbridge Inc. and TC Energy Corp. have had some success adding drag-reducing agents to existing pipelines, boosting their capacity to move heavy oil.\n\nTo address concerns about Alberta\u2019s oil export capacity, Kenney said he also had conversations in New York about how close the province was to striking a rail deal with oil producers in the province.\n\nUnder the deal, which Kenney said he expects to announce in a month, the province will sell its own crude-by-rail contracts to ship oil out of the province to oil producers. Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. has previously confirmed its interest in buying these contracts.\n\nOnce those contracts change hands, and if companies commit to moving more oil out of the province on trains, the province is willing to partially lift its production caps on the oilsands, which were imposed at the beginning of this year as domestic heavy oil prices cratered.\n\nPerhaps encouraged by the market reinforcing his investment pitch in New York, Kenney said he\u2019s now planning additional trips to the U.S. in an attempt to woo investors in Dallas and Houston in November after the crude-by-rail deal is finalized, and then San Francisco after that.\n\nEarly in 2020, Kenney said he also intends to lead a similar trip to South Korea and Japan in an attempt to sell investors on Canadian energy security.\n\n\u201cSeveral of the major fund managers in New York strongly recommended we increase our visibility in Japan and Korea, in particular, but also in India and the Philippines,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of capital available in those countries and they\u2019re completely dependent on imports and they want to diversify their source countries. When people talk about a political risk in Canada because we\u2019re having some arguments over pipelines, that should rate as a much, much lower risk issue than the very real, vital, strategic risks that exist in the Middle East.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Email: gmorgan@nationalpost.com | Twitter: geoffreymorgan", "description": "Sure we have regulatory headaches, but they pale in comparison to the turmoil in the Middle East and elsewhere", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/oil-investment-new.png", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
