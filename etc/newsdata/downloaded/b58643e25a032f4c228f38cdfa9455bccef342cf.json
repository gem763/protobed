Trump has meanwhile taken to calling Biden \"corrupt.\"\n\nThe impact of the scandal is unclear, as the impeachment proceedings began near the end of September.\n\nSanders was recovering on Thursday after putting his campaign on hold the day prior to be treated for a blocked artery. His wife says he plans to participate in this month's Democratic debate.\n\nThe winner of the Democratic primary will be decided next year, and is set to face Trump, a Republican, in the November 2020 presidential election.", "description": "Democratic frontrunner in the 2020 US election Joe Biden announced on Thursday he'd raised $15.2 million in the third quarter, far less than progressive rival Bernie Sanders or centrist mayor Pete Buttigieg.
