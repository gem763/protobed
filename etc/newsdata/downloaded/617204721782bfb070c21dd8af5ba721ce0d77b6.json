He also offers his more than-two-decades of real estate expertise and knowledge to sellers, developers and buyers, and is responsible for over $3 billion in transactions.\n\nWe caught up with the South African-born, New York City-based Mr. Steinberg, 54, to discuss the importance of authenticity in real estate, why a home should feel collected, and more.\n\nMansion Global: Describe your dream property.\n\nLeonard Steinberg: It would have light and large windows, but I don\u2019t like all glass. Room dimension, scale and ceiling height matter. I like one or two rooms with extra-high ceiling height. I like a view. It can be an intimate look at a small lane or even a small garden; it doesn\u2019t have to be Central Park. Most importantly, the quality of the space is critical.\n\nAlso, mechanicals that function well, especially in New York, where there are extremes of climate. Keeping the right temperature is a true luxury.\n\nI\u2019m a light sleeper, so I like a highly insulated home, and you can\u2019t hear anything.\n\nMore: Sotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s Executive Says Customizing a Home is Key\n\nMG: Do you have a real estate property that got away?\n\nLS: I fall in love with practically every apartment I sell. We recently sold a penthouse in the village, and I\u2019ve been in this business for 23 years, and it was the only one that I wanted to cry about when we sold.\n\nMG: What does luxury mean to you?\n\nLS: Luxury is different things to different people. It\u2019s that which provides great comfort and a respite from your normal life, and it\u2019s a place where you create the moments that matter. There\u2019s something about a home that fuels the energy of your life. The home, and the setting and environment that it\u2019s set in matter.\n\nI always say time is the last luxury, so if you can find any time\u2014whether from convenience or walkability, that matters.\n\nAnd one of the great luxuries is beauty, but it\u2019s different for everyone. It can fuel creativity and reduce stress.\n\nMore: Design Firm Chief Says Luxury is About Tapping Into All the Senses\n\nMG: What area do you think is the next hub for luxury properties?\n\nLS: Manhattan is becoming \u201cneighborhood agnostic.\u201d There are very few neighborhoods that don\u2019t have luxury buildings. Also, Uber democratizes things.\n\nMG: What\u2019s the biggest surprise in the luxury real estate market now?\n\nLS: How luxury interiors are becoming more like high-fashion\u2014 and trendier.\n\nYou need to be careful that what you design is not a pure self-indulgence, and that it lasts over time, and isn\u2019t too taste-specific.\n\nYou don\u2019t want things to look generic, but you want to have a home that feels collected.\n\nFrom Penta: Good Company: Carol Chugani\u2019s Sustainable and Multi-Functional Cashmere\n\nMG: Where are the best luxury homes in the world and why?\n\nLS: America does have amazing luxury homes. New York has some of the most beautiful ones, but they\u2019re rare. Paris has always had exquisite real estate, but they don\u2019t have the modern features. There\u2019s beautiful real estate around the world\u2014in Buenos Aires, Cape Town, Aspen, Montecito, Miami. There\u2019s something to be found everywhere, but it takes a discerning eye to differentiate between good and great.\n\nMG: What\u2019s your favorite part of your home?\n\nLS: My bedroom is like a gray and cream cloud. It feels protected. We have filtered fresh air, and the temperature is maintained beautifully. Aesthetically I don\u2019t think it\u2019s earth-shattering, but it\u2019s calming, which, for me, is extremely valuable.\n\nMG: What best describes the theme to your home and why?\n\nLS: It has a collected aesthetic, made of things I\u2019ve collected over the years, with the help of designer so it doesn\u2019t look like a mess.\n\nI wanted my home to be aware of its environment and setting. It doesn\u2019t look like a sleek high-rise in Singapore, for example.\n\nI think authenticity is often missing in real estate.\n\nMore: Luxury is About Inner Wellness, Says Los Angeles-Based Designer\n\nMG: What\u2019s the most valuable thing in your home?\n\nLS: My art. It\u2019s an eclectic mix. But I have a piece by Elger Esser\u2014landscape scene in the south of France. In the middle of winter in New York, it transports you to the summer in France.\n\nMG: What\u2019s the most valuable amenity to have in a home right now?\n\nLS: A gym. Helps wellbeing and health. I have one in my weekend house.\n\nMG: What\u2019s your best piece of real estate advice?\n\nLS: To be wary of bargains and seek value in that which I call collector-quality elements\u2014things that are not easily replicated.\n\nIf you\u2019re coming to New York City, you want to have a New York City experience; if you\u2019re going to Aspen, you want to have an Aspen experience; in Paris, it\u2019s about having a Paris experience.\n\nMore: New York Real Estate Investor and Developer Says Despite Challenges, Manhattan\u2019s Market is Still a Leader\n\nMG: What\u2019s going on in the news that will have the biggest impact on the luxury real estate market?\n\nLS: We\u2019re in a time of uncertainty and in the depths of great prosperity. These are the most prosperous times in U.S. history, but it\u2019s chaotic.\n\nThe U.S.-China trade conflict is a big one. It seems to be a negative on everyone\u2019s clarity/vision for the future.\n\nThere are lots of rumblings that we\u2019re overdue for a correction in the real estate market, since we\u2019ve been on an uptick in 10 years.\n\nThere\u2019s something in between a global and a nationalist economy. At the moment, the extremes seem to be winning, but ultimately \u201cglocalism\u201d is the way to be.\n\nThere\u2019s a wait-and-see attitude at the moment, despite low interest rates with available capital.\n\nThe luxury real estate buyer is always afraid of buying on a high and selling on a low.\n\nMore: Designer Andre Fu Says a Home Should Reflect Its Neighborhood\n\nMG: What\u2019s the best area for investing in luxury properties?\n\nLS: Anywhere with good quality of life and anywhere with good jobs. Security is a big one, too.\n\n\n\nClimate change makes a place\u2019s current weather not matter as much. But as a result of climate change, you need self sufficiency too. Who knows what kind of storms there will be and what kinds of strains will be put on utility services?\n\nMG: If you had a choice of living in a new development or a prime resale property, which would you choose and why?\n\nLS: The last two apartments I\u2019ve bought have all been in new buildings, the predominant reason being that I\u2019ve been involved with them. I like modern mechanicals\u2014an insulated apartment that\u2019s energy efficient, sound efficient and has filtered fresh air.\n\nMore: Holistic Wellness is the Perk Buyers Really Want, Says NYC Brokerage Chief\n\nMG: What area currently has the best resale value?\n\nLS: There are always going to be the super-prime locations. People are always drawn toward the west, where the sun sets.\n\nGlobally, luxury navigates toward blue-chip areas. Only long-term speculators feel comfortable in other places. But if you want to invest, you want to look to tech hubs, such as Boston, Austin and New York. You see it in Los Angeles, San Francisco, even a little in Miami. You want to go wherever the jobs of the future are.\n\nClick to Read More Luxury Real Estate Professionals Share Their Insights\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["Lucy Cohen Blatter"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-113820?size=1.7777777777777777&width=1280", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
