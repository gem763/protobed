From the moment she sought a multi-million dollar payout in return for not making these baseless allegations, which we rejected, we knew that she was waiting for an opportune time to begin this.\n\n\u2018We will demonstrate that this case has no legal merit.\u2019\n\nRose McGowan released her book Brave in 2018 (Picture: Backgrid)\n\nA representative for Lisa Bloom has also responded to the allegations, claiming it is \u2018inexcusable\u2019 that the lawyer has been involved in the lawsuit.\n\nThey said: \u2018It is inexcusable that Ms. McGowan chose to include my client in her lawsuit. Facts matter.\n\n\u2018There is simply no credible factual or legal basis for her claims against my client. We look forward to our day in court to set the record straight.\u201d", "description": "Rose McGowan was one of the first people to bring sexual assault accusations against Harvey Weinstein.", "authors": ["Rebecca Lewis"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/sei_7919352_1571868716.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
