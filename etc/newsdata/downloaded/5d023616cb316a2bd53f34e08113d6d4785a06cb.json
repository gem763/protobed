REUTERS/Phil Noble\n\n(Reuters) - UK blue-chip shares slipped on Tuesday, as a second set of disappointing data from China this week cemented fears of a slowdown in global economic growth, while gains in the pound amid fading no-deal Brexit worries hit multinational stocks.\n\nThe FTSE 100 index .FTSE dipped 0.4%, having suffered its worst day this month in the last session, with equipment rental giant Ashtead (AHT.L) falling 3% after in-line results.\n\nThe more domestically-focussed index of midcaps .FTMC was flat by 0705 GMT, supported by a 22% jump in Galliford Try (GFRD.L) after the construction company said it had restarted preliminary talks to sell its residential units to housebuilder Bovis Homes (BVS.L).\n\nSterling was seen close to a six-week high it hit on Monday after parliament passed a bill blocking a no-deal Brexit, weighing on British American Tobacco (BATS.L) and Diageo (DGE.L) as strength in the local currency meant the value of their U.S. earnings would be lower.", "description": "UK blue-chip shares slipped on Tuesday, as a second set of disappointing data from China this week cemented fears of a slowdown in global economic growth, while gains in the pound amid fading no-deal Brexit worries hit multinational stocks.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190910&t=2&i=1428231029&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF890GI", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
