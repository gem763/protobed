Each was less than 1% from July\u2019s all-time highs during early trading.\n\nHere were the main moves in the market, as of 8:10 a.m. ET:\n\nS&P 500 (ES=F): +0.24%, or 7.25 points\n\nDow (YM=F): +0.27%, or 74 points\n\nNasdaq (NQ=F): +0.5%, or 39.75 points\n\n10-year Treasury yield (^TNX): -5.1 bps to 1.682%\n\nGold (GC=F): +1.12% to $1,520.10 per ounce\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Wednesday said he would put off imposing additional tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods by two weeks to October 15. In late August, Trump had said he planned to increase the tariff rate on these goods to 30% from 25% starting October 1.\n\nTrump wrote on Twitter that this \u201cgesture of good will\u201d was \u201cat the request of Vice Premier of China, Liu He, and due to the fact that the People\u2019s Republic of China will be celebrating their 70th Anniversary on October 1st.\u201d\n\nThis came a day after China\u2019s Ministry of Finance announced 16 U.S. product categories would be exempted from new tariffs, and ahead of another round of trade talks scheduled for October between negotiators from both sides.\n\nTrump\u2019s move \u201cshould be seen as a goodwill gesture the US side made for creating good vibes for the trade talks scheduled in early October,\u201d Hu Xijin, editor in chief of Chinese Communist Party-run publication the Global Times wrote in a Twitter post.\n\nBut these seemingly reciprocal moves at de-escalating the trade war still leave a bevy of levies on the table for consumers and producers to grapple with in the coming months. On December 15, the U.S. is set to hit a batch of about $160 billion worth of Chinese imports with a 15% rate of tariff, which had originally been pushed back to mitigate some of the impact on holiday shoppers. As a retaliatory move, China has vowed to hit back with a batch of tariffs that same day on about $75 billion in U.S. imports.\n\nEven easier\n\nOverseas, the wave of monetary policy easing that has swept global central banks continued Thursday with the European Central Bank\u2019s latest policy decision.\n\nThe ECB slashed interest rates further below zero and announced it would restart its quantitative easing program with a program to purchase 20 billion euros of bonds every month starting in November for \u201cas long as necessary,\u201d in a move to help stimulate the flagging eurozone economy.\n\nTraders work on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., September 5, 2019.

The move, which applies to commercial bank deposits at the ECB, was widely expected by economists and is aimed at incentivizing banks to lend out to consumers and businesses.\n\nHowever, some exceptions apply to the negative deposit rate, with the ECB announcing that \u201ca two-tier system for reserve renumeration will be introduced, in which part of bank\u2019s holdings of excess liquidity will be exempt from the negative deposit facility rate.\u201d This helps reduce some of the impact to bank profitability that negative interest rates would have on commercial lenders.\n\nAt the same time, the ECB also said it would leave its benchmark interest rate at 0.000%, which avoids negative interest rates for savers.\n\nThe euro plummeted to less than $1.10 against the U.S. dollar and toward its lowest close in more than two years immediately following the ECB decision. U.S. Treasury yields followed U.K. and German government bond yields lower after the ECB cut rates.\n\nThe ECB decision comes a week before the U.S. Federal Reserve is set to unveil its own latest monetary policy decision. Market participants widely expect the Fed will cut benchmark interest rates for a second time in 2019, with markets pricing in an 88.8% probability of such an outcome, as of Thursday morning.", "description": "Stock futures climbed toward new record highs Thursday following moves by China and the U.S. to at least temporarily de-escalate the ongoing trade war.", "authors": ["Emily Mccormick"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/NjPhsHtyHRt9oDqboAUuOA--~B/aD0zODYyO3c9NTc5MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/9f263490-d3c5-11e9-ae7c-b6d9ac2fda14", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
