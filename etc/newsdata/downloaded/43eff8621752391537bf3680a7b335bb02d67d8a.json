The pledge now has 204 signatories from 23 different countries, including Marc Benioff, MacKenzie Bezos, Sara Blakely, Richard Branson, Micheal Bloomberg, and Ray Dalio. The pledge could be worth up to $600 million (R8.7 million) by 2022, research firm Wealth-X found.\n\nThose impressive stats aside, the pledge has come under criticism in the past for not verifying that signatories actually donate the money they pledge and for not accepting applications to become a signatory from the public. The late hedge fund manager Robert Wilson called the pledge \"practically worthless\" in an email exchange published by Buzzfeed News in 2014 because it allows donors to name their own foundations in their wills, Business Insider previously reported.\n\n\"These foundations become, more often than not, bureaucracy-ridden sluggards,\" Wilson wrote. \"These rich are delighted to toss off a few million a year in order to remain socially acceptable. But that's it.\" While Wilson was offered the opportunity to sign the pledge by Gates, he declined.\n\nTow and his now-deceased wife Claire signed the Giving Pledge in September 2012 and, in an open letter to Gates at the time, wrote that they \"never believed that the wealth accumulated was truly ours.\" At the October 2019 ceremony, Tow said that he plans to give away all of his fortune with the exception of \"modest provisions\" for family members.\n\nTow built his fortune after founding telecommunications provider Century Communications, according to the Carnegie Corporation. In 2002, Forbes estimated that Tow had a net worth of $550 million (R8 billion); however, Tow's net worth must have grown substantially in the decade following as only \"billionaires or those who would be billionaires if not for their giving\" are invited to sign the Giving Pledge, according to the organisation's website.\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "Billionaire Leonard Tow's remarks come as the ultra-wealthy face heightened criticism over their philanthropic works \u2014 or lack thereof.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9518/3e2376377cdd41efa8c8b430e4934c25.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
