U.S. natgas futures fall to fresh 3-week low on moderating weather\n\nSept 27 (Reuters) - U.S. natural gas futures fell to a fresh three-week low on Friday on forecasts for the weather to moderate over the next two weeks, keeping both cooling and heating demand low and allowing the amount of gas in storage to rise to normal levels for the winter.\n\nTraders noted the decline in overall demand would come despite an expected increase in liquefied natural gas (LNG) and Mexican exports to record highs.\n\nOn its first day as the front-month, gas futures for November delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange were down 5.5 cents, or 2.3%, to $2.388 per million British thermal units at 9:52 a.m. EDT (1352 GMT). On Thursday, the contract closed at its lowest since Sept. 3.\n\nThat put the front-month on track to decline for a ninth day in a row for the first time since August 2009. The most losing sessions in a row was 10 in Aug. 2001.\n\nThose days of declines swung the contract from technically overbought territory last week to oversold now with a relative strength index (RSI) below 30.\n\nIn addition, that drop in the front-month carried over to later-dated futures with calendar 2020 NGYstc1 falling enough to briefly put calendar 2021 NGYstc2 back into a premium over 2020 for the first time since early September.\n\nFor the week, the contract was down about 6%, putting it on track to decline for a second week in a row.\n\nData provider Refinitiv projected gas demand in the lower 48 U.S. states would slide to an average of 83.3 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) in two weeks as cooling demand declines faster than heating demand rises. That compares with an average of around 83.8 bcfd this week and next.\n\nThose demand forecasts include exports, which analysts said would likely rise as more gas flows to LNG export plants and pipelines to Mexico.\n\nGas flows to LNG plants held around 6.3 bcfd on Thursday, up from a low of 5.7 bcfd last week following the shutdown of Dominion Energy Inc's D.N Cove Point in Maryland for planned maintenance, according to Refinitiv data. Point remains shut. The extra gas is flowing to other terminals like Freeport LNG's plant in Texas and Cheniere Energy Inc's Sabine Pass in Louisiana.\n\nRefinitiv projected flows to LNG terminals could rise to a record high of 7.1 bcfd in two weeks.\n\nExports to Mexico eased to 5.2 bcfd on Thursday, down from 5.4 bcfd on Wednesday. That compares with a record high of 5.9 bcfd last week after gas started moving through the 2.6-bcfd Valley Crossing pipeline from Texas. said pipeline flows to Mexico would likely top those record levels soon now that Kinder Morgan (NYSE: ) Inc's KMI.N Permian Express pipe in Texas entered service. said utilities likely added 100 billion cubic feet (bcf) of gas to storage during the week ended Sept. 27. That compares with an injection of 91 bcf during the same week last year and a five-year (2014-18) average build of 83 bcf for the period. EIA/GAS\n\nIf correct, that increase would boost stockpiles to 3.305 trillion cubic feet (tcf), 0.9% below the five-year average of 3.335 tcf for this time of year.\n\nThe amount of gas in inventory has remained below the five-year average since September 2017. It fell as much as 33% below that in March 2019. But with production near a record high, analysts said stockpiles should reach a near-normal 3.7 tcf by the end of summer injection season on Oct. 31. NGAS/POLL\n\nGas production in the lower 48 states, meanwhile, rose to 92.6 bcfd on Thursday from 92.4 bcfd on Wednesday, according to Refinitiv data. That compares with an all-time daily high of 93.0 bcfd on Aug. 19.\n\nIn the spot market, next-day gas in New York NG-CG-NY-SNL and New England NG-CG-BS-SNL and power in New England EL-PK-NPMS-SNL fell to their lowest since November 2017.\n\nThe premium of spot gas at the U.S. Henry Hub NG-PCN-APP-SNL benchmark in Louisiana over Dominion South NG-PCN-APP-SNL in southwest Pennsylvania in the Marcellus shale, meanwhile, rose to $1.26 per mmBtu, its highest since October 2018.\n\nWeek ended\n\nYear ago Five-year\n\nended\n\nSep 27\n\naverage\n\n27(Forecas Sep 20\n\nSep 27\n\n(Actual)\n\nU.S. natgas storage (bcf):\n\nRefinitiv Heating (HDD), Cooling (CDD) and Total (TDD) Degree Days\n\nTwo-Week Total Forecast\n\nCurrent\n\nPrior\n\nPrior\n\n10-Year\n\n30-Year\n\nNorm U.S. GFS HDDs\n\n84 U.S. GFS CDDs\n\n63 U.S. GFS TDDs\n\nRefinitiv U.S. Weekly GFS Supply and Demand Forecasts\n\nPrior Week Current Next Week This week Five-Yea\n\nlast year\n\nAverage\n\nMonth U.S. Supply (bcfd)\n\nU.S. Lower 48 Dry Production\n\n75.2 U.S. Imports from Canada\n\n7.7 U.S. LNG Imports\n\n0.1 Total U.S. Supply\n\nU.S. Demand (bcfd) U.S. Exports to Canada\n\n2.2 U.S. Exports to Mexico\n\n3.8 U.S. LNG Exports\n\n1.1 U.S. Commercial\n\n4.8 U.S. Residential\n\n3.8 U.S. Power Plant\n\n29.9 U.S. Industrial\n\n20.2 U.S. Plant Fuel\n\n4.6 U.S. Pipe Distribution\n\n2.0 U.S. Vehicle Fuel\n\n0.1 Total U.S. Consumption\n\n65.4 Total U.S. Demand\n\nSNL U.S. Natural Gas Next-Day Prices ($ per mmBtu)\n\nCurrent\n\nPrior\n\nHenry Hub NG-W-HH-SNL\n\nTransco Z6 New York NG-CG-NY-SNL\n\nPG&E Citygate NG-CG-PGE-SNL\n\nDominion South NG-PCN-APP-SNL\n\nChicago Citygate NG-CG-CH-SNL\n\nAlgonquin Citygate NG-CG-BS-SNL\n\nSoCal Citygate NG-SCL-CGT-SNL\n\nWaha Hub NG-WAH-WTX-SNL\n\nSNL U.S. Power Next-Day Prices ($ per megawatt-hour)\n\nCurrent\n\nPrior\n\nNew England EL-PK-NPMS-SNL\n\n20.50\n\n21.25\n\nPJM West EL-PK-PJMW-SNL\n\n30.25\n\n32.48\n\nErcot North EL-PK-ERTN-SNL\n\n37.50\n\n170.00\n\nMid C EL-PK-MIDC-SNL\n\n25.10\n\n21.88\n\nPalo Verde EL-PK-PLVD-SNL\n\n22.50\n\n26.50\n\nSP-15 EL-PK-SP15-SNL\n\n32.50\n\n58.50", "description": "U.S. natgas futures fall to fresh 3-week low on moderating weather", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEC0E0N3_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
