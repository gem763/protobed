This week, the \u201cOne Tree Hill\u201d actress explained her decision to finally go all the way with Morgan, who plays Negan on the long-running \"Walking Dead\" series on AMC, in an interview with People.\n\nBEN AFFLECK APOLOGIZES FOR GROPING ACTRESS HILARIE BURTON\n\n\u201cWe had built this life together,\u201d said Burton, 37, who shares 9-year-old son Gus and 19-month daughter George with Morgan, 53. \u201cWe\u2019d had kids together. I think there comes a point where you just don\u2019t want to go another day by being inauthentic about it.\u201d\n\nThe former \u201cWhite Collar\u201d actress said her choice was heavily influenced by the couple\u2019s decision to move out of Los Angeles to a farm in upstate New York, where she wrote her upcoming book about the experience.\n\n'THE WALKING DEAD' STAR JEFFREY DEAN MORGAN REACTS TO BEN AFFLECK'S APOLOGY TO HIS WIFE\n\n\u201cI have a book coming out in March with Harper One called \u2018The Rural Diaries,\u2019 and it really is about the choices that we made leaving L.A. to go live on a farm in upstate New York,\u201d she explained at a press day for Lifetime\u2019s upcoming Christmas films. \u201cIt\u2019s not a convenient lifestyle, certainly for our business, but those choices that we made to create that life have really forced us to be, yeah, more authentic with our choices, like the animals have to be fed, the wood has to be chopped, and so we wanted to be a concrete truth, like those things.\u201d\n\nMorgan and Burton got married this month in a covert ceremony, although the pair were long believed to already be hitched.\n\nPAUL RUDD AND JEFFREY DEAN MORGAN KEEP CLASSIC CANDY SHOP SWEET\n\n\u201cThis past weekend was the best of my entire life. There are dozens of thank-yous I need to make. So bear with me over the next week as I gush over the amazing group of people who gave us this beautiful moment,\u201d Burton captioned a black and white photo of her and Morgan embracing. \u201cBut before we do any of that, Jeff and I just want to put it out there that WE GOT MARRIED! For real.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve lived as husband and wife for a decade. We\u2019ve built a family, and a farm and found our community. For years, publications have reported that we got married in 2014 or 2015 and that I\u2019ve been married and divorced before. All untrue.\u201d\n\nJEFFREY DEAN MORGAN ADMITS HE'S NEVER SEEN WIFE HILARIE BURTON'S SHOW 'ONE TREE HILL'\n\n\u201cWE knew our truth. So it felt silly to try and correct anything. Here\u2019s the God\u2019s honest fact: From the moment I met @jeffreydeanmorgan , he was my husband. Rather than make vows right out of the gate, we lived them. For over ten years. The good times and the bad,\u201d Burton wrote in her post. \u201cStanding up there with our children at our sides - celebrating all that has been - was bliss. I love you Jeffrey. I love our intimate group of friends and family who joined us. I love the various circles of loved ones who have supported us over the years.\u201d\n\nShe concluded: \u201cIt was private and magical and everything I dreamed. So yeah. I\u2019m Mrs. Morgan. 10.5.19.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAccording to Us Weekly, the two met in 2009 when they were introduced by Morgan's \u201cSupernatural\u201d co-star Jensen Ackles, who also officiated the lively ceremony along with \u2018Walking Dead\u2019 co-star Norman Reedus.\n\nBurton told People during her interview that planning the lifetime occasion took \u201ca couple months,\u201d but that \u201cit wasn\u2019t a big deal. It was like nothing.\u201d\n\nFox News' Tyler McCarthy contributed to this report.", "description": "At one point or another a conscientious decision is made in a relationship to get married, break up or stay together without officially wedding, but with a semblance of marriage.", "authors": ["Julius Young", "Julius Is An La Entertainment Reporter For Fox News."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/ertert56546gfd65.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
