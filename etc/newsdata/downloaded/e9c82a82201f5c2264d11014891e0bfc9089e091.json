Protests will enter a fourth month on Oct. 9. But, it\u2019s feared that Lam\u2019s use of the Emergency Regulations Ordinance (ERO) may be a prelude to further restrictions, not least on Hong Kong\u2019s communication networks.\n\nThe ERO is a colonial-era law dating to 1922, and gives the government sweeping powers. The government can \u201cmake any regulations whatsoever\u201d that it considers to be in the \u201cpublic interest\u201d if faced with \u201can occasion of emergency or public danger.\u201d Possible measures may include shutting down communication networks, censoring publications, and entering and searching private premises without a warrant.\n\nLam is under increasing pressure to quell the protesters, who provided a grim alternative narrative to China\u2019s 70th anniversary celebrations on Oct.1. The protesters chanted anti-Beijing slogans and clashed with police, who shot a teenage protester saying that he tried to carry out a \u201criotous attack\u201d on officers.\n\nSoon after the face-mask ban was announced, LIHKG, the de facto online headquarters of Hong Kong\u2019s protesters, began to urge people to download virtual private networks(VPN). VPNs are used to circumvent internet controls, such as blocked or blacklisted websites. Facebook and Twitter, for example, are not available in China, but under the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d framework, people in Hong Kong enjoy greater freedom to roam the worldwide web than on the mainland. Hong Kong has had free access to the internet, so VPNs weren\u2019t a hot topic of discussion among the city\u2019s internet-users.\n\nA post titled \u201cBuy VPN! Buy VPN! Buy VPN!\u201d by LIHKG-user \u201cBlooddy\u201d on Oct. 4, had 675 comments within a short time, and became the most discussed topic on the website\u2019s political affairs channel. \u201cSoon, LIHKG and Telegram could be blocked. VPNs are the only hope we have, please purchase one when the tools are still available!\u201d Blooddy wrote.\n\nAnother user, \u201cdata.guy,\u201d who claimed to be a Taiwanese resident of Hong Kong, also urged LIHKG-readers to get VPNs before midnight. In a reference to the face mask ban, data.guy wrote, \u201cThe emergency laws will also be effective after midnight, and it\u2019s really hard to say whether the internet will be disturbed.\u201d\n\nThis is not the first time Hong Kong has had such fears. In late August, the Hong Kong Information Technology Federation, a trade organization whose members include Microsoft and IBM, issued a strongly-worded statement to voice its concerns. It was in response to a statement from Lam that left open the possibility the government would use emergency powers to quell the protests. The trade body said, \u201cAny such restrictions, however slight originally, would start the end of the open internet of Hong Kong, and would immediately and permanently deter international businesses from positing their businesses and investments in Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nSign up for the Quartz Daily Brief, our free daily newsletter with the world\u2019s most important and interesting news.\n\nMore stories from Quartz:", "description": "As soon as the ban on face masks was announced, posts urging people to download virtual private networks started to trend.", "authors": ["Jane Li"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/_RdYdFvVvBY24uQlzLBS_g--~B/aD01NzU7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/quartz.com/11768643bcb608444c01210ce45f5aed", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
