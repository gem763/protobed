Yes, of course, but I\u2019m in no rush.\n\n\u201cI understand that I\u2019ve got to continue to build and gain valuable experience, lead a really successful and professional program here that allows us to have consistent success over a long period of time.\u201d\n\nRugby Australia said last week it had already drawn up a target list of coaches and hoped to name Cheika\u2019s successor by Christmas.\n\nGlasgow Warriors coach Dave Rennie, once regarded a potential All Blacks coach in his native New Zealand, is favoured by Australian media to take over the Wallabies.\n\nAnd while Rennie has confirmed his interest in the job he has told British media he would not leave the Warriors until seeing out the domestic season in June.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s important to me,\u201d he said in quotes published by the BBC. \u201cI\u2019ve committed to Warriors and I won\u2019t leave earlier.\u201d\n\nEngland\u2019s run to the final in Japan has seen a parade of former players and pundits urge Rugby Australia to pull out all the stops to lure the team\u2019s Australian coach Eddie Jones home.\n\nJones, who guided Australia to the final of the 2003 World Cup, is contracted to coach England through to 2021.\n\nMcKellar gave Jones a ringing endorsement, saying he was impressed by England\u2019s \u201coutstanding coaching set-up\u201d when he was invited to visit their training base at Pennyhill Park last year.\n\n\u201cYou talk about dotting the I\u2019s and crossing the T\u2019s, well, from what I witnessed, he does it about 25 times, over and over and over,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt is clear he has an incredible work ethic and leaves no stone unturned.\u201d", "description": "ACT Brumbies coach Dan McKellar has ruled himself out of the running to replace Michael Cheika as coach of Australia, saying he is not ready to step up to test level.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
