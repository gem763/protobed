Photo: Vulture and YouTube\n\nYesterday, the news dropped that many late-night shows have been training for: Following a scandal involving a whistle-blower claiming that Trump tried to extort Ukraine to get dirt on Joe Biden\u2019s son, Nancy Pelosi announced that formal impeachment proceedings are in the works against the president. It\u2019s huge news for the country, and huge news for late-night hosts\u2019 punchlines. So how did the hosts react? Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Kimmel, Seth Meyers, Jimmy Fallon, Trevor Noah, Conan O\u2019Brien, and James Corden all had something to say about it, so we\u2019ve rounded them all up for you in one easy place.\n\nThe Late Show With Stephen Colbert\n\nStephen Colbert dove right into the story for his opening monologue on The Late Show: \u201cLordy, what a day. You really feel the ground shifting under your feet. But if you\u2019re at home and you\u2019ve got a seatbelt on your couch, number one: Why? Number two: Buckle up.\u201d After running through a list of all the terrible things Trump has done before the Ukraine scandal broke, Colbert said, \u201cEvery time, people have asked \u2018Is this the thing? Surely this must be the thing.\u2019 And every time, it wasn\u2019t the thing. But here\u2019s the thing: There\u2019s a new thing, and it might be the thing.\u201d Rolling the clip of Pelosi\u2019s announcement prompted a standing ovation and huge cheers from Colbert\u2019s audience, to which Colbert replied, \u201cOkay, but how do you feel?\u201d\n\nLate Night With Seth Meyers\n\nPelosi\u2019s announcement came late in the day yesterday, which is probably why Meyers\u2019s coverage was just a quick joke during a longer news segment. \u201cSpeaker Nancy Pelosi announced this evening that Democrats will open a formal impeachment inquiry against President Trump. I had my doubts in the past, but I think this time, she\u2019s serious,\u201d Meyers said, cutting to a graphic of Pelosi wearing Braveheart face paint. Presumably, tonight\u2019s \u201cA Closer Look\u201d will be a little more in-depth.\n\nJimmy Kimmel Live\n\nOn his ABC show, Jimmy Kimmel commented on Pelosi\u2019s decision to finally go ahead with impeachment proceedings after months of refusing to consider it: \u201cShe\u2019s been very reluctant to do this, but once again, Donald Trump is doing what he does best: forcing a woman to do something she didn\u2019t want to do.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Show\n\nOver on The Daily Show, Trevor Noah opened up his impeachment coverage by saying, \u201cAfter two years of avoiding it, Trump may finally face articles of impeachment \u2014 which, believe me, he is not happy about. It\u2019s impeachment, which Trump hates, plus articles, which he hates even more.\u201d While recapping the Ukraine-whistle-blower scandal, Noah commented, \u201cIt\u2019s an abuse of power, it\u2019s extortion, and maybe worst of all, it\u2019s asking a foreign country to meddle in America\u2019s election \u2014 which is the one thing that, if you were Donald Trump, you should stay away from.\u201d\n\nConan\n\nWhile Conan O\u2019Brien doesn\u2019t usually dip into politics too heavily on his TBS show, he still dedicated a joke to yesterday\u2019s big news. In a dig to Sean Spicer, O\u2019Brien said, \u201cWe don\u2019t know who the whistle-blower is yet, but we do know they\u2019ll end up on Dancing With the Stars.\u201d\n\nThe Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon\n\nO\u2019Brien wasn\u2019t the only one to use Dancing With the Stars as an impeachment-joke punchline last night. During his opening monologue, Jimmy Fallon said, \u201cThe whole thing is moving very fast. We found out about the Ukraine scandal last week, the impeachment inquiry is starting this week, which means Trump will be on Dancing With the Stars next week.\u201d O\u2019Brien poked fun at the excitement of MSNBC anchor Rachel Maddow at the end of his segment, while Fallon decided to go after Maddow\u2019s colleague Chris Hayes for some unfortunate Champagne bottle-shaking hand-gesturing.\n\nThe Late Late Show With James Corden\n\nAnd finally, on The Late Late Show, James Corden offered up a snarky reaction to Pelosi\u2019s big announcement. \u201cYou heard Pelosi! Finally the time for talking about impeachment is over. It\u2019s time to inquire about impeachment! This is it, guys! Let the talking stop and the inquiring begin!\u201d he said. \u201cAt this rate, Democrats should have Trump impeached by the last six months of his second term.\u201d He had a similar reaction to the news that 180 House Democrats are now in favor of impeachment: \u201cIt\u2019s like the old saying goes: Work with a foreign government to undermine a democratic election once, shame on you. Do it twice, we are going to inquire about the possibility of doing something this time, maybe, we\u2019ll see, possibly, I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nAs Fallon said, this story is moving very fast, and today the transcript of Trump\u2019s call with the Ukrainian president was released, so expect a second wave of late-night host reactions tonight.", "description": "A roundup of how late-night hosts James Corden, Jimmy Fallon, Jimmy Kimmel, Conan O\u2019Brien, Trevor Noah, Seth Meyers, and Stephen Colbert reacted to the Trump impeachment inquiry news.", "authors": ["Megh Wright"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/25/25-late-night-impeachment.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
