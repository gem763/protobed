Nowell, on the other hand, has not played any rugby at all over the last four months, having also had his appendix removed during the August training camp in Treviso.\n\nElliot Daly continues at full-back with Anthony Watson and Jonny May restored on the wing, while George Ford and Owen Farrell are reunited in the midfield, meaning that Manu Tuilagi once again is named in the No 13 shirt, with Ben Youngs at scrum-half.\n\nJoe Marler starts his third match in a row at loosehead prop, joining Jamie George and Kyle Sinckler in the front row, with Maro Itoje joining Kruis in the second row in an all-Saracens line-up. Billy Vunipola and Tom Curry also start their third consecutive matches, with Sam Underhill returning at openside flanker.\n\nLuke Cowan-Dickie is named on the bench alongside Vunipola with Dan Cole the other front-row cover, with Lawes and Lewis Ludlam the other forwards in the matchday squad. Nowell is joined by Willi Heinz and Henry Slade, who returns from a knee injury suffered in the win over Tonga.\n\nEngland team to face Argentina\n\nElliot Daly; Anthony Watson, Manu Tuilagi, Owen Farrell, Jonny May; George Ford, Ben Youngs; Joe Marler, Jamie George, Kyle Sinckler; Maro Itoje, George Kruis; Tom Curry, Sam Underhill, Billy Vunipola.\n\nReplacements: Luke Cowan-Dickie, Mako Vunipola, Dan Cole, Courtney Lawes, Lewis Ludlam, Willi Heinz, Henry Slade, Jack Nowell.", "description": "Mako Vunipola and Jack Nowell will make their first appearances of the Rugby World Cup, albeit from the replacements\u2019 bench after being named in the England\u00a0matchday squad for Saturday\u2019s clash against Argentina.", "authors": ["Jack De Menezes"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/03/03/mako-vunipola.jpg"}
