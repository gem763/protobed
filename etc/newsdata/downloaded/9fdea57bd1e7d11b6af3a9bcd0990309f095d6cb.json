(Reuters) - Delaware Governor John Carney nominated on Thursday the first African-American to serve on the state\u2019s supreme court and also nominated a current member of the court to take over as chief justice, filling a vacancy due to the retirement of Leo Strine.\n\nTamika Montgomery-Reeves, who was the first African-American vice chancellor or judge on the state\u2019s Court of Chancery, will join the state\u2019s top court if she is confirmed by the state\u2019s senate.\n\nThe Delaware Supreme Court interprets the state\u2019s widely used corporate law and the court\u2019s rulings shape corporate governance and Wall Street dealmaking.\n\nIt hears appeals from the Court of Chancery, which often decides high-profile corporate and shareholder battles like last year\u2019s lawsuit by German healthcare group Fresenius SE to walk away from its $4.8 billion proposed takeover of rival drugmaker Akorn Inc .\n\nA majority of the Fortune 500 companies are chartered in Delaware, in part because of its well-understood corporate law and courts, even though most have no real operations in the state.\n\nDelaware is one of only 13 states that has never had a non-white justice serve on its supreme court, according to a July study by The Brennan Center for Justice. The study used data dating back to 1960.\n\nCarney nominated Collins Seitz, who joined the Delaware Supreme Court as an associate justice in 2015, to become chief justice, filling the position held by the outspoken Strine for the last five years.\n\nSeitz was a corporate litigator and founding member of Delaware-based Seitz Ross Aronstam & Moritz.\n\nMontgomery-Reeves was confirmed to the Court of Chancery in 2016, joining the court from the Wilmington office of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati where she focused on corporate governance and corporate litigation.\n\nBoth nominations will be considered by the Delaware Senate on Nov. 7, according to the governor\u2019s statement.", "description": "Delaware Governor John Carney nominated on Thursday the first African-American to serve on the state's supreme court and also nominated a current member of the court to take over as chief justice, filling a vacancy due to the retirement of Leo Strine.", "authors": ["Tom Hals", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
