She invited two others along, which was fine. We all worked together years ago.\n\nThe birthday gal and I are extremely close, but see the others once a year. I like them both. The woman is cheerful and rather modest. The man is enormously overweight \u2014 a big, popular personality. His joking and teasing can be edgy.\n\nThought of the day I mean, you must take living so seriously That even at 70, for example, you\u2019ll plant olive trees \u2014 And not for your children, either. But because although you fear death you don\u2019t believe it, Because living, I mean, weighs heavier. Nazim Hikmet (Turkish poet 1902\u20131963)\n\nI knew the evening would revolve around his ceaseless conversation. The spotlight is on him. Although he ribbed me gently, I agreed with many of his initial pronouncements.\n\nBut after a round of drinks I realised I wasn\u2019t actually enjoying being around my old talkative friend \u2014 and that maybe I haven\u2019t really done so in quite a long while.\n\nIs it possible to like someone, but not enjoy their company?\n\nNo one else could get a word in. Growing angry, I asked one of the women something about her life. He looked affronted at the interruption. I told him he was dominating the evening (dinner still loomed) and that he was getting on my nerves.\n\nHe announced that he was leaving. The women were shocked. I apologised, blaming tiredness. He said he\u2019d stay but not talk!\n\nI said: \u2018Ignore me, you have every right to speak \u2014 and I love you.\u2019 We hugged and the evening progressed, I acted like I was having fun. I wasn\u2019t. I was furious with myself.\n\nThe next day, both women told me privately they were glad I had spoken to our friend. But I wasn\u2019t glad. I emailed him saying I respect him and felt sorry and hoped we had patched it up. But he never replied.\n\nWhy am I so guilt-ridden? I did apologise. I don\u2019t really want to spend time with this chap after all; once a year is enough.\n\nBut I can\u2019t stand that I hurt him or that he might not like me. He ribs me about being gay and having white hair. (I have never insulted his weight). But his teasing never made me dislike him before. I think about this mistake day and night. What\u2019s wrong with me?\n\nDANIEL\n\nThis week Bel advises a reader who insulted their mate on a night out, and now fears their friendship is over\n\nMost of us know that feeling: you wake at 3.30am, churning your own words round and round in your mind and wishing you could unsay them.\n\nOr seething that you failed to say what was really on your mind. Or wishing you hadn\u2019t sent that awful email \u2014 which is far worse than hasty words. Over and over, you rehearse situations, wishing in vain to change things.\n\nWhat can be done? Nothing. Words once said cannot be unsaid \u2014 and if hurtful will never be forgotten.\n\nOn the other hand, some people go through life never telling the truth or standing up for themselves. That can turn you into a doormat. If a friend was being very rude to others, would you say so? I admit it\u2019s hard \u2014 but sometimes you must be honest.\n\nIt sounds as if you have suppressed irritation with this chap for many years and it just erupted that night. Yes, it would have been better if you\u2019d said nothing, yet the two women agree with you. Perhaps all of you have passively indulged his massive ego for years. It might have been better to talk to him frankly before.\n\nI know it\u2019s hard. Here is another letter, from a lady I\u2019ll call Sue, complaining about the friend she took to an over-60s social group: \u2018I am becoming increasingly annoyed because she constantly interrupts when someone is talking . . . jumps in with her own thoughts . . . it really is constant. Hardly anyone can speak without her interrupting and saying something. I have tried to carry on talking over her, to no avail.\u2019\n\nHer question is: \u2018How can I broach this subject with her without hurting her feelings or falling out with her?\u2019\n\nShe might also echo your thought about not enjoying a friend\u2019s company. (I have exactly the same problem with one of my own chums).\n\nBut there\u2019s a sadness here. Sue\u2019s friend is driving her mad, and probably making all the others want to avoid her company. Yet the most damage she is doing is to herself. People who talk incessantly will probably end up lonely because gradually others will avoid them.\n\nSo perhaps your overweight friend with the sharp sense of humour is actually miserable and isolated. Perhaps he \u2018ribs\u2019 you about being gay and having white hair (really?) because he\u2019s jealous \u2014 and aware that only seeing you once a year must be for a reason. That\u2019s my sympathetic take on the situation.\n\nMy unsympathetic interpretation is that he has an ego as huge as his waistline and no interest at all in anybody else. So he is either deeply hurt or deeply affronted by your blurt of honest irritation.\n\nWhat would have happened if you \u2014 and my other reader Sue \u2014 had sat down with your respective friends years ago and hinted that hogging conversation does them no favours?\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s ever too late to try to explain gently that other people can feel left out by a superb talker who is more confident . . . so, hey, just let them have a go.\n\nPut that way it\u2019s not so critical, you see? Now, if I were you I\u2019d stop blaming yourself for being truthful, try to shrug it off, and hope he recovers in time for next year.\n\nHelp! My toddler is a terrible sleeper\n\nDear Bel,\n\nMy problem is not one of your \u2018usual\u2019 issues but I really am at my wits\u2019 end and exhausted.\n\nThe problem is my 19-month-old toddler still won\u2019t sleep through the night despite me trying everything.\n\nShe was a much-wanted child for me in my mid-30s (her father is not in the picture, but my parents are both involved and supportive), and while I initially struggled with the sleep deprivation bringing her home as a newborn, I fully expected it.\n\nBut nearly two years on nothing has changed. She has never slept through the night since the day she was born. The most I\u2019ve got her to sleep is three hours, once. There is nothing physically wrong with her. I was told I\u2019d just have to put up with it. My GP and health visitor have been rather useless.\n\nMy parents have been wonderful, taking her out in the mornings so I can catch up on sleep then.\n\nOther than this, she\u2019s a happy child \u2014 well adjusted and meeting all her milestones.\n\nBut it\u2019s really affecting me, as I\u2019m permanently exhausted and have had to put off going back to work (which I really wanted to do when she turned 15 months) as I\u2019m in no state.\n\nIt\u2019s getting me down, as I can\u2019t see any light at the end of the tunnel and the thought of another year or more like this is just too depressing to contemplate. Any advice?\n\nANNIE\n\nOh dear, so stressful! The more tired and worried you are, the worse the whole situation will become.\n\nIt\u2019s an exhausting cycle of deprivation because you and your child both desperately need sleep. So many new/newish mothers become emotionally and physically exhausted and need help. Thank goodness you have understanding parents.\n\nYou gave lengthy details about her routines, which I\u2019ve no space for. But I think even one nap at one and a half hours is too long. I\u2019d put her in the cot after lunch for 30 minutes, then wake her and make sure there is plenty of physical play in the afternoon.\n\nI also consider her 8.30pm bedtime too late. She should have a playful bath at 6ish, then stories and a steady quietening down before bed by 7pm.\n\nHave you tried the bedtime routine on BabyTV? It might create a good sleepy habit. Your anxiety also has to be tackled because a baby will always sense it. Try hypnotherapy for calming reassurance of why you wanted this child.\n\nI\u2019d also add (as a mother and grandmother) that you may have to tolerate some crying. Meanwhile, here are some words from my wise daughter-in-law, Aimee, who has two of her own: \u2018After a calm bedtime you need to put some music on (or white noise) and switch out all lights and have a cuddle. After a few minutes (or less) lie her in her cot and just be there as she is lying down \u2014 no rubbing or patting. If she keeps standing up just lie her down and say a simple phrase like, \u201cIt\u2019s sleepy time\u201d.\n\n\u2018Repeat this every time she stands up. As the nights go on, the process should get shorter until you should be able to walk straight out of the bedroom. I make sure the bedroom is dark and very little light enters the room, even when I leave.\n\n\u2018Do exactly the same process when she wakes up at night as when she went to bed: enter the bedroom, pop the same music/lullaby on, lean in the cot with a reassuring hand \u2014 but do not rub her back to sleep.\n\n\u2018Try to move away while reassuring her you are still there. As she gets more used to it, if she does wake, give her a couple of minutes before going in, as she could just be having a sleepy cry. Don\u2019t speak to her in the night, as this makes a toddler more alert.\u2019\n\nAimee hopes that helps a little \u2014 and so do I.\n\nAnd finally... It's time to dust off your old trainers\n\nDid you hate games and gym? I did. Then all my life I proclaimed that exercise was boring. What an idiot! For in 2005, at the age of 59, I joined a gym and changed the habit of a lifetime. Why? Because I suddenly saw myself as an old biddy puffing and blowing as I walked upstairs \u2014 and it wasn\u2019t a good look.\n\nThat\u2019s why I\u2019m glad to read about the initiative launched by Health and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock.\n\nContact Bel Bel answers readers' questions on emotional and relationship problems each week.

Bel reads all letters but regrets she cannot enter into personal correspondence.\n\nCalled the National Academy for Social Prescribing, it aims to steer patients away from pills and towards activities such as gardening, running, singing, dance, art and so on. At last!\n\nWriting this column leaves me in no doubt that we have an epidemic of inertia, sadness, loneliness and anxiety.\n\nOften readers confess they eat and drink too much \u2014 and then they put weight on, which feeds the cycle of helpless gloom. But it can be defied and defeated. You must believe that.\n\nMatt Hancock wants social prescribing to become a major part of routine GP appointments to stop people being over-medicalised. If you are bereaved, for example, you don\u2019t need a pill to deaden that sorrow, you need to work your way through it, understanding what\u2019s happening \u2014 and do everything to keep yourself active as well.\n\nEasier said than done? Well, of course, but the whole point is that we need to make an effort to help ourselves and realise that doctors (and friends) can help. Even if that means gentle persuasion.\n\nPeople are less active than they were in the Sixties and the resulting health problems put a tremendous strain on the NHS. It doesn\u2019t have to be like that. Yes, we can turn to the NHS for help, but we also have a responsibility to ourselves.\n\nThat\u2019s what I decided in 2005, and now I exercise (Pilates and gym workout) twice a week.\n\nHonestly, I never want to \u2014 but always feel better afterwards. Do it!
