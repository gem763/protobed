According to the Liverpool Echo, his first target was Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain but the midfielder was taken off late in the game and proved elusive.\n\nHughes then asked Milner and Naby Keita before turning to Elliott, who was more than happy to oblige.\n\nHis Dad said: 'Alfie kept saying he hoped the players would come over and I kept saying there might be a struggle because there were a lot of kids where we were sitting.\n\n'He asked if he could go on the pitch and I said yes, as long as he came straight back.\n\n'He was flapping and asking, \"Will I get arrested?\" but I said no it would be different for an adult and he won't do it again. It was a one-off.'\n\nThe youngster was more than happy to pose for pictures with his prized possession after\n\nBack home, Elliott was clearly delighted with his top and dressed in his full Liverpool kit\n\nAfter returning to the stands, Alfie received a huge cheer from the fans in his block.
