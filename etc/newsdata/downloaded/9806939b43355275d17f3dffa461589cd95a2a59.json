Adam Smith of Washington state told an audience in Washington, D.C.\n\nRep. Mike Waltz, a Florida Republican and fellow Armed Services Committee member, concurred. \u201cWe do not have a mutual defense pact with Saudi Arabia,\u201d Waltz told an audience at the centrist think tank New America. Therefore, the Trump administration would need to seek authorization \u201cfor a unilateral American response unless American interests were directly attacked,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Waltz disagreed with the other Democratic representative on the panel, Seth Moulton of Massachusetts, when it came to the effectiveness of the Trump administration\u2019s strategy with regard to Iran. After withdrawing from the nuclear deal with Iran agreed to by the administration of his predecessor, President Barack Obama, Trump has imposed a series of financial sanctions on Iran.\n\nThose sanctions are having an effect, according to Waltz, who said that Iran\u2019s oil exports have fallen \u201cfrom two-and-a-half million barrels per day to ... less than 200,000,\u201d which he described as \u201ca significant blow to the regime.\u201d\n\nThe militias that Iran supports around the Middle East are feeling the pinch, said Waltz. \u201cHamas, Hezbollah, the Shi\u2019a proxies in Iraq are having a hard time making payroll,\u201d he said. \u201cSo my message to the president is, \u2018Mr. President, keep up the pressure campaign, it is working.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut Moulton argued forcefully that Trump\u2019s approach was backfiring. Pulling out of the nuclear deal has not deterred the Iranians from seeking to develop a nuclear weapon, he said. \u201cIn fact, they\u2019ve been put into a corner where they\u2019ve said this is the only thing we can do now,\u201d said Moulton, who is also on the Armed Services Committee.\n\nMoulton, who served four tours in Iraq as a Marine Corps officer, also argued that Trump\u2019s policies have failed to alter Iran\u2019s behavior in the region. It \u201chas gotten worse,\u201d he said. \u201cThey did not attack any Americans when they were under the deal. Now they\u2019re back to the situation we were [in] several years ago when I was in Iraq, where they are attacking Americans, killing our allies.\u201d\n\nThe Nahr Bin Umar oil field near Basra, Iraq.

But while the administration\u2019s policies might force Iran\u2019s current government from office, he said, it is unlikely to result in an Iranian regime more palatable to the United States. \u201cWe\u2019re more than likely going to get a worse, a more adversarial regime, because those are exactly the constituencies in Iran we\u2019re empowering,\u201d he said.\n\nWaltz predicted that gaining relief from the sanctions is the Iranians\u2019 \u201cstrategic goal,\u201d and that they would continue to escalate the confrontation in the Gulf \u201cuntil stopped.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. government has not confirmed that the Sept. 14 drone and missile attacks on the Saudi oil facilities originated in Iran, which has denied responsibility. Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels, which Iran supports, have said they carried out the attack, but there is widespread skepticism that the Houthis have the expertise to conduct such sophisticated attacks alone.\n\nThat ambiguity is just what Iran aims for, according to Waltz. \u201cThis is where the Iranians are so clever,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is right out of their playbook in terms of escalating and having a strategic effect and causing an international crisis, but just under the level to where it elicits an absolute U.S. response.\u201d Noting that the attacks neither hit any U.S. targets nor caused \u201cmassive casualties,\u201d Waltz said the strikes represented \u201ca brilliant move on their part because they knew in the West that we would be having this debate rather than eliciting a response.\u201d", "description": "Despite Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\u2019s declaration Wednesday that the weekend attacks on Saudi oil facilities represent \u201can act of war\u201d by the regime in Tehran, the appetite in Washington for a military conflict with Iran appears limited.", "authors": ["Sean D.
