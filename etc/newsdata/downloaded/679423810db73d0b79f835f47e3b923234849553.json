She launched the inquiry in response to a whistleblower complaint revealing that in a July phone call with Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump pressured Ukraine to dig up dirt to potentially harm 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden.\n\nPelosi added that she believes Barr is \u201cgoing for the cover-up of the cover-up.\u201d\n\nThere are a lot of questions about Barr\u2019s involvement in the whistleblower\u2019s complaint, released Thursday morning. In the complaint, the whistleblower alleges that Barr \u201cappears to be involved.\u201d According to the White House\u2019s summary of the call, Trump told Zelensky to contact Barr about the investigation into Biden and his son Hunter, who had business dealings in Ukraine, and \u201cget to the bottom of it.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, a DOJ spokesperson denied that Barr spoke to Trump \u201cabout having Ukraine investigate anything relating to former Vice President Biden or his son.\u201d\n\nThe DOJ also revealed that it had decided not to pursue an investigation into whether Trump violated campaign finance laws by asking Zelensky to investigate Biden.\n\nAdditionally, it released an Office of Legal Counsel memo, which argued that the whistleblower\u2019s complaint was not an \u201curgent concern\u201d and didn\u2019t need to be disclosed to congressional committees because it didn\u2019t pertain to \u201cthe funding, administration, or operation of an intelligence activity.\u201d\n\nYet, the whistleblower wrote that on several occasions, including the Ukraine call, White House officials may have hidden transcripts of Trump\u2019s conversations into a \u201ccodeword-level system.\u201d The practice is meant for protecting \u201cnational security sensitive\u201d information, but the whistleblower said Trump officials were abusing it by using the system for \u201cpolitically sensitive\u201d conversations.\n\nBarr\u2019s handling of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Trump\u2019s ties with Russia also raised serious questions about whether he has solely been protecting Trump, rather than serving the country.\n\nOn Friday, Pelosi \u2014 who had been reluctant to pursue impeachment proceedings, drawing ire from other congressional Democrats \u2014 also explained what changed in her thinking. Chiefly, she said, this was now an issue of national security.\n\n\u201cI never thought he was worth it to have something so divisive to the country,\u201d she said, referring to Trump. What changed, she said, was the president\u2019s \u201ccavalier attitude,\u201d adding that what he did was \u201cillegal, practically.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is no cause for any joy. This is a sad time for our country,\u201d she said, citing the \u201cseriousness\u201d of Congress\u2019 power to impeach.\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nKey Takeaways From The Whistleblower Complaint On Trump's Ukraine Call\n\nWhite House Hid 'Politically Sensitive' Trump Calls, Suggesting Top-Down Cover-Up: Whistleblower\n\n9 Unanswered Questions In The Whistleblower Complaint\n\nAlso on HuffPost\n\nLove HuffPost?
