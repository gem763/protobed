Hair removal is not only an extremely personal experience, it can also be a real chore.\n\nAnd when summer rolls around, the frequency required to keep those legs looking silky smooth goes up. Yet we continue to commit to the routine because, let's be honest, we all want to feel good and sometimes that means removing hair.\n\nSo what if we told you there is a new product on the block making hair removal not only pain free, but actually a little indulgent too? Rejoice!\n\n3-in-1: The new Nair Leg Mask exfoliates, smoothes and moisturises all in one, while removing unwanted hair and stubble\n\nNair has released its new Leg Mask, a 3-in-1 treatment that gently removes unwanted hair and minimises regrowth. Made with 100% natural clay and seaweed to draw out dirt and oils in the skin and exfoliate dead skin cells, it will leave you feeling smooth, soft and totally fabulous.\n\nThe mask easily removes stubble, and the extended time between treatments means you can spend more time at the beach and less time prepping in the bathroom (or beauty salon).\n\nSo slather up those stems! Here's why you need this game changing product in your life...\n\nMade with 100% natural clay and seaweed, the Nair Leg Mask will draw out dirt, oil and impurities from the skin for a brighter complexion\n\n1. Dermatologist tested, paraben and phthalate free\n\nIt can be difficult to know whether the products you're buying are actually going to work.\n\nThat's why the Nair team went to the trouble of having Leg Mask tested by the professionals, and frankly, we're thanking them for it. This means you can rest easy knowing your hard earned moolah is being spent on something that won't end up forgotten at the back of the bathroom drawer!\n\nDermatologist tested, Nair have ensured the Leg Mask is designed to get real results for real people\n\n2. Individual and personalised\n\nA 'one size fits all' approach has not been taken here. Hair removal is an individual process and because of this, the Nair Leg Mask will suit your specific needs.\n\nThe Clay & Seaweed Exfoliate & Smooth Leg Mask glides on like a dream and won't leave you feeling as though you've smothered on a thick layer of cream.\n\nDesigned to remove hair and stubble, as well as being tailored to normal, dry or sensitive skin, you'll get the exfoliation you want as well as a moisturising and nourishing effect.\n\nBeautiful legs for longer: Add the Nair Leg Mask to your hair removal routine to extend the life of your silky smooth legs and minimise regrowth\n\n3. It actually works\n\nNothing beats a tried and tested review by a real person to make you confident in your shopping decisions - or perhaps we just like having someone else do the ground work so we don't have to? Either way, real people are enjoying real results.\n\nKelsey Castanon, Beauty Editor of Popsugar tested Nair Leg Mask, and the first thing she noticed was the 'soft floral scent'.\n\nShe also said her 'legs felt smoother than ever. Not only did it effectively remove every stubble of leg hair, the formula was surprisingly hydrating - I didn't even need a lotion'.\n\nOkay, we're sold!\n\nBe carefree at the beach this summer with real results results from the Nair Leg Mask and say goodbye to unwanted hair and stubble\n\n4. It feels like a day spa in your own home\n\nRarely does at-home hair removal feel indulgent, but Nair's Leg Mask will have you feeling pampered and as though you have stepped into a luxury day spa.\n\nThe fact the mask takes up to 10 minutes to work means you're forced to sit down, take a break, grab a cup of tea, a bickie and just... relax. And when has a bit of TLC ever been a bad thing?\n\nSo before you start, make sure you have a magazine handy, light a scented candle, get comfortable and turn your phone to do not disturb. We insist!\n\nHair removal is not only enjoyable with Nair but it also feels indulgent - it's like a day spa in your own home\n\n5. It's easy to use\n\nThe directions on the package may seem strict, but if there's one thing we love it's clear communication.\n\nAll you have to do is smooth onto the desired area, wait five to 10 minutes based on the thickness of the hair, use a damp cloth to wipe off the mask, give it a rinse and presto! You're done.\n\nHot tip: Don't skip the wash cloth step as the mask comes off best this way. Your legs will thank you when they're baby soft and glowing, plus you won't have as much post-pamper clean up.\n\nTaking from 5-10 minutes, just smooth on the Leg Mask, relax, wipe it off with a damp cloth and rinse your legs - easy!\n\n6. Extending regrowth time\n\nWe can all agree we'd rather spend our time doing things other than removing unwanted hair. And even once the task is done, we're already thinking about the next time we need to do it (like booking your next appointment before you've left the salon).\n\nBy removing the hairs below the surface of the skin, unlike razors which cut off the hair at skin level, the Nair Leg Mask extends regrowth time.\n\nPlus, you won't be left with those red, irritated spots you can sometimes get after shaving.\n\nDance into summer knowing your hair removal is under control because the Nair Leg Mask targets the hair below the skin surface, extending the regrowth period\n\nThe Nair Leg Mask has flipped hair removal on its head and earned a place in our hair removal routines for summer 2020 and beyond. Keep a couple of tubes handy for your next at-home spa night - we certainly will be!\n\nSilky, soft and lusciously supple Whether you're looking to give your legs deep exfoliation or a healthy summer glow, there is no product better than the new Nair Leg Mask! Perfect for extending your hair removal treatments, it's the ultimate pain-free indulgence with the luxury of an at-home application. Try the Nair Leg Mask for a cool $15 and you'll be silky smooth in no time.\n\n\n\n", "description": "SPONSORED", "authors": ["Alice Piper For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/00/19418186-0-image-a-9_1570489735074.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
