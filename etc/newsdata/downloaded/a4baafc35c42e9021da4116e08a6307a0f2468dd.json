This has meant both the ability to focus on sectors and startups he and his partner see as promising, plus establishing their own culture and policies.\n\n\"It was a means to an end to get capital to certain people,\" says Arlan Hamilton of her decision to form Backstage Capital.\n\n\"The cost to start a fund has come way down,\" Precursor Ventures founder Charles Hudson says. \"Now if you can raise $10 million, you could be a full-time VC \u2013 you won't make a ton of money but you can do it.\"\n\nConventional wisdom: Most still agree that venture capital remains an apprenticeship business, so learning the ropes \u2013 and building out personal networks \u2013 by working at an established firm is still valuable (and, to some, even necessary).\n\nBut: Getting into and moving up the ladder at existing funds remains particularly challenging for women and people of color. Firms still use signals like alma maters and experience at particular organizations when making hiring decisions, as former Venrock vice president Richard Kerby has written. It becomes circular, and exclusionary.\n\nGetting into and moving up the ladder at existing funds remains particularly challenging for women and people of color. Firms still use signals like alma maters and experience at particular organizations when making hiring decisions, as former Venrock vice president Richard Kerby has written. It becomes circular, and exclusionary. The gap between underrepresented minorities at the junior and senior levels also exposes the venture industry's lack of true commitment to diversity. \"From what I hear from a lot of my friends, they're constantly being passed over,\" says Unshackled Ventures associate Maria Salamanca.\n\nMissing conversation: As is the case in the broader tech industry, there's a lack of focus on how various underrepresented demographics overlap, multiple women of color in VC tell Axios. \"Even within the underrepresented set, women have it more difficult than men in general,\" says Arlan Hamilton, adding that she's focusing more and more of her investment into companies led by women of color.\n\nWomen only make up on 7% of decision makers at VC firms, according to data Axios recently compiled. One caveat is that this data only included funds that had raised at least $100 million, while the recent boom in small, seed-stage funds has created more opportunities for venture's underrepresented demographics. For example, 21% of all micro-VC funds raised in the past three years were founded by women, according to Crunchbase.\n\nFollow the money: Michael Kim is the founder of Cendana Capital, which invests in other venture capital funds. He says that the racial and gender demographics of startups are changing, and that it's imperative for VC firms to keep up. \"VC firms have to be able to work with [minority and women-led startups] and have them part of their networks,\" he explains. \"So if traditional funds aren't attracting the best startups, then LPs have to ask what are the funds not doing.\"\n\nGo deeper:", "description": "Many black and Latino venture capitalists are launching their own funds.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/wtApVN7OVewLB5EeSaofb81QNcI=/1920x1080/smart/2017/12/15/1513306334362.jpg", "published_at": "2017-12-15"}
