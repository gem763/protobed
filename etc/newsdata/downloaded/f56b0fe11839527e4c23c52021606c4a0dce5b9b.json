The tune might be catchy, but let's maybe not promote that sort of an idea.\"\n\nMeanwhile, criticism of the song drew backlash from some, with actor Dennis Quaid saying it was \"going a little far\" to call it problematic, and Dean Martin's daughter, Deena, saying she \"was absolutely flabbergasted\" that critics wanted the number scrapped.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe song will be featured on Legend's forthcoming expanded version of \"A Legendary Christmas: The Deluxe Edition,\" which will drop on Nov. 8. Clarkson featured the traditional version of the song on her Christmas album \"Wrapped in Red\" in 2013.", "description": "\"The Voice\" coaches Kelly Clarkson and John Legend are collaborating on a classic Christmas tune -- with a twist.", "authors": ["Nate Day"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-Clarkson-Legend.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
