After the match, Pochettino did not hold back with his criticism.\n\n\u201cI feel very disappointed,\u201d the manager said. \u201cIn the first half, I wasn\u2019t happy with the performance. From the beginning we had a plan, and we didn\u2019t respect the plan. That\u2019s what disappointed me the most. I told them at half-time. We scored two good goals but if you analyse the performance only, it wasn\u2019t great.\n\n\u201cWe conceded a lot of chances and the way we conceded the first goal was so painful. We didn\u2019t translate from Saturday [in the 4-0 home win over Crystal Palace] the aggressivity that is needed in these games. We were a little bit better in the second half, but conceded a very soft penalty.\u201d\n\nPochettino was asked about the similarities to the Arsenal game. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to explain. When we don\u2019t show the intensity that the competition demands, we struggle. We are not talking about the quality of players. We are talking about focus, concentration, anticipation. How many times did we anticipate the action? How many times were we not productive like we were against Palace?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about tactics or quality players but the level of fight. You need to match the opponent in aggressivity, excitement, motivation. That is the first demand \u2013 you need to work. It\u2019s not only the responsibility of one person; it\u2019s everyone\u2019s responsibility.\n\n\u201cIt is not possible how we started tonight and it is a massive difference to Saturday. It\u2019s a massive disappointment. We can talk about scoring twice and playing better second half, but this season we are conceding a lot of chances and a lot of goals. We need to change that. The only way is to be more demanding. Training needs to be harder. Psychologically harder.\u201d", "description": "Mauricio Pochettino accused his Tottenham players of lacking fight in the 2-2 Champions League draw at Olympiakos and suggested that they needed to work harder on the psychological side of their game", "authors": ["David Hytner"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/975910bbad0ea86c1e2f116271b17103b08832b3/581_0_1003_602/master/1003.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=734ec2df2fd4fee68ec474cff386900a", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
