Not Quite, As Bose Discontinues Its $379 Sleepbuds", "language": "en", "text": "It\u2019s lights out for the Sleepbuds (Photo: Patrick Lucas Austin, Gizmodo)\n\nAfter just over a year on the market, Bose has now discontinued its $379 Sleepbuds, citing issues with the product\u2019s built-in batteries and faulty charging.\n\nBefore discontinuing the Sleepbuds, Bose attempted to address user complaints through a series of software and firmware updates. However, when issues persisted, Bose finally made the decision to discontinue the Sleepbuds, with a notice on Bose\u2019s website from general manager John Roselli saying \u201cthat while the battery we chose functions safely, it doesn\u2019t work as consistently or predictably as it should to meet our standards.\u201d\n\nThankfully, for any Sleepbuds owners currently plagued by a faulty device, Bose will continue to honour the product\u2019s warranty while also allowing customers to return the product for a full refund until December 31, 2019.\n\nThis move by Bose is somewhat disappointing, as Gizmodo reviewed the Sleepbuds at launch and praised them for making it easier to fall asleep without disturbing a partner with gadgets like a white noise speaker.\n\nThat said, between its clunky controls, not having a real Bluetooth connection and being limited to just a handful of white noise sounds (instead of music or other audio sources), the resulting product had limited appeal. And that\u2019s before you factor in the Sleepbuds\u2019 $379 price tag.\n\nWhile it\u2019s unclear when Bose might release a new version of the Sleepbuds with better charging and updated features, it seems the idea of sleep-friendly earbuds isn\u2019t totally dead yet, as Bose says \u201cWe\u2019ll go back to research, because we are committed to making our vision a reality.\u201d\n\nBut for now, it\u2019s time for the Sleepbuds to say goodnight.", "description": "After just over a year on the market, Bose has now discontinued its $379 Sleepbuds, citing issues with the product\u2019s built-in batteries and faulty charging....", "authors": ["Kyle Mizokami", "Adam Clark Estes"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/h2sdqjeb3uqrgy4ua5vo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
