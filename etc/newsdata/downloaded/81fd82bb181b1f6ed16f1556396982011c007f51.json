You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\n\u201cIn addition to fast charging, this design allows us to limit the battery\u2019s exposure time to the elevated charge temperature, thus generating a very long cycle life,\u201d said senior author Chao-Yang Wang, a mechanical engineer at Penn State University.\n\n\u201cThe key is to realise rapid heating; otherwise, the battery will stay at elevated temperatures for too long, causing severe degradation... The 10-minute trend is for the future and is essential for adoption of electric vehicles because it solves the range anxiety problem.\"\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Typical lithium-ion batteries would only last around 60 charges using the new method.\n\nThe discovery comes just weeks after the inventors of the first lithium-ion battery were awarded the 2019 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.\n\nThe combined work of John Goodenough, Stanley Whittingham and Akira Yoshino led to the first commercially viable lithium-ion battery being produced in 1985. They are now used in everything from mobile phones to laptops, as well as the rapidly growing electric vehicle industry.\n\nThe researchers now hope to improve this charge time to just five minutes.\n\n\u201cWe are working to charge an energy-dense electric vehicle battery in five minutes without damaging it,\u201d Mr Wang said.\n\n\u201cThis will require highly stable electrolytes and active materials in addition to the self-heating structure we have invented.\u201d", "description": "Engineers have discovered a way to recharge electric cars in just 10 minutes, overcoming\u00a0one of the biggest obstacles with electric vehicles.
