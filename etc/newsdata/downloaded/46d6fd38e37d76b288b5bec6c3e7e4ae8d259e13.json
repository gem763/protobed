(AP) - Rebecca Fisher never expected her first video on TikTok, a mobile-only video-sharing app, to go viral.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to post anything (on the app), but then I saw (Pennsylvania) was trending,\u201d the 14-year-old Amish girl said.\n\nHer first video, which featured Fisher educating viewers on how to properly pronounce Lancaster (read: LANG-kiss-ter not Lang-KAS-ter) has racked up over 430,000 views since being posted in early July.\n\nIt has received more than 22,000 \u201clikes,\u201d plus more than 1,300 comments and 1,600 shares.\n\nSince this first video, Fisher has posted at least 21 other 15-second videos to her account, @AmishBek, raking in over 1 million views, 38,800 likes and over 12,200 followers, as of the deadline for this story.\n\nFisher\u2019s videos are unapologetically Amish.\n\nIn one of her videos, she speaks in Pennsylvania Dutch. In another, she records her backyard - barn in view - as rain pours down. One video begins with Fisher stating \u201cI am absolutely not Mormon\u201d in response to the many comments questioning her faith. She goes on to say she is \u201cabsolutely Amish.\u201d Then, she furrows her brows.\n\n\u201cWell, not exactly,\u201d she adds.\n\nFisher\u2019s parents, Aaron and Barbie, left the Amish church Rebecca was 3 years old. The family says it holds all the Amish values and dresses in the traditional outfits.\n\n\u201cWe consider ourselves Amish,\u201d Fisher says in the video. \u201cI\u2019m still Amish. I still have Amish blood.\u201d\n\nCOMMENTERS QUESTIONING HER FAITH\n\nSince her first video, Fisher has collected over 1,000 comments, many of them questioning her upbringing or attempting to explain why the young Amish girl is on the app.\n\nFisher said she often feels like she\u2019s stuck between worlds: the Amish shun her and the \u201cEnglish\u201d gawk. And now, with the onslaught of comments, her identity is being debated on a much larger scale.\n\n\u201cNo hate, but Amish are not allowed to have phones,\u201d commented one person.\n\n\u201cGuys, the Amish go through a period where they can have modern day things \u2026\u201d commented another.\n\nAnother person attempted to explain Fisher\u2019s faith, \u201cYou must be Mennonite or River Brethren to have that phone.\u201d\n\nFisher stands firm in her identity as an Amish girl.\n\nShe said she doesn\u2019t respond to the messages that are \u201ctelling me what I am and what I\u2019m not,\u201d as they aren\u2019t worth the energy.\n\nThe juxtaposition of a young Amish girl on TikTok draws interest - and views. A video featuring Fisher pulling her dark hair back into a bun received 135,100 views; a dark and blurry video of Fisher\u2019s friends playing near a campfire only received 11,600.\n\nFisher said she has realized which videos draw in a larger crowd and has plans to take full advantage of that as she continues to make videos.\n\nYOUTUBE ASPIRATIONS\n\nWhile Fisher appreciates the attention she\u2019s received on TikTok, she would have preferred to receive more views on her YouTube channel.\n\nAt the beginning of July, Fisher bought a smartphone with the intention of filming daily \u201cvlogs\u201d - or video logs - of her day to post on YouTube.\n\nIt\u2019s something she\u2019s wanted to do for years, her father said.\n\nWhen she\u2019s not watching YouTube channels \u201cJack and Gab\u201d and \u201cJess and Gabriel,\u201d Fisher reads up on what makes a successful YouTube account and takes down notes.\n\n\u201cYou want your viewers to be able to trust you, that you\u2019re not going to put out clickbait that you\u2019re not gonna put out a stupid video just to get more views,\u201d Fisher said.\n\nSo far, she has only posted two videos: \u201cMy Story\u201d and \u201cAm I Amish.\u201d\n\nIn both, she talks about the struggle of living in between the Amish and the English.\n\nThe videos have collected just over 1,000 views.\n\nShe also mentions her family\u2019s food bank distribution center, Blessings of Hope, and how viewers can help the nonprofit.\n\nFAMILY SUPPORT\n\nFisher\u2019s parents see her interest in pursuing YouTube and TikTok as a positive thing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about reaching out and being a blessing,\u201d said Fisher\u2019s father, Aaron.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what Fisher tries to do in her videos: be a blessing.\n\n\u201cI like to hide messages in my videos - not bluntly say something, but just kind of hide it in there so (viewers) still get the message,\u201d she said.\n\nIt might seem as if Fisher is pushing against her Amish heritage by embracing technology. But the Amish don\u2019t necessarily reject technology - instead, emerging technologies are evaluated by whether they can be adapted to fit the Amish values, said Charles Jantzi, professor of psychology at Messiah College and researcher of Amish adolescents and social media.\n\nFisher and her father see community outreach as a core value of their faith and she\u2019s found a unique way to adapt YouTube and TikTok to fit that value.\n\n\u201cAmish have to think outside of the box to be inside of their box,\u201d Fisher said.\n\n___\n\nOnline:\n\nhttps://bit.ly/2ml0ZQj\n\n___\n\nInformation from: LNP, http://lancasteronline.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Rebecca Fisher never expected her first video on TikTok, a mobile-only video-sharing app, to go viral.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Abigail King"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
