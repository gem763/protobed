Of those, 1,808 faced wage garnishment or offsets from their tax refunds, and 847 saw their credit scores negatively impacted. The borrowers have since been reimbursed, according to the department.\n\nKim wrote that \u201cthe evidence shows\u201d the department made \u201conly minimal efforts to comply with the preliminary injunction.\u201d\n\nThe judge had ordered DeVos\u2019 Education Department to stop collecting on the loans in May 2018. After discovering her order had not been followed, Kim issued a sharp rebuke of the department earlier this month.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sending anyone to jail yet, but it\u2019s good to know I have that ability,\u201d the judge said at the time, Politico reported.\n\nIt is extremely rare for a court to hold a Cabinet secretary in contempt of court, and DeVos is facing fresh calls for her resignation over the issue.\n\nBecause DeVos is named in the lawsuit in her official capacity as education secretary, the billionaire school-choice activist will not be personally responsible for paying the fine. The $100,000 will go toward debt relief promised to former students of Corinthian Colleges, who former President Barack Obama\u2019s administration found were defrauded by the company.\n\nCorinthian Colleges, which closed in 2015, was found to have inflated job-placement rates of graduates by counting students who were employed prior to enrollment as successfully placed, and by paying temporary employment agencies to hire graduates.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re disappointed in the court\u2019s ruling,\u201d the Education Department said in a tweet. \u201cWe acknowledged that servicers made unacceptable mistakes.\u201d\n\nWe're disappointed in the court's ruling. We acknowledged that servicers made unacceptable mistakes. @BetsyDeVosED directed @FAFSA to take immediate action to help every impacted borrower. As of today, @FAFSA has taken the actions needed to make every impacted borrower whole. pic.twitter.com/10kgh63bhH \u2014 U.S. Department of Education (@usedgov) October 25, 2019", "description": "The Education Department improperly tried collecting on loans to former students defrauded by the defunct for-profit chain Corinthian Colleges.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5db30715200000cc27506cac.jpeg?cache=lnltb0o2qg&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
