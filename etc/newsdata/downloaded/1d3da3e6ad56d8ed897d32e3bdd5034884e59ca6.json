(Tommaso Boddi/Getty Images)\n\nTORONTO \u2014 Since it launched its film operation about four years ago, Amazon has sought to convince the film industry that it\u2019s a traditional studio intent on following a typical release playbook.\n\nUnlike Netflix, the company told partners and producers, it would often put movies in theaters for three-month windows before releasing them on its streaming platform, Prime. Amazon Studios did just that with many of its movies, including 2016\u2032s \u201cManchester by the Sea\u201d and 2017\u2032s \u201cThe Big Sick,\" both of which became box office and awards successes.\n\nThe firm even hired Bob Berney \u2014 one of the savviest theatrical-distribution executives in the business, responsible for hits such as \u201cMemento\u201d and \u201cPan\u2019s Labyrinth\u201d \u2014 to run distribution and marketing. The moves delighted traditional agents, producers and theater owners, who saw an ally where Netflix was merely a disrupter.\n\nBut all that appears to be crumbling.\n\nIn a move that has vexed traditional Hollywood, Amazon Studios, under chief Jennifer Salke, appears to be moving toward the model it once defined itself against \u2014 away from a conventional approach involving theaters and television-marketing campaigns to small-screen releases found largely by recommendation.\n\n\u201cA year ago, I would say they were pretty serious about being a theatrical distributor. And now it feels like they\u2019re pulling back from it,\u201d said Bruce Nash, a theatrical-release expert from The Numbers, a box-office information site. (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)\n\nThat was keenly on display at the Toronto International Film Festival last week with Amazon\u2019s big fall movie, Tom Harper\u2019s \u201cThe Aeronauts\u201d \u2014 a story of balloon aviators set in 1860s Britain starring Felicity Jones and Eddie Redmayne and is filled with dramatic computer-generated imagery.\n\nHarper told premiere audiences that he was \u201creally struck by the thirst for adventure and the extreme risk\u201d the characters take. Then he equated them to his backer, saying he wanted \u201cto thank Amazon for their support for this ambitious project.\u201d\n\nAmbition has certainly been true in one respect. Amazon produced \u201cAeronauts,\u201d a rare CGI action-adventure tale not based on branded intellectual property, for an estimated $80 million. It also acquired a trio of movies earlier this year at the Sundance Film Festival \u2014 whistleblower thriller \u201cThe Report\u201d and the female-led comedies \u201cBrittany Runs a Marathon\u201d and \u201cLate Night\u201d \u2014 for a record $41 million (along with another film for $5 million).\n\nBut \u201cAeronauts\u201d will play exclusively in theaters for just two weeks in December before moving to Prime. It is a token release, limited not only by time, but by the fact that many theater chains won\u2019t consider playing a movie that heads so quickly to streaming platforms.\n\nThe move suggests a much more small-screen-centric approach than Amazon has previously taken. That approach has confounded many industry observers, seeming to take hold with a movie most suited to a theatrical release.\n\n\u201cAmazon Studios\u2019 two-week-only exclusive theatrical window slated for December is a curious release strategy for a film whose greatest selling point is the reasonable amount of greenscreen visual wonder it delivers through a pair of enchanting leads,\u201d wrote critic Tomris Laffly for Variety.\n\nThe company went so far as to unwind deals with international theatrical distributors worth more than $20 million so it could put out the movie globally on Prime instead, according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about it. (The film will have a traditional theatrical release in the United Kingdom.)\n\n\u201cThe Report,\u201d which stars Adam Driver as Senate staffer and CIA investigator Daniel Jones, will get similar treatment. Despite being acquired for a whopping $14 million at Sundance (many movies go for no more than $5 million) and a thriller conceit, the film will also play exclusively in theaters for just two weeks and then head to Prime on Nov. 29.\n\nThe company has not said if it would make a bigger theatrical play with Shia LaBeouf\u2019s \u201cHoney Boy\u201d and Kristen Stewart\u2019s \u201cSeberg,\u201d which both played Toronto; each is a far more boutique production than \u201cAeronauts.\u201d\n\nAn Amazon spokeswoman declined to comment for this story. The company has maintained that it is making decisions on a case-by-case basis and is not locked in to one release strategy.\n\nBut many read the latest moves as a clear sign of a Netflixian pivot. \u201cIf they\u2019re not putting out \u2018Aeronauts\u2019 in theaters, I don\u2019t know what movie they\u2019ll put in theaters,\u201d said one film executive at a traditional studio, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid jeopardizing industry relationships.\n\nOne signal to industry executives of the shift: Berney. The executive left the company in June.\n\nAmazon may be feeling theatrically gun-shy after the failures of \u201cLate Night\u201d and \u201cBrittany.\u201d Bought for a combined $27 million, both films flopped in theaters. The Mindy Kaling-led \u201cLate Night\u201d has grossed just $16 million despite a wide release on more than 2,000 screens and a splashy marketing campaign. \u201cBrittany,\u201d meanwhile, has taken in less than $4 million in four weeks of release.\n\nThe company does continue to spend. At Toronto, it was the rare studio to acquire a movie, the Riz Ahmed\u2019-starring \u201cThe Sound of Metal,\u201d a drama about a musician who is losing his hearing. Amazon also threw a glitzy party in a trendy hotel restaurant. \u201cThe Report\u201d was celebrated on one floor, while \u201cThe Aeronauts\u201d was feted on another. VIP tables dotted the walls; at one, Jones ate sushi with friends.\n\nAmazon remains without the need for movie-based subscription revenue. Unlike Netflix, it does not rely heavily on content to attract subscribers; original content is more of a bonus feature for Prime members.\n\nThat, say experts, might actually be a reason the company shouldn\u2019t worry about releasing moves on Prime so quickly. On the other hand, it could mean that executives view all entertainment content as an add-on and don\u2019t really consider theaters in the first place. (Whether any of this is good for consumers is up for debate. Netflix has argued for the benefits of simultaneous availability. But many others have said that without a heavy theatrical component, movies tend to be made with lower budgets and risk getting lost in the streaming swirl.)\n\nBox office can indeed be much more profitable than streaming. Studios typically keep about half of U.S. box office dollars \u2014 unlike streaming, which rarely results in clear revenue contributions.\n\nStill, there is no guarantee of success for a theatrical distributor. And there are plenty of costs.\n\n\u201cDistribution is difficult. You have to spend a lot on marketing. And building those relationships and cobbling together a team is very difficult,\u201d Nash said. \u201cA lot of companies say that they really want to do it and then one day decide to stop releasing movies.\u201d\n\nOr, if they have the option, just putting them on digital platforms.", "description": "Despite hits like Manchester by the Sea and The Big Sick, Amazon appears to be moving away from theatrical releases.", "authors": ["Steven Zeitchik", "Reporter Covering The Business Of Entertainment In The U.S.", "September At Am", "Steven Zeitchik Covers The Business Of Entertainment For The Washington Post", "Examining The Industry'S Trends", "Challenges", "Issues", "Ideas.
