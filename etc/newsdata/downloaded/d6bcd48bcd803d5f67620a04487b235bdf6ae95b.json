The court was misled to the accuracy of the Christopher Steele dossier, that the system had plenty of warnings that it was not reliable, it was biased, and they didn't do a damn thing to look into it, and they never informed the court of the bias in any meaningful way.\u201d\n\nThe 412 pages of redacted FISA documents released in early 2018 show the DOJ and the FBI made extensive use of Steele\u2019s unverified dossier, which he put together in 2016 at the behest of the opposition research firm Fusion GPS, which was hired by Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee by Marc Elias of the Perkins Coie law firm \u2014 who was briefed about Steele's findings throughout the race and, in turn, briefed the Clinton campaign too.\n\nRepublicans allege Steele\u2019s funding from a Democratic presidential campaign and his desire for President Trump to lose the election were concealed by the DOJ and FBI from the FISA court. The FBI continued to rely on Steele's research even after he was cut off as a confidential human source in November 2016 following the discovery that he had been improperly providing information to journalists, according to notes from interviews with Justice Department official Bruce Ohr.\n\n\u201cIf that\u2019s OK with the FISA court, then we need to probably do away with the FISA court,\u201d Graham concluded on Friday.\n\nEarlier this year, Graham told reporters in May he would call up Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts and ask him to investigate possible abuse of the FISA court during and after the 2016 election, noting that Trump is \"down\" on the FISA court.\n\n\u201cWould you please look and see what happened?\u201d Graham said he would ask Roberts. \u201cBecause I don\u2019t want to lose the FISA program.\u201d\n\nAs the chief justice, Roberts supervises and appoints judges to the FISA court.\n\nThe FISA filings required approval from top members of the FBI and the Justice Department, and targets of Horowitz's inquiry likely include the approvers of the four applications and renewals: former FBI Director James Comey; former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates; Dana Boente, the only signatory in active government service and currently Trump\u2019s top lawyer at the FBI; then-FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe; and then-Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who appointed former FBI Director Robert Mueller to be special counsel the month before.\n\nThe FISA court, for its part, approved all four applications and renewals from October 2016 to June 2017, and the four judges involved were appointed by Republicans. Three of the four judges who signed off on the Carter Page surveillance are still on the FISA court.\n\n\u201cIt's my job to make sure our laws work well and the system protects the American people,\u201d Graham said on Friday. \u201cAnd if I am convinced after all this B.S. and the court doesn\u2019t take corrective action, then I\u2019ve lost faith in the court.\u201d\n\nThe initial FISA application was signed in October 2016 by FISA Court Judge Rosemary Collyer, whose signature attested that \u201con the basis of the facts submitted in the verified application, there is probable cause to believe that the Government of the Russian Federation (Russia) is a foreign power and Carter W. Page is an agent of Russia.\u201d\n\nThe FISA warrant authorized the United States government to conduct a wide series of redacted surveillance techniques through January 2017, when the application would need to be renewed. Collyer was appointed to the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia by President George W. Bush in 2003. Collyer joined the FISA court after being selected by Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts in March 2013 and is currently the presiding judge. Her term goes into March 2020.\n\nThe second FISA application was signed in January 2017 by Judge Michael Mosman, who was appointed by President George W. Bush as the chief judge of the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon. Mosman joined the FISA court in May 2013 and will serve on it through May 2020.\n\nThe third FISA application was signed in April 2017 by Judge Anne Conway, who was appointed by President George H.W. Bush as the senior judge of the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida. Conway joined the FISA court in May 2016 and will serve on it through May 2023.\n\nThe fourth and final FISA application was signed in June 2017 by Judge Raymond Dearie, who was appointed by President Ronald Reagan as a federal judge for the Eastern District of New York. Dearie joined the FISA court in July 2012 and served on it until he left the court in July 2019.", "description": "Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham warned the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court that it needs to \u201ctake corrective action\u201d after being \u201cmisled\u201d by the Justice Department and FBI through their use of British ex-spy Christopher Steele\u2019s unverified dossier.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://mediadc.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/da8850e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2290x1202+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmediadc.brightspotcdn.com%2Fee%2F9d%2F7041944f46c1998dfa6f428ab1ff%2Fap18271721985931.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
