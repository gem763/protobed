It also instructed employees to make sure that screens in its electronic departments don't display violence, like hunting videos.\n\nUnder the heading: \"Immediate Action,\" employees were instructed to \"Review your store for any signing or displays that contain violent images or aggressive behavior. Remove from the sales floor or turn off these items immediately.\"\n\n\"We've taken this action out of respect for the incidents of the past week,\" spokeswoman Tara House told The Associated Press on Friday. In a statement to USA Today, she added, \"This action does not reflect a long-term change in our video game assortment.\"\n\nThe shooting in El Paso came days after a Walmart employee shot and killed two other workers in Southaven, Miss., and a day before a gunman killed nine people in Dayton, Ohio.\n\nWalmart does not sell assault-style rifles \u2014 it stopped doing so in 2015. But the company still sells other guns. It is facing pressure to stop selling firearms altogether, and some of that pressure is internal. This past Monday, Thomas Marshall, a California-based corporate employee, sent a mass email to workers calling for a strike until the company decides to stop selling firearms.\n\nIn a Facebook post Tuesday, Walmart chief executive Doug McMillon said Walmart would \"work to understand the many important issues that arise from El Paso and Southaven, as well as those that have been raised in the broader national discussion around gun violence. We will be thoughtful and deliberate in our responses, and we will act in a way that reflects the best values and ideals of our company, with a focus on serving the needs of our customers, associates and communities.\"\n\nThough some politicians have claimed the modern epidemic of mass shootings is tied to increasing violence in video games, there is no known link between violent video games and violent acts.\n\nPatrick Markey, a psychology professor at Villanova University who focuses on video games, has found that men who commit severe acts of violence actually play violent video games less than the average male, according to the Associated Press. About 20% were interested in violent video games, compared with 70% of the general population, he explained in his 2017 book Moral Combat: Why the War on Violent Video Games Is Wrong.\n\nAuthorities believe the El Paso gunman wrote a racist manifesto deploring mass immigration before he opened fire at the Walmart. El Paso police say he drove more than 10 hours to the majority-Latino city to carry out the shooting. He has been charged with capital murder.\n\nThe shootings this week have left many Americans on edge. Reports of an active shooter on Tuesday at a different Walmart in Baton Rouge, La., prompted local law enforcement to rush to the scene, only to find a false alarm.\n\n\"The national climate regarding these incidents has the nation on edge, and citizens' anxiety levels much higher than normal,\" the East Baton Rouge sheriff's department wrote in a statement.\n\nOn Thursday, a 20-year-old man wearing body armor and carrying a loaded rifle \u2014 and more than 100 rounds of ammunition \u2014 was arrested after causing panic at a Walmart store in Springfield, Mo.", "description": "Following shootings at two store locations, Walmart said in an internal memo that it would take down all imagery and stop playing videos that depicted violence.", "authors": ["Susie Neilson"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/08/09/ap_192214879666071_wide-8ccfb8cd8794513dfaaa29c8d0ef87c306beb71a.jpg?s=1400"}
