REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom is expected to sign legislation this week designed to effectively ban private, for-profit corporations from running prisons or immigration detention facilities.\n\nSponsors of the measure say it will end a brief but hapless experiment in privately outsourced incarceration begun as a means to ease overcrowding - an endeavor Newsom branded an outrage when he took office in January.\n\nBill supporters say private prisons, driven to maximize shareholder profits, lack proper oversight or incentives to rehabilitate inmates, and have contributed to a culture of mass incarceration by making it cheaper to lock up people.\n\nThey point to research cited in a 2016 U.S. Justice Department Office of Inspector General report that found private prisons spend less on personnel, and are less safe, than public institutions.\n\n\u201cThis is a total and complete failure, and it\u2019s hurting and abusing Californians,\u201d said state Assemblyman Rob Bonta, a chief author of the bill.\n\nThe facilities at stake are low-security lockups operated by one of two leading U.S. private prison companies, Florida-headquartered GEO Group (GEO.N) or Tennessee-based CoreCivic (CXW.N).\n\nDefending their business model, the companies say they provided a vital service when detentions in California\u2019s prisons more than doubled the system\u2019s capacity, sparking lawsuits that led to court-ordered cuts to inmate populations.\n\n\u201cFor 10 years, we provided safe, secure housing and life-changing re-entry programing for inmates that had faced extreme overcrowding,\u201d CoreCivic spokeswoman Amanda Gilchrist said.\n\nSeparately, GEO Group cited its record as \u201can innovator in the field of rehabilitative services\u201d and said the bill worked against the state\u2019s goal of lowering inmate recidivism.\n\nSIGNIFICANT LOOPHOLES\n\nInmate advocacy groups say the legislation does not go far enough, pointing to what they call significant loopholes, including an exemption for facilities that provide \u201ceducational, vocational, medical or other ancillary services\u201d to inmates.\n\n\u201cI cannot think of any prison that does not provide those services,\u201d said Kara Gotsch, director of strategic initiatives for the Sentencing Project, a criminal justice reform group.\n\nSeveral states, including New York, Illinois and Nevada, have adopted similar bans on private prisons, and nearly half of all states have no such facilities, Gotsch said.\n\nThe bill sets the stage for the three remaining private prisons in California, collectively housing about 1,400 inmates, to close four years from now, when their contracts with the state Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation expire.\n\nPerhaps more significantly, the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency stands to lose four privately-run detention facilities in California next year that hold roughly 4,000 people, unless the ban is challenged in court.\n\nICE has not taken a public position on the bill. But assuming the measure were adopted, detainees would simply be transferred to facilities outside California, the agency said in a statement.\n\nThe impact \u201cwould be felt almost exclusively by residents of California, who would be forced to travel greater distances to visit friends and family in custody,\u201d ICE said.\n\nThe average daily population at issue in those facilities accounts for less than a tenth of the 52,000 ICE holds nationwide, it said.\n\nSMALL FRACTION\n\nThe bill, which secured its final passage by the state legislature last month, bans any new or renewed California contracts with private, for-profit prisons, starting in January.\n\nFour detention facilities privately operated for ICE would be put out of business even sooner, when their contracts with the federal government expire next year, Bonta said.\n\nCalifornia had already been moving in this direction, terminating in June its contact with a privately-run correctional center in Arizona - the last of several such out-of-state facilities - followed by last month\u2019s closure of a 700-bed facility in McFarland, California, near Bakersfield.\n\nThe state\u2019s share of inmates in private facilities is a small fraction of its total prison population of nearly 126,000.\n\nBy comparison, Texas, which became the first state to outsource incarceration to private companies in 1985, had far more inmates than any other state in for-profit facilities in 2017, nearly 13,000, or 7.8 percent of its total, said Gotsch of the Sentencing Project.", "description": "America's largest state prison system is moving to quit the practice of farming out inmates to lockups run under contract by private companies, following a nationwide decline in the for-profit incarceration business.", "authors": ["Steve Gorman", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1439008284&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9823U", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
