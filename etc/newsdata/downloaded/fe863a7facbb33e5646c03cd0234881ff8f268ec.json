According to Billboard, 164,000 of those were from album sales and 4,000 came from streaming.\n\nBreaking down the math, as 1,500 song streams are the equivalent to one sale, that means the album was streamed around 4.9 million times in just one week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOh, the power of streaming.\n\nBut the album release wasn\u2019t as simple as it appears on the surface and it\u2019s all down to those bundle deals that have become prevalent in the music industry to increase album sales.\n\nSuperM released eight different versions, one for each member as well as a \u2018united version\u2019.\n\nDigital copies of the album were included with every sale of merchandise on the SM Entertainment online store, including signed posters and picture disc vinyl.\n\nThey were also included with the purchase of tickets to SuperM\u2019s US arena tour, which went on sale the day after the album release.\n\nPretty great timing.\n\nBut fans weren\u2019t exactly kept in the dark about the bundle deals. In fact, SM Global Shop stated in their Instagram bio that \u2018all orders officially count for the Billboard chart\u2019.\n\nR&B star Summer Walker, who currently holds the number two spot, also used similar sales tactics with her album Over It, by offering discounted merchandise and new t-shirts to fans during the first week of release.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time an artist has been scrutinised for reaching number one thanks to bundles.\n\nNicki Minaj called out Travis Scott in 2018 when his critically-acclaimed album Astroworld beat her own record, Queen, to number one after he sold albums with tour tickets and merchandise.\n\nNicki even accused the rapper of using his baby daughter Stormi to boost record sales.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd who can forget the controversy surrounding DJ Khaled back in June, when Billboard disqualified units that had been sold as part of a bundle with energy drinks?\n\nAt the moment, it seems to be a grey area but it looks like the charts are starting to accept bundle deals after all.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
