REUTERS/Mike Blake\n\nThe lawsuit could have implications for Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot\u2019s plan to raise $40 million in new revenue from ride shares as the city grapples with an $838 million budget hole.\n\nThe case Uber filed in Cook County Circuit Court against the village of Skokie said that while most states do not allow local government taxation of ride sharing services, municipalities in Illinois are imposing their own fees and taxes on the industry.\n\nIn a statement, the company said that while it believes Skokie\u2019s taxes \u201crun against well-established Illinois law,\u201d it hopes to work with Illinois lawmakers on legislation \u201cthat raises revenue in a way that makes sense for the state and the industry.\u201d\n\nAn ordinance Skokie adopted in May imposes a tax on ride shares beginning or terminating in the suburb as compensation for the wear and tear on roads and infrastructure from increased traffic, according to the lawsuit.\n\nUber claimed the tax violates Illinois\u2019 constitution because it imposes \u201can unauthorized occupation tax\u201d that applies outside of Skokie\u2019s jurisdiction, noting that 86% of Uber trips originating or ending there in the first nine months of 2019 crossed the suburb\u2019s borders.\n\nAnn Tennes, Skokie\u2019s communications director, said the village has not been formally notified about the lawsuit and was declining to comment at this time.\n\nLightfoot has proposed raising the city\u2019s tax on single-passenger ride shares to $1.13 per ride from 60 cents, along with imposing a new $1.75 surcharge on weekday rides beginning or ending in a designated downtown area to combat traffic congestion. The city also collects accessibility and administrative fees totaling 12 cents per trip.\n\nUber has opposed the move, saying it would lead to the nation\u2019s highest ride sharing fee. But national comparisons are hard to make. Some cities and states collect a percentage of the total fare, according to the Eno Center for Transportation, a think tank.\n\nLyft Inc, Uber\u2019s rival, said the proposal \u201cshows a total misunderstanding of what causes congestion and how Chicagoans are moving around the city.\u201d", "description": "Uber Technologies Inc on Wednesday sued a Chicago suburb over a new ride share tax, while calling on Illinois lawmakers to address the state's \"emerging patchwork\" of taxation.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446682410&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9T1X6", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
