I called my mom and I was telling my friends about it because I couldn't really believe it,\" Darcy told Honey.nine.\n\n(Image: Facebook)\n\nShe found support in the form of her mum Melissa, who posed on Facebook to express how upset she was.\n\nDarcy had actually gone to the shops with the intention of buying a dress.\n\nThe plan didn't come off however, because she could not find anything she liked.\n\nShe instead opted for a jumpsuit she already had in her wardrobe.\n\nWhen asked by the online publication about the decision to bar Darcy, a spokesperson for the school said 390 students had bought tickets to the event but only one was blocked from entering.\n\nThey said the schoolgirl had been given the chance to return in a dress, which she had declined to do.\n\n(Image: Facebook)\n\nDespite the fact Darcy has had her ticket refunded, Melissa feels justice has not been done.\n\n\"This is my daughter's senior year and to see her get rejected and denied entrance to a dance that she could have went to any semi-formal event in the area and walked right in and no one would have batted an eye,\" she said\n\n\"She was dressed up and was appropriate so that's frustrating because this is like a memory now, you know.\"", "description": "Darcy Krueger was denied entry to The Tampa Bay Homeschool Homecoming in Florida", "authors": ["Milo Boyd", "Image", "Facebook"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20470351.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_THP_CHPP_051019Slug_2388JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
