Because the ball is far away, the player is full sprint to bring him down without the ball around, for me there is only one colour card.\n\n\u201cI see in your eyes that I am probably the only one who sees it like this. It is dangerous as hell. I don\u2019t want to cause the boy any problems, but he has to calm down. He has to calm down.\u201d", "description": "Leicester City have contacted the police regarding racist social media posts directed at midfielder Hamza Choudhury.The 22-year-old, who is of Bangladeshi and Grenadian heritage, was targeted online after a tackle which injured Liverpool\u2019s Mohamed Salah.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/J743r7j9qGNQ8NRRAh_H4w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEwNTI7aD03OTA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/xnfJw2kAe_4GLdcpZ5ZTFA--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/a9f7ee3671f99c00ec23c246255f86a0", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
