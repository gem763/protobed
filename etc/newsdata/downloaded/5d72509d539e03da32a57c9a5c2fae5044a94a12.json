E! reports that Cyrus was seen showing PDA with her longtime friend\u2014and Gigi Hadid's ex-boyfriend from years ago\u2014Cody Simpson at a Los Angeles grocery store Thursday afternoon.\n\nAn eyewitness told the outlet that the two went in the shop \"real quick\" to get a drink and sushi. They shared a \"quick kiss\" while looking at sushi options, per the source. The two then \"noticed people seeing them so they tried to rush out of there.\"\n\nE! notes that Cyrus and Simpson, a 22-year-old Australian singer, have been seen together multiple times over the last couple days. But maybe that's not too surprising at all: Cyrus and Simpson go way back.\n\nSimpson spoke about how he became close with Cyrus in December 2015. He told GQ Australia that \"Miley is one of my best friends and she helps with some of that transitional stuff\u2014trying to escape your childhood. She's super open-minded and I'm working on becoming more like that.\"\n\nAs for his thoughts on Gigi Hadid? He spoke to the outlet then too about their relationship. (The outlet noted then that they remained close; the two broke up in May 2015, and she went on to date Joe Jonas, Zayn Malik, and Tyler Cameron in the time since) \u201cIt was a super-cool experience, having a first love like that,\u201d he said of dating Hadid. \u201cThen people started paying way more attention to us, which took its toll because I didn\u2019t want to be a celebrity\u2014just some guy who\u2019s dating models. It started getting super gnarly where we couldn\u2019t go out to restaurants. I got scared. Then I had to go away on tour, and we ended up splitting up.\u201d\n\nCyrus is pretty fresh off two major breakups: she and her husband Liam Hemsworth announced their separation in August. Cyrus had a month-long romantic friendship with Kaitlynn Carter after the news came out. She and Carter stopped dating at the end of September. A source told E! last week that after those two high-profile relationships, Cyrus is \"ready to focus on herself and not have to worry about anyone else.\"\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "Miley and Cody's PDA sighting comes shortly after Miley split with Kaitlynn Carter.", "authors": ["Alyssa Bailey"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/merBKuHybvZ1i4kAFKnndQ--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/elle_570/f4f7c1c3b00b8262269c40bcd4d5f059", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
