Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, said Congress had to take action. \u201cIf we do have the evidence from this whistle-blower that the president indeed did try to bully a foreign power into affecting our elections, then we have to do something about it,\u201d he said on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on NBC as he called for release of the whistle-blower\u2019s complaint.\n\nMr. Murphy, who recently visited Ukraine, said Mr. Zelensky expressed consternation to him that the security aid was held up. The senator said administration officials gave him two explanations for holding up the money \u2014 that Mr. Trump was concerned about corruption in Ukraine and that he thought Europe should be the one to assist Kiev rather than the United States.\n\nBut Mr. Murphy cast doubt on those explanations and said the situation was clearly suspicious. \u201cObviously, the timing of this looks really terrible,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile most Republicans remained silent, one prominent senator added his voice to the chorus of concern. \u201cIf the President asked or pressured Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate his political rival, either directly or through his personal attorney, it would be troubling in the extreme,\u201d Senator Mitt Romney of Utah wrote on Twitter on Sunday. \u201cCritical for the facts to come out.\u201d\n\nIn Kiev, Mr. Zelensky has not commented on the matter since the issue erupted in news reports in recent days, but Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister, Vadym Prystaiko, was quoted telling a Ukrainian news outlet on Saturday that the country\u2019s leaders did not take Mr. Trump\u2019s phone call as pressure.", "description": "President Trump said his call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine was perfectly appropriate, as Democrats intensified demands for an inquiry into abuse of power.", "authors": ["Peter Baker"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/22/us/politics/22dc-assess-promo/22dc-assess-promo-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
