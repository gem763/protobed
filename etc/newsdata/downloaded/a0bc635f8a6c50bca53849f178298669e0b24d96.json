In these 25 US cities, families are choosing to move elsewhere, according to new data collected by MagnifyMoney.\n\nLooking at US Census bureau migration records for 2016 and 2017, the cities were ranked by the net mobility, or the number of families moving out minus the number of families moving in. For the purpose of this list, MagnifyMoney only considered households with children under the age of 18.\n\nThe cities with the highest population moving out were large cities including New York and Los Angeles. However, smaller cities also lost more families than they gained, with places like Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Charleston, South Carolina; and St. Louis, Missouri all losing a few thousand families over the course of the year.\n\nThese 25 cities lost the most families between 2016 and 2017:", "description": "Families are leaving traditionally expensive cities like New York City and Los Angeles, and smaller cities like Pittsburgh and Milwaukee.", "authors": ["Liz Knueven"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d890e052e22af223f29abc3-1334-667.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
