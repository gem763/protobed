Wendy\u2019s executives claim that doing the same wouldn't take away anything from their existing business and would generate new sales.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re absolutely confident this is going to work,\u201d CEO Todd Penegor told investors on Friday.\n\nPrevious attempts to add breakfast to Wendy\u2019s menus were ultimately too expensive, with the equipment costing nearly $10,000 per location, said Kurt Kane, president of the company's U.S. business. A region-by-region launch rather than a national rollout compounded the challenges, according to Restaurant Business Online.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t have scale behind it,\u201d Kane said. This time, the company will be going nationwide right out of the gate, with heavy promotion and advertising.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll put full media power behind the breakfast,\u201d Kane said, while adding that the increased national advertising will build breakfast sales quickly.\n\nThe chain has included its franchises, which make up 95 percent of Wendy\u2019s U.S. restaurants, in preparations for the launch, he added.\n\nRestaurant Business Online reports that Wendy\u2019s breakfast menu will be centered on drive-thru customers instead of those dining in, as most breakfast buyers order on their way to work. Kane said breakfast test-runs at 300 Wendy's locations this year haven\u2019t resulted in any financial losses.\n\nWendy\u2019s will also be paring down its breakfast-item ingredients from 45 to 18, with no new equipment required and as few as three employees needed.\n\nInstead of licensing another brand\u2019s coffee, Wendy\u2019s will develop its own blend,and most of the new menu will consist of breakfast sandwiches, many of which will use existing products such as the \u201cBreakfast Baconator.\u201d\n\nWendy\u2019s, which generated $9.4 billion in sales last year, says that it will not serve breakfast all day like some of its fast-food competitors, to avoid doing too much at once.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "Wendy's is rolling out a breakfast menu again after three failed attempts over the years.
