John Kennedy subsequently was elected president in 1960. Edward Kennedy held his Senate seat for nearly 47 years until his death in 2009.(Writing by Daniel Wallis in New YorkEditing by Matthew Lewis)", "description": "The member of the famed political dynasty launched a 2020 primary challenge against fellow Democrat Edward Markey in Massachusetts.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d86a6592300005700d350ed.jpeg?cache=mptk6uvxd6&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
