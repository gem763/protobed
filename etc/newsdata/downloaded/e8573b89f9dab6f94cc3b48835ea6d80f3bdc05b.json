Stayers are people generally over the age of 30, and they\u2019re not embracing technology, and that's a problem. They're looking at it from the point of view of, if I do a good job, then I\u2019ll get to keep my job. So we've got to help those people,\" Mr Abrahams says.\n\n\"And then you've got your under-30s who are all mostly players, and they've embraced technology. But it\u2019s incumbent on every organisation to train staff.\"\n\nAny business person worth their salt knows the importance of creating solutions to unmet consumer problems, and advertisers know that if there is no problem, it's fine to just invent one. For example, marketers first had to convince people that \"body odour\" was a thing in order to sell them deodorant.\n\nFor Mr Abrahams' course, that \"problem\" is \"disruptive technologies anxiety\", which he alludes to in a video advertisement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"There is a wave of social awkwardness happening at dinner parties across the world. Its name is disruptive technologies anxiety, or DTA,\" he says.\n\n\"It occurs when disruptive technologies like blockchain and AI are mentioned at a dinner party, and guests, rather than facing the embarrassment of admitting that they don't really understand what it\u2019s all about, they mumble words to the effect of 'I think it's going to be really big' before then trying to quickly change the subject.\"\n\nNetflix-style learning\n\nThe message is clearly tongue in cheek, but it taps into one of lawyers' greatest fears: not being the smartest person in the room. However, Mr Abrahams says that not understanding or seeking to understand new technologies is a genuine problem and not a beat-up.\n\nFurthermore, he says lead indicators such as patent filings can help distinguish what technology changes are mere noise in the zeitgeist from those that are here to stay.\n\n\"We've got 8000 people across 50 offices. So, what we can see is actually which technologies are really starting to move, and where we often see it first is in our patent filing area. So we can see that, let's say, three years ago, AI patents and autonomous patents, that work really started to ramp up,\" he says.\n\n\"So, that's sort of a lead indicator of where the R &D [research and development] is going, and then you can follow that through, and we then start to see people ask for more advice.\"\n\nShort courses give people the ability to learn new things beyond a panicked, cursory Wikipedia search. Mr Abrahams says that the course has been met with enthusiasm thus far.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe also noted an \"interesting\" split in how people approached doing the course, with more Millennials opting to binge the whole six-hour micro-certificate in one hit.\n\n\"It's a fascinating insight into the way the younger generation is interested in learning and are looking at a micro-certificate course like the way they'd look at Netflix. We are hopeful that we can change the vernacular from 'Netflix and chill' to 'micro-cert and chill',\" he says.\n\nMr Abrahams has headed up innovation at Norton Rose for nearly two decades.\n\nSince then, Big Law has been busily investing in partners adept at driving technological innovation from within, from Gilbert + Tobin's chief operating officer and former McKinsey & Co partner Sam Nickless to Minter Ellison's head of innovation Andrew Cunningham.\n\nBefore Norton Rose, Mr Abrahams worked as a creative executive at Warner Brothers in Hollywood and ran a comedy club in Japan.\n\nHe keeps his stand-up comedy flame alight today with a part-time gig as a \"comic futurist\", where he gives keynote speeches with an entertaining twist on many of the topics found in his e-learning modules.", "description": "Norton Rose Fulbright\u2019s global head of technology and innovation Nick Abrahams has launched a bingeable e-learning course for anxious lawyers to help them understand how artificial intelligence, blockchain and data privacy actually work.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3092%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_128%2C$y_280/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/80923168c09207a711212841bd8c1881edb7d67a", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
