We lost our previous four matches against them and it could have gone that way again,\u201d said South Africa coach Rassie Erasmus.\n\n\u201cWe had a little bit of luck on our side. I am proud of our guys but also proud to play a team like Wales.\n\n\u201cWe are only halfway there. We want to win the World up and we are against a class side in England but we have the chance now.\u201d\n\nSouth Africa won both their previous finals in 1995 and 2007 but no side has ever won the World Cup after losing a game at the tournament, as the Springboks did in their pool opener against the All Blacks.\n\n\u201cIt was a tough, physical match, congratulations to South Africa,\u201d said Warren Gatland, whose 12-year tenure as Wales coach comes to an end after the tournament.\n\n\u201cThey deserved to win today. I take my hat off to them. I am very proud of our guys. We never gave up in the arm wrestle. It was a tough encounter.\u201d\n\nAERIAL CONTEST\n\nAn chilly autumn wind had blown away the last remains of a balmy day soon after kickoff but that did not deter both sides from going aerial from the start.\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s set piece looked steadier but Wales were getting past the Springboks\u2019 rush defence on the left wing and looked more likely to cross.\n\nIn the absence of any other enterprise, Pollard and Dan Biggar reprised their flyhalf penalty-kicking duel of the 2015 quarter-final, with the South African coming out on top - as he did four years ago - to send his side into halftime 9-6 ahead.\n\nThe Welsh suffered a double injury blow just before the break that did not augur well for an attritional contest, however, with prop Tom Francis (shoulder) and winger George North (hamstring) forced off.\n\nBiggar stepped up to kick his third penalty to tie the scores six minutes into the second half but the biggest cheer from the crowd until that point came when Springboks scrumhalf Faf de Klerk squared up to towering Wales lock Jake Ball.\n\nSouth African fans finally had something to shout about approaching the hour mark when Pollard for once eschewed the kick and cut through the defensive line and into the Welsh 22.\n\nWith the referee playing advantage, the ball came out to the 16-stone de Allende, who brushed off two tacklers and reached over to touch down in the grasp of a third.\n\nWales, who will face the All Blacks in the third-place playoff on Friday, hit straight back, camping on the South African line, taking a five-metre scrum when awarded a penalty then quickly moving the ball out to the wing for Adams to score.\n\nSlideshow (19 Images)\n\nFullback Leigh Halfpenny split the uprights from wide out to level up the scores but South Africa\u2019s pack had been reinforced by fresh bodies from the bench and they did enough to ensure Pollard had his chance to win it.\n\n\u201cToday we fell short, but hopefully we will get another opportunity,\u201d said Wales captain Alun Wyn Jones, a veteran of the 2011 semi-final loss to France and who was playing his 142nd test.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t our day.\u201d", "description": "Springboks flyhalf Handre Pollard kicked a penalty four minutes from time to send South Africa into their third Rugby World Cup final with a 19-16 victory over Wales in a semi-final dogfight on Sunday.", "authors": ["Nick Mulvenney", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191027&t=2&i=1445486881&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9Q0CU", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
