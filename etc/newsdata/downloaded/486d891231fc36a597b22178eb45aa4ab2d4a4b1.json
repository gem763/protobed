( Daniel Leal-Olivas/Reuters)\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson lost a Parliamentary vote on Tuesday to fast-track his Brexit proposal, all but ensuring that his government will fail to facilitate an exit from the European Union by October 31 as previously promised.\n\nJohnson, who has said he would rather be \u201cdead in a ditch\u201d than delay Brexit, has threatened to call a general election if the vote didn\u2019t pass.\n\nBritain\u2019s House of Commons did, however, vote to pass Johnson\u2019s bill to ratify Brexit. The bill, which passed 329-299, formally commits Britain to exiting the E.U.\n\nThe vote marks the first time Parliament has agreed in principle to Brexit.\n\nJohnson had reached a tentative agreement with Brussels on October 17 on withdrawing from the E.U., but faced resistance when he tried to call a vote on the the agreement in Parliament.\n\nLawmakers initially withheld approval of the agreement on Saturday. Johnson then tried to schedule a vote on Monday to ratify the bill, but was rebuffed by Parliament Speaker John Bercow, who said the vote would be \u201crepetitive and disorderly.\u201d\n\nOpposition Leader Jeremy Corbyn hailed the rejection of Johnson\u2019s fast-tracked Brexit.\n\n\u201cTonight the House has refused to be bounced into debating a hugely significant piece of legislation in just two days \u2014 with barely any notice and an analysis of the economic impact of this bill,\u201d Corbyn said after the vote.", "description": "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson lost a Parliamentary vote on Tuesday to fast-track his Brexit proposal.", "authors": ["Zachary Evans", "Robert Verbruggen", "Andrew C.
