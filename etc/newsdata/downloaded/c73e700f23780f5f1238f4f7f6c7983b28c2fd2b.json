Other opposition parties are also on board. Nicola Sturgeon, leader of the 35-seat Scottish National Party, said she\u2019s \u201csympathetic\u201d to the plan and would back anything that makes sure the deal doesn\u2019t go through on Saturday.\n\nJohnson doesn\u2019t have a majority, so a united opposition and the support of former Tories, such as Philip Hammond and David Gauke, gives the move a good chance of passing.\n\nThe amendment says Parliament should withhold approval of the deal \u201cunless and until implementing legislation is passed.\u201d That would automatically trigger the Benn Act, which says the prime minister must ask the EU for an extension if he hasn\u2019t finalized a deal with both the EU and U.K. Parliament by Oct. 19.\n\n\u201cMy aim is to ensure that Boris\u2019s deal succeeds, but that we have an insurance policy which prevents the U.K. from crashing out on Oct. 31 by mistake if something goes wrong during the passage of the implementing legislation,\u201d Letwin said in an email. \u201cNothing in my amendment or in the Benn Act itself in any way delays the actual departure of the U.K. from the EU immediately following the ratification of the Withdrawal Agreement.\u201d\n\nLetwin won\u2019t know until Saturday morning if his amendment has been selected for debate by Speaker John Bercow.\n\n(Updates with Letwin in seventh paragraph.)\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Robert Hutton in London at rhutton1@bloomberg.net;Jessica Shankleman in London at jshankleman@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Tim Ross at tross54@bloomberg.net, Thomas Penny, Andrew Atkinson\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Boris Johnson may not even get the chance to put his Brexit deal to the vote on Saturday, with support growing for a move by an alliance of former Conservatives and opposition Members of Parliament to delay the decision by a week or more.Former Tory minister Oliver Letwin and Labour MP", "authors": ["Robert Hutton", "Jessica Shankleman"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
