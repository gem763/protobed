Another friend was thrown from the car and survived.\n\nThe South Florida SunSentinel reports that James B. Riley sued Wednesday in Santa Clara County, California, where Tesla is based. Monserrat's parents filed a similar lawsuit in January. Both blame the car's lithium-ion battery pack, which exploded when the Tesla hit a concrete wall.\n\nA Tesla statement earlier this year said \"no car could have withstood a high-speed crash of this kind.\"", "description": "Says it should have been an \"entirely survivable\" crash.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/fire-3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
