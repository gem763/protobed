And then we did a love scene afterward\u2026 I\u2019d stopped breastfeeding [but] my milk came in all over his chest. And I did not get the role.\u201d\n\nChamberlain went on to film the series with another British actress \u2014 Rachel Ward.\n\nJANE SEYMOUR, 68, EXPLAINS HOW SHE STAYS IN SHAPE: \u2018I\u2019M NOT TRYING TO BE YOUNGER THAN WHO I AM\u2019\n\nJANE SEYMOUR POSES FOR PLAYBOY, RECALLS HOW SHE ALMOST QUIT ACTING AFTER BEING SEXUALLY HARASSED\n\n\u201cThe Thorn Birds\u201d told the tale of a Catholic priest (Chamberlain) and the granddaughter (Ward) of a vast sheep station owner who becomes tormented by desire. It also starred Christopher Plummer and Barbara Stanwyck, among others.\n\n\u201cI will tell you that was very disappointing and devastating,\u201d admitted Seymour. \u201cAnd to this day, I\u2019ve never seen the movie. That was like, \u2018Oh no, how could that happen?\u2019 At this point in my life, I can see the humor in it, but I ended up doing two other movies, two other miniseries that ended up being even better for me. So, you know, I don\u2019t think of the dark side of things anymore really.\u201d\n\n'I will tell you that was very disappointing and devastating. And to this day, I\u2019ve never seen the movie.' \u2014 Jane Seymour\n\nThe former Bond girl and \u201cDr. Quinn\u201d icon has since kept busy in Hollywood. In fact, she\u2019s currently starring in \u201cHigh Strung Free Dance,\u201d about young New Yorkers determined to pursue their passions on stage. Seymour, who previously starred in 2016\u2019s \u201cHigh Strung,\u201d also serves as the sequel\u2019s executive producer.\n\n\u201cIt was a terrific script,\u201d said Seymour. \u201cI thought it was even better than the original. That\u2019s why I did it. Plus I think the cast and everything about this one are really great.\u201d\n\nJANE SEYMOUR: WHY I BECAME AN AMERICAN\n\nJuliet Doherty, a professional dancer who plays Seymour\u2019s daughter in the film, said she was in awe of the star during filming.\n\nJANE SEYMOUR: AMERICA IS AN EXTRAORDINARY PLACE\n\n\u201cI had heard stories about working with Jane and just everything that was said about her was just absolutely true \u2014 what...a professional she was,\u201d Doherty told Fox News. \u201cI was just enamored when I was in a scene with her because it just seemed so effortless\u2026 She made it so easy. And I just learned so much from her on how to carry yourself and operate on set. It was just so comforting\u2026 It was a transformational moment for me being in scenes with Jane.\u201d\n\nSeymour, who previously had big dreams of becoming a dancer before finding fame in Hollywood, said the story hits close to home.\n\n\"I had flat feet and a speech impediment,\u201d recalled Seymour. \u201cMy parents didn\u2019t have any money and were required to get me dance lessons so I learned to not have flat feet\u2026 Funny enough, I ended up not only loving dance, but I decided I wanted to be a classical ballerina\u2026 But I was never built right for ballet. I just didn\u2019t have the right body, but I got pretty far, considering. As luck would have it, I injured myself and became an actress by default.\u201d\n\nJANE SEYMOUR REUNITES WITH \u2018DR. QUINN\u2019 LOVE INTEREST JOE LANDO: \u2018SUMMERS WITH SULLY\u2019\n\n\u201cThe two things that I was told I couldn\u2019t do ended up being the two things that I had ended up having success with,\u201d added Seymour.\n\nJANE SEYMOUR SAYS SHE'S TRIED BOTOX ONCE: IT WAS A 'TERRIBLE MISTAKE'\n\nSeymour made a big splash in 1973\u2019s 007 film \u201cLive and Let Die\u201d alongside Roger Moore as James Bond.\n\n\u201cI was very young,\u201d said Seymour. \u201cI really didn\u2019t know anything. I mean, I was 20 when I was shooting that and I was a very young 20 \u2014 more like 15 really. They were looking for someone to play a virgin and I think I was the last one they could find. I was close anyway. I was completely out of my depth. I was in the most exotic places, fabulous hotels \u2014 it was a very heavy experience.\u201d\n\nSeymour said the film\u2019s leading man quickly put her at ease.\n\nROGER MOORE\u2019S SON GEOFFREY SAYS LATE ACTOR LEFT JAMES BOND FRANCHISE AT THE RIGHT TIME\n\n\u201cRoger Moore was very kind and very thoughtful,\u201d she said. \u201cHe really took care of me, which was really kind of him. But I was totally out of my depth in it. And the funny thing is, I felt comfortable by hanging out with the dancers [from the film]\u2026 I\u2019d skip out of what I was doing and go to where the rehearsals were and join them.\u201d\n\nROGER MOORE'S DAUGHTER SHARES MEMORIES OF GROWING UP WITH JAMES BOND STAR\n\nWhile Seymour found success as an actress, she never forgot her first love.\n\n\u201cWhen I had to give up dance, it was devastating,\u201d she said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t even imagine what I would do when I couldn\u2019t dance anymore. And then I ended up playing a dancer in a movie and that segued into acting. Every time I\u2019ve realized that [when] something really bad has happened or I [didn\u2019t] get the role I really wanted\u2026 it always ended up being for the best. It was always something better coming along. Every time.\u201d\n\nBut these days, Seymour is looking forward to what the future holds for her. In fact, she recently reunited with her \u201cDr. Quinn\u201d co-star Joe Lando.\n\nFAMILY OF INFAMOUS MAFIA INFORMANT TOMMASO BUSCETTA COMES OUT OF HIDING FOR \u2018OUR GODFATHER\u2019 DOC\n\nThe series, which aired from 1993 until 1998, chronicled the adventures of a female doctor --played by Seymour--in a small Wild West town.\n\n'AVENGERS' STAR ELIZABETH OLSEN EXPLAINS WHY WE NEED 'ALL REPRESENTATIONS OF SUPERHEROES'\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fantastic,\u201d said Seymour about spending time with Lando, 57. \u201cHe\u2019s my closest friend. We\u2019re really, really close and we\u2019ve known each other for such a long time now. Our kids have all grown up together and we see each other socially all the time\u2026 We get along really, really well.\u201d\n\nSeymour also hinted it won\u2019t be the last time fans will see her with the American actor who famously played her TV love interest Byron Sully.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re actively trying to get \u2018Dr. Quinn\u2019 back,\u201d she teased. \u201cWe\u2019re doing whatever we can to do that. We\u2019re trying to get it out there.\u201d\n\n\u2018JAY AND SILENT BOB REBOOT\u2019 STAR JOKES DAD KEVIN SMITH WOULD \u2018DISOWN ME\u2019 IF SHE WASN\u2019T IN THE FILM\n\n\u201cHigh Strung Free Dance\u201d is currently in theaters.", "description": "Jane Seymour can still vividly recall one scene on set that went horribly wrong.", "authors": ["Stephanie Nolasco", "Jane Seymour"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/rt_janeseymourmain_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
