I\u2019ve had middle-class mothers saying \u201cs***w you!\u201d. But I don\u2019t care, I really don\u2019t.\n\n\u2018The anti-vaccination movement has got bigger and more dangerous in the past few years and my family has been affected in so many ways. The amount of misinformation and scaremongering about vaccines is astonishing, and I\u2019ve gone from being incredulous to feeling angry that it\u2019s spreading like wildfire.\u2019\n\nStephanie, from South-West London, has more reasons than most to support vaccination. She is a measles survivor herself and has lived with a lifelong disability as a result of contracting the illness when she was younger.\n\nStephanie Nimmo is aware that, by speaking out in favour of vaccinations, she will be hit by a furious backlash from the anti-vax community\n\n\u2018It\u2019s one of my earliest memories,\u2019 she says. \u2018I was desperately ill. I had a banging headache, a sore throat and rash and I spent a week lying in a darkened room, unable to bear any light or loud noise. My mother was a nurse who wonders if she brought the highly-contagious virus home from a ward.\n\n\u2018Though vaccines were available in 1972, they weren\u2019t given routinely and certainly not in the part of South Wales where I grew up. But my mother had seen children die from it.\n\n\u2018Two years later, the doctors realised I\u2019d become deaf in one ear. I\u2019d been back and forth to the GP since having measles because I\u2019d been complaining that my ear \u201cfelt funny\u201d.\n\n\u2018Because I was so young, I learned to live with it. When my mum found out, she burst into tears. Children don\u2019t just \u201cgo deaf\u201d. It was the measles.\u2019\n\nThree decades later, there was no doubt in Stephanie\u2019s mind that vaccinating her children was \u2018a no-brainer\u2019.\n\n\u2018Our first son, Theo, was born in 1997, around the same time that Dr Andrew Wakefield\u2019s now discredited report on the links with MMR and autism was in the news and I remember mothers in my NCT [National Childbirth Trust] group talking about whether they should go ahead and vaccinate.\n\nThree decades later, there was no doubt in Stephanie\u2019s mind that vaccinating her children was \u2018a no-brainer\u2019. Pictured is Stephanie with her daughter, Daisy\n\n\u2018But for myself and my husband [Andy, a management consultant], there was never any question. Andy was pro-science and we read up on it and put our faith in the doctors.\n\n\u2018No one can say every vaccine is 100 per cent safe, but the science made sense. Another mother in the NCT group was also deaf in one ear as a result of mumps and we both vaccinated our children and thought nothing more about it.\n\n\u2018Two years later, Andy and I vaccinated our daughter, Xanthe, and did it again with our second son, Jules, in 2002.\u2019\n\nEven when Stephanie and Andy\u2019s sons were diagnosed as being on the autistic spectrum some years later \u2014 both have Asperger\u2019s, a form of high-functioning autism \u2014 she was quick to dismiss any link.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve done so much research and there are so many holes in the argument that MMR and autism are linked,\u2019 Stephanie says. \u2018There\u2019s absolutely no connection. We\u2019d noticed signs of autism in Theo even before he had the vaccine, though we didn\u2019t know what they were.\n\n\u2018He always had colic, was a bad sleeper and later on, developed obsessions about routines. Even Theo says it\u2019s an insult to people like him to say his autism is a result of a vaccine, rather than just the person he is. He says he\u2019d give the vaccine to his own children as well.\u2019\n\nEven when Stephanie and Andy\u2019s sons were diagnosed as being on the autistic spectrum some years later \u2014 both have Asperger\u2019s, a form of high-functioning autism \u2014 she was quick to dismiss any link. Stock picture\n\nBut it was when their fourth daughter, Daisy, was born in 2004, that the issue of vaccination came sharply into focus for the family.\n\n\u2018Daisy had a very rare genetic disease, Costello syndrome, which caused her entire gastro-intestinal system to fail,\u2019 says Stephanie.\n\n\u2018She spent most of her life on powerful immunosuppressants and steroids and as a result could not receive live vaccines because her immune system was so compromised. Now, more than ever, we were aware of how heavily she relied on the \u201cherd immunity\u201d of others who are vaccinated to protect our vulnerable child. Remembering how badly I had suffered \u2014 and I had been a healthy child \u2014 I knew that measles would kill my daughter.\n\n\u2018At first, we weren\u2019t too worried. Thanks to vaccinations, this country had eradicated so many diseases:measles, mumps, whooping cough etc. Science solved the problem.\u2019\n\nBut as the anti-vax movement gained momentum, cases of measles began to rise and the fear that her daughter would get severely ill became a reality.\n\n\u2018We were scared,\u2019 says Stephanie. \u2018When I heard of a measles outbreak in South Wales about eight years ago where a child had died, I thought: \u201cWow, are people really putting their own children and other more vulnerable people at risk?\u201d\n\n\u2018We\u2019ve become so complacent about diseases like measles, and we don\u2019t take them seriously because we don\u2019t see them any more. But it can be devastating for anyone with a weakened immune system.\n\n\u2018Andy and I made sure we never used public transport with Daisy, and when we were out in public, it was always at the back of my mind that she might not be protected.\u2019\n\nStephanie now helps to educate those parents who are worried about vaccinations\n\nThe issue was compounded when, tragically, Andy was diagnosed with Stage 4 terminal cancer in 2014. \u2018Suddenly, I\u2019d gone from having one person who was vulnerable thanks to their immune system, to two,\u2019 says Stephanie.\n\n\u2018Andy\u2019s chemo wiped out his immune system to the point where everyone had to wear masks around him at certain times during treatment. We had \u201cwindows of wellness\u201d where we could enjoy time as a family, but we were aware that something like a simple trip to the shops could result in him catching a disease like measles and dying.\n\n\u2018In the end, we had a year together, which I\u2019m grateful for and again, it\u2019s down to medicine and drugs which gave us that time together.\u2019\n\nIn a devastating twist, Daisy also succumbed to further illness and in 2017 Stephanie was left with an unimaginable choice. \u2018I had to make the decision to turn off the life support system that was keeping my 12-year-old daughter alive,\u2019 she says.\n\n\u2018I knew that medical science had kept her alive and I knew that we were lucky to have 12 wonderful years with her, but the bottom line was that it was her time and I had to make the decision to let her go.\n\n\u2018When parents say they struggle about whether to vaccinate children because they are worried about the effects, I understand. But that\u2019s what parenting is about: difficult decisions.\n\n\u2018It was medical science which kept Daisy alive for so long. Without it, she may not even have survived her birth. It\u2019s so easy for people to take for granted what we have now, but it\u2019s thanks to medical science that children are not dying of measles and mumps any more.\u2019\n\nStephanie now helps to educate those parents who are worried about vaccinations.\n\n\u2018I know that whatever I say or write, many anti-vaxxers will never be swayed. They send me so-called \u201cevidence\u201d which is pseudo-science at best and deeply flawed. I find it ironic that a lot of the time it\u2019s middle-class parents from \u201cnappy valley\u201d areas like my own who have decided not to vaccinate.\n\n\u2018How privileged have they become that they can take things like this for granted when children in previous generations had no choice?\n\n\u2018In poorer countries, mothers queue for hours to be vaccinated but here, we say we don\u2019t want to be putting \u201ctoxins\u201d in our children. I have to wonder what they would do if their child got something like cancer? Would they be happy to trust the doctors with their drugs then?\n\n\u2018I hope any parent of an unvaccinated child doesn\u2019t have to watch their child suffer, develop a disability or worse. I\u2019ve watched my child die and I wouldn\u2019t wish that pain on anyone.\u2019\n\nStephanie Nimmo is the author of Was This In The Plan? (Hashtag Press, \u00a39.35)\n\n'I wish I'd given my boys the triple jab': A frank mea culpa from a mother who's also our Good Health editor\n\nNone of Justine Hancock's three sons, now 24, 21 and 15, had the MMR jab as part of their routine childhood immunisations. But if she had to decide again, all three would have been given the triple vaccine\n\nNone of my three sons, now 24, 21 and 15, had the MMR jab as part of their routine childhood immunisations. But if I had to decide again, all three would have been given the triple vaccine.\n\nInstead, like too many others, I was frightened off it by a study published in 1998 that linked it to autism.\n\nIt\u2019s a decision I now regret. For, quite apart from leaving them unprotected for too long, with my first two unvaccinated, it meant I potentially exposed the baby I was hoping to conceive to the risk of rubella.\n\nThe complications of this viral infection are grim, and include deafness and heart problems for the baby, and miscarriage.\n\nNot that I considered that at the time, in my fright.\n\nThe now-infamous \u2014 and fraudulent \u2014 study, published in 1998 in the world-renowned Lancet journal, was led by gastroenterologist Andrew Wakefield. He\u2019d looked at 12 children with autism, identifying eight whose parents said their children\u2019s behavioural symptoms had developed within two weeks of receiving the MMR jab.\n\nAt a press conference after publication, Dr Wakefield (as he was \u2014 he\u2019s since been struck off from the UK medical register) called for the MMR vaccine to be suspended pending more research.\n\nThe MMR story seemed to dominate the headlines for weeks on end \u2014 though possibly this was just how it felt to anxious parents.\n\nThe now-infamous \u2014 and fraudulent \u2014 study, published in 1998 in the world-renowned Lancet journal, was led by gastroenterologist Andrew Wakefield\n\nBut in any event, like scalded cats, my friends and I talked about it and panicked \u2014 a few became anti-vaxxers and remain so. They\u2019ve since been joined by countless thousands elsewhere, leading to falling rates of vaccination.\n\nOthers like me, who had no qualms about our children\u2019s previous routine vaccinations (against diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, polio and the bacterial infection Hib), instead became \u2018single-vaxxers\u2019, getting the measles, mumps and rubella jabs done separately.\n\nWakefield himself suggested doing this, with the jabs a year apart.\n\nSo that\u2019s why my memories of my sons\u2019 pre-school years \u2014 and beyond \u2014 are dominated by endless car journeys to source the single vaccines.\n\nI vividly remember in the early days going to one temporary clinic, set up above a shop in a suburb of London, which felt very fly-by-night. I am not sure it was around even a few weeks later.\n\nWhile I then found other \u2014 legitimate \u2014 clinics, there were problems with supply, particularly of the mumps single jab. My middle son was nine years old when he finally had it.\n\nIt was a fraught business, and expensive \u2014 not much shy of \u00a3100 per jab. (This put me in the privileged minority able to afford the option of single jabs: who\u2019s to say if others were driven to become anti-vaxxers by force of economic circumstance?)\n\nAnd then, against this background, in 2001 there was the major storm over whether the then Prime Minister, Tony Blair, had given his toddler son, Leo, the triple jab. Mr Blair refused to say, his aides declaring that revealing family details would cross a red line. Stock picture\n\nAs I drove across the country and wrote out yet another cheque, it was with a sense of anger against the manufacturers and the Government who would no longer allow the single vaccines to be provided on the NHS.\n\nI wanted to do the best by my children \u2014 to vaccinate them \u2014 but by making the triple MMR jab the only option, it felt like the Government was forcing me to do something to my children that I thought would do them harm.\n\nAnd then, against this background, in 2001 there was the major storm over whether the then Prime Minister, Tony Blair, had given his toddler son, Leo, the triple jab. Mr Blair refused to say, his aides declaring that revealing family details would cross a red line.\n\nSeven years later, Cherie wrote in her autobiography that Leo had in fact had the triple vaccine, admitting: \u2018It\u2019s fair to say I was in two minds. [But] I did get Leo vaccinated.\u2019\n\nTo parents like me, the Prime Minister\u2019s silence had been tacit confirmation that the MMR was \u2018problematic\u2019 and that we could ignore official advice to use it on our children. Tony, it seemed until we learned the truth, had probably either avoided the triple jab or had gone to France to get Leo the single jabs to protect him \u2014 which was all we wanted for our children, too.\n\nAs a mother-to-be I\u2019d carefully avoided anything that might even vaguely affect my baby\u2019s health \u2014 everything I consumed was organic, nothing \u2018artificial\u2019; I shunned paracetamol, and even when I developed pneumonia during my first pregnancy, I seriously thought twice about taking the antibiotics. I had no pain relief during labour.\n\nI was \u2018hard-core wholesome\u2019 \u2014 and that continued after my babies were born. All organic food, of course (back then, that was a lot more difficult to do: I even persuaded a Californian friend to bring boxes of organic teething rusks every time she came to the UK, as I couldn\u2019t source them here).\n\nWhile I didn\u2019t have a problem with vaccinations per se, the MMR study hit me and others at our most vulnerable: the desire to protect our babies.\n\nIt was hard to make the case for voluntarily doing harm to your child by risking \u2018giving\u2019 them autism (a lifelong condition) to avoid a minor childhood illness (just a passing misery, we thought, blas\u00e9 thanks to the success of modern medicine).\n\nBy the time Wakefield\u2019s study was being discredited (it was retracted by the Lancet in 2010), I\u2019d moved into health journalism, and the evidence against the autism link was impossible to ignore.\n\nThere are at least ten large studies \u2014 and several smaller ones \u2014 that show the vaccine does not raise the risk of autism.\n\nThe most recent paper, published in March, involved more than 650,000 children up to about the age of eight, and was led by researchers in Denmark and California\u2019s Stanford University.\n\nIt confirmed previous findings that there is no link between the MMR vaccine and autism \u2014 and that this was even the case with children who might be at higher risk of the disorder (perhaps because they have older parents or a sibling with the condition).\n\nAlthough my sons had completed their full course of single jabs, I thought \u2018just in case\u2019, and made sure that they had booster triple jabs under the NHS\u2019s \u2018catch-up programme\u2019, during secondary school.\n\nThis, to me, seems a way forward: don\u2019t make parents feel guilty or stupid about not giving their child MMR.\n\nOffer them a catch-up. And make it easier to get appointments in the evenings and at weekends \u2014 or even offer the option of healthcare professionals going into the home to give the vaccine. Clearly, there also needs to be an education programme to tackle social-media misinformation. But making MMR mandatory would be a mistake.\n\nI think back to how I felt when the MMR story broke, and I fear that mandatory vaccination will only undermine trust in the medical profession among those who are already sceptical, while doing nothing to convert diehard anti-vaxxers.\n\nAs I write, I think about a relative of mine, now in his 30s, who caught meningitis as an infant and was left deaf, and how different his life has been as a result.\n\nIt was probably meningitis B that was to blame \u2014 back then, it was not part of the standard infant vaccination schedule. It is now, in the UK.\n\nI\u2019m no Pollyanna about vaccines \u2014 like any medical treatment, they can sometimes cause side-effects \u2014 and pharmaceutical companies certainly make money from them.\n\nBut I know that my family and I have benefited from them \u2014 as have vulnerable people, including pregnant women. For these reasons, I firmly believe the MMR is worth having.", "description": "Stephanie Nimmo, 51, from South-West London, is aware that, by speaking out in favour of vaccinations, she will be hit by a furious backlash from the anti-vax community.", "authors": ["Jill Foster For The Daily Mail", "Justine Hancock", "Good Health Editor For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/22/19711434-0-image-a-2_1571088279112.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
