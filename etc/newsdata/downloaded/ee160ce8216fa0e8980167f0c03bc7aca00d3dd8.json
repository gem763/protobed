This virtual poison control website can be a lifesaving tool.", "language": "en", "text": "Fall is actually prime time for poisonings. Wild mushrooms, for example, might seem tempting, but toxicologists encourage you to get your mushrooms from the grocery store and not a nearby forest.\n\n\u201cThere are old mushroom hunters, and there are bold mushroom hunters,\u201d the site warns. \u201cThere are no old, bold mushroom hunters.\u201d Translation: If you\u2019re not a seasoned wild mushroom expert, don\u2019t pick or eat mushrooms in the wild. The same goes for fall berries \u2014 some look edible, but if you don\u2019t know for sure, stay away.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe first fully automated virtual poison control center, Webpoisoncontrol is an interactive tool that guides you through the same process you would encounter if you called one on the phone. Designed by board-certified toxicology experts, the tool does triage and provides recommendations and information on thousands of substances. It even emails you afterward to follow up so you can get help if the situation changes.\n\nThe site is available in app form, too, for Android devices and iPhones.\n\nIt\u2019s worth visiting even if you haven\u2019t been exposed. The site is full of helpful information, including poison statistics, a tip of the day, rotating poison information and \u201cThe Poison Post,\u201d a free quarterly e-newsletter.\n\nAD\n\nThe pill identifier option helps you answer questions such as \u201cWhat\u2019s this pill I just found in my teen\u2019s pocket?\u201d or \u201cMy pills are mixed up. Which pill should I take?\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIt only takes three to four minutes to go through the process. In 2018, the site handled 114,651 poison exposures. The site uses the same algorithms employed by operators inside poison control centers.\n\nIf the exposure took place in a child under 6 months old, a pregnant woman or someone with serious medical problems, call poison control at 800-222-1222.\n\nIf someone has had a seizure, collapsed, breathing problems or won\u2019t wake up, skip the computer and call 911.\n\nA surprising number of children are accidentally poisoned. Simple steps can prevent that.\n\nMany people fail to get rid of unneeded and expired drugs\n\nPoison control centers receive 32 calls a day about children exposed to opioids\n\nAD", "description": "Webpoisoncontrol.org is a fully automated program that does triage, and provides recommendations and information on thousands of substances.", "authors": ["Erin Blakemore"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/uMVxJHt1PB5vGvanFtUD6GWUQUw=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TZPOTWHFKEI6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
