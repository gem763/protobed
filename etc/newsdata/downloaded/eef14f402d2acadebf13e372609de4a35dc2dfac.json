Others tout racist myths. Take biologist James Watson, who wrongly claimed the black-white IQ gap is genetic, or writer Jason Richwine, whose doctoral dissertation asserted that \u201cthe low average IQ of Hispanics is effectively permanent\u201d \u2014 Harvard gave him a PhD for that discredited gem.\n\nOne factor that is little considered, even by academics who rail against racist stereotypes, is pollution and its impact on the brain. Research shows that contamination from cars, planes, power plants, factories and landfills is eroding the bodies and minds of black and brown Americans. Two new books call attention to this invisible crisis.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIntelligence in African Americans and other people of color \u2014 native Americans, Hispanics \u2014 is being assailed by the environment,\u201d said Harriet Washington, a medical ethicist and author of \u201cA Terrible Thing to Waste: Environmental Racism and Its Assault on the American Mind,\u201d which investigates what pollution is doing to the brains of people of color.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t all breathe the same air, although we would like to think that we do,\u201d she said. \u201cAfrican Americans are much more likely to live in fence-line communities where they share their neighborhoods with toxic factories. They\u2019re spewing mercury. They\u2019re spewing particulate matter. These things directly affect the brain, but they also cause hypoxia and asthma. And the hypoxia over time \u2014 that\u2019s a lowered amount of oxygen delivered to the brain, which can cause a death of neurons and the eventual loss of cognition.\u201d\n\nBeth Gardiner, author of \u201cChoked: Life and Breath in the Age of Air Pollution,\u201d homed in on this point in her new book. \u201cOne of the things that I found \u2014 and LA was a really good place to see it \u2014 is there\u2019s kind of this double-stranded dynamic with air pollution, which is that it affects everyone who breathes it, but it affects some people more than others,\u201d she said.\n\nGardiner described a long-term study on pollution in southern California. Researchers found that black and brown communities were more likely to be polluted. The kids who grew up in those communities were more likely to have lifelong health problem, such as asthma. And, as Washington mentioned, studies show that asthma can affect processing speed, attention, learning and memory.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe stark inequality in the air we breathe is part of a broad pattern of companies building factories, power plants and landfills in black and brown communities \u2014 and of public officials approving those plans.\n\n\u201cOne fact that I point out in the book is that a recent report found that African Americans with an income of $50,000 to $60,000 a year \u2014 solidly middle class \u2014 are more exposed to environmental toxins than are white people with $10,000 a year \u2014 profoundly poor,\u201d Washington said, describing the results of a 2008 study from the University of Colorado at Boulder. \u201cSo it\u2019s race. It\u2019s not poverty. Poverty is a risk factor. Race is a far larger one.\u201d\n\nWashington recalled when, in 1982, officials chose Afton, North Carolina, as the dumping site for thousands of tons of soil contaminated with PCBs, toxic chemicals linked with impaired brain function.\n\n\u201cThey said [Afton] was the best site for [the landfill], but they didn\u2019t cite any scientific studies,\u201d Washington said, \u201cAnd people in Afton said, \u2018We know why you picked us \u2014 because we\u2019re black. You think we won\u2019t fight back.\u2019\u201d\n\nLocals protested against the dumping of PCBs, which could seep into the air or ooze into the groundwater. Hundreds of people were arrested. They brought attention to the dumping, and in so doing, catalyzed the environmental justice movement. However, they also failed to stop the landfill, showing how hard it is to fight pollution. It can be difficult to prove that dumping was racially motivated and, further, that it harmed the brain of any one person.\n\n\u201cIf I have a heart attack tomorrow, or if I lose someone I love, or if a child suffers some sort of a cognitive impairment, it\u2019s often very difficult, except in the most extreme cases, to say [it was pollution],\u201d Gardiner said.\n\nCREDIT: Little, Brown Spark (left), University of Chicago Press (right)\n\nThis fact helps protect polluters, and so polluters are working hard to make sure the problem stays invisible, she said. Gardiner explained that companies are working hard to discredit studies that show how air pollution undermines public health \u2014 a phenomenon she calls \u201cair pollution denial.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think we have all become pretty accustomed over the last few years or more to this idea of climate denial. But what we\u2019ve really started to see even more recently is air pollution denial,\u201d Gardiner said. \u201cI think that the motivation for that is pretty clear. It\u2019s because those studies justify regulation that costs money to corporate polluters. And if you can cast doubt on some of that science, it\u2019s gonna make it easier for you to try to roll back some of that regulation.\u201d\n\nShe said that the government needs to pay attention to the research and use it to make good policy. Measures that cut pollution, for example, help keep people healthy and spare them costly hospital visits. She pointed to studies showing that the 1970 Clean Air Act has prevented tens of millions of asthma attacks and saved Americans trillions of dollars in health care costs.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s one of the most consequential pieces of legislation in modern American history,\u201d Gardiner said. \u201cAnd I think it\u2019s a little bit under-sung, given its achievements. And I think that is because of this idea of invisibility.\u201d\n\nShe said that while the Clean Air Act radically improved air quality, a lot of work remains to be done. So long as lawmakers fail to heed the research on what pollution is doing to American brains, the country as a whole will feel it. Even a small amount of contamination can shave off IQ points \u2014 maybe just a couple of points here and there, but over years and across the country, it starts to add up.\n\n\u201cWhat does it mean nationwide to lose an average of five IQ points? It means that we cut in half the number of gifted children, that we gain millions and millions more children who are mentally retarded,\u201d Washington said. \u201cIt\u2019s not five IQ points and that\u2019s it. It drags down the achievement of a child and the achievement of an entire nation over time.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cWe need to act on what we know now. I think we have enough studies. It\u2019s time to actually come up with policies that are going to address it.\u201d\n\nJeremy Deaton writes for Nexus Media, a syndicated newswire covering climate, energy, policy, art and culture.
