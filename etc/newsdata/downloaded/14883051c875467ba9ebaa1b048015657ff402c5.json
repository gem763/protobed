Their previous coalition was marked by constant bickering.\n\n\u201cWe cannot in the coming months waste our time with disputes and clashes,\u201d Conte told the lower house. \u201cWe must be sober in our words and active in our deeds.\u201d\n\nConte, a law professor with no political affiliation, added: \u201cThe language of this government will be mild-mannered because we understand that our actions will not be judged by the arrogance of our words.\u201d\n\nThe prime minister has previously accused his former ally, League leader Matteo Salvini, of indulging in sterile polemics and denounced his decision to quit the previous coalition as reckless.\n\nAs Conte was speaking, Salvini joined hundreds of far-right supporters in front of parliament. The protesters waved Italian flags and accused 5-Star and PD of perverting democracy by forming a coalition rather than accepting early elections.", "description": "Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said on Monday his new coalition, which combines the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and pro-Europe Democratic Party (PD), would do more and bicker less.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190909&t=2&i=1427907940&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF880XT", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
