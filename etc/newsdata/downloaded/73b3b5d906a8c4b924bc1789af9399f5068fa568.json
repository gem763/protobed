There is a concern that [mother of child] has lied about the children\u2019s medical conditions and therefore may have caused harm to the children and or caused them to have significant medical procedures.\n\nTurner raised over $25,000 for Olivia\u2019s cancer treatments by using a GoFundMe page and also helped her fulfill a \u201cbucket list\u201d of wishes.\n\nAdditionally, the Make-A-Wish Foundation spent over $11,000 on a bat princess party for Olivia and she went on multiple ride-alongs with police and fire crews.\n\nIn July of 2017, officials said the girl, who had been using a feeding tube, was admitted to Children\u2019s Hospital Colorado because of a nutrition deficiency, according to Valley News Live.\n\nThe report continued:\n\nOne doctor told investigators that Turner wanted to withdraw all medical care and artificial feeding for her daughter because her quality of life was so bad. He said she insisted that he sign a \u201cdo not resuscitate\u201d order for her daughter. Doctors had said Olivia wouldn\u2019t be able to survive on IV nutrition, and Turner was given the option of taking her home on hospice care, according to the indictment. Olivia died a few weeks later.\n\nIn November of 2018, Olivia\u2019s body was exhumed and an autopsy performed by Arapahoe County Coroner Dr. Kelly Lear. Although Lear said the girl\u2019s manner of death was undetermined, there was a lack of evidence showing that it was caused by a terminal illness as her mother had previously claimed.\n\nTurner is currently being held without bond and is expected to appear in court on November 1, according to Denver 7.", "description": "A Colorado mother has been accused of killing her daughter whom she claimed died of a terminal illness in 2017.", "authors": ["Amy Furr"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/kelly-renee-turner-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
