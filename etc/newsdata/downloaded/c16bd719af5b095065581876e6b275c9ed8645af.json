Easiest to dismiss.\"\n\nKaling played Kelly in the sitcom, and wrote and directed a number of episodes. She also found success with The Mindy Project, and recently starred in and wrote Late Night with Dame Emma Thompson, and wrote the Four Weddings and a Funeral TV reboot.\n\nHer dispute with the Television Academy dates back a decade, when the organisation was trying to cut the number of producers credited on the Emmy nomination for each show.\n\nThe 40-year-old told Elle magazine the Academy forced her to go through a \"humiliating\" process to prove her contribution.\n\n\"They made me, not any of the other producers, fill out a whole form and write an essay about all my contributions as a writer and a producer,\" she said. \"I had to get letters from all the other male, white producers saying that I had contributed, when my actual record stood for itself.\"\n\n'No-one was singled out'\n\nThe TV Academy denied the process was personal and said \"every performer producer and writer producer was asked to justify their producer credits\".\n\nAn Academy spokesman told the Los Angeles Times: \"No one person was singled out.\"\n\nKaling then took to Twitter to say their response \"doesn't make any sense\".\n\n\"There were other Office writer-performer-producers who were NOT cut from the list. Just me,\" she wrote.\n\n\"I worked so hard and it was humiliating. I had written so many episodes, put in so much time in the editing room, just to have the Academy discard it because they couldn't fathom I was capable of doing it all. Thankfully I was rescued by my friends, the other producers.\"\n\nKaling was listed in the nominations as a producer in the outstanding comedy series category in 2007 and 2008, and as a co-executive producer from 2009-11.\n\nShe noted the incident happened around 10 years ago and \"maybe it wouldn't happen now\" - however \"it happened to me\". Kaling has also asked the Academy to apologise.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.
