(Mary Altaffer/AP)\n\nRoughly 40 state attorneys general plan to take part in a New York-led antitrust investigation into Facebook, reflecting a broadening belief among the country\u2019s top Democrats and Republicans that the tech giant may be undermining its social-networking rivals.\n\nThe heightened interest \u2014 confirmed Monday by three people familiar with the matter \u2014 comes weeks after New York\u2019s Letitia James first announced a wide-ranging probe with seven other states and the District of Columbia to explore whether, in James\u2019 words at the time, Facebook has \u201cendangered consumer data, reduced the quality of consumers\u2019 choices, or increased the price of advertising.\u201d\n\nThe sources requested anonymity to discuss the investigation because such inquiries are confidential. The sources said that New York continues to solicit support from other states, meaning the number could still grow before it is formally announced.\n\nA spokesperson for James in New York declined to comment.\n\nOn Monday, Facebook pointed to its previous statement from Will Castleberry, the company\u2019s vice president of state and local policy, who said the company would \u201cwork constructively with state attorneys general and we welcome a conversation with policymakers about the competitive environment in which we operate.\u201d\n\n[Facebook, Google face off against a formidable new foe: State attorneys general]\n\nThe expanding state investigation into Facebook illustrates the broad, bipartisan concerns among the country\u2019s top law enforcement officials that some companies in Silicon Valley have become too big and powerful, harming consumers and corporate rivals. Texas is leading a probe into Google\u2019s advertising business that has the support of nearly every other state attorney general.\n\nThe state inquiry of Facebook comes in addition to two other antitrust investigations into the social-networking behemoth taking in place in Washington, one by the Department of Justice and the other by the Federal Trade Commission. Facebook has acknowledged the FTC inquiry in recent securities filings. The agency is exploring the company\u2019s past acquisitions, including Instagram and WhatsApp, for possible violations of antitrust law.\n\nOn Monday, James and other attorneys general huddled with FTC and DOJ officials to discuss Facebook, her office later confirmed. Axios first reported the meeting news.\n\nLast week, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg pledged to \u201cgo to the mat\u201d on antitrust during a private conversation with employees later unearthed by The Verge, a technology news site. Reflecting on the presidential aspirations of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic candidate who\u2019s vowed to challenge Silicon Valley on antitrust grounds, Zuckerberg pledged the company would mount a vigorous fight in court.\n\n\u201cIf she gets elected president, then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge. And does that still suck for us? Yeah,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to have a major lawsuit against our own government,\" he continued. \"I mean, that\u2019s not the position that you want to be in when you\u2019re, you know, I mean \u2026 it\u2019s like, we care about our country and want to work with our government and do good things. But look, at the end of the day, if someone\u2019s going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and you fight.\u201d", "description": "Roughly 40 state attorneys general plan to take part in a New York-led antitrust investigation into Facebook, reflecting a broadening belief among the country\u2019s top Democrats and Republicans that the tech giant may be undermining its social-networking rivals.", "authors": ["Tony Romm", "Senior Tech Policy Reporter", "October At Pm", "Tony Romm Is A Technology Policy Reporter At The Washington Post.
