The chaos also made way for hundreds of ISIS prisoners on Sunday to escape from a low-security detention camp in the area.\n\nIn the latest surge of anti-war rhetoric from the Trump administration, Defense Secretary Mark Esper said on Sunday that the U.S. is launching a \u201cdeliberate withdrawal\u201d of American forces from northern Syria but refused to say how long it will take.\n\n\u201cWe want to conduct it safely and quickly as possible,\u201d Esper told CBS\u2019s Face the Nation on Sunday morning, adding, \u201cI\u2019m not prepared to put a timeline on it, but that\u2019s our general game plan.\u201d\n\nTwo knowledgeable U.S. officials told The Daily Beast that the troops are just withdrawing further away from the advance of Turkish forces massacring the Syrian Kurds whom America relied upon to destroy the so-called Islamic State\u2019s caliphate.\n\nThere are currently 1,000 U.S. troops in Syria. A knowledgeable U.S. official said hundreds of those troops, without further specificity, will leave Syria for elsewhere in the Mideast. Following a pullout from two northern Syrian observation posts last week, the U.S. will now retreat farther away from the area Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has invaded.\n\nEsper said Trump gave the withdrawal order because Turkish forces are pushing further south into Syria and Kurdish forces had been trying to cut a deal with Syria and Russia to counter-attack.\n\n\u201cWe have American forces likely caught between two opposing advancing armies, and it\u2019s a very untenable situation,\u201d he said.\n\nBut as Esper made clear, the order affects only the north and there will still be American forces in the rest of Syria even as Trump\u2014who separately has ordered about 14,000 U.S. troops to the Persian Gulf region over the past six months\u2014rails against the disastrous, bloody, and interminable U.S. misadventure in the Middle East over the past generation.\n\nA U.S. official told CNN that U.S. policy \u201chas failed\u201d and that the campaign in Syria to defeat ISIS is \u201cover for now,\u201d giving the terrorist group \u201ca second lease on life with nearly 100,000 [people] who will re-join their jihad.\u201d\n\nThe mixed messaging by the Trump administration is making it difficult for even his most ardent supporters to help unravel his foreign policy on Syria as it spins out of control.\n\nJust days after Trump announced the withdrawal of American troops from northern Syria where they have been providing weapons and cover to allied Kurdish fighters on the border between Turkey and Syria, Turkey began a military incursion that has sent the region into a level of chaos it has not seen in recent years.\n\nThe Daily Beast first reported Friday that claims made by the Trump administration that U.S. troops had been withdrawn were false. \u201cWe are out of there. We\u2019ve been out of there for a while,\u201d Trump said Wednesday. \u201cNo soldiers whatsoever.\u201d Two officials told The Daily Beast that in fact the U.S. military had only pulled back from\u2014not completely out of\u2014northern Syria. They had simply abandoned two small observation posts from which they supported Kurdish allies in the fight against ISIS fighters.\n\nTrump then tweeted that he had been talking with Sen. Lindsey Graham (R\u2013SC), who had been highly critical of Trump\u2019s decision to remove troops. \u201cPray for our Kurdish allies who have been shamelessly abandoned by the Trump administration. This move ensures the reemergence of ISIS,\u201d Graham warned Wednesday. \u201cI urge President Trump to change course while there is still time by going back to the safe zone concept that was working.\u201d\n\nGraham later tweeted that any sanctions had to be serious. \u201cThe conditional sanctions announced today will be viewed by Turkey as a tepid response and will embolden Erdogan even more,\u201d Graham tweeted Friday. \u201cThe Turkish government needs to know Congress will take a different path\u2014passing crippling sanctions in a bipartisan fashion.\u201d\n\nBut in a Sunday morning tweet, the president wrote that he was working with Graham \u201cand many members of Congress, including Democrats, about imposing powerful Sanctions on Turkey.\u201d\n\nHe then added: \u201cTreasury is ready to go, additional legislation may be sought. There is great consensus on this. Turkey has asked that it not be done. Stay tuned!\u201d\n\nTurkey has warned that any threats of sanctions would be met with the release of millions of refugees along the border between Turkey and Syria into Europe. Trump told reporters at the White House earlier this week that such a possibility did not concern him. \u201cWell they\u2019re going to be escaping to Europe,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s where they want to go, they want to go back to their homes.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, the Associated Press reported that up to 700 ISIS sympathizers did escape the Ain Eissa camp, which holds up 12,000 people caught up in years of unrest. Most of those who escaped are ISIS brides and children, but officials warn that they could be part of a resurgence of the so-called Islamic state. Several known ISIS fighters were also spotted fighting in the current conflict, according to CNN, which reported that at least five fighters had escaped the notorious Ghuwairan prison due to heavy shelling in the area.\n\nDuring an appearance on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press, Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY)\u2014who has been one of the president\u2019s most vocal defenders on the Syria decision\u2014called it a \u201cmessy, complicated situation\u201d while saying the president was right to move soldiers out of the way because \u201cTurkey was coming in one way or another.\u201d When moderator Chuck Todd noted that U.S. soldiers near the Turkish border were serving as a deterrent to an Erdogan invasion, Paul retorted \u201cthey were until they weren\u2019t.\u201d\n\nTreasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin repeated Paul\u2019s line that this is a \u201ccomplicated situation\u201d when asked on ABC\u2019s This Week why the administration hasn\u2019t imposed sanctions on Turkey yet.\n\n\u201cWe are ready to go on a moment\u2019s notice to put on sanctions,\u201d Mnuchin said. \u201cAs I said, these sanctions could be starting small. They could be maximum pressure which would destroy the Turkish economy. The president is very focused on this. He\u2019s offered to mediate the situation.\u201d\n\nMnunchin also pushed back on criticism from those within the president\u2019s own party. In response to Graham and others saying sanctions would be a tepid reaction to Turkey, Mnuchin stated that this is a \u201cmulti-step process\u201d and the administration needs to make sure \u201cwe have the proper authorizations.\u201d\n\nThe treasury chief, meanwhile, was asked what the president was talking about when he criticized the Kurds for not storming the beaches at Normandy alongside U.S. troops. Mnuchin asserted Trump\u2019s analogy was that he was pushing back on everyone \u201csaying the Kurds are these long-standing allies\u201d and that our role in Syria \u201cwas not to defend the Kurds.\u201d\n\nOn CNN\u2019s State of the Union, Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-ND) said that while he wished the president\u2019s decision had \u201cbeen different,\u201d he feels that we tend to \u201coversimplify the complicated relationships\u201d in the region. He went on to say this wasn\u2019t a \u201cbinary choice\u201d as both the Turks and Kurds are considered allies. As for whether the U.S. was retreating from the area and allowing the Turks to invade northern Syria, Cramer said \u201cwe can\u2019t be in the middle of every skirmish in the neighborhood.\u201d\n\nHouse Foreign Affairs Committee Chair Eliot Engel (D-NY), meanwhile, told Meet the Press that while he is working on a bipartisan bill that will slap sanctions on Turkey and condemn the president\u2019s policy as it relates to the Kurds, he acknowledges that \u201cit\u2019s not going to stop\u201d the Turks now. Asked whether it\u2019s too late to do anything at this point, Engel seemed to resign himself to that notion.\n\n\u201cWe could mitigate the damage,\u201d he told Todd. \u201cOf course, it\u2019s spiraling quickly. And what\u2019s happened, of course, is a lot of ISIS prisoners, we\u2019ve gotten reports that they have been released or they\u2019ve escaped and so this is just the tip of the iceberg. And if we think this is terrible, I predict we will have many, many more days, weeks, and months of terrible things like this.\u201d\n\nElsewhere on Meet the Press, former secretary of defense James Mattis warned that ISIS could see a revival in the area, noting the Syrian Democratic Forces were the ones who largely fought the terror group in Syria. If we don\u2019t keep pressure on, ISIS will resurge,\u201d Mattis said. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely a given that they will come back.\u201d\n\nDuring his State of the Union interview, South Bend Mayor and Afghanistan War veteran Pete Buttigieg insisted Trump was \u201csystematically destroying American allies and American values.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s even more disturbing to me as a veteran is hearing from soldiers who feel they have lost their honor over this, who feel they are unable to look in the eye [of] allies who put their lives on line to fight with us,\u201d he added. \u201cIf you take away a soldier\u2019s honor, you might as well go after their body armor next. That is what the commander-in-chief is doing right now.\u201d", "description": "\u201cI\u2019m not prepared to put a timeline on it,\u201d Defense Secretary Mark Esper said.", "authors": ["Spencer Ackerman", "Justin Baragona", "Barbie Latza Nadeau", "Senior Nat L Security Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_3780,w_6720,x_0,y_658/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570980549/RTS2QRP3_l4zzow", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
