(AP) - South Carolina defensive back Shilo Sanders is now wearing the same jersey number his father Deion \u201cPrime Time\u201d Sanders made famous in the NFL.\n\nSchool officials said Thursday that the younger Sanders, who had worn No. 12 this season, is changing to No. 21. The move comes after Gamecocks starting safety Jamyest Williams - who had been wearing \u201c21\u201d the past few seasons - decided to leave the team after four games. Williams will redshirt the rest of this season with the intent of transfer elsewhere.\n\nShilo Sanders is a 6-foot, 190-pound freshman from Cedar Hill, Texas.\n\nDeion Sanders wore No. 2 as a star for Florida State, then wore No. 21 in the NFL with Atlanta, San Francisco, Dallas and Washington. Sanders wore No. 37 for his final two seasons with Baltimore.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball , http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25 and https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/ap-top-25-college-football-podcast\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "South Carolina defensive back Shilo Sanders is now wearing the same jersey number his father Deion \"Prime Time\" Sanders made famous in the NFL.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
