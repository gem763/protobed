Stewart, a Pulitzer-Prize winning reporter for The Wall Street Journal and currently a columnist for The New York Times and contributor to the New Yorker, is the author of several highly regarded books, among them \u201cDen of Thieves,\u201d \u201cDisney War\u201d and \u201cBlood Sport.\u201d Mr. Stewart is at his most readable and most effective when analyzing such matters as insider trading and business wrongdoing.\n\nMr. Stewart\u2019s mission here, however, is much different, an apparent attempt to breathe new life into the Mueller report by sorting through the tons of material that came out of it, simplifying it, and supplying it with a primary narrative plot line that combines the FBI investigations of both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, with Mrs. Clinton largely getting off light again, while Mr. Trump has engaged in actions that Mr. Stewart\u2019s publicists tells us have created a \u201cworld-historical struggle \u2014 Trump versus intelligence agencies.\u201d\n\nBut from another point of view, it might be defined as a struggle between a sitting president, several misfit FBI agents, and a few old intelligence hands so accustomed to occupying their lucrative positions of influence requiring little thought or effort that anyone challenging the status quo and their positions in it is by definition a threat to the republic.\n\nAre these members of the Deep State? Does a Deep State exist? Mr. Stewart poses the question to one of the people he writes for, David Remnick, editor of the New Yorker, a typical mainstream media Trump hater who provides a typically nasty but evasive mainstream response: \u201c\u2018The problem is not a Deep State; the problem is a shallow man \u2014 an untruthful, vain, vindictive, alarmingly erratic President.\u201d\n\nBut nastiness aside, the answer to Mr. Stewart\u2019s rhetorical question is of course it exists. It always has, and at times various presidents have found it necessary to fight it, among them FDR. The deep animosity it feels for Donald Trump, however \u2014 an animosity fed by the national media \u2014 may be unique in recent times. And when Donald Trump talks about the liberal media being active charter members of the Deep State, mortally opposed to his presidency and dedicated to bringing him down, it\u2019s not paranoid raving we\u2019re listening to.\n\nEarlier this year, just to help to help things along, editors at The New York Times drew up and printed a model of the Articles of Impeachment that the House might use if the occasion arose. And hoping to ensure it will arise, The New York Times now devotes the bulk of its news and editorial sections to full-bodied attacks on whatever current flavor-of-the-week charges are being leveled against the president.\n\nAmong The Times people without whom his book wouldn\u2019t have been possible, Mr. Stewart singles out for special thanks Executive Editor Dean Banquet, who was recently in the news himself because of the leaked proceedings of a New York Times meeting of staffers, quoting him saying that destroying Donald Trump by focusing its editorial resources on the Russian-collusion story for two years had been the central objective of the paper. \u201cWe built our newsroom to cover one story, and we did it truly well.\u201d\n\nBut with the release of the Mueller report, it was apparent that The New York Times editorial policy had failed. It had failed in large part because of a lack of truth and probity. And in fact, that failure was a stunning news story in its own right, but not a story the mainstream media was interested in following up on, any more than they\u2019re inclined to follow up on, say, Hillary Clinton\u2019s near-lunatic ravings about Tulsi Gabbard being a \u201cRussian asset.\u201d\n\nBut if you don\u2019t succeed, then try again. And that, in effect, is what Mr. Stewart apparently set out to do here. He begins with James Comey, the somewhat eccentric former FBI director, who told a Senate committee that \u201cthe nature of the FBI and the nature of its work require that it not be the subject of political consideration,\u201d but had made it just that.\n\nMr. Stewart then takes us through the several years of charges and countercharges, introducing us to a strange assortment of supporting actors, and concludes the bulk of his text with the arrival of the Mueller report at the Justice Department.\n\nSaid The New York Times\u2019 Dean Baquet: \u201cOur readers who want Donald Trump to go away suddenly thought, \u2018Holy s**t, Bob Mueller is not going to do it.\u201d Nor will this streamlined version, complete with snappy dialogue, do it \u2014 not even if they set it to music.\n\n\u2022 John R. Coyne Jr., a former White House speechwriter, is co-author of \u201cStrictly Right: William F. Buckley Jr. and the American Conservative Movement\u201d (Wiley).\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nDEEP STATE: TRUMP, THE FBI, AND THE RULE OF LAW\n\nBy James B.
