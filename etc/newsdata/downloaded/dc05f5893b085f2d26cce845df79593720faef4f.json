Lets teach confidence and body positivity without this type of an image...Amanda I like you girl but this is a bit too much,\u201d wrote one commenter on Stanton\u2019s post while many others echoed the sentiment.\n\n\u201cUmmm I\u2019m not sure how I feel about this picture. I mean it\u2019s adorable for you to enjoy but sadly we live in a sick world. I don\u2019t think I would go posting it on the internet. \ud83d\ude2c,\u201d said another user.\n\nHowever, Stanton was quick to defend her actions when Internet trolls slammed her for sharing the snap to social media.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t control what a sick person might be thinking. We were at the beach today and there were kids running around naked,\u201d Stanton wrote in a comments section of her post.\u201d People post photos of their kids in the bath or at the pool, etc. I understand there are sick people out there, and I do everything in my power to protect my kids and keep them safe, but I can\u2019t let it take over my life to the point where I\u2019m scared to post a cute photo of them in a bathing suit.\u201d\n\n'BACHELOR' CREATOR MIKE FLEISS ACCUSED OF ATTACKING PREGNANT WIFE, DEMANDING SHE GET ABORTION: DOCS\n\nFans of the divorced mother jumped to her defense, adding their own opinions to the discussion.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s precious and just pretending to be like mommy and her friends. There is nothing wrong with this photo except the comments section,\u201d wrote another commenter.\n\nGET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cSo according to the comments, every parent should live their lives around the potential creeps out there? She\u2019s a child going to the beach. If you turn it into something more, maybe you\u2019re the one with the issue!\u201d added a different commenter.\n\nThe reality star and recent author said her daughter already has \u201cbetter mirror skills\u201d than she does.
