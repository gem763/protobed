He was later moved to run a larger national park.\n\nIn April this year divers found a burnt fragment of Billy's skull stuffed in an oil drum in a reservoir inside the park, giving relatives their first confirmation of his death.\n\nSurrounded by their five children, Billy's wife Pinnapha Phrueksapan wiped away tears away at a sombre commemoration ceremony in Bangkok of her husband's life.\n\nShe described the \"very difficult\" years since his disappearance, telling mourners \"we are like a house without a main pillar\".\n\n\"I want to tell the authorities... not to bully people without power. You (Thai authorities) detained Billy but didn't send him through normal procedures and then he disappeared,\" she said, her voice shaking.\n\n\"You used rules for dogs, not laws for humans.\"\n\nThe Karen are an ethnic minority from eastern Myanmar many of whom fled military abuses for neighbouring Thailand.\n\nPinnapha said she now hoped justice would be served.\n\nThe Department of Special Investigations -- the Thai equivalent of the FBI -- this month ruled the case a murder and vowed to arrest those responsible.\n\nA DSI official said they were still gathering evidence \"which will take a while\" before any charges can be brought.\n\nRights groups say Billy's case sweeps across several problems plaguing activists in Thailand, including forced disappearances, environmental destruction and the rights of indigenous groups.", "description": "The wife of a murdered activist whose charred remains were found dumped in a Thai reservoir led an emotional memorial Monday, saying their five young children had been left bereft by his death.
