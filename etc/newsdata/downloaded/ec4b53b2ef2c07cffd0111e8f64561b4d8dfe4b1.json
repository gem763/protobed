In the skies, Syrian and Russian warplanes are ever-present, carrying out bombing raids to help the government of President Bashar al-Assad recapture Idlib, Syria\u2019s last rebel-held bastion.\n\nObservation posts manned by Turkish soldiers dot the province. Three million people live or shelter there, in a place only slightly larger than Delaware and nearly impossible to escape.\n\nSubscribe to the Post Most newsletter: Today\u2019s most popular stories on The Washington Post\n\nIt is unclear how long Baghdadi had been in Idlib or what he was doing there. But the province where he died \u2014 with its refugee camps, its front lines, its unshakable sense of dread \u2014 stands as a stark reminder of the misery and threats still radiating from Syria\u2019s civil war.\n\nWestern intelligence agencies are nervously monitoring the fighting in Idlib, which has become a proving ground for a new generation of extremists, in a war that has already bred thousands of hardened militants.\n\nSince late April, the Syrian government\u2019s offensive to retake the rebel-held territory has killed or injured more than a thousand civilians, according to the United Nations and human rights groups. More than 500,000 have fled the fighting in southern Idlib and neighboring Hama province. Syrian and Russian warplanes have bombed hospitals and schools.\n\nResidents are left facing terrifying possibilities: the government\u2019s military advance or the growing dominance of extremist rebels. People \u201cdo not have the option of picking who will take over or who won\u2019t \u2014 they just want to stay alive,\u201d said a political activist in Idlib. \u201cIt\u2019s all bombardment and strikes and killing and death.\u201d\n\nIdlib is largely controlled by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a militant group that began as Syria\u2019s al-Qaeda affiliate but reinvented itself several times during the civil war. HTS declared it was no longer affiliated with al-Qaeda in 2018. More-extreme Islamist militants left the group to form a smaller, hard-line faction, Hurras al-Din, which is the new al-Qaeda affiliate.\n\nThe Islamic State has a low-key presence in Idlib as well, with its fighters forming \u201csleeper cells\u201d in the province, according to Dareen Khalifa, a Syria analyst with the International Crisis Group, who visited Idlib a few months ago.\n\nThere was no obvious reason Baghdadi would have felt safe in Idlib, she added. The Islamic State had been targeted in raids carried out by HTS and was seen as an adversary by other militant groups, including Hurras al-Din.\n\nHow Baghdadi got to Idlib was not immediately clear. The province is surrounded by areas held by the Syrian or Turkish governments. A Turkish official said it appeared that Baghdadi had been in the area for at least 48 hours. A U.S. official said he had been there for \u201ca while.\u201d\n\nIn the area where he was found, control was divided between HTS, al-Qaeda-affiliated groups and Turkish-supported opposition, a senior State Department official said.\n\nSome feared that Baghdadi\u2019s killing might actually make life harder for people in Idlib, by focusing attention on the border area near Turkey where he was cornered and killed, in a village called Barisha.\n\nBaghdadi\u2019s death \u201ccreates another type of horror for people,\u201d said the activist in Idlib, referring to the possibility that the U.S. operation could lead to follow-up raids or factional fighting in an area just a few miles from one of Idlib\u2019s largest camps for displaced people.\n\n\u201cIf Baghdadi was in the area, then the whole area is in danger,\u201d said the activist, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of fears of retaliation from the militant groups.\n\nThe violence and insecurity in Idlib show the challenges that remain even as a group of regional powers, including Syria, Iran, Russia and Turkey, are nominally cooperating in an effort to end Syria\u2019s conflict.\n\n\u00a9 Abdulaziz Ketaz/Afp Via Getty Images Smoke billows after a reported Russian airstrike in the south of the northwestern Syrian province of Idlib near the village of Rakya, on Oct. 24.\n\nAssad\u2019s government forces are seeking to recapture the province as part of an effort to reestablish authority across the fractured country. Turkey, which is allied with Syrian rebel groups, has tried to prevent the Syrian offensive, fearing that it would send millions of refugees \u2014 as well as militants \u2014 surging across its border.\n\nU.S. officials are alarmed at the growing sway of extremist groups but have also strongly opposed any Syrian government offensive against those groups \u2014 fearing that it would cause a new refu\u00adgee exodus and that Assad\u2019s government would use chemical weapons as part of its offensive, the State Department official said.\n\n\u201cWhere we have conducted . . . anti-terrorist operations in Idlib, [it\u2019s] because we\u2019ve had very important targets,\u201d a senior State Department official said. But even if the province contained tens of thousands of \u201cterrorists,\u201d he added, \u201cthat\u2019s no reason to attack 3 million refugees and drive them into Turkey and Europe.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump, who has tried to reduce the U.S. role in Syria\u2019s conflict, including by withdrawing some troops from the country, has tweeted about Idlib on several occasions. \u201cHearing word that Russia, Syria and, to a lesser extent, Iran, are bombing the hell out of Idlib Province in Syria,\u201d he wrote in June. \u201cWhat is the purpose, what will it get you? STOP!\u201d\n\nSince the government offensive intensified last spring, a shaky cease-fire has reduced the violence somewhat without solving the puzzle of Idlib\u2019s future. The key player is Russia, which is trying to balance the demands of its Syrian and Turkish allies.\n\nAlthough Russia had provided military backing for Syria\u2019s offensive, Moscow might eventually be able to live with a portion of the province controlled by HTS, as long as such an area was \u201ccontained and protected by Turkey,\u201d said Khalifa of the International Crisis Group.\n\nBut Syria had been unwavering in its demand that Idlib be returned to its control. Turkey had been just as determined to prevent an all-out offensive.\n\n\u201cIdlib is a huge interest for Turkey. There are 3 million residents, and thousands of jihadis they don\u2019t want coming their way,\u201d Khalifa said.\n\nkareem.fahim@washpost.com\n\nsarah.dadouch@washpost.com\n\nAsser Khattab in Beirut, and Karen DeYoung and Ellen Nakashima in Washington, contributed to this report.", "description": "Idlib is a reminder of threats still radiating from the country\u2019s civil war", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAJuVy0.img?h=186&w=300&m=6&q=60&o=f&l=f", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
