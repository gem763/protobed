Even multiplatinum-selling rapper Jay-Z once rhymed on \u201cCan I Live\u201d: \u201cNo more Big Willie, my game has grown. Prefer you call me William. Illin for the revenues, Rayful Edmond-like. Channel 7 news, round seven jewels, head dead on the mic.\u201d\n\nBut what was largely unknown, was that Edmond was doing something often frowned upon by those in the streets: cooperating with federal prosecutors in the hope he might someday walk free, also known as snitchin\u2019 in Edmond\u2019s world.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn Wednesday, Edmond will return for the first time in 17 years to his hometown, where authorities say his army of dealers sold $20 crack rocks, contributing to addiction and rising crime that devastated the city.\n\nDuring at least two days of hearings in federal court in the District, Edmond and his attorney plan to lay out why they believe Edmond\u2019s 20 years of cooperating should result in his life-without-parole sentence being squashed. Edmond, now 54, is expected to take the witness stand to describe how he has spent much of his time behind bars in fear for his life because he has been threatened for helping authorities.\n\nEdmond was sentenced to life without parole in 1990 after being convicted of federal drug distribution in a reign that lasted from 1985 until his arrest in spring 1989. Then in February, federal prosecutors made a startling move, asking a federal judge to reduce Edmond\u2019s punishment in exchange for his help on homicide cases and hundreds of drug cases. They later called for Edmond\u2019s life sentence to be reduced to 40 years.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEdmond\u2019s attorney, Jason Downs, a former D.C. public defender, argues Edmonds deserves \u2014 and that prosecutors led him to believe the government would seek \u2014 a sentence of time served.\n\nU.S. District Judge Emmet G. Sullivan, a District native himself, will make the final decision about Edmond\u2019s case. Sullivan will consider the years and type of cooperation Edmond provided to prosecutors and the impact of the massive drug ring he ran throughout the city.\n\nDowns declined to comment publicly about his client\u2019s case. But in recent court filings, Downs offered new details about the depth of Edmond\u2019s cooperation. He said Edmond provided intel that helped prosecutors obtain wiretap affidavits leading to the convictions of more than 100 individuals in drug cases.\n\nAD\n\nEdmond testified in two trials and also provided information to D.C. detectives investigating 20 cold case homicides, Downs wrote. Court papers say Edmond spoke monthly to a prosecutor who was his key contact. Although prosecutors said that information did not result in arrests, they said it allowed detectives to determine which suspects may have had motives and to eliminate other suspects. That cooperation continued through 2014.\n\nAD\n\nEdmond, who was convicted of drug dealing in a Pennsylvania prison after he was sentenced for his crimes in the District, also worked with the Office of the Inspector General to help the Bureau of Prisons overhaul its inmate telephone system and visitation policies to prevent others from drug dealing in prison, Downs said. Edmond\u2019s 30-year sentence in Pennsylvania begins after his D.C. prison term ends.\n\nAfter Edmond\u2019s first meeting with prosecutors, Downs wrote, \u201cgovernment officials recognized that his cooperation would constitute the intelligence coup of the decade \u2014 perhaps of the century.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBut in a filing, Assistant U.S. Attorney John Crabb Jr. wrote that while Edmond\u2019s information was helpful, it was not as vital as Edmond or his attorney argue.\n\n\u201cWhile the defendant\u2019s cooperation was successful and he is deserving of a sentencing reduction, he engages in hyperbole when he characterizes his cooperation as \u2018unprecedented\u2019, \u2018unparalleled\u2019 and \u2018the intelligence coup of the decade \u2014 perhaps of the century,\u2019 \u201d Crabb wrote.\n\nAD\n\nTo aid him in making his decision, Sullivan in May asked the District\u2019s Attorney General Karl A. Racine to survey residents about Edmond\u2019s proposed early release. About 500 people responded. Half thought Edmond had spent enough time in prison for nonviolent offenses. The other half, some citing the devastating impact of cocaine on the city, said he should serve out his life term.\n\nAD\n\nEdmond was linked to as many as 30 slayings during that period of record-high homicides but was never convicted of any murders.\n\nWith Edmond set to testify, security in Sullivan\u2019s courtroom Wednesday is expected to be heightened.\n\nThe last time Edmond was in Washington was in 2002. At that time, he was a key witness in the trial of his onetime protegee Rodney Moore, who was charged with ordering or carrying out 12 killings as part of his own drug operation. Edmond testified behind bulletproof glass. A jury later found Moore and co-defendant, Kevin Gray guilty of murder charges. Both were sentenced to multiple, life prison sentences.\n\nAD\n\nIn May, Edmond appeared in court for a hearing in his resentencing via closed circuit TV. Wearing a prison jumpsuit and with a receding hairline, Edmond was slightly heavier compared to his lean, basketball-player build pre-arrest. His mother, siblings and other family members sat in the courtroom, blowing kisses as Edmond flashed his large smile and blew kisses back.\n\nAD\n\nEdmond is now in a federal witness protection program in an undisclosed facility. Should he be released, he would remain in witness protection, Downs has said.\n\nOne key witness for Downs in the hearing could be Assistant U.S. Attorney John P. Dominguez, the prosecutor who Downs says told Edmond \u2014 in writing \u2014 that he would seek a sentence of time served. Downs contends the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office, which has removed Dominguez from Edmond\u2019s case, is reneging on that promise.\n\nAD\n\nProsecutors deny Dominguez ever promised time served. In a filing last week, Crabb wrote that during his conversations with Edmond, Dominguez \u201cmade it clear that he was expressing his personal views and that he was not empowered to make the ultimate sentencing recommendation.\u201d Crabb went on to add, \u201caccordingly, contrary to the defendant\u2019s claim, the government\u2019s position regarding sentencing in this matter has never changed.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nEdmond and Dominguez, Downs wrote, started working together on cases in 1994. It was then when Edmond obtained his first deal from prosecutors. In exchange for his cooperation on other drug cases, Edmond\u2019s mother, Constance \u201cBootsie\u201d Perry, now 78, who worked in her son\u2019s drug empire, was released nine years into her 14-year prison sentence.\n\nIn a three-page memo attached to Crabb\u2019s filing, Dominguez confirmed that Edmond\u2019s cooperation was used to help obtain wiretaps that resulted in 12 federal indictments in drug dealings involving more than 100 defendants.\n\nAD\n\nIn his filing, Downs said two witnesses are expected to tell the judge how Edmond, while incarcerated, brokered a truce between two rival gangs in the Simple City neighborhood of Southeast Washington.\n\nAD\n\nTwo other people, who Downs said are Edmond\u2019s childhood friends, are expected to testify about how they are prepared to help Edmond transition back to society if he is released.", "description": "Prosecutors say Edmond, who is serving a life sentence, helped put other drug dealers in prison.", "authors": ["Keith L.
