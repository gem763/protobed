The photo was taken during an \u201cArabian Nights\u201d-themed gala and appeared in the West Point Grey Academy's 2001 yearbook, a private day school where Trudeau was a teacher, TIME Magazine reported.\n\nTrudeau's identity was confirmed by Zita Astravas, the media relations lead of the Liberal Party of Canada, the party Trudeau is apart of.\n\n\u201cIt was a photo taken while he was teaching in Vancouver, at the school\u2019s annual dinner which had a costume theme of \u2018Arabian Nights.' He attended with friends and colleagues dressed as a character from Aladdin,\u201d Astravas said.\n\nFrom TIME:\n\nTIME reached out to multiple people who attended West Point Grey\u2019s spring gala in 2001, including three of the four women in the photo with Trudeau. Most were reluctant to talk about it. One former staff member declined to comment, citing loyalty to Trudeau. Others said they did not remember Trudeau at the party. Two people contacted by TIME acknowledged the existence of the picture, which has been the subject of gossip within the West Point Grey community. Trudeau was not the only person in costume at the 2001 gala event. Of the individuals in six photographs from the event published in the yearbook, Trudeau appears to be the only one who darkened his skin. Many who dressed up for the \u201cArabian Nights\u201d gala are still at the school, including current headmaster Stephen Anthony, who is pictured wearing what appears to be a crown.\n\nTrudeau apologized for the photo.\n\n\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have done that. I should have known better and I didn\u2019t. I\u2019m really sorry.,\" he said.\n\n\u201cYes it was,\" he said, in response to reporters asking if he thought the photo was racist. \"I didn\u2019t consider it racist at the time, but now we know better.\u201d", "description": "Wow..09/19/2019 1:58:13AM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/93/9d5202c8-a723-4995-9a8d-174a474b53cd.png", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
