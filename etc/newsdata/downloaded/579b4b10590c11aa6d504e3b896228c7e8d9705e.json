Without a home address, people don't receive voter cards in the mail, which inform them of where their polling station is located. In addition, voters are required to show proof of address when they arrive to cast their ballot.\n\nHomeless people often don't have ID, which can be stolen from them on the streets but is required to vote, Gaetz said.\n\nShelters can provide proof of address\n\nIn an email to CBC News, Elections Canada said it has been taking steps to remove some of these obstacles.\n\n\"The mandate of Elections Canada is to ensure that Canadians can exercise their right to vote,\" the email said. \"We encourage all eligible electors who are homeless or who have no fixed address to register and vote.\"\n\nEach electoral district \"may retain the services of a community relations officer who is specifically assigned to reaching out to people who are homeless,\" Elections Canada said. Those officers are tasked with providing information to homeless shelters and other community organizations about how to register and vote.\n\nShelters \u2014 including this 62-bed facility in Thunder Bay \u2014 can serve as an address for homeless people living there who want to vote in Canadian elections. (Nicole Ireland/CBC)\n\nElections Canada also provides shelters with a \"letter of confirmation of residence\" that administrators can give to \"anyone who has gone to a shelter for food or lodging.\" That letter allows people who are homeless to use the shelter's address \u2014 and they can then vote at the polling station for the area in which the shelter is located.\n\nIn addition to that letter, voters also require a piece of ID that has their name on it, Elections Canada said, but there are several forms that can be used beyond driver's licences, passports and birth certificates. Other acceptable forms of ID include fishing licences, library cards, social insurance cards, health cards, Veterans Affairs Canada Health Care Identification Cards, First Nations band membership cards, M\u00e9tis cards, hospital cards and several others.\n\nIf someone has no ID at all, Elections Canada said, they can declare their name and address in writing and have someone who knows them vouch for their identity.\n\nThe ability to vouch for a voter was reinstated when the Elections Modernization Act was passed in 2018, introduced by the Liberal government. Vouching had been disallowed by the Fair Elections Act passed by the previous Conservative government, so that option was not available in the 2015 federal election.\n\nBut under the current legislation, the value of vouching to help people who are homeless to vote is still limited. The person vouching has to be assigned to the same polling station as the person who doesn't have ID. In addition, an individual can only vouch for one person. The exception, according to Elections Canada, is long-term care institutions, in which staff can vouch for multiple residents. Shelters do not have that authority.\n\n'They might think ... we're nobody'\n\n\"It's not easy to vote when you're here. It's not easy to do a lot of things when you're here,\" said Katherine Grimard, who started living at Shelter House in Thunder Bay, Ont., after separating from her husband about four months ago.\n\nThe emergency homeless shelter, which houses men, women and youth in separate dorms, is routinely over its 62-bed capacity \u2014 meaning there will likely be dozens of eligible voters staying there on Oct. 21, election day.\n\nBut many of them won't vote \u2014 not just because of logistical barriers, but also due to mobility issues, Gaetz said. In addition, the stigma facing people who are homeless makes many feel unwelcome in society, including at polling stations, he said.\n\n\"People who are homeless are used to being excluded from public and semi-public places ... so that becomes a barrier,\" he said.\n\nGrimard said she feels \"a lot of judging and people that look at you differently\" wherever she goes. But she says she won't let the stigma stop her from voting.\n\nAs for others staying in the shelter who say they aren't going to vote, \"I think that they're just used to not being heard,\" she said. \"So \u2026 that's what they think is going to happen again.\"\n\nHaving the local political candidates come to the shelter as they're campaigning \u2014 just as they knock on other people's doors \u2014 would help address that perception, Grimard said.\n\n\"It would be nice if they came around,\" she said. \"That would be cool.\"\n\nChris Bristo, who worked as a miner before being laid off and said he has lived at Shelter House for a long time, agrees.\n\n\"They might think that because we're in the shelter ... we're nobody. They might wonder if it's worth the trouble to access our vote,\" he said.\n\n\"Just because a person is going through hard times doesn't mean their vote's not worth getting,\" Bristo said.\n\nAfter being contacted by CBC News, most of the candidates running in Shelter House's riding of Thunder Bay-Rainy River expressed interest in going to the facility. However, only NDP candidate Yuk-Sem Won had a definite plan: to visit on Thanksgiving weekend and set up an information booth about how and where to vote.\n\n'So important for them to be heard'\n\nAt least one Canadian shelter has shown that it's possible to make the election \u2014 both the campaign period and voting day itself \u2014 more accessible to people who are homeless.\n\nThe Calgary Drop-In & Rehab Centre, also known as The DI, is bringing in the riding's candidates to meet clients, provide information, and answer their questions \u2014 something it also did in the 2015 federal election, as well as the Alberta provincial election earlier this year.\n\n\"It's having the candidates here and coming to a place where our clientele feel most comfortable,\" said Jeff Schoen, the centre's senior co-ordinator of emergency shelter.\n\nThe Calgary Drop-In & Rehab Centre is continuing a program it started during the 2015 federal election campaign to help make voting a more comfortable experience for people who are homeless. (CBC)\n\nWorking with Elections Canada, the Calgary centre is setting up a polling station so people can vote right on site. That's a program it started in the 2015 federal election, then repeated for the Alberta election.\n\n\"It's important ... having these polling stations accessible to those individuals,\" Schoen said.\n\nBased on the turnout for the provincial vote, he estimates 200 people from the shelter will cast their ballots in the federal election.\n\n\"A lot of times they don't have the opportunity to have a voice in their day-to-day lives,\" he said.\n\n\"It's so important for them to be heard.\"", "description": "Not having ID, feeling unwelcome in polling stations and having limited access to candidates are barriers standing between homeless people and the ballot box \u2014 but there are solutions, experts say.", "authors": ["Nicole Ireland Is A Cbc News Journalist With A Special Interest In Health", "Social Justice Stories.
