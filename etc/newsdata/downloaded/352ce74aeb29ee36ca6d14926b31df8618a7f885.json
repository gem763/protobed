The reason the faction of Senzo Mchunu won in KZN is Dali. Free State is Dali. All the ANC battles is Dali that won them. But by law he can\u2019t represent the EFF,\u201d argued Sedibe.\n\n\n\nHe mentioned this in a branch meeting, during a selection of delegates meeting in Mpumalanga that will represent the province in the elective conference in December.\n\nOn the video Sedibe admits to suggesting that the position be taken from Mpofu and given to Mente.\n\nHe said Mpofu was asked in a \u201cgood spirit\u201d to down as his \u201cservices are requested outside the party\u201d.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe request the chairperson to step down, his services are requested outside.
