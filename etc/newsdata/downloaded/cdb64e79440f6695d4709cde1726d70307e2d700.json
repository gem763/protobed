Max Rose, one of the few House Democrats who has not endorsed an impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, one must first understand a few other anomalies.\n\n\n\nThere is the anomaly of Staten Island, the lone stronghold of conservatism within deep blue New York City, and the heart of Rose\u2019s district.\n\n\n\nThere is the anomaly of Rose himself, whose victory last year made him just the second Democrat to represent Staten Island in Congress in more than 30 years.\n\n\n\nAll of which leads to the third and current anomaly: Rose\u2019s refusal to back impeachment, amid revelations that Trump asked the president of Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, even as most other Democrats in vulnerable seats have signed on.\n\n\n\nWhen seven moderate House members with backgrounds in the military or intelligence or defense communities wrote an opinion piece in The Washington Post declaring their openness to impeachment, Rose, an Army veteran, was not one of them.\n\n\n\nInstead, Rose has issued two noncommittal statements. On Tuesday, he reaffirmed his long-standing opposition to impeachment, even as he said that the whistleblower\u2019s allegations meant that \u201call options must be on the table.\u201d And on Friday, Rose said that \u201cthe story is far from over,\u201d and that \u201cunder no circumstances\u201d would he \u201callow politics to influence my decision regarding this matter.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is a sad day for America,\u201d Rose told reporters at the Capitol on Friday. \u201cThis is not something that anybody should be luxuriating in. This is not something that anybody should be celebrating. And certainly this is not something that anybody should be dismissing solely because it\u2019s a Republican president.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe continued, \u201cThe last thing I will ever do is base any decision that I make, or any speed with which I make that decision, off of political calculation.\u201d\n\n\n\nOf course, that equivocation has ensured that Rose\u2019s political calculations are all anyone wants to talk about. Democratic activists have accused Rose of putting his own reelection above his duties as a congressman; some have spoken of recruiting a primary challenger. Republicans have assailed Rose for trying to avoid the accountability that comes with a firm position.\n\n\n\nAnother first-term Democrat from New York, Rep. Anthony Brindisi, has also avoided taking a firm stance on impeachment. Brindisi, who represents Central New York, defeated the Republican incumbent, Claudia Tenney, by a little more than 4,000 votes last year.\n\n\n\nBut Rose has so far received far more attention for his wavering position, including from the president.\n\n\n\nOn Friday, Trump reposted an attack ad against Rose on Twitter, which had been shared by the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee. The ad declared that Rose wanted \u201cendless investigations.\u201d On Sunday morning, the president shared the ad again, this time adding his own commentary: \u201cWe will win big,\u201d the president wrote, singling out those seeking impeachment in \u201cTrump type districts.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe result is that, for all Rose\u2019s attempts to distance himself from the impeachment inquiry, his district may be a prime laboratory for one of the biggest questions it has created: Will the Democrats\u2019 about-face, after months of putting off impeachment, help or hurt them in 2020?\n\n\n\nRose\u2019s district is particularly well suited for such a test: Trump defeated Hillary Clinton there in 2016 with 58% of the vote. His support was even more resounding in the primary election: There, Trump captured 82% of the vote against his fellow Republicans.\n\n\n\nBut the district has occasionally supported Democrats. In 2012, President Barack Obama narrowly won Staten Island. And last year, Rose defeated the Republican incumbent, Dan Donovan, by almost 7 points, or about 12,000 votes, buoyed by the more liberal enclaves on Staten Island\u2019s North Shore, as well as the southern rim of Brooklyn, which makes up a slice of the district.\n\n\n\nThe challenge facing Rose was apparent on Friday afternoon, on Forest Avenue in West Brighton, a neighborhood of Staten Island that split roughly evenly between Rose and Donovan.\n\n\n\nMarguerite Rivas, a professor at the Borough of Manhattan Community College, said she had voted for Rose and was disappointed with his careful approach. But she accepted it so long as his vote was not needed for impeachment. (So far, 225 House members have backed an impeachment inquiry, more than the simple majority required to impeach.)\n\n\n\n\u201cI would rather he play to the middle and get reelected as a Democrat,\u201d Rivas said as she left Kings Arms Diner.\n\n\n\nAsked if she thought a more aggressive tack from Rose would cost him his seat, Rivas, a lifelong Staten Island resident, did not hesitate.\n\n\n\n\u201cYes, yes I do,\u201d she said.\n\nHer view was seemingly affirmed at Jody\u2019s Club Forest, an Irish restaurant, where a few men were scattered around the bar. Greeted by a reporter, they immediately demurred.\n\n\n\nBut, asked again, one man relented. \u201cWant to step outside?\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is Staten Island,\u201d the man, Arthur Alinovi, explained outside. \u201cThey\u2019d probably hate me.\u201d\n\n\n\nAlinovi, now retired from a job at a bank, also voted for Rose. He said he was disappointed in what he perceived as Rose\u2019s preoccupation with holding onto his seat.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere are more things in life than being a senator or congressman,\u201d Alinovi said.\n\n\n\nStill, Alinovi said Rose\u2019s hesitation was not likely to make him change his vote.\n\n\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t vote for a Republican if my life depended on it,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nNext door, at Liberty Tavern, Junior Barone was similarly immovable \u2014 but in the other direction.\n\n\n\nBarone, 70, a retired police officer, said he had met Rose during the campaign, when Rose visited the tavern. Barone had bought him a drink and invited him to chat; he found him likable. And, he said, he agreed with Rose\u2019s call for more information on the impeachment inquiry.\n\n\n\nBut Barone, a staunch supporter of Trump, said that would not sway him to vote for Rose. \u201cI like him,\u201d Barone said. \u201cThe only thing I don\u2019t like about him is he\u2019s a Democrat.\u201d\n\n\n\nJay Jacobs, the state\u2019s Democratic Party chairman, said he respected Rose\u2019s and Brindisi\u2019s decisions, even if he believed those views might soon change.\n\n\n\n\u201cEvery member has to represent their own unique districts in the way that those districts will support,\u201d Jacobs said. \u201cI have no doubt that when all of the evidence is in, much like the overwhelming majority of the entire nation, both Rose and Brindisi will be where they should be to support and defend our Constitution. How they get there and why they get there will all be irrelevant.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut others were less forgiving.\n\n\n\nAmong progressive activist groups, including the ones that powered Rose\u2019s victory last year, displeasure has turned to planning. Sally McMahon, a founder of Fight Back Bay Ridge, an activist group in southern Brooklyn, said Rose seemed overly focused on appealing to Republicans on Staten Island, at the cost of preserving support among progressives in Brooklyn. The district\u2019s Brooklyn neighborhoods accounted for most of Rose\u2019s margin of victory.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf he does not come out for impeachment, I have a write-in candidate,\u201d McMahon said.\n\n\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times. \u00a9 2019 The New York Times Company", "description": "NEW YORK -- To understand the anomaly of Rep.
