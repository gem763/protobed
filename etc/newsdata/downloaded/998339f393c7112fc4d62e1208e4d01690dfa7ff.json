Many end up broke, living in hotels, defamed, (often) divorced, and lucky if they have any kind of job. One I knew got turned down for a waitressing job because her previous employer wouldn\u2019t vouch for her. She had little kids.\n\nThe common thread in whistleblower stories is loneliness. Typically the employer has direct control over their ability to pursue another job in their profession. Many end up reviled as traitors, thieves, and liars. They often discover after going public that their loved ones have a limited appetite for sharing the ignominy. In virtually all cases, they end up having to start over, both personally and professionally\u2026\n\nActual whistleblowers are alone. The Ukraine complaint seems to be the work of a group of people, supported by significant institutional power, not only in the intelligence community, but in the Democratic Party and the commercial press.\n\nIn this century we\u2019ve lived through a president lying to get us into a war (that caused hundreds of thousands of deaths and the loss of trillions in public treasure), the deployment of a vast illegal surveillance program, a drone assassination campaign, rendition, torture, extralegal detention, and other offenses, many of them mass human rights violations.\n\nWe had whistleblowers telling us about nearly all of these things. When they came forward, they desperately needed society\u2019s help. They didn\u2019t get it. Our government didn\u2019t just tweet threats at them, but proceeded straight to punishment.", "description": "", "authors": ["Matt Taibbi", "Rollingstone.Com Politics Political-Commentary"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
