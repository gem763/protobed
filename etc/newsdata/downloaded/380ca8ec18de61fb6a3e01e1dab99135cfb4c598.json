We must stand up for Democracy & The Rule of Law. \u2014 Rob Reiner (@robreiner) September 20, 2019\n\nAnd instead of impeachment, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi issued this very stern statement warning Trump of \u201cserious repercussions\u201d:\n\nPelosi issues lengthy statement on the whistleblower complaint: \u201cIf the President has done what has been alleged, then he is stepping into a dangerous minefield with serious repercussions for his Administration and our democracy.\u201d pic.twitter.com/JMZJs0E2Aq \u2014 Andrew Desiderio (@AndrewDesiderio) September 20, 2019\n\nThe serious repercussions were not named, however:\n\nBut, and many Dems are asking each other this, what does \u201cserious repercussions\u201d actually mean? Last week Pelosi notably avoided the word \u201cimpeachment\u201d and only took a few questions on it at her press conference. Dems told me Ukraine was the hot topic during votes today. \u2014 Heather Caygle (@heatherscope) September 20, 2019\n\nShe followed up the stern statement with an equally stern tweet:\n\nThe Trump Admin is clearly violating federal statute by blocking the head of US Intelligence from providing Congress with a whistleblower complaint described as being of \"urgent concern & credible.\u201d The stonewalling must end. What is the President hiding? https://t.co/Yg0LqT5HMd \u2014 Nancy Pelosi (@SpeakerPelosi) September 20, 2019\n\nAnd she\u2019s losing her base:\n\nFrankly, this is not a response that inspires confidence nor one that reflects the gravity of the situation. https://t.co/BwYVmwgzDE \u2014 Susan Hennessey (@Susan_Hennessey) September 20, 2019\n\nLOL: \u201cdo YOUR job\u201d:\n\nOkay, super. Now stop asking ME to do YOUR job a year from now and impeach this idiot. https://t.co/th3AYwS2mL \u2014 Bob Chipman (@the_moviebob) September 20, 2019\n\nJust say \u201cimpeachment,\u201d Nancy. It\u2019s not that scary:\n\nPelosi's statement uses the word \"must\" three times but the word \"impeachment\" doesn't appear at all https://t.co/1m2LkUUUnV \u2014 Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) September 20, 2019\n\nBut, wait! It gets funnier! Pelosi later said she would pass a law to hold Trump accountable, apparently missing the step where she\u2019d need to somehow trick Mitch McConnell and the president himself into signing her law:\n\nIn an exclusive interview with NPR, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says she has not changed her mind on pursuing impeachment, but is ready to change the law to restrain presidential power and to make it clear that a sitting president can, in fact, be indicted. https://t.co/YgCF5Za4vE pic.twitter.com/yNQ43BBkDE \u2014 NPR (@NPR) September 20, 2019\n\nAnd she\u2019s getting absolutely destroyed over it:\n\nIf @SpeakerPelosi doesn\u2019t publicly call for impeachment, before the clock strikes midnight, now with this clear cut news of smoking gun treason, she should switch parties & become the House @GOP minority leader before morning. \u2014 Fernand R. Amandi (@AmandiOnAir) September 20, 2019\n\nTrying to think what Trump would have to do for Pelosi or Schumer to think it deserves impeachment. Shoot somebody on 5th Avenue? Theyve become like his immovable supporters. \u2014 Ryan Grim (@ryangrim) September 20, 2019\n\nGetting #MoscowMitch to join with @SpeakerPelosi to create a new law to hold the president accountable for breaking many existing laws and numerous impeachable offenses? That deserves: \ud83e\udd84\ud83e\udd84\ud83e\udd84\ud83e\udd84\ud83e\udd84\n\n(5 out of 5 possible unicorns) \u2014 David Rothschild (@DavMicRot) September 20, 2019\n\nIn other words, \"I am not willing to take action against this lawless president, but I'm eager to strengthen the laws he's flouting once he's gone.\" https://t.co/ubDvPB1P4V \u2014 Angus Johnston (@studentactivism) September 20, 2019\n\nI am going to keep repeating this. Democratic leadership, led by Nancy Pelosi are drastically downplaying how much their cowardice can stifle enthusiasm among activists and active voters/volunteers. Why are they spending so much time canvassing/registering voters? For this? https://t.co/r4Hraphu9o \u2014 Erick Fernandez (@ErickFernandez) September 20, 2019\n\nwhy can't she stop talking https://t.co/CilQXB5vp6 \u2014 Elon Green (@elongreen) September 20, 2019\n\nit's cool that she doesn't worry about being effective. https://t.co/DNChpugwSd \u2014 Damian Holbrook (@damianholbrook) September 20, 2019\n\nOkay, but like, you know you need either Trump or McConnell to actually agree to change the law, and that ain't happening. So\u2026 you've got nothing. https://t.co/9CFAltan8T \u2014 Zack Ford (@ZackFord) September 20, 2019\n\nAdmin completely invalidated congressional oversight by defying subpoenas, refusing to turn over documents, issuing NDAs, barring gov and non-gov staff from testifying, and more. This is abdication of responsibility and seeking to overrule the OLC opinion way late into the game. https://t.co/G3deRlPRts \u2014 Matt Ortega (@MattOrtega) September 20, 2019\n\nThis piece includes Pelosi saying \"Right now they are breaking the law\" and her saying that House dems will \"follow the facts and the law\" om impeachment and ALSO her not changing her reluctance to pursue impeachment. I mean\u2026 https://t.co/czY6R7U7Cu \u2014 Kyle Orland (@KyleOrl) September 20, 2019\n\n***", "description": "\"5 out of 5 possible unicorns\"", "authors": ["Greg P.", "Posted At Pm On September"], "top_image": "https://twitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/pelosi-94f45e71-7722-4582-a641-7754458207f2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
