A woman has reportedly given birth alone in a prison cell, in the early hours of the morning. It is alleged that help wasn\u2019t summoned until 8.30am, when prison staff visited the cell and found the newborn \u201cunresponsive\u201d \u2013 the baby died. This shocking event, which sounds like something out of a Victorian novel, happened just over a week ago in Europe\u2019s largest female prison.\n\nNo matter what that woman was in prison for, she and her unborn child desperately needed medical treatment\n\nSurrey police have opened an investigation into the \u201cunexplained\u201d death at HMP Bronzefield, which can house up to 557 inmates and is operated by Sodexo Justice Services. Vicky Robinson, director of the prison, confirmed that a baby had died and they were supporting the mother. The prison was judged to be \u201coverwhelmingly safe\u201d by HM Inspectorate of Prisons as recently as February this year \u2013 but the report also acknowledged that the prison has an \u201cincreasingly challenging population\u201d, revealing that nearly 70% of prisoners at Bronzefield report having a mental health problem. Whether it is humane to lock up so many women with fragile mental health from 6.45 in the evening until 8am the following morning is an obvious question.\n\nThe prison\u2019s own action plan appears to acknowledge communication problems at the facility: it includes a requirement, which was due to be in place by July this year, that bells in prisoners\u2019 cells should be answered within five minutes by staff and that they should \u201cfully address\u201d the reason for each call.\n\nSo how was it possible for a woman in a late stage of pregnancy to go into labour, give birth in a cell and not come to the attention of prison staff for several hours? What that mother went through hardly bears thinking about but it intensifies previously expressed anxieties about the safety of pregnant women in the UK\u2019s understaffed and overstretched prison service. In November last year, a damning report warned that women were giving birth in prison cells without proper medical care. Dr Laura Abbott, a specialist midwife and senior lecturer at the University of Hertfordshire, described the experiences of women at three unnamed prisons in England, including an incident where an infant was premature and born feet-first, with no midwife present. Such births would normally be seen as an emergency; NHS England recommends against a vaginal delivery in cases where the baby is in the breech position.\n\nWomen make up a relatively small proportion of the prison population, around 5% of the total. The number of female inmates doubled between 1995 and 2010, and a rise in the number of female inmates of childbearing age inevitably increased the risk that some women would end up giving birth in prison. Yet ministers and prisons appear to have failed to take this unintended consequence into account.\n\nIt\u2019s been left to outside organisations, such as the charity Birth Companions, to raise the alarm. Its director, Naomi Delap, wrote to the prison service two years ago asking for urgent measures to protect pregnant prisoners and their babies. Now those warnings seem horribly prescient.\n\nThe Tories' tough talk on crime is shameless and cynical | The Secret Barrister Read more\n\nFemale prisoners are drawn from the most vulnerable sections of the population, with many inmates homeless at the time they are sentenced. According to the campaigning organisation Women in Prison, 39% report having a drugs problem and 24% an alcohol problem on arrival in prison. They are overwhelmingly in prison for non-violent offences such as theft but the majority (57%) have experienced domestic abuse, according to a report published by the Prison Reform Trust in 2017. By any objective standards, these women would be regarded by health professionals as needing a greater degree of support during their pregnancies than the general population.\n\nIt is more than two decades since Ann Widdecombe, then the Conservative prisons minister, was forced to deny it was Prison Service policy to keep women handcuffed during labour; Widdecombe\u2019s insistence that restraints are removed \u201cwhen labour is confirmed\u201d rightly caused an outcry back in 1996. Yet almost a quarter of a century later, a heavily pregnant female prisoner \u2013 by definition, one of the most vulnerable members of society \u2013 has apparently been left to give birth without assistance in a cell.\n\nNo matter what that woman was in prison for, she and her unborn child desperately needed medical treatment \u2013 and we are all entitled to an explanation of how such a tragedy was allowed to happen.\n\n\u2022 Joan Smith is a columnist, novelist and human rights activist", "description": "Why are such vulnerable women being abandoned, asks novelist and human rights activist Joan Smith", "authors": ["Joan Smith"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9ef4d23954c88a19506d0bd0b8a6cba040ac80b/0_125_5027_3017/master/5027.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=c73b253adfa6590ca9f805fbb6f2a86a", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
