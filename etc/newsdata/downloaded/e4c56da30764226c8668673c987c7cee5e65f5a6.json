A certain generation only saw their mothers be homebodies and make it their life purpose to feed their family, run the home and the big expression of love was the \u201cgaram-garam\u201d chappati\u2019s she lovingly turned out at mealtimes on a table she did not sit at while they ate. Times changed to women having careers and the home dynamics changed completely. It became about women multitasking roles of being both nurturer and provider as the old expectations still clung of women being responsible for their traditional role. The focus also shifted from quantity time to quality time and the wife sat at the table with the family. In today\u2019s generation, it\u2019s all about independence, individuality, equality and space. People are marrying later and having children even later\u2026sometimes in their 40\u2019s and for many in metropolitan cities the concept of marriage seems redundant and even scary (especially given that the pro-women laws, including dowry and abuse are being rampantly misused by women for extortion, revenge and personal gain). Economic pressures along with rising costs of education and lifestyle are deterring couples from having children. The new generation seems to want to enjoy their life on this planet free from any trappings of convention and excess responsibility. Of course, India is a country that is multi-tasking multiple centuries simultaneously given that there are still women in purdah and also women in bikini\u2019s living in one large democracy. But the trickle-down effect is already apparent, and across India women are a powerful force in every workplace. The concept of \u201cme time\u201d, separate sets of friends for couples, respect for individuality and time apart to pursue hobbies as well as professional journeys is no longer \u201cstrange and uncomfortable\u201d. In fact, it seems more and more that emerging urban relationships are increasingly basing togetherness on what does not bind and control them. There\u2019s a huge difference in \u201cbelonging\u201d and a \u201csense of ownership\u201d and this generation seems to have gotten that clear in many ways. They will not be dictated to as to when or whom to marry, when to have a kid and what sacrifices they need to make (especially women), to make a relationship work. Change is always uncomfortable, and even to view such changes in the dynamics between couples is disconcerting for many from a different generation or mindset. But the change is here, apparent, and working. The most important thing to always consider in a relationship, is to never emulate or judge the past generation or the dynamics of the current generation. The only thing you need to ask is \u201cWhat is it that works for you?\u201d and find it.\n\n1. I\u2019m 24 and working with an IT firm. Just last week, my former classmate proposed to me. I like him, but the problem is that he is in the merchant navy and is out sailing four months at least. I\u2019m not too sure if the long-distance relationship will work, especially since my parents have started looking for an alliance for me. What do I do?\n\nIt all depends on what you want from a partner. The obvious ones are love, honesty, friendship, compatibility, respect and attraction. But if all that is there, and you have a toss-up between quality time and quantity time\u2026. What will you choose? Time apart also gives you the ability to focus on your career and build it and when he gets back it is so much more intense and focussed time together. The only issue with your dilemma is that you like him, not love him and it seems you don\u2019t know him very well. Which also means you may get along far better with an alliance being sourced for you so tell him you\u2019d like a few months to think about a life-long decision, and keep all options open.\n\n2. I\u2019m in a complicated situation, which is also very filmi \u2014 I\u2019m in a relationship with a girl, who happens to be the daughter of a family friend, for the past five years. The twist came in the form of my uncle (dad\u2019s younger brother), who married her widowed mother a few months ago. She couldn\u2019t reveal to her mother at that point about our intention of getting married and now, she says we should go on our paths because technically, I\u2019m her brother! I\u2019m 29 and she is 26. Is it morally wrong for us marry?\n\nHahahahahahah! NO! it\u2019s definitely not morally wrong and there\u2019s nothing incestuous about it either. Only problem is that any issues with you both will make both families edgy and any issues with her mom and your uncle will have an effect on you and your wife. If that can be understood and some sort of solution found, there\u2019s no reason for it to not go forward from strength to strength.\n\n3. I am 27 and I am totally in love with a girl at my workplace. She is around nine years older than me. I have felt like this about her since the last one year \u2013 since she had never really reciprocated my interest, i feel that she does not care about me and so, i tried going out with younger women like she keeps telling me\u2026But this has not helped at all. She is the one for me i feel. Please help me \u2013 how can i convince her to be my girlfriend?\n\nApply, apply no reply! That simply means you\u2019re not the man for the job. You are making this about age, instead of focussing on compatibility with new partners. There are so many wonderful women out there and you\u2019re just in your twenties. Patience is a virtue, the right woman isn\u2019t just waiting outside your door, but she will come. The important thing is to ensure that you\u2019re not wasting time on what is just one sided or not meant for you.", "description": "As society evolves so does the nature of relationships.
