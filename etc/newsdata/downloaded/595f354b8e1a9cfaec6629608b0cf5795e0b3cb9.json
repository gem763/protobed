The Straits Times\n\nIn a fast-moving place like Singapore, hardly anything stays the same for too long. This time, one of Singapore\u2019s most iconic tourist attractions is saying goodbye.\n\nIn a press release on Friday (Sept 20), One Faber Group announced that the Sentosa Merlion\u2019s last day of operations will be on October 20.\n\nAccording to The Straits Times, the Sentosa Merlion will be demolished by year-end.\n\nIt will make way for the S$90 million Sentosa Sensoryscape project, which includes a themed thoroughfare linking Sentosa\u2019s north and south shores. This is part redevelopment plans to rejuvenate Singapore\u2019s southern tourist attractions, The Straits Times reported.\n\nRead also: Singapore is getting a second Sentosa, where NTUC will build a \u2018Downtown South\u2019 \u2013 here\u2019s what to expect\n\nTo encourage Singaporeans to relive their nostalgia at the 37m-tall landmark, the One Faber is offering tickets at half-price to residents and permanent residents from September 21 till the day it closes.

It was even accompanied by a roaring sound, and till this day, shoots laser beams from its eyes.\n\nRead also:", "description": "Business Insider - Goodbye Merlion! It's the end of an era indeed..
