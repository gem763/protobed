Interestingly, the new lock only affects the keyboard, and has no problem displaying and is easy to bypass by switching region. https://t.co/RVRKNQyc1l pic.twitter.com/8eQXambiAQ \u2014 \u738b\u535a\u6e90 Wang Boyuan (@thisboyuan) October 3, 2019\n\nHong Kong has been the center of months of protests led by pro-democracy demonstrators.\n\nControversy surrounding police treatment of protesters has led to a back and forth between the nation and the National Basketball Association after the Houston Rockets general manager expressed support for the Hong Kong protesters.\n\nThe NBA, which has billions of dollars of business ties with China, promptly replied saying that the GM did not speak for the entire league.\n\nThe NBA's response was hammered by lawmakers on both sides of the aisle in Washington, who accused the basketball league of caring more about Chinese investments than human rights.", "description": "Apple iPhone users in Macau and Taiwan discovered this week that they no longer had access to an emoji bearing the image of the Taiwanese flag, considered a controversial symbol on mainland China.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/apple_phone_09122017.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
