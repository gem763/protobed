Such actions can help boost confidence and reinvigorate investment manufacturing and global trade.\"Global economic growth for next year was also lowered to 3.4-percent.Next year's growth is expected to rise from this year's forecast driven by positive recovery signs from emerging economies like Brazil, Mexico and Russia.The IMF's economic growth outlook for South Korea in 2019 was also significantly downgraded to 2-percent from the previous 2.6-percent.South Korea was one key Asian economy to face a large downward adjustment due to the ripple effect of China's economic slowdown and Beijing's trade conflict with the U.S.The IMF also said tougher trade regulations between South Korea and Japan have strengthened uncertainty in trade policy and barriers and warned of negative impacts on both countries and the region's supply chain.Lee Min-sun, Arirang News.", "description": "\ud55c\uad6d\uc744 \ub300\ud45c\ud558\ub294 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ubc29\uc1a1!
