Just 19 of the new model will be built.\n\nMartin Lischka, senior product manager at Automobili Pininfarina, says his company\u2019s new electric Battista model will go on sale next year at \u20ac2 million, limited to 150 examples. It has a claimed 1400kW, almost 30 per cent more power than the 16-cylinder Bugatti Chiron.\n\n\u201cAs well as this beautiful car, there will be a complete vehicle family,\u201d says Lischka. Does that include a slightly more mainstream SUV, as rumoured?\n\nPininfarina\u2019s new electric Battista model.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t call it an SUV,\u201d says Lishcka. \"It\u2019s more radical, more crossover, but still with a pure design, very sporty, very futuristic in terms of design. Definitely, we are not going to hit the mass market. Exclusivity, rarity are the key attributes we are seeing in the brand.\u201d\n\nLagonda isn\u2019t aiming for the mainstream, either, but hopes to sell thousands of cars, rather than tens or hundreds. Aston Martin has owned the brand since 1947 and plans to pitch it against Rolls-Royce and Bentley, with an SUV, then sedan, on offer from 2022. It presented the All-Terrain Concept at this year\u2019s Geneva Motor Show.\n\nChief executive Andy Palmer says the company could have used its better-known Aston Martin brand for its electric cars, but that would make branding more difficult. \u201cOne of the things that make Tesla very compelling is that as a brand you understand it. Tesla is electric.\u201d\n\nThe Lagonda All-Terrain Concept was unveiled at the Geneva Motor Show in March.\n\nPalmer says the Lagonda brand is 120 years old and has a fairly high recognition in Britain, but doesn\u2019t have much cut-through elsewhere. \u201cBut go back 20 years and look at Rolls-Royce and Bentley. VW managed to build Bentley into a mega-brand from something that was the hidden sister of Rolls-Royce, so it\u2019s not impossible.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not underestimating the brand building, but it would be harder with a mixed message. The easiest way to communicate it is: Lagonda is 100 per cent electric.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPalmer says battery power gives a lower noise level and doesn\u2019t require the three-box \u201chorse, carriage and trunk\u201d of a petrol car, so the packaging can give back to the occupants the space that would be taken up by the internal combustion engine. The All-Terrain Concept is just over five metres long, but is claimed to have stretch-limo interior space.\n\nLUXURY asked a few established manufacturers if the new breed is likely to succeed \u2013 and take market share from them.\n\n\u201cThere are some really fresh ideas,\u201d says Maurizio Reggiani, the chief technical officer of Lamborghini, though he said making an electric car isn\u2019t quite as easy as some now think. \u201cWhat they need to face is, really, what will be the rules of the game. If you see how homologation [the legal approval process] impacts the design of the car, the construction of the car, the engineering of the car, it is unbelievable.\n\nI don\u2019t believe for one minute those cars are going to drive and handle like a McLaren. They will be capable EVs in a supercar shell. \u2014 Mike Flewitt, McLaren CEO\n\n\u201cWith electrification, one of the problems will be crash development. And there is a big job in terms of cooling. When you move from the concept car to the real car [then] we will see what will be the evolution of the revolution.\u201d\n\nIn this regard, Lagonda has the advantage of Aston Martin backing, while Pininfarina is using an electrical system from Rimic of Croatia (Rimic impressed Porsche so much the German car maker bought a 10 per cent share). Pininfarina has proven production facilities where low volume specialty models have been made on behalf of Ferrari, Volvo and others.\n\nMcLaren CEO Mike Flewitt said of his new competitors: \u201cGood luck to them; building cars is not an easy thing. But I don\u2019t believe for one minute those cars are going to drive and handle like a McLaren. I believe they will be capable EVs in a supercar body shell.\u201d\n\nThe interior of the spacious Lagonda All-Terrain Concept.\n\nWhen Torsten M\u00fcller-\u00d6tv\u00f6s, CEO of Rolls-Royce, is asked if he feels any threats on the luxury or exclusivity side, he says: \u201cNot at all.\n\n\u201cYou are talking in this segment of really high-net-worth individuals, and for them the question is not, \u2018Can I afford this?' If they like both, they go for both.\n\n\u201cThey have garages like we have wardrobes. They will find for the occasion the right outfit, and if they like the Hispano-Suiza they will go for it.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about Lagonda \u2013 which believes 3000 a year should be possible, seeing as Rolls-Royce sold 4100 units in 2018 \u2013 M\u00fcller-\u00d6tv\u00f6s shrugs. \u201cThese are just announcements,\" he says. \"We are here.\u201d", "description": "Car companies new and old are hoping to cash in on the growing demand for ultra-fast, ultra-exclusive electric machines, but not everyone is convinced.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5519%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_39/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/f89d3d5a3550ca3b487c88084bd9f692b1641a90", "published_at": "2019-04-23"}
