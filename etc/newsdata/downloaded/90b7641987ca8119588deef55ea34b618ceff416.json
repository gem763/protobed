Mulvaney answered a range of questions relating to the issues surrounding the impeachment inquiry of U.S. President Donald Trump, and other issues during the briefing. (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)\n\nActing White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney on Sunday defended President Trump\u2019s decision \u2014 reversed in a tweet late Saturday \u2014 to host next year\u2019s G-7 summit at his hotel resort, saying the president \"still considers himself to be in the hospitality business.\u201d\n\nJust days after Mulvaney during a Thursday press conference announced the venue for the annual meeting of world leaders, Trump changed his mind amid bipartisan rebukes and concerns that he was profiting from the presidency. But Trump blamed the about-face on Democrats and the media.\n\n\u201cI thought I was doing something very good for our Country by using Trump National Doral, in Miami, for hosting the G-7 Leaders,\u201d he tweeted Saturday. \u201cBut, as usual, the Hostile Media & their Democrat Partners went CRAZY!\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cTherefore, based on both Media & Democrat Crazed and Irrational Hostility, we will no longer consider Trump National Doral, Miami, as the Host Site for the G-7 in 2020. We will begin the search for another site, including the possibility of Camp David, immediately.\u201d\n\nIn a pointed interview with Chris Wallace on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d Mulvaney also defended his controversial remarks that on their face supported the case that Trump had offered to resume military aid to Ukraine in exchange for help from that country\u2019s president in pursuing an investigation into the 2016 U.S. election. He said his words were taken out of context \u2014 he never uttered the damaging phrase \u201cquid pro quo\u201d \u2014 but Wallace seemed unpersuaded.\n\n\u201cYou said what you said,\u201d the Fox host retorted.\n\nMulvaney, who had previously dismissed Camp David as a G7 meeting site, said that Trump was \u201chonestly surprised at the level of pushback\u201d to the plan to host next year\u2019s G-7 meeting at Trump\u2019s National Doral golf resort in Miami. The idea that the U.S. government, and hundreds of foreign heads of state, diplomats and journalists, would be paying the president of the United States to stay at his property had provoked outrage even among Republicans. Democrats had described it as blatantly corrupt and there was talk of adding it to the impeachment inquiry underway in the House.\n\n\"At the end of the day he still considers himself to be in the hospitality business and he saw an opportunity to take the biggest leaders from around the world and he wanted to put on the absolute best show, the best visit that he possibly could, and he was very comfortable doing that at Doral,\" Mulvaney said. \"I think we were all surprised at the level of pushback. I think it's the right decision to change and we'll have to find someplace else and my guess is we'll find someplace else the media won't like for another reason.\"\n\n\"Fox News Sunday\" host Chris Wallace pushed back on Mulvaney\u2019s comment about Trump being in the \u201chospitality business,\u201d pointing out that \u201che\u2019s the president of the United States.\u201d\n\n\"Yeah, but it's his background,\" Mulvaney defended Trump, again saying, \u201che's in the hotel business, or at least he was before he was president.\"\n\nWhen asked if Trump understands hosting the summit at his Florida golf club \u201clooked lousy,\u201d Mulvaney said, \u201cHe thinks people think it looks lousy.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s concession to criticism came at the end of the busiest week of an impeachment inquiry into Trump\u2019s attempts to enlist the Ukrainian government to investigate political rivals.\n\nMulvaney set off a media storm when he told reporters on Thursday Trump had indeed ordered the freeze of $391 million in military assistance to Ukraine, which has been battling Russian-backed separatists for several years \u2014 until three conditions were met, including agreement by Kiev to investigate the whereabouts of the \u201cDNC server\u201d that was hacked during the 2016 campaign. U.S. intelligence, private investigators and the Office of Special Counsel Robert Mueller all attribute the hacking to Russian agents. Trump and his lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, have been promoting a conspiracy theory that suggests Ukraine was somehow involved, in a false-flag operation staged by the Clinton campaign itself.\n\n\u201cGet over it,\u201d Mulvaney told the press. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be political influence in foreign policy.\u201d Mulvaney later walked back his comments, saying, \u201cthere was absolutely no quid pro quo between Ukrainian military aid and any investigation into the 2016 election.\"", "description": "Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney on Sunday defended President Trump\u2019s decision to host next year\u2019s G-7 summit at his hotel resort, saying the president \"still considers himself to be in the hospitality business.\u201d", "authors": ["Kadia Tubman"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Ux4RxDdyq12a7EIAwD2Ifw--~B/aD0zMjU4O3c9NDY0NztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/51874f70-f356-11e9-89ff-960da8027cab", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
