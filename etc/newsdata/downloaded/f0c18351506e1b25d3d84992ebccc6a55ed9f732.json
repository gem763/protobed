Three, two, one.\n\nNarrator: This crash looks bad, but you\u2019d actually be safer than you think, much in part thanks to a key missing component. An engine. And it\u2019s one of the many features that makes Tesla\u2019sModel 3 sedan ultrasafe in crashes.\n\nThis test is called a frontal offset test. And this car? Tesla\u2019s much anticipated Model 3. It\u2019s an all-electric plug-in, meaning that the front compartment doesn\u2019t have an engine like a normal combustion car would. Instead, all the empty steel and aluminium at the front of the car crumples, drawing the shock of the crash away from the occupants.\n\nLook at this footage of the cabin. The passengers are entirely unscathed. In fact, in this test conducted by safety experts Euro NCAP, the dummies representing the driver and passenger were green across the body, meaning the two were well protected.\n\nA large crumple zone isn\u2019t the only special feature that makes the Model 3 safe. The Model 3 received top overall marks in multiple tests, like roof strength, head restraints and seats tests, and autonomous driver-assistance systems tests, much in part due to the advanced safety technology special on the car.\n\nWith help from safety organisations IIHS and Euro NCAP, who performed the crash tests, we\u2019ll break down some of the features that put the Model 3 among some of the safest cars ever built.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about passive safety first.\n\nPassive safety refers to the systems that keep you safe in a crash. So, it mainly focuses on things like airbags, seats, and structure of the car. In the roof-crush test, you can see just how good the structure of the car is. Roof strength speaks to the ability of the car to protect occupants in rollover crashes. During the test, the car\u2019s roof resisted more than 20,000 pounds of force. That\u2019s more than if five Model 3s were placed on top of the car\u2019s roof at once. The roof earned a higher strength-to-weight ratio score than any other fully electric vehicle IIHS has ever tested. IIHS gave the roof an overall evaluation of G, or Good, their highest rating.\n\nAiding the Model 3\u2019s rollover rating is its all-electric power-train design, the focal point of which is a large, heavy battery at the floor of the car. While we don\u2019t have footage of a Model 3 in a rollover test, the heavy-battery-in-the-floor system is similar to that of the Model X SUV, shown here, a significantly taller car with a naturally higher centre of gravity. You can see how the battery in the floor lowers the overall centre of gravity, helping the car return to an upright position. We\u2019ve seen how the front of the Model 3 crumpled, sparing the cabin the brunt of the shock of a collision.\n\nBut airbags, seat geometry, and restraints also contribute to a higher occupant-protection score. The Model 3 has a thick curtain airbag and uniquely shaped front passenger airbag that help protect a passenger\u2019s head from the car\u2019s A pillar and centre screen.\n\nYou can see where the dummy\u2019s head, which is smeared in greasepaint, contacted the airbag. While passive safety covers what happens in an accident, active safety refers to the systems that help a car to avoid a collision in the first place.\n\nThe Model 3 has a suite of driver-assist systems designed to keep you from getting into an accident, including an automatic emergency-braking system that detects obstacles and stops the car on its own. To test this, IIHS had the Model 3 drive towards a stopped obstacle at 12 mph and 25 mph. The car earned a Superior rating in front crash prevention for automatically stopping at the obstacle both times.\n\nThe Model 3 stood out in Euro NCAP\u2019s passive safety tests.\n\nThe Model 3 scored an astounding 94% in the Safety Assist category for halting automatically for pedestrians and cyclists, as well as correcting inattentive driving.\n\nWatch the Model 3 in this emergency-lane-keeping test, where the car crosses over a white line denoting the end of the lane towards an oncoming vehicle. The system intervenes, pulling the car back into the lane automatically.\n\nWhile the Model 3 received top marks from IIHS and other safety organisations, it\u2019s one of many vehicles with excellent safety ratings. The Mercedes-Benz C-Class and Lexus ES 350 scored top marks in every category, while the Audi e-tron, another electric plug-in vehicle, also received IIHS\u2019s highest safety award. A hydrogen car, the Hyundai Nexo SUV, received results comparable to the Model 3.\n\nTesla has long touted the super safety of their crash technology, and now the evidence is in.\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
