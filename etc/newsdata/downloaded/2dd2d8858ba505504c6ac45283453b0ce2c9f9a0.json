The Financial Services Compensation Scheme explains the rules and what to do if you are affected here.\n\nWatchdog warning: Pension providers must carry out 'due diligence' checks when accepting savers' investments\n\nIn the aftermath of BBS's collapse, the Financial Conduct Authority issued a warning to other Sipp firms about their due diligence obligations when taking customers' investments, the fair treatment of those who make complaints, and what to do if the ombudsman issues a ruling against them.\n\nIn light of its demise - and the subsequent halting of BBS's appeal against the 2018 court decision - the FCA urges other firms to get in touch if this affects their financial position.\n\nIt says: 'We reiterate that if the outcome of this case calls into question a SIPP operator\u2019s ability to meet financial commitments as they fall due, they should contact the FCA immediately.'\n\nAnd it adds: 'If a firm pursues a sale of part or all of its business or assets, it should pay due regard to its implications for customers who may have compensation claims.' Its statement is here and its help page for BBS customers is here.\n\nThe FCA explains BBS entered administration because it accepted high-risk non-standard investments into its non-advised Sipps between 2010 and 2012, and after the ombudsman upheld a complaint against it, the business pursued litigation which in the end it could not afford.\n\nBBS customers warned to be alert The FCA has told people to beware of fraud, and that if they are cold called by someone claiming to be involved in the administration, they should end the call and ring RSM on 0800 302 9427 or Hartley Pensions on 0345 504 0582. It adds that BBS customers should be cautious if they are approached by claims management companies offering help, and that for the vast majority there is no benefit in involving a third party in making a claim. 'Any customer who believes they have a complaint against the firm should contact the FSCS in the first instance,' it says. 'You should note that you can approach the FSCS for free, if you wish them to consider and review your case and any claim that you believe you have.' The FSCS says on its website: 'If you think that you\u2019ve got a claim against Berkeley Burke SIPP Administration Ltd, click the \"Check if you can claim\" button to start the process. 'FSCS is free to use and you don\u2019t need to use a representative to make a claim. If you bring your claim to us directly you will receive 100 per cent of any compensation due.'\n\nIn addition, it was facing claims from 28 customers through group court action.\n\nThe administrator, RSM, has now sold the Sipp business to Hartley Pensions, which is holding assets for customers unless they decide to move money elsewhere.\n\nMeanwhile, the FSCS says it is accepting claims against BBS after it went into administration.\n\n'We're aware that independent financial advisers recommended many Berkeley Burke Sipp Administration Ltd customers to transfer their existing pensions into a Berkeley Burke Sipp,' it says on its website.\n\n'And that after the transfer, customers had their pension funds placed in high-risk, non-standard investments. Some of these have since become illiquid, which means they can\u2019t currently be sold or traded.\n\n'For FSCS to be able to pay your claim we must prove that Berkeley Burke SIPP Administration Ltd failed in its due diligence - in other words, did Berkeley Burke Sipp Administration Ltd do certain checks on the non-standard investments that would hold their customers pension funds, before accepting them into its SIPP investment portfolio?\n\n'Did it make sure they were appropriate for a Sipp, and did it identify any potential issues with them? Also, if it did identify potential issues, did it tell the customer?'\n\nThe FSCS notes that there are currently civil cases against Sipp operators underway in the High Court, and the outcome of these will affect whether they can pay claims.\n\nIt adds that people who have already lodged claims with the Financial Ombudsman will have their information sent directly to FSCS.\n\nThe ombudsman says it will no longer progress existing complaints, but if you have made a claim you don\u2019t need to take any action at the moment.\n\n'When the FSCS receives your file, it will contact you directly to ask you to submit your claim. There should be no need to submit all of the claim documents again.'\n\nOther companies within Berkeley Burke Group, which was founded in 1973, are not connected with Berkeley Burke Sipp.\n\nIts website says it administers occupational and small self-administered pension schemes, as well as contract based pension schemes, and provides consultancy services.
