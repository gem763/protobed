Mayor Muriel E. Bowser and Police Chief Peter Newsham discuss the shooting in the 1300 block of Columbia Road NW that left six people injured, one fatally, Thursday night. (Peter Hermann/TWP)\n\nTwo gunmen who killed a man and wounded five other people outside an apartment building in Northwest Washington\u2019s Columbia Heights neighborhood fired into a crowd that included members of a criminal crew, authorities said Friday.\n\nPolice said they did not know why the men, who were in a light-colored sedan, fired into a courtyard in the 1300 block of Columbia Road Thursday night. At least one was armed with what authorities described as a high-powered assault-style weapon.\n\nThe surviving victims suffered wounds ranging from minor to critical, and Police Chief Peter Newsham said intelligence links three of them to a crew operating in the Columbia Heights Village complex off 13th Street. He said four of the victims had been arrested in the past on gun charges.\n\nBut the Newsham also said the man who died, Vincent Carter, 21, was not listed by police as a crew member and was not among those with a prior gun arrest. Court records show Carter lived in Southeast Washington but was arrested on the block where the shooting occurred on a trespassing charge in December. It was dismissed after Carter completed a court-ordered program. His relatives could not be reached on Friday.\n\n\u201cApparently he does have a tie to this neighborhood,\u201d Newsham said. He added that investigators do not know which of the victims, if any, were the intended target. Newsham said detectives are trying to determine if Thursday\u2019s shooting is related to the killing in March of a man on the same block in what police said stemmed from a dispute between neighborhoods.\n\n[Two shootings leave seven people wounded, two dead, in separate parts of the District]\n\n\n\nD.C. Police released photos of a vehicle of interest in the shooting in the 1300 block of Columbia Road NW that left six people injured, one fatally, Thursday night. (D.C. Police)\n\nThe chief joined Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) at the Columbia Road apartment complex to address that shooting and another unrelated shooting three miles away and 20 minutes later in the 1300 block of Brentwood Road, in Northeast Washington off Rhode Island Avenue.\n\nPolice said Sean Coleman-Bey, 20, of Northeast, was killed in that shooting, and two bystanders were wounded. Newsham said Coleman-Bey was targeted by a man wearing a mask and gloves, but detectives don\u2019t know why. Police are searching for a pickup truck in that case.\n\nThe shootings of nine people in two parts of the city less than a half-hour apart forced Newsham and Bowser to once again address the issue of violence and gunfire that has pushed the year\u2019s homicide count to 127, a 19 percent increase over this time last year.\n\nBoth District officials blamed the proliferation of guns and extended magazines that allow some firearms to hold many bullets. They urged people to report others with guns.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s be clear,\u201d Bowser said of the shooting on Columbia Road. \u201cSix people being shot on a well-populated street like this puts everyone\u2019s life in danger. We need to get those guns off the streets, and the people off the street.\u201d Of the gunmen, she said, \u201cSomeone who knows them and loves them knew about these guns, more than likely.\u201d\n\n[Police are trying to determine if Thursday\u2019s shooting is related to another fatal shooting on the same block in March]\n\nNewsham said police have not yet determined the precise weapon that was used by at least one of the shooters, but he described it as \u201chigh-powered weapon.\u201d Police on Twitter said it was an \u201cAK style rifle.\u201d\n\nThe chief would not specify how many gunshots were fired, but he said \u201cit was certainly more than we should tolerate in this community.\u201d Newsham said police recovered a handgun near where the victims were shot, but he said it had not been fired during the incident and it was unclear if it belonged to any of the victims. Police said four men and one woman were wounded.\n\nOn Friday morning, residents emerged from their apartments to find alleyways and building entrances still guarded by yellow police tape, draped over cars, tied to gutters and spread across lawns, an indication of the sprawling crime scene. A woman and a young child carrying takeout food boxes stepped over blood smeared just inside the entrance to one apartment building.\n\nAcross the street, a group of young men and women argued among themselves. Though only snippets could be heard, it was clear the shooting the night before was the topic. Anger was evident throughout the complex, and many people simply turned and walked away when questioned.\n\nTwo people who heard the shots described it as one loud boom rather than distinctive \u201cpops\u201d from a handgun. \u201cI hear gunshots all the time,\u201d said one woman who was on her balcony in a nearby building, and spoke on the condition she not be named for fear of her safety. \u201cLast night was more intense than usual.\u201d\n\nDotti Love Wade, an Advisory Neighborhood Commission member for the area, said she was returning home from a meeting when the shooting occurred. She didn\u2019t hear the shots but recoiled as she listened to the police chief describe the weapon.\n\n\u201cOh my God,\u201d Wade said. \u201cThere is no reason for these kinds of weapons to exist in America, let alone the nation\u2019s capital.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nThey sold 45 illegal guns around D.C.; 17 have been found\n\nAlleged leaker says Espionage Act charges violate First Amendment\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "Six people were shot, one fatally, on Columbia Road.
