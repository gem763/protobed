We do not comment on the financial situation of the individual businesses we regulate,\" it said in a statement.\n\nProfit problems\n\nThomas Cook first announced in June that it had received a takeover approach for its tour business from its largest shareholder Fosun. Last month, it said the deal had been agreed with Fosun and a majority of its bondholders.\n\nThe offer came amid fears over its financial strength. In May, the firm reported a \u00a31.5bn loss for the first half of the year. It has also issued three profit warnings over the past year and is struggling to reduce its debts.\n\nIt has blamed a series of problems for its profit warnings, including political unrest in holiday destinations such as Turkey, last summer's prolonged heatwave and customers delaying booking holidays due to Brexit. But it has also suffered from competition from online travel agents and low-cost airlines.\n\nShould I be worried about my holiday?\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nThomas Cook is an ATOL-protected business.\n\nProtection under the ATOL - or Air Travel Organiser's Licence - scheme means UK travellers on an air package holidays do not lose their money or become stranded abroad if a travel agent collapses.\n\nIt also covers many charter flights and means that, if the operator collapses while people are away, they can finish their holiday and be flown home at no extra cost.\n\nIf the business collapses before they go away, the scheme will provide a replacement holiday of equal value, or a refund.\n\nWhen flights are booked on their own, or when people book flights and accommodation separately, the ATOL scheme does not usually come into effect. However, the ATOL scheme does now cover more custom-built holidays than it used to.\n\nIf a holiday is ATOL-protected it will be clearly marked with a certificate on holiday documents. The scheme is run by the UK Civil Aviation Authority and is backed by the UK government.", "description": "The troubled travel firm is understood to be in last minute negotiations with bondholders.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/D2C9/production/_108816935_holidaycouple_getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
