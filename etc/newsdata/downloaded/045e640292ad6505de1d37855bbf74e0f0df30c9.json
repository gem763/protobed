Bin Laden wasn\u2019t the target of the raid, but was caught in the compound as they conducted a raid for someone else.\n\nThe timing of the president's statement is of particular interest given reports of how secret U.S. talks with the Taliban fell apart amid push-back from the president's most ardent supporters.\n\nCIA via AP\n\nHamza bin Laden emerged as a \"key leader\" in the terrorist organization after his father was killed in a raid by U.S. Navy SEALs in Pakistan in 2011, according to U.S. officials. The U.S. government said a letter was found in the elder bin Laden\u2019s compound during a subsequent raid of the compound that \u201cindicat[ed] that he was grooming Hamza to replace him as leader\" of al-Qaeda.\n\nEarlier this year, the U.S. State Department announced a $1 million reward for information leading to bin Laden\u2019s capture and accused him of \"threatening attacks against the United States in revenge for the May 2011 killing of his father by U.S. military forces.\"\n\n\"Hamza was both the biological and ideological heir to his father,\u201d said Tom Joscelyn, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.\n\n\u201cAl-Qaeda counted on him to speak to a new generation of jihadists,\" he said.", "description": "Bin Laden was killed in a United States counter-terrorism operation in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/hamza-bin-laden-ap-jt-190914_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
