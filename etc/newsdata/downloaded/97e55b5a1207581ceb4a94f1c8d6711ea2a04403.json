Sam Mooy\n\nThe firm is also doing away with billable targets for lawyers returning from mid to long-term parental leave for eight weeks.\n\nWhile variations on this had been an unofficial policy for some time, Ms Bloch hoped its formalisation would reassure returning parents they could take time to ease back into work.\n\nThe firm is still working through an equivalent policy for partners, who often have targets associated with work brought into the firm rather than just billed hours.\n\nIt will also pay superannuation on any unpaid parental leave taken for up to 34 weeks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe firm has the highest portion of female partners of the big six law firms at 33.1 per cent, but Mr Spurio and Ms Bloch were clear the push for a better policy came from men as well as women.\n\nMs Bloch said the package was a more holistic approach to improving parental leave than firms historically took, with most adopting a piecemeal approach meaning some areas improve but others lag.\n\nPromoting parents\n\nMs Bloch is about to start her second parental leave and said her first stint showed her that, rather than limiting her career as many feared, the time off made her a better lawyer.\n\n\u201cTaking the time out from everyday business so you can work out what\u2019s important and think strategically is really helpful,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt lets you read more and listen to podcasts while you\u2019re pushing the pram and draw links with your work and think more broadly about what you want to do.\u201d\n\nFurther cementing her view that taking almost a year of parental leave did not stymie her career, Ms Bloch was made a partner of Allens within months of her son\u2019s birth.\n\nShe is not the first lawyer to be promoted to the partnership while on parental leave. Minter Ellison\u2019s Louella Stone, DLA Piper\u2019s Astrid Beemster and Arnold Bloch Leibler\u2019s Christine Fleer all made partner in the same situation.", "description": "A top-tier law firm is adopting an industry-leading parental leave program that does away with billable targets for parents returning to work.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2126%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/f4cc51f01e895c9d30ae328811fef56fe5edd317", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
