She told a judge that the indictment covers previous allegations as well as a \u201cpreviously uncharged incident.\u201d\n\nGooding, 51, now must be arraigned on the new indictment next week before a trial can begin. He and his lawyers left the courthouse without speaking to reporters.\n\nThe actor has been accused of placing his hand on a 29-year-old woman\u2019s breast and squeezing it without her consent at Magic Hour Rooftop Bar & Lounge near Times Square on June 9. The woman told police she believed Gooding was intoxicated.\n\nGooding was arrested four days later after turning himself in to police. He pleaded not guilty to forcible touching and sexual abuse charges and was released on his own recognizance.\n\nGooding later requested to have his case thrown out, but he was rejected.\n\nThe defense had filed papers saying the misdemeanor forcible touching case should be dismissed based on accounts of two witnesses who say it never happened, and that video from the bar backs up that claim. The papers argued that since there was clear evidence that no crime was committed, it was necessary to throw out the case to protect the integrity of the criminal justice system.\n\nThe judge ruled that the conflicting accounts should be resolved at a trial.\n\nGooding faces up to a year in jail if convicted.", "description": "Cuba Gooding Jr. learned on Thursday that he\u2019s facing a new undisclosed charge in his sexual misconduct case, a development that came as jury selection was set to begin for his trial.", "authors": ["Breitbart News"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/06/cubagooging1-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
