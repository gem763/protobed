Some say they have not eaten unless they have had maize meal, which is known as nshima in Zambia, nsima in Malawi, sadza in Zimbabwe, papa or pap in South Africa and Lesotho, and ugali in Kenya.\n\nResistance to new dishes\n\nThe maize meal is boiled with water, and a bit of salt is added. It is then folded into the desired texture, making it a quick, cheap and easy dish.\n\nIt can also be fermented and served at breakfast as porridge, or cooked in a more dense form for lunch and dinner, when is it often served with meat, vegetable stews and sour milk.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Maize meal is popular because it is cheap\n\nClifford Chirwa, a fourth-year student at the University of Zambia, said he doubted the government would succeed in getting people to eat less of it.\n\n\"It's not possible because every culture has a specific food which is considered to be a staple. Just like you have jollof rice in Nigeria, nshima is typically Zambian,\" he told the BBC.\n\nAgreeing with him, Olipa Lungu, who runs a restaurant at a busy market in the capital Lusaka, said her efforts to change the menu had failed.\n\n\"Nshima stands out. The only other food that people like are chips but even those I make only when there's a special order,\" she said.\n\nGovernment subsidies\n\nBut Ms Wina's proposal has won the support of the Zambia National Farmers Union (ZNFU).\n\n\"With the advent of climate change, we have to start looking at various options of food. We have been too dependent on maize yet we grow crops such as sorghum, rice and millet,\" ZNFU spokesman Kakoma Kaleyi told the BBC.\n\n\"We rarely eat other foods. I think that our culinary tastes should change. This is the right call by the vice-president,\" he added.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Nine-year-old Nigerian chef: 'I want to make food for the president'\n\nSome nutritionists say the maize meal sold in supermarkets is highly processed and therefore lacks nutrients, vital for the health of our skin, hair and brain.\n\nWhen eaten in its original form, maize contains nutrients such vitamin A, vitamin C, iron and fibre, but all the goodness is lost if it is over-processed, they say.\n\nMaize meal is popular, especially in poor families, because it is often subsidised by governments, South African dietician Thandolwakhe Msomi told the BBC.\n\n\"So if you're looking at introducing other grains and have them become a staple in homes, we would need similar interventions by those in power,\" she added.\n\nAn nshima recipe for a family of five\n\nCourtesy of the BBC's Kennedy Gondwe in Zambia\n\nPour about two litres of water in a pot\n\nLet it almost boil\n\nThrow in five handfuls of maize meal\n\nStir with a wooden spoon until the maize meal thoroughly mixes with the water\n\nLet it thicken; wait for the mixture to start bubbling\n\nCook for close to 10 minutes on medium heat\n\nThen add another five handfuls of maize meal while continuously stirring\n\nAt this stage, I prefer to sprinkle a bit of cassava meal to add a bit more nutrition and aroma\n\nWhen the mixture reaches its desired thickness, cover the pot and switch off the stove\n\nAfter about two minutes, scoop it out and enjoy\n\nTo go with: T-bone steak, beans and boiled okra\n\nUnlike in many other countries, processed maize meal in South Africa is fortified with vitamins and minerals - all producers are legally required to add nutrients such as vitamin A and B to boost its health benefits.\n\n\"The more modern grain is steel-ground. It doesn't contain the germ of the kernel and that is where the nutrients are,\" Ms Msomi said.\n\n\"If we were to stone-mill the whole kernel we would get more energy-producing carbohydrates, protein and fibre, which isn't found even in fortified variants of the maize-meal,\" she said.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Maize meal sold in supermarkets often lack nutrients\n\nYellow maize is also packed with more nutrients than white maize but \"sadly we've been conditioned to believe that the yellow coarse kind is for the less affluent\", the nutritionist added.\n\nAs for sorghum and pearl millet, Ms Msomi said they are \"high-energy\" grains which contain carbohydrates, protein, and are low in fat.\n\nFurthermore, they are rich in vitamins A and B, high in calcium, iron and zinc, and also contain potassium, phosphorus, magnesium, copper, and manganese. Sorghum is also gluten-free.\n\nWhat do vitamins and minerals do?\n\nVitamin A is vital for good eyesight\n\nVitamin B1 helps to release energy from carbohydrates\n\nVitamin C helps to prevent illness and make bones\n\nIron is needed to transport oxygen in the blood\n\nCalcium strengthens bones and teeth\n\nZinc helps heal wounds\n\n\"At a time when we are focused on climate change and its effects on food security, these grains have been known to be hardy. They are able to withstand tougher climates,\" Ms Msomi said.\n\n\"People were educated about how to grow maize even in their homes. They can be educated about how to grow other grains too,\" she added.\n\nSorghum porridge anyone?\n\n* Additional reporting by Kennedy Gondwe in Lusaka", "description": "Zambia's vice-president calls for a radical change in the eating habits of the nation.", "authors": ["Pumza Fihlani", "Bbc News"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/7C8A/production/_108828813_img_3463.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
