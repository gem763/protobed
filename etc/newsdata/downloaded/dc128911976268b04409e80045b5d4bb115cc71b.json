Cohen's son, Adam Cohen, put the project together with vocals Leonard had previously recorded around the time of his 2016 album, You Want it Darker.\n\nThanks for the Dance boasts a long list of collaborators: Spanish laud player Javier Mas, Damien Rice and Leslie Feist on vocals, Arcade Fire's Richard Reed Parry on bass, the National's Bryce Dessner on guitar, Beck on guitar and Jennifer Warnes on background vocals. Daniel Lanois and Patrick Watson contributed as arrangers and producers, respectively, on parts of the project.\n\n\"In composing and arranging the music for his words, we chose his most characteristic musical signatures, in this way keeping him with us,\" Adam explained in a statement. \"What moves me most about the album is the startled response of those who have heard it. 'Leonard lives!' they say, one after the other.\"\n\nThanks for the Dance comes almost exactly three years after the songwriter's death.
