We\u2019re still more than a month away from the deadline for this year\u2019s Presidents Cup captains to name their four picks and one of the most intriguing selection options in recent memory continues to be a hot topic.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nAlthough U.S. captain Tiger Woods hasn\u2019t played since the BMW Championship and announced he had arthroscopic surgery on his left knee last month, there\u2019s plenty of support for the captain to pick himself when the selections are made following November\u2019s WGC-HSBC Champions.\n\nThe Tour would understandably be keen for Tiger to play and coach at this year\u2019s matches in Australia and it\u2019s likely those who have already qualified for the U.S. team would also be in favor of a playing/captain. But it\u2019s those outside the U.S. team room who also recognize why the matches will be better if Tiger wears both hats.\n\n\u201cI mean, he matters. That\u2019s the bottom line,\u201d Adam Scott said. \u201cIt\u2019s better when he plays than when he doesn\u2019t, even if he only plays two matches. It\u2019s better for the event if he does. I guess he has to decide if it\u2019s better for his team or not.\u201d\n\nInternational captain Ernie Els echoed those comments last week at the BMW PGA Championship, telling GolfChannel.com, \u201c[Woods] should pick himself. He\u2019s too young to be a captain.\u201d And too big for the event to simply sit on the sidelines.\n\nMoonlighting. Predictably, there will be those who will criticize Tony Romo\u2019s sponsor invitation into this week\u2019s Safeway Open, claiming the former NFL quarterback and CBS Sports analyst is nothing more than a marketing ploy to sell tickets.\n\nStory continues\n\nProbably. But is that really a bad thing?\n\nThat Romo, who is playing as an amateur, opened with a 2-under 70 and was tied for 20th when he completed his round certainly helps quiet the critics. It was Romo\u2019s best round on the PGA Tour and sets up an interesting possibility for the weekend.\n\nIf Romo makes the cut he will be replaced in the CBS Sports booth for the Vikings-Bears game in Chicago, which he was scheduled to work alongside Jim Nantz. \u201cIt\u2019s a good problem to have,\u201d Romo smiles.\n\nIf that\u2019s not dedication we don\u2019t know what is.\n\nMade Cut-Did Not Finish (MDF)\n\nSlow start. The European Tour took slow play on last week at the BMW PGA Championship, but if the outcome was any indication the solution to slow play is going to be, well, a slow process.\n\nEuropean officials mounted displays on five tees last week at Wentworth that informed groups their position to the threesome in front of them and their pace relative to the field. The idea is to use technology to help speed things up but the beta testing didn\u2019t seem to make much difference.\n\nFew players seemed to notice the displays and one veteran decided to have a little fun with a device and replaced the readout with a picture of Lee Westwood. Others used the devices to check the Rugby World Cup scores.\n\nAnd throughout all these shenanigans rounds still lapsed toward five hours to complete. Technology might help speed things up, but if last week\u2019s experiment is any indication it\u2019s not the answer.\n\nTweet of the week: @MattFitz94 (Matt Fitzpatrick) \u201cOh and pace of play, waited on the majority of shots on the front 9 yet somehow were 2 [minutes] ahead of time. Work that one out, long way to go to fix this problem.\u201d\n\nOh and pace of play \ud83d\ude34 waited on the majority of shots on the front 9 yet somehow were 2 mins ahead of time. Work that one out, long way to go to fix this problem. \u2014 Matt Fitzpatrick (@MattFitz94) September 19, 2019\n\nFitzpatrick added that his threesome needed nearly five hours to complete the opening round at the BMW PGA and he has become an outspoken advocate of tougher penalties for pace-of-play violations. Forget technology, players becoming increasingly vocal when it comes to slow play may actually lead to meaningful change.\n\nMissed Cut\n\nChange of plans. The real world invaded the normally controlled golf universe this week with news that the PGA Tour Series-China has cancelled its season finale next month in Hong Kong because of civil unrest.\n\nThe event was scheduled to be played Oct. 17-20 at Clearwater Bay Golf & Country Club, but Hong Kong is now in its fourth month of protests. Some of the clashes between protesters and police have turned violent and officials cited safety concerns for cancelling the event.\n\n\u201cWe have analyzed this situation from every angle, and as a group we determined that canceling the 2019 Clearwater Bay Open is the best decision,\u201d PGA Tour Series-China executive director Greg Carlson told the Associated Press.\n\nThere is no shortage of concerns to address and debate at the game\u2019s highest level until a real issue, like the Hong Kong protests, becomes a part of the conversation and you realize that golf is just a game.", "description": "In this week\u2019s edition of Cut Line, Tiger Woods receives some unexpected advice for his Presidents Cup dilemma, Tony Romo may have played his way out of a day job, and more.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/zuQFI5NIUyxvJUW0ClGGQg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/xILfsHaAoVLHJLb9cea8Yg--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_golf_channel_404/83869991a876ba6658a92b0feb052226", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
