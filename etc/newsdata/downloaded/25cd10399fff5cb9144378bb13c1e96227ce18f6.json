Photograph: Crown Prosecution Service/PA\n\nSentencing him at Taunton crown court, the judge Paul Cook said: \u201cYou had attempted to obtain the equipment and had the intention to endanger life in a shooting event at some point in the future.\u201d\n\nCook said officers searched Davies\u2019s home after his arrest on 20 June last year and found \u201cdisturbing and chilling\u201d research into mass murders.\n\n\u201cYour interest was correctly described as an obsession,\u201d he told Davies. The judge said the \u201cgraphic and unpalatable\u201d material, including how-to guides on mass shootings and making explosives, ran to thousands of pages.\n\n\u201cYou had taken practical steps as to how to put your plan into execution,\u201d he told Davies. \u201cYou worked out your budget, which was in excess of \u00a310,000, and you purchased the equipment to assist you in carrying out a mass killing.\u201d\n\nThe judge said Davies\u2019s intended location and targets remained unclear.\n\nPeter Binder, representing Davies, said his client had been diagnosed with autism and depression. \u201cIt is speculation as to how far down the road of actually carrying out some form of shooting the defendant would have got,\u201d Binder said.\n\nA jury unanimously convicted Davies of attempting to possess a firearm with intent to endanger life and attempting to possess the ammunition with intent to endanger life following a two-week trial at Gloucester crown court in July.\n\nDavies was an A-level pupil planning to go to university. Until police began searching the teenager\u2019s bedroom, they had no idea of his motive for purchasing the weapon.\n\nDavies used software to clear browsing data each time he closed his laptop but crucially he was using it at the time of his arrest, meaning officers were able to access his online activity that day. This revealed searches for Columbine, as well as how to clean a Glock 17 and searches relating to UK firearms officers.\n\nPolice discovered a note on Davies\u2019s bedside table entitled G\u00f6tterdammerung (twilight of the gods), apparently a reference to Wagner\u2019s opera. It listed equipment required for a mass shooting event including a gas mask, trenchcoat, gloves, boots, body armour and a leg pistol-holder as well as ingredients for explosives.\n\nHe had drawn 77 stick people to represent those murdered by Breivik in one page of a schoolbook.\n\nThe teenager previously pleaded guilty to two counts of evading the prohibition on the importation of firearms and ammunition, as well as two counts of making indecent images of children.", "description": "\u2018Chilling\u2019 research into killings found when officers searched Kyle Davies\u2019 Gloucester home", "authors": ["Steven Morris"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32aa21e7c0cfb2c5977dd7d0c7a400aa7d0978ce/0_847_2586_1551/master/2586.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6bf6cd3abf340477e089ac7b6d0db652", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
