(Photo: Jon Kopaloff, FilmMagic)\n\nTallulah Willis shared that she has struggled with serious mental health issues during a period when people were praising her happiness.\n\nIn honor of World Mental Health Day, which was Thursday, the 25-year-old posted a video of herself dancing by a pool in a pink bikini before jumping in.\n\n\"When I filmed this video I remember everyone telling me over and over how much they wished they had my energy, my freeness, a ownership of self,\" Bruce Willis and Demi Moore's daughter captioned the post. \"When this video was filmed I was 3 months into the deepest suicidal hole I had ever been in.\"\n\nIn the lengthy caption, Willis revealed that while she's not fully ready to share her story, she fights pain daily.\n\n\"Pain is pain. It\u2019s different and enters each of our lives through a myriad of ways, but each electric stab or dull ache is real,\" she wrote. \"I'm scared of my brain and the capacity for pain it has and will continue to bear. My fight is daily and for the duration of my life and each day I choose to find the glowed moments, a thefted giggle, or true peaceful pause, I know I was brave that day.\"\n\nWillis also wrote that she struggles to find the words to describe what she's going through.\n\n\"I have a great ole bunch of acronyms that explain my diagnosis, and slowly they are no longer scary to me,\" she ended her message. \"Try try TRY to be sweet to yourself, find every little bean of love you can and absorb it.\"\n\nIf you're having suicidal thoughts or need to talk to someone about suicide, please call the national hotline at 1-800-273-8255.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2019/10/11/demi-moore-bruce-willis-daughter-tallulah-mental-health-struggles/3945019002/", "description": "Tallulah Willis shared what appeared to be a happy video of her dancing by a pool and revealed that she was battling suicidal thoughts at the time.", "authors": ["Rasha Ali", "Published P.M.
