Within a month, Bitcoin\u2019s trading values dropped to a low of $3,358 on February 7.\n\nFrom then on, the digital currency demonstrated some relative stability. It experienced one notable drop at the end of February where its trading price fell 8 percent from $4,106 \u2013 its highest price this quarter \u2013 to $3,784 over a 24-hour period.\n\nBy March, BTC had nearly equaled its quarter high and closed trading at $4,092, representing a modest 10 percent growth for the quarter.\n\nQ2 recap\n\nMoving on, the second quarter of 2019 proved to be much more fruitful for investors and hodlers.\n\nBitcoin began the quarter on April 1 at $4,125, and it certainly didn\u2019t spend any time joking around as this marked the start of a three-month-long rally.\n\nOver Q2, Bitcoin set numerous records for reaching prices that haven\u2019t been seen over the past 12 months.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Q3 performance\n\nBitcoin BTC opened July slightly above the $10,000 mark, hitting $10,442.80 on the first day of the month. It went on to surpass $11,000 within the first two weeks of the quarter.\n\nThe digital currency dropped by 11.4 percent, going from $10,786.24 on July, 15 to $9,552.68 July 16. We saw the month\u2019s low on July 27, when Bitcoin traded for $9,451.10 apiece.\n\nIt then began a swift recovery, increasing by under $100 in value over three days, and reaching $9,518.69 on July 30.\n\nCourtesy of eToro\n\nThe quarter\u2018s highest value was hit in early August, when the digital currency surpassed $11,000, hitting $11,815.04 on August 7.\n\nHowever, a week later, on August 14, Bitcoin\u2019s trading price decreased by 14 percent, stabilizing at $10,137.88.\n\nThe month of August ended with Bitcoin trading well below $10,000, and costing just $9,462.50 on August, 31.\n\nCourtesy of eToro\n\nBitcoin started trading at $9,603.10 on September 1, increasing by 7 percent and hitting $10,363.03 the following day.\n\nThe digital currency hovered around the $10,000 mark for most of the month, until it dropped to $9931.40 on September 21 and continued to plummet over the next three days, leaving it sitting at $8,549.93 on September 24.\n\nBitcoin\u2018s lowest value for Q3 was reached on September 29 when it was trading $7,994.55.\n\nCourtesy of eToro\n\nQ3 2018 vs Q3 2019\n\nOverall, Q3 2019 saw Bitcoin make higher gains than during the same time period last year.\n\nBitcoin performed better in July 2019, than it did in 2018 when the month\u2019s high was $8,194.58. In July this year, as we\u2019ve just seen, the cryptocurrency was trading in between $9,000-$10,000.\n\nIn August 2018, Bitcoin\u2018s price hovered around $7,000-$8,000, meaning traders had to spend several thousand dollars more to purchase the same amount of the cryptocurrency in August this year.\n\nThe cryptocurrency was trading at $6,741.26 on September 1, 2018 \u2014 meaning the cryptocurrency was 29 percent cheaper than it was on September 1, 2019.\n\nCourtesy of eToro\n\nMajor events during Q3 2019\n\nOn July 12, US President Donald Trump, known for his complicated relationship with technology and his incessant need to share his ill-advised thoughts with the world, admitted he wasn\u2019t a fan of cryptocurrency. Trump said cryptocurrencies were not money and took issue with their highly volatile value \u201cbased on thin air,\u201d as well as their potential to facilitate criminal activity.\n\nThen, on August 1, we all woke up to the news that more than 85 percent of Bitcoin\u2019s total supply had been mined.\n\nOn August 12, New Zealand\u2018s tax authorities deemed it legal for companies to pay its employees in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Companies will also be able to deduct income taxes using current PAYE (pay as you earn) frameworks under the Income Tax Act 2007.\n\nA cryptocurrency whale made headlines after moving a groin-thumping Bitcoin fortune worth $468.5 million on July 29.\n\nIn late September, a report suggested that Venezuela\u2018s central bank may have Ethereum and Bitcoin but had little idea what to do with them.\n\nAlso in September, UK police raised \u00a3300,000 ($369,000) through the auction of criminally-seized Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, achieving over market value.\n\nLooking ahead\n\nWhile it\u2019s impossible to predict Bitcoin\u2018s future price movements, its performance over the month of October has seen relatively little volatility, with its value so far staying within $8,000-$7,000.\n\nHowever, I hope we don\u2019t see a repeat of last year\u2019s Q4 slump when Bitcoin was struggling to move beyond $4,000 during the months of November and December.", "description": "We've taken a closer look at the digital currency's performance, focusing specifically on its price movements during Q3 2019.", "authors": ["Yessi Bello Perez", "October"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/hardfork?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2Fbitcoin-q3.jpg&signature=c45a250ef7c8c3177722108b451c3ebe", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
