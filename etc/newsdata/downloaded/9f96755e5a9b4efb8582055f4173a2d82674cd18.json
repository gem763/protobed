'The fourth estate is important but you're not Clark Kent from The Daily Planet,' he said on Monday\n\nThe next day, police raided ABC offices about another national security story two journalists had written two years earlier.\n\nThe raids made international news, but so far none of the journalists involved have been told whether or not they will face jail time for reporting in the public interest.\n\nMedia companies want law changes so journalists don't fear imprisonment for doing their jobs and stronger protections for whistle-blowers.\n\nMore than 60 new laws have been put in place over the past 20 years, which critics say effectively criminalises journalism and penalises whistleblowing.\n\nMore information about the media campaign against the government can be found at yourrighttoknow.com.au and on social media under #righttoknow.", "description": "Mr Joyce, whose personal life dominated the headlines in 2017,\u00a0acknowledged that free press was vital for a functioning democracy.", "authors": ["Zoe Zaczek", "Lauren Ferri For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/04/19974936-0-image-a-37_1571629644300.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
