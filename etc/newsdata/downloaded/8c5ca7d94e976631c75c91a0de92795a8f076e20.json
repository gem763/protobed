He accuses the Minneapolis mayor of charging exorbitant costs to try and discourage a campaign rally\n\nTrump himself took to Twitter to air his grievances, writing on Tuesday: 'Radical Left Dem Mayor of Minneapolis, Jacob Frey, is doing everything possible to stifle Free Speech despite a record sell-out crowd at the Target Center. Presidents Clinton and Obama paid almost nothing!'\n\nAt a 2009 rally at the Target Center for then-President Barack Obama, security costs totaled around $20,000, according to a Pioneer Press report at the time.\n\nFrey responded to the discrepancy in his press conference, saying: 'There are just big differences between 2009 and 2019.'\n\nThe fracas erupted after the Trump campaign said the city of Minneapolis presented the operator of Target Center a $530,000 bill for security costs, which the arena operator had sought to pass along to the campaign.\n\nFrey earlier defended the security cost estimate, saying it was reasonable and that he had a duty to taxpayers to ensure safety.\n\nDespite the dispute over security costs, Trump's campaign manager Brad Parscale said that the rally would go on as scheduled.\n\n'The Target Center has backed off cancelling the contract,' Parscale said in a statement on Tuesday. 'Consistent with the original agreement with the venue, the Trump campaign has not agreed to pay any additional funds.'\n\nBarack Obama is seen at a 2009 rally at the Target Center in Minneapolis. Police estimated security costs for that rally to total about $20,000, according to a report at the time\n\nDonald Trump picked a fight with Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey on Wednesday over security charges for the president's upcoming rally. He's seen here at a Minnesota rally in 2018\n\nThe Trump campaign had earlier threatened to sue the city of Minneapolis over the costs.\n\nThe rally comes as Trump hopes to flip Minneapolis into the Republican column in the 2020 presidential race.\n\nThe state has gone Democrat in every presidential election since 1972, but was won by Hillary Clinton by a razor-thin 1.5% margin in 2016. It was the closest presidential election in the state since 1984, when Minnesota was the only state that did not go to Ronald Reagan, and Walter Mondale won by 0.2%.\n\nTrump is framing Thursday's rally as an attack on Rep. Ilhan Omar, a left-wing Democratic congresswoman who is a member of 'the squad' and a frequent target for him. His campaign thinks they can flip Minnesota into Trump's column in 2020.\n\nThe president said in a Tuesday morning tweet, 'The lightweight mayor is hurting the great police and other wonderful supporters. 72,000 ticket requests already. Dump Frey and Omar! Make America Great Again!'\n\nThe president's campaign has accused Frey of 'abusing the power of his office and attempting to extort' the campaign by 'conjuring a phony and outlandish bill for security in an effort to block a scheduled Keep America Great rally'\n\nFrey has made no secret of his opposition to Trump coming to the city and appeared to confirm in a tweet that the city authorities were behind the $530,000 demand.\n\nHe trolled Trump in a reply that made reference to the campaign's history of sticking cities with security costs.\n\n'Yawn... Welcome to Minneapolis where we pay our bills, we govern with integrity, and we love all of our neighbors,' the mayor tweeted.\n\nHe and his police chief, Medaria Arradonon, last week barred off-duty members of the city's police force from attending the rally and other political events in uniform.\n\nThat prompted an angry backlash from the police union, led by Lt. Bob Kroll, which is now selling 'Cops for Trump' t-shirts that Trump name checked.\n\nTrump said: 'The Police are fighting the Radical Left Mayor, and his ridiculous Uniform Ban. Actually, I LOVE the Cops for Trump shirts. Want to bring some home. I am with you 100%!!!!'\n\nLater in the day, Trump claimed that Frey is trying to block what is expected to be a 'record sell-out crowd' at the venue that boasts a previous record of 20,200 people at a 2005 U2 concert.", "description": "Mayor Jacob Frey, a Democrat, clapped back at a press conference on Tuesday, after Trump accused him of trying to sabotage a campaign event planned for Thursday.", "authors": ["Keith Griffith", "Francesca Chambers", "Senior White House Correspondent For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/02/19470160-0-image-a-23_1570585940172.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
