But some members, such as Iraq and Nigeria, have been producing above their quota.\n\nIraq, OPEC's second-largest oil producer, pledged on Thursday to reduce output by 175,000 bpd by October, while Nigeria is to reduce supply by 57,000 bpd.\n\nOPEC's de facto leader, Saudi Arabia, will continue pumping less than its target, said Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, who took over as energy minister from Khalid al-Falih on Sunday.\n\nThe kingdom will voluntarily overdeliver on its targets and pump just below 10 million bpd, Prince Abdulaziz said.\n\nHe said the meeting on Thursday also discussed rising U.S. shale output and exports, a global economic slowdown and a possible softening of U.S. sanctions on OPEC member Iran.\n\nAny formal decision on deeper oil cuts could be taken only at the next OPEC+ meeting in December, the prince said.\n\nOPEC, Russia and other non-members agreed in December to reduce production by 1.2 million bpd - or 1.2% of global supply - from Jan. 1 this year.\n\nOPEC\u2019s share of the cut, which now runs to March 2020, is 800,000 bpd, delivered by 11 members and exempting Iran, Libya and Venezuela.\n\nOil prices tumbled more than 2% on Wednesday after a report that U.S. President Donald Trump was considering easing sanctions on Iran, which could boost global crude supply at a time of lingering worries about energy demand.\n\nIraq has been raising its production and exports steeply in recent years, while Iran's exports have collapsed over the past year because of U.S. sanctions.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Additional reporting Alex Lawler, Writing by Dmitry Zhdannikov, Nafisa Eltahir and Aziz El Yaakoubi; Editing by Deepa Babington and Mark Potter)", "description": "OPEC agreed on Thursday to trim oil output by asking over-producing members Iraq and Nigeria to bring production in line with their targets as the group strives to prevent a glut amid soaring U.S. production and a slowing global economy.
