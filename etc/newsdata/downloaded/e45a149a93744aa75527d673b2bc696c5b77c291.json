It was.\n\nThe last Metro train had left the Navy Yard station about an hour earlier, but an impressive number of people were still at the free watch party when Kendrick delivered the biggest hit in Nationals history at 12:23 a.m. The ballpark\u2019s submarine horns blared after Kendrick\u2019s blast, which everyone knew was at least deep enough to score the go-ahead run, disappeared over the center field wall. Fans jumped up and down in the aisles and waved red rally towels. They high-fived and hugged loved ones and complete strangers. They laughed. They screamed. No doubt some cried.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHere are a few of the best videos of the moment Kendrick became a Nationals legend. (Be warned that there\u2019s some excited swearing.)\n\nNats Park is hype! pic.twitter.com/GOPdYO3vkB \u2014 Nationals on MASN (@masnNationals) October 10, 2019\n\nThe scenes at Dodger Stadium and Nationals Park after Michael A.

Remember, it\u2019s okay to believe.\n\nIn Cincinnati, die-hard Nationals fan Paul Fritschner, who five years ago was the first person in line for the Jayson Werth garden gnome giveaway at Nats Park, could hardly believe his eyes or contain his excitement. His giddy laughter prompted his cousin\u2019s dog to growl. (Forget a gnome; fans should be waiting in line for the unveiling of a Kendrick statue next season.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis was a feeling unlike any other. pic.twitter.com/vAe4HhFWuE \u2014 Paul Fritschner (@PaulFritschner) October 10, 2019\n\nProps to this very excited Nationals fan for ending his recording at the perfect moment.

For the pockets of Nationals fans in attendance, however, the moment was pure jubilation.\n\nRead more on the Nationals:\n\nAD", "description": "The watch party at Nats Park was lit when Washington took the lead after midnight.", "authors": ["Scott Allen", "Reporter Covering D.C.
