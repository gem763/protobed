True to its word, its latest trading update confirms that business is going swimmingly and that earnings guidance has been raised again.'\n\nHe added: 'One of the biggest risks for any gambling company's profit margins is tighter regulation and GVC is no stranger to having to monitor policy changes. Higher taxes as more territories regulate activities would hit margins but operating legally in a regulated territory is something that most investors want.'", "description": "While GVC's finances look set to be given a boost, the group is still ploughing ahead with plans to close 900 of its bricks-and-mortar stores over the next two years.", "authors": ["Jane Denton For Thisismoney", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
