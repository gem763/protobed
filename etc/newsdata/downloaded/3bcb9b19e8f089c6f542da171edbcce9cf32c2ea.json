Activists, seeing a raft of anti-abortion laws weaving their way through the courts, worry how Kavanaugh\u2019s presence will swing the Supreme Court\u2019s view of Roe v. Wade.\n\nDemocrats, perhaps even more than before, fear losing a progressive justice on the bench before regaining control of the White House.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPlanned Sunday protests, set to coincide with the one-year anniversary of the Senate vote, show the anxiety and frustration around Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation are still alive as women once again urge lawmakers to listen and believe assault survivors on the heels of new reporting corroborating allegations of assault against Kavanaugh.\n\nAnd a new Supreme Court session starts Monday, with at least one abortion case on the docket and the possibility that justices will also rule on gay rights and guns.\n\nKavanaugh remains a divisive figure largely because of the allegations of sexual assault leveled against him and memories of Christine Blasey Ford, a college professor from California, testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee, sharing details of the time she said Kavanaugh pinned her down and assaulted her at a high school party as he and a friend laughed.\n\nAfter all, Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch Neil GorsuchSupreme Court abortion case poses major test for Trump picks Overnight Health Care: Supreme Court to hear Louisiana abortion case | US narrowly keeps measles elimination status | Judge expected to keep Massachusetts vaping ban in place Ginsburg predicts historians will call this political era an 'aberration' MORE, another Trump appointee, who took a seat Democrats accused the GOP of stealing from former President Barack Obama Barack Hussein ObamaAxelrod blasts Trump's Romney tweet: He thinks laws and norms 'are for losers' Trump has ordered national security staff cut: report Lawmakers mourn death of 'Julia' star Diahann Carroll MORE, was confirmed by an overwhelming majority with little controversy or backlash from the public at large.\n\nBut Kavanaugh\u2019s influence on D.C. also goes beyond the \u201cMe Too\u201d movement.\n\nThe Supreme Court on Friday announced it would hear arguments about a Louisiana law that would require doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital. Critics say measures like this one are designed to limit access to abortion and activists fear the case could alter the landmark Roe v. Wade decision.\n\nIt will be the first abortion case to reach the high court since Kavanaugh and Gorsuch joined the bench but it likely won\u2019t be the last. A slew of states passed laws this year containing what amount to de facto bans on the procedure. Most have been blocked by the courts and are working their way through the appeals process.\n\nKavanaugh\u2019s views on Roe v. Wade were, outside the allegations of sexual assault, the issue that most galvanized opponents who feared a conservative majority on the court could threaten the landmark ruling.\n\nIt\u2019s an issue that Democrats have used to hit Rep. Susan Collins Susan Margaret CollinsCollins: Trump's call for China to probe Biden 'completely inappropriate' GOP searches for impeachment boogeyman McConnell signaling Trump trial to be quick, if it happens MORE (R-Maine), a deciding vote in Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation.\n\nCollins, a moderate Republican who backs abortion rights, defended her vote in favor of Kavanaugh by saying the justice told her he believes Roe v. Wade is settled law.\n\nCollins is now facing one of the most competitive races in her Senate career, with her most prominent Democratic challenger, Sara Gideon, the leader of the state\u2019s House of Representatives, attacking Collins on her Kavanaugh vote.\n\nGideon raised $1 million the day after announcing her candidacy. The Cook Political Report rates the race as a toss-up.\n\nWhile hoping the Kavanaugh issue could work to their advantage in Senate elections, many Democrats are also deeply fearful another seat may open up before the party takes back control of the White House.

Women across industries and from diverse backgrounds shared stories of sexual harassment and assault, taking down powerful men in entertainment, media and politics \u2014 if not in court, then in public opinion.\n\nCrowds of women protested on Capitol Hill as survivors of assault ridiculed lawmakers for ignoring women.\n\nKavanaugh denied Ford\u2019s allegation. When two more women came forward with their own sexual misconduct allegations against Kavanaugh during his time at Yale University, he again denied he\u2019d done anything improper.\n\nAnd just last month when The New York Times reported a classmate of Kavanaugh saw him harass another classmate, Kavanaugh denied the allegations and much of the Republican party, including President Trump Donald John TrumpTrump criticizes supposed second whistleblower North Korea missile test raises fears of new capabilities Window narrows for Trump trade deals MORE, defended the justice.\n\nThe new allegation came from a former classmate of Kavanaugh named Max Stier who told the Times he saw the now-justice thrust his penis at a female classmate. The Times issued a clarification to note that the story was updated a day after it was published to confirm that the women Stier said Kavanaugh harassed declined to be interviewed for the story. Her friends told reporters she doesn\u2019t recall the incident.\n\nIn addition to the new allegation, the Times reported at least seven people confirmed an allegation Deborah Ramirez made, at the time of Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation hearing, that Kavanaugh thrust his penis at her at a college party. It undermined Kavanaugh\u2019s dismissal of the allegation during his testimony when he said if it had happened it would have been \u201cthe talk of campus.\u201d\n\nKavanaugh was ultimately confirmed in a 50-48 vote, with Sen.
