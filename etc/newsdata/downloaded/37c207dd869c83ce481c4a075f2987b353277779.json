You have no excuse.\n\n\u201c\u2018You have never sung but someone has come to you and said, \u2018Give it a shot\u2019. And that is my motivation\u2019.\u201d\n\n(Image: Martin Bashir)\n\nEven Simon Cowell was moved by Martin's story, telling him \"it is always about the person and the story and we related to your story\".\n\nAnd despite joking he sounded \"like a constipated donkey\", Martin's love of singing stems from his tough childhood.\n\nHe grew up on council estates in London and even spent the first nine months of his life in a homeless shelter when a blaze destroyed the family home.\n\nUntil he was 11, Martin and his family lived in a tiny flat in Wandsworth, south London, before moving to another council estate nearby.\n\nBut despite the lack of money, music and fun were always a key part of his life.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nA Jamaican family lived in the flat above the Bashir's tiny home and would play world music every Saturday night, something Martin describes as \"utterly mesmerising\".\n\nBy the late 60s he was hooked on reggae after growing up in what he calls the \"golden age\".\n\nArtists like Larry Marshall, Delroy Wilson, Gregory Isaacs and Dennis Brown fuelled what he describes as his \"lifelong passion for music\".\n\nSo when Martin was offered the opportunity to appear on the X Factor, he jumped at the chance.\n\nBut he admits it hasn't been without its challenges.\n\nMartin said: \"As I have discovered over the last few months, it's a privilege that comes with considerable pressure.\n\n\"The experience has been one of the most challenging of my life. Good singing is hard work and has required a willingness to be vulnerable and potentially exposed as an outright failure.\"", "description": "The interviewer also has a heartbreaking reason for taking part in the hit ITV show", "authors": ["Jane Lavender", "Image", "Dymond Thames Syco Rex", "Martin Bashir", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20553488.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_The-X-Factor-Celebrity-TV-show-Series-1-Episode-1-12-Oct-2019ed.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
