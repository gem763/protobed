It all comes down to Body Mass Index (BMI), which is a measure of body fat based on a person\u2019s weight, height and age.\n\nSomeone with a BMI of between 25 and 29,9 is said to be overweight, while obesity refers to a person with a BMI over 30. While slightly different, both obesity and being overweight significantly increase one\u2019s risk for several health conditions. But obesity is only a risk factor, and not a guarantee that you will develop these conditions.\n\nREAD MORE: This Injection Is The Latest Development In Weight-Loss Surgery\n\nWith that said, it\u2019s still important to know which conditions one is highly at risk of developing so as to work towards doing regular screenings for these specific conditions and/or decreasing your risk for said conditions.\n\nWhat are the stats for obesity?\n\nJust how prevalent is being overweight and obese in South Africa and the world? Well, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO), worldwide obesity has almost tripled since 1975. Their fact sheet estimates that by 2016, 1,9 billion people over 18 years were overweight and 650 million of them were obese.\n\n\u201cOnce considered a high-income country problem, overweight and obesity are on the rise in low- and middle-income countries, particularly in urban settings,\u201d WHO writes.\n\n\u201cIn Africa, the number of overweight children under 5 has increased by nearly 50% since 2000. Nearly half of the children under 5 who were overweight and obese in 2016 lived in Asia.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s bring all of this back home for a second. According to our Department of Health, about 70% of women and 40% of men are either overweight or obese. That is a staggering stat, but it also shows that you\u2019re not alone\u2026\n\nNow we\u2019ll take a look at the most common health conditions overweight and obese individuals are at risk for:\n\nType-2 diabetes\n\nThe top of this list is type-2 diabetes. According to research, being overweight is the main contributing factor for type-2 diabetes \u2013 and the risk is directly linked with your BMI. The higher the BMI, the higher the risk of developing this condition.\n\nAccording to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), the best way to curb the risk is to try and lose at least 5% of your total body fat as this can delay the onset of type-2 diabetes.\n\nAnd if you are diagnosed with diabetes, you can manage it with lifestyle changes and prescribed treatment.\n\nHigh blood pressure\n\nIf your blood pressure reading is consistently higher than 140/90 mm Hg (\u201c140 over 90\u201d) then you are considered to have high blood pressure, and this can cause some other serious health issues and complications. Obesity is a major risk factor for this condition.\n\nREAD MORE: 5 Things That Up Your Risk Of High Blood Pressure\n\nBut high blood pressure, like diabetes, can be managed with medication and lifestyle changes, including quitting smoking, reducing salt intake and exercising if you are diagnosed.\n\nCardiovascular diseases\n\nObesity is a key risk factor for cardiovascular diseases \u2013 more prominently, heart disease and stroke. This is often the case because of the increased risk of diseases such as high blood pressure and high cholesterol, which negatively impact the heart.\n\nThe high risk of having a stroke when you are obese is also closely linked with obesity\u2019s impact on blood pressure. And the NIDDK writes that one of the best ways to decrease your risk for stroke when you are obese is to make sure that your blood pressure is kept under control. One of the ways to do this is to lose some excess weight; this will not only help in lowering your blood pressure, but can also have a positive effect on cholesterol.\n\nCancers\n\nWHO says that obesity is a risk factor for certain cancers \u2013 specifically:\n\nEndometrial cancer\n\nBreast cancer\n\nOvarian cancer\n\nProstate cancer\n\nLiver cancer\n\nGallbladder cancer (a relatively uncommon cancer)\n\nRenal (kidney) cancer\n\nColon cancer\n\nAdult weight gain in general, even outside of being overweight or obese, increases one\u2019s risk for developing certain cancers. The reason that this is a risk factor is still greatly unknown, but it\u2019s said that trying to avoid weight gain, in general, could decrease one\u2019s risk for certain cancers. And it\u2019s also said that weight loss, in some instances, can also lower one\u2019s cancer risk \u2013 but the research around this hasn\u2019t been very clear.\n\nObstructive sleep apnea\n\nSleep apnea happens when one has pauses in breathing while they\u2019re asleep. This greatly affects sleep quality and can lead to heart conditions. Like diabetes, obesity is the leading risk factor for sleep apnea.\n\nA study on the link between obstructive sleep apnea and obesity found that weight loss had a huge impact on general sleep quality, and greatly reduced the occurrence of dysfunctional breathing during sleep.\n\nREAD MORE: 9 Things You\u2019re Doing In Your Sleep That Signal A Bigger Health Problem\n\n\u201cTo cope with this increasing and seriously preventable health issue, we emphasise the need to minimise the consumption of junk and fast food, [and] increase the consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables,\u201d the study said. \u201cIn addition to making dietary changes, engaging in physical exercise is necessary.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s clear is that a 5% to 7% reduction in your total body fat can do wonders for your health. It\u2019s not about slimming down to the size that you envy when you see pictures of yourself from 10 years ago. It\u2019s more about taking small steps every day to slowly, but surely, improve your overall health and reduce your risk for several health conditions.\n\nThis article was originally published on www.womenshealthsa.co.za\n\nImage credit: iStock", "description": "And why losing just 5% of your body weight can make all the difference.", "authors": ["Yamkela Mdaka"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9159/b3a2a82004ef41569a9d893342b44098.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
