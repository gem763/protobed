It represents real survivors who will be unable to access justice for what they have been subjected to.\u201d\n\nMs Hitchen said while the government is undertaking a review of the handling of rape cases, decisive action was \u201clong overdue\u201d.\n\nThe Centre for Women\u2019s Justice, which is fighting the legal action, said the state was failing to address crimes causing lasting harm to victims and letting the \u201coverwhelming majority of serious sexual offenders get away with it, without even facing trial\u201d.\n\nDirector Harriet Wistrich said: \u201cIf they were concerned by this virtual decriminalisation of rape they would be seeking to do everything possible to put measures in place to reverse this very disturbing trend, whether or not the cause of it lies mainly with their changed approach to decision making, instead of taking a confrontational approach to the litigation we are bringing.\u201d\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Update newsletter preferences\n\nThe CPS has partly blamed the police for referring fewer cases for its consideration, and says it is bound by a code stating that it can only prosecute where there is a \u201crealistic prospect of conviction\u201d.\n\nBut Dame Vera Baird, the victims\u2019 commissioner for England and Wales, said only a decade ago the CPS was charging 40 per cent of rape cases and vowed to increase that figure.\n\n\u201cFewer cases are going to CPS from police [4,370 last year to 3,375 this year] but more cases are falling out of the system because of CPS charging decisions,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cThere are many committed police officers and excellent lawyers involved in rape cases, but the harder it is to get a charge, the fewer police referrals there will be in a circle of discouragement which needs to be reversed urgently.\u201d\n\nResearch released earlier this year suggested tens of thousands of rape cases were dropped by victims before the charging stage because police investigations were worsening their trauma.\n\nOne woman who was raped by a stranger told The Independent she withdrew her complaint after officers claimed they would not be able to charge the suspect without examining the entire contents of her mobile phone.\n\n\u201cIt made me very angry, it made me feel like I was the one on trial and they were trying to seek out ways it was my fault,\u201d Sarah* said, adding she was concerned evidence of past one-night stands could be used against her in court.\n\nAnother, who faced the same demand despite the Metropolitan Police identifying her attacker using DNA, told The Independent the investigation felt like \u201cone intrusion after another\u201d.\n\nJane* said: \u201cI\u2019m not actually sure I would have gone ahead with the case if I\u2019d known what was part of the process.\u201d\n\nBonny Turner, who waived her anonymity to reveal how her alleged attacker was not prosecuted after appearing to \u201cconfess\u201d to raping her in a Facebook message, described being questioned for five hours at a police station and called the investigation \u201ccompletely re-traumatising\u201d.\n\nClaire Waxman, the London victims\u2019 commissioner, is calling for complainants to have fully funded legal support while their personal records and communications are scrutinised.\n\n\u201cThese steps are vital \u2013 we urgently need to see drastic improvements in how rape victims are treated across the board, so that they have confidence to come forward and report a crime, and know that they will be treated fairly and have the support they need to access justice,\u201d she said.\n\nStatistics released by the Home Office on Thursday showed prosecutions dropping for every crime type, following warnings of a justice \u201ccrisis\u201d.\n\nOnly 3.3 per cent of all sex offences resulted in a charge or summons to court in the year to June, 5.4 per cent of thefts, 7.8 per cent of violent crimes and 7.1 per cent of robberies.\n\nThe prosecution rate for all crimes dropped to 7.4 per cent from 8.7 per cent the previous year \u2013 a fall of 41,700 offences.\n\nThe overall proportion of investigations that were closed as a result of \u201cevidential difficulties\u201d increased from 29 per cent to a third in the year, and almost half ended with no suspect identified.\n\nIn the same period, the average time between police recording a crime and assigning an outcome rose from six to nine days.\n\nYvette Cooper, chair of the Home Affairs Committee, said: \u201cWe have warned for a long time that the scale of cuts to policing was undermining justice \u2013 these figures are stark evidence of that as more victims are being let down.\u201d\n\nThe Police Federation, which represents rank-and-file officers, blamed the loss of almost 22,000 police officers since 2010 and a \u201ccrisis in detective policing\u201d.\n\nThe National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council admitted too few crimes were being solved.\n\nChief constable Andy Cooke said: \u201cThis is a symptom of the strain on policing as we try to manage growing crime and demand that is ever more complex.\u201d\n\nThe CPS has announced an independent review of its rape charging decisions as part of the government review.\n\nA spokesperson said prosecutors could only charge cases referred by police and in accordance with its legal test, adding: \u201cWe know the fall in referrals and charges is a concern and are working with police colleagues and the wider criminal justice system to understand and address the complex reasons behind it.\u201d\n\n*Names have been changed to protect anonymity", "description": "Authorities have been accused of \u201cdecriminalising\u201d sex attacks after official statistics
