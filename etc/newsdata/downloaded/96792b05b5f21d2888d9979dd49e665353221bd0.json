Why would they \u2014 why would they invite me?\n\n\u201cI felt that I ostracized myself by my behavior, by the past, by living with all the regrets of my mistakes, that I sort of wore a hair shirt and beat myself up most of the day thinking and regretting why did I make such a mistake?\n\n(Image: SplashNews.com)\n\n\"Why have I made so many mistakes? So I did spend a good three hours on that.\"\n\nFergie's daughters with Prince Andrew \u2014 Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie \u2014 attended the ceremony at London\u2019s Westminster Abbey.\n\nThe historic church was also the venue for Ferguson\u2019s wedding to Prince Andrew in 1986. The couple divorced in 1996.\n\nShe added: \u201cIt was so difficult. Because I wanted to be there with my girls, and to be getting them dressed and to go as a family. And also it was so hard because the last (royal) bride up that aisle was me.\"\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nShe continued: \u201cThey did a great job. And I really love the feeling that sort of Diana and I both weren\u2019t there.\n\n\"But I\u2019m here to say how proud she would have been and Kate looked utterly beautiful\u201d.\n\nFergie was invited to Prince Harry's wedding to Meghan Markle at Windsor Castle in 2018.\n\nHowever, she did not receive an invitation to the evening reception at Frogmore House hosted by Prince Charles, and was reportedly \"deeply upset\" by her exclusion.\n\n(Image: PA Archive/PA Images)\n\n(Image: Brett D. Cove / SplashNews.com)\n\nShe is also believed to have a fractious relationship with Prince Philip.\n\nNext year, the Duchess will see eldest daughter Princess Beatrice, 31, walk down the aisle and marry Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi - having already watched with delight as Princess Eugenie, 29, tied the knot to Jack Brooksbank in 2018.\n\nHowever, Beatrice is reportedly opting out of Royal protocol to have a low-key reception venue instead of a grand event at Windsor like that of her sister's wedding a year ago.", "description": "Sarah 'Fergie' Ferguson, The Duchess of York, has revealed her sadness at being excluded from Kate Middleton's wedding to Prince William in 2011", "authors": ["Amber Hicks", "Image", "Brett D.
