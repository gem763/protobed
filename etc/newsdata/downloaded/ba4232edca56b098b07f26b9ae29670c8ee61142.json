Most items that come in plus size are either too loose-fitting, or only come in dark colours, or both. That is how Gloria Tsui Hiu-ming felt, and why she decided to design her own clothing for curvier figures.\n\nShe opened a shop called My Rules Hong Kong in May last year, and set up an Instagram account \u2013 where she would promote the items in her store \u2013 which now has more than 10,000 followers.\n\nHow social media can be a force for good\n\nThe 24-year-old says she wanted her store to encourage plus-size girls like herself to step out of their comfort zone and feel confident about dressing up. She explains that many \u201cfei mui\u201d, a Cantonese term for plus-size girls, often shy away from bright-coloured clothes, fearing they would draw unwanted attention.\n\n\u201cA lot of the clothes I bought from stores, because there were not many options, looked like giant pieces of black cloth that are meant to [hide] my body. It was so difficult to find clothing that was fashionable and size-friendly,\u201d says Tsui.\n\n\u201cSo then I thought, why not create a brand of my own and design clothes that I actually liked? That\u2019s why I opened this shop.\u201d\n\nGloria Tsui Hiu-ming said it was difficult for her to find colourful clothing with diverse patterns in her size in Hong Kong, so she decided to make her own.

She would hear a lot of comments like, \u201cYou\u2019d look great if you lost some weight,\u201d making her feel like she was not attractive.\n\nThese remarks pushed Tsui to take drastic measures to lose weight, including extreme workouts, not eating, and taking weight loss pills. She lost 45kg, but even after that, she found it was not still enough in other people\u2019s eyes.\n\n\u201cI thought I already looked much better after losing 45kg, but people still told me I wasn\u2019t slim enough,\u201d she says.\n\nTsui designs colourful clothes so that plus-size women have more options. Photo: YP cadet Hannah Ma\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t understand why people had to be so judgmental.\u201d\n\nTsui felt defeated and was eventually diagnosed with depression. She got professional help, and with the support of her friends and family, was able to get back on her feet after a year.\n\nLooking back, she said what helped her most during that dark time was accepting that she could never please every person in the world.\n\nThe 5 best makeup brands to look for at Sephora\n\n\u201cIt took me a long time to see that people will always be judgmental, regardless of my size. So why should I care so much about their standards? Why can\u2019t I follow my own rules?\u201d\n\nAfter learning to embrace her own body, Tsui hopes she can help other girls to do the same.\n\nAs well as selling stylish clothing, she also sits down with her customers once a week to do a live stream on either Facebook or Instagram, and discuss a wide range of topics from beauty, fashion, and romance.\n\nWhat celebrity wardrobe would you love to raid?\n\nTsui\u2019s effort to promote body positivity is sometimes met with criticism, with people saying she should not be advocating being plus size because it is \u201cunhealthy\u201d. Tsui clarifies all she wants to do is make plus-size girls know that they, too, have the right to feel beautiful.\n\n\u201cUltimately, what you wear is not the most important thing,\u201d Tsui says. \u201cAs long as you have a kind heart, I believe you will look beautiful.\u201d", "description": "The style guru talks representation and teaching other women that they have a right to feel beautiful", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/gloriatsui1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
