He\u2019s a punishing runner with a knack for reaching the end zone.\n\nHoward leads the Philadelphia Eagles (3-2) with 248 yards rushing, an average of 4.7 yards per carry and five touchdowns (four rushing, one receiving). He has split time with rookie Miles Sanders, but is earning a featured role.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s kind of the guy that you kind of settle down in the run game and give him those touches,\u201d Eagles coach Doug Pederson said. \u201cHe\u2019s a between-the-tackles guy. He\u2019s big and powerful. He has good vision. And I really think Miles is learning from Jordan running the ball, which is a positive. I think as we go, Jordan has been the lead back the last couple of games for sure. But Miles is learning and coming, and we are really happy with both of them.\u201d\n\nHoward has been a team player since his arrival in Philadelphia, following a trade with Chicago.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m comfortable with whatever role they give me,\u201d he said. \u201cAny running back likes to get touches to get in a rhythm but me and Miles work hand-in-hand along with Darren (Sproles) and when Corey (Clement) gets his opportunity, he\u2019ll take advantage as well. So I just look forward to it.\u201d\n\nHoward had 3,370 yards rushing and 24 touchdowns in three seasons with the Bears. A fifth-round pick in 2016, he went to the Pro Bowl as a rookie. But he lost some touches to Tarik Cohen in 2017-18 and was traded to the Eagles for a conditional sixth-round pick in March.\n\n\u201cI pretty much knew what was happening,\u201d Howard said. \u201cI just didn\u2019t know where I was going. Coming to a winning team pumped me up. My first two years, I didn\u2019t win. I was enjoying winning last year and I was glad to be coming to another team that had success in the previous year, so I was really excited about it.\u201d\n\nSanders, a second-round pick, had an impressive preseason, but is averaging only 3.6 yards per carry. Sanders has been more effective as a receiver, catching 10 passes for 133 yards, including three long gains. He\u2019s also solid in pass protection.\n\n\u201cOur relationship has been great,\u201d Howard said. \u201cI know he\u2019s young and hungry and ready to prove himself. I remember being like that my rookie year. He\u2019s a smart kid and he\u2019s picked up on a lot of things very fast. We also have a great coach, Duce Staley, so he keeps him up to speed as well.\u201d\n\nHoward, who turns 25 on Nov. 2, is in the final year of his rookie contract. He could earn a lucrative deal if he puts up big numbers. But the Eagles like to spread the ball around, mix up their backs and their offense is centered around Carson Wentz\u2019s throwing arm.\n\nHoward is fine with that.\n\n\u201cJust having a lot of options, a lot of talent, as many guys that touch the ball, it\u2019ll make it that much harder to stop us, so I\u2019m all for it,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Eagles relied on Howard and Sanders in a win at Green Bay on Sept. 26. The duo combined for 159 of the team\u2019s 176 yards rushing. Running the ball effectively could be a formula for success with three straight road games coming up, starting this week at Minnesota (3-2).\n\nIt\u2019s Howard\u2019s time to shine.\n\n\u201cYou can just tell he\u2019s an experienced runner,\u201d offensive coordinator Mike Groh said. \u201cHe\u2019s obviously really strong with the ball in his hands. He\u2019s decisive. He has good vision. He shows the ability to stick his foot in the ground and then he pushes the pile. He\u2019s generally falling forward for additional yards, rarely knocked back. He\u2019s a strong runner. He brings that tenacity to our offense.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Jordan Howard does everything quietly except when he has the ball.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Rob Maaddi"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/10/jets_eagles_football_38951_c0-215-5121-3200_s1770x1032.jpg?d47c7acb49db772e9923633709100348eb808d48", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
