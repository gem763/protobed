This was one of those triumphant cry moments for me. My whole life has been a fight,\u201d she wrote.\n\nQuinlivan added that she was \u201cdeeply humbled\u201d about her appointment and expressed her pride in representing her community:\n\n\u201cThis was a victory that made all of that sh*t worth it. I had walked two shows for Chanel while I was living in stealth (stealth meaning I hadn\u2019t made my trans identity public yet) and when I came out I knew I\u2019d stop working with some brands, I thought I\u2019d never work with the iconic house of Chanel ever again. But here I am in Chanel Beauty Advertising.\u201d\n\nThe model ended her post with an inspiring message of resilience and perseverance, emphasising her remarkable journey in the industry:\n\n\"The world will kick you down, spit on you, and tell you you\u2019re worthless. It\u2019s your job to have the strength to stand up and push on, to keep fighting, Because if you give up then you will never experience the tears of triumph,\" she wrote.\n\nQuinlivan joins Andreja Pejic and Victoria\u2019s Secret model, Valentina Sampaio, in the new crop of transgender models making waves in the fashion industry. Chanel\u2019s decision to work with Quinlivan marks a positive step forward for progress in fashion.\n\nAfter coming out as transgender in 2017, Quinlivan has become an advocate and spokesperson for the trans community and has hosted two TED talks about identity and self-esteem.", "description": "Teddy Quinlivan has become the first openly transgender model to feature\u00a0in a\u00a0Chanel\u00a0beauty campaign.
