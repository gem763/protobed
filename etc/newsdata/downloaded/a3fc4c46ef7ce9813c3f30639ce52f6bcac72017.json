(Moritz Hager/Reuters)\n\nAfter an unceremonious fall from grace, the former Trump strategist pivots to the silver screen.\n\nRemember Steve Bannon? After being forced to step down as White House chief strategist in August 2017, Bannon returned to Breitbart News, which he ran before taking over the Trump campaign. In the intervening months, his relationship with the president soured. Trump referred to his former employee as \u201cSloppy Steve\u201d after Bannon called Donald Trump Jr.\u2019s meeting with Russians during the 2016 campaign \u201ctreasonous.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHaving lost access to the White House, Bannon spent a few months in Europe organizing what he called \u201cthe Movement,\u201d an initiative to bolster nationalism across the continent. Though populists saw gains in France, Italy, the U.K., and Hungary last year, most declined Bannon\u2019s help in the 2019 European parliamentary elections. One of Bannon\u2019s most stalwart allies, Marine Le Pen, said he \u201cwas playing no role in [her] campaign.\u201d After discovering that most European nations bar foreigners from polling and contributing to campaigns, the Movement has since scaled down its operation. Meanwhile, Bannon attempted to start the Dignitatis Humanae Institute, a right-wing answer to George Soros\u2019s Open Society Foundation. The plan went awry after Italy\u2019s ministry of culture revoked the group\u2019s lease on its intended headquarters, a monastery outside Rome. The group is challenging the decision in court.\n\nFollowing these setbacks, Bannon has returned to the silver screen, familiar territory for the banker-turned-revolutionary who bankrolled his first film in 1991. Last year, he produced Trump@War, a documentary aimed at consolidating support for Republicans ahead of the 2018 midterm elections. Last Saturday, his newest production, Claws of the Red Dragon, premiered on One America News Network, which Bannon calls \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s new favorite network.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe film dramatizes the arrest of Meng Wanzhou, CFO of Huawei and daughter of its chief executive. Its 54 minutes revolve around a Chinese-Canadian Vancouver Post reporter covering the Meng arrest. It is an unmistakably low-budget affair, wherein members of the Chinese Politburo hatch schemes in dark, sparse rooms; a Canadian Huawei employee turns a blind eye to the company\u2019s malfeasance in order to win a promotion; and Meng\u2019s case gets delayed while she lives lavishly, out on bail. But it comes at an inflection point in America\u2019s perception of China. Last week\u2019s revelations of Chinese Communist party influence on American corporations \u2014 including the NBA, Disney, and Apple \u2014 have drawn the ire of the political class and the public at large.\n\nThis context partially explains the fawning reaction from the audience at the film\u2019s private premiere at the Walt Disney screening room in New York on Thursday. But they didn\u2019t exactly need convincing. Bannon boasted that those in attendance comprised \u201chawks and super-hawks.\u201d (At least one-third were reporters.) Sporting his usual garb \u2014 a field jacket over two dark dress shirts \u2014 Bannon prefaced the film with remarks on America\u2019s \u201ceconomic war\u201d with China.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the two years since he left the White House, his rhetoric on China has not changed. America\u2019s confrontation with China represents the \u201cgreat geopolitical struggle of the 21st century.\u201d Trump is not simply pushing to reform Chinese business practices; he is \u201cdefending the Westphalian nation-state system.\u201d Referencing Thucydides, Genghis Khan, and Alexander the Great, Bannon argues that the Chinese have moved to \u201ccontrol the Eurasian landmass, control the naval chokepoints, and control the rim of Asia.\u201d For the duration of the screening, our would-be Hephaestion clutched Unrestricted Warfare (1999), a book by two People\u2019s Liberation Army colonels who outlined China\u2019s strategy for military predominance.\n\nAfter the film, Bannon emphasized the importance of using entertainment for political ends, quoting the late Andrew Breitbart\u2019s mantra that \u201cpolitics is downstream from culture.\u201d Before becoming CEO of Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign, he produced a number of documentaries on what he sees as an epochal fight between the West and its enemies. The enemies include illegal immigration, Islam, the Occupy Wall Street movement, and now China. Bannon waxes poetic about galvanizing a popular movement against China, though it is not altogether clear how a 54-minute Canadian production gets us there.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the film, Bannon courted a group of journalists. I asked him about Trump\u2019s progress with China, the latest development of which is a partial deal that sidesteps America\u2019s most pressing grievances. \u201cI\u2019m not a supporter of doing a small deal,\u201d he says. Bannon believes that unless the president pushes for a complete victory, the Chinese will continue to renege on agreements. \u201cAs soon as [Chinese authorities] get back, the first thing they say is, \u2018Well, we don\u2019t know if we\u2019re gonna do the purchases or not, we need the December tariffs removed, and we need another meeting,\u2019\u201d he argues, citing the preliminary stipulations of Friday\u2019s agreement.\n\nBannon nonetheless wholeheartedly supports the Trump administration, claiming that the president has invigorated the American public and political class alike in the nation\u2019s standoff with China. But underlying his rhetoric, and the tone of the film, is a rift between himself and policymakers larger than many onlookers realize. The president is the self-styled master of the deal, telling the press last week that an agreement \u201cis going to be just fantastic for China and fantastic for the United States.\u201d This would be a nightmarish outcome for Bannon. \u201cFor the hawks, we hope it\u2019s not moving forward,\u201d Bannon tells me. \u201cWe want to drive a stake in the ground.\u201d In this Manichean, global struggle, there is a winner and a loser \u2014 nothing in between.", "description": "The former Trump strategist waxes poetic about galvanizing a popular movement against China.", "authors": ["Daniel Tenreiro", "Robert Verbruggen", "Andrew C.
