Papua and West Papua provinces, the resource-rich western part of the island of New Guinea, were formerly a Dutch colony that was incorporated into Indonesia after a widely criticised U.N.-backed referendum in 1969.\n\nNational police spokesman Dedi Prasetyo told journalists late on Monday that separatist leader Benny Wenda, who has political asylum in Britain, had provided funding for his network of supporters, and instructed them to organise mass gatherings and prepare weapons.\n\n\u201cThe riots in Papua were by design,\u201d Prasetyo said, adding that Wenda\u2019s United Liberation Movement for West Papua (ULMWP) was trying to force the issue onto the agenda of the current sessions of the United Nations Human Rights Council.\n\nGiving the update on the number of people arrested, Prasetyo did not specify what charges they faced, but he said two of the suspects were \u201cthe intellectual actors\u201d who \u201cdesigned the riots\u201d. He said police were still hunting 20 more suspects.\n\nSpeaking to Reuters by telephone, Wenda denied orchestrating the protests, and demanded that the government explain the heavy-handed response of security forces to the \u201cpeaceful demonstrations\u201d.\n\nWenda\u2019s ULMWP issued a report on Monday saying more than 200,000 Papuans took part in the protests, which saw the unfurling of \u201cMorning Star\u201d flags - a banned separatist symbol - at several government offices. The report also accused security forces of causing the death of 11 civilians.\n\nPolice spokesman Prasetyo said only three civilians and one military personnel died, most of them as a result of being struck by arrows. In Papua, the traditional bow and arrow is still used for hunting and as a weapon.\n\nAccusing the Indonesian military of \u201ckilling my people\u201d, Wenda urged the United Nations to discuss Papua at its meetings in New York and asked Indonesia to allow U.N. officials to visit Papua.\n\nIndonesian officials have said that foreigners are currently barred from visiting Papua for security reasons.\n\nIn Jakarta, President Joko Widodo met with Papuan leaders and students at the presidential palace on Tuesday in a bid to soothe tensions. He offered employment at state firms for Papuan college graduates and more development in a region that has the highest poverty levels nationally.\n\nThe latest protests followed racist slurs against Papuan students, whose dormitory was tear-gassed during their detention in the city of Surabaya on Java island on Aug. 17, Indonesia\u2019s Independence Day, for allegedly desecrating a national flag.\n\nAn internet blackout had been lifted for most parts of Papua after three weeks, though it remained in place for major cities like Jayapura, Manokwari and Sorong.", "description": "Police in Papua have arrested 85 suspects since ethnic unrest erupted in Indonesia's easternmost region in mid-August, a spokesman said, accusing a separatist leader based in Britain of fomenting Papua's most serious civil strife in years.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190910&t=2&i=1428225629&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF890F6", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
