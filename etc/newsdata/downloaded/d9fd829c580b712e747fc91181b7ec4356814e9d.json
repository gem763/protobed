He points out that the nature and pervasiveness of state capture have perplexed the minds of rational, ethical human beings.\n\nSimilarly, addressing Parliament's portfolio committee on public enterprises recently, Molefe spoke of the lingering shadow of state capture, even as the entity works to improve its audit outcomes and credit rating.\n\nHe is right: we are still perplexed by what happened. It is difficult to believe that people could rig tenders of such magnitude \u2013 allegedly with little or no oversight, according to evidence heard at the state capture inquiry \u2013 and hope that it would never come out. Corruption even infiltrated the company\u2019s Treasury department, the financial heart of any organisation.\n\nThis has hopefully raised the alertness of many South Africans. We should jealously safeguard public assets that are key to the economic wellbeing of the country and make sure state capture does not rear its head again. We must do this as a mark of economic patriotism as opposed to the economic sabotage that was the hallmark of state capture.\n\nFrom all that emerged during the Zondo Commission of Inquiry, Molefe says, \"It appears corruption has become a culture within SOC\u2019s (state-owned companies) and across the national spectrum.\"\n\nFunds to tackle corruption\n\nMolefe offers advice on how to deal with the scourge of corruption beyond normal investigations and commissions of inquiries. \"It may well be helpful for the state to create a fund and forum for the widespread re-education of our people about the impact of corruption,\" he writes in the Transnet report.\n\nI would add that it\u2019s not only the state that should do this; the private sector should also make a contribution. Introspection is required among all economic players. Ethical business practices should not be negotiable.\n\nBy proposing a widespread re-education in ethics, Molefe shows he is optimistic that things can change. He makes what appear to be obvious but nonetheless a brilliant observation we should all take notice of: \"We cannot detach corruption from human choice.\" In fact, many of the challenges we face as a country have to do with the choices we make.\n\nWe know what are the right things that need to be done. We know what should be in the interest of the nation and what\u2019s in the narrow interest of individuals and groupings.\n\nWe also know that individuals and groupings standing for their own selfish interests have a sophisticated, illegal and unethical way of behaving as if their interests are necessarily those of the nation. The question of \"human choice\" is fundamental to the national economic interests. It has implication for national choices too.\n\nMolefe reaffirms Transnet\u2019s mandate. He states: \"Our purpose is to make the country commercially competitive in a rapidly changing global context by lowering the cost of doing business in South Africa, enabling economic growth and ensuring security of supply in providing ports, rail and pipeline infrastructure in a cost-effective manner.\"\n\nThe rail and ports aspects of Transnet\u2019s competitiveness is crucial for the mining sector. The commitments regarding the coal sector, as detailed in the Transnet annual report, are commendable. The company plans to improve its Wagon Cycle Time for coal from the current 64. 2 hours to 63.8 hours. It is being realistic after it missed the 2019 target of 58 hours.\n\nThe service to the coal sector as well as other bulk minerals is critical to Transnet Freight Rail, the company\u2019s biggest division that accounts for 59% of Transnet\u2019s R74.1 billion revenue. There is a mutually beneficial relationship between the coal producers and Transnet. South Africa\u2019s coal economy is dependent on Transnet Freight Rail, which employs over 31 000 people countrywide.\n\nIt is encouraging to read Transnet management\u2019s comments in the annual report that the company is committed to generating strong cash flow, maintaining affordable levels of debt without government support, and reporting year-on-year improvement in financial performance.\n\nThis provides comfort that the industry sectors supported by Transnet will continue to get required service as its governance challenges are being tackled. Transnet has an opportunity to bring credibility to the idea that the state has the ability to run a complex logistics company in the interest of the economy as a whole.\n\nBayoglu is the executive chair of Canyon Coal.
