Bakers on the show happen to be openly gay, rather than in a hushed \"he/she has a secret\" way. And over 10 years of GBBO the show has led the way.\"\n\nFormer Star Baker Edd then responded: \"I was just talking about this on the podcast, the fact that every season has had gay contestants is such a wonderful thing.\"\n\nEdd then told how he had received homophobic comments from viewers when the competition was shown on TV.\n\nHe explained: \"I think most of the stuff that was said on camera never made to it air. I got a little bit of online abuse for it during and after the show but thankfully it was generally a very positive experience. \"\n\nHe then added: \"I can never understand anyone, especially another gay person, who could publicly post hateful things towards another person.\"\n\nAfter winning the show in 2010, Edd left his bank job and went on to publish three cookbooks, Say It With Cake, The Boy Who Bakes and Patisserie Made Simple.", "description": "Edd Kimber spoke out in a discussion about the baking show being 'LGBTQ-affirmative'", "authors": ["Lucy Needham", "Image", "Pa Archive Pa Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article13501850.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Queens-90th-birthday-celebrations.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
