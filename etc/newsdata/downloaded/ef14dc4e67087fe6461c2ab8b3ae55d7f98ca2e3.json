They only have one offensive touchdown in three games, they\u2019ve never defeated Philadelphia in 10 tries and they\u2019re 13\u00bd-point underdogs.\n\nStill, the Eagles (2-2) can\u2019t overlook New York on Sunday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all pros,\u201d defensive tackle Fletcher Cox said. \u201cLet\u2019s be real, we\u2019re 2-2. We have to go out and attack as if anybody else is coming in here.\u201d\n\nThe Eagles lost their previous home game to Detroit two weeks ago and have started slow in their first four games, getting outscored 27-10 in the first quarter. They don\u2019t want to allow the Jets to jump ahead early, build momentum and think they can steal a win.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not 0-3 because of their defense,\u201d tight end Zach Ertz said. \u201cIt\u2019s a really talented defense and, as an offense, it\u2019s going to be a good test for us.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s some things to watch for when the Jets visit the Eagles:\n\nSAM\u2019S MONO\n\nJets quarterback Sam Darnold was uncertain to return this week as he continued to recover from mononucleosis, which sidelined him the past two games.\n\nHe was cleared for non-contact activity and was limited at the start of the practice week, but tests later in the week would help determine if he will play Sunday. Darnold\u2019s enlarged spleen is the primary focus, with the swelling of the organ needing to dissipate before he\u2019s cleared by doctors for contact.\n\nJets coach Adam Gase said the team could potentially wait until Sunday to decide if Darnold or practice squad QB-turned-starter Luke Falk will be under center against the Eagles.\n\n\u201cWe have to be flexible in practice,\u201d Gase said. \u201cWe start going and kind of see how it goes. The good thing about Luke being as sharp as he is knowing the offense, he\u2019ll get reps in practice. We have some changes in practice where we\u2019re doing more reps, so it works out for us.\u201d\n\nFalk went 12 of 22 for 98 yards in his NFL starting debut, a 30-14 loss to New England in Week 3.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m taking the same approach,\u201d Falk said. \u201cTrying to learn the game plan, prepare yourself to play and whatever the decision is, just move forward.\u201d\n\nCONFIDENT CARSON\n\nEagles quarterback Carson Wentz only threw for 160 yards in a 34-27 win at Green Bay, but tossed three touchdowns and posted a 113.2 passer rating. Now in his fourth season in coach Doug Pederson\u2019s offense, Wentz is even more comfortable than he was when he finished third in NFL MVP voting two years ago.\n\n\u201cProbably the biggest thing is just understanding more of the offense, knowing where everybody is,\u201d Pederson said. \u201cHe\u2019s getting the ball out of his hand. He\u2019s making great decisions with the football, getting us in and out of maybe a bad play into a better play. We\u2019ve used probably a little more tempo offense or no-huddle offense which allows him to see the defense, which he\u2019s very good at doing.\u201d\n\nWALKING WOUNDED\n\nDespite the bye-week break, the Jets could still be missing several key contributors aside from Darnold.\n\nInside linebacker C.J. Mosley could miss his third straight game while dealing with a groin injury. Left guard Kelechi Osemele (shoulder/knee), linebacker Jordan Jenkins (calf), wide receiver Demaryius Thomas (hamstring) and running back/kick returner Trenton Cannon (hamstring) were also uncertain to play for New York.\n\nMeanwhile, the Eagles are depleted in the secondary. Cornerbacks Ronald Darby (hamstring) and Avonte Maddox (neck/concussion) are likely out and Sidney Jones (hamstring) is uncertain. Also, wide receiver DeSean Jackson (abdomen) is likely going to miss his third straight game.\n\nGROUNDED JETS\n\nNew York\u2019s offense has struggled to get much of anything going through three games, scoring just 11 points.\n\nA lot of the issues stem from the quarterback troubles and starting three players at the spot in as many games. Even the defense has outscored the offense, accounting for 15 points so far.\n\nThird down has been a big problem for the Jets, who are just 9 of 43 (20.9 percent) in those situations. They also have just 36 first downs, compared to 60 by their opponents.\n\nFAMILIAR FACE\n\nJets general manager Joe Douglas was Philadelphia\u2019s vice president of player personnel the previous three seasons.\n\n\u201cYou can know as much as you want to know, but they\u2019re still good players,\u201d Gase said. \u201cHe knows that roster inside and out. He can help at least tell us what kind of guys they are and kind of how they work and what might be some weaknesses. But you\u2019re talking about a team that won a Super Bowl two years ago. They\u2019re pretty deep. They have a lot of really good players.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP Pro Football Writer Dennis Waszak Jr. contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The standings are a reality check for the Philadelphia Eagles when they host the winless New York Jets.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Rob Maaddi"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/03/eagles_football_28825_c0-203-4830-3019_s1770x1032.jpg?06aac6d4be220180bf489c4a1c04727618a807e1"}
