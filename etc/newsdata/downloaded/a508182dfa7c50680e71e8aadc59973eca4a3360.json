And that\u2019s, to be fair, happening in a lot of different sources and places online and in others and it\u2019s one reason why, as a candidate, it\u2019s healthy just not to read too many clips about yourself to begin with. But I don\u2019t want to take away from the very important work that\u2019s being done in the queer media right now.\u201d\n\nMr. Buttigieg is currently polling at 6.2%, according to the Real Clear Politics national average.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
