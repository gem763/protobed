Corbyn has promised to hold a second referendum if he wins power and give British voters the option to remain in the EU.\n\nOn Monday, Johnson accused Corbyn of being \u201cchicken\u201d for denying him a snap poll for the third time in recent weeks.\n\nBut as the Scottish National Party (SNP) and Liberal Democrats looked to set to give the prime minister the majority he needs to pass legislation forcing a pre-Christmas election, Corbyn was effectively forced to row in behind the plan.\n\nThe Labour leader told his shadow cabinet this morning: \u201cI have consistently said that we are ready for an election and our support is subject to a no-deal Brexit being off the table.\n\n\u201cWe have now heard from the EU that the extension of Article 50 to January 31 has been confirmed, so for the next three months, our condition of taking no deal off the table has now been met.\n\n\u201cWe will now launch the most ambitious and radical campaign for real change our country has ever seen.\u201d\n\nJohnson also looks set to overcome the one remaining obstacle to getting MPs\u2019 approval for an election after a No. 10 source indicated that the prime minister was willing to compromise on the date.\n\nThe prime minister had proposed a Dec. 12 poll, but the SNP and Lib Dems are demanding an earlier vote on Dec. 9, arguing more students will still be at university and able to vote on the earlier date.\n\nThe source indicated the government was willing to accept a compromise date of Dec. 11, and would agree to amend the early parliamentary election bill on Tuesday to specify this.\n\nJohnson called for an election after being forced to break his pledge to leave the EU by Oct. 31.\n\nHe has also dropped his Brexit deal to get SNP and Lib Dem backing for a snap poll.\n\nIt effectively pitches the first winter election in decades as a battle for Brexit.\n\nThis story has been updated.", "description": "The Labour leader backed Prime Minister Boris Johnson's plan for a Brexit election, telling his party that leaving the EU without a deal was \"off the tab...", "authors": ["Deputy Political Editor", "Huffpost Uk"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5db81e85210000023534b587.jpeg?cache=qmzbzzogsz&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
