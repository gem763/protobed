Add Interest\n\nThe request comes as part of a continued feud between the Trump administration and congressional Democrats over compliance with the congressional impeachment inquiry.\n\nThe former aide, Charles Kupperman, served as the United States Deputy National Security Advisor for President Donald Trump. In his role, Kupperman would have worked closely with former National Security Adviser John Bolton, who has become a close focus of House Democrats as they zero in on their probe.\n\nIn the filing, submitted late Friday evening, Kupperman\u2019s attorney asks the judge to sort out \"irreconcilable commands\" coming from the House Judiciary committee and the White House.\n\nJonathan Ernst/Reuters\n\nKupperman was subpoenaed on Friday to testify as part of the ongoing impeachment investigation.\n\nThe Trump administration, however, has maintained that Kupperman is entitled to constitutional immunity from the subpoena because \"Congress may not constitutionally compel the president\u2019s senior advisers to testify about their official duties,\" due to the separation of powers between the legislative branch and the executive branch.\n\nKupperman, in the complaint, says that he cannot satisfy the competing demands of both congress and the administration, and asks which branch's command should prevail.\n\nThe lawsuit asks the judge to determine both whether the House\u2019s subpoena is authorized and whether the president's assertion of constitutional immunity is valid.\n\nKupperman is currently scheduled to appear before the committee on October 28. Kupperman\u2019s attorney requested that the judge expedite the decision in the case, \"in light of the impending impeachment proceedings.\"\n\nSo far, eight individuals have testified as part of the impeachment probe despite direction from the executive branch for administration officials not to appear. Other administration officials have resisted appearing for testimony and turning over documents.", "description": "A former National Security official is asking a federal judge in Washington to weigh in on whether he must appear on Monday to testify in the ongoing impeachment probe.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/bolton-remarks_hpMain_20191025-232719_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
