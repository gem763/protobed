It is harder to double the market value of a $100 billion company than a $1 billion company.\u201d \u2014 Warren Buffett, 2014\n\nA couple of weeks ago, I wrote a column, \u201cHas Warren Buffett Lost his Magic Touch?\u201d (September 6, 2019 Skousen CAF\u00c9)\n\nI noted that the Oracle of Omaha had fairly consistently beaten the market since he took over Berkshire Hathaway in 1965. I\u2019ve been a long-time shareholder of the company and have benefited from his incredible run.\n\nBut this year, he has vastly underperformed the market, which is up 18% year to date. Is this the end of an era?\n\nIt may be. Business Insider published the following incredible chart demonstrating that Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway performance gradually has lost its ability to beat the market. (Thanks to Nicholas Vardy of the Oxford Club for pointing out this chart.)\n\nChart Courtesy of Business Insider\n\nWhat\u2019s fascinating is that his ability to beat the market peaked in 1985, the year Buffett turned 55. Buffett is 89 years old today.\n\nBoth numbers are Fibonacci numbers!\n\nFibonacci numbers (2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34.\u2026) are a fascinating mathematical sequence that technical traders use to determine the tops and bottoms of markets.\n\nMy goal is to keep writing my newsletter, Forecasts & Strategies, until my next Fibonacci number (age 89) \u2014 in 2036!\n\nBuffett Recommends Indexing!\n\nSince 2014, Buffett has recommended that investors and even his own family members invest in a stock index fund. They should not count on his investment company to outperform in the future.\n\nThe reason? Berkshire is just too big. In his 2014 annual letter to shareholders, Buffett admitted that \u201cBerkshire\u2019s long-term gains\u2026 cannot be dramatic and will not come close to those of the past 50 years. It is harder to double the market value of a $100 billion company than a $1 billion company.\u201d\n\nHe recently told CNBC, \u201cYou should consistently buy an S&P 500 low-cost index fund. I think it\u2019s the thing that makes the most sense practically all of the time.\u201d\n\nIn 2008, Buffett famously bet a hedge fund manager from Protege Partners that a portfolio of hedge funds would not beat the S&P 500 over a 10-year period. He easily won the bet and donated his $1 million prize to Girls, Inc., a non-profit organization in Omaha.\n\nThat\u2019s quite a change from his approach in the early days of trading. In his 1988 annual shareholder report, he criticized the efficient market theory and indexing: \u201cObserving correctly that the market was frequently efficient, they went on to conclude incorrectly that it was always efficient . The difference between these propositions is night and day.\u201d\n\nIndeed, he told the story of his mentor Ben Graham and his arbitrage trading system, which averaged a 20% per year return over a 63-year period.\n\n\u201cOver the 63 years, the general market delivered just under a 10% annual return, including dividends. That means $1,000 would have grown to $405,000 if all income had been reinvested. A 20% rate of return, however, would have produced $97 million!\u201d\n\nBut apparently those days are long gone, due to the law of diminishing returns and the size of BRK.A.\n\nWhat\u2019s Better Than Berkshire Hathaway?\n\nThere are some actively managed funds still exist and outperform the indexes. I recommend one in my Forecasts & Strategies newsletter. Actually, it is the only mutual fund I recommend in my newsletter. Furthermore, it has been beating the market for years and is still open to investors. It is one of my largest holdings.

Alex Green calls it a \u201cclassic.\u201d\n\nCommodity guru Dennis Gartman says, \u201cIt\u2019s amazing the depth of wisdom one can find in just one or two lines from your book.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cMaxims\u201d book is available for only $20 for the first copy, and all additional copies are $10 each. And if you order an entire box of 32 books, you pay only $300. Plus, I pay postage and autograph each copy. It is the perfect gift for investors, clients, money managers and stockbrokers.\n\nTo order, call Harold at Ensign Publishing at 1-866-254-2057, or go to www.skousenbooks.com.\n\nBy the way, if you\u2019re curious about how I\u2019m investing my own money these days, I recently recorded a video that \u201clets the cat out of the bag,\u201d so to speak.
