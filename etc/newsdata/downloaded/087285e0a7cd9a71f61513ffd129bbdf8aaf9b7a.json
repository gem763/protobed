He knew exactly what shots he wanted. He knew exactly how to talk to us into acting natural - everything a phtogprapher should do,' Mr Leathwick said.\n\nBut when they received the photos, Mrs Leathwick was disappointed to see that they had been edited.\n\nShe explained: 'The first thing I noticed was, I looked a lot slimmer. It's pretty obvious - my arms in particular. I said to Andrew, \"I haven't been that skinny since I was 10\".\n\nThe newlyweds were unhappy with the editing because they wanted the wedding photos to reflect how they actually looked on the day\n\nThe bride's arm in an unedited snap of the big day (left). Right: The bride's arm after being Photoshopped to look slimmer\n\nShe said Mr Sheng never discussed image retouching with her, and it was mostly noticeable around her face, arms and on her chest.\n\n'I just looked at it and it looked like my chest had collapsed,' she said.\n\n'I was pretty disappointed because I just wanted to look (in) the photo how I actually looked on the day.'\n\nMr Leathwick added: 'We just thought about it for a while and had a bit of a debate with ourselves and thought \"how happy are we this really\".'\n\nThe couple contacted the photographer and asked if they could have a set of original images, but he said he was too busy and never sent them over.\n\nAccording to Mrs Leathwick, he told the couple: 'I have lots of other clients. I don't really have time for this.'\n\nThe couple were shocked when they received the final edits and found the photographer had Photoshopped some of the images to make them look thinner\n\nTalking to TVNZ's Fair Go , Mrs Leathwick said her wedding was perfect and they were happy to pay the photographer's fee of $4,000 because they loved his work. But when they received the photos, Mrs Leathwick said she looked noticeably slimmer\n\n'I just thought that when we pointed out to him that we didn't want this to begin with, he'd say \"I'm so sorry, I'll get this sorted for you\".\n\nHe has since claimed to have deleted all of the originals, and said that it would take too long to edit the already retouched images.\n\nMr Leathwick said his 'alarm bells went off' when the Mr Sheng said he deleted the raw images.\n\n'We thought, \"oh dear. How is he going to be able to do a good job, like his other work that we've seen?'\",' he said.\n\nAfter months of waiting the married couple have only received two untouched images, and the photographer has stopped communication with them.\n\nDaily Mail Australia has contacted the photographer for comment.", "description": "Irene and Andrew Leathwick got married in November last year and hired Auckland-based photographer Mike Sheng because they admired his 'flair for colour'.", "authors": ["Lauren Ferri For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/08/20024722-0-image-a-8_1571729495623.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
