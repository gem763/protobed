And in that past week, BSV also posted significantly successful days, bouncing off the $90 range and once again to triple-digit prices.\n\nThe earlier BSV rally above $100 happened around the birthday of Craig Wright, one of the most vocal \u2013 and reviled \u2013 Bitcoin SV proponents, and claimants to the personhood of Satoshi Nakamoto. Whether this was a birthday gift for Wright, or a stunt, the rally continued on Thursday and Friday.\n\nThe Bitcoin SV network has added an interesting feature, which surfaced on Friday. There is a 2.5 BSV bounty for uploading worldwide air quality data.\n\nFYI. The totally fee is around 2.5 BSV every 24 hours(~3500 sat per tx), if upload the aqi of all the 3000+ cities. https://t.co/iulsGYbDLV \u2014 Aaron Zhou (@dailyzhou) October 23, 2019\n\nThe inclusion of data in BSV blocks is a new feature, and the bounty may help build up the community.\n\nBSV also rallies in BTC terms, up from 0.010 BTC to 0.013 BTC in a growing trend. The blockchain of BSV, which was the fork-of-a-fork of BTC, is still having claims to being \u201cthe real Bitcoin\u201d. Craig Wright has also threatened to wipe out BTC in just a few months, dumping his vast BTC holdings, while boosting BSV.\n\nCould the current rally be a part of this threat? It is still too early to say. BSV trades on multiple small exchanges, and there is the possibility of trading manipulation. Also, it is quite possible the fast gains will be erased just as fast, as BSV takes its turn to flash-crash.\n\nMoving Up But Why?\n\nBSV already gathered strength for a few days before Thursday\u2019s rally, and the reason for the jump may be inertia taking over.\n\nThe coin burrowed to as low as $81 a few weeks ago, and the current gains are looking rather significant. The Bitcoin SV mining also picked up since mid-October, expanding from 800 quadrillion hashes per second, to 1.3 quintillion hashes \u2013 which is still around 12% of the Bitcoin hashrate, and just half of the Bitcoin Cash hashrate.\n\nBSV remains one of the more successful forked coins, keeping its presence among top 10 assets. The network detached from Bitcoin Cash on November 26 last year, and for that time managed to establish itself, despite a scandal and delistings from Binance and Kraken.\n\nWhat do you think about the BSV pump?
