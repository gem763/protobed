But I'm not and this has been going on for nine months.\n\n\"It's an up-and-down humming noise, it's there in the daytime but not as noticeable. And then at night it's very loud, like a lorry or a refrigerator.\n\n\"I have to come down and sleep on the sofa, which I shouldn't have to do.\n\n\"I've even looked on the internet and it could be underwater pumps, pipes or a transformer. But there isn't a transformer near my house.\n\n\"I've even had to go to the doctors to get sleeping tablets but they only give out a week's supply at a time. And earplugs are very uncomfortable.\n\n(Image: 1+1 TV/east2west news)\n\n\"It's getting to me. If I stopped paying the rent the council would soon come to my house.\n\n\"If I could afford to go private and move I would. But the problem would still be here for the next person. I've just had enough.\n\n\"Even at work I'm snapping. Now everybody is saying I look tired, well you try living with it.\"\n\nSon Andy Bathe no longer lives at his mum's Smallthorne home.\n\nBut the insurance consultant has heard the same noises as his mum.\n\nThe 43-year-old said: \"The last time I came up, it sounded like next door had a hot tub running.\n\n\"It's like a droning noise. You hear it all night. It sounds like it's coming from the wall next door but up in the attic.\"\n\nAndy has his own theory for the source of the noise.\n\nHe added: \"My mum had her gravity water tank removed by the council some time ago and now has a combi-boiler.\n\n\"If they haven't removed the electric side of the hot water system that was up in the attic beforehand and it's kicking in at night to heat up a tank that's not there then it could be that. That's my guess.\"\n\nThe council has visited Pat and spoken to her neighbours.\n\nCouncillor Joanne Powell-Beckett, cabinet member for housing ,said: \u201cWe have been in contact with Mrs Bathe since she first reported noises in her property in February, 2019.\n\n\u201cWe have investigated the property for noise and have not picked anything up ourselves. We have also spoken to neighbours in surrounding properties who have not heard the noise.\n\n\u201cWe treat all issues reported to us by tenants seriously and will continue to work with Mrs Bathe to investigate the problem.\u201d", "description": "Pat Bathe, 65, says the starts at 9.30pm every night and it's 'very loud, like a lorry or a refrigerator'", "authors": ["Joe Burn", "Image", "Kerry Ashdown", "Tv News"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20569387.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/3_IMG-4947JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
