I am not a criminal.'\n\nScroll down for video\n\nFormer NYPD detectives, Eddie Martins (center in black), 39, and Richard Hall (second from right, in gray), 34, have been sentenced to five years probation for after they were accused of raping an 18-year-old woman in a police van\n\nMartins and Hall pleaded guilty in August to two counts of third-degree bribe receiving and nine counts of official misconduct involving Anna Chambers (left with her lawyer in 2018, and right in 2018), now 20\n\nIn September 2017, Hall and Martins were accused of raping Chambers in the back of their police van in Coney Island.\n\nThe two former officers were on duty conducting a 'buy and bust' operation around 7.30pm on September 15, but left their post without authorization.\n\nDriving a Dodge Caravan, Hall and Martins rode to Calvert Vaux Park in Gravesend, Brooklyn, prosecutors said.\n\nAround 8pm, the officers stopped an Infinity Coupe driven by Chambers and two male passengers.\n\nThey found marijuana inside the front seat cup holder and instructed the three suspects to step out of the car.\n\nChambers admitted she had marijuana and two Klonopin pills when officers asked if they had any drugs on them.\n\nEvidence from the incident showed that the officers arrested Chambers and let her two male companions go.\n\nA press release from the Brooklyn District Attorney's Office states that after leaving the park, 'the woman had sexual intercourse with Martins and performed a sex act on Hall'.\n\nThe officers then drove Chambers to the 60th precinct in Coney Island, released the woman and returned her Klonopin pills.\n\nHall and Martins had no authority to 'rescind' the arrest or release the woman, according to the press release.\n\nHall (right, on Thursday) and Martins (left on Thursday) were initially accused of raping Chambers, but they did not face sexual assault charges because the charges 'couldn't be proven beyond a reasonable doubt'\n\nProsecutors said 'the woman had sexual intercourse with Martins and performed a sex act on Hall'. The officers then drove Chambers (pictured in 2018) to the 60th precinct in Coney Island, released the woman and returned her Klonopin pills\n\nAfter the incident, Chambers went to Maimonides Medical Center and received a sexual assault exam that contained DNA matches to both officers\n\nChambers posted her thoughts about the verdict on Twitter (above) in August\n\nNeither officer, who were assigned to NYPD's Brooklyn South Narcotics, reported the incident to a supervisor.\n\nVideo surveillance later showed Chambers exiting the police van around 8.42pm.\n\nAccording to CNN, that same night, Chambers went to Maimonides Medical Center and underwent a sexual assault exam that found traces of the officer's DNA.\n\nShe then pressed charges against Hall and Martins.\n\nHall and Martin were arraigned in November 2017 on 50 charges, including first-degree rape, first-degree criminal sexual act and second-degree kidnapping.\n\nBut the DA's office admitted that the charges were dropped after the accuser 'made a series of false, misleading and inconsistent statements about the facts'.\n\nSupreme Court Justice Danny Chun said in court in 2017: 'The credibility of the victim, or the complainant, in this case was seriously, seriously questionable.'\n\nBecause of this case, New York passed a law prohibiting police officers from having sex with people in their custody. The previous loophole allowed officers to engage in sex if it was consensual.\n\n'We could not apply the new law retroactively, and serious credibility issues in this case precluded us from proceeding on additional charges, yet we remained committed to holding these defendants accountable,' the press release says.\n\nThe woman is now pursuing a federal lawsuit against the city.\n\nFollowing the sentencing Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez said: 'These defendants lost their jobs and are now convicted felons because of the appalling abuse of power to which they admitted.\n\n'This incident led to a change in New York law, closing a loophole that allowed officers to claim that sex with a detainee was consensual. Unfortunately, we could not apply that new law retroactively. While my Office recommended prison time, we accept the Court's sentence.'", "description": "Former NYPD detectives, Eddie Martins (left) and Richard Hall (right), were sentenced on Thursday to five years probation for having sex with Anna Chambers (inset), in a police van after her arrest.", "authors": ["Valerie Edwards For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/18/19549800-0-image-a-4_1570729196962.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
