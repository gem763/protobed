(AP) - Development officials have boosted a loan for removing asbestos from a ruined Gary, Indiana, church that officials hope to turn into a tourist attraction.\n\nThe Northwest Indiana Regional Development Authority originally approved a $64,000 loan for asbestos abatement at the dilapidated City Methodist Church.\n\nBut The (Northwest Indiana) Times reports the development authority increased the loan to $100,000 on Thursday to help drain rainwater that accumulated in the ruins this spring and help with asbestos removal.\n\nThe Gothic-style church built in the 1920s closed in 1975 after years of declining membership.\n\nGary officials aim to transform it into a European-style ruins garden and tourist attraction. They say the City Church Ruins Garden will become one of the nation\u2019s largest such gardens, will boost tourism and provide a public green space.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Times, http://www.nwitimes.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Development officials have boosted a loan for removing asbestos from a ruined Gary, Indiana, church that officials hope to turn into a tourist attraction.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
