REUTERS/Ciro de Luca/File Photo\n\nIn an online ballot, 79.3% of 5-Star supporters voted in favour of joining forces with the PD, their long-time political adversaries, while 20.7% opposed the alliance, party leader Luigi Di Maio told reporters.\n\nThe vote means Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte can now complete work on the new administration and present President Sergio Mattarella with a list of suggested ministers. He is likely to go to the president\u2019s palace to update him on his progress on Wednesday, a political source said.\n\n\u201cI am very proud of today\u2019s vote and very proud of the government that is to come,\u201d Di Maio told reporters after the roughly 80,000 ballots were counted, easily beating 5-Star\u2019s previous record for its frequent online ballots.\n\n\u201cThis government will be neither on the left or on the right,\u201d he added. \u201cIt will be a government that does the things that need doing.\u201d\n\nThe PD\u2019s decision to go into coalition with 5-Star did not require a vote by its rank and file.\n\nOnce Mattarella has agreed to Conte\u2019s cabinet, the prime minister will have to win confidence votes in both houses of parliament before the government can officially start work.\n\nThe key post of economy minister may go to Dario Scannapieco, a former Treasury official who is vice president of the European Investment Bank, or the PD\u2019s Roberto Gualtieri, now head of the European Parliament\u2019s economic affairs commission, 5-Star and PD sources said.\n\nAnother name being considered for the job is former Bank of Italy Deputy Governor Salvatore Rossi, the sources said.\n\nDi Maio, who served as deputy prime minister, industry minister and labour minister in the previous administration of 5-Star and the hard-right League, may become foreign minister in the new government, the sources said.\n\nAs 5-Star\u2019s online ballot got under way early in the day, 5-Star and PD unveiled a shared, 26-point policy programme for their mooted coalition, putting an expansionary 2020 budget at the top of their agenda.\n\n5-Star, created a decade ago out of opposition to the PD, agreed to form a new administration with its former rival to head off a snap election after its coalition with the League collapsed last month.\n\nItalian benchmark 10-year bond yields hit record lows on Tuesday in a sign that investors believed the new administration would take office, heading off the risk of an early election and prolonged political instability.\n\n\u201cThe results (of the 5-Star ballot) are quite strong,\u201d said Chris Scicluna, head of economic research at Daiwa Capital Markets in London. \u201cThis is the kind of result that is going to give investors confidence in the new coalition, at least for the next few months, and in its ability to deliver a budget that is likely to be challenging.\u201d\n\nBUDGET FLEXIBILITY\n\nThe 5-Star and PD said they would use the coming budget to help the stalled economy grow, but also promised that they would not endanger public finances.\n\nItaly has the second-largest debt burden in the European Union as a proportion of economic output, and the coalition pact called for greater flexibility from Brussels to overcome the \u201cexcessive rigidity\u201d of existing budget rules.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte speaks to the media at the Quirinale Presidential Palace after meeting with Italian President Sergio Mattarella in Rome, Italy, August 29, 2019.

The programme also called for a web tax on multinationals and the creation of a public bank to help boost development in the poorer south.\n\n5-Star and PD committed to rewriting Italy\u2019s conflict of interest laws, a move that former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi always sought to head off, fearing it could impact negatively on his Mediaset (MS.MI) media empire.\n\nThe two parties also promised a \u201crevision\u201d of Italy\u2019s motorway concessions. The vague wording left open the hope for Italy\u2019s Atlantia (ATL.MI) that 5-Star would not press ahead with its demand that it lose its lucrative toll road concession in the wake of last year\u2019s deadly bridge collapse in Genoa.", "description": "Members of Italy's anti-establishment 5-Star Movement overwhelmingly backed a proposed coalition with the centre-left Democratic Party (PD) on Tuesday, opening the way for a new government to take office in the coming days.", "authors": ["Crispian Balmer", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190903&t=2&i=1425717058&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF820RI"}
