It would take care of some of the other things. It will also take care of a lot of the banking needs.\u201d\n\nThe comments come ahead of Trump\u2019s meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Chile on Nov. 16-17.\n\n\u201cSo we're about, I would say, a little bit ahead of schedule, maybe a lot ahead of schedule,\u201d the president said. \u201cProbably, we'll sign it.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer spoke with China\u2019s Vice Premier Liu He about the deal and signaled progress on negotiations over the weekend.\n\nThe Office of the U.S. Trade Representative released a statement following the call, noting that both parties \u201cmade headway on specific issues.\u201d\n\nIt was announced earlier this month that Beijing would buy $40 billion to $50 billion of U.S. agricultural products, in exchange for a stop on the United States' scheduled Oct. 15 tariff increase. Officials, however, have left open the potential for a tariff increase Dec. 15.", "description": "\u201cWe are looking probably to be ahead of schedule to sign a very big portion of the China deal, and we\u2019ll call it Phase One but it\u2019s a very big portion,\u201d Trump said.
