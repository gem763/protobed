International declined 0.7% to $62.63.\n\nThe fall in oil prices came after U.S. President Donald Trump struck a combative tone against China in his address to the U.N. assembly in New York.\n\n\u201cNot only has China declined to adopt promised reforms, it has embraced an economic model dependent on massive market barriers, heavy state subsidies, currency manipulation, product dumping technology transfers and the theft of intellectual property and also trade secrets on a grand scale,\u201d the president said.\n\nThe president also said he would not accept a \"bad deal\" in U.S.-China trade negotiations.\n\nHis comments came as the two sides prepared for planned trade negotiations in October.\n\nChina is the world's largest oil importer and second-largest crude user while the U.S. is the largest consumer.\n\nAlso weighing on oil prices today were reports that Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said he was willing \u201cto discuss small changes, additions or amendments to (the) nuclear deal if sanctions were taken away.\u201d\n\nRouhani was referring to the 2016 nuclear pact that Tehran had agreed with the U.S. and other foreign powers. Trump tore up that agreement last year, calling the initiative by his predecessor Barack Obama, \u201cthe worst deal ever\u201d and reimposed sanctions on Tehran.\n\nTrump, who later addressed the assembly, said \u201cno responsible government should subsidize Iran\u2019s bloodlust\u201d, referring to the constant \u201cDeath To America\u201d chants by the Islamic Republic.\n\n\u201cAs long as Iran\u2019s menacing behavior continues, sanctions will not be lifted,\u201d said the president, who reinstated a U.S. oil embargo on Iran last November after pulling out of the 2016 nuclear pact earlier in the year. \u201cThey will be tightened.\u201d", "description": "Oil Prices Fall as Trade Talk Optimism Diminish", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEE4G1TT_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
