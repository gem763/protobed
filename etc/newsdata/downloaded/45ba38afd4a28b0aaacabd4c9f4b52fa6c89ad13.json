Do you really think that\u2019s necessary?\u201d\n\nRita and Liam\u2019s chemistry has been a bone of contention for Cheryl, who was forced to confronted the former One Direction star about their behaviour following the steamy TV appearance last year.\n\n(Image: GC Images)\n\nA friend said: \u201cCheryl was sitting at home alone with an 11-month-old baby asleep upstairs, watching her boyfriend on Jimmy Fallon\u2019s show.\n\n\u201cShe saw him and Rita all over each other, and Rita looking like she was going in for a kiss. Obviously it was very upsetting.\n\n\u201cShe immediately texted Rita, asking her what the hell was going on. She said she thought it was inappropriate and basically asked her to back off.\u201d\n\nThe source added that Rita was \u201cmortified\u201d and replied nothing was going on, clarifying that \u201cshe would never, ever go there in a million years.\u201d\n\nIn order to placate Cheryl, it is claimed that Rita and Liam agreed to tone down their on-stage flirting.\n\nHowever, fans immediately caught on to a change in atmosphere when the pair performed together at the Brit Awards three weeks later and didn\u2019t have any physical contact.\n\nCheryl and Liam broke up five months later but insist the end of their two-year relationship had nothing to do with Rita.\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
