You have to take him out. And nobody ever listened to me. ... Let\u2019s put it this way: If they had listened to me, a lot of things would have been different,\u201d Trump said as he announced that ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi had died in a U.S.-led raid in Syria, The Guardian reported.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t get any credit. I never do,\u201d he continued, referencing his book \u201cThe America We Deserve,\u201d which was published in 2000.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTrump in a tweet last year also claimed that his book foreshadowed bin Laden\u2019s rise ahead of 9/11, saying, \u201cOf course we should have captured Osama Bin Laden long before we did. I pointed him out in my book just BEFORE the attack on the World Trade Center. President Clinton famously missed his shot. We paid Pakistan Billions of Dollars & they never told us he was living there. Fools!\u201d\n\nOf course we should have captured Osama Bin Laden long before we did. I pointed him out in my book just BEFORE the attack on the World Trade Center. President Clinton famously missed his shot. We paid Pakistan Billions of Dollars & they never told us he was living there. Fools!.. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 19, 2018\n\nBut many have pushed back on his characterization of the book.\n\nAn Associated Press fact check last year pointed out that the book was published more than a year and a half before the 9/11 attacks, not \u201cjust before.\u201d\n\nThe AP also noted that the book made a minimal reference to bin Laden and mentioned the al Qaeda leader as one of many threats to U.S. security.\n\nTrump\u2019s book also did not call for further U.S. action against bin Laden or al Qaeda following attacks that former President Clinton ordered in 1998 in Afghanistan and Sudan targeting the terrorist group, according to the news service. The 1998 attacks \u201cmissed\u201d in that they did not kill bin Laden, but they did disrupt bin Laden\u2019s network and destroy a factory in Sudan associated with the creation of a nerve gas ingredient, it added.\n\nDuring the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump also claimed that he said, \u201cYou better take him out\u201d about bin Laden in the book. He also said he \u201cpredicted Osama bin Laden\u201d when \u201cnobody really knew who he was.\u201d\n\nThe CIA and other national security operations were aware of bin Laden before the attacks on 9/11, according to the AP.\n\nTrump did predict a terrorist attack that would make the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center pale in comparison, the AP reported. However, that was a widespread concern at the time among officials, according to the news service.", "description": "President Trump\u00a0on Sunday again claimed he wrote a book prior to the terror attacks on 9/11 warning about the dangers of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/trump3_102719getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
