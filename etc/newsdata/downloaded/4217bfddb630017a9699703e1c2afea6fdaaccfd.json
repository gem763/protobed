It had rallied on Tuesday following Britain's Supreme Court ruling that Prime Minister Boris Johnson's suspension of parliament was \"unlawful\", providing a spark of hope that Brexit will be more orderly than previously feared.\n\n\"The ensuing British Pound rally was a bit underwhelming. It probably reflected the uncertainty of both Mr Johnson's tenure and the Brexit process with October the 31st looming,\" said Oanda's Halley.\n\nAFP", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Stocks - [HONG KONG] Asian stock markets fell on Wednesday after US Democrats launched formal impeachment proceedings against Donald Trump and on renewed worries about trade as the president adopted a hard line on China. .
