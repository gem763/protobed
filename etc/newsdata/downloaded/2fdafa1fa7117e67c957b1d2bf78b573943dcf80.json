'Like, ''Oh, my girl needs to be like the other girls, showing her body off''.'\n\n'I didn't realize that that was affecting my soul and my spirit as someone that's married and loved, and the father of now, what\u2014about to be four kids?,' Kanye said.\n\nRecent transition: Kanye told his wife that he recently made a transition from rapper\n\nHe and Kim were just days away from becoming parents to their fourth child, son Psalm, by a surrogate, but the fashion event was so important to Kim that she risked missing the birth.\n\n'A corset is like a form of underwear,' Kanye continued. 'It's hot. It's like, it's hot for who, though?'\n\n'So the night before the Met, you're gonna come in here and say that you're not into a corset bust?' Kim asked. 'I'm getting really bad anxiety. What are you talking about?'\n\nBad anxiety: Kim pointed out that Kanye was bringing this up the night before the Met Gala and she was getting 'really bad anxiety'\n\n'I don't need any more negative energy for you to now say that you're not into me in a tight dress,' she pointed out.\n\n'You are my wife, and it affects me when pictures are too sexy,' Kanye said.\n\n'You built me up to be this sexy person and confidence and all this stuff,' Kim adroitly pointed out. 'And just because you're on a journey and you're on a transformation doesn't mean that I'm in the same spot with you.'\n\nNegative energy: The reality star told the rapper that she didn't need any more of his 'negative energy'\n\nToo much: Kim was shocked as Kanye was critical of her taking sexy pictures\n\nDifferent journey: The aspiring lawyer told Kanye that his journey didn't mean she was on the same spot with him\n\n'All right, cool,' Kanye said, leaving.\n\n'That's absolutely ridiculous,' Kim muttered.\n\nOver the course of one week, Kim made time for the Met Ball, two dress fittings, two shoots for her cosmetics line KKW Beauty, law-school prep, a baby shower, and a music video appearance with Paris Hilton.\n\nGood point: Kanye accepted Kim's point and walked off\n\nAll cool: The rapper before leaving the room said, 'All right, cool'\n\nAbsolutely ridiculous: Kim muttered after Kanye left that his position was 'absolutely ridiculous'\n\nAs the episode opened, she discussed Met Ball outfits with her mom, Kris Jenner, 63, and sister Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian, 35.\n\nKris described her pointy shouldered look as 'Elton John-meets-Liberace-meets-Andy Warhol-meets-Studio 54.'\n\nHer girls urged her to change out her gaudy handbag, with Kim saying, 'Honestly, if I sent this to Kanye, I think he might have a heart attack.'\n\nFamily affair: Kris Jenner described her pointy shouldered look for the Met Gala as 'Elton John-meets-Liberace-meets-Andy Warhol-meets-Studio 54'\n\n'Don't send it to Kanye,' her mother intoned.\n\n'Thank God we saw these photos, mom,' Khlo\u00e9 opined.\n\n'We literally just saved your life,' Kim added.\n\nHer own fitting, later that day, felt special: Her late father, Robert Kardashian, used to buy her Thierry Mugler's fragrance, which made her feel connected to the designer.\n\nSpecial meaning: Kim at her fitting said it had special meaning because her late father, Robert Kardashian, used to buy her Thierry Mugler's fragrance, which made her feel connected to the designer\n\n'Being able to sit with him is such a full circle dream come true,' she observed, as a photo of her consulting with Mugler was shown.\n\n'I had a corset made by Mr. Pearl, the legendary corset maker, because I wanted to completely accentuate my body to make it as campy as possible,' Kim noted, marveling at her tiny waist.\n\n'It doesn't hurt,' she said of the narrowing garment, 'but it feels like you're doing a crunch and you can't get out of it. And then you literally can't breathe.'\n\nNarrow garment: The reality star said it was hard to breathe in the tight outfit\n\nIt took 20 minutes to get on with an assistant literally lifting Kim's butt cheek into the dress.\n\nAfterward, she met with her surrogate at the obstetrician's office, where she heard the baby's heartbeat and fretted that it might be born while she was away.\n\n'Khlo\u00e9's hoping that this happens while I'm gone, 'cause she just wants the baby,' she told the woman. 'She's like ''I'm so excited!'' I'm like, ''No, no, no, this can't happen''.'\n\nHelping hand: An assistant helped Kim fit into the dress\n\nDoctor visit: Kim met with her surrogate at the obstetrician's office, where she heard the baby's heartbeat and fretted that it might be born while she was away\n\nComing soon: The delivery was just days away and Kim hoped to go to the Met Gala and be back in time to welcome the arrival of her fourth child via surrogate\n\n'It has taken eight months to get our Met look perfected, and I've committed to this, so I can't miss it,' Kim added in a confessional. 'I just hope she doesn't have the baby early.'\n\nWith that done, she hosted her own 'Zen and calming' baby shower at home, attended by pals like Paris, Chrissy Teigen, model Winnie Harlow, and the singer Sia.\n\nHer guests wrote down their proposed baby names, like Ziggy, Wyld, Boogie and Sugar.\n\nFamous guests: Sia was among the famous guests at the baby shower\n\nKim said she'd had the baby shower as way to concretely introduce the idea of Psalm to her other three children, who wouldn't see a baby growing in her belly.\n\n'Red Rover, Red Rover, send the new baby over,' Kim yelled out as she and her friends ran toward a photographer's camera holding hands.\n\nKim then gathered everyone at the sound bath station she'd set up in her yard, where performers would bang gongs and bowls until they reverberated, making a calming noise.\n\nName game: Guests played the Name Game at the baby shower\n\nBefore the guests lay down, she admitted she was 'freaking the f*** out having a fourth kid.'\n\n'You said the 'f' word!' a child cried in the distance, as everyone laughed.\n\n'I thought what better way to celebrate than to have a little CBD,' Kim continued. 'We're gonna do a sound bath. I thought it would just be cool for us to Zen out on a Saturday.'\n\nFreaking out: Kim at her baby shower admitted she was freaking out about having a fourth child\n\n'What the hell is happening over in this freaking\u2026 oh!' Khlo\u00e9 said, stumbling on the scene, wine glass in one hand and her one-year-old baby True in the other.\n\nDozens of women lay on the ground, listening to organizers urge them to 'shift your focus over to your breath,' while talking about the soul, cosmos and other dimensions.\n\n'This is some cult s***, I'm not kidding,' Khlo\u00e9 told her sister Kylie Jenner, 22. 'You know, this is scaring me.'\n\nGood times: Kylie Jenner and Paris Hilton also were spotted at the baby shower\n\nHands full: Khloe held her daughter True in one hand and a glass of wine as she poked fun of KIm's event\n\nAfter the shower, Kim's pal Paris, 38, asked her to be in the music video for her new song, 'Best Friend's A**,' to be shot within the next few days.\n\nKim despite being busy agreed, saying: 'It'll be such a fun tribute to the good old days.'\n\nThe reality star explained that she'd never traveled the world until she met Paris, but that they 'went on so many trips together, from Germany to Australia to Ibiza.'\n\nLongtime friends: Paris asked her longtime friend Kim to appear in her music video\n\n'I learned a lot from her, and I'm glad that I had that as an example,' Kim explained.\n\nKanye listened to the song and pronounced it 'fire.'\n\n'I really would want to do anything for her,' Kim told Khlo\u00e9. 'She literally gave me a career.'\n\nCareer start: Khloe listened as Kim gave Paris credit for her career\n\nAt the shoot, Paris was overjoyed to see Kim, calling her 'the ultimate' and noting that 'the song was inspired by you and your little f***ing a**.'\n\nParis then complained that her spray tan had turned her hairline orange.\n\n'Do you know that I never even knew what a spray tan was until I met you?' Kim asked.\n\nTogether again: Kim and Paris hugged when they saw each other\n\nVideo star: Paris complained that her spray tan had turned her hairline orange\n\n'Hanging out with Paris is like literally stepping into 2007,' she said privately. 'She looks exactly the same.'\n\nWith five days to go, she flew to New York for the Met Ball, where the theme was Camp: Notes on Fashion, and attended her last fitting.\n\nBefore she did, she eyeballed her new Vogue cover, on which her dress was wet, 'like a mermaid', which is how she said her daughter North, six, saw her.\n\nCover girl: Kim was on the cover of US Vogue marking a longtime gail\n\nKim had wanted a solo US Vogue cover for years, and once thought it unattainable, but Kanye 'always believed in it.'\n\nHer dress took 500 hours to bead and create, and every piece poked her inside 'like a cactus,' she told pal Jonathan Cheban, 45, who was there with her.\n\nIt was so tight that in an emergency, she'd just have to urinate and let her sister wipe her leg, she said.\n\nShowing support: Jonathan Cheban was with Kim at her fitting\n\nKim marveled at how things had changed since the first time she attended with Kanye.\n\n'I was wearing a floral glove, and they just cropped me out. That's how badly they didn't want me there,' she recalled. 'And now I'm the cover girl coming on the camp cover.'\n\nShe wanted to get it right for Mugler, a perfectionist, and Kanye's words at the fitting unsettled her.\n\nCropped out: Kim recalled how she did not feel welcomed at her first Met Gala with Kanye\n\nThe next day, tightened into her corset, she felt her nerves rising and thought she had to pee again, until an assistant told her it was all in her head, and everyone said a prayer.\n\nShe told a reporter she was getting donuts delivered the next morning, 'hot and fresh.'\n\nHer sisters, Kylie and Kendall Jenner, 23, wore Versace in a collaboration with designer Donatella Versace, and they goofed around, with Kendall trying on Kylie's wig.\n\nCampy theme: Kendall and Kylie Jenner wore Versace at the Met Gala\n\nMomager Kris had fun, too, riding to the event with boyfriend Corey Gamble, 38, designer Tommy Hilfiger, 68, and his wife Dee, 52.\n\n'Camp is really about dressing like I used to dress back in the '80s, so for me, it's kind of easy,' Kris admitted.\n\nThe crowd went crazy for Kim's look, but the evening took a toll on her body.\n\n'I think I'm bleeding on the inside, for real,' she said after the ball. 'I feel like I'm gonna die.'\n\nTough dress: Kim said she felt like was bleeding on the inside wearing the dress\n\nShe changed into a second look at her hotel, and revealed that she was also helping a recently released prisoner get his tattoos removed by her doctor that week.\n\nThen she thought again about the baby, asking for her nails to be shortened in a manicure so she could wipe her new baby's bottom.\n\nWhen it was all over, and they flew home, Kanye said: 'I had an idea, a vision about the backyard: Sheep.'\n\n'Hello, no,' Kim said.\n\nShe and the surrogate again visited the doctor, and learned that the baby was still breech, raising the possibility of a painful aversion, or manual turning, which Kim had with Saint, three.\n\nStill breech: Kim and the surrogate again visited the doctor, and learned that the baby was still breech\n\nKim caught up with Khlo\u00e9 and her sister Kourtney's ex, Scott Disick, 36, after she returned.\n\n'I like what Kanye said' about the Met Ball, Khlo\u00e9 shared. 'He said, ''It was about my wife, and I wanted her to shine, and I was just there to be her protector and her plus-one''.'\n\nKim's doctor called while they chatted, saying they'd have to do an aversion on the surrogate and put her into labor right away so the baby didn't turn again.\n\nDoctor call: Dr. Paul Crane called Kim and said they were going to do an aversion and then induce labor\n\n'The baby's coming tomorrow,' Kim sighed. 'Ready or not, here we come.'\n\nPsalm West would be born May 9 at 7:02 p.m., though the birth was not yet shown.\n\nWhile Kim was going through her Met Ball drama, Kourtney Kardashian, 40, discovered someone in her house was stealing from her.\n\nHer iPad had recently gone missing, too, which set off alarm bells in her head.\n\n'I have people in and out of my house all day, people that I trust,' Kourtney said. 'Something just isn't right.'\n\nTrust broken: Kourtney Kardashian meanwhile was dealing with a woman stealing from her\n\nIt turned out that an unnamed woman had pilfered $700 from her wallet, and $4,500 from Scott's wallet, and she'd twice been spotted by security with a flashlight in Kourtney's office.\n\nThe woman was downstairs when she got the news, and Khlo\u00e9 suggested they 'go f*** her up.'\n\n'She also hacked everything,' Kourtney revealed, and read her a text she'd been sent, which said: 'She's looking at your texts right now.'\n\n'Stand your ground,' Khlo\u00e9 implored. 'This is your home with your kids!'\n\nKourtney went to confront the woman, but she sped away in her car.\n\nStanding ground: Khloe urged Kourtney to stand her ground and confront the woman\n\n'What did I tell you about people not f***ing with us anymore?' Khlo\u00e9 asked her. 'Now, how many people have stolen? We're done.'\n\nHer sister immediately ordered her staff to change her iTunes password, 'debug' the house, and unconnect every home device from her phone.\n\n'And next time, we've learned a huge lesson,' Kourtney said. 'They cannot step foot in here for an interview without us having their social, name and address.'\n\nShe, Kris and Khlo\u00e9 then saged the house 'to get her bad vibes out.'\n\nKeeping Up With The Kardashians will return next week on the E! network.", "description": "Kanye West's concerns about wife Kim Kardashian's sexy dress nearly upended her Met Ball appearance, she revealed on Sunday's episode of KUWTK.", "authors": ["Dailymail.Com Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/06/19678676-0-image-a-117_1571032091156.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
