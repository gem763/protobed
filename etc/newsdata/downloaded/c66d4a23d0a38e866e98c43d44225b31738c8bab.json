The final of the last BBC series got more than 14 million viewers. Nadiya\u2019s 2015 win: peak of 14.5 million. https://t.co/tP3Pyxr77j \u2014 Scott Bryan (@scottygb) October 30, 2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nViewing figures have even fallen since the baking show\u2019s debut on Channel 4 \u2013 its first run on the channel logged 7.3 million viewers for its final, whilst last night\u2019s bagged 6.9 million. Those numbers are still a world away from the giddy heights of 2015, where a massive 14.5 million viewers tuned in.\n\nNew research from Vanquis has also uncovered that the number of tweets generated by each episode of Bake Off has actually gone down this year.\n\nAn analysis of some 8.2 million tweets found that series nine of the show on average saw 65,830 tweets per episode, whilst this years run has seen that number tumble to 50,804.\n\nThe apparent fall in viewers and social engagement, however, didn\u2019t stop fans kicking off because of last night\u2019s finale results. David\u2019s victory came as something of a surprise given that he had never won Star Baker.\n\nRunner-up Steph Blackwell had previously won Star Baker for a record number of consecutive weeks, so her victory seemed almost assured.\n\nThere was a backlash against his win, and David has finally broken his silence after fans accused Steph of being \u2018robbed.\u2019\n\nThe Great British Bake Off will return in 2020.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
