But Wilson shrugged off the suggestion it is time to lower the expectations placed on Townsend\u2019s men. \u201cThere is only one thing you can do now, we move on to three games that are must-win games now,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we had won last night we would probably be saying we need to win the next three games.\n\n\u201cWe now have to make sure we improve the performance against Samoa, and against the other two opposition, to give ourselves the opportunity to qualify. They become games now that we have to win, it is as simple as that.\n\n\u201cWe certainly have a consistency issue, I think that would be fair to say. We as a coaching team need to find a way of consistently producing the kind of quality rugby we need to produce to win games, and if we\u2019re being brutally honest about it we\u2019ve got to eradicate some of the errors we make and the pressure we heap on ourselves.\u201d\n\nAfter the other game in Group A Russia\u2019s winger Kirill Golosnitskiy was pleasantly surprised when he received a katana Japanese sword from Japan captain Michael Leitch after scoring the first try of the tournament.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a plastic one, so there shouldn\u2019t be any issue if I decide to take it home to Russia with me,\u201d Golosnitskiy said.\n\nThe try on Friday night came in the fifth minute, making it the fastest in the opening game of any Rugby World Cup. Japan rallied to win 30-10.\n\n\u201cI was glad to make a try against the Japanese,\u201d Golosnitskiy said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t consider it to be an achievement as everything was done by (Russia captain) Vasily Artemyev for me.\u201d\n\nRussia\u2019s next game is against Samoa on Tuesday.\n\nTwo sons of Uruguayan rugby great Diego Ormaechea have been included on the bench for the team\u2019s World Cup opener against Fiji.\n\nThe scrum-half Agust\u00edn Ormaechea and back-rower Juan Diego Ormaechea are part of coach Esteban Meneses\u2019 23-man squad for Wednesday\u2019s Pool D game at Kamaishi Recovery Memorial Stadium.\n\nDiego scored a try in Uruguay\u2019s win over Spain in 1999 and was the oldest player, at 40, to compete in the Rugby World Cup.\n\nAgust\u00edn Ormaechea, who started all four of Uruguay\u2019s games in the 2015 World Cup, was replaced in one of three changes to the starting lineup that lost to Spain in a warm-up game in July. Diego Arbelo, Santiago Arata and Felipe Berchesi were promoted to start ahead of Ormaechea, Juan Pedro Rombys and Leandro Leivas. Fiji, meanwhile, have made 12 changes to the starting XV from their opening defeat to Australia.\n\nThe South Africa prop Trevor Nyakane is another unlucky player to be ruled out of the Rugby World Cup after tearing his right calf muscle in the 23-13 loss to New Zealand.\n\nThe Springboks have drafted in Thomas du Toit as a replacement and he is flying to Japan from France, where he was on a short-term loan with Toulouse.\n\nSouth Africa say Du Toit will arrive at the team camp in Nagoya on Tuesday ahead of the Pool B game against Namibia on Saturday.\n\nRugby fans allowed own food in World Cup venues after shortages Read more\n\nNyakane will be a big loss for South Africa after giving the Boks strong momentum in the scrum off the bench in recent matches. Vincent Koch will likely move up to the bench as cover for starting tighthead Frans Malherbe.\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s coach, Rassie Erasmus, said: \u201cIt\u2019s very tough on Trevor. He has had a great season and added value whenever he took the field. It\u2019s a blow to him and the team, but it\u2019s also an opportunity for Thomas and for Vincent.\u201d", "description": "Gregor Townsend\u2019s Scotland have suffered a nightmare start to the World Cup as Hamish Watson has been ruled out of the tournament while there are also concerns over Ali Price", "authors": ["Pa Media"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/583bd80f68813a84ce2bf8ebfb21354d3d8cb2af/0_76_3504_2102/master/3504.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e920d7e9d2ee4e6b7af0de908cd05745", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
