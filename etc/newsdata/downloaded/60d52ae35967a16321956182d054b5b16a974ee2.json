They have picked up only 18 points since the Norwegian was appointed on a permanent basis in March.\n\nVAR\u2019S INTERVENTION ON PENALTIES UNDER SCRUTINY\n\nWinless Watford were left fuming after key decisions referred to VAR (Video Assistant Referee) went against them in a 1-1 draw at Tottenham Hotspur.\n\nGerard Deulofeu was felled by Jan Vertonghen in the box and VAR ruled in Spurs\u2019 favour while Harry Kane appeared to push defender Christian Kabasele in the build-up to Dele Alli\u2019s late equaliser.\n\n\u201cI was thinking VAR is something objective but I\u2019m starting to think it\u2019s very subjective,\u201d Watford coach Quique Sanchez Flores said.\n\nThe elite referees body (PGMOL) said last month that there were four errors made by VAR this season and the notion is that the system is not correcting the referee\u2019s original decision.\n\nIt has begged the question why the referee does not look at a pitchside monitor himself as they do in other European leagues.\n\nNO CENTRE BACKS, NO PROBLEM FOR GUARDIOLA\n\nPep Guardiola has never been short of options in a Manchester City squad rich with talent but an injury crisis forced him to play without a recognised centre back at Crystal Palace.\n\nGuardiola has done it before at Bayern Munich and, with Nicolas Otamendi injured and John Stones still not fully fit, the Spanish boss deployed midfielders Fernandinho and Rodri in central defence.\n\nCity never looked threatened and Guardiola was delighted to see the duo come out unscathed in a 2-0 win, with their presence in the back four helping speed up their build-up play.\n\nEVERTON WIN EASES PRESSURE OFF SILVA\n\nEverton moved away from the relegation zone and up to 14th with a convincing 2-0 win over West Ham United and manager Marco Silva heaved a sigh a of relief after a four-game losing streak was finally put to bed.\n\nBooed after their last defeat, Silva made five changes to his starting lineup and the return of Andre Gomes in midfield certainly lifted the Merseyside club.\n\nBernard and Theo Walcott were lively on the flanks while Alex Iwobi also excelled in a playmaker role. They also kept their first clean sheet since August.\n\nLAMPARD\u2019S CHELSEA IN TOP FOUR\n\nChelsea\u2019s 1-0 win over Newcastle United was their fourth in five league games and it lifted the London side temporarily up to fourth.\n\nFrank Lampard looks well and truly settled at the helm in a club where the squad has quickly lost faith in young managers in the past, with senior players giving the 41-year-old their backing.\n\n\u201cThe team is getting better, we are improving game by game,\u201d goal scorer Marcos Alonso said. \u201cWe\u2019re doing a good job and we have clear ideas about what we want to do.\u201d", "description": "Five talking points from the Premier League weekend:", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191021&t=2&i=1443330508&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9K0U1", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
