Across the overall market at all price points, transactions fell 15.2% in the same period.\n\nAt the same time, inventory soared at both the high end and in the overall market, up 143.4% and 76.9%, respectively.\n\n\u201cRight now in the Hamptons, it's all about pricing\u2014at every level,\u201d Todd Bourgard, Douglas Elliman\u2019s senior executive regional manager of sales for the Hamptons, said in the report.\n\nFrom Penta: Worldwise: \u2018Unlikely Florist\u2019 Spencer Falls\u2019 Favorite Things\n\n\u201cSmart sellers are starting to understand that if they price a property properly, it will sell faster. As a result, we are extremely busy right now, and seeing a dramatic leap in multiple buyers on a single property, presenting full price offers or even above. Concurrently, both buyers and sellers are getting results at a fair market value,\u201d Mr. Bourgard said.\n\nSellers\u2019 willingness to negotiate\u2014reflected in an increased discount of 12.3%, up from 10.5% at the same time last year\u2014along with the sharp drop in mortgage rates has helped offset the negative effect of the SALT tax, and push up overall median prices, according to the report.\n\nWhile the median sales price rose 5.5% to $857,000 on the luxury side, prices dropped 11.1% to $6 million.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Mansion Global .", "description": "Last year\u2019s tax changes have impacted the pricey New York enclave", "authors": ["Liz Lucking"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-120689/social", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
