I\u2019m not sure what to believe in anymore \u2014 because the photographic evidence direct from Apple\u2019s fearless leader has clearly been Photoshopped!\n\nAbove, see Tim Cook\u2019s Twitter profile picture before \u2014 and after \u2014 today\u2019s AirPods Pro reveal. Below, find the before / after from back in March when Apple launched the AirPods 2:\n\nI can only draw two possible conclusions here: either someone had to photoshop an AirPod into Tim\u2019s ear for the second picture, or someone had to photoshop an AirPod out of Tim\u2019s ear for the first onehttps://t.co/48vEWiyMelhttps://t.co/D0tjCH5CqM pic.twitter.com/VCJZJhNSrc \u2014 Chaim Gartenberg (@cgartenberg) March 20, 2019\n\nAnd in a totally off-the-cuff, way-too-fast-to-be-sure image search, I didn\u2019t find any other examples of Cook wearing AirPods, either. Suspicious! The closest was this 2016 ABC News interview (at 1:44) where he says he\u2019s been wearing them for a while, he mimics holding a pair, but doesn\u2019t actually model them.\n\nWhat does it mean that, thrice now, the leader of the world\u2019s most powerful tech company couldn\u2019t be bothered to actually stick these gadgets in his ears for a photo op? I\u2019m not going to begin to answer that, because it\u2019s more fun to let you imagine, and definitely not because the actual answer is probably something obvious like \u201chis time is too valuable to run his own Twitter account,\u201d or \u201cApple is deathly afraid someone will snap a photo at the precise moment one of them accidentally falls out.\u201d", "description": "We all know Trump uses an iPhone, but does Tim Apple actually wear his own wireless headphones?
