See below for this week\u2019s Callout Collection \u2013 and just how realistic each one is.\n\n* * * * *\n\nFirst up, let\u2019s take a look at the night\u2019s prelim winners.\n\nMuslim Salikhov\n\nWants to fight: Li Jingliang\n\nThe callout: \u201cI want to invite to fight Li Jingliang. He is a big star in China. I also have a lot of fans there, so it could be a good fight for China. I think a lot of people wait for this match.\u201d\n\nThe reality: Muslim Salikhov (16-2 MMA, 3-1 UFC) took a wise approach to his selection of opponent, not necessarily focusing in on rankings or title shots but rather geographical needs for bankable draws. The \u201cKing of Kung Fu\u201d is a Russian native but spent time living in China while competing in Wushu and Sanda competitions. Salikhov\u2019s popularity in the nation was the reason his UFC debut was booked in China in November 2017, and though he slipped up that night, he\u2019s since battled back for three consecutive wins.\n\nThe tougher sell may be Jingliang (17-5 MMA, 9-3 UFC). While he is, indeed, a fast-rising star in his native China, he\u2019s also likely looking to compete on an international stage, as well. At 7-1 in his past eight UFC appearances \u2013 and with back-to-back \u201cPerformance of the Night\u201d bonuses to his name, \u201cThe Leech\u201d is on the cusp of breaking into the 170-pound rankings, but needs more eyeballs to do it than a Chinese Fight Night event might provide.\n\nStill, the UFC is high on developing its brand in China, and if the money and opponent are right, maybe Jingliang is willing to book one more home game.\n\nGallery Muslim Salikhov def.

Maybe let\u2019s see. If people like (the fight), I can do.\u201d\n\nThe reality: Twelve years into his octagon run, Demian Maia is unquestionably a legend in both the UFC and Brazilian jiu-jitsu communities. But at 41, the crafty veteran admits the end is near and is looking for two more fights before calling it a career.\n\nMeanwhile Sanchez (29-12 MMA, 18-12 UFC) has actually enjoyed an even longer UFC run, and though he\u2019s 37, appears nowhere near ready to say he\u2019s done. That said, the number of wars Sanchez has been through in his legendary career has left many concerned about his well-being. So if head trauma is a viable concern, why not face off with someone who actually takes pride in inflicting as little physical damage as possible en route to claiming victory.\n\nTwo UFC legends, both on the backside of their careers. They\u2019ve never faced off before, and neither has any more pressing matchups in the cards. It just makes sense.", "description": "Demian Maia and Muslim Salikhov were among those with specific names in mind for their next fight after UFC on ESPN+ 20.", "authors": ["John Morgan", "Nolan King", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Mike Bohn", "Farah Hannoun", "Matt Erickson"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/demian-maia-ufc-on-espn-plus-2-2-1.jpg?w=1024&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
