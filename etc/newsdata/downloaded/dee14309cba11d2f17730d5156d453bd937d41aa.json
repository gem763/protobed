And he said the government over the years had allowed state-owned Television New Zealand to become the nation\u2019s dominant player, which had eroded the ability of rivals like MediaWorks to compete fairly.\n\nHe said news of the sale plan was \u201cvery unsettling\u201d to its 600 or so employees, but that the company expects to find a buyer. He said he was traveling the country to reassure staff that, for now, it\u2019s business as usual. He said the board would reassess its options if a buyer can\u2019t be found.\n\nAnderson said he thought that from a cultural perspective, it was critical the network continues because of its role in promoting a vibrant democracy through its journalism as well as developing other local talent such as comedians.\n\nFormer anchor Hilary Barry said she was feeling \u201cincredibly sad and concerned\u201d about the announcement.\n\n\u201cThere are so many talented and genuinely wonderful people there,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cI just want to give every one of them a giant hug.\u201d\n\nRichard Harman, who runs the news website Politik, tweeted that if the network closed, it would return New Zealand television journalism \u201cto one complacent mediocre state broadcaster.\u201d\n\nKris Faafoi, New Zealand\u2019s minister of broadcasting, communications and digital media, said his thoughts were with MediaWorks staff \u201cin these uncertain times\u201d but that the decision to sell was a commercial one and he didn\u2019t want to intrude on that process or comment further.\n\nMediaWorks is owned by Los Angeles-based private equity firm Oaktree Capital Management. Anderson said the sale was a board decision and not a directive from Oaktree, and that the company hadn\u2019t been forced into selling for a financial reason such as being in danger of breaching bank covenants.\n\nIn its most recent financial statement, MediaWorks posted a 5.5 million New Zealand dollar ($3.5 million) loss in the year ending December. Overall revenue was up slightly over the previous year to NZ$305 million.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "New Zealand broadcaster MediaWorks on Friday announced it plans to sell its struggling television business, leaving hundreds of workers wondering if they will still have jobs if a buyer can't be found.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Nick Perry"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
