National Geographic reports that the iconic Great Pacific Garbage Patch \u2014 also known as the Pacific trash vortex \u2014 is really more of a soup of small plastic particles the sun has broken down, punctuated by larger items such as fishing nets and shoes. Much of the trash is dumped into the sea from ships. But most comes from land: bottles, cups, bags. The sun breaks down these items, but they do not really biodegrade. Instead, they enter animals\u2019 bodies, killing the animals immediately or entering marine food chains. These \u201cmicroplastics\u201d also block sunlight from supporting plankton and other backbone ecosystem species.\n\nOcean currents transport trash from shore to the middle of the ocean, but the problem is by no means distant and isolated. Researchers announced in June that they had found microplastic particles off California\u2019s idyllic Monterey Bay. And not just on the surface; the researchers found microplastics in surprising abundance in the middle of the water column. Anyone who cares about the marine ecosystem \u2014 and that ought to include every human \u2014 should be alarmed.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEnter the bipartisan group of senators, led by Sens. Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) and Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) , who have introduced a bill that would start to take on the problem. Save Our Seas 2.0 builds on an ocean cleanliness law President Trump already signed. The new legislation would overhaul the country\u2019s recycling infrastructure, which needs basic upgrades , such as the ability to effectively sort plastics into different grades of material. It would create a fund to respond to \u201cmarine debris events\u201d \u2014 like a container ship accident \u2014 enabling quick response to major mishaps. And it would finance research into repurposing used plastic into useful things \u2014 think everything from blue jeans to skateboards to telephone poles.\n\nEven if the United States does better, though, the problem will not end without other nations cleaning up their acts. Asian countries throw enormous amounts of plastic into the seas. The senators\u2019 bill would insist that the Trump administration prioritize ocean pollution and push for an international agreement on marine debris.\n\nPassing this bill would only represent a start, and Congress would have to monitor implementation closely, given Mr. Trump\u2019s allergy to even the most benign international agreements. But the legislation would be a start, and it merits quick and ringing approval.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "A bipartisan bill is just the first step away from disaster.", "authors": ["Editorial Board"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Ec0S_Yhwqtb5_nrgXQOgNwVexHs=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CMBLD5XXNEI6TLMLQXRKUAFVZY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
