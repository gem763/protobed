Rodriguez/Getty Images for Disney\n\nThe Jeremy Renner app, called \u201cJeremy Renner,\u201d is officially shut down for the foreseeable future, according to a note straight from the desk of the Avengers actor himself. In the note, simply titled \u201cGoodbye\u2026\u201d Renner writes: \u201cThe App has jumped the shark. Literally.\u201d It is unclear, as of the time of this reporting, what Renner means by \u201cLiterally.\u201d Closer investigation only conjures up more questions.\n\n\u201cDue to clever individuals who were able to manipulate ways to impersonate me and others within the app,\u201d Renner continues, \u201cI have asked ESCAPEX, the company that runs this app to shut it down immediately and refund anyone who has purchased any stars over the last 90 days.\u201d Stars are the currency of the app, and cost real human money to purchase.\n\nThe note goes on to express Jeremy Renner the man\u2019s disappointment at how Jeremy Renner the app \u201cturned into a place that is everything I detest and can\u2019t or won\u2019t condone.\u201d Renner is here referring to trolls who have taken over the platform, including users posing as Casey Anthony and Jeffrey Epstein, purporting to be huge fans of Renner. Renner initially launched the app in 2017 as a way to \u201cinteract with [his] fans and share a deeper look into [his] life.\u201d Not long after the launch, the app was plagued with angry Renner fans and extremely committed trolls. Farewell, Jeremy Renner the app. Some ideas are simply too big for this world to handle.\n\n\ud83d\udea8 \ud83d\udea8 \ud83d\udea8BREAKING \ud83d\udea8 \ud83d\udea8 \ud83d\udea8\n\n\n\nThe Jeremy Renner App is coming down soon.
