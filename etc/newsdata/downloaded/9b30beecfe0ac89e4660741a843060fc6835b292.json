Don't use Juul': Juul CEO issues stark warning to nonsmokers as he admits long-term effects of vaping are unknown\n\nThis statement makes no explicit mention of health concerns. While questions around the health effects of vaping were undoubtedly considered as part of this move, the main driver behind this decision seems to be the threat of new regulations on the sales of e-cigarettes.\n\nLawmakers are pushing to ban e-cigarettes\n\nA group of senators sent a letter to the Food and Drug Administration on Friday pushing the agency to ban e-cigarettes while it reviews their safety. President Donald Trump has proposed a nationwide ban on flavored e-cigarettes, and state and local officials are also considering varied regulations around e-cigarette sales.\n\nComplying with all these potential new laws could be a regulatory nightmare for Walmart, which has more than 5,300 stores in the US.\n\nRead more: San Francisco just banned e-cigarette sales, the first major US city to outlaw tobacco vapes\n\nTo top it all off, the e-cigarette market is relatively small for Walmart, a Walmart spokesperson told Business Insider.\n\nIn the end, Walmart likely determined that any lost sales aren't worth the potential regulatory headache associated with continuing to sell e-cigarettes.\n\nIf that's the case, then exiting the e-cigarette category was more of a business decision for Walmart than a political statement for or against the vaping industry and the health effects of its products.\n\nWalmart is also taking measures to restrict cigarette sales\n\nThis isn't meant to suggest that Walmart is unconcerned with the health effects of e-cigarettes or traditional cigarettes. The company has taken some recent actions restricting the sales of both.\n\nIn July Walmart raised the minimum age for tobacco purchases from 18 years old to 21 years old.\n\nThe company also announced in May that it would discontinue the sale of fruit- and dessert-flavored e-cigarettes, which research shows are preferred by minors. At the same time, Walmart announced employee training programs designed to prevent the sale of tobacco products to minors.\n\nTo some critics, however, that's not enough. And now that Walmart has announced it will stop selling e-cigarettes, they are pushing the company to drop all tobacco products.", "description": "Vaping products are a relatively small category for Walmart, so lost sales likely aren't worth the potential regulatory headache.", "authors": ["Hayley Peterson"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d73d4ec2e22af4347023234-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
