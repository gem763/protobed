Klopp, however, claims it is insulting to dismiss United as a \u201cnobody\u201d while Danny Mills\u2019 combined XI featuring only Liverpool players, the overwhelming odds on his team to win at Old Trafford and the negativity surrounding Solskj\u00e6r are designed purely to motivate the struggling hosts. \u201cPeople are trying to create it as a banana skin,\u201d said Klopp, who has not won at Old Trafford as Liverpool manager.\n\nCrystal Palace and the knack: how the Eagles became Man City\u2019s bogey team | Ben Fisher Read more\n\n\u201cThey are trying to make it as we are THE team and they are nobody. I saw the combined lineup and it\u2019s really funny \u2013 11 Liverpool players and no Man United players.\n\n\u201cThat is the situation everyone creates: that we are so good and they have so many problems, they can not play football anymore and we are flying. All this stuff gets built up in a week when there have been no other games. That is what I mean about building a banana skin. It is like we just have to go there and don\u2019t respect them on the level they deserve. We need to respect them to face the difficulties in the game and it will be there in the right way.\u201d\n\nLiverpool\u2019s victory over United at Anfield last season marked the end of Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s reign but was also their only win in the last 10 league meetings between the clubs. Klopp admits he would try to turn the insults that Solskj\u00e6r has faced to his advantage were the roles reversed.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest J\u00fcrgen Klopp saw off Jos\u00e9 Mourinho in his final match in charge of Manchester United last season. Photograph: Rui Vieira/AP\n\nThe Liverpool manager added: \u201cYes I would [find the buildup insulting]. I saw all these things and it looks like they want to help Man United. All these articles look like they have been written by Man United supporters.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll live with it. In the dressing room, that\u2019s the one advantage they have at the moment. And playing at home. It\u2019s like we have said: \u2018Here\u2019s the combined team\u2019 but we had nothing to do with it. I expected things like that this week but I was still surprised when I had a little look at the newspapers that the difference [between the teams] was that massive. I\u2019ve never seen a combined lineup like this but, in general, with the mood that these things create, yes I would use it.\u201d\n\nWhen asked to name one United player who would get in a combined team with Liverpool, however, Klopp chose the diplomatic line.\n\n\u201cI was always completely happy with my players and I don\u2019t look at other players,\u201d he replied. \u201cIf you asked me about Barcelona I will tell you the same. I don\u2019t want to have any Barcelona players in this specific Liverpool team at the moment.I am completely happy with my team. There\u2019s no difference \u2013 no Bayern player or Dortmund player, nothing \u2013 this is the team and I am completely happy with that.\u201d\n\nKlopp, meanwhile, has said it is unacceptable to force City to play twice in under 48 hours over the festive period due to television demands, but had rejected the champions\u2019 claims that December\u2019s schedule hands Liverpool an advantage in the title race. Liverpool have their own issues over Christmas with an 8pm kick-off at Leicester on Boxing Day, days after their return from the Club World Cup in Qatar, but Klopp has only sympathy for the demands placed on Pep Guardiola\u2019s players.\n\n\u201cWe have a game more in December than City. How can we have an advantage?\u201d he said. \u201cBut I am completely on City\u2019s side that these games where they have 46 hours between should not happen. It\u2019s like when we played Sunderland, it\u2019s just not OK. That was in 2016 and three years later we are still speaking about it.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\n\u201cNothing has changed. They [TV companies] pay a lot of money, that is true, but we still have to work on these things. Forty-eight hours between games is still pretty much unacceptable but less than 46 hours? I understand City [are unhappy] 100%.\u201d\n\nThe Liverpool defender Jo\u00ebl Matip, meanwhile, has signed a new five-year contract with the club.", "description": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp said Liverpool\u2019s visit to Old Trafford has been hyped as a potential banana skin to provoke a show of defiance from Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s side", "authors": ["Andy Hunter"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9cf1db105a7ebec6904d0422fc551d6567dddc12/0_0_2626_1576/master/2626.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=fe9e974ff777ae34e634d62d54b48218", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
