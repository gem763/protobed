Back in week one Jesse and Mel copped the all-time low score of 14.\n\nSo what exactly went down?\n\nHOUSE 5: Jesse and Mel\n\nThe couple really paid the price for their lack of effort. There was a prolonged awkward silence the moment the judges walked onto their first verandah.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re on a verandah, not in a garden,\u201d Shaynna Blaze said as she pulled a very sour face.\n\n\u201cC\u2019mon, like please; research, research. They have done it for all the bedrooms, the kitchens. \u2014 Jesse knows more than anything about the front of the house, the look.\u201d\n\nRELATED: The Block 2019: Ensuite, studio reveal\n\nThen she spotted a fake pot plant on the outdoor table and completely lost it. \u201cI am taking off extra points for taking the piss out of putting in this plastic plant. I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m hiding that. Not happy. Nah, this is ridiculous.\u201d\n\nNeale Whitaker described their basic design as being \u201clazy\u201d while Shaynna shook her head in agreeance.\n\n\u201cI thought Jesse and Mel perhaps more than anyone understood the value of St Kilda real estate and creating that dream. Where is the dream in here, where is the romance?\u201d Neale asked.\n\nAs Darren looked around he felt \u201cunderwhelmed\u201d and while he really liked the pot plants, the overall verandah to him was a bit \u201cmeh\u201d (his words).\n\nThen Neale went on a massive rant saying they can\u2019t just throw in the towel because they don\u2019t think people are going to use the verandah, comparing it to their amazing indoor courtyard from a few weeks back.\n\n\u201cAll I am seeing is some garden furniture on an empty verandah and a few pots which does not make it a lifestyle.\u201d\n\nThe upstairs verandah was even worse, according to the judges. Again, there was a moment of silence as they scouted the room.\n\n\u201cOh boy,\u201d Neale said.\n\nThat\u2019s when Shaynna described it as being \u201cboring as bats**t\u201d.\n\nDarren pointed out the style was disconnected to the rest of the house, while Neale said texture was missing.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at what they have been handed, it is the most beautiful shell \u2026 and to make such a mess is a tragedy.\u201d\n\n\u201cTalk about a missed opportunity.\u201d\n\nThe flogging continued mainly with the lack of creativity but let\u2019s cap it at that \u2014 you get the idea.\n\nThey came last.\n\nHOUSE 1: Mitch and Mark (Winners)\n\nThen you have Mitch and Mark whose verandahs earned them the first perfect score of the season.\n\n\u201cWhat a sanctuary,\u201d Shaynna said, as she panned the room.\n\nDarren took a seat on the sofa and began to compliment the decor, from the furniture to the fan and the heater.\n\n\u201cThey have planned the space well too,\u201d he said, pointing to the \u201clounge area\u201d and \u201cgarden\u201d section.\n\nNeale said it was a great extension of the entire house.\n\nShaynna loved how the timbers didn\u2019t match, giving it that sense of \u201cverandah\u201d.\n\n\u201cOh it\u2019s just stunning,\u201d she added. It was the homiest she felt in a while.\n\nRELATED: The Block 2019: Courtyard reveal\n\nRELATED: The Block 2019: Living and dining reveal\n\nUpstairs was just as good with the boys keeping true with the styling of level three\u2019s entertainment room.\n\nThey matched it with an alfresco dining table of 12. The enormity of the upstairs balcony blew the judges away.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a party house, don\u2019t you?\u201d Neale asked as he laughed. (It\u2019s a touchy subject) \u2026 \u201cand a party house with a view\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis is why you would live in St Kilda,\u201d Shaynna said and Darren agreed as he counted the seats around massive dining table.\n\n\u201cTwelve people wouldn\u2019t make a lot of noise if they were up here having a party with a master bedroom next door \u2026\u201d Darren said sarcastically.\n\nNeale intercepted to say that even though they referred to it as the \u201cparty house\u201d jokingly, it is seriously the \u201cultimate entertaining space\u201d.\n\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s when you step out here, it makes sense of the whole lifestyle that the house is selling. This is where it all makes sense.\u201d\n\nHe was very impressed the boys had the vision in week one.\n\n\u201cTo deliver this and get away with it is something quite exceptional.\u201d\n\nDarren just kept reminiscing about having a long lunch up there.\n\nAnd just like that, the Bondi boys got a well deserved score of 30.\n\nHOUSE 2: Tess and Luke\n\nConsidering Tess and Luke barely had a dollar to their name, they managed to pull off two very stylish verandahs, nabbing second place.\n\nWhile the judges didn\u2019t find quite as much going on as next door (Mitch and Mark), they still really appreciated their effort.\n\nDarren was a big fan of the industrial vibe and the concrete coffee table.\n\n\u201cLook it doesn\u2019t have the pizzazz of next door but it\u2019s still a very, very nice verandah,\u201d Neale said.\n\nRELATED: The Block 2019: Kitchen and butler\u2019s pantry reveal\n\nGiven they\u2019re on a dwindling budget, it was very well done according to the judges.\n\n\u201cThe pieces they have chosen have been chosen well and they do relate back to the aesthetic and vibe of the house. There\u2019s nothing cheap about this as well,\u201d Shaynna pointed out.\n\nAs she glanced over at the table and cup of coffee, she said they sold the story well.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re selling the idea and the lifestyle with the limited budget they have.\u201d\n\nThey then made their way to the verandah upstairs and the feedback remained consistent.\n\n\u201cI think they have done so well,\u201d Shaynna said, adding that functionality wise they have done just as good a job as Mitch and Mark.\n\nThe only issue Neale had was the positioning of the table, but even then he said Tess and Luke were doing \u201cpretty well\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt is consistent with what they have delivered downstairs. It\u2019s beautifully styled and I think they have done their absolute best with the available budget,\u201d a very proud Neale said.\n\nAll three judges loved the energy of both verandahs.\n\nAnd to Tess and Luke\u2019s surprise, they came second with a score of 23.5.\n\nRELATED: The Block 2019: Master ensuite reveal\n\nHOUSE 3: Andy and Deb\n\nJesse and Mel weren\u2019t the only couple to cop brutal feedback \u2014 Andy and Deb also found themselves in the firing line, but obviously not as bad as Jesse and Mel.\n\nThe judges were really disappointed with their lack of styling, saying it didn\u2019t represent their beachy, Scandi decor throughout the rest of the house.\n\n\u201cYou know what I\u2019m surprised I\u2019m not seeing given this is the \u2018beach, Scandi house\u2019? A hammock. It would have been perfect,\u201d Darren said.\n\n\u201cA crotched hammock would have been a much better choice than the sofa and it would have been really in line with what they have done inside.\u201d\n\nHe liked the simple, grey colour scheme and furniture but it wasn\u2019t enough to impress Shaynna.\n\n\u201cI think that (sofa) is way too industrial. It suits next-door (Tess and Luke\u2019s house) \u2026 they\u2019re not comfy chairs and the last thing I would ever want out on a verandah is a glass table. The dirt that would settle on that daily,\u201d Shaynna said.\n\nNeale interrupted to say he has always been a big fan of Andy and Deb\u2019s styling but when he walked through the door, he was expecting a little bit more.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to get excited about,\u201d he said honestly.\n\n\u201cAnd I know it\u2019s budget but I think within the budget they had, they could have injected more colour, personality and oomph.\u201d\n\nShaynna thought it didn\u2019t reflect their style at all.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the first time I\u2019m going to say this. This verandah doesn\u2019t connect to what they\u2019ve done,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s just about budget and saving money then Tess and Luke did a better job.\u201d\n\nThey then went to the upstairs verandah on the hunt for a hammock \u2014 they didn\u2019t find one.\n\nHowever they did like the decor better, with Neale saying there\u2019s more of a \u201cstory happening here\u201d.\n\n\u201cSuddenly they have created a little area you want to be in,\u201d he said.\n\nThey appreciated how it was more consistent with the rest of the house.\n\nBut Shaynna attacked the pots (again) and said she was also very disappointed there were no heaters.\n\n\u201cI feel this verandah has more generosity, more warmth than downstairs, but it\u2019s still undercooked,\u201d Neale swooped in to say, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s still not what I\u2019d be expecting from Deb and Andy.\u201d\n\nShaynna also used that harsh word \u2014 \u201cdisappointed\u201d to describe how she felt about their reveal.\n\nDarren agreed saying he couldn\u2019t remember the last time he walked into one of their rooms and didn\u2019t love it.\n\nThey came equal fourth with a score of 20.5.\n\nHOUSE 4: Matt and El\u2019ise\n\nMatt and El\u2019ise haven\u2019t had a win since earlier in the show and unfortunately this week wasn\u2019t about to change that.\n\nOnly Darren liked the layout of their verandas, Neale and Shaynna on the other hand weren\u2019t fans at all taking particular aim to the hard, \u201cpark bench\u201d.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a really lovely chair,\u201d Darren told the others.\n\nNeale sat down to try understand what Darren was talking about \u2014 but no.\n\n\u201cI think this is the hardest bench I have ever sat on in my life. I wouldn\u2019t even sit on this in a park.\u201d\n\nShaynna said the balcony was missing any sense of colour.\n\nShe looked into the adjoining master bedroom and said: \u201cWe have got a room in there with gorgeous colour, there\u2019s soft sage green, teal bits \u2026 why do we have to have this,\u201d she said, picking up the grey coloured pillows.\n\nNeale agreed, adding that everything jars and just doesn\u2019t work.\n\nHe was also confused about the mini fridge.\n\n\u201cOkay, you have a drink up here, but where do you bring the drink from? Nothing adds up in here. It\u2019s another hard space and there\u2019s another formality about it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really not responding to it at all.\u201d\n\nWell that\u2019s no good.\n\n\u201cTo me it seems to be a very muddled verandah.\u201d\n\nDarren however had no problem with any of it \u2014 except for the positioning of the mirror which had gutters reflecting from it.\n\nNeale got a little frustrated and asked him what exactly he liked about it.\n\n\u201cI really like this chair,\u201d Darren said as he sat on it, legs crossed. \u201cIt actually is quite beautiful.\n\n\u201cI like how consistent they have been with that monogrammatic pallet. It\u2019s a different approach but they have committed to it and I think they have done it nicely.\u201d\n\nSadly, not nicely enough.\n\nMatt and El\u2019ise came equal second last with a score of 20.5\n\nSCOREBOARD:\n\nMitch and Mark: 30 (winners)\n\nTess and Luke: 23.5\n\nAndy and Deb: 20.5\n\nMatt and El\u2019ise: 20.5\n\nJesse and Mel: 16.5\n\nThe Block airs tomorrow at 7pm on Channel 9", "description": "Remember when Jesse and Mel were copping repeated blows from the judges \u2014 well it was history repeating itself during Sunday night\u2019s verandah reveal.", "authors": ["Shireen Khalil"], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/fb87a8520213a10618c559dd84b79214?width=650", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
