Riyadh has not blamed any party for Saturday's strikes.\n\n* Those attacks, which knocked out about 5.7 million barrels per day (bpd) of Saudi output, targeted sites in Abqaiq and Khurais, in eastern Saudi Arabia.\n\n* Abqaiq processes crude from the giant Ghawar oil field for export to terminals in the Gulf and Red Sea.\n\n* Oil prices soared as much as 20% on Monday, with Brent crude posting its biggest intra-day percentage gain since the Gulf War in 1991.\n\n* Analysts said benchmark Brent <LCOc1>, now trading at around $66 a barrel, could hit $100 if Riyadh failed to quickly bring back supply.\n\n* The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is assessing the impact but says it is too early for members to take any action on raising production or holding a meeting, the UAE energy minister and other sources said.\n\n* Saudi Aramco's full return to normal oil output volumes \"may take months\", two sources said on Monday.\n\n* Saudi Arabia usually ships more than 7 million bpd of oil to global destinations and has for years served as the market's supplier of last resort.\n\n* The attack, which knocked out more than half of Saudi Arabia's output, constrained its ability to use more than 2 million bpd of spare oil capacity held for emergencies.\n\n* Saudi Aramco has been seeking to prepare for a share sale that would make it the world's largest listed company.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Compiled by Edmund Blair; Editing by Mark Heinrich)", "description": "* Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthi group, which is battling a Saudi-led coalition in Yemen, claimed responsibility for the attacks on Saturday on sites run by state-owned Saudi Aramco.  * U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo ruled out Yemeni involvement and accused Iran of leading the attacks.  * U.S.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/JW2xvfbPq7MwUPCt63E.dQ--~B/aD0yNTc7dz00NTA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/reuters.com/7e90296544687fc2d0fb61926137e09a", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
