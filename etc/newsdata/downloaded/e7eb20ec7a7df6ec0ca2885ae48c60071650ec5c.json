Maybe yes, but what are you celebrating even after so many yugas have passed? For people to remember certain days, ancients marked these days in the vedic calendar, to pass on certain messages. Broadly understanding, it is the day of defeating evil. But what is good and evil? When we say creation is the balance of equal forces, evil becomes a necessary part of creation. The existence of Rama is only relevant till Ravana is there. It is up to us to choose between the two forces. For the ones who want to commence on the journey of the spirit for the purpose of evolution, ancients gave practices like Sanatan Kriya. Sanatan, which means eternal, is relevant in every era of creation. The Ram-Ravan conquest is an eternal war, if you choose positivity, evolution, service and the righteous way of life, Dussehra is a day of your victory over so many facets of evil, like maya, which rule this planet, especially in this yuga, this phase of life.\n\nDussehra is preceded by nine days of fasting, what we call as the navratras. Fasting here does not mean abstinence from certain foods and binging on alternatives. Fasting simply means abstaining from indulging your senses for specific periods of time for a higher purpose. It includes observing austerities and strict discipline, those of satya, asteya, aparigraha, ahimsa and brahmacharya on each of the days and beyond. The discipline of niyam is the kiln, the heat of which turns a normal being into a yogi.\n\nThe question then arises, why these nine days? A yogi is not bound by time and muhurat, yog is sanatan \u2013 that is, it has no beginning, no end. A yogi has access to all the energies that run this creation. However, to reward sadhaks certain days are charged with abundant, vibrant powers and accelerated results.\n\nThe nine days of navratras are the days when the energies of Godesses Durga, Lakshmi and Saraswati are most accessible to humans. These shaktis then play instrumental role in opening the three knots \u2013 Rudra, Vishnu and Brahma Granthi corresponding to the upper, middle and lower regions of the body respectively, to aid you in your purpose. The cumulative effect of self-purification through fasting and accessing these energies through Sanatan Kriya under the guidance of the Guru is the free upward movement of prana in the Sushumna nadi by conquering the basic sensual desires and pleasures. It is this that opens the doors to the inner world and enables a being to realize the divinity within. The tenth or the final day, that is, Dussehra marks this ultimate conquest, and hence is called Vijayadashmi. The universe exists inside a being, outside is only its reflection. So go inwards if you choose to fathom it. Or else, the reflection would fool you into wasting your life.\n\nThus, for a spiritual seeker, Dussehra is the culmination of mantra sadhna and havan under the sanidhya of Guru to invoke these energies to aid the creation and in the process realise the divinity within to slay the demons. That is your Vijayadashmi. Remember, each one is a divine being, going through a human experience. All need an anchor to give us the experience and to make us aware of the divinity and hidden powers in us. So find your anchor and get your experience; lest you waste this life as well!", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.speakingtree.in/b/582934-1350-420-5-1539683368/find-your-divine-self-this-dussehra.img", "published_at": "2015-10-22"}
