Democrats trained their fire on the process Maguire went through after receiving the complaint, and on whether the White House and Department of Justice had influenced Maguire\u2019s initial decision to withhold the explosive whistleblower complaint from Congress.\n\nThough Democrats were reluctant to declare that the whistleblower complaint\u2014and the White House\u2019s handling of it\u2014constituted a readymade impeachment case, they spent Thursday\u2019s hearing laying the groundwork through largely process-oriented questioning. It\u2019s a strategy that fits with Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s official line on her party\u2019s renewed impeachment plans: assiduous fact-finding first, and articles of impeachment later\u2014if at all.\n\nSetting the tone was House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA), who grilled Maguire over the question of when his office went to White House and Department of Justice lawyers\u2014all while knowing that those officials, including Attorney General Bill Barr, were subjects of the whistleblower\u2019s complaint.\n\n\"You went to the subject of the complaint for advice,\u201d asked Schiff, \u201con whether you should provide the complaint to Congress?\"\n\nDemocratic lawmakers left the hearing on Thursday increasingly convinced that the complaint, and Maguire\u2019s testimony, pointed to a concerted effort from the White House to prevent Trump\u2019s call with Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky from becoming public.\n\nThat move, to Rep. Jim Himes (D-CT), another Intelligence panel member, would constitute an impeachable offense\u2014if proven.\n\n\u201cIf the allegations in the complaint are true, of an attempt to extort a foreign leader for political gain, of an attempt to cover that up by putting transcripts into unusual locations that certainly meets, at least in my mind, the standard of an impeachable offense,\u201d he said.\n\nThe nine-page complaint, released minutes before Maguire\u2019s testimony began, details allegations the individual said were told to them by multiple \u201cdeeply disturbed\u201d White House officials.\n\nIt centered on a July 25 phone call with Zelensky in which Trump asked Ukraine\u2019s leader to do him a \u201cfavor\u201d and investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, according to a previously released transcript.\n\nThat call was so disturbing, the complaint said, that White House officials moved to \u201clock down\u201d the details of the call because of the likelihood \u201cthat they had witnessed the President abuse his office for personal gain.\u201d\n\nThe records were transferred to the White House\u2019s most secure servers, usually reserved \u201cto store and handle classified information of an especially sensitive nature.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne White House official described this act as an abuse of this electronic system because the call did not contain anything remotely sensitive from a national security perspective,\u201d the complaint said.\n\nIt also notes White House officials told the whistleblower that this wasn\u2019t the first time that a transcript of a talk between Trump and a world leader had been placed into the White House\u2019s most secure system \u201cfor the purpose of protecting politically sensitive\u2026 information.\u201d\n\nThe whistleblower wrote that while they were not personally privy to the events that sparked their concern, enough officials had relayed similar accounts the whistleblower believed them to be true and urgently in need of attention.\n\nMaguire dropped no bombshells as he defended his office\u2019s delay in sending the complaint to Congress. In the process, however, he did offer some revealing answers. For example, Maguire cited executive privilege in refusing to say whether he had discussed the complaint with President Trump\u2014even while he categorically denied that Trump had asked him to disclose to him the whistleblower\u2019s identity.\n\nMaguire also confirmed on numerous occasions that he believed the whistleblower was credible, though he shied away from questions over whether the complaint met the legal definition of \u201curgent\u201d that would have required congressional notification.\n\nRepeatedly, he noted that \u201cit is not my place\u201d to determine the credibility of a whistleblower complaint. In the process of doing that, Maguire said he felt the complaint lined up with the transcript of Trump\u2019s call.\n\nIn response to a question from Rep. Jackie Speier (D-CA) about whether the whistleblower was a \u201cspy\u201d as Trump has openly mused, Maguire said that person had followed the law and believed they were acting in good faith.\n\n\u201cAs I said several times so far this morning, I believe that the whistleblower complied with the law and did everything that they thought--he or she thought was responsible under the Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the occasions when Democrats did go into questions around the substance of the complaint, Maguire shut them down. When Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA) asked him about the whistleblower\u2019s allegation that the White House moved transcripts of the Zelensky call to their most protected server, the intel chief replied that how the president\u2019s office \u201cconducts their business is their business.\u201d At other points, Maguire simply stressed that his sole responsibility was leading the intelligence community.\n\n\u201cThere has never been a matter that the [intelligence community\u2019s inspector general] has investigated that did not involve a member of the intelligence community,\u201d Maguire said, about the unprecedented nature of the whistleblower\u2019s complaint.\n\nMaguire did not bite either when Democrats pressed him to weigh in on whether or not Trump\u2019s conduct was wrong, inappropriate, or detrimental to U.S. security, only saying that outside interference in American selections \u201cis unwarranted, it is unwelcome, it is bad for the nation.\u201d\n\nFor the most part, Republicans sought to undermine the Democrats\u2019 arguments and distract from the substance of the complaint. Only one Republican directly addressed Trump\u2019s conduct, Rep. Michael Turner of Ohio.\n\n\u201cI've read the transcript of the conversation with the president and the president of the Ukraine,\u201d Turner said. \u201cConcerning that conversation, I want to say to the president this is not okay. That conversation is not okay. And I think it's disappointing to the American public when they read the transcript.\u201d\n\nBut Turner then trained his fire on Democrats: \u201cWe've not been focusing on the issues of the national security threats, but instead of the calls for impeachment, which is really an assault on the electorate, not just this president.\u201d", "description": "\u201cAs I said several times so far this morning, I believe that the whistleblower complied with the law,\u201d acting Director of Intelligence Joseph Maguire told the committee.", "authors": ["Sam Brodey", "Scott Bixby", "Congressional Reporter", "National Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_2742,w_4876,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569523258/GettyImages-1177273925_p79ryk", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
