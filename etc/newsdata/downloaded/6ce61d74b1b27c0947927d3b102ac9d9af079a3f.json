But her longest job was working as a nanny for wealthy families.\n\nFive years ago, she left a PhD program hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt. Now she\u2019s a multi-millionaire CEO in Malibu.\n\nTo get there, she decided what she would have, held both long- and short-term goals, and listened to what was right for her.\n\nVisit Business Insider\u2019s homepage for more stories.\n\nI\u2019ve had a lot of jobs in the 33 years I\u2019ve been alive.\n\nI used to be a cocktail server. I also worked as a hostess, a steakhouse server, Mexican restaurant server, newspaper intern, and barista.\n\nI\u2019ve worked at a bookstore, a jewelry store, a cable company, a sheet metal company, a church, an inner city school as a therapist, and a family counseling center as a play-therapist. My longest running job, however, was as a nanny to a few wealthy families in the wildly affluent Highland Park, Texas. Through my undergraduate studies in psychology, while I earned a master\u2019s degree in counseling, and well into the PhD I eventually left behind to start and grow my business, I burped babies, cooked chicken nuggets for snack time, and folded someone else\u2019s downy-soft Egyptian cotton bath towels.\n\nI spent the rest of my waking hours hanging flyers for my life coaching business on every bulletin board at every Starbucks in Dallas every day, working with the early clients those flyers brought me, and trying to piece enough money together to pay my rent and create the life I wanted. I built my first website myself by reading very non-blonde-girl-friendly message boards and watching how-to YouTube videos. There were many all-nighters as I taught myself internet marketing, online branding, and digital content creation, but I was determined. By the time I graduated with my masters degree and dropped out of my PhD program, I had a couple hundred thousand dollars in student loan debt, no money in savings, and had gotten enough of a taste of entrepreneurship through my baby life-coaching business that I knew I absolutely could not work for someone else. I was afraid \u2013 really, really afraid of failure, but I had a hunch that I could do this. I had to figure out how to make money and make a difference.\n\nIt\u2019s been five years since I quit my PhD program, and five years and three months since I launched my first digital course. Today Amanda Frances Inc. is a multi-million dollar company that provides unique business development and personal development courses to hundreds of thousands of women, teaching them how to launch their own online businesses, and empowering them to design lives and businesses they love. I am completely self-taught when it comes to technology, marking, branding, and messaging side of my business. My company grossed nearly $3 million in revenue last year and earned $1 million in the first quarter of 2019.\n\nCatapulting my life from being a nanny from Sand Springs, Oklahoma to a multi-millionaire CEO living in Malibu, California while running the company of my dreams might seem like a far-fetched meteoric rise based on pure luck and chance, but if there\u2019s one thing I know for certain it\u2019s this: You can have the life you\u2019ve designed in your dreams, every single bit of it.\n\nLots of people like to ask me what mentors did I have, what business books did I read? Who did I follow? I have never read a single business book or taken a business course. I don\u2019t listen to podcasts. I simply chose (and continue to choose) to learn how to master my own wealth and destiny, and then teach other women to do the same.\n\nHere are my top three best and biggest pieces of advice for moving your vision forward and achieving your dreams.\n\n1. Decide what you will have. Write it down.\n\ncaption Decide what your dreams are. source JGI/Jamie Grill/Getty\n\nIn my eight years of running this company, and five years of my business fully supporting me, I have observed that when most people say they\u2019re going to do something, they often go back-and-forth, questioning themselves often, while taking on outside opinions that say their desired outcome is far fetched and impossible to achieve.\n\nThe truth is, without a real decision, nothing ever moves forward.\n\nA firm, committed, non-negotiable internal decision is required to move your dreams forward.\n\nEvery day in my journal I listed out who I was, what I would have, and where I was going.\n\nThat is something I still do today.\n\nThat nanny/cocktail server had already made her decision already. The company I have today was clear in my heart and mind from behind that bar.\n\n2. Hold two visions at a time.\n\ncaption Know what your short term and long term goals are. source 10\u2019000 Hours/Getty Images\n\nMy first business goal was to afford two blowouts a month and pay my rent with business earnings.\n\nEight years later, I\u2019m buying a multimillion dollar house in a posh neighborhood in LA and meet seven-figure investment goals. How? I hold two visions at once. I always know what the short term goal is (i.e.: the next thing you will buy, do, or pay off in the immediate future) and the long term goal is (the big vision in your life and the wild goals you deeply long to achieve). Through holding two visions at a time, the daily steps I take are able to move both goals forward. I encourage you to see yourself as at your next level of success while continuing to do what is required in your daily life. In this way, you can meet the daily needs of your business while knowing that all steps are adding up to your bigger vision. Even when I was in school and working three of these jobs at at time, I did what was required each day for those job and I held tightly to the vision of the company I was building.\n\n3. Ignore everyone \u2014 and I mean everyone.\n\ncaption Only listen to the people who help you believe in yourself. source Westend61/Getty\n\nA lot of people will have opinions about what you should do to achieve your dreams. Unless they have what you want, ignore them. (This includes your psychic, pastor, and parents.) You have to do what works for, is right for, and makes sense to you. It doesn\u2019t matter who says it isn\u2019t wise, realistic, or business savvy. You have the unique insight for the business that you desire to bring to the world. You have to trust your own intuition.\n\nThe thing is, the rules are outdated. And only going after what is realistic is not what your soul is yearning for.\n\nOnly listen to the people and things that help you believe in yourself and your limitless possibility.\n\nWhether you\u2019re just embarking on your entrepreneurial journey or are well into it, remember that a daily commitment to yourself and your vision is the difference between a business that barely moves forward, experiencing inconsistent success, and a thriving business that multiples their revenue every year.\n\nBack when I was working all of those jobs (not that long ago, really!) I knew and believed in the plans I had for myself and my life \u2013 and acted accordingly each day.\n\nAmanda Frances is a self-made multimillionaire, digital course creator, Forbes contributor, podcaster, and spiritual business mentor to the hundreds of thousands of women who follow her work online.
