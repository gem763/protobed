Given the chance, they'd use every instrument of government power to try and shut you down.\"\n\nTrump's support among white evangelicals has been unflagging since he won 80 per cent of their vote in 2016. But his recent decision to pull back troops from northern Syria has exposed some fractures in that reliable base.\n\nPat Robertson, a longtime Trump supporter and founder of the Christian Broadcasting Network, said last week that Trump \"is in danger of losing the mandate of heaven\" for betraying the Kurds.\n\nBefore Trump spoke, Cissie Graham Lynch, the granddaughter of the late Reverend Billy Graham, offered prayers for the Kurdish people. Then she prayed for Trump and Vice-President Mike Pence.\n\nWhen Trump took the stage, Andrew Brunson, a pastor who had been a prisoner in Turkey for two years and was accused of committing crimes on behalf of Kurdish fighters, prayed over him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I ask that you give the president supernatural discernment to know who is trustworthy and who is not. Bring into the light all deception and intrigue. Expose and reverse the plans of those who would harm President Trump and this nation,\" Brunson said, his hand on Trump's shoulder.\n\nYet some of the harshest criticism of Trump over his Syrian pullout has come from members of his Republican Party, including his closest congressional allies.\n\nIn a tweet, Representative Dan Crenshaw, a Texas Republican, seized on the President's complaint about the United States being stuck in an \"endless war\".\n\n\"Situation when we were there: relative peace. We leave: Turkey attacks our Kurdish allies, shoots artillery at US troops, bombs a prison where ISIS fighters already escaped. ISIS car bomb in Qamishli. That's just day one. Which scenario looks more like an endless war?\" Crenshaw said.\n\nTrump sought to reassure the crowd that Turkey would face \"swift, strong and severe economic sanctions\" if it did \"not meet their commitments, including the protection of religious minorities\". He also announced $US50 million ($73.7 million) in emergency financial assistance to Syrian groups that support ethnic and religious victims of this conflict.\n\nEarlier in his remarks, Trump spent considerable time lashing out at the House impeachment inquiry, arguing that it is for \"horrible, horrible crimes\" and labelling it a \"witch hunt\".\n\nHe also rehashed the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, telling the crowd that the accounts of sexual assault were \"phony stories about him. They were made up. Just like they are made up about me and other people\".\n\nChristine Blasey Ford alleged that Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her when they were teenagers. Kavanaugh has denied the accusation.\n\nWashington Post", "description": "Donald Trump at the weekend defended his decision to withdraw US\u00a0forces from northern Syria before a crowd of evangelicals, as many in the religious community have condemned the President's move.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3531%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/f27ea3041cf292b18c32fe3ef6a8a2187f08179e", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
