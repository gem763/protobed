Eighty percent of the communities in Brazil have a very poor sacramental life,\u201d said Brazilian Cardinal Claudio Hummes, president of the Pan-Amazon Church Network (REPAM).\n\nThe issue deeply upsets some traditionalists, who argue that making an exception for the Amazon would open the door to the end of celibacy for priests, which is not a Church law and only dates back to the 11th century.\n\nThe German Catholic Church in particular, which has an influential progressive wing, has been hotly debating the subject.\n\nThe synod, which runs until October 27, will also reflect on making official roles for women, who already play a central part in the Amazonian Church.\n\n\u201cIf women are excluded, half of the Church is excluded,\u201d said Sister Laura, an Italian missionary who has worked in the Pan-Amazon region for 10 years.\n\nOf the 184 prelates at the synod, 113 hail from the Amazonian region, including 57 from Brazil.\n\nOthers taking part include 17 representatives of Amazonian indigenous peoples and ethnic groups, and 35 women \u2014 who will not have the right to vote on the final document.", "description": "Vatican City (AFP) \u2013 Pope Francis will gather Catholic bishops at the Vatican Sunday to champion the isolated and poverty-struck indigenous", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/04/32222b_pope-francis-met-representatives-indigenous-communities-amazon-basin-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
