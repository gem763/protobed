Ramon Espinosa/Associated Press\n\n\u201cWe want people to know that even though the storm\u2019s category has changed, Dorian is still expected to bring life-threatening storm-surge, heavy wind and rain to the area from Florida to the Carolinas over the next few days,\u201d said Carlos Castillo, a FEMA deputy administrator.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis said he was grateful Florida was poised to dodge the worst, when a week ago it looked like a potential catastrophe for the state.\n\nA hurricane warning was issued for portions of the South Carolina and North Carolina coastlines.\n\nShifting forecasts for the storm\u2019s path and intensity have frustrated contingency planners, who have had to adjust quickly to reposition resources. Utility crews from Nebraska that staged in Orlando ended up heading home after Dorian was downgraded and its trajectory shifted. Hospitals raced to transport backup generators to facilities that suddenly fell under the potential path.\n\nAcross Florida, Georgia and South Carolina, the American Red Cross had 170 shelters open that served 13,000 people, said Charley English, the group\u2019s emergency management liaison. Shelters were opening Tuesday in North Carolina, he said. With those shelters, the group could temporarily house as many as 60,000 people.\n\nNo parts of Florida had a higher than 12% chance of seeing hurricane-force winds, federal data showed, but some coastal areas still were expected to face dangerous winds. While hurricanes that have been downgraded can regain strength, forecasters didn\u2019t expect much change to Dorian\u2019s intensity in the next couple of days.\n\nBahamas Prime Minister Hubert Minnis confirmed five deaths in the Abaco Islands. \u201cWe are in the midst of a historic tragedy in parts of the northwestern Bahamas,\u201d he said Monday, adding that the government\u2019s focus now was search, rescue and recovery. He said initial reports from the Abaco Islands were that \u201cdevastation is unprecedented and extensive.\u201d\n\nAs many as 13,000 homes may have been severely damaged or destroyed, according to an initial assessment by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. In the Abaco Islands, wells were likely contaminated by tidal surge, leaving the water and sewer utility in need of pumps and equipment, according to the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency.\n\n\u2018We are in the midst of a historic tragedy in parts of the northwestern Bahamas,\u2019 Prime Minister Hubert Minnis said.

U.S. Coast Guard helicopter crews continued helping with rescue efforts there Tuesday.\n\nThe hurricane was the strongest on modern record to strike the northwestern Bahamas. Scientists who have studied the impact of climate on storms have broadly concluded that warmer air and warmer water temperatures are expected to increase the intensity of hurricanes, generating storms with more rainfall and wind speed. Evidence suggests this is already occurring. One study, cited by the U.S. government\u2019s 2018 National Climate Assessment, found the \u201cheaviest rainfall amounts from intense storms, including hurricanes, have increased by 6% to 7%, on average, compared to what they would have been a century ago.\u201d Scientists, however, don\u2019t agree whether the frequency of hurricanes is affected by a changing climate.\n\nIn Florida, mandatory evacuation orders were lifted for some counties but remained in nine counties, according to the state\u2019s Division of Emergency Management.\n\nFlood Risk As a hurricane\u2019s strength intensifies, so does its potential to cause flooding along the coast.

Miami\n\nA hurricane warning was in effect from Jupiter Inlet in Palm Beach County to Ponte Vedra Beach in northern Florida.\n\nIn Melbourne Beach, Fla., Vanessa Brancheau said she and her husband and three children planned to stay put in their house a half-block from the ocean. Although also under a mandatory evacuation order, she said she had faith the family would be safe during the storm, given its shift to the east.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very confident that it\u2019s not going to get crazy,\u201d she said.\n\nMs. Brancheau and her husband stocked up on food, fuel and propane. They have a battery-powered radio and board games to entertain the children\u2014ages 10, 7 and 3\u2014in the event of a blackout.\n\nEight Florida hospitals and about 110 assisted-living facilities and nursing homes evacuated ahead of Dorian\u2019s arrival, according to state health-care trade groups. One hospital was scheduled to reopen Tuesday evening. For those that have remained open, Dorian\u2019s strength, unpredictable path and slow progress have complicated preparations for the storm and immediate recovery.\n\nHCA Healthcare Inc., one of the nation\u2019s largest hospital companies, had dispatched 34 generators as of Thursday to serve as backup generators to the emergency generators already in place at HCA hospitals in Florida, said Jonathan Perlin, the company\u2019s chief medical officer.\n\nAs Dorian\u2019s predicted path changed, HCA made similar preparations along the new track, he said. But the company left in place many of the backup generators in Florida as forecasters warned Dorian\u2019s path may be uncertain, he said. \u201cPrudence dictated we keep them in Florida,\u201d he said.\n\nFlorida Power & Light Co., which had some 17,000 utility workers ready to respond to outages caused by Dorian, said late Tuesday afternoon that it had restored nearly 70,000 outages that occurred as Dorian\u2019s outer bands of severe weather affected Florida\u2019s east coast. Most were caused by trees and other vegetation falling on equipment and power lines, the company said.\n\nStates of emergency were in effect in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia.\n\nSouth Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster issued mandatory evacuation orders for coastal residents in eight counties. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp ordered an evacuation of six coastal counties starting at the same time. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper ordered a mandatory evacuation of all the state\u2019s barrier islands as of early Wednesday.\n\nShifting Paths Forecasts of Dorian\u2019s track have fluctuated in the past week, making it difficult to predict where, or if, the storm will make landfall in the U.S. 5-day probable track area Projected path as of 5 p.m. Tuesday Atlantic Ocean 5 p.m. Aug. 29 Storm location at 5 p.m. Tuesday Aug. 27 forecast 5 p.m. Aug. 31 Dorian\u2019s actual path 5 p.m. Aug. 27 5-day probable track area Projected path as of 5 p.m. Tuesday Atlantic Ocean 5 p.m. Aug. 29 Storm location at 5 p.m. Tuesday Aug. 27 forecast 5 p.m. Aug. 31 Dorian\u2019s actual path 5 p.m. Aug. 27 5-day probable track area Projected path as of 5 p.m. Tuesday Atlantic Ocean 5 p.m. Aug. 29 Storm location at 5 p.m. Tuesday Aug. 27 forecast 5 p.m. Aug. 31 Dorian\u2019s actual path 5 p.m. Aug. 27 5-day probable track area Projected path as of 5 p.m. Tuesday Atlantic Ocean 5 p.m. Aug. 29 Aug. 27 Storm location at 5 p.m. Tuesday Dorian\u2019s path 5 p.m. Aug. 31 5 p.m. Aug. 27\n\nMr. Kemp reversed eastbound lanes on Interstate 16 on Tuesday for more than 100 miles from Savannah west to Dublin. Mr. McMaster reversed eastbound lanes of Interstate 26 to Charleston for more than 100 miles on Monday, saying he knew changes in traffic patterns could be inconvenient but it was critical to ensure safety.\n\nDorian took a toll on U.S. industries while still miles away in the Atlantic. Seaports from Miami to Charleston, S.C., have closed or plan to, including Port of Charleston, S.C., one of the busiest ports on the East Coast. Meat giant Tyson Foods closed its Jacksonville, Fla. beef-processing plant Tuesday as a cautionary step, a company spokesman said.\n\nOrlando International Airport closed through late Wednesday afternoon, while Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International was slated to reopen at noon Tuesday, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. JetBlue and Spirit canceled a quarter of their scheduled flights Tuesday.\n\nAuthorities to the north were also closely tracking forecasts for Dorian. In Massachusetts, the state\u2019s emergency management agency said Dorian could bring tropical storm conditions to Nantucket, Cape Cod and other coastal areas as early as Friday.\n\nShare Your Thoughts What would you do if you lived in central coastal Florida?
