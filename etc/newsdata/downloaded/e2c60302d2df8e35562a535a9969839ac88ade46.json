But they are short of A310,\u201d said a trader, who added that some of the cargoes are to be supplied to South Korea.\n\nA310 is a naphtha grade that comes from Ras Tanura where Saudi Aramco operates a condensate splitter. It could not be confirmed what the throughput was at the splitter.\n\nAsia\u2019s naphtha market has been volatile since the attacks. South Korea\u2019s YNCC bought naphtha on Thursday at a premium of about $10 a tonne to Japan quotes on a cost-and-freight (C&F) basis, industry sources said, marking the highest price it has paid since May 2018, Reuters data showed.\n\nAlthough Saudi Arabia\u2019s monthly naphtha exports between January to August at about 327,000 tonnes is not even half of United Arab Emirates\u2019 at 1 million tonnes, based on data from Refinitiv Oil Research, any production lost in Saudi would impact Asia since it is structurally short of naphtha.\n\nBut industry sources said the recent persistent oversupply has helped cushion the impact as this allows Saudi Arabia to buy cargoes.\n\n\u201cNaphtha is globally oversupplied. Limited risk ... apart from tension on premium,\u201d one source said.\n\n\u201cAramco has managed to cover the production losses with cargoes sourced elsewhere for September/October loadings,\u201d said a second source.\n\n\u201cThey sell most of their cargoes on a CFR (cost and freight) basis, meaning they can supply their buyers with alternative naphtha sourced from all over,\u201d the source added.\n\nAramco also won a spot tender to buy a 38,000 tonne cargo from Egypt\u2019s EGPC for late October loading in Suez, a European naphtha trader said.\n\nAramco also has a deal with Egypt signed earlier this year to take up to 77,000 tonnes of naphtha this month.\n\nApart from the European cargoes, Aramco has bought 60,000 tonnes of naphtha from India\u2019s Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) this week.\n\n\u201cSo far they\u2019ve [Aramco Trading] paid three huge numbers on tenders,\u201d the European trader said referring to the purchases from Greece\u2019s Hellenic, EGPC and HPCL.", "description": "Saudi Aramco has booked at least 120,000 tonnes of naphtha for September loading from Europe in a rare move as it seeks to plug a supply gap following attacks on its oil facilities on Saturday, industry sources said.", "authors": ["Seng Li Peng", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
