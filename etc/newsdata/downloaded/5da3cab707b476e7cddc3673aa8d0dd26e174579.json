He made it popular,\u201d Nicolas Arauz, president and CEO of Caswell-Massey, told FOX Business of the brand\u2019s No. 1 selling product.\n\nPresident Washington allegedly stumbled on the brand\u2019s Number Six fragrance \u2013 with notes of citrus, bergamot, rosemary, amber, and musk -- in 1780. The brand also says he gifted a case of it to Frenchman Marquis de Lafayette. Today, the scent, which costs $225 per bottle, is made in New Jersey.\n\nCaswell-Massey started as an apothecary shop in Newport, Rhode Island in 1752 when Scottish-born doctor William Hunter introduced a line of fine-fragrance bath and body products like men\u2019s shaving products and soap. It went on to open a New York City store on Fifth Avenue in 1854, and just opened its latest outpost in downtown Manhattan aimed at attracting a younger audience to the legacy brand.\n\nBut instead of breaking into the subscription-boxed business model to attract a new demographic, Caswell-Massey said having a retail presence was a priority so customers can smell and experiences the fragrances in person.\n\n\u201cWe sell a lot of blind buys online, but it\u2019s still not the same as experiencing it in person,\u201d Arauz said.\n\nMADE IN AMERICA: HOW THIS COMPANY COOKS UP COOKWARE ACROSS THE U.S.A.\n\nBars of soap is also a top-selling item, Arauz said, despite reports that suggest younger generations are killing the industry. Bar soap sales dropped 2.2% from 2014 to 2015 with Millennials saying it\u2019s inconvenient to use, according to a report from market research firm Mintel.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "This U.S. president made American fragrance company Caswell-Massey a legacy brand.", "authors": ["Jeanette Settembre"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/b0b79946-Made-in-America.png?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
