Kidding no-one! Resist the Great Replacement wherever you can by giving this kip a wide berth. #ShopIrish #BuyIrish.\u2019\n\nA number of people then inundated the family with racist and offensive comments which said white people were being \u2018replaced\u2019, claimed the ad promoted \u2018race/ancestor betrayal\u2019 and compared the \u2018IQ of central Africans [with] the IQ of mentally disabled\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOthers used the n-word and called for a boycott of Lidl.\n\nAfter the couple reported it to Garda, they were allegedly told it was a civil matter.\n\nBut after taking advice from the European Network Against Racism Ireland (Enar), they filed a report and have had a meeting with an investigating officer.\n\nFormer journalist Gemma O\u2019Doherty was slammed by Lidl online after posting this tweet (Picture: Twitter)\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nAfter deciding they lived in a country which failed to enact robust hate-crime legislation, the couple \u2013 who met in London seven years ago \u2013 have decided to move from their home in County Meath and return to England.\n\nMs Ryan told RTE she was shocked by the \u2018harrowing\u2019 comments they\u2019d received online, which made her break down in tears and fear for her young son\u2019s safety.\n\nShe said: \u2018I was so shaken I broke down in tears. It was the last straw and, yes, we decided we really need to lay low, to leave.\n\n\u2018We booked flights. We just thought, could they actually find us if we stay where we are?\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe continued: \u2018When I read through them all I kind of feared for my safety, for my son\u2019s safety straightaway.\n\n\u2018It was pretty harrowing to have to read through all that and I don\u2019t think anybody should be subjected to that kind of online abuse.\u2019\n\nMr Mathis, who grew up in Liverpool and the Cotswolds, said: \u2018I got so upset and angry at the same time. These people are looking at my child and saying all this hurtful stuff. He\u2019s a completely innocent child.\u2019\n\nThe family have now moved back to the UK (Picture: Lidl)\n\nMr Mathis said he received a lot of racist abuse over the years (Picture: Lidl)\n\nHe added that racist abuse had been \u2018a theme throughout my life\u2019, saying: \u2018These people don\u2019t care, they are filled with hate and ignorance.\u2019\n\nThe couple are now advocating for tougher regulation of social media platforms.\n\nAfter the family was targeted online, Lidl released a statement that read: \u2018After offensive and racist tweets from Gemma O\u2019Doherty we have decided to block and report her to Twitter.\n\nChildren who bite others at nursery given 'bite box' to distract them\n\n\u2018We are proud of our multicultural & diverse team and our customers. We are proud to work with, and serve, each and every one of them. Everyone is welcome in our store.\n\n\u2018We are contacting the Ryan family regarding this online abuse and will be providing support after this unprovoked attack. We thank everyone for their kind words.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter being contacted by Metro.co.uk, Garda declined to comment on the case.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
