Although it looks and feels like plastic, initial testing suggests it is stronger, safer and much more sustainable than its oil-based counterpart.\n\nIt is estimated people in the UK use 5m tonnes of plastic every year, nearly half of which is packaging. Only 51% of local authorities in England have separate food waste collections and even where recycling schemes are in place, the majority of bio and compostable plastics are not generally suited to existing waste treatment infrastructures.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The new material can replace plastic for many common uses, such as food packaging. Photograph: Dyson\n\nAn estimated 492,020 tonnes of fish waste are produced by the fish processing industry every year in the UK and it is considered a huge and inefficient waste stream with low commercial value.\n\nUnwanted offcuts include offal, blood, crustacean and shellfish exoskeletons and fish skin and scales, all of which ends up in landfill or incineration. Through research carried out on the Sussex coast, Hughes found fish skins and scales were the most promising sources for the plastic alternative, due to their flexibility and strength-enabling proteins. A single Atlantic cod could generate the organic waste needed for 1,400 bags of MarinaTex, she found.\n\n\u201cPlastic is an amazing material, and as a result we have become too reliant on it as designers and engineers,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cIt makes no sense to me that we\u2019re using plastic, an incredibly durable material, for products that have a life cycle of less than a day. For me, MarinaTex represents a commitment to material innovation and selection by incorporating sustainable, local and circular values into design. As creators, we should not limit ourselves to designing to just form and function, but rather form, function and footprint.\u201d\n\nAs this year\u2019s winner of the UK category of the James Dyson award, Hughes won \u00a32,000 for her invention. It will now be entered in the international category for the final leg of the award in November, which will give the overall worldwide winner a further \u00a330,000 in prize money, plus \u00a35,000 for the winner\u2019s university department.\n\nThe award operates in 27 countries, and is open to university students and recent graduates studying product design, industrial design and engineering. It recognises and rewards imaginative design solutions to global problems.\n\nThis year\u2019s runners-up are an AI-enabled wearable device to help monitor asthmatic symptoms and predict triggers, designed by Anna Bernbaum, of the Dyson School of Engineering, in London, and solar panels which can be draped over backpacks or tents, invented by Bradley Brister, of Brunel University London.", "description": "Award-winning material looks and feels like plastic but is stronger and can be disposed of as food waste", "authors": ["Rebecca Smithers"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49f3d4646aed90bdfb3e8ede8ab8358a401af78b/0_52_1280_768/master/1280.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b986cb1f0778016ac26dcd71544940c2", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
