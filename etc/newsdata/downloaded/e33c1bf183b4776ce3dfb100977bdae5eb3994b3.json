Congressional officials have had preliminary discussions about speaking to the whistleblower, but have not yet made arrangements to question him, a person familiar with the discussions said.\n\nPOLITICAL WAVES\n\nThe complaint and the political waves it sent through Washington were the latest chapter in a saga that began playing out six months ago.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump speaks at the Hispanic Heritage Month reception at the White House in Washington, U.S., September 27, 2019. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque\n\nIn March, Ukraine\u2019s then-prosecutor general, Yuriy Lutsenko, claimed in an interview with The Hill that Biden had pressured Ukrainian officials to fire another prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, to end an investigation into an Burisma Holdings, an energy company whose board included Biden\u2019s son Hunter.\n\nHe also alleged that Ukrainian officials had tried to meddle in the 2016 U.S. election by leaking damaging information about Trump\u2019s former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, who later became a central figure in the U.S. government\u2019s own probe of Russian election interference.\n\nIn the months that followed, Trump, Giuliani and some State Department officials embarked on an unusual \u2013 but hardly secret \u2013 effort to press Ukraine\u2019s new government to conduct its own review of those claims, an inquiry that would inevitably raise questions about one of Trump\u2019s chief political rivals and the investigation that sewed doubt about the legitimacy of his election.\n\nGiuliani acknowledged in May that he was planning to head to Ukraine to press for an investigation of the Bidens. \u201cWe\u2019re not meddling in an election, we\u2019re meddling in an investigation, which we have a right to do,\u201d he told The New York Times at the time.\n\nHe, the White House and the unnamed CIA whistleblower have since made clear that he had significant help from the U.S. government.\n\nGiuliani on Thursday posted a text message from Kurt Volker, a State Department special representative to Ukraine, on July 19 connecting him with one of Zelensky\u2019s associates.\n\nA week later, Trump himself urged Zelenskiy to call Giuliani, telling him \u201cif you could speak to him that would be great,\u201d according to a White House summary of the call.\n\nThe next day, the CIA whistleblower said, Volker and Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, visited Zelenskiy in Kiev, where they gave him advice on \u201chow to navigate the demands that the President had made.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, Trump had put on hold nearly $400 million in security aid to Ukraine.\n\nSlideshow (3 Images)\n\nThe CIA whistleblower said the order to suspend aid payments \u201chad come directly from the President\u201d and that officials were \u201cunaware of a policy rationale.\u201d The administration released the aid in September. Trump has said he did not tie the security aid to Ukraine\u2019s help in investigating Biden.\n\nThe involvement of U.S. diplomats drew immediate scrutiny from lawmakers.\n\nThree House committees subpoenaed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Friday to hand over documents about his agency\u2019s involvement.\n\n\u201cIt appears that our policy with Ukraine was effectively outsourced to a private individual pursuing the personal vendettas of the President,\u201d said Senator Bob Menendez of New Jersey, the senior Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee.", "description": "President Donald Trump pressed his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate a political foe.", "authors": ["Brad Heath", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190929&t=2&i=1435190730&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8S0AK", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
