(TSX:NEXT) (OTCQB:NSRCF) (\u201cNextSource\u201d or \u201cthe Company\u201d) would like to inform investors that a new corporate presentation is now available on its website at www.nextsourcematerials.com that contains current information on the Company's activities regarding its 100%-owned and fully permitted Molo Graphite Project in southern Madagascar.\n\n\n\nNextSource announced on September 27th the robust results of its 2019 Feasibility Study (\u201cFS\u201d), which outlines a phased development approach with Phase 1 producing 17,000 tonnes per annum (\u201ctpa\u201d) of high-quality SuperFlake\u2122 concentrate per year over the first two years of production and Phase 2 producing a total of 45,000 tpa by year three.\n\nBoth phases will utilize the Company\u2019s unique, fully modular build approach that will greatly reduce the build time and associated costs in relation to conventional mine construction and ensures that the Company maintains a first-mover competitive advantage over the competition. As reported, the capital mine cost (\u201cCAPEX\u201d) for Phase 1 will be US$21.0M with Phase 2 CAPEX being an additional US$39.1M, for a total project cost of US$60.1M.\n\nThis re-confirms that the Molo project will have one of the lowest all-in CAPEX costs versus its competitors while maintaining lowest-quartile operating costs (\u201cOPEX\u201d) and yielding optimal cashflow and return metrics with suitable flexibility to enable a rapid response to the anticipated market demand for graphite.\n\nAs previously reported to the market, the Company has an off-take agreement in place with a prominent Japanese trader, whom is a major supplier of flake graphite to Japan\u2019s largest battery processor and manufacturer of graphite anode material in lithium ion batteries (\u201cLiB\u201d) for electric vehicle applications. NextSource is currently in the process of formalizing an additional sales agreement with a leading European trader.\n\nFS TECHNICAL REPORT\n\nThe FS technical report can be accessed directly by investors on NextSource\u2019s website at this link: 2019 Molo Feasibility Study and under the Company\u2019s profile on SEDAR at www.sedar.com .\n\nPlease see \u201cMolo Feasibility Study, National Instrument 43-101 Technical Report on the Molo Graphite Project located near the village of Fotadrevo in the Province of Toliara, Madagascar Prepared by Erudite Strategies (Pty) Ltd\u201d dated May 31, 2019 for certain other details and assumptions relating to the mineral resource and reserve estimates and data verification procedures.\n\nMr. Craig Scherba, P.Geo., President and CEO of NextSource, is the qualified person who reviewed and approved the technical information provided in the corporate presentation.\n\nABOUT NEXTSOURCE MATERIALS INC.\n\nNextSource Materials Inc. is a mine development company based in Toronto, Canada, that is developing its 100%-owned Molo Graphite Project in southern Madagascar.
