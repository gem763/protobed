The point to me, we are talking about now is not whether the game will take place on Sunday, that will be a purely meteorological issue. The issue will be if it can\u2019t take place then we\u2019re really, really pressing the point that we need to have to get this game delayed 24 hours later.\u201d\n\nAnd Dodson confirmed the SRU is exploring legal options to ensure the game goes ahead.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe first and most important is that we look after the safety of the general public. The second thing is for World Rugby to just simply state that the game has to be cancelled goes against the whole sporting integrity of the tournament.\n\n\u201cWe have been preparing for this tournament now for four years, the guys have had over 100 days in camp, we\u2019ve played games already and the fourth game in this particular case is pivotal.\n\nQuick guide Scotland team to face Japan Show Hide Hogg; Seymour, Harris, Johnson, Graham; Russell,Laidlaw (capt); Dell, Brown, Nel, Gilchrist, Gray, Bradbury, Ritchie, Thomson. Replacements: McInally, Reid, Fagerson, Cummings, Wilson, G Horne, P Horne, Kinghorn\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had consistent dialogue since the last three or four days around this with senior people at World Rugby, but World Rugby seem to be determined to stick to its plan that the match is either played on Sunday or indeed it is cancelled, and to have it cancelled and have our ability to progress from this group put at peril, we believe is absolutely unacceptable.\n\n\u201cWorld Rugby is pointing us back to the participation agreement. We\u2019ve had legal opinion \u2013 from a leading QC \u2013 that challenges World Rugby\u2019s interpretation.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know that [it is too late] \u2013 we have to challenge it. But we should be talking about this from a rugby perspective, this is about the game and the rugby supporters across the world are absolutely astounded at this rigidity from World Rugby. The common sense approach to this is to play the game 24 hours later on perfect safety where we can make sure that the pool stages are completed, and the sporting integrity of the tournament remains intact.\u201d", "description": "The SRU chief executive, Mark Dodson, says he will not allow Scotland to become the World Cup\u2019s \u201ccollateral damage\u201d as he promised to fight any moves to cancel Sunday\u2019s vital match against Japan", "authors": ["Pa Media"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2750c17bbda47d1c8f80937b98c88923f0b80972/0_171_3610_2166/master/3610.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=893dd91d026b975f19f1ea4c698bd285", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
