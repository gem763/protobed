The best thing would be if there were not a single Muslim left on this earth. Then we would have reached our final goal.\"\n\nThe foundation of Hard Line is \"ethnonationalism\" and Paludan says you need at least two grandparents of Danish origins to prove you are Danish.\n\nMartin Krasnik, editor-in-chief of the Danish newspaper \"Weekendavisen\", called Paludan a Nazi in a recent editorial. He said that Paludan is \"clearly familiar with the Nuremberg laws\u201d from Nazi-era Germany.\n\nPaludan denies having any associations with Nazism.\n\nHe and his supporters are known for burning or throwing the Quran in the air. Police have spent almost \u20ac6 million on protecting Hard Line's leader during his protests this year.\n\nIn April, Paludan demonstrated in the ethnically diverse N\u00f8rrebro district of Copenhagen where large numbers of Muslims live. It caused a violent reaction and unrest that spread to several parts of the capital.\n\n\"I strongly disagree with Paludan's meaningless provocations that have no other purpose than sow disunity. Meet him with arguments - not with violence,\" Denmark's prime minister, Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen, wrote on Twitter.\n\nHowever, journalists have found it difficult to argue with Paludan, who recently claimed on air that there are 700,000 Muslims in Denmark.\n\nThere are no official figures but experts estimate there to be 320,000.\n\nDanish media has been under fire for giving Paludan a platform to promote his agenda and Paludan's protest and many interviews have once again ignited the heated debate about freedom of speech in Denmark.\n\n\u201cPaludan is acting much like Trump, he is pointing fingers at the establishment and the media and often lies. But his voters do not care\u201d, said Hansen. \u201cDespite the rise of Hard Line, right-wing populism has weakened a lot in this election.\u201d\n\nThe opposition \u201cred bloc\u201d is forecast to win the general election, which would make the leader of The Social Democrats, Mette Frederiksen, prime minister.\n\nTheir bloc is estimated to gain more than 50% of the vote after the Social Democrats adopted a stricter migration policy, which has helped them to win back left-leaning anti-immigration voters who had previously abandoned them for right-wing parties.\n\n\u201cThe right-wing parties will get fewer votes this time and the government will most likely be based on the Social Democrats, which means that a party like Hard Line will be alienated on the far-right and probably they will not have much to say in the coming term and law-making process\u201d, Hansen said.", "description": "Convicted of racism, accused of Nazi ties, known for burnings of the Quran... and about to become a Danish MP?", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/03/92/48/70/1000x563_cmsv2_8145ad39-57a3-5bd0-9ea2-7f199ef3d810-3924870.jpg", "published_at": "2019-05-30"}
