Courtesy of Lori Wood\n\n\u201cJonathan was very sick, but he wasn\u2019t eligible for a transplant because he didn\u2019t have a support system,\u201d Wood, 57, told TODAY Health. \"One of the requirements is that you have someone to care for you afterwards.\"\n\nTrending stories,celebrity news and all the best of TODAY.

It was a no-brainer,\" Wood revealed. \"He would have died without the transplant.\"\n\nThough Wood \u201cdidn\u2019t know a thing\u201d about Pinkard when he moved in, the two bonded quickly over football and \"Family Feud\".\n\n\u201cJonathan has his chair, and I have my chair,\u201d Wood said. \u201cWe like game shows and high five back and forth if we get an answer right. He is very loving.\"\n\nLori Wood, seen here with Jonathan, was honored by Piedmont Healthcare for making a positive difference. Courtesy of Piedmont Healthcare\n\nPinkard calls Wood, \u201cMama.\" She monitors his medications \u2014 he takes 34 pills a day \u2014 and shuttles him to doctors appointments. Wood is also helping Pinkard to improve his credit score and teaching him the life skills he needs to live independently.\n\n\u201cShe treats me like one of her sons,\u201d Pinkard told TODAY Health. \u201cI am truly thank for that.\u201d\n\nPinkard, who had his heart transplant in August, hopes to return work as an office clerk in December. Wood will miss pulling into the driveway and seeing Pinkard waving on the front porch.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a joy having Jonathan here with us,\u201d Wood said. \u201cI knew this is what I was supposed to do.\"", "description": "Lori Woods, a nurse in Georgia, adopted Jonathan Pinkard, who has autism, so that he could have a heart transplant.", "authors": ["Rachel Paula Abrahamson"], "top_image": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2019_44/1500670/nurse-adopts-man-with-autism-today-main-191030_cad59b33a649d783e7a1d121b4f07dfd.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
