They wouldn\u2019t even need a battery pack. A patient\u2019s own body movements would power the device. And such a system may not be that far off. Researchers have already produced a working prototype.\n\n\u201cWe thought it might work, but we didn\u2019t know how good it would be,\u201d says Xudong Wang. \u201cThen we saw the result and thought, \u2018Wow! That\u2019s really fascinating.\u201d Wang is a materials scientist at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison. He leads the group working on this new bandage.\n\nHis team has been developing a nanogenerator for many years. It uses body movements to generate electricity. These engineers were hoping to use the device to power wearable electronics. Then they realized it might be even more useful as medicine.\n\nMaterials scientist Xudong Wang (left) displays a prototype of the bandage. Graduate student Yin Long (middle) and Hao Wei (right) also worked on the project. Sam Million-Weaver/Univ. of Wisconsin\u2013Madison\n\nScientists have known for decades that electricity can stimulate wounds to heal. For instance, electricity fosters cells on the skin\u2019s surface to grow. This \u201celectrotherapy\u201d has relied on bulky devices that need a power source. That\u2019s why it\u2019s usually used only in hospitals for treating serious injuries.\n\nThe Wisconsin engineers have now created a bandage with small electrodes. \u201cOur device is very simple,\u201d Wang says. \u201cIt\u2019s a flexible, wearable device.\u201d Its electrodes connect to nanogenerators inside the bandage. Those nanogenerators turn movement into electricity. That power then travels through the electrodes into the skin as mild electrical pulses.\n\nWang\u2019s group tested the bandage on more than 10 injured rats. As these \u201cpatients\u201d breathed in and out, their wounds received tiny electrical shocks. Another group of injured rats served as controls. That means they received no treatment.\n\nThe wounds of rats in the control group took about two weeks to heal. Those on rats treated with the electrified bandages healed in just three days.\n\nWang\u2019s team described its new findings online November 29, 2018 in the journal ACS Nano.\n\nNo pain, big gain\n\nThe new bandage not only is simple, flexible and wearable, but also gentle. Compared to the electrical stimulation delivered by hospital machines, these bandage gives a much smaller electrical pulse. That should help protect healthy tissue from being damaged by the zaps. In fact, Wang says: \u201cUsually, you don\u2019t even feel it.\u201d\n\nThis is \u201ca good first step toward an interesting and potentially promising approach to wound care,\u201d says Tyler Ray. He says you might think of it as a \u201csmart Band-Aid.\u201d Ray is a mechanical engineer at the University of Hawaii at Manoa who had no role in creating the new system. He said he\u2019d like to see the bandage tested on larger animals or people, and lots of them.\n\nWearable technology has been around for several years. Usually these are fairly stiff devices, like a Fitbit, Ray notes. Researchers across many fields are now working on building soft, flexible devices for people to wear on their skin.\n\nWang next wants to design a nanogenerator that\u2019s even more sensitive. His goal is to build one that can generate electricity from the tiniest movements \u2014 like blood moving under your skin. That way, the bandage could be powered by something as small as someone\u2019s pulse.", "description": "Scientists have invented a bandage that helps wounds heal faster by zapping them with electricity.
