But during this two-day period, MPs - not the government - will have the opportunity to reject the EU's date.\n\nOn Thursday, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn promised to push his MPs to vote for a general election as soon as a Brexit delay is implemented.\n\nHe said: \"We will be taking parliamentary action on this again next week to ensure that the prime minister does not crash us out of the EU on October 31 without a deal.\"\n\n'Defiance of Parliament'\n\nMeanwhile, Rachel Johnson, the prime minister's sister, told BBC Radio 4's World at One that her brother was using the Commons as a \"bully pulpit\".\n\nMs Johnson, who stood for pro-European party Change UK - which has since altered its name to The Independent Group for Change - in June's European elections, added: \"It's not the brother I see at home. It's a different person.\"\n\nElsewhere, former Conservative prime minister Sir John Major has criticised Mr Johnson and warned that a \"general election would solve nothing\" in the Brexit crisis.\n\nMr Johnson has been calling for an early general election, but under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act he needs the support of two-thirds of MPs. He has twice failed to achieve this.\n\nSpeaking to the Centre for European Reform, Sir John said an election \"would merely fuel the current feeling of disillusionment and disunity\".\n\nHe also said he feared the government would seek to bypass the Benn Act, by suspending it until after 31 October when the UK is set to leave the EU.\n\nHe said he thinks they will do this by trying to pass an Order of Council, which can be approved by Privy Councillors - government ministers - without involving the Queen.\n\n\"I should warn the prime minister that - if this route is taken - it will be in flagrant defiance of Parliament and utterly disrespectful to the Supreme Court,\" he said.", "description": "The prime minister says he deplores threats to MPs, adding that \"tempers need to come down\" in Parliament.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07pdfbk.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
