The Seoul Central District Prosecutors\u2019 Office, the Gwangju High Prosecutors\u2019 Office and the Daegu High Prosecutors\u2019 Office were likewise advised to get rid of their intelligence departments.It was suggested that those currently working in the groups be transferred to criminal departments or public security departments.One official who works at an intelligence office within the prosecution told the JoongAng Ilbo Monday that the reform committee\u2019s latest recommendation was basically telling prosecutors not to investigate any suspicious cases unless a formal complaint has been filed with them.\u201cThe government tied the prosecution\u2019s arms and legs by forcing it to shut down its special investigation departments, and now it\u2019s trying to blindfold our eyes by telling us to shut down our intelligence-gathering groups,\u201d said the source.Early this month, President Moon Jae-in ordered Prosecutor General Yoon Seok-youl to swiftly present a plan to reform the state prosecution agency, saying he was supportive of then-Justice Minister Cho Kuk\u2019s plan to overhaul the prosecution.Cho, who resigned on Oct. 14, essentially wanted to strengthen the criminal and litigation departments, which was seen as a de facto measure to weaken the prosecution\u2019s elite special investigation unit that handles high-profile cases such as the ongoing probe into his family.A day after Moon\u2019s order, Yoon announced he would shut down all special investigation departments except for three, including the unit at the Seoul Central District Prosecutors\u2019 Office that is probing the Cho family.Another senior prosecutor in Seoul said if the prosecution demolishes its intelligence-gathering units, prosecutors will be deprived of their chance to figure out early on corruption cases linked to high-level government officials and the fraudulent acts of companies that harm the market economy, which, in turn, will enable those law-breakers to get away more easily.A third prosecutor who works in Seoul said the prosecution has already \u201crooted out\u201d the practice of collecting so-called trend reports on high-profile figures under the helm of former Prosecutor General Moon Moo-il, suggesting that further measures to curb prosecutors\u2019 intelligence-gathering won\u2019t be helpful to the organization.\u201cIt\u2019s like [the government] is rolling out recommendations without even knowing the prosecution\u2019s current intelligence-gathering functions,\u201d he lamented.BY KIM KI-JEONG, YOUN SANG-UN [lee.sungeun@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://static.joins.com/joongang_15re/profile_koreajoongangdaily_200.png", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
