(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nOpinions editor\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), like many senior House Democrats, has for months expressed skepticism about starting impeachment hearings against President Trump. But in the wake of the revelations about Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Schiff seems to have changed his mind. As he told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on Sunday:\n\nWell, Jake ... if the president is essentially withholding military aid, at the same time that he is trying to browbeat a foreign leader into doing something illicit, that is, providing dirt on his opponent during a presidential campaign, then that may be the only remedy that is co-equal to the evil that that conduct represents.\n\nThat Schiff finally realizes impeachment \u201cmay be the only remedy\u201d is a relief. If only House Democratic leaders, including Speaker Nancy Pelosi (Calif.), would realize this as well.\n\nThe president himself has admitted he discussed investigating former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter with Zelensky. We know that Ukraine\u2019s former top prosecutor was in fact fired because of his well-documented corruption, not \u2014 as Trump would have us believe \u2014 because of any investigation into Hunter Biden. We know that starting in August, the Trump administration engaged in an \u201cunprecedented struggle\u201d with Congress, as The Post\u2019s Karoun Demirjian put it, to withhold $250 million in military aid to Ukraine, before mysteriously releasing the hold in mid-September. We know that the White House is refusing to release a whistleblower complaint about the call, in direct violation of the law. Add this to the pile of evidence that the president\u2019s associates colluded with Russia and that the president obstructed justice to hide that, with only Justice Department precedent shielding him from charges.\n\nAnd we know that the president\u2019s staff has no defense save conspiracy theory. On \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d Secretary of State Mike Pompeo refused to even answer whether a president tying foreign aid to a political favor would be wrong. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, appearing on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of Union\u201d supposedly to defend the president, repeatedly deflected questions with the excuse \u201cI wasn\u2019t on the call.\u201d The conspiracizing came from Trump\u2019s wild-eyed personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani; he claimed on Fox that \u201cthis town protects Joe Biden\u201d and \u201cthe press has been covering up\u201d for the former vice president, without a shred of evidence beyond innuendo.\n\nRank-and-file Democratic representatives like such as Steve Cohen (Tenn.) and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (N.Y.), as well as the party\u2019s presidential candidates, recognize that impeachment hearings are overdue. Yet House Democratic leaders remain passive. There are no GOP votes for it, goes one excuse. By that standard, Democrats might as well never do anything at all. House Democrats have passed dozens of bills that will never make it through the GOP Senate \u2014 bills such as the Paycheck Fairness Act and the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act. Pelosi and allies backed those bills expecting that Republicans would not vote for them; there\u2019s no reason the same can\u2019t be true of impeachment. Hearings will get those \u201cno\u201d votes on the record for posterity.\n\n\u201cVoters don\u2019t support impeachment,\u201d goes another excuse. But that was true during Watergate as well, especially before the hearings. As I wrote earlier this year, less than a third of Americans thought the break-in a serious scandal before the televised Watergate hearings began in 1973. Democrats held hearings before a majority of Americans wanted them, and pushed for impeachment before a majority of Americans supported it. They were vindicated both by the public soon after and by history since.\n\nEven if voters remain skeptical of impeachment, Democrats should proceed, not because it would be popular, but because it\u2019s right. Inaction only emboldens the president\u2019s assault on the American democratic system. Consider this paragraph from The Post\u2019s latest Ukraine story:\n\nTrump\u2019s sense of himself as above the law has been reinforced throughout his time in office. As detailed in the Mueller report, he received help from a foreign adversary in 2016 without legal consequence. He sought to thwart the Russia investigation and possibly obstruct justice without consequence. Through the government, he has earned profits for his businesses without consequence. He has blocked Congress\u2019s ability to conduct oversight without consequence.\n\nThis is bigger than politics. It\u2019s about upholding the Constitution and the rule of law. \u201cWithout consequence\u201d sums up too much of recent American history, as the powerful flout the law and face at most a slap on the wrist. The torturers under the Bush administration. The bankers who broke the economy. The opioid manufacturers who fueled millions\u2019 addictions. And now the ultimate example: A president whose list of high crimes and misdemeanors gets longer by the week.\n\nStart the hearings. Put the fear of God in this president. In the meantime, as my colleague Karen Tumulty suggests, the House can censure Trump. The public evidence is certainly sufficient to prove that this man has disgraced the presidency. Trump may claim he doesn\u2019t care; he may even say he\u2019ll be proud if Democrats censure him. But the egotist who flips out over mean tweets will see public censure as a consequence.\n\nDo not be afraid, Democrats. Do not cower before public opinion. Do not let another powerful man get away with misdeeds. Make Trump face consequences. Begin impeachment hearings now.\n\nRead more:\n\nKaren Tumulty: Yes, there is something the House can do to punish Trump right now\n\nThe Post\u2019s View: What did Trump tell Ukraine\u2019s president?\n\nGeorge T.
