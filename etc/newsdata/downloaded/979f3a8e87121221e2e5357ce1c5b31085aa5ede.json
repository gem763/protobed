Manhattan investigators are looking into whether Giuliani violated lobbying laws that protect the U.S. government from covert foreign influence, sources told the Times.\n\nCNN and Bloomberg reported Thursday that federal prosecutors were also examining Giuliani\u2019s financial dealings with associates Igor Fruman and Lev Parnas, who were arrested Thursday on charges that they secretly funneled Russian money to groups that support Trump and other GOP candidates.\n\nMarie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, testified before House impeachment investigators Friday that she was \u201cincredulous\u201d when she was \u201cabruptly\u201d recalled from her post in May. Trump had pressed for her ouster for months as Yovanovitch was accused of disloyalty, which was categorically untrue, according to her prepared statement obtained by The Washington Post.\n\n\u201cAs best as I can tell,\u201d the \u201cunfounded and false claims\u201d were pressed by \u201cpeople with clearly questionable motives,\u201d Yovanovitch said in her statement.\n\n\u201cI do not know Mr. Giuliani\u2019s motives for attacking me,\u201d she told lawmakers. \u201cBut individuals who have been named in the press as contacts of Mr. Giuliani may well have believed that their personal financial ambitions were stymied by our anti-corruption policy in Ukraine.\u201d\n\nTrump referred to Yovanovitch in his controversial phone call in July with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, which has revealed in a whistleblower complaint and has become the focus of an impeachment inquiry. He called her \u201cbad news\u201d and said that Yovanovitch \u201cis going to go through some things.\u201d\n\nTrump pressed Zelensky in the July 25 call to launch an investigation into his political rival Joe Biden and Biden\u2019s son \u2014 while the White House was withholding military aid to Ukraine.\n\nGiuliani has admitted that he, Fruman and Parnas were out to gather damaging information about Yovanovitch and other Trump targets.\n\nFederal law requires U.S. citizens to disclose to the Justice Department contacts with the American government or media at the direction of foreign government officials or politicians. Giuliani has insisted the law does not apply to his activities because he was working on behalf of Trump, not for foreign officials.", "description": "Prosecutors are looking into whether Giuliani violated lobbying laws that protect the government from covert foreign influence, The New York Times reported.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da146ee200000d4065000f1.jpeg?cache=wbvfyywcqw&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
