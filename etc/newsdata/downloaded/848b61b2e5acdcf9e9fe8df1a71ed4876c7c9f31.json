At the heart of the controversy is a July 25 phone call Trump had with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during which Trump repeatedly pressured Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden \u2014 and possibly using military aid as a bargaining chip.\n\nThe impeachment inquiry began after an explosive whistleblower complaint filed by an anonymous intelligence community official in August claimed Trump was \"using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election\" in the call with Zelensky \u2014 just days after the White House withheld a $400 million military aid package from Ukraine.\n\nA memo released by the White House summarizing the call showed that after telling Zelensky that \"we do a lot\" for Ukraine, Trump asked him for \"a favor, though,\" by investigating both Hunter Biden's business dealings and CrowdStrike, the cybersecurity firm once hired by the Democratic National Committee.\n\nThe complaint mentions Sondland as well as Kurt Volker, the former US special representative to Ukraine, as being involved in the matter. This was confirmed when Congress released text messages between Volker, Sondland, and the US's charg\u00e9 d'affaires in Ukraine, Bill Taylor, last week.\n\nIn one exchange that took place on July 21, Taylor texted Sondland saying Zelensky was \"sensitive about Ukraine being taken seriously, not merely an instrument in Washington domestic, reelection politics.\"\n\nSondland replied: \"Absolutely, but we need to get the conversation started and the relationship built, irrespective of the pretext. I am worried about the alternative.\"\n\nTaylor wrote to Sondland in a September 1 exchange, \"Are we now saying that security assistance and [White House] meeting are conditioned on investigations?\"\n\nLater, on September 9, Taylor wrote in a text message dated at 12:47 a.m., \"As I said on the phone, I think it's crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\"\n\nSondland responded five hours later, at 5:19 a.m.: \"Bill, I believe you are incorrect about President Trump's intentions. The president has been crystal clear no quid pro quo's of any kind.\"\n\n\"The president is trying to evaluate whether Ukraine is truly going to adopt the transparency and reforms that President Zelensky promised during his campaign,\" Sondland added. \"I suggest we stop the back and forth by text. If you still have concerns, I recommend you give Lisa Kennna or S a call.\"\n\nRead more: Newly revealed text messages show Trump diplomats' internal turmoil over his pressure on Ukraine\n\nThe texts indicate that the diplomat's conversations weren't limited to text messages \u2014 making Sondland's testimony even more important to fill in the gaps.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal also reported that Sondland spoke with Trump on the phone at some point in the five hours before he responded to Taylor.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo \u2014 Trump's most trusted official on foreign policy \u2014 was on the Trump-Zelensky call. Even before the State Department blocked Sondland's testimony, Pompeo was already accused of obstructing the congressional investigation into the matter.\n\nIn September, Pompeo sent a letter to the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs, and Oversight committees, telling them their requests to depose department officials connected to the whistleblower's complaint were \"not feasible\" and \"do not provide adequate time for the Department and its employees to prepare\" for testimony.\n\nIn turn, Democratic lawmakers accused Pompeo of \"intimidating Department witnesses\" from testifying and warned that it \"will constitute evidence of obstruction of the impeachment inquiry.\"\n\nIn a Tuesday-morning press conference, the House Intelligence Committee's chairman, Rep. Adam Schiff of California, said Sondland had additional documents and communications the State Department was withholding from Congress.\n\n\"The failure to produce this witness and the failure to produce those documents we consider strong evidence of obstruction of the constitutional functions of Congress,\" Schiff said.", "description": "Sondland's attorney released a statement saying the State Department had \"directed\" Sondland to skip his voluntary, scheduled testimony.", "authors": ["Sonam Sheth", "Grace Panetta"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d976630880f260f374bf27d?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
