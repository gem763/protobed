Nor does baking a cake for a gay wedding require you to have intimate contact with the client. Taking another example, there is no material difference in renting a room to a gay couple or to a straight couple, and renting out rooms does not require intimate contact with the client. In contrast, in the case of genital waxing, I have found there is a material difference in waxing different types of genitals and that, because of its intimate nature, service providers must consent to provide service on a particular type of genitals. What the law requires is that, having chosen to provide a particular service, they must provide that service without discrimination. For example, a person who customarily waxes vulvas cannot discriminate amongst their clients with vulvas, and likewise for a person who customarily waxes scrotums. However, human rights legislation does not require a service provider to wax a type of genitals they are not trained for and have not consented to wax.\n\nCousineau repeatedly defended Yaniv\u2019s claim that he is a woman and protected by pro-transgender legislation, amid plentiful evidence to the existence of Yaniv\u2019s testicles:\n\nI accept that Ms. Yaniv is partly motivated by her desire to fight what she perceives as pervasive discrimination against transgender women in the beauty industry. In that sense, her motives do align with Code\u2019s purposes of eradicating discrimination and providing victims of discrimination with a means of redress. Further, if not for this application, I would likely have concluded that at least one of Ms. Yaniv\u2019s complaints about arm and leg waxing was justified.\n\nThroughout the controversy, Yaniv has insisted he is a woman, even to the point of claiming that he suffers from period pains.\n\nBlehhhhh can\u2019t sleep these cramps are awful. #pms where did I put my @midol \ud83d\ude29 pic.twitter.com/ppCS8mXkVk \u2014 Jessica Yaniv (@trustednerd) October 21, 2019\n\nCousineau echoed the transgender ideology by repeatedly downplaying the biology-based cultural preferences between men and women. For example, she reduced them from cultural differences to a crude biological distinction by describing a woman as \u201ca person with a vulva\u201d and a man as \u201ca person with a penis and scrotum.\u201d\n\nBut Yaniv engaged in bad faith, and so undermined the political standing of Canada\u2019s pro-transgender policies, said Cousineau:\n\nMs. Yaniv\u2019s overriding purpose was to manufacture the conditions for human rights complaints against unsophisticated and vulnerable respondents, in order to secure a financial settlement and punish individuals involved. In a majority of her cases, she also had the added motivation of punishing racialized and immigrant women whom she stereotypes as hostile to the interests of the LGBTQ+ community. Far from advancing the cause of LGBTQ+ people, Ms. Yaniv\u2019s conduct would, if condoned, threaten this Tribunal\u2019s integrity and its mission to foster an equitable, tolerant, and respectful society.\n\nTo protect the pro-transgender law, Cousineau ordered Yaniv to pay a token penalty of $2,000 to each of the three plaintiffs despite many months of trauma and stress for the three immigrant women:\n\nIn all the circumstances I am satisfied that $6,000 strikes the right balance in expressing the Tribunal\u2019s condemnation of Ms. Yaniv\u2019s conduct while not exacting too harsh a punishment on her. In the circumstances, although Ms. Yaniv\u2019s conduct has likely impacted all of the Respondents to her complaints, I can only issue this order against those Represented Respondents who attended the hearing and advanced this application. I order Ms. Yaniv to pay $2,000 to each of Ms. Benipal, Ms. DaSilva, and Mrs. Hehar.\n\nThe official said the penalty was kept low out of sympathy for Yaniv, despite his harassment of the women:\n\nOther factors weigh in favour of a lower award. Ms. Yaniv has already faced serious consequences as a result of these complaints. Once her identity and role in these complaints was revealed, she faced a torrent of backlash and hatred, and from that point onward was representing herself in very difficult circumstances. \u2026 Finally, I must note that Ms. Yaniv was polite and deferential throughout the Tribunal\u2019s hearings.\n\nOpponents of the transgender ideology celebrated the win:", "description": "A Canadian official ruled against Jessica Yaniv, a transgender plaintiff who claimed discrimination when women refused to give him a \"Brazilian wax.\"", "authors": ["Neil Munro"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/07/transgender-activist-Jessica-Yaniv-1-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
