However, instead of providing, say, personalized trivia or behind-the-scenes facts, Lennon just goofed and goofed hard with his voiceover, delivering joke after joke, each more irreverent than the last. If you loved it, please enjoy this list of Lennon\u2019s most sideways goofs from the telecast. If you hated it, hey, the Oscars are just around the corner. And if you\u2019re Thomas Lennon, wow, those writers gave you a goddamn workout, didn\u2019t they?\n\nOn Alex Bornstein, Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series for The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel: \u201cThey will be setting cars on fire and burning a Wicker Man as Deerfield, Illinois\u2019 beloved daughter pockets another 39 millimeters of fake Emmy gold.\u201d\n\nOn Bill Hader, Outstanding Comedy Actor for Barry: \u201cThird win, 20th nomination for Bill Hader.

Bottles of sweat.\u201d\n\nOn Bandersnatch (Black Mirror), Outstanding Television Movie: \u201cI was 100 percent wrong about this one. Check my Twitter.

I was wrong and I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\nOn Peter Dinklage, Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama for Game of Thrones: \u201cThey\u2019ll be sliding down the bannisters for Tyrion Lannister at Bennington College tonight as Dinklage goes double cufflinks with four Emmys, for 24 pounds of solid Emmy gold.\u201d\n\nOn Jesse Armstrong, writer of Succession\u2019s \u201cNobody is Ever Missing,\u201d for Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series: \u201cSuccession is loosely based on the Murdoch family, the same Murdoch family that has ordered me to sit here and tell jokes, and it\u2019s a real pleasure, an absolute pleasure and I want to thank them. I hope my family\u2019s alright.\u201d\n\nThrowing to commercial ahead of the Outstanding Variety Talk Series award: \u201cStick around to see if history is made with the first female or black winner for Variety Talk.
