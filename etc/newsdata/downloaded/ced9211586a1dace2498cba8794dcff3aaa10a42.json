But that\u2019s not the story being put forward today, unfortunately.\"\n\nA tribunal earlier this year found the consultant building surveyor, fire engineer and architect bore more liability for the use of combustible cladding on Melbourne's Lacrosse Tower than the builder. Wayne Taylor\n\nThe government's official announcement, in which Mr Wynne talked about \"saving owners the time, hassle and expense of chasing dodgy builders through the courts\", was a disappointing step away from the all-of-industry solution spoken about over the past few months, Ms Casson said.\n\n\"We have talked a lot about our members not walking away from their response,\" she said.\n\n\"But to be fair we do need to look at the whole supply chain, as well as agencies that have overseen the approval of projects and buildings as well.\"\n\nWhile the circumstance around every cladding-affected building was different, a VCAT judgment earlier over the installation of flammable cladding on Melbourne's Lacrosse residential tower that overwhelmingly put liability on the fire engineer, building surveyor and architect ahead of the builder showed the matter was not as clear-cut as the government was making it out to be, Ms Casson said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"There\u2019s major evidence that showed it\u2019s a much bigger issue than just builders alone,\" she said.\n\nThe Lacrosse judgment is being appealed.\n\nMs Casson said she had not seen details of the proposed new legislation or the scope it gave the state government to hit builders with retrospective liabilities and could not comment. But she said she supported the need to claw back costs from builders who had done the wrong thing.\n\nDan O'Brien, head of new agency Cladding Safety Victoria, which will oversee the rectification program, in August said the number of private residential buildings deemed \"high risk\", those in the category deemed in need of public funds to rectify, would \"certainly\" rise over 500.", "description": "The building industry has slammed the government for a 'misleading and unfair' focus on construction players alone.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.7334%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_26/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/e0a50f31cdbfd92481e24b36623e11d400b56d3c", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
