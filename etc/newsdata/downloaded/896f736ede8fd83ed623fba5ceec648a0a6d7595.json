Daniel Montsion, who has pleaded not guilty to manslaughter, aggravated assault and assault with a weapon in Abdi's death.\n\nThe Crown alleges the punches Montsion landed on Abdi's head on July 24, 2016, contributed to the Ottawa man's fatal heart attack.\n\nMatthew Rousselle, an advanced care paramedic, was off duty that morning when he stopped by the Bridgehead on Wellington Street W. to grab a coffee. Inside, he noticed people gathered around a woman who was crying.\n\nA 'mob mentality'\n\nRousselle testified that before he could order his drink, he heard someone yell, \"He grabbed another woman!\" and saw a group of about eight men charge outside. In his statement to the Special Investigations Unit, Rousselle later described the men as behaving with a \"mob mentality.\"\n\nRousselle initially testified he saw some of the men punch Abdi in the head and chest, and said he ran outside and pulled one man off Abdi and escort the customer back inside.\n\nUnder cross-examination, Rousselle later acknowledged the men may have pushed Abdi, not punched him.\n\nConst. Daniel Montsion, right, is on trial for manslaughter, aggravated assault and assault with a weapon in the 2016 death of 37-year-old Abdirahman Abdi, left. (Supplied)\n\nRousselle testified that Abdi was sweating \"more than he probably should have been,\" and was breathing heavily. He said he'd seen Abdi at the coffee shop two weeks to a month earlier, and didn't notice him sweating at that time.\n\nAbdi didn't seem injured after the confrontation outside the coffee shop, Rousselle said.\n\nMontsion's lawyers called Rousselle to \"offer further insight into Mr. Abdi's medical condition before he ever encountered our client or Const. Weir,\" defence counsel Solomon Friedman said in his opening statement Wednesday.\n\n'Homicide by heart attack'\n\nShortly after that incident, Const. Dave Weir arrived and attempted to arrest Abdi, but Abdi fled toward his apartment building at 55 Hilda St. with Weir in pursuit. That's where Montsion joined the altercation and punched Abdi twice in the head.\n\nMontsion punched Abdi twice more in the head after the officers wrestled the man to the ground, where they managed to get him into handcuffs.\n\nAbdi ultimately died of a heart attack, according to pathologist Christopher Milroy. During his testimony, Milroy explained that the heart attack may have been caused by the adrenaline, pain and fear he experienced during his arrest.\n\nMilroy called it \"homicide by heart attack.\"\n\nBut Milroy also said it's difficult to separate what happened during the arrest from the events that took place immediately before.\n\nAbdirahman Abdi's arrest was captured by the surveillance camera inside his apartment building at 55 Hilda St. He was pronounced dead the following day. (Ontario Criminal Court)\n\nExcited delirium\n\nThe defence alleges Abdi was suffering from excited delirium before officers arrived on scene.\n\nThat controversial diagnosis refers to a group of symptoms associated with extreme mental and physiological excitement, but is not recognized as a syndrome in the medical community, according to the International Journal of Law and Psychiatry.\n\nAn autopsy revealed Abdi also had a pre-existing heart condition.\n\nCrown attorney Philip Perlmutter suggested it wouldn't be unusual for someone to be sweating or breathing heavily when confronted by an angry mob.\n\nRousselle is the only eyewitness the defence intends to call, according to their opening statement.\n\nMonstion's lawyers also plan to recall forensic video expert Grant Fredericks to continue his testimony about the key video evidence of the altercation between Abdi and police. Fredericks believes the video isn't reliable when it comes to interpreting the speed of the action on screen or the force used by the officers.", "description": "Customers who intervened to stop\u00a0Abdirahman Abdi\u00a0from assaulting women outside a Hintonburg coffee shop punched him several times in the head and chest before his violent arrest by Ottawa police officers, a witness told court Wednesday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.3709379.1470424685!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/bridgehead-hintonburg-coffee-shop-abdirahman-abdi.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
