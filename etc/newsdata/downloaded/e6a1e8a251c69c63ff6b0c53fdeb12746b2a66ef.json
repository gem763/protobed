Here's how lower interest rates affect credit card, mortgage and savings rates", "language": "en", "text": "These Fed interest rate cuts are starting to add up, lowering costs for many Americans who use credit cards or take out loans while squeezing savers.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is set to lower its benchmark interest rate Wednesday by a quarter percentage point for the third time in the past three months. The move is expected to further trim borrowing costs on credit cards, home equity lines, adjustable-rate mortgages and auto loans.\n\nThe latest reduction, to a range of 1.5% to 1.75%, would undo just a third of the Fed\u2019s nine rate hikes from late 2015 through last year. But the rate-slicing campaign is starting to make a difference.\n\n\u201cThe cumulative effect is growing,\u201d says Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com.\n\nAnd while falling rates aid borrowers, they also nudge down bank savings rates that had just started providing decent yields after years of paltry returns. That's frustrating to seniors and others on fixed incomes.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re trying to stimulate the economy but it\u2019s kind of like a tax on savers,\u201d says Richard Harrington, senior financial analyst at MoneyRates.com, a banking and consumer financial site owned by QuinStreet.\n\nBarrington also questions whether the Fed\u2019s wary economic outlook and rate cuts will prod some banks to pull back lending, making it tougher for lower-income, higher-risk borrowers to obtain loans or ultimately pushing up rates for those households.\n\nGood news for homebuyers: US home prices rise in August but cool in major markets, a potential boon to buyers\n\nRates for home equity lines of credit have been falling. More\n\nA look at how a Fed cut could affect these products:\n\nCredit cards\n\nCredit card rates are generally tied to the prime rate, which in turn is affected by the Fed's benchmark rate. While the rate eventually should drop by about a quarter percentage point, it likely will take two to three months, McBride says.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s prior two rate cuts since July have pushed down average credit card rates to 17.57% from 17.85%, Bankrate says, lowering the minimum payment on a $5,000 credit card balance by $1 to $2 a month. Another quarter-point drop would trim the payment by an additional $1 a month, still offsetting just a small part of the $9 in increases already enacted.\n\nHome equity lines\n\nMost home equity lines of credit, or HELOCs, also track the prime rate. The two prior Fed cuts since July lowered the average HELOC rate from 6.73% to 6.23%, shaving the monthly payment on a $30,000 home equity line of credit by $12.50, according to Bankrate.\n\nA third reduction Wednesday, which should show up in HELOC rates in a month or two, would pare rates by another quarter point, or $6.25, bringing the total savings from the three Fed moves to nearly $20, McBride says. Although the monthly payment is still $37 higher than before the Fed began hiking rates in 2015, the recent savings are starting to add up.\n\n\u201cToday's Fed rate cut will soon make it less expensive to fix up your home as sellers prepare for the 2020 home buying season,\u201d says NerdWallet analyst Holden Lewis.\n\nAdjustable-rate mortgages\n\nUnlike credit cards and HELOCs, rates on adjustable-rate mortgages are modified annually. So the impact of the Fed's rate cut, and any more on the horizon, may hit all at once at your next scheduled loan adjustment \u2013 which is what happened when rates were rising.\n\nA percentage-point cut in the Fed\u2019s key short-term rate over 12 months \u2013 assuming the Fed lowers rates again within months \u2013 likely would reduce adjustable-rate mortgage rates by a half percentage point because they\u2019re also affected by other factors. It would reduce the monthly payment on a $200,000 mortgage by $56, says Tendayi Kapfidze, chief economist at LendingTree.\n\nLove that chicken: Popeyes announces return date of its chicken sandwich and takes a dig at Chick-fil-A\n\nStory continues", "description": "A third Fed rate cut since July would shave borrowing costs on credit cards, home equity lines and other debt.
