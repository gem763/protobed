Seven deaths have been reported, the latest on Monday in California\u2019s Tulare County.\n\nPublic health officials aren't sure what's causing the breathing issues, vomiting and other symptoms, but in California they say most patients reported purchasing vapes from pop-up shops or other illegal sellers that are a pipeline for counterfeit products.\n\nTRUMP TAKES AIM AT TEEN VAPING, PROPOSES BAN ON NON-TOBACCO FLAVORED E-CIGARETTES\n\nHere's how it works: Bootleggers eager to profit off unsuspecting consumers are mimicking popular, legal vape brands, pairing replica packaging churned out in Chinese factories with untested, possibly dangerous cannabis oil produced in the state\u2019s vast underground market. The authentic-looking cartridges are sold by unlicensed dispensaries and delivery services, along with rogue websites.\n\nThe problem has gotten so pervasive that a major legal brand, Kingpen, is investing millions of dollars to redesign its packaging and product security, AP has learned.\n\nThe distributor for another major brand, Heavy Hitters, devotes a section of its website to report phonies and has hired a former federal prosecutor, Priya Sopori, to help the company deal with counterfeiting.\n\n\u201cThe danger presented by counterfeit products is just a natural result of not having the money, the resources or the people power to enforce licensing,\u201d Sopori said. \u201cSomeone is buying this packaging, buying these cartridges and filling them with whatever. It\u2019s being sold as our brand.\u201d\n\nAs marijuana has gone mainstream, versions of e-cigarettes that vaporize high-inducing cannabis oil are one of the hottest-selling items, popular for those who don\u2019t want the smoke that comes from lighting up a joint. In addition to quickly delivering a high, there\u2019s a perception -- not supported by science -- that vaping is a healthier alternative to smoking.\n\nIn California\u2019s legal market, the world\u2019s largest, the state requires cannabis oil to be tested before being placed on the shelf for sale. For example, safety checks are made for the presence of 66 pesticides, mercury, lead and other heavy metals, and 21 solvents that could be used in the extraction process, when oil is pulled from cannabis.\n\nBut it can be hard for consumers to tell whether a product they\u2019re buying is made by a legitimate company. The phony packaging is convincing to the untrained eye, some even carrying bogus labels that appear to carry state-required test results. Most consumers probably wouldn\u2019t know the difference \u2014 until they vape it. The taste and THC level could be significantly different from the authentic product.\n\nTo add to the confusion, consumers can have trouble distinguishing legal dispensaries from unlicensed shops, which in Los Angeles sometimes operate in the same neighborhoods and appear indistinguishable.\n\n\u201cMy biggest fear of counterfeiting is people are getting an unsafe product, and illegal product, and think it\u2019s coming from our company, a legal company,\u201d says Bryce Berryessa, a board member of the California Cannabis Manufacturers Association whose company, Skunk Feather, produces concentrates and vape cartridges.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIn light of the vaping-related illness, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) earlier this month warned consumers to avoid vaping products that contain THC. Though no specific additive, ingredient or substance has been identified in the vaping-related illnesses, health departments in some states \u2014 namely New York \u2014 have linked some of the illnesses to vitamin E acetate found in marijuana vaping devices.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Deceptive rip-off marijuana vapes\u00a0on the streets of California\u00a0could be linked to the emerging public health crisis of vaping-related deaths, according to a new report.", "authors": ["Frank Miles", "Frank Miles Is A Reporter", "Editor Covering Geopolitics", "Military", "Crime", "Technology", "Sports For Foxnews.Com.
