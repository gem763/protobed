She was advised by her mother and sister that while she was clear to compete, she could not wear heels because her body wasn\u2019t stable.\n\n\"At that moment when I found out I couldn\u2019t wear heels, I didn\u2019t feel too good,\" Deal told ABC News.\n\nThat\u2019s when Miesha Gordon, who is Deal's special needs teacher and the school's homecoming assistant, alerted the other homecoming candidates.\n\n\u201cWhen the court learned this, without a second thought, they kicked off their shoes and agreed to walk barefoot as well,\u201d Crystal Lotz Hadden, the school's assistant principal, wrote in a Facebook post.\n\nAs the homecoming court began taking their shoes off, Deal said she was very surprised by the gesture and suddenly heard the crowd cheering her on.\n\n\"I heard [them] saying my name and [then] I became Homecoming Queen,\" Deal said. \u201cI was feeling much better.\u201d\n\nDawn Ford\n\nHer classmates were determined to make her feel like a queen despite suffering a seizure.\n\n\u201cMy first thoughts about walking across barefoot were, 'Of course, I'll do it!' Not only because my heels were hurting my feet, but mainly to make Nataleigh feel better,\" Lillian Mann, a fellow homecoming court candidate, said. \"Nataleigh is such a sweet person and ... watching her have her seizure made me want to do anything I could to help her feel like the queen she is.\"\n\nCrystal Lotz Hadden\n\nHadden told ABC News that she posted the story of the homecoming court's gesture for Nataleigh because it shows that \"we are all in this together,\" she said. \u201cI wanted to share with the world, Look what we have here in our small town,\" Hadden said.\n\nNataleigh's mother, Dawn Ford, said her daughter has been dealing with seizures since 2014.\n\n\"All her life, we have prayed for love, acceptance and total inclusion for Nataleigh. We are so blessed that she is so loved and included,\" Ford said. \"I knew she was loved by her peers, but had no idea the magnitude of how much until Friday night.\u201d\n\nDeal's sister, Carleigh Deal, also shared a moving post about the gesture on Facebook: \"How blessed we are to be in a community that loves our girl beyond what we could\u2019ve ever comprehended before Friday night,\" she wrote. \"Complete love and inclusion in this world are both still VERY much alive and I pray every child, special needs or not, experiences and expresses them just the same.\"", "description": "Twelve homecoming court candidates walked barefoot across a football field in South Carolina in solidarity with their classmate who had a seizure.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/homecoming-1-ht-er-191008_hpMain_v4x3_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
