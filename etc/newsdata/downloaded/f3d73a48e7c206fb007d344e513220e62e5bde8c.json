Blue (0-9.9%); Teal (10-14.9%); Green (15-19.9%); Yellow (20- 24.9%); Orange (25 - 29.9%)\n\nFor their annual State of Childhood Obesity report, the researchers analyzed data collected through the 2017 and 2018 National Survey of Children's Health, which looks at children's physical and mental health, access to health care, and familial situation.\n\nIn Mississippi, more than a quarter of children were obese, a higher proportion than was seen in any other state.\n\nUtah, on the other hand, had the lowest obesity rate, at just 8.7 percent.\n\nThree states had obesity rates higher than the national rate of 15.3 percent, including Mississippi, West Virginia at 20.9 percent and Kentucky at 20.8 percent\n\nSix states, including Utah, had obesity rates lower than the national rate. The others were: Alaska, Colorado, Minnesota, Montana and Washington.\n\nThe RWFJ report revealed the obesity rates increased as household income decreased.\n\nNearly 22 percent of kids from families living below the federal poverty level were obese compared to 9.4 percent from families living 400 percent above the poverty level.\n\nThat's a comparison of a household of four with an annual income of $25,100 compared to a household of comparable size with an annual income of $117,680.\n\nDiscrepancies were also apparent among races. The obesity rate among black kids was 22.2 percent and 19 percent of Hispanic kids were obese.\n\nMeanwhile, rates were 11.8 percent for white children and 7.3 percent for Asian children.\n\nTHE WESTERN DIET EXPLAINED The Western diet is loosely defined as one full of fatty and sugary foods, such as burgers, fries and soda. People often eat foods that are high in Saturated fats\n\nRed meats\n\n'Empty' carbohydrates\n\nJunk Food And low in Fresh fruits and vegetables\n\nWhole Grains\n\nSeafood\n\nPoultry Health effects have been linked to things such as hypertension, heart disease, diabetes, obesity, colorectal cancer and dementia.\n\n'These new data show that this challenge touches the lives of far too many children in this country, and that Black and Hispanic youth are still at greater risk than their White and Asian peers,' said Dr Richard Besser, MD, president and CEO of RWJF in a statement.\n\nChildhood obesity is now the number one health concern among parents in the US, topping drug abuse and smoking, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nObesity is a risk factor for several devastating chronic health conditions including type 2 diabetes, strokes, heart attack and even certain types of cancer.\n\nPrevention is important early in life as one study found that five-year-olds who were overweight were four times as likely to be obese by age 14 as children with normal weights.\n\nHealth officials say that addressing the obesity epidemic will not only lead to better health outcomes, but also reduce medical costs sustained by American families and the US itself.\n\nIn 2012, a study from Cornell University in New York found obesity accounts for about 21 percent of total US health care costs, approximately $190.2 billion per year.\n\nIn its report, the RWJF recommended several policies to address the obesity epidemic.\n\nSome suggestions include grants from the CDC to all 50 states to implement obesity awareness campaigns and the US Department of Agriculture updating federal nutrition standards for school meals.", "description": "A new report has found that nearly 22% of kids from families living below the federal poverty level were obese compared to 9.4% of kids from wealthy families living several-fold above the poverty line.", "authors": ["Mary Kekatos Health Reporter For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/21/19551204-0-image-a-15_1570738652750.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
