Following another day of clashes with protesters, the general in charge of security in Santiago announced the extension of curfew until 6am Monday morning.\n\n\u201cThis is not an action against the citizens, these are not restrictions for the sake of restrictions,\u201d General Javier Iturriaga del Campo. \u201cWe do this to protect people\u2019s lives.\u201d\n\nThe death toll from the unrest in the meantime increased, after firefighters found five more bodies in the basement of a looted and burnt-out warehouse. Earlier, at least three people were reported killed in two separate arson attacks on supermarkets.\n\nCrowds of angry protesters were setting fires to busses and metro stations, as well as looting shops and destroying public property. Authorities reported over 100 \u201cserious incidents\u201d in which nearly 1,500 people were arrested across the country by Sunday, including 614 in Santiago alone.\n\nThe state of emergency has now been extended to five more cities beyond Santiago \u2013 and over 9,000 armed soldiers are deployed in the streets. Defending the government\u2019s heavy-handed response to the crisis, President Sebastian Pinera stated:\n\nDemocracy not only has the right, it has the obligation to defend itself using all the instruments that democracy itself provides, and the rule of law to combat those who want to destroy it.\n\nIn a bid to defuse the crisis, Pinera hastily reversed the contentious transport fare hike, but it was not enough, as a wider public discontent over the government\u2019s economic policies and growing social inequality seems to have reached its tipping point.\n\nChile is facing it worst unrest in decades amid its year-long hosting of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation gatherings, and just as Santiago prepares to greet Russian President Vladimir Putin, US President Donald Trump and other world leaders next month.\n\nAlso on rt.com Santiago in flames: Chile declares state of emergency as violent protests rock capital (PHOTOS)\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
