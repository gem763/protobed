Let me tell you what I am going to do for the country,' and not get into the debate, because it just drags it down.\"\n\nRead more: Trump may have committed tax fraud by fabricating a loan to avoid paying income taxes on nearly $50 million\n\nBiden's comments come as he faces continued criticism from progressives and feminist groups for his reluctance to address the problems with men's behavior toward women, especially in the workplace. The former vice president has himself been accused by multiple women of inappropriately touching them or invading their personal space throughout his political career.\n\nBrian Fallon, who served as a senior aide on Clinton's campaign, told BuzzFeed News Biden's approach to addressing the \"Access Hollywood\" tape reflected a \"Mad Men-era mentality.\"\n\n\"Is he suggesting Hillary's reaction to the 'Access Hollywood' tape should have been, 'Oh, never mind?'\" Fallon asked.\n\nA Biden aide responded to the criticism, telling the outlet he \"wasn't criticizing Hillary. He was criticizing the media for creating false equivalencies that minimized Trump's atrocious and repugnant behavior.\"\n\nRead more: Trump advisers are more worried about Elizabeth Warren than any other 2020 Democratic candidate\n\nThe media covered the tape extensively, as well as claims from more than a dozen women who accused the president, then a Republican candidate, of varying degrees of inappropriate behavior.\n\nOne of the most serious claims against Trump came after he took office, when the writer E. Jean Carroll said in June that Trump sexually assaulted her in a Bergdorf Goodman dressing room in the mid-1990s.\n\n\"The moment the dressing-room door is closed, he lunges at me, pushes me against the wall, hitting my head quite badly, and puts his mouth against my lips,\" she wrote. \"The next moment, still wearing correct business attire, shirt, tie, suit jacket, overcoat, he opens the overcoat, unzips his pants, and, forcing his fingers around my private area, thrusts his penis halfway \u2014 or completely, I'm not certain \u2014 inside me. It turns into a colossal struggle.\"\n\nCarroll wrote that she physically fought Trump off of her and fled the scene of the encounter, which took \"no more than three minutes.\"\n\nCarroll's allegation is the most serious public sexual-misconduct accusation that has so far been made against the president, aside from Ivana Trump's 1990 accusation that Trump raped her in a fit of rage in 1989.\n\nEliza Relman contributed to this report.", "description": "A senior Clinton campaign aide told BuzzFeed News Biden's approach to addressing the tape reflected a \"Mad Men-era mentality.\"", "authors": ["Sonam Sheth"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5cdc65dbe9f08a492f47afd3-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
