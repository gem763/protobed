Joining me on the panel were Martha Jones, a history professor at Johns Hopkins University and Quinta Jurecic, a managing editor at the legal website Lawfare.\n\nThe discussion was civil and illuminating \u2014 and somewhat disturbing.\n\nMr. Rosen said the panel\u2019s charge was \u201cto put a constitutional lens\u201d on the questions of the day, in order to \u201celevate the country above some of the partisan rancor that is transfixing the nation.\u201d At that he succeeded.\n\nNonetheless, the discussion also revealed, once again, just how deeply divided we are on some very fundamental issues \u2014 including impeachment and the current state of the Constitution.\n\nImpeachment, of course, was foremost on everyone\u2019s mind. The Constitution provides that a president, as well as other civil officers, may be impeached, and removed, for committing \u201ctreason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.\u201d\n\nFor Ms. Jurecic, this is a done deal. President Trump\u2019s conduct during his call with President Zelensky of Ukraine, she stated, was \u201ca paradigm of what we might look to as an impeachable offense.\u201d While acknowledging that \u201cwe don\u2019t yet have all the information,\u201d she argued that the facts as they are presently known are sufficiently clear to establish that Mr. Trump abused his office for personal gain at the expense of the country. Further, she invoked the specter of Richard Nixon to charge that Mr. Trump had perpetrated \u201ca gross civil liberties violation\u201d against former Vice President Joseph R. Biden and his son, Hunter.\n\nI agreed that a gross abuse of power might constitute an impeachable offense and that we will all learn more in the days and weeks ahead. But it is quite a stretch to say, based on the facts as we know them today, that we are anywhere near that threshold.\n\nWhen asked whether we were in a time of constitutional crisis, Ms. Jurecic replied that it could more accurately be described as a time of \u201cconstitutional rot\u201d in that our \u201cfaith in the underlying principles is gone.\u201d Mr. Rosen noted during the discussion that the norms that once governed our politics are being undermined.\n\nI\u2019m not buying it.\n\nYes, we are a closely divided country, a state which can lead to robust and messy disputes about the proper roles of the three branches of the federal government and about the proper scope of the federal government\u2019s power over the states and the people. But, for the most part, the rule of law has been, and continues to be, honored. The authority of the courts has been respected.\n\nProfessor Jones observed that our country\u2019s history shows \u201chow difficult it is to pull apart the constitutional questions from the political questions.\u201d In her view, \u201cthe deep subtext is a question about in what direction we are headed as a nation [and] who is going to steer us in that direction.\u201d This, she stressed, involves \u201cnot just political questions,\u201d but \u201cmoral questions.\u201d The answer, she implied, should be supplied by judges.\n\nWhile noting that it was the courts, specifically the Supreme Court, that undermined the promise of Reconstruction, she opined that we are currently in \u201ca sort of crisis\u201d because the courts appear to be headed toward \u201cif not rot, to a kind of irrelevance\u201d in terms of deciding \u201cthe kinds of human questions that are troubling us as a nation.\u201d\n\nMy response: Who says judges should be deciding major social issues in this country? I believe that deciding such questions should, in most instances, be left to the people and their elected representatives, not nine lawyers in robes sitting on the Supreme Court.\n\nIt was a spirited discussion that made for a fascinating, but slightly unsettling, evening. In a 1936 speech, Sir Austen Chamberlain cited an ancient Chinese curse (although he may have made it up): \u201cMay you live in interesting times.\u201d We certainly do.\n\n\u2981 John G.
