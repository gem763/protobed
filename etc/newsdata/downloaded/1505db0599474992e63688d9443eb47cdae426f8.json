(Reuters) - Facebook Inc (FB.O) will allow a new outside oversight board to make final decisions on whether individual pieces of content can be displayed on the social media site, but the group won\u2019t be able to make policy changes, the company said on Tuesday.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A man poses with a magnifier in front of a Facebook logo on display in this illustration taken in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, December 16, 2015. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic\n\nThe social media giant, which has about 2.4 billion monthly users, is moving to take down objectionable photos and videos after longstanding criticism for doing too little to combat hate speech, cyber bullying, and other content that violates the site\u2019s \u201ccommunity standards.\u201d\n\nThe board is meant as a type of appeals body through which users can challenge company decisions on controversial content.\n\n\u201cThe board\u2019s decision will be binding, even if I or anyone at Facebook disagrees with it,\u201d Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said in a statement, referring to calls on specific content, such as photos and videos.\n\nFacebook has created a charter for the group, now updated, after a global consultation process.\n\nWhile the new board cannot make policy, the company will be required to respond publicly to any recommendations the board makes.\n\n\u201cI was a little surprised and frankly a little disappointed in the fact that they seem to be viewing the scope of the board\u2019s \u2018binding\u2019 authority so narrowly,\u201d said Thomas Kadri, a resident fellow at Yale Law School\u2019s Information Society Project who was invited to one of Facebook\u2019s feedback sessions.\n\nFacebook said it expects to announce some members by the end of the year and that the board should start hearing cases in early 2020.\n\nSome initial members of the board, which will likely have between 11 and 40 members when fully staffed, will help select later ones. The public will also be able to put forward candidates for the board through a recommendations portal.\n\nBoth Facebook and its users will be able to submit cases and decisions will be made by panels of five members and then sent to the rest of the board.\n\nBoard members, whose positions are part-time, will be screened for conflicts of interest, including links to Facebook.", "description": "Facebook Inc will allow a new outside oversight board to make final decisions on whether individual pieces of content can be displayed on the social media site, but the group won't be able to make policy changes, the company said on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Elizabeth Culliford", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190917&t=2&i=1430969377&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8G1R5", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
