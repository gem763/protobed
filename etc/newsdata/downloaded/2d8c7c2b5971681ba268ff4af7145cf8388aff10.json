She also claimed that Solomon is being attacked \u201crelentlessly\u201d because he\u2019s getting \u201cdeep into the cases\u201d surrounding Ukraine, something diGenova and Dobbs agreed on.\n\n\u201cThose attacks, it seems, multiplying as this impeachment inquiry gets hotter and hotter,\u201d Dobbs added before pivoting to Wallace\u2019s story, stating he wanted to \u201cget this out of the way.\u201d\n\nNoting that he\u2019d spoken to the Fox News anchor beforehand, Dobbs asked diGenova to respond to the report that the pair were working with Giuliani on Ukraine-Biden and only Trump knew about the plan.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, I don\u2019t know what \u2018off the books\u2019 means,\u201d diGenova insisted. \u201cChris did not explain it when he made his statement about us and it was clearly designed as a smear to make it sound like we were doing something improper or unethical.\u201d\n\nThe frequent Dobbs guest went on to say that \u201cthis may come as a shock to\u201d Wallace but the pair are lawyers and they\u2019ve represented people all over the world, adding that they were once asked by Giuliani to possibly represent Ukrainian whistleblowers but that was the extent of any arrangement.\n\n\u201cWe never went to the Ukraine,\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cWe never represented anybody. But somebody lied to Chris Wallace and said that we did and we told the president all about it, which is absolutely false.\u201d\n\nToensing, for her part, jumped in to state that Wallace had called the pair and talked to them about it and that she went \u201coff the record\u201d with him, something Dobbs softly noted Wallace had told him about.\n\n\u201cI dealt with journalists for so many years,\u201d she continued. \u201cI always, when I\u2019m explaining something, say this is off the record. If they want something particular they come back. Chris never did that. He never said I am going to accuse you of a crime and violating attorney-client privilege. If he had said that I certainly would have given him a statement.\u201d\n\nDobbs, meanwhile, plainly noted that he appreciated that they had given their statement, adding: \u201cChris Wallace, I\u2019m sure he appreciates it as well.\u201d\n\n\u201cA particular coincidence of off-the-record and lost opportunities for denials,\u201d Dobbs said with a smile. \u201cAnd a smear job? Eh, nobody is going to try to smear you guys. You are too bright and too effective. I don\u2019t believe that for a minute.\u201d\n\nWithin a day of the release of Wallace\u2019s bombshell, Fox News appeared to quietly forget about its own scoop, discussing it only a few times on the air Monday and downplaying it on the network\u2019s website. This came in the wake of the New York Times\u2019 Ken Vogel claiming he first broke the diGenova-Toensing angle in May and Giuliani and diGenova offering forceful denials to Wallace\u2019s scoop.\n\nWallace, through a Fox News spokesperson, has said he stands by his reporting.\n\nInterestingly, during a Friday morning appearance on Fox News\u2019 America\u2019s Newsroom, Wallace wasn\u2019t asked about his story nor offered a chance to rebut diGenova\u2019s and Toensing\u2019s fiery attacks on him.\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGot a tip?
