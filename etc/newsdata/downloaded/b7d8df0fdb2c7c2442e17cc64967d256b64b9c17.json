Mane takes a touch against Albrighton and then decides to go down.\"\n\nThe comments made by Shearer echoed those made by Leicester manager Brendan Rodgers after the game, who claimed the penalty wasn't 'clear and obvious' and that it shouldn't have been given.\n\n(Image: Liverpool FC via Getty Images)\n\nLiverpool took the lead through Mane towards the end of the first half on home soil, slotting his shot past Kasper Schmeichel in the Foxes goal.\n\nBefore James Maddison thought he'd earned a point for the visitors after striking home from an Ayoze Perez pass.\n\nHowever, Milner's 95minute penalty denied Rodgers on his first return to Anfield since his sacking in October 2015.\n\nLiverpool's win meant they continued their 100% record this season with eight wins from the opening eight games this season.\n\nIn the process the Reds extended their win record, winning for the 17th consecutive game and are close to equalling Manchester City's record of 18.", "description": "Former Newcastle striker believes the winger dived to earn the crucial penalty that beat Leicester", "authors": ["Adam Payne", "Image", "Sportimage Pa Images", "Liverpool Fc Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20518210.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Croatia-v-England-FIFA-World-Cup-2018-Semi-Final-Luzhniki-Stadium.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
