In fact, a 2013 study from the University of California, Berkeley found that one partner\u2019s sleepless night caused by disturbances from the other partner can result in conflicts in the relationship the next day.\n\n\u201cWhile there are benefits to sleeping together, one partner\u2019s troublesome sleeping or annoying bed habits can affect the other and increase production of the stress hormone cortisol, thus causing issues that impact the couple as a whole,\u201d says Mary Jo Rapini, a relationship and intimacy psychotherapist based in Houston.\n\nFeeling rested, the experts say, could help you manage life with more focus and control, which in turn can make you feel more content and happier in your relationship.\n\n\u201cWhen both parties are getting a restorative night\u2019s sleep it allows them to feel emotionally, mentally and physically healthier without one resentful of their partner for keeping them awake, nor the other feeling guilty for disturbing his or her mate,\u201d says Jennifer Adams, the author of Sleeping Apart Not Falling Apart. \u201cThat\u2019s a good foundation on which to build and weather a relationship.\u201d\n\nNot sharing a marital bed is becoming many couples\u2019 dream.\n\nA 2012 survey by the Better Sleep Council showed that one in four couples sleeps separately for a better night\u2019s sleep. Yet 46 per cent of 2,000 Americans polled last year by the marketing research company OnePoll on behalf of the bedding retailer Slumber Cloud said they wished they could sleep apart from their partner.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

I would toss and turn and not get enough sleep, so on occasion I would sleep in the spare room,\u201d says one 41-year-old woman from Brisbane, who did not wish to be identified for fear of being stigmatised in her social circle. She has been married 18 years and has two children with her husband, also 41. \u201cOnce I was pregnant with our second baby, one of us would sleep in the spare room to ensure we both got a good night\u2019s sleep,\u201d she says. \u201cMy husband\u2019s snoring and blanket-hogging frustrated me when I was very tired and I would sometimes wake him up to tell him to stop, which of course he didn\u2019t appreciate. It wasn\u2019t until years later that it became more routine.\u201d\n\nSeparate sleeping arrangements can include pairing side by side beds of similar size, having a smaller plus a larger bed in the room that the couple could share when they want to be intimate, or designating nights in a spare room. Separate bedrooms is another option.\n\nTina Cooper, 45, a licensed social worker who owns a home in Baltimore with her boyfriend of 10 years, Donald Smith, 63, also a social worker, prefers having her own room. \u201cI\u2019m a private person and need space,\u201d she says. \u201cEveryone I\u2019ve ever dated knew that if we married I would want my own bedroom. If they tried to change my mind I knew he was not the one for me.\u201d\n\nLike many other couples who like having separate bedrooms, Cooper and Smith have opposite sleeping habits.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a night owl, he\u2019s an early bird,\u201d Cooper says. \u201cI need soothing sounds to fall asleep to, he likes silence. He likes a hard mattress, mine is soft and full of pillows. And because I don\u2019t like the early day\u2019s sunlight, Donald gave me the master bedroom which gets less light and he has the second largest room that gets the sunrise he loves.\u201d\n\nBeing open and honest with your partner about why you want to sleep separately is essential. \u201cWhat\u2019s equally as important to why you want to sleep apart is how you plan to ensure intimacy is retained in the relationship,\u201d Adams says. \u201cMaking sure you have a routine and set times to connect is key, such as having breakfast together each morning or a drink together before bed at night, and welcoming each other into your room.\u201d\n\nCooper said that she and her boyfriend \u201cdo spend a lot of time together. We hang out in each other\u2019s bedroom, but mostly in the kitchen. And we share the third bedroom as our office, where we each have our own desk.\u201d\n\nHealthy couples who sleep separately can be as happy as healthy couples who sleep together. \u201cThey seem to have as good a sex life as couples who share the same bed,\u201d Rapini says. \u201cThey feel very close to their partner. Maybe it\u2019s because they respect each other\u2019s personal space.\u201d\n\nPaulette Sherman, a psychologist based in New York City and author of Dating From the Inside Out also notes that \u201csome couples who sleep separately report missing one another and that it adds some excitement and longing to their sex life.\u201d\n\nThe Australian woman who wanted to remain anonymous says she and her husband have a \u201cwonderful relationship and in terms of intimacy we have a very healthy sex life. We certainly look forward to a night away and when at home he will either go back to his bed or we remain in mine the entire night if his snoring isn\u2019t bad.\u201d\n\nPhilip Shen, the chief executive of SleepChoices, a mattress company based in Coral Springs, Florida, has helped many couples resolve sleep issues by helping them choose the right mattress for their lifestyle. \u201cOverall, the primary factor doesn\u2019t stem from a lack of desire to be with a partner,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s usually the case that their current sleep environment makes it challenging for both parties to enjoy quality sleep together.\u201d\n\nFor couples not ready for separate sleeping domains, a happy medium could be met with the right sleep solution. Investing in an adjustable mattress that accommodates both partners sleeping needs or pushing together two separate mattresses can help solve conflicts while still allowing a couple to remain close.\n\n\u201cAnd have conversations about working out your sleep incompatibilities when you\u2019re both feeling comfortable and connected,\u201d Page adds. \u201cNot in the middle of the night when your partner\u2019s snoring is driving you nuts.\u201d\n\n\u00a9 New York Times\n\nThe Independent's Millennial Love group is the best place to discuss to the highs and lows of modern dating and relationships.
