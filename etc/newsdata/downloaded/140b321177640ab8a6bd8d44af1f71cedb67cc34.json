Lloris replacement needed\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to think of a worse week in a goalkeeper\u2019s life. Last Saturday Hugo Lloris\u2019 attempt at turning Danny Ings resulted in the ball being bundled into his net, in midweek he shipped seven against Bayern, and now another error cost Spurs and his health in equal measure.\n\nA seemingly routine cross from the left hand side somehow had the French World Cup winner spilling the ball back into the six yard box allowing Neal Maupay to nod home unopposed.\n\nAnd to top it all off, Lloris appears to have broken his arm in the process. Tottenham\u2019s recent struggles are approaching \u2018you couldn\u2019t write it\u2019 territory.\n\nDespite his ability to pull off top saves, Lloris has become increasingly error-prone in recent seasons, with the World Cup Final blunder a prominent symptom in what looks a psychological block for the Spurs \u2018keeper.\n\nAt 32, Lloris isn\u2019t getting any younger, he\u2019s making more mistakes and lacks the ability required of modern goalkeepers to effect the game with your feet and your hands in equal measure.\n\nNext summer may be the apt time to invest in a fresh, contemporary goalkeeper.\n\n2. Maupay and Mooy key to a more expansive Brighton\n\nA major criticism of Chris Hughton as he departed Brighton this summer was the lack of ideas going forward. Under Graham Potter the Seagulls are reinvented, and new signings Aaron Mooy and Neal Maupay have been the cornerstones of the new style.\n\nFor all his obvious benefits to a team, when Glenn Murray is your talisman, your style of football is always going to be restricted to early crossing and direct football.\n\nWith the introduction of Maupay, suddenly Brighton have a striker who doesn\u2019t simply act as a wall to play one-two\u2019s off, but excels when dropping deep for the ball, running in behind and poaching goals in the box as he did today.\n\nCombine that with the almost nonchalant class of Mooy in midfield- suddenly the passing and moving is seamless having been rigid an unconvincing just last season.\n\nPotter had his doubters upon his arrival from Swansea, but his quietly progressive mantra has rejuvenated Brighton.\n\n3. Spurs need to address lack of wide options\n\nKieran Trippier was condemned to near-parody status during last season, but his recent form in Madrid combined with Spurs\u2019 woeful lack of options at right back has proved that the \u00a320 million fee didn\u2019t come close to justifying the impact of his departure.\n\nSerge Aurier has never inspired trust from his coaches, Kyle Walker-Peters is still growing in to Premier League football and beyond that Moussa Sissoko lacks the technical ability to offer imagination in the wide areas.\n\nAt right back Spurs have no forward thinking player, which would be fine if they had natural width in attack. However, with Lamela playing on the right and Lucas Moura on the bench , Spurs lacked the pace and natural width to stretch Brighton.\n\nEven the left hand side of Tottenham\u2019s defence produces similar issues, with Ben Davies only a solid squad player and Danny Rose frequently embroiled in transfer speculation.\n\nUnless Lucas is brought back into the lineup, Spurs are relying solely on Son for any sort of dynamism. A problem that will only ever lead to goal-scoring struggles.\n\n4. Connolly the real deal\n\nMaybe he benefited from Sissoko\u2019s occupation of the right back role in Spurs\u2019 defence, or possibly he slots in to the well versed category of \u2018unknown quantity\u2019. Regardless, after today\u2019s performance 19 year old Aaron Connolly will have a few more admirers. Two goals, the second oozing with finesse, topping off a remarkable display.\n\nIt was his his fifth Premier League appearance, but his calmness of thought accompanied by animated movement and dribbling left Tottenham\u2019s right hand side a wasteland of misjudged tackles and despairing recovery runs.\n\nToby Alderweireld had a particularly turbulent afternoon, reluctantly bringing himself into Connolly\u2019s wake to desperately try and cover the right channel.\n\nThe young Irishman only scored his first senior goal today, but he may already have graduated to the Seagulls primary threat.\n\n5.Poch on the brink\n\nFollowing the 7-2 humiliation in midweek, Pochettino knew a defeat at Brighton could leave him in serious danger.\n\nAnd here we are, a comprehensively poor performance, and a result to match.\n\nThere are an array of diagnoses that can be attributed to the chaos at Spurs; fatigue, tactics, transfer speculation, a stale feeling after six years of Poch reign.\n\nIt seems a combination of all these things has contributed. Rose, Alderweireld and Eriksen looked gone in the summer, selecting Eric Dier surrendered the midfield control to the home side, and the right back problems have been persistent.\n\nWhatever happens this season, next summer will certainly see plenty of familiar faces depart, and a few new ones arrive in North London.", "description": "Tottenham\u2018s recent\u00a0turbulence continued as they fell to a 3-0 defeat at Brighton, conceding twice to\u00a019-year-old Aaron Connolly and headed opener by Neal Maupay as Lloris was stretchered off.
