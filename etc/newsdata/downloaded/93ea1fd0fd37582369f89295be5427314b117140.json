But she is a flattened two-dimensional character, representing both the compression that Indigenous cultures have faced in society and the inhumanity that Indigenous women have endured.\n\nKent Monkman's The Deposition was gifted to the Winnipeg Art Gallery by an anonymous donor. (Submitted by Winnipeg Art Gallery)\n\nMonkman draws inspiration from the Old Masters, some of the greatest painters in history.\n\n\"I wanted to use their ways of painting the female nude to talk about violence perpetrated against Indigenous people, and also the violence perpetrated against the female spirit.\"\n\nMonkman now lives in Toronto, and his work has been featured across Canada and beyond. The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City recently accepted one of his commissions.\n\nShame and Prejudice, which has already toured to Calgary, Halifax, Charlottetown, Montreal and Kingston, Ont., opened in Toronto in 2017 \u2014 the year Canada celebrated its 150th birthday \u2014 and uses Winnipeg's North End as the setting to explore colonialism through an Indigenous perspective.\n\nIt is Monkman's second solo exhibition at the WAG. He grew up taking art classes at the gallery.\n\n\"This entire project was really informed by my experience as a child growing up here,\" Monkman said. \"But it's more than that \u2014 it's informed by the experience of my family and my ancestors that are from this territory.\"\n\nWinnipeg themes\n\nHis ability to fuse such themes in his work is remarkable, says Jaimie Isaac, the WAG's curator of Indigenous and contemporary art.\n\n\"It's amazing that he can, at once, address art history and the telling of modernity, but also reference contemporary times and social climates within the streets of Winnipeg,\" she said.\n\nWhile admiring the new addition to the WAG's collection, Isaac notes how Monkman seamlessly integrates symbols and iconography.\n\nAs examples, she points out the \"204\" tattoo on one man's neck, a pair of beaded runners and a crow flying away with jewlery it has snatched. Isaac spots the initials of the Indian Posse street gang imprinted on a stop sign.\n\nSeveral of Kent Monkman's paintings will be on display at the Winnipeg Art Gallery until Feb. 9, 2020. (Ian Froese/CBC)\n\nIt is clear in his exhibition that Monkman's early years in Winnipeg shaped his artwork.\n\n\"I really feel like Winnipeg was such an important part of who I am. My ancestors are from this territory,\" he said.\n\n\"I think often about Winnipeg as a troubling place. It's a difficult place to be an Indigenous person in many ways \u2014 you see the fallout of colonialism, it's so visible here, and yet there is this spirit of resiliency and positivity in the people,\" Monkman said.\n\n\"I also gain a lot of inspiration from all the amazing things that are happening here, in terms of the Indigenous artists and the cultural work that's happening here.\"\n\nShame and Prejudice runs at the Winnipeg Art Gallery until Feb. 9, 2020.", "description": "Kent Monkman's latest exhibition, which etches\u00a0Indigenous expressions into a picture of Winnipeg's contemporary streets, had its Winnipeg opening on Friday at the Winnipeg Art Gallery.", "authors": ["Ian Froese Is A Reporter With Cbc Manitoba.
