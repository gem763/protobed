She was initially let go because the company she worked for was part of a tender process for a large contract with the government, but the government stopped the entire process around about the time the tender had to be awarded. There was still hope afterwards that the tender process would start again and the company would get it, but it took too long and took JC\u2019s job with it.\n\nREAD MORE: \"I was outed as transgender and it was one of the most painful experiences of my life\"\n\nJC was the manager for the GIS division. \u201cI was personally responsible for the development and maintenance of all GIS and Remote Sensing databases,\u201d she says. \u201cMy secondary responsibility was to develop GIS and Remote Sensing related information systems for use by our clients.\u201d\n\nJC is a capable, intelligent, hardworking woman who has 20 years of experience, but says that trying to find another job has been frustrating to say the least. \u201cThe last time I was in this position, people gave you feedback. Up to now I\u2019ve only received confirmation or responses from 1 out of every 10 applications,\u201d she says.\n\nREAD MORE: Home Affairs officials now obliged to marry same sex couples\n\nJC initially only looked for work in her field, but now she is willing to do any kind of work and even take entry level positions because she is so desperate.\n\nThere is no direct evidence for her being trans playing a role in why she hasn\u2019t even had an interview for any of the jobs she\u2019s applied for, but she can\u2019t help but think that it does when she doesn\u2019t get communication from potential jobs or just outright rejections.\n\n\u201cMy biggest fear after my transition was losing my job. I was always fearful because I know how many transgender people like me struggle to find work. I\u2019m now living that nightmare,\u201d says JC.\n\nREAD MORE: Sibabalwe Gcilitshana on being the first queer woman in the Miss SA pageant\n\nIn January, JC took her dogs for shots and spoke to the vet about being unemployed. The vet offered her R400 if she was \u201cwilling to work hard\u201d the next Saturday. JC agreed and did the work which went well and chatted to the vet after. She mentioned that she is transgender during this conversation.\n\nJC was never paid for the work she did and never heard from the vet again even though she made it clear that she was willing and able to work when she was needed. When the vet was contacted by JC\u2019s mother who was angry that her daughter was never paid, she was told that JC had volunteered her time for the day.\n\nAt her previous job, JC kept her transition secret for a long time as she was scared. After she found out that she was born intersex, she started telling people why she was \u201cdifferent.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: Bisexual woman gets flirting advice after posting her viral tweet about finding dating women tricky\n\n\u201cHaving to give people a reason why I was different, made it a lot easier, but I was outed as transgender at work by someone that was a friend,\u201d she says. \u201cWhile my company was supportive of my transition, I became isolated from people at the company. At times I would go through an entire workday with no human interaction. However, I still enjoyed my work. It was my passion.\u201d\n\nJC is struggling to cope because she cannot find a job. She is extremely depressed and has isolated herself from everyone and her friendships have suffered although her relationship with her fianc\u00e9 stays strong. \u201cI live every day with suicidal thoughts. I can\u2019t sleep. I honestly feel I\u2019ve lost all hope,\u201d she says.\n\nHave you faced discrimination? How did you cope?
