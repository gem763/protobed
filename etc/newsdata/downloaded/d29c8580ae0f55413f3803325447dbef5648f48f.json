But this is not doing you any favours in finding a professional job.\u201d\n\nClow, 24, shared a screenshot of the post on Twitter, writing: \u201cI was objectified earlier today by a company because of a picture of me in a bikini. They claimed it made me \u2018unprofessional\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey screenshot the photo, posted it on their Insta story and called me out,\u201d she continued. \u201cI am still baffled that the company handled it in such a manner.\u201d\n\nClow\u2019s tweet, which has been liked more than 3,500 times, prompted a flurry of supportive messages from people expressing their outrage at Kickass Masterminds.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s disgusting (and waaaay more unprofessional than a bikini photo) [sic],\u201d commented one person.\n\n\u201cI hope they feel embarrassed as Hell for that! Also, how is that photo unprofessional? Like, you clearly aren\u2019t on the clock in that pic, and it\u2019s completely harmless.\u201d\n\nAnother added: \u201cI bet they don\u2019t do the same when their male employees have pics of themselves in bathing suits\u201d.\n\nKickass Masterminds has since switched its Instagram account to private.\n\nThe company\u2019s founder, Sara Christensen, confirmed the incident to the MailOnline but said that Clow was not in fact rejected from the internship.\n\n\u201cThe woman in question was not disqualified because of her social media profile,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIn fact, she was not disqualified at all. There was no communication to her saying she was disqualified.\u201d\n\nAs for the photograph, Sara added: \u201cShe requested that I removed it and I did immediately.\u201d\n\nThe Independent has contacted Kickass Masterminds for further comment.", "description": "A marketing company in Texas has come under fire after it shared a photograph of a prospective intern wearing a swimsuit on Instagram in an apparent attempt to shame her.
