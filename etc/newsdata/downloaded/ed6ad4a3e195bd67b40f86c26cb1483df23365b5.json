It has already been approved by the upper house.\n\nThe law makes it legal for terminations to be conducted up to 22 weeks into a woman's pregnancy - or later if two doctors agree.\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption The debate over the bill prompted protests on both sides\n\nThe reform had been strongly opposed by some activists and MPs who raised objections due to their personal beliefs, as well as concerns about late-term abortions.\n\nBut last-minute amendments ultimately persuaded some conservative MPs, and the bill drew support from other parties.\n\n\"The current law has meant women and doctors have a threat of 10 years in jail for making this decision and that's not okay,\" said Labor MP Penny Sharpe, one of the bill's co-sponsors.\n\n\"This is a massive step forward for women in this state.\"\n\nYou might also be interested in:", "description": "New South Wales becomes the final state to overturn laws which had been criticised as archaic.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07pbtvh.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
