The teen was wearing a school-issued swimsuit \u2014 the same one all of her teammates were wearing.\n\nFollowing the incident, the school reviewed Friday's swim meet. At the time, the student's coach contested the referee's decision. That request was denied. The Anchorage School District then conducted a review of the incident.\n\nOn Tuesday, the district decided to move forward in appealing the swimmer's disqualification.\n\n\"Our swimmer was targeted based solely on how a standard, school-issued uniform happened to fit the shape of her body,\" the district said in a statement. \"We cannot tolerate discrimination of any kind, and certainly not based on body shape. This disqualification was heavy-handed and unnecessary.\"\n\n'This disqualification was heavy-handed and unnecessary.'\n\nThe district said it was appealing to the Alaska School Activities Association to reverse the decision and regain lost points; decertify the referee; and revise the National Federation of State High School Associations rule the swimmer was disqualified over because it's \"ambiguous and allows the potential for bias to influence officials' decisions.\"\n\nThe rule referenced requires that girls' swimsuits \"cover the buttocks and breast,\" was set by the National Federation of State High School Associations, which presides over high school sports in Alaska.\n\nWhen it received the appeal, the ASAA agreed. The swimmer's disqualification was overturned.\n\nIn a statement, the ASAA said it reversed the decision because of a rule that states officials must notify coaches when they become aware of uniform violations.\n\n\"All evidence gathered, including the statement provided by the official, indicated the official did not notify the coach prior to disqualifying the student, \" the statement said.\n\nAdditionally, the swimmer participated in four races during Friday's meet but was only disqualified after one, the Anchorage Daily News reported.\n\nRead more: A high school swimmer was disqualified after winning a race because she had a 'suit wedgie'\n\nThis isn't the first time this student's body has been targeted\n\nThe teen's mom, Meagan Kowatch, previously told KTUU that this ref had also targeted her younger daughter over the fit of her swimsuit the previous year.\n\nAnd it's not the first time the teen who was disqualified has been targeted over her body. In September of 2018, another parent took pictures of the girl's backside and sent it to other parents to demonstrate that her swimwear was \"inappropriate,\" the Washington Post reported.\n\nThe school district has released a full timeline of events. They noted that at the time, the \"assistant principal indicated to the parent who took the photographs that it was not permissible for him to take pictures of others' children and that he should stop immediately.\"\n\nLauren Langford, a local swim coach, told the Washington Post that the parent who took those pictures was out of line.\n\n\"We have a term for it \u2014 it's called a suit wedgie,\" she said. \"And wedgies happen. It's uncomfortable. No one's going to walk around that way intentionally.\"\n\nNOW WATCH: You can swim through this glass bridge in Mexico", "description": "A referee told a swimmer that her school-issued uniform was inappropriate.
