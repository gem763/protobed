At the beginning, they mostly just lie around. But once they\u2019re able to sit up, crawl and then toddle unsteadily about, they\u2019re on a mission to do something and touch everything.\n\nHowever many toys you have, it\u2019s not enough. The dog\u2019s water dish, the dirt in the potted plant and the burnt wood in the fireplace \u2014 these are what they\u2019re after. They crave the feel not just of plush toys but of everything. And they should; they learn so much about the world around them through touch. So the more textures we can (safely) offer them, the less they may feel the urge to bang their hand on the glass cabinet door.\n\nThis is why you should make your baby a \u201cbusy board.\u201d\n\nBusy boards are like sensory bins for toddlers and preschoolers \u2014 except everything is glued or screwed into place so they don\u2019t willy-nilly start swallowing handfuls of things.\n\nYou can keep it pretty basic, with items you already have around the home. Or you can go all-out with supplies from your local hardware store. You\u2019re limited only by your own imagination (or your ability to search on Pinterest).\n\nYou can use a piece of smooth wood, as pictured above. Even a sturdy piece of cardboard will do. On that board, you can mount anything you like (make sure it\u2019s not too sharp or pointy or could be pulled off and swallowed). Here are some ideas:\n\nZippers\n\nRibbons\n\nBuckles\n\nAnything with buttons\n\nFabrics with different textures\n\nSqueaky toys\n\nDoor knockers\n\nChain locks\n\nSmall carpet squares\n\nFidget spinners\n\nSmall steering wheels\n\nHands On As We Grow has a great tutorial if you need more inspiration. Of course, if you like the idea but don\u2019t want to make your own, you can also buy them; they range from fairly affordable to pretty pricey. This one in particular looks to be pretty compact and lightweight, which would make it a good option for when you\u2019re travelling and baby wants to examine every inch of the germy aeroplane or hotel room.", "description": "Babies and young toddlers are, you know, kind of hard to occupy.
