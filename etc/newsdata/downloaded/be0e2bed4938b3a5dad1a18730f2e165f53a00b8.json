Early Friday morning, Aaron Carter began a Twitter tirade against his elder brother, Nick Carter, in response to Nick publicly stating that he and his sister are seeking a restraining order against Aaron. The Twitter rant, which showed no signs of stopping as of 2:25 AM EST, began when Aaron tweeted \u201cI\u2019m the boss now. Sorry bro!\u201d at approximately 12:30 AM EST and quickly devolved from there.\n\nIn the series of erratic tweets, Aaron goes from demanding apologies from the general public to accusing Nick of committing sexual assault against multiple women over the course of their careers. Beyond these more serious allegations, Aaron also repeatedly claims that Nick broke his nose at the Nickelodeon Kid\u2019s Choice Awards when he pied Aaron in the face:\n\nI was 13 look at my brothers face before he broke my nose with a pie at the kids choice awards during my acceptance speech. \ud83d\udc4f hes bullying these women with power and money and now I\u2019m back. And powerful and welsthy and healthy. Nick cannot stop his own reckoning https://t.co/vWRES2KGVY pic.twitter.com/x8HdrMwJWY \u2014 Aaron Carter (@aaroncarter) September 19, 2019\n\nAlthough he is reticent to admit it online, Aaron has battled some demons in the past few years. He was arrested in 2017 on a DUI and marijuana possession and subsequently spent some time in rehab. In his tweet announcing why he was seeking a restraining order against his younger brother, Nick said that he believes Aaron to be a potential danger to his wife and unborn child.", "description": "Aaron Carter goes on a Twitter Tirade about older brother Nick Carter after Nick publicly states that he recently filed a restraining order against Aaron.", "authors": ["Chris Murphy"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/10/19-Aaron-Carter.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
