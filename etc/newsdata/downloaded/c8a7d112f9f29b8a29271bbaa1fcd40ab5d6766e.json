The full committee hadn\u2019t taken up the issue in at least 20 years.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to be drowning in debt to understand that this is an issue sidelining millions of Americans,\u201d the 33-year-old said. \u201cPeople are putting off marriage, kids, homeownership and retirement \u2015 especially my generation.\u201d\n\nMinhaj, who used to appear on \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d before getting his own Netflix series, \u201cPatriot Act,\u201d last year, aired an episode in February in which he broke down the often confusing but debilitating problem of crushing student loan debt in the United States. The segment highlighted that 44 million people in America owe more than $1.6 trillion in student loan debt and that loan servicers, such as Navient, have a history of misleading student borrowers and pushing them into repayment plans that result in even more debt.\n\nThe student loan debt in our audience cost more than this set. pic.twitter.com/cKbQ6PLu1W \u2014 Hasan Minhaj (@hasanminhaj) February 27, 2019\n\nAt the committee hearing Tuesday, Minhaj said he polled his live studio audience on that show and found that among about 200 people in the studio, there was more than $6 million in student debt.\n\n\u201cNow granted, our audience is mainly unemployed poli-sci majors, but that\u2019s still a lot of money,\u201d he told the committee, getting some laughs.\n\nThe comedian then said he and his team of researchers looked up where each committee member went to college and what their school\u2019s inflation-adjusted tuition was at the time. According to Minhaj, on average the entire committee graduated from college about 33 years ago and paid an inflation-adjusted tuition of $11,690 a year. Currently, the average tuition at all those same schools is nearly $25,000, a 110% increase, when wages have increased only 16% in that time, according to the host.\n\nYou know the student loan crisis is bad when I'm asked to testify before Congress about it. pic.twitter.com/TTqylZZf8k \u2014 Hasan Minhaj (@hasanminhaj) September 10, 2019\n\n\u201cSo, people aren\u2019t making more money and college is objectively way more expensive,\u201d Minhaj said. \u201cAnd yet many borrowers are still treated like deadbeats because the government has put their financial futures in the hands of predatory for-profit loan servicing companies.\u201d\n\nLater during the hearing, Rep. Sean Duffy (R-Wis.) \u2015 who used to be on MTV\u2019s \u201cThe Real World\u201d \u2015 tried to argue that \u201csmarter\u201d students always go to higher-acclaimed schools, to which the panel of witnesses disagreed. When he said, \u201cIf you have a 20 on your ACT, you\u2019re not going to Harvard,\u201d Minhaj interjected with: \u201cOr, if your mom\u2019s Aunt Becky, you can just pay your way to USC. \u2026 You and I, we\u2019re both former MTV stars. You get it.\u201d\n\n.@hasanminhaj tells Rep Sean Duffy that sometimes \"Aunt Becky\" is what gets you into Harvard, and: \"we're both former MTV stars.\" Not everyone can rely on that MTV check! \ud83e\udd23 (Duffy wasn't happy) pic.twitter.com/5gGfxlgFMH \u2014 AFR (@RealBankReform) September 10, 2019\n\nMinhaj stressed the fact that student borrowers don\u2019t get to choose their loan services because the Education Department does it for them, providing no incentive for competition that would compel such companies to provide better service.\n\n\u201cSo really, all I\u2019m asking today is, why can\u2019t we treat our student borrowers the way we treat our banks? Because 44 million Americans, that is too big to fail,\u201d he said. \u201cThank you so much for your time, and I will now go back to where I came from.\u201d\n\n.@hasanminhaj came to Congress to testify in @FSCDems committee on the college debt crisis. He ended his testimony with: \"...and now I will go back to where I came from.\"\n\n\n\nThank you Hasan for using humor to show how ridiculous it is not to do anything to address this crisis. pic.twitter.com/u0431O1KJ3 \u2014 Rashida Tlaib (@RashidaTlaib) September 10, 2019", "description": "The host of political comedy show \"Patriot Act\" previously recorded an episode breaking down the confusing issue of the rising student loan crisis in the...", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7823ad3b0000c49fd0c612.jpeg?cache=pq2gbxfe6u&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
