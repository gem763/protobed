Discussing the importance of being breast aware, Addie Mitchell, Clinical Nurse Specialist at Breast Cancer Care, wants women to know there is no right or wrong way to check your breasts. 'It\u2019s about looking and feeling regularly so any changes can be spotted quickly,' she said. 'The sooner breast cancer is diagnosed, the more effective treatment may be. 'Whatever your age, being aware of all the signs and symptoms of breast cancer is crucial \u2013 it\u2019s not just a lump to look out for. Other changes could be a nipple becoming inverted or a change in texture of the skin. 'While most symptoms won't mean breast cancer, if you notice anything unusual for you get it checked out by your GP. 'Anyone with questions can call Breast Cancer Care\u2019s nurses free on 0808 800 6000 or visit breastcancercare.org.uk.'\n\nMORE: Get yourself Vans with boobs and nipples for Breast Cancer Awareness Month\n\nMORE: When I was diagnosed with cancer I told myself every day how amazing I am\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month and Friday 18 is Wear it Pink Day, but what does that mean and what charity does it raise money for?", "authors": ["Rachael Martin"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Supporter-photox2-f8c5_1571306635.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
