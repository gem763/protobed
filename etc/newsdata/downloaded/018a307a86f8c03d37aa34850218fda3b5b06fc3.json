Such appointments, akin to a president filling slots in a federal judiciary, give Francis \u201cthe power to reshape the Church in his image,\u201d reported Religion News Service.\n\nOf note, 10 of the 13 new cardinals are under 80, the age below which they could vote for a new pope.\n\nWho wasn\u2019t and was among those to receive a new ring and red hat (called a biretta) at the high altar says much about Pope Francis\u2019 vision for reform within the church. While the College \u2014 the official clergy of Rome \u2014 is 42% European, the list of new cardinals included a Guatemalan bishop, an African missionary and the head of the Vatican\u2019s Boyd on migrants.\n\nNot among the new cardinals announced last month was 75-year-old Philadelphia Archbishop Charles Chaput, who was the first archbishop from the city in over a century not to be elevated to cardinal. Archbishop Chaput has been an ecclesiastical opponent of Pope Francis and had asked pastors not to give Communion to parishioners violating the church\u2019s sexual teachings on marriage and gay relationships.\n\nFrancis did select Italian Archbishop Matteo Zuppi, who wrote an introduction to \u201cBuilding a Bridge,\u201d a 2017 book from U.S. Jesuit Rev. James Martin that called for the Church to embrace gay Catholics. Also named cardinal was Michael Czerny, undersecretary of the Section for Migrants and Refugees at the Dicastery for Promoting Integral Human Development, whose new pectoral cross was made from wood salvaged from a dinghy used by refugees traversing the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nThe College of Cardinals now includes 128 eligible electors. Forty-two electors were made cardinals by Pope Emeritus Benedict and 16 are remaining from the papacy of Pope John Paul II.\n\nAmong the new cardinals include Spanish Bishop Miguel Angel Ayuso Guixot, who said Pope Francis, in speaking to the new prelates, \u201cmade it understood that the church is a church on the move, a church open to all realities,\u201d according to wire service reports.\n\nPope Francis has drawn wariness among the traditional and conservative wings of the Catholic Church, who view his pastoral approach and liberalizing efforts on issues such as divorce, the role of women in the church, migration, climate change and other social issues.\n\nOn Saturday, following the ceremony, Francis accompanied the new cardinals to the residence of Pope Emeritus Benedict, living at the Mater Ecclesiae Monastery within the Vatican compound. According to a Vatican spokesman, Benedict \u201creminded the new cardinals of the value of fidelity to the pope.\u201d\n\nThe list of new cardinals also includes Ignatius Suharyo Hardjoatmodjo, archbishop of Jakarta; Havana Archbishop Juan Garcia Rodriguez; and Cristobal Lopez Romero, archbishop of Rabat, Morocco.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
