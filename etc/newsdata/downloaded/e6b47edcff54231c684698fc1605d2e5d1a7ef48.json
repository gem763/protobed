The suit \u2014 which was filed in Los Angeles Superior Court on Tuesday by Christina Krause, Canoo\u2019s former head of communications and Stefan Krause\u2019s wife \u2014 also claims the California startup\u2019s primary investors are a German businessman with ties to Buckingham Palace, and a Chinese tycoon connected to the Communist Party of China.\n\nIn the complaint, Christina Krause says that despite being a founding employee, she was marginalized and increasingly pushed aside by her husband who allegedly pressured her to sign a postnuptial agreement while he was carrying out an affair. She also claims she was paid less than Canoo\u2019s other founding members, despite taking on wide-ranging responsibilities, like running communications, heading up HR, securing multiple office spaces, and using her own personal credit line to cover expenses in the startup\u2019s early days.\n\nThe lawsuit may help explain why Stefan Krause recently \u201cstepped away\u201d from his role as CEO in August, as The Verge previously reported, before Canoo unveiled its first vehicle in Los Angeles on September 24th.\n\nThe startup\u2019s former head of comms \u2014 and the CEO\u2019s wife \u2014 says she was harassed by her husband, an investor, and others\n\nA spokesperson for Canoo declined to comment on \u201congoing litigation.\u201d\n\nCanoo, which was originally called Evelozcity, has grown to around 400 employees since it was founded in late 2017. It plans to exclusively offer its cars on a subscription basis, and it has claimed to have raised around $1 billion to get the idea off the ground. The origins of that money had been a mystery, but the new lawsuit names David Stern and Pak Tam \u201cDavid\u201d Li as its primary investors.\n\nStern is a former business partner and friend of Stefan Krause\u2019s, according to the complaint and news reports. He\u2019s listed as a director at Pitch@Palace, the startup incubator founded by Prince Andrew back in 2014, according to the UK\u2019s Companies House Registry. Li, who is also known as Li Botan, runs a massive investment firm in China called Beijing Zhaode. He\u2019s the son-in-law of Jia Qinglin \u2014 the fourth-most senior leader in China before retiring in 2013, according to multiple news reports. (Pitch@Palace did not immediately respond to a request for comment, and both Stern and Li could not be reached for comment.)\n\nStefan Krause, who in the past served as CFO of both BMW and Deutsche Bank, pitched Stern and Li on the idea of funding an EV startup during a meeting in Hong Kong in October 2017, according to the complaint \u2014 the same month Stefan Krause resigned from his post as CFO of struggling EV startup Faraday Future. Following the meeting, Stefan Krause, Stern, and Li \u201centered into a gentlemen\u2019s agreement to start an electric vehicle company,\u201d according to the complaint, with Li and Stern \u201cprovid[ing] the necessary startup capital.\u201d\n\nOne investor works with Prince Andrew\u2019s startup accelerator; the other has ties to China\u2019s communist party\n\nThe lawsuit does not mention how much money Stern and Li gave to the startup, but it does state that Stefan Krause and fellow Faraday Future defector Ulrich Kranz (who also used to work at BMW) took annual salaries of $720,000 and were each granted 2.5 million shares of stock in the company. Other founding members made at least $260,000, according to the lawsuit.\n\nChristina Krause claims she was given an annual salary of $140,000 and a stock option to purchase just 12,000 shares in the company. She says she confronted Stefan Krause about how, unlike the other nine members of the company\u2019s initial team, she was not named a \u201cfounder.\u201d His response, she claims, was that \u201cshe was not qualified because her \u2018role wasn\u2019t critical for the building of the car.\u2019\u201d She also claims she was given less equity in the company because Stefan Krause told her they would \u201cshare all of his equity,\u201d and to ask for more \u201cwould be considered greedy.\u201d\n\nHave a tip?

Christina Krause claims Stefan Krause put increasing pressure on her to sign a postnuptial agreement, and she says he eventually accused her of \u201cplaying games\u201d by not immediately signing one.\n\nOn June 6th, 2019, Stefan Krause allegedly \u201creprimanded\u201d Christina Krause for sending an email to staff without running it by him. Later that day, when she emailed him seeking approval to hire a CEO of the company\u2019s China division, Stefan Krause allegedly responded by saying he \u201cjust resigned from my position so I will not get involved any longer.\u201d Christina Krause claims she then confronted her husband in person about this, only to hear him tell Stern on the phone that he was resigning because she refused to sign the postnuptial agreement. Over the next few days, he allegedly berated her and blamed her for forcing his resignation. As a result, Christina Krause says she went to a hotel for her own safety.\n\nKrause says she was pressured to sign a postnuptial before she allegedly discovered an affair\n\nOn or around June 11th, Christina Krause claims Stern pressured her to sign the postnuptial agreement over the phone, or else Stefan Krause wouldn\u2019t return to the company. She claims Kranz similarly pressured her that same week to \u201chonor the demands\u201d of her husband \u201cfor the sake of\u201d Canoo.\n\nOn June 14th, a Friday, Stefan Krause drove to Las Vegas to meet with Li. He allegedly told Christina Krause that he wouldn\u2019t make it home in time for Father\u2019s Day on Sunday and that he would miss a company celebration on Monday. Christina Krause says in the lawsuit that she found out that weekend that her husband was cheating on her.\n\nStefan Krause allegedly continued to exercise \u201ca level of oversight and control which had not existed prior to July 2019,\u201d and ultimately filed for divorce on July 8th, according to the complaint. Canoo then opened an internal investigation into Christina Krause in late July and, according to the complaint, hired a private investigator \u201cfor the purpose of following and documenting Plaintiff in conducting her private life, off of Canoo property and during non-work hours.\u201d Christina Krause says she was fired on July 31st and that she was granted a \u201cright-to-sue\u201d letter from the Department of Fair Employment and Housing on September 12th.\n\n\u201cAs the personal fiefdom of Defendant Stefan Krause, Defendant Canoo (formerly known as Evelozcity) terminated Plaintiff Christina Krause as an extension of Defendant Krause\u2019s estrangement from and infidelity to his wife of seven years,\u201d her lawyers write in the introduction to the complaint. \u201cCanoo scorned the legal rights of Plaintiff in order to assuage the ego of its man In Charge.\u201d", "description": "The California company is allegedly funded by businessmen linked to the British and Chinese governments.
