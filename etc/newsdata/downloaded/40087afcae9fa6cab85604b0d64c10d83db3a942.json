(Image: Pius Bak, Boom Studios)\n\nThe brand new Magicians comic isn\u2019t a direct adaptation of either Lev Grossman\u2019s beloved novels or their TV adaptation on Syfy \u2014 but a brand new story telling the tale of a generation of spellcasters long after Quentin and his friends have left Brakebills. And now you can see what they\u2019re up to a little early in our brand new preview.\n\nPenned by Lilah Sturgess and and Grossman himself \u2014 who previously collaborated on the Alice Quinn-centric retelling of the novels for the miniseries, Alice\u2019s Story \u2014 and with art by Pius Bak, the new series, simply titled The Magicians, is set after the events of the novels.\n\nItching for new students, Dean Fogg recruits an unorthodox group of young spellcasters to be the next class at Brakebills College for Magical Pedagogy: a selection of hedge witches, rogue magicians in the society of the series who practice unsanctioned magics.\n\nThe full cover for The Magicians #1.
