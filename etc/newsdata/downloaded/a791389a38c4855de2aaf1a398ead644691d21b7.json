The Continent heads into a new decade with its economy stalling, an unpredictable American ally to the west and a rising China and hostile Russia on its Eastern horizons. The political aftershocks of a four-year-old refugee crisis continue to be felt and next up \u2013 with breaths held world-wide \u2014 is the departure of Britain from the elite multinational club by Oct. 31, or maybe not.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nVon der Leyen last month signaled her ambitions for Brussels in an aggressive policy plan, first revealed by POLITICO. The former German defense minister and the first woman to hold the job of European Commission president wants the EU to counter President Donald Trump on trade policy and fight off competition from American and Chinese tech giants, while pitching Brussels as the world\u2019s \"guardian of multilateralism.\"\n\nTo help her get there, von der Leyen has created three new \u201cexecutive vice president\u201d positions for climate, digital and economic issues. She has created, for the first time, a department to oversee defense and space policy \u2014 which may be seen in Washington as a challenge to the U.S.-led NATO alliance.\n\nOf the 14 men and 12 women on Tuesday charged with realizing that vision, 18 are first-time commissioners. And if the past is any judge, many will have minimal impact beyond their narrow portfolios. But for the world beyond the Brussels bubble, who matters most is best summed up by three V\u2019s and a Phil.\n\nPhil is for Phil Hogan, an Irish farmer who has battled to modernize the EU\u2019s agriculture policy and now takes on trade policy. In addition to antitrust, this is the one area where the EU yields most direct power. He\u2019ll be a regular in Washington, pushing back on the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to weaken the World Trade Organization, which the Europeans see as a pillar of the trade order. He\u2019ll also be looking to add to the EU\u2019s list of more than 60 countries with which it has trade agreements.\n\nBesides the German in the biggest chair in Brussels, the V\u2019s include Valdis Dombrovskis, a former Latvian prime minister \u2014 high on technocratic know-how and low on charisma \u2014 who retains his previous portfolio overseeing financial regulation and indirectly a big say over economic policy. (The real economic power player is the head of the European Central Bank, pending her likely confirmation by Parliament in Brussels, the Frenchwoman and current International Monetary Fund chief, Christine Lagarde.)\n\nThe other V is arguably the biggest star on scene here: Margarethe Vestager, A.K.A. Silicon Valley\u2019s biggest nightmare. Or, as Trump once called her, \"tax lady\" (not a compliment), after she sent Apple a $14 billion bill.\n\nAs the EU\u2019s competition chief from 2014 until now, Vestager led the charge against big tech over alleged antitrust violations (Google, Amazon), tax evasion (Apple) and privacy (Facebook).\n\nStarting in November, Vestager will keep her competition cop job and gain new powers as an executive vice president to do what it takes to get \u201cEurope fit for the digital age.\u201d\n\nA key challenge in Vestager\u2019s quest to rein in alleged tech excess will be her ability to form strategic relationships with U.S. antitrust authorities.\n\nOn their own, Vestager\u2019s fines and merger decisions are now priced into shareholder calculations around the world. Shareholders think even a multi-billion-dollar fine is a slap on the wrist for the largest tech companies that does little to fundamentally alter business models or profit margins. Only stronger transatlantic coordination and EU or U.S. court-ordered company break-ups are likely to shift that dynamic.\n\nBesides Hogan and Vestager, the European who\u2019ll spend the most time in Washington will be the continent\u2019s firebrand foreign policy chief, the Spaniard Josep Borrell.\n\nThe most contentious file in U.S.-EU relations today is Iran. After Trump pulled out of the Obama-era nuclear deal and reimposed sanctions on Tehran, the Europeans have struggled to keep the agreement alive \u2014 with little to show for it. The Europeans have also proved reluctant to embrace America\u2019s more hawkish approach to Beijing.\n\nIn a not so subtle jab at the Trump administration, von der Leyen also promised a \u201cEuropean Green Deal,\u201d putting Frans Timmermans, a social democrat and the current No. 2 at the outgoing Commission in charge of it. Using language that could come straight from the playbook of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the center-right von der Leyen said, \"At the heart of it is our commitment to becoming the world's first climate-neutral continent. I want Europe to be the front-runner.\"\n\nOther prominent women in the new Commission include V\u011bra Jourov\u00e1, of the Czech Republic, who will be in charge of managing rule of law concerns that have persistently cropped up in\n\nEastern Europe in recent years, and Sylvie Goulard, a former French defense minister and negotiator of German reunification in the 1990s, who will be commissioner for the internal market and a new defense and space department. Dubravka \u0160uica, a former mayor of Dobrovnik in Croatia, will be vice president for democracy and demography, while Kadri Simson, of Estonia, will serve as energy commissioner.\n\nThe selection of Jourov\u00e1, representing one of the Visegrad Four nations of Central and Eastern Europe, carries special significance given still-simmering tensions between Brussels and two of the V4, Poland and Hungary. The two countries have been accused of undermining core EU principles on rule of law and democracy. Each country is led by a right-wing ruler whom the Trump administration views as a close ally in Europe. While both in recent months have tried to paper over disagreements with Brussels, the potential for flare-ups remains high.\n\nSee the full list of commissioners here.", "description": "Most notable for Silicon Valley and Washington: Danish antitrust cop gets a promotion.", "authors": ["David Herszenhorn"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/74/3e/db3216ed4beabe3a8cea931fc897/190910-ursula-von-der-leyen-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
