On that day, there was a 1-in-1,000 chance of collision between one of SpaceX's new Starlink internet satellites and the ESA's wind-monitoring Aeolus spacecraft.\n\nThe ESA decided to fire a thruster on Aeolus and avoid risking a hit, but there will inevitably and always be more close calls in the future \u2014 and sometimes deliberate incidents, such as India's satellite shoot-down in May \u2014 that generate countless tiny pieces of space junk.\n\nThe US government tracks about 23,000 human-made objects floating in space that are larger than a softball. These satellites and chunks of debris zip around the planet at more than 17,500 mph \u2014 roughly 10 times the speed of a bullet. Until April 1, the list of space junk even included China's school-bus-size Tiangong-1 space station, which burned up in Earth's atmosphere.\n\nHowever, there are millions of smaller pieces of space junk\u2014 sometimes called micrometeoroids \u2014 orbiting Earth, too.\n\n\"There's lots of smaller stuff we can see but can't put an orbit, a track on it,\" Jesse Gossner, an orbital-mechanics engineer who teaches at the US Air Force's Advanced Space Operations School, told Business Insider in 2018.\n\nAs companies and government agencies launch more spacecraft, concerns are growing about the likelihood of a \" Kessler syndrome\" event: a cascading series of orbital collisions that may curtail human access to space for hundreds of years.\n\nHere's who is keeping tracking of space junk, how satellite collisions are avoided, and what is being done to prevent disaster on the final frontier.\n\nThis story has been updated.
