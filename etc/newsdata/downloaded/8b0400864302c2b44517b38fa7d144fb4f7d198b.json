Two hours later police detained nine of the foundation\u2019s members in different corners of the Russian capital.\n\nDuring the raid Navalny, famous for his cool resistance and extraordinary stamina, took a video of his team\u2019s lawyers playing soccer in the office, as if nothing unusual was happening. In the past decade Russian authorities have put Navalny behind bars dozens of times for hundreds of days.\n\nNavalny has risked his life in a political environment where many opponents and critics of President Vladimir Putin have been killed or died under suspicious circumstances. Last month somebody tried to shut him up in jail with a mysterious poison. Although Navalny and several other key opposition politicians spent weeks of their summer behind bars, thousands of protesters came out to the streets\u2014showing the movement could live without leaders. Random Moscow residents demanded fair and free elections and an end to political repression. People marched on Moscow\u2019s streets chanting: \u201cRussia will be free!\u201d\n\nIn an interview with The Daily Beast earlier this year Navalny said, \u201cWe are fearless and unstoppable, no matter how harsh the pressure is from Putin\u2019s thuggish government.\u201d\n\nIf Navalny is calm and stable, Russian authorities have demonstrated hysterical behavior during the weeks of the election campaign: nearly every weekend police grabbed thousands of peaceful protesters at anti-government rallies, threatening children and parents, releasing some political prisoners and locking up others for long terms.\n\n\u201cThis is the most chaotic and messy strategy; obviously Russian authorities miscalculated the opposition\u2019s explosive potential force,\u201d Tanya Lokshina, associate director for Human Rights Watch\u2019s Europe and Central Asia division, told The Daily Beast. \u201cNearly every weekend police units block Moscow streets for pedestrians and injure dozens of peaceful people, who exercise their constitutional right; at least five opposition activists have been sentenced to shockingly long terms--two, three, four years in prison.\u201d\n\nAn estimated 30 percent of Moscow\u2019s protesters are young people, age 20 to 35, many of them are students at Russia\u2019s best universities, and the opposition student movement is growing, participants sign letters demanding to free political prisoners, collect money for defense lawyers, organize peaceful rallies and discussions.\n\n\u201cWe are a positive movement, our main strength is solidarity, we are sincere, we unite against indifference, cynicism and the unfairness of government actions,\u201d 21-year-old student Nikita Ponarin told The Daily Beast on Friday.\n\nPonarin is in his fourth year at the Higher School of Economics, one of Russia\u2019s leading state universities. He studies political science and as with many well-educated young Russians is critical of the Kremlin\u2019s politics.\n\nDay after day before the elections municipal services wash Moscow\u2019s central streets with soap, paint fa\u00e7ades of the buildings, fix roofs and install fancy street lighting while police grab the future Russian professional, the new generation of liberal politicians all over these streets.\n\n\u201cWe have no lack of access to information about the wars in Ukraine or Syria, we are not afraid of fines or dozens of days in jail as punishment for our participation in protests; but we are concerned about long prison terms,\u201d Ponarin admitted to The Daily Beast.\n\nWhile police raided Navalny\u2019s office on Thursday night, a Moscow court sentenced one more opposition activist, 34-year-old IT specialist Konstantin Kotov to four years in prison for participating in several unsanctioned protests this year. Hundreds of people chanted Freedom for Kotov! Freedom for political prisoners! Russia will be free!\u201d outside of the court at a spontaneous protest.\n\n\u201cThe Russian Constitutional Court ruled that peaceful protesters should not be put in jail even for a minute, if they do not constitute a threat to society and yet they sentenced Kotov to a shockingly long term, four years in prison,\u201d Lokshina told The Daily Beast after examining the court\u2019s verdict.\n\nEarlier this week police detained our colleague Ilya Azar, a journalist for the independent Novaya Gazeta , right outside of the unlocked door to his apartment. Just like Kotov, Azar was accused of attending unsanctioned protests. The journalist explained to police that his 2-year-old daughter was alone in the apartment but the state officials did not want to hear anything about any private issues and took Azar away from his baby. When Azar\u2019s wife arrived half an hour later, the door to the flat was unlocked. Luckily, the baby girl was sleeping peacefully.\n\nBy arresting peaceful activists, Russian authorities risk turning politically passive citizens into opponents who will be joining rallies to demand their constitutional right.\n\nUniversity students refer to this strategy as \u201cshortsighted,\u201d and Russian lawmakers appear oblivious to their domestic mistakes. Instead, a special commission has been created to look for foreign enemies to blame for the protests.\n\nA member of the State Duma, or parliament, Vadim Dengin, said he still suspected the West, especially the United States and Germany, of helping to develop the growing anti-Putin movement.\n\n\u201cSomebody helped the opposition to create professionally made banners like \u2018Moscow, come out!\u2019 Just imagine something like \u2018Washington, come out!\u2019\" Dengin said. \u201cRussian domestic politics is only Russia\u2019s affairs. Nobody has a right to call for the change of power, a revolution. Soon we\u2019ll publish the documents to show who was behind the revolt.\u201d\n\n(Americans concerned about the well-documented Russian interference in U.S. politics will no doubt see the irony in these claims.)\n\nBy now every small and big bureaucrat working at the Kremlin\u2019s administration and Moscow city hall must realize that no arrests, no threats can put an end to the anti-Putin rallies and to the newly emerging political class.\n\nFor 15 days before the Moscow elections, Navalny\u2019s Anti-Corruption Foundation had been publishing reports about shadowy schemes plotted by President Vladimir Putin\u2019s federal and municipal government members.\n\nThe latest investigative reports came out on Friday, just a few hours after police confiscations and detentions at Navalny\u2019s office.\n\nIn one simple illustration Navalny showed photographs of Alexander Beglov, the acting governor of St.Petersburg, wearing watches worth more than an average Russian\u2019s annual salary, 10 million Rubles ($15,127). Navalny wondered where Beglov found money to buy the unaffordable-for-any-bureaucrat timepieces. Or, hm, did Beglov take the watches as bribes?\n\nNavalny\u2019s team also explained the anatomy of corruption at Moscow\u2019s mayoral office, including dubious real estate schemes for more than $100 million. The corruption fighters showed Moscow Deputy Mayor Natalya Sergunina\u2019 five huge residences, giving details of offshore real estate deals registered on Sergunina\u2019s sister, husband Lazar Safaniyev and Safaniyev\u2019s British and Austrian companies.\n\n\u201cHonest, competent people should be managing Moscow but they will never appear if we are going to sit on the couch,\u201d the report concluded. \u201cWe have neither a right to voluntarily give up on Moscow city hall, nor on St. Petersburg municipality or any other institution with power.\u201d", "description": "Days before rigged municipal elections that have spurred growing protests, a raid on Putin\u2019s most high-file opponent may well backfire.", "authors": ["Anna Nemtsova"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1567802375/190906-Nemtsova-Moscow-tease_edf9xw", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
