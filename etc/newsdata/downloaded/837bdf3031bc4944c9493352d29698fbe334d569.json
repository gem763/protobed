There is no evidence that any of the approximately 1,000 American troops preparing to evacuate from Syria have been fired on by Syrian government forces led by President Bashar Assad. A small group of U.S. troops came under Turkish artillery fire near the town of Kobani last week, without anyone being injured, but there is no indication that Syrian troops have shot at the withdrawing Americans. Also, Biden was addressing the situation in Syria, not Iraq.\n\n___\n\nPETE BUTTIGIEG: \"We are at the cusp of building a new American majority to actually do things that congressmen and senators have been talking about for my entire life \u2014 on guns, we are this close to an assault weapons ban, that would be huge.\"\n\nTHE FACTS: No, the U.S. is not close to enacting an assault-weapons ban. Congress is not on the verge of passing one. Prospects for such a ban are bound to remain slim until the next election at least.\n\nLegislation under discussion in the Senate would expand background checks for gun sales, a politically popular idea even with gun owners. But even that bill has stalled because of opposition from the National Rifle Association and on-again, off-again support from Trump. Democrats and some Republicans in Congress say they will continue to push for the background checks bill, but movement appears unlikely during an impeachment inquiry and general dysfunction in Congress. And Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has made it clear he won't move forward on gun legislation without Trump's strong support.\n\nButtigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, was citing the chance for an assault-weapons ban as a reason for not supporting the more radical proposal by Democratic presidential rival Beto O'Rourke to force gun owners to give up AR-15's and other assault-style weapons. But the ban is not coming together as he stated.\n\n___\n\nKAMALA HARRIS: \"Five million assault weapons are on the streets of America today.\"\n\nTHE FACTS: The California senator's statistic on the number of AR- and AK-style firearms is not accurate. Even the gun industry estimates there are now 16 million \"assault weapons\" in circulation in the United States today. In 1994, President Bill Clinton enacted an assault weapons ban, at a time when there were an estimated 1.5 million of them in circulation. Current owners were allowed to keep them, however, and once the ban expired a decade later, sales resumed and boomed.\n\n___\n\nELIZABETH WARREN: \"The data show that we've had a lot of problems with losing jobs, but the principal reason has been bad trade policy. The principal reason has been a bunch of corporations, giant multinational corporations who've been calling the shots on trade.\"\n\nTHE FACTS: Economists mostly blame those job losses on automation and robots, not trade deals.\n\nSo the Massachusetts senator is off.\n\nLet's start by acknowledging that the U.S. economy has been adding jobs, just that the nature of those jobs has changed as factory work and other occupations have become less prevalent.\n\nTrade with China has contributed to shuttered factories and the loss of roughly 2 million jobs, according to research published in 2014.\n\nBut the primary culprit that accounted for 88% of factory job losses between 2000 and 2010 was automation, according to researchers at Ball State University.\n\nThere is also a bigger threat from automation for workers outside factories. These are secretaries, bookkeepers and a wide array of professions. Automation can displace these workers and put downward pressure on their wages, forcing them to find other jobs.\n\n___\n\nWARREN: Buttigieg's Medicare buy-in option is \"Medicare for all who can afford it.\"\n\nTHE FACTS: Warren ignored the fact that Buttigieg would provide subsidies to help people pay premiums for the plan.\n\nShe was jabbing at Buttigieg's proposal to create an optional health insurance plan based on Medicare. Individual Americans could join it, even those covered by employer plans.", "description": "There is no evidence that any of the approximately 1,000 American troops preparing to evacuate from Syria have been fired on by Syrian government forces led by President Bashar Assad.
