The new trailers \u2014 a red and green band spot \u2014 give us a good look at the film\u2019s plot, and presents a much better feeling than the first trailer did.\n\nThe film is a reboot of the film franchise, with The Descent and Game of Thrones director Neil Marshall helming the project, featuring Stranger Things\u2019 David Harbour as the movie\u2019s titular demon. The new trailers outline what we can expect for the plot of the film, and covers some of the familiar beats of Hellboy\u2019s origin story. During World War II, Hellboy was summoned from Hell by Nazis looking for an edge in the later days of the war. He was instead adopted by the US, and raised under the auspices of the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense, an agency designed to help fend off paranormal threats.\n\nIt\u2019s one of those threats Hellboy finds himself embroiled in: a sorceress, Nimue the Queen of Blood, has risen, and is threatening to Thanos London \u2014 turning everyone to dust to do something evil. The story draws from a broad arc of Hellboy comics \u2014 Darkness Calls, The Storm and the Fury, and The Wild Hunt. Along the way, she appeals to Hellboy\u2019s demonic side, trying to get him to join her and to fulfill his destiny as a ruler of Hell.\n\nThe first trailer for the film debuted in December, and didn\u2019t instill a lot of confidence: set to Billy Idol\u2019s song \u201cMony Mony,\u201d it showed off Harbour\u2019s take on Hellboy, as well as Professor Bruttenholm (played by Ian McShane) and BPRD agent Ben Daimio (Daniel Dae Kim). But the trailer didn\u2019t feel like it was really showing off a film that\u2019s been billed as a hard-R film, let alone the Lovecraftian vibe that the original comic has.\n\nThat first rough impression is not great for a franchise that already being skeptically viewed by Hellboy fans, who have long wanted a third installment of the series directed by Guillermo del Toro, featuring Ron Perlman as Hellboy. del Toro wanted to complete his trilogy, but as years passed between installments, interest shifted to other takes on the franchise, ultimately leading to this reboot. Earlier this week, Harbour spoke with Empire about the role, saying that he didn\u2019t want to \u201cimitate\u201d Pearlman\u2019s take on the character, and noted that in this film, \u201cHellboy\u2019s younger. He\u2019s rougher. He\u2019s much more of a teenager. He\u2019s really struggling with the idea of whether or not he\u2019s a good person.\u201d\n\nBoth trailers, but especially the red-band trailer shows off quite a bit more blood and gore, as well as some of Hellboy\u2019s sarcastic humor. It feels far more in line with the original comics, even if it doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s quite got the same design and feel of del Toro\u2019s original films.\n\nHellboy hits theaters on April 12th, 2019.", "description": "Lionsgate films has released a pair of new trailers for its upcoming reboot of Mike Mignola\u2019s classic comic, Hellboy.
