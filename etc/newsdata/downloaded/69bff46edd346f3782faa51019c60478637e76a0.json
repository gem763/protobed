The bloc's decision will be formalised \"through a written procedure,\" Tusk said, meaning that there will be no leaders' summit.\n\nThe EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, told reporters the diplomats' meeting was \"very short, effective and constructive\" as he left the room.\n\nThe extension gives the British parliament plenty of time to debate Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Brexit deal. Mr Johnson will also continue try to push for an early election having pledged to take Britain out of the EU on October 31 \"do or die\".\n\nEU member states will now wait for Britain's reply before launching a \"written procedure\" whereby governments will have 24 hours to accept or reject the agreement reached by their envoys to Brussels. \"This will allow the decision to be formally adopted tomorrow,\" an EU diplomat said.", "description": "Britain has been granted an extension to its departure from the EU through to January 31, Donald Tusk said on Twitter.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3347%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_316%2C$y_192/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/34c40ddd9ca6f9a47773bb94f42aaa4740a524d9", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
