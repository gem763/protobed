One caller on Monday asked about New Relic Inc. (NEWR) . \"I'm reluctant to recommend it,\" Cramer said. Let's check out the charts for this provider of enterprise software.\n\nIn this daily bar chart of NEWR, below, we can see that the stock price began to struggle in February. Prices rallied to a new high for the move up and volume did not materially expand. Chart readers like to see more participation and increased volume when a stock makes new highs. This was not the case with NEWR.\n\nThe daily On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line declined into April, telling us that sellers of NEWR became more aggressive. Prices rallied back to the highs in May but could not break through despite a rise in the OBV line. From early May the chart unraveled further and finally in early August prices gapped sharply lower. Prices have stabilized in recent weeks but they are still below the declining 50-day moving average line and the bearish 200-day line. The OBV line remains depressed and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator is turning down below the zero line again for another sell signal.\n\nIn this weekly bar chart of NEWR, below, we can see that prices are testing old support from 2017 in the $50 area. Unfortunately the farther back in history you go the less reliable a potential support or resistance area becomes; investors have had a long time to change their positions and therefore may not react to those prices. NEWR is trading below the declining 40-week moving average line. The weekly OBV line has been in a decline from June 2018 so there has been a lot of selling under the bridge, so to speak. The MACD oscillator has narrowed but it has not crossed to the upside for a cover shorts signal.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of NEWR, below, we can see the downside gap is gone and a potential upside price target of $71 is projected. A trade at $65.43 is needed to refresh the upside and open the way to possible further gains.\n\nBottom line strategy: NEWR has not made much of a base after its big decline. The Point and Figure chart suggests we might get back to $71, but my experience with stocks that get crushed is that we need to see more sideways price action and quiet buying before we try the upside again.
