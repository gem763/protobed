As Lorenzo Reyes details, the league's elite class is starting to crystalize. USA TODAY\n\nThe Los Angeles Chargers are making a change to their coaching staff.\n\nThe Chargers fired offensive coordinator Ken Whisenhunt on Monday night.\n\nThe move to get rid of Whisenhunt came from left field, but it was the right decision from the team moving forward.\n\nLos Angeles is currently averaging 19.6 points per game, 350.6 total offensive yards, 281.1 passing yards per game and 69.5 rushing yards per game.\n\nThe Chargers have not scored more than 20 points in a game in the last month. Along with that, they became the first team in Super Bowl era to rush for under 40 yards in four consecutive games.\n\nThe Chargers had 36 yards on the ground in their 17-16 victory over the Chicago Bears, marking their fourth straight game with less than 40 yards rushing.\n\nAccording to Pro Football Reference, it\u2019s the third time since 1940 that a team\u2019s ground game has been that ineffective for that long. The prior two are the 1946 Detroit Lions and 1944 Card-Pitt, a combined Chicago Cardinals-Pittsburgh Steelers team due to World War II.\n\nWhisenhunt joined the team as the offensive coordinator in 2013. He left in 2014 to serve as the head coach for the Titans and two years later returned to resume as the offensive coordinator in Mike McCoy's final tenure with the Chargers.\n\n\"This is not an easy decision and definitely not one that I take lightly,\" head coach Anthony Lynn said in a statement released by the team. \"You win as a team, and you lose as a team. It's never about just one person. At the end of the day, however, I simply felt a change was needed at this time. I want to thank Ken for his years of service to the Chargers organization and wish him nothing but the best moving forward.\"\n\nContributing: The Associated Press.\n\nFollow Chargers Wire's Gavino Borquez on Twitter @GavinoBorquez.\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.
