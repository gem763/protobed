Still, swells generated by Humberto will affect the U.S. coast from central Florida to North Carolina during the next few day with \"life-threatening surf and rip current conditions,\" the Hurricane Center warned.\n\n\"Regardless of the exact track or development, Floridians along the East Coast should be prepared for heavy rain and potential flooding, have supplies ready and follow local media for updates,\" Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said.\n\nHumberto could threaten Bermuda on Wednesday or Thursday, AccuWeather said.\n\nPeople walk next to a shattered and water-filled coffin lays exposed to the elements in the aftermath of Hurricane Dorian, at the cemetery in Mclean's Town, Grand Bahama, Bahamas, Friday Sept. 13, 2019. More\n\nIn the Bahamas, Great Abaco and Grand Bahama islands are still reeling from Hurricane Dorian. Thousands of homes and businesses were flooded and flattened two weeks ago, when the storm blasted through the region as a Category 5 behemoth blamed for at least 50 deaths.\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres visited Great Abaco on Saturday, rallying humanitarian workers and blaming climate change for the severity of storms in recent years.\n\n\"I\u2019m horrified by the level of devastation,\" he tweeted from the island. \"I\u2019ve never seen anything like this. #HurricaneDorian was not category 5, but category hell.\"\n\nSome rescue and aid efforts, suspended when Humberto threatened, were back to work Sunday. Tens of thousands of residents remain essentially homeless, more than 1,000 remain missing, and thousands have taken to social media in a frantic attempt to track down loved ones.\n\nAuthorities warn the death toll could rise sharply in coming days as recovery teams continue to pick through devastated neighborhoods. Bahamian Prime Minister Hubert Minnis said the searches were a priority and that his government, with the help of international aid teams, was working feverishly to update the status of the missing.\n\n\u201cWe will first and foremost put the priority on notifying families and giving them the help they need to grieve,\u201d Minnis said.\n\nCalling Dorian a \"historic tragedy,\" Minnis designated Wednesday a day of National Day of Prayer and Fasting. Flags will be flown at half-staff on public buildings to mourn those killed in the storm.\n\n\u201cWe are a nation in mourning,\u201d Minnis said. \u201cWe will need as many spiritual resources as we will need physical resources, to rebuild lives and to recover.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Tropical Storm Humberto steers clear of Hurricane Dorian-ravaged Bahamas", "description": "Residents and rescue workers breathe sigh of relief; Florida coast also appears to be in the clear from impacts of Tropical Storm Humberto.", "authors": ["John Bacon", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/DvBbwpmww0pM1zl4rZxZng--~B/aD00MzIwO3c9NjQ4MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/30753e8e044425a3d2f33825c17fac6d", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
