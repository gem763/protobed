We\u2019re pretty excited about where it\u2019s potentially going to go.\n\n\u201cAgain, like we said, it\u2019s going to feel very different than this season. But I think that\u2019s the right thing to do and I think it\u2019ll be exciting.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s all well and good. Now it\u2019s time to over-analyse this little clip until a new trailer rolls your way.", "description": "The good news is the Netflix show is coming back; the bad news is everything else.", "authors": ["David Adams"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/07/stranger-things-s3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
