Mark A. Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters during a briefing Monday that the dog \u201cperformed a tremendous service\u201d and was \u201cslightly wounded\u201d but is now \u201cfully recovering.\u201d\n\nPENTAGON SAYS MILITARY DOG INJURED IN AL-BAGHDADI RAID 'FULLY RECOVERING'\n\nHOW ISIS LEADER AL-BAGHDADI\u2019S HEADLESS BODY WAS ID\u2019D MINUTES AFTER DEATH\n\nThe dog has \u201creturned to duty\u201d and is back \u201cwith its handler,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump first revealed Sunday that military dogs chased al-Baghdadi down a dark underground tunnel before the terrorist leader detonated a suicide vest.\n\nDefense Secretary Mark Esper, along with Milley, held the briefing Monday to discuss details of the raid, saying no U.S. troops were killed in the operation.
