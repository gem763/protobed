And a scan on Sunday has revealed he suffered a twisted ankle rather than ligament damage.\n\nThe forward will now undergo treatment at Melwood during the international break in the hope of being available for the next Premier League game at Manchester United.\n\nLiverpool are offering no guidance as to whether he will be fit for that fixture, but the fact he is not being ruled out is a positive sign as the club seeks to match a national record of 18 consecutive league victories.", "description": "Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp can breathe a sigh of relief as initial scans on Mohamed Salah\u2019s ankle injury show no serious damage.", "authors": ["Chris Bascombe", "Alan Tyers", "Luke Edwards"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/07/TELEMMGLPICT000212093157-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqA1OSm6rjnnMUazHmmk33xTWKN9pu_CxF4btKZgm1wsg.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
