Bustiers. Garters. Corsets. All of these were on full display in a show that took place in a dark room punctuated by dramatic columns of white light. The show was titled: \u201cSeduction. Layering to Reveal. Done and Undone.\u201d\n\nColors were mainly black, gray, white and metallic - but, typically of Wang, mostly black. Charmeuse, silk, lace and tulle were in abundance.\n\n\u201cCalifornia Dreamin\u2019\u201d was on the soundtrack, and that\u2019s what was on Wang\u2019s mind, too, she said, as she developed her collection, though to others there was a distinct Victorian feel as well.\n\n\u201cIt was a California dream, yeah, sexy, underwear, layering, things falling off,\u201d she said in an interview backstage. \u201cAlso, girls falling off their shoes,\u201d she quipped of some models\u2019 mishaps involving impossibly long skirts and spiky high heels. \u201cThat I didn\u2019t plan on, but it happened.\u201d\n\nRealizing her vision \u201cwas wonderful because it was very much the mood I was in,\u201d Wang said. \u201cYou know as a designer you feel what\u2019s going on around you, at least I do, culturally. It isn\u2019t just an isolated exercise. So I really wanted that hippie hair and LA attitude, but the clothes were definitely couture.\u201d\n\nFor the last two years, Wang had presented her collections via films but decided to return to a staged show this season.\n\n\u201cFilm is very different than staging 45 girls, and fittings,\u201d she noted, adding that \u201cthe level of clothing that we make and show is very couture. It\u2019s not meant to be contemporary or ready-to-wear, it\u2019s really about the craft of creating, incredible workmanship.\u201d\n\nShe credited her team: \u201cNo matter what I dream, if they can\u2019t sew it, it\u2019s not real,\u201d she said.\n\nAlso not real, hopefully? That clump of hair Wang scooped up from the floor as she came out for her bow, to applause from guests that included Zendaya and Vanessa Hudgens.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "After a two-year break, Vera Wang returned to the New York Fashion Week runway on Tuesday with a moody and visually arresting show that featured high-couture lingerie elements, hippie hair, and heels so spiky that some models struggled to stay on their feet.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jocelyn Noveck"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/10/fashion_vera_wang_34341_c0-241-5760-3599_s1770x1032.jpg?5744a6e428d626295d3fe14d6d300f488e16a9a8", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
