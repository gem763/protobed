You\u2019ve got to find time for both your work responsibilities and your non-work responsibilities, plus time for the people you care about and the communities you support, plus time for rest and recuperation, plus time for that big creative project you\u2019re working on.\n\nWhere do the hours come from?\n\nDerek Sivers, who is either best known for being the creator of CD Baby or for giving us the \u201cit\u2019s either a hell yeah, or it\u2019s a no\u201d decision-making framework, thinks you have to steal them:\n\nIt takes many hours to make what you want to make. The hours don\u2019t suddenly appear. You have to steal them from comfort. Whatever you were doing before was comfortable. This is not. This will be really uncomfortable.\n\nSivers is referring specifically to the types of comfortable distractions that can eat up more of our day than we realise: social media, television shows, aimless online scrolling, and so on. He isn\u2019t saying \u201cdon\u2019t spend any time relaxing\u201d; Sivers is simply noting that in many cases we\u2019re taking the \u201ccomfortable\u201d option of consuming other people\u2019s creative output instead of the \u201cuncomfortable\u201d option of making our own.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s also worth noting that we can steal these hours from discomfort. There are many, many ways of optimising, automating, or even eliminating the time-consuming grunt work that sucks up so much of our days \u2014 and you just happen to be on one of the best sites for learning more about these so-called \u201clife hacks.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m currently drafting a novel, and I decided to steal two hours every weekday for this particular project: one hour in the early morning and one hour immediately after work. The first hour was stolen from comfort; I had to wake up earlier, which meant figuring out how to get the same amount of quality sleep in a slightly shorter time frame. This meant setting shutdown timers on my laptop to ensure I wasn\u2019t \u201cdoing internet\u201d right before bed, dimming the lights and lowering the temperature prior to bedtime to support my body\u2019s circadian rhythm, and so on.\n\nAs a related benefit, I\u2019m sleeping more soundly, with fewer middle-of-the-night wake-ups, than I have in a long time.\n\nThe second hour was stolen from discomfort. To claim a full hour between the end of my workday and my evening commitments meant learning how to optimise work tasks, avoid distractions, and take effective breaks \u2014 because good breaks and good work sessions go together like online grocery delivery and meal planning, which is another way I steal hours for my creative work.\n\nAs before, there are a lot of additional benefits that came from this type of lifehacking. I\u2019m getting more work done in less time, for starters. I\u2019m also literally experiencing less discomfort \u2014 I rarely have that sluggish, gross \u201cI can\u2019t believe I spent the last hour scrolling past a bunch of stuff that I don\u2019t even remember, and I still haven\u2019t solved the problem in front of me\u201d feeling, for example.\n\nI know my personal life hacks aren\u2019t going to work for everybody. (I\u2019m a freelancer who lives alone, so I have a huge amount of control over both my schedule and my environment.) But if you want to spend more time doing creative work \u2014 or doing anything, really \u2014 you\u2019re going to have to spend less time doing something else, and that means deciding when and how to steal back a few hours.\n\nFind the times when you\u2019re either mindlessly comfortable or frustratingly uncomfortable, and start there.", "description": "Work-life balance for creative types is more like work-work-life.
