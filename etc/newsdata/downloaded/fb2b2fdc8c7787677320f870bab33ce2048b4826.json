Tip sheets like Politico\u2019s Playbook and Axios lead the day with accounts of the president\u2019s erratic behavior, while newspapers like The New York Times and The Washington Post have made a veritable genre of the president-has-lost-his-damn-mind story. We know how this story goes: He has shut himself off in the residence, live-tweeting as he flips through cable news channels. He rages at cabinet officials and aides. He muses about some barbaric remedy for undocumented immigration, or the U.S. military nuking hurricanes. And he is obsessed with conspiracy theories about the Deep State\u2019s campaign to bring him down.\n\n\n\nTrump entered office promising he would be the \u201cmost transparent president in history\u201d and he has, in a weird way, kept that promise: His administration has been defined by an endless torrent of leaks that reveal both critical information (such as his phone calls with foreign leaders) and juicy tidbits about the president\u2019s mental and emotional state.\n\n\n\nThe author of A Warning promises to be above such tawdry gossip. Their 2018 op-ed made the case that they were part of a loose-knit group of bureaucrats out to protect the country from a mad king. They were doing their part \u201cthwarting Mr. Trump\u2019s more misguided impulses until he is out of office.\u201d But the op-ed itself is really a well-worn list of criticisms of the president: He is \u201cimmoral\u201d and \u201cengages in repetitive rants, and his impulsiveness results in half-baked, ill-informed, and occasionally reckless decisions that have to be walked back.\u201d\n\n\n\nWolff and Woodward depicted the exact same dynamic over the course of three books. (Anonymous\u2019s portrait of a group of civil servants dedicated to thwarting the president\u2019s most destructive impulses fits neatly with Woodward\u2019s portrait of a White House in which aides were regularly hiding executive orders from the president.) Far from being a unique insight into a unique presidency, A Warning\u2019s best-case scenario is to be a fourth installment in what has become a series of long narratives about the president\u2019s daily misdeeds. If Anonymous has a Ukraine-like bombshell to drop, why don\u2019t they report it up the chain, as the whistleblower did, instead of writing a book about it?\n\n\n\nMuch of the discussion about A Warning has focused on the financial dimensions of Anonymous\u2019s book deal with Twelve Books, an imprint of Hachette. The book, agent Matt Latimer told The Washington Post, could have fetched a seven-figure advance, but \u201cwas not written for financial reasons.\u201d Instead, its author would donate a \u201csubstantial amount of any royalties to the White House Correspondents Association and other organizations that fight for a free press that seeks the truth.\u201d\n\n", "description": "If the author of \u2018A Warning\u2019 wants to do some good, he could take some lessons from an actual whistleblower.", "authors": ["Alex Shephard"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/9b66555aaf880e451a1bbfa5825332844562c7a6.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
