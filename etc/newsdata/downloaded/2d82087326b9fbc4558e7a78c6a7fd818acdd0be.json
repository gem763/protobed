Qualifying coverage begins at 12pm BST and race coverage begins at 10.30am BST on Sunday.\n\nChannel 4 have highlights for this round, too. Their qualifying program begins at 6.30pm BST on Saturday with their race coverage starting at 6pm BST on Sunday.\n\nYou can also keep up to date throughout the race with Luke Slater right here at Telegraph Sport.\n\nWatch the Russian Grand Prix through Now TV for \u00a39.99.\n\nWhat do we know about the Sochi Autodrom?\n\nCircuit length: 5.848km\n\nFirst grand prix: 2014\n\nLaps: 53\n\nRace distance: 309.745km\n\nRace lap record: 1:35.861 (Valtteri Bottas, 2018)\n\n2018 winner: Lewis Hamilton, Mercedes\n\nNumber of corners: 18\n\nOvertaking chances: Well, reasonable I guess, with the couple of heavy braking zones. It's also quite a wide track in places and, if you get a good exit out of the right turn two, the long, long, long 180-degree turn three gives you a chance to go around the outside.\n\nWhat happened last year?\n\nLewis Hamilton had his luckiest victory of the year. Valtteri Bottas outclassed him all weekend but was told by his team to move over when leading to that Hamilton could maximise his championship points total. He was not very happy about it.\n\nWhat are the odds (top six)?\n\nStory continues\n\nLewis Hamilton 7/4\n\nCharles Leclerc 15/8\n\nSebastian Vettel 11/4\n\nValtteri Bottas 5/1\n\nMax Verstappen 25/1\n\nAlexander Albon 100/1\n\nWhat is our prediction?\n\nBottas is the boss at this track (well, were he not asked to make way for Hamilton last year...) and has never been out-qualified by a team-mate. He took his maiden victory here in 2017 and should have won last year, too. Mercedes have never been beaten here, either. But with Ferrari's surprisingly good performance in Singapore they could put up a fight here, too. It will be the true test of their upgrades. We think they will be close, but not quite close enough to stop one Mercedes winning. Which one? Hamilton.\n\nPodium prediction: 1st Hamilton 2nd Leclerc 3rd Bottas", "description": "The 2019 Russian Grand Prix at the Sochi Autodrom, the 16th\u00a0race of the 2019 Formula One season.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/WKlTOqlqK7Wcrkg2xBFpqg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04MDA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/y5GHEi5__GxAi7r29kNhaQ--~B/aD0xNTYzO3c9MjUwMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/4e6c434e15e01290df6777b358c6eb1f", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
