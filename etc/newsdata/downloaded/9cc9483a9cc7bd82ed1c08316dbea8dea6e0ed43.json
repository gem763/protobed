However, the album never appeared and no explanation was given for the delay.\n\nEarlier this week, a new date of 25 October was announced. After the album again failed to appear, West posted on Twitter to say he was adding final touches to certain songs on the album.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe album has now been released and is available on major streaming services including Spotify, Apple Music and Amazon.\n\nFollow our liveblog for the latest updates\n\nTrack 8: \"God Is\" I recognise that voice. A super soulful intro to this track, nice backing instrumentation which hasn't been the focus until now, but the arrangements seem far more thought-out here. It's another one, however, that feels a tad preachy \u2013 spilling out a number of worshipping statements about what \"God is\" to Ye. He is a fricking genius with the samples though, that at least will never change. I've just been castigated for writing \"chick fillet\" instead of \"Chick-fil-A\"\u2013 I'M SORRY BUT WE BARELY JUST GOT THAT IN THE UK AND THEY'RE ALREADY CLOSING DOWN. But yes, I am amending the embarrassing error. Track 7: \"Water\" Clemons again on this one \u2013 Ye appears to have found a new favourite vocalist. It reminds me of what A$AP Rocky did on AT LONG LAST A$AP with the London-based singer Joe Fox, who ended up featuring on five tracks (the most of any guest artist, including Ye himself). On an album that has, so far, proven slightly lacking in cohesion, Clemons feels a little like the heart of this album. On \"Water\" there's a bit of a Chance the Rapper vibe, spiritual but uplifting, with some gorgeous male vocals providing a deeper backdrop to Clemons' lighter notes. Track 6: \"Everything We Need\" Ft Ty Dollah $ign and Ant Clemons! If you don't remember, Clemons is the mysterious New Jersey native who appeared on Kanye's track \"All Mine\" from Ye \u2013 he has a voice that many fans mistook to be Jeramih. In fact, Clemons moved to LA in early 2017 where he met Jeramih, wrote the track with him and ended up appearing on it due to some kind of mix-up with the final version of the album (at least that's what Jeramih alluded to at the time). Clemons, Kanye and TY complement one another perfectly here \u2013 Ye is sharp as he talks about switching his attitude, Clemons has that gentle, husky tone, and TY continues his streak of not having a bad feature in sight. An upbeat and concise number, I dig it. Advertisement Track 5: \"On God\" Just when you think Kanye might have lost it... OK, we have a beat here, and it's a good one: stuttering, heavy bass, eerie, Daft Punk-esque synths and some string flourishes. \"Before the ranch I had horses in the garage\" \u2013 nice. There's some shade thrown at the Grammys a la Drake (sorry but the comparison was right there), implying he was doing just fine before the Recording Academy recognised him. I love the little growl in his voice as he spits out each bar. Track 4: \"Closed on Sunday\" Oh wow, what happened here? It's a bizarre segue into a stream-of-consciousness style refrain: \"Closed on Sunday, you my Chick-fil-A/ Hold the selfies, put the 'gram away/ Get your family, y'all hold hands and pray.\" Of the tracks so far, this is Kanye really going for it with this new beliefs/frame of mind and I'm not sure it's doing him any favours whatsoever. He's preaching, there's no other word for it, but it's like seeing those people on the streets shouting about how Doomsday is coming \u2013 you feel vaguely embarrassed and uncomfortable. Ye has never been a great singer but this is painful. He's throwing around Biblical terms like there's no tomorrow, too. And someone screams \"Chick-fil-At\" at the end of the track. Wow. Track 3: \"Follow God\" OK, this is more like it. There's a cool, funk-inflected groove and a sample of a classic R&B cut (I'm trying to work out which one) and Kanye's spitting some of his sharpest bars in a strangely deadpan style. It's combative \u2013 \"Now you wanna see a freak\" \u2013 seemingly referring to the media circus around his erratic behaviour in 2018. Track 2: \"Selah\" The tone becomes more serious as it segues into the first full track of the album. For all his talk about finding God, comparing himself to Noah and Abraham over a heavy organ sound. Some dramatic sounds that recall the pounding of a door before the gospel choir kicks in again with an urgent \"Hallelujah\". He seems to cite his reason for not releasing Yandhi to be that Jesus is a superior album and more in keeping with his new-found beliefs: \"Everybody wanted Yandhi/ Then Jesus Christ did the laundry.\" Or maybe that Yandhi's content didn't fit with his beliefs, and so he scrapped it.\n\n\n\nA side-note that this is an incredibly short album, with a running time of just 27 minutes and 4 seconds. Advertisement Track 1: \"Every Hour\" ft Sunday Service Choir\n\n\n\nSo we're met first by Kanye's Sunday Service Choir on the album's opener, which provides a big uplifting vibe as you'd expect from a gospel choir, and bright sharp piano notes. I would like to thank everyone following this liveblog and my documented misery. I'm about to start writing down the track-by-track thoughts \u2013 please keep in mind this is an immediate reaction and I'm listening for the first time just like you lot. IT'S HERE Advertisement Usually I'd have written my new music column by now and updated the Spotify playlist but obviously I've been somewhat preoccupied with this blog, so apologies to the artists who are, I'd argue, probably more deserving of attention than West at this rate. If the album does indeed drop imminently, as promised, just a head's up that I'll be doing a track-by-track reaction to the album (my thoughts) along with some collating of what everyone else has to say about it. 10 people have already told me they think Consequence is just baiting me with false hope. We have an update! Courtesy of @iBradSando on Twitter (thanks Brad). So according to rapper and producer Consequence, the album will be with us in about... an hour? I'll believe it when I hear it. Advertisement Oh wow, thanks for the feedback! Glad my misery is entertaining someone Regardless of where Jesus is at right now, one thing that isn't being resurrected is my opinion of Kanye. It's poor form to treat your fans like this \u2013 particularly ones who are some of the loyalest out there. Imagine sticking by him through the pro-Trump support, the 'slavery was a choice' claim and, well, the Kardashians, to get to this point where he's delayed not one, but two studio albums. This is the third time Jesus is King has been delayed, and even if it does drop later today, the fact that Kanye is still messing around with the production the day it's supposed to drop shows an astonishing disregard for the people who want to hear that music. Woah, that's deep man Advertisement 1 2 3 Next\n\nWest recently gave a controversial interview with Zane Lowe on the presenter's Beats 1 show, where he announced another album, Jesus is Born, for Christmas Day.\n\nHe also explained why he refused to be silent over his support for US Donald Trump, and declared himself to be \"the greatest human artist of all time\".\n\nIn another revelation, West \u2013 who has identified as a Christian \u2013 said he told people working in his studio not to have sex before marriage.", "description": "Kanye West has finally released his new album\u00a0Jesus is King.\u00a0 The long-delayed record was originally announced for a 27 September release by Kim Kardashian-West, and then \"definitely\" on the 29 September.
