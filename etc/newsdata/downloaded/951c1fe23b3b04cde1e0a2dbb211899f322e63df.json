(AP) - For a franchise that has had little success the past few seasons, the San Francisco 49ers are sure taking their fast start this season in stride.\n\nThe Niners have won their first five games for the first time in 29 years and are one of two remaining undefeated teams in the NFL along with the defending Super Bowl champion New England Patriots.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s cool to be 5-0. But I know it\u2019s nothing,\u201d safety Jimmie Ward said Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019ve been through seasons, I\u2019ve been through injuries, so I know 5-0 is not where I want to be at. It\u2019s cool. It\u2019s impressive I guess for the people outside in the world. Inside this locker room, it\u2019s nothing; 5-0 doesn\u2019t get you anything, 5-0 doesn\u2019t get you a ring.\u201d\n\nBut 5-0 is a dramatic turnaround from where this franchise has been. Since making it to three straight NFC championship games and one Super Bowl from 2011 to 2013 under coach Jim Harbaugh, San Francisco hasn\u2019t had a winning record.\n\nThe 49ers went 8-8 in Harbaugh\u2019s final season in 2014 and have fallen even further since he was forced out after that season. The team won five games in Jim Tomsula\u2019s only season as coach in 2015, went 2-14 the following year under Chip Kelly and then posted a combined 10-22 record in the first two seasons under coach Kyle Shanahan.\n\nNow with a vastly improved defense fortified by edge rushers Nick Bosa and Dee Ford and an offense that features a dynamic running game to go along with a healthy Jimmy Garoppolo at quarterback, the Niners once again look like contenders in the NFC.\n\nThe defense is the tops in the league against the pass and second overall in terms of scoring and total defense. The running game is the second most productive and San Francisco is outscoring opponents by 16.6 points per game, second best in the league.\n\n\u201cThings are trending in the right direction,\u201d Garoppolo said. \u201cI think as an offense you try to assess yourself week to week after the game, what you did good, what you did bad and try to improve those things going forward and not really have any weaknesses. So, that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do.\u201d\n\nSan Francisco is coming off perhaps its most impressive seven-day stretch in years, having beaten Cleveland 31-3 at home on \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d on Oct. 7 and then following it up six days later with a 20-7 win in Los Angeles against the defending NFC champion Rams. San Francisco allowed only 157 yards against LA.\n\nDespite that recent success, Shanahan spent part of the film session before practice Wednesday showing some of the bad plays against the Rams in an effort to keep his players grounded.\n\n\u201cI did it today because I showed a lot of good things Monday,\u201d he said. \u201cWe enjoyed the win and there were a lot of good things. But you can watch that in a different light and find a lot of bad things, too. It\u2019s nice when people tell you how good you are and stuff. It makes people, all human beings, feel better. Those are also the same people who will tell you how bad you are if the ball bounces the wrong way. You can watch that game in a different light and see it\u2019s three plays away from getting out of hand going the other way. So you always want to put that perspective back in the players\u2019 minds so you never relax. If you relax in this league, you\u2019ll be humbled.\u201d\n\nNOTES: TE George Kittle (groin), DT DJ Jones (hamstring), WR Deebo Samuel (groin), DL DeForest Buckner (rest) and RB Raheem Mostert (knee) didn\u2019t practice. \u2026 Tackles Joe Staley (leg) and Mike McGlinchey (knee) worked out on a side field rehabbing their injuries. \u2026 The Niners signed WR Deontay Burnett to the practice squad and released WR Malik Henry from the practice squad.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "For a franchise that has had little success the past few seasons, the San Francisco 49ers are sure taking their fast start this season in stride.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Josh Dubow"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/14/49ers_rams_football_89409_c0-149-3481-2179_s1200x700.jpg?085e2a50c692d52a95a3fe9e624e254742fc1074", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
