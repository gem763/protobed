We had planned to be with the rest of our family in Barbados for half term break. Unfortunately I became poorly with an infection before we were due to leave. I am not able to join them for the time being, even though I am feeling better\"\n\n(Image: SplashNews.com)\n\nColeen went on to say that Wayne and their other children, Kai, Klay and Kit, are on the holiday without her, and that she wanted to make the reason why clear.\n\nFans felt for her.\n\nOne said: \"Pretty sad that you have had to explain yourself to everyone why your not with your family.\"\n\nAnd another jumped to her defence in a bid to shut the haters up.\n\nThey said: \"Some of the replies on here are so heartless! Coleen I hope you are feeling better soon the baby is gorgeous! Enjoy some mummy cass time making memories while the big boys are having fun on holiday\"\n\n(Image: Ken McKay/ITV/REX/Shutterstock)\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nColeen and Rebekah have been at loggerheads ever since her accusations.\n\nColeen was nicknamed Wagatha Christie in the wake of the scandal after unveiling her detective work.\n\nShe said she had planted false stories on her private Instagram account and revealed in an epic statement that she'd blocked every account but Rebekah's from viewing her Stories to test whether or not the information would leak.\n\nAnd when they did, she told the world what had happened in a bombshell statement that went viral.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nRebekah has vehemently denied leaking stories about Coleen and said in her own statement that she was \"disgusted\" that she even had to deny it, especially when she's heavily pregnant.\n\nShe was so upset that she cut her Dubai holiday short and flew back home.\n\nBecky claimed she has hired a forensic IT expert to prove her innocence and is considering legal action.\n\nBut representatives for Coleen say she has irrefutable evidence that the leaks came from Rebekah's account.\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
