Here are five series coming this fall. USA TODAY\n\nWhere do you go after the \"Big Bang\"? Back to basics.\n\nSitcom king Chuck Lorre, the producer behind massive hits such as \"The Big Bang Theory\" and \"Two and a Half Men,\" brings his most surprising series yet to CBS this fall, the sweet and earnest \"Bob Hearts Abishola\" (Mondays, 8:30 EDT/PDT, \u2605\u2605\u2605 out of four).\n\nAs the title suggests, the series is about Bob (Lorre alum Billy Gardell, \"Mike and Molly\") and his romantic pursuit of Abishola (Folake Olowofoyeku), a Nigerian immigrant and Bob's cardiac nurse after the goofy compression sock salesman has a heart attack. He develops a crush on her, which Abishola initially dismisses due to his weakened state. Abishola's Aunt Olu (Shola Adewusi), Uncle Tunde (Barry Shabaka Henley), and friend Kemi (Gina Yashere) push her to date him, but Bob respectfully takes things slowly, and by Monday's third episode, Abishola starts warming to him.\n\nBilly Gardell as Bob and Folake Olowofoyeku as Abishola in \"Bob Hearts Abishola.\" (Photo: CBS)\n\nAlthough the jokes are broad and the studio audience laughter as loud and long as any other Lorre show, there's something quiet, simple and satisfying about \"Abishola\" that makes it stand out among the producer's canon. It's a basic romantic comedy about an unlikely pair, but the people involved, and the way the romance is framed, make it feel refreshingly new.\n\nTV history is littered with unrequited pining of men that verges on harassing behavior (even gems like \"Brooklyn Nine-Nine\" are guilty), and it's easy to see how \"Abishola\" could have gone that route. But Bob isn't forcing his affections on Abishola, just hoping short dates over tea and learning a bit of her native language will make him more attractive. He's not a jerk, a buffoon or an alpha male, but simply a decent guy with a crush.\n\nVernee Watson as Gloria, Gina Yashere as Kemi and Folake Olowofoyeku as Abishola in \"Bob Hearts Abishola.\" (Photo: Michael Yarish/CBS)\n\nAbishola also feels quietly revolutionary. An immigrant who embraces her Nigerian roots and her American home (the series is set in Detroit), she's not a caricature nor the butt of racist jokes. It helps that the series is partially written by people with the experiences it endeavors to portray. Yashere steals scenes as Kemi, but she's also a writer on the series, and British Nigerian. She imbues her culture into the show in an authentic way. One scene in which Abishola, Kemi and their African American co-worker Gloria (Vernee Watson) discuss different ideologies among African women and African American women is nuanced and evolved, funny without making fun of anyone.\n\nAbishola's over-involved family and friends make delightful supporting characters. But the show's main problems are on Bob's side of the emoji heart.\n\nTravis Wolfe Jr. as Dele, Barry Shabaka Henley as Uncle Tunde and Shola Adewusi as Auntie Olu in \"Bob Hearts Abishola.\" (Photo: Sonja Flemming/CBS)\n\nHis family (including several relatives who work with him at the sock company) verges on grating. The constant fat jokes feel wildly off-key in this environment. Lorre already gave us years of ill-mannered weight \"humor\" on \"Mike\" that wasted the talents of Gardell and co-star Melissa McCarthy. Lorre has clearly grown up so much, it's worth noting that Abishola is his first lead character of color. It's a mystery why this lowest-common-denominator joke survives.\n\nMore 'Heart': Chuck Lorre says his new Billy Gardell comedy is a love letter to America's immigrants\n\nBut if \"Abishola\" can move its main couple into a romance at a slow but steady pace and still find comedy once the relationship status is a little more official, Lorre may have another long-lasting sitcom on his hands. It probably won't have the volume or flair of \"Big Bang,\" but going small and subtle can work just as well.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2019/10/07/bob-hearts-abishola-review-chuck-lorres-latest-could-great/3846085002/", "description": "Chuck Lorre, creator of \"The Big Bang Theory,\" has a sweet, subtle new comedy this fall on CBS, \"Bob Hearts Abishola.\" It may just surprise you.", "authors": ["Kelly Lawler", "Published A.M.
