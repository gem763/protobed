For example, the region's overall dependence on oil imports is forecast to exceed 80 per cent in 2040, up from 65 per cent today.\n\nWith no change in policy, South-east Asia's energy demand is expected to grow by 60 per cent by 2040, accounting for 12 per cent of the rise in global energy use as its economy more than doubles, the IEA said. This was slower than the region's 80 per cent growth since 2000.\n\nSouth-east Asia's growth in electricity demand, at an average of 6 per cent per year, has been among the fastest in the world, the IEA said. Still, some 45 million people there still lack access to electricity. The region is well on the way to achieving universal access to electricity by 2030, it added.\n\nOil demand in South-east Asia, home to nearly 10 per cent of the world's population, would surpass 9 million barrels per day (bpd) by 2040, up from just above 6.5 million bpd now, the IEA said.\n\n\"Oil continues to dominate road transport demand, despite an increase in consumption of biofuels,\" the IEA said.\n\n\"Electrification of mobility, with the partial exception of two and three wheelers, makes only limited inroads. This pathway suggests little change in South-east Asia from today's congested roads and poor urban air quality.\"\n\nDemand for coal is also projected to rise steadily over the coming decades, largely fuelled by new coal-fired power plants, despite headwinds facing such projects that include increasing difficulty to secure competitive financing for new facilities.\n\nThe IEA said the region's increasing reliance on imports of natural gas made the fuel less price-competitive though it appeared to be a good fit for the fast-growing cities and lighter industries in the region.\n\n\"In our projections, it is industrial consumers rather than power plants that are the largest source of growth in gas demand,\" the IEA added.\n\nRenewable energy is set to play a larger role, but without stronger policy frameworks the share of renewables in power generation would rise only to 30 per cent by 2040, from the current 24 per cent, the IEA said.\n\nWind and solar energy are expected to grow rapidly, while hydropower and modern bioenergy \u2013 including biofuels, biomass, biogas and bioenergy derived from other waste products \u2013 would remain the mainstays of South-east Asia's renewables portfolio.\n\nREUTERS", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Energy & Commodities - [SINGAPORE] South-east Asia could become a net importer of fossil fuels in the next few years, raising the financial burden on governments and increasing carbon emissions in the region, the International Energy Agency (IEA) warned in a report. .
