The Springboks know they have little chance trying to win the popular vote, or even make new friends, in this of all weeks.\n\nThe otherwise generous hosts want them to lose; the world wants them to lose \u2014 the rugby-fixated part of it at least. They are the bad guys, out to bring an end to the feelgood narrative of this Rugby World Cup.\n\nJapan celebrate their memorable Rugby World Cup victory over Scotland last weekend\n\nIn Tokyo on Sunday, if all goes according to plan, South Africa will take down Japan, negate their incredible freewheeling style, disregard their noble back story of tragic adversity overcome.\n\nForm favours them; size, too. They are the big, ugly Tier One conquerors out to crush this competition\u2019s last remaining, and most appealing underdog. It\u2019s a hard sell, so they are playing nice. To hear South Africa talk yesterday, they have been as captivated by Japanese rugby as the rest of us.\n\nAsked to describe it, Le Roux, who will return here after the tournament with Toyota Verblitz, having previously spent two years at Canon Eagles in Tokyo, captured Japan\u2019s essence perfectly.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s sevens in a 15-man game,\u2019 he said. \u2018It\u2019s very open, very quick, runs from everywhere. There\u2019s not much structure, so everybody just plays what they see. It\u2019s very enjoyable.\u2019\n\nEben Etzebeth (right) trains with his South Africa team-mates ahead of the quarter-final\n\nWhether it will seem that way in the heat of the quarter-final is another matter. Japan\u2019s style is proving devilishly hard to control and these nations have history.\n\nAgain, South Africa\u2019s take is that the defeat in Brighton at the 2015 Rugby World Cup is irrelevant, but that isn\u2019t strictly true. Coach Rassie Erasmus perhaps gave away more than was intended when he admitted a pre-tournament warm-up game was arranged with the intention of erasing that shock result.\n\nSure enough, South Africa won 41-7 when the teams met in Kumagaya on September 6. Yet if four years ago is such ancient history, why bother?\n\nErasmus confessed he had sufficient respect for Japan to expect them to qualify ahead of at least one Tier One nation in their pool, meaning South Africa had a 50-50 chance of meeting them in the last eight. In those circumstances, he didn\u2019t want the 2015 upset \u2014 the biggest in World Cup history \u2014 to be the last word.\n\nHe wouldn\u2019t be the first to think along those lines, of course. Sir Clive Woodward had a similar plan when he brought England south before the 2003 World Cup. At the time, England had won a single game in New Zealand 30 years previously, and had never won a Test in Australia.\n\nWoodward thought he had the best team in the world and wanted those statistics changed before the tournament began.\n\nEngland won back-to-back Tests, then defeated Australia in Sydney in the World Cup final.\n\nYet New Zealand and Australia are giants of the game. South Africa needed to conquer bad memories of lowly Japan. And did, as expected, with an emphatic victory. It is very possible they will win again on Sunday, too. For all of their feats so far, Japan will need to raise the bar again to overcome South Africa, one of the tournament favourites.\n\nAnd yet no one should be under any illusions about the powerful momentum behind the hosts.\n\n\u2018When we played them it was a warm-up game and there was less pressure,\u2019 said centre Lukhanyo Am. \u2018We have seen how they have grown in these last four games. We have been training hard at high tempo to combat that.\u2019\n\nAnd what is plan A? Well, the common perception is that Japan lack height and are vulnerable beneath the high ball. When a question was asked about that tactic, coach Mzwandilie Stick did a quite terrible job of trying to throw the room off the scent.\n\nThey are the bad guys, out to bring an end to the feelgood narrative of this Rugby World Cup\n\n\u2018You actually sound like a coach \u2014 giving us a new game plan,\u2019 he told the questioner. Oh, right. A new game plan, because nobody\u2019s ever thought of trying to kick Japan to death before. You\u2019re really giving us something to think about there, Mr Press Man.\n\nWhat seems to have hit home with the Springboks is Japan\u2019s ambition to reach 50 minutes of ball in play. At their ferocious pace it would require the most supreme physical effort, as No 8 Duane Vermeulen, another South African playing in Japan, confirmed. \u2018We saw their style five weeks ago and they want a 50-minute ball-in-play game. That\u2019s a bold thing to say, but it\u2019s also a big thing to chase. I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve got within 11 minutes of that target so far, but we\u2019ve got to be ready that it could be Sunday.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s a specific style and we\u2019ve got to prime ourselves, adapt to it, counter it. The club teams here do everything at 100 mph.\n\n\u2018The training, the fitness, on and off the field the guys don\u2019t rest. It\u2019s a fantastic culture. So you kind of know what\u2019s coming but you\u2019ve still got to stop it. You\u2019ve got to pitch up on the day.\u2019\n\nMost definitely. Even if the rest of the world would rather they didn\u2019t.", "description": "MARTIN SAMUEL - CHIEF SPORTS WRITER IN TOKYO: With all the talk of Japan's flying Ferrari wingers, a flatterer from the press corps likened Willie Le Roux to a Rolls-Royce.", "authors": ["Martin Samuel - Sport For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/00/19763220-0-image-a-3_1571180595222.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
