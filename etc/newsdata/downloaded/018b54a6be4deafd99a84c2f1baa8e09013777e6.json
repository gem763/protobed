On Monday, the association\u2019s 21 remaining members elected its first board of directors, which includes David Marcus, head of Facebook\u2019s Calibra division; Katie Haun, a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz; Wences Casares, CEO of Hong Kong-based Bitcoin wallet Xapo; Patrick Ellis, general counsel of Dutch payments platform PayU; and Matthew Davie, chief strategy officer of lending non-profit Kiva. (Financial Times, Bloomberg)\n\nTalking point: Some of the board choices have experience with two of the coin\u2019s main challenges: regulations and access to payment networks. Haun is a former U.S. federal prosecutor who has weighed in on the implications of high-profile cryptocurrency cases like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s against Kitchener, Ont.-based Kik. Ellis represents the association\u2019s one remaining payment partner, after the five others\u2014Mastercard, Visa, PayPal, Stripe and Mercado Pago\u2014quit the project. Securing European regulatory approvals will be particularly difficult: a Banque de France deputy governor said Tuesday the association must address concerns about Libra\u2019s impacts on competition and global financial stability before it launches.", "description": "", "authors": ["Murad Hemmadi"], "top_image": "https://thelogic.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/WP_Logo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
