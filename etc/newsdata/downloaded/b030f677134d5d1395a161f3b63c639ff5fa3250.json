There\u2019s no way to tell whether yours could be affected until the firmware update drops (and it should have already, given these reports have been hitting since September or so).\n\nIf you\u2019re unlucky, your device will show four white lights on its face and, more telling, you won\u2019t be able to do anything with it. You can try a few simple workarounds to see if you can resuscitate your broken smart speaker, including unplugging it for 10 seconds or so and plugging it back in, and trying to perform a full factory reset on the device. If neither option works, your only resource is to contact Google.\n\nAs Google recently told 9to5Google:\n\n\u201cWe are aware that a small number of Google Home and Google Home Mini devices are affected by an issue that causes the device to stop working. We have a fix that will prevent the issue from happening and will be rolling it out soon. We are replacing affected devices.\u201d\n\nWhat Google doesn\u2019t say is that the company is replacing all affected devices regardless of warranty.
