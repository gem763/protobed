A kindergarten teacher reported that he \u201cseemed to identify as an animal,\u201d citing his crawling on the ground, pouncing on other students, growling and, again, biting.\n\nBut early on, he got diagnosed as suffering \u201cdevelopmental delay,\u201d \u201clanguage processing deficiency\u201d and \u201cattention deficit disorder.\u201d And such \u201cemotional and behavioral disability\u201d diagnoses, the authors explain, guarantee that their subject becomes a kind of untouchable in modern US schools.\n\nUnder the Federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, \u201cchildren with disabilities must be educated with children without disabilities to the maximum extent possible in the least restrictive environment.\u201d\n\n\u201cFull inclusion\u201d in ordinary classes becomes imperative. And, noted one teacher, \u201cNo one ever challenges an [emotionally disabled] parent or kid because it\u2019s not worth the risk of litigation.\u201d\n\nNo matter that he got worse. One middle school teacher recalls his \u201cscreaming in the hall.\u201d \u201cIf something frustrated Cruz, he would curse and threaten anyone nearby,\u201d the authors write. And: \u201cFor no apparent reason he would burst into maniacal laughter.\u201d\n\nHe told an eighth-grade teacher, \u201cI\u2019m a bad kid. I want to kill.\u201d Cops were called to the Cruz home 39 times over six years. Yet no one ever invoked the \u201cdanger to himself or others\u201d standard to try for an involuntary mental commitment.\n\nAs Eden puts it, \u201cAll the things that were going wrong in American public education joined forces to let him slip through every crack.\u201d And so, his record unblemished by criminal or mental health red flags, Cruz legally bought his murder weapon soon after turning 18.", "description": "Excerpted in Monday\u2019s Post, \u201cWhy Meadow Died\u201d reveals educational records, like teacher daily diaries, tracking Cruz\u2019s flagrantly psychotic behavior from an early age.", "authors": ["Post Editorial Board", "September"], "top_image": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/school_shooting_florida.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
