After 178 years of organizing travel, the final flight came in for a Monday-morning landing at Manchester Airport. Poor decisions in the face of rising online retailers, a \u00a31.7 billion debt pile \u2014 roughly $2.1 billion \u2014 along with summer heat waves and increased competition contributed to the company\u2019s downfall.\n\nThe growing popularity of \u201cstaycations\u201d due to warmer weather in the U.K. and as a cheaper alternative to going abroad on vacation has also affected demand.\n\nBut the sudden collapse of Thomas Cook may also signify that the end is nigh for the package holiday. Already, rival Monarch went bust in 2017 after having moved away from its once-successful packages to focus on flight-only deals.\n\nRise of online holiday retailers\n\nHolidaymakers have warmed to the flexibility offered by an increasing variety of online companies, including Expedia EXPE, -1.35% and Booking.com BKNG, -1.09% in recent years. Platforms such as Airbnb as well as apps for car hire and cheaper flights have enabled customers to build their own holidays.\n\nLeading online holiday firm On the Beach OTB, +9.21% could benefit from the trend away from package tours. The company, which focuses on short-haul beach holidays, allows customers to control all elements of a trip, including flights, hotels and other services.\n\nShares have risen 21% so far this year, and despite warning of a one-off cost in helping its customers who had booked with Thomas Cook, the stock could climb higher as it looks to grow sales from longer-haul holidays.\n\nA smaller trend toward specialist holidays has also emerged in recent years, with eco-friendly vacations and adventure holidays increasingly popular. Another is the niche area of political trips.\n\nLow-cost airline boost\n\nWith industry giants such as Monarch and Thomas Cook out of the way, the rise of low-cost airlines shows no sign of slowing down. Shares of Ryanair RY4C, +0.90% RYA, +0.85% and easyJet EZJ, +4.63% both jumped on Monday.\n\nYet budget carriers will still face sectorwide issues, including fuel costs, warm weather and the rise of staycations. Rival Tui\u2019s stock has fallen 20% so far this year but enjoyed a 6.8% bounce after Thomas Cook\u2019s collapse was confirmed on Monday.\n\nBut it may take more than the demise of Thomas Cook to breathe new life into the travel-operator industry.\n\nThe future of package holidays\n\nTui has experienced similar problems to its now-defunct rival. Its tour operations and airlines division has been hit by warm weather, overcapacity and uncertainty related to the U.K.\u2019s looming departure from the European Union. But having taken prudent steps to diversify risk, the company\u2019s hotels and resorts arm, as well as its cruise operations, have remained strong.\n\nJet2 owner Dart Group, which climbed 6.2% on Monday, has seen demand for its package holidays increase in 2019, defying the wider trend. The company said its prices still needed to be enticing as \u201cless confident consumers\u201d were booking holidays later than in previous years and warned the industry was facing fuel-cost pressures.\n\nTui and Jet2 have shown that the demise of package holidays does not need to be fatal, but they have their work cut out to compete with online retailers amid mounting headwinds.", "description": "Watch how rivals Tui and Jet2 as well as On The Beach respond.", "authors": ["Callum Keown"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR864_Thomas_ZG_20190923110821.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
