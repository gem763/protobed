REUTERS/Akhtar Soomro\n\nLAHORE, Pakistan (Reuters) - Britain\u2019s Prince William and his wife Kate on Thursday joined locals in a cricket match in the Pakistani city of Lahore before a trip to a cancer hospital that his mother, Princess Diana, visited a year before her death.\n\nThe Pakistani government hopes the couple\u2019s four-day official visit will boost the country\u2019s image as a tourist and business destination, after decades of sectarian violence and political unrest.\n\nWilliam and Kate, who have frequently donned traditional Pakistani dress by local designers during their trip, have highlighted education and the impact of climate change in the country.\n\nAt a meeting earlier in Lahore, one of Pakistan\u2019s largest cities and its cultural capital, the chief minister of Punjab state Usman Bazdar told the couple their visit \u201cwill further strengthen relations between the two countries\u201d.\n\nKate and William then took part in a cricket match including former captains of the Pakistan men and women\u2019s teams, Azhar Ali and Sana Mir. Pakistan\u2019s bowling coach Waqar Younis, also a former men\u2019s captain, umpired the match.\n\nThey will head later in the day to the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital, founded by Imran Khan, a family friend of the Prince and the current prime minister of Pakistan. Diana made a high-profile visit to the hospital, a year before her death in a car crash in 1997.", "description": "Britain's Prince William and his wife Kate on Thursday joined locals in a cricket match in the Pakistani city of Lahore before a trip to a cancer hospital that his mother, Princess Diana, visited a year before her death.", "authors": ["Peter Nicholls", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191017&t=2&i=1441840584&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9G0VW", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
