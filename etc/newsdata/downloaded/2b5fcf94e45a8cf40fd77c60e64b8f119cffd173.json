A first-round draft pick in 2015, the Russian played in his home country until last year, when he joined the Capitals\u2018 AHL affiliate in Hershey.\n\nSamsonov is considered the goalie of the future in Washington. Braden Holtby is beginning the final year of his contract, and it may make more sense for the Capitals to move on if they deem Samsonov is ready.\n\nThe Capitals\u2018 plans at this position weren\u2019t clear until the waiver announcement. Other options included starting the season with three goalies on the 23-man roster, if they could make them all fit, or returning Samsonov to the Hershey Bears with the intention of giving him some NHL games later in the season.\n\nCopley will join Hershey if he clears waivers, but there\u2019s no reason he couldn\u2019t come back up to Washington later this year if Samsonov struggles or if someone is injured. He had a serviceable season as the No. 2 goalie in 2018-19, going 16-7-3 in 27 games (24 starts) with a .905 save percentage.\n\nCopley signed a three-year, $3.3 million extension in the middle of last season.\n\nThe Capitals open the season Wednesday night at the St. Louis Blues, who will be raising their first Stanley Cup banner.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
