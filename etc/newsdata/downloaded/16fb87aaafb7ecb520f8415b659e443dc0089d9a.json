REUTERS/Leah Millis\n\n\u201cCalifornia has treated the Auto Industry very poorly for many years, harming Workers and Consumers,\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter.\n\nThe automakers\u2019 decision to side with the Trump administration follows legal challenges by California and 22 states and environmental groups in September.\n\nThose challenges aim to undo the administration\u2019s determination that federal law bars California from setting its own rigorous tailpipe emission standards and zero-emission vehicle mandates.\n\nThe decision to back Trump, disclosed in a filing with a U.S. appeals court late on Monday, has prompted a furious backlash from Democrats and environmentalists.\n\nIt also poses a risk for the automakers if a Democrat wins the White House in November 2020 and reverses Trump\u2019s actions, allowing California to set its own rules and revert to the tougher national emissions standards of the Obama era.\n\nThe automakers did not immediately comment.\n\nCalifornia Air Resource Board chief Mary Nichols on Tuesday criticized automakers after noting they tried a similar tactic previously. \u201cGM, Toyota and Chrysler are repeating the same legal arguments they lost back in 2004, hoping for a different result. Definition of insanity?\u201d she wrote on Twitter.\n\nU.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Frank Pallone, a Democrat, said on Twitter automakers \u201ccaving\u201d to Trump\u2019s \u201cintimidation campaign won\u2019t save these automakers\u201d and added the decision to align with Trump\u2019s \u201canti-climate agenda for the sake of a little short-term profit and reprieve from @POTUS\u2019 Twitter tirades will do long-term damage, both to the automotive industry and to our country.\u201d\n\nOther automakers, such as Ford Motor Co (F.N), Honda Motor Co (7267.T) and Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE), which announced a voluntary deal with California in July on emissions rules, are not joining the bid to intervene on the administration\u2019s side.\n\nThe group backing Trump also includes Mazda Motor Corp (7261.T), Nissan Motor Co (7201.T), Kia Motors Corp (000270.KS) and Subaru Co (9778.T).\n\nIn August 2018, the Trump administration proposed freezing fuel efficiency requirements at 2020 levels through 2026, reversing planned 5% annual increases.\n\nThe Obama-era rules called for a fleetwide fuel-efficiency average of 46.7 miles per gallon by 2026 compared with 37 mpg by 2026 under the Trump administration\u2019s preferred option. The final requirements are expected to be ready by the end of the year.", "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday thanked General Motors Co , Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T>, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV and other major automakers for \"standing with\" his efforts to bar California from setting its own vehicle emissions rules for cars and trucks.", "authors": ["David Shepardson", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446621537&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9T1N2", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
