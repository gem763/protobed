Prices had already been rising on growing hopes for a breakthrough in the China-US trade talks.\n\nThe blasts come just weeks after two of Saudi Arabia\u2019s biggest oil installations were hit, wiping out five percent of global production.\n\nThe National Iranian Tanker Company said the hull of the vessel was hit by two separate explosions about 100 kilometres (60 miles) off the Saudi coast.\n\nIt identified the tanker as the Sabiti and said the blasts were \u201cprobably caused by missile strikes\u201d.\n\n\u201cAll the ship\u2019s crew are safe and the ship is stable too,\u201d NITC said, adding those on board were trying to repair the damage.\n\nOil was leaking from the tanker into the Red Sea off the major Saudi port of Jeddah.\n\nThe state-owned company said that contrary to reports, \u201cthere is no fire aboard the ship and the ship is completely stable\u201d.\n\nAccording to Iranian state television, the blasts could have been the result of a \u201cterrorist attack.\u201d\n\nThere was confusion about the name of the vessel involved.\n\nTankerTrackers, a site that monitors maritime traffic, identified the ship as the Sinopa.\n\nIt comes after a spate of still unexplained attacks on shipping in and around the vital seaway to the Gulf involving and Western powers.\n\nWashington accused Tehran of attacking the vessels with mines, something it strongly denied.\n\n\u2013 Attacks on Saudi plants \u2013\n\nThere have also been seizures of both Iranian and Western-flagged vessels and twin attacks claimed by Yemeni rebels allied with Iran on key Saudi oil infrastructure.\n\nBoth Washington and Riyadh blamed Tehran for those attacks, which wiped out five percent of global production. Iran again denied any role.\n\nThe United States has since formed a naval coalition to escort commercial vessels through the strategic Strait of Hormuz.\n\nIt has been joined by Australia, Bahrain, Britain, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nFriday\u2019s incident is the first involving an Iranian ship since the \u201cHappiness 1\u201d broke down at about the same location in early May.\n\nThat ship was repaired in Saudi Arabia and held in the kingdom until July 21 when it was released.\n\nThe rare docking came despite escalating tensions between staunch enemies Iran and Saudi Arabia.\n\nSaudi Arabia severed diplomatic ties with Iran in 2016, after its missions in the country were attacked in demonstrations over the Sunni-ruled kingdom\u2019s execution of prominent Shiite cleric Nimr al-Nimr.\n\nThey still lack direct diplomatic channels, and Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi in July thanked \u201cSwitzerland and Oman as well as related Saudi parties for offering services and facilities\u201d to resolve the issue.\n\n\u2013 Iran-US standoff \u2013\n\nIran has been locked in a standoff with the United States and its Gulf Arab allies since US President Donald Trump withdrew from a 2015 deal that gave it relief from sanctions in return for curbs on its nuclear programme.\n\nThe British-flagged oil tanker Stena Impero arrived in Dubai on Saturday, after being detained with its crew in Iran for more than two months.\n\nIran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards seized the vessel in the Strait of Hormuz on July 19 and then impounded it off the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas for allegedly failing to respond to distress calls and turning off its transponder after hitting a fishing boat.\n\nBut the seizure was widely seen as a tit-for-tat move after authorities in the British overseas territory of Gibraltar detained an Iranian tanker on suspicion it was shipping oil to Syria in breach of EU sanctions.\n\nTehran repeatedly denied the cases were related.\n\nAt the height of the crisis, Trump ordered retaliatory strikes against Iran after the Islamic republic downed a US drone but called them off at the last minute.", "description": "Tehran (AFP) \u2013 Suspected missile strikes hit an Iranian oil tanker near the Saudi coast on Friday, its owner said, the first Iranian vessel targeted", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/11/cb8737_iran-tanker-iran-tanker-hit-by-suspected-missile-strikes-saudi-port-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
