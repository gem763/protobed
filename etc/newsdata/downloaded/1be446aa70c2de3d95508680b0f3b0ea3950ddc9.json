Another supportive factor was the Fed's second interest rate\n\ncut this year, though the central bank gave mixed signals on\n\nfuture cuts. \"(The) Global outlook still looks quite unfavourable and\n\ncentral banks around the globe will continue to ease monetary\n\npolicy, which will be beneficial for gold,\" said FXTM analyst\n\nLukman Otunuga.\n\nLower interest rates reduce the opportunity cost of holding\n\nnon-yielding bullion and weigh on the dollar, making gold\n\ncheaper for investors holding other currencies.\n\nHowever, a slight dent to gold's appeal came from a firmer\n\ndollar , which on Friday rose 0.2% against a basket of\n\nmajor currencies. USD/\n\nMarkets also focused on U.S.-China trade talks in Washington\n\nbefore high-level discussions next month. U.S. and Chinese\n\ndeputy trade negotiators resumed face-to-face talks for the\n\nfirst time in nearly two months on Thursday. \"Given potential upside catalysts (for gold) in the coming\n\nmonths, such as a dovish Fed and trade uncertainty, there is a\n\nrisk that investors once again get left behind,\" UBS analysts\n\nsaid in a note.\n\n\"Indicators suggest that market participants have reduced\n\nlongs and are focusing on the $1,480 support area all the way\n\ndown to $1,450 as attractive levels to re-engage.\"\n\nMeanwhile, palladium XPD= jumped 1.2% to $1,643.31 an\n\nounce, having touched a record $1,649.09. The auto-catalyst\n\nmetal, which is in short supply, was up 2.3% over the week and\n\non track for a seventh straight weekly gain.\n\n\"What we're seeing is continuing purchases in palladium not\n\nonly by speculators but also car producers. Consumers are\n\nbecoming concerned about rising prices and would rather be\n\nbuying it now than later,\" said Commerzbank's Weinberg.\n\nSilver firmed by 0.1% to $17.78 an ounce, up 2% for\n\nthe week and heading for a first weekly gain in three, while\n\nplatinum XPT= rose 0.3% to $939.55.\n\n\n\n", "description": "PRECIOUS-Gold gains on Middle East tensions; palladium hits record high", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/indicatornews_5_800x533_L_1412601619.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
