The president and his allies have sought to question the inquiry\u2019s legitimacy.\n\nIn particular, the White House objects that the House did not formally vote to begin the impeachment inquiry, breaking with precedent set in the inquiries into Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton.\n\nPelosi has insisted the House is well within its rules to conduct oversight of the executive branch under the constitution regardless of a vote.\n\nRefuse, block, stonewall \u2013 but Trump's strategy leaves little margin for error Read more\n\nThe administration is also sharply critical of the conduct of House intelligence committee chairman, Adam Schiff, whose committee is leading the inquiry, and it appears determined to stonewall Democrats for as long as possible.\n\nIn its most aggressive response yet, Cipollone wrote in the letter, released in the late afternoon on Tuesday: \u201cYour unprecedented actions have left the president with no choice. In order to fulfill his duties to the American people, the Constitution, the Executive Branch and all future occupants of the Office of the Presidency, President Trump and his administration cannot participate in your partisan and unconstitutional inquiry under these circumstances.\u201d\n\nCipollone\u2019s letter threatens to end cooperation with Congress on important oversight matters, accusing members of formulating their investigation \u201cin a manner that violates fundamental fairness and constitutionally mandated due process\u201d.\n\nIt adds: \u201cTo comply with the Constitution\u2019s demands, appropriate procedures would include \u2013 at a minimum \u2013 the right to see all evidence, to present evidence, to call witnesses, to have counsel present at all hearings, to cross-examine all witnesses, to make objections relating to the examination of witnesses or the admissibility of testimony and evidence, and to respond to evidence and testimony.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the state department said the US ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, a Trump political donor, would not be allowed to appear, even though he had already travelled from Europe to testify behind closed doors. Trump decried the Democratic-led inquiry into whether he abused his office in the pursuit of personal political gain as a \u201ckangaroo court\u201d.\n\nQ&A How do you impeach the US president? Show Hide Article 1 of the United States constitution gives the House of Representatives the sole power to initiate impeachment and the Senate the sole power to try impeachments of the president. A president can be impeached if they are judged to have committed \"treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors\" \u2013 although the constitution does not specify what \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d are. The process starts with the House of Representatives passing articles of impeachment. A simple majority of members need to vote in favour of impeachment for it to pass to the next stage. Democrats currently control the house, with 235 representatives. The chief justice of the US supreme court then presides over the proceedings in the Senate, where the president is tried, with senators acting as the jury. For the president to be found guilty two-thirds of senators must vote to convict. Republicans currently control the Senate, with 53 of the 100 senators. Two presidents have previously been impeached, Bill Clinton in 1998, and Andrew Johnson in 1868, though neither was removed from office as a result. Richard Nixon resigned in 1974 before there was a formal vote to impeach him. Martin Belam\n\nDemocrats condemned the move, calling it an attempt to obstruct their inquiry, and issued a subpoena for Sondland, seeking documents by 14 October and a deposition on 16 October.\n\nSchiff said the ambassador\u2019s no-show was \u201cyet additional strong evidence\u201d of obstruction of Congress by Trump and the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, that will only strengthen a possible impeachment case.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, has said he will not testify before the House intelligence committee unless committee members vote to remove Schiff. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t testify in front of that committee until there is a vote of Congress and he is removed,\u201d Giuliani told the Washington Post. \u201cLet them hold me in contempt. We\u2019ll go to court. We\u2019ll challenge the contempt.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThe position I\u2019m stating is now the position of the administration.\u201d\n\nThe House committees leading the fast-moving investigation intend to call and subpoena a number of Trump administration witnesses. The investigation could lead to the approval of articles of impeachment against Trump in the House. A trial on whether to remove him from office would then be held in the Senate, where Republicans have the upper hand.\n\nTrump\u2019s supporters in the House endorsed the letter. The House Republican leader, Kevin McCarthy, said: \u201cHouse Democrats have wanted to undo the results of the 2016 election for three years, and now they\u2019re rushing a sham impeachment process.\n\n\n\n\u201cPresident Trump is right to call out this rushed process because Democrats refuse to protect the transparency and basic fairness that have been integral to previous impeachment proceedings.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report", "description": "Eight-page letter to Democratic leaders sets stage for constitutional crisis, as legislative and executive branches clash", "authors": ["David Smith"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f0f38535b076fef018ee466f1931686fdb51b53/0_0_4896_2938/master/4896.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3f1fb80b5e26bf1ac5c3853410ea6523", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
