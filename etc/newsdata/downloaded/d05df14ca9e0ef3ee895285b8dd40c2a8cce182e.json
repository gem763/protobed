Independent agencies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Trade Commission and the Federal Communications Commission operate differently \u2014 more independently. Their commissioners, representing both political parties, are appointed for set terms and they cannot be fired without evidence of malfeasance.\n\nThat feature sticks in the craw of many conservatives, who see independent agencies as an ungainly addition grafted onto the supposedly pristine triangular structure of legislative, executive and judicial power that we all learned in third grade. These agencies, conservatives argue, represent an unconstitutional limitation on the president\u2019s power to direct the executive branch.\n\nThe problem they face is that the Supreme Court, in a 1935 case known as Humphrey\u2019s Executor v. United States, unanimously upheld independent agencies against such a constitutional challenge. Like the director of the CFPB, the federal trade commissioner whose firing was challenged in Humphrey\u2019s Executor \u2014 William E. Humphrey had died, so his estate pursued the case \u2014 could only be removed for cause.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn the Seila case that the justices agreed to review, the court of appeals found that precedent dictated the outcome, even though the CFPB is headed by a single director, while other independent agencies have a multi-member structure. The full D.C. Circuit, in a separate case, came to the same conclusion.\n\nBut now the stage is set for a momentous battle in the Supreme Court. The D.C. Circuit case was initially heard by a three-judge panel that included then-Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, who wrote an opinion striking down the CFPB structure as a violation of separation of powers. Beginning his 100-page opinion, \u201cThis is a case about executive power and individual liberty,\u201d Kavanaugh concluded that the for-cause removal feature, combined with the provision for a single director, reposed too much power in one unelected official. The full appeals court then overturned Kavanaugh\u2019s decision, vacating his opinion and reaffirming the constitutionality of the CFPB by a 7-to-3 vote.\n\nKavanaugh is not recused in the Seila case, so it\u2019s clear there will be at least one vote for striking down the leadership structure of the CFPB. Based on their overall conservative views, it\u2019s quite possible that Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr., possibly along with Neil M. Gorsuch, would be prepared to go even further, overruling Humphrey\u2019s Executor altogether. Kavanaugh himself pointedly criticized the case in a footnote, calling it inconsistent with other court holdings but adding that a court of appeals could not overrule Supreme Court precedent. No such limit constrains him now.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn that same footnote, Kavanaugh also suggested that overruling Humphrey\u2019s Executor would be less than momentous, since such entities \u201cwould simply transform into executive agencies supervised and directed by the President.\u201d But there is quite a lot tucked into that \u201csimply\u201d \u2014 namely, the traditional operation of independent agencies. It is their ability to act at arm\u2019s length from the political control of the president, and to apply their best expert judgment to pressing national problems, that would be lost in the supposedly simple transformation Kavanaugh outlines.\n\nAs for Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., the court\u2019s new center, he is a less-certain vote than the other four, and he surely will be conscious of the implications of undermining the long-standing principle of Humphrey\u2019s Executor. But the chief justice came to the court as a dyed-in-the-wool conservative, and antipathy to independent agencies as a violation of the separation of powers is an article of faith for conservatives of his generation.\n\nIf I were forced to wager, I\u2019d bet on a 5-to-4 opinion invalidating the CFPB on the Kavanaugh rationale, with two or three justices suggesting they would take the plunge and overrule Humphrey\u2019s Executor.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhy would that be such a significant result? Judging from his opinion while on the D.C. Circuit, Kavanaugh will be at pains to present the invalidation of the leadership structure of the CFPB as just a small inroad. The problem is that Kavanaugh articulated no real principle, nor is one readily apparent, to justify that carve-out. As Judge Cornelia \u201cNina\u201d Pillard warned in her opinion for the majority, \u201cA constitutional analysis that condemns the CFPB\u2019s for-cause removal provision provides little assurance against \u2014 indeed invites \u2014 the judicial abolition of all independent agencies.\u201d\n\nAbsent an obvious principled stopping point on the path toward outright overruling Humphrey\u2019s Executor, an opinion along the lines of Kavanaugh\u2019s in the D.C. Circuit would fundamentally destabilize the institution of independent agencies. It would leave the legal status of independent agencies unstable, inviting a future court, if not this one, to administer the final blow.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAD", "description": "It would leave the legal status of independent agencies unstable.", "authors": ["Harry Litman", "Contributing Columnist Focused On Legal Issues", "Contributing Columnist"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Qd8OMEs7u8P_SkbYQ0wDgP1Z_DA=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HVUT3XHR3II6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
