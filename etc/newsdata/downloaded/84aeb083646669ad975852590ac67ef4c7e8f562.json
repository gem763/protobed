Harlequins Ben Spencer was flying out to Japan last night as a replacement for Heinz.\n\nNevertheless, after England's history boys ended the All Blacks' 12-year unbeaten run in the tournament, an ebullient Jones said: 'New Zealand are the god of rugby, so we had to take it to them. To try to put them on the back foot as much as we could.\n\nEddie Jones hailed his England players for beating 'the god of rugby' New Zealand on Saturday\n\n'They are a great team. They have won two World Cups in a row. They have got a great coach, a great captain, so we had to battle hard. You always go in with an idea of how you want the game to be, but it never goes exactly like that. You have got to give so much credit to New Zealand, the way they kept fighting right until the end. We had to dig deep to win that game.'\n\nEngland set the tone from the moment they confronted New Zealand's players at the haka with a 'V' formation. 'We've had two and a half years to prepare for it,' added Jones. 'We've been unconsciously preparing each game for this game.'\n\nOn Sunday's semi-final, he said: 'We are looking forward to Wales and South Africa playing a 3-3 draw so they have to play extra-time, and it's still 3-3 and they have to play more extra-time!'\n\nNow England have concerns over the fitness of several key players for Saturday's final.\n\nMay left the field after 44 minutes with a hamstring injury, which required immediate ice pack treatment. Farrell suffered a dead leg, Sinckler also limped off while Heinz had a leg strapped up in the closing stages.\n\nEngland set the tone from the moment they confronted New Zealand's players at the haka\n\nConor O'Shea, the Italy head coach, is believed to have agreed to take up a senior position in the RFU\u2019s professional rugby department.\n\nReports on Saturday night suggested the Irishman, 49, will start the role with England ahead of the Six Nations in February and will work closely with Jones.", "description": "NIK SIMON IN YOKAHAMA: Eddie Jones hailed his England players for beating 'the god of rugby' as they booked their place in the World Cup final.
