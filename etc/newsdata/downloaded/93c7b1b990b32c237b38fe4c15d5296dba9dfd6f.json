The special general election will be April 28 \u2014 the same day as the state's presidential primary.\n\nTurnout for special elections is notoriously low, but putting the decision on the same ballot as the presidential primary should boost the number of voters. The governor's office said holding both elections that day will \"avoid the cost and confusion of multiple and additional election days.\"\n\nCandidates have from Wednesday until November 20 to enter the race.\n\nSome expect Cummings' widow to run. Maya Rockeymoore Cummings is chair of the state's Democratic Party and has run for office before. In 2017, she sought to unseat Hogan but dropped out of the race when her husband was hospitalized.\n\nSome have already thrown their ring in the hat. Mark Gosnell, a doctor, plans to run as a Democrat. The district is overwhelmingly Democratic, but at least one Republican \u2014 Liz Matory, a business owner and author of a book called \"Born Again Republican\"\u2014announced her intentions to run.\n\nOther Democrats being mentioned as potential candidates, according to The Baltimore Sun, are Marilyn J. Mosby, the state's attorney in Baltimore; Calvin Ball, the Howard County executive; and Kweisi Mfume, a former president of the NAACP who previously held the seat.\n\nCummings died on October 17 at the age of 68. Before serving in Congress for 23 years, he was elected to the Maryland House, where he became the first black speaker pro tem of that chamber. He was chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, which is one of three committees leading the impeachment inquiry against President Trump. Representative Carolyn Maloney is serving as acting chair of the committee until a permanent new leader is chosen.", "description": "The special general election will be April 28 \u2014 the same day as the state's presidential primary", "authors": ["Caroline Cournoyer"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/24/e324eb55-0d26-481e-876d-2ccc42f789f3/thumbnail/1200x630g2/330c48cdb0347358bde1042495a8969d/gettyimages-1157611295.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
