REUTERS/Bogdan Cristel\n\nThe 34-year-old missed out on a place in Michael Cheika\u2019s World Cup squad but is expected to be granted a 90th cap and run off the bench against the Pacific islanders.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a privilege, really, to get another opportunity to wear the gold jersey,\u201d Polota-Nau said from the Wallabies\u2019 training camp in New Caledonia.\n\n\u201cMost likely for the last time but in saying that, it\u2019s been a hell of a journey from my end, I\u2019ve been very fortunate to wear the gold jersey every single time.\u201d\n\nPolota-Nau\u2019s announcement follows long-serving prop Sekope Kepu\u2019s confirmation on Monday that he will bow out of internationals after the World Cup.\n\nLike 105-cap Kepu, Polota-Nau has seen off several generations of Wallabies front-rowers and played a role in their 2011 and 2015 World Cup campaigns.\n\nAfter starting last year as the incumbent number two, however, he slipped down the pecking order as Cheika opted to try Tolu Latu and Folau Fainga\u2019a during the season-ending tour of Europe.\n\nPolota-Nau has been packing down in the Wallabies scrum since 2005 but has been the stand-in man for much of his career, starting only 39 of his 89 tests while former skipper Stephen Moore racked up 129 international caps.\n\nHe had a difficult, injury-interrupted season with Leicester in the English Premiership before returning to the New South Wales Waratahs, his old Super Rugby club, for a short stint in March.\n\nHe may yet have another chance to shine for the Wallabies, being on injury standby for the World Cup behind squad players Latu, Fainga\u2019a and young Melbourne Rebel Jordan Uelese.\n\n\u201cThey are great - it\u2019s possibly the best combination you will get for preparation for a World Cup,\u201d said Polota-Nau, a powerful scrummager whose fearless approach to the game saw him repeatedly battle concussion through the middle of his career.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately my skill-set isn\u2019t as good as the rest of them but to be honest I couldn\u2019t be at a happier place and I have every confidence that they will do the job over in Japan.\u201d", "description": "Veteran Australia hooker Tatafu Polota-Nau will bow out of international rugby in front of home fans in Sydney on Saturday when the Wallabies play their final World Cup warmup against Samoa.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190904&t=2&i=1426027937&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF830F9"}
