The two-year Treasury yield is more than 25 basis points up from its low in September, immediately after President Donald Trump\u2019s last big escalation of the trade dispute. The two-year note yield rose three basis points to 1.65% on Monday, while the 10-year and 30-year yields rose by five basis points each.\n\nHigher yields on other havens put downward pressure on non-interest-bearing bullion, and by 11:30 AM ET (1530 GMT), gold futures for delivery on the Comex exchange were down or 0.8% to $1,493.75 a troy ounce. Spot gold fell 0.9% to $1,491.82 an ounce.\n\nSilver futures also retreated, losing 0.3% to $17.87 an ounce, while platinum futures fell 1.0% to $924.30.\n\nWith most people in the market still betting on a rate cut, some have warned that there could be some sharp volatility if the Fed disappoints on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cLet's be very clear here, we would not be at new highs in or we would not have hit these current levels of 3,000 in the S&P were it not for complete central bank capitulation,\u201d said Northman Trader\u2019s chief market strategist Sven Henrich. \u201cFour rate cuts, jawboning trade optimism, all these valuations have to be justified at the end of the day. You cannot lose one of these equations and so markets remain artificially inflated.\u201d\n\nRelated Articles\n\nShale Doubters Finally Get Their Moment as Revolution Falters\n\nOil Holds Gains on Signs of Progress in U.S.-China Trade War\n\nInvestors brace for poor U.S. shale earnings amid weak oil and gas prices", "description": "Investing.com - Gold prices fell on Monday as risk appetite returned to markets in the wake of positive noises from both Washington and Beijing over their planned \"phase-1\" trade agreement, while the European Union finally ended the risk of a disorderly Brexit at the end of the month.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
