You can rent an electric scooter. And of course, you can pick one up off a crowded street. What you can\u2019t do is escape the ridicule that comes with this extremely convenient mode of transportation \u2014 particularly not after they explode inside a tech company\u2019s headquarters and cause people to evacuate.\n\nThe San Francisco Fire Department has confirmed to The Verge that Dropbox evacuated its SF headquarters at 333 Brannan Street yesterday after an electric scooter caught fire on the fifth floor of the building. The SFFD says it was able to extinguish the fire, and that no one got hurt.\n\nMy office was evacuated today because an electric scooter exploded and caught fire. Seriously living in an episode of Silicon Valley over here. pic.twitter.com/cX2iVvejtf \u2014 Davy Rudolph (@davyr) August 14, 2019\n\nBased on a photo from Dropbox associate creative director Davy Rudolph, the scooter looks like a match for a fairly cheap ($250-ish) model known as the Tianrun R3 and also sold by RocketX, though it\u2019s not clear which company its owner purchased it from. Cheap hoverboards have been known to occasionally explode in the past, typically because of issues when charging their large, combustible lithium-ion batteries, but we shouldn\u2019t jump to conclusions.\n\nIn this case, it sounds like the excitement didn\u2019t really take a big chunk out of the company\u2019s day. Here\u2019s Dropbox\u2019s statement:\n\nWe experienced a small fire at 333 Brannan yesterday afternoon. It was quickly put out, no injuries have been reported, and everyone was able to evacuate safely. We\u2019re thankful to the SFFD for their swift response.\n\nJust another Wednesday in Silicon Valley*. Complete with cases of emergency La Croix, apparently!\n\neveryone in tech jokes about how their lives feel like an ep of Silicon Valley but yesterday dropbox had to evacuate bc an electric scooter exploded in our office and it was \"so hot\" outside (80 degrees) that people were instacarting us emergency la croix \u2014 hilary (@yourgirlhils) August 15, 2019\n\nIf you think \u201cschadenfreude\u201d when you hear \u201cscooter\u201d \u2014 and why not? I actually like them and I still chuckle along \u2014 here are additional Verge stories you may want to browse.\n\n*Yes, I know San Francisco isn\u2019t technically in the valley, I\u2019m from San Jose. I\u2019m writing for a wider audience.\n\nUpdate, 10:30 PM ET: Added a photo that suggests what kind of scooter caused the fire, if not necessarily which model or why it caught fire.", "description": "The San Francisco Fire Department has confirmed to The Verge that Dropbox evacuated its SF headquarters at 333 Brannan yesterday after an electric scooter caught fire on the fifth floor of the building.
