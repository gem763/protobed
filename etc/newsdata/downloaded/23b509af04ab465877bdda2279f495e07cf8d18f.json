Because Clinton for the most part won more densely populated parts of the country, many of them on the coasts, the map appears largely red even though Clinton received nearly 3 million more votes than Trump, who prevailed in the electoral college.\n\nAD\n\n7:10 a.m.: Trump once again claims his call was \u2018PERFECT\u2019\n\nTrump on Tuesday resurrected familiar defenses of his call with Zelensky, calling it \u201cPERFECT\u201d in one of a spate of tweets on the controversy and claiming he is the target of a \u201cHOAX!\u201d\n\nTrump also took fresh aim at Schiff, whom Trump suggested on Monday should be arrested for treason.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe congratulatory phone call with the Ukrainian President was PERFECT, unless you heard Liddle\u2019 Adam Schiff\u2019s fraudulently made up version of the call.

Schiff later said that it was meant as parody, which he said should have been obvious to Trump.\n\nAD\n\nDuring morning tweets, Trump also shared television clips of several allies defending him, including House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.).\n\nIn a tweet that included a clip of his appearance Monday night on Fox News, Scalise wrote: \u201cRadicals & socialists have taken over the Democrat Party. They\u2019re calling all the shots now. Just last week, they pressured Pelosi into launching a baseless impeachment inquiry based on false rumors & left-wing rage. This is a witch hunt of @realDonaldTrump, plain & simple.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nDuring his Tuesday morning tweets, Trump also touched on a few other topics, including a viral video of an airport cart spinning wildly on the tarmac at Chicago\u2019s O\u2019Hare International.\n\nAD\n\n6:30 a.m.: Kamala Harris calls on Twitter to suspend Trump\u2019s account\n\nSen.

The statute has never required that standard \u2014 a point Atkinson also made in his statement.\n\nAD", "description": "The president and his Republican allies continued to push back against a rapidly moving impeachment inquiry that will include depositions of key figures later this week.", "authors": ["John Wagner", "National Reporter Leading The Post'S Breaking Political News Team"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/NP-th6_wKR4jc_tEAxE30gXgli4=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4HVKSIHDXUI6TNAD644ITGMC2I.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
