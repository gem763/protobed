The child currently identifies as a girl at school and is called Luna by her teachers.\n\nMs Georgulas will also now be able to allow the child to undergo hormone replacement therapy.\n\n(Image: Facebook)\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Younger, who has moral and religious objections, told a podcast earlier this year that his child is not a girl and \"violently refuses to dress as girl at my house\".\n\nHe said: \"I want you to imagine having electronic communication with your son on FaceTime, and imagine that your ex-wife has dressed him as a drag queen to talk to you.\n\n\"He has false eyelashes and makeup. His hair has got glitter in it. He's wearing a dress.\n\n(Image: Facebook)\n\n\"Now imagine how you would feel seeing what I believe is actual sexual abuse - I believe this is not just emotional abuse but is the very, most fundamental form of sexual abuse, tampering with the sexual identity of a vulnerable boy. Every. Single. Day.\"\n\nWebsites and Facebook groups called 'Save James' have been set up and there is a GoFundMe page with around $40,000 in donations to help with Mr Younger's court costs.", "description": "Jeff Younger claimed his ex-wife Anne Georgulas had \"manipulated\" their son James into wearing dresses and believes the youngster is just \"confused\" with his identity", "authors": ["Amber Hicks", "Image", "Facebook"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20708768.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_THP_CHP_231019SLUG_6942JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
