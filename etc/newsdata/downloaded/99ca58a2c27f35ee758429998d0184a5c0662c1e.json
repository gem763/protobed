It was in the latter location, he told the Associated Press in 2006, that he received his greatest songwriting compliment, from a man who had no idea who he was.\n\n\u201cHe turned to me during \u2018Cumberland Blues\u2019 and said, \u2018I wonder what the guy who wrote that song a hundred years ago would think if he knew the Grateful Dead was doing it,\u2019 \u201d he recalled, referencing the colorful tale of hardscrabble American miners.\n\nOther of Mr. Hunter\u2019s most memorable Grateful Dead songs include \u201cIt Must Have Been the Roses,\u201d \u201cTerrapin Station,\u201d \u201cThe Days Between,\u201d \u201cBrown Eyed Women,\u201d \u201cJack Straw, \u201cFriend of the Devil,\u201d \u201cBox of Rain,\u201d \u201cUncle John\u2019s Band\u201d and \u201cBlack Muddy River.\u201d\n\nAlthough the man who spoke to him during \u201cCumberland Blues\u201d couldn\u2019t know it, he had perfectly captured Mr. Hunter\u2019s songwriting brilliance contained in all of those songs: the ability to craft lyrics that sounded so timeless that listeners were certain they had heard them before.\n\nIt was a skill he matched seamlessly with a boundless knowledge of subjects running the gamut from classic literature to street life, which in turn allowed him to write authoritatively about everyone from card sharks and hustlers to poor dirt farmers and free-spirited lovers.\n\nNotable deaths in 2019: Ric Ocasek, Valerie Harper, Ross Perot, Toni Morrison, and others we have lost this year share Share Email this link Share on Pinterest Share on LinkedIn View Photos View Photos Next Image Cokie Roberts | Cokie Roberts, a journalist and political commentator who became one of the most prominent Washington broadcasters of her era and championed young women in media during a long career with NPR and ABC News, died Sept. 17 in Washington. She was 75. Read the obituary (Marvin Joseph/The Washington Post)\n\nAll of those stories he seasoned with a poetic skill some would say rivaled even that of Bob Dylan, with whom he sometimes collaborated. \u201cHe\u2019s got a way with words and I do too,\u201d Dylan told Rolling Stone magazine in 2009. \u201cWe both write a different type of song than what passes today for songwriting.\u201d\n\n\u201cTruckin\u2019,\u201d arguably Mr. Hunter and the group\u2019s best known song (and the one containing the memorable line, \u201cWhat a long, strange trip it\u2019s been\u201d) was designated a national treasure in 1997 by the Library of Congress.\n\nIn more than a dozen verses it chronicled the travails of a touring band, among them the Grateful Dead\u2019s 1970 drug bust after a show in New Orleans: \u201cBusted, down on Bourbon Street. Set up, like a bowlin\u2019 pin. Knocked down. It gets to wearin\u2019 thin.\u201d\n\nAnother song, \u201cRipple,\u201d which was set to a maddening beautiful melody that Garcia composed on guitar, contains the lines Mr. Hunter once said he was most proud of: \u201cReach out your hand, if your cup be empty. If your cup is full, may it be again. Let it be known there is a fountain. That was not made by the hands of men.\u201d\n\nOnce asked by the Associated Press who his influences were, he laughed and replied that, \u201cjust to throw people off,\u201d he would often cite both the great 19th century theatrical songwriting team of Gilbert and Sullivan and the American folk music balladeer Woody Guthrie.\n\nAfter a moment\u2019s reflection, he added more seriously, \u201cActually, that\u2019s pretty close to the truth.\u201d\n\nBorn Robert Burns on June 23, 1941, Mr. Hunter was 7 when his father abandoned him and his mother, resulting in his spending several years in foster homes. It was an experience he said scarred him emotionally and left him feeling forever the outsider.\n\nWhen he was 11, his mother married McGraw-Hill publishing executive Norman Hunter, who gave the boy a new last name and an appreciation for such peerless writers as William Saroyan and T.S. Elliot.\n\nMr. Hunter toyed with becoming a novelist himself but music called and by his senior year of high school he was playing trumpet in a fusion Dixieland-rock band. He attended the University of Connecticut for one year where he studied drama, became a Pete Seeger fan and turned his interest to folk music.\n\nHe met Garcia in 1960 at a production of the musical \u201cDamn Yankees,\u201d introduced by a former girlfriend who by then was Garcia\u2019s first wife. The pair quickly formed a folk music duo called Bob and Jerry.\n\nBoth homeless for a time, they lived out of their cars, parking them side-by-side in a Palo Alto, Calif., vacant lot. They survived those days, both would say later, by eating tins of pineapple Mr. Hunter had pilfered from a military installation during his brief time in the National Guard.\n\nMr. Hunter had moved to New Mexico by the time Garcia, Bob Weir, Bill Kreutzmann, Phil Lesh and Ron \u201cPigpen\u201d McKernan had formed the Grateful Dead. Drummer Mickey Hart would join soon after.\n\nWhen Garcia asked him to send some lyrics along that could be set to music, Mr. Hunter quickly responded with future Grateful Dead classics \u201cChina Cat Sunflower\u201d and \u201cSt. Stephen.\u201d Garcia then asked him to return to the San Francisco Bay Area and write for the band.\n\nEventually Mr. Hunter would write for all of the group\u2019s members, and when the Grateful Dead was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994 he was included as the lyricist. He and Garcia were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2015.\n\nOver the years Mr. Hunter also released nearly a dozen albums of his own, published several volumes of poetry and co-wrote songs with Dylan. He also published two books translating the works of German poet Rainer Maria Rilke.\n\n\u201cBob was an intellectual and I can\u2019t tell you that there are a lot of intellectuals in the rock and roll business,\u201d longtime friend Barry \u201cThe Fish\u201d Melton of Country Joe and the Fish said in an interview.\n\n\u2014 Associated Press\n\nRead more Washington Post obituaries\n\nGeorge Lardner Jr., Washington Post reporter who received Pulitzer for investigation of his daughter\u2019s murder, dies at 85\n\nMark Plotkin, D.C. political commentator and statehood champion, dies at 72\n\nChristopher Rouse, expressionistic composer who won Pulitzer Prize, dies at 70", "description": "He wrote songs including \u201cTruckin,\u2019\u201d \u201cIt Must Have Been the Roses\u201d and \u201cTerrapin Station.\u201d", "authors": ["John Rogers"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/FB7LUT1CZ4hU7IPRSjyrIetRq-Q=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GLIHTSW7CYI6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
