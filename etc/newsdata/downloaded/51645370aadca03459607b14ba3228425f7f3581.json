That\u2019s rare. He was 21-of-33 for 160 yards, no passing touchdowns and an interception in a 16-10 loss to the Carolina Panthers. It was a rough loss, especially at home to a Panthers team without Cam Newton.\n\nHours after the game, Watson apparently couldn\u2019t let it go. He was back on the field in an empty stadium, working on solutions.\n\nDeshaun Watson puts in extra work\n\nAaron Wilson of the Houston Chronicle posted a video from the press box at NRG Stadium that showed Watson working with private quarterbacks coach Quincy Avery.\n\nDeshaun Watson took this loss to heart and is already making corrections.

Some are obvious, like arm strength or nimble feet.\n\nSome things aren\u2019t so obvious, and might be the most important.\n\nWatson has been up and down this season\n\nWatson had a remarkable college career, was on a record pace as an NFL rookie before another ACL injury, and then bounced back strong from that injury last year. Despite getting hit a ton behind a leaky offensive line, Watson was great last season and led the Texans to an AFC South championship.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis season has been a mixed bag. He had some great moments, like in a huge Week 3 win at the Los Angeles Chargers. Sunday was one of the worst games of his NFL career. It happens to everyone. But Watson recognized that and even after battling for three hours against a tough Panthers defense, he wanted to get back on the football field and correct things.\n\nNot that Texans fans didn\u2019t know it already, but you\u2019re in good hands with your franchise quarterback.\n\nHouston Texans quarterback Deshaun Watson had a rough game in a loss to the Panthers.
