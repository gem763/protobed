He recognised Turkey\u2019s role at the forefront of the fight against [Isis] and its generosity in supporting refugees who\u2019ve fled the civil war in Syria.\n\nKurdish forces in Syria will no longer prioritise guarding Isis prisons Read more\n\n\u201cBut the prime minister was clear that the UK cannot support Turkey\u2019s military action. He urged the president to end the operation and enter into dialogue, and said the UK and international partners stand ready to support negotiations towards a ceasefire.\u201d\n\nSince the attacks began last Wednesday, aid agencies estimate that 100,000 people have already fled their homes near the Turkey-Syria border. Some reports estimate that between 20 and 40 people had been killed, fighters and civilians and another suggests five Islamic State suspects have escaped from prison in Qamishli after Turkish shelling. Hundreds more Isis suspects are being guarded by Kurdish forces.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Kurds in Greece protest outside Turkish embassy in Athens. Several European cities saw protests.

Germany is one of Turkey\u2019s main suppliers of weapons.\n\nHours later, France\u2019s defence and foreign ministries made an announcement stating their opposition to the Turkish military operation, and said they too had suspended all planned exports of \u201cwar materials\u201d to Turkey.\n\nThe EU\u2019s foreign affairs committee will meet in Luxembourg tomorrow to decide a co-ordinated, \u201cEurope-wide\u201d approach, the French ministries said.\n\nFinland, Norway and The Netherlands have already announced that they are stopping arms exports to the country.

The attacks began after Donald Trump pulled US forces out of the area last week.\n\nEarlier, Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, faced criticism from a Turkish representative at the Nato Parliamentary Assembly in London on Saturday, after he said Turkey should show \u201cmaximum restraint\u201d.\n\nThe Turkish member told him that Turkey\u2019s operation was \u201cnot an invasion\u201d but a \u201ccounter-terror operation\u201d but Raab replied: \u201cI just don\u2019t agree. The risk is with the counter-terrorism operation you describe, taking on the SDF (Syrian Democratic Forces) and the broader objectives, is that it is weakening the overarching counter-terrorism goal of countering Daesh.\u201d", "description": "PM tells Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan of \u2018grave concern\u2019 at Turkey\u2019s military incursion", "authors": ["James Tapper"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e388f4198c30e00530bbd4c90ab302f9ed25a04a/0_17_1608_964/master/1608.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=53f1b2ac438449c14e954e9cc37c46df", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
