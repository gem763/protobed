Bernstein announced Tuesday the launch of Moe, an online tool for influencers to manage multiple campaigns, collaborate on projects, and generate invoices to get paid.\n\n\"None of the [platforms] out there address the needs of influencers themselves,\" Bernstein told Business Insider. \"We want to put the power back in the influencer's hands ... and it's created by someone who knows the workflow best.\"\n\nMoe borrows its name from Bernstein's long-time assistant Moe Peretti, who has long been in charge of completing all of these various tasks for the WeWoreWhat brand, and now serves as the its chief brand officer. As Bernstein put it simply to Business Insider: \"Everybody needs a Moe.\"\n\nA screenshot of MOE Assist, WeWoreWhat's influencer workflow manager. Moe Assist Bernstein says Moe is meant for micro-influencers \u2014 generally, anyone with between 1,000 and 100,000 followers \u2014 who have a growing brand to manage, but aren't yet big enough to hire a team for invoicing and scheduling.\n\nThe idea of Moe is to take the place of an assistant who would organize various documents and content across an influencers' email addresses, social media platforms, Google Docs, and whatever else is used. Moe also allows for collaboration on campaigns between influencers and brands, who may need an easy way to share changes and comments on projects.\n\nWhile much of the work into Moe has been self-funded by Bernstein, Moe has also raised $1.2 million in seed funding from private investors, including fashion brand founder Rebecca Minkoff.\n\nThe WeWoreWhat team has beta-tested Moe with around 25 influencers in the last few months ahead of Tuesday's launch, Berstein said.\n\nMoe costs $28 a month to use, and also offers a 30-day free trial to test out before you buy.", "description": "Danielle Bernstein, the name behind popular fashion influencer WeWoreWhat, released project management platform Moe on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Paige Leskin"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d93c97b2e22af6a956b1e7b?width=1200&format=jpeg"}
