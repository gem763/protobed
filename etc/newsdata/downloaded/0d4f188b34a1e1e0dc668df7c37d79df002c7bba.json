If sales come in rapidly on popular routes then prices go up,\" said John Strickland, an airline analyst at JLS Consulting.\n\nMr Strickland said September was a popular time for people to take holidays outside the peak school holiday period and many flights were already very full.\n\nHe said the airlines could decide to halt price increases, but said firms had to be commercially driven.\n\n\"Thomas Cook has failed because it had massive debts and it was making a loss. It's a fragile industry. More than a dozen airlines have gone bust.\n\n\"If the airlines don't make profits where they can on a minority of flights then they don't stand a chance of surviving.\"\n\nHow is the repatriation effort going?\n\nMeanwhile, Dame Deirdre Hutton, chairwoman of the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), described stage one of the repatriation of holidaymakers on Monday as \"a pretty good day for a first day\".\n\nShe told BBC 5 Live's Wake Up to Money: \"We ran 64 flights, we brought back just under 15,000 people. That was over 90% of those we intended to bring back.\n\n\"I'm conscious that we've got a huge job to do still, because that's about 8% of the total, but a reasonable start.\n\n\"We've got 74 flights today and are hoping to bring back 16,500 people, but (have) 13 days to go and 135,000 passengers still to bring back.\n\n\"The cost split is 60% Atol and 40% non-Atol.\"\n\nDame Deirdre added that she wanted to emphasise: \"Nobody is stranded, everybody will get their holiday and they will be brought back at the time they would have come back anyway.\"\n\nWhat sort of price rises are people experiencing?\n\nHolidaymaker Angela Mills said a flight from Glasgow to Rhodes, Greece, was \u00a3280 on Sunday, but was now \u00a31,000.\n\nShe was due to fly from Glasgow to Rhodes on Wednesday on Thomas Cook flights. When she looked for alternatives after the travel firm's collapse, the cheapest price she could find for replacement flights for her and her husband was more than \u00a31,000.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Many passengers face a long journey home\n\nThe company she booked her accommodation through - Jetline Holidays - eventually found her an alternative deal costing \u00a3600 extra.\n\nBut she will now have to fly from Edinburgh, and on her return spend a night in Prague before flying back from there.\n\nMrs Mills said she hoped to claim the additional cost of the flights from her travel insurance on her return.\n\nWhat are my rights?\n\nImage copyright PA Media\n\nAnyone who has bought a future package holiday with Thomas Cook is covered by the Air Travel Organiser's Licence scheme (Atol). This means they will not be going away, but the cost of the holiday will be refunded.\n\nHowever, Atol protection does not cover flight-only deals. The main alternative for travellers is to claim a refund from the provider of the credit or debit card they used, or make a claim on their travel insurance.\n\nWhat are your rights?

I'm now in a position where I might need to cancel it altogether,\" he said.\n\nHowever, Nigel Wilson said he had managed to beat the price increases by booking new flights for his holiday from Manchester to Marrakech at 12.30am BST on Monday morning.\n\nThe flights for his family of four cost him an additional \u00a3640, but he said when he checked prices later on Monday, the cost had risen to \u00a31,500.\n\n\"If we had waited we wouldn't have had the funds to book more tickets at that price,\" he said.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Thomas Cook employees react to the company's collapse\n\nWere you a member of staff at Thomas Cook?
