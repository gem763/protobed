A Japanese athletic company supposedly started the 10,000 step recommendation in the Sixties. It released a pedometer called manpo-kei (translated as the 10,000 step meter). The company claim this was based on a study by Kyushu University of Health and Welfare on the benefits of taking 10,000 steps. The study could not be traced. Many fitness trackers, including Fitbit, start everyone off with a 10,000-step goal. Adding up to roughly 30 minutes of daily exercise, the goal does satisfy the CDC and NHS recommendation of at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise per week. However, although the NHS supports the '10,000 step challenge' as an easy way of boosting our activity levels, it still recommends we do at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise a week on top of two or more days of muscle-strengthening sessions. Some experts warn the 10,000 step recommendation may have been pulled out of thin air. Dr. James Borchers, director of sports medicine, Ohio State University said: 'There's nothing magical about it other than it's a nice, round number,' reported US News and World Report. Older people or those with a chronic disease may also be unable to walk this distance.\n\nThese were encouragements to hit 10,000 steps, hourly reminders to stand up, or personalised coaching incentives.\n\nThose who were typically more sedentary may be advised to take a morning stroll, while those who are naturally more active may receive encouragement to keep up consistent physical activity.\n\nThe fourth intervention was to read health guidelines from the American Heart Association (AHA).\n\nThese include measures such as 'eat a variety of fruit and vegetable servings every day' and 'eat fish at least two times each week'.\n\nEvery week, participants completed a new intervention until they'd experienced all four.\n\nA modest increase of ten per cent in step count - 266 steps per day on average - was seen across all participants by the end of the study.\n\nProfessor Ashley said: 'Sure, we would have rather seen a 300 per cent increase, but with the light-touch interventions that we chose, it was probably never realistic to expect those numbers.\n\n'But the main takeaway is that at end of the day, we find that there's a real, small positive effect from these interventions.'\n\nIn their next trial, the team plan to investigate how long participants keep up their new-found routine and if they can personalise the daily pings better.\n\nProfessor Ashley said: 'We don't want to make it too complicated. And we aren't ignoring the fact that even a single simple prompt did increase steps.\n\n'But different things motivate different people, and if we can play to that, it may help participants reach a new level of activity.'\n\nThe study was led by led by Stanford graduate student Anna Shcherbina and Dr Steven Hershman, director of Stanford's mHealth.\n\nExperts have long debated the effectiveness of fitness trackers which promote 10,000 steps a day because there is little scientific support behind the number.\n\nHowever, the general consensus among public health officials is any increase in activity levels is worth-while.", "description": "Participants in a Stanford study were encouraged to move more with phone notifications.
