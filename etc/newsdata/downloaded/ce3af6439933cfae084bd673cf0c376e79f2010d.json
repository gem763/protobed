(JXWC) Long-Term Foreign- and Local-Currency Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) of 'BBB'. The Outlook is Stable. JXWC is the sole provincial-level water infrastructure and assets investment, development and operation vehicle in the Jiangxi province. It is the investment platform of various key water conservation projects in Jiangxi, and provides water supply for over 40% of the province. Key Rating Drivers 'Very Strong' Status, Ownership and Control: JXWC is a limited liability company under the robust control and supervision of the Jiangxi province. The Jiangxi provincial government owns 100% of its equity shares in JXWC via the provincial Department of Water Resources. The government's approval is required for senior management appointments and major investment and financing activities. JXWC is one of the main government-related entities (GREs) in Jiangxi, focusing on water-related infrastructure construction and asset operation. 'Strong' Support Record and Expectations: Fitch estimates that the water-related business will continue to account for the majority of ZXWC's revenue and transfers and grants from the public sector. JXWC receives support from the Jiangxi province mainly via contracted payments under its infrastructure construction and water supply projects, and transfers and grants from the public sector. Transfers and grants accounted for 17%, on average, of total revenue a year during 2016-2018. The government has issued policies to support JXWC on centralising and managing major reservoirs. 'Moderate' Socio-Political Implications of Default: Fitch believes the government is likely to use administrative and fiscal measures to ensure basic operation of key subsidiaries are not disrupted in the case of a JXWC default. Other GREs or private-sector companies could substitute for JXWC with only minor or temporary disruption to the services. JXWC acts as the provincial investment representative in strategic water-related businesses, including water control infrastructure construction, water supply and reservoir management. The company is the only provincial-level GRE focusing on this business area. 'Moderate' Financial Implications of Default: Fitch believes that a JXWC default from government failure to provide sufficient support would have a moderate impact on the availability and cost of other GREs' domestic and foreign financing options. We estimate JXWC's debts account for a moderate share of Jiangxi's overall risk. JXWC's operating assets and liabilities cover a wide range of water or environmental-related business sectors, including renewable energy and ecological protection projects. 'b' Category Standalone Credit Profile: We assess under Fitch's Public Sector, Revenue-Supported Entities Rating Criteria that JXWC's revenue defensibility is 'Midrange', based on the company's 'Strong' business volume defensibility and 'Weak' bargaining power on prices. We assess JXWC's operating risk as 'Midrange', based on the relatively predictable cost structure. In addition, we assess the financial profile as 'Weaker' due to the company's high capex and leverage. Fitch expects net leverage to remain at above 20x for the next two years, mitigated by a liquidity cushion of 7.7x of operating expenses. Derivation Summary Fitch assessed JXWC under its Government-Related Entities (GRE) Rating Criteria, reflecting Jiangxi province's ultimate ownership and oversight over JXWC, a record of financial support and the company's functional role in Jiangxi's development, a key strategic initiative of the government. These factors indicate a strong incentive by the sponsor to provide extraordinary support to JXWC, if needed. JXWC's IDR was derived from the four factors under our GRE Rating Criteria and the Standalone Credit Profile of 'b' category from our Public Sector, Revenue-Supported Entities Rating Criteria. RATING SENSITIVITIES The ratings on JXWC would be affected by a change in Fitch's perception of the Jiangxi province's ability to provide subsidies, grants or other legitimate resources allowed under China's policies and regulations. An increase in incentive for the Jiangxi province to provide support to JXWC, including stronger socio-political and financial implications of a default by JXWC and a stronger record of support, may trigger positive rating action on JXWC. In contrast, the rating may be downgraded if there is a significant weakening in the socio-political and financial implications of a default by JXWC, a weaker record of support by the province, or a dilution in the government's shareholding.

In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.

A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent).
