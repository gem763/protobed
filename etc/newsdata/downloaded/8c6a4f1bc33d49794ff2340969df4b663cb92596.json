With no top-level meetings in sight anytime soon, investors\n\npondered how much longer the ugly trade spat, that has roiled\n\nfinancial markets around the world, will continue.\n\nInvestors are also in a wait-and-watch mode ahead of Brexit\n\ntalks later in the session, which will determine how Britain\n\nwill part with the European Union.\n\nGlobal stocks barely moved as soft U.S. data raised\n\nconcerns about the health of the U.S. economy and risks of\n\nglobal recession, given consumption has been one of few\n\nremaining bright spots in the global economy.
