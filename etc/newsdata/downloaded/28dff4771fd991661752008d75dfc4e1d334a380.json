Instead, a ledger of transactions is maintained by a decentralised network of computers.\n\nThis system of decentralisation offers non-profit organisations the advantage of bypassing expensive fees and middlemen traditionally required to move large amounts of cash overseas quickly.\n\nBut the virtual currencies have also been divisive. They are associated with huge price fluctuations, and have been previously used as a mechanism to support illicit activities such as money laundering and online drug dealing.\n\nChristopher Fabian, principal adviser at Unicef Innovation, said the initiative would prepare the organisation for the future while also maintaining safeguards built into existing donor systems. \u201cWe see this as a piece of learning that we need to go through to prepare for the next decade,\u201d he said.\n\nFor aid organisations, cryptocurrencies make tracking donations easier, and have the potential to allow donors to see how their money is used.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an interest in speed and efficiency,\u201d said Fabian. \u201cWe have a good capacity to move money globally, but there\u2019s always friction.\u201d\n\nRecent years have seen a mushrooming of cryptocurrencies \u2013 even Facebook launched its own coin \u2013 the libra \u2013 in 2019. Interest from philanthropic organisations in virtual currencies has seen the creation of AidCoin and Pinkcoin, tailored for the aid sector.\n\nUnicef joins a number of aid agencies that have started accepting donations in virtual coins, including the American Red Cross and the UN World Food Programme.\n\nRhodri Davies, head of policy at the Charities Aid Foundation, said that the initial excitement about currencies using blockchain technology in the aid sector had delivered smaller windfalls than had been hoped. \u201cIt\u2019s been a lot slower than people might have expected two or three years ago,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said successes of the cryptocurrency donation model were largely limited to internet-based charities \u2013 to organisations such as Wikimedia or the Electronic Frontier Foundation.\n\nIn 2019, Fidelity Charitable, a charity that distributes money through donor-advised funds in the US, reported receiving donations of $106m (\u00a387m) in virtual money since 2015 \u2013 though volatility in the currencies may have affected the value of the donations.\n\nThe new Unicef fund will hold donations and disburse them in the same cryptocurrency \u2013 initiatives funded through it will sign contracts denominated in the same type of virtual coinage.\n\nFabian said to reduce risks caused by the currencies\u2019 volatility, most of the initial projects funded in this way would be short-term.\n\nHe said the organisation would also uphold existing donor protocols \u2013 so those making donations online would have to pass rigorous checks before they were allowed to deposit funds to Unicef.", "description": "Use of cryptocurrencies allows children\u2019s agency to bypass fees of moving cash overseas quickly and increase financial transparency", "authors": ["Vidhi Doshi"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2019/10/08/new_GettyImages-1046001908.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e1b348b0065ca1de453a1b5cb3423361", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
