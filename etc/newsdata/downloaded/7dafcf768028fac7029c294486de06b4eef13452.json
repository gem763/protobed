They left Atlanta with their mojo regained, thanks to the impressive trifecta of a blowout win, a viral wrestling move by their defensive rock and the in-week addition of one of the finest cornerbacks in the game.\n\nThe Rams notched only one win in the standings from Sunday\u2019s 37-10 annihilation of the Falcons, but it felt like much more than that. Jalen Ramsey, a Ram for all of five days, brought the secondary a swagger it hadn\u2019t had in weeks, if not months. Ramsey joined Los Angeles in exchange for two first-round picks and a fourth-rounder, and immediately proved why it cost so much to pry him out of Jacksonville. After all, not everybody could take a month off in the middle of the season and match up with Julio Jones on his first play from scrimmage.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nRamsey entered the game on the Rams\u2019 third defensive snap, mouthguard dangling \u2014 as it always does \u2014 from his facemask. (It\u2019s easier to talk clear, unimpeded trash that way.) From that play right on through the end of the game, he and Jones jabbed at each other on every snap, and when the Falcons weren\u2019t able to convert on third down \u2014 which happened nine times out of 12 this game \u2014 Ramsey would hop-skip back to the Los Angeles sideline, jawing all the way at the Falcons sideline in general and Jones in particular.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt was an impressive performance for Ramsey given that the team wasn\u2019t sure what condition he\u2019d be in after a month-long layoff. He\u2019d cited illness, the birth of his child and a back injury as reasons why he couldn\u2019t play for Jacksonville in Weeks 4-6. He sure seemed game-ready on Sunday, whether he was checking Jones at the line or diving to punch the ball out of Devonta Freeman\u2019s hands.\n\nJalen Ramsey shadows Julio Jones. (Getty)\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you can say enough about his ability to digest the game plan,\u201d Rams head coach Sean McVay said. \u201cHe\u2019s kept himself in good shape \u2026 I think it\u2019s just a credit to our defensive coaches and then Jalen\u2019s ability to really demonstrate what a smart, cerebral player he is in addition to an elite skill set. To be able to come in on such short notice, with such short practice time and to be able to play the way that he did, it was a big boost to our team for sure.\u201d\n\nGranted, Ramsey wasn\u2019t flawless on the day. He gave up a huge 39-yard play to Jones in the waning moments of the first half. The Rams simplified their defensive schemes to account for Ramsey, but they also took advantage of his skills to let him do what he does best \u2014 throw a blanket over the other team\u2019s top receiver.\n\n\u201cOur coaches did a good job as far as, like, making it easy for him,\u201d fellow cornerback Troy Hill said. \u201cWe kept talking to him. Communication was big out there. I felt like we gelled out there.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel like I played OK,\u201d Ramsey said. \u201cI got to get in my groove a little bit more. There\u2019s maybe one, maybe two plays that I wanted to have back or play a little bit different \u2026 I want to know my safeties and know the guys I\u2019m out with. I really trusted them a lot.\u201d\n\nRamsey specializes in an in-your-face man-to-man defense that neutralizes an opponent\u2019s best asset. He has been the ultimate shutdown cornerback since his days at Florida State, where he was the first true freshman to start at corner since a guy by the name of Deion. He edges up to the line, right in the receiver\u2019s face, and cocks his arms like he\u2019s about to get in the ring. And then it\u2019s on.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t shy away from anybody, any challenge, any receiver,\u201d safety Eric Weddle said. \u201cYou don\u2019t know how his body is going to react. We had limited role for him, I just talked to him \u2026 just so he can play fast. It was fun.\u201d\n\nThe Rams defense held Ryan to 16 completions, 159 yards and a 60.6 rating, all season lows. Ryan was one of the lone standouts of this miserable Falcons season, and the Rams took even that away from Atlanta.\n\n\u201cIt was a full team effort,\u201d Ramsey said. \u201cWe played sticky defense, sticky coverage, and a lot of man. I only had a couple of days to prepare so I really appreciate the guys going with their game plan because it wasn\u2019t the best for them.\u201d\n\nYou have to grade Sunday\u2019s performance on a curve because the Falcons are just a horrendous ballclub, a red-and-black trash fire. Still, Jared Goff looked poised, Todd Gurley snared a beauty of a receiving touchdown, the defense knocked Ryan out of the game, and the special teams\u2019 relentlessness added an elbow-drop touchdown in the game\u2019s final seconds.\n\n\u201cBringing Jalen on the team, having him match up against their best receiver, it completed us in the secondary,\u201d cornerback Nickell Robey-Coleman said. \u201cThat\u2019s a commend to him, coming in cold turkey, coming into [defensive coordinator] Wade [Phillips\u2019] schemes \u2014 they\u2019re not the easiest scheme because you\u2019ve got a lot to learn \u2014 to have him come and do what he did today, it just shows good signs for the future.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a bit of nice circularity in Sunday\u2019s blowout, if you\u2019re into that sort of thing: it was in this very building, eight months and 17 days ago, that the Rams got their spine, their spirit and their soul crushed in the Super Bowl. You could argue that the team hasn\u2019t recovered from the Patriots beatdown; Goff has looked ordinary, and Gurley hasn\u2019t even hit the level that made him a star. The offense\u2019s efficiency has fallen from No. 2 last year to No. 17 this year, per Football Outsiders. Thanks to losses against Seattle and San Francisco, Los Angeles is already a distant third in the race for the NFC West.\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt Sunday injected some life into this team. Granted, there\u2019s only so much Ramsey can do on the field \u2014 he can\u2019t help Goff make better decisions in the pocket, for instance. But he brings a presence that radiates throughout the secondary. That corner of the Rams\u2019 locker room already sounds like they\u2019re ready to run through walls for Ramsey.\n\n\u201cObviously he\u2019s the best corner in the league. We just helped him with a little bit of coverage. A player like him can hop in and just do his thing,\u201d safety Marqui Christian said. \u201cWhen you got a guy like him, that\u2019s one half of the field locked down.\u201d\n\nThe rest of the locker room was as relaxed as you\u2019ll see in pro sports, laughter and trash-talking at every turn. High on the list of did-you-see\u2019s: Aaron Donald\u2019s Darth Vader-style hoisting of Freeman during a scuffle. More than one Rams player could be seen wiggling his fingers like a baby caught in the grip of a parent. Those are the kind of SportsCenter highlights you don\u2019t mind seeing on a loop.\n\nThis could mark the start of a run back to the postseason for Los Angeles. With all due respect to Cincinnati, Chicago and Pittsburgh, the Rams won\u2019t face another elite-level quarterback for another four weeks, until Baltimore comes to town in late November. By then, Ramsey will be fully integrated into the Rams defense.\n\n\u201cThis is what we can do,\u201d Weddle said. \u201cWe just hadn\u2019t been able to do it \u2026 I don\u2019t know our ceiling, I just want to keep doing this.\u201d\n\nRamsey wasn\u2019t in trash-talk mode after the game, but he did offer up one final bit of commentary that ought to chill opposing quarterbacks: \u201cIf I was really in my groove, like on my [stuff], it would really be scary out there,\u201d he smiled. \u201cI\u2019ll put it that way.\u201d\n\n____\n\nJay Busbee is a writer for Yahoo Sports.
