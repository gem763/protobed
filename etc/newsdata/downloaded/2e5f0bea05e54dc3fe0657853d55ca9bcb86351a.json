Habibie waves to journalists as he arrives to testify in the trial of former military chief at a court in Jakarta in 2003. (Achmad Ibrahim/AP)\n\nB.J. Habibie, a former Indonesian president who allowed democratic reforms and an independence referendum for East Timor following the ouster of the dictator Suharto, died Sept. 11 at an army hospital in Jakarta. He was 83.\n\nMr. Habibie, Indonesia\u2019s third president, had been undergoing treatment for heart problems, said his son, Thareq Kemal Habibie.\n\nMr. Habibie\u2019s unpopular presidency was the shortest in modern Indonesia\u2019s history but was transformative. He was tapped to lead Indonesia by Suharto as the military dictator\u2019s 32-year hold on power crumbled in May 1998 during a student uprising and a devastating economic crash. It ended after only 16 months, in October 1999, when he withdrew from contention in presidential elections.\n\nAn engineer educated in Indonesia, the Netherlands and Germany, Mr. Habibie spent nearly two decades working for German aircraft maker Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm before returning to Indonesia in 1974 to help lead Suharto\u2019s campaign to industrialize the economy.\n\nAs president, Mr. Habibie apologized for past human rights abuses and outlined an eight-point reform program \u201cto build a just, open and democratic society.\u201d He ordered the release of political prisoners, dismantled restrictions on the news media and reformed politics to allow for free elections.\n\nHe lifted a three-decade-old ban on the speaking and teaching of Mandarin as part of an easing of discriminatory policies against ethnic Chinese that was instituted by Suharto after his anti-communist pogroms of 1965-66.\n\n\n\nFormer Indonesian president B.J. Habibie in 2010. (Barbara Walton/AP)\n\nResponding to international criticism of Indonesia\u2019s occupation of Portugal\u2019s former colony of East Timor, Mr. Habibie surprised Indonesians by announcing in January 1999 a plan to hold a referendum under U.N. supervision on self-determination, offering a choice between special autonomy and independence.\n\nIndonesian militias sought to intimidate people into voting for continued union, but East Timorese voted overwhelmingly to split from Indonesia.\n\nIn 2017, the young democracy held presidential and parliamentary elections that were the first without U.N. supervision since peacekeepers left in 2012.\n\nDespite his reforms, Mr. Habibie was unable to master the political tumult unleashed by the student uprising.\n\nHe described the bloody riots that ended Suharto\u2019s dictatorship as \u201cbarbaric,\u201d further alienating students who feared he was betraying their democratic revolution and staged violent protests against his presidency.\n\n\n\nHabibie in 2007. (Achmad Ibrahim/AP)\n\nA failure to prosecute a longtime friend over allegations of massive corruption undermined his campaign to stay in power. On Oct. 20, 1999, Mr. Habibie withdrew from upcoming presidential elections.\n\nParliament was already moving to elect a new head of state after lawmakers rejected his \u201caccountability\u201d speech on the successes and failures of his months in office.\n\nBacharuddin Jusuf Habibie was born in the South Sulawesi town of Parepare on June 25, 1936, and was the fourth of eight siblings.\n\nHis father was of native Sulawesi descent and his mother a Javanese noblewoman from the ancient sultanate of Yogyakarta. His wife, Hasri Ainun Habibie, a medical doctor, died in 2010.
