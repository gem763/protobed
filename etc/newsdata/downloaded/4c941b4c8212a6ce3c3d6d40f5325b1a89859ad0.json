If you like something, you give it a warm score. If you don\u2019t, you give it a cold one.\n\nIn its newest iteration of that question, Pew found that more than three-quarters of both Democrats and Republicans expressed at least \u201csomewhat\u201d cold views of the other party \u2014 and that about 6 in 10 partisans expressed \u201cvery cold\u201d views of the opposition. For both parties, both metrics were higher than at any point in Pew\u2019s past polling.\n\nWhat\u2019s fascinating is that people understand the partisan divide is growing and even that respondents express concern about those divisions.\n\nFor example, 6 in 10 Democrats say there\u2019s a \u201cgreat deal\u201d of difference between the parties, a sentiment with which three-quarters of Republicans agree. More than three-quarters of each group sees the partisan divide as growing. Democrats are more likely to say they\u2019re at least somewhat concerned about those divisions than are Republicans.\n\nThat said, a lot of people in both parties hold the sort of negative views of the opposition that contribute to the divide.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNearly three-quarters of each group believes the two parties can\u2019t even agree on basic facts. This is probably related to something we wrote about on Thursday: the partisan gulf in confidence in the media.\n\nMost members of each party also say that, even beyond politics, members of the opposing party don\u2019t share the same values and goals. Nearly half of Democrats say Republicans have no good ideas or almost no good ideas, up from 2016. More than half of Republicans say the same of Democrats.\n\nPew also found that Democrats and Republicans are more likely to refer to members of the other party as \u201cclosed-minded\u201d and \u201cimmoral\u201d than they were three years ago. (The changes in \u201clazy\u201d and \u201cunintelligent\u201d are more modest. Silver lining!)\n\nOne question goes unanswered in Pew\u2019s analysis: What do we do with this? What\u2019s the strategy for reversing the situation?\n\nThat temperatures warmed slightly after the 2016 election would seem like a good sign: Electoral politics over, partisans looked at the other side slightly more warmly.\n\nThen Trump was inaugurated.\n\nAD", "description": "Even while people worry more about the gulf between Democrats and Republicans, they adhere to the drivers of it.", "authors": ["Philip Bump", "National Correspondent Focused Largely On The Numbers Behind Politics"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/M3iemxmNBLB4TOfdOfchfCAgdQE=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KY3OGUXL3YI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
