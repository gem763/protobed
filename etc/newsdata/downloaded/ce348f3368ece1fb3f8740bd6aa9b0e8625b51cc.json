Cho has denied the allegations against him.\n\nHis nomination galvanized Moon\u2019s progressive supporters who see Cho as furthering the president\u2019s agenda on transforming the prosecutors\u2019 office. Opponents of the president see Cho as unfit for the job and the appointment as a needless diversion at a time when the economy is flagging and Moon is in a bruising trade battle with Japan.\n\n\u201cI thought it would be a bad precedent if I weren\u2019t to appoint him when illegal actions were not confirmed,\u201d Moon said in remarks televised nationwide Monday. \u201cI will leave efforts for reform toward organizations of authority in Minister Cho Kuk\u2019s hands. I ask people for understanding and support.\u201d\n\nCollision Course\n\nThe appointment puts Cho on a collision course with prosecutors who have been looking into the corruption and nepotism allegations. Moon didn\u2019t need parliamentary approval to make the appointment.\n\nAmong the allegations are that Cho\u2019s daughter was able to win admission to a prestigious university after she was credited as a main author of a published scientific paper while a high school student on a brief internship. Another allegation is that his family made a hefty profit on a questionable investment in a private equity fund.\n\nCho denied the allegations at the marathon news conference and during questioning in parliament Friday. \u201cPersonally I would like to return as a civilian and I\u2019d like to see my family, but I have one more calling as a public official, so I came out to this seat today despite the grievances,\u201d he told lawmakers.\n\nIn a poll by Real Meter released Friday, 56.2% of South Koreans respondents opposed appointing Cho, while 40.1% were in favor.\n\nMoon is about midway through his five-year term and the economic outlook has turned gloomy for South Korea\u2019s export-dependent economy, which this year is forecast to expand at the weakest pace in a decade.\n\nMaking matters worse for Moon is an intensifying trade battle with Japan. Tokyo has placed export controls on three specialist materials that are crucial for the production of semiconductors and displays by South Korean powerhouses such as Samsung Electronics.\n\n(Recasts first paragraph and adds Moon quotes in fourth paragraph.)\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Jihye Lee in Seoul at jlee2352@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Brendan Scott at bscott66@bloomberg.net, Jon Herskovitz, Peter Pae\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- South Korean President Moon Jae-in asked for public understanding after he appointed as justice minister a close confidant who faced a grilling in the media and in parliament over corruption allegations.Cho Kuk, who served as the administration\u2019s first presidential senior secretary for", "authors": ["Jihye Lee"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/_YSrAkZhypDT2PHqbxv9YQ--~B/aD0xMzMzO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/fdac3decdc973f80628448f968a1c5c3", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
