The four previous bookings fell apart for a variety of injury and weight-cut reasons.\n\n\"It'll be an interesting one, I think Khabib would probably beat him,\" McGregor said to the media in Kiev as part of public engagement on behalf of online sports betting outfit Parimatch.\n\n\"Again, you\u2019ve got to see what the circumstances are. Anyone can win on any given day. Tony is a formidable fighter. Also, he\u2019s very, very, tough. He does go down. He does get dropped. His guard has been passed. He's been mounted by a lesser fighter. So I would favor Khabib in that bout.\"\n\nDespite backing Nurmagomedov in his next bout, McGregor also outlined the shift in his own strategy which he says would be necessary to win back the UFC lightweight championship if and when the two superstar fighters ever meet again.\n\n\n\n\"I believe we overestimated his grappling severely,\" McGregor said.\n\n\"And we also underestimated his striking. So there are things we will correct. I will go on the offensive from a grappling standpoint. I believe I was winning the clinch exchanges in round three in the bout.\n\nAlso on rt.com Conor McGregor to hold Moscow press conference on Thursday after Khabib feud explodes again\n\n\"But it was a little too late, a little too little, too late in the bout. And also my lack of commitment and, you know, I wasn\u2019t as fully committed as I should be carrying injuries and whatnot. So there\u2019s many things we can improve and sharpen up when the rematch happens.\"\n\nMcGregor's return to the octagon is also expected early next year, with names like Justin Gaethje and Frankie Edgar linked as potential next opponents for the Irish star.", "description": "Speaking at an event in Ukraine, Conor McGregor said that heated rival Khabib Nurmagomedov would likely defeat Tony Ferguson amid rumors of an early 2020 title fight between the two top-ranked UFC lightweights.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdni.rt.com/files/2019.10/article/5db0481f85f540235664b45e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
