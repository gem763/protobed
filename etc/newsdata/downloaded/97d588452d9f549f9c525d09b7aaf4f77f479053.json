Amy Klobuchar said Sunday she would not allow the child of her hypothetical vice president to sit on a foreign board, as former Vice President Joseph R. Biden\u2019s son did.\n\nAsked if she would be \u201ccomfortable\u201d with such an arrangement, the Minnesota Democrat said, \u201cNo, I wouldn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I can promise you right now my own daughter who\u2019s only 24 does not sit on the board of a foreign company, but that is not the issue,\u201d Ms. Klobuchar said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cThe issue here is what the president is doing.\u201d\n\nTwo other Democratic presidential hopefuls \u2014 Sen. Kamala Harris and former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke \u2014 have also said they had problems with the idea of the children of vice presidents serving as Hunter Biden did on the board of a Ukrainian energy company, where he was paid up to $50,000 per month despite having no apparent qualifications.\n\nOn #CNNSOTU @amyklobuchar tells @jaketapper that she would not be comfortable with the child of her Vice President sitting on a foreign board \u2014 State of the Union (@CNNSotu) October 6, 2019\n\n\u201cI would not allow a family member, anyone in my cabinet, to have a family member work in a position like that,\u201d said Mr. O\u2019Rourke after the Service Employees International Union\u2019s presidential forum on Saturday, according to the Washington Examiner.\n\nAsked last month if she would allow her vice president\u2019s child to serve on the board of a foreign oil company, Ms. Harris said, \u201cProbably not.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, Democrats have insisted that the conduct of the Bidens is not at issue as the House moves forward with an inquiry into President Trump\u2019s request for Ukraine to investigate the elder Biden\u2019s involvement in stopping a Ukrainian prosecutor\u2019s investigation.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no evidence that the vice president did something wrong here,\u201d Ms. Klobuchar said. \u201cAnd so what really matters is the president was repeatedly trying to get dirt on a political opponent. That is the issue here.\u201d\n\nJoe Biden is the frontrunner for the 2020 Democratic presidential primary nomination.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
