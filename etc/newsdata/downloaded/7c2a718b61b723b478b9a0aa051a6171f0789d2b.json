In it she articulated the discomfort I and many other adults have felt about all of the adoration that swirls around her. \u201cThis is all wrong,\u201d Thunberg said, seeming to bite back tears. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t be up here. I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean. Yet you all come to us young people for hope. How dare you! You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words.\u201d\n\nIndeed how dare adults hold up a child as inspiration for how to confront inaction on climate change (or for that matter gun violence) when that is their\u2014our\u2014job? How dare they venerate her with \u201cYas, little queen!\u201d and props for \u201cschooling the adults\u201d when her very existence as a young leader is a sign that the adults have failed at the basic duty of protecting the children of their society? Yes, Thunberg is an exceptional activist, but she shouldn\u2019t have to be. She and other children should not have to rise up, march in the streets, and assume the responsibility of fighting for their lives.\n\nPerhaps the only thing worse than grown men and women declaring that they want to be Greta when they grow up is the impulse by some adults to fire back at her as if she were their equal. President Trump\u2014lest we forget, a father of five\u2014chose to troll Thunberg on Twitter in another banner moment, as noted by journalist Jennifer Mendelsohn, for the first lady\u2019s Be Best campaign.\n\nBecause bashing children is her brand, Fox News host Laura Ingraham\u2014whose greatest hits include mocking Parkland survivor David Hogg for his college rejections (and losing advertisers over it)\u2014likened Thunberg to Children of the Corn on her show on Monday night. This drew the ire of, one, anyone with a conscience and, two, Ingraham\u2019s own brother, who condemned her comments on Twitter.\n\nBut naturally, that wasn\u2019t the only time Thunberg was lambasted on Fox News. In yet another instance of adults attacking a child for making the outrageous request of a safe planet to live upon, Michael Knowles (a conservative pundit whose radio show includes a recent episode titled \u201cThey\u2019re Turning the Frickin\u2019 Penguins Gay\u201d) called Thunberg, who was diagnosed with Asperger\u2019s syndrome, \u201ca mentally ill Swedish child.\u201d The first words from progressive pundit Christopher Hahn\u2019s mouth were borrowed from Thunberg: \u201cHow dare you.\u201d\n\nFox News saw fit to issue an apology\u2014which should be noteworthy in itself\u2014saying in a statement: \u201cThe comment made by Michael Knowles who was a guest on The Story tonight was disgraceful\u2014we apologize to Greta Thunberg and to our viewers.\u201d But of course, for better or worse, the most apt response came from Thunberg herself:\n\nOriginally Appeared on Vogue\n\n", "description": "Thunberg is an incredible activist, but she shouldn\u2019t have to be.
