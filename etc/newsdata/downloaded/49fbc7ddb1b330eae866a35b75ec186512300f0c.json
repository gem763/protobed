Of those 26 accomplishments, the Post chose to publish just four, which it buried under 11 paragraphs of editorialized critique.\"\n\nTED CRUZ BLASTS NEW YORK TIMES: 'PROPAGANDA OUTLET BY LIBERALS, FOR LIBERALS'\n\nThe Post, however, doesn\u2019t agree with Grisham and Gidley\u2019s op-ed.\n\n\u201cOur story prominently noted the White House\u2019s list of accomplishments and quoted a White House spokesman at length,\" a Washington Post spokesperson told Fox News. \"It also reported the views of Republicans, both on the record and on background, some of whom are part of the administration and some who watch its performance from a distance. Readers can judge for themselves whether our account fairly represented a variety of perspectives on the president\u2019s summer.\"\n\nThe op-ed received some backlash from critics who pointed out that several of the accomplishments listed by Grisham and Gidley were covered by the paper, but it appears the White House staffers were complaining only about Rucker and Parker\u2019s piece, specifically.\n\n\u201cMedia bias comes in two forms. It plays a role in deciding what news is, and is not, covered, and also in deciding how that news is covered,\u201d Grisham and Gidley wrote. \u201cIn this instance, the Post's 'reporters' are guilty of both. It is obvious they had their own predetermined, prewritten narrative, and they simply discarded information that could have challenged that.\u201d\n\nThe White House communications gurus then said the decision was \u201cnot only a disservice to readers\u201d but also \u201can offensive, egregious affront to true news journalism.\u201d\n\nGrisham and Gidley then listed a variety of Trump\u2019s recent accomplishments, including entering the DMZ into North Korea and a trade deal with Japan.\n\n\u201cTo be clear, in a \u2018news\u2019 article about Trump\u2019s summer accomplishments, the Post not only chose to ignore, but refused to cite 84% of the president\u2019s actual summer accomplishments,\u201d Grisham and Gidley wrote. \u201cRespectable, reputable, responsible news reporters would have listed those, gathered opinions from sources with diverse perspectives, and presented all of this information to their readers so they could develop their own opinions.\u201d\n\nGrisham and Gidley added that the Post \u201cwasn\u2019t alone this summer\u201d and mocked The New York Times executive editor Dean Baquet for recently telling staffers to pivot from Russian collusion to a \u201cmore head-on story about the president\u2019s character.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cNo wonder the national media\u2019s popularity sits somewhere between smallpox and the plague,\u201d Grisham and Gidley wrote. \u201cAmericans deserve to know that Trump has been hard at work this summer.\u201d", "description": "White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham and principal deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley co-wrote a scathing op-ed that slams The Washington Post as \u201can offensive, egregious affront to true news journalism\u201d but the paper wants readers to\u00a0judge for themselves.", "authors": ["Brian Flood", "Brian Flood Covers The Media For Fox News.
