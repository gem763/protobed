It also said it will leverage existing investments for a faster introduction of 5G services.\n\nMinister of Communications and Multimedia Gobind Singh Deo last week said Malaysia will start a nationwide demonstration of 5G projects this month, indicating the country was on track to become one of the first in Asia to launch the technology.\n\nMaxis and Huawei in February signed a memorandum of understanding to cooperate in 5G trials.\n\nShares in Maxis - Malaysia\u2019s first telecom group to launch 4G services - rose as much as 1.5% in early trade on Friday.\n\nHuawei also has preliminary 5G agreements with Maxis rivals such as Axiata Group Bhd\u2019s Celcom.\n\nHuawei, the world\u2019s largest telecoms equipment maker, was put on a U.S. blacklist in May after Washington said its equipment could be used for spying, which the company denies.\n\nThe U.S. government has been lobbying other countries to turn against Huawei. Malaysia, however, has said it is not concerned about the spying allegations and is focusing instead on the relative affordability of Huawei products.", "description": "Malaysia's Maxis Bhd said it has signed an agreement with China's Huawei Technologies Co Ltd to launch a fifth-generation (5G) telecommunications network in the Southeast Asian nation when the technology becomes available.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191004&t=2&i=1436865236&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9304H", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
