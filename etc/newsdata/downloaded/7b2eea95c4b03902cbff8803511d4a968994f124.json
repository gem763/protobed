As such, the Heritage Council's approval was not required for the rest of the development, other than the site and curtilage of the Old Health Department Building.\n\nThe Court of Appeal ordered that Mulpha pay Stamford's costs for the proceedings in both courts, estimated to be more than A$320,000 (S$298,660).
