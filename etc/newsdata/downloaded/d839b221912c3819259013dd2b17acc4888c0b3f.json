The UK's House of Lords is due to debate a motion which could potentially grant UK citizenship to residents in the former colony\n\nProtesters hold British flags during a rally calling for support from the UK, which ruled Hong Kong from 1842 to 1997. They sang 'God Save the Queen,' then formed a line in front of the consulate and along nearby streets, waving Union Jack flags\n\nPeople born in Hong Kong before July 1997, when China took back control of the city, were eligible for British National Overseas passports, which don't provide British citizenship.\n\nUK ruled Hong Kong for more than 150 years after China's imperial Qing Dynasty gave the Hong Kong Island to Britain in 1842 to end a war between the two.\n\nProtesters at yesterday's event said they were neither separatists nor wanted to abandon Hong Kong. But they said they were unhappy with how the city had changed since Britain ceded power to Beijing.\n\nMore than 170 Parliamentarians will urge the UK government to back the protests in the former colony and potentially provide citizenship for its residents should the situation deteriorate.\n\nThe issue is due to be raised in the House of Lords this afternoon.\n\nPeers will be asked to debate a motion on the 'recent political unrest in Hong Kong and calls to offer residents of Hong Kong citizenship in another country'.\n\nThe debate has been asked for by crossbench peer Lord Alton of Liverpool but it does not propose taking any binding action and there is unlikely to be any kind of formal vote.\n\nA protester holds a placard reading 'SOS' during a demonstration outside the British Consulate on Wednesday night.

He urged the UK Government to take action to show its support.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Patterson said: 'An easy way to do this is to extend citizenship rights to Hong Kongers. Today's debate is therefore timely and important.\n\n'Boris Johnson has said that he will stand with the people of Hong Kong \"every inch of the way\". Now is the time for him to prove it.'\n\nChris Whitehouse, the political advisor to non-governmental organisation 'Stand With Hong Kong', said: 'The history of the former colony means that the UK Government has an enduring duty of care to all Hong Kongers, to defend their freedom and human rights from the repressive and tyrannical Chinese regime.'\n\nThe group gained widespread attention after Daryl Morey, the general manager of NBA team Houston Rockets, tweeted their logo to show his support of its cause.\n\nProtesters holding Union Jack flags gather behind the illuminated 'Free HK' sign during a rally calling for support from the UK\n\nA protester wears a Guy Fawkes mask and holds a Hong Kong colonial-era flag during the demonstration in Hong Kong\n\nProtesters at the event said they were neither separatists nor wanted to abandon Hong Kong.

Mass rallies have taken place every weekend since June 9\n\nBeijing has given its support to Hong Kong leaders, calling the demonstrators 'rioters' and condemning the violence\n\nBut the proposals sparked widespread fears that residents would be at risk of being sent to mainland China's Communist Party-controlled courts.\n\nLam was forced to back down and said last month she would drop the bill.\n\nBeijing is reportedly drawing up a plan to remove the city's beleaguered leader after nearly five months of pro-democracy unrest.\n\nThe pro-Beijing leader has faced sustained criticism from protesters in the semi-autonomous city.\n\nSo far, the Chinese central government has given its support to her and the Hong Kong police, calling the demonstrators 'rioters' and condemning the violence.\n\nBeijing could replace Lam with an interim chief executive by March given the situation in Hong Kong eases, sources told Financial Times.\n\nChina's foreign ministry said the report was a political rumour with ulterior motives.\n\nAnti-riot police disperse protesters during a demonstration against a newly imposed law banning face masks on October 6\n\nPro-democracy protesters are arrested by police during a clash at a demonstration in Wan Chai district on October 6\n\nProtestors set fire on the street in Causeway Bay during a demonstration against a ban on face masks in public on October 6\n\nHong Kong has been rocked by a series of anti-government protests for nearly four months.\n\nThe demonstrations were initially sparked by a proposed law that would allow some criminal suspects to be sent to the mainland China to stand trial.\n\nHong Kong is ruled under the 'one country, two system' policy and has different legal and governing systems to mainland China.\n\nThe principle was agreed upon by China and the UK before the former British colony reverted to Chinese rule 22 years ago.\n\nHowever, many residents in the semi-autonomous city feel that their freedoms are eroding due to the tight political grip of Beijing.\n\nThe extradition bill was suspended indefinitely by the government in June, but the rallies have morphed into a wider pro-democracy movement that calls for government reforms and universal suffrage, among others.\n\nThousands of people have taken to the street to voice their anger at police and the government after the shooting.

It has also called some activists 'rioters' and 'political terrorists'.\n\nOn October 4, Lam invoked colonial-era emergency powers to ban protesters from wearing masks in public in a bid to quell the unrest.\n\nThe move further enraged protesters and sparked even more violence.\n\nTwo teenagers, aged 14 and 18, have been shot by police with live rounds this month - the first such shootings in the unrest since it began nearly five months ago.", "description": "Hong Kong protesters rallied ahead of a debate in the UK's House of Lords on whether to offer UK citizenship to residents in the former colony.
