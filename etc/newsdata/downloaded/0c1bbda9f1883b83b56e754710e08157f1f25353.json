Literally.\n\nHis office-rental giant WeWork was months away from being valued at $47 billion. Revenue was doubling annually. And Mr. Neumann was zipping across the Atlantic Ocean in a Gulfstream G650 private jet with friends last summer, smoking marijuana.\n\nAfter the group landed in Israel and left the plane, the flight crew found a sizable chunk of the drug stuffed in a cereal box for the return flight, according to people familiar with the incident. The jet\u2019s owner, upset and fearing repercussions of trans-border marijuana transport, recalled the plane, leaving Mr. Neumann to find his own way back to New York, these people said.\n\nSince Mr. Neumann co-founded WeWork\u2014recently renamed We Co.\u2014with Miguel McKelvey nine years ago, he has led with unusual exuberance and excess. His combination of entrepreneurial vision, personal charisma and brash risk-taking helped the company surpass $2 billion in annual revenue, and made it the country\u2019s most valuable startup.\n\nNow many of the same qualities that helped fuel his company\u2019s breakneck growth in the private market are piling up as potential liabilities as the company prepares to go public\u2014helmed by a CEO who looks little like a typical public-company chief.\n\nMr. Neumann muses about the implausible: becoming leader of the world, living forever, amassing more than $1 trillion in wealth. Partying has long been a feature of his work life, heavy on the tequila.\n\nPublic investors are increasingly skeptical of the formula that has worked for Mr. Neumann so far: his pitch that We is far more than a real-estate company. With its rapid growth and use of technology, he argued, the company deserves rich valuations normally reserved for tech companies.\n\nInstead, many potential investors now see a fast-growing office subleasing company with losses of more than $1.6 billion last year.\n\nMr. Neumann, center, at the opening bell ceremony at Nasdaq in New York in January 2018.

It is now expecting an IPO valuation as low as a third of the $47 billion sticker price it garnered in a January funding round\u2014a drop without recent precedent. This week, We postponed the offering until October at the earliest.\n\nWall Street and Silicon Valley investors have been dismayed by the number of potential conflicts of interest disclosed in the \u201cS-1\u201d IPO prospectus, including Mr. Neumann leasing properties he owns back to the company and borrowing heavily against his stock. Even some of We\u2019s private investors said they were angered to learn that an entity Mr. Neumann controls sold the rights to the word \u201cWe\u201d to the company for almost $6 million\u2014before public pressure led him to unwind the deal.\n\nValue Drop We now expects an IPO valuation far lower than the $47 billion price it got in a January funding round. We\u2019s IPO valuation $50 billion 40 30 20 $15-20 billion valuation range We was expecting earlier this month 10 0 2013 \u201914 \u201915 \u201916 \u201917 \u201918 \u201919\n\n\u201cThis is not the way everybody behaves,\u201d said Dick Costolo, former CEO of Twitter Inc., who led the company through one of the larger tech IPOs of the past decade. \u201cThe degree of self-dealing in the S-1 is so egregious, and it comes at a time when you\u2019ve got regulators and politicians and folks across the country looking out at Silicon Valley and wondering if there\u2019s the appropriate level of self-awareness.\u201d\n\nGiven the prominence of the IPO, he added, \u201cthat is a big problem.\u201d\n\nMr. Neumann, 40, declined to comment through a spokesman, who cited rules surrounding the planned IPO. Mr. Neumann told We employees Tuesday the process had been humbling and he would learn from it, say people who heard him. We executives have previously said he is strongly devoted to the company, and many of his personal transactions were made with the company\u2019s best interests at heart.\n\nThis account is based on interviews with current and former employees, investors and friends who interacted with Mr. Neumann as he built We.\n\nFor startup investors, the 6-foot-5 Mr. Neumann has always had the qualities they crave in Silicon Valley founders, despite being based in New York. He is intensely ambitious and a masterful storyteller with a magnetic personality who can inspire and sell.\n\nMr. Neumann and WeWork co-founder Miguel McKelvey in 2015.

One was a collapsible heel on women\u2019s shoes that didn\u2019t get off the ground. Working out of his Tribeca apartment, he started Krawlers, which sought to make baby clothes with knee pads to make crawling more comfortable. The slogan, he has said: \u201cJust because they don\u2019t tell you, doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t hurt.\u201d It never gained traction.\n\nHe and Mr. McKelvey started a small co-working space on the side during the recession that followed the financial crisis and were amazed by the demand.\n\nShare Your Thoughts Is Adam Neumann the right person to lead WeWork? Join the conversation below.\n\nBy 2010, they had started WeWork, with essentially the same core business model that exists today: They lease an office long-term, renovate it to make it hip and inviting, and sublease smaller desks and offices short-term.\n\nEarly on, Mr. Neumann painted a picture of how WeWork was connecting entrepreneurs and others who in the past would have worked from home or in coffee shops; how the company would bring a new way of working to a changing world.\n\nThe founders planned for the \u201cWe\u201d brand to expand beyond office space into other categories such as housing and finance. Mr. Neumann ramped up its image as a tech company as it grew.\n\nIt introduced a mobile app for network members, meant to facilitate a \u201cphysical social network.\u201d The company emphasized its data and how it was using artificial intelligence to glean insights about buildings.\n\nMr. Neuman, right, with Rebekah Paltrow, second from left, in 2010.

He pushed for rowdy parties in the early days. He often walks barefoot around the office. In an earlier office, he blared songs by pop-star Rihanna while a trainer held a punching bag for him, and then walked around afterward while still sweaty from the exertion.\n\nLike some high-profile CEOs in tech, he hopes to live forever, according to three people who heard him say this, and has invested in life-extension startup Life Biosciences LLC.\n\nIt says its mission is \u201cto create a future where age-related decline is not a fact of life.\u201d\n\nAs WeWork grew, Mr. Neumann took on ever more investment, bringing in tens of millions of dollars from venture capitalists, then hundreds of millions from mutual funds T. Rowe Price and Fidelity Investments. Crucially, he secured full control of the company in 2014 when investor demand was high\u2014getting shares with 10 times the votes of others.\n\nA WeWork space in Tokyo.

Mr. Son, a telecom veteran who raised the world\u2019s largest tech fund in 2017, met Mr. Neumann in India in 2016 and pondered an investment.\n\nSoftBank first committed $3.1 billion in new funding in 2017. Mr. Neumann has told others that Mr. Son appreciated how he was crazy\u2014but thought that he needed to be crazier. A SoftBank spokeswoman declined to comment.\n\nMany former employees said they didn\u2019t always know how seriously to take some of Mr. Neumann\u2019s pronouncements. Early on, he would throw out seemingly random ideas, like adding a pool in the basement of the company\u2019s headquarters or starting an airline.\n\nHe told at least one person directly that his ambitions included becoming Israel\u2019s prime minister. More recently, he said that if he ran for anything, it would be president of the world, according to another person who spoke with him.\n\n\u201cThe influence and impact that we are going to have on this Earth is going to be so big,\u201d he said last year at a \u201csummer camp\u201d southeast of London, where the company\u2019s staff were all flown for a music festival-like event. One day, he proposed, the company could \u201csolve the problem of children without parents,\u201d and from there go onto other causes such as eradicating world hunger.\n\nAlcohol flowed in great quantities; bartenders handed out free ros\u00e9 by the bottle. Employees from around the globe posed for photos with the CEO. Some seminars had a spiritual component, including one with holistic health expert Deepak Chopra, who advocates regular meditation and yoga.\n\nMr. Neumann has told several people over the past two years that a personal goal is to become the world\u2019s first trillionaire.\n\nHe relishes trips in private jets. Last year, We bought one for more than $60 million, people familiar with the sale said. Mr. Neumann has borrowed more than $740 million against his stock and has sold multiple hundred million dollars of shares, people familiar with those sales say, eliciting widespread criticism from analysts and Silicon Valley investors. These share sales weren\u2019t disclosed in the IPO prospectus.\n\nMr. Neumann, center, and Mr. McKelvey in 2016.

Soon after, the company launched a buyback program offering to purchase employees\u2019 shares too. But the company gave employees a different arrangement, giving them a payout per share worth substantially less than what Mr. Neumann was paid, people familiar with the sale said. Mr. Neumann\u2019s sale wasn\u2019t publicized within the company.\n\nWe executives have said the buyback price couldn\u2019t be higher for tax reasons. More recent stock sales have been more equitable.\n\nA recent change to the company\u2019s corporate structure puts Mr. Neumann and a group of executives in a position to have a lower tax rate on some of their stock compensation than the rest of the employees in the company. We said the new structure was created in part to make it easier to expand into new businesses beyond co-working, according to IPO filings.\n\nIn private, Mr. Neumann often talks about the company\u2019s valuation, according to people involved with the conversations. He has insisted that We\u2019s valuation will eventually be many times what it was earlier this year, when it reached $47 billion, the people said.\n\nFor Mr. Neumann and the investors, the premise has always been that the market would look at We as more than real estate. The high valuation\u2014twice that of United Airlines Holdings Inc. \u2014has enabled the company to continue to raise money to fund new desks and offices and keep growing, even as losses persisted.\n\nHe has created a distinct culture in his mold. T-shirts and signs sport slogans such as \u201chustle harder\u201d and \u201cThank God it\u2019s Monday.\u201d Employees are often big company boosters, creating a work-hard, play-hard office, with a millennial hipster vibe.\n\nAlcohol has been a big part of the culture, particularly in We\u2019s first half-decade. Mr. Neumann has told people he likes how it brings people together, and tequila, his favorite, flows freely. Executive retreats sport numerous cases of Don Julio 1942, with a retail price of more than $110 a bottle, and pours sometimes start in the morning.\n\nA few weeks after Mr. Neumann fired 7% of the staff in 2016, he somberly addressed the issue at an evening all-hands meeting at headquarters, telling attendees the move was tough but necessary to cut costs, and the company would be better because of it.\n\nThen employees carrying trays of plastic shot glasses filled with tequila came into the room, followed by toasts and drinks.\n\nSoon after, Darryl McDaniels of hip-hop group Run-DMC entered the room, embraced Mr. Neumann and played a set for the staff. Workers danced to the 1980s hit \u201cIt\u2019s Tricky\u201d as the tequila trays made more rounds; some others, still focused on the firings, say they were stunned and confused.\n\nMr. Neumann with a group including G-Eazy, Ashton Kutcher and Guy Oseary backstage during the Nashville Creator Awards hosted by WeWork in 2018.

As with the Israel trip, multiple people who have been on planes with him say he often smokes while airborne.\n\nMuch of this culture has been pared back as the company has matured. The summer camp was canceled this year.\n\nMr. Neumann has mellowed some too, friends say. He sometimes stays away from alcohol for weeks or months at a time, and raucous parties are less frequent. His wife, Rebekah Neumann, has helped pare back the partying, former executives say.\n\nMs. Neumann, a first cousin of actress and wellness guru Gwyneth Paltrow, has said she and Mr. Neumann clicked when they first met, when Mr. Neumann was broke and struggling to make a business.\n\n\u201cIt felt like time stopped,\u201d she told a podcast interviewer last year. \u201cI just knew he was the man that was, hopefully, going to help save the world.\u201d\n\nFormer employees who worked with her say she pushes to infuse spiritualism in We\u2014which has a mission statement to \u201celevate the world\u2019s consciousness\u201d\u2014and enjoys broad autonomy at the company. She is the chief brand officer and head of WeGrow\u2014the private company\u2019s preschool and elementary school that costs up to $42,000 a year and is open to anyone. She is an important counsel for Mr. Neumann, and he has told staff they often make decisions together.\n\nMr. Neumann and his wife, Rebekah Neumann, in 2018. Photo: Evan Agostini/Invision/Associated Press\n\nThe two split time between some of their many homes\u2014they have at least five\u2014including a 60-acre Tudor-style estate north of New York City. They have told staff they started WeGrow after they were dissatisfied with schooling options for their five children.\n\nThe two have committed giving $1 billion to charity over the next decade.\n\nMs. Neumann had been slated to play a large role in choosing Mr. Neumann\u2019s successor if he were ever incapacitated, but was recently removed from that position amid pushback from investors.\n\nBoth Neumanns could be impulsive at times, former executives say. Ms. Neumann has ordered multiple employees fired after meeting them for just minutes, telling staff she didn\u2019t like their energy. She and Mr. Neumann have sent maintenance and IT staff to their homes to fix various items.\n\nWhen Mr. Neumann announced in July 2018 via video call from Israel that the company was banning meat, executives in New York were caught off guard. With little explanation from Mr. Neumann, a group huddled to determine a rationale\u2014they settled on sustainability\u2014and the mechanics of what would be banned and how.\n\nThey determined employees couldn\u2019t expense meals with meat, but they could eat it in company offices, so long as the company didn\u2019t pay. Former employees say they have since seen Mr. Neumann eat meat.\n\nHe previously has instructed staff to fire 20% of employees a year, bemoaning the number of \u201cB\u201d players hired amid rapid growth. Managers were unable to hit the target even when they included attrition.\n\nStill, former executives believe his outlandish targets for items such as reducing construction costs have forced better results than more realistic goals\u2014and are a driver of the company\u2019s continued growth.\n\nThat growth has remained remarkably consistent, roughly doubling every year for most of We\u2019s history, and remains the main selling point to investors.\n\n\u201cThis guy is pushing hard, but he\u2019s all in,\u201d said John Caddedu, managing director at early We investor DAG Ventures. Building something as big as We, he said, \u201crequires extraordinary devotion and focus and will and a lot of the things that throw some people off.\u201d\n\nMr. Neumann had been expecting the revenue growth rate would also be well received by the public markets. Companies such as Netflix Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. were growing at slower rates nearly a decade in, though they were losing far less money.\n\nInstead, after the IPO prospectus was released in mid-August, the company became the butt of jokes in Silicon Valley and among Wall Street crowds. Analysts and competitors critiqued its lack of detail around the economics of its offices. Corporate governance proponents were aghast at the long list of potential conflicts. Some observers noted the irony of personally profiting off the trademark for the word \u201cwe.\u201d\n\nMr. Neumann at his desk in New York in 2014. Photo: Cassandra Giraldo for The Wall Street Journal\n\nYears leading a private company left Mr. Neumann unprepared for the negative reaction, people familiar with the IPO discussions have said. Every time he raised money\u2014often at in-person meetings where check-writers could see Mr. Neumann\u2019s charm\u2014the valuation went up, money rolled in, and the business expanded.\n\nSome investors said when they raised concerns about Mr. Neumann\u2019s self-dealings, he brushed the issues aside. Despite We\u2019s growing size, its losses have been increasing at the same rate as revenue, creating a constant need for fresh investments. That is contrary to earlier projections from Mr. Neumann, who said the company wouldn\u2019t need more money.\n\nMeanwhile, numerous other business lines, including a residential arm, a gym and an office design and management arm, have all been scaled back or failed to deliver the high profit margins once expected, people familiar with the businesses said.\n\nIn a videoconference with the whole company Tuesday, Mr. Neumann, dressed uncharacteristically in a gray suit and a white button-down shirt, told the staff it has \u201cplayed the private market game to perfection,\u201d listeners said.\n\nAs for the public markets, he said, the company was still learning the rules of the game.\n\n\u2014Maureen Farrell contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Eliot Brown at eliot.brown@wsj.com", "description": "His entrepreneurial vision and risk-taking, plus tequila and marijuana, helped fuel We Co.\u2019s breakneck growth.
