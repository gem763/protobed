And Jo Cox had been murdered by a far right nationalist called Thomas Mair, at the height of the EU referendum campaign. At his trial, he called her a \u201ccollaborator\u201d and a \u201ctraitor\u201d to white people.\n\nThe day before her death, her children and her husband had travelled up the Thames by speedboat, waving an \u201cIn\u201d banner in the face of Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit flotilla.\n\nWhether her death was directly caused by the referendum is unknowable. But it is a fact that Thomas Mair was radicalised by far right groups online, like Britain First, for whom the EU referendum boosted their profile, and swelled their numbers like never before.\n\nAnd here was the prime minister, recalled to parliament to give account for his actions having been declared unlawful by the Supreme Court, having the unimaginable temerity to imagine the way to atone for Jo Cox\u2019s murder would be in delivering the outcome she campaigned to prevent.\n\nThere were gasps in the chamber. They are words that will surely haunt him forever.\n\nTwo hours earlier, the prime minister's statement had got off to a predictably abysmal start.\n\nFour weeks ago, Boris Johnson announced he would be proroguing parliament. He called the TV cameras into Downing Street and told them it had absolutely nothing at all to do with Brexit. It was to allow for a Queen\u2019s Speech, so he could get on with his \u201cexciting domestic agenda\u201d, he said, not bothering to conceal how hilarious he found it all.\n\nIt was a lie so crass it is a wonder it was ever meant to be believed by a single soul.\n\nAnd lo, on Tuesday, the Supreme Court declared, unanimously, that it could not possibly be true.\n\nIt declared his prorogation to be unlawful and sent the prime minister back to the House of Commons.\n\nHe had been compelled to give a statement on the Supreme Court\u2019s verdict. It began like this.\n\nRead more\n\n\u201cWith your permission, Mr Speaker, I shall make a statement on yesterday\u2019s Supreme Court verdict and the way forward for this paralysed Parliament.\n\n\u201cThree years ago, more people voted to leave the European Union than have ever voted for any party or proposition in our history.\u201d\n\nHe spoke for six minutes on the subject of Brexit, before the Supreme Court judgement was even mentioned.\n\n\u201cI think the Court was wrong to pronounce on what is essentially a political question at a time of great national controversy,\u201d he said.\n\nFour weeks ago, prorogation had had nothing to do with Brexit. He had been found to have not been telling the truth, and now here he was, disagreeing with the Supreme Court\u2019s verdict, while speaking for six straight minutes about why it had absolutely everything to do with Brexit.\n\nIt was such an absurd lie that was almost an honesty to it. It was such crushingly obvious lies the only logical explanation is that this was the prime minister actually coming clean. If that was his intention, and no other explanations make sense, one feels someone should explain that, in this age of short attention spans and viral news clips, the best way to have got his honest message across would have been to have just stamped the word \u2018LIAR\u2019 across his forehead.", "description": "\u201cThe best way to honour the memory of Jo Cox, would be, I think, to get Brexit done.\u201dThose words left the prime minister\u2019s lips in the House of Commons at just gone 8.30pm, on the day it had been recalled to atone for his dishonesty.", "authors": ["Tom Peck"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/..f0i5ZwerdB7KKUS_gdQQ--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/d8d1298a307499fc0d6e1ded2064977c", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
