Invokes Insane \u2018CrowdStrike Server\u2019 Conspiracy to Justify Trump\u2019s Ukraine Call", "language": "en", "text": "Appearing Friday morning on CNN, Rep. Michael Waltz (R-FL) invoked a long-debunked conspiracy theory at the center of the Ukraine scandal and the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry, defending the president\u2019s now-infamous July call to the Ukrainian president as simply trying to get to the bottom of the \u201cCrowdStrike server.\u201d\n\nWith polls showing a majority of Americans support impeachment following allegations that Trump pressured Ukraine to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, CNN host Jim Sciutto asked Waltz whether a U.S. president should seek election assistance from a foreign country.\n\n\u201cLook, I am not comfortable if there is a clear-cut quid pro quo, then, yeah that makes me very uncomfortable and we should take a hard look at that,\u201d Waltz replied before claiming the call transcript does not show that.\n\nWaltz went on to call for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to immediately hold an \u201cup or down\u201d vote on impeachment, saying if Trump\u2019s actions are impeachable then they shouldn\u2019t mind voting on it now. This then prompted him to address Trump publicly urging China to also look into Biden before taking a conspiratorial detour.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like asking China, who is an adversary, let me be clear there,\u201d Waltz declared. \u201cBut I do think you can interpret that, and I do, as looking into corruption and looking backwards at 2016 at the CrowdStrike server.\u201d\n\nSciutto, meanwhile, did not push back on or address Waltz\u2019s claims.\n\nThe Florida lawmaker was referencing the insane conspiracy that claims the Russian government wasn\u2019t responsible for hacking the DNC server and John Podesta\u2019s emails during the 2016 election. Instead, the theory goes, CrowdStrike\u2014which investigated the breach in 2016\u2014framed Russia because its co-founder is Ukrainian. (He\u2019s not, by the way.) Proponents of the theory also allege that the DNC server is actually somewhere in Ukraine, with Trumpworld believing this is where Hillary Clinton\u2019s missing emails can also be found.\n\nBesides bringing up Biden during his call with the Ukrainian president, Trump, according to the memo of the call, also said, \u201cI would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say CrowdStrike. I guess you have one of your wealthy people. The server, they say Ukraine has it.\u201d\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGot a tip?
