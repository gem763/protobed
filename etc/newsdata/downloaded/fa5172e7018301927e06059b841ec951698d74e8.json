Click on the image to see the full list of coins supported by Ledger.\n\nDespite the variety of supported crypto assets, the main Ledger Nano S drawback is its limited internal memory. It lets you install only up 3-5 different cryptocurrency wallets (depending on the size of the wallet apps). It makes for a great hardware wallet if you want to store a few distinct types of coins or tokens (for example, BTC and ETH). However, it is an ideal solution for storing your entire altcoin portfolio.\n\nThere is a workaround for this issue, though. You can install wallet apps and set up wallets for storing coins and then uninstall them from the Ledger Nano S. Although that sounds counterintuitive, your private keys will remain in the device.\n\nRemoving apps after storing coins will help you to save extra space. However, it also means you will have to keep on reinstalling apps whenever you need to access certain wallets, which adds excess friction to the process. Besides, most people are not comfortable deleting their wallet apps with digital holdings. Another device by Ledger, Ledger Nano X, solves this issue entirely and allows you to keep as many cryptocurrencies as you like.\n\nAfter reviewing Ledger Nano S multi-currency support, it becomes clear that Ledger Nano S is an ideal device for crypto beginners and investors with a limited variety of digital coins. However, it is not a perfect one-stop-shop solution for crypto enthusiasts with a diverse portfolio.\n\nNote that limited internal space has its advantages too. It makes Ledger Nano S more secure, as well as a cheaper cold storage solution for investors who want to alleviate the risk of theft by keeping digital assets in multiple cold wallets and/or locations.\n\nLedger Nano S Security Features Review\n\nA cryptocurrency hardware wallet is like your bank deposit box where you keep your most precious possessions. You cannot leave it unprotected, and the best way to do it is by employing the highest grade encryption.\n\nThe devices by Ledger have earned consumers trust and reputation for security. Even if your computer experiences a security breach, Ledger Nano S will keep your digital assets save. It uses two layers of protection - ST31H320 (protection) and STM32F042 (OS) chips that store your private keys and sign transactions as separate pieces of hardware.\n\nBesides, Nano Ledger S users can protect their coins by setting up a PIN code to unlock the device, as well as a passphrase used to grant access to the user wallets.\n\nEven today, there has been no reported case of Nano Ledger S device being hacked remotely. However, this makes it critical to keep your seed phrase offline and hidden so that no one has access to it. Do not record or store it online, as it may compromise your device\u2019s security. The most secure way to save your seed phrase is by using a dedicated robust mechanism like CryptoTag.\n\nEven if your hardware device gets broken or lost, you can quickly recover it using its seed phrase. See the video below for instructions on how to restore your device from the seed phrase.\n\nLedger Nano S Review: Device Design\n\nThe device itself comes with a handy and easy to use interface. There is a screen and two navigation buttons on top of the device. Together, they all work to help you to access the device\u2019s menu, enter a pin code, select apps, and input recovery phrases. Although two buttons make it slightly tedious to enter PIN\u2019s and seed phrases, Ledger OS guides you through the setup of your device. All you need to do is follow on-screen and Ledger Live (desktop app for Ledger devices) messages.\n\nIt\u2019s also easy to connect your Ledger Nano S to the computer by using the provided micro-USB cable. Nevertheless, the tiny screen does get in the way sometimes, especially when you need to confirm long receiver addresses when making transactions. However, it\u2019s a minor inconvenience - it does get easier once you get used to it. It is what makes Ledger Nano S reliable and secure - it\u2019s simple, has limited internal space capacity and screen, but these limits also leave no room for error for the hackers to steal your funds, which is why Ledger Nano S is admired for its design and security.\n\nHardware Wallet Price Comparison\n\nUnless you\u2019re a cybersecurity guru, having a secure cold or an encrypted hardware wallet is a must in your crypto game plan. As the brief history of the industry has already shown multiple times, you cannot trust third-party service providers. They are not banks, so when things go south, you would be naive to expect a reimbursement.\n\nAs of 2019, Ledger Nano S cryptocurrency wallet is by far the most affordable option in the market and is one of the most recommended hardware wallets out there. Here is how the most popular hardware wallets compare with each other:\n\nDevice Price Release Date Supported Cryptocurrencies Ledger Nano S $59 2016 1100+ Ledger Nano X $119 2019 1100+ Trezor One $78 2014 1000+ Trezor Model T $170 2018 1000+ KeepKey $79 2015 40\n\nLedger Nano S Review: Conclusion\n\nAs we\u2019ve learned by reviewing Ledger Nano S hardware wallet, simple is the new secure.

Use the provided micro-USB cable that came with it in a box for a secure connection. Set up a PIN code. The device\u2019s screen will light up and will ask you to if you want to configure it as a new device. Use the top buttons to confirm that, and set up a 4-7 digits PIN code. Every time you select a number, confirm it by pressing both top buttons at once. Memorize the code, as you will need to enter it every time you\u2019ll need to use the device. Record your recovery (seed) phrase. Next, Ledger Nano S will show you a series of 24 words. Record them in a secure, offline place. You can use the provided recovery phrase sheets that came with the device in the box. Make sure that every word is recorded correctly. Be careful, because if you lose your recovery seed, there will not be any other way to recover your funds. Use a device like Cryptotag for the most optimal recovery seed. Confirm your seed. Once you are done writing your seed, the device will ask you to confirm it by asking for two random words from your seed phrase. For instance, it may ask you to confirm the word no. 12 from the sequence. Use the top buttons to navigate towards the 12th word from your recovery phrase and confirm it. Install Ledger Live App on your computer. Ledger Live is a companion app to your hardware wallet. Download it directly from the Ledger\u2019s website.
