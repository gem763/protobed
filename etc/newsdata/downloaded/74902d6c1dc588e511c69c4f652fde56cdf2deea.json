Evacuation orders have been issued for the town of Geyserville, 75 miles north of San Francisco. So far, more than 2,000 people have had to leave their homes.\n\nPowerful winds of up to 76 mph have been recorded in that area, according to the National Weather Service. The combination of these winds with dry, hot weather conditions has enabled the flames to spread quickly.\n\nThat weather is expected to continue through Monday morning, according to the National Weather Service. Wind gusts of 60 mph are projected, with some areas seeing gusts as powerful as 80 mph.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency in both Sonoma and Los Angeles Counties, where the Tick Fire has forced the evacuation of about 40,000 people.\n\nkincade fire sonoma county satellite image 24oct2019 More\n\nSatellite image \u00a92019 Maxar Technologies\n\nUtility company Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) told regulators on Thursday that the Kincade Fire may have been caused by a broken jumper cable on one of the company's transmission towers, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. Sparking PG&E wires were also found to have started last year's record-breaking Camp Fire, which razed more than 18,800 structures and killed 86 people in November.\n\nPG&E has announced plans to cut power to 850,000 customers on Saturday due to the wind warnings, Bloomberg reported. That would be the largest intentional outage in California history.\n\n\"We should not have to be here. Years and years of greed, years and years of mismanagement, particularly with the largest investor-owned utility in the state of California, PG&E,\" Newsom said in a Friday press conference, adding, \"We will do everything in our power to restructure PG&E so it is a completely different entity when they get out of bankruptcy by June 30th of next year. We will hold them accountable for the business interruption and costs associated with these blackouts.\"\n\nThe fire may have started at one of PG&E's transmission towers\n\nKincaid Fire More\n\nNoah Berger/AP\n\nIn a preliminary report, PG&E said it learned of the issue with its broken cable at 9:20 p.m. local time on Wednesday, when it responded to a problem with a 230,000-volt line that forced a power outage, according to NBC Bay Area. When PG&E crews arrived at the transmission tower, they found that Cal Fire had taped off an area at the tower's base. Cal Fire personnel pointed out the broken jumper cable, NBC reported.", "description": "A wildfire ignited late Wednesday night in Sonoma County, California.
