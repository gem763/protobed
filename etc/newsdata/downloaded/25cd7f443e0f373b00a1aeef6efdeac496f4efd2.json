And while he is one of almost two dozen potential witnesses on investigators\u2019 wish list, his testimony could prove to be the most damaging depending on where he comes down on the ideological spectrum.\n\nBolton is a staunch conservative who views the president\u2019s powers as expansive and has defended preemptive military strikes. But it\u2019s unclear whether any testimony from him would defend Trump\u2019s actions as an extension of executive powers or if he would paint those actions as an abuse of power that\u2019s damaging to the rule of law and order.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not a friendly guy, but he does know right from wrong,\u201d one former colleague said of Bolton. \u201cHe\u2019s been around the national security scene for a long time. He knows what\u2019s appropriate and what isn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nBolton has so far made known he\u2019s no personal friend of the president. His last public statement, posted on Twitter, was a swift rebuke of Trump\u2019s characterization that he had \u201cfired\u201d Bolton.\n\n\u201cI offered to resign last night,\u201d Bolton tweeted, \u201cand President Trump said, \u2018Let's talk about it tomorrow.\u2019\u2019\u201d\n\nShortly after leaving the White House, Bolton was described as disparaging the president at a private event in New York. Attendees recalled Bolton did not have \u201canything positive to say about Trump,\u201d and criticized the president\u2019s policy on Iran, North Korea and Afghanistan.\n\nHe also called Trump\u2019s plan to invite the Taliban to Camp David on the 9/11 anniversary \u201cdisrespectful.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIf he testifies, lawmakers are likely to ask Bolton if he has evidence, or reason to believe, the president acted in political self-interest at the expense of national security in pressuring Ukraine to open investigations into Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenKey witness in impeachment investigation asks federal judge to rule on testifying Pompeo voices support for work of diplomat criticized by Trump Biden, Sanders defend themselves over questions of age MORE, his son Hunter Biden, their involvement with the energy company Burisma Holdings and alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections.\n\nTrump has maintained that raising those issues were part of a U.S. policy focused on weeding out corruption in Ukraine. But testimony in the impeachment inquiry paints a starkly different picture.\n\nChief of Mission to Ukraine William Taylor, who has provided some of the most detailed testimony in the probe, described key moments between many of the major players embroiled in the controversy and centered on the question of the decision to delay military assistance to Ukraine for the promise of going after one of Trump\u2019s political opponents.\n\nTaylor also raised the question of the involvement of Giuliani, who was allegedly directed by Trump to follow through on efforts to open investigations into the Bidens, Burisma and 2016 election interference.\n\nSondland, in his testimony, corroborated that the president had directed Giuliani to take on this mission, and investigators are working to understand the former New York City\u2019s mayor efforts to influence White House foreign policy. Two of Giuliani\u2019s associates were indicted for allegedly attempting to make political contributions on behalf of foreign governments without disclosing the source.\n\nFormer National Security Council (NSC) Director for European Affairs Fiona Hill testified that Bolton had called Giuliani a \u201chand grenade\u201d and was going to \u201cblow everything up.\u201d Taylor corroborated those statements and offered his own assessment of the danger of jeopardizing Ukraine relations, calling it \u201cfolly.\u201d\n\nOne of Bolton\u2019s descriptions, according to testimony, likened it to a \u201cdrug deal.\u201d\n\nBolton is regarded as extremely disciplined in his work ethic, having an almost photographic memory and encyclopedic knowledge of world affairs. Should he testify, he\u2019s likely to provide detailed and even colorful testimony.\n\nInvestigators will be keen to understand Bolton\u2019s motivation to direct NSC staff to alert White House lawyers after a July meeting between administration officials and Ukrainian representatives.\n\nThat meeting, described in testimony, has Sondland connecting a future Oval Office visit by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky with \u201cinvestigations\u201d \u2013 referring to the conspiracy theories surrounding the Bidens and 2016 election interference.\n\nStay away from domestic politics, Bolton told NSC staffers, directing them to the lawyers, according to testimony. The account puts further emphasis on the argument that administration officials were using their positions to pressure a foreign government to disparage a domestic political opponent.\n\nSondland, in his testimony, said no one told him he was acting inappropriately. He said he realized there was a \u201cdifference of opinion\u201d between the NSC staff and the track that he was pursuing with Perry and Volker.\n\n\u201cWe had regular communications with the NSC about Ukraine, both before and after the July meeting,\u201d Sondland testified, \u201cand neither Ambassador Bolton, Dr. Hill, nor anyone else on the NSC staff ever expressed any concerns to me about our efforts, any complaints about coordination between State and the NSC, or, most importantly, any concerns that we were acting improperly.\u201d\n\nLawmakers will also ask Bolton for more details about why military assistance to Ukraine was delayed.\n\nTaylor has testified that even though he was aware of a hold on military assistance, he was never given an appropriate reason.\n\nHouse investigators have sent out subpoenas for more witnesses, including Tim Morrison, who took over at the NSC after Hill\u2019s departure; two officials from the Office of Management and Budget, likely questioned over instructions to withhold military aid to Ukraine; and State Department officials.\n\nBolton has yet to give any media interviews since leaving the White House but has reportedly signed a deal to publish a tell-all book, though a publication date has not been announced.", "description": "One of the loudest voices emerging from House Democrats impeachment inquiry about President Trump\u2019s alleged abuse of power has come from a man who has yet to utter a word publicly about the probe: former national security adviser John Bolton.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/boltonjohn_093019getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
