TSN 0.27% lowered its earnings forecast for the current period, citing \u201cshort-term challenges\u201d that have weighed on its bottom line, including volatile commodity prices and food-safety initiatives.\n\nThe Springdale, Ark., company said a fire at a Kansas beef plant and slower-than-expected operational changes in its chicken business added to challenges in its fiscal fourth quarter.\n\nTyson cut its adjusted earnings guidance for fiscal 2019 to a range of $5.30 to $5.70 a share. Its previous projection was $5.75 to $6.10 a share. \u201cThe discrete challenges we\u2019ve encountered this quarter now lead us to believe we will fall short of our previously stated guidance,\u201d Chief Executive Noel White said in a written statement. Shares of Tyson fell 6.2% in after-hours trading Tuesday to $87.50.

He also said Tyson\u2019s portfolio is generating strong sales volumes. Tyson is pivoting its 84-year-old meatpacking company to more-profitable prepared and packaged foods in a bid to distance itself from the traditional meat business\u2019s boom-and-bust cycles. Tyson\u2019s main business is processing beef, chicken and pork. Overall record red-meat and poultry production nationwide is pushing down prices and eroding Tyson\u2019s meat-processing profit margins. Tariffs and trade barriers to U.S. meat have also dented prices, building up backlogs, as transport and labor costs continue to climb. \u2014Josh Beckerman contributed to this article.
