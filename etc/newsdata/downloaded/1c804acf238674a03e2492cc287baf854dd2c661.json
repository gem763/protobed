EVERYONE GOT TO PAY THIS YEAR SO WE CLEAR.\u201d\n\nAntonio Brown posts his displeasure with fines from #Raiders pic.twitter.com/0OMhdwFu7K \u2014 Vic Tafur (@VicTafur) September 4, 2019\n\nMayock didn\u2019t like what Brown had done which led to the exchange. \u201cRaiders\u2019 GM Mike Mayock has a strong, opinionated personality, as anyone who has watched him knows,\u201d Schefter wrote on Twitter. \u201cWR Antonio Brown is his own man. It creates a combustible combination, to say the least.\u201d\n\nThe incident could end up costing Brown much more than $54k, according to Ian Rapoport of the NFL Network.\n\n#Raiders WR Antonio Brown and GM Mike Mayock got into it earlier this week, and it got ugly. Mayock clearly frustrated with AB posting his fine letter on Instagram. And now, a suspension for conduct detrimental could mean losing $30M in guaranteed money. \u2014 Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) September 5, 2019\n\nSources corroborated that notion to Schefter and said there are some within the Raiders organization that want to use the suspension \u2014the length of which has yet to be announced \u2014 as a way to end Brown\u2019s time in Oakland and void the $30.125 million that\u2019s guaranteed in his contract.\n\nUnder the NFL\u2019s current collective bargaining agreement, a player can be suspended a maximum of four weeks for conduct detrimental to the team.\n\nRapoport also had a few more details about the altercation between Brown and Mayock. He reported the incident did not get physical, but that Brown did threaten to hit Mayock in the face following a screaming match and punted a football.\n\nMayock was likely annoyed at Brown posting the letter, as well as the behavior which led the team to fine him in the first place, including getting frost-bitten feet from a cryotherapy treatment in France and waging a battle with the NFL over the use of his outdated helmet.\n\nWe\u2019ll update this story as more news comes available.
