They argued that Trump had no legal authority to spend more than what Congress appropriated for the wall project.\n\nIn January the president asked for $5.7 billion to build \"a steel barrier for the Southwest border,\" but Congress approved only $1.375 billion. In February, Trump declared a national emergency and ordered that money for Pentagon construction projects would be used instead for the wall.\n\nFederal District Court Judge David Briones said the president's order violated a provision of the budget law approved by Congress which said \"none of the funds made available in this or any other appropriation may be used to increase\" the funding for the wall project.\n\n\"The president's proclamation is unlawful,\" Briones wrote.\n\nHe gave El Paso County and the Border Network ten days to file a proposed injunction that would give legal effect to his ruling and block any further use of military construction money for building border wall.\n\nKristy Parker, a lawyer for Project Democracy, which represented the challengers, praised the ruling and said it \"vindicates the Founders' wisdom and confirms that the president is not a king, and that he cannot override Congress's power to decide how to appropriate funds.\"\n\nThe judge's ruling does not effect a separate part of the emergency declaration, directing the Pentagon to transfer $2.5 billion in counterdrug money to the border project. The U.S. Supreme Court earlier this year declined to stop the use of that money for wall construction.\n\nThe Trump administration is sure to appeal Friday's ruling.", "description": "The president ordered that money for Pentagon construction projects would be used instead for the barrier on Mexico's border.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/4225108/1000x563_nbc-191011-trump-border-wall-mn-1520_b85df51cc0214b77fc9d79b740be492e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
