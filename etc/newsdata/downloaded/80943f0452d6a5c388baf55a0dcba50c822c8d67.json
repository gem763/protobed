McGruder Distinguished Award by Kent State\u2019s School of Journalism and Mass Communication (JMC) and the Division of Diversity, Equity for his accomplishments in media diversity. The award was named for the late Robert G. \u201cBob\u201d McGruder, the Detroit Free Press\u2019 first black executive editor.

He became the first journalist of South Asian descent to run a major daily newspaper in 2010 as the executive editor of The Oregonian and was inducted into the South Asian Journalists Association Hall of Fame in 2007.\n\n\u201cPeter is renowned as a leader who encourages reporting that reflects the diversity of American communities, and he has certainly lived up to that reputation at the USA TODAY NETWORK,\u201d said Maribel Wadsworth, president of the USA TODAY NETWORK. \u201cThe McGruder Award testifies to the significance of his work at the Free Press and throughout his career in journalism.\u201d\n\nBhatia visited Kent State today to accept the honor, which has been given for 14 years as a celebration of diversity.
