They\u2019re colluding and they\u2019re obstructing.\u201d\n\nFor the first half-hour, Trump\u2019s speech slowly moved along at the pace of a State of the Union address. He ticked through what he considered GOP accomplishments \u2014 slashing thousands of rules, including the decision Thursday to scrap the Obama-era regulation on the wetlands and tributaries that feed into the nation\u2019s largest rivers \u2014 and through tax cuts.\n\n[Administration finalizes repeal of 2015 water rule Trump called \u2018destructive and horrible\u2019]\n\nTrump became more animated later on, going off script to rant about Democrats wanting to take away plastic straws and what he called their outrageous demands for how to recycle lightbulbs.\n\n\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) speaks at a news conference during the House Republican retreat in Baltimore on Thursday. (Jose Luis Magana/AP)\n\nHe jabbed at his 2016 rival Clinton, saying she \u201cdidn\u2019t like stairs, didn\u2019t like airplanes, didn\u2019t like a lot\u201d\u2014 and would rest for weeks between stops.\n\nAt one point, Trump veered off script to take a shot at the Democrats onstage in Texas at that moment, calling Biden \u201cSleepy Joe\u201d and Sanders \u201cCrazy Bernie.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hit Pocahontas way too early,\u201d he said, referring to Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) \u201cI thought she was gone. She\u2019s emerged from the ashes and now it looks like she could beat Sleepy Joe, he\u2019s falling asleep. He has no idea what the hell he\u2019s doing or saying.\u201d\n\nTrump, who just weeks ago endorsed stronger background checks for gun owners, made no mention of gun control at all. The president has since rescinded that position.\n\n\u201cRepublicans will always uphold fundamental rights to keep and bear arms,\u201d he promised to applause.\n\nDespite the Judiciary Committee\u2019s vote earlier Thursday, Trump steered clear of impeachment until the one-hour mark of the speech, mocking their investigations briefly and then quickly moving on.\n\nBefore Trump\u2019s arrival, McCarthy was seemingly giddy talking about House Democrats, whose messaging on impeachment has been scattershot and has created confusion in their ranks this week. In a rare sign of unity, McCarthy stood next to his old nemesis, House Freedom Caucus founder Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio). The two men took turns assailing Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.).\n\n\u201cThe Republicans have never been more united,\u201d McCarthy said, suggesting that Trump is the most popular GOP president ever among Republican voters. \u201cNot even Ronald Reagan had as much support within the party as President Trump!\u201d\n\nMcCarthy even defended Trump\u2019s recent tweets calling Baltimore a \u201cdisgusting, rat and rodent infested mess\u201d and \u201cthe Worst in the USA.\u201d The minority leader tried to suggest that Trump\u2019s remark about this black-majority city was merely an expression of concern for a struggling urban area.\n\n\u201cI think the president coming here symbolizes that, yes, he cares about Baltimore, he cares about the people that live in Baltimore and he does not accept that you have to stay in poverty,\u201d McCarthy said.\n\nOutside the Baltimore Marriott Waterfront, where Republicans rented most of the rooms, protesters were having none of that. They picketed Trump\u2019s presence in their city, registering their discontent with signs and a giant inflatable rat with a Trump-like head.\n\n[Trump maligned Baltimore. Residents welcomed his visit with protests.]\n\nThe top political goal of the retreat is to convince Republicans, who have suffered an unusually high number of retirements recently, that they can flip the House in November 2020. That\u2019s why leaders flew Bishop in from North Carolina even before he was officially sworn into office.\n\nMcCarthy noted that, in the invalidated 2018 race, McCready only lost by 905 votes, a margin that Bishop grew to almost 4,000 votes \u2014 but, again, Republicans here gave most of the credit to Trump, who held a rally on the eve of the election.\n\n\u201cThe president made a considerable difference in this race coming in, when you watch the turnout, you watch the movement in numbers, just a week away from what they ended up on Election Day,\u201d McCarthy said.\n\nTrump and Republicans have faced criticism for doing little to rein in spending, including during the two years they controlled all levers of government. On Thursday, the Treasury Department said the federal deficit topped $200 billion in August, bringing the total deficit for the year to more than $1 trillion.\n\nMcCarthy said that if Republicans retake the House majority, the \u201cfirst thing we would do is make sure our debt is taken care of. This is continuing to grow.\u201d\n\nMcCarthy was just as happy to talk about Democrats\u2019 efforts to impeach the president. Foreshadowing a GOP election strategy, McCarthy accused Nadler of deciding to try to oust Trump well before he became chairman. He also taunted Pelosi and House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.), suggesting the two top leaders have no control over an increasingly liberal caucus.\n\n\u201cTell me how the Democrats are going to go back and ask for reelection on what they achieved,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cAll they achieved are investigations that have gone nowhere.\u201d\n\nBishop offered a similar assessment in his first comments to Capitol Hill reporters: \u201cWhat I heard more than anything else from voters as I passed them in the district is that what the social Democratic Party is articulating not only stuns them, it frightens them \u2014 not only on the subject of being consumed with the idea of destroying this president . . . but also their policy proposals, which are outlandish.\u201d\n\nFlanking McCarthy were Jordan, who battled with him on a regular basis when they held the majority, and Rep. Douglas A. Collins (Ga.), the top Republican on the Judiciary panel \u2014 Trump\u2019s two top-line defenders against Democratic investigations.\n\nJordan poked fun at the majority\u2019s inability to decide whether their probe of Trump constituted official impeachment proceedings. \u201cIs it an impeachment? Is it not an impeachment? Is it an investigation? Is it an inquiry?\u201d asked Jordan.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve got to come up with some way to go after this president because they\u2019re bound and determined to do it \u2014 even though the country knows it\u2019s not warranted, even though they know we shouldn\u2019t do it, even though the country in every single poll says don\u2019t do it,\u201d he said.\n\nCollins agreed, arguing that eight months of Democratic investigations have turned up \u201cnothing except smoke and mirrors.\u201d\n\n\u201cA dog and pony show [where] the dog and pony have left,\u201d he said.\n\nRead more at PowerPost", "description": "Top House Republicans showered the president with praise and blasted Democrats in their opening remarks.", "authors": ["Rachael Bade", "Congressional Reporter", "Paul Kane", "Senior Congressional Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/LJ0aQji-HMl3nHBW40cx6uV6XmE=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/22KFUOWVVAI6TBVMB4SQZSIXLA.jpg"}
