House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (D-Calif.) praised Trump for helping pull Bishop across the finish line, papering over the GOP\u2019s suburban problem and predicting that his party could retake the majority in 2020.\n\nMcCarthy seemed just as giddy about talking about House Democrats, whose messaging on impeachment has been scattershot and has created confusion in their ranks this week. In a rare sign of unity, McCarthy stood next to his old nemesis, House Freedom Caucus founder Jim Jordan (R-Ohio). The two men took turns assailing Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.).\n\n\u201cThe Republicans have never been more united,\u201d McCarthy said, suggesting that Trump is the most popular GOP president ever among Republican voters. \u201cNot even Ronald Reagan had as much support within the party as President Trump!\u201d\n\nTrump was scheduled to speak inside the hotel ballroom Thursday evening, followed by addresses Friday from Vice President Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\nMcCarthy even defended Trump\u2019s recent tweets calling Baltimore a \u201cdisgusting, rat and rodent infested mess\u201d and \u201cthe Worst in the USA.\u201d The minority leader tried to suggest that Trump\u2019s remark about this black-majority city was merely expressions of concern for a struggling urban area.\n\n\u201cI think the president coming here symbolizes that, yes, he cares about Baltimore, he cares about the people that live in Baltimore and he does not accept that you have to stay in poverty,\u201d McCarthy said.\n\nOutside the Baltimore Marriott Waterfront, where Republicans rented most of the rooms, protesters were having none of that. They picketed Trump\u2019s presence in their city, registering their discontent with signs and a giant inflatable rat with a Trump-like head.\n\nAuthorities cordoned off the hotel several blocks in every direction, keeping protesters far from the lawmakers. But protesters lined the streets from which Trump\u2019s motorcade was likely to enter the area.\n\n[Trump maligned Baltimore. Residents welcomed his visit with protests.]\n\nThe GOP retreat comes just two days after Bishop defeated Democrat Dan McCready by 2 percentage points in a district Trump won by a 12 percentage points in 2016 and the GOP has held for decades. But rather than hold up the results as a warning, McCarthy bragged about them and offered a rosy spin.\n\nIn fact, the top political goal of the retreat is to convince Republicans, who have suffered an unusually high number of retirements recently, that they can flip the House in November 2020. That\u2019s why leaders flew Bishop in from North Carolina even before he was officially sworn into office.\n\nMcCarthy noted that in the invalidated 2018 race McCready only lost by 905 votes, a margin that Bishop grew to almost 4,000 votes \u2014 but, again, Republicans here gave most of the credit to Trump, who held a rally on the eve of the election.\n\n\u201cThe president made a considerable difference in this race coming in, when you watch the turnout, you watch the movement in numbers, just a week away from what they ended up on Election Day,\u201d McCarthy said.\n\nTrump and Republicans have faced criticism for doing little to rein in spending, including during the two years they controlled all levers of government. On Thursday, the Treasury Department said the federal deficit topped $200 billion in August, bringing the total deficit for the year to more than $1 trillion.\n\nMcCarthy said that if Republicans retake the House majority, the \u201cfirst thing we would do is make sure our debt is taken care of. This is continuing to grow.\u201d\n\nMcCarthy was just as happy to talk about Democrats\u2019 efforts to impeach the president. Foreshadowing a GOP election strategy, McCarthy accused Nadler of deciding to try to oust Trump well before he became chairman. He also taunted Pelosi and House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.), suggesting the two top leaders have no control over an increasingly liberal caucus.\n\n\u201cTell me how the Democrats are going to go back and ask for reelection on what they achieved,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cAll they achieved are investigations that have gone nowhere.\u201d\n\nBishop offered a similar assessment in his first comments to Capitol Hill reporters: \u201cWhat I heard more than anything else from voters as I passed them in the district . is that what the Social Democratic Party is articulating not only stuns them, it frightens them \u2014 not only on the subject of being consumed with the idea of destroying this president \u2026 but also their policy proposals, which are outlandish.\u201d\n\nFlanking McCarthy were Jordan, who battled with him on a regular basis when they held the majority, and Rep. Douglas A. Collins (Ga.), the top Republican on the Judiciary panel \u2014 Trump\u2019s two top-line of defenders against Democratic investigations.\n\nJordan poked fun at the majority\u2019s inability to decide whether their probe of Trump constituted official impeachment proceedings. \u201cIs it an impeachment? Is it not an impeachment? Is an investigation? Is it an inquiry?\u201d asked Jordan.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve got to come up with some way to go after this president because they're bound and determined to do it \u2014 even though the country knows it's not warranted, even though they know we shouldn't do it, even though the country in every single poll says don't do it,\u201d he said.\n\nCollins agreed, arguing that eight months of Democratic investigations have turned up \u201cnothing except smoke and mirrors.\u201d\n\n\u201cA dog and pony show [where] the dog and pony have left,\u201d he said.\n\nRead more at PowerPost", "description": "Top House Republicans showered the president with praise and blasted Democrats in opening remarks kicking off the three-day retreat.", "authors": ["Rachael Bade", "Congressional Reporter", "Paul Kane", "Senior Congressional Correspondent", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/LJ0aQji-HMl3nHBW40cx6uV6XmE=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/22KFUOWVVAI6TBVMB4SQZSIXLA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
