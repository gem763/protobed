Marie said the club\u2019s dancers were given the chance to audition for the movie and they were told approximately two weeks before that the club would be closing.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s these girls\u2019 livelihoods on the line,\u201d she told Rolling Stone, blaming a lack of protection for sex workers under employment laws, rather than the film crew. \u201cAs far as being protected financially or getting paid, people feel like we are disposable.\u201d\n\nCurrent and former sex workers took to Twitter using \u201c#TweetYourHustle,\" a hashtag that was intended to be a way to market the movie. Instead, people used the tag to shed light on how their job and their platform have been diminished with government regulations of what can and cannot be posted to certain websites through FOSTA-SESTA, a law intended to combat sex trafficking on the Internet.\n\nThe law effectively requires websites, such as Craigslist, Reddit and Twitter, from effectively censoring or banning users and content to prevent sex trafficking.\n\nNonetheless, \"Hustlers\" is the best representation that sex workers have had so far, Marie said.\n\n\u201cWe deal with wage theft at the clubs all the time. We deal with toxic clients a lot of the time, and we have to learn to maneuver around that,\u201d she told Rolling Stone. \u201cThe movie shows all that. The movie shows us what the realities are, and it should help [audiences] unlearn the [misconceptions] that hurts us.\u201d", "description": "Box office hit \u201cHustlers\u201d brought in more than $33 million in its opening weekend, but the film has received not-so-glowing reviews from real-life sex workers.", "authors": ["Stephanie Pagones"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/hustlers-movie01.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
