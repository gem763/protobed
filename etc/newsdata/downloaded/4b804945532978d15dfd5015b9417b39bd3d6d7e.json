REUTERS/Andres Martinez Casares\n\nHAVANA (Reuters) - Haitian President Jovenel Moise said on Tuesday he was making moves to end the country\u2019s corrupt political and economic system, acknowledging one of the opposition\u2019s demands yet failing to convince protesters, who again took to the streets.\n\nMoise held a rare news conference at midday, rejecting calls for his resignation amid anger over alleged corruption by public officials, fuel shortages and rampant inflation that has fuelled five straight weeks of protests.\n\nInstead, Moise said he was ending questionable contracts with businesses made under previous administrations, accusing the guardians and beneficiaries of the unfair system of preventing the country from moving forwards, without naming names.\n\nHe also said he would work on getting the country back in gear and planned on addressing the nation more frequently.\n\nHaitians have complained of a leadership vacuum given Moise\u2019s rare appearances during a crisis which has shuttered schools, businesses and public offices. The last time Moise spoke publicly was nearly three weeks ago in a pre-recorded 2 a.m. televised address.\n\n\u201cI have heard your cries in the streets,\u201d said Moise, who has survived several waves of protests since taking office two and a half years ago, although this is the longest one.\n\nThe president said his resignation would not be the golden ticket to changing the corrupt system.\n\n\u201cInstead, it is necessary to sit down in order to discuss this.\u201d\n\nThe opposition rejected his assurances and calls for dialogue.\n\n\u201cMoise does not have the moral authority to attack the guardians of the system of exclusion that we are fighting today as his electoral campaign was financed by these people,\u201d said opposition leader Andre Michel.\n\n\u201cWe are all aware of the need to end this system ...(but) the solution of the crisis today requires above all the immediate resignation of Jovenel Moise.\u201d\n\nMoise was a businessman with little political experience before becoming president and is one of several officials implicated in the alleged embezzlement of billions of dollars of Venezuela-sponsored Petrocaribe funds.\n\nHe denies any wrongdoing, but his government has failed to investigate further.\n\nProtesters on Tuesday afternoon set barricades in the streets of Port-au-Prince and burnt tires in response to the president\u2019s address, although the spontaneous protests paled in comparison to some of the organized ones of recent weeks.\n\n\u201cHe is the one who is responsible for the current situation,\u201d said Jean Robinson Casamajor. \u201cIt would have been better if he had kept his mouth shut.\u201d\n\nDelince Odeus said his children could not go to school and food products were too expensive in a country where inflation is running around 20 percent.\n\n\u201cI am living in misery,\u201d said Odeus. \u201c I want the president to leave the country so I can have a better life.\u201d", "description": "Haitian President Jovenel Moise said on Tuesday he was making moves to end the country's corrupt political and economic system, acknowledging one of the opposition's demands yet failing to convince protesters, who again took to the streets.", "authors": ["Andres Martinez Casares", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441288982&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F004", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
