(Dobbs is a frequent and vocal critic of any Republicans who don\u2019t show complete loyalty to the president.)\n\nAfter saying that Syria is a country that can fend for itself, and the Trump administration is only talking about bringing a thousand troops home from the northern part of the country, Dobbs showed a list of prominent Republicans who pushed back against the president following his announcement\u2014including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, former U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley, and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC).\n\n\u201cThese people are just amazingly the problem,\u201d Dobbs huffed.\n\nAfter derisively listing off several Republicans\u2014notably directing much of his anger towards Haley\u2014Dobbs finished off his roll call by taking aim at former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, a Fox colleague.\n\nHuckabee, a Fox News contributor, took to Twitter on Monday morning to note that while he generally supports Trump\u2019s foreign policy, he thinks it\u2019s a \u201cHUGE mistake to abandon Kurds,\u201d as the Kurdish have been \u201cfaithful allies\u201d and we \u201cCANNOT abandon them.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is nonsense!\u201d Dobbs exclaimed. \u201cEach one of those people owes\u2014in my judgment, again, for multiple reasons, and a number of cases\u2014the American people and this president an apology.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust stand aside,\u201d he concluded.", "description": "\u201cThese people are just amazingly the problem,\u201d Dobbs huffed at one point.", "authors": ["Justin Baragona"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1080,w_1920,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570497252/lou-dobbs-tonight_20_zbz4c1", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
