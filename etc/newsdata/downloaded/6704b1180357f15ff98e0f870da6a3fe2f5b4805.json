People often eat foods that are high in Saturated fats\n\nRed meats\n\n'Empty' carbohydrates\n\nJunk Food And low in Fresh fruits and vegetables\n\nWhole Grains\n\nSeafood\n\nPoultry Health effects have been linked to things such as hypertension, heart disease, diabetes, obesity, colorectal cancer and dementia.\n\nThe increases and plateaus revealed by the mortality data were driven by two forms of heart disease: ischemic and hypertensive.\n\nIschemic heart disease develops as a result of the arteries becoming progressively more narrow, depriving the heart of sustaining blood and oxygen such that the muscle becomes tired and weak.\n\nHypertension, or high blood pressure, can also cause ischemic heart disease.\n\nAnd the main process that causes blood vessels to narrow is the buildup of lipids, of fats, inside them.\n\nThat fat build-up is part and parcel of obesity, which is in turn driven by poor diets high in fats, sugars and processed foods, and insufficient exercise.\n\nSocial factors raise risks for this entire chain of events, too. The study authors underline the disparities in both income and access to care that have long divided heart disease risks along racial and regional lines.\n\nThey also flagged the rise of endocarditis, a life-threatening infection of the heart, in Native and white Americas.\n\n'The significant increase in premature mortality that is associated with endocarditis among young white individuals and young American Indian and Alaska Native men is also worrisome, despite relatively few deaths,' the study authors wrote.\n\n'Coincident with the marked rise in deaths from opioid use, increase in endocarditis among certain groups may be associated with the opioid epidemic.'\n\nDespite declines identified at the broadest levels, the NIH authors wrote that increases in heart disease mortality in certain groups and driven by certain causes may indicate that the US's gains are flagging.\n\n'Without rapid and sustained progress against cardiovascular risk factors, public health goals to further reduce the burden of cardiovascular disease mortality in the United States' - to cut death rates by 20 percent between 2010 and 2020, according to the American Heart Association - 'are unlikely to be met,' they wrote.", "description": "Between 2000 and 2015, premature heart disease deaths declined by 20$ in the US, but NIH researchers say obesity is fueling stagnating rates, particularly among young white women.", "authors": ["Natalie Rahhal Deputy Health Editor For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/17/19796554-0-image-a-10_1571242914801.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
