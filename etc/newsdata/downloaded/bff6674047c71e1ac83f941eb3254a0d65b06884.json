Photo: Win McNamee/Getty Images\n\nA few weeks ago, Republicans were still insisting that Donald Trump\u2019s diplomatic posture toward Ukraine did not involve any quid pro quo \u2014 and if such a thing had happened, it would be bad. \u201cThere was no quid pro quo, you\u2019d have to have that if there was going to be anything wrong,\u201d said Senator Charles Grassley on September 25.\n\nAt a briefing today, White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney blithely described just such an arrangement. \u201cWhat you\u2019re describing is a quid pro quo,\u201d asserted a reporter. \u201cWe do that all the time,\u201d replied Mulvaney. \u201cDid he also mention to me the corruption related to the DNC server? Absolutely. No question about it. But that\u2019s it. That\u2019s why we held up the money \u2026 I have news for everybody: Get over it. There\u2019s going to be political influence in foreign policy.\u201d\n\nTechnically speaking, \u201cGet over it\u201d is opinion, not news. In any case, the old defense line that Trump did not use American foreign policy as a lever for his political interests has been totally overrun. Most recently, Gordon Sondland, the E.U. ambassador who has carried out Trump\u2019s policy, has admitted it was built around trading diplomatic recognition for Ukrainian investigations into Americans Trump wishes to discredit. Trump has openly proclaimed that he has an \u201cabsolute right\u201d to demand any country investigate any American for any reason he chooses.\n\nThrough sheer amoral shamelessness, Trump has created a new power for the presidency to commandeer the legal systems of foreign countries for his political benefit. In some ways, this resembles another right he has seized, to use his office to leverage private profit. (Mulvaney affirmed this right as well, proudly announcing that next year\u2019s G7 summit will be held at a Trump-owned property.) Mulvaney\u2019s matter-of-fact manner is merely a tonal shift announcing to his fellow partisans that they can stop denying Trump uses foreign policy to gin up overseas investigations of his domestic rivals and start defending it.\n\nMulvaney\u2019s bald-faced confession reportedly came as a shock to the rest of the White House, and the White House counsel\u2019s office officially informed reporters it had no involvement with his televised confession. (When the lawyers publicly say one of their clients has admitted guilt without their permission, it does not mean the confession is retracted.) Several hours after his statement, he \u201cwalked in back,\u201d in the Washington parlance \u2013 or, as would would phrase it in standard English, reversed himself:\n\nNEWS \u2014 Mick Mulvaney walks it back: \u201cLet me be clear, there was absolutely no quid pro quo between Ukrainian military aid and any investigation into the 2016 election.\u201d pic.twitter.com/Tq8kPA2wLm \u2014 Sahil Kapur (@sahilkapur) October 17, 2019\n\nBut of course Mulvaney literally said, \u201cDid [Trump] also mention to me in the past the corruption related to the DNC server? Absolutely. No question about that. But that\u2019s it, that\u2019s why we held up the money.\u201d If the normal pattern holds, we\u2019ll likely learn Mulvaney had to issue his humiliating reversal after Trump was angered by news coverage of his confession. But there\u2019s no ambiguity in his original statement statement \u2013 which, in any case, merely confirms what numerous other figures have said openly and in testimony.\n\nThe primary question left to be resolved, or not, is whether Trump\u2019s political interests were the only ones at stake. His lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, was being paid by Legitimate Businessmen Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, who have ties to the Russian Mafia. Unlike the American Mafia, Russian organized crime operates with the permission of, and in conjunction with, the government. Russian mobsters are not always advancing government policy, but they often are.\n\nThat fact is worth bearing in mind when considering some of the new reporting on the sources of Giuliani\u2019s financing. Over the last day, Reuters, NBC, and Time have all reported that Parnas and Fruman were themselves a financial pass-through for Dmytro Firtash, a Ukrainian oligarch with links to Russia. CNN reported yesterday that Giuliani is the subject of a counterintelligence investigation. A counterintelligence investigation is not the same thing as a criminal investigation. It is designed to identify subversive threats by foreign intelligence services.\n\nThis may sound shocking, but it follows naturally and almost inevitably from the known facts of the case. Trump turned his foreign policy in the region over to a lawyer who was not vetted by, and is not paid by, the U.S. government. (Sondland further affirmed that Giuliani was specifically empowered by Trump: \u201cMy understanding was that the president directed Mr. Giuliani\u2019s participation, that Mr. Giuliani was expressing the concerns of the president,\u201d he testified.) Giuliani is being paid instead by interested parties who likely operate in at least tacit coordination with Vladimir Putin.\n\nCongress may not have the means to produce proof of the ultimate source of Giuliani\u2019s financial backing. The FBI may not get it either \u2014 and if it does, it may not publicize it, because counterintelligence investigations, unlike criminal ones, do not necessarily result in charges and trials. Still, the public facts of Giuliani\u2019s role are themselves highly damning.\n\nWe know beyond any doubt that American policy was corrupted by Trump\u2019s political interests. The primary mystery is whether it was also corrupted by Russia\u2019s.\n\nThis column has been updated.", "description": "At a briefing today, White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney blithely confessed to a quid pro quo with Ukraine. \u201cThat\u2019s why we held up the money \u2026 I have news for everybody: Get over it.
