We\u2019ll look at a few right now, as they are our top stock trades to watch.\n\nTop Stock Trades for Tomorrow #1: The Trade Desk\n\ntop stock trades for TTD More\n\nMany of these stocks are great companies, but they have been on tremendous runs so far in 2019. The Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD) is one of them. However, shares fell more than 10% on Monday alone \u2014 with no news in sight.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWhen the market was breaking out of its month-long trading range last week, many of the relative growth leaders were not partaking in said upside. We flagged that at the time \u2014 both here on InvestorPlace and on Twitter. Monday\u2019s price action doesn\u2019t come as much of a surprise to those that saw those posts.\n\nIn any regard, investors are trying to balance buying these for the long haul and avoid getting run over on the decline. For TTD, shares knifed right through the 38.2% retracement like it wasn\u2019t even there.\n\nI have my eye on $200 now. Not only is that a significant round number that can act as a magnet, but near it we will also find the 200-day moving average and the 50% retracement. If it fails to hold, $180 is the next target.\n\nTop Stock Trades for Tomorrow #2: Netflix\n\ntop stock trades for NFLX More\n\nAfter this one was smoked on earnings, InvestorPlace readers cleaned up nicely when Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) was rejected from prior range support at $340 and the 200-day moving average.\n\nNow this name has been trapped in a series of relentless selling. Shares are pushing above downtrend resistance, but not in a meaningful manner as the 20-day moving average swiftly rejects NFLX.\n\nIf the 61.8% retracement holds as support, perhaps NFLX can again attempt to push above the 20-day. Above that and the 50% retracement is on the table.\n\nIf the 61.8% fails as support though, NFLX will likely retest its lows near $282.79.\n\nTop Stock Trades for Tomorrow #3: Twilio\n\ntop stock trades for TWLO More\n\nTwilio (NYSE:TWLO) stock didn\u2019t even slow down as it knifed through the 200-day moving and 38.2% retracement. Like TTD, TWLO is a great company but the writing was on the wall in terms of the price action.\n\nI\u2019m not sure if we\u2019ll get TWLO down to $100, but it might be an attractive entry point for interested bulls. Particularly with the 50% retracement near $105 and the 61.8% near $95.\n\n\n\n\n\nTop Stock Trades for Tomorrow #4: Alteryx\n\ntop stock trades for AYX More\n\nAlteryx (NYSE:AYX) has been a monster so far in 2019. Even after Monday\u2019s 15% beating, shares are still up 102% so far for the year. Lucky for us, we named AYX one of 7 mid-cap studs to watch this year.\n\nWith AYX slicing through the 50-day like a hot knife through butter though, investors need to take some precaution. Between $107 and $110 is channel support (blue line) and the 38.2% retracement.", "description": "It was a relatively calm day on Wall Street on Monday, with the exception of the selloff in high-growth stocks.
