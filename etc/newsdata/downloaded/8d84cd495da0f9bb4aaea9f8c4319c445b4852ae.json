Where to next? #HKracing pic.twitter.com/dHQptr5zR7 \u2014 HKJC Racing (@HKJC_Racing) October 27, 2019\n\nIf that doesn\u2019t happen, it means Millard will be forced to run him in Group races \u2013 on the turf \u2013 before potentially eyeing off the inaugural US$20 million Saudi Cup in February and/or a trip to Dubai in March to try and land an international blow on his preferred surface.\n\nCo-owner Eden Wong Chi-hong suggested to local reporters the Saudi Cup might be the preferred option, something Millard has spoken about previously.\n\nIn any case, fans will just have to be patient to see how he might get there as the South African trainer was very coy after the race.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a plan for him,\u201d said Millard, who giggled when asked to expand on what that was.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just going to see what happens now, see how he pulls up. It\u2019s very tough, you\u2019ve got to get an international Group dirt horse qualified on the turf. There\u2019s just so few races here.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a plan, hopefully we can pull it off.\u201d\n\nElusive State put in an eye-catching performance when resuming over an unsuitable trip and the step-up to the extended mile looked perfect for him second-up.\n\nStar jockey Joao Moreira settled him midfield on the rail as Buddies took up the pace, before finding clear running at the top of the straight and coming away to win like a $2.30 favourite should.\n\n\u201cHe ran so well first-up, he was indicating that he was wanting more ground but Tony had in mind another race but I said \u2018just, please, bide your time and run him in the 1,650m that is coming up\u2019. I am very pleased that he listened and the horse appreciated that,\u201d Moreira said.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen the top of him yet, Tony has done an amazing job with him. He has improved him enormously. I was riding him in a Class Four maybe 18 months ago and he was just about to drop to Class Five. I look at it now and I am riding him to Class Two wins, it is such a great training achievement.\u201d\n\nMillard was just as delighted with the run.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just really stoked, he won with authority. He\u2019s a proper Group dirt horse,\u201d Millard said. \u201cHe gave the second horse [10] pounds and he gave them a hiding.\n\n\u201cHe did everything we wanted and I think I can still get him better.\u201d\n\nSpeaking of winning with authority, it was another commanding day in the saddle for Moreira, who completed a treble on the all-dirt card.\n\nAs well as Elusive State, he saluted aboard Fortune Happiness and Bear Slam to record his 30th victory of the campaign, extending his lead over reigning champion Zac Purton, who went winless on Sunday, to 10.\n\nThe Brazilian is on fire, riding at least one winner at each of the past 13 meetings.\n\n\u201cBeing on top of the horse\u2019s form is important. The numbers are popping up because of that, I have been putting a lot of time into my form and I have ended up on some nice horses lately,\u201d Moreira said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all related to not only my hard work but the kindness of the trainers and owners who are supporting me and putting me on nice horses.\u201d", "description": "Trainer Tony Millard was at his cryptic best on Sunday when discussing what comes next for his impressive dirt specialist Elusive State....", "authors": ["Tom Biddington", "Sam Agars", "Trenton Akers"], "top_image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_image_scmp_generic/public/d8/images/methode/2019/10/27/0f74b136-f8a1-11e9-87ad-fce8e65242a6_image_hires_190044.JPG?itok=zizPiLVY&v=1572174051", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
