Read more\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to lie and sugarcoat it,\u201d Lloyd said. \u201cIt was absolutely the worst time of my life. It affected my relationship with my husband, with friends. It really was rock bottom of my entire career. But somehow, you see light at the end of the tunnel, and I can honestly say I\u2019m having more fun now playing than I ever have in my career. I think I just learned a lot throughout it.\u201d\n\nLloyd also said she believed she was playing her best football coming into this year\u2019s World Cup, and deserved more than a place on the bench. \u201cThere\u2019s no denying it,\u201d Lloyd said. \u201cI deserved to be on that field that whole World Cup, but I wasn\u2019t. And I think I\u2019ve grown as a person, as a player. It sucked. It absolutely sucked.\u201d\n\nWhile Lloyd was the undoubted star of the 2015 World Cup, her US teammate Megan Rapinoe was in the spotlight for much of this summer\u2019s tournament, as she made an impact on the field and spoke out on social issues off it. Lloyd told Foudy that her frustration was at her personal situation rather than any resentment towards her teammates.\n\n\u201cI was super happy for my teammates and happy for Megan [Rapinoe], who put the team on her back, and for several other players,\u201d Lloyd said. \u201cIt was great to see, and I\u2019m happy that I could still have been a part of it.\u201d\n\nLloyd has been linked to a move to the NFL as a kicker, but she said that her main focus is playing in next year\u2019s Olympics. The US are currently looking for a new coach after the departure of Jill Ellis.\n\n\u201cI hope a coach comes in that values me, respects me, wants me [as] a part of the Olympic plans,\u201d Lloyd said. \u201cThere\u2019s no question my abilities are there. I\u2019m able to do it. Physically I\u2019m able to do it. I would love to be a part of it, but I want to have an open, honest conversation, because if I\u2019m not, I can\u2019t go through what I went through for three years.\u201d\n\nLloyd started her career with the US in 2005 and has scored 118 goals in 286 appearances.", "description": "Carli Lloyd won her second World Cup with the US this summer but it\u2019s safe to say she did not enjoy the experience as much as her teammates", "authors": ["Guardian Sport"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6d62509e4138bdd4475db089ef34442881c9607/0_142_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4d3ad86ed256f4769e1440446f37e1d1", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
