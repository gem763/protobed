Freeman.\n\nMiami lassos Dallas in snow\n\nBy DENNE H. FREEMAN\n\nAP Sports Writer\n\nIRVING, Texas (AP) - Don Shula has coached in 486 National Football League games, but never had he witnessed anything like Leon Lett\u2019s blunder on a bizarre snowy Thanksgiving Day in Texas Stadium.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen one end like that before,\u201d the Miami coach said of Pete Stoyanovich\u2019s second-chance, last-second field goal that gave the Dolphins a startling 16-14 victory over the Dallas Cowboys.\n\nLett, a defensive tackle whose hotdog play in January\u2019s Super Bowl allowed Buffalo\u2019s Don Beebe to catch him from behind and stop a sure touchdown, touched the ball after Stoyanovich\u2019s 41-yard attempt was blocked by Jimmie Jones, allowing Miami\u2019s Jeff Dellenbach to recover on the Dallas 1 with three seconds to play.\n\nAfter his teammates scraped away snow to clear a kicking area, Stoyanovich hit the winner through the snowy mist from 19 yards on a day better fit for tobogganing as the frozen crowd at Texas Stadium sat in shocked amazement.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the most disappointing loss I\u2019ve ever been around,\u201d said Dallas Coach Jimmy Johnson. \u201cWe had it won. Leon made a mistake. One of a hundred mistakes in the game. But that one cost us.\u201d\n\nAs for the 9-2 Dolphins, they piled on each other as if they had just won the championship.\n\n\u201cI thought it was all over when Pete got blocked but at least our people had the knowledge to get down there and recover it,\u201d said Shula, who gained his record 327th career win. \u201cYou don\u2019t ever give Stoyanovich a second chance.\u201d\n\nSaid Dellenbach: \u201cWe all had the presence of mind that they had to touch the ball so we stayed away. I tried to get them to touch it and they did. We knew what the rules were.\u201d\n\nReferee Ed Hochuli said once a ball is blocked, it is similar to a punt. Miami could gain possession only if Dallas touched the ball. Otherwise, it didn\u2019t matter if the Dolphins grabbed it. They couldn\u2019t advance it and the Cowboys would get possession. All Dallas had to do was let the ball roll to a halt.\n\nBut Lett suddenly slid in, kicking the ball in the process, and Dellenbach recovered. The Cowboys couldn\u2019t believe it. The crowd hushed. The officials huddled. The players argued. Then came Hochuli\u2019s ruling: Miami\u2019s ball with three seconds left.\n\nCoincidentally, Lett had lost the ball on the 1 in the last Super Bowl to Beebe, who batted it out of his hands after a fumble recovery with the Cowboys romping.\n\nSaid Johnson: \u201cI still don\u2019t know exactly what happened but someone said Leon\u2019s leg hit the ball as he slid. We are hurting now. \u2026 I told Leon we all make mistakes and that\u2019s part of this game. Darrin Smith was telling everybody to get away from the ball, get back!\u201d\n\nSmith said not everybody knows what to do in that situation.\n\n\u201cI mean, it\u2019s a strange play,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s happening fast. He just went for the ball. He\u2019s trying to get the ball so we win.\u201d\n\nLett left the locker room without saying a word. A friend grabbed his clothes and took them to him in the training room so he wouldn\u2019t have to face reporters.\n\nWide receiver Michael Irvin said the Cowboys were already celebrating victory.\n\n\u201cI grabbed Troy (Aikman) and we were hugging, then they said they had the ball,\u201d Irvin said. \u201cIt was all so strange.\u201d\n\nRookie Kevin Williams caught a touchdown pass and returned a punt 64 yards for a touchdown as Dallas (7-4) apparently had the game in hand.\n\nThe game was played in the harsh conditions of a 5-degree wind-chill factor. It was the first time it had ever snowed during a Cowboys\u2018 regular season home game in Texas Stadium.\n\n\u201cCan you believe this one for bad luck?\u201d asked Cowboys safety James Washington. \u201cIt\u2019s the unluckiest thing I ever saw.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs soon as I get back to Miami, I\u2019m going to take my kids to see Santa Claus and thank him,\u201d said Miami defensive tackle Mike Golic. \u201cMan, oh, man, what a game.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "As part of its celebration of its 100th season, the NFL is designating a Game of the Week, each chosen to highlight a classic matchup.
