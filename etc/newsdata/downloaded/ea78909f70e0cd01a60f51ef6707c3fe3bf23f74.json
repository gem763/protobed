Biden himself on Tuesday said that refusal to share the complaint amounted to grounds for impeachment.\n\nSchiff, who opened the hearings with sharply worded opening statement in which he called Maguire\u2019s decision to withhold the complaint \u201ctroubling\u201d and \u201cbewildering,\u201d pressed him on why he did not find that the complaint was \u201curgent,\u201d given that congressionally appropriated military aid was being withheld from Ukraine even as the complaint was being examined by White House lawyers.\n\n\u201cIt was urgent and important, but my job,\u201d Maguire said, \u201cwas to comply with the whistleblower protection act and adhere to the definition of urgent concern, which is a legal term.\u201d\n\nEarly on Thursday, a declassified version of the whistleblower\u2019s complaint was released to the public, revealing that the whistleblower who raised the alarm about Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky reported the White House moved to \u201clock down\u201d the transcript of the conversation within days.\n\nSchiff, who on Wednesday said a readout of Trump\u2019s conversation with Zelensky reflected \u201ca classic mafia-like shakedown of a foreign leader,\u201d has publicly condemned Maguire\u2019s reticence to share the complaint as evidence of a \u201cpervasive\u201d cover-up. Schiff has denied that there are any legal hindrances to sharing the complaint with his committee, despite Maguire\u2019s insistence.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think this is a problem of the law,\u201d Schiff told reporters after a closed-door briefing with the committee last week. \u201cThe problem lies elsewhere. And we\u2019re determined to do everything we can to determine what this urgent concern is, [and] to make sure that the national security is protected and to make sure that this whistleblower is protected.\u201d\n\nMaguire, caught between Department of Justice officials who directed him not to release the complaint and Michael Atkinson, the intelligence community inspector general who determined that the complaint \u201crelates to one of the most significant and important of the Director of National Intelligence\u2019s responsibilities to the American people,\u201d released a public statement Tuesday saying that he hoped to come to a solution.\n\n\u201cI want to make clear that I have upheld my responsibility to follow the law every step of the way,\u201d Maguire said. \u201cI am committed to protecting whistleblowers and ensuring every complaint is handled appropriately.\u201d\n\nThe Office of Legal Counsel issued a formal explanation Wednesday arguing that the complaint didn\u2019t satisfy the criteria for an \u201curgent concern,\u201d thereby bypassing the legal stipulation that it be shared with Congress. But hours after that argument was released, The Washington Post reported that the acting director had threatened to resign if he was not allowed to freely testify before Congress unhindered\u2014a report that Maguire has denied.\n\n\u201cAt no time have I considered resigning my position since assuming this role on Aug. 16, 2019,\u201d Maguire said in a statement following the Post\u2019s report. \u201cI have never quit anything in my life, and I am not going to start now.\u201d\n\nMaguire reportedly told White House officials that unless the president intended to assert executive privilege, he would speak with lawmakers to defend his actions.", "description": "Joseph Maguire defended his handling of an explosive secret whistleblower complaint about the president, but he faced tough questions on why he held it back.", "authors": ["Scott Bixby", "National Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569472561/190930-bixby-maguire-testimony-tease_z5hsvq", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
