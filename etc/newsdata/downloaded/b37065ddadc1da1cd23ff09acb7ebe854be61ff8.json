Can you hear the cha-cha-cha in The Rolling Stones' \"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\"? Or the mambo in Ray Charles' \"What I'd Say\"? Or the Afro Cuban clave beat in \"Bo Diddley\" by Bo Diddley?\n\nThis week we put on our lab coats for a deeper dive into that DNA with two experts: Bobby Sanabria, a multi Grammy-nominated musician/educator and Lauren Onkey, the Senior Director of NPR Music and a walking encyclopedia on the history of rock and roll.\n\nLike our country itself, rock and roll is an alchemy of distinct cultural expressions that exist side by side.
