The political partnership between Corbyn and John McDonnell sustained the Labour left at its weakest moments. \u201cJeremy is my best friend in parliament,\u201d McDonnell used to say, before being swiftly corrected by his wife, Cynthia Pinto: \u201cYour only friend!\u201d\n\nJeremy Corbyn sets out election pitch and targets another upset Read more\n\nThis explains why, in part, Corbyn was chosen as the Labour left\u2019s flagbearer in the 2015 leadership contest: while the affable backbencher was then almost universally liked by his colleagues \u2013 one or two things have happened since \u2013 McDonnell was contemptuous towards Labour MPs he believed were spineless and unprincipled. That contempt was reciprocated in kind: when McDonnell attempted to stand for leader in 2007, Tom Watson wrote a blog wondering why the left was fielding someone so discourteous to his colleagues. Surely it made more sense, he suggested, for them to field the kindly Corbyn instead.\n\nIn the Labour left\u2019s long wilderness years, the Corbyn-McDonnell axis functioned like this. McDonnell was the working-class intellectual, found in parliamentary corridors clutching a well-thumbed copy of Parliamentary Socialism, a tract written by Marxist intellectual Ralph Miliband excoriating the party\u2019s lack of radicalism. At the heart of his operation was Andrew Fisher, who became Labour\u2019s head of policy and was the author of the party\u2019s 2017 manifesto: together, they convened politically sympathetic economists and wrote alternative budgets in an attempt to solve the lack of intellectual vision on a Labour left seemingly in terminal decline.\n\nCorbyn was more of a \u201csocialism from the gut\u201d politician: his beliefs had more to do with an emotional revulsion at injustices such as homelessness and poverty than socialist literature. His interest in international issues \u2013 from Palestine to Sri Lanka \u2013 led him to be regarded as a sort of \u201cforeign secretary of the left\u201d and the campaigning zeal he later displayed in leadership and general elections manifested itself in a hyperactive commitment to every progressive cause going.\n\nWhile Corbyn enthused crowds in the 2015 leadership election, McDonnell oversaw messaging and strategy; in the early chaotic days after Corbyn\u2019s triumph, McDonnell acted as a stabilising force. But if there is a political dictum that however close a friendship, tensions between the offices of leader and shadow chancellor will test it, Corbyn and McDonnell definitively prove it. Tensions over a strategy to confront the left\u2019s antisemitic fringe and on Labour\u2019s Brexit position caused genuine strain \u2013 and the shadow chancellor is far more willing to compromise with the party\u2019s right than his old reputation as the \u201chard man of Corbynism\u201d suggests. In truth, McDonnell scents a historic opportunity to enact the radical economic agenda he has spent decades formulating, and fears it being unnecessarily snatched away because of self-inflicted injury. Shifting Labour\u2019s position on Brexit to accommodate remainers, for example, was something his team saw as an issue that threatened the entire project.\n\nWhich brings us to the departure of Karie Murphy from the management of Corbyn\u2019s office. Corbyn could hardly be further from the hostile stereotype of a demagogic leftist enamoured of confrontation. The leader is conflict-averse, which is not something that can be said of Murphy, a former nurse and office manager for Tom Watson before their bitter schism over Corbyn\u2019s leadership. When she assumed her role in 2016, she imposed discipline and order on a chaotic operation, was pivotal in heading off the coup attempt, and drove through a flagship community organising initiative.\n\nBut Murphy undoubtedly eclipsed McDonnell\u2019s old role, becoming the second most powerful figure in the leader\u2019s office after Corbyn himself. The rise of powerful officials within the Corbyn project led one senior figure to half-jokingly suggest reading Leon Trotsky\u2019s work on how the Soviet bureaucracy subverted the Russian revolution. There is perhaps a more measured way to describe Murphy\u2019s time in the leader\u2019s office: without her efforts to professionalise, Labour would not have achieved its 2017 result, but the same stubbornness and determination that saved the Corbyn project stopped it becoming flexible in a period of unprecedented political tumult. Andrew Fisher\u2019s announcement that he was leaving at the end of the year caused genuine internal shockwaves, too, caused not by Murphy\u2019s management style \u2013 unlike some of his colleagues, the two did not clash \u2013 but rather general frustrations with the operation.\n\nWhat has undeniably reasserted itself is the Corbyn-McDonnell axis. Crucially, this has been at the instigation of Corbyn himself: the bungled attempt to remove Watson as deputy leader provoked genuine rage in the Labour leader and led him to conclude that sweeping internal change was necessary. This was a position his two longest-standing allies, McDonnell and the shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, had long held.\n\nThe challenges now confronting the project are formidable. A Labour opposition office is a hothouse at the best of times, but for those who expected to be consigned to the fringes of politics, being plunged into the heart of Britain\u2019s greatest political tumult since the second world war has caused huge personal stress. The Brexit culture war has eclipsed Labour\u2019s domestic agenda, riven havoc amongst its 2017 electoral coalition, and caused profound internal splits. Some senior MPs representing urban constituencies talk of furious remainers currently showing no interest in returning to the Labour fold; an MP representing a leave community complains that ultra-remainers show no interest in constituencies such as their own. While Corbyn is often caricatured as a closet lexiteer, Brexit is, in truth, a demoralising distraction from the things he\u2019s interested in: aides speak of his eyes lighting up when ideas to address the climate emergency are mentioned.\n\nThe operation appeared blindsided by Boris Johnson\u2019s rise to power: its leading figures are keenly aware that his key messages, such as \u201cget Brexit done\u201d are clear and have cut through. Labour risks being defined by its Tory opponents, and core messages from the party have yet to be signed off. Yet amid the angst, there is still genuine optimism to be found. However difficult the circumstances now, senior Labour officials remark, things were far worse before the 2017 election \u2013 Theresa May\u2019s ill-fated decision to call it saved a Corbyn project that otherwise could have collapsed within a year.\n\nThe party\u2019s domestic agenda \u2013 which will be sharper and more radical than in 2017 \u2013 is demonstrably popular, but only an election provides a real opportunity for it to cut through. A mass membership will be mobilised, Labour will clearly offer the best realistic route for remainers to stay in the EU, and as the 2017 election showed, the more exposure Corbyn receives, the more he is liked. It is when campaigning that Corbyn is in his element. But as this week\u2019s British Election Study underlined \u2013 the research showed party loyalties have been significantly eroded \u2013 we live in a time of unprecedented political fluidity. Any confident prediction of the coming contest emerges from either naivety or delusion.\n\n\u2022 Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist", "description": "Karie Murphy\u2019s departure will let the McDonnell-Corbyn alliance reassert itself, says Guardian columnist Owen Jones", "authors": ["Owen Jones"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/63779d972ab3ba7ce927c917f14e3b8cee782014/0_388_6112_3667/master/6112.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=d222f040e4dae286a433e0875e414587", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
