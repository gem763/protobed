Ever since Jordon Ibe left for Bournemouth, Anfield has lacked a winger with his precise qualities: name beginning with J; unusual spelling; \u201con\u201d ending. As such, they will nause up Manchester United by signing Jadon Sancho from Borussia Dortmund.\n\nUnited, meanwhile, are keen to solve their goalscoring crisis by buying Mario Mandzukic. The 67-year-old striker is not deemed good enough for Juventus\u2019 Champions League squad, but after studying 8,034,612 different options, the club\u2019s scouts have concluded that he is the only one desperate enough to sign for them. \u201cYet another triumph for Ed Woodward,\u201d Ed Woodward will doubtless recommend is written about Ed Woodward.\n\nSon seems to melt away Spurs\u2019 woes, but hapless Red Star no bellwether | Barney Ronay Read more\n\nAcross Manchester, Pep Guardiola is looking for a new midfielder he can force himself to play in defence. A club scout was sent to watch Sandro Tonali, Brescia\u2019s 19-year-old prospect; Paris Saint-Germain were there too, with Inter, Juve and Milan also interested.\n\nReal Madrid, meanwhile, are looking to get shot rather than get in. Brahim D\u00edaz, the 20-year-old midfielder snatched from Manchester City, has been told he can leave, and Isco has also accepted that his time at the Bernab\u00e9u is over. Meanwhile, Unai Emery is having so much fun messing Dani Ceballos about that he\u2019d like to do so permanently. Arsenal have offered \u00a326m for the unlucky blighter, but Madrid are holding out for \u00a330m \u2013 bounty they will spend on not signing Paul Pogba.\n\nArsenal are one of five clubs watching Aaron Hickey, Hearts\u2019 tough 17-year-old full-back. Manchester City, Newcastle, Liverpool, Southampton and Norwich love his bite too.\n\nAlso shopping in Scotland are Crystal Palace and Aston Villa, who are competing for the signature of Rangers\u2019 Alfredo Morelos. Morelos, for his part, is torn: brilliant though Selhurst\u2019s Tasty Jerk is, and brilliant though Villa Park is, he, like all his teammates, has a soft spot for being publicly blamed every time Steven Gerrard gets his tactics wrong.\n\nElsewhere, Tottenham would like to buy Carles Ale\u00f1\u00e1 from Barcelona. Mauricio Pochettino wasn\u2019t able to shift Christian Eriksen in the summer window but hopes that by buying his replacement in January, the, er, hirsute playmaker will get the message. Ale\u00f1\u00e1, meanwhile, has made just one appearance this season and his situation is also being monitored by Real Betis.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nFor their part, Barcelona have paid Atl\u00e9tico Madrid \u20ac15m for first refusal on Sa\u00fal \u00d1\u00edguez and Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Gim\u00e9nez, should they ever fancy hanging about till Lionel Messi does something of a weekend. They have denied reports that the cash was actually sent to resolve a row over the Antoine Griezmann transfer.\n\nAtl\u00e9ti, though, are not sitting still. They \u2013 and Juventus \u2013 like the look of West Brom\u2019s Nathan Ferguson. The 19-year-old defender, who can play anywhere across the back four but is most comfortable on the right, will presumably be flattered by the news, but may find it hard to forsake the tremendous indoor Indian barbecue served at The Vine pub, just a mile or so\u2019s stagger from the Hawthorns.", "description": "Mario Mandzukic to Manchester United? | Sandro Tonali to Manchester City? | Isco and Brahim D\u00edaz to leave Real Madrid?", "authors": ["Daniel Harris"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9eb750269180ef85daae2f1e62886324a75bc0ad/187_109_2488_1493/master/2488.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=667e496bac4d1de3195f4615bbdaf2af", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
