It's another witch-hunt. Here we go again,\" an agitated Trump said Thursday as he returned to Washington after four days at the United Nations in New York. \"They're frozen - the Democrats.\n\nThey're going to lose the election; they know it. That's why they're doing it. And it should never be allowed, what's happened to this president.\"\n\nThe velocity at which the whistleblower story enveloped Washington was remarkable.\n\nIn just a few days' time, a whistleblower's complaint that Trump encouraged the president of Ukraine to help investigate political rival Joe Biden led to congressional hearings, allegations of a White House cover-up and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announcing the start of an impeachment inquiry.\n\nThe White House was not ready.\n\nWhile Trump's strategists have long believed an impeachment push could backfire against Democrats, the president has also voiced concern that impeachment could become the first line of his political obituary.\n\nHe lashed out after Pelosi announced the inquiry, firing off tweets from his Manhattan penthouse and winding down his U.N. stay with a press conference where he seemed aggrieved and subdued.\n\nThe next morning, at what was meant to be a salute to the workers from the US Mission to the United Nations, Trump let loose with a threatening tone on Thursday.\n\n\"I want to know who's the person, who's the person who gave the whistleblower the information? Because that's close to a spy,\" Trump said, according to audio released by The Los Angeles Times. \"You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? The spies and treason, we used to handle it a little differently than we do now.\"\n\nAt the same time, Joseph Maguire, the acting director of national intelligence, appeared before Congress and acknowledged that the complaint filed by the whistleblower alleged serious wrongdoing by the president.\n\nAligning themselves with the White House, most Republican legislators at the hearing wasted few chances to try to undermine the unidentified whistleblower's credibility.\n\nThey tried shifting the focus to Democrats and unproven theories, much like those the GOP used to attack special counsel Robert Mueller when he testified about his Russia investigation over the summer.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut called it a \"kaleidoscope of fantabulistic conspiracy theories.\"\n\nWith his trademark scattershot style, Giuliani played a key role in muddying the facts and trying to undermine the credibility of the Mueller investigation.\n\nIn this case, Giuliani's outreach to the new Ukraine government to investigate Joe Biden made up a major piece of the whistleblower's complaint, and the former New York City mayor went on offense again as scrutiny of his actions intensified.\n\n\"The complaint is questionable and the whistleblower is a pure partisan,\" Giuliani said, without supplying evidence for either assertion.\n\nHe then tried to shift the focus onto Rep. Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. He claimed the Californian had been trying \"frame\" Trump for years and \"should be investigated for lying, enabling perjury, and trampling on constitutional rights.\"\n\nA weary West Wing, after being shadowed for two years by the Mueller probe, lacks the organization required to sustain a serious impeachment fight.\n\nDuring the Clinton impeachment, the White House had a muscular team of veteran lawyers and aggressive press aides to try to shape news coverage in their favor.
