The problem is, when you\u2019re speaking to foreign leaders, you don\u2019t want foreign leaders to feel that they shouldn\u2019t be speaking openly and good.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cAnd the same thing with an American president. You want them to be able to express themselves without knowing that every single word was going to be going out and going out all over the world.\u201d\n\nHe said he\u2019d \u201ctalk\u201d about releasing details about the call, noting \u201cyou have to be a little bit shy about doing that.\u201d\n\nEarlier in the day, however, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said releasing details about the call would not be appropriate \u201cexcept in the most extreme circumstances.\u201d\n\n\"There\u2019s no evidence that that would be appropriate at this point,\" he added.\n\nThe new details came after The Washington Post reported that Trump\u2019s call with a foreign leader had been the subject of a whistleblower complaint. That complaint has dominated the recent news cycle and generated massive scrutiny among congressional Democrats, who have unsuccessfully pressed the Trump administration to release information about it to lawmakers. Trump has defended the call, saying it was \u201cperfect\u201d and not improper and deriding the whistleblower, who has remained anonymous, as \u201cpartisan\u201d while acknowledging he doesn\u2019t know the person\u2019s identity. Speaking to reporters earlier Sunday, Trump appeared to confirm that he discussed Biden in the phone call with Zelensky but said the conversation did not involve any kind of quid pro quo. The call came at a time when the administration was reviewing military aid to Ukraine, and Democrats have questioned whether Trump had withheld the aid as part of an effort to press for the Biden investigation. (The Hill)\n\nImportant to note, however, is that the whistleblower complaint was not based on first-hand knowledge of the call.\n\nThe \"whistleblower\" did not have direct knowledge of the Trump/Ukraine phone call -- the account is based on hearsay. The media then offered its characterization of this hearsay. If you think that's sufficient to demand impeachment, you must have slept through the last 3 years \u2014 Michael Tracey (@mtracey) September 22, 2019\n\n21 paragraphs in they admit:\n\n\n\n\u2018The whistleblower did not have direct knowledge of the communications\u2019\n\n\n\nOooooooof https://t.co/8fz8Ai7LdL \u2014 Jack Posobiec ???? (@JackPosobiec) September 21, 2019\n\nPresident Trump weighed in on Twitter, saying the media are overlooking the real story.\n\nNow the Fake News Media says I \u201cpressured the Ukrainian President at least 8 times during my telephone call with him.\u201d This supposedly comes from a so-called \u201cwhistleblower\u201d who they say doesn\u2019t even have a first hand account of what was said.
