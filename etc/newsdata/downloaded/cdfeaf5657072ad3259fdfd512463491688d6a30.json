We had to drag containers of water up the hill.\n\n\"On one day our pig arc blew off the cliff and I had to climb down and drag it back up.\n\n\"We had no income and we were investing in the land.\u201d\n\n(Image: Greg Martin/Cornwall Live WS)\n\n(Image: Greg Martin/Cornwall Live WS)\n\nBut the work was expensive and in a few months they were forced to stop renting and move onto the land.\n\nThe mother-of-four said: \"\u201cWe had a horsebox and a shack Todd built out of some pallets and the bell tent. We had some ducks and some geeses.\n\n\u201cWe decided to do 28 days camping because that\u2019s allowed in the scope of the land. Everyone loved it, we got some great reviews.\n\n\u201cBut I fell pregnant over that summer and I was sick every single day and all night. I got insomnia, so I didn\u2019t sleep. It was so cold and wet. It just rained and rained.\n\n\u201cAnd then we went into winter and it was brutal and then in March the Beast from the East came and I swear to god I had snow on the end of my bed and I was eight months pregnant.\u201d\n\n(Image: Greg Martin/Cornwall Live WS)\n\nIn sub zero temperatures, the family\u2019s generator broke, they had no heating, one car battery and a broken solar panel for power and were effectively just about existing through one of the most brutal winters in history.\n\nBut the family did not let the weather beat them and persevered, buying two static caravans at the end of March 2018 and moving to a more sheltered part of the field.\n\nThe 36-year-old said: \"Harry decided to come a week early.\n\n\"I was painting the caravans and my waters broke That was last April.\n\n\"We didn\u2019t do camping that year. We were stretched to breaking point. We didn\u2019t have the money.\n\n\u201cOver the year that followed we got back on track. We did the summer and winter and winter really wasn\u2019t that bad last year.\n\n\"We were living the dream. We had more power - two solar panels and four batteries. We got a telly. We were learning things along the way.\u201d\n\n(Image: Greg Martin/Cornwall Live WS)\n\n(Image: Greg Martin/Cornwall Live WS)\n\nSince then, Davina and Todd have established Cligga Cliff Farm at the heart of the Perranporth community.\n\nThe couple are also heavily involved with the Plastic Free Perranporth movement and have even set up a monthly plastic free market.\n\nThe family have also brought cows to their land starting their own micro-dairy, get day old turkeys in July to rear them up for Christmas and have 16 litters of piglets every year.\n\nDavina said that the family's dream of self-sufficiency was within reach.\n\nShe said: \"\"By the end of next summer we\u2019ll be self sufficient.\"", "description": "Davina Foster and her family moved to Cornwall - where they are now living in a field - after falling in love with the idea of moving to the far south west", "authors": ["Jacqui Merrington", "Kaisha Langton", "Image", "Greg Martin Cornwall Live Ws"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20570291.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_RIP-Family-give-up-city-life-in-London-and-move-to-live-off-grid-in-Cornish-field.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
