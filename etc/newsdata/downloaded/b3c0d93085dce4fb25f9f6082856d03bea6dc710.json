Two missiles struck the Iranian tanker Sabiti traveling through the Red Sea off the coast of Saudi Arabia on Friday, Iranian officials said, the latest incident in the region amid months of heightened tensions between Tehran and the U.S. (SHANA via AP)\n\nIranian media said the blasts occurred around 5am and 5.20am local time\n\nbacking: The extra troops shore up de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia, crown prince Mohammed bin Salman\n\nEsper said the decision followed discussions with the Saudi minister of defense about the country's defensive capabilities.\n\n'Saudi Arabia is a longstanding security partner in the Middle East and has asked for additional support to supplement their own defense and defend the international rules-based order,' he told reporters at the Pentagon.\n\nThe U.S. will send two F-15 fighter jet squadrons, other planes, two Patriot missile batteries and one anti-missile defense system known as THAAD. U.S. officials said the effort will involve about 1,800 service members.\n\nThe Sept. 14 attack on the Saudi oil facilities, as well as earlier ones on a pipeline in the kingdom and ships in the gulf, stem from the President Donald Trump's decision to unilaterally withdraw America from Tehran's nuclear deal with world powers and impose crushing sanctions targeting Iran's crude oil sales and shipments.\n\nIranian officials warned for weeks that if they could not sell their oil, neither would anyone else in the region.\n\nThe missile assault in the Red Sea spiked oil prices amid months of heightened tensions at sea across the wider Mideast.\n\nThere was no acknowledgement of the incident from Saudi Arabia, which in September had more than half of its daily crude oil production knocked out by an assault the U.S. blamed on Iran, something denied by Tehran.\n\n'This latest incident, if confirmed to be an act of aggression, is highly likely to be part of the wider narrative of deteriorating relations between Saudi and the U.S. and Iran,' private maritime security firm Dryad Maritime warned.\n\n'It is likely that the region ... will face another period of increasing maritime threats, as the Iranian and Saudi geopolitical stand-off continues,' it added.\n\nThe attack reportedly took place around 5 a.m. and damaged two storerooms aboard the oil tanker Sabiti, state media reported. It also briefly caused an oil leak into the Red Sea near the Saudi port city of Jiddah that later was stopped, state-run IRNA news agency reported.\n\nThe Sabiti turned on its tracking devices late Friday morning in the Red Sea, putting its location some 80 miles southwest of Jiddah, according to data from MarineTraffic.com. The ship is carrying some 1 million barrels of crude oil, according to an analysis from data firm Refinitiv.\n\nThe Sabiti last turned on its tracking devices in August near the Iranian port city of Bandar Abbas. Iranian tankers routinely turn off their trackers as U.S. sanctions target the sale of Iran's crude oil.\n\nThe Iranian tanker was hit following months of tensions around the Arabian Peninsula which has seen attacks on tankers, drones and oil facilities\n\nOn September 14 Saudi Arabia's largest oil refinery at Abqaiq was hit by explosive-laden drones that Riyadh said came from Iran\n\nImages released by Iran's Petroleum Ministry appeared to show no damage to the Sabiti visible from its bridge, though they did not show the ship's sides. Satellite images of the area showed no visible smoke.\n\nThe ministry's SHANA news agency said no ship nor any authority in the area responded to its distress messages.\n\nForeign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi described the incident Friday as an 'attack' carried out by those committing 'dangerous adventurism.' In a statement, Mousavi said the Sabiti was struck twice in the span of a half hour and an investigation was underway.\n\nIranian authorities did not say who they suspected of launching the missiles, suggesting officials were waiting to assess the incident while waiting for a visit by Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan on Saturday.\n\nKhan met Iranian President Hassan Rouhani in September on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly. He also met him on an April visit to Tehran. Khan has been seeking to serve as a go-between for Iran and Saudi Arabia.\n\nLt. Pete Pagano, a spokesman for the U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet overseeing the Mideast, said authorities there were 'aware of reports of this incident,' but declined to comment further.\n\nBenchmark Brent crude oil spiked over 2% in trading Friday before dropping back down under $60 a barrel.\n\nSince May, there have been a series of oil tanker attacks near the Strait of Hormuz, the mouth of the Persian Gulf through which 20% of all oil passes. While Tehran denies being involved, the U.S. Navy says Iran used magnetic mines on the vessels. The Navy released video it said showed Iranian Revolutionary Guard members taking an unexploded mine off one vessel, an incident still not explained by Tehran.\n\nIran meanwhile has shot down a U.S. military surveillance drone and seized several oil tankers amid the heightened tensions.\n\nThe latest assault saw Saudi Arabia's vital oil industry come under a drone-and-cruise-missile attack , halving the kingdom's output. The U.S. has blamed Iran for the attack, something denied by Tehran. Yemen's Houthi rebels, whom the kingdom is fighting in a yearslong war, claimed that assault, though analysts say the missiles used in the attack wouldn't have the range to reach the sites from Yemen.\n\nFriday's incident also renewed questions about safety in the Red Sea, another crucial shipping route. Mousavi said that Iranian tankers have been targeted by 'damaging activities' over recent months in the Red Sea. He did not elaborate.\n\nIn May, an Iranian oil tanker carrying more than 1 million barrels of fuel oil suffered a reported malfunction in the same area as the Sabiti came under attack. The kingdom helped the Happiness 1 reach anchorage off Jiddah, where it was repaired and later left.\n\nIn its analysis Friday, Dryad Maritime said the incident involving the Happiness 1 bore 'the hallmarks of a potential explosive incident.'\n\nIran said in August another oil tanker, the Helm, faced a technical failure while passing through the Red Sea, without elaborating.", "description": "Defense Secretary Mark Esper said the decision followed discussions with the Saudi minister of defense about the country's defensive capabilities.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/19/19601666-0-image-a-16_1570816911159.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
