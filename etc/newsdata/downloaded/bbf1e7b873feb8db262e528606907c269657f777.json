Biden Jr. a familiar face with a reservoir of good will among many black voters \u2014 a man who served two terms as the No. 2 to the first black president, and who begins far ahead in the South Carolina polls. Only now the race also includes two major black candidates, Senators Kamala Harris of California and Cory Booker of New Jersey, as well as another senator, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who is peeling off support on the ideological left.\n\nFaiz Shakir, Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign manager, called the South Carolina challenge \u201csignificant but not insurmountable,\u201d especially if Mr. Sanders performs well in the three preceding states, including Nevada.\n\n\u201cThere is a really great possibility for South Carolina \u2014 I won\u2019t say win \u2014 but I do think cutting margins significantly,\u201d Mr. Shakir said, \u201cparticularly in the African-American community, which I think he will do much better with. That\u2019s the path.\u201d\n\nAfter mostly minimizing South Carolina four years ago, if not seeming to downright disregard it at times, Mr. Sanders has returned with a previously unseen vigor. Once he had declared his candidacy in 2015, Mr. Sanders went more than three months before his first visit to South Carolina (one trip was postponed after the Charleston church shooting). This year, he has already visited seven times as a candidate; by this weekend, when Mr. Sanders visits on a college tour, he will have notched as many visits to the state as he made in the 2016 cycle.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to give the vice president a run for his money,\u201d said Nina Turner, a national co-chair of the Sanders campaign, who is black and who has been instrumental in the South Carolina strategy, visiting the state herself at least twice a month.\n\nMr. Sanders has unveiled two of his major policy proposals in South Carolina \u2014 his criminal justice plan and his \u201cThurgood Marshall Plan\u201d for public education \u2014 as part of an effort to show his commitment to black voters in the state, advisers said. He has six offices here and 52 paid staff members (nearly three-quarters are people of color, according to the campaign).\n\nA Sanders spokesman in South Carolina, Michael Wukela, said the Vermont senator now counts 24 endorsements in the state \u2014 20 of them from black supporters \u2014 compared with a total of only five at the end of the 2016 race. Members of the clergy are being wooed, as well.", "description": "The state, where black voters dominate the Democratic electorate, delivered a huge setback to Mr. Sanders in early 2016. He knows things need to be different this time.", "authors": ["Sydney Ember", "Shane Goldmacher"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/18/us/politics/18sanders-southcarolina-01/18sanders-southcarolina-01-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
