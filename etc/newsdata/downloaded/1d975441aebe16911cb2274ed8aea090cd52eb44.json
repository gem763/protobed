It has since been updated to include the most relevant information available.]\n\nWhen most investors hunt for dividend stocks, the technology sector is often not on their shopping list. The perception is that most technology firms need and are forced to plow every extra cent back into their businesses in order to fuel growth. As a result, tech stocks are seen as a strictly capital appreciation element for a portfolio.\n\nHowever, this isn\u2019t true at all. Tech stocks make for amazing dividend stocks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe reality is, that many firms in the tech sector are cash flow and profit machines. Thanks to surging revenues and high margins, mature tech firms simply mint money at this point. So much, in fact, that many have too much money sitting on their balance sheets. To rid themselves of that excess cash, many tech stocks have started paying some hefty dividends. And they have been growing those dividends by leaps and bounds too.\n\nIn the end, when looking for dividend stocks, the technology sector should be the first stop for portfolios rather than an afterthought. But which tech stocks have what it takes to be considered good dividend stocks as well?\n\nHere are five that are worthy of consideration.\n\n\n\n\n\nCisco (CSCO)\n\nThe Best Spot to Buy Cisco Stock More\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nDividend Yield: 2.8%\n\nNo list of dividend stocks in the tech sector can be written without the firm that started the modern trend of payouts from tech. We\u2019re talking about Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO). CSCO started paying a token dividend back in 2011 and hasn\u2019t looked back, growing that payout by more than 480%. And it\u2019s easy to see why Cisco has become such a dividend stalwart.\n\nSensing a slowdown in networking, router and physical equipment sales, CSCO started to pivot into more software and services. Cloud computing, cybersecurity and other such products have quickly become big-time money makers for the firm. Perhaps, more importantly, these sales come with higher margins, reoccurrence and the ability to add value/upsell networking transactions. \u201cWe just built you this massive network for your cloud operations. Would you like us to secure it as well?\u201d\n\nBecause of this, CSCO has become a cash flow giant.In fiscal Q3 alone, the firm managed to generate a 16% jump in operating cash flows once adjusting to overseas taxes paid for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Meanwhile, cash on CSCO\u2019s balance sheet has swelled to more than $34.6 billion.\n\nWith sales of software/services continuing to rise, CSCO should be able to keep bringing in the cash for the long haul. Even better is that the growth in data centers and 5G networking is once again boosting equipment sales.\n\nAt the end of the day, Cisco is one of the best dividend stocks to buy \u2014 tech sector or not.\n\n\n\n\n\nSeagate Technology (STX)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nDividend Yield: 4.5%\n\nLike previously mentioned Cisco, Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) may seem like a relic from the dot-com days. However, STX has managed to see plenty of new life in recent years. The key is data center demand is making one heck of a dividend stock.\n\nFor many years after the dot-com bust, STX struggled. The rise of mobile and tablet computing crimped PC sales. At the same time, flash-based solid-state drives (SSD) hit Seagate\u2019s platter-based hard disk drives (HDDs) right in the wallet. SSDs are faster, smaller, and more power-efficient. Manufacturers liked these facts and started favoring them in PCS and other devices. As a result, STX stocks stagnated and was looking like a lost cause.", "description": "[Editor's note: \"5 Great Dividend Stocks to Buy From the Tech Sector\" was previously published in June 2019.
