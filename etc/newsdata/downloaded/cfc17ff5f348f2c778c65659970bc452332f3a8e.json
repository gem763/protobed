The days of closed-door drama without any sign of charges could indicate that prosecutors have encountered an unexpected snafu.\n\nIn an email dated Thursday, Mr. McCabe\u2019s attorney, Michael Bromwich, asked the U.S. Attorney in Washington, Jessie Liu, to confirm Mr. McCabe\u2019s status, saying he had spoken to the prosecutors involved in the case, Joseph Cooney and Molly Gaston, earlier Thursday.\n\n\u201cAt a minimum, based on our discussion with Mr. Cooney and Ms. Gaston this afternoon, it is clear that no indictment has been returned,\u201d Mr. Bromwich wrote.\n\nA DOJ spokeswoman declined to comment.\n\nMr. McCabe had been under federal criminal investigation since the Justice Department\u2019s internal watchdog concluded last year that he misled investigators about his role in providing information in October 2016 to a Wall Street Journal reporter. Mr. McCabe has long disputed the allegations. He was fired from his job in March 2018 just a day before he was eligible to retire with full benefits.\n\nProsecutors had presented the case to a grand jury in Washington this past week, according to people familiar with the matter. At least 12 members of the jury\u2014which can range from 16 to 23 people\u2014must vote in favor of an indictment in order for it to be returned. It is extremely rare for a grand jury to decline an indictment sought by prosecutors because it only hears the government\u2019s version of events and doesn\u2019t require unanimity. A common joke in the legal profession is that a grand jury would indict a ham sandwich, if asked.\n\nMr. McCabe\u2019s legal team argued that if a grand jury rejected the case, there is no way a trial jury, with a much higher burden of proof, would find the former Federal Bureau of Investigation deputy director guilty.\n\n\u201cIf the grand jury voted not to approve charges, it did not find probable cause. Therefore, it is simply not reasonable to believe that a trial jury would find Mr. McCabe guilty of any charges employing a far more rigorous and exacting standard\u2014beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d Mr. Bromwich wrote.\n\nThe Washington Post reported Thursday that the grand jury had been released Thursday with no immediate signs of an indictment.\n\nThe investigation centered on Mr. McCabe\u2019s comments to FBI inspections division agents on May 9, 2017, and later interviews with the inspector general\u2019s office. In those interviews, Mr. McCabe allegedly said he didn\u2019t know who had told the Journal about a phone call he had with a senior Justice Department official in 2016 about an investigation into the Clinton Foundation, even though he had authorized his lawyer to provide the information. Mr. McCabe has said he never deliberately misled investigators and cited the \u201cchaos\u201d of that day, which is when Mr. Trump fired James Comey as FBI director, making Mr. McCabe the bureau\u2019s acting director.\n\nMr. McCabe sued the Justice Department last month, saying his termination was unlawful and part of a plot to remove law-enforcement officials deemed insufficiently loyal to Mr. Trump.\n\nThe case also comes just days after former White House counsel Greg Craig was acquitted of a false-statement charge brought by the same U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Washington.\n\nProsecutors in that office had recommended indicting Mr. McCabe, and his legal team in recent weeks met with the deputy attorney general to try to convince him otherwise. On Thursday, the deputy attorney general\u2019s office notified Mr. McCabe\u2019s attorneys that it had rejected their arguments, clearing the way for a possible indictment.\n\nWrite to Aruna Viswanatha at Aruna.Viswanatha@wsj.com and Byron Tau at byron.tau@wsj.com", "description": "Andrew McCabe hasn\u2019t been indicted for allegedly lying to federal investigators, according to an email from his attorney, in a sign that the case against the FBI\u2019s former No. 2 official may be in jeopardy.", "authors": ["Aruna Viswanatha", "Byron Tau", "Aruna.Viswanatha Wsj.Com", "Byron.Tau Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-97215/social", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
