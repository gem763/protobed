Jim Jordan (R-OH) and Mark Meadows (R-NC) endorsed Montana state auditor Matt Rosendale Tuesday for Congress.\n\nHouse GOP Leader endorsed Rosendale for Congress, contending that he will \u201cstop the socialist surge in Washington.\u201d\n\nMcCarthy said in a press release Tuesday:\n\nMatt Rosendale has proven his effectiveness as a conservative leader who puts Montana first. In Big Sky Country he is doing the hard work to build a winning campaign. In Congress, he will stand with conservatives to stop the socialist surge in Washington, advance President Trump\u2019s agenda, and Keep America Great.\n\nHouse Oversight and Reform Ranking Member Jordan said, \u201cMatt Rosendale is a tireless fighter for freedom and liberty, a principled conservative focused on delivering results for Montanans and reducing government overreach.\u201d\n\nFormer House Freedom Caucus Chairman Meadows said:\n\nI\u2019ve grown to know Matt and one thing is clear: He is a true advocate for Montana. From taking on the high cost of prescription drugs to expanding access and lowering costs for health care to reducing government waste, Matt\u2019s exactly who you want working for you back in Washington, D.C. If he can produce these types of results in Montana, then I\u2019m confident he\u2019ll do the same in Washington. I\u2019m proud to support Matt Rosendale to be Montana\u2019s next Congressman.\n\nRosendale thanked the three conservatives for backing his campaign and called the endorsements a vote of confidence for his congressional campaign.\n\nThe Montana conservative said, \u201cWe clearly have momentum on our side, but to win, a candidate must also have a strong network of support.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese three leaders are the front line of defense between President Trump and Nancy Pelosi\u2019s impeachment- hungry radicals. I am honored to have earned their support,\u201d he added.\n\nMontana state auditor Matt Rosendale also announced Tuesday that he has raised $450,000 during the third-quarter for Montana\u2019s congressional race. Rosendale\u2019s fundraising announcement Tuesday now brings his cash-on-hand figure to nearly $660,000.\n\n\u201cI am honored and humbled to have such strong support across Montana and around the country,\u201d Rosendale said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cMy commitment to serving the people of Montana has never been stronger. As your Congressman, I pledge to always listen, to represent our Montana values, and to always defend our way of life.\u201d", "description": "Kevin McCarthy, Jim Jordan, and Mark Meadows endorsed Montana state auditor Matt Rosendale Tuesday for Congress.", "authors": ["Sean Moran"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Rosendale-and-Trump-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
