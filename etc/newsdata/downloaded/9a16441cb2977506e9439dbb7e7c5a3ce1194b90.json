One told Reuters the idea of a change in government was \"starting to mature\". \"But it is not there yet. Not everyone is at the same state of emergency,\" the source said.\n\n\"The street is imposing its rhythm on the political class, the political class has to be dynamic with it. It is a standoff \u2013 who will concede first?\" the source said.\n\nLebanon's unrest is the latest in a flare-up of political protests around the world - from Hong Kong and Barcelona to Quito and Santiago - each having its own trigger but sharing some underlying frustrations.\n\nLebanese army troops scuffled with demonstrators on Wednesday as they struggled to unblock main roads.\n\nParliament Speaker Nabih Berri, a Shi'ite Muslim, said Lebanon could not remain in such chaos and said he feared any power vacuum.\n\n\"Everything the political class is doing now is clearly to buy time ... the reform list is a lie. Today the demand is for the government to fall,\" said Manal Ghanem, a protester at a barricade in Beirut.\n\n\"We want to get an interim government that holds early elections ... We need to stay strong, to stay in the streets,\" said Ms Ghanem, a university graduate who works in a coffee shop.\n\nLebanon's economy, whose mainstays include construction and tourism, has suffered years of low growth linked to regional turmoil. Capital inflows from abroad, critical to financing the state deficit, have ebbed.\n\nLebanon has one of the world's highest levels of public debt compared to the size of its economy at around 150 per cent.\n\nThe powerful Shi'ite group Hezbollah, which is backed by Iran and heavily armed, said on Saturday it was against the government resigning and the country did not have enough time for such a move given the acute financial crisis.\n\nThe moves announced by Mr Hariri on Monday included the halving of salaries of ministers and lawmakers, as well as steps toward implementing long-delayed measures vital to fixing state finances.\n\nUnder pressure to convince foreign donors he can slash next year's budget deficit, Mr Hariri has said the central bank and commercial banks would contribute US$3.4 billion to help plug the gap, including through an increase in taxes on bank profits.\n\nMr Hariri met Central Bank Governor Riad Salameh on Wednesday following his return from Washington, where the governor attended International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank meetings. He also met a delegation from the Association of Banks in Lebanon.\n\nREUTERS", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Government & Economy - [BEIRUT] Lebanon's highest Christian authority called on Wednesday for a change in government to include qualified technocrats and urged the president to begin talks to address demands of demonstrators in the streets for a seventh day. .
