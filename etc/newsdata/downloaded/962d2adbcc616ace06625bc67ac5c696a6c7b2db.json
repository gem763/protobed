Seemingly contrary to every stance he\u2019s previously taken in his career, James essentially said Morey should have minded his own business and thought about the ramifications of his tweets before sending them.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to get into a [verbal] feud with Daryl Morey, but I believe he wasn\u2019t educated on the situation at hand, and he spoke,\u201d James said before a preseason game. \u201cAnd so many people could have been harmed, not only financially, [but] physically, emotionally, spiritually.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n\u201cSo just be careful what we tweet and say and we do, even though, yes, we do have freedom of speech, but there can be a lot of negative that comes with that, too.\u201d\n\nHis comments, of course, immediately blew up. Even more so than those of his NBA colleagues, like Steve Kerr, who had previously opted for extended explanations of why they would not comment.\n\nThough James took to Twitter Monday night to clarify his statements, he was asked during media availability Tuesday about his response to the backlash. James doubled down on his previous take, in part, and also suggested he is better suited to comment on more local issues.\n\nI asked LeBron James on his response to the criticism on not speaking out on a freedom of speech/human rights issue.

I think when an issue comes up, if you feel passionate about it, and it\u2019s something you want to talk about, then so be it,\u201d James said. \u201cI also don\u2019t think that every issue should be everybody\u2019s problem, as well.\u201d\n\nHe went on to discuss the work he\u2019s passionate about in his own community, like his \u201cI Promise\u201d school.\n\nJames continued: \u201cThere\u2019s issues all over the world, and I think the best thing we can do is \u2014 if you feel passionate about it, talk about it. If you don\u2019t have a lot of knowledge about, or you don\u2019t quite understand it, I don\u2019t think you should talk about it, because it just puts you in a tough position.\u201d\n\nDaryl Morey commented on a subject about which he was passionate, as James suggested people generally should. Which part of the issue Morey did not understand \u2014 beyond the potential financial cost to the NBA and its stars \u2014 remains to be seen.\n\nLeBron James continued to take a questionable stance on Daryl Morey's infamous tweets Tuesday.
