The blackout \u2014 the largest in the state\u2019s history \u2014 is a preventive measure as California\u2019s dry climate and sharp winds begin to spell the onset of wildfire season.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPG&E is anticipating widespread, strong and dry winds this week. Starting Wednesday, they are considering turning off... Posted by Pleasanton Police Department on Tuesday, October 8, 2019\n\nThe outage comes as PG&E faces massive liabilities for starting the fire that killed 85 people and destroyed the town of Paradise last year. The measure has upset customers, who have been forced to close schools and make accommodations for the things in their lives that need electricity, such as refrigerated medicine.\n\nBut in Pleasanton, the police department chose to add some levity to a serious matter.\n\nThe text that accompanied their outage \u201cmap\u201d was useful, yet darkly humorous.\n\n\u201cIf you come home and everything is dark and nothing works, then yes, you are experiencing a power shutdown,\u201d read one tip. \u201cRemain calm. Use your cell phone light to search frantically for the one flashlight you think you have in the house. It will be dead of course. Search for batteries. You will need four but only find three.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRead another: \u201cCheck on your neighbors. Even the one whose dog barks all night. And the other one who always parks in front of your house.\"\n\nAnd there were several digs at teenagers:\n\n\u201cCharge up those portable phone chargers tonight,\u201d the post said. \u201cHowever, keep in mind, should your teen\u2019s phone run out of battery it could be a good thing. Watching them go through Tik-Tok or Instagram withdrawals could be good entertainment. Heck, it could even put them dangerously close to having to read a book by flashlight or doing something creative.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, authorities reported that a bullet was fired at one of the company\u2019s vehicles and said a threatening letter was found at a PG&E facility. The energy company called on the public to let its employees do their jobs over the next several days.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe realize and understand the impact and the hardship as the result of this decision that we\u2019ve made,\u201d Sumeet Singh, vice president of PG&E\u2019s Community Wildfire Safety Program, said at a news conference Wednesday.\n\nPG&E employees and contractors \u201chave families that live in your communities,\u201d Singh reminded the affected customers. \u201cThey have friends that are members of your communities.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo let\u2019s just ensure their safety as well, as they are doing this work in the interest of your safety,\u201d Singh said.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "The PG&E outage is the largest in California's history.", "authors": ["Katie Mettler", "Reporter Covering Breaking News"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/_wDRR6NvSETzVKxyxjP-4KUaSwI=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4G6JAPVEBBB77L7FKG5RIR6EBU.JPG", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
