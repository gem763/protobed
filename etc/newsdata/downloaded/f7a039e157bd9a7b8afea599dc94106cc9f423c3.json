REUTERS/Lucas Jackson/File Photo\n\nMacron had been trying over the past few weeks to defuse tensions between Washington and Tehran, which spiked after a Sept. 14 attack on Saudi oil facilities that Saudi Arabia, the United States and Europe blamed on Iran. Tehran has denied involvement.\n\nThe French president went to a Midtown Manhattan pizza restaurant last Tuesday night for dinner - before he was due to head to New York\u2019s John F. Kennedy airport - and a French diplomatic source said it was there that he \u201cdecided to give things one more try: get the two sides to talk on the phone.\u201d\n\nIt would be a final push to cap Macron\u2019s two days of shuttle diplomacy in New York between Trump and Rouhani. Macron, who has been trying to salvage the Iran nuclear deal despite Washington\u2019s withdrawal, had told reporters just before dinner that he believed conditions were in place for Trump and Rouhani to talk.\n\nSources familiar with the situation, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Trump agreed to a phone call. Trump had planned to reiterate, however, that he would not lift sanctions on Iran, one source said.\n\nA message was sent to Rouhani that Macron wanted to see him, the sources said, but when Rouhani was told that there had been no agreement by Washington to lift sanctions, Rouhani declined to meet Macron. The sanctions have crippled Iran\u2019s economy and cut off its oil exports.\n\nThe French president showed up anyway at Rouhani\u2019s hotel opposite U.N. headquarters, the sources said, and a secure phone line was set up in one of the rooms on Rouhani\u2019s floor.\n\n\u201cIf the Iranians hadn\u2019t wanted the call, they wouldn\u2019t have let us install the secure line,\u201d said the French diplomatic source, adding that Macron did not see Rouhani at the hotel that night \u201cbecause Rouhani didn\u2019t take the call.\u201d\n\nInstead Macron spoke to Trump on the secure phone line, the source said, \u201cto say thank you for being available.\u201d\n\nMacron\u2019s attempt to broker a phone call between Trump and Rouhani was first reported by the New Yorker.\n\nPAST MEETING REQUESTS\n\nBefore the attacks on the Saudi oil facilities, France had proposed offering Iran about $15 billion in credit lines until year-end if Tehran came fully back into compliance with its 2015 nuclear deal. That would have depended on Washington easing some sanctions.\n\nIran has repeatedly said it will not talk to the United States unless Washington lifts sanctions on the country and returns to the deal that curbed Tehran\u2019s nuclear program in exchange for the removal of U.N., U.S. and European sanctions.\n\nTrump quit the nuclear deal last year - negotiated under his predecessor, Barack Obama - and reimposed sanctions, demanding Tehran negotiate a broader pact that halts its ballistic missile work and end its support for proxy forces in the Middle East.\n\nObama and Rouhani spoke by telephone in 2013, the highest-level contact between the two countries in three decades.\n\nBefore Macron\u2019s last-minute attempt to broker a phone call between Trump and Rouhani, Trump had told the U.N. General Assembly: \u201cNo responsible government should subsidize Iran\u2019s bloodlust. As long as Iran\u2019s menacing behavior continues, sanctions will not be lifted; they will be tightened.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, Rouhani addressed the 193-member world body. In a veiled swipe at Trump\u2019s three public meetings with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un amid much fanfare, Rouhani said such photo opportunities should be the last stop in a negotiation, not the first.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nHe said: \u201cOur response to talks under pressure is NO.\u201d\n\nIranian authorities have said Tehran rejected eight U.S. requests for a meeting between Trump and Rouhani on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly meeting in September 2017.\n\nAt the United Nations last year, Trump posted on Twitter that \u201cdespite requests,\u201d he had no plans to meet Rouhani, adding: \u201cMaybe someday in the future.\u201d", "description": "Before leaving New York last week, French President Emmanuel Macron made a failed last-minute push to get U.S. President Donald Trump and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani to speak on the sidelines of the annual U.N. gathering of world leaders, according to several sources familiar with the situation.", "authors": ["Marine Pennetier", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191001&t=2&i=1436024318&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF903IT", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
