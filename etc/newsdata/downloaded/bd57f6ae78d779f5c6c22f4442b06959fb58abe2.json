Yes, she knows that the defense world and Capitol Hill are male-dominated\u2014she\u2019s worked as a chief of staff for a member of Congress and, now serves as the top lobbyist for the Department of Defense.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cSomebody said to me the other day, like, \u2018You could be the first female blah-de-blah.\u2019 And I would like to get to a point where we just don\u2019t say that you could be the \u2018first female\u2019 whatever anymore,\u201d Jones Miller said during an interview for POLITICO\u2019s Women Rule podcast.\n\nAs a 20-something aide on Capitol Hill, Jones Miller worked on national defense issues. She remembers when it felt like to walk into a committee room filled almost exclusively with men.\n\n\u201cI felt it, I was aware of it, but I never felt different [or] that I was treated differently,\u201d said Jones Miller.\n\nIt's the same thing today, even though she has much more responsibility and a complicatedly long title (principal deputy assistant secretary of Defense for legislative affairs).\n\n\u201cI will walk into a room and I am generally one of the youngest and certainly one of the only women in the room. And I observe it, but I am not made to feel that way.\u201d\n\nThat awareness, that observation, comes with a sense of responsibility.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re in the room and you\u2019re at the table and you\u2019re the only woman, it\u2019s hard not to feel the burden of every other woman to perform for them. And so, I do feel that,\u201d said Jones Miller. \u201cYes, I know I belong at the table; I know I\u2019m supposed to be in the room; I know my stuff; I\u2019m prepared; I will outwork anybody. But I still feel that: \u2018Okay, well, people are going to judge this entire class of people on me and my performance.\u2019\u201d\n\nJones Miller considers that performance carefully.\n\nA former college basketball player, she\u2019s roughly six feet tall. \u201cI take advantage of that,\u201d Jones Miller said. \u201cThere are days when I will put on the two- or three-inch heels, because I know that I would like to dominate a space, and I am not afraid of that. I think we all need to figure out what our super-powers are and use them.\u201d\n\nBut as anyone who has read \u201cSpider-Man\u201d comics\u2014or has even a peripheral knowledge of stories about people with super-powers\u2014will tell you, with great power comes great responsibility.\n\n\u201cI think that we\u2019ve got to celebrate\u2014yes, women are taking on these roles. But I think we also then have the obligation to hold the door open for someone else to come through,\u201d said Jones Miller. \u201cThat, to me, is the next step.\u201d\n\nTo hear more from Jamie Jones Miller, listen to the full podcast here.
