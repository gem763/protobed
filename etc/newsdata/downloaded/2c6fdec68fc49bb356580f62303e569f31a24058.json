Currently, the onus is on the commission to prove their firms\u2019 behaviour harms competition. The change would only apply in certain cases, and the commissioner stressed that it\u2019s one of several proposals under consideration. (Financial Times)\n\nTalking point: Vestager has emphasized that the commission must look beyond fines to rein in the allegedly anti-competitive activity of tech giants like Google and Facebook, arguing that even record-breaking fines\u2014like her US$5-billion penalty against Google in 2018\u2014are inadequate corrective measures. This is the latest sign that the commissioner is looking beyond punitive measures and moving toward broad changes in the way antitrust cases are conducted. If the commission adopts this proposal, it would trigger a fundamental shift in the way these cases play out. Meanwhile, a new study found that nearly half of new legislative proposals for tech companies in the first half of 2019 came out of Europe, strengthening the bloc\u2019s emerging reputation as a global leader in regulating the sector.", "description": "", "authors": ["Liza Agrba"], "top_image": "https://thelogic.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/WP_Logo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
