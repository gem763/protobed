It was a way of life.\u201d\n\nA couple of days later we head north to the Giant\u2019s Causeway, an ancient geological extravaganza of 40,000 volcanic basalt formations on the north coast, before travelling to the city of Derry.\n\nRonan McNamara, our local guide, invites us to take a stroll along the thick stone walls that encircle the historic city. This is where the Protestant \u201capprentice boys\u201d defended the city from troops loyal to Catholic King James II in the Siege of Derry in 1689. The wall also gives visitors a lofty view of the Bogside, where 14 unarmed civilians were gunned down by British soldiers in the infamous 1972 Bloody Sunday massacre.\n\nA wall mural commemorating the 1972 Bloody Sunday massacre in Derry. Nick Miller\n\nBorn to an Irish father and Chinese mother, McNamara began taking tours 20 years ago when British soldiers still patrolled the streets. He likes to describe himself as the only Buddhist in town and dreams of a different kind of future for his kids. \u201cThere is a whole generation that has not grown up with the conflict. But for anybody who is my age or over, the scars are still there,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have children going to Catholic and Protestant schools, we have people living in segregated areas. We need to bring the children together.\u201d\n\nOne fear both sides of the border share today is the impact of Brexit. There have already been isolated acts of violence and there are fears it will spiral if a hard border returns. In April, journalist Lyra McKee was shot dead by dissident republicans in Derry and a bomb linked to the New IRA was found in Derry in September.\n\nFigures show Brexit has disrupted tourism, but in the height of an Irish summer, no one seems too worried.\n\nFor now, the only way to tell you are entering the Republic of Ireland is the emergence of Gaelic signs along the highway. Once in Dublin, I notice most tourists seem oblivious to rising Brexit tensions. The figures show Brexit has disrupted tourism, as fewer English are visiting Ireland. But in the height of an Irish summer, no one seems too worried.\n\nTourists are out in force at all Dublin\u2019s popular sites, scanning the Georgian architecture and searching for deer in the vast Phoenix Park where Pope Francis celebrated Mass with thousands in 2018.\n\nA queue of visitors snakes around Trinity College waiting to see the Book of Kells, one of the world\u2019s oldest manuscripts, and tours are sold out at Kilmainham Gaol, once a transit point for doomed Irish rebels and impoverished criminals who were shipped off to Australia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the rowdy Temple Bar neighbourhood, the pubs are overflowing. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to fit in here and visitors seem to like that,\u201d an Irish friend tells me. \u201cEven if you don\u2019t speak much English, you may be adopted by a group of Irish having some craic [fun] of an evening.\u201d\n\nAmong the city\u2019s treasures are the \u201cbog bodies\u201d at the National Museum of Ireland. They date back to the Stone Age and were miraculously preserved by the peat. The oldest, \u201cCashel Man\u201d, was discovered by a farmer in County Laois in 2011 and dates back to 2000 BC.\n\nDame Lane in Temple Bar, Dublin's traditional nightlife hub and source of good \"craic\". Tourism Ireland\n\nIn Dublin we stay at the Dylan Hotel, a contemporary five-star hotel in a leafy neighbourhood just south of the centre. After two nights, we\u2019re back on the coach. Dublin\u2019s city limits soon dissolve into lush countryside that literally brushes past the windows as our driver navigates ridiculously narrow roads better suited to a horse and carriage.\n\nWe have a dozen towns and villages to pick off over the remaining week as we circle the south of the country in our lovely coach, which is usually filled with the sounds of fiddles and flutes as we gaze at rugged cliffs and a prehistoric landscape.\n\nTales are told of Celtic paganism, Viking invasions and the determination of the early Christians to spread the word of God. Saint Kevin made his name in the sixth century in Glendalough, south of Dublin, where he founded a monastic settlement. The ruins are wedged between two lakes and magical hiking trails that stretch for kilometres through Wicklow. (The reclusive Oscar-winning actor Daniel Day-Lewis lives nearby.)\n\nFurther south, centuries-old castles await us in Kilkenny and Blarney, where the legendary gift of the gab is sealed with a kiss of the famous stone and the sweater shop is doing a roaring trade with those who can\u2019t be bothered queuing.\n\nHurling \"appears to combine rugby and field hockey to produce one of the world's toughest sports\".\n\nWhen we reach Kilkenny, we discover Tipperary has just defeated the local hurling team in the national final. Hurling is an ancient game that appears to combine rugby and field hockey to produce one of the toughest sports in the world. Colourful flags of rival teams are unfurled from the windows of towns and villages, and kids swagger through the streets with their hurling sticks.\n\nFrom hurling to thoroughbreds. More than a century ago, Lady Helen McCalmont and her husband bred champion racehorses in Ballylinch, south of Kilkenny. The Ballylinch Stud continues the tradition and next to it is the Mount Juliet Estate, which has been converted into an elegant hotel with a world-class golf course, designed by Jack Nicklaus.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Michelin-star restaurant, named in Lady Helen\u2019s honour, serves mouth-watering Irish pork crubeens (pig\u2019s trotters) with foie gras, potato and truffle ravioli, fresh cod and fillet of beef, as well as tiramisu and award-winning Irish cheeses. \u201cIt\u2019s more than a meal, it\u2019s an experience,\u201d says chef John Kelly. \u201cOur food is seasonal. Soon we\u2019ll have venison, mandarins instead of strawberries and red mullet to replace the cod.\u201d\n\nThe Bank House bed and breakfast in Sneem.\n\nFrom gastronomy, it\u2019s soon back to the scenery. A couple of days later, in the country\u2019s south-west, the Ring of Kerry easily earns its place among the most spectacular of Ireland\u2019s many beautiful natural assets. There\u2019s a selfie-snapping frenzy at Ladies View, a vantage point that offers views across a panoramic valley that\u2019s too big to fit inside the lens. Here, remnants of ancient Stone Age settlements mingle with black-faced sheep and cows.\n\nWhen we roll into the village of Sneem (population: 557), Noel and Margaret Harrington throw open the doors of their brightly painted home, Bank House. Margaret\u2019s ancestors built the house more than 200 years ago, but it earned its name when itinerant tellers from the Bank of Ireland served their clients here.\n\nSandwiches are already on the table, a secret blend of tea is served and hot scones emerge from the oven accompanied by clotted cream and jam as we all settle in. \u201cWe want to welcome you all to our home,\u201d says Noel Harrington with a theatrical flourish. \u201cThis is our house; it is the oldest home in Sneem.\u201d\n\nHarrington knows how to put on a show. His three-storeyed home is also a bed and breakfast which once hosted legendary Irish actress Maureen O\u2019Hara, who he knew as a child. \u201cShe always said I was the son she never had, but somehow she left me out of her will,\u201d he chuckles.\n\nBack on the road, coaches and cars zigzag around the dramatic coastline, appropriately dubbed the Wild Atlantic Way. Icy cold waves crash against the rugged cliffs of the Dingle Peninsula, celebrated in the film classic Ryan\u2019s Daughter, while the Cliffs of Moher, one of the country\u2019s top tourist attractions, drop 200 metres into the sea.\n\nA roadside picnic on Dingle Peninsula \u2013 the location for the classic 1970 film \"Ryan\u2019s Daughter\". Tourism Ireland\n\nOur journey finally ends with a bagpiper\u2019s mournful welcome and (yet another) gourmet experience, this time at the luxurious 800-year-old Ashford Castle on Lough Corrib, north of Galway.\n\nThis exquisite hotel has hosted princes, presidents and the Hollywood A-list. Beyond its oak-panelled walls and Waterford chandeliers, it\u2019s hard to imagine an Ireland mired in the poverty and deprivation that forced so many to seek an uncertain future abroad.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe country was reinvented as the \u201cCeltic Tiger\u201d and its membership of the European Union in 1973 opened new doors. Now, with Brexit looming and concern over the \u201chard\u201d Irish border, many fear how that future will look.\n\n\u201cThis is going to be very bad for Ireland,\u201d Noel Harrington told us back in Sneem, where he also rents a vacation property. \u201cA lot of my clients were English and they did not come this year. I think Brexit has a lot to do with it, the English are afraid to travel.\u201d\n\nIn keeping with the finest Irish tradition, Harrington says dialogue is the only solution. \u201cThese government ministers need to get together with a big pot of coffee and say \u2018Look at Ireland, little Ireland \u2013 let\u2019s look after them.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe writer was a guest of Luxury Gold.\n\nAt a glance\n\nHow many people were on the tour? Twenty-one, but the coach can take up to 40. Our concierge made life on board a breeze.\n\nLively or contemplative group? Definitely fun! Mainly Australians, New Zealanders, Americans, Canadians and Malaysians. We had organised meals as a group, broke into smaller groups spontaneously for some dinners and also did our own thing.\n\nWhat was the coach like? Plenty of leg room, plus the seats reclined. Excellent Wi-Fi and a toilet on board.\n\nHighlight of the tour? Margaret\u2019s homemade scones in Sneem. Another great find was the Cupan Tae tearoom in Galway.\n\nRead, watch, listen Sally Rooney\u2019s Normal People and I Never Knew That About Ireland by Christopher Winn; the TV series Derry Girls; The Storm by folk-rockers Moving Hearts.\n\nWho would this tour appeal to? Professionals, self-starters, food lovers and history buffs aged 45-plus who want to travel in style while someone else handles the map.\n\nOK, take me there Luxury Gold\u2019s 12-day Ultimate Ireland guided holiday is priced from $8995 per person, twin share, and the 2020 season runs from May to October.
