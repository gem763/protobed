Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nThe new survey, conducted by the Saint Anselm College Survey Center and released Tuesday, also shows Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont \u2013 who crushed eventual nominee Hillary Clinton in the 2016 New Hampshire primary \u2013 in a distant third place.\n\nWarren, the populist senator who\u2019s pushed out one progressive policy proposal after another, stands at 25 percent in the survey. Biden, the front-runner in most polls of voters nationwide and in early primary and caucus states since before announced his candidacy in late April, is at 24 percent. The margin between Warren and Biden is well within the poll's margin of error of 4.8 percentage points.\n\nWARREN EDGES BIDEN, SANDERS SLIPS, IN NEW NH PRIMARY POLL\n\n\u201cThere remain several months before New Hampshire Democrats cast their primary ballots, but Warren and Biden have clearly separated themselves from the rest of the field,\u201d New Hampshire Institute of Politics executive director Neil Levesque emphasized.\n\n\u201cIf the dynamic of Warren as the candidate that best expresses Democratic voters\u2019 policy preferences and Biden as the one who has the best chance of beating Trump sets in with voters, this is likely turning into a two-person race absent a big shake-up,\u201d he added.\n\nSanders, the populist independent senator, stands at 11 percent in the survey, with South Bend, Ind. Mayor Buttigieg a point back at 10 percent. Sen. Kamala Harris of California registers at 5 percent in the survey to round out the top five.\n\nThe poll\u2019s release comes hours after Sanders reported raising a whopping $25.3 million during the July-September third quarter of fundraising, with Buttigieg hauling in $19.1 million and Harris bringing in $11.6 million.\n\nSANDERS HAULS IN AN EYE-POPPING $25 MILLION JULY-SEPT. CAMPAIGN CASH HAUL\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii are each at 3 percent in the survey. Businessman and billionaire environmental and progressive activist Tom Steyer and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang are each at 2 percent, with Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey at 1 percent. Everyone else sampled came in at less than 1 percent, with 9 percent undecided with just over four months to go until primary day.\n\nLevesque highlighted that \u201cthere is still some fluidity in this race, as 65 percent of Warren supporters, 72 percent of Biden supporters, 56 percent of Sanders supporters, and 73 percent of Buttigieg voters indicate that they expect that their choice could change between now and the primary election.\u201d\n\nAmong voters who were not firm in their choice of candidate, was the second choice of 26 percent, followed by Biden (12 percent), Buttigieg (11 percent), Sanders and Harris (7 percent each)\n\nWarren also topped the field of candidates on the question of who would make the best president (27 percent, compared to 19 percent who picked Biden). But Biden came out on top when voters were asked who would be the strongest nominee to take on Republican President Donald Trump in next year\u2019s general election (37 percent, compared to 26 percent who picked Warren).\n\nThe St. Anselm poll came out a week after a Monmouth University survey in New Hampshire grabbed national attention for indicating that Warren and Biden fighting for the top spot, with Sanders a distant third.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nPrevious Granite State polls released earlier in September and in late August were all over the board, with one suggesting Sanders holding a lead; another indicating a three-way tie among Biden, Warren and Sanders; and a third showing Sanders trailing Biden and Warren.\n\nThe Saint Anselm College Survey Center poll was conducted Sept. 25-29, with 423 registered voters in New Hampshire who indicated they were likely to vote in the state\u2019s Democratic presidential primary questioned by live telephone operators.", "description": "For the second straight week, a poll in the New Hampshire Democratic primary race\u00a0shows a\u00a0battle for the top spot between Sen.
