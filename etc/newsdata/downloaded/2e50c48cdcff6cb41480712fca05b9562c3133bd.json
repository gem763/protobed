Mason Mount could miss Sunday\u2019s home game against Liverpool after limping off with an ankle injury and Lampard admitted that his team paid for their lack of ruthlessness.\n\nRoss Barkley\u2019s penalty miss costs Chelsea as Valencia win opener Read more\n\n\u201cI think we created enough in the game,\u201d said the Chelsea manager. \u201cNot lots of fantastic chances, but good chances. Obviously a penalty and we conceded from the one shot on target, so it was a harsh lesson in Champions League football \u2013 a game we played pretty well in and we lose it. The good news is we have five games left in the group.\u201d\n\nChelsea, who were caught out when Rodrigo fired Valencia ahead in the 74th minute, are likely to need positive results when they visit Lille on 2 October and Ajax on 22 October.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the reality of losing a game at home,\u201d Lampard said. \u201cIt makes those games more important, particularly as they come back to back away from home. There are league games in the meantime, but we need a strong focus on those games to try to get a result in one of those two games before we make it really tough for ourselves.\u201d\n\nChelsea 0-1 Valencia: Champions League \u2013 as it happened Read more\n\nThere was confusion when Barkley, who came on for Mateo Kovacic in the second half, appeared to have a debate with Willian and Jorginho about who should take Chelsea\u2019s penalty in the 87th minute after a handball. However Lampard said he was following instructions from the coaching staff.\n\n\u201cRoss is the penalty taker,\u201d Lampard said. \u201cHe was in pre-season and scored a couple. He has been when he started. He was when he came on today and he missed it. That is the clear story. I don\u2019t know what the conversation was, but Jorginho and Willian were the takers on the pitch. When Ross comes on he becomes the penalty taker.\u201d\n\nChelsea are also sweating on Mount\u2019s fitness after the midfielder went off in the 16th minute following a challenge from Francis Coquelin.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know how bad it is,\u201d Lampard said. \u201cWe are going to have to assess it in the next 24 to 48 hours to see the scale of the injury. It\u2019s too soon to say. Obviously it was a shame because he was playing so well and started well.\u201d\n\nLampard also condemned the minority of Chelsea fans who reportedly sang offensive chants about Jews and the travelling community during the first half.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t hear them, but it\u2019s the same message I\u2019ve said quite a few times this season. As a club we have initiatives and we are very clear where we stand on racist chants at this ground or any other ground. I will reiterate that clearly.\u201d", "description": "Chelsea lost 1-0 to Valencia in the Group H opener at Stamford Bridge and the manager defended midfielder Ross Barkley, who missed a late penalty to equalise", "authors": ["Jacob Steinberg"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/678aa3f8f8f377afd0ff1fcf1832026cbeba803b/0_53_1897_1138/master/1897.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a086e6be6c61813b372659eeec74859b", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
