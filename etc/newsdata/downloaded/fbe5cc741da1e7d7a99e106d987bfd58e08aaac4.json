The tool itself also can be shared with friends to increase awareness of preventive care.\n\nMost of the preventive measures recommended by the health groups that Facebook worked with are covered by insurance, but it's important to keep in mind that \"not everybody actually has access to primary care across the country,\" Abnousi said. \"So we also wanted to help in the access logistics.\"\n\nThe Preventive Health tool offers a map of federally qualified health centers nationwide where anyone can go to get certain screenings, tests and other health care services, if they choose. The centers, located in underserved areas, provide services regardless of patients' ability to pay, and charge for services on a sliding fee scale.\n\nWhen it comes to seasonal illnesses, the Preventive Health tool also includes a way to find where flu shots are being offered, such as pharmacies, grocery stores and urgent care clinics.\n\nJUST WATCHED Facebook says that, unlike its past, its future is privacy Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Facebook says that, unlike its past, its future is privacy 01:41\n\nOnly time will tell whether Facebook users actually engage with the tool -- especially since Facebook has recently faced privacy issues, including a hack last year that exposed information on nearly 50 million users of the social network.\n\nYet with the Preventive Health tool, Facebook ensures that it will not have access to users' test results or any other health information. Rather, the tool only provides information on recommendations and where to access care, based on a user's age and sex.\n\n\"Any tests that you have done as a result of engaging with this information are completely outside of us. We don't engage in that or hear about it ever from the health care system,\" Abnousi said. \"Secondly, your use of the Preventive Health tool on Facebook is not visible to any other Facebook users.\"\n\nHe added that personal information about any activity in the Preventive Health tool is not shared with third parties, such as health organizations or insurance companies.\n\nFor some cancer types -- such as cervical, colorectal, lung and breast -- clinical trials have shown that screening to detect cancer early can reduce the risk of dying from that cancer\n\n\"We all know that screening rates for cancer are not as high as they could be,\" Wender said.\n\n\"There's many, many people who've had a cancer death prevented because they've been screened -- but there's so many more who have lost their lives when a screening test might have helped, and so we need new ways to reach the public,\" he said.\n\nThe new Preventive Health tool follows other Facebook public health initiatives launched recently.\n\nIn June, Facebook debuted a blood donation feature in the United States to help users find places to donate blood in their area and be notified when a nearby blood donation may be in need.\n\nIn September, a new feature rolled out on Facebook and Instagram to combat the spread of anti-vaccine misinformation. Facebook, which owns Instagram, launched educational pop-up windows on both platforms that appear when a user searches for vaccine-related content, visits vaccine-related Facebook groups and pages, or taps a vaccine-related hashtag on Instagram.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nIn the future, there is a possibility that the Preventive Health tool could expand to other countries and include more resources on preventive care outside of cardiovascular health, cancer and seasonal illness -- but for now, Abnousi said they want to make sure that the tool as-is reaches an audience.\n\n\"We're going to spend the next six to 12 months really trying to understand whether people are engaging with this tool and whether it's helpful or not,\" he said. \"Once we figure that out is when we're going to start thinking about expansion.\"", "description": "Facebook's new Preventive Health tool focuses specifically on cardiovascular health, cancer screening and seasonal health risks -- making recommendations such as when to get your cholesterol test or where to get a flu shot.", "authors": ["Jacqueline Howard"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191025180246-01-facebook-preventive-health-tool-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
