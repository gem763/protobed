It gave $20 million last year to develop a new metal membrane technology from CSIRO that allows the extraction of pure hydrogen from ammonia.\n\nAlinta chief executive Jeff Dimery said the project would give the whole region a better chance of displacing diesel generation with cleaner and more affordable power.\n\n\u201cBy extending transmission lines in the Pilbara, displacing diesel and backing solar up with gas-fired generation and our innovative big battery at the Newman power station, we will deliver a cleaner, affordable and more connected supply to our customers,\" he said.\n\n\u201cThe Chichester project alone is expected to displace 100 million litres of diesel generation annually from the Pilbara, and we hope that can be increased as others in the region see what we can achieve with Fortescue.\"\n\nSeveral miners have turned to solar to improve the environmental performance of their sites since the first significant Australian project, Sandfire Resources' $40 million off-grid solar and battery project at the DeGrussa copper mine in WA.\n\nFortescue expects the Chichester solar-gas hybrid project to cuts its diesel use at the Christmas Creek and Cloudbreak power stations by about 100 million litres a year.\n\nMs Gaines said reliable and competitive energy generation was a key issue for WA mining industry.\n\n\"As a significant consumer of energy, we continue to identify opportunities that have the potential to lower our costs while also improving our carbon footprint,\" she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNAIF chief executive Laurie Walker said the project, backed by a $90 million NAIF loan, had potential to supply other miners and large off-grid customers in the resources-rich Pilbara.\n\nShe said the gas element compensated for the variability of solar supply and the project paved the way for a more interconnected energy grid in the region, which is home to BHP, Rio Tinto and Hancock Prospecting's Roy Hill iron ore mines.", "description": "The deal with Alinta Energy could be expanded to shift other sites in the Pilbara to solar and gas.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_108/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/0423b47c717e12b96e41ff2b6e62c3c5c1b8d0b7", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
