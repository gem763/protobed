Even though the world is wealthier, the population is growing sicker, PwC noted, with rates of cancer, cardiovascular disease and diabetes all spiking.\n\nBecause health care is focused largely on high costs of services provided, and drugs that treat some of the rarest or more chronic diseases, the report suggested countries could achieve better results by homing in on behavioral factors that would result in a less sickly population.\n\n\u201cCuring disease may seem more within reach than curing the underlying societal challenges of poverty, hunger or unemployment. But the increase in illnesses caused by people\u2019s behaviors and where they live and work could suffocate public and private budgets in both wealthy and poor countries,\u201d PwC\u2019s analysts wrote.\n\n\u201cMore important, our research and work in the field has led us to conclude that it is, in fact, possible to quantify the benefits and investment returns of an alternative approach that targets social factors,\u201d it added.\n\nGoing in the wrong direction\n\nSocial determinants is an increasingly popular phrase in the global discussion about lowering health care costs. The idea centers on environmental factors that influence what people eat \u2014 and where and how they live.\n\nThe movement has found legislative support in the U.S. Congress, which recently introduced a bill calling on Health and Human Services to establish a council to address the issue.\n\nCans of soda are displayed in a case at Kwik Stops Liquor in San Diego, California February 13, 2014.

However, the discussion has yet to gain any real headway in the discussion about America\u2019s health care.\n\n\u201cThings aren\u2019t going in the right direction anymore,\u201d Benjamin Isgur, managing director of PwC's Health Research Institute, told Yahoo Finance.\n\n\u201cThe answer to this is not to throw our hands up,\u201d PwC\u2019s Isgur said. \u201cWe have to step up and say if our purpose is to make people more healthy, then we have to think about revamping the structure and rerouting the money.\u201d\n\nPwC\u2019s study called on stakeholders at various levels within the health ecosystem to collaborate, establishing a data-based framework based on \u201cthe reality of how people live and work.\u201d\n\nThe firm\u2019s study cited findings from England and Australia, where a focus on social factors has generated optimism about health care spending.\n\nThe Atrium example\n\nIn the U.S., a number of pilot research programs have done the same, with Atrium Health, in North Carolina, just one example.\n\nThe hospital system asked the community what they needed in the zip codes they saw the most emergency visits from. From that initiative, Atrium created a \u201cfood pharmacy\u201d by partnering with the largest local food pantry.\n\n\u201cWe engaged at a local and county level,\u201d Alisahah Cole, chief community impact officer at Atrium, told Yahoo Finance in a recent interview.\n\n\n\n\n\nEven with the rise in pilot programs, the movement to emphasize social factors is lacking in data. However, research over decades has shown that \u201cwhat impacts health the most happens outside of clinical walls,\u201d Cole said.\n\n\u201cIt took an entire year to do this work, and talking to patients and community members, private businesses, education partners and non profit partners,\u201d she added. \u201cWe wanted to be intentional about that because we wanted the priorities to come form the community and be community-driven.\u201d", "description": "Health care should address social determinants like income, housing and food in a wide-ranging effort to curb health spending and tackle weight-related illness, according to a new report published on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Anjalee Khemlani", "Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/q0vvZU6ffsLdydUhUPzlBA--~B/aD0yMzM0O3c9MzUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/5aebf9d0-defc-11e9-bfa3-691c1edb2bfb", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
