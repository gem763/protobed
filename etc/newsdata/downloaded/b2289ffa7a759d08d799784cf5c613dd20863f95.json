That certainly would apply to the White House announcement late Sunday that the United States was abandoning its Kurdish allies by pulling U.S. troops out of Northern Syria. And it applies to other actions, foreign and domestic, undertaken by the president.\n\n\u201cThe first reckless act was pulling out of TPP,\u201d Heitkamp said of the Trans-Pacific Partnership in the latest episode of \u201cCape Up.\u201d \u201cThe United States has to lead globally, and how we lead is we lead in multilateral trade agreements.\n\n\u201cYou cannot lead a party of one. The United States has always been a global leader, certainly since World War II. We want to continue to be a global leader,\u201d Heitkamp told me. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean just taking care of yourself, it means taking care of democracies across the world, leading the world to better conditions for everyone, which will lead to better economics in this country.\u201d\n\nI sat down with Heitkamp during the Aspen Ideas Festival in June in Aspen, Colo. She had just launched the \u201cOne Country Project\u201d with former senator Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.), an organization formed to put issues affecting rural voters on the national agenda. And Trump\u2019s recklessness at home has been particularly harmful to rural America.\n\n\n\nFormer senator Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) talks with The Post\u2019s Jonathan Capehart during recording for the \u201cCape Up\u201d podcast at the Aspen Ideas Festival on June 26. (Jonathan Capehart/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s trying to unilaterally dismember the Affordable Care Act, take away your protections on pre-existing conditions, take away your kids on your health insurance.\u2026So health care is a huge issue in rural America, and he\u2019s reckless with people\u2019s health care,\u201d Heitkamp told me. \u201cYou can point to any number of things like his budget, where he dramatically cuts the rural electrification program, where he cuts broadband. So the lifeline that we hope we will receive, which is the ability to attract tech employment, work away from home, the new artificial intelligence work that can be done, that can expand opportunities to rural America if we educate kids for those opportunities, he\u2019s not building the infrastructure to do that.\u201d\n\n[\u201cThe Constitution never envisioned anything like this.\u2019]\n\nListen to the podcast to hear Heitkamp talk about her vote against the confirmation of Justice Brett Kavanaugh and why that cost her her Senate seat in the last midterm election. And she has advice for her fellow Democrats running to defeat the president in the next election.\n\n\u201cDon't be cautious. This is not a time for caution. This isn't a time to parse your words. This is a time to say what you mean, which was what was attractive to many people about Donald Trump,\u201d Heitkamp said. \u201cYou may not like what he says, but, damn, you know what he's thinking. And that's the truth, you do. He's not thinking much, but he's talking a lot.\u201d\n\n\u201cCape Up\u201d is Jonathan\u2019s weekly podcast talking to key figures behind the news and our culture.
