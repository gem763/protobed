(Evan Vucci/AP)\n\nThere\u2019s much criticism of the left when it comes to its perception of President Trump\u2019s supporters. But a recent column from a prominent pundit is a reminder of how many in the media \u2014 including conservatives \u2014 seem to misunderstand both Trump voters and Middle America.\n\nIn his New York Times column \u201cWhy Trump Voters Stick With Him,\u201d David Brooks wrote an imagined conversation between an urban resident, \u201cUrban Guy,\u201d and a Trump supporter he calls \u201cFlyover Man.\u201d\n\nBrooks\u2019s piece attempts to explain to a perplexed urban resident why Trump\u2019s supporters in Middle America still back him, despite his being involved in actions Democrats deem so duplicitous that they\u2019ve launched an impeachment inquiry.\n\nIn one exchange, \u201cFlyover Man\u201d explains his support for Trump.\n\nUrban Guy: I hope you read the rough transcript of that Trump phone call with the Ukrainian president. Trump clearly used public power to ask a foreign leader to dig up dirt on his political opponent. This is impeachable. I don\u2019t see how you can deny the facts in front of your face. Flyover Man: I haven\u2019t really had time to look into it. There\u2019s always some fight between Trump and the East Coast media. I guess I just try to stay focused on the big picture. The big picture is this: We knew this guy was a snake when we signed up. But he was the only one who saw us. He was the only one who saw that the America we love is being transformed in front of our eyes. Good jobs for hard-working people were gone. Our communities in tatters. Our kids in trouble. I had one shot at change, so I made a deal with the devil, and you\u2019d have made it, too.\n\nOne problem with Brooks\u2019s depiction of Trump supporters is that it suggests they aren\u2019t rethinking their support for the president in light of the impeachment inquiry, despite what the data says. Some recent polling suggests that Republicans could be.\n\nBut perhaps the biggest issue with Brooks\u2019s piece is that it relies heavily on stereotypes of Trump supporters, something that those in the media have been accused of doing since the day Trump announced his campaign.\n\nThe idea that a working-class man in \u201cflyover country\u201d is the best representation of someone who has bought into Trump\u2019s vision of \u201cmaking America great\u201d is debatable. Data doesn\u2019t support the idea that most of Trump\u2019s supporters are working-class men in Middle America.\n\nTo understand Trump\u2019s appeal, the media must recognize how many people outside of the caricature were drawn to his candidacy.\n\nAs Nicholas Carnes, an assistant professor of public policy and political science at Duke University, and Noam Lupu, an associate professor of political science at Vanderbilt University, previously wrote for The Washington Post, most Trump supporters are not working-class.\n\n\u201cAccording to what is arguably the next-best measure of class, household income, Trump supporters didn\u2019t look overwhelmingly \u2018working class\u2019 during the primaries,\u201d they wrote. \u201cTo the contrary, many polls showed that Trump supporters were mostly affluent Republicans.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf being working class means being in the bottom half of the income distribution,\u201d they wrote, \u201cthe vast majority of Trump supporters during the primaries were not working class.\u201d\n\nBrooks\u2019s character talks about good jobs leaving his community, but Carnes and Lupu analyzed a survey of Trump supporters that showed that only a third of them had household incomes of $50,000 or below. About a third of them made between $50,000 and $100,000, with another third making at least $100,000.\n\nAnother problem with the framing of working-class voters as Trump supporters is that it doesn\u2019t acknowledge that Hillary Clinton won most working-class voters. More than half of voters making under $50,000 a year backed Clinton in 2016, according to exit polls.\n\nIf that comes as a surprise to you, it could be because coverage of working-class voters usually focuses on white people, despite the fact that the majority of those making under $50,000 a year are people of color. And polls repeatedly show that most people of color voted against Trump in 2016 and continue to give him low approval ratings.\n\nBrooks\u2019s column also reinforces the idea that the face of Trump\u2019s base lacks a college degree. But more than a third of Trump supporters have a bachelor\u2019s degree, according to the Pew Research Center. When you consider the incomes of Trump supporters, that is not so surprising, considering the correlation between education and income.\n\nThe 2016 election \u2014 along with the Trump presidency \u2014 has continued to shine a light on the urban-rural divide when it comes to U.S. politics. It is true that Trump won rural America \u2014 or what some may call \u201cflyover country\u201d \u2014 but perhaps not by as much as some assume. About a third of rural voters supported Clinton in 2016. This number is less surprising when you consider the demographics of rural America. More than 10 million \u2014 about one-fifth \u2014 of residents of rural America are people of color. Mara Casey Tieken, the author of \u201cWhy Rural Schools Matter,\u201d wrote in The Post that about 40 percent are African American, 35 percent are Latino, and the remaining 25 percent are Native American, Asian, Pacific Islander or multiracial.\n\nAnother shortcoming of Brooks\u2019s piece is that it assumes that urban dwellers are completely ignorant about why Trump\u2019s supporters fully back him. Countless media organizations, however, have regularly taken to producing roundtables and think pieces featuring Trump supporters explaining why they continue to stand behind the president. One could argue that anyone who does not understand why Trump\u2019s supporters still back him isn\u2019t paying attention.\n\nIt is true that Trump attracted support from some voters in Middle America who felt ignored by those in Washington. And many of them continue to back the president. And Brooks\u2019s fictional Trump supporter does display some accurate characteristics of the president\u2019s most loyal fans: a deep disgust for all media that is critical of Trump and enlistment in the culture wars. But making characters such as Flyover Man the face of Trump\u2019s support reinforces a truth about many journalists at elite media organizations: Many of us seem deeply unaware of how little we know about Trump\u2019s America.", "description": "There are far more Trump voters outside \"Trump country\" than some in the media choose to acknowledge.", "authors": ["Eugene Scott", "Reporter Covering Identity Politics For The Fix", "October At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/E7cz5H2WaHd_mQ7grTCY35kyxZE=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NC3TV5GTLMI6TCJEDW35VR4X7M.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
