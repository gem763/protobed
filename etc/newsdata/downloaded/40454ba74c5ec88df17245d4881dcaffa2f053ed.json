When we see each other we really want to spend time together.'\n\nOn the go: Curtis appeared unaffected by the late night on Monday as he sipped on his drink\n\nHe also revealed the couple aren't letting themselves be pressured by anyone else and are taking things at their own pace.\n\n'We're just not letting anybody else influence it - when we came out [of the villa] everyone said \"you got to make it official why aren\u2019t you posting things,\"\n\n'But it\u2019s our relationship we\u2019re going to chill out and take it easy we\u2019ve only known each other for three and a half months,' Curtis said.\n\nDapper: The star looked sharp on Monday night as he attended the Pride of Britain Awards and spoke about his relationship with Maura, saying they don't see each other every day\n\nAs for the rest of the year, it looks like the dancing pro won't be spending Christmas with Maura, as their busy schedules clash, and she's in training for Dancing On Ice.\n\nHe said: 'I think Maura\u2019s going back home to Ireland and I\u2019m gonna be doing two shows a day [in pantomime Dick Whittington] so I\u2019ll be too busy.\n\n'Our schedules change day by day so we try and plan but it\u2019s hard. There\u2019s so many opportunities. I want to support her all the way. If I don\u2019t see her for a month it\u2019s hard but I\u2019m fine with that.'\n\nCurtis was also full of praise for Maura's developing ice skating skills, saying: 'I\u2019ve been and watched her a couple of times.\n\nJoking around: Curtis and his Strictly Come Dancing star brother AJ, 24, appeared in good spirits as they walked the red carpet on Monday night\n\n'I saw a video of her from day one such a big improvement she\u2019s doing fantastic. I hope she wins it. I haven\u2019t seen the others I can\u2019t say yes or no.'\n\nAnd although his dancing terrain is rather different to Maura's, Curtis said he will 'absolutely' give her some tips.\n\nHe said: 'I dance on a floor so it\u2019s quite grippy but I\u2019ll absolutely help her from here up [the top half] once she gets the technique and the basic before putting the icing on the cake.'\n\nEarlier this month Curtis and Maura, who have been dating since their stint on this year's Love Island, made their relationship official.\n\nLove: Maura and Curtis finally made their romance official three months after leaving the villa and are now boyfriend and girlfriend\n\nCurtis whisked Maura away on a romantic weekend and then asked her to be his girlfriend over dinner.\n\nMaura told OK! magazine: 'He asked and I said yes obviously. He took me away for a weekend break, and he asked me out over dinner in London the next day.'\n\nWhen asked why it took the couple longer than most to make their relationship official, Curtis insisted he didn't want them to rush into things too quickly.\n\nHe said: 'I want something that's going to last forever. There's no point in rushing things. We've only known each other a short amount of time.'", "description": "Curtis Pritchard, 23, and Maura Higgins, 28, spent the summer together on Love Island but he has said it's 'nice in a weird way' to not spend every day with each other now.", "authors": ["Laura Fox", "Bryony Jewell For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/01/20355194-0-image-a-186_1572398801537.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
