There were emotional scenes as family members were reunited on the runway.\n\n\n\nOleg Sentsov, a film-maker sentenced to 20 years by Russia on hotly disputed \u201cterrorism\u201d charges, was also among those released.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy welcomed the released prisoners at the airport in Kyiv.

He said he hoped the exchange was the first step in increased efforts to bring peace to war-torn east Ukraine, where more than 13,000 people have died in ongoing fighting.\n\n\n\nThe Ukrainian sailors were seized by Russia in November after their navy vessels tried to pass through the Kerch Strait, a narrow waterway between the Russian mainland and Crimea. Moscow charged them with illegally entering Russian territory, while Ukraine says they were in international waters.\n\n\n\nThe prisoner swap is a major domestic triumph for Zelenskiy. A comedian with no previous political experience, Zelenskiy came to power earlier this year after promising to bring Ukrainian prisoners home from Russian jails.\n\n\n\nThe Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said on Thursday that the prisoner exchange would be \u201ca good step\u201d toward the normalisation of relations between Moscow and Kyiv. The Kremlin denies sending Russian troops to east Ukraine and says any Russians fighting there are \u201cvolunteers.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Russian foreign ministry said the historic prisoner exchange was the result of negotiations between Putin and Zelenskiy. \u201cUnlike its predecessors, Zelenskiy\u2019s administration has demonstrated a sensible approach and a willingness to compromise,\u201d the ministry said. Rossiya 24, a Russian state television channel, described the exchange as a \u201clong-awaited and joyous occasion\u201d.\n\n\n\nPutin did not greet the prisoners released by Ukraine, choosing to spend the afternoon at a centre for rhythmic gymnastics in Moscow.\n\n\n\nThe exchange comes ahead of an expected summit between Germany, France, Russia and Ukraine to discuss the conflict in eastern Ukraine. Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, praised the release of the prisoners as a \u201csign of hope\u201d.\n\n\n\nThere was controversy, however, over Ukraine\u2019s decision to hand over to Moscow a separatist commander thought to be involved in the downing of Malaysia Airlines MH17 in July 2014. Vladimir Tsemakh, who previously commanded a separatist air defence unit, was seized by Ukrainian special forces at his home in east Ukraine in July and brought to Kyiv. He had previously indicated that he hid evidence of a Buk missile system, the kind Dutch investigators say shot down the jet, killing all 298 people on board. International investigators say the Buk was transported from a Russian military facility to east Ukraine on the day of the attack. Russia is reported to have insisted on the release of Tsemakh, a Ukrainian citizen, as a condition for Saturday\u2019s prisoner exchange.\n\n\n\nHis release came despite an appeal to Ukraine from 40 members of the European parliament, as well as EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ukrainian film director Oleg Sentsov hugs his daughter Alina Sentsova after landing in Kyiv.

Although Russian law forbids it from extraditing its citizens, the law does not cover non-nationals.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs of this moment, Russia is harboring a suspect in the murder of 298 civilians,\u201d Christo Grozev, a member of the Bellingcat investigative journalism website that tracked the movements of the Buk missile from Russia to Ukraine, posted on Twitter.\n\n\n\nUkraine also freed Kyrylo Vyshynsky, a Ukrainian-born journalist who previously worked for Russia\u2019s state-run Ria Novosti news agency in Kyiv. Vyshynsky was charged with treason by Ukraine, but was released on bail last month. Vyshynsky said he intended to return to Kyiv to \u201cprove his innocence\u201d.\n\n\n\nMaksim Odintsov and Alexander Baranov, two former Ukrainian servicemen that Ukraine says defected to Russia during the Kremlin\u2019s annexation of Crimea, were also released by Ukraine.", "description": "Each country releasing 35 prisoners in biggest exchange since start of Crimea conflict", "authors": ["Marc Bennetts"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02778887f9a99e78bcfae4e63cdec4eba9e68ce4/0_0_3793_2276/master/3793.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=cef861719797e64c361ebede80276237", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
