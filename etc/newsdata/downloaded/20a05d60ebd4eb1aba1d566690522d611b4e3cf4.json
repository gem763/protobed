The tweet in which he misspelled \"libel\" was later deleted, and retweeted with the correct spelling.\n\nThe new allegation, in which Mr Kavanaugh was said to have exposed himself to a female Yale classmate before others pushed his genitals into the hands of the woman, has led some to call for the justice's impeachment.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

The lies being told about him are unbelievable. False Accusations without recrimination. When does it stop? They are trying to influence his opinions. Can\u2019t let that happen!\" Mr Trump wrote.\n\nIn the United States, proving libel can be incredibly difficult, especially for a public figure at the top of government, like a Supreme Court justice or a US president.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

He is an innocent man who has been treated HORRIBLY. Such lies about him. They want to scare him into turning Liberal!\"\n\nThe new allegations against Mr Kavanaugh were detailed in the New York Times, after two officials with the FBI spoke with that newspaper.\n\nThose officials told the paper that a DC-based non-profit owner named Max Stier, who was also a classmate of Mr Kavanaugh's at Yale, had told the intelligence agency that he witnessed Mr Kavanaugh expose himself to a fellow student in university, before others pushed his genitals into the woman's hands. The action was taken, apparently, without her consent.\n\nThose allegations were apparently brought to the intelligence agency during Mr Kavanaugh's Senate confirmation process last year, but the FBI failed to investigate the matter further. Mr Stier did not come forward publicly at that time.\n\nThe newly surfaced allegation has caused the hashtags \"#ImpeachKavanaugh\" and \"#ImpeachKavanaughNow\" to trend on Twitter in the United States, with some raising questions about the thoroughness of the initial FBI enquiry after allegations surfaced against Mr Kavanaugh from women like Christine Blasey Ford and Deborah Ramirez. Ms Blasey Ford, notably, testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee to detail her claims against Mr Kavanaugh.", "description": "Donald Trump has suggested Brett Kavanaugh\u00a0sue for \"liable\" \u2014\u00a0meaning to say \"libel\" \u2014\u00a0after\u00a0a fresh sexual assault allegation\u00a0was\u00a0raised against the Supreme Court justice in the New York Times.", "authors": ["Clark Mindock"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/15/09/trump-kavanaugh.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
