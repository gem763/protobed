If they cannot trust in Washington\u2019s promises, who can?\n\nEven worse, the hasty withdrawal of special operators from Syria has effectively green lighted a Turkish invasion of northeastern Syria. On a humanitarian level, this bodes ominously for local inhabitants \u2014 several civilians have already been killed in airstrikes, and the precedent of Turkey\u2019s 2017 \u201cOlive Branch\u201d operation suggests large-scale ethnic cleansing may follow suit.\n\nStrategically, the implications are no less dire. Confronted with a widespread Turkish assault, the SDF will be forced to redeploy away from the front lines with the Islamic State, just as that group appears to be regrouping in both Iraq and Syria.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOn balance, then, this move appears to benefit America\u2019s rivals \u2014 ISIS, President Erdogan, Syria\u2019s Bashar al-Assad and his Iranian allies \u2014 while harming American interests and demoralizing America\u2019s allies. What should be done instead?\n\nOne option, suggested by the President and his allies, is to continue to draw down US troop levels in Syria but deter Turkish aggression through economic sanctions. As a first step, the President reportedly plans to sign an executive order paving the way to sanctions on Turkish entities. \u201cWe can shut down the Turkish economy if we need to,\u201d as Mr. Mnuchin recently put it.\n\nYet the prospect of hypothetical sanctions seems unlikely to halt a long-planned major ground operation \u2014 Turkey\u2019s third offensive inside Syria in as many years \u2014 against what Ankara perceives as a \u201cseparatist terror group\u201d posing a major threat to Turkish national security. In truth, the U.S. alliance with the SDF was always a high-risk proposition, viewed in Ankara with the darkest of suspicion. Given the collapse of the Turkish-Kurdish peace process in 2015, many believed that it was only a matter of time before Turkey forced the US to choose between its NATO ally and its Syrian Kurdish partner. And now that that hour has come, the options are bleak indeed.\n\nAnother option, sure to prove distasteful to some, would be to encourage reconciliation between the SDF and Damascus. If Syria\u2019s northeast could be peacefully reincorporated into the Syrian state under negotiated terms, that might offer some hope of averting a protracted Turkish-Kurdish war and opening a space for the Islamic State to reemerge. After all, Turkey might have few qualms about all-out conflict with a newly isolated Kurdish militia, but the prospect of war with Syria \u2014 and, by extension, its Iranian patron \u2014 would be another matter entirely.\n\nSuccessfully executing such a gambit would require a degree of diplomatic nimbleness seldom seen. Syria\u2019s Kurds, after years of hard-won battlefield triumphs, would have to concede substantial power to a government with a well-earned reputation for being vindictive and punitive in victory.\n\nFor its part, the U.S. would need to extract credible guarantees from Damascus that the most repressive apparatuses of the Syrian state \u2014 particularly the dreaded mukhabarat \u2014 would be excluded from the northeast. It is far from certain that the Asad regime would consent to such an arrangement, yet the Kurds might well be forgiven for opting to take their chances on the battlefield without it.\n\nShould this vision be politically or practically unrealizable, America\u2019s last, best option would be an ad hoc combination of military re-commitment (which a careful reading of Kurdish rhetoric indicates is still possible), economic deterrence, and diplomatic reconciliation. It would require President Trump to reconsider his decision to withdraw American troops without consulting America\u2019s allies, to deploy them to the Syrian-Turkish border, and to offer Ankara a calibrated package of political and economic disincentives to halt its military operations.\n\nProdding Erdogan to de-escalate while simultaneously enabling him to save face will be a delicate act, but mercifully free of the moral and strategic compromises implicit in the other available options. Above all, it would require Washington to wean itself of the risk-aversion, impatience, short-term vision, and unrealistic alignment of ends and means which have all too often been the cornerstone of policymaking in the Middle East.\n\nAhmed Charai is on the board directors at the Atlantic Council and an international counselor at the Center for the National Interest, which is a Washington, D.C.-based public policy think tank.
