REUTERS/Siphiwe Sibeko/File Photo\n\nThe miner has been fixing its balance sheet after spending much of this decade investing in its flagship Cullinan mine in South Africa.\n\nPetra\u2019s share price fell to an all-time low of 7.25 pence, recovering slightly to trade down 8% by 0830 GMT at 7.45 pence. The stock is down about 80% this year.\n\nThe miner said on Monday it had generated positive cash flow for the first time since embarking on its major expansion plan in 2011 and had a programme to improve efficiency and cut debt.\n\nOperational cash flow in 2019 was positive at $70.5 million compared with outflows last year.\n\nBut adjusted core profit fell to $153 million in the year ended June 30 from $195.4 million a year earlier, compared with analysts' average expectations of $172 million, according to company-compiled consensus here of seven estimates.\n\nAlongside the impact of the Sino-U.S. trade dispute and protests in Hong Kong, some analysts blame manmade stones for price weakness and soft demand. Natural diamond producers say their product is distinct.\n\nCEO Richard Duffy, who took over in April, said in an interview he expected the market to remain under pressure. In the longer term, actions by major producers, led by Anglo American unit De Beers, to restrict supply should help.\n\nDuffy has been overseeing a three-year plan to cut debt. Petra said net debt was $541 million at the end of June.\n\nLaunched in July, Project 2022 aims to reduce debt by delivering $150 million to $200 million in cumulative free cash flow through efficiencies and improvement across the business.\n\nPetra said on Monday non-executive Chairman Adonis Pouroulis would leave the board by the end of the third quarter 2020, once a successor had been appointed. Duffy said it was a natural moment in the company\u2019s plans for Pouroulis to step down.\n\nKieron Hodgson, an analyst at Panmure Gordon who rates the company \u201chold\u201d, said \u201cThe ability to deliver on the stated goals of \u2018Project 2022\u2019 will be crucial.\u201d", "description": "Shares in African diamond miner Petra Diamonds hit an all-time low on Monday after it missed forecasts with a 22% fall in annual profit, as a Sino-U.S. trade row and protests in Hong Kong dented demand in big Asian markets.", "authors": ["Yadarisa Shabong", "Barbara Lewis", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190916&t=2&i=1430400043&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8F0M5-OZABS", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
