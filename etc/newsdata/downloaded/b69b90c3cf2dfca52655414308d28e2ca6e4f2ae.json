However insignificant or major it was it in our lives, we don't give them closure. Instead, we stop responding to their calls, let their unread text messages pile up on our phone.\n\nIf we ever see them, we pretend like we don't know them. We act as if we never woke up to them every single day and spoke to them. We so effortlessly let it slide from our mind that they were our favourite 'hello' and our most precious 'goodnight'. We treat each other like strangers.\n\nAnd that's because it's easier to disappear. An art that our generation would probably be known by, for years to come.\n\nPexels\n\nSo why don't we say goodbye?\n\nWhy can't we leave with dignity by respecting the other person who really doesn't deserve this cold, dead lifetime of silence.\n\nWe as a generation lack this sensitivity. We don't explain. We couldn't care enough to see if the other person is okay. How they are coping without us. We just take off. We start speaking to another person to fill incomplete voids. We associate happiness with a destination and end up booking tickets to run away.\n\nBecause disappearing is believed to be cooler than staying.\n\nPexels\n\nSo we disappear. Because obviously we'll do what's cool, right?\n\nWe disappear because disappearing is stronger, disappearing makes you the one in control, so we keep disappearing instead of staying and wonder why we end up alone or in unfulfilling relationships.\n\nOh and the biggest irony of all, we disappear and stay up all night waiting to be found.\n\nPexels\n\nInstead, say goodbye. Let them know they mattered. Let them know what went wrong.\n\nChoose to be the 'good' in the 'goodbye'.", "description": "We don't officially end our relationship with them.
