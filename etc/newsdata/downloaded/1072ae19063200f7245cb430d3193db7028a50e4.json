REUTERS/Peloton/Handout\n\nThe IPO by Peloton, which has not turned a profit for at least the past three years, was seen by some in the market as a test of investor appetite for loss-making stocks.\n\nPeloton priced its IPO at $29 per share, compared to a price range of $26-$29, the company said in a statement, confirming an earlier Reuters report.\n\nThis valued Peloton at around $8.1 billion, almost double its most recent valuation in the private market of $4.15 billion, according to data provider PitchBook.\n\nPeloton\u2019s listing comes after teeth alignment company SmileDirectClub (SDC.O), whose $74.8 million losses like Peloton\u2019s more than doubled last year, priced its shares above its target range in its IPO. The stock tumbled on their market debut earlier this month.\n\nRide-hailing companies Uber Technologies (UBER.N) and Lyft Inc (LYFT.O), which have no stated timetable for becoming profitable, have also struggled since going public earlier this year.\n\nFounded in 2012, Peloton sells indoor bicycles in packages requiring memberships to access live and on-demand classes from home.\n\nFor the year ended June 30, Peloton\u2019s revenue more than doubled to $915 million but net losses widened to $195.6 million from $47.9 million.\n\nThe stock is due to begin trading on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange on Thursday under the symbol \u201cPTON.\u201d\n\nGoldman Sachs, J.P.
