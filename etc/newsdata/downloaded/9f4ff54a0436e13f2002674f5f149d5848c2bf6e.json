The reality against Bulgaria was somewhat different and the imagination is likely to remain where the Manchester United forward outscores the England captain given their respective roles in Gareth Southgate\u2019s side. Kane\u2019s hat-trick, however, did not disguise the reality of how important Rashford is to England. He was goalless, frustrated but crucial to breaking Bulgaria and maintaining Southgate\u2019s stroll towards Euro 2020.\n\nHarry Kane hits hat-trick in England\u2019s demolition of blundering Bulgaria Read more\n\nStationed on the left against a five-man defence and without opportunity to even argue over penalty-taking duties for his country, unlike for his club, the United striker had no option but to leave thoughts of hat-tricks and headlines to the man in the centre. But Rashford\u2019s selflessness was not lost on Kane or the manager. In trying contests such as this, when opponents retreat en masse in recognition of England\u2019s varied attacking options, the pace, movement and awareness of the 21-year-old can prove invaluable. He may have lacked the goals of Kane or the finesse of Raheem Sterling but Rashford responded impressively to the internal competition for places that is currently fiercer than England\u2019s Group A rivals. As Kane reflected: \u201cWhen I\u2019m playing with players like Raz [Sterling] and Rashford they\u2019re going to create so many chances. They are so good one v one and so skilful that they\u2019re going to win penalties.\u201d\n\nBy the barometer of current form Rashford might have been considered fortunate to start given Jadon Sancho\u2019s early-season impact for Borussia Dortmund. But the England manager, as he made clear in the buildup to the first international of the season, is not in the business of experimentation. Visions of a Euro 2020 final appearance at Wembley next summer or of qualifying matches being a testing ground for young potential are for other people to ponder, Southgate had insisted on Friday. He was good as his word in selecting players who have delivered results in an England shirt.\n\nRashford was therefore in on merit, having scored four times in his previous seven internationals. Sancho, despite returning three goals and four assist in five outings for Dortmund this season, had to bide his time for another opportunity to impress. He may have had some sympathy for England\u2019s forwards given the red wall Bulgaria built from the first whistle.\n\nWatford sack Javi Gracia and reappoint Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores Read more\n\nKrasimir Balakov deployed a 5-4-1 formation in which the only room for manoeuvre was for the addition of an extra defender when Rashford or the immaculate Sterling gained possession. The new Bulgaria coach\u2019s negativity was understandable given the team have not won in seven matches and sit bottom of Group A. \u201cThere is an enormous difference in the levels of the two teams and so we wanted to be compact,\u201d Balakov admitted. But it made for a desperate spectacle. Rashford evidently thought so too, with frustration prompting a wayward shot from 30 yards after 23 minutes of stalemate and running into disciplined cul-de-sacs. The merciful release of Kane\u2019s first goal arrived from the subsequent goal-kick and goalkeeper Plamen Iliev\u2019s brain freeze.\n\nRashford\u2019s patience was stretched before the breakthrough allowed the game to follow suit. The 21-year-old regularly dropped deep in search of possession and an escape from Bulgaria\u2019s packed lines but to limited effect. Sterling, by contrast, stayed on the last man when England probed, backing his speed and evasiveness to inflict damage on the visitors\u2019 back-line. His judgment was correct throughout.\n\nOnce England were ahead and gaps appeared in the Bulgaria ranks, however, the United forward showed precisely why he retains the confidence of his manager. Rashford drove at the Bulgarian defence whenever the opportunity arrived. In the first half that ambition was stifled by the number of red shirts in front of him or Nikolay Bodurov pulling his white one when he looked to launch a counterattack. But seconds after Jordan Pickford prevented Wanderson equalising early in the second half Rashford\u2019s perseverance was rewarded when he burst into space down the left, checked back inside Bodurov and was felled for a clear penalty. In contrast to the confusion over penalties at club level, Rashford dutifully stood aside as his captain doubled England\u2019s advantage from the spot.\n\nAnother driving run from Rashford and well-timed lay-off to Kane produced England\u2019s third for Sterling. Now, with the game won, it was Southgate\u2019s time to introduce Sancho and Mason Mount. The two exciting young prospects were greeted with jubilant fanfare but Rashford, rightly, remains the man in possession of the shirt.", "description": "Gareth Southgate\u2019s faith in Marcus Rashford was rewarded by a mature performance that was all about helping his teammates to an impressive 4-0 Euro 2020 qualifier win over Bulgaria", "authors": ["Andy Hunter"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98b82ddfeea4539d436bbe3dfbdd657eca990bae/0_92_4300_2581/master/4300.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ac519cbacd2beb0168ed07cf91d53416", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
