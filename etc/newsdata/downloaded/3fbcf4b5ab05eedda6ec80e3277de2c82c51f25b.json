(AP) - For the third straight season since their move to Los Angeles, the Chargers have a losing record after their first three games.\n\nWhile last season\u2019s team responded to a 1-2 start by going 11-2, these injury-plagued Bolts (1-2) are drawing no comfort from the fact they\u2019ve been here before.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to look in hindsight and say, \u2018Oh, we still had a good season,\u2019\u201d running back Austin Ekeler said. \u201cIn this one, you don\u2019t know. We could not win another game. That\u2019s how the season could go. We\u2019ve got to make sure we\u2019re on all of our techniques, all of our fundamentals.\u201d\n\nThose fundamentals aren\u2019t yet second nature to everybody suiting up for the Chargers, who are relying on inexperienced talent due to injuries, particularly on the offensive line and in the secondary. The Houston Texans exploited both areas during their second-half comeback from a double-digit deficit for a 27-20 victory last weekend .\n\nLos Angeles is missing several starting-caliber defensive backs along with its starting left tackle, tight end and running back, among others. Coach Anthony Lynn and the Chargers won\u2019t use it as an excuse, but the improvisational nature of their lineups has been obvious so far.\n\nFor instance, the Chargers\u2019 starters against Houston included safety Roderic Teamer, an undrafted rookie making his first NFL start, and Brandon Facyson, an undrafted second-year cornerback.\n\nOpponents are picking up on the Chargers\u2019 deficiencies as well. Lynn lamented the Texans\u2019 strategy to use max protection blocking schemes for Deshaun Watson combined with a quick passing game, which put pressure on LA\u2019s secondary and minimized the opportunities for Joey Bosa and Melvin Ingram to get sacks.\n\n\u201cWe want to figure out different ways to affect the quarterback like tipping balls and getting their hands up,\u201d Lynn said. \u201cWhen we got to (Watson), we didn\u2019t get him on the ground at all.\u201d\n\nLos Angeles\u2019 inability to finish with a lead has popped up twice already this season, and Lynn is getting tired of it - even though he knows it\u2019s partly a reflection of the compromises being forced on the Chargers by their personnel shortages.\n\n\u201cWe have to finish football games,\u201d Lynn said Monday. \u201cWe\u2019re getting up by two scores, and guys are coming back and that same urgency is not there right now.\u201d\n\nWHAT\u2019S WORKING\n\nPhilip Rivers and Keenan Allen are one of the most dangerous combinations in the NFL, and they only appear to be getting better. Rivers found Allen with 13 passes for a career-high 183 yards and two touchdowns against Houston, with the star wideout repeatedly getting open for big gains. Allen entered Monday leading the NFL with 404 yards receiving, further underlining his status as one of the best receivers in the league.\n\nWHAT NEEDS HELP\n\nPlenty of LA\u2019s offensive problems can be traced to the line, which yielded five sacks of Rivers - although only four were the line\u2019s fault, according to Lynn. The line is playing without veteran left tackle Russell Okung, and rookie replacement Trent Scott committed the final-minute holding penalty that essentially ruined the Chargers\u2019 last drive with the game on the line.\n\n\u201cThe protection could have been better in some cases,\u201d Lynn said. \u201cThere\u2019s room for improvement.\u201d\n\nLynn isn\u2019t panicking about the line\u2019s play just yet. The Chargers will stick with the same starting five next week, although backup Forrest Lamp will play more.\n\nSTOCK UP\n\nLinebacker Thomas Davis and versatile defensive back Desmond King are standing out on the defense. Davis is third in the league with 33 tackles, while King had four tackles, a quarterback hit and a fumble recovery against Houston.\n\nSTOCK DOWN\n\nTeamer had a few ups and some definite downs in his first start as Derwin James\u2019 replacement at strong safety, but he\u2019ll probably get another chance this week. Lynn isn\u2019t interested in moving Rayshawn Jenkins, his starting free safety, to the strong side to clear a bigger role for Nasir Adderley, the promising second-round pick who missed much of training camp with injury.\n\n\u201cIt looked like a rookie in his first start,\u201d Lynn said of Teamer. \u201cBut we have a lot of confidence in Roderic. We know he\u2019s going to get better. He\u2019ll get there.\u201d\n\nINJURED\n\nTight end Virgil Green left the game with a groin injury, and Lynn isn\u2019t sure about his availability this week. The Chargers didn\u2019t have any other new injury setbacks, according to Lynn. The coach also isn\u2019t sure whether any key players will return this week from their injuries - not even kicker Michael Badgley, who wasn\u2019t able to make his season debut due to a nagging groin injury.\n\nKEY NUMBER\n\n10: Sacks of the 37-year-old Rivers already allowed by the Chargers in three games. That\u2019s the ninth-most in the NFL entering Monday night.\n\nNEXT STEPS\n\nThe Chargers have plenty of problems, but they couldn\u2019t ask for much better circumstances to work on them with a trip to rebuilding Miami this weekend. They won\u2019t overlook the struggling Dolphins (0-3), however.\n\n\u201cShoot, I feel like we\u2019re going through a struggle, too,\u201d Ekeler said. \u201cWe\u2019ve lost two games in a row, and in the first game, we barely snuck by in overtime. We\u2019ve got to get on the ball.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "For the third straight season since their move to Los Angeles, the Chargers have a losing record after their first three games.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Greg Beacham"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/22/aptopix_texans_chargers_football_73686_c0-129-3086-1928_s1770x1032.jpg?eee799b9749b8af1b390b3615879b88ab36bc9a2", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
