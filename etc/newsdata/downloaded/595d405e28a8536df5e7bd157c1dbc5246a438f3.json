The bitcoin options contract will be based on the benchmark Bakkt Monthly Bitcoin Futures.\n\nBakkt\u2019s bitcoin futures volume hit a record of 1,179 contracts on Friday. While Bakkt\u2019s product saw muted activity at launch in September, recent market volatility has caused volumes to increase, analysts said.\n\nDespite the rise in volumes, Bakkt still lags the CME which saw a 10-fold rise in volume. Bakkt differs from the CME in that Bakkt offers a physically-settled bitcoin futures contract whereas the CME offers a cash-settled product.\n\nBakkt is an affiliate of Intercontinental Exchange, which also owns the New York Stock Exchange.", "description": "Cryptocurrency trading platform Bakkt Trust Co LLC said on Monday it is focused on the development of consumer applications for digital assets and will test one such app with its first launch partner, Starbucks Corp, in the first half of next year.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
