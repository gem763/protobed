There was the controversial interference call on Trea Turner that threatened to derail a Nationals seventh-inning rally and ultimately led to the Nationals\u2019 attempting a protest. Though he didn\u2019t pitch, there was a surprise Max Scherzer appearance in the bullpen two days after being scratched from a start with neck spasms. There was a raucous Houston crowd hoping its energy would will a World Series celebration.\n\nIn the end, it was Washington\u2019s will that prevailed as the Nationals won their fourth straight elimination game this postseason to force the 40th Game 7 in World Series history on Wednesday night.\n\nAnd if it\u2019s anything like Game 6, it will be an instant classic.\n\nAnthony Rendon got the scoring started with a single through Houston\u2019s shifted infield. That was just the beginning of a massive game for Washington\u2019s All-Star third baseman. The Astros immediately countered with two runs against Stephen Strasburg in the bottom half following a George Springer double, a Jose Altuve sacrifice fly and an Alex Bregman home run that raised the ire of baseball purists because he decided to carry his bat all the way with him to first base.\n\nThat moment prompted a response from Washington\u2019s Juan Soto, who four innings later carried his own bat all the way to first base following a go-ahead home run. Soto\u2019s blast followed Adam Eaton\u2019s game-tying home run off Justin Verlander.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe game\u2019s two biggest hits were both delivered by Rendon. In the seventh inning, he smashed a two-run home run to extend the Nationals lead and lessen the impact of the earlier interference call. Then in the ninth, he put the game away with a two-run double.\n\nStephen Strasburg made the support stand up, pitching 8 1/3 innings of two-run ball before turning it over to closer Sean Doolittle.\n\nWHO MADE THE DIFFERENCE\n\n\u2022 Anthony Rendon: The free agent-to-be extended his Nationals\u2019 career at least one more game with a big night at the plate. He now has seven hits in the series and seven RBIs.\n\n\u2022 Juan Soto: The 21-year-old slugger hit his third home run of the World Series, proving again that no moment is too big for him. Though he struggled when the series moved to Washington, he\u2019s still hitting .333 with six RBIs.\n\n\u2022 Stephen Strasburg: He outpitched Justin Verlander again and has looked like the best pitcher in a series filled with aces.\n\nMUST-SEE MOMENT\n\nThere was no shortage of must-see moments in Game 6.\n\nThe controversial interference call stands out among them all. Here it is.\n\nTrea Turner was called out for interference here.\n\n\n\nDid the umps blow it?\n\n\n\n(via @MLBonFox) pic.twitter.com/pdN4753HP6 \u2014 Yahoo Sports MLB (@MLByahoosports) October 30, 2019\n\nWHAT THEY'LL BE TALKING ABOUT\n\nBatgate: The Alex Bregman-Juan Soto bat controversy has already earned its share of headlines. It\u2019s a World Series moment that will be talked about for a long time.\n\nThe interference call: Though it didn\u2019t impact the outcome, it will be difficult for MLB viewers to move on without thinking about the interference call on Trea Turner at first base. The call led to an ejection, an attempted protest and an over five-minute delay so the umpires could confirm the call was not able to be reviewed or protested.\n\nJustin Verlander: For the third time this postseason, Verlander didn\u2019t have his best stuff in a possible closeout game for Houston. In those starts, Verlander has allowed 11 earned runs, with eight of those coming in the first inning.\n\nRoad Warriors: With Washington\u2019s win, road teams are now 6-0 in this World Series.\n\nWHAT'S NEXT\n\nIt all comes down to this. Game 7 of the World Series will be played on Wednesday night at Minute Maid Park. First pitch is scheduled for 8:07 p.m. ET and the game will be broadcast on FOX.\n\nAfter being scratched from his Game 5, Max Scherzer is expected to start this do-or-die clash. He has not pitched since allowing two runs in five innings in Game 1. The Astros will counter with Zack Greinke, who allowed 10 baserunners but only one run over 4 2/3 innings in Game 3.\n\nIt's a Game 7 though, so short of Justin Verlander and Stephen Strasburg you can expect all hands to be on deck for both teams.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "The Nationals defeated the Astros 7-2 in Game 6 to force the 40th Game 7 in World Series history.", "authors": ["Mark Townsend"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/drU78kbfL2ij_altBqcQEQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Iv7c9rsKHc2629podFDrIw--~B/aD0yMDcwO3c9MzEwNTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/ef293fb0-fac5-11e9-bfa6-037b09e8f1c0", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
