The photo was accompanied by a series of hashtags including \u201c#LoveTrumpsHate\u201d and \u201cWriteWhatScaresYou.\u201d\n\nCampus Reform reported on Wednesday that Bird had been disciplined as a result of the incident. Although Bird told reporters earlier this week that she had been cleared of wrongdoing, Johnston Community College President David Johnson told the press that Bird had been disciplined.\n\nOver the past week, members of the community expressed their concerns over Bird\u2019s classroom conduct in a series of comments to the local press.\n\n\u201cMs. Bird singled out this student on social media, barely hiding his identity and did not obscure the identity of the other student(s), and added political commentary including the fact that she felt threatened by his choice of clothing. If this were my child in her class I would be very upset,\u201d one community member told a local outlet. \u201cOur children are not your political statement.\u201d\n\nA.P. Dillon, a conservative education blogger located in North Carolina, argued that Bird\u2019s conduct is unacceptable for an educator. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to disagree with someone\u2019s political views, but it is quite another to post altered photos of them mocking them on social media, which only encourages others to join in. This is reprehensible behavior that is unbecoming of an educator and faculty member,\u201d Dillon said.\n\nStay tuned to Breitbart News for more updates on this story.", "description": "A professor at a Smithfield, North Carolina, community college was disciplined by administrators this week after she was reported for mocking one of her students for wearing a Trump campaign t-shirt to class.", "authors": ["Tom Ciccotta"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/bird-1-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
