At least nine people have died. Federal and state investigators are focusing on vape cartridges that likely contained contaminated tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana. But they are also looking at all substances used in electronic cigarettes, including those with nicotine.\n\nAltria had bet big on its investment in Juul, which soared for a time on the strength of flavored vaping liquids.
