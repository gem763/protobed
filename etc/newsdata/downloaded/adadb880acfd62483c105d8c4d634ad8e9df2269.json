The book was initially delayed after a radio host uncovered significant errors in Wolf\u2019s research:\n\nIn June, days before the book was expected to go on sale in the United States, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt postponed the publication and recalled copies from retailers, an unusual and costly move. The publisher said at the time that \u201cnew questions have arisen that require more time to explore.\u201d Now, it has pulled the book altogether. On Monday, a spokeswoman for Houghton Mifflin Harcourt said in an email that Ms. Wolf and the publisher \u201cmutually and amicably agreed to part company.\u201d\n\nOne of the issues raised in the book was the alleged execution of various people in 19th century England for the crime of sodomy. Wolf claimed to have identified several dozen executions of homosexuals, including some who were only teenagers.\n\nHowever, in a BBC radio interview to promote the book, host Matthew Sweet revealed that Wolf had made a critical mistake. She misunderstood a bit of archaic court terminology (\u201cDeath recorded\u201d) to mean people had been executed when in fact it meant they had been pardoned. Here\u2019s my account of the radio exchange from back in May:\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re right about this,\u201d Sweet said. He then began reading a passage from the book: \u201cOne of the cases that you look at that\u2019s salient in your report is that Thomas Silver. It says \u2018teenagers were now convicted more often. Indeed, that year\u2026\u2019 which is 1859, \u2018fourteen-year-old Thomas Silver was actually executed for committing sodomy. The boy was indicted for an unnatural offense. Guilty. Death recorded. This is the first time the phrase unnatural offense entered the Old Bailey records.\u2019\u201d \u201cThomas Silver wasn\u2019t executed,\u201d Sweet said. \u201cDeath recorded\u2014I was really surprised by this and I looked it up. Death recorded is what\u2019s in, I think, most of these cases that you\u2019ve identified as executions. It doesn\u2019t mean that he was executed. It was a category that was created in 1823 that allowed judges to abstain from pronouncing a sentence of death on any capital convict who they considered to be a fit subject for pardon. I don\u2019t think any of the executions you\u2019ve identified here actually happened.\u201d\n\nJust as bad, Sweet found that all of the people Wolf was presenting as victims in her book were in fact found guilty of rape and, in some cases, pedophilia:\n\n\u201cWhen I found this I didn\u2019t really know what to do with it because I think it\u2019s quite a big problem with your argument,\u201d Sweet said. He continued, \u201cAlso, it\u2019s the nature of the offense here. Thomas Silver committed an indecent assault on a six-year-old boy. And he served two-and-a-half years for it in Portsmouth prison which doesn\u2019t seem too excessive really. \u201cAnd I wonder about all the others because all the others that I followed up, I can\u2019t find any evidence that any of these relationships that you\u2019ve described were consensual. The other one you offer is James Spence, 60-year-old tutor. He committed what was described as felonious assault on schoolboys. One of these cases you offer is a bestiality case and not a buggery case. So, I think there\u2019s a problem here with this argument.\u201d\n\nThe picture Wolf was trying to paint of 19th-century bigots executing gay people was actually evidence of sexual offenders who received appropriate sentences for their crimes, i.e. things we would still, rightly, consider crimes in the 21st century.\n\nI don\u2019t know how you recover from a mistake that glaring. Wolf tells the Times that her book, or some version of it, will still be published \u201cin due course.\u201d Maybe she should quit while she\u2019s ahead. And if you haven\u2019t heard this radio excerpt before it\u2019s definitely worth a listen.", "description": "\"new questions have arisen that require more time to explore.\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Naomi-Wolf.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
