The \u2018Great Dane\u2019, as he is known, moved to the United States from his native Copenhagen as a teenage exchange student, and was so impressive in a single season of high school football that he earned himself a scholarship to Michigan State university.\n\nBy the time he was drafted 86th overall by the New Orleans Saints in the 1982 NFL draft multiple school records had fallen, setting the tone for a pro career which spanned 25 seasons and a league-record 382 games. Andersen is one of only two kickers to be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, and was the NFL\u2019s leading points scorer until Adam Vinatieri edged past him last year.\n\nAnd yet it was almost over before it had even begun. Andersen tore ligaments in his right ankle on his very first kick-off in the NFL, and with the fragility of the position, knew that it could have meant trouble.\n\n\u201cOh god I was worried,\u201d he says. \u201cI was worried about my job in pre-season because I think was like three or four for 12, which is not really lighting anything on fire, and I\u2019m going, s***, I\u2019m going to be out of here before I even get started.\u201d", "description": "Morten Andersen knows a thing or two about kicking in the NFL.", "authors": ["Alex Finnis"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/american-football/2019/10/27/TELEMMGLPICT000211428213-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
