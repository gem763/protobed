The driver has not been formally identified but a source familiar with the investigation said he was Mo Robinson from the Portadown area of the British province.\n\nParamedics and police found the bodies of 31 men and eight women on Wednesday in a truck container on an industrial estate at Grays in Essex, about 20 miles (32 km) east of London.\n\nFor years, illegal immigrants have attempted to reach Britain stowed away in trucks, often from the European mainland. In the biggest tragedy, 58 Chinese were found dead in a tomato truck in 2000 at the port of Dover.\n\n\u201cWe read with heavy heart the reports about the death of 39 people in Essex,\u201d the Chinese Embassy said in a statement, adding further clarification was being sought with police.\n\nEssex police said their priority was ensuring dignity for the victims during their inquiry.\n\n\u201cEach of the 39 people must undergo a full coroner\u2019s process to establish a cause of death before we move on to attempting to identify each individual within the trailer,\u201d police said in a statement, saying that would be a time-consuming operation.\n\nPolice were given permission from local magistrates to detain the 25-year-old driver for an additional 24 hours on Thursday.\n\nThe trailer part of the truck arrived at Purfleet docks in Essex, southern England, from the Belgian port of Zeebrugge - as did the vehicle involved in 2000.\n\nIts red cab unit, which had \u201cIreland\u201d emblazoned on the windscreen along with the message \u201cThe Ultimate Dream, entered Britain via Holyhead in north Wales, having started its journey in Dublin, police said.\n\nFlowers are seen at the scene where bodies were discovered in a lorry container, in Grays, Essex, Britain October 24, 2019. REUTERS/Simon Dawson\n\nSECURE SITE\n\nThe discovery of the bodies was made at 1.40 a.m. just over an hour after the container arrived in Purfleet, not far from the industrial estate in Grays.\n\nThe vehicle has been moved to a secure site at nearby Tilbury Docks where forensic work can take place. Officials have set up a book of condolence at civic offices in Grays.\n\nThe National Crime Agency, which targets serious and organized crime, said it was helping the investigation and working urgently to identify any gangs involved.\n\nShaun Sawyer, national spokesman for British police on human trafficking, said thousands of people were seeking to come to the United Kingdom illegally. While they were able to rescue many of those smuggled in, Britain was perceived by organized crime as a potentially easy target for traffickers.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t turn the United Kingdom into a fortress. We have to accept that we have permeable borders,\u201d he told BBC radio.\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\nThe head of the Road Haulage Association said traffickers were \u201cupping their game\u201d and closer cooperation with European nations was needed, albeit that may be complicated by Britain\u2019s potential exit from the European Union.\n\n\u201cThere is simply not enough being done in terms of security, in terms of the protection of vehicles across Europe,\u201d Richard Burnett told BBC TV.", "description": "Police were given extra time on Thursday to question a driver arrested on suspicion of murder after 39 people, believed to be Chinese nationals, were found dead in a refrigerated truck near London, in an investigation focused on human trafficking.", "authors": ["Simon Dawson", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444508123&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N17A", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
