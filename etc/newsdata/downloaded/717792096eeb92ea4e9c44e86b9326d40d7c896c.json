Amazon this week just made grocery delivery free, so Walmart is now touting how its grocery service offers the booze. The retailer today announced a new milestone in terms of giving its customers the ability to shop for alcohol online, noting that more than 2,000 Walmart locations across 29 states will now let you pick up wine and beer along with your other grocery purchases.\n\nThe alcohol pickup service has to abide by local laws, which limits its expansion in some cases.\n\nIn addition, Walmart says that now more than 200 stores in California and Florida are also offering alcohol delivery. It plans expansions on this front, as well.\n\nWalmart has been slowly ramping up its online alcohol shopping options for some time, in accordance with local, county and state regulations. Its Sam\u2019s Club subsidiary has offered this option, too, by way of Instacart. In the latter case, Sam\u2019s Club has been able to offer delivery of spirits, like Tito\u2019s vodka or those from Sam\u2019s Club\u2019s own \u201cMember\u2019s Mark\u201d brand, among others.\n\nToday, there are a number of ways to shop alcohol online, depending on where you live.\n\nTarget-owned Shipt delivers alcohol from some of its supported retailers (including Target) in some markets. Instacart, BJ\u2019s and Amazon (Prime Now) do as well, in select cities, states and stores. And finally, services like Drizly, Saucey, Postmates and Uber Eats can help fill in the gaps, in some markets.\n\nThe problem with all these services is that consumers often don\u2019t know which retailers offer alcohol delivery, or which app they should use. If you live in a more permissive state, this may not be as big of a problem \u2014 you\u2019ll likely encounter an abundance of choices for same-day alcohol delivery. But in a more conservative state, your options may be more limited \u2014 or not available at all. And when consumers have to launch a half dozen apps just to figure out how to order booze online, most people will just give up and drive to the store.\n\nThat\u2019s in conflict with Walmart\u2019s larger goal, which is to allow shoppers to take advantage of its online grocery shopping to fully replace the traditional grocery shopping trip to the store. After all, if consumers are driving to the store, they\u2019ll likely choose their local grocer, not necessarily Walmart.\n\nTo meet the needs of the online shopper, Walmart Grocery has to offer it all \u2014 not just food, but also adult beverages. If successful on speeding this option to market, Walmart\u2019s brand could become known as the place to order online everything you need from the grocery store. And that, in turn, could help boost sales.\n\nWalmart\u2019s alcohol shopping feature works just like shopping for groceries \u2014 you search for what you want, add it to the cart, then check out. The only difference is that, upon pickup or delivery, you\u2019ll be required to show your ID so the Walmart team member can verify your age.\n\nAlcohol pickup is available in big states like California, Florida and Texas, and dozens of others, while delivery is limited to the first two states, for the time being.", "description": "The online grocery wars continue.
