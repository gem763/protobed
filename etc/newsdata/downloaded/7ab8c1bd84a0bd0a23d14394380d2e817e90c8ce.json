A much better campaign theme is hiding in plain sight. I call it \u201cthe Earth Race.\u201d\n\nIn the 1960s, John F. Kennedy energized the country behind a \u201cspace race\u201d: to make America the first nation to put a man on the moon. Democrats need to run against Trump on the Earth Race: to make America the leader in all policies and technologies that help men and women everywhere live sustainably here on Earth?\n\nYes, I know, mitigating climate change and saving the environment never poll well. But times change, and it depends how you frame the issue. Mother Nature is forcing herself onto the ballot, and Trump\u2019s efforts to roll back more than 80 rules and standards protecting clean air, water, climate, parks and wilderness make him uniquely vulnerable. He can\u2019t pivot away from what he\u2019s doing. He owns it, and it\u2019s villainous. This time is different.\n\nIn this era when so much activism is online, when was the last time you saw a bottom-up, mass movement of young people in America and across the world \u2014 some four million in all \u2014 take to the streets on every continent as they did last week to demand action to stop the heating of our planet? These young people are telling us, and their voting parents, that this issue is a political winner \u2014 theirs is a movement in search of courageous political leaders.", "description": "There is a winning campaign theme that progressives can use against Trump, and it isn\u2019t \u201cMedicare for all.\u201d", "authors": ["Thomas L.
