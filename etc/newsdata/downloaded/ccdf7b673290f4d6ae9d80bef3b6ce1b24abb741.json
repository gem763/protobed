According to the Times, two Ukrainian officials were also present.\n\nSondland, who\u2019s set to testify Thursday to House investigators, told the gathered officials that there were \u201cinvestigations that were dropped that need to be started up again,\u201d according to the Post.\n\nSondland said there was an agreement with Trump\u2019s acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney to arrange a meeting between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky if Ukraine opened up investigations, the Times reported.\n\nSondland\u2019s comments prompted Bolton to go \u201cballistic,\u201d the Post said.\n\nBolton reportedly told Hill to raise their concerns with White House lawyers about the backdoor diplomatic campaign by Giuliani, Sondland and Mulvaney.\n\n\u201cI am not part of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up,\u201d Hill recounted Bolton saying, according to two people present at her testimony cited by the Times.\n\nTrump fired Bolton last month.\n\nAt one point Hill confronted Sondland, who had no formal role overseeing policy in Ukraine. Sondland told Hill the president had put him in charge of Ukraine, Hill told lawmakers, according to the Times.\n\nBig impeachment week\n\nHill\u2019s appearance Monday was just the first of a series of closed-door depositions on Capitol Hill in what\u2019s shaping up to be the busiest week yet in the impeachment saga.\n\nThe Trump administration has fought to keep current and former officials from testifying, but haven\u2019t been able to stop everyone, including former Ukraine ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, who testified last week. Trump referred to her as \u201cbad news\u201d in a July 25 call with Zelensky, and her abrupt recall to Washington last spring is a key moment in the impeachment inquiry.\n\nThis week, lawmakers hope to hear from:\n\n\u2014Tuesday: George Kent, deputy assistant secretary of state\n\n\u2014Wednesday: Michael McKinley, former senior advisor to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\n\n\u2014Thursday: Gordon Sondland, EU Ambassador\n\n\u2014Friday: Laura Cooper, deputy assistant secretary of defense\n\nCover: Former National security adviser John Bolton gestures while speaking at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, Monday, Sept. 30, 2019.
