Tests proved that plants in which the gene is more prominently expressed are better able to survive drought.\n\nThe scientists believes this finding will have important implications for the cereal industry as it faces increasing challenges from climate crisis-related drought.\n\nPeter Morris from Heriot-Watt University led the research team. \u201cBy increasing the expression of this particular gene in test plants and simulating drought conditions, we\u2019ve been able to prove that plants in which HvMYB1 is more prominently expressed are able to survive prolonged periods of drought,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a significant finding that will allow more drought-resistant crops to be bred in the future.\n\n\u201cDrought is already impacting yields, with the European cereal harvest hit particularly hard in 2018. A prolonged, dry and hot summer significantly impacted yields and quality. As climate change gathers pace and we experience more extreme seasons, it is essential we can maintain continuity of supply.\u201d\n\nThe findings were published in the journal Plant Physiology and Biochemistry.", "description": "Research led by Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, will help crops resist global heating", "authors": ["Pa Media", "Damon Gameau"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c0a8153f69841924128c45acaf2bef684b382e0/0_622_2773_1664/master/2773.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f16e07449264fc902f823f4e31b43612"}
