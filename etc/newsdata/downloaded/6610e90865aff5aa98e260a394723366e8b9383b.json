There has no country in the world that leaks like we do. Washington is a leaking machine.\u201d\n\nTrump said the members of Congress he informed ahead of the raid were North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr and South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, both Republicans. Burr, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, is on what is known as the \u201cGang of Eight\u201d for intelligence-related matters: Senate and House leaders from both parties and the chairman and ranking members of the House and Senate intelligence committees.", "description": "", "authors": ["Nbcnews.Com Politics Donald-Trump"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
