We will not be commenting on what he will say to the Committees.\u201d\n\n\n\nMorrison\u2019s deposition in the impeachment hearings is highly significant as he is senior director for Europe and Russia in the national security council and is reported to have taken part in the 25 July phone call between Donald Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, which is at the core of the impeachment case.\n\nReports suggest he will confirm testimony by acting ambassador Bill Taylor and other witnesses, saying that Trump was putting pressure on Zelenskiy to investigate his political opponents.\n\nMorrison was brought into the NSC by John Bolton. The two share a ultra-hawkish attitude to arms control, opposing constraints on US military might. He is considered a Boltonite, not a Trumpite.", "description": "The former national security adviser would be the most high-profile figure to testify before the House investigating committees", "authors": ["Joan E Greve", "Julian Borger", "Moira Donegan", "Rebecca Solnit"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95bc9fe4ae6b5dfbdf9c9ebdde798f50467794fa/0_75_2288_1373/master/2288.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctbGl2ZS5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4089972372ad2fc107c27e33b37bf12b", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
