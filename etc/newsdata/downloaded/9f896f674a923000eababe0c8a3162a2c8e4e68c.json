Either way they'll be something to see", "language": "en", "published_at": "2019-09-04", "text": "The most significant game of the NFL\u2019s opening weekend is not Thursday\u2019s 100th anniversary celebration between Green Bay and Chicago, Sunday\u2019s prime-time clash between Pittsburgh and New England or even heavily hyped Cleveland finally taking the field.\n\nIt is what would otherwise be a diehards-only contest: Detroit at Arizona.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nEach finished at the bottom in their respective divisions last year and it would surprise no one if they wind up there again in 2019. Understandably, the game will be broadcast almost nowhere other than Arizona and Michigan.\n\nYet what happens, or what doesn\u2019t, could shape the way the NFL is played in the years to come.\n\n[Watch live NFL games all season long for free on the Yahoo Sports app.]\n\nLast offseason the Cardinals made either one of the boldest or one of the most ridiculous hires in recent history. They named Kliff Kingsbury their coach despite the 40-year-old having no NFL coaching experience and losing his job at Texas Tech for going 35-40, including 19-35 in the Big 12.\n\nKingsbury has few credentials and little credibility, yet he does have the promise of implementing the Air Raid offense that made him a star player at Tech, revolutionized the college game (including his coaching of Patrick Mahomes) and has increasingly influenced the NFL of late.\n\nIf a total embrace of a spread-style offense somehow works, then expect the league to go copycat, right down to starting a 5-foot-10 quarterback as Arizona will in top pick Kyler Murray, who as recently as a year ago was considered too small to play in the league.\n\nAnd if it doesn\u2019t, then expect the army of Kingsbury and spread-offense critics to howl in delight.\n\nMake no mistake: Plenty of coaches want to see Kliff Kingsbury fail with the Cardinals. That doesn't mean he's going to. (Getty)\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty-boy football,\u201d Oakland Raiders defensive back Lamarcus Joyner told ESPN. \u201cIt [doesn\u2019t] allow the defense to play the game physical like the game was meant to be. When you go against an offense like that, you have to introduce that physicality to them because they don\u2019t want to do that.\u201d\n\nMake no mistake, there is no NFL coach that other NFL coaches are hoping loses more than Kingsbury.\n\nAs a group, pro coaches are skeptical, if not downright disdainful, of college coaches who make the leap to the NFL (and take one of their precious 32 jobs). And those are generally the ones who won at that level.\n\nA college coach who didn\u2019t?\n\nAmong his peers Kingsbury is considered too young (40), too pretty (isn\u2019t he that dude from \u201cThe Notebook\u201d?) and too cute (his Forrest Gump-like ability to be around successful football people doesn\u2019t mean he paid his \u201cdues\u201d).\n\nBut what if it works? What if the reason he lost at Tech was a failure to recruit defensive talent to Lubbock (never a simple task), which is a moot skill in the NFL?\n\nWhat if on Sunday, the Cardinals and their undersized QB gash the Lions, who may not be a Super Bowl contender, but are coached by a defensive-minded Bill Belichick disciple in Matt Patricia?\n\nSuddenly this last-place scheduling abomination of a game has the feel of something \u2026 important?\n\n\u201cGuys know that it counts on Sunday,\u201d Kingsbury said. \u201cThe sense of urgency has definitely picked up.\u201d\n\nThe thing with Kingsbury is he isn\u2019t exactly what his haters want him to be.\n\nYes, he has the looks and the personality and all of that. He is also the son of a coach from a small town in Central Texas, and a moderately recruited player who embraced the novelty of the Air Raid at Tech under revolutionary coaches Spike Dykes and Mike Leach, and finished with a slew of then-NCAA records.\n\nHe was a sixth-round pick who hung around three seasons with five teams. Despite just attempting two passes (only one was completed) he can count as coaches or teammates Belichick, Tom Brady, Romeo Crennel, Josh McDaniels, Jim Haslett, Mike McCarthy, Herm Edwards and Doug Marrone, among others. He\u2019s famously friends with Sean McVay.\n\nAs a college assistant he grinded his way up under Art Briles, Kevin Sumlin and Dana Holgorsen, working long hours and learning everything he could.\n\n\u201cIncredible experience,\u201d Kingsbury said a few years back. \u201cI\u2019ve been very lucky. I\u2019ve tried to grab something from every one of those guys.\u201d\n\nArizona has bet its future on head coach Kliff Kingsbury and No. 1 pick Kyler Murray, who will try to replicate their spread success in the pros. (Getty)\n\nYes, he\u2019s young. But what exactly is paying your dues when you get a crash course like that?\n\nAs a coach, he has taught the quarterback position to no less than Mahomes, Baker Mayfield, Johnny Manziel and Case Keenum.\n\nNow he\u2019s going to try it again with Murray, who won the Heisman Trophy at Oklahoma but expected to be a professional baseball player before the NFL began shifting its opinion of the spread.\n\nCan this unorthodox combo of NFL coach and quarterback make the full, final leap for a league that is generally loathe to outsiders, let alone outside-the-box thinking?\n\nMaybe. The Cardinals\u2019 preseason offense hasn\u2019t been much, but it has also supposedly been hiding plenty.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve kept it really vanilla, super vanilla and super basic in the preseason,\u201d running back Chase Edmonds told azcardinals.com. \u201cAfter seeing some of the install plays we have, it\u2019s very creative. I can\u2019t wait for the opening up \u2026 it\u2019s kind of like Christmas, or Christmas Eve-type of deal.\u201d\n\nKingsbury has basically shrugged off questions.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s an ever-evolving game,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that is what makes it fun.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, we may see the fun. Or the future. Or just the start of a spectacular disaster.\n\nBut at least there should be something to see, which is more than you can usually say about a Lions-Cardinal game.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "If a total embrace of the spread-style offense somehow works, then expect the NFL to go copycat.
