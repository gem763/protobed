She made global headlines and was known as \u201cthe girl who silenced the world for five minutes\u201d.\n\nMany of the themes she spoke about in her speech \u2013 such as deforestation, mass extinction and air pollution \u2013 are key environmental issues we still grapple with today, a number of which have since been echoed by 16-year-old Swedish activist Greta Thunberg.\n\nAt the time of her speech there was a groundswell of interest in the environment, and climate change was starting to be talked about. A number of legally-binding agreements were put in place but there was no significant action as a result.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nSince then, another two billion people have joined the planet and the environment is in a more perilous state than ever before.\n\nDespite her calls for drastic change going unheeded, Cullis-Suzuki \u2013 who is now 39 years old and has been working as an environmental campaigner her whole life \u2013 says she thinks there is a \u201cmagical\u201d shift happening.\n\n\u201cNow that Greta has opened up this awareness about striking, civil disobedience and marching in the streets, that gives us so much hope. We need radical change and that\u2019s not going to happen unless people march in the streets,\u201d she says.\n\nCullis-Suzuki\u2019s 1992 speech at the UN summit in Rio de Janeiro had lots of parallels with Greta\u2019s speech in New York.\n\nCullis-Suzuki said: \u201cI\u2019m only a child and I don\u2019t have all the solutions, but I want you to realise, neither do you. If you don\u2019t know how to fix it, please stop breaking it.\n\n\u201cI am here to speak for all generations to come. I am here to speak for the countless animals dying across the planet because they have nowhere else to go.\n\n\u201cIn my life, I have dreamt of seeing the great herds of wild animals, jungles and rainforests full of birds and butterflies, but now I wonder if they will even exist for my children to see. You grown-ups say you love us but please, let your actions reflect your words.\u201d\n\nCullis-Suzuki was speaking on behalf of the Environmental Children\u2019s Organisation (Eco) which was made up of 12 and 13-year-olds, who had raised the money themselves to get to the summit.\n\nFor two weeks they tried to make people listen to what they had to say and then finally got invited to give a speech at the main event.\n\nCullis-Suzuki says she felt completely calm when she gave her speech.\n\n\u201cI knew exactly what I was doing I was so focused on the message, and I recognise that in Greta. She knows exactly what she\u2019s saying and I totally recognise that experience because I experienced it as well.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Greta is at a totally different scale. Social media has democratised platforms of expression so much \u2013 now a child can have a very loud voice.\n\n\u201cThere was increased lip service after my speech. I\u2019m not sure there was increased action.\u201d\n\nShe says change must now happen.\n\n\u201cWe do not have a choice. On an individual level people love their children. When I was a child that was something I spoke about \u2013 I was basically asking adults to make their actions reflect their words,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cIf in 27 years if we do nothing, the world will be so different who knows how the UN would function.
