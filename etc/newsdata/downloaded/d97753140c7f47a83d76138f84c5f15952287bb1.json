But this week was different.\n\nOne of the main characters in Dervla McTiernan\u2019s The Ruin uses a feature in Google Maps called Timeline to find a lost phone. In a note at the end of the book she explains that she didn't want to use a feature like Find My iPhone or anything that would have needed to be installed previously because she wanted it to be realistic and not just a convenient solution.\n\nGoogle came to her rescue with the Timeline function it enabled in 2015, which is a record of everywhere you've been, what route you took to get there and what types of transport you used.\n\nAsking around my friendship group of reasonably tech-savvy Millennials, I didn't find a single person who knew about this feature. But when I got them to open up their phones and bring up their Timelines there was a perfect record of where they lived, worked, ate lunch and went to the gym, plus all sorts of other information such as how long they spent on the train each day, what time they arrived at and departed work and how much walking they did. Each day had a map of their activity, dating back years.\n\nWhile most were amazed there was such an accurate transcript of their daily activity, none was surprised Google had been recording this data, nor that they weren't aware of its existence.", "description": "Google Maps' Timeline feature demonstrates why major tech companies must ensure their users know how their data is recorded, stored and for how long.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1576%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/fb3ac47a23c626939a2e66c99d1ee90e862596c7", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
