I\u2019m so fucking glad we got Osuna!\u2019 The outburst was offensive and frightening enough that another Houston staffer apologized.\u201d\n\nThe Astros\u2019 initially rebutted the story, saying \u201c[Taubman\u2019s] comments had everything to do with the game situation that just occurred and nothing else\u201d, and accusing the magazine of \u201cfabricating\u201d the report. Days later, after an MLB investigation, the Astros fired Taubman and said his behavior had been inappropriate. They also apologized to Apstein.\n\nAstros lose World Series opener to Nats after sordid week off the field Read more\n\nOn Sunday, Apstein tweeted a photo of a letter from Crane that she received on Saturday. \u201cWe were wrong and I am sorry that we initially questioned your professionalism,\u201d Crane wrote. \u201cWe retract that statement, and I assure you that the Houston Astros will learn from this experience.\u201d\n\nThe Astros are tied 2-2 with the Washington Nationals in the best-of-seven World Series.
