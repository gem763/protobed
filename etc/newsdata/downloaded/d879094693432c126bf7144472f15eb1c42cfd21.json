In contrast, 67% of Democrats think colleges have an overall positive effect.\n\nMeanwhile, employer beneficiaries of the system say they can't find employees with the skills they seek.\n\nAll of this is crashing down on the higher education system, which now has to figure out a new way to serve students \u2014 and society.\n\nThey're deploying AI and predictive analytics to try to prevent students from falling through the cracks of the system.\n\nand predictive analytics to try to prevent students from falling through the cracks of the system.
