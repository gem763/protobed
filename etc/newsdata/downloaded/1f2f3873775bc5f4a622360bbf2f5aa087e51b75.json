It picks up with Biden recounting his stint as a teenaged lifeguard at a city pool in a black neighborhood in Wilmington. One day, says Joe, a local gangster who went by the name of \u2026 \u201cCorn Pop\u201d dropped by with a few other members of his gang \u2014 \u201cthe Romans\u201d \u2014 and began bouncing up and down on the diving board. Get offa there, Esther Williams!, said Joe to Corn Pop. (Google \u201cEsther Williams\u201d if you must.) Corn Pop didn\u2019t care for that, and Biden was made to understand that the Romans would be waiting for him outside after his shift with straight razors.\n\nAt which point, if you believe Joe, the future vice president of the United States had a six-foot length of chain cut for him right there on the spot and went outside to inform Mr. Pop that he\u2019d wrap the chain around his head if he came by and misbehaved again.\n\nBut somehow it all worked out with everyone becoming friends, as you\u2019ll see.\n\nIf this smells like a BS cake frosted with BS and filled with a warm, oozy BS ganache, that\u2019s how it smelled to Harriot too. \u201cCorn Pop\u201d and \u201cthe Romans\u201d sound like what a gang in a Broadway musical would be named. It\u2019s Biden\u2019s version of \u201cT-Bone,\u201d Cory Booker\u2019s mysterious teary-eyed drug-pushing friend from Newark whom no one\u2019s ever been able to locate.\n\nBut I have a surprise ending for you: Biden might be telling the truth. Watch the second clip in this Mediaite post and you\u2019ll see that former Delaware NAACP President Richard Smith *also* remembers Corn Pop. And he remembers that Biden \u201cstood his ground\u201d during the confrontation between them, albeit without the detail about him wielding a chain like Mad Max.\n\nWhich leaves us where, exactly? At every point in this story, Biden seems like he\u2019s five seconds away from saying that he tied an onion to his belt, as was the style of the time. And yet, if you believe Smith, his memory of this 55-year-old incident is largely accurate. What if Joe actually has a mind like a steel trap and he\u2019s just terrible at expressing himself?\n\nAnyway, no Democratic primary voters are going to care whether this is true or false, so he has that going for him.", "description": "Chains.", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend", "Jazz Shaw", "John Sexton", "Taylor Millard"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/jb-2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
