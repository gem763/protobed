Even as geopolitical uncertainty persists, most economists agree that a 50 basis point cut is unlikely.\n\n\u201cThe Fed is almost certain to cut its policy rate by another 25bp at next week\u2019s FOMC meeting to between 1.75% and 2.00%,\u201d Capital Economics wrote in a note Friday. \u201cBut rising core inflation, the still-solid incoming activity data and the temporary thaw in the US-China trade war all support our view that the Fed will then skip a meeting, before cutting rates one final time in December.\u201d\n\nWhile economists and the market agree on a 25 basis point cut this week, views are divided on what the Fed\u2019s monetary policy path will look like for the rest of this year. JPMorgan economists argue that after this week\u2019s rate cut, no additional cuts are expected this year; however, Capital Economics believes one more cut in December looms. The Fed\u2019s message will be critical for markets.\n\nGiven the two dissents at the July FOMC meeting, it is evident that policymakers are conflicted.\n\n\u201cWe expect dissents, potentially on both sides,\u201d Bank of America said in a note Friday. \u201cWe think it is very likely that Kansas City Fed's George and Boston Fed's Rosengren dissent in favor of rates on hold. Not enough has changed in the outlook to convince them of the need for additional cuts. It is possible we also have a dovish dissent from St Louis Fed's Bullard who would favor a 50bp cut. We suspect he will be OK with a 25bp cut and dovish language in the statement, but it remains an outstanding risk. In any event, the dissents will highlight that a division remains in the Committee. It\u2019s up to Fed Chair Powell to deliver the dovish tone that the market expects.\u201d\n\nIn addition, Fed Chair Powell\u2019s messaging and tone will be closely monitored at the press conference following the FOMC\u2019s decision. \u201cThe press conference itself is difficult to forecast,\u201d UBS wrote in a note Friday. \u201cOur expectation is that Powell will want to sound slightly dovish to maintain a bias toward easing. Doing so will preserve market pricing, which Powell has stressed has caused the easing in financial conditions this year.\u201d\n\nFed chair Jerome Powell (AP) More\n\nSeparately on Wednesday at 10 a.m. ET, executives from the big tech companies will be headed to Capitol Hill to testify before the Senate Commerce Committee. Facebook\u2019s Global Policy Management Head Monika Bickert, Twitter\u2019s Public Policy Director Nick Pickles and Google\u2019s Global Director of Information Policy Derek Slater are expected to attend the hearing on the proliferation of extremism online and how technology companies are working with law enforcement.\n\nMeanwhile, turmoil for commodities. Oil will be closely monitored following attacks on Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil production facility in Abqaiq and an oil field in Khurais on Saturday. Abqaiq is the largest oil processing plant in the world, and the attack will leave about half of the kingdom\u2019s oil capacity crippled. According to S&P Global Platts Analytics, oil prices could shoot up to $70 to $80 per barrel as a result of the attack. Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels claimed responsibility for the attacks; however, the U.S. is suspecting that the attacks likely originated from either Iraq or Iran. As more developments emerge, market watchers can expect increased volatility in the oil markets this week.\n\nWhile the corporate earnings report schedule remains light, investors can expected quarterly financial results from Adobe, Chewy and FedEx this week.", "description": "Investors will turn their attention to Washington this week, as the Federal Open Market Committee gears up for its two-day meeting and representatives from big tech companies head to Capitol Hill to testify.", "authors": ["Heidi Chung"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/LRVUzeg7KwmwBmIYOSVpmA--~B/aD0zNDI5O3c9NTE0MztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-07/434748c0-b3d2-11e9-b57b-7d9815c6118f", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
