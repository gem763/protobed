The market\u2019s inherent suspicion of these deals has clearly not faded, and in Latitude\u2019s case there was particularly concerns about the possibility that there has been an under-investment in technology, given IT spending in the 2020 financial year was to double compared with 2018.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a fintech. Not really. Yes, there was technology there, and robust credit models that were built, tested and tweaked well before anyone got excited about algorithms that do the same thing.\n\nBut Latitude looks and feels more like an old-school consumer finance business than a low-cost online lender just getting started. The company\u2019s new foray in the fintech buy now, pay later space, was promising but untested.\n\nIt was leveraged to the health of the consumer - and one that is already heavily indebted.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a growth stock. The 5.8 per cent yield on offer was clearly attractive in a low rate environment, but it appears to have put Latitude in the value basket for many investors - who then rightly thought hard about buying a business from KKR and chief executive Ahmed Fahour, who was to receive a bonus of $22 million in shares not for growing the business, but for listing it.\n\nIt was exposed to regulatory risk in a landscape still shifting after the royal commission. It is understood international investors were particularly jittery around this, and struggled to differentiate between the pain being experienced by the banks, and Latitude, which hasn\u2019t seen anything like this.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a business with strong consumer brands. Latitude\u2019s history was as the provider of white label products for other firms, particularly key retail partners such as Harvey Norman, JB Hi-Fi and The Good Guys. Fahour was trying to change this but developing the Latitude brand across his product range, and to some success. But the float was very early in this still incomplete process.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe timing of this float was and wasn\u2019t right.\n\nThe Latitude camp argued that in the last year alone, the big banks have reduced consumer lending by about 30 per cent, with Latitude growing its market share in this sector 9 per cent to 13 per cent. That put it at it number three in this market, behind Commonwealth Bank and Westpac, but ahead of NAB and ANZ.\n\nBut the fragility of the Australian economy \u2013 perhaps best underlined by the Reserve Bank cutting official interest rates to a new record low of 0.75 per cent just six days after the Latitude released its prospectus \u2013 would have given many institutional fund managers pause. How much exposure do investors really want to heavily indebted consumers with rates at emergency levels?\n\nHindsight is a wonderful thing of course, and this columnist has to admit that he is surprised that the Latitude float has failed to get altitude.\n\nWith rates so low, and investors so desperate for returns, it just felt that 5.8 per cent yield would be attractive enough, particularly given it was backed by a stable business that was expected to deliver a cash profit of $287.6 million in the year to June 30 2020, up from $248.4 million in the 2018 financial year, before Fahour arrived.\n\nWhen the prospectus was released in late September, I also said Fahour was the right sort of front man to take Latitude out of the shadows \u2013 as the back-end provider of finance for the likes of Harvey Norman and JB H-Fi \u2013 and build the consumer brand that could help differentiate the business. And clearly he was highly motivated to get the deal away.\n\nBut in the end, Fahour, KKR and brokers Goldman Sachs, Macquarie Capital and UBS just couldn\u2019t get generate the buzz required to get the deal over the line.\n\nDid Fahour\u2019s $51 million pay package take some if the attention away from the Latitude growth story? Possibly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the biggest problem was the investors couldn\u2019t get comfortable that Latitude had a strong enough competitive advantage.\n\nYes, the relationships with big retailers provided strong channels for customer acquisition, and Latitude\u2019s base of 2.6 million customers was sizeable. But the rise and rise of buy now, pay later firms such as Afterpay in recent years has shown underscored that these retail partnerships did not represent barriers against competition.\n\nAt the same time, credit cards and personal loans are fairly commoditised products, and given Latitude was only at the start of the journey to becoming a consumer-facing brand, it could hardly claim and particularly advantages in this market \u2013 perhaps beyond an ability to lend where the banks weren\u2019t.\n\nIt seems highly unlikely KKR and its fellow owners would attempt a third run at the ASX boards. So the bigger question becomes what will it actually take for private equity-backed floats to shrug off the distrust of the market? Right now that\u2019s very hard to answer.", "description": "It wasn\u2019t one thing that killed the float of Latitude Financial for a second time, but many.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.7811%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/1ebdc7031c00410efa9c3fd2f10fa34eea05288a", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
