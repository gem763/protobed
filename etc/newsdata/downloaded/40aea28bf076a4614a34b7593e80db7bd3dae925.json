The guy I play, Travis Stubbs, works in an office cubicle in the early 90s. He is stuck in a job he hates and not happy about where he is in life, but he has aspirations. He wants to look like a successful businessman but he doesn\u2019t have much style or taste. Bad style in the early 90s gives you a plethora of horrible, horrible outfits. It was one of my favourite characters to create in terms of the look and the hair. It\u2019s always fun when you create a character who looks different from the way they feel. He has bought into a pyramid scheme, so in order to recruit more people he wants to look important and successful. We had a lot of fun putting together some ostentatious and quite tacky outfits, culminating in a very ill-fitting tuxedo.\n\nGoing to costume fittings is always instrumental, for me, in finding the character. I spend hours thinking: \u201cWhat kind of shoe would this guy wear? What kind of jacket?\u201d It\u2019s always a collaboration between me and the costume designer and I will agonise over an outfit \u2013 if I find a great pair of shoes, but they are slightly the wrong colour, that can bother me a lot.\n\nIn my personal life, I don\u2019t pay much attention to what I wear \u2013 it\u2019s the other end of the spectrum and I like to just switch off. I don\u2019t have the energy to spend more than two minutes thinking about it in the morning and so I pretty much wear the same thing every day. That is not to say I\u2019m not interested in clothes \u2013 it can be fun to dress up for an event \u2013 but that\u2019s a special occasion. I never \u201cput together an outfit\u201d if I\u2019m just running around New York or Stockholm. I have always been allergic to clothes that are not comfortable \u2013 as much as I love the look of a wool sweater, I can\u2019t wear them because they\u2019re too itchy. I gravitate towards soft fabrics.\n\nAlexander Skarsg\u00e5rd is the face of the new global campaign from Clarks shoes.", "description": "The actor talks about 90s style, itchy jumpers and how he pays much more attention to his characters\u2019 outfits than his own", "authors": ["As Told To Leah Harper"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/447d1b5b661627f0c5973c496895a7598d57f442/0_92_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a36d91dd49ac01533932c019ee11961d", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
