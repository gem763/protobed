He was a starter for most of this season, but when he first transitioned to the bullpen, veteran relievers alerted him to situations the team might need him in before they happened. That calculus never would have occurred to him as a starter, but he now understood. He thought: \u201cYou know who I should tell? The guy who\u2019s going to pitch.\u201d\n\nThe young right-hander walked down the tunnel and over to the veteran, sitting and watching in the bullpen. The potential domino effect surprised Strasburg, but it made sense. He got up to stretch.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI didn't really think about that,\u201d Strasburg said later. \u201cGood looking out on him.\u201d\n\nNationals storm back late in wild-card game to stun Brewers, 4-3, advance to NLDS\n\nThe situation played out exactly as Fedde suspected. Brian Dozier pinch-hit, then Strasburg entered in the sixth and he held the Nationals\u2019 two-run deficit long enough for the heroics of Juan Soto, who in the eighth inning smacked a single to right field that, along with an error by Trent Grisham, delivered a 4-3 win on Tuesday night. The victory meant more to Strasburg because of the long, difficult road it took to overcome the team\u2019s poor start to the season and get here.\n\n\u201cSometimes it's nice to kind of be considered the underdog or for people to write you off,\u201d he said. \u201cI would say a lot of people in this city wrote us off. But it's nice for us to stick together \u2018cause that only made us pull for each other even more, proving everybody wrong.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nStrasburg had pitched in 273 major league games before this, but his 274th was the first time he\u2019s entered in relief. The veteran right-hander\u2019s three scoreless innings were crucial against a Brewers lineup that Scherzer struggled to quiet as they tagged him for a pair of home runs. Scherzer\u2019s rough start, and Strasburg\u2019s sterling finish, reignited frustration that Strasburg didn\u2019t start to begin with.\n\nThis was Strasburg\u2019s regular start day, and something Manager Dave Martinez stressed as key to Strasburg\u2019s season \u2014 one of the most dominant and durable of his career \u2014 was consistent routine between starts. Not disrupting Strasburg\u2019s flow was one of the main arguments, other than recent performance, to start Strasburg instead of Scherzer. But the Nationals opted for Scherzer and asked Strasburg, their second-best pitcher all year, to come out of the bullpen. He was on board. The outing worked just as the Nationals scripted, starting in a clean inning and ending with zeros.\n\n\u201cYou're talking about big-boy baseball right there,\u201d General Manager Mike Rizzo said. \u201cYou're talking about your horse that you're relying on. [Strasburg] came out and did it for the name on the front of the jersey more than the name on the back. That's the type of pitcher he's been since he got here.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe treasured routine didn\u2019t even need to be changed. Strasburg did everything he would on a start day \u2014 stretching, studying, pregame throwing \u2014 except with the relievers instead of starting catcher Kurt Suzuki. Nothing felt out of the ordinary for Strasburg. Not trying something new with the season on the line. Not facing a deficit with his team\u2019s season on the line. Not even running in from the bullpen.\n\n\u201cI do a lot of running, so it was no different,\u201d he said. \u201cI'm pretty used to that by now.\u201d\n\n\u2018Finally caught a break tonight\u2019: Nats take a tortured history and flip the script\n\nTeammates respected the approach. They might have felt different during the game \u2014 Fedde got chills watching Strasburg run out of the bullpen because, \u201cit\u2019s like, he\u2019s one of the faces of this franchise\u201d \u2014 but they tried not to betray it. When he got to the mound in the sixth, all Suzuki asked was which code they wanted to use with a runner on second to prevent sign-stealing.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe approach against the Brewers\u2019 batters changed when Strasburg entered. Suzuki wouldn\u2019t say what exactly, but it was designed to \u201cslow \u2018em down a little bit.\u201d Strasburg stayed true to his arsenal \u2014 using his curveball and four-seam fastball on about half his pitches, complementing them with a change-up and two-seam fastball \u2014 and it worked. He sailed through three frames, striking out four and navigating around two hits.\n\nWhen it was over, when the Nationals sprinted onto the field in disbelief, when a night full of improbable events reached its stunning conclusion, Strasburg was one of the first teammates they turned to mob.\n\nMinutes later, Strasburg walked out of the Nationals clubhouse in a red shirt with the curly W logo and workout shorts. He beelined for the family room a few steps away. There was a cry of \u201cDaddy!\u201d and Strasburg emerged holding his young daughter in the crook of his right arm. His older daughter trailed behind as they headed back to the clubhouse, back to the celebration.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNot long after, the girls nowhere in sight, Strasburg stood on the outside of his teammates\u2019 celebration circle. The player as responsible for this celebration as anyone watched as others shook up bottles and sprayed them. He just smiled and sipped on a can of Budweiser. Not until teammate Aaron Barrett doused him with a beer did Strasburg slide his goggles over his eyes.\n\nThe party was raucous \u2014 whistles chirping and bass lines pounding and alcohol flying everywhere \u2014 but those who understood the gravity of what Strasburg had done found him in the quieter moments. Pitching coach Paul Menhart pulled him in for a hug. Catcher Yan Gomes pounded him on the chest. Martinez leaned in and told him, \u201cGood job.\u201d\n\nThen Strasburg spotted Fedde and waved him over. The younger pitcher craned over a white folding table as the veteran talked in a low voice. Strasburg thanked Fedde in a few words of his own because, without that heads up, who knows what would have happened. They might not have been standing there at all.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRead more Nationals coverage:\n\nThe Nationals\u2019 wild-card win was both thrilling and emotionally exhausting.
