That is a terrible abuse of the president\u2019s power. Now whether that abuse goes further, that is the withholding of military aid also as leverage. There\u2019s certainly strong indications that that is true as well. And we\u2019re going to get to the bottom of it.\n\nThe alleged quid pro quo is at the center of the Democrats\u2019 impeachment probe \u2014 pursued by the House Committees on Oversight and Reform, Intelligence, and Foreign Affairs.\n\nAn intelligence community \u201cwhistleblower\u201d accused Trump of trying to coerce Ukraine into investigating corruption allegations against Biden and his son in exchange for aid. The accusation of a quid pro quo, allegedly offered during a July 25 call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, ultimately triggered the impeachment probe.\n\nTrump and Zelensky have denied the accusations.\n\nRepublican lawmakers have accused Schiff of cherry-picking and misrepresenting evidence gathered so far to fuel his impeachment agenda.\n\nReps. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), Mark Meadows (R-NC), and Lee Zeldin (R-NY), who have witnessed the depositions provided so far, leveled the accusations against Schiff.\n\nRep. Zeldin has said the testimony provided by former U.S. special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker obliterates the Democrats\u2019 claim of a quid pro quo offer.\n\nSchiff, however, has refused to release the transcript of Volker\u2019s testimony to the public. Instead, the chairman has released bits and pieces of the evidence Volker provided.\n\nIn a series of texts provided by Volker, Gordon Sondland, the United States Ambassador to the European Union, also said, \u201cno quid pro quo of any kind\u201d took place between Trump and Zelensky.\n\nOn Monday, Jordan and Zeldin, who have defended Trump during the ongoing impeachment probe, called on Schiff to release the transcripts of all the impeachment inquiry testimonies provided so far.\n\nOn Face the Nation, Schiff defended conducting the impeachment inquiry behind closed doors.", "description": "Adam Schiff indicated the Democrats' impeachment efforts are not contingent upon evidence of a Ukraine-linked quid pro quo offer.", "authors": ["Edwin Mora"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Shifty-Eyed-Shift-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
