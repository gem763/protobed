Recommendations are separate from any business incentives.\n\nWhen we want new furniture for our office here at Reviewed, we get it online. There\u2019s no way our team would ever have the bandwidth to visit multiple brick-and-mortar stores\u2014we\u2019re all busy testing products, looking for great deals, and writing articles for our readers.\n\nWhen we recently built a new test kitchen here, it was clear that we could use a sturdy dining table nearby. So we headed online to Home Depot. One of the world\u2019s largest home improvement retailers, Home Depot is also in the business of helping to furnish homes. The company\u2019s Home Decorators Collection offers reasonably-priced furniture and d\u00e9cor in a variety of styles that look comforting and familiar.\n\nDoes it work to buy furniture online? It depends on what you want, where you look, and how much you have to spend. Here\u2019s how it went for us.\n\nChoosing Home Depot furniture\n\nCredit: Reviewed / Betsey Goldwasser Home Depot's Aldridge table is very sturdy, made of solid wood. This style will work well in a casual farmhouse dining room.\n\nAfter clicking through pictures of tables, we settled on the Aldridge Extendable Dining Table. A rustic, solid-looking table with a pedestal style that was also extendable, it fit our criteria. It\u2019s also a best seller on the Home Depot site, where owners give it 4 out of 5 stars.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFor seating, we purchased an Aldridge Washed Wood Dining Bench. We have a conference room near the kitchen with plenty of chairs, so we didn\u2019t order any, but using a bench on one side of a table has many advantages. First, a bench is ideal when your table resides in front of a window because it doesn\u2019t block the view. Second, unlike a chair, which seats one person at a time, seating at a bench is limited only by the number and size of its occupants. One bench probably has room for a group of kids.\n\nShould you buy furniture online? It depends on what you want, where you look, and how much you have to spend.\n\nSarah Fishburne, Home Depot\u2019s director of trend and design, gave us more insight into our selections. \u201cRustic yet sophisticated, the Aldridge Collection dining table and bench are easily some of the most loved pieces from Home Decorators Collection,\u201d she said. \u201cCrafted from solid mango wood, the table\u2019s classic look is enhanced by the sweeping curves on its trestle base. The versatile finishes of the furniture\u2014Antique Grey, Antique Walnut, and Washed Black\u2014help to make it a statement piece in almost any surrounding.\u201d\n\nHow easy is Home Depot furniture to assemble?\n\nCredit: Reviewed / Betsey Goldwasser Our operations manager says it takes about 30 minutes to assemble the Aldridge table and he suggests inviting a friend to help because the pieces are heavy.\n\nThe Aldridge table is big and heavy, weighing in at over 250 pounds. It arrived in three separate boxes and needed assembly. The bench was packaged in a single box and also needed to be assembled. Our operations manager put them both together and he reported that these pieces were not difficult to assemble, assuming that you lay the pieces out correctly. Given the size and bulkiness of the components, he thinks it\u2019s safe to say that it will take about 30 minutes for assembly, and suggests that you get a friend to assist.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhat we like\n\nCredit: Home Depot The Aldridge table is versatile\u2014yiou can dress up its casual style by adding comfy chairs.\n\nWe invited our colleagues to bring their laptops to the table, sit down, and work for a bit. We left a questionnaire for them to fill out, based on their experience sitting at the table. Here\u2019s what the testers liked:\n\nThe bench is pretty comfortable\n\nWhile our testers didn\u2019t think they would want to sit on the hard bench for a long time, they were comfortable enough to sit there for a short duration, for example, during an average meal. If your style of entertaining includes long dinner parties, your guests might be more comfortable sitting on cushioned chairs.\n\nThe table is a comfortable height\n\nIt fit most of our staffers comfortably. Still, taller people commented that they couldn\u2019t cross their legs underneath while sitting on the bench.\n\nThe furniture appears to be durable\n\nIn the short term, they didn\u2019t believe it would scratch or splinter. This is a very solid set. It doesn't have veneers\u2014it's all wood. This table looks like it would last for a long time.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe style is appropriate for a casual home\n\nThis set could work with a farmhouse or rustic aesthetic. It's substantial though it is definitely not fancy. You could cover the table with a pretty runner or tablecloth to dress it up but it's definitely for a more casual home.\n\nWhat we don't like\n\nCredit: Reviewed / Betsey Goldwasser This sold table has a wax finish on top to repel stains. Since the top is textured, we wonder if a sticky spill will require a lot of scrubbing.\n\nNo piece of furniture is perfect. Here\u2019s what our testers thought:\n\nThe color isn\u2019t what we expected\n\nAlthough it\u2019s called Antique Gray, the color of the pieces is actually closer to taupe. It doesn\u2019t match our kitchen\u2019s blue-gray cabinets. The table and bench come in two other colors, Antique Walnut (brown) and Washed Black, which might have matched our kitchen better.\n\nThe wood stain has variations\n\nMost of our testers didn\u2019t like the way that the wood stain was much darker on the pedestals than on the tabletop. But one person said that it made the furniture look more interesting.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe top has a waxy finish on the table's surface\n\nOur testers didn\u2019t love the way the finish looked on the tabletop. One colleague thought it made the piece look like it was made of engineered wood. Testers were split on whether spilled mashed potatoes would be easy to clean up. While we didn't have any potatoes handy, we tried spilling some water on the tabletop, and it didn't sink in or leave a stain. Our concern is that, since the top is textured, it might take some scrubbing to clean up sticky spills. However, several online reviewers wrote that the finish is stain- and heat-resistant.\n\nShould you buy this table and bench from Home Depot?\n\nIf your home is farmhouse or rustic in style and you\u2019re looking for a solid wood dining set, you should consider it. Testers thought the table and bench would work for both casual and more formal meals. Remember, you\u2019ll need to get some chairs or another bench to seat the family. And if you buy it, find a strong friend to help you set it up\u2014the sturdy table is very heavy.\n\nGet the Aldridge Extendable Dining Table from Home Depot for $1,499\n\nGet the Aldridge Washed Wood Dining Bench from Home Depot for $342\n\nThe product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered.
