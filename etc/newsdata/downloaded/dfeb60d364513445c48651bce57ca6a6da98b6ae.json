Col. Alexander Vindman, who has now shaken up the impeachment investigation into President Trump by corroborating the account of a whistleblower who said the president and others sought to pressure Ukraine to take action against Trump\u2019s political opponents.\n\nReading Vindman\u2019s remarks, I was struck by how impossible his biography would be anywhere but the United States of America. And I was also struck by the irony of the attacks that emerged against Vindman on Tuesday, implying that his roots in then-Soviet Ukraine make his loyalty to the United States suspect: They sounded so similar to attitudes about Jews in the Soviet Union that drove his family to flee here in the first place.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIf you know any Russian-speaking Jewish immigrants \u2014 people like me, and people like Vindman \u2014 chances are you have encountered engineers, mathematicians and programmers. It\u2019s not a coincidence. Like other Jewish communities around the world, Soviet Jews prized education and accomplishment. But unlike American Jews in the second half of the 20th century, Jews in the Soviet Union found that entire professions were functionally closed off to them. Especially those related to national security.\n\nThese restrictions dated back decades. After the 1917 revolution, czarist-era discriminatory policies against Jews were lifted, and many Soviet Jews embraced the opportunities afforded to them under the new Communist regime. Despite policies that violently suppressed religious and ethnic expression \u2014 including the persecution of rabbis, Zionists, and Yiddish and Hebrew cultural figures \u2014 millions of Soviet Jews embraced the Russian language and culture as their own. They assimilated into Soviet culture, losing their native tongue (Yiddish) and cultural markers like kosher cuisine, which for centuries had distinguished Jewish communities and cuisines the world over from that of their gentile neighbors. In place of their traditional culture, they pursued careers in academia, security and foreign affairs with vigor to contribute to a nation that, for the first time, afforded them real opportunities, even as those opportunities came with a tremendous cost.\n\nBut in the 1930s under Joseph Stalin, a brutal dictator who would later pursue more violently anti-Semitic policies, the merit-based system began to erode. Fields that were sensitive for national security such as diplomacy, intelligence and foreign trade began correcting for Jews being \u201coverrepresented\u201d by shutting their doors to Jewish applicants. Anti-Semitic beliefs about the true loyalty of Jews were widespread in the Soviet Union, as they had been in pre-revolutionary Russia, and many of these discriminatory, paranoid policies were retained long after Stalin had been repudiated. The doors left open in their wake were opened haphazardly and were limited to nonpolitical pursuits such as science and technology. The message to Jews was clear: You will never be a real Soviet.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe generation of Soviet Jews to follow, including Vindman\u2019s father, were thus in an impossible bind: They spoke the same language, ate the same foods and served in the same Red Army as their neighbors. What made them so different that they could never be trusted?\n\nI know these questions and the decisions that followed their answers because these are the stories I and countless other American children of Soviet Jews grew up on. Stories of humiliation at the hands of teachers who made Jews identify themselves in class; of hoodlums beating Jews for sport; of career and higher education opportunities being denied because of the dreaded fifth line of their passports that marked their nationality not as Soviet, but as Jews. This was not the genteel anti-Semitism found in the West that you catch at the edge of a remark, but rather the anti-Semitism that, as my mother put it, made you feel as if the person who encountered you just smelled excrement.\n\nFed up with this pervasive anti-Semitism, Soviet Jews began to advocate for themselves when they began to piece their lives back together after the double tragedy of World War II and the Holocaust. Even in the face of state persecution in the form of lost jobs, poverty and even deportation to the dreaded gulag for prominent leaders, they pressed on. Many did so because they answered a question no parent wants to ask: Do my children have a future here?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn the Soviet Union, it was clear to over 1.5 million Jews who eventually escaped that the answer was no \u2014 Jews had no future there. Like countless others who made the life-changing choice to come to America, the Soviet Jews who fled here sought a better life for themselves and their children. Vindman\u2019s family arrived in 1979, and they found exactly what they were looking for. Here, the son of a poor refugee can become a decorated Army officer who serves his country with honor. He can attend his nation\u2019s most prestigious university. He can have a Jewish wedding while wearing his nation\u2019s uniform and see no contradiction between the two. And he can become a policy adviser serving at the highest levels of government.\n\nBut now partisan attacks against Vindman are trafficking in prejudices that are all too familiar for Jewish refugees from the Soviet Union. As former Republican congressman and now CNN contributor Sean P. Duffy said: \u201cWe all have an affinity to our homeland where we came from. \u2026 He has an affinity for the Ukraine.\u201d\n\nDuffy later walked back his comments. But a whole host of attacks that call Vindman\u2019s loyalty into question and accuse him of treason for speaking the languages of the region he fled as a child and ensuring American national security interests are pursued have now been levied at a man who received a Purple Heart for wounds sustained after an IED attack in Iraq.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThese attacks are disgraceful not just because they are directed at a man with a textbook patriotic biography, not just because they open old wounds for Soviet Jewish refugees, not because they echo centuries-old slurs against Jews the world over. They\u2019re also disgraceful because they play into the propaganda of countries such as Russia, which are intent on pursuing an aggressive foreign policy at the expense of neighboring nations such as Ukraine. They accomplish it by muddying the waters and distracting from international criticisms with whataboutisms such as telling the world that there\u2019s nothing exceptional about America.\n\nLt. Col. Alexander Vindman has lived a life that would be unimaginable even very recently to Russian-speaking Jews. His accomplishments, achieved while committing his professional life to serving our nation, are a testament to what is possible in America when we live up to the ideals that attracted millions of immigrants from every corner of the globe to this great nation. In his remarks on Capitol Hill, Vindman said: \u201cI am a patriot, and it is my sacred duty and honor to advance and defend OUR country, irrespective of party or politics.\u201d Partisan critics demonizing this immigrant, among many others they have demonized, would do well to instead follow a true patriot\u2019s example.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Such pernicious accusations are part of the reason Jews fled for the safety of America.", "authors": ["Alex Zeldin", "Alex Zeldin Is A New York-Based Writer", "Analyst", "Focusing On Issues Of U.S. Foreign Policy", "Jewish Communal Affairs."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/A3CHSJomjN5HvWVlRPxkGhGVGmQ=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/B656HOULVFECTLAEKQTVU6XWLI", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
