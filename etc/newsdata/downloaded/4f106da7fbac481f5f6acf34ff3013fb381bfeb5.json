That shows you how much trust he has in the younger players to put you on in such a tight game.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018It finished 2-2, which wasn\u2019t the result I hoped for, but it made my dream come true of playing in the Premier League.\u2019\n\nFollowing his substitute appearance against Sheffield United, Gilmour had to wait until last month for his second first-team outing of the campaign against Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup.\n\nAlthough Gilmour didn\u2019t get on the scoresheet during Chelsea\u2019s 7-1 thrashing of the League Two side, his performance earned rave reviews from his manager after the game.\n\n\u2018I thought Billy Gilmour was the best player on the pitch,\u2019 Lampard said. \u2018He moves the ball at a pace. Every pass he hits is punchy and into people\u2019s feet. I\u2019m delighted for him.\u2019\n\nFrank Lampard is a big admirer of Billy Gilmour\u2019s talents (Picture: Getty)\n\nFormer Chelsea playmaker Cesc Fabregas was also impressed with Gilmour\u2019s display, saying: \u2018He played amazing tonight. Personality is the most important at this age and he\u2019s got it all right.\u2019\n\nWhile Gilmour is one of Chelsea\u2019s brightest young talents, midfield competition is fierce with Mason Mount, Ross Barkley, Jorginho, Mateo Kovacic and N\u2019Golo Kante ahead of him in the pecking order.\n\nGilmour acknowledged he could benefit from a loan move away from Chelsea, saying: \u2018I need to play more first-team games, at Chelsea or maybe out on loan. I need to get more experience.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement", "description": "Billy Gilmour has revealed that Frank Lampard advised him to invite his family to Stamford Bridge ahead of his senior debut for Chelsea against Sheffield United in August.
