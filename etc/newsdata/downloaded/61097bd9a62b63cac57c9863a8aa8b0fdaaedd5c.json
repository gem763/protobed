I don't expect any big rupture in current Saudi oil policy.\"\n\nHis appointment further concentrates power within the king's family. His other son, Prince Mohammed bin Salman, controls the major levers of power and is heir to the Arab world's most powerful throne.\n\nA younger son, Prince Khalid bin Salman, is deputy defence minister.\n\nAramco is stepping up efforts to float around five percent of the company, seeking to raise up to $100 billion based on a $2 trillion valuation of the whole firm.\n\nBut low oil prices have left some investors in doubt that Aramco is really worth that much.\n\nFailure to reach a $2 trillion valuation as desired by Saudi rulers is widely considered the reason the IPO, earlier scheduled for 2018, was delayed.\n\nThe planned IPO forms the cornerstone of a reform programme envisaged by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to wean the Saudi economy off its reliance on oil.\n\nSaudi Aramco has not announced where the listing will be held, but London, New York and Hong Kong have all vied for a slice of the much-touted IPO.", "description": "Saudi Arabia's King Salman on Sunday replaced the energy minister with one of his sons, state media said, in a major shakeup as the OPEC kingpin reels from low oil prices.
