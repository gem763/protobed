AP\n\nThe US budget deficit widened to $US984 billion ($1.4 trillion), which was 4.6 per cent of the nation's gross domestic product. The previous fiscal year deficit was $US779 billion, with a deficit-to-GDP-ratio of 3.8 per cent. Total receipts increased by 4 per cent but outlays rose by 8.2 per cent.\n\nThe deficit reached a peak of $US1.4 trillion in 2009 as the Obama administration and Congress took emergency measures to shore up the nation's banking system during the global financial crisis and provide stimulus to an economy in recession.\n\nThe annual budget deficit had been reduced to $US585 billion by the end of former President Barack Obama's second term in 2016 and Republicans in Congress during that time criticised Obama, a Democrat, for not reducing it further.", "description": "The US budget deficit for the latest fiscal year widened to $US984 billion, which was 4.6 per cent of the nation's gross domestic product.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_155/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/555ec2d93cee9a3c2290c17da51e920702c98cb5", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
