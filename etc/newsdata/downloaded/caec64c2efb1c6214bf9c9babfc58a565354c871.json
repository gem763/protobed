You're on private property,' the woman is heard telling the pair.\n\n'What's the law?' the man asked, before his friend said: 'Ma'am if you don't move out the way... we are moving things in so you should move out the way.'\n\nA California woman has earned the name 'Move-in Martha' after she attempted to prevent a man and woman from helping their friend move into her apartment\n\n'You are breaking the law right now. You're on private property,' the woman is heard saying. 'What's the law?' the man (pictured) asked, before his friend said: 'Ma'am if you don't move out the way... we are moving things in so you should move out the way'\n\n'You are trespassing. You don't live here and you're unwilling to show ID,' the resident is heard saying as she blocks the entrance while holding her cellphone to her ear.\n\nShe is then heard speaking with a 911 dispatcher as the pair continued to ask her to move out of the way.\n\n'Who has this kind of time?' the woman recording the video asked her friend.\n\nMoments later, the resident tells the dispatcher that the man and his friend are not tenants at the apartment complex.\n\nThat statement was actually correct. They aren't residents but they were helping another person move their furniture into the building when they were stopped by the angry resident.\n\n'She is already in here ma'am. We're moving her furniture in you idiot,' the pair tell the woman.\n\n'You are trespassing. You don't live here and you're unwilling to show ID,' the resident (left and right) is heard saying as she blocks the entrance\n\nThe resident then starts to argue with the man as the woman continues to record the incident. It's unclear at what apartment complex in California the incident occurred\n\n'It's none of your business. We have a key and we have the right to be here. You haven't shown me any ID, have you? Where's your ID? What's your unit number? What's your social security number since you want to ask information?' the woman asks her.\n\nThe resident then tells the dispatcher that the woman was yelling at her outside the apartment building.\n\n'She wants to be famous for being a racist idiot. Because she hasn't seen enough white people's lives get ruined. She wants to be part of the trend,' the man is heard saying.\n\nThe trend he is referring too consists of Coupon Carl, Barbecue Becky and let's not forget Pool Patrol Paula, all of whom have called authorities on African-Americans or other minorities.\n\nAll three then start to argue before the resident eventually walks away with her two dogs. But a short time later she comes back to the area with another man.\n\nAccording to the woman filming the video, the tenant had the man escort her back into the complex because she feared for her safety.\n\nIt's unclear at what apartment complex in California the incident occurred.", "description": "A California woman has earned the name 'Move-in Martha' after she attempted to prevent a man and woman from helping their friend move into her apartment.", "authors": ["Valerie Edwards For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/16/19747944-0-image-a-58_1571153167855.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
