To most people, this is a pleasant surprise. However, this rebate from the Virginia Department of Taxation is a result of legislation I sponsored this year, House Bill 2529.\n\nI worked with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to prevent a tax increase for Virginians. This legislation increased the state standard deduction by 50 percent for 2019. Next year, when you file your state taxes, there will be more money for your family. Sitting back and letting the government take more and more of your money doesn\u2019t put Virginians first. Instead, the legislature developed a bill just for you, to keep taxpayers first. The bill let us conform to the federal code and, most importantly, give back nearly $1 billion to the hardworking taxpayers of Virginia.\n\nMy bill developed this policy to keep your hard-earned money where it should be (in your pocket), and it gives back what shouldn\u2019t have been taken in the first place. To some people, $220 is not much. However, for many families, it can mean that their kids get new shoes or go on a trip.\n\nAlso, and more importantly, we protected vital services in Virginia. The state returns money to individuals and doesn\u2019t reduce funding for teachers and transportation.\n\nI\u2019m a taxpayer and a Virginian, too. I get it. Every American deserves someone in their state legislature to fight for them and a competitive, healthy economy. This isn\u2019t a partisan issue; it\u2019s an issue that simply puts individuals and families first.\n\nDELEGATE TIM HUGO\n\nVirginia\u2019s 40th District\n\nCentreville, Va.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
