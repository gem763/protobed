Click here!\n\n\n\nA big part of looking at the cost of living is watching the price of stuff \u2014 or the inflation rate. It's something the Bank of Canada is tasked with: keeping inflation \"low and stable.\"\n\nBut while we talk about it all the time, do we understand what's actually happening?\n\nCBC Radio's new business and economics show, Cost of Living, airs on CBC Radio One every Saturday at 11:30 a.m. (12 p.m. NT) or online anytime at CBC Listen.\n\nWhat is inflation?\n\nThe term generally refers to how much the price of, well, anything and everything goes up year over year. The higher the inflation rate, the less purchasing power for consumers over time.\n\nWhat is the Consumer Price Index?\n\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) is how Statistics Canada measures inflation in this country. Over time, the agency compares the prices of a set basket of goods and services.\n\nThe Consumer Price Index can include a wide variety of goods and services. (CBC)\n\nThe central bank then tracks how those prices compare from year to year or month to month. The basket includes things as basic as groceries, such as meat and beer, but also include services like internet access and travel tours.\n\nWhat does the Bank of Canada have to do with it?\n\nThe Bank of Canada tries to keep inflation at around two per cent, right in the middle of its target inflation range of one to three per cent annually. Why two per cent? That's low enough that prices are stable, but high enough to avoid the risk of deflation \u2014 when prices go down. Deflation may seem attractive \u2014 we all like low prices \u2014 but widespread deflation is bad for the economy, in part because it causes wages to go down.\n\nA woman walks past an addition to the Bank of Canada building in Ottawa on May 31. (Trevor Pritchard/CBC)\n\nThe Bank of Canada uses the CPI to determine whether it's been successful at controlling the inflation rate. The central bank's main tool to do this is by setting its target interest rate, which influences what banks charge each other to borrow money amongst themselves. This in turn affects what financial institutions charge you to borrow money from them.\n\nIt's been fairly successful at keeping inflation steady over the past couple of decades.\n\nBut as evidenced by our politics \u2014 and by a CBC poll earlier this summer \u2014 people aren't feeling that's the case.\n\nFood\n\nThe cost of eating is something Canadians notice every day. However, different items within the category can balance each other out \u2014 for example, vegetables versus meat. Vegetable prices went up more than 15 per cent in the past year.\n\nIt's the era of vegetables since the beginning of 2019. - Sylvain Charlesbois, Dalhousie University professor\n\n\"It's the era of vegetables since the beginning of 2019,\" said Sylvain Charlebois, a professor of food distribution at Dalhousie University.\n\n\"However, if you go to the meat counter or if you go to the fish [counter], the rate [of price increases] is not that high,\" explained Charlebois.\n\nDespite the jump in veggie costs, meat prices only went up 1.85 per cent in the past year.\n\nEssentially, different items can make you feel like you're spending a lot more at the grocery store \u2014 remember the cauliflower crisis of 2015?\n\nBut with so many items in your grocery cart, your overall food bill may not be skyrocketing quite as much as you think \u2014 unless you are a celery fan in 2019.\n\nChild care\n\nThe average price of child care across the country has gone up at a higher rate than overall inflation for about the last 10 years. However, different programs and policies in each province mean that increase hasn't been uniform across the country.\n\nIn this file photo, children explore different activities at the Pirurvik preschool in Pond Inlet, Nunavut. (Kieran Oudshoorn/CBC)\n\n\"In Alberta \u2026 the wage cost of child care has increased faster than the rate of inflation,\" said Pierre Fortin, an economist at the Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al.\n\nThat likely has something to do with wages \u2014 which are higher in Alberta than elsewhere in the country.\n\nAs well, in provinces where child-care prices are more regulated, such as Quebec, Manitoba and Prince Edward Island, actual prices for daycare have remained lower than the rest of Canada.\n\nCars\n\nThe price of a brand new vehicle has remained steady over the past 20 years.\n\nAnd that in itself means \u2014 despite costing tens of thousands of dollars \u2014 they've actually been getting cheaper year over year when inflation is taken into account.\n\nThis Newfoundland auto dealer offered zero per cent financing for up to 84 months on select models in early 2019. (Sherry Vivian/CBC)\n\n\"You can actually find a number of vehicles that have a deflated price today versus five years ago, 10 years ago, 15 years ago,\" said auto industry analyst Dennis DesRosiers.\n\nYou have more competition in the market today than ever. - Dennis DesRosiers, auto industry analyst\n\nAccording to DesRosiers, that's got a lot to do with innovation and efficiency in the auto sector dating back to Japanese companies entering the North American market as far back as the 1980s.\n\n\"You have more competition in the market today than ever,\" said DesRosiers, who pointed out there's not a lot of room to increase prices when so many cars are competing for your dollar.\n\n\"There's just under 30 brands competing. We're no longer in a [world of] GM, Ford and Chrysler controlling 90 per cent of the market.\"\n\nClothing\n\nYour clothes are getting cheaper, too.\n\nFor most of the past 20 years, the overall price of clothing has either remained steady or been dropping. This can be tied, at least in part, to imports from countries, such as Bangladesh or China, where manufacturing costs are drastically lower.\n\nClothes are much cheaper now \u2014 when accounting for inflation \u2014 than when these New Kids on the Block T-shirts were a top choice in 1990. (CBC)\n\nAs global trade was liberalized and opened to other countries, the price of clothes dropped. According to Statistics Canada, as late as 1998 the United States was the main supplier of clothes to Canada.\n\nBut in the following years, that changed. For example, clothing imported from Bangladesh tripled between 2002 and 2005, and that pattern has continued.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, clothing imports from China made up more than 34 per cent of Canadian clothing and textile imports in 2017.\n\nTuition\n\nThe price of tuition in Canada has skyrocketed, relative to the price of inflation, over the past 20 years.\n\nHowever, much like child care, it is a different situation from province to province and is closely tied to politics.\n\nStudents march during a protest against tuition fee increases on May 26, 2012, in Montreal. (Rogerio Barbosa/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nIn Alberta, tuition remained largely stable, relative to inflation, for the last few years. Part of that is because that province's former NDP government put in a tuition cap tied to the CPI.\n\nHowever, the national average has been driven up by other provinces, such as Ontario, where tuition is thousands of dollars more than Alberta or Manitoba.\n\nA report from the Royal Bank last year showed that university tuition has been going up faster than inflation since the early 1980s. The gap between the rate of inflation and the rate that tuition goes up has only widened since the era of big hair and shoulder pads.\n\nThat same report indicated that government dollars going toward university has dropped by half since 1990.", "description": "The Cost of Living wants you to learn about your costs of living, by trying its interactive game that tests your knowledge about inflation rates.
