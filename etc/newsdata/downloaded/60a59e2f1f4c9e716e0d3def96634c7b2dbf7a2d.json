Trump added that he \u201coffered ISIS prisoners to the European countries from where they came, and was rejected on numerous occasions,\u201d something he has lamented in the past.\n\nTrump then tweeted regarding the US military presence in Syria following the \u201c100%\u201d defeat of the ISIS caliphate, questioning why the US should \u201cfight for Syria and Assad to protect the land of our enemy?\u201d\n\nHe continued:\n\n\u201cAnyone who wants to assist Syria in protecting the Kurds is good with me, whether it is Russia, China, or Napoleon Bonaparte. I hope they all do great, we are 7,000 miles away!\u201d\n\nHe then made the transition from US military presence in Syria to protecting the US-Mexico border, which he tweeted he would \u201cmuch rather\u201d focus on.\n\nMore context: These tweets come amid ongoing attacks by Turkish forces on the Syrian border, causing some serious global fears to be realized, including a possible resurgence of ISIS. Over the weekend, Kurdish authorities reported the escape of hundreds of people with links to ISIS from a detention camp in the area.\n\nTrump is facing scathing criticism from Republican lawmakers and members of his own military. He is expected to meet with Sen. Lindsey Graham today.
