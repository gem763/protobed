Short said Pence had communicated with Barr about the issue.\n\nPence is visiting Poland without the president after Donald Trump postponed his visit because Hurricane Dorian began bearing down towards the US mainland.\n\nThe White House has, by the president\u2019s own account, been working on ways to address gun violence after the recent mass shootings. Trump addressed the subject on Saturday after a gunman went on a high-speed drive in Midland and Odessa, Texas, spraying bullets from an assault rifle as he drove, before being killed by police.\n\nThe incident began soon after 3pm on Saturday when a man, later identified as the gunman, was stopped by state troopers for failing to signal a turn. He opened fire with an AR-15-style rifle then fled, hijacking a mail truck and shooting people at random.\n\nThe president did not set out any specifics when he reacted to the killings on Saturday. There has been no meaningful legislation on the issue in recent times and Trump has a record of bringing up gun control measures and then retreating quickly.\n\nFBI special agent Christopher Combs said the gunman involved in the west Texas rampage \u201cwas on a long spiral down\u201d before he was fired from his job on the day of the shooting.\n\nMessages written in sidewalk chalk are seen at the University of Texas of the Permian Basin.

Combs says Ator had gone to work that day \u201cin trouble.\u201d\n\nRepresentative Tom Craddick, a state legislator, told the Midland-Reporter Telegram that the shooter had failed a background check at his job. A neighbor claimed that the gunman approached her house last month, while carrying a large rifle, and shouted at her for putting garbage in a Dumpster nearby, according to CNN.\n\nAdvocates for greater gun control, inside and outside Washington, have been frustrated and angered by lack of action from Congress and the White House in the past decade, and lately by the president\u2019s focus on many topics in relation to trying to reduce mass shootings \u2013 except greater gun control.\n\nTrump has recently appeared to blame mental health issues, a general \u201cglorification of violence\u201d and violent video games for repeated mass shootings, after the mass shooting in El Paso, Texas, earlier in August.\n\nBut some opponents, especially Democrats in Congress and candidates for the 2020 presidential election, say these issues are just as relevant or prevalent in other countries but only the US has such a high frequency of mass shootings and widespread availability of guns, including legal, high-powered assault rifles.\n\nTrump has also explored expanded background checks, but he has wavered on the issue. Top Senate Democrats have urged Republicans to consider gun legislation that was already passed at the house.\n\nSaturday\u2019s rampage was the third major mass shooting in August, following incidents in El Paso, Texas and Dayton, Ohio.\n\nCommunities in Texas are raising money for wounded survivors and bereaved families. Twenty-two injured people are recovering and the youngest victim, a 17-month-old, was scheduled to undergo surgery after she was shot in the face.\n\nHundreds of community members gathered on Sunday night at the University of Texas Permian Basin, in Odessa, for a prayer vigil honoring the victims of the massacre.\n\nPastors, speaking in Spanish and English, implored attendees to pray for victims and thanked law enforcement officers and medical workers who responded to the shooting.\n\nTeams from the Federal Bureau of Investigation search a home in a rural residential area in west Odessa.
