He started well, throwing for 380 yards and three touchdowns against the Eagles and another 220 yards and two more touchdowns against the Cowboys. But he had four turnovers and sprained his ankle in the Monday night loss to the Bears. Though he started the team\u2019s fourth game at the New York Giants, he was pulled in the second quarter after throwing for just 37 yards and replaced by Haskins.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nKeenum also has missed or did not make throws to wide open receivers that might have led to touchdowns in his four games.\n\nWith McCoy, a favorite of former Coach Jay Gruden, finally healthy enough to start last week\u2019s game against New England and pressure growing from outside to play Haskins, it seemed that Keenum might not play again this season.\n\nKeenum climbed back to the top of the depth chart with Callahan\u2019s arrival, however. He practiced with the first team this week and after telling Callahan his ankle will hold up was anointed the starter.\n\nKeenum has completed 92-of-135 passes for 977 yards with four touchdowns and four interceptions. Despite his recent struggles, he still has a high passer rating of 93.8.\n\nAD\n\nWhen asked what he liked best about Keenum, Callahan said: \u201cJust his demeanor on the field and around the building. He\u2019s a first one in and the last one out kind of guy, always watching film, always inquisitive.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOn Monday, during his introductory newsconference Callahan said Haskins still isn\u2019t ready to start.\n\n\u201cNot right now, but he will be at some point in time,\u201d Callahan said at the time. \u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to develop him and heighten his maturation process and try to get him on schedule so that he is prepared.\u201d\n\nCallahan said McCoy\u2019s leg has held up well after playing his first game in nearly a year.\n\nRead more Redskins coverage from Post Sports:\n\nAD", "description": "Redskins interim coach Bill Callahan said first round pick Dwayne Haskins will be the backup on Sunday", "authors": ["Les Carpenter", "Reporter Covering Washington Redskins"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/iJIalBZH4HXZ0xnQ3SmAzaKb2QQ=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FUFEW3G6PYI6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
