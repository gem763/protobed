Schmid said that on a perfect face the length of an ear is equal to the length the nose, and the width of an eye is equal to the distance between the eyes.\n\nBased on that scale DeSilva has ranked the 23-year-old model as the most beautiful -- followed by Beyonc\u00e9, Amber Heard and Ariana Grande.\n\nBut beauty is in the eye of the beholder, especially when the Bey Hive is involved.\n\nBeyonc\u00e9's fan base did not take kindly to her being ranked number two.\n\nWhoever decided to compare #BellaHadid and #Beyonc\u00e9 in terms of beauty, should have kept that opinion to themselves! \u2014 FOFO (@fofoeats) October 16, 2019\n\nThere is no world where Bella hadid looks better than Beyonc\u00e9. None. Not even on Opposite Day. \u2014 For some Benihana rice though?
