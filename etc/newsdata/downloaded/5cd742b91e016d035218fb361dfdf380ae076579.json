So many people engage with survivors from a place of pity.\u201d\n\nShe told the wire service that no Democratic candidates have spoken with her about their platforms, which she said is indicative of a lack of urgency. Burke added that she doesn't expect sexual violence to come up at Tuesday night's Democratic debate, but hopes the MeTooVoter hashtag will lead to questions at other events.\n\nIn an op-ed last week for Time, Burke called for more discussion among the presidential candidates about sexual violence.\n\n\"October marks the 2nd anniversary of the #MeToo hashtag & the start of a monumental shift. It rose awareness, but we demand more,\" she tweeted last week. \"I wrote this op-ed for @TIME in light of the upcoming #DemDebate. We are voting for accountability in 2020. #MeTooVoter\"\n\nOctober marks the 2nd anniversary of the #MeToo hashtag & the start of a monumental shift. It rose awareness, but we demand more.

It gained popularity in the wake of high-profile allegations against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein in 2017 and expanded amid similar accusations against men in other industries.", "description": "Tarana Burke, the founder of the \"MeToo\" movement, is launching a voter mobilization campaign on the second anniversary of the hashtag going viral.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/burketarana.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
