The French phrase translates as \u201csqueal on your pig.\u201d\n\nBrion sued, arguing the viral tweet harmed him and that his remarks to Muller were not harassment. The court ruled Wednesday in his favor and ordered Muller to delete her tweet.\n\nBrion hailed the ruling as a \u201cvictory of true justice.\u201d\n\nMuller said she fears the ruling will silence women who have experienced harassment.
