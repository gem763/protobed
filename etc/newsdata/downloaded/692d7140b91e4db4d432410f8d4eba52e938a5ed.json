Sunday's game was the 147th of Stafford's career.\n\nStafford, 31, also was the fastest to hit other milestones: 15,000, 20,000, 25,000 and 30,000. He entered the game No. 21 on the NFL's all-time passing list, trailing Johnny Unitas by 326 yards.\n\nTalking to reporters earlier in the week, Stafford seemed unfazed by the 40,000-yard mark.\n\n\"I hope 40,000 isn't the last number I hit,\" Stafford said. \"I'd like to keep playing and play well. The biggest thing for me is I just want to get the bad taste out of my mouth of losing two in a row. I just want to win a game.\n\n\"If I throw for 86 and we win, I'll be happy as hell.\"\n\n--Field Level Media", "description": "Lions' Stafford fastest QB to 40,000 yards", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9J0NJ_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
