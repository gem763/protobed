He threw a warm up pitch, but then walked off with an athletic trainer.\n\n\"CC! CC! CC!\" the crowd chanted as he perhaps left the Yankee Stadium field for the last time.\n\nWith the Yankees down 7-3, Sabathia was facing George Springer.\n\nIt seemed unclear exactly what the injury was, but Thursday may have marked the final time Sabathia plays for the Yankees.\n\nJustin Toscano is the Mets beat writer for NorthJersey.com.
