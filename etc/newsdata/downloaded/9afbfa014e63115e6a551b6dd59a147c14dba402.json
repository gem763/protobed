Come next week, \u201cD2\u201d Season Pass holders will be treated with another Exotic quest that is the bugged machine gun known as Xenophage. The developer also published their latest \"This Week at Bungie\" blog where they detailed a new game mode in the game including this year\u2019s Festival of the Lost. They also addressed other concerns being raised by their player base which include the 2.0 Solstice armor and discussions about Ghosts.\n\nOn Solstice armor\n\nReddit user u/Some_Italian_Guy made a post, over on r/DestinyTheGame, that has gained some traction among fellow \u201cD2\u201d players. According to him, he\u2019s \u201cfairly annoyed\u201d that the game\u2019s Solstice armor sets got some poor stats on it, adding that Bungie did it on purpose. The OP even went on to state that it\u2019s like a \u201cslap in the face\u201d knowing the amount of grind time players spent only to acquire the gear having poor stats.\n\nCommunity Manager Dmg (who recently returned from sickbay) responded to this, revealing that they previously had talked about \u201chow to respect the time players put into earning the sets.\u201d He also clarified that there was no intention of giving the armor sets with poor stats, though they also discussed that it\u2019s not appropriate to release those gears already donning maxed out stats off the bat. He further explained that doing such would reduce players\u2019 motivation to grind for new armor pieces or participate in some of \u201cDestiny 2\u2019s\u2019 more challenging activities in search of better roles.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the latest news!

This after a Reddit user suggested that \u201cGhosts should function in the same vein as the seasonal artifact in that they level up as Guardians gain experience.\u201d This would allow players to unlock and slot perks allowing shells to be purely cosmetic.\n\nAnother member of the subreddit pitched the idea of shells having mod slots adding that such feature would allow other \u201cDestiny 2\u201d players to use any shell they prefer rather than the current issue that they\u2019re experiencing with Armor 2.0.\n\noh i like that idea https://t.co/MKF2qCwoTq via @reddit \u2014 Rusted Gamer (@cruzerwin126) October 25, 2019 Momentum Control\n\nAs for the game\u2019s new mode dubbed Momentum Control, it says it will focus on gunplay as compared to Mayhem\u2019s Supers.\n\nIt will be \u201ca fast-paced, hair-on-fire experience\u201d as the weapon\u2019s lethality has been upped to 11.
