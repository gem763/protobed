Sulzberger claimed that \u201canti-press rhetoric\u201d used by Trump against so-called \u201cfake news\u201d outlets at home has inspired the systematic jailing and slaying of independent journalists abroad.\n\nLIZ PEEK: NEW YORK TIMES EMERGES AS RADICAL VOICE OF THE ANTI-TRUMP MOB \u2013 AND THERE'S NO TURNING BACK\n\n\u201cIn attacking American media, President Trump has done more than undermine his own citizens\u2019 faith in the news organizations attempting to hold him accountable. He has effectively given foreign leaders permission to do the same with their countries\u2019 journalists, and even given them the vocabulary with which to do it,\u201d Sulzberger wrote.\n\nSulzberger detailed one instance in which he said the New York Times received a call from a U.S. diplomat in Egypt in 2017 who, acting in defiance to orders, warned the paper that one of its reporters, Declan Walsh, was facing \u201cimminent arrest\u201d by government officials in Egypt.\n\n\u201cThis particular call took a surprising and distressing turn,\u201d Sulzberger wrote. \u201cWe learned the official was passing along this warning without the knowledge or permission of the Trump administration. Rather than trying to stop the Egyptian government or assist the reporter, the official believed, the Trump administration intended to sit on the information and let the arrest be carried out. The official feared being punished for even alerting us to the danger.\u201d\n\n\n\nInstead of relying on U.S. protection, The Times reached out to Irish diplomats who arrived to Walsh\u2019s home within an hour and escorted him onto a plane before he could be arrested. Walsh is an Irish national who reports for the Times.\n\n\u201cThose of us leading The Times find it hard not to worry, knowing we have colleagues on the ground where war is raging, disease is spreading and conditions deteriorating,\u201d Sulzberger continued. \u201cBut we\u2019ve long taken comfort in knowing that in addition to all our own preparations and all our own safeguards, there has always been another, critical safety net: the United States government, the world\u2019s greatest champion of the free press. Over the last few years, however, something has dramatically changed.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe op-ed noted that Trump has used the phrase \u201cfake news\u201d more than 600 times on Twitter. Sulzberger also pointed to the nearing one-year anniversary of the slaying of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who was killed and dismembered in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey. Trump has been criticized for refusing to condemn Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman after the killing.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe Committee to Protect Journalists, a non-profit based in New York City, reports 252 journalists were imprisoned worldwide last year for completing their job duties. Sixteen reporters have been killed in 2019. Sulzberger said that Trump\u2019s disregard for the First Amendment has spewed into a \u201cworldwide assault on journalists and journalism.\u201d He concluded his op-ed by renewing a call to protect our \u201ccore democratic values\u201d at a time when its crucial to hold power accountable.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe true power of a free press is an informed, engaged citizenry. I believe in independent journalism and want it to thrive. I believe in this country and its values, and I want us to live up to them and offer them as a model for a freer and more just world,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe United States has done more than any other country to popularize the idea of free expression and to champion the rights of the free press. The time has come for us to fight for those ideals again.\u201d", "description": "The New York Times publisher alleged Monday that the Trump administration refused to intervene to prevent one of its reporters from being arrested two years ago in Egypt and detailed other instances in which the current president has \u201cretreated from our country\u2019s historical role as a defender of the free press.\u201d", "authors": ["Danielle Wallace"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/05/Trump-NYT.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
