Duty-free sales were then abolished when the single market was introduced, effectively erasing national borders.\n\nIn a 1997 statement defending the decision, the European Commission wrote: \u201cPeople enjoy being able to literally fill up their car or baggage with goods bought in other EU countries that are cheaper or not available in their country of residence.\n\n\u201cBeing able to buy a single 1l bottle of spirits and a single box of 200 cigarettes in a duty-free shop if you happen to travel by air, sea or the Channel Tunnel shuttle pales in comparison with the new opportunities to shop in other EU countries.\u201d\n\nThese opportunities include the freedom to bring in unlimited amounts of goods bought anywhere in the EU without systematic border checks, making shopping in another EU country as easy as purchasing in a local shop, the commission noted.\n\nThis freedom will be kept in part after a no-deal Brexit, according to the Treasury statement. People travelling back from the EU will still be able to bring back unlimited amounts specifically of alcohol and cigarettes, provided they did not buy them in a duty-free shop.\n\nThe Treasury\u2019s decision on duty-free shopping will not apply to movements of goods from Northern Ireland to EU member state Ireland, as EU law does not allow the Irish government to operate duty-free at the land border.\n\nA no-deal Brexit, which until last week looked increasingly likely, faces a fresh hurdle after parliament passed a law to stop such an outcome. The bill requires Boris Johnson to request an extension to Brexit negotiations until the end of January unless he can secure a deal or parliamentary approval for no deal by 19 October.", "description": "The return of tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit will make many foods and other imports more expensive, but alcohol and cigarettes will become cheaper \u2013 provided you buy them on your way to the EU or in a duty-free shop on the continent.", "authors": ["Olesya Dmitracova"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/12/30/18/duty-free-booze.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
