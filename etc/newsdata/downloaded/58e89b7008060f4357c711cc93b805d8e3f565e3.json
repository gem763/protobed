The longer the sea ice is gone from the productive zone the tougher it is on the bears,\u201d said Polar Bears International\u2019s Steven Amstrup.\n\nIn 2015, the group reported that the polar bear population in the Beaufort Sea had declined by 40% over the previous decade. \u201cWe can only anticipate that those declines have continued,\u201d Amstrup said.\n\nThe loss of sea ice this year was so pronounced early in the season that tagging crews from the US Geological Survey (USGS) concluded that the sea ice offshore in the western arctic was too thin and unstable to be able to conduct their studies \u2013 the first time the team have pulled their studies because of safety issues.\n\nThat\u2019s a far cry from the two decades to 2010 when Amstrup did two two-month field studies a year.\n\nIn recent years, the spring season has also been severely hampered by open water, fog and bad weather.\n\nThis year, the trends were repeated. Amstrup said: \u201cThe ice in the spring \u2026 was really tough this year. What ice was there was thin and rough this year. That\u2019s part of progressive trend that we\u2019ve seen over several years.\u201d\n\nThe circumstances of global heating in the Arctic region, from record heatwaves in Alaska to the loss of more than 60bn tons of ice from Greenland\u2019s ice cap during a five-day heatwave this summer, including the biggest loss in a 24-hour period since records began.\n\nFor both polar bear populations, the circumstances are grim. Those that live on shore aren\u2019t finding much to eat, says Amstrup, and those that live permanently on the pack ice don\u2019t appear to be feeding much either.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re having a long fast in the summer and there\u2019s a limit to how long that fast can last. We\u2019re already seeing indications in terms of poorer cub survival in the Beaufort Sea. An adult bear has a lot of body mass, and maybe can get through a long summer fast, but young bears don\u2019t have the body mass or hunting skills to survive,\u201d he said.\n\nBut because 2019 did not set a record in terms of sea-ice loss, Amstrup stressed, we should not be fooled into thinking that, short of an extreme event, circumstances have stabilized or improved.\n\n\ufeffAmstrup said funding cutbacks and the fact that biologists cannot get out and study the bears means it may never be able to collect the necessary data to assess \u201cjust how bad this year was\u201d.\n\nInstead, Amstrup says this bad ice year and record warm summer are symbols of what the future will bring. Bad years like this will be increasingly frequent and the bad years will be increasingly worse \u2013 as long as we allow CO2 levels to continue to rise.\n\n\u201cWe know that as greenhouse gas concentrations continue to rise it\u2019s going to be warmer and we\u2019re going to have less and less sea ice until polar bears disappear,\u201d he said.", "description": "Expert Steven Amstrup says \u2018the longer the sea ice is gone from the productive zone the tougher it is on the bears\u2019", "authors": ["Edward Helmore"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/44ce881a90230bd65c1f7bbf2f81e1a36fa4d81d/490_0_4520_2714/master/4520.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=653718da7b1e779961ee7571098417c0", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
