Mini Metro has you linking together stops in a subway line, joining up different symbols until the map is spider web of coloured lines.\n\nThe goal is to create an efficient public transportation system so that everyone can get to the stations they need to be on time. Mini Motorways has players create road systems instead, leading to similar logistical snares. You link houses to buildings with roads. Over time, more and more houses and buildings appear, and you have to adjust the roads so that the traffic isn\u2019t overwhelming.\n\nAll the maps in these games are based on real world cities. Mini Metro has cities known for their public transit, like New York, whereas Mini Motorways focuses on driving cities like Los Angeles. Now that I\u2019ve played both, I know the kind of place I\u2019d rather live. Mini Motorways is a very clear example of how inefficient cars are.\n\nMy best game of Mini Motorways ended with over 300 cars on the road over a period of around 40 days. If all those cars were packed to the gills, that\u2019s a maximum of 1,500 passengers going to and fro on the wide open road. That\u2019s the maximum, though.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been in a car before, you know that it\u2019s much more likely that each car holds one or maybe two passengers. With that in mind, I\u2019d estimate the total number of passengers in my \u201cbest\u201d city to be between 300 and 600. In a game of Mini Metro I just played, I reached 700 total passengers in 30 days before one of my stations got overloaded. While my city in Motorways had a much higher total capacity for people if they all packed their cars, my city in Metro reached a higher headcount in less time.\n\nA lot of places in the United States were designed with cars in mind, but even driving cities like Los Angeles are starting up new initiatives for public transportation. The last time I was in LA, I saw a metro stop being renovated as part of the Purple Line expansion.\n\nMaking Los Angeles a city that\u2019s accessible through public transportation will be hard; the city is enormous. But it\u2019s clear that the city is investing in it. Once the expansion is completed, the Purple Line will run all the way from Union Station, to Korea Town, through Beverly Hills, and into the UCLA area. That\u2019s not an insignificant route.\n\nI\u2019ve long thought that cars, beyond relying on the dinosaur bone juice that\u2019s currently killing the planet, are simply not as efficient as public transportation. I am lucky enough to live in a city with really good public transit, despite the MTA\u2019s best efforts to ruin my day.\n\nPlaying Mini Motorways further cements my conclusions about cars. I\u2019d also love to see these games combined, to have even more models with which to study the flow of human beings, and how to get them where they need to go in a timely manner.", "description": "As I watch cars sit at a standstill at an intersection in Mini Motorways, the new game from the makes of Mini Metro, all I can think about is how much more efficient this city would have been with public transportation....", "authors": ["Heather Alexandra", "Alex Walker"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/crfu8kdsguzz8qfjmnsu.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
