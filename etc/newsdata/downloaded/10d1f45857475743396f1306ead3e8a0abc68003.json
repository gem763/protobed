That would have given the administration enough new members on the Postal Service\u2019s oversight board to enable Brennan\u2019s ouster, at least in theory, according to people with knowledge of the discussions.\n\nThe Board of Governors has 11 members, nine of whom are appointed by the president, as well as the postmaster general and her deputy. The nine-member board elects the postmaster general. There are still four vacancies, but with five governors, the board now has a quorum for the first time since 2014. And now Trump has installed three of his picks \u2014 a majority \u2014 on the board.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBefore Wednesday\u2019s announcement, the White House rejected the notion that Trump\u2019s nomination of three new members to the Postal Service board was in any way tied to the president\u2019s desire to replace Brennan or that Trump hoped to see Brennan removed because she had been too soft on Amazon.\n\n\u201cThis insinuation is so false that no one had the guts to go on the record with it, but giving gutless anonymous sources a platform to attack the President Trump and protect Amazon is a typical tactic of The Washington Post,\u201d said Hogan Gidley, a White House spokesman, in an email statement several weeks before Brennan decided to retire.\n\nBezos plays no role in the newspaper\u2019s day-to-day coverage, and his ownership of the publication is separate from his role as Amazon chief executive. Amazon declined to comment.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAfter months of attacks on Amazon and its shipping charges early in his term, Trump commissioned the Treasury Department to lead a task force on the Postal Service\u2019s financial troubles. A December 2018 report from the task force concluded that the Postal Service \u201cis on an unsustainable financial path\u201d and is \u201cforecast to lose tens of billions of dollars over the next decade.\u201d\n\nThe Postal Service reported a net loss of $3.9 billion for fiscal 2018 \u2014 an increase of $1.2 billion in net losses compared to 2017, even as the agency increased its operating revenue by $1 billion.\n\n\u201cShe was running the joint on baling wire and bubble gum for five years,\u201d Arthur Sackler, a longtime lobbyist for mailers, postal shippers and suppliers, said about Brennan. \u201cShe\u2019s got to be worn down.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBrennan worked closely on a deal reached in September that changed the fee structure for international mail and small packages, earning her praise from Peter Navarro, a senior White House economic adviser.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cOne of my favorite people in this town is the postmaster general,\u201d Navarro said in a CNN interview last month. \u201cShe has put all the resources of her agency to work on this.\u201d\n\nSince becoming president, Trump has taken an unusual interest in the Postal Service, according to current and former aides. He has asked for detailed briefings on its finances and operations and has complained repeatedly to senior aides about its status as a financial \u201closer,\u201d three former senior administration officials said.\n\nAD\n\nOne of Trump\u2019s greatest gripes is the Postal Service\u2019s relationship with Amazon.\n\n\u201cI am right about Amazon costing the United States Post Office massive amounts of money for being their Delivery Boy,\u201d Trump wrote in a tweet last year. \u201cAmazon should pay these costs (plus) and not have them bourne by the American Taxpayer. Many billions of dollars. P.O. leaders don\u2019t have a clue (or do they?)!\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTrump has also mused about privatizing the Postal Service, an idea long floated by various conservative think tanks, according to current and former senior administration officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share private conversations.\n\nJohn McHugh, chairman of the Package Coalition, a trade association that represents over 20 national brands and companies, including Amazon, said it is important to \u201clook at this process as a whole\u201d rather than just Amazon.\n\nAD\n\nThe package delivery system, McHugh said, \u201cis by far the Postal Service\u2019s most lucrative and highest returning business, and if you want to fix the Postal Service\u2019s financial position \u2014 and I think the president really does want to do that \u2014 I think the last thing you want to do is artificially, on a nonmarket basis, disrupt that single profitable source of Postal Service revenue.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMany of the Postal Service\u2019s financial woes are tied to the 2006 Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act, which requires the agency to pre-fund its retiree health care benefits. During April testimony before the House Oversight Committee, Brennan cited the law and the agency\u2019s \u201cvery sizable retirement-related payments\u201d to explain some of the Postal Service\u2019s challenges.\n\nBrennan assumed the postmaster general\u2019s job in February 2015, becoming the first woman to hold the job. Before that, she served as the Postal Service\u2019s chief operating officer and executive vice president. Brennan began her three-decade career as a letter carrier in Lancaster, Pa.\n\nAD\n\nJust before the August congressional recess, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) included the confirmation votes of three new members of the Postal Service Board of Governors \u2014 John McLeon Barger, Ron A. Bloom, and Roman Martinez IV \u2014 as part of a broader package that passed by voice vote.\n\nAD\n\nTrump had previously complained to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin about his frustrations with Brennan, according to someone familiar with the conversations. McConnell\u2019s office was aware of the president\u2019s desire to replace her, a second person familiar with the situation said. But, this person said, McConnell viewed the three new board members\u2019 nominations as simply part of his role in filling executive branch vacancies.\n\nThrough a Postal Service spokesman, the three new members previously declined requests for interviews.", "description": "The president has frequently complained that the U.S. Postal Service loses too much money and is not charging Amazon enough for package delivery.", "authors": ["Ashley Parker", "White House Reporter", "Josh Dawsey", "Reporter Covering The White House"], "top_image": "https://washingtonpost.com/pf/resources/images/favicon.ico?d=131", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
