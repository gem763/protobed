He provided no further details.\n\nMr. Ghani\u2019s spokesman, Sediq Seddiqi, said the president and his aides would study and assess the details of the accord, and reply to Mr. Khalilzad in \u201ca couple of days.\u201d\n\nIn a sign that the path to a comprehensive settlement of the nearly 18-year war would be rocky, an enormous explosion rocked the capital late Monday, as the local television station\u2019s interview with Mr. Khalilzad promoting the U.S.-Taliban deal aired. At least five people were killed and another 50 were wounded, the Interior Ministry said. More deaths were feared.\n\nThe Taliban later said they carried out the attack, detonating a tanker truck filled with explosives near a compound where foreign contractors and aid workers are housed. The bombing followed Taliban attacks on two northern cities, Kunduz and Pul-e Khumri, over the weekend.\n\nBefore flying to the Afghan capital on Sunday, Mr. Khalilzad tweeted from Qatar\u2019s capital Doha that the two sides had completed their ninth round of talks and were on the \u201cthreshold\u201d of a deal that would reduce violence and pave the way for a \u201csustainable\u201d peace. The Afghan-born envoy said Monday that the deal now awaited President Trump\u2019s approval.\n\nThe proposed U.S.-Taliban accord calls for a phased withdrawal of the estimated 14,500 American military personnel in Afghanistan, as well as other foreign forces, in exchange for assurances from the Taliban not to allow al Qaeda, Islamic State and other Islamist militant groups to operate in the country.\n\nThe Taliban are then expected to begin separate talks in Norway with an Afghan delegation, including representatives of the government, about a cease fire and how the country will be ruled.\n\nThe Afghan government\u2019s restrained, circumspect reply to Mr. Khalilzad on Monday wasn\u2019t unexpected.\n\nThe Taliban\u2019s longstanding refusal to hold direct peace talks with any government in Kabul has sidelined Mr. Ghani from the Doha negotiations, though Mr. Khalilzad has regularly briefed him. Critics of Mr. Ghani also say that the president, fearing he may be pushed aside in the new power-sharing government to be negotiated in Norway, has deliberately slow-walked the peace process to protect his bid for another five-year term in elections set for this month.\n\nMr. Ghani and other Afghan government officials have publicly welcomed Mr. Khalilzad\u2019s progress in Doha. Privately, however, they have fumed over being sidelined from the talks, disparaged the Afghan-born Mr. Khalilzad and, according to one high-placed security official, sought to drive a wedge between him and other U.S. officials and members of U.S. Congress.\n\nYet with the Doha talks on the cusp of a signal achievement, Mr. Ghani and his government must now deal with Mr. Khalilzad as attention shifts to Afghan-to-Afghan talks on a cease-fire and future power-sharing arrangements, said an Afghan familiar with the government\u2019s deliberations on the peace process.\n\n\u201cGhani and inner circle now have more reasons to think Khalilzad is central to the peace process and will remain so,\u201d the person said. \u201cThey can\u2019t keep wishing someone in the Pentagon, in the White House or somewhere else in Washington will buy their perspective.\u201d\n\nWhether Mr. Ghani grasps the urgency for progress toward ending the war that Mr. Khalilzad, the Trump administration and most of the Afghan public voice is uncertain. He has told aides that he will need far longer than the nine months the U.S. has taken to get a withdrawal agreement to achieve a deal on a cease-fire and future political arrangements in the country.\n\n\u201cMore important, though, than time, Ghani will continue to seek control of the intra-Afghan talks from Khalilzad,\u201d the Afghan said. \u201cInside, he and members of his inner circle will be seething that a process they wished had blown up or gotten disrupted in their favor has been meticulously steered by the man sitting opposite them.\u201d\n\n\u2014\n\nWrite to Craig Nelson at craig.nelson@wsj.com", "description": "Chief U.S. diplomat overseeing talks with the Taliban shared details of the proposal with the Afghan government, as the insurgents bombed the capital.", "authors": ["Craig Nelson", "Craig.Nelson Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-103371/social"}
