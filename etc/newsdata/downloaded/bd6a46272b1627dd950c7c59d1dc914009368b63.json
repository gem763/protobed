He spoke dismissively of arresting officers who protect suspects' heads while putting them in police cars. (July 28) AP\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Minneapolis police officers rankled by a new department policy barring off-duty staff from wearing their uniforms to political events plan to instead swarm President Trump's Thursday rally with a \"sea of red\" specialty T-shirts.\n\nThe policy change came the day after Trump announced he would host a rally in Minneapolis, and the head of the local police union argues it was a political move meant to favor the city's Democratic officials. The police department for its part says the policy is about avoiding the appearance of political bias.\n\nBut the person who could be most irked by the rule change? The president, who is traveling to Minneapolis Thursday for his first campaign rally since House Democrats announced an impeachment inquiry against him.\n\nImpeachment inquiry: Here is what will happen this week\n\nTrump often surrounds himself with men and women in uniform, both in the White House and on the campaign trail. He has has long painted himself as a pro-law enforcement president, ranging from his sharp criticism of NFL player protests during the national anthem over police brutality to the Department of Justice's slowed pace of civil rights investigations into local police departments.\n\nIn February at the Major County Sheriffs and the Major Cities Chiefs Association Joint Conference, he renewed his commitment to law enforcement, vowing to make \"officer safety a top priority.\"\n\nTrump speaks about anti-gang activity efforts in Suffolk County, New York, at Suffolk Community College in Brentwood, New York, USA, 28 July 2017.

We will not tolerate smears, or slanders, or assaults on those who wear the badge and police our streets,\" he said.\n\nAnd that support appears to be reciprocal. He earned the endorsement of the National Fraternal Order of Police, which claims more than 330,000 members, in 2016. And the International Union of Police Associations (IUPA) has already endorsed him in his 2020 re-election bid.\n\nWe love our Law Enforcement Officers all around this great Country. What took place in NYC with water being tossed on NYPD officers was a total disgrace. It is time for @NYCMayor@BilldeBlasio to STAND UP for those who protect our lives and serve us all so well... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 25, 2019\n\nBut instead of the thin blue line appearing behind Trump on Thursday, there will be \"a sea red T-shirts,\" according to Bob Kroll, president of the Police Officers Federation of Minneapolis. The shirt features the phrase \"Cops for Trump\" emblazoned across an American flag in the shape of Minnesota and will be sold both online and at the rally. All proceeds from the shirt sales will go to the union's charity, Kroll said.\n\nHow we got here\n\nThe T-shirt sale follows furor over a new Minneapolis Police Department policy that prohibits off-duty officers from wearing their uniform to political events.\n\nThe policy, according to police spokesman John Elder, is to prevent officers from showing political bias.\n\n\"The uniform gets translated back to the average person as someone being from the police department,\" he said. \"It's very confusing for people when they see someone in uniform to understand the difference between the city and the federation.\"\n\nA T-shirt designed by the Minneapolis Police Federation reads \"Cops for Trump.\" (Photo: Minneapolis Police Federation)\n\nBut Kroll thinks politics are behind the rule change and said he was not surprised when the police chief called him to inform him of the new policy. He pointed to comments made by Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey following the announcement of the Trump rally, in which Frey said Trump's \"message of hatred will never be welcome in Minneapolis.\"\n\n\u201cUnder ordinary circumstances, it would be an honor to welcome a sitting President of the United States to Minneapolis and to showcase all our city has to offer on the national stage,\" Frey said in a statement. \"But these aren\u2019t ordinary circumstances. Since taking office President Trump\u2019s actions have been reprehensible and his rhetoric has made it clear that he does not value the perspectives or rights of Minneapolis\u2019 diverse communities.\"\n\nKroll said the timing of the uniform appeared to be \"very conspicuous.\"\n\nA police officer stands guard as President Donald Trump speaks to supporters at an evening rally on August 15, 2019 in Manchester, New Hampshire.

(Photo: Pool, Getty Images)\n\n\"When they wear their uniform, they're representing their departments, they're not representing themselves,\" he said. \"If they're not working, most departments would prohibit them from wearing their uniform to a political rally.\"\n\nKroll argues the policy underscores the political divide between officials in Minneapolis, a Democratic stronghold, and local officers who may skew more Republican.\n\nHe and other officers came under scrutiny in 2018 when they appeared in a campaign ad with former Republican Gov. Tim Pawlenty, who promised to crack down on immigration. Mayor Frey and other officials criticized the ad, noting the officers' appearance conflicted with Minneapolis status as a \"sanctuary city.\"\n\n\u201cThis is the party that preaches are all welcome here,\" Kroll said of Minnesota's Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, the local Democratic party. \"They\u2019re supposed to be accepting of all \u2014 except Republicans.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/08/minneapolis-police-barred-wearing-uniforms-trump-rally/3867427002/", "description": "The policy change came the day after Trump announced he would host a rally in Minneapolis, and the head of the local police union argues it was meant to favor the city's Democratic officials.", "authors": ["Courtney Subramanian", "Published A.M.
