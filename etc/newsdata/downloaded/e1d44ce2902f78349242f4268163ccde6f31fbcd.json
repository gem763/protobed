CMO titles have been eliminated or gone unfilled this year at brands including Uber Technologies Inc., Johnson & Johnson and Beam Suntory Inc.\n\nAbout 70% of large companies have CMOs at the corporate level, down from roughly 74% in 2009, according to estimates by leadership advisory firm Spencer Stuart.\n\nMany companies that have dropped the CMO title have named chief customer officers or chief growth officers in their place. \u201cThey\u2019re pretty pragmatic,\u201d Mr. Johnston said of those titles. \u201cIf you\u2019re a chief growth officer, it\u2019s like \u2018OK, here\u2019s the keys, let\u2019s grow.\u2019 If you\u2019re a chief customer officer, it means everything that touches the consumer is going to be your responsibility.\u201d\n\nThe shift can be good for marketing executives, said Amanda Tolleson, the chief customer officer at samples-subscription company Birchbox Inc. The company promoted her from CMO last year and eliminated her previous title.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re about a customer- and brand-driven business strategy, not a customer- and brand-driven marketing strategy,\u201d Ms. Tolleson said, explaining the change. \u201cThere are marketing implications, but also technology implications, and merchandising implications and employee implications.\u201d\n\nThis spring, Birchbox raised its price for the first time, to help fund improvements in the customer experience. \u201cI was the executive leader of that across the traditional marketing team but also the technology plan and the experience changes,\u201d Ms. Tolleson said. \u201cLeading that entire cross-functional initiative for the company is not typically what you think a CMO would do.\u201d\n\nOf course, companies could pursue similar strategies by keeping the CMO title but giving it more responsibility, and companies such as PayPal Holdings Inc. have restored the CMO post after letting it lapse.\n\nThe biggest factor in whether a company retains the title is how its leadership views marketing, said Forrester\u2019s Mr. Johnson.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very cautious about saying the title will go away,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we go through a generation where we understand that marketing to a customer is much more than showing them an ad, then we may see the title gaining ground.\u201d\n\nForrester\u2019s report also predicts rising importance for CMOs in employee loyalty and attracting talent; new moves to involve consumers in shaping companies\u2019 brands and products; and more scrutiny on technology spending.\n\nWrite to Nat Ives at nat.ives@wsj.com", "description": "CMO roles at many companies can isolate marketing activities and encourage other executives to treat marketing as an afterthought, said Keith Johnston, vice president and research director at Forrester Research Inc., which predicts fewer such positions in a new report about the year ahead for CMOs.", "authors": ["Nat Ives", "Nat.Ives Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-120934/social", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
