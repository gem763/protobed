The way South Africa has gotten behind him, it means a lot to unite the country.\n\n\"He's been exemplary, so it\u2019d be amazing to win this World Cup with him as captain.\"\n\nMtawarira, who has 116 Test matches to his name, has represented the Boks for well over a decade. Playing in a World Cup final, though, is something he has not experienced before.\n\n\"It means a great deal,\" he said.\n\n\"There's a lot of excitement back home, a lot of fans behind the team. For us it\u2019s just inspiring. We want to go out there and represent our country the best we can.\"\n\nNow 34, the 'Beast' clearly remembers watching on as the Boks beat England to win the 2007 final in Paris.\n\n\"It was amazing, inspirational stuff,\" he said.\n\n\"Now to be part of a World Cup final is a dream for me, a dream come true. I feel like I\u2019ve worked hard in my career to get here so I'll make it count.\"\n\nKick-off on Saturday is at 11:00 (SA time).", "description": "Prop Tendai Mtawarira says that Springbok skipper Siya Kolisi has won the support of the South African public.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7982/83756d4d1bd54f70be6a794b5535f437.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
