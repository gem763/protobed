Some worry it could wreak havoc during the 2020 elections. Most media attention about deepfakes has focused on prominent public figures and lawmakers, such as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., but the authors write that private citizens will eventually be harmed by the technology.\n\nAlthough researchers are looking into technological solutions, and Facebook recently released a dataset to allow the testing of new models aimed at detecting deepfakes, the Data and Society report warns against relying solely on Big Tech.\n\n\"More encompassing solutions might be to enact federal measures on corporations to encourage them to more meaningfully address the fallout from their massive gains in the past 15 years,\" the authors write in the report's conclusion.\n\nThe entire report can be viewed here.\n\nGET THE FOX NEWS APP", "description": "Artificial intelligence-based solutions may not be able to save us from deceptively altered videos, known as deepfakes, according to a new report from Data and Society.", "authors": ["Christopher Carbone"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/06/562618-deepfake-zuckerberg-video-still.png", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
