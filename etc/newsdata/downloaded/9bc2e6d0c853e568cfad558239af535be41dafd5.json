The average U.S. tax on Chinese imports now stands at 21.2%, up from just 3.1% when President Donald Trump took office.\n\nThe bruising trade tussle has roiled bourses and upset supply chains for over a year, hastening fears of a global recession. Nevertheless, there is no sign of a resolution in sight, with Trump tweeting on Aug. 23, \u201cWe don\u2019t need China and, frankly, would be far better off without them.\u201d\n\nEconomists at the China Europe International Business School (CEIBS) and Open University of Hong Kong disagree. A new number-crunching analysis says only China has the manufacturing capacity to satisfy the U.S.\u2019s huge appetite for products, meaning American consumers must continue to buy from China or U.S. retailers will suffer.\n\nConversely, American demand far outstrips the rest of the world combined, meaning China cannot replace its American customers with those elsewhere for the foreseeable future\u2014or at all.\n\n\u201cReplacing the [U.S.-China trade] relationship with any other country is impossible in the short to medium term and possibly in the long term also,\u201d says Professor Bala Ramasamy, associate dean at CEIBS. \u201cIt is the relationship between a very large and insatiable market and a very well-oiled production machine.\u201d\n\nTake cellphones, for example, which alone accounted for 13% of total imports from China to the U.S. last year, worth some $70 billion. If all the cellphones the U.S. exports\u2014some $10 billion\u2019s worth\u2014were kept for domestic consumption and combined with all those produced by second-place exporter Vietnam\u2014around $30 billion\u2019s worth\u2014it still wouldn\u2019t be enough to satisfy the U.S. market.\n\nBy the same token, Beijing would require the Netherlands, the U.K., Germany, India, Sweden and France to source all their cellphones from China just to replace the value of American imports. It\u2019s a picture repeated for a myriad of other consumer products.\n\n\u201cOur research findings may offer a basis on which to cool recently increasing tensions and rhetoric,\u201d says Ramasamy.\n\nWrite to Charlie Campbell at charlie.campbell@time.com.", "description": "A new analysis says only China has the manufacturing capacity to satisfy U.S. appetite, while China cannot replace its American customers", "authors": ["Charlie Campbell"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/u.s._china_trade.jpg?quality=85&w=1024&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
