Oshie worked on creating scoring opportunities this summer. Now, he leads the team in goals.", "language": "en", "text": "One day, Reirden saw Oshie at the rink and told him: \u201cHey, I think you\u2019re smart enough to create stuff and done a good job and if there is ever anything you want help with or suggestions, just don\u2019t hesitate to ask.\u201d\n\nOshie texted him that night: \u201cHey, if you have any suggestions I\u2019m definitely open.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSoon, the two got together and looked at players around the league who played a style similar to Oshie\u2019s, breaking down exactly how they were creating scoring opportunities. Reirden put together some analytic numbers and a video package that included 35-year-old Joe Pavelski of the Dallas Stars, who could score 30-plus goals each season just being around the net.\n\nAD\n\nThat style of play, Reirden said, is what Oshie needed to emulate this season to increase his scoring chances. So far, it\u2019s worked: He has a team-leading six goals through nine games.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s doing a better job of working from the net out as opposed to working from out in,\u201d Reirden said. \u201cI think that has allowed him to create a bit of space for himself so he can either converge on rebounds more, tip pucks away from the net and actually just re-continue to reinvent himself as a player.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOshie always has had the confidence to score, but he wasn\u2019t allowing himself to get consistent opportunities because he thought he was a playing a \u201clittle too perimeter.\u201d In the offseason, Oshie realized the bulk of his scoring was more off the rush and cycling, but he wasn\u2019t happy with his play around the net.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty simple,\u201d Oshie explained. \u201cIt\u2019s being around the net more and letting my creativity and my hand-eye coordination just give me the opportunity to score more goals or get more tips or create more offense, more scoring chances. I feel like I did a fairly decent job at getting to the net front before, I think there is just a little bit more emphasis now.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThis season, Oshie said, he\u2019s actively seeking scoring opportunities in increased loads and \u201cnot necessarily looking to support\u201d as much as he did before. Typically playing alongside Lars Eller and Jakub Vrana last season, Oshie knows their ability to beat their one-on-one matchups, so at the very worst, Oshie said, being net front is occupying one of their defenders and in turn, benefiting his entire line. Reirden said some players need to stand in front of the net and be a screen, but since Oshie has the mind-set to go toward that area instinctively, he immediately becomes an offensive option.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s getting to the side of the net that he knows defensemen that can\u2019t shoot it on net will shoot it to him as a \u2018side of the net tip,\u2019 \u201d Reirden said. \u201cHe\u2019s added that element to the game and our defensemen know he will be there too so it has expanded our scoring area for us.\u201d\n\nBut \u201ccrashing the net\u201d and being able to create more scoring chances isn\u2019t easy on the body. Even with his smaller stature, as center Nicklas Backstrom pointed out, Oshie is able to use his toughness to withstand the physical toll . At any given second in front of the net, Oshie will be getting hacked or cross-checked on the back, calves, anything really lower-body. It\u2019s not a glamorous position, but grit is a key part of Oshie\u2019s game.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe guy\u2019s not scared of anything, so he\u2019ll take beatings to stand in there,\u201d goaltender Braden Holtby said. \u201cSometimes when you have John [Carlson] and [Alex Ovechkin] up there, the puck can go wild, too. He just stands right in there and doesn\u2019t even flinch and is fearless. When you do that and have the skills that he does, that\u2019s a pretty good combination.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nDuring the team\u2019s 5-2 win over the New York Rangers Friday, Oshie scored two power-play goals. The first came after he stood firm at the net front waiting for a quick tip opportunity. He collected a pass from Backstrom, who patiently waited for a lane to open up on the front door. While Rangers goaltender Henrik Lundqvist got over pretty quickly, Oshie was able to get three swift cuts at the puck until it slipped past Lundqvist, off the skate of Marc Staal and in. He got flattened by Marc Trouba in the process.\n\n\u201cYou see him whacking away at that puck tonight, but he stays in there and if you keep watching the video, after the puck goes in he is still standing there and he gets run,\u201d forward Garnet Hathaway said. \u201cBut that\u2019s just Osh. He\u2019s not leaving until it goes in.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOshie said he doesn\u2019t have a specific goal benchmark this season after scoring 25 last year, \u201cjust more.\u201d He had a brief drought during the team\u2019s Stanley Cup run, only scoring 18 goals that season, but a year prior had a career-high 33 in 2016-17. He suffered his fifth concussion of his career during the 2018-19 season, and a broken collarbone in the playoffs.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cObviously playing here, playing with some pretty world class players I\u2019ve been able to get above 25 and over other than the one year when I had that big drought which ended up being okay since we won the Cup, but really just more,\u201d Oshie said.\n\nReirden knew the strict limitations Oshie was under while he played seven seasons in St. Louis. But in Washington, the coaches allowed him to be more creative and make more plays with the puck. Oshie described the first two years with the Capitals as an adjustment period for the better and with relatively free rein, he\u2019s seeing the benefits.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cMy first couple years it was a learning curve on not having that coach\u2019s voice in the back my head saying, \u2018You have to chip the puck here, don\u2019t make that move, don\u2019t stick handle,\u2019 \u201d Oshie said. \u201cWhereas they are now saying, \u2018Trust your talent and make plays.\u2019 \u201d\n\nRead more on the Washington Capitals:\n\nAD", "description": "Oshie has scored six goals in nine games, many from in the front of the net.", "authors": ["Samantha Pell", "Reporter Covering High School Sports"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/wCPCag0AArKjtisMqjD0nKW4QSA=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MMHVJQHRHQI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
