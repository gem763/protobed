I am proud to join my Republican and Democrat colleagues in efforts to ensure tech giants can no longer hide behind complexity and complicity,\" Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry said.\n\n\"We need to protect competition in markets so that consumer benefit from choices, so that their privacy is protected, and to ensure that the next generation of tech innovators aren't snuffed out by their powerful competitors,\" North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein added.\n\nFacebook and other big tech companies are already the subject of various federal antitrust investigations. In June, the House Judiciary Committee launched an antitrust investigation of Facebook, Google, and other tech companies. The US Department of Justice (DOJ) in July also launched a sweeping antitrust review into the industry's competitive conditions. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the DOJ are also both reportedly investigating Facebook over antitrust concerns.\n\nAt state level, other big tech companies are also facing similar heat from regulators. Google is currently the focus of a similar antitrust investigation commenced by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton. That investigation, which looks into whether Google is engaging in monopolistic behavior with its online search and advertising business, has so far garnered support from attorneys general from 48 states, Puerto Rico, and Washington DC.\n\nFacebook has already been at the back-end of regulatory restitution, having been recently fined $5 billion by the FTC for privacy violations. As part of the settlement, Facebook also agreed to conduct a massive overhaul of its consumer privacy practices and remove CEO Mark Zuckerberg as its sole privacy decision-maker.\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nFacebook confirms it's the subject of FTC antitrust probe\n\nMeanwhile, Facebook shares were up in after-hours trading as the company exceeded Q2 revenue expectations.\n\nFacebook's big win: Will this ruling have global impact on how your data is used?\n\nWhat was seen as one of the best ways to regulate social-media giants like Facebook has just fallen apart in a D\u00fcsseldorf court.\n\nUS Justice Department launches new, sweeping tech antitrust probe\n\nAmid multiple other antitrust investigations into the US tech industry, the DOJ will now review the competitive landscape of search, social media and retail services online.\n\nGoogle is in serious trouble, warns top anti-trust lawyer\n\nGoogle's case is similar to 19 years ago -- when Microsoft was found guilty of exclusionary conduct\n\n50 US states, territories launch Google antitrust probe\n\nAttorneys general from 48 states, as well as from the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, officially kicked off their preliminary investigation on Monday", "description": "The investigation initially only had support from the attorney generals of eight states.", "authors": ["Campbell Kwan"], "top_image": "https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/06/20/c52967b0-3d74-4307-acae-6cafa4ab4b8c/thumbnail/770x578/83d7ca0924040f89f27cf56b0e1b04c6/facebook-f8-2019-99071.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
