You can come along and watch as well.\"\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nKevin added: \"Tune in at the weekend,\" before a clip of the pair recreating their last dance appeared on the Instagram story.\n\nThe pro said he had found it tough going after being paired with the 61-year-old TV legend.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nBefore the series started, Kevin had predicted that he might struggle to get Anneka up to the level required to compete in the BBC dance competition.\n\nThis proved to be the case as Anneka's Charleston failed to capture the imagination of either the judges or the viewers at home.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nThe routine only managed to reap 11 points out of a possible 40 and judge Bruno Tonioli said Anneka had \"slaughtered\" the Kill Bill themed routine.\n\nFollowing the announcement that Anneka had lost out to former England goalkeeper David James, with his pro partner Nadiya Bychkova, in the dance-off, Kevin was reportedly overheard saying to his fellow dancers, \"I told you so.\"\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nA show insider told The Sun: \"Kevin adores Anneka as a person but professionally he knew his chances of making another final were over, especially as she\u2019s struggled with injury and fitness.\"\n\nThe source continued: \"All is not lost for Kevin though as he apparently has \"a friend for life in Anneka and he loved working with her.\"\n\nKevin will not bow out of Strictly completely though as he will now participate in group dances and the pros\u2019 performances.\n\n*Strictly Come Dancing continues Saturday at 6.40pm on BBC1", "description": "The Strictly star can't accept defeat and jokes he and Anneka Rice will perform live from home", "authors": ["Brogan-Leigh Hurst", "Image", "Instagram"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20535839.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Kevin-Clifton-says-hes-in-denial-after-shock-Strictly-exit.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
