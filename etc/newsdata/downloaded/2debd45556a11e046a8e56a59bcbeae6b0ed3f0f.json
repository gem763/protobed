Knowledge of online markets came into play too: for instance marketing less on Facebook and more on Instagram where beautiful imagery could be shown to better effect.\n\nA conscious decision was also made to stay away from digital channels which did not resonate with the brand, like Twitter. On the other hand, YouTube was used for short video clips on how to make various The Duchess cocktails.\n\nMyth #2: Launch your product and people will come\n\nLe Roux and Smuts took their product to their customers. The Duchess was launched in September 2016 at The Honest Gin Bar in Cape Town, the owner being a friend of the founders.\n\nThen the friends rolled up their sleeves and in December 2016, built and painted a golden drinks trolley and braved their way into three big media houses in Cape Town, serving editors and bloggers with a variety of cocktails made from The Duchess.\n\nBecause the drinks were alcohol-free, they could be enjoyed at work \u2013 at 10am! This campaign paid off, there was exposure in local magazines and blogs and the idea was extended with other bloggers, creating an organic word-of-mouth awareness.\n\nMyth #3: I don\u2019t need to have experience in the business I\u2019m launching\n\nYou cannot open a B&B if you have no experience in the hotel or hospitality industry. Similarly, Johannes Le Roux had previously started Branna's Draft and knew what challenges they would face with The Duchess.\n\nSmuts says, \"From the beginning, Johannes was consciously looking for something that could scale globally. I\u2019ve always had that idea because he\u2019s always had that idea; it was there right from the beginning\".\n\nSmuts, on the other hand, has experience in media, design and advertising, with creative skills, contacts and know-how that could help develop a brand from scratch.\n\nLe Roux and Smuts developed their brand angle, outlining it in a 23-page document that lists photography guidelines, tone and voice.\n\nThey developed their brand on four pillars: music; art, design and fashion; health and adventure; and food.\n\nThese categories provided guidelines for the choice of events they could use to leverage brand awareness. For instance, a Valentine\u2019s Day theme in Newlands Forest featured an exclusive pop-up picnic experience.\n\nMyth #4: All it takes is hard work\n\nIt takes much more than hard work, they found \u2013 you need a good partner, funding, marketing savvy, financial know-how and a passion for your product. A willingness to work hard is commendable but putting your energy and determination in the right place is key.\n\nFor The Duchess launch in the UK, the London Junipalooza festival was chosen as the right venue. Smuts went straight to Ikea in London after his arrival, buying flat-packed furniture and a few household items to build The Duchess stand for the festival.\n\nIt was one of the very few non-alcoholic options at the festival and was well received \u2013 providing a sound foundation for the company to launch into the wider UK market.\n\nThe Duchess faced many challenges too and the case study mentioned how they ran out of stock once, how they encountered a different market in the UK compared to South Africa as well as distribution partnership issues in international countries. But they were able to find solutions and product quality remained crucial.\n\nIn the UK for instance, there are similar products on the market. But The Duchess is made using a secret recipe with a key ingredient from Le Roux\u2019s botanist aunt\u2019s aromatic botanicals, along with orange peel, star anise, cardamom and cloves.\n\nAs Inus puts it: \"People see a non-alcoholic gin and tonic and they just wonder: what\u2019s the point? And then they taste it and they get it\".", "description": "UCT Graduate School of Business researchers look into their remarkable success and debunk a few common myths about entrepreneurship.", "authors": ["Fran Heathcote", "Geoff Bick"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7371/2531657d5c6d48f78ea5622a3a112b5f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
