And this should help the passengers find the fastest way to the lavatory.'\n\nHe also added that the cameras will be just an option offered to airlines.\n\nControversy has been in the air over the use of cameras on board aircraft.\n\nEarlier this year it was revealed that several carriers including Singapore Airlines, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines, have cameras embedded in seatback entertainment screens.\n\nSingapore said the cameras were disabled, but it led to speculation that in-screen working cameras could be used to spy on passengers during flights in the future. The three US airlines also said that they had never activated the cameras and had no plans to use them.\n\nThe new Airbus cabin, called the Airspace Connected Experience, will also be fitted with wireless sensors to collect on-board data about passenger habits, as we reported last year.\n\nSensors embedded in the seats will relay how often a passenger goes to the lavatory, their sleeping patterns and what angle they recline their chair to.\n\nAirbus says the new cabin it will allow carriers to 'usher in a new personalised experience for passengers and provide opportunities for improving airlines\u2019 ancillary revenues and operational efficiencies'\n\nMeanwhile, sensors in the TV screens will allow analysts to track what type of media is most popular, allowing them to better tailor the content to client needs.\n\nIn the galley, sensors embedded in the trolley units will indicate when stocks are running low and what meal choices or beverages prove most popular.\n\nWhile below decks, sensors in the cargo hold would mean that airline staff will be able to monitor the temperature and capacity levels to help keep pets safe and precious goods undamaged.\n\nAirbus says these features will allow carriers to 'usher in a new personalised experience for passengers and provide opportunities for improving airlines\u2019 ancillary revenues and operational efficiencies'.\n\nTesting of the new cabin technology is taking place on board an Airbus A350-900.", "description": "Airbus says cameras will help crew redirect passengers to other bathrooms if there is a queue and signal when someone has spent a long time in the lavatory.", "authors": ["Jennifer Newton For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/03/09/19242328-0-image-a-7_1570093014387.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
