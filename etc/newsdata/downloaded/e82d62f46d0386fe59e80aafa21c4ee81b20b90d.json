He added: \u201cWe will know in those two weeks whether it is possible or not.\u201d\n\nAnother former Tory said: \u201cThere is an element of seeing what the next step is from No 10. A lot would be pretty hesitant about backing a referendum until all other options have been tried. But, more attractive, is a way of bringing a deal back on to the table \u2013 a version of what was agreed between May and Corbyn. And then have a confirmatory vote attached to it, or someone amends one on.\u201d\n\nAnother MP who supports a people\u2019s vote said there were \u201ca number of devices\u201d that could enable MPs to bring forward May\u2019s deal for parliament to work on, and claimed there was \u201clots of movement in the last 24 to 36 hours\u201d among those trying to stop Johnson ignoring parliament\u2019s direction to request an extension from the EU if a deal is not reached by mid-October.\n\nIt comes as Ken Clarke, the veteran Tory who had the whip withdrawn last week, urged Johnson to \u201cput together a cross-party alliance to get a deal through,\u201d as he believed it could now achieve a majority with Labour MPs who regretted having not voted for it previously.\n\nThe father of the House told the Byd yn ei Le programme on Welsh-language channel S4C that he would be willing to be an \u201chonorific figurehead\u201d for an alternative government seeking such a compromise if Johnson does not stitch together a deal.\n\nGroup of cross-party MPs launch bid to reach compromise Brexit deal Read more\n\nIn scathing remarks about the state of politics, he described both Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn as representing \u201can absurd choice for the premiership of this country\u201d and said the situation was the worst crisis in his political lifetime, amounting to a \u201ctragic farce\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Theresa May failed to get her Brexit deal through Parliament. Photograph: Mark Duffy/AFP/Getty Images\n\nParliament has repeatedly failed to find a compromise, but there are signs more opposition MPs are prepared to countenance voting for a deal.\n\nA separate cross-party group of opposition MPs formally launched a campaign to win support for Brexit via a managed deal on Tuesday.\n\nThe founders, who include Labour MPs Stephen Kinnock and Caroline Flint, Lib Dem MP Norman Lamb and former Tory MP Rory Stewart \u2013 claimed up to 50 MPs may back the plan. Their proposal would involve using elements of Theresa May\u2019s Brexit legislation as the basis for an agreement which Boris Johnson could steer through parliament, possibly in time for a 31 October departure.\n\nThose supporting a second referendum would try to amend any proposal for a deal to secure a \u201cpeople\u2019s vote\u201d.\n\nSeveral MPs who support the people\u2019s vote campaign said an increasing number of Tory MPs were coming around to the idea of a confirmatory referendum to break the impasse, including Sir Oliver Letwin, who told the BBC\u2019s Today programme on Tuesday: \u201cIf [Boris Johnson] can\u2019t get a deal that he can bring to the House of Commons and get a majority for, there\u2019s another option of course, which is to bring back a deal and ensure a majority for it by attaching it to a referendum.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s pretty clear there\u2019s a huge number of Labour MPs, Liberal Democrat MPs, SNP MPs, who would vote for any reasonable deal subject to a referendum and I think there\u2019s now an increasing number of Conservatives and ex-Conservatives who would as well, so I think there is a majority there too.\u201d\n\nThe Labour frontbench would be sceptical about voting for any deal that was not negotiated by a Labour prime minister but could come under pressure from many of its MPs and members to compromise if it achieved a second referendum.\n\nAny such moves would increase pressure on Johnson to get his own deal with the EU and on Eurosceptic Tories to back him rather than risk a second referendum.\n\nThere is still a possibility that the prime minister could climb down on his demand to entirely replace the backstop with another solution and settle for a more minor tweak to the political declaration, before putting that fresh deal to a vote and challenging the Eurosceptic holdouts to vote for it or lose the whip.\n\nHowever, he has so far been insistent that what he calls the \u201cantidemocratic backstop\u201d must be removed while the EU is adamant that is not possible, leading to a stalemate on his prospects for a negotiated deal.", "description": "Cross-party majority moving closer as more current and ex-Tories open to idea, source says", "authors": ["Rowena Mason"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/309f2df04d27ef388617da785a5adad4dc8bbe5a/0_5_4439_2665/master/4439.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8b858f54b78caf1287c0948a09456602", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
