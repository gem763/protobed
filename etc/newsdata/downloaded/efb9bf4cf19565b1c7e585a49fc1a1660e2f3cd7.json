Tulsi Gabbard isn\u2019t done responding to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for saying she is being groomed for use as a tool by Russian intelligence agencies.\n\nThe 2020 presidential hopeful from Hawaii called Mrs. Clinton the \u201cembodiment of corruption\u201d last Friday before crafting a plea to supporters on Sunday.\n\n\u201cPeople warned me in 2016 that my endorsement of Bernie Sanders would be the end of my quote, unquote \u2018political career,\u2019 \u201d she said in a Twitter video viewed over 2.1 million times by Monday evening.\n\n\u201cThey said Clinton will never forget, that she and her rich and powerful friends, her allies in politics and the media will make sure that you are destroyed. Well, there have been countless hit pieces full of smears against me from day one of this campaign. They\u2019ve tried to destroy my reputation and my lifetime of service because I stood up to them,\u201d she said.\n\nAt issue is an appearance Mrs. Clinton made on \u201cCampaign HQ\u201d podcast with David Plouffe, in which she alluded to Ms. Gabbard while saying: \u201cShe\u2019s the favorite of the Russians, they have a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her so far. That\u2019s assuming Jill Stein will give it up, which she might not because she\u2019s also a Russian asset. She\u2019s a Russian asset! I mean, totally.\u201d\n\nClinton spokesman Nick Merrill was asked whether the former secretary of state was referring to Ms. Gabbard and he replied, \u201cif the nesting doll fits,\u201d NBC News reported.\n\n\u201cIf they can falsely portray me as a traitor, then they can do it to anyone,\u201d Ms. Gabbard replied while mentioning her years of military service.\n\n\u201cIn fact, that\u2019s exactly the message that they want to get across to you: That if you stand up against Hillary and the party power brokers, if you stand up to the rich and powerful elite and the war machine, they will destroy you and discredit your message. But here is the truth: They will not intimidate us. They will not silence us. We are not here just to protest their corruption. I am running for president to take the Democratic Party and our country back from the corrupt elite. I\u2019m running for president to bring about a new Democratic Party,\u201d she concluded.\n\nMs. Stein, who was the 2016 Green Party presidential candidate, mocked Mrs. Clinton on Twitter for \u201cpeddling conspiracy theories to justify her failure.\u201d\n\nHillary & her gang of rich, powerful elite are going after me to send a msg to YOU: \u201cShut up, toe the line, or be destroyed.\u201d But we, the people, will NOT be silenced. Join me in taking our Democratic Party back & leading a govt of, by & for the people! https://t.co/TOcAOPrxye pic.twitter.com/TahfE2XOek \u2014 Tulsi Gabbard (@TulsiGabbard) October 20, 2019\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
