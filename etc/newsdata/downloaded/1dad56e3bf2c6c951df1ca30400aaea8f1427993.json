Who Will Win?", "language": "en", "text": "Even the old guard politicians occasionally get tripped up and get trapped into a corner that they never needed to be. After yesterday\u2019s painful admission by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that the House would not vote on an \u201cimpeachment inquiry\u201d as has been done in the past, she can only blame herself for being in the corner she is in now.\n\nOh, and A.O.C. and the Progressive cheer squad are coming after her.\n\nAs I talked about on my podcast today, Bourbon On The Rocks, I think Pelosi blinked hard in her admission and is now trying to save face. Bourbon On The Rocks: Nancy Pelosi Blinked #851\n\nNancy Pelosi is an incredibly skilled politician. You don\u2019t become the first woman Speaker of the House, lose that position and get vanquished for 8 years to come back to it again if you are not a master of the process. Those that discount her in this way don\u2019t understand politics. Pelosi has game.\n\nPut another way, if you were in General George S. Patton\u2019s army in World War II and you underestimated your enemies\u2019 strength, you were the one getting slapped.\n\nNever underestimate your opponent when they have a track record of getting stuff done.\n\nHowever, she slipped up 3 weeks ago when she seemed to come out of nowhere talking about impeachment and that it needed to be looked at NOW. Pelosi had been the one slamming on the brakes saying slow down while she was taking flack from her new colleagues in the Squad.\n\nThese ladies think D.C. should work like a Burger King drive-through: your way in less than 10 minutes.\n\nThe Speaker did an about-face on Sept 24th when, according to CNBC, she warmed up to the idea of kicking Donald out of the White House before an election.\n\nPelosi has until now resisted Democrats\u2019 calls for Trump\u2019s impeachment, which have grown steadily in intensity since the release of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia report. She has been privately weighing a possible impeachment inquiry for months \u2014 but early Tuesday morning, Pelosi\u2019s allies were convinced she would not go down that route, sources told CNBC. Hours later, however, those same people were told that she\u2019s planning to move ahead with the inquiry, the sources said.\n\nWhat changed?\n\nWe now know that Adam Schiff\u2019s staff had met with the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d and were told the phone call was damming and explosive. They probably counted on Trump NOT releasing the transcripts of the call. When he did and the nation yawned, they had to find some other angle. As of now, they have not. Even Schiff is not asking for the whistleblower to come testify now, being what is the point?\n\nThe second part of Pelosi\u2019s sudden jump to Impeach I believe was that Alexandria Ocasio Cortez the weekend before started to get lippy on Twitter. She accused the leadership of her caucus in the House of being worse than Trump.\n\nAccording to the Washington Examiner \u2026\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez declared her exasperation with Democratic leadership for their refusal to move forward with impeachment proceedings against President Trump as yet another controversy rocks his administration. A two-month truce with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi cracked just before midnight Saturday when the freshman congresswoman from New York fired a volley on Twitter attacking her own party.\n\nAt this point, the bigger national scandal isn\u2019t the president\u2019s lawbreaking behavior \u2013 it is the Democratic Party\u2019s refusal to impeach him for it. \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) September 22, 2019\n\n\u201cAt this point, the bigger national scandal isn\u2019t the president\u2019s lawbreaking behavior \u2013 it is the Democratic Party\u2019s refusal to impeach him for it,\u201d\n\nThis is why you never listen to kids on climate change or on how to operate in Washington D.C. because they feel and don\u2019t think \u2013 and look at what a mess you have now, Madame Speaker.\n\nSo a veteran of the political wars in the Nation\u2019s capitol just got railroaded into making a bad, bad move by some shady guy named Schiff and a bartender turned non-environmental guru named A.O.C., who really does have a nice $250.00 dollar haircut.\n\nIn my opinion, the Speaker pacified Cortez and her small group when she received bad intel from Schiff and she acted to keep another public spat with the kids from erupting. She now has to try and explain why they will not do an impeachment inquiry vote and break over two centuries of precedent. She can\u2019t explain this one away.\n\nIn the title, I ask who will win in the upcoming battle between the old guard and the new upstarts. I always want to give the edge to experience with age and wisdom.\n\nIn this match, though, I\u2019m afraid that I\u2019m going to give the edge to the upstarts. Not because they are correct but they don\u2019t know any better and they feel they are right as opposed to the calmness that comes over you when you KNOW that you are right.\n\nYouth, vigor, and spreading your feelings via a mass Twitter following will win this battle.\n\nWhich most likely means Trump will win again in 2020.\n\nGods Speed, Speaker Pelosi, you had a good run.\n\nCheck out my other posts here on Red State and my podcast Bourbon On The Rocks plus like Bourbon On The Rocks on Facebook and follow me on the twitters at IRISHDUKE2", "description": "Nancy Pelosi Sets Up a Battle With Alexandria Ocasio Cortez and The Squad.
