Such an outcome would come in below the 12-month average for the headline index on consumer sentiment, which was 96.5 through September.\n\nThe consumer has so far remained a major bastion of strength in the domestic economy, with consumer spending having grown 4.6% in the second quarter, the fastest pace since late 2014. Consumer spending comprises about two-thirds of total domestic economic activity.\n\nBut the consumer optimism that had been reflected in \u201csoft\u201d economic data like the University of Michigan\u2019s sentiment survey has since begun to show cracks as the overhang of a lingering trade war weighs on the outlook. In August \u2013 the month the U.S. declared China a currency manipulator and both the U.S. and China announced more tariffs on one another\u2019s imports \u2013 consumer sentiment fell by the most since 2012.\n\nA near-record one-third of all consumers negatively mentioned trade policies in September when asked to explain factors driving economic expectations, Richard Curtin, University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers chief economist, said last month. And in October-to-date, the trade narrative has only become more complicated, with the Trump administration adding more Chinese firms to a \u201cblack list\u201d preventing them from doing business in the U.S., and imposing a travel ban on some Chinese officials over their alleged connections to human rights violations.\n\nPeople cross Broadway with shopping bags in Manhattan, New York City, U.S. December 27, 2016. REUTERS/Andrew Kelly More\n\nOther concerns have increasingly been thrown into the mix.\n\n\u201cRecent news about an impeachment inquiry and the decline in the stock market are likely to dampen consumer optimism. Sentiment has been range-bound in the past few months, consistent with a slowdown in consumption growth after extreme strength in Q2,\u201d Credit Suisse analysts led by James Sweeney wrote in a note last week. \u201cHowever, we expect consumer demand can hold up during the ongoing current manufacturing slump as the labor market remains resilient.\u201d\n\nThe University of Michigan\u2019s subindex capturing consumers\u2019 expectations for future conditions is also anticipated to have weakened, to 82.5 in October from 83.4 in September. Economists believe consumers\u2019 assessments of current conditions will have moved up slightly to 109.0 in October, from 108.5 in September.\n\nSome other economists are more upbeat on the outlook for the consumer. They note that despite the trade-related uncertainty, hard data on factors most salient to Main Street \u2013 namely, the employment situation \u2013 remain robust. Last week, the Department of Labor\u2019s September jobs report showed the unemployment rate falling to a fresh 50-year low of 3.5%. And Thursday\u2019s most recent print on initial unemployment claims unexpectedly declined for the week, underscoring a job market that remains tight.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s true that most of the recent news headlines about the economy have been pretty gloomy, but the fundamental drivers of consumer confidence have actually remained fairly strong. Initial jobless claims are still close to a 50-year low. Gasoline prices have edged up, but are no higher now than they were in the summer,\u201d Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist for Capital Economics, wrote in a note last week.", "description": "On Friday, investors will receive a snapshot on consumer sentiment in October and hear from several Federal Open Market Committee members ahead of the central bank\u2019s next rate-setting meeting.", "authors": ["Emily Mccormick"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Qr8QGjMCh3K38VYzyP6V3A--~B/aD0zMjk5O3c9NDMwMjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/5ea37b90-eb89-11e9-97f7-93d6c2a6fcb7", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
