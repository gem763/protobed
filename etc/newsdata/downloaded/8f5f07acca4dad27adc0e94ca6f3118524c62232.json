I\u2019ve been here a few times when things haven\u2019t gone our way. This was always one to tick off my bucket list. It\u2019s extremely satisfying,\u201d he said.\n\nThe main early resistance from England came from Joe Denly who made 53 from 123 balls and Jos Buttler, who lasted 111 balls for his 34.\n\nEngland\u2019s hopes of an unlikely escape-act rose when Jack Leach and Craig Overton batted for over an hour giving the crowd belief over a second \u2018miracle\u2019 after the comeback win at Headingley.\n\nBut part-time leg spinner Marnus Labuschagne finally removed Leach, with a ball that turned sharply in the rough and was gloved to Matthew Wade at short leg.\n\nOverton batted with sense, stoicism and a strong technique, but he was trapped lbw by Josh Hazlewood to set off the Australian celebrations.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think it would be this emotional,\u201d said Australia captain Tim Paine.\n\n\u201cThe amount of work that\u2019s gone in to retain the Ashes has been enormous and I\u2019m really proud of this group and how we bounced back from Headingley,\u201d he added.\n\nCricket - Ashes 2019 - Fourth Test - England v Australia - Emirates Old Trafford, Manchester, Britain - September 8, 2019 Australia's celebrate the wicket of England's Craig Overton to win the match and retain the Ashes Action Images via Reuters/Carl Recine\n\nEngland captain Joe Root told the BBC: \u201cI\u2019m bitterly disappointed. I thought the way we fought today, the character we showed, every single one of them can be proud of that today.\n\n\u201cTo come so close to taking it to The Oval is hard to take. We\u2019ve still got to look forward and make sure we level the series.\u201d\n\nTURNING POINT\n\nEngland will look back on the second day of this test as the turning point when they simply could find no way to remove Smith and Australia\u2019s 497-8 declared gave them an advantage that they were unable to seriously challenge.\n\nThe final day was never going to be a run-chase of Headingley vintage, given the target of 383, with England\u2019s task simply to survive until the close.\n\nThat challenge was made all the more difficult after they lost Jason Roy and Ben Stokes before lunch.\n\nRoy was well set before the impressive Cummins bowled him for 31 with a beautiful delivery that cut back off the seam to leave England at 66-3.\n\nThe crowd rose to welcome Stokes, the hero of England\u2019s last day triumph at Headingley, but there was to be no repeat performance from the all-rounder.\n\nAnother fine delivery from Cummins clipped the inside edge of Stokes\u2019s bat and was well taken by wicketkeeper Paine, the England batsman not waiting for the umpire\u2019s verdict as he walked off.\n\nDenly had been the pick of England\u2019s batsmen before he was outdone by sharp turn and bounce from spinner Nathan Lyon, the ball striking his glove and being snaffled up by Labuschagne at short leg.\n\nJonny Bairstow (25) was lbw to Mitchell Starc before Overton came in to join Buttler, in what was probably England\u2019s last realistic chance of a big partnership.\n\nBut Buttler misjudged a delivery from Hazlewood which he left only to see it cut back sharply and clatter into his off-stump.\n\nSlideshow (11 Images)\n\nAustralia keep the Ashes, which they won on home turf last year and it is the first time they have retained the urn since the end of their long period of domination in 2002.\n\nThere is though plenty left to play for when the teams meet again at The Oval on Thursday \u2014 England could level the series while Australia will be desperate to ensure they go home as winners.", "description": "Australia retained the Ashes after beating England by 185 runs at Old Trafford on Sunday to take a 2-1 lead in the series with just one test remaining.", "authors": ["Simon Evans", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190908&t=2&i=1427666794&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF870VQ", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
