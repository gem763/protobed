They did not disappoint.\n\nThis is an admirably thorough segment by Fox about that bizarre moment in the Oval Office yesterday when Trump pulled out a map of Dorian\u2019s projected path towards the southern coast. For one thing, the map was badly outdated; Trump was showing off early projections of the hurricane striking Florida, not the recent projections of it creeping up the east coast, as you\u2019d expect the president to do during a newsy photo op. The really bizarre part, though, was the black line that had been added to the map that appeared to show the cone of the hurricane extending into Alabama. What was that doing there?\n\nIt wasn\u2019t added to the map because Trump had erroneously tweeted a few days ago that Dorian was expected to reach Alabama when that possibility had long since been ruled out at the time by forecasters, was it? He hates to be wrong, but does he hate it so much that he\u2019d alter a map to mislead people into believing he was right?\n\nFox takes you through the whole sad saga, step by step. According to John Roberts\u2019s sources, it wasn\u2019t Trump who drew the line on the map. It was drawn by someone else during a briefing to show him the initial worst-case scenario about the storm\u2019s path. That scenario had been ruled out by forecasters by the time he first tweeted about Alabama on September 1; White House aides think Alabama might have been on his mind because his earliest briefings on the storm impressed upon him how bad things could be *if* Dorian made it to the state. Days later, when he tweeted about Alabama, it was still on his mind even though the latest information had eliminated the chance of landfall there.\n\nIt would have been a one-hour story if he had deleted his original tweet and clarified that Alabama was now out of harm\u2019s way. But you know Trump\u2019s rule: Never admit error. And so, four days later, he\u2019s still tweeting about this, determined to prove that he was right all along.\n\n\u2026.Instead it turned North and went up the coast, where it continues now. In the one model through Florida, the Great State of Alabama would have been hit or grazed. In the path it took, no. Read my FULL FEMA statement. What I said was accurate! All Fake News in order to demean! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 5, 2019\n\nThis was the originally projected path of the Hurricane in its early stages. As you can see, almost all models predicted it to go through Florida also hitting Georgia and Alabama. I accept the Fake News apologies! pic.twitter.com/0uCT0Qvyo6 \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 4, 2019\n\nAlabama was going to be hit or grazed, and then Hurricane Dorian took a different path (up along the East Coast). The Fake News knows this very well. That\u2019s why they\u2019re the Fake News! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 5, 2019\n\nJust as I said, Alabama was originally projected to be hit. The Fake News denies it! pic.twitter.com/elJ7ROfm2p \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 5, 2019\n\nI was with you all the way Alabama. The Fake News Media was not! https://t.co/gO5pwahaj9 \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 5, 2019\n\nAgain, as Fox explains, it\u2019s not that Dorian was *never* projected to reach Alabama. It\u2019s that, *by the time Trump tweeted on September 1*, that possibility had been eliminated. (All of the maps in his tweets are from August 28-30, days before he commented.) He made a simple mistake by relaying outdated info, although one that might have temporarily panicked Alabamians who thought they were out of harm\u2019s way. All he had to do was walk it back. Instead he\u2019s tweeting about this at a moment when Dorian actually has made landfall and is hammering the Carolinas. It\u2019s his strangest and most pointless bit of vanity-driven gaslighting since the even more bizarre dispute over the size of his inauguration crowds during his first week as president.\n\nThe latest from the White House as I write this is a statement from a Homeland Security advisor claiming that he told Trump in a briefing on September 1 that tropical-storm-force winds could conceivably reach the southeastern tip of Alabama \u2014 and by \u201cconceivably\u201d I mean a 5-10% probability. If this doesn\u2019t quiet the media chatter, presumably DHS chief Kevin McAleenan will be forced to say that he warned Trump Alabama could be obliterated five minutes before POTUS sent his tweet. Someone\u2019s taking the fall for this and it\u2019s not Trump.\n\nYou may be surprised to learn the President is not giving this up!! pic.twitter.com/MlYgBPknnv \u2014 Kevin Liptak (@Kevinliptakcnn) September 5, 2019\n\nI\u2019m tempted to link this clip to that \u201cFox & Friends\u201d one from earlier and turn it into a post about how maybe Trump\u2019s right that Fox is out to get him, but nah.
