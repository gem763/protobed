Follow-through has never been Trump\u2019s strong suit.\n\nWorst of all are the appointments and policy prescriptions that no conservative could ever endorse: lawyer Christopher Wray as head of a tarnished FBI, now tracking border groups opposed to US immigration policy as \u201cextremist organizations\u201d; and his bruiting of \u201cred flag\u201d laws to preemptively disarm Americans without due process on suspicion of mental illness \u2014 including using home-espionage equipment such as Amazon Echo and Apple Watch to collect data on individuals. All of which makes Trump eminently beatable next year.\n\nThat\u2019s the bad news.", "description": "", "authors": ["Michael Walsh", "Nypost.Com"], "top_image": ""}
