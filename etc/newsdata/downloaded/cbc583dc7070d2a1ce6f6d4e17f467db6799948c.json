Victory for Holland would put them above their opponents on goal difference - and with a match in hand - which could really derail the Green and White Army's Euro hopes.\n\nVirgil van Dijk will be looking to put a big dent in Northern Ireland's Euro 2020 hopes\n\nSCOTLAND'S NIGHTMARE COULD CONTINUE\n\nScotland's Euro hopes are all but over, having picked up just six points from as many games - already a massive 12 points off pace-setters Belgium in Group I following a disastrous run of results.\n\nSteve Clarke is enduring a torrid time as Scotland boss, losing the last three qualifiers in insipid fashion against Belgium (twice) and Russia, shipping nine goals in that time.\n\nScotland face Russia away on Thursday and their horrid run could continue before they face San Marino at Hampden Park just three days later.\n\nScotland have endured a torrid time during qualification, claiming six points from six games\n\nIS THIS WHEN FELIX'S PORTUGAL CAREER TAKES OFF?\n\nJoao Felix has played understudy to five-time Ballon d'Or winner and Juventus star Cristiano Ronaldo after emerging onto the international scene with reigning Euro champions Portugal.\n\nFelix has been mooted to follow in his compatriot's footsteps and had earned a staggering \u00a3114million move to Spanish giants Atletico Madrid from Portuguese outfit Benfica after emerging as one of the hottest talents in world football.\n\nBut he has found international life tough, failing to score in three senior appearances for Portugal. However, that could all be about to change for the 19-year-old as his country get ready to play Luxembourg at home before travelling to Ukraine.\n\nHuge talent Joao Felix is hoping to get his international career up and running with Portugal\n\nHISTORY BECKONS FOR RAMOS\n\nWe are about to witness history in Spain as Sergio Ramos gets ready to become the country's most-capped player ever against Norway away during Euro qualifying on Saturday.\n\nThe Real Madrid captain currently sits on a record-equalling 167 caps for Spain alongside goalkeeping legend Iker Casillas. But Ramos is about to go one better this weekend.\n\nThe 33-year-old centre-back has enjoyed a remarkable international career, winning the World Cup in 2010, as well as the Euros back-to-back in 2008 and 2012 with Spain.\n\nReal Madrid centre-back Sergio Ramos is set to become Spain's most capped-player\n\nTHE RENAISSANCE OF ITALY\n\nAfter missing out on the 2018 World Cup following play-off heartache against Sweden, international giants Italy had reached the lowest of lows.\n\nBut under Roberto Mancini, the Azzurri have bounced back emphatically and could become one of the earliest qualifiers for the Euros if they beat Greece on Saturday night and if Armenia fail to win against Liechtenstein.\n\nThe Italians have enjoyed the perfect campaign so far, claiming 18 points from six matches in their qualifying group. And they could be about to have a big party in Rome on the weekend.\n\nRoberto Mancini has led an Italian renaissance after taking over as manager in May last year\n\nTOTTENHAM STAR SON IN PYONGYANG\n\nThey may in fact play against each other quite regularly, but for the first time in almost 30 years, South Korea will travel to heated rivals North Korea in Pyongyang next Tuesday.\n\nTottenham star Son Heung-min and his South Korean team-mates travel to the Kim Il Sung stadium next week but they will have to quickly forget about the historic significance of the occasion to walk away with three points.\n\nSon Heung-min and his South Korea team-mates travel to North Korea next week\n\nBRAZIL ON THEIR TRAVELS ONCE AGAIN...\n\nFor some countries, the international break offers the opportunity to take in new surroundings for the first time. And Brazil are again continuing their globe-trotting tour.\n\nNeymar and Co will bring the colour to Singapore over the next fortnight as they look to maximise their commercial revenue once more.\n\nAnd who are they playing you ask? Well, they will be taking on Senegal and then Nigeria in Singapore...", "description": "There is plenty at stake over the next fortnight with teams on the brink of qualifying for the European Championships in 2020, while some nations hit the road for some eagerly-anticipated friendlies.", "authors": ["Jonathan Spencer For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/12/19487912-0-image-a-16_1570620061802.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
