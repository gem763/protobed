Katie Hill Emerge", "language": "en", "text": "Rep. Katie Hill (D-CA), an openly bisexual member of Congress, was hit with yet another series of compromising photos on Thursday amid a House Ethics Committee investigation into her questionable behavior.\n\nThe latest photos, which were first published by The Daily Mail, show what appears to be a fully nude Hill with a bong in her hand, and another photo that shows Hill kissing a staff worker on her congressional campaign. The staff worker, who was reportedly involved in a \u201cthrouple\u201d relationship with Hill and Hill\u2019s husband, Kenny Heslep, was identified by the Daily Mail as Morgan Desjardins of Santa Clarita, California.\n\nA waist tattoo on Hill of what appears to be an iron cross can be seen in the nude photo, which was taken on September 11, 2017, in which Hill is holding a bong. While it is unclear whether Hill possessed a medical marijuana card at the time the photo was taken, it is clear that the photo was taken before recreational marijuana was legal in California.\n\nLast week, Breitbart News\u2019s Hannah Bleau reported on RedState\u2019s claims against Hill:\n\nRedState obtained text messages and photos which allegedly suggest that Rep. Katie Hill \u2014 who is currently undergoing divorce proceedings \u2014 carried out a two-year relationship with one of her female staffers, who was hired in 2017. Hill\u2019s husband, Kenny Heslep, was reportedly part of the \u201cthrouple\u201d relationship, a term used to describe three individuals involved in a consensual romantic relationship. According to RedState, the three \u2014 Hill, Heslep, and the young female staffer \u2014 \u201ctook multiple vacations together, including to Alaska, where this photograph was taken.\u201d The image referenced allegedly shows a censored image of Hill brushing the staffer\u2019s hair in the nude. Other images allegedly show Hill and the staffer kissing. According to RedState, the \u201cthrouple\u2019s\u201d relationship changed once Hill moved to D.C., and Hill \u201cbroke off her relationships with both Heslep and the staffer, claiming she wanted to focus on \u2018this important work\u2019 and that it wasn\u2019t fair to be involved in a relationship.\u201d The outlet shared screenshots of text messages allegedly between Hill and the staffer, who was \u201cdistraught and trying to figure out how to move on with her life.\u201d\n\nIn a letter sent to her constituents on Wednesday, Hill apologized and said she hopes people will respect the staffer\u2019s privacy:\n\nI know that even a consensual relationship with a subordinate is inappropriate, but I still allowed it to happen despite my better judgment. For that I apologize. I wish nothing but the best for her and hope everyone respects her privacy in this difficult time.\n\nEarlier this year, Hill and Heslep divorced. In a statement following the divorce, Hill claimed it was an \u201cabusive marriage.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am going through a divorce from an abusive husband who seems determined to try to humiliate me,\u201d Hill said in the statement. \u201cI am disgusted that my opponents would seek to exploit such a private matter for political gain.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cThis coordinated effort to try to destroy me and the people close to me is despicable and will not succeed. I, like many women who have faced attacks like this before, am stronger than those who want me to be afraid.\u201d\n\nEarlier this week, Hill denied that she had an affair with two different staff members despite photographic and text message evidence of the affairs already published by conservative website Red State.", "description": "Katie Hill was hit with yet another series of compromising photos amid a House Ethics Committee investigation into her questionable behavior.", "authors": ["Kyle Morris"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Katie-Hill-Womens-March-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
