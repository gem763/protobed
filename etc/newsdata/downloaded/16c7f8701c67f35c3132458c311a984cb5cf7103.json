The researchers also investigated foreclosure mitigation approaches and proposed a novel way through which government officials could stem the onset of future housing downturns.\n\nFor starters, the wave of foreclosures caused major financial losses for lenders \u2014 especially when they kept the loans on their books rather than securitizing them or selling them to mortgage giants Fannie Mae\n\nand Freddie Mac\n\nThese losses ate up the available funds that could be used to extend new loans to consumers. As a result, lenders were forced to ration credit more aggressively, leading to a larger share of potential borrowers being denied mortgages. That dampened both housing demand and home prices.\n\nThe \u201cforeclosure flag effect\u201d also helps maintain a depressed housing market. Homeowners who are foreclosed upon are flagged as risky by credit bureaus and, as a result, they\u2019re unable to get another loan to buy a home for an extended period of time.\n\n\u201cBoth the lender-rationing effect and foreclosure-flag effect result in an imbalance of buyers and sellers, reducing the probability that a seller contacts a buyer and lowering equilibrium prices,\u201d the researchers wrote.\n\nRead more: America\u2019s zip codes are becoming more economically segregated \u2014 how this impacts you and your kids\n\nMeanwhile, those people who can afford to buy a home (or qualify for a mortgage) are presented with more options. Foreclosed properties are typically sold at a major discount, so these \u201cchoosey\u201d buyers become more selective, driving values of non-foreclosed homes down even further.\n\nResearchers estimated that the choosey-buyer and foreclosure-flag effects accounted for 32.3% of the decline in aggregate home prices during the last housing crisis, while the credit rationing lenders engaged in represented another 27.1% of the drop in prices.\n\nAltogether, the initial shock that caused prices to start declining in the first place actually only caused approximately 41% of the decline in aggregate prices and 52% of the decline in prices for non-distressed homes, the researchers said. In the last housing crisis that sparked the Great Recession, the housing market became over-saturated with stock and home prices plunged in many areas. (The builders were responding to the high demand for homes fueled by the subprime mortgage boom.)\n\nHow the government could best address foreclosures\n\nThe researchers compared four approaches to mitigating the negative impact of foreclosures and housing downturns:\n\n\u2022 Slowing down the rate of foreclosure completions\n\n\u2022 Government bailouts of lenders\n\n\u2022 Reducing the principal owed on loans through mortgage modifications\n\n\u2022 The government purchasing distressed homes and then slowly reintroducing them into the market\n\nAlso see: The No. 1 most expensive state to buy a home in \u2014 it\u2019s not New York or California\n\nResearchers found the last approach to be especially effective. With this strategy, the government buys homes that were owned by people who have missed mortgage payments and then holding onto the property until demand for homes rebounds. Researchers found that this approach leads to a 40.3% decrease in the number of foreclosures and a 44.8% smaller decline in home prices nationally.\n\nResearchers calculated that the total cost to the government of buying these homes would be $2,150 per household in the test scenario, not including the costs of maintaining the properties while they are vacant. This cost reflects the up-front expense of purchasing a home from its distressed owners, the researchers explained, net the eventual proceeds the government earns when it sells the property later on to a new buyer.\n\nIt appears to be more effective than the alternative: Bailing out 50% of lenders\u2019 foreclosure-related losses would cost $2,175 per household. However, a bailout of that size only reduced the number of foreclosures by 19.3%, the report added.", "description": "Foreclosures caused by a burst housing bubble have many long-term consequences for the housing market.", "authors": ["Jacob Passy"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ587_forecl_ZG_20190903132613.jpg"}
