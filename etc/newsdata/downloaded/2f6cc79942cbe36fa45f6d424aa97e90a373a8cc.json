Ted Cruz and Andrew Yang", "language": "en", "text": "The next Democratic presidential primary debate will take place later tonight in Houston but another event will probably happen soon in the city as well: A one-on-one basketball game between Democrat primary candidate Andrew Yang and Texas Senator Ted Cruz (R).\n\nYang recently did an interview on a basketball court and when he was asked a question about which one of his fellow Democratic candidates he\u2019d \u201cwant to challenge\u2026to a game of one-on-one,\u201d Yang answered that he\u2019d like to play the president of the United States.\n\nYang said he \u201cwould school\u201d Donald Trump in such a game, adding, \u201cDonald Trump, oh my gosh, he\u2019d just be standing there being like \u2018awhhh, awhhh\u2019 and I\u2019d be like, score left, score right, score a jump shot. And he\u2019d be li--I don\u2019t know what he would do,\u201d Yang said, suggesting that the president might \u201cgas out at some point. So, it\u2019d be Donald Trump. I like the other candidates a great deal, we all get along quite well and we\u2019re all unified in beating Donald Trump in 2020.\u201d\n\nSen. Ted Cruz entered the picture when Fox News Producer Pat Ward suggested a Yang v. Cruz match up.\n\nSen. Cruz responded by declaring that \u201cYou gotta poll at 5% or more to play on my court.\u201d\n\nSorry. You gotta poll at 5% or more to play on my court. https://t.co/xRx6VYdWft \u2014 Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) September 11, 2019\n\nYang shot back with a screenshot of a poll and informed Cruz that he \u201cwould be delighted\u201d to defeat the Texas Senator in game of hoops.\n\nTed I would be delighted to beat you in basketball. ???? pic.twitter.com/RHFrdAfcZ9 \u2014 Andrew Yang (@AndrewYang) September 12, 2019\n\nWhen Sen. Cruz suggested a four-on-four matchup with $5,000 stakes for the apolitical charity of the victor\u2019s choosing, Yang countered by suggesting a man versus man matchup instead. And Cruz, in the form of a meme, told him to \u201cjust bring it.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s play one-on-one. Give the fans a show. ?? \u2014 Andrew Yang (@AndrewYang) September 12, 2019\n\nHmm. You\u2019re taller than I am. From the video, you\u2019re probably a better shot. And, I\u2019ve seen you dunking (on an 8-foot rim). Altogether, pretty strong. So....... https://t.co/hVlhDfKS1W pic.twitter.com/cMepUnKWlu \u2014 Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) September 12, 2019\n\nUh...crap. Ok, now I\u2019m glad we\u2019re doing one-on-one instead! ???? https://t.co/zqln6CSudA \u2014 Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) September 12, 2019\n\nThis wouldn\u2019t be the Senator\u2019s first foray into celebrity basketball matches. He played against late night host Jimmy Kimmel last year.\n\nAccording to The Dallas Morning News it sounds like the game is will actually happen:\n\nCruz confirmed Thursday morning that the game is on. \u201cI think so. Right before I walked in, I accepted,\u201d Cruz told a group of reporters at a breakfast hosted by The Christian Science Monitor. The Yang campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAs Townhall has previously reported, Yang\u2019s platform includes policy positions like a $12,000 per year universal basic income for every American, voting rights for 16-year-olds and Congressional term limits.\n\nWhen I see an eight-foot rim I know exactly what to do. ?? pic.twitter.com/IFVB4EIiRH \u2014 Andrew Yang (@AndrewYang) September 11, 2019\n\nWarming up in Houston ?????? pic.twitter.com/YSwDBy5rz6 \u2014 Andrew Yang (@AndrewYang) September 11, 2019\n\nThe candidate is supposed to deliver some sort of surprise at tonight\u2019s debate. We\u2019ll see what happens.\n\nAndrew Yang\u2019s campaign manager just called to tell me that at tomorrow night\u2019s debate, Yang will be doing \"something no presidential candidate has ever done before in history.\u201d He declined to go further than that. \u2014 Sam Stein (@samstein) September 11, 2019\n\nFor those wondering I will be crowdsurfing in sandals at Thursday\u2019s debate. \u2014 Andrew Yang (@AndrewYang) September 11, 2019\n\nTwo words for the debate stage tomorrow night: Gold chain. \u2014 Andrew Yang (@AndrewYang) September 11, 2019\n\nWhile Yang is almost certainly joking about crowd-surfing at the debate, he did actually do a little crowd-surfing recently:", "description": ".09/12/2019 19:37:10PM EST.", "authors": ["Alex Nitzberg", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/44/0fded05f-9249-46b6-aa78-3bcb1acadb2f.png", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
