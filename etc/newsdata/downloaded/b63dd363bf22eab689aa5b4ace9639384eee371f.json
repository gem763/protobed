Highlights:\n\nDemocrat Bill Richardson, who dubbed himself the \"informal undersecretary for thugs,\" is hardly the only recent example of personal presidential diplomacy.\n\nColonel Edward M. House was Woodrow Wilson's go-to envoy during World War I because Wilson was at odds with his secretary of state, William Jennings Bryan.\n\nPresident Franklin Delano Roosevelt relied on Harry Hopkins as envoy to Joseph Stalin because FDR thought the State Department too hostile to the Soviets to focus on defeating Hitler.\n\nHopkins was accused of using his relationship with the president as a vehicle for collecting boodle abroad -- including a $500,000 emerald necklace for his wife.\n\nCoca-Cola boss J. Paul Austin was Jimmy Carter's personal envoy to Cuba even though he had a personal business interest there: opening a bottling plant.\n\nThe tradition began with George Washington, who enlisted Gouverneur Morris as a \"private agent\" in Europe.\n\nBottom line: President Trump has strong historical precedents behind him in going outside normal channels to pursue diplomacy. And Giuliani wouldn't be the first personal presidential envoy accused of profiting from the experience.\n\nRead Full Article\n\nThe Trump Investigations: Top Articles\n\nQuid Pro Quo and Other Allegations by Envoy to Ukraine, New York Times\n\nFive Reasons, Not Just One, Behind Trump's Action on Ukraine, Examiner\n\nTrump Disputed: Ukraine Knew of Aid Hold, New York Times\n\nThe Revenge of the State Department, Politico\n\nWhat Hunter Biden Did at Burisma (He Never Went to Ukraine), Reuters\n\nHunter Biden's Work in Romania Raises Questions, NBC\n\nHow Pair Hustled to Profit Off Giuliani, Trump Ties, CNN\n\nDurham's FBI Probe Is Now a Criminal Investigation: Sources, Fox\n\nLikely Outcry: Trump Made Durham Probe Political, New York Times\n\n\n\nOther Noteworthy Articles and Series\n\nHow American Schools Spy on Millions of Kids\n\nGuardian\n\nTech companies are now monitoring the emails and documents of millions of American students, across thousands of school districts, looking for signs of suicidal thoughts, bullying or plans for a school shooting. This article reports that the new school surveillance technology doesn\u2019t turn off when the school day is over: Anything students type in official school email accounts, chats or documents is monitored 24 hours a day, whether students are in their classrooms or their bedrooms. Tech companies are also working with schools to monitor students\u2019 web searches and internet usage, and, in some cases, to track what they are writing on public social media accounts. Parents and students are still largely unaware of the scope and intensity of school surveillance, and there is still no independent evaluation of whether this kind of surveillance technology actually works to reduce violence and self-harm.\n\nDrug, Device Firms Paid $1 Million Each to 700+ Doctors\n\nProPublica\n\nDoes investigative journalism always make a difference? Back in 2013, ProPublica detailed what seemed a stunning development in the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s drive to win the prescription pads of the nation\u2019s doctors: In just four years, one doctor had earned $1 million giving promotional talks and consulting for drug companies; 21 others had made more than $500,000. Six years later \u2013 despite often damning scrutiny from prosecutors and academics \u2013 such high earnings have become commonplace. More than 700 doctors have received at least $1 million and 2,500 physicians have received at least half a million dollars apiece from drugmakers and medical device companies in the past five years alone, a new ProPublica analysis of payment data shows. And that doesn\u2019t include money for research or royalties from inventions. One caveat: the total number of doctors paid by industry (about 600,000) remained flat between 2014 and 2018 as did the amount of money drug and medical device companies paid doctors for speaking and consulting (between $2.1 billion and $2.2 billion per year) indicating that more of the money is going to high-end stars.\n\nThe Collapse of America's Emergency Medical Services\n\nNBC News\n\nHere\u2019s another reason you can't keep 'em down on the farm: There is no guarantee help will arrive if you call 911 with a health emergency in rural communities across the country. Because there are so few hospitals, this article reports, many small-town ambulance services run on altruism alone. And those ambulance services are closing in record numbers, putting around 60 million Americans at risk of being stranded in a medical emergency.\n\nNYC Students Can Graduate Without Attending School\n\nNew York Post\n\nGoing to class is not required to receive a diploma from New York City high schools. While city schools must take attendance, kids can still pass or be promoted even if chronically absent, which means missing more than 10 percent of days. Instead, students who \u201cmeet class expectations\u201d must receive credit, and \u201care not required to make up the exact hours of missed class time,\u201d the education department says. Maspeth High School \u2013 which touts a 99 percent graduation rate \u2013 is currently under investigation by the Queens District Attorney\u2019s office and the Department of Education for allegedly exploited this loophole by giving \u201cworksheets\u201d to teens who have missed months of classes. \u201cIf students hand in anything, whether it\u2019s correct or not, you have to pass them,\u201d said one of multiple Maspeth whistleblowers.\n\nEl Salvador: Disappearances Are Back\n\nWashington Post\n\nThe official murder rate has fallen sharply in El Salvador in recent years, but that doesn\u2019t mean the killing has stopped. Instead criminals are more careful. Three decades after a brutal civil war characterized by never-explained, never-resolved disappearances, Salvadorans are again vanishing. National police say at least 2,457 people were reported disappeared in 2018, the most in a dozen years. The attorney general\u2019s office puts the figure at 3,437 \u2014 more than the total number of homicides.\n\nHow GM Food Foes Killed a Super-Rice to Feed Millions\n\nForeign Policy\n\nA million poor children die each year and another half a million go blind because of Vitamin A deficiency. Two decades ago it seemed this calamity could be addressed through a modern miracle called Golden Rice. But in the 20 years since it was created, Golden Rice has not been made widely available to those for whom it was intended. So what happened? This article reports:\n\n... Golden Rice is a genetically modified organism, and as such is weighed down with all the political, ideological, and emotional baggage that has come to be associated with GMOs\u2014stultifying government overregulation, fear and hostility, and criticism (much of it unfounded) from environmentalist and other activist organizations and individuals. Greenpeace, for one, was especially vocal in its condemnation of genetically engineered foods, Golden Rice in particular.\n\nInformant Tells of FBI Power to Spy On Rightist Extremists\n\nIntercept\n\nIn 1975 the country was shocked to learn of abuses by the CIA, NSA, IRA and FBI exposed by the Church Committee \u2013 including persistent efforts to spy on Americans because of their political beliefs. This article reports that it is still happening. But instead of civil rights workers, war protesters and alleged communists, today\u2019s targets are alleged white supremacist and members of other groups defined as far-right. It tells the story through the experiences of an Army veteran recruited by the FBI to monitor militia groups in California. \u201cI was just a human recording machine paid by the government to go into people\u2019s lives and befriend them and find out what they were thinking,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter doing that time and time again, there was just nothing actionable, and I would think, Why after a year or so of me doing that didn\u2019t they stop it?\u201d\n\nWith Men Adrift, the End of Men's Magazines\n\nCity Journal\n\nThis fascinating article uses the decline of men\u2019s magazines such as Esquire, Playboy and GQ to explore the problems men face \u2013 including higher rates of opioid abuse and suicide than women while earning fewer college degrees. Traditionally such magazines had two missions: to turn men into consumers while telling them how men should act and think. As privileged and problematic as that project might seem now, it served a purpose. In more recent years, as masculinity has been attacked as toxic, some men are adrift in a land of confusion. \u201cTo be clear,\u201d Brian Patrick Eha writes, \u201cthis decline is nothing to celebrate. Without mass-market men\u2019s magazines to serve as \u2018the common denominator of masculine interests,\u2019 in [Esquire founding editor Arnold] Gingrich\u2019s words, their would-be readers will seek other, sometimes darker, outlets. ... One doesn\u2019t have to look hard online before stumbling across volcanic geysers of male rage and self-loathing.\u201d", "description": "RealClearInvestigations' Picks of the Week Oct. 20 to Oct. 26, 2019 \nFeatured InvestigationGiuliani-Style 'Shadow' Diplomacy: Par for the Course for U.S. Presidents\nMost media have treated...", "authors": ["October"], "top_image": "https://www.realclearpolitics.com/asset/img/rcinv-home-logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
