No longer are we at the mercy of dictators and toll trolls to grow the world economy. [...] In the long-term I believe with regard to business and economics, we are, more than ever, one world.\u201d\n\nBitcoin will end tribalism\n\nDraper also accuses those dismissing Bitcoin of clutching to tribalism, and reiterates the belief that \u201ctribalism is dying.\u201d He also compares the attempts to retain power to the roar of a falling king:\n\n\u201cTribalism is dying. And like the dying roar of the king of the jungle, we are hearing political leaders beat their chests as they try to cling to the power they once wielded when the world was still only tribal.\u201d\n\nDraper also describes the idea of a global health insurance policy \u2014 that is more effective and efficient than current offerings \u2014 \u201cwhere the premiums are in bitcoin and the claims are settled to the letter with smart contracts and monitored by artificial intelligence.\u201d\n\nHe also explains his vision of a pension that does not depend on the decision of political leaders, but instead \u201cis simply a form of fixed smart contract.\u201d Draper concludes:\n\n\u201cBitcoin brought with it a few fundamental technologies that can accelerate our transformation from a tribal planet to a global one.\u201d\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported on Sept. 30, billionaire technology investor Mark Cuban, on the other hand, said that he would be happier owning bananas rather than Bitcoin.", "description": "Combined with other technologies, Bitcoin will change how governments operate worldwide, according to billionaire investor Tim Draper", "authors": ["Adrian Zmudzinski"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvNjcyYjQ1MGJiMjQ4NjEzZDRmODlkNjBjZjM4Yjg1NTIuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
