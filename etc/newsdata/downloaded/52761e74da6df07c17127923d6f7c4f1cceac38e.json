The RBA's standard estimate of the wealth effect is that a 10% fall in housing prices leads to a 1.5% fall in household consumption over time.\n\nDebelle also noted the recent downturn has had a \"larger-than-expected\" spillover effect on inflation as rents and new dwelling purchases together account for around one-sixth of the CPI basket.\n\nIn addition, a decline in housing turnover has weighed on \"ownership transfer costs\" such as stamp duties and fees paid to real estate agents and lawyers. These costs are down more than 20% over the year to the March quarter, shaving around 0.5 percentage points of GDP.\n\n\"We had not fully taken account of this in our forecasts of GDP and it is part of the explanation of why GDP growth has turned out to be slower than we had expected,\" Debelle said.", "description": "Australia's housing downturn a larger-than-expected drag on economy", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9F20O_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
