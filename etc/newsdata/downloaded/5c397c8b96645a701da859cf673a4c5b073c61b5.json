At this event, something embarrassing may happen. Something embarrassing apparently have happened at similar events. Some similar embarrassment may occur again, so let\u2019s be extra careful.\n\nThat\u2019s what \u201canother banana skin\u201d means.\n\nA banana skin is synonymous with a small silly, funny or embarrassing mistake. This expression is undoubtedly inspired by people actually stepping onto a banana skin lying on the floor. The banana skin on the floor is, of course, slippery. One steps on it and slips up, slips up, staggers and sometimes falls.\n\nIf they are lucky and don\u2019t get hurt badly, their slip-up and fall will still make people laugh. People laugh at things like that, and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s all good natured.\n\nAnyways, people step onto a banana skin, and they stagger and fall, sometimes face first. If they do it more elegantly, they slide or glide for a distance and then they fall.\n\nElegantly or not, to step onto a banana skin indicates that one is not being careful. Being more careful, one can and at least should avoid it.\n\nSo, metaphorically, a banana skin stands for some small difficulty, such as any potentially embarrassing mistake that one should be able to avoid. Otherwise, one slips up and fall. Even if they stagger and manage to regain balance and avoid falling flat on their face, they still risk being laughed at.\n\nOkay, here are recent media examples of people tripping over a banana skin, real or figurative:\n\n\n\n1. Pep Guardiola has told his Manchester City stars they can take days off when they are retired as the Premier League champions chase success on four fronts.\n\nCity, third in the table, four points behind leaders Liverpool, travel to struggling Newcastle United on Wednesday night.\n\nAnd, with their trip to Everton rescheduled for Wednesday, February 6 because of their involvement in the Carabao Cup final, City face a congested and challenging fixture list.\n\nThe Goodison Park visit comes between home clashes with Arsenal and Chelsea and Guardiola says his players - also in the hunt for the Champions League and FA Cup - should treat the flood of games as \u2018a privilege\u2019.\n\nAsked about the possibility of his players resting, Guardiola said: \u201cWe have a lot of games, so no way.\n\n\u201cIt is what it is. But at the same time I tell them it\u2019s a privilege. If you believe it\u2019s a handicap, that\u2019s a big mistake. It\u2019s a privilege.\n\n\u201cWhen you are 35 years old you can have long holidays. No problem, you will be retired. Take a year for holidays. But for now it\u2019s a privilege. Take it, enjoy it. Next one, win again.\n\n\u201cThe competition doesn\u2019t matter. Friendly game? Win again. Play good, prepare well. That\u2019s the only way. After, you work for the next season.\u201d\n\nGuardiola, who saw his side brush aside Burnley to progress in the FA Cup at the weekend, is not taking the clash with Newcastle lightly, despite their perilous position one place above the relegation zone.\n\nThe Catalan insists the game could be a \u2018banana skin\u2019 for his side if they are not fully focused.\n\n\u201cI think no team is safe going to Newcastle,\u201d said the City manager.\n\n- \u2018Rest when you\u2019re retired\u2019 \u2013 Guardiola\u2019s warning for Man City trophy hunters, SportingNews.com, January 28, 2019.\n\n\n\n2. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer celebrated his first match as full-time Manchester United manager with a 2-1 win over Watford though he was happier to have avoided slipping up on what he termed a potential \u2018banana skin\u2019.\n\nThe 46-year-old Norwegian - who was named permanent manager on Thursday after reviving the team following the sacking of Jose Mourinho - professed himself happier with the result than the performance.\n\nVictory lifted United into fourth place and potentially a place in next season\u2019s Champions League, though, Arsenal can go back ahead of them if they beat Newcastle on Monday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy with the result if not the performance,\u201d said Solskjaer.\n\n\u201cIt was one of those first games back after the international break that you know could be a potential banana skin.\u201d\n\n- Solskjaer relieved to avoid Watford 'banana skin', AFP, March 19, 2019.\n\n\n\n3. Boris Johnson, MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip and former comedy Foreign Secretary, has launched his bid for the Conservative Party leadership by pledging to boost NHS funding by \u00a3350 million a week if he wins.\n\nJohnson, real name Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson, made the announcement in front of a large red bus emblazoned with the slogan: \u201cIt worked before. It\u2019ll work again.\u201d\n\nThe move comes in the wake of Theresa May\u2019s decision to stand down from the post by the end of June.\n\n\u201cThe NHS is an institution cherished by every British citizen, and if I am elected leader I vow to do everything in my power to ensure that it continues to thrive,\u201d he said with his fingers firmly crossed behind his back.\n\nBut surely he\u2019s made this promise before, during the EU referendum campaign?\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d he scoffed as his bow tie began to spin around, \u201cand it worked out so well last time that I\u2019d be a fool not to do it again.\u201d\n\nPausing for a moment to squirt water out of a flower on his lapel, he continued: \u201cIf there\u2019s one thing politics has taught me, it\u2019s this: the plebs will believe anything if it\u2019s written in big enough letters.\u201d\n\nBut how can he be certain that the electorate will fall for this a second time?\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve reneged on just about every promise I\u2019ve ever made since entering politics,\u201d explained Johnson, physical age 54, \u201cLike when I said I\u2019d oppose the third runway at Heathrow and then didn\u2019t even bother to turn up for the vote. And look! I\u2019m still here! Can you believe it?\u201d\n\nSo, if he wins, will there be any extra money at all for the NHS?\n\n\u201cFor the what?\u201d he asked before walking off and slipping on a banana skin.\n\n- Boris Johnson promises an extra \u00a3350m a week for the NHS if elected Tory leader (Satire), NewsThump.com, May 20, 2019.\n\n\u672c\u6587\u4ec5\u4ee3\u8868\u4f5c\u8005\u672c\u4eba\u89c2\u70b9\uff0c\u4e0e\u672c\u7f51\u7acb\u573a\u65e0\u5173\u3002\u6b22\u8fce\u5927\u5bb6\u8ba8\u8bba\u5b66\u672f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c0a\u91cd\u4ed6\u4eba\uff0c\u7981\u6b62\u4eba\u8eab\u653b\u51fb\u548c\u53d1\u5e03\u4e00\u5207\u8fdd\u53cd\u56fd\u5bb6\u73b0\u884c\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6cd5\u89c4\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u3002\n\nAbout the author:\n\nZhang Xin is Trainer at chinadaily.com.cn.
