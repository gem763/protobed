Photo: Hulton Archive/Getty Images\n\nWhether you\u2019ve been married one year or 20, it\u2019s always a good idea to mark your wedding anniversary with a gift for your spouse. But no matter how long you\u2019ve been together, it can be hard to come up with new ideas each year. To help you out, we\u2019ve combed through the most beloved products in the Strategist archive to find ones that would make great anniversary gifts for husbands, wives, or, if you\u2019re feeling very generous, a special couple in your life. If you\u2019re sticking to traditional anniversary-gift guidelines (like paper gifts for the first anniversary, cotton for the second, etc.), we\u2019ve got ideas for those, too, and will be creating specific guides for each year.\n\nBedding\n\nFrette Hotel Classic Sheet Set, Queen It might be time for a bedding upgrade if you\u2019re still sleeping on the same sheets you got from your wedding registry. Michael Shome, director of photography at Architectural Digest, calls Frette sheets \u201cthe fantasy version of Upper East Side hotel-bed linens\u201d and recommends this set for its \u201cchic and simple double-line embroidery.\u201d $425 at Saks Fifth Avenue Buy\n\nItalic Slumber Cotton Sleep Set If the Frette sheets are a little out of your budget, Strategist junior writer Chloe Anello thinks this set is a convincing dupe at a fraction of the price. After testing both, she admits, \u201cI actually slept better on the less expensive version.\u201d $115 at Italic Buy\n\nCultiver Linen Sheet Set There are lots of linen sheets out there, but we\u2019re especially impressed with the color range offered by Australian brand Cultiver. As we wrote when testing them out, \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to sell purple linen sheets and another thing entirely to sell a berry-stained color that could somehow pass as a very interesting neutral.\u201d From $365 at Cultiver Buy\n\nAiry Linen Sheet Set You might think linen sheets are scratchy, but Strategist senior editor Simone Kitchens assured us this set from Casper has \u201cthe kind of softness you really only get from a well-loved T-shirt.\u201d From $250 at Casper Buy\n\nBath\n\nWeezie Bath Towel We love the idea of hanging matching monogrammed towels in the bathroom, and these minimal ones from Weezie are a little bit playful. According to interior designer Ariel Okin, they\u2019re \u201creally soft and have a classic look to them that ties the bathroom together really nicely.\u201d Order them with your initials or your private nicknames (up to ten characters). $58 at Weezie Buy\n\nBrookstone Towel Warmer When it\u2019s cold out, throw your monogrammed towel in this warmer pre-shower to bundle up in afterward. It comes recommended by writer Michelle Markowitz, who says, \u201cPutting on a freshly warm towel straight from this towel warmer feels like receiving the best hug of your entire life, like the sensation of being wrapped up by your mother in a sunbaked towel right after climbing out of the pool.\u201d $240 at Amazon Buy $240 at Amazon Buy\n\nVivo Per Lei Body Salt Scrub Treat your partner to this skin-softening body scrub that\u2019s a favorite among Amazon reviewers.

Dublin Leather Tray A subtle hint for the spouse always looking for their keys, this catchall tray would be perfect for a nightstand or entryway. $70 at Azalea Buy\n\nUrbanStems The Paloma It may be predictable, but there\u2019s still something nice about receiving a colorful bouquet of flowers on your anniversary. We tested out six flower-delivery start-ups and named UrbanStems \u201cour absolute favorite\u201d because of its \u201creasonable prices and unique arrangements.\u201d $70 at UrbanStems Buy\n\nCalathea \u2018Medallion\u2019 Whether your spouse has a green thumb or not, they can enjoy this colorful calathea we deemed the best overall plant to give as a gift \u2014 it\u2019s impressive-looking but not too hard to keep alive. $30 at The Sill Buy\n\nMaverick 60-Inch Ceiling Fan $544 (was $649, now 16% off) It\u2019s definitely expensive, but this ceiling fan with hand-carved balsa-wood blades (which we dubbed the \u201cPrius of ceiling fans\u201d) will pay off in the long run, since it\u2019ll only set you back $5 a year in energy costs. And it\u2019s pleasant to look at. $544 at Amazon Buy $544 at Amazon Buy\n\nEddie Bauer Cabin Plaid Flannel Sherpa Throw $27 (was $30, now 10% off) Cuddle under this affordable flannel blanket to stay warm on cold days.

Alan Sytsma of Grub Street tested the two leading models for home cooks and crowned the Joule the winner because, compared with the competition, \u201cit\u2019s a lot smaller and sleeker, and the app is filled with very solid recipes and videos that show you how to do everything.\u201d $199 at Amazon Buy $199 at Amazon Buy\n\nDash Mini-Waffle-Maker Make a cozy anniversary-morning breakfast in bed with this petite waffle iron that won over Grub Street writer Nikita Richardson. \u201cNo matter how much I worried that I would overfill the iron,\u201d she says, \u201cthe Dash just kept spitting out tea-plate-size waffles that were perfectly browned and fluffy.\u201d $10 at Bed Bath & Beyond Buy\n\nStaub Cast-Iron 1.5-Quart Petite French Oven Also in the mini-kitchen-gear genre, this tiny cast-iron French oven is the \u201cperfect two-person pot,\u201d according to Strategist managing editor Maxine Builder.
