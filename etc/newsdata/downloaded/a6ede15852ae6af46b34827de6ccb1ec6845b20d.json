Bernie Sanders responded, \u201cI\u2019m healthy. I\u2019m feeling great.\u201d\n\nThe 78-year-old canceled several campaign events after undergoing surgery, releasing a video in which he said lying in a Las Vegas hospital \u201cmade me feel even more strongly the need for us to continue our efforts to end this dysfunctional and cruel health care system.\u201d\n\nTuesday Democratic debate served as a return to the campaign trail for Sanders.\n\nBut as the Vermont senator seeks to turn his heart attack into a conversation about Medicare for All, the scare has renewed questions about whether his age will affect his stamina in the race and in the White House should he win in 2020.\n\nA Huffpo/YouGov poll released Monday found that voters age 65 and older are more likely (61%) than voters age 18 to 29 (51%) to question a candidate\u2019s physical health.\n\nSanders said he\u2019s reassuring Americans about his fitness by \u201cmounting a vigorous campaign\u201d across the country and he plugged a rally in Queens he is planning on Saturday. The Vermont senator also drew cheers after he thanked his supporters and those who sent prayers and well wishes for his recovery.\n\nMore: Beto O'Rourke defends plan to confiscate assault-style weapons\n\nThe same question was put to another septuagenarian \u2013 Joe Biden, who would be 78 if elected to office.\n\n\u201cOne of the reasons I\u2019m running is because of my age and my experience \u2013 with it comes wisdom,\u201d Biden said.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/10/15/democratic-debate-bernie-sanders-reassured-voters-his-health/3993614002/", "description": "democratic-debate-bernie-sanders", "authors": ["Courtney Subramanian", "Published P.M.
