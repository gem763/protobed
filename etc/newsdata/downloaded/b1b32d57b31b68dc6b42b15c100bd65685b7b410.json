Washington Post technology columnist Geoffrey A. Fowler went on an urban expedition to demonstrate how credit card companies and their cronies sell your data.\n\nIn an exhausting tale involving two bananas, an Amazon Prime Visa card, and a hot-off-the-printer Apple Card (only available in the U.S.), Fowler pointed out six spots where your credit card use may be giving away more personal information than you might realise.\n\nThe card issuer\n\nCredit card issuers are allowed to share your data with other companies unless you specifically opt out of whatever the default is, as outlined in the card\u2019s privacy policy (more on that later).\n\nThe card network\n\nBeyond the bank that issues your card, the card networks \u2014 think Visa and Mastercard \u2014 can take your info and anonymise it to sell \u201cdata insights.\u201d \u201cVisa said it allows clients to see data on populations as small as 50 people, often tied to groups in [area] codes,\u201d Fowler wrote. That purchasing data could be used, for example, by a company that\u2019s considering opening a store in your community.\n\nThe retailer\n\nEvery time you swipe a card, a store can add your receipt\u2019s contents to your purchase history. Depending on the store, your data could be sold to, or, more ambiguously, \u201cshared with\u201d another company, Fowler pointed out.\n\nThe payment processor\n\nYou might not think much about the payment panel where you insert your card. But those payment terminals are also collecting your personal data. Some of that information can be stored as a customer profile, like on register tablets that remember where to send your receipt. These services may be compiling your purchasing history with others\u2019 as a date set meant to be shared beyond that retailer.\n\nYour mobile wallet\n\nLeft your wallet at home? That\u2019s fine, you\u2019ve got your phone. But if you don\u2019t adjust your privacy settings, your mobile wallet could be sharing your personal info. Google Pay, for instance, can use your info to let other Google companies market to you, Fowler said.\n\nYour financial apps\n\nIf you sync your spending to a budgeting app, that company may be aggregating your data with other users\u2019 and selling it to a third party. U.S. app EveryDollar, for one, says it shares aggregated, anonymised data within its parent company, The Lampo Group.\n\nHow to opt out of all that credit card data sharing\n\nAt this point, it\u2019s safe to assume that if you\u2019ve signed up for a product or service, they\u2019re sharing your data in some way. Maybe they\u2019re selling it; maybe they\u2019re using it for industry case studies. Thinking about all the ways you\u2019ve traded your privacy for convenience could make you want to skip town and hide in a bunker.\n\nBut heck, maybe you\u2019re willing to trade some of that privacy for the pleasure of making purchases more easily or getting some loyalty rewards. If you don\u2019t plan to stop using credit cards anytime soon, there are a two steps you can take to limit what personal data is shared.\n\nFirst up: credit cards are required to provide a method for opting out of data sharing. Check your card issuer\u2019s privacy policy to find out how to get off their marketing lists. You may also need to ask the card networks to stop sharing your information. Contact your bank if you're unsure.\n\nReining in your credit card data won\u2019t keep your buying habits as private as say, using cash. But it may at least reduce the amount of \u201cpersonalised\u201d offers you find in your junk mail.", "description": "If someone asked you why you use a credit card for everyday purchases like groceries, you might rattle off some combination of the convenience of paying the credit card bill later, consumer protection from potential fraud, or not having to carry cash or worry about your checking balance....", "authors": ["Chris Jager", "Sarah Basford"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/jup7ohbuh6ql3inq060m.jpg"}
