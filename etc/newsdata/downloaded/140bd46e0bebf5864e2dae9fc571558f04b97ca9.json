The MAC area is a high grade, low cost iron ore asset with a tier one operator in BHP,\u201d Mr O\u2019Leary said.\n\n\u201cThanks to the South Flank development, it has significant growth in expected cash flows. In addition, further growth in the value of MAC is possible given the potential for the development by BHP of deposits within the area covered by the royalty agreement.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIluka said it would provide an update on the review when it announces full-year results in February. It has appointed Gresham Advisory Partners, Herbert Smith Freehills and Greenwoods as advisers.\n\nThe demerger was flagged by Street Talk earlier this month when it reported L1 was making the case that the royalty could be worth $2.1 billion to $2.4 billion on a net present value basis.\n\nThe L1 view is that the royalty should trade at a modest premium to non-precious metals peers because of the size and quality of the underlying iron ore operations.\n\nThe royalty could be distributed to Iluka investors via an in-specie distribution, similar to the way Wesfarmers demerged Coles last year or when BHP Billiton spun off South32 in 2015.", "description": "Mineral sands miner considering spin off with steep increase in earnings from new BHP's South Flank mine on the horizon.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.6051%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_46%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/8d0e66945510881a526f659da3c457ecbf3e4627", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
