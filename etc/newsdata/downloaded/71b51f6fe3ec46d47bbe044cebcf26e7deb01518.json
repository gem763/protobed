And as you know, we made some very constructive and far-reaching proposals.\"\n\nThe Irish Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, said in the event of a no-deal Brexit, there would need to be checks at ports, airports and perhaps at the border.\n\nBut he said that would only be the case if the UK left without an agreement, telling the Dail: \"We've never been in the position of signing up to checks as part of a deal.\"\n\nMr Johnson told Laura Kuenssberg he always knew \"things would get choppy\" in the lead up to the Brexit deadline.\n\nBut the PM believed \"fevers would cool\" and \"tempers would come down\" once that moment had passed.\n\n\"There's no way of getting Brexit done without... displeasing people who don't want Brexit to get done,\" he said.\n\n\"[There is] no way of delivering Brexit sort of 52% Brexit and 48% Remain - that's just logically impossible.\"\n\nMr Johnson added: \"I think once we get it done, and once we can begin building a new partnership with our new friends... we can start thinking about how we can do things differently.\"\n\nAt a reception hosted by the DUP at the Conservative party conference in Manchester on Tuesday night, Mr Johnson said the UK had made progress in the negotiations, adding: \"I hope very much in the next few days we are going to get there.\"\n\nThe prime minster said that Northern Ireland should remain part of the United Kingdom \"forever\".\n\nPlease upgrade your browser Your guide to Brexit jargon Enter the word or phrase you are looking for Search\n\nThe government has made a number of policy announcements at the conference, from raising the National Living Wage over the next five years to toughening prison sentences for the worst offenders.\n\nBut the plans have been overshadowed by allegations that Mr Johnson squeezed the thigh of journalist Charlotte Edwardes under a table at a lunch in 1999.\n\nMr Johnson has repeatedly denied the incident, telling the BBC: \"It's simply not true.\"\n\nHe would not answer whether he thought Ms Edwardes - who has stood by her claims - lied or whether he remembered the lunch.\n\nAnd while the PM said such allegations should be taken seriously, he did not agree to an investigation, saying he wanted to \"get on with delivering on... [the] important issue of our domestic agenda\".", "description": "Boris Johnson says plans will go to the EU soon, but some customs checks will be needed in Ireland.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07ptdnj.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
