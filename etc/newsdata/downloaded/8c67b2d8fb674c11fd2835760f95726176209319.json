That\u2019s why I\u2019m excited to announce that what3words Chief Commercial Officer Clare Jones is joining us at TechCrunch Disrupt Berlin.\n\nThe startup has divided the world in 3 meter squares. Each square has been assigned three words. This way, it\u2019s easy to read, easy to write and even easy to say. And more importantly, it\u2019s unique.\n\nAnd sometimes, simple ideas can be incredibly powerful. For instance, if you\u2019re driving, it\u2019s much faster to say three words to define an address on your navigation system than a full address.\n\nIt\u2019s also more precise. If you\u2019re heading to a huge building, you want to arrive at the entrance of the building, not on the other side. It\u2019s incredibly frustrating when it happens \u2014 I nearly missed a train when a GPS navigation system led me to the wrong side of the tracks. This could be particularly useful for ride-hailing apps for instance, as they usually only let you enter an address.\n\nAnd then, there are countries that never had a good address system in the first place. For instance, Lonely Planet added what3words addresses to its Mongolia travel guide. It is much easier to read three words in a book and type them on your phone, instead of tapping GPS coordinates for instance.\n\nIt also opens up a lot of new markets for e-commerce companies. In some countries, customers don\u2019t have a good way to indicate where they live. An e-commerce website can add what3words support to add new delivery locations.\n\nThere are many other use cases. Emergency services, governments and humanitarian projects could also leverage what3words to improve communication and become more efficient. And I can\u2019t wait to hear Clare Jones describe how people have been using what3words.\n\nBuy your ticket to Disrupt Berlin to listen to this discussion \u2014 and many others. The conference will take place December 11-12.\n\nIn addition to panels and fireside chats, like this one, new startups will participate in the Startup Battlefield to compete for the highly coveted Battlefield Cup.", "description": "Addresses are ambiguous, not precise enough or don\u2019t even exist in some places. what3words wants to map the entire world and overhaul addresses three words at a time.
