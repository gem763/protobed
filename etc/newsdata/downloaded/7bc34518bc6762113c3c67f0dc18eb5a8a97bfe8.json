It said the technologies used to launch rockets are virtually identical to those used to test intercontinental ballistic missiles. Iran said its space efforts are peaceful.\n\n\u201cThis is simply another in a long line of illegal U.S. economic terrorism imposed on Iran in defiance of UNSC Resolution 2231, and which will have no effect on our development of peaceful space and satellite technologies,\u201d said Alireza Miryousefi, spokesman for Iran\u2019s mission to the United Nations.\n\nMissile tests don\u2019t violate the 2015 nuclear accord between Iran and other world powers, which seeks to curb Iran\u2019s nuclear program. But Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has warned Iran against conducting such tests, and the U.S. wants ballistic missiles to be part of any future deal with Tehran.\n\n\u201cThis is why Secretary Pompeo has called for a new comprehensive deal that addresses all elements of Iran\u2019s malign behavior,\u201d the State Department said.\n\nThe announced sanctions came as Mr. Pompeo met with incoming European leaders on Tuesday, during a short trip to Brussels that didn\u2019t include meetings with the departing leadership of the European Commission and Council, Jean-Claude Juncker and Donald Tusk.\n\nThe Trump administration, which withdrew from the nuclear accord last year, has tried unsuccessfully to persuade allies to toughen the agreement. European diplomats are working on a French initiative to provide Iran economic relief from U.S. sanctions in return for complete compliance with the nuclear accord.\n\nThe latest proposal would let Iran export more oil and draw on an international line of credit. If it works, Iran could sell at least 700,000 barrels of oil a day, more than double its current exports.\n\nIt couldn\u2019t be determined whether Mr. Pompeo held talks on the French proposal in Brussels on Tuesday, or on the possibility of a meeting between Mr. Trump and Iran\u2019s president, Hassan Rouhani.\n\nMr. Trump has signaled an openness to both ideas, while national security adviser John Bolton has described any prospect of sanctions relief as a non-starter in the absence of a comprehensive new deal.\n\nThe new U.S. sanctions target both the Iranian Space Agency and two of its research institutes, and are the latest in a maximum-pressure campaign to target Iran\u2019s oil, leadership, economy and security apparatus. As part of this effort, the State Department issues regular \u201cThis Week In Iran Policy\u201d fact sheets listing new sanctions, with quotes from Mr. Pompeo.\n\nFollowing Iran\u2019s failed rocket launch, Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter that the U.S. wasn\u2019t behind the accident and wished Tehran luck investigating the cause of the explosion. Commercial satellite imagery has shown pictures of smoke rising from the launch site, debris and other damage.\n\nIran didn\u2019t blame the U.S. for the accident, but tensions have escalated between the countries after a series of attacks and ship seizures in the Persian Gulf that have brought Tehran to the edge of conflict with the U.S. and its allies. The U.S. in June launched cyberattacks against Iranian government computers, officials have said.\n\nA readout of Mr. Pompeo\u2019s meeting on Tuesday with the European Parliament\u2019s newly elected president, David Sassoli of Italy, only listed the \u201ctransAtlantic security relationship\u201d as a topic for discussion. There was no specific mention of Iran.\n\nMr. Pompeo also met the European Council\u2019s president-elect, Charles Michel of Belgium, during the trip. No transcript of that meeting was available as of Tuesday.\n\nSpeaking to reporters Monday evening, the U.S. ambassador to the EU, Gordon Sondland, said Mr. Pompeo organized the meetings in Brussels in hopes of resetting the EU-U.S. relationship at a time of major differences between the two sides over a range of issues, from trade to climate change.\n\nMr. Sondland said the incoming EU officials seemed to have views which were \u201cclosely aligned\u201d with Washington\u2019s views and he hoped this would mean progress for the \u201cmultiple impasses on multiple fronts\u201d between the two sides.\n\nMr. Michel tweeted on Monday that he discussed the two sides\u2019 \u201cshared values and common interests\u201d with Mr. Pompeo. \u201cEurope and the U.S.A. both benefit from a stronger transatlantic cooperation.\u201d\n\nAfter withdrawing last year from the 2015 nuclear accord, the Trump administration presented Iran with a list of 12 demands that include a prohibition on enrichment and a wholesale change in Iran\u2019s military posture in the Middle East. The U.S. said it is not calling for regime change. Iran has said it would not meet the demands.\n\n\u2014Laurence Norman in Brussels contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Jessica Donati at jessica.donati@wsj.com and Ian Talley at ian.talley@wsj.com", "description": "The State Department imposed sanctions against Iran\u2019s space program following a failed attempt to launch a rocket last week, which the U.S. suspects was an effort to advance its ballistic missile program.", "authors": ["Jessica Donati", "Ian Talley", "Jessica.Donati Wsj.Com", "Ian.Talley Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-102999/social"}
