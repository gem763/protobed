Another with hundreds aboard was on its way, National Voice of the Bahamas radio reported, citing a spokesman for the country\u2019s National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA).\n\nApproximately 200 people were also evacuated from Abaco Friday on Bahamasair flights, according to a NEMA spokesperson who declined to be named.\n\n\u201cFree air evacuations on Bahamasair from Abaco started (Thursday) and will continue until all Grand Bahama and Abaco residents who want to leave are off the islands,\u201d Prime Minister Hubert Minnis said in a tweet.\n\nFour survivors told Reuters on Thursday they had been charged $75 for a seat on a Bahamasair flight from Abaco to Nassau. \u201cI thought a relief flight would be free,\u201d said Anthony Thompson, 27, who said he paid the fare for himself, his wife and his sister. \u201cI thought wrong.\u201d\n\nA Bahamasair official, who requested anonymity, told Reuters the airline was collecting its customers whose flights had been canceled during the hurricane. To the extent extra seats were available, it was offering to ferry others off Abaco \u201cat cost,\u201d the official said.\n\nA man walks among debris at the Mudd neighborhood, devastated after Hurricane Dorian hit the Abaco Islands in Marsh Harbour, Bahamas, September 6, 2019. REUTERS/Marco Bello\n\n\u2018STAGGERING\u2019 DEATH TOLL\n\nBahamas Health Minister Duane Sands said there had been \u201ca tremendous loss of life\u201d in Abaco\u2019s main city of Marsh Harbor.\n\nThe medical chief of staff at Princess Margaret Hospital in Nassau said two refrigerated, 40-foot trucks would be needed to hold the bodies that were expected to be found. \u201cWe\u2019ve ordered lots of body bags,\u201d said Dr. Caroline Burnett-Garraway.\n\nThose injured by the storm, which at one point was a Category 5 hurricane on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale of intensity, were treated for fractures, head injuries, lacerations, skin rashes and dehydration.\n\nNear an area called The Mudd in Marsh Harbour, the commercial hub, a Reuters witness described a devastating scene, with most houses leveled, a man lying dead near a main street and dead dogs in water. Some residents were leaving the area with meager possessions, while others were determined to remain.\n\nThe U.S. Coast Guard, working with NEMA, has rescued 295 people since Dorian began, the U.S. embassy in Nassau tweeted.\n\nRelief groups are focusing on getting doctors, nurses and medical supplies into the hardest-hit areas and helping survivors get food and safe drinking water.\n\nBritish ship RFA Mounts Bay distributed shelter material, water and hygiene kits in Marsh Harbour, the UK Department for International Development said on Friday. A former British colony, the Bahamas is an independent country that remains part of the British Commonwealth.\n\nThe risk of outbreaks of diarrhea and waterborne diseases is high because drinking water may be contaminated with sewage, according to the Pan American Health Organization, which described the situation for some people on Abaco as \u201cdesperate.\u201d\n\nThe United Nations estimated 70,000 people were in immediate need of food, water and shelter on the islands. The U.N. World Food Programme is airlifting storage units, generators, prefab offices, and satellite equipment as well as 8 metric tonnes of ready-to-eat meals.\n\nWIDESPREAD LOOTING\n\nA Reuters witness saw widespread looting on Abaco, with people breaking into supermarkets and liquor stores.\n\nSlideshow (12 Images)\n\nWendy Hawkes, whose home on Abaco was largely destroyed, described seeing neighbors standing outside their front doors with shotguns to ward off looters.\n\nThe relief effort faces formidable logistical challenges because of the widespread destruction caused by Dorian, which hovered over the Bahamas for nearly two days with torrential rains and fierce winds that whipped up 12- to 18-foot (3.7- to 5.5-meter) storm surges.\n\nDorian briefly made landfall on the Outer Banks of North Carolina on Friday with winds of 90 miles per hour (150 kph). It was heading toward Canada where it was expected to bring hurricane-force winds to parts of Nova Scotia by Saturday evening, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said.", "description": "Hundreds of people fled the Bahamas island of Great Abaco by boat on Friday and thousands more tried to get on a cruise ship leaving neighboring Grand Bahama to escape the catastrophic aftermath of Hurricane Dorian.", "authors": ["Nick Brown", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190906&t=2&i=1427061192&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF851IC", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
