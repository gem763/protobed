Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign chairman earned millions of dollars advising Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych before he was ousted by protests in 2014. A black ledger detailing Ukrainian government payments to Manafort surfaced in August 2016, leading to Manafort\u2019s resignation from the campaign and then contributing to the criminal case that sent him away for seven years for tax and bank fraud.\n\nIn the years before Yanukovych\u2019s ouster, as Manafort delivered commanding political success to his Ukrainian client, others were studying his work. Although Ukraine is poorer than its neighbor, Russia, it has enough cash to fuel a heady life for those who want to join its political trench fighting.\n\n\u201cIn Ukraine, many people have quite a lot of money, many people have a bad reputation and want to improve it, and many people want to improve their connection with the West,\u201d said Anders Aslund, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council. \u201cUkraine is much more open than Russia, that is the quality, and if you\u2019re open, you get more U.S. criminals coming in, also.\u201d\n\nUkrainian leaders feel trapped between warring Washington factions\n\nAnalysts and policymakers say Ukraine draws attention because it has an unusual blend of cash \u2014 it\u2019s a key transit country for Russian natural gas \u2014 corruption and competitive elections. Americans such as Manafort and Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, have found ready clients in Ukraine, where people believe that U.S. political wisdom can get results.\n\n\u201cIn Ukraine politics is dirty, but still competitive,\u201d said Andrew Wilson, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cSo you have all sides arming themselves with these techniques.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a contrast with Russia, which has far deeper stores of money but where politics has been dominated for two decades by one man: President Vladi\u00admir Putin. The Russian market largely closed to Americans after 2014, when the Obama administration imposed sanctions on Russia for its role in the conflict in Ukraine and business ties dried up.\n\nIn Ukraine, Manafort is deeply tied in the public mind to the corruption of the Yanukovych era. When the black ledger of payments surfaced in 2016, diplomats in Kiev figured the disclosure was motivated by Ukrainian anger about his work in their political system. Trump was unpopular in Kiev because of his admiration for Putin, but few believed it was part of a broader Ukrainian vendetta against the Trump campaign, because no one at the time expected it to be victorious.\n\nBut in Trump-era Washington, the president\u2019s backers have portrayed the episode differently, as part of a Ukrainian government conspiracy to meddle in the 2016 campaign.\n\nTrump suggests he mentioned Biden in phone call with Ukrainian president\n\nGiuliani, whose consulting group counts among its clients several prominent Ukranians, has targeted the former lawmaker Serhiy Leshchenko, who helped publicize the ledger. In a May appearance on Fox News, Giuliani named Leshchenko as one of a group of \u201cenemies of the president, in some cases enemies of the United States,\u201d who were close to newly elected Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nLeshchenko says his actions have been put through a funhouse mirror.\n\n\u201cInstead of applauding me because I have put in jail a criminal, Mr. Manafort, who is found guilty by American judges and American grand juries, they have started attacking me,\u201d he said.\n\nLeshchenko advised Zelensky\u2019s campaign. But he said Giuliani\u2019s vendetta had forced him to leave the new leader\u2019s team to avoid harming relations between Ukraine and the United States.\n\nIn an op-ed published Saturday by The Post, he offered to testify before Congress.\n\nBut if the end of the Yanukovych era cast out American consultants including Manafort, the turmoil pulled in others with Washington connections. One energy company, Burisma, hired several well-connected Democrats, including Hunter Biden, Joe Biden\u2019s son, who became a board member in 2014.\n\nAt the time, his father was vice president, and a leader in the Obama administration\u2019s response to the crisis in the country.\n\nThe younger Biden didn\u2019t provide direct support to politicians. He earned up to $50,000 per month for his work on the energy company\u2019s board, the New York Times has reported, which made some State Department officials uneasy about the potential for an appearance of conflict of interest, former officials said.\n\nJoe Biden has said he never spoke to his son about the Burisma work.\n\nFact-checking President Trump\u2019s wild jabs at Joe Biden\n\nUkrainian prosecutors launched investigations in 2014 into alleged illegal activities at Burisma including money-laundering and abuse of office by company owner Mychola Zlochevsky. Zlochevsky and Burisma denied the allegations. One of the probes, for income tax evasion, was settled with a fine. The others never did not result in convictions.\n\nUkrainian prosecutors have said there is no evidence of improper behavior by Hunter Biden.\n\nStill, Trump and Giuliani have sought to propel Hunter Biden\u2019s Ukrainian business dealings into the public sphere.\n\nThe Post has reported that an intelligence official filed a whistleblower complaint centering on a July 25 phone conversation between Trump and Zelensky in which Trump asked for an investigation into Hunter Biden.\n\nTrump on Sunday acknowledged raising the Bidens with Zelensky.\n\n\u201cThe conversation I had was largely congratulatory, was largely corruption, all of the corruption taking place, was largely the fact that we don\u2019t want our people, like Vice President Biden and his son, creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine,\u201d Trump told reporters.\n\nHunter Biden is no longer is on the Burisma payroll. In the Trump era, a different cast of characters is winning contracts in Ukraine.\n\nOne of them? Giuliani. His clients include Kharkiv Mayor Gennady Kernes, once an ally of Yanukovych.\n\nSchiff says impeachment may be necessary\n\nHow Trump and Giuliani pressured Ukraine to investigate the president\u2019s rivals\n\nTrump\u2019s Ukraine call reveals a president convinced of his own invincibility\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "For the second time since 2016, Kiev could shape the course of U.S. political fortunes.", "authors": ["Michael Birnbaum", "Brussels Bureau Chief Covering Europe", "David L.
