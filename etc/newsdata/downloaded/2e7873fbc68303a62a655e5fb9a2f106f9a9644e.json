I observe a moment of stillness to realign and take stock of the year's goals, then get a surge of motivating, creative energy to lock in and put those points on the board. Now is the time to kick things into high gear.\n\nThis week's Heat Check playlist additions are from all across the culture map \u2014 from hip-hop to pop to Jersey club \u2014 to carry the essence of that hustle movement. Think of these picks as audible versions of a contemplative stillness followed by a swift kick in the ass you know you need. (I kick because I care. Promise.)\n\nListen to this playlist via Spotify.\n\n3ohBlack, \"All Talk\"\n\nSometimes, the peanut gallery not only needs to be called out, but dragged, dropped and utterly upheaved. You don't need that type of negative energy in your life.\n\nYouTube\n\nLunchMoney Lewis, \"Make That Cake (feat. Doja Cat)\"\n\nDoja's verses gets more sticky, stylish and hilariously didactic by the bar: \"Mars native, Margiela, muh-f**** / Mark my words, hit a million like Mark Zucka.\"\n\nYouTube\n\nFlo Milli, \"Beef FloMix\"\n\nLord, grant me the brazen confidence of Mobile, Ala.'s Flo Milli and her straightforward elegy to haters: \"If you think I'm stealin swag, bitch, come sue me / They watch me like I'm a new movie.\"\n\nYouTube\n\nIDK, \"24\"\n\nHard keys, a heart-pumping cadence and a barrage of metaphors all packed in under three minutes. Over and out!\n\nYouTube\n\nPusha T, \"Coming Home (feat. Ms. Lauryn Hill)\"\n\nWith an uplifting chorus from the one and only Ms. Lauryn Hill, Push prioritizes the small triumphs and culture keepers: \"I do it for my big Benz drivers / For my street-corner survivors / For my n***** that miss The Wire / And throwback mommies, that won't retire.\"\n\nYouTube\n\nUNIIQU3, \"Breakin' Necks\"\n\nUNIIQU3 literally doesn't have a moment or a BPM to spare to give in this Jersey club bass-burner.\n\nYouTube\n\nYung Baby Tate, \"Hallelujah\"\n\nAfter getting some well-deserved recognition from Nicki Minaj, Atlanta's Yung Baby Tate isn't slowing down her momentum for anybody.\n\nYouTube\n\nRapsody, \"Serena\"\n\nNot all heroes wear capes. In Rapsody's case, the uniform she dons consists of clean straightback cornrows, glossed lips, gold-dipped doorknockers \u2014 not to mention an edifying message second to none!\n\nYouTube\n\nKano, \"Can't Hold We Down (feat. Popcaan)\"\n\nDon't forget your crew with you on the way to the top: \"Them know dem can't violate, cah mi have some way a sing like violin / I'm so goddamn blessed, every day of me life, I keep smiling.\"", "description": "This week's motivating playlist additions from all across the culture map \u2014 from hip-hop to pop to Jersey club \u2014 carry the essence of the hustle.
