Thomas fell just short of the first triple-double in Finals history.\n\nJonquel Jones had 18 points and 13 rebounds to lead the Sun.\n\nConnecticut blew a 16-point halftime lead as Washington used a huge third quarter to tie the game at 68. The Mystics kept it going to start the fourth, opening up a five-point lead. With its season on the line, the Sun responded.\n\nJasmine Thomas hit a 3-pointer to put the Sun ahead 84-81. The lead was short-lived as Emma Meesseman answered with a 3 from the wing to tie the game again.\n\nShekinna Stricklen, the league\u2019s 3-point champion at the All-Star Game, then shook off a defender before making another 3 to give the Sun an 87-84 advantage with 2:22 left. Natasha Cloud made a layup a few seconds later to get the Mystics within one.\n\nThat\u2019s as close as they got as both teams missed open looks in the final 2 minutes. Aerial Powers, who led Washington with 15 points, missed an open 3-pointer in the corner with 27.5 seconds left that would have given Washington the lead.\n\nConnecticut Sun guard Jasmine Thomas celebrates a basket against the Washington Mystics during the first quarter of Game 4.

The league MVP had 11 points and five rebounds while playing 30 minutes.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nGame 5 is Thursday night in Washington.", "description": "The Connecticut Sun held off the Washington Mystics' big second-half charge to force a winner-take-all Game 5 in the WNBA Finals.", "authors": ["Associated Press", "Published P.M.
