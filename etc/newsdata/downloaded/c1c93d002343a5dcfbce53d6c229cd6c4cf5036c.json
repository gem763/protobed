Most torches have multiple adjustable beam modes, and higher beams will emit more light but drain your battery faster. Some also have a red light mode, which illuminates while preserving your night vision.\n\nThere\u2019s a torch to suit every job and situation. If you\u2019re taking yours outdoors, pick one that is waterproof or water resistant, and that has a good battery life of at least 10 hours on high beam. Torches that can be recharged with a USB cable are also handy, and save on the cost of batteries in the long run. Size matters \u2013 pocket torches should be slim and lightweight, and if you\u2019re shopping for a bigger torch for working outdoors, look for gripable tactile handle or a torch that doubles up as freestanding light so you can work hands-free.\n\nTorches come at massively varied price points. If you just want a torch to keep handy, a \u00a320 functional model will be fine. For powerful work lights, look for something around \u00a350, or splash out on a Maglite, which are the best of the best.\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews.
