In other words, there are more than a few viewers would could barely contain themselves over how unexpectedly hot he was.\n\nIn one sketch, Harbour plays a SoulCycle teacher instructor named Deacon who \"has an addiction, to pushing myself. And cocaine.\" And fans seem to have an addiction to his biceps.\n\nRocking his long hair in a tied-back man bun and flaunting his arms in a sleeveless top, Harbour sent some fans into a tailspin.\n\nSeriously, there was no end to the excitement, and a few fans got a bit NSFW with their love (and desire) for the actor.\n\nI know this soul cycle skit isn\u2019t supposed to be arousing but..... david harbour\u2019s arms.....
