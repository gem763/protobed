They may find out that the homes they\u2019ve lived in for decades need thousands of dollars in updates and renovations to attract buyers.\n\nRealtor Lisa Bailey-Harper at LBH Group in Northern Virginia says young home buyers with heavy student loan debt have no interest in paying, say, $500,000 for a home and then having to renovate it themselves. They want one that\u2019s move-in ready.\n\n\u201cThey may buy a new refrigerator or stove and not update anything else.\u201d Bailey-Harper says. Today\u2019s choosy purchasers want to see updated kitchens and bathrooms, she notes. Yet prospective sellers often haven\u2019t altered those rooms in years. Or they have old, dated fixtures and mismatched appliances.\n\nTwo choices for hopeful home sellers\n\nThe choice is simple, says Mitchell Katz, a financial planner and founder at Capital Associates Wealth Management in Bethesda, Md. Either make the updates or be prepared for lowball offers.\n\nAlso read: A recession is coming: How to protect your retirement\n\nMost retirees tend to stay in their family homes, but boomers are America\u2019s largest generation and have an outsize impact on some trends. According to a Brookings Institution analysis of census data, boomers who did retire and wanted to move often faced a difficulty selling their homes.\n\nJeff Corliss, director, client services at RDM Financial Group at HighTower in Westport, Conn. offers this advice: Plan ahead.\n\n\u201cWhat we tend to tell people, especially as they are approaching retirement, is try to budget a little bit each year for maintenance. It can be a huge expense if you haven\u2019t done anything in years,\u201d says Corliss.\n\nCorliss and Bailey-Harper note that a new coat of interior paint around the house will help immensely. Says Bailey-Harper: \u201cPaint goes a long way.\u201d\n\nAlso, Corliss suggests, try to think about what millennial shoppers want. \u201cThey are really into stainless-steel appliances,\u201d he notes, adding, \u201cTry doing things like swapping outdated lights with LED ones or getting a smart thermostat. Think of things that buyers may notice.\u201d\n\nHome improvements you may need to consider\n\nIf your house is small or old, you may need to put in serious money to add a bathroom. \u201cSometimes older people have one bathroom,\u201d says Dara Luber, senior manager, retirement at TD Ameritrade. \u201cYou need to have at least 2\u00bd.\u201d\n\nThe key to affording those kinds of updates is to put them into your budget and your financial plan. \u201cIt\u2019s like planning for anything,\u201d says Katz. \u201cYou have to do it.\u201d\n\nLuber recommends talking with a real-estate agent five years or so before you expect to sell. That will give you a professional\u2019s view of what your home needs to sell. \u201cPlan well ahead, and you are likely to have more time and leeway,\u201d she says.\n\nRead: These features could boost your home\u2019s sale price by over 30%\n\nRetiring homeowners who are short on cash might consider applying for a line of credit or a home equity line. \u201cThey may have to tap into that and use funds to put a roof on,\u201d Corliss says.\n\nTry to make sure any improvements will provide a return on your investment. \u201cIt\u2019s a trade-off, like a lot of things in life,\u201d Corliss says. \u201cHow much do I want to put into this if the return isn\u2019t there?\u201d\n\nOne more tip: Clean up the clutter. \u201cThe older people get, the more they collect things,\u201d says Bailey-Harper. \u201cBefore you know it, they have a house full of stuff.\u201d", "description": "If you\u2019re looking to downsize when you retire, a few fixes can boost your chances of hooking a buyer", "authors": ["Rodney Brooks"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS129_na_sel_ZG_20190926103445.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
