It\u2019s a new experience for us, it\u2019s a moment for us to be mature.\n\n\u2018Of course it feels better tonight, it\u2019s an important result for our confidence and three points in the table. It was very important tonight. Now it will take time to rediscover our best feelings.\u2019\n\nPochettino also confirmed he will reward his players for last night\u2019s win with an impromptu day off today.\n\nSon Heung-min (right) scored a first-half brace in the 5-0 win over Red Star Belgrade\n\nDele Alli (right) hugs the South Korean as Tanguy Ndombele (left) joins the pair to celebrate\n\nThe squad were not scheduled a day off until the end of the month, while Sportsmail reported last week how a number of Tottenham's internationals have had just one day off since September 15.\n\nBut Pochettino said: \u2018I said to the players, tomorrow\u2019s a day off. I asked you want a day off; OK, day off tomorrow!\u2019\n\nMeanwhile, captain Harry Kane, who scored a brace, praised his team\u2019s strength of character as they put their troubled season behind them.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s great, it is exactly what we needed to do. We know it has been a tough run of results and it was a perfect way to respond, hopefully we can build on this,\u2019 he said.\n\nHarry Kane praised Spurs' strength of character as they put their troubled season behind them\n\n\u2018We said we wanted to come out the blocks, play high, forward runs and when you score early it gives you momentum to carry on. Delighted for the clean sheet as well.\n\n\u2018We know we have a long way to go but hopefully we can build on this, it is down to us to put in a performance like we did tonight (against Liverpool\u2019 on Sunday.\u2019\n\nMeanwhile, UEFA were awaiting the reports from last night\u2019s game after around 150 Red Star fans were sat together at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium despite their UEFA ban for racist behaviour earlier in the competition.\n\nThe Serbians have not allowed to sell tickets to their fans as a punishment for racist chanting, during a July qualifying fixture against HJK Helsinki in Finland.\n\nErik Lamela (left) also got in on the act as Tottenham got their first win in Europe this season\n\nSpurs were therefore unable to put tickets on general sale for fear of them being bought by Red Star supporters.\n\nAnd a Tottenham spokesman: \u2018Red Star supporters illegally obtained individual tickets on Level 5 and made their way around to one section of the stadium in order to congregate as a group.\n\n\u2018Stewards and police contained the group as it was too large a number to eject. We have launched a full investigation in order to understand how tickets have been acquired. We shall take the strongest possible action against any individual found to have sold their ticket on.\u2019", "description": "SAMI MOKBEL AT THE TOTTENHAM HOTSPUR STADIUM: Pochettino ordered his players not to relent in the quest to rebuild their shattered confidence following thier 5-0 victory over Red Star.", "authors": ["Sami Mokbel For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/00/20060278-0-image-a-16_1571785650597.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
