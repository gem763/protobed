And that's the exciting thing, because we changed the origin of Venom\n\nIconic pairing: Venom director Ruben Fleischer CONFIRMED on Monday that the villain and Spider-Man will go head-to-head in a future film\n\n'In the comics, he evolved from Spider-Man but because of the Marvel-Sony thing we weren't able to that.\n\n'And so the thing I think it's building towards, and will be exciting to see, is when they actually do confront each other.'\n\nIn September it was announced that Marvel would make a third Spider-Man solo film to be released in 2021, and the character would also appear in another Marvel film.\n\nMeanwhile, a second Venom film is set for release in 2020 with lead stars Tom Hardy, Woody Harrelson and Michelle Williams to return, and Andy Serkis to direct.\n\nLooking forward to it: The filmmaker explained: 'The thing I think it's building towards, and will be exciting to see, is when they actually do confront each other'\n\nIn the comics, the Symbiote's first human host is in fact Spider-Man but the creature is cast out by the superhero after discovering its true, twisted nature.\n\nIt was then that the sentient alien went on to merge with a number of other hosts including Eddie Brock, Hardy's character in the Sony film.\n\nThe character was last seen going up against Spider-Man in the third film of Sam Raimi's original trilogy starring Tobey Maguire.\n\nFor a time, it looked like Spider-Man was unlikely to return to the MCU after Sony claimed in September that the 'door is closed' on them making a deal with Disney.\n\nAttempt: Venom was last seen going up against Spider-Man in the poorly-received third film of Sam Raimi's original trilogy starring Tobey Maguire\n\nHowever it's thanks to Tom that the two companies were able to come to an agreement, as The Hollywood Reporter claimed he used his role as Nathan Drake in Sony's new Uncharted film as leverage to persuade the pair to strike a bargain.\n\nAccording to the publication's sources, the actor made several appeals to Disney chairman and CEO Bob Iger and Sony film chairman Tom Rothman to make a deal.\n\nAnd in September it was announced that Marvel would make a third Spider-Man solo film, and the character would also appear in another Marvel film.\n\nIt was also revealed that Disney will earn 25 per cent of net gross on the hero's solo film in return for paying into 25 per cent of its budget.\n\nHe's back in: In September it was announced that Marvel would make a third Spider-Man solo film to be released in 2021, and the character would also appear in another Marvel film\n\nIn celebration Tom posted an Instagram clip of Leonardo DiCaprio in The Wolf Of Wall Street saying: 'You know what? I'm not leaving. I'm not leaving. I'm not f***ing leaving!'\n\nIt emerged in August that Disney and Sony were at loggerheads over financing and that if the issue was not resolved, the MCU would lose Spider-Man.\n\nThe rapprochement the studios arrived at stipulates that Disney will rake in a fourth of the profits, Variety sources claim.\n\nIn the original deal, Disney got 5% of first-dollar gross. The feud over the summer allegedly sprang from Sony's desire to stick to this arrangement, while Disney wanted to evenly split the financing.", "description": "The filmmaker, 44, informed Fandom on Monday that making the 2018 blockbuster was always 'going to lead' to the pair clashing, to reflect its comic book origins.", "authors": ["Roxy Simons For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/14/19741792-0-image-a-49_1571145429880.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
