Matt Gaetz, Al Sharpton clash over anti-Semitism accusations as police brutality hearing goes off rails", "language": "en", "text": "A House Judiciary Committee hearing on law enforcement on Thursday morphed into a heated confrontation between GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz and MSNBC's Al Sharpton when the Florida lawmaker challenged the activist and weekend host over past inflammatory comments.\n\nAt the hearing on policing practices, Gaetz cited a 2000 resolution from former congressman and fellow MSNBC host Joe Scarborough condemning Sharpton as racist and anti-Semitic before rattling off a laundry list of past quotes from Sharpton and asking whether they were accurate.\n\n\u201cHave you ever referred to members of the Jewish faith as white interlopers or diamond merchants?\u201d Gaetz asked.\n\nTRUMP SLAMS AL SHARPTON, A ONETIME PAL WITH AN INFLAMMATORY PAST\n\nAfter a few moments of the two speaking over each other, Gaetz continued, \u201cHave you ever referred to African-Americans who disagree with you as cocktail-sip Negroes?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have,\u201d Sharpton said.\n\nThe congressman later asked Sharpton, \u201cHave you ever said, \u2018If the Jews want to get it on, they can pin their yarmulkes back and come over to my house?\u201d\n\nREP. MATT GAETZ: TRUMP CRACKDOWN ON ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION SUCCEEDING \u2014 AMERICA BENEFITS\n\nSharpton said that comment was directed at one specific individual who threatened him in 1991, not all Jews.\n\nAs the testy exchange continued, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., struggled to keep the hearing moving. With Gaetz and Sharpton clashing, Democratic members asked whether Nadler could shut down Gaetz\u2019s off-topic line of questioning.\n\nNadler called Gaetz\u2019s questioning \u201cobnoxious\u201d but told committee Dems that the hard-charging congressman had significant latitude under the rules.\n\nGaetz objected to Nadler\u2019s use of the word \u201cobnoxious\u201d before defending his line of questioning as relevant to the hearing.\n\n\u201cReverend Sharpton has come before the House Judiciary Committee as a purported expert on policing,\u201d Gaetz said. \u201cYet his bigoted statements undermine the bipartisan work we should be doing to ensure that all citizens are able to come together and have safe communities.\u201d\n\nREP. MATT GAETZ CHALLENGES PRO-GUN LAWMAKERS TO GIVE UP SECURITY DETAILS\n\nThe congressman made clear he thought Sharpton\u2019s past comments disqualified him from commenting on racism and policing.\n\n\u201cWhen you call Greek h---s, when you talk about white crackers, these are bigoted statements,\u201d Gaetz said.\n\nDemocratic members, including Rep. Hank Johnson, D-Ga., condemned Gaetz\u2019s behavior, saying that it was off-topic and damaging to the credibility of the House Judiciary Committee.\n\n\"This is taking our process down to a level that we should never allow it to descend to,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI\u2019m objecting to us wallowing in the mud with these comments.\u201d\n\nAfter Gaetz\u2019s time expired, Sharpton launched one last tongue-in-cheek barb at the congressman before answering further questions.\n\n\u201cI thank the gentleman from Florida for letting me straighten out the distortion and lies on the record that I\u2019ve been misquoted,\u201d Sharpton said. \u201cHe\u2019s done a great service for my reputation.\u201d\n\nThe tense tone for the hearing was set during witness opening statements, when the president of the Center for Policing Equity, Dr. Phillip Adiba Goff, skipped part of his prepared statement to go after the testimony of the Manhattan Institute\u2019s Heather Mac Donald, who spoke immediately before him.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nShe cited a poll saying black Americans favored \u201cbroken windows policing\u201d and cited research that black Americans are eight times more likely to commit homicide than whites and Hispanics combined. She also referenced a study that said black civilians were shot by police less often compared with whites than their rates of violent crime would predict.\n\n\u201cMy love of country and my respect for this body, and mostly my vocation as a scientist will not allow me to move to my prepared remarks just yet,\u201d Goff said in response. \u201cI feel I must at least correct the record.\u201d\n\nThe hearing also included testimony from other activists, including former tennis professional James Blake \u2013 who has advocated against police brutality after his 2015 arrest by a New York City Police Department officer who mistook him for a suspect in a credit card fraud case \u2013 and Gwen Carr, the mother of Eric Garner, who died in 2014 after an encounter with the NYPD.\n\nFraternal Order of Police President Patrick Yoes and National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Professionals executive board member Gina Hawkins testified as well.", "description": "A House Judiciary Committee hearing on law enforcement Thursday descended into a heated confrontation\u00a0between GOP Rep.
