I've known him for 17 years,\" she said. \"He's decent, he's kind, he's good. I know his heart. This is not consistent with Brett.\"\n\nNYT UPDATES KAVANAUGH 'BOMBSHELL' TO NOTE ACCUSER DOESN'T RECALL ALLEGED ASSAULT\n\nNYT REPORTERS BEHIND KAVANAUGH STORY SUGGEST KEY INFO WAS REMOVED BY EDITORS\n\nKavanaugh was responding to accusations from California professor Christine Blasey Ford that he covered her mouth and tried to remove her clothing at a party in the early 1980s when they both were in high school.\n\nDespite the accusations, Ashley reiterated her faith in her husband.\n\n\"I know Brett. I know who he is,\" she said. \"I don\u2019t know what happened to [Ford] and I don't even want to go there. I feel badly for her family. I feel badly for her through this process. This process is not right.\"\n\n'PART OF WHAT MOTIVATED' CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD WAS TO PUT POLITICAL 'ASTERISK' ON KAVANAUGH, LAWYER ADMITS\n\nThe 2018 interview came back into the spotlight this week, after a piece written by Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly of the New York Times alleged that there was corroboration of an incident in which Kavanaugh, as a college student at Yale, exposed himself to a female classmate at a party, based on an excerpt from their forthcoming book, \"The Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation.\"\n\nThe paper was forced to issue an update that included the significant detail that several friends of the alleged victim said she did not recall the purported sexual assault. The newspaper also stated for the first time that the alleged victim refused to be interviewed, and has made no other comment about the episode.\n\nTRUMP RIPS NEW YORK TIMES OVER KAVANAUGH PIECE, CALLS FOR RESIGNATION OF ANYONE INVOLVED IN 'SMEAR STORY'\n\nDiscussing her family's reaction to the initial allegations, Ashley Kavanaugh said the hardest part was explaining the truth to her children.\n\n\"It\u2019s very difficult to have these conversations with your children, which we\u2019ve had to have,\u201d she said. \u201cBut they know Brett and they know the truth and we told them at the very beginning of this process, \u2018This will be not fun sometimes. You\u2019re going to hear things. People feel strongly and you need to know that and just remember, you know your dad.\u2019\u201d\n\nAfter a long and tumultuous confirmation process, including an FBI investigation into the allegations -- which found no evidence corroborating the claims, Kavanaugh was confirmed to the Supreme Court by a Senate vote of 50-48.\n\nFor the full interview featuring the Supreme Court justice and his wife in a rare moment in front of the camera, join Fox Nation and watch the exclusive \"Brett Kavanaugh Interview\" today.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR A FOX NATION FREE TRIAL\n\nFox Nation programs are viewable on-demand and from your mobile device app, but only available only for Fox Nation subscribers.
