Chinese officials have come to Washington this week eager to settle on a narrow deal that would involve tariff reductions in exchange for a resumption of Chinese purchases of American food. They appear unlikely to agree to the administration\u2019s longstanding demands that Beijing limit its subsidies to Chinese firms, change its policies surrounding the treatment of data or make other structural changes, people familiar with the negotiations said.\n\nThe potential for such a limited agreement has fueled private deliberations within the White House on options for escalating economic pressure on China.\n\nOfficials have held meetings in recent weeks to consider escalation options if the current round of negotiations fails to address the administration\u2019s primary concerns. Mr. Trump\u2019s top economic advisers have publicly played down the discussions, which have centered on tightening scrutiny of Chinese companies listed on American stock exchanges and limiting the direct exposure of government-run retirement funds to China.\n\nLarry Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council, acknowledged on Tuesday that the administration was looking for ways to protect Americans who were investing in Chinese companies.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve opened up a study group to take a look at it,\u201d Mr. Kudlow said on the Fox Business Network.\n\nBut the options under consideration go further than that. According to a memo circulated within the White House and reviewed by The New York Times, the administration is studying a menu of actions that, if carried out, would most likely rattle the Chinese government.\n\nThe memo was drafted by Michael Pillsbury, a China scholar at the Hudson Institute and an outside adviser to the White House. It proposes holding Chinese companies and their employees criminally liable for financial disclosure violations, broadening the criteria that could get prominent Chinese companies blacklisted in the United States and blocking public and private pension funds and university endowments from certain Chinese investments.\n\nOther options go beyond financial scrutiny of Chinese companies. The memo describes the possibility of fostering deeper ties between the United States and Taiwan and disrupting the flow of capital between Hong Kong and mainland China if it is determined that Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy is not being respected.", "description": "As trade talks resume on Thursday, with a short-term deal potentially within reach, the White House has been exploring ways to pressure Beijing beyond tariffs to address the administration\u2019s longstanding concerns.", "authors": ["Alan Rappeport", "Ana Swanson"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/09/business/09DC-ESCALATE-01/merlin_159733326_365ee0f3-4455-4e35-ac0d-5d771ddbe5bc-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
