(AP/LM Otero)\n\nDallas Mavericks star and NBA Rookie of the Year Luka Doncic appears to be pulling for Dallas Wings rookie Arike Ogunbowale to win the same award this summer.\n\nAnother team in the league, though, isn\u2019t buying his support.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nDoncic appeared in a video on the Wings\u2019 Twitter account on Wednesday, wishing Ogunbowale luck in her own Rookie of the Year bid while holding up her jersey in the Mavericks\u2019 weight room.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up Arike. I know you\u2019re having a great season, so just keep pushing,\u201d Doncic said. \u201cI know you\u2019re going to be the Rookie of the Year, so the best of luck to you.\u201d\n\nOgunbowale has had a tremendous season this summer, averaging 18.1 points and three assists per game in Dallas. The former Notre Dame star\u2019s 18.1 points per game is third best in the league in general, too, behind only Brittney Griner and Elena Delle Donne.\n\nWithout a doubt, she\u2019s made a strong case to take home the coveted award.\n\nJust a few hours later, though, the Minnesota Lynx called Doncic out.\n\nStory continues\n\n***says a guy who hasn\u2019t been to a @WNBA game all season but got sent a jersey and recorded a scripted video*** https://t.co/WaSSuOnQsV \u2014 Minnesota Lynx (@minnesotalynx) September 4, 2019\n\nThe Lynx didn\u2019t provide any proof with their claim that Doncic hasn\u2019t been to a Wings game, though that issue has been present in Dallas in recent years. Wings star Skylar Diggins-Smith even called out Mavericks owner Mark Cuban last year for never having attended one of their games.\n\nAnd, for what it\u2019s worth, the Wings replied to their tweet calling that claim \u201cfalse.\u201d\n\nDallas sportswriter Brice Paterik was one of many who responded to the Lynx\u2019s tweet, calling it a bad look.\n\nMinnesota, though, didn\u2019t care.\n\nNo trashing. Just facts.\n\n\n\nWe have plenty of NBA players (and coaches) at our games, bruh... https://t.co/rGeueIbX5v pic.twitter.com/VWCOsPQS4y \u2014 Minnesota Lynx (@minnesotalynx) September 4, 2019\n\n\u201cNot trashing. Just facts,\u201d the team replied. \u201cWe have plenty of NBA players (and coaches) at our games, bruh\u2026\u201d\n\nGood look or not, the Lynx clearly aren\u2019t backing down.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "The Minnesota Lynx aren't buying Luka Doncic's support of the WNBA, and publicly called him out on Wednesday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/3tmXF3zKz0yiDzhMH.p8Ug--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03Njg-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/SPvvvwQ5AL69XQ3XxJDlZA--~B/aD0yODIwO3c9NDcwMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-06/e85bb3e0-8ecb-11e9-bfb7-21a00958af24"}
