He \u2013 and I \u2013 had been excluded. I felt gutted for my son.\n\n\u201cWe had only just got his NHS diagnoses but no support. I asked him: \u2018Shall we go over and say: \u2018Hello\u2019? and he quietly responded: \u2018No, it\u2019s OK, Mum.\u2019 In that moment I decided I would fight for my son\u2019s inclusion in society with everything I had.\u201d\n\nTania is now one of the UK\u2019s foremost Special Educational Needs and Disability campaigners. Her website Special Needs Jungle, which started in 2008 to help parents, now attracts 200,000 visits per month with around 50,000 followers across social media.\n\nShe is committed to highlighting the current Government\u2019s betrayal of SEND children, and a broken system of support that leaves thousands floundering in increasingly academically charged classrooms.\n\nShe said: \u201cThe problem lies both with culture and financial pressure. Attitudes need to change. Too many teachers and local authorities see parents as trying to \u2018take\u2019 something \u2018extra\u2019 or \u2018game the system\u2019, rather than just get what their disabled children are entitled to. The constant cuts to vulnerable children\u2019s services mean more are left without the support they need by dysfunctional bureaucracies more concerned with cost-cutting and their own policies than child welfare.\u201d\n\nA damning report published yesterday says the system \u201cbreeds conflict and despair as parents try to navigate a postcode lottery of provision\u201d. It follows an 18-month scrutiny of Government SEND reforms, with testimony from 70 witnesses and 700 submissions of written evidence.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nThe Commons Education Select Committee report adds: \u201cA lack of accountability plagues the system as local authorities, social care and health providers too frequently seek to pass the buck rather than take responsibility for providing support.\u201d\n\nAlmost 1.3 million kids need additional support in state education but only just over 250,000 have provision that is legally enforceable in the form of an Education, Health and Care Plan.\n\nThe committee recommended a more rigorous SEND inspection framework for local authorities, with clear consequences for failure; a direct line for parents and schools to appeal directly to the Department for Education when local authorities do not comply with the law; powers for the Local Government and Social Care Ombudsman to investigate school complaints; and development of more employment and training opportunities for over-16s.\n\nThe Government has announced it is injecting \u00a314billion into schools over the next three years. It has also pledged an extra \u00a3700million extra for kids with SEND in 2019/20.\n\nBut Tania said: \u201c\u00a3700million alone is simply not enough to change local authority SEND behaviour, and it won\u2019t address the other major problems in the system. The funding has only been announced for one year.\n\n\u201cRealistically, a \u00a3700million cash injection into the SEND system would only restore Local Authority funding positions back to roughly where they were before austerity. But it isn\u2019t just money, it\u2019s culture change that is key. You can throw millions at the system, but if councils don\u2019t teach their SEND staff, school leaders and teachers to follow the law, nothing will change.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cA 20% increase in tribunal appeals last year is a good illustration of what\u2019s going wrong in the SEND system, with \u00a3100million spent by councils on legal appeals since 2014 that could have been spent on children and young people.\u201d\n\nNearly 9 in 10 complaints about the EHCP process are found in favour of parents, said a report by Michael King, the Local Government and Social Care Ombudsman, describing it as \u201cexceptional and unprecedented.\n\nHe said councils\u2019 \u201csevere financial constraints\u201d were no excuse for failing to meet children\u2019s statutory rights.\n\nTania from Farnham, Surrey, added: \u201cWhat\u2019s more worrying is that it\u2019s only a small percentage of parents who feel able to fight the system. Many don\u2019t know their rights, or feel empowered enough to complain, or simply don\u2019t have the energy after caring for their child and putting food on the table.\u201d\n\nThis might explain why more than 8,000 children with SEND currently have no school place. They are also more likely to be affected by off-rolling, when a child is removed from a school for the school\u2019s benefit, rather than in the child\u2019s best interests.\n\nTania and husband Marco, both 52, feel lucky they were able to fight the system and accept their son\u2019s difference and later that of his young sibling diagnosed with similar conditions.\n\nUltimately, it enabled their boys to flourish. However, Tania \u2013 a member of national SEND advisory groups for Ofsted and a panel to improve SEND school leadership \u2013 is aware thousands of other parents do not have the same ability to take on the system.\n\nAnd she has devoted her life to giving those parents a voice.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE Surrey mum Tania Tirraoro now fights for other families of children with special educational needs and disabilities", "authors": ["Sharon Hendry", "Image", "Getty Images", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20393922.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Video-games.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
