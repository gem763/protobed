The Xbox One and PS4 were released in 2013 and the Switch was introduced in 2017.\n\nThe Switch is likely still early in its life cycle \u2014 the company just released the $199 Switch Lite, which cuts down on some functionality and focuses wholly on portable gameplay.\n\nA common refrain has been that there are too few titles available on the Switch, while I still think that\u2019s definitely true, Nintendo announced that 14 titles had sold more than 1 million copies, with four of its own games (Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Super Mario Odyssey and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate) selling more than 6 million copies.\n\nAs of June 30, 2019, Nintendo has sold nearly 38 million Switch consoles worldwide.", "description": "Nintendo\u2019s North American Switch unit sales have already surpassed the lifetime worldwide unit sales of the Wii U.
