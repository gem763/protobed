(AP) - A judge has stopped a temporary ban on the sale of flavored electronic cigarettes from going into effect in Montana for now.\n\nRavalli County District Judge Jennifer Lint signed a temporary restraining order Friday that prohibits Gov. Steve Bullock and state health officials from enforcing emergency rules on flavored vaping products. They were set to take effect Tuesday.\n\nLint was acting in response to a lawsuit filed Thursday by three vape shops and an industry group. They claim the 120-day ban is an overly restrictive reaction to a national outbreak of vaping-related illnesses and deaths they say is caused by illegal black-market products.\n\nBullock\u2019s press secretary, Erin Loranger, told the Ravalli Republic that officials are reviewing the judge\u2019s ruling.\n\nLint scheduled an Oct. 30 hearing on the temporary ban.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Ravalli Republic , http://www.ravallirepublic.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A judge has stopped a temporary ban on the sale of flavored electronic cigarettes from going into effect in Montana for now.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
