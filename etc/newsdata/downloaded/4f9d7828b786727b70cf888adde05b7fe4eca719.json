Power rankings: Champions League group stage 1/33 Champions League Group Stage Power Rankings All 32 teams ranked from those with the worst chances of winning it all to those with the best. Getty Images 2/33 32. Club Brugges Squeaked past Champions League minnows LASK in qualifying. Likely to find it difficult on this, the biggest stage. Getty 3/33 31. Dinamo Zagreb Passionately supported, but it is tough to forecast a Croatia 2018 style fairytale run. AFP/Getty Images 4/33 30. Slavia Prague Beat Cluj to win their place in the group stage and made life difficult for Chelsea in the Europa League last season. Getty 5/33 29. Olympiacos Stormed past FC Krasnodar in the Play-off round, but that might be the height of their Champions League efforts this season AFP/Getty Images 6/33 28. Genk Surprise Belgian champions last season, but may struggle to step up. Gheorghe Hagi never won the Champions League as a player, but I doubt son Ianis will right his father's wrongs in his first season in Belgium. AFP/Getty Images 7/33 27. Lokomotiv Moscow Some canny additions with plenty of European experience to complement a strong Russian base, but not enough top-end quality to predict progression. Getty Images 8/33 26. Galatasaray Jean Michael Seri and Ryan Babel have joined the Turkish champions, which bodes well after Fulham's efforts last season, even if Babel was something of a find. Europa League a realistic target. AFP/Getty Images 9/33 25. Red Star Belgrade The Serbian side will be bothersome at home, and have just installed a tank outside their ground for extra intimidation points, as they were last year, when they beat Liverpool. Lack true forward quality, though. Getty Images 10/33 24. FC Salzburg Austrian champions in each of the last six seasons, which counts for something. Not much, mind you, hence the low ranking. Getty Images 11/33 23. Atalanta Punched well above their weight as the surprise Serie A packages last season, but they may struggle more at this level. Getty Images 12/33 22. Shakhtar Donetsk A faded force from the heady Uefa Cup winning days, but they remain an entertaining Brazilian/Ukranian ying and yang. They'll have at least one 5-4 result, or something along those lines. AFP/Getty Images 13/33 21. Benfica Benfica remain extremely talented despite the departure of Joao Felix, but the hardened centre that is required for Champions League success isn't quite there. AFP/Getty Images 14/33 20. Lille An odd mishmash of forgotten faces (Jose Fonte, Loic Remy) and potential stars (Timothy Weah, Renato Sanches, Jonathan Bamba) but that might be to their detriment. Boom or bust. AFP/Getty Images 15/33 19. Zenit St Petersburg Ever a tricky trip, Zenit have a sneakily fun squad. Malcom will look to rebound from his torrid time at Barcelona. Getty Images 16/33 18. Valencia Europa League semi-finalists after dropping down last season, the squad is a coherent one with experience. Round of 16 likely if they get a friendly group draw. Bongarts/Getty Images 17/33 17. Lyon More impressive in the Champions League than Ligue 1 last season, in many ways. Gone are Tanguy Ndombele, Ferland Mendy and Nabil Fekir, however - a tough ask to replace such quality. AFP/Getty Images 18/33 16. Bayer Leverkusen They've lost Julian Brandt, but in Jonathan Tah, Leon Bailey and particularly Kai Havertz possess some of the best young talent in Germany. They'll be in the Round of 16 mix. Bongarts/Getty Images 19/33 15. Chelsea Untested manager, untested squad, and lost their only true attacking difference-maker in the summer. The Champions League could go very, very badly for Chelsea. AFP/Getty Images 20/33 14. Ajax Last year's semi-finalists, although they were made to sweat in qualifying this time around, and have lost star players Frenkie de Jong and Matthijs de Ligt. AFP/Getty Images 21/33 13. Napoli Dark horses part one. Kostas Manolas and Kalidou Koulibaly might be the best centre-half pairing in the competition, and they have plenty of attacking resources from which to draw. AFP/Getty Images 22/33 12. RB Leipzig Dark horses part two. The installation of Julian Naglesmann as manager will further stimulate a squad that, if it clicks, can cause serious damage. AFP/Getty Images 23/33 11. Inter Milan Antonio Conte is a shrewd appointment who will drill his side well defensively, and Romelu Lukaku is a proven goalscorer, scoff as you might. Diego Godin could be talismanic. Getty Images 24/33 10. Tottenham Hotspur Calm yourselves, Spurs fans, but it is hard not to forecast a regression to something resembling the mean. Rode their luck a bit last time out all the way to the final, and already flirting with a soft implosion. They may yet turn it around, of course. Getty Images 25/33 9. Atletico Madrid Probably not Atletico's year given the summer talent drain, but Diego Simeone's ability to grind out wins cannot be fully discounted. Getty Images 26/33 8. Bayern Munich Interesting defensive additions, but probably another year or two away from re-assembling themselves for another proper tilt for the crown. Bongarts/Getty Images 27/33 7. Borussia Dortmund Dortmund above Bayern? Yep! Lucien Favre is putting something special together. The re-signing of Mats Hummels shores up an inexperienced defence. Bongarts/Getty Images 28/33 6. PSG Neymar leaving could be a blessing in disguise, should he indeed depart for Barcelona, with the forward line's roles better clarified and Kylian Mbappe fulfilling his destiny as a super-club's key player. AFP/Getty Images 29/33 5. Real Madrid It could all come tumbling down in Madrid this year, but do not rule out Zinedine Zidane cobbling together a meaningful Champions League run from a squad that has plenty of pure talent. AFP/Getty Images 30/33 4. Juventus The Ronaldo project worked, to some extent, in year one, and Juventus are making the right moves to improve the team around him and properly contend in the Champions League this year. Matthijs De Ligt's development will be fun to watch, though Maurizio Sarri's rigidity may hinder the Italians. AFP/Getty Images 31/33 3. Liverpool Right in the mix, again. Jurgen Klopp's side are possibly due a slightly less successful campaign, though, and an injury drastically alters the appearance of such a settled lineup in key areas. Getty Images 32/33 2. Barcelona Lionel Messi wants another Champions League. That should be reason enough to rank Barcelona this highly, even after their recent misfires. Antoine Griezmann has arrived, Neymar may be on his way, Frenkie De Jong is the best young player in Europe - this might just be the Catalans' year. Getty Images 33/33 1. Manchester City Pep Guardiola's City tenure will not feel fully complete without taking them to the top of the Champions League mountain, and they are shaping as favourites, with squad depth, consistency and an ability to rip teams apart in four or five different ways.

Getty Images\n\n\u201cComing back to pre-season, I just kept my head down and worked hard in training. I feel good, probably stronger than ever at the moment.\n\n\u201cThe things that happened will stay private with the club. If you want answers, maybe you need to ask Real Madrid.\n\nBale, speaking ahead of Wales\u2019 Euro 2020 qualifier at home to Azerbaijan, was frozen out by Real manager Zinedine Zidane at the end of last season.\n\nThe situation came to a head in July when Zidane said he hoped a deal for Bale could be struck soon \u201cfor everyone\u2019s sake\u201d, prompting an angry response from the Welshman\u2019s agent Jonathan Barnett who labelled the Frenchman \u201ca disgrace\u201d.\n\nThe planned move to Chinese club Jiangsu Suning collapsed and Barnett said there would be \u201cno makeshift deals\u201d to get Bale out of Madrid.\n\nFollowing injuries to Eden Hazard and Marco Asensio, Bale has started Real\u2019s opening three league games and, on Sunday, he scored his first goals since March 16 with a brace in the 2-2 draw at Villarreal.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not been ideal, but I have been here before,\u201d Bale said. \u201cI know how to deal with it.\n\n\u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s the worst time of my career. I remember not playing for a year under Harry Redknapp.\n\n\u201cI have kept my head down, kept grinding through everything.\n\n\u201cI had a good pre-season in terms of training \u2013 not so much in games \u2013 then started the season well. Things in football, I know, can turn quickly. It\u2019s a matter of time always.\u201d\n\nBale has been heavily criticised by the Madrid media for failing to speak Spanish and not interacting with the squad at the Bernabeu.\n\nReal goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois appeared to make life more difficult for Bale last season when he said he did not attend a players-only dinner because \u201che goes to bed at 11pm\u201d.\n\nThe Belgium international also said the players called Bale \u201cThe Golfer\u201d because of his well-documented love for playing the game.\n\nBut Bale said he was happy with the nickname, saying: \u201cI am a golfer. Have you not seen the pictures?\n\n\u201cI spoke to him (Courtois) about it and he said it as a joke. People took it out of context, but I\u2019m very happy with the nickname to be honest. It\u2019s a great one.\n\n\u201cFootball is my number one sport. I\u2019m paid to do it and I always give my best. Golf is a hobby, like anyone else would have a hobby.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing wrong with having a round. People make a lot of it, but a lot of footballers play it and it\u2019s one thing I really enjoy. It keeps me calmer off the pitch and gives me time away from football, which is nice.\u201d\n\nWales are looking to their talisman to revive their Euro 2020 qualification hopes after back-to-back June defeats to Croatia and Hungary.\n\nBale was out-of-sorts in those games and, asked if he felt more settled now, he replied: \u201cI suppose so... the transfer window is closed now!\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think mentally it affected me at all, but maybe not playing for four, five, six weeks coming into those games, physically, I wasn\u2019t where I wanted to be.\n\n\u201cIt was a bit frustrating, but those games are over now and we have to forget about them and look to the future.\n\n\u201cNow it\u2019s a must-win \u2013 we need to win and get back on track. That\u2019s what we aim to do.\u201d", "description": "Gareth Bale has broken his silence on his difficult summer at Real Madrid by saying he feels stronger than ever.
