She would soon learn, by way of cryptic statements by law enforcement and, eventually, local news coverage, that she had been sexually assaulted behind a dumpster while unconscious by a 20-year-old Stanford student named Brock Turner.\n\nYou probably know the vague outlines of the story from there: Turner was found guilty of multiple felonies, including assault with intent to rape an intoxicated woman. He was sentenced by Judge Aaron Persky to six months in county jail, of which he would serve three. His victim, known then only as Emily Doe, wrote a searing victim impact statement, which was published on BuzzFeed and read on live TV, on the floor of Congress and by millions online. Persky was recalled. Turner was released from jail. Laws were changed.\n\nWhat you are less likely to have is a clear picture of Miller: her background in art, the way that writing runs in her family, her loving sister, the way she read all of the comments on the news coverage of her assault, her rage, her desire, her potential. With \u201cKnow My Name,\u201d Miller gets to reclaim her humanity.\n\nThere is an instinct to lionize survivors of sexual assault who are brave enough to share their stories, to put their experiences up on a pedestal for the edification of the larger culture. That instinct makes sense. In a culture that makes it nearly impossible for survivors to get justice or even be believed, we want to find meaning in tragedy made public. But to turn a survivor into a symbol, a lesson, a one-dimensional inspirational quote, is to flatten them and deprive them of their humanity. It is a particular cruelty to be defined by the worst thing that ever happened to you, and to exist in the public sphere only in relation to it. This is one of many injustices that Miller\u2019s memoir seeks to right.\n\nChanel Miller just wants what was always afforded to Brock Turner: to be viewed as a human being.\n\nIn our collective memories, we like to freeze in time women who become publicly identified victims, as though they were born only as their alleged assault was enacted and ceased to exist as soon as their stories stopped being front-page news. Christine Blasey Ford did not stop existing after Brett Kavanaugh was confirmed to the Supreme Court, and her story mattered before he entered her life. Her story did not stop being written, her wounds were not healed, her complexities were not diminished. The same goes for Andrea Constand and Aly Raisman and Emma Sulkowicz and Kyle Stephens and every person who has experienced a sexual trauma, regardless of whether it is made public.\n\n\u201cI did not come into existence when [Turner] harmed me,\u201d Miller writes. \u201cShe found her voice! I had a voice. He stripped it, left me groping around blind for a bit, but I always had it ... I do not owe him my success, my becoming, he did not create me. The only credit Brock can take is for assaulting me, and he could never even admit to that.\u201d\n\nMiller has an almost inconceivable well of perspective on her experience. She writes about the way that her relative anonymity allowed her statement to feel almost universal. Instead, she was allowed to become \u201cthe lady with the blue hair, the one with the nose ring. I was sixty-two, I was Latina, I was a man with a beard. How do you come after me, when it is all of us?\u201d\n\nAs women in a culture that does not respect us \u2014 one that views our bodies alternately as public property and private objects that should be obscured from view and \u201cprotected\u201d from impurity \u2014 we pretty much all have a story. After Miller\u2019s statement was published on BuzzFeed, I spoke to countless women who saw themselves or their loved ones in her words. Her words did not fade from public memory, because they were not attached to one face, one life that could be picked apart and mined for stereotypes and imperfect victimhood.\n\nMiller\u2019s memoir also articulates the way that sexual assault has ripple effects far beyond just the victim. So many of us have been counselors and confidants, holding our friends\u2019 pain the way that Miller\u2019s sister and parents and friends did. We wonder if we had just stayed at that bar an hour longer or just been more vigilant at that party, if we could have prevented irreversible damage perpetrated by someone who felt entitled to the bodies of our loved ones.\n\nWhen a story of sexual trauma becomes national news, there is a temptation to paper over the complexities in favor of a Big Uplifting Lesson. In a world of constant updates and 24-hour news cycles, we have become accustomed to reading a headline and moving on. We prefer stories that are digestible, stories with clear-cut, one-dimensional heroes and villains, stories that provide a pat lesson that allows us to believe that our work here is done. But healing is not linear, nor is it quick, and neither is real, lasting social change. And it is not the responsibility of survivors to make their pain and recovery more palatable to the masses.\n\nToward the end of the book, Miller describes a protracted tug of war with Stanford over a plaque that was to be placed at the scene of her assault, now a small garden with two benches. There was supposed to be a plaque engraved with a quote from Miller\u2019s victim impact statement, but Stanford would not approve any of the passages she suggested, because they were not uplifting enough.\n\nIt is not the responsibility of survivors to make their pain and recovery more palatable to the masses.\n\n\u201cAs a survivor, I feel a duty to provide a realistic view of the complexity of recovery,\u201d Miller writes. \u201cI am not here to rebrand the mess [Turner] made on campus. It is not my responsibility to alchemize what he did into healing words society can digest. I do not exist to be the eternal flame, the beacon, the flowers that bloom in your garden.\u201d\n\nChanel Miller just wants what was always afforded to Brock Turner: to be viewed as a human being, with likes and dislikes and communities surrounding her and pain and potential. At one point in the book, Miller wonders if Judge Persky and others who bemoaned all that Turner would lose if he faced significant legal consequences, saw her as \u201cfrozen\u201d in those 20 minutes of victimization.\n\n\u201cShe remained frozen,\u201d Miller writes, \u201cwhile Brock grew more and more multifaceted, his story unfolding, a spectrum of life and memories opening up around him. Nobody talked about the things she might go on to do.\u201d\n\nBut Miller also understands that the best way to go from headline to human is to write about and speak about your own story in your own words on your own terms. \u201cKnow My Name\u201d is a memoir, yes, but it\u2019s also a heart-wrenchingly honest manifesto for any survivor.\n\n\u201cThe barricades that held us down will not work anymore,\u201d Miller writes. \u201cAnd when silence and shame are gone, there will be nothing to stop us. We will not stand by as our mouths are covered, bodies entered. We will speak, we will speak, we will speak.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the world is finally ready to start listening.", "description": "Miller, known for years only as Emily Doe in the Stanford sexual assault case, has written a memoir that lays bare the complicated truths about survivorh...", "authors": ["Senior Women'S Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9151672400005f00d4b4d9.jpeg?cache=yncz5ymbis&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
