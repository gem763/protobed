(AP) - Three games, three victories and three dominant performances by the New England Patriots\u2018 defense.\n\nThe New York Jets became the latest opponent to fail to score an offensive touchdown against New England on Sunday in the Patriots\u2018 30-14 victory , making New England the first team in the Super Bowl era that hasn\u2019t allowed a rushing or passing TD in its first three games.\n\nNew York also had just 105 yards. Including the playoffs, that\u2019s the fewest yards allowed during Bill Belichick\u2019s 347 games as Patriots coach.\n\nNot surprisingly, it\u2019s put New England\u2019s defense at the top of several key categories.\n\nEntering Monday, the Patriots were allowing an NFL-low 5.7 points per game. They also led the league in total defense (199 yards per game) and were allowing the fewest passing yards (162.3) and rushing yards (36.7) per game.\n\nThose numbers are a bit inflated considering New England\u2019s wins are against three teams (Pittsburgh, Miami and New York) that are a combined 0-9 on the season.\n\nStill, the veteran-led group insists there is still plenty of room for improvement.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re pushing ourselves,\u201d safety Duron Harmon said. \u201cThe good thing about this defense is - obviously we\u2019re going to get coached - but we know what we want to do. We know how we want to play. We know what we want the tape to look like.\n\n\u201cAnd we\u2019re pushing each other to do it rather than the coaches pushing us week by week.\u201d\n\nA lot of that leadership comes from linebacker Dont\u2019a Hightower, who in his eighth season is tied for third on the team in tackles. He and fellow veteran Jamie Collins (team-high 19 tackles) are also two of the main reasons why teams have had so much trouble running the ball against the Patriots\n\nThat stability could take a hit this week after Hightower left Sunday\u2019s win in the fourth quarter with a shoulder injury. That was after defensive lineman Adam Butler left in the third quarter with a leg injury after combining on a sack with Hightower.\n\nHightower\u2019s injury is particularly worrisome considering he was limited to just five games in 2017 before having season-ending shoulder surgery.\n\nWHAT\u2019S WORKING\n\nThe offense didn\u2019t skip a beat after the team released receiver Antonio Brown on Friday. Tom Brady continued to spread the ball around despite the offense playing without running back James White and fullback James Develin.\n\nOn the season New England\u2019s offense is averaging 35.3 points per game, which is second in the NFL behind only the Ravens (36.7).\n\nWHAT NEEDS HELP\n\nIt seems there are still a few issues to iron out in the kicking game. Stephen Gostkowski missed his third extra point of 2019. It\u2019s just the second time in his career he\u2019s missed three extra points in a season.\n\nSTOCK UP\n\nFullback Jakob Johnson had a solid debut after being elevated from the practice squad to the 53-man roster on Saturday.\n\nJohnson, who is originally from Germany and played his college ball at Tennessee, signed with New England as a free agent in April as part of the NFL\u2019s International Pathway Program. He played two snaps on offense and six on special teams against New York.\n\n\u201cHe was not on our radar. I don\u2019t think we ever would have signed him,\u201d Belichick said Monday.\n\nBelichick said after some research and consultation with Butch Jones, who coached Johnson at Tennessee, Jones recommended him to Belichick.\n\n\u201cWhat he\u2019s done has been remarkable and in a relatively short period of time,\u201d Belichick said.\n\nSTOCK DOWN\n\nRookie quarterback Jarrett Stidham had a debut he\u2019d like to have back. After beating out Brian Hoyer in the preseason to be Brady\u2019s backup, Stidham saw his first action of the season with the Patriots cruising 30-7 with just under nine minutes to play in the game.\n\nStidham completed his first two passes before having his third intercepted by Jamal Adams and returned 61 yards for a touchdown. Brady re-entered on the next series and played the remainder of the game.\n\nINJURED\n\nIn addition to Hightower and Butler, receiver Julian Edelman left the game late in the second quarter on Sunday with a chest injury after making a reception and being sandwiched by a pair of Jets players. The Super Bowl MVP was favoring his ribs as he walked off the field. And on Monday, the Patriots placed Develin on injured reserve with a neck injury.\n\nReceiver Phillip Dorsett said if Edelman does have to miss any games, he has confidence the younger players will be ready to step in.\n\n\u201cThey need to be ready. And they were ready,\u201d Dorsett said.\n\nKEY NUMBER\n\n210. That\u2019s how many victories Brady has been a part of with the Patriots, breaking a tie with Hall of Famer George Blanda for second most in NFL history. Only kicker Adam Vinatieri has more with 217.\n\nNEXT STEPS\n\nThe Patriots stay in the division for a third consecutive week. This time could be a tougher challenge as they visit the 3-0 Bills.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Three games, three victories and three dominant performances by the New England Patriots' defense.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Kyle Hightower"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/22/jets_patriots_football_12480_c0-245-4018-2587_s1770x1032.jpg?3595112b17dadcd1a80f174b935c1e71af5aa131", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
