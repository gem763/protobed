As a result the average price for the 62 per cent benchmark was $US102 a tonne while Fortescue\u2019s once shaky price realisation ran at a healthy 89 per cent to the index. Fortescue reported revenue of $US85 a tonne through the quarter.\n\nFrom chief executive Elizabeth Gaines perspective, the more important data point of the quarter was Fortescue's steady cost outcome. Given Rio Tinto\u2019s mine planning calamity has added better that $US1 a tonne to its production costs, the battle for the title of the world\u2019s lowest cost major iron ore producer is a game of two \u2013 Fortescue and BHP.\n\nForrest's ATM collects more cash\n\nFortescue costs came in at $US12.95 per wet metric tonne through the September term (it should be noted the iron ore price is set on a dry metric tonne). That outcome reflected a steady Australian cost performance and the lower exchange rate (which makes Australian miners more competitive).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe inevitable product of higher received prices and flat-lining costs is that Fortescue ended another reporting period swamped in cash. Through the quarter Andrew Forrest\u2019s ATM added $US1.5 billion to a cash balance that hit $US3.4 billion by September\u2019s close.\n\nAn October $US500 million dividend payment and a December due $US600 million tax bill will eat into that addition. But even after accounting for that, Fortescue has added $US400 million to an already rich cash resource while paying down a further $US200 million of debt through the quarter.\n\nAt September 30, net debt stood at a very modest $US500 million with gross debt at US$3.9 billion. In the not-too-distant past, debt and its repayment was an existential issue for Fortescue. These days it is a matter of options and choices.\n\nFortescue has no debt due for repayment until 2022 and recent history \u2013 which saw that pillar cut in half by lower cost 2028 due debt \u2013 suggests that debt markets will be more than comfortable to replace that $US750 million pillar with longer-dated exposure to a business that, at current iron prices, looks ever more likely to prove resilient through iron ore\u2019s inevitable cycle.\n\nFor all of that, Fortescue management has set a test for the company\u2019s cash flow power with a capital investment program that sees the coinciding development of the Eliwana mine and the Iron Bridge magnetite project.\n\nTo refresh, the $US1.275 billion Eliwana development is effectively sustaining capital given it will replace Fortescue\u2019s expiring mines in the west Pilbara. The $US2.6 billion magnetite story is, on the other hand, all about growth, new markets and a strategy to deliver Fortescue with a material improvement in the average quality of its production.\n\nA concert of heavy capital lifting\n\nThis concert of activity leaves Fortescue with two years of heavy capital investment lifting. Through the current financial year the Third Force estimates it will allocate $US1 billion-$US1.2 billion on its dual tracked project development, with that toll to rise to $UD1.55-1.75 billion in 2021.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt this stage it looks like Eliwana progress will be comfortably covered by cash flow but Fortescue has acknowledged that the Iron Bridge project might need debt, although those requirements would be project financed and secured solely by the joint venture\u2019s assets.\n\nJust finally, Thursday bought further insight into the interesting iron ore trading business that Fortescue established earlier this year. It was planned to be a conduit between any Fortescue product parked at Chinese ports and smaller, irregular customers.\n\nWe mistakenly imagined this might be an attempt to capture some of the arbitrage that occasionally opens between the landed Chinese price and the domestic market price.\n\nBut Gaines set us straight on that one. She noted that, these days, that arb is not as routine or sizeable as it might have appeared in the past and that the story really is about finding new customers for Fortescue product.\n\nIt seems to me that Fortescue\u2019s new trading house, which is expected to account for up to five per cent of Fortescue\u2019s Chinese volumes this financial year, is likely all about finding the right homes for the lower grade materials that have, in the recent past, been left to develop into port-side market overhangs during those periods when the quality differential blows out.\n\nUn-cosy monopoly\n\nQantas has offered us a gentle reminder that not all duopolies are cosy affairs by responding with cautious vigour to internally received wisdom that it\u2019s financially stretched rival in domestic travel might once again be moving to capture market share.\n\nThe dominant domestic carrier has flagged plans to increase capacity by up to one per cent after \u201cpublished competitor capacity\u201d data revealed plans for growth \u201cdespite the weakness in the market\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe competitor accused of pursuing an irrational course is, of course, Virgin Australia. And certainly, its standing schedule shows 3 per cent growth over the second half bookings with additions being made to that as recently as last week.\n\nOn the face of it then, there sure seems to be a promise of more Virgin seats in the air and the only way that traditionally makes any financial sense is to lure more bums to them.\n\nBut there is another wing to the story here.\n\nApparently, for reasons obscure to airline neophytes like me, publishing more capacity than eventuates has been common practice at Virgin. And it is a game plan that is going to change under chief commercial officer John MacLeod, who started his new gig last week.\n\nWe are assured that since May Virgin capacity has trended down and that trajectory is going to hold for the remainder of the financial year at the very least.\n\nIt is also worth noting that one of the first things new chief executive Paul Scurrah did when he took over back in March was to order a network review. Its completion is understood to be imminent and it is obviously likely to throw a lens on Scurrah\u2019s longer term strategy.\n\nSo is Qantas boxing at shadows here?\n\nWell, should Virgin faithfully follow its marketing narrative, then quite possibly yes. Then again, what better way to encourage Scurrah to capacity rationality than a fly-past with menace?", "description": "Fortescue is in a virtuous cycle of cash accumulation and debt reduction as strong iron prices and cost management lead it to capital allocation freedom.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_3.3111%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/98e934da679357a615301865ce6a066df013e18f", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
