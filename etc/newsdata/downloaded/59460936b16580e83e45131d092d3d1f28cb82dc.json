According to Dyson, the device is capable of capturing 99.97% of particles, including microns, pollen, mold, dust, and more.\n\nThe purifier also has an integrated fan, so it can help keep your space a bit cooler on hot summer days. It has a night mode too, with which it'll monitor the air and react accordingly \u2014 but only on the quietest settings.\n\nDyson's TP02 air purifier is also beautifully designed. The model that's on sale comes in a classy blue color, so it should look good in any modern home.\n\nPerhaps the best thing about this deal is how inexpensive the device is with the $200 discount.
