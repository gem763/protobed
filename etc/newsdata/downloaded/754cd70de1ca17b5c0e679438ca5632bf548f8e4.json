This is for its profitable pickup trucks and SUVs, offsetting the US$3-billion hit from a U.S. labor strike.\n\nHowever, it made the decision to slash its earnings forecast.\n\nWall Street analysts have observed the strike costs as a tradeoff for three U.S. plant closures. In addition, they have agreed with a union to boost GM\u2019s profitability.\n\nMeanwhile, in midday trading, shares in GM were up 4.3 percent.\n\nIn a news report, Chief Financial Officer Dhivya Suryadevara at GM\u2019s headquarters stated, \u201cThe underlying business was strong this quarter,\u201d describing the strike as a \u201cone-time impact.\u201d\n\nLast Friday, the 48,000 United Auto Workers union members at GM approved a new four-year labor deal.\n\nThe agreement is with the Detroit firm, ending a 40-day strike.\n\nIn a research note, RBC Capital Markets analyst Joseph Spak termed the deal\u2019s financial impact \u201cmanageable.\u201d\n\nThird-Quarter Sales IncreaseThe Detroit-based automaker reported a six percent upsurge in third-quarter U.S. sales. Its increase was led by its highly profitable full-size pickup trucks, SUVs, and crossovers.\n\nThis equipment helped its race to a substantial profit margin of almost eleven percent in North America.\n\nCo-portfolio manager at Levin Easterly Partners, Chris Susanin, said, \u201cFrankly, I\u2019m as emboldened as ever,\u201d which maintained more than 4 million GM shares at the end of June.\n\nHe also added, \u201cI don\u2019t see why this stock isn\u2019t north of US$100 (a share) in a couple of years.\u201d\n\nAll of the pre-tax profits came from its North American businesses and its captive finance arm.\n\nThe decline was the fifth straight quarterly sales fall for GM in China.\n\nGM also cut its anticipated 2019 capital expenditures to around US$7.5 billion from its past outlook of US$8 billion to US$9 billion.\n\nOn the flip side, Suryadevara stated no strategies were cut, and the lower spend was due to functional efficiencies.\n\nGM will provide more comprehensive forecasts for 2020 early next year.\n\nHowever, Suryadevara indicated that one predictable 2020 challenge would likely lower U.S. industry sales.", "description": "Stocks Analysis by Elliot Chang covering: General Motors Company.
