These sources asked to remain anonymous in order to discuss private conversations with the president, and in one case also to avoid incurring the ire of Hannity, whom they called a \u201cperfectly nice guy.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s many radio and TV interviews, always touted as \u201cexclusives\u201d and rarely making any news, have been widely derided by media critics and political observers as simpering propaganda. And the president himself, a man famous for demanding relentless validation and unwavering loyalty, feels the same way.\n\nTrump has repeatedly\u2014and sometimes for a sustained period of time\u2014made fun of Hannity\u2019s interviewing skills, usually zeroing in on the low-quality laziness of the host\u2019s questions, the three people with direct knowledge tell The Daily Beast.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like he\u2019s not even trying,\u201d Trump has said, one source recalled, right before the president launched into a rough imitation of Hannity\u2019s voice and mannerisms to complain that the questions about how \u201cgreat I am\u201d give him nothing to work or have fun with.\n\nAnother person who\u2019s heard Trump make similar comments since his inauguration says they remember the president calling Hannity\u2019s softball questions \u201cdumb.\u201d This source recalled a round of ripping on the TV talker\u2019s interview style and cloying devotion to Trump that lasted long enough that the source glanced at their watch and started feeling sorry for Hannity.\n\n\u201cElection Day [2016], I actually called you, I said, \u2018You\u2019re gonna get bad news about\u2026 5:15 that afternoon. You lost Florida, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin.\u2019 And you won \u2019em all. Polls don\u2019t mean anything, do they?\u201d Hannity asked during his most recent Fox News interview with Trump this month.\n\n\u201cI lost them based on the fake news,\u201d Trump replied.\n\n\u201cFake news,\u201d Hannity repeated.\n\nThe president\u2019s recurring complaints often focus on how sycophantic the TV host can be, both on and off camera, with Hannity\u2019s slobbering leaving no friction to generate the sparks and drama that Trump craves.\n\n\u201cHe likes it as sport,\u201d a Republican close to the White House said, describing the president\u2019s long-running addiction to sparring with media figures.\n\nWhite House spokespeople did not respond to a request for comment on this story as of publication time. Neither did Hannity. Fox News declined to comment.\n\n\u201c[Trump] does enjoy the back-and-forth with the press\u2014look at this whole Jim Acosta thing,\u201d said Jeff Lord, a Trump ally and former CNN political commentator. \u201cThe president can call on anybody he wants. He could have ignored Jim Acosta. He didn\u2019t do it. And he didn\u2019t do it because\u2026 they would have some chance to do some verbal jousting there.\u201d\n\nLord recalled that when he interviewed the then-future president at Trump Tower in 2014, Trump had enthusiastically promised he would \u201cfight back\u201d hard against the \u201cdishonest\u201d press if he ran for the White House. \u201cDonald Trump delights in the combat with these folks,\u201d Lord added.\n\nDespite mocking Hannity\u2019s softball questions, the president \u201cloves Sean,\u201d according to numerous Trump friends and White House officials, and is said to value him as a close pal and prominent informal political adviser who has his finger on the pulse of conservative America in a way few do.\n\n\u201c Sean [Hannity] told me last night\u2026 \u201d is a phrase often heard by those closest to the president.\n\nBut Hannity is hardly the first friend or ally Trump has professed his love for even as he routinely disrespected or debased that person behind their back. For instance, when Oscar-winning actress and Trump acquaintance Marlee Matlin competed on Celebrity Apprentice, he repeatedly made fun of her by calling her \u201cretarded\u201d\u2014simply because she was deaf.\n\nWith Hannity, Trump hasn\u2019t always restrained himself until his friend was out of the room. Ahead of one of the president\u2019s closing rallies before the midterm elections this month, the 2020 Trump campaign announced Hannity would be appearing onstage with Trump as a \u201cspecial guest.\u201d\n\nFox News began telling news outlets the \u201cspecial guest\u201d designation was wrong, and that Hannity would only be at the rally in Missouri to interview Trump for his show. Hannity himself tweeted the day of the event, \u201cTo be clear, I will not be on stage campaigning with the president,\u201d and blamed any confusion on supposedly erroneous \u201creports\u201d instead of Team Trump\u2019s announcement.\n\nIn the middle of the political rally, the president called Hannity onstage anyway and told him to come up to the mic\u2014which Hannity did to campaign with the president he supposedly just covers on air.\n\nHannity\u2019s employer sprang into damage-control mode.\n\n\u201cFox News does not condone any talent participating in campaign events,\u201d the network said in a statement. \u201cWe have an extraordinary team of journalists helming our coverage tonight, and we are extremely proud of their work. This was an unfortunate distraction and has been addressed.\u201d\n\nAccording to a senior administration official, Trump was aware of Hannity and Fox News\u2019 stated position that the host would not campaign that night. The president simply \u201cdid not care\u201d and did it anyway, the official said.", "description": "Trump craves friction to set off sparks and drama.
