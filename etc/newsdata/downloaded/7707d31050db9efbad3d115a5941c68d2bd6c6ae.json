But, coming into the game after a 1-1 first-leg draw, it could just as easily be Atletico Madrid's Toni Duggan or the six Manchester City players who made Phil Neville's squad for the November friendlies.\n\nDuggan left City in 2017 to play for Barcelona, before moving to Atletico for the start of this season.\n\nCity looked fresh ahead of the first leg when they were unbeaten in eight games, having only conceded one goal. But recent form is less on their side going into the second leg of the last-16 tie.\n\nSince drawing with Atletico, City have lost their last two games, with a 2-0 defeat in the second ever women's Manchester derby against United followed by a 1-0 loss against Women's Super League title holders Arsenal on Sunday.\n\nWith his team without a shot on goal in both those games, City manager Nick Cushing says his team must improve quickly. \"When you don't have a shot you need people to do more,\" he said. \"You need players that are going to fight so hard to put the ball in the net. We're in a difficult period but every team goes through that.\"", "description": "At least one of the players named in the Lionesses squad on Tuesday will be knocked out of the Champions League on Wednesday in Madrid.", "authors": ["Sophie Penney", "Judy Murray", "Simon Briggs", "Fiona Tomas"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/womens-sport/2019/10/29/TELEMMGLPICT000213595151-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqDVVP44rv5UlyYG3jF1YoNMnE2riGfvSWVzJ6o-Dm59c.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
