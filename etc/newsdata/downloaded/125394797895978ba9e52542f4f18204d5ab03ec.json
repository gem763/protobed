Tomorrow in practice I want to focus on my jumps and spins.\u201d\n\nYou, a three-time South Korean national champion and still just 15 years old, also completed a triple Axel as she built a personal-best total of 78.22 points with Trusova, another 15-year-old third on 74.40.\n\n\u201cI have been working on the triple Axel for three years,\u201d she said. \u201cNow I feel good and have more confidence.\u201d\n\nTrusova, the reigning Russian national champion who landed four quadruple jumps in her most recent free skate in competition, didn\u2019t attempt a quad in her short programme.\n\nBradie Tennell, who took silver at Skate America behind Anna Shcherbakova last weekend ws in fourth ahead of 2018 Olympic silver medallist and two-time world champion Yevgenia Medvedeva, who fell on her closing triple Lutz after fluffing the landing of a double Axel.\n\nSkate Canada, being held this year in Kelowna in Western Canada, is the second of this season\u2019s ISU Grand Prix events.\n\nJapan\u2019s Yuzuru Hanyu was due to open his Grand Prix season later Friday in the men\u2019s short programme.\n\nIce dance opened with two-time world medallists Madison Hubbell and Zachary Donohue of the United States topping the rhythm dance with 83.21 points \u2014 1.76 less than their rhythm dance score last week at Skate America.\n\nThey relegated Canadian home hopes Piper Gilles and Paul Poirier to second by just 63-hundredths of a point going into Saturday\u2019s free dance.\n\n\u201cThe two of us are both very proud of what we did today,\u201d Gilles said. \u201cWe\u2019ve trained really hard on the Short Dance (Rhythm Dance) to make a statement.\n\n\u201cOur first program on the Grand Prix series is usually a tough one, so it was nice to have the home crowd behind us. We\u2019re excited for tomorrow.\u201d", "description": "Ottawa (AFP) \u2013 Japan\u2019s Rika Kihira delivered her trademark triple Axel to lead the women\u2019s short programme at Skate Canada Friday ahead", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/25/a5e839_japan-rika-kihira-skates-place-women-short-programme-2019-skate-canada-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
