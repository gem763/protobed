That\u2019s the situation Mike Pompeo and Steve Mnuchin find themselves in this Sunday morning, with Pompeo set for \u201cThis Week,\u201d \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d and \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d while Mnuchin guests on \u201cState of the Union.\u201d They were scheduled to discuss the standoff between Iran and Saudi Arabia, of course: On Trump\u2019s orders, Mnuchin\u2019s Treasury Department is imposing new sanctions on Tehran while Pompeo takes the lead on coordinating a U.S.-Saudi response to Iran\u2019s attack on Saudi oil facilities. But both will be challenged on the mysterious whistleblower complaint that\u2019s dominated the news over the last few days and which may or may not involve Trump threatening Ukraine with the loss of U.S. military aid if they didn\u2019t start investigating Joe Biden\u2019s son for corruption. What\u2019s tricky for the two is that they probably don\u2019t know what\u2019s in the complaint; anything they say this morning in Trump\u2019s defense could come back to haunt them if the evidence ends up contradicting them. They\u2019ll have to play it safe and defend Trump on the assumption that he\u2019s guilty of the worst-case scenario, an overt threat to cut Ukraine off if they didn\u2019t make trouble for the Democratic frontrunner. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d Pompeo and Mnuchin will argue.\n\nThere\u2019ll be Democrats on to discuss Ukraine and the whistleblower situation too, of course. If it\u2019s Sunday, it means \u201cPencil Neck\u201d Adam Schiff is in front of a camera somewhere; this week it\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d that has him. A more interesting guest may be Dem Sen. Chris Murphy, who met with Ukraine\u2019s president not long ago, after the July 25 phone call with Trump in which Trump allegedly leaned on him for help with Biden. Murphy\u2019s been tweeting about that encounter:\n\nA few weeks ago in Ukraine, I met w President Zelensky and we discussed the surprise cut off of aid and the inappropriate demands the Trump campaign was making of him. The obvious question everyone in Kiev was asking was \u2013 were the two things connected? https://t.co/8yXFiFRlQm \u2014 Chris Murphy (@ChrisMurphyCT) September 20, 2019\n\nI don\u2019t know what is in the whistleblower complaint, but it was clear to me that Ukraine officials were worried about the consequences of ignoring Giuliani\u2019s demands. And of course they were. That\u2019s why presidents shouldn\u2019t have their campaigns talking to foreign leaders. \u2014 Chris Murphy (@ChrisMurphyCT) September 20, 2019\n\nThat was three days ago. He was less circumspect on Friday evening, when reports emerged of Trump pressuring Zelensky on the Biden matter:\n\nTo ask a foreign leader to interfere in a presidential election \u2013 right after a year long investigation into potential foreign interference in a presidential election \u2013 would be pretty extraordinary. Even for these times. \u2014 Chris Murphy (@ChrisMurphyCT) September 20, 2019\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if there was a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d if he did actually beg a foreign government to interfere in our election. If you burn down the house, the fact that you didn\u2019t also burn down the garage is not exculpatory. https://t.co/ba5ZVFtmeh \u2014 Chris Murphy (@ChrisMurphyCT) September 21, 2019\n\nJudging by my twitter feed it seems like people think there are other things in politics that matter tonight besides the possibility that the President of the United States asked a foreign nation to ruin his political opponent and then cut off their foreign aid when they refused. \u2014 Chris Murphy (@ChrisMurphyCT) September 21, 2019\n\nMurphy is the lead guest on \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d where he\u2019ll elaborate on those themes. If none of that grabs you, though, keep an eye on \u201cThis Week\u201d after Pompeo\u2019s interview is over: The next guest is slated to be James Mattis, who\u2019s dodged questions about Trump\u2019s fitness at every opportunity during his book tour. Will the Ukraine revelations change that for him? If Mattis says something harsh, it\u2019ll affect the complexion of the story, both in the media and to some degree among Republicans in Congress.
