Apart from Rogers, all of the panelists signed letters, circulated among former senior intelligence officials, protesting Mr. Trump's decision last month to revoke former CIA director John Brennan's security clearance.\n\nHayden called the president's move \"punitive action for political dissent,\" adding that it was \"pretty easy\" to get signatures. (Nearly 200 intelligence and national security officials signed two separate letters protesting the president's move.)\n\n\"I felt it was my duty, my obligation, to speak up,\" Clapper said, though he acknowledged receiving \"blowback\" from both intelligence and military officials.\n\nFor his part, Rogers said he \"chose not to\" sign a letter \u2013 despite agreeing with the fundamental premise that citizens are entitled to express their views \u2013 out of concerns about the effectiveness of the measure and whether it had the potential to complicate the work of currently-serving intelligence officials.\n\n\"Pouring gasoline on a fire now is not going to reduce the flame,\" he said. \"And we've got enough fires burning right now, guys; we've got to focus on what are the outcomes we've got to achieve as a nation.\"", "description": "In rare public remarks, ex-National Security Agency Director and Cyber Command chief Adm.
