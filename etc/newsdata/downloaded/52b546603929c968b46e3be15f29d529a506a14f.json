Walmart stopped selling handguns in the mid-1990s, with the exception of Alaska. The latest move marks its complete exit from that business and instead sell hunting rifles and related ammunition only.\n\n\"We have a long heritage as a company of serving responsible hunters and sportsmen and women, and we're going to continue doing so,\" said a memo by Walmart's CEO Doug McMillon to be circulated to employees Tuesday afternoon.\n\nOpen carry\n\nThe retailer is further requesting that customers refrain from openly carrying firearms at its Walmart and Sam's Club stores unless they are law enforcement officers. However, it said that it won't be changing its policy for customers who have permits for concealed carry. Walmart says it will be adding signage in stores to inform customers of those changes.\n\nLast month, a gunman entered a Walmart store in El Paso, Texas, killing 22 people with an AK-style firearm that Walmart already bans the sale of, and marking the deadliest shooting in the company's history. Texas became an open carry state in 2016, allowing people to openly carry firearms in public.\n\nWalmart's moves will reduce its market share of ammunition from around 20 per cent to a range of about 6 to 9 per cent, according to Tuesday's memo. About half of its more than 4,750 U.S. stores sell firearms.\n\nThe U.S.'s largest retailer has been facing increasing pressure to change its gun policies by gun control activists, employees and politicians after the El Paso shooting and a second unrelated shooting in Dayton, Ohio, that killed nine people. A few days before that, two Walmart workers were killed by another worker at a store in Southaven, Mississippi.\n\nIn the aftermath of the El Paso shooting, Walmart ordered workers to remove video game signs and displays that depict violence from stores nationwide. But that fell well short of demands for the retailer to stop selling firearms entirely. Critics have also wanted Walmart to stop supporting politicians backed by the National Rifle Association.\n\nGun control advocates welcome move\n\nAt least one gun control activist group applauded Walmart's moves.\n\n\"Walmart deserves enormous credit for joining the strong and growing majority of Americans who know that we have too many guns in our country and they are too easy to get,\" said Igor Volsky, executive director and founder of Guns Down America, in a statement. \"That work doesn't end with Walmart's decision today. As Congress comes back to consider gun violence, Walmart should make it clear that it stands with Americans who are demanding real change.\"\n\nThe retailer has long found itself in an awkward spot with its customers and gun enthusiasts. Many of its stores are located in rural areas, where hunters depend on Walmart to get their equipment. Walmart is trying to walk a fine line by trying to embrace its hunting heritage while being a more responsible retailer.\n\nOther retailers, including Dick's Sporting Goods, have previously moved to abandon or scale back their sale of weapons. (Victor J. Blue/Bloomberg)\n\nWith its new policy on \"open carry,\" McMillon noted in his memo that individuals have tried to make a statement by carrying weapons into its stores just to frighten workers and customers. But there are well-intentioned customers acting lawfully who have also inadvertently caused a store to be evacuated and local law enforcement to be called to respond.\n\nHe says Walmart will continue to treat \"law-abiding customers with respect\" and it will have a \"non-confrontational approach.\"\n\nWalmart says it hopes to help other retailers by sharing its best practices like software that it uses for background checks. And the company, which in 2015 stopped selling assault rifles like the AR-style rifles used in several mass shootings, urged more debate on the reauthorization of the assault weapons ban while also calling for the government to strengthen background checks. McMillon says Walmart will send letters to the White House and the congressional leadership that calls for action on these \"common sense\" measures.\n\n\"In a complex situation lacking a simple solution, we are trying to take constructive steps to reduce the risk that events like these will happen again,\" McMillon wrote in his memo. \"The status quo is unacceptable.\"\n\nOver the last 15 years, Walmart had expanded beyond its hunting and fishing roots, carrying items like assault rifles in response to increasing demand. But particularly since 2015, often coinciding with major public mass shootings, the company has made moves to curb the sale of ammunition and guns.\n\nWalmart announced in February 2018 that it would no longer sell firearms and ammunition to people younger than 21 and also removed items resembling assault-style rifles from its website. Those moves were prompted by the mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida, that killed 17 people.\n\nIn 2015, Walmart stopped selling semi-automatic weapons like the AR-15-style rifle, the type used in the Dayton shooting. The retailer also doesn't sell large-capacity magazines, handguns (except in Alaska) or bump stocks, nor the AK-style firearm that was used by the El Paso shooter.\n\nOther retailers have made similar moves, including Dick's Sporting Goods, which moved to halt the sale of assault weapons following a school shooting in Florida last year.", "description": "Walmart says it will discontinue the sale of handgun ammunition and also publicly request that customers refrain from openly carrying firearms in stores even where state laws allow it.", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5268841.1567531617!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/el-paso-vigil.jpg"}
