Donald Trump is elected by his people. We want this.\"\n\nThe protests began peacefully but rapidly deteriorated into violence and vandalism over the afternoon, after police appeared to arrest a number of people in the busy Central subway station.\n\nProtesters erected a barricade at one of the subway exits before being setting it on fire.

The Sunday clashes indicate that an attempt by the Hong Kong government to defuse the crisis by withdrawing a controversial China extradition bill on Wednesday, one of the official five demands of the protest movementhad failed.\n\nLeading activists said the move was too little too late and already on Sunday groups of protesters have been heard chanting, \"Five demands, not one less.\"\n\nThe march is unlikely to end allegations by the Chinese government and state-run media that the United States has been interfering in the Hong Kong protests.\n\nSpeaking last week, Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office spokesman Yang Guang accused US politicians of \"shooting their mouths off\" on the demonstrations.\n\nProtesters wave United States flags during a protest in Hong Kong on Sunday September 8.\n\n'Most favored nation' status\n\nUS President Donald Trump has shown little inclination to get involved in the Hong Kong protests since they began in June.\n\nIn August he said he hoped the demonstrations would eventually work out \"for everybody, including China\" and that no one gets hurt.\n\nBut some US politicians have been pushing for greater US action to help the protesters, with some even pushing for an official re-evaluation of Hong Kong's \"most-favored-nation\" trade status with the United States.\n\nThat special status gives countries certain trade advantages, including lower tariffs on imported goods, according to the US government.\n\nA bipartisan group of US senators introduced the \"Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act\" in June, which requires an annual check that Hong Kong is autonomous enough \"to justify special treatment.\"\n\nProtesters wave US national flags as they march from Chater Garden to the US Consulate in Hong Kong on September 8.\n\nIt's this act which some protesters are calling on the US Congress to pass to put additional pressure on the Hong Kong government and Beijing to accede to their demands.\n\nThe interest US politicians have shown in Hong Kong, including Vice President Mike Pence and the Democrat Party leadership, have led to accusations from China that Washington is behind the three-month long demonstrations.\n\n\"It is an open secret in Hong Kong that the forces protesting the extradition bill have been sponsored by the US,\" Chinese state-run tabloid Global Times said in an editorial in July. Multiple high-ranking Chinese Foreign Ministry officials have repeated the claim without any proof.\n\nThe US State Department responded that Chinese claims of their involvement are \"ridiculous.\"\n\nA man holds a placard as protesters wave US national flags while they march from Chater Garden to the US Consulate in Hong Kong on September 8.\n\nMonths of protest chaos\n\nProtest organizers say millions of people have taken to the streets of Hong Kong since early June, in protests which evolved from objections to the planned extradition bill into wider calls for greater democracy and civil rights.\n\nCurrently the protest movement has five demands, including an investigation into allegations of police brutality and the release of arrested demonstrators.\n\nHong Kong protesters' 5 demands Fully withdraw the extradition bill Set up an independent inquiry to probe police brutality Withdraw the characterization of protests as \"riots\" Release those arrested at protests Implement universal suffrage in Hong Kong\n\nOn Wednesday, Chief Executive Carrie Lam announced one of the protesters' demands would be met by withdrawing the extradition bill from the local parliament.\n\nBut so far the government has refused to meet any of the other demands.\n\nDespite the withdrawal by Lam, there have been clashes between police and protesters every night in the past week.\n\nMuch of the action has focused on the streets around Prince Edward subway station, in the residential and commercial hub of Mong Kok, where video from Sunday night showed police officers chasing down and forcefully arresting protesters.\n\nDemonstrators at Sunday's march said that they're not going to back down until all their demands are met. \"It's just like going to work,\" 64-year-old protester Felix Wu said, laughing.", "description": "Protests calling on US President Donald Trump to intervene in the ongoing Hong Kong political standoff escalated rapidly Sunday, with marchers setting fire to a barricade outside a subway station entrance in the city's business district.", "authors": ["Ben Westcott", "Julia Hollingsworth", "Caitlin Hu"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190908152040-02-hong-kong-us-protests-0908-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
