The lung disease kills more than a million people a year, mostly in poor countries, and about one-third of the world's people harbor the bacteria that cause it.\n\nWISCONSIN COMPANY RECALLS 4,000 POUNDS OF BEEF PATTIES OVER METAL CONTAMINATION\n\nResults were reported Tuesday at a conference in India, the country hardest hit by TB, and published by the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nThere is a TB vaccine now, but it's given only to very young children and partly prevents severe complications. Researchers have been seeking a vaccine that also works in adults, to curb spread of the disease.\n\nGlaxoSmithKline's experimental vaccine was tested in nearly 3,600 adults in Kenya, South Africa and Zambia who were infected with TB but who did not also have HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.\n\nWOMAN CLAIMS BOTCHED NOSE, CHIN SURGERY LEFT HER WITH CROOKED MOUTH, DROOLING ISSUES\n\nHalf were given two doses of vaccine a month apart and the rest got dummy shots. Thirteen people in the vaccine group and 26 in the other group developed active TB.\n\nThe new results show that \"the vaccine is holding up\" over time, and mark an important step toward having a prevention tool that's been sought for 100 years, said Dr. Paula Fujiwara, scientific director of the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease, the group hosting the conference in Hyderabad, India.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nPlans are underway for another, definitive study, which will take at least several more years, she said.\n\nAfter two-year results were announced last year, the World Health Organization called the vaccine a major breakthrough and has been holding meetings to discuss how to further its development.", "description": "The lung disease kills more than a million people a year, mostly in poor countries, and about one-third of the world's people harbor the bacteria that cause it.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/tuberculosis_AP.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
