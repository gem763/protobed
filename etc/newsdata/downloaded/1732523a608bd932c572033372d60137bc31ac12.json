(Mohamed Al-Sayaghi/Reuters)\n\nA group of Republican and Democratic lawmakers is making a new push to end the Saudi-led bombing campaign in Yemen amid intensifying criticism of the air war following an attack on a rebel-run prison that may have killed more than 100 people Sunday.\n\nThe lawmakers\u2019 goal is to prohibit U.S. logistical support for the coalition\u2019s airstrikes through an amendment to the annual defense policy bill, a move that they hope would effectively ground the air campaign by banning the U.S. provision of spare parts that Saudi Arabia needs to maintain its planes. The measure would also restrict certain forms of intelligence-sharing.\n\nThe amendment, first presented by Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California, already passed in the House\u2019s version of the defense authorization, and now members of both chambers are pressing their colleagues not to remove it during conference negotiations with the Senate.\n\n\u201cWe strongly urge you to include the House provision that prohibits military support for the Saudi-led coalition\u2019s war\u201d against the Houthi rebels in Yemen, the lawmakers said in a letter obtained by The Washington Post that was signed by Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), as well as Republican Sens. Rand Paul (Ky.) and Mike Lee (Utah), and Reps. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), Mark Pocan (D-Wis.), Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) and dozens of others.\n\n\u201cInclusion of this amendment would ensure that our men and women in uniform are not involved in a war which has never been authorized by Congress, and continues to undermine rather than advance U.S. national security interests,\u201d the lawmakers wrote.\n\nThe letter is addressed to the top Republicans and Democrats on the armed services committees, who will negotiate a range of disparities between the House and Senate versions of the bill, including other Democratic amendments to reverse President Trump\u2019s ban on transgender troops and prohibit spending military money on military parades and Trump\u2019s properties.\n\nThe lawmakers\u2019 appeal comes as the Yemen conflict drags on in its fifth year, with the civilian death toll rising and feuding among factions allied with key U.S. partners complicating prospects for peace.\n\nThe Trump administration has urged a swift halt to clashes in southern Yemen between forces affiliated with the internationally recognized government, which is closely linked to Saudi Arabia, and forces backed by the kingdom\u2019s chief partner in Yemen, the United Arab Emirates.\n\nU.S. officials have long called for a political solution to end the war, but the Trump administration also has increasingly framed the conflict in terms of a larger regional standoff with Iran.\n\nMounting congressional frustration with Saudi Arabia \u2014 fueled partly by the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul last year \u2014 has resulted in a series of bipartisan legislative steps over the past year but has failed to end U.S. support for Saudi Arabia in the war.\n\nPentagon officials argue that a decision last year to halt aerial refueling of Saudi jets has limited military support. But the United States continues to share certain intelligence on Yemen with Saudi Arabia, even as it moves ahead with massive arms sales to the kingdom.\n\nThe House-passed version would also restrict U.S. maintenance of Saudi flight operations.\n\nSaudi officials have said they would prefer to press ahead with Washington as its primary military partner but that they can rely on other nations if needed.\n\nPentagon officials see Saudi Arabia as an important regional partner and a counterweight to Iran. But the stalemated conflict in Yemen, which has killed tens of thousands of people and thrust millions into near-famine conditions, has prompted widespread humanitarian criticism of the United States and Saudi Arabia.\n\nOn Monday, Yemeni medical workers pulled bodies from the bombed-out detention center run by the rebels that was hit Sunday. Dozens of people were wounded and more than 100 people were \u201cpresumed killed\u201d in the attack, the International Committee of the Red Cross said.\n\nSaudi officials said the facility was being used as an arms deport, and a spokesman for the Saudi-led coalition, Col. Turki al-Maliki, called it a \u201clegitimate military target.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow we must use Congress\u2019s power of the purse to block every nickel of taxpayer money from going to assist the Saudi dictatorship as it bombs and starves civilians in Yemen,\u201d Sanders said in a statement.", "description": "Move would prohibit U.S. logistical support for airstrikes and limit intelligence-sharing.", "authors": ["John Hudson", "National Security Reporter Focusing On The State Department", "Missy Ryan", "Reporter Covering The Pentagon", "Military Issues", "National Security", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/4Fa6jhkLwPIh5lV4ifsSLiJ82nQ=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/X4I5NJWN34I6TB72QUA2IVWAAM.jpg"}
