USA TODAY\n\nSAN FRANCISCO \u2013 The Los Angeles Clippers did not need to entice Kawhi Leonard with fancy dinners or glitzy tribute videos. Even before he met the Clippers this summer, Leonard already was sold on the franchise\u2019s direction.\n\nHe only needed to watch how the Clippers challenged the Golden State Warriors last season in the first round of the NBA playoffs.\n\n\u201cThey played with a lot of confidence and they knew they could play,\u201d Leonard said of the six-game series. \u201cThey wanted to guard everybody on the team at that point. That helped out (my decision).\u201d\n\nSo, Leonard joined the Clippers after winning his second NBA championship and Finals MVP, with Toronto, at the Warriors\u2019 expense.\n\nIn the Clippers\u2019 141-122 win over the Warriors on Thursday at Chase Center, Leonard and his teammates validated his vision on how a partnership with Paul George, acquired from Oklahoma City and sitting out while he recovers from offseason shoulder surgery, would work.\n\nKawhi Leonard looks at the scoreboard during the first half of the the Clippers' rout of the Warriors in San Francisco.

He also had nine assists and six rebounds in 21 minutes. Two days after Leonard scored 30 points on 12-of-19 shooting in the Clippers\u2019 season-opening win over the Los Angeles Lakers, the Warriors doubled Leonard and dared him to become a playmaker. So he did.\n\nThe Clippers\u2019 Lou Williams (22 points), Patrick Patterson (20), Montrezl Harrell (18), Ivica Zubac (16 points, 10 rebounds), and Landry Shamet (11 points) also cracked double figures. As Clippers coach Doc Rivers said, \u201cthat shows the trust he has in his teammates.\u201d\n\nAnd why wouldn\u2019t Leonard trust his teammates? After observing the Clippers last season, Leonard said he \u201cpretty much knew their character.\u201d Leonard\u2019s teammates displayed the same mindset that enabled them to challenge the top-seeded Warriors in the first round of the NBA playoffs only six months ago.\n\n\u201cThe fight we showed in that series absolutely helped in recruiting Paul and Kawhi,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cThey saw the grit of the team and seriousness of it. What player wouldn\u2019t want to join that?\u201d\n\nSaid guard Patrick Beverley: \u201cIt comes with the character of the team. Of course, Doc is a psycho genius with all of his plays. But that\u2019s the dynamic of our team.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Warriors were forced to rebuild after Kevin Durant left among several moves. They still have Stephen Curry and Draymond Green, but they have nine new players.\n\n\u201cThe Clippers have built something. What I admire about them is that it\u2019s not just that they had a good summer. It\u2019s what they did before that,\u201d Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. \u201cThey really built a foundation where they defended with energy. They had some grit to them and fought for everything.\u201d\n\nThe Clippers\u2019 foundation seemed sturdy in only their second game of the regular season. They held the Warriors to 39.5% shooting. They outscored them 46-33 in the third quarter. They led by as many as 31.\n\nThe Warriors experienced serious adjustments beyond hosting their first regular-season game at Chase Center after playing full-time at Oracle Arena in Oakland since 1971. The crowd sounded just as loud. The Warriors\u2019 ability to become a lovable and scrappy underdog only went so far. While Green played only 28 minutes because of a right elbow contusion that he described as \u201cpretty dead and painful,\u201d Kevon Looney lasted only 10 minutes before leaving with right hamstring tightness.\n\nIt does not seem to be a coincidence that Leonard ruined the Warriors\u2019 final game at Oracle Arena and their first game at Chase Center.\n\n\u201cI feel like those guys have their chemistry already,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cOnce PG and I came with the young fellas, they wanted us to do our thing. They welcomed us in with open arms and wanted us to be ourselves.\u201d\n\nKawhi Leonard and Paul George smile while sitting on the bench during their game against the Golden State Warriors.

They preached the importance of having consistent ball movement. They held frequent team dinners. They even hosted an early Halloween party.\n\n\u201cI think that carries over to the court,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cYou feel comfortable talking to a guy when he makes a mistake.\u201d\n\nFor example, Zubac drew whistles often after Leonard set him up. Zubac apologized: \u201cThey keep fouling me; I can\u2019t get you assists.\u201d\n\nLeonard answered: \u201cAs long as you score free throws and we get a win, I don\u2019t care about stats.\u201d\n\nFollow USA TODAY NBA writer Mark Medina on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.", "description": "L.A.
