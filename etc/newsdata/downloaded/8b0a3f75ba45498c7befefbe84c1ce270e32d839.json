The house and a 7.3-acre plot of land are listed with the Sarkis Team at Douglas Elliman for $US38 million ($56 million); an additional seven acres are listed separately for $US17 million, meaning that, if someone wants to buy Fireman's property as is, it will cost $US55 million.\n\nThe limestone mansion took just 19 months to build.\n\nThat might sound like a lot, but it's about what Fireman says he put into the property. In total, he spent \"between $US40 million and $US50 million,\" he explains. \"To be honest, I didn't have a budget; I just built it,\" he continues. \"I know it's a shameful thing. But meanwhile, what's left is a beautiful home.\"\n\nBuilt to the extreme\n\n\"The most incredible thing,\" Fireman says, \"is that it took only 19 months to build.\"\n\nThe entry foyer.\n\nEvery room has ceiling heights of at least 11 feet (3.35m); the floors, walls, and ceilings have from three to five inches (13cm) of plywood, in order to make the home \"as soundproof as you've ever heard.\" His contractors, Fireman says, \"built it to the extreme\".\n\nThe main entry, which spans the depth of the house, has a massive foyer with a curved staircase leading to upstairs bedrooms, a gym, and a massage room. The ground floor contains a formal dining room, library, living room, billiards room, and an office. Each floor can also be accessed via an elevator.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe house rests on three main levels, and all can be reached via elevator\n\nThe finishes, Fireman says, are particularly notable. \"We have a lot of marble and a lot of limestone\" shipped from a quarry in Indiana. \"Every block came numbered.\"\n\nThe wood panelling in the library is black walnut. \"We had a guy from France come in for a couple of months,\" Fireman explains. \"He and his assistant had to polish the ceiling and walls and floors by hand. The whole room is just like a piece of furniture.\"\n\nPerfect for art\n\nThe house was formally completed in 1999, and Fireman, his wife, and their decorator set about filling it with furniture and decorations.\n\nAll wood finishes were hand-polished.\n\n\"We had a very good time; we'd travel the world looking for antiques,\" he says. \"It wasn't quick and dirty, it was a long process.\" Along with decoration, Fireman says the house was perfect for his art collection.\n\n\"There's a lot of impressionist work, some contemporary, and some modern,\" he says. (Should a prospective buyer want the furniture, that would be a separate conversation.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn one photo in the house's listing, a Modigliani painting hangs above a fireplace. Photos of the house's interior on the architect's website display paintings by Marc Chagall, Pablo Picasso, Fernand L\u00e9ger, and Mark Rothko, along with sculptures by Nikki de Saint Phalle and others.\n\nLast lap\n\nThe formal dining room.\n\nFireman decided to sell, he says, \"because we got older. Twenty years will do it to you-we're in the last lap, so to speak.\"\n\nHis children are all married and no longer live in the house, and so \"we ended up buying another house, taking it down, and building something quieter and smaller and yet, still very nice\".\n\nHis house, Fireman says, will appeal to anyone who likes \"the privacy, and the exclusiveness\" of the land. \"I'd also assume they'll be pretty wealthy,\" he says.\n\nThe entire property is \"beautiful and glamorous, and if I was 40, I'd stay in it, but I'm 75,\" Fireman continues. \"The house will be here 500 years from now.\"\n\nOne of the house's eight bedrooms.\n\nBloomberg", "description": "\"It started when I was just looking for a family room, and one thing led to another,\" says Reebok's former CEO. \"I just got carried away a little bit.\"", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.8929%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_297%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/8c709b1ea5057e9115862ccadd3463cc1e6bae85", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
