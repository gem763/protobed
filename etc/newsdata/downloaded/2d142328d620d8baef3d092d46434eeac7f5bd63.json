To attend the One Young World Summit event, Meghan wore a red leather skirt from BOSS by Hugo Boss, which she paired with a Joseph sweater. The duchess finished her look with Sarah Flint's Perfect Pumps and a pair of Emily Mortimer's Hera Diamond and Gold Studs.\n\nAnd People has noted that Meghan also wore two new gold rings, both by Canadian jeweler Vargas Goteo, a brand that supports endangered animals around the world by donating proceeds from their sales to various charities.\n\nView photos Photo credit: JEREMY SELWYN - Getty Images More\n\nView photos Photo credit: JEREMY SELWYN - Getty Images More\n\nOne of the Vargas Goteo designs worn by Meghan, the Manta Kiss Stack Ring, supports Manta Ray conservation via the Manta Trust. The other, the Bow Knot Ring, is from the brand's High Seas collection. And according to the founder of Vargas Goteo, Meghan sourced the rings herself.\n\nDesigner Alex Prijic Smith, who founded the Montreal-based brand in 2010, told People, \"To see my work out there and on such a remarkable woman really is a dream come true.\" The brand is dedicated to \"highlighting the conservation of poached, illegally traded and irresponsibly sourced wildlife,\" via its designs.\n\nThe fact that Vargas Goteo focuses on \"bringing ethical and social responsibility to fine jewelry\" is undoubtedly another benefit, as its focus is firmly on sustainability. Per the brand's website, \"Each collection raises awareness and contributes directly to carefully selected ocean and wildlife organization campaigns. These include anti-shark finning, manta ray conservation, coral reef restoration, anti-ivory poaching and anti-rhino poaching organizations.\"\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "Sustainable jewelry brand, Vargas Goteo, highlights \"the conservation of poached, illegally traded, and irresponsibly sourced wildlife.\"", "authors": ["Amy Mackelden"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/AjGJFtCrrTGAT2tYHnDsoQ--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/harper_s_bazaar_391/bbc17bb879118e74fa22069c9933c8c9", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
