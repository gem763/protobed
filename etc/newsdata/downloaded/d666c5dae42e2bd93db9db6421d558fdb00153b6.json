At 26 weeks it is one in 10.\n\nProf Andrew Whitelaw, an expert in neonatal medicine at Bristol University, said the guidance was \"very useful\".\n\nHe said it was important not to get too fixed on the number of weeks and instead the condition of the baby at birth and different attitudes on what is considered \"unacceptable disability\" were important factors.\n\nWhy are chances of survival increasing?\n\nThere are a variety of reasons.\n\nOver the years, doctors and the wider health teams have got incrementally better at treating mothers and babies.\n\nSteroids are given before birth to help boost the function of the lungs.\n\nTechniques for ventilating and preventing infection among extremely premature babies have also improved.\n\nThe numbers of extremely premature babies being born in specialist hospitals have increased too.\n\nA decade ago just over half were. Now it is close to 80%.", "description": "Guidance says improvements in care mean extremely premature babies now have a better survival chance.", "authors": ["Nick Triggle", "Health Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/AEC7/production/_107934744_prematurebaby-gettyimage.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
