Fresh off of longtime friend Misha Nonoo\u2019s wedding celebration in Italy, Meghan Markle and Prince Harry made a stop in London this weekend to pick up Archie ahead of the 10-day trip. This is the family\u2019s first official tour together.\n\nHarry announced the trip via Instagram earlier this month, saying Africa has been a \u201csecond home\u201d to him over the past two decades.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait to introduce my wife and son to South Africa! We\u2019ll see all of you very soon,\u201d he wrote.\n\nAnd we might see baby Archie very soon, too. While he is not scheduled for an official appearance on the tour program, this trip is a chance to reintroduce the five-month-old royal to the world. As Meghan and Harry have chosen to remain largely private when it comes to their son, this would be the first time we get an official look at Archie in several months \u2014 and there will be plenty of opportunities for photos.\n\nThe family is kicking off the trip with a \u201cfemale empowerment training\u201d workshop in Cape Town. Foregoing royal celebrations or tourist attractions such as Table Mountain and Robben Island, the royal couple is instead opting to \u201croll up their sleeves and do work in the community,\u201d a source told The Telegraph.\n\nHarry will also be visiting Malawi, Angola, and Botswana while Meghan and Archie remain in Cape Town for several days. The tour will wrap up with a visit with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa and his wife, Dr. Tshepo Motsepe.\n\nThis is undoubtedly the beginning of many, many trips for little Archie. In fact, his rumored next stop is across the pond to his mom\u2019s hometown: Los Angeles.\n\nLike what you see?
