Last month, exports shrunk 11.7 percent compared to the previous year. Exports have been shrinking for 10 consecutive months. [news1]\n\nWith less than three months left on the calendar, nine foreign investment banks have lowered their outlooks for Korea\u2019s economic growth this year to below 2 percent.According to a report by the Korea Center for International Finance released last week, the investment banks\u2019 average predictions is now 1.9 percent.This is a sharp drop from the 2.6 percent growth that was the average prediction at the end of last year.Growth of 1.9 percent would be the slowest in a decade. The last time the Korean economy grew below 2 percent was in 2009, in the wake of the global financial meltdown of 2008. The Korean economy\u2019s growth in 2009 was 0.9 percent.Investment banks have been lowering their outlooks throughout the year. The average outlook at the end of May was 2.3 percent, which fell to 2.2 percent a month later, 2.1 percent at the end of July and 2 percent in August. The investment banks regularly revise their outlooks.The economy is being hurt by weak investment and consumer spending amid challenging external factors including the ongoing trade war between the United States and China and falling semiconductor prices.Credit Suisse recently lowered its outlook for this year from 2.2 percent to 1.8 percent, while HSBC lowered its from 2.3 percent to 2 percent. Barclays was changed from 2.1 percent to 1.9 percent and Bank of America Merrill Lynch revised its from 1.9 percent to 1.8 percent.HSBC is the only investment bank that still expects Korea\u2019s economy to expand 2 percent.The global credit rating agency Standard & Poor\u2019s also projects Korea\u2019s economic growth at 1.8 percent while the Korea Economic Research Institute expects 1.9 percent growth.\u201cThere are ample indices that show that the Korean economy is now entering a recession cycle variation in terms of facilities investment, industrial projections and pre-tax incomes,\u201d said Shin Se-don, a Sookmyung Women\u2019s University economics professor. \u201cThere are worries that Korea is entering a Japanese-type long-term recession once low growth and low inflation become fixed.\u201dHowever, the government remains optimistic.\u201cIt will be difficult to meet the government\u2019s economic growth target [between 2.4 and 2.5 percent],\u201d Finance Minister Hong Nam-ki told lawmakers on Oct. 2 during the National Assembly audit.\u201cWhile there are several research centers that project growth in the 1 percent range, many still believe in growth of more than 2 percent.\u201dThe government, Blue House and ruling Democratic Party argue that the weakening of the Korean economy is not structural but cyclical - and that Korea is doing better than some other countries.They have been emphasizing that Korea this year joined the so-called 30-50 Club, advanced economies with gross national income per capita of $30,000 or more and 50 million or higher populations.Others argue that Korea shouldn\u2019t have low growth rates like the other advanced economies in the 30-50 Club including the United States, Japan, Germany, Britain, France and Italy and should be growing faster.If Korea\u2019s economic growth is under 2 percent, it will be lower than that of the global economy, which is expected to grow at 2.9 percent.\u201cSince the government has been cherry-picking statistics, there\u2019s a difference with what that public actually feels in terms of the economy,\u201d said Yoo Gyeong-joon, a professor at the Techno Human Resource Development Graduate School at Korea University of Technology and Education, who once served as head of Statistics Korea, the government\u2019s statistical agency.\u201cThe lives of the public can only improve when [the government] admits when the results of its economic policy turn out to be the opposite of their intentions,\u201d Yoo said, \u201cand makes changes to the policies accordingly.\u201dIn her first public speech last week, Kristalina Georgieva, the new head of the International Monetary Fund, advised Korea to expand its spending to defend itself against a looming crisis.\u201cIn 2019, we expect slower growth in nearly 90 percent of the world,\u201d Georgieva said. \u201cThis widespread deceleration means that growth this year will fall to its lowest rate since the beginning of the decade.\u201dSingling out Korea, Germany and the Netherlands, Georgieva said these countries should increase spending especially in infrastructure and research and development to boost demand and their growth potential.by SOHN HAE-YONG [lee.hojeong@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://pds.joins.com/jmnet/koreajoongangdaily/_data/photo/2019/10/13212025.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
