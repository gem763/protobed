The modest growth marked a sharp pullback from July, when spending rose 0.5%, and was the weakest performance since February.\n\nConsumer spending is the driving force behind the U.S. economy, accounting for more than two-thirds of total economic output. With other sectors of the economy, such as manufacturing and business investment, buffeted by external headwinds, the slowdown in spending doesn't bode well for third-quarter economic growth.\n\nOn Thursday, forecasting firm Macroeconomic Advisers projected gross domestic product growth of 2.2% in the third quarter, a slowdown from the first three months of the year when growth logged in at a 3.1% annual pace.\n\nIn August, Americans pulled back on purchases of goods that don't last a long time, a category that includes things like clothing, food and gasoline.\n\nConsumers expressed less willingness to shop even as their incomes grew a solid 0.4% in August from a month earlier, led by a 0.6% jump in employee compensation.\n\nThe personal saving rate-the difference between after-tax income and spending-was 8.1% in August, up from 7.8% in July.\n\nAmerican consumers have generally been a bright spot for the economy in recent months, but signs are emerging of a weakening outlook. Retail sales excluding motor vehicles were flat in August, and consumer confidence has fallen recently.\n\nSlowing global growth, fading effects from the 2017 tax cut and rising trade frictions pose growing risks to the U.S., economists say. The Trump administration hit a new array of consumer products imported from China with higher tariffs at the beginning of this month.\n\nFor Ann Wingrove, president of Frankfort, Kentucky-based gift shop Completely Kentucky, tariffs are creating uncertainty. Even though her store's sales have increased about 9% this year compared with last as more customers trickle in to buy pottery and gift baskets, Ms. Wingrove remains worried about the future.\n\n\"I'm very concerned about consumer spending and how these tariffs are going to affect that,\" Ms. Wingrove said.\n\nCompletely Kentucky received notifications from one vendor, a Kentucky-based silk scarf artist, suggesting the gift store should make purchases before a 25% tariff for silk from China hits. If the scarf prices go up, Ms. Wingrove fears Completely Kentucky will have to raise prices and sell fewer scarves.\n\n\"I'm heavily staffed now so I am very concerned if our sales drop, I will have to lay people off,\" she said.\n\nWrite to Sarah Chaney at sarah.chaney@wsj.com and Paul Kiernan at paul.kiernan@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 27, 2019 08:45 ET (12:45 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
