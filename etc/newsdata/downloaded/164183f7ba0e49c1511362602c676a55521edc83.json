Here's why a top strategist at $2.9 trillion State Street says they're set to rally.", "language": "en", "text": "Michael Arone, a chief investment strategist for $2.9 trillion State Street Global Advisors, says healthcare stocks are extremely appealing even though investors are focused on the political risks the companies face.\n\nArone says fundamentals for healthcare stocks are getting better, which is rare in the stock market today. He thinks the stocks are likely to rally as the threat of Medicare for All fades.\n\nThe sector has lagged far behind the rest of the market this year, as the benchmark S&P 500 index is up 19.5% in 2019 and the healthcare sector overall has gained just 5.7%.\n\nClick here for more BI Prime stories.\n\nInvestors are always weighing the facts they can see against the fear of what they don't know.\n\nThat balance has been damaging for health care companies this year, and Michael Arone \u2014 the chief investment strategist for the US SPDR Business at $2.9 trillion State Street Global Advisors \u2014 says investors are going to realize they're getting it wrong.\n\nArone argues that Medicare for All proposals from leading Democratic presidential candidates, including Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, are a major reason the sector has missed out on the market's rally in 2019.\n\nWhile the benchmark S&P 500 has jumped 19.5%, led by tech companies and other growth stocks, the S&P healthcare index has risen just 5.7%. Only energy stocks have delivered weaker returns. But Arone says that if investors look deeper, they'll discover the sector has a lot of favorable characteristics.\n\n\"Once the noise of the political situation is removed, I think healthcare stocks will rally,\" Arone said in an exclusive interview with Business Insider.\n\nHe calls biotech and healthcare services companies especially intriguing. Investors who want to add exposure to those sectors can do so through the SPDR S&P Biotech ETF and SPDR S&P Healthcare Services ETF.\n\nOne reason for Arone's view is that the basic business metrics for healthcare companies are improving, which makes the stocks unique as trends for the broader market come down.\n\n\"It's one of the only areas where analysts have been increasing their earnings expectations,\" he said. \"Revenue growth and earnings per share growth of the healthcare sector is greater than that of the overall market.\"\n\nRead more: Investors are paying record amounts for stable high-growth companies.
