If some of the European top clubs were to offer \u20ac180m (\u00a3155m) we can start talking about selling him.'\n\nThe relationship between Napoli and Manchester City was fractured during their pursuit of Jorginho last summer, who ended up joining Chelsea instead to reunite with Maurizio Sarri.\n\nHowever, that is not expected to be a problem providing City can meet Napoli's valuation of the player.", "description": "According to The Guardian, Manchester City will send scouts to watch Ruiz (pictured above) in action when Napoli play Salzburg in the Champions League on Wednesday night.", "authors": ["Jordan Seward For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/14/20084178-0-image-a-29_1571836666993.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
