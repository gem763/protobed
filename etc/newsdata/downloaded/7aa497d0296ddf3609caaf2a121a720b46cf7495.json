The report is coming ahead of Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nonfarm payrolls report for September, which will be closely watched for signs of strength in the economy.\n\n\"We are really counting on the consumer to kind of carry us through here amid the slow patch in manufacturing,\" said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida.\n\nBrown said a rebound in the services sector in August from its weakest level in nearly three years was indicative of the health of the overall economy, but \"markets are going to be pretty sensitive to any surprise on the downside.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nData earlier Thursday showed that initial jobless claims rose marginally last week, suggesting the labor market remains strong even as employers are becoming more cautious about hiring workers.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, shares in Pepsi (NASDAQ:PEP) were higher after it beat quarterly revenue and profit estimates, as ramped up advertising and new low calorie versions of Gatorade boosted demand for its beverages in North America.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrewer Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ) fell despite raiseing its full-year adjusted profit forecast. It beat Wall Street estimates for second quarter profit on the back of strong summer demand for Corona and Modelo beers, but shares fell after it said it took a $839 million write down in the value of its investment in pot firm Canopy Growth (TO:WEED) during the quarter.\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscount wholesaler Costco (NASDAQ:COST) was set to report after the close.\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares fell more than 5% after it fell short of expectations with its third-quarter deliveries, which totalled 97,000. CEO Elon Musk had predicted the company would crack 100,000 for the first time.\n\nThe U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, was treading water, while gold futures were almost unchanged at $1,507.55 a troy ounce. Crude oil futures were down 1.6% at $51.76 a barrel.\n\n--Reuters contributed to this report\n\nRelated Articles\n\nTesla Earnings Beat, Revenue Misses In Q3\n\nNetflix Falls 3%\n\nCorona maker Constellation hit by pot investment loss\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "Investing.com - Wall Street opened flat to lower on Thursday, following a seep selloff in the previous two sessions as investors eyed services sector data due later in the day amid concerns over the deepening impact of global trade tensions on the U.S. economy.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ixB064XMgf9U6Jo_SuaRMg--~B/aD0zMzMzO3c9NTAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-10/2a8b5b10-e60d-11e9-adff-1464d1fe0a3e", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
