They also held signs of support, thanking Morey for speaking out.\n\nHong Kong protesters watched a LeBron James jersey burn in the street after his Daryl Morey comments. (AP)\n\n\u2018Hong Kong people are really suffering\u2019\n\n\u201cHong Kong people are really suffering right now,\u201d web designer and basketball fan James Lo told the Associated Press. \u201cNow you come off a speech like that, we are very angry. People start burning his jersey ... just because of his speech.\u201d\n\nJames\u2019 comments echoed a refrain common in NBA circles that appears to prioritize the league\u2019s significant financial interests in China over the human rights issues at stake in Hong Kong and Morey\u2019s ability to speak freely on the subject.\n\nChina immediately condemned Morey\u2019s since-deleted Oct. 5 tweet that read \u201cFight For Freedom. Stand With Hong Kong\u201d and has since taken steps to limit access to the NBA through state-run media to its 1.4 billion citizens.\n\nNBA\u2019s controversial response\n\nStory continues\n\nThe NBA\u2019s initial response to Morey\u2019s tweet condemned it as \u201cregrettable\u201d in an official league statement. NBA commissioner Adam Silver has since vowed that the league won\u2019t regulate speech as prominent figures such as James, Steve Kerr and Stephen Curry have declined to address the Hong Kong protests directly, claiming they aren\u2019t informed enough on the issue to do so.\n\nJames at odds with Hong Kong priorities\n\nJames appeared to be speaking about the financial and political backlash against the NBA rather than the larger Hong Kong issue when he spoke Monday about \u201charm\u201d caused by Morey\u2019s tweet.\n\n\u201cSometimes you have to think through the things that you say and may cause harm not only for yourself but for the majority of people,\u201d James said. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s just a prime example.\u201d\n\nLo deemed James\u2019 stance unacceptable.\n\n\u201cStudents, they come out like every weekend,\u201d Lo said. \u201cThey've got tear-gassed and then they got gun shot, like every weekend. Police beating students and then innocent people, like every day. And then he [James] just comes up with something [like] that. We just can't accept that.\u201d\n\nAnother protester \u2014 36-year-old office worker William Mok \u2014 compared the plight of the people of Hong Kong to a cause commonly supported in NBA circles.\n\n\"Please remember, all NBA players, what you said before: 'Black lives matter.' Hong Kong lives also matter.\u201d\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Hong Kong protesters watched a LeBron James jersey burn in the street after his Daryl Morey comments.", "authors": ["Jason Owens"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/m_Euw_zYQr37lnKwHpg8_A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Udctlmqq0UwqvNGlFkLt.w--~B/aD0zMzMzO3c9NTAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/764e43c0-ef7a-11e9-bf4d-3c43a08c9dc8", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
