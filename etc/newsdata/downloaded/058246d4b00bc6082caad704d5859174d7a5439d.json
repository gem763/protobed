McCready told supporters Tuesday morning that the race is \u201creally close\u201d \u2014 but that a victory would \u201csend a shock wave across this entire country.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cA lot of people want to talk about 2020,\u201d McCready said Tuesday morning. \u201cLet me tell you right now \u2014 you want to win in 2020? Let\u2019s go win this race tonight.\u201d\n\nBishop, meanwhile, said outside a suburban polling place in Union County, a Republican stronghold, that President Donald Trump\u2019s election-eve rally in Fayetteville on Monday would put him over the top.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019m going to win,\u201d said Bishop, calling Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, who also headlined events for Bishop on Monday, \u201cenormously helpful\u201d to his campaign.\n\nPolls close at 7:30 p.m. Eastern. McCready and Bishop are battling for the still-vacant seat after the 2018 election result \u2014 an apparent 905-vote victory for Republican Mark Harris over McCready \u2014 was thrown out after the emergence of credible evidence of election fraud committed by one of Harris\u2019 campaign contractors. Harris declined to run in the new election ordered by the state elections board, and Bishop won the Republican nomination in a primary this spring.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

Democrats say the fact that the long-time GOP district is in play again is a sign the national environment has changed little since the midterms \u2014 though a Republican victory could act as a salve for a party still reeling from losing the House last November and worrying about Trump\u2019s low job-approval ratings ahead of the 2020 election.\n\nBut if McCready wins in a district Trump carried by 12 points in the 2016 election, it would signal significant vulnerability for the president and deal a blow to the GOP\u2019s hopes of winning back the House majority next year.\n\nThere is also a special election in North Carolina\u2019s 3rd District on Tuesday, where Republican Greg Murphy and Democrat Allen Thomas are competing to succeed the late GOP Rep. Walter Jones, who died earlier this year. But that heavily Republican district has attracted far less attention \u2014 and money \u2014 than the Bishop-McCready race.\n\nThe contest between Bishop and McCready has attracted more than $10 million in outside spending, the second-most ever for a special election for the House. The National Republican Congressional Committee and Congressional Leadership Fund, the leading pro-GOP super PAC for House races, have combined to spend more than $5 million.\n\nDemocratic groups have also engaged, with the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and House Majority Forward, a nonprofit group linked to Democratic leaders, each spending more than $1 million.\n\nBefore the polls even closed, some Republicans on Capitol Hill were lowering expectations and already lining up scapegoats in case Bishop falters.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s amazing is that we\u2019re competitive in that district. The other guy has now raised and spent over $10 million. I don\u2019t even know how the heck we\u2019re competitive,\u201d said Rep. Steve Stivers (R-Ohio), who chaired the NRCC during the 2018 election. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we won it; I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we lost it. But that\u2019s okay, given that the other guy is so well known and our guy is brand new, and we\u2019re burying the taint of scandal of November. And we\u2019re still in it. I\u2019m amazed we\u2019re still in it.\u201d\n\nDan Bishop. | Chuck Burton/AP Photo\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), who traveled to North Carolina with Trump on Air Force One Monday night, warned against reading too much into the results of the race. \u201cSpecial elections are just what they are: special,\u201d McCarthy told reporters at his weekly press conference Tuesday.\n\nMcCready, a Marine veteran running in a district that hasn\u2019t gone Democratic since the early 1960s, has campaigned since 2017 as a bipartisan figure who wouldn\u2019t vote for Nancy Pelosi for speaker.\n\nThis year, McCready has focused on health care, pledging to \u201cfix\u201d the 2010 Affordable Care Act. Asked Tuesday about some of the health care proposals among Democrats\u2019 2020 presidential candidates, McCready called some of them \u201ccrazy\u201d ideas.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of crazy, aspirational stuff coming out of those presidential debates,\u201d the Democrat said. All we got to do is stand up to the drug companies, stand up to the special interests. We got to fix Obamacare \u2014 we got to fix the problems in the system.\u201d\n\nBut Bishop \u2014 who says he\u2019ll be a strong supporter of Trump and his agenda if elected \u2014 has sought to link McCready to prominent Democratic liberals. He cited contributions McCready has received from billionaire presidential candidate Tom Steyer and Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), whose money McCready returned. (According to Federal Election Commission filings, Omar donated $2,000 to McCready on Nov. 6 of last year, and McCready refunded the donation on March 30 of this year.)\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s where his money\u2019s coming from,\u201d Bishop said. \u201cThat doesn't happen if those people believe he's a force for moderation. So I suggest \u2014 have suggested \u2014 that it's kind of a scam. It's sort of a phony presentation and a way to flip a seat blue.\"\n\nJake Sherman in Indian Trail, N.C., and Melanie Zanona in Washington contributed to this report.", "description": "The race for a Republican-leaning district anchored in the Charlotte suburbs is the latest special election test of the Trump presidency.", "authors": ["Steven Shepard"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/86/61/b0bbb06446be9a31dc515ad0dc68/190910-nc09-pmlede-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
