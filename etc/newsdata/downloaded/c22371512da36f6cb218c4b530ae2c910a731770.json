But if there\u2019s one thing that\u2019s obvious from the Ukraine controversy, it\u2019s that the president could use more \u201cno men.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nDuring Roman triumphs celebrating military victories, a slave was supposedly given the task of riding behind the conquering general and constantly whispering in his ear, \u201cRemember, you are mortal.\u201d The White House needs someone constantly whispering in the president\u2019s ear, \u201cThere\u2019s no freaking way we\u2019re doing that.\u201d\n\nAnyone who had taken Government 101 would have told the president going down the path of asking for investigations from the Ukraine president in the context of a discussion of military aid would certainly bring more headaches than upside.\n\nIf press reports are to be believed, plenty of people in the White House realized this. They tried to keep Trump from doing it, but were outmaneuvered by Rudy Giuliani who volunteered for double duty as an amateur sleuth and diplomat and has honchoed arguably the most harebrained foreign policy scheme since Ollie North delivered a cake to the Iranians.\n\nIt\u2019s not that there aren\u2019t legitimate questions about Ukraine and the role of various players there in the 2016 election and aftermath. But they are appropriately handled by the Justice Department, which is currently looking into the sources of the Russia investigation that so obsessed the media and that largely came up empty.\n\nAs for Hunter Biden, he, too, is a fit subject for investigation and an apt symbol of one of the worst aspects of American life, namely, how easy it is for people with proximity to power to get rich. Hunter had no evident talent worthy of a $50,000-a-month gig with a Ukrainian energy company, except for being the vice president\u2019s son.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason, though, that oppo research firms exist. No one could claim an abuse of power if the Trump campaign hired such an operation to thoroughly vet Hunter Biden\u2019s various ventures, and spread damaging material to media outlets. If the campaign wanted to be just a little clever, it could take a page from Hillary Clinton 2016 and use a law firm as a cut-out.\n\nDid no one think of that? Trump is, obviously, responsible for his own decisions and conduct, but it\u2019s truly bizarre that it was the president\u2019s personal lawyer, of all people, who has his fingerprints all over this.\n\nGiuliani was a great mayor of New York City and an accomplished prosecutor, but somewhere along the line lost sight of such basic axioms as a lawyer should keep his client from needless risk, not expose him to it; a lawyer should tap the brakes on, not jam the accelerator for, dodgy plans; a lawyer should calmly explain issues, rather than blow them up in extravagant media appearances.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to think of another president who has so desperately needed good lawyering, and who has been so flagrantly failed by someone who is supposed to be his attorney.\n\nOne of themes of the Mueller report was Trump\u2019s advisers ignoring him when he asked for foolhardy things or dissuading him from risky schemes. This, in itself, was discomfiting, but it kept Trump on the right side of the line. For all that the president scorns, say, Don McGahn, the former White House counsel\u2019s prudence and professionalism kept Trump from unnecessary peril.\n\nTrump finds his current crew more congenial. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s better for him. Let the record show that the same people who are most enthusiastic about \u201cletting Trump be Trump,\u201d also may be about to let Trump be impeached.\n\nThere\u2019s an argument among pundits that Trump might welcome impeachment proceedings. Certainly, he\u2019d relish the fight more than any other politician. But Trump has given every indication that he hates the idea of being impeached. He, or at least people around him, might think about how he got here.\n\nTrump disdains stories in the media about his being minded by \u201cadults,\u201d but that should be less annoying than the fallout from a plan that any serious lawyer or competent foreign policy professional would have warned had a good chance of ending in tears.\n\n\n\n", "description": "If there\u2019s one thing that\u2019s obvious from the Ukraine controversy, it\u2019s that President Donald Trump could use more \u201cno men.\u201d", "authors": ["Rich Lowry"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/89/4e/b42acbbc43df812d9e90e3a63685/190925-rudy-giuliani-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
