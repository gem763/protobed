When the balance of fluids changes as a result of extreme dieting in the lead up to fights, boxers are thought to be more vulnerable. But no-one knows what the chemical limit is.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nThe problem is rooted in a culture where fighters seek any advantage, squeezing the weight to be as light as they can thinking that gives them an edge.\n\nThus a boxer who walks around at middleweight, 160 pounds, might shrink to welterweight (147) for the purposes of the weigh-in then, 24 hours later, enter the ring almost as a middleweight again.\n\nWhen I fought at featherweight, (9st, or 126lbs) I walked around at 10st 4lbs, then that became 10st 7lbs, 10st 10lbs, and it became harder to make weight.\n\nThe whole process is horrible, eating little and training. The problem is you can\u2019t spar for ten rounds with the heart rate at 80/90 percent of maximum without refuelling.\n\n(Image: Daily Mirror)\n\nSo fighters leave it late to shed the pounds. The vast majority make it safely.\n\nSince all fighters do this you might ask why bother? Why not just fight at your biological weight?\n\nThe fact is sportsmen will always try to seek an advantage where they can. Ultimately the responsibility lies with fighter, manager and his coach to manage the process safely.\n\nWhen I fought Young Ali I weighed in on the day of the fight. The weigh-in was moved forward 24 hours after a spate of deaths in the 80s to allow fighters time to rehydrate.\n\nThe problem is it is not always achievable in cases of extreme weight loss. The WBC are trying to implement a rule that states fighters must be within a certain percentage of the weight 30 days out, two weeks out and seven days out to make the process safer.\n\nThe British Boxing of Board Control operates a week out and then a three-day check to ensure you are within a regulated percentage. Perhaps this should be universally applied.\n\nIn any sport at the highest level you are on the edge. At elite level in boxing opponets have power, intelligence and craft. They hit harder and are harder to hit.\n\nMistakes at the top are paid for. In extreme cases, as we have seen to our cost, this can be fatal.", "description": "Tragedy struck this week as young Patrick Day became the sixth boxer to pass away in 18 months following a professional bout", "authors": ["Barry Mcguigan", "Image", "Getty Images", "Daily Mirror"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20638133.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-1180866211.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
