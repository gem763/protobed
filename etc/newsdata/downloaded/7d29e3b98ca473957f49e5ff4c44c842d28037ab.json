But The \u201cDeep State\u201d Are The \"Good Guys!\u201d", "language": "en", "text": "The opinions expressed by columnists are their own and do not represent the views of Townhall.com.\n\n\u201cWhat Trump calls the \u2018deep state\u2019 in the United States is protecting the American people and protecting the Constitution. It\u2019s a positive thing in this sense.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a direct quote from New York Times\u2019 columnist James B. Stewart responding to Savannah Guthrie on NBC\u2019s Today Show.\n\nNo real attempt to hide it. In fact Stewart is selling book that seemingly documents it.\n\nHe continued, \u201cWell, you meet these characters in my book, and the fact is, in a sense, he\u2019s right. There is a deep state. There is a bureaucracy in our country who has pledged to respect the Constitution, respect the rule of law. And as Director James Comey told me, \u2018Thank goodness for that,\u2019 because they are protecting the Constitution and the people when individuals \u2013 we don\u2019t have a monarch, we don\u2019t have a dictator \u2013 they restrain them from crossing the boundaries of law.\u201d\n\nSo this is the new brainwash: \u201cThe Deep State is necessary as a check and balance on power.\u201d\n\nMy mother had a phrase for things like this: \u201cthe unmitigated gall.\u201d\n\nConsidering the fact that the New York Times, NBC News, and much of the rest of the mainstream press have denied that such a cabal existed it strikes me as both dishonest and hypocritical to now admit the existence of the swamp only to now justify it as some sort of heroic accountability element.\n\nIn making such an admission the rhetoric is wrapped up in patriotic language. Phrases like \u201cprotecting the American people,\u201d and \u201cprotecting the Constitution\u201d roll off the tongue of Stewart-like water off a duck.\n\nThe assumption he makes, and that goes unchallenged by happy-chat-host Guthrie, is that the American people are too stupid to understand what he\u2019s truly admitting.\n\nHe also does what all leftists do: attempt to slime anyone who think differently than him. He claims in essence that this \u201cDeep State\u201d is necessary because America doesn\u2019t have a \u201cmonarchy or a dictator.\u201d\n\nOf course his entire premise is asinine.\n\nHis premise is dishonest.\n\nAnd the flamboyant arrogance he utters it with indicates disdain for anyone with eyes and ears, specifically anyone who disagrees.\n\nStewart, the Times, Guthrie, NBC News, (fill in the blank) and the rest of these journalistic goons genuinely believe they exist above the law. They look down on \u201cthe people\u201d and \u201cthe Constitution\u201d that they are talking about. And while they revile being referred to as \u201cswamp rats,\u201d they have no problem picturing every supporter of the president as some inbred hill folk with missing front teeth and poor grammar.\n\nThe truth is the Deep State, this network of people that were never elected, that exercised unprecedented power grabs, and that harassed the lawfully elected president that the voters of 31 of 50 states stormed into office with, are the opposite of what Stewart claims.\n\nThey may have taken an oath to uphold the Constitution, but they violated it. They may claim to be patriots, but they are traitors. They claim to be working to protect the American people, but they are working against them. They claim to be heroes, but they are criminals.\n\nAnd newsflash to the media, the corrupt cabal, and the tyrannically abusive elitists: you\u2019re not the accountability laid out by the Constitution.\n\nYou see geniuses, turns out the Executive Branch already has accountability in the form of Congress and the Judiciary. Co-equal and empowered to slow things down\u2014per the vote of the people\u2014when the people\u2014deem it necessary.\n\nCongress passes the laws, the executive signs or vetoes, and the judiciary determines their constitutional efficacy. What we do not have any need of is bureaucrats believing they know so much more than the voters.\n\nIt is the height of hubris for the Deep State to now try to paint itself as a victim and simultaneously as heroes. They drummed up a false narrative on everything from Russian hookers to Ukrainian military aid, all in attempts to undo the accountability the people brought to Washington, D.C.\n\nIt\u2019s time to deep six the Deep State, especially now that they admit their own existence.\n\nThe future of the Republic is dependent on it.", "description": "\u201cWhat Trump calls the \u2018deep state\u2019 in the United States .10/13/2019 14:23:02PM EST.", "authors": ["Kevin Mccullough", "Beth Baumann", "Julio Rosas"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/280/b8a2fc66-5fdd-4dc7-8cf5-60d58e7eb599.png", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
