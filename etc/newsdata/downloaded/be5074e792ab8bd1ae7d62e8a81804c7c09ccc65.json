Tonight\u2019s estimated jackpot is \u00a313 million.\n\nTonight\u2019s National Lottery Thunderball winning numbers are: 03, 12, 18, 33, 35 and the Thunderball is 13.\n\nNo one has won tonight\u2019s jackpot.\n\nAndy Carter, Senior Winners\u2019 Advisor at The National Lottery, said: \u201cIt\u2019s great news for thousands of lucky Lotto players after the jackpot rolled down when no-one matched all six main numbers to win the \u2018Must Be Won\u2019 Lotto jackpot tonight. An incredible 110,454 ticket-holders each scooped an amazing \u00a3117, instead of \u00a330, just by matching three numbers.\n\n\u201cOne player who matched five main numbers and the Bonus Ball is now a millionaire after winning \u00a31.3M. All players are urged to check their tickets and claim these fantastic prizes.\n\n\u201cBy buying a ticket for Lotto or any other National Lottery game, every player is helping to raise money for Good Causes. On average, around \u00a330M is raised every week for projects across the UK, both big and small, including funding everything from local community projects to supporting the nation\u2019s athletes.\u201d\n\nThe windfall was enough to have the house and car of your dreams and banish money troubles forever.\n\nAny winner could have been sipping cocktails on an exotic beach plotting how they were going to spend their millions.\n\nThe biggest ever Lotto winner was created in April 2016, when an anonymous player banked \u00a335m in the draw.\n\nIn January 2016, two lucky Lotto ticket-holders walked away with a staggering \u00a333 million each.\n\nThe Lotto results are typically drawn at 7.45pm and the Thunderball is drawn at 8.15pm.", "description": "The winning numbers for Tuesday's National Lottery draw are published here", "authors": ["Bradley Jolly", "Image", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article18847143.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/11_National-Lottery-changes.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
