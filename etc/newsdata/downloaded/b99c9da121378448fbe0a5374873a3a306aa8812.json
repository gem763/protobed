But Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte will now have to manage three parties instead of two, underscoring Italy\u2019s continuing political flux.\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 split exemplifies the struggles of Europe\u2019s mainstream political parties, especially on the center-left, to define their identity and rebuild their shrunken voter base in an era of rising antiestablishment sentiment.\n\nThe Democrats have been involved in most of Italy\u2019s revolving governments this past decade but have struggled to overcome the country\u2019s economic stagnation. Meanwhile popular discontent with poorly controlled immigration and pressure from the European Union for fiscal retrenchment have fueled a steady rise in voter support for the nationalist right, led by Matteo Salvini\u2019s League party.\n\nPersonal rivalries and ambitions have also contributed to the Democrats\u2019 split. Mr. Renzi\u2019s centrist faction lost control of the party leadership earlier this year to the more left-leaning Nicola Zingaretti.\n\nMr. Renzi showed he is still a key power-broker in Rome in August when he played a leading role in orchestrating the new governing coalition between the Democrats and the 5 Star Movement.\n\nBy forming his own party, Mr. Renzi is ensuring that the government will continue to rely on his support, boosting his personal influence.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the new party will make much of an impact with voters, however. Mr. Renzi was briefly a popular prime minister five years ago, but public sentiment turned against him as he struggled to deliver promised overhauls of the country.\n\nThe new governing alliance, which took office earlier this month, has little in common apart from a shared desire to avoid snap elections, which opinion polls suggest Mr. Salvini\u2019s League would win.\n\nMr. Conte, a nonparty premier close to the 5 Star, will now need to manage a more diverse coalition, whose different components may disagree on many matters.\n\nIt is unclear how many Democratic Party lawmakers will join Mr. Renzi\u2019s new party.\n\n\u201cWhile Renzi is unlikely to bring down the government in the shortterm, the immediate consequence of his move is that policymaking will become more complicated, as the government will have to meet the demands of another political party to stay afloat,\u201d said Wolfango Piccoli, co-president of political-risk consulting firm Teneo.\n\nWrite to Giovanni Legorano at giovanni.legorano@wsj.com", "description": "Italy\u2019s new government suffered its first setback, as the country\u2019s center-left party split in two, complicating life for an already unwieldy governing coalition.", "authors": ["Giovanni Legorano", "Giovanni.Legorano Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107610/social", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
