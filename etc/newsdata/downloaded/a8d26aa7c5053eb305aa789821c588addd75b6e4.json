They were both neck-to-neck as recently as June.\n\nAfter parliament refused Johnson his third demand for an election on Monday, the country looks set towards a December election after Johnson's bet on breaking the Brexit deadlock with an early vote gained support from opposition parties\n\n\n\n\n\nLESS ATTRACTIVE\n\nAn election has also taken some of the wind out of the pound's rally as investors braced for a multitude of scenarios.\n\nOn Tuesday, the pound was trading around $1.2857, about 1% below a five-month high of above $1.30 hit last week. Against the euro, the British currency was holding below a five-month high versus the euro.\n\n\"I don't see immediately that the risk-reward ratio has shifted in favour of the pound and most of the longer term players are also adopting a similar wait-and-see approach,\" said Ugo Lancioni, head of global currency at Neuberger Berman.\n\nBelow the relative calm in the cash markets, traders are bracing for more volatility around the election results with two-month and three-month volatility gauges for the pound holding firm compared to a drop in one-month volatility.\n\nSpreads between two-month and one-month implied volatility gauges for the pound, an indicator of perceived swings in the British currency has widened to its highest levels in six weeks indicating traders were expecting more volatility after the election than over the next one-month period.\n\n\n\n\n\nNOT RULING OUT\n\nAn election also potentially throws up a no-deal Brexit scenario, a risk which is now almost priced out of the market.\n\nIn its latest updated forecasts, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs puts the risk of a no-deal Brexit at a low 5% and assigns a 75% probability of a deal followed by the likelihood of 20% for Britain opting to stay within the European Union.\n\nHowever, Ross Hutchison, a rates fund manager at Aberdeen Standard Investments said two potential scenarios where a no-deal Brexit can be back on the table is if a Conservative Party win emboldens some of the hardline factions in the party to withdraw support for the current withdrawal bill before the next extension deadline at end-January 2020.\n\nA second scenario would be if a possible victory for the opposition parties including the Labour and the Liberal Democrat parties encourages them to hold a second referendum where a majority might yet again vote to leave the European Union.\n\n\"Neither of these cases are \u2018base case\u2019 \u2013 but no deal cannot be totally ruled out,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Saikat Chatterjee, Olga Cotaga, Dhara Ranasinghe and Elisabeth Howcroft; Editing by Kirsten Donovan and Angus MacSwan)", "description": "Sterling has gained more than 5 percent over the last three weeks against the greenback and stocks rallied as fears of Britain crashing out of the European Union faded after European policymakers agreed on a third extension until end-January.
