The other, also a teen, was arrested in Bern. All of the underage suspects will be tried by the ministries for minors in both Bern and Winterthur, while the MPC will prosecute the adults.\n\nAll 11 suspects are thought to be supporters of either Islamic State or al-Qaeda and are also facing charges of participation in a criminal organisation.\n\nSwitzerland to Deport Terrorists Even if They Face Death Penalty at Home https://t.co/zUiCYjhjcA \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 24, 2019\n\nOne of the suspects, a 21-year-old Swiss national, had travelled to Syria in 2014 and returned to Switzerland a year later. In February he was found guilty of going to territory controlled by a terrorist organisation and sentenced to 11 months in prison but continued to spread propaganda for the Islamic State.\n\nAround 66 individuals are thought to be at serious risk of participating in terrorist activity in Switzerland, according to a report released in May by the Confederation Intelligence Service (SRC).\n\nWinterthur, one of the areas in which some suspects were arrested, has been known as a hotspot for Islamic extremism for years. In 2015, an Islamic State cell was thought to operate in the notorious An\u2019Nur mosque with four individuals linked to the mosque having travelled to Syria.\n\nAn imam linked to the mosque was arrested a year later after being accused of inciting violence against non-Muslims during his sermons. Police said the imam, who was originally from Ethiopia, had called on followers to both denounce and murder Muslims who refused to take part in prayer.", "description": "A large-scale anti-terror raid in three cantons across Swizterland has led to the arrest of eleven suspected jihadists including five minors.", "authors": ["Chris Tomlinson"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/11/rsz_gettyimages-614887146.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
