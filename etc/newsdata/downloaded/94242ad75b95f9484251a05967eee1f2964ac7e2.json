Marco Rubio called for the U.S. government to launch an investigation into TikTok, the Chinese-owned social media app that\u2019s become the latest teen obsession, over concerns that it\u2019s censoring content to placate Beijing\u2019s government.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nIn a letter to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, the Florida Republican asked the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) to launch a broad review of TikTok\u2019s acquisition of Musical.ly over national security concerns. In 2017, Bytedance, the parent company of TikTok, purchased Musical.ly Inc., the popular lip-syncing video app that already had a rabid fan base in the U.S. The two apps then merged together; since then, they\u2019ve amassed a staggering 1 billion users worldwide.\n\n\u201cThere continues to be ample and growing evidence that TikTok\u2019s platform for Western markets, including those in the U.S., is censoring content that is not in line with the Chinese government and Communist Party directs,\u201d Rubio wrote in the letter.\n\nHe was seemingly referencing a report in The Guardian last month, which outlined how TikTok censors videos that mention Tiananmen Square, Tibetan independence or the banned religious group Falun Gong \u2014 and how the app tries to advance Chinese foreign policy aims.\n\nIn a statement to FOX Business, a TikTok spokesperson said the company's content and moderation policies are led by its U.S.-based team and not \"influenced by any foreign government.\"\n\n\"The Chinese government does not request that TikTok censor content, and would not have jurisdiction regardless, as TikTok does not operate there,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nThe Treasury Department also did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn a series of tweets on Wednesday, Rubio called on the Trump administration to \u201cfully enforce anti-boycott laws that prohibit any U.S. person \u2014 including U.S. subsidiaries of Chinese companies from complying with foreign boycotts seeking to coerce U.S. companies to conform with #China\u2019s government views.\u201d\n\nRubio\u2019s call follows unprecedented pressure from China on American companies, including the NBA and gaming company Activision Blizzard, to fall in line with the communist government\u2019s stance on the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong.\n\nThe protests, now in their 18th week, began earlier this summer over a now-shelved bill that would have allowed the extradition of suspected criminals from Hong Kong to mainland China, where the courts are controlled by the Communist Party. They\u2019ve since morphed to reflect broader calls for reform.\n\n\u201cTV networks,airlines,hotel chains,retailers & Hollywood already self censor,\u201d Rubio said in a separate tweet. \u201cNow private citizens risk losing their jobs if they offend China.\u201d\n\nRubio\u2019s criticism of TikTok, and by extension the Chinese government, comes amid inflamed U.S.-China trade tensions. Top diplomats, including Mnuchin, are meeting in Washington, D.C. on Thursday to continue negotiations.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "TikTok has more than 1 billion users worldwide.", "authors": ["Megan Henney"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/02/0/0/Marco-Rubio.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
