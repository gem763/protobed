We are all seemingly obsessed with house prices, the slightest increase in the monthly cost of Netflix but God forbid ever discussing how much you earn. This behavioural oddity is one that has been benefiting employers \u2013 unwittingly or not \u2013 for decades. But then gender pay gap reporting was introduced and all our problems were solved! Hurrah!\n\nNot so, of course, not at all so.\n\nTake the case of Stacey Macken, a banker, who won a pay discrimination case last month after discovering that her employer, French banking group BNP Paribas, hired a male colleague into a role with the same title and responsibilities but on a base salary of \u00a340,000 more than Macken\u2019s \u00a3120,000. Macken\u2019s manager had decided to deem her junior despite having more relevant experience than her male colleague. Furthermore, over the course of a five year period, that male colleague earned \u00a3237,000 in bonuses compared with Macken\u2019s \u00a333,000.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

In March this year, the US Women\u2019s national soccer team launched legal action against the US Soccer Federation (USSF) \u2013 just weeks before playing in the Women\u2019s World Cup in France. Despite winning the Women\u2019s World Cup three times and their place as one of the best women\u2019s football teams in the world, according to the lawsuit filed in Los Angeles, \u201cthe female players have been consistently paid less money than their male counterparts. This is true even though their performance has been superior to that of the male players, with the female players, in contrast to male players, becoming world champions.\u201d The men\u2019s team, on the other hand, reached the quarter-finals in the 2002 Men\u2019s World Cup and their best result \u2013 3rd place \u2013 was achieved in 1930.\n\nEven this week alone, there have been reports of TfL and one of the UK\u2019s top law firms still paying women less than men \u2013 in the case of the latter, the gender pay gap had grown.\n\nSo it is little wonder that the #MeTooPay campaign was launched this week by a coalition of senior women from sectors such as finance, education, media and big pharma. The story of Macken\u2019s experience spurred the likes of ex-TalkTalk boss Lady Dido Harding and former Royal Mail chief executive Dame Moya Greene into taking action. The campaign\u2019s website currently consists of just one page but the aim is to create what they call \u201ca hub for action...a place to share good and bad policies in action.\u201d\n\nThe initiative sounds great, at least the intention does (details remain scant at this stage). But the #MeTooPay campaign in isolation, indeed, women in isolation, won\u2019t fix this problem. If this particular issue is seen as one that women alone should fix \u2013 it will never, ever get resolved. How could it? Men still occupy the majority of senior positions in industry after industry \u2013 with Alison Cooper\u2019s resignation this week as chief executive of tobacco giant Imperial Brands, the total number of female FTSE 100 CEOs has reduced to just four. While the tally of FTSE 100 female CEOs will reclaim the truly dizzying heights of five with Alison Rose\u2019s assumption of the top job in RBS next month, men still very much hold the keys to the kingdom in terms of leadership and career success.\n\nOnce men accept that the gender pay gap still exists, that their attitudes and behaviours in hiring need scrutiny and, at times, revision, we will, hopefully, begin to edge towards equilibrium in our pay packets.", "description": "Money: it\u2019s a thorny subject, a sticky wicket.
