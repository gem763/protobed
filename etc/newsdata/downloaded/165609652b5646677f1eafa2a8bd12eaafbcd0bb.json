Goodwin followed with a two-run homer that ruined a quality start by White Sox pitcher Lucas Giolito.\n\nGoodwin had replaced Trout in the fifth inning. Trout left the game with right toe discomfort.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not easy. You know what you miss whenever Mike is not in the lineup,\u201d Goodwin said. \u201cIt brings everything to the table. It\u2019s not really for me to fill his shoes, but it\u2019s just go out and do what I\u2019m supposed to do, play my game, produce.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been in pretty much a similar situation all year, so I can\u2019t say I haven\u2019t had a lot opportunities to prepare for it. Whenever the chance presents itself, then just got to take advantage.\u201d\n\nGoodwin has been reliable for the Angels all season.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s come up huge for us a number of times,\u201d Angels manager Brad Ausmus said. \u201cHe\u2019s done an outstanding job for us. This is a guy we picked up two days before the season started and he\u2019s become an intricate part of our team both offensively and defensively.\u201d\n\nDespite the injury, Trout was able to appreciate the late-inning heroics.\n\n\u201cBrad (Ausmus) picked the right guy,\u201d Trout said.\n\nOn the first pitch in the ninth inning, Upton hit his 12th homer of the season, off closer Alex Colom\u00e9 (4-3), to give the Angels the lead.\n\nAngels reliever Hansel Robles pitched a perfect final two innings for the win and improved to 5-0.\n\nLuis Rengifo led off the third with his seventh homer of the season for the Angels, who bounced back after blowing a five-run lead in the seventh inning against Oakland on Thursday night.\n\nThe White Sox have lost nine of 11.\n\nTim Anderson, who was 2 for 4, is bidding to become the first White Sox player to win the AL batting title since Frank Thomas in 1997. Anderson entered the game with a one-point lead over DJ LeMahieu. Anderson moved increased his average to .333. LeMahieu was hitless in three at-bats, dropping his average to .329.\n\n\u201cIt would be a huge accomplishment. I mean, we made it this far, so why not give it a shot? I just got to keep being consistent and having fun with it and let the rest take care of itself,\u201d Anderson said.\n\nGiolito allowed two runs on three hits in seven innings, but didn\u2019t figure in the decision. He struck out six and walked one. Giolito has 216 strikeouts this, the third-most in a season for the White Sox behind Chris Sale and Ed Walsh.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy about tonight because I didn\u2019t feel my best. I felt out of sync, but I was able to kind of battle and grind through it and make the adjustments to turn it into a quality start,\u201d Giolito said.\n\nAnderson and Yo\u00e1n Moncada hit back-to-back singles off Angels starter Dillion Peters in the first inning, and Jos\u00e9 Abreu followed with an RBI double. Moncada scored on Eloy Jim\u00e9nez\u2019s groundout, giving the White Sox a 2-0 lead.\n\nAfter Peters allowed a leadoff walk to Adam Engel in the fifth, Anderson extended Chicago\u2019s lead to 4-1 with his 16th home run of the season. Anderson watched from just outside the batter\u2019s box as the ball flew over the left-field fence.\n\nPeters allowed four runs on six hits 4 1/3 innings, striking out three and walking three.\n\nShohei Ohtani tripled and scored in the seventh inning.\n\nThe White Sox played without manager Rick Renteria, who had surgery Friday to repair the rotator cuff in his right shoulder. Bench coach Joe McEwing managed in Renteria\u2019s absence. Renteria is expected to miss the series and return Tuesday, when the White Sox host the Royals for a three-game set.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s doing well, he\u2019s doing really well. Everything went according to plan. He\u2019s recovering now. Our thoughts and prayers were there. Making sure everything went well. They took good care of him. He\u2019s coming out of it now and resting well,\u201d McEwing said before the game.\n\nTROUT UPDATE\n\nTrout is listed as day-to-day. \u201cI\u2019ve been dealing with it for a little bit now. I\u2019ve been trying to play through it, just really sore,\u201d Trout said. \u201cI was grinding through it in the third and fourth inning and it just got to the point where it affected how I was running.\u201d Trout said he will try to play on Saturday.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nAngels: Ohtani (Tommy John surgery) will not throw this week as had been scheduled. He remains available as a hitter. He has not pitched this season. \u2026 INF Tommy La Stella (broken right tibia) took part in live batting practice in Anaheim on Thursday. He could return to the active roster next week. \u2026 1B Albert Pujols was out of the starting lineup on Friday because of an illness. \u201cHe came out of the game sick (at Oakland on Thursday night). He was still sick during the night. We can use him to pinch-hit, but we don\u2019t want him standing out there the whole game,\u201d Angels manager Brad Ausmus said.\n\nWhite Sox: INF/OF Luery Garc\u00eda will miss the entire series against the Angels as he mourns the death of his grandmother. Garcia returned to his native Santiago, in the Dominican Republic, in the wake of his grandmother\u2019s death.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nAngels: LHP Andrew Heaney (3-4) is the scheduled starter for the Angels on Saturday. In four career starts against the White Sox, Heaney is 2-0 with a 2.10 ERA.\n\nWhite Sox: RHP Dylan Covey, who was recalled from Triple-A Charlotte on Tuesday, is scheduled to start Saturday. Covey is 1-6 with a 7.17 in 10 starts for the White Sox.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Brian Goodwin left his mark on a game, just as Mike Trout has done so often for the Los Angeles Angels.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Patrick Rose"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/06/angels_white_sox_baseball_74368_c0-265-6336-3959_s1770x1032.jpg?7ad3f755c6fba9bf0bf33fbac155ebd284a81998", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
