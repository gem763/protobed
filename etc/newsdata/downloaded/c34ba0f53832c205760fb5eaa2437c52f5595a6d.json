And we'll be no different from them in that respect.'\n\nNew Zealand reacted to that November loss to Ireland at the Aviva Stadium by drawing up blueprints for a backline reshuffle.\n\nHead coach Hansen has paired Richie Mo'unga at fly-half with Beauden Barrett at full-back, a twin playmaking combination that has already helped the All Blacks see off South Africa 23-13 in the pool stages.\n\nAll Blacks boss Steve Hansen vowed to lay false traps for Ireland head coach Joe Schmidt\n\nNew Zealand are bidding for an unprecedented third successive World Cup triumph, with the All Blacks firm favourites with the bookies to prevail in Tokyo on Saturday.\n\nWhen quizzed on the All Blacks' dual playmaking options, Easterby insisted Ireland cannot afford to be fixated with one aspect of their supreme all-court approach.\n\n'I guess every team gets to a point where they must keep evolving and try to stay ahead of their opposition, and we're no different either,' said Easterby.\n\n'They have so many threats across the park and can play in a number of different styles according to their personnel.\n\n'You cannot switch off for a moment against them, and that's part of the challenge.'\n\nWelsh referee Nigel Owens will take charge of the encounter.\n\nHansen paired Richie Mo'unga (L) with Beauden Barrett (R) as a result of the defeat to Ireland\n\n'I think it's a good appointment, I think we're familiar with him, so are the All Blacks,' said Easterby.\n\n'He does a lot of Rugby Championship games, he gets a lot of coverage there.\n\n'So I think he's good, a good appointment, and both camps will be pretty happy to see Nigel out in the middle.\n\n'He's got a good way about him, he'll allow the game to flow but will also be across all the set-piece work and I think he'll be a good man to have in the middle.'", "description": "All Blacks boss Steve Hansen lit the fuse on a potentially explosive week on Monday by vowing to lay false traps for Ireland's master tactician and head coach Joe Schmidt.", "authors": ["Nick Purewal"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/09/19730686-0-image-a-20_1571129013726.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
