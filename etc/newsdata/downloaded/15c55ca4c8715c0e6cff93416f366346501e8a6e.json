Commissioner Adam Silver has said he sees his job as protecting player\u2019s free speech. When President Trump said he wouldn\u2019t invite the 2018 NBA champion to the White House, Silver boasted of the long tradition of activism in the NBA. \u201cI\u2019m proud of the fact that in this league our players, our coaches, our owners, feel comfortable expressing their political points of view,\u201d he said.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s easy for the NBA to be all sanctimonious about speech when it means a star player calling an unpopular American president a \u201cbum.\u201d But when it comes to a GM having the temerity to tweet \u201cFight for Freedom,\u201d suddenly Silver cowers, and a U.S. sports league has to impose totalitarian China\u2019s censorship rules on one of its executives.\n\nSince, clearly the NBA only values money, above all else, if you care about freedom and are inscenced by this decision, then there is only one way to send a message to them \u2014 by denying them any of yours.", "description": "", "authors": ["Philip Klein", "Washingtonexaminer.Com Opinion Stand-For-Freedom-Boycott-The-Nba"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
