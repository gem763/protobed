The agency sent letters to roughly 400 applicants that told them the requests would not be processed and that they should depart the country within 33 days.\n\nDemocrats and pro-migrant advocates blasted the move. A House Oversight subcommittee held a hearing on the issue last week that featured testimony from two undocumented immigrants with serious medical conditions. Both witnesses had received letters informing them their deferred action requests would not be considered.\n\n\u201cIt should not take an emergency hearing by Congress \u2014 and threats for more \u2014 to force the Trump administration to do the right thing,\u201d said Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) in a written statement. \u201cOur committee will continue to seek answers about who was responsible for this cruel policy in the first place.\u201d\n\nAn internal USCIS memo obtained by POLITICO and published last week showed that the agency urged McAleenan to rescind its deferred action authority altogether.\n\nThe memo was prepared by USCIS Policy and Strategy Chief Kathy Nuebel Kovarik for a Sept. 9 meeting to be led by acting USCIS Director Ken Cuccinelli. In the document, Nuebel Kovarik wrote that if McAleenan declined to remove the authority altogether, he should at least keep the current guidance halting any future requests for relief.\n\nThis article tagged under: Employment & Immigration", "description": "The decision reverses an earlier move by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to put a freeze on the requests, known as \u201cdeferred action.\u201d", "authors": ["Ted Hesson"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/fd/c5/5e33c98e4ac7b263820419225805/19919-kevin-mcaleenan-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
