The Interior Ministry said the fire was under control by early afternoon, about 12 hours after it broke out, but not yet extinguished.\n\nThe Lubrizol plant in the medieval city of Rouen is among the highest-risk industrial sites in Europe, part of a system called Seveso that requires such facilities to have additional security measures because they handle dangerous substances.\n\nFrench Interior Minister Christophe Castaner rushed to the site. He said on RTL radio that \"there is no element that could lead us to believe that the smoke is dangerous,\" but authorities are taking precautionary measures and carrying out air quality tests as around 200 firefighters worked to stop the blaze.\n\nThe administration for the Seine-Maritime region urged people to avoid non-essential travel in the area after the fire alarm rang at the Lubrizol plant in Rouen early Thursday. Residents in nearby nursing homes were confined.\n\nAuthorities closed schools in 11 surrounding towns and asked residents within a 500-meter (550-yard) perimeter to stay indoors.\n\nThe fire spread to two neighboring companies, according to the administration for the Nord region. It warned of a \"strong, nauseating odor\" produced by the smoke but said \"no heightened toxicity\" was immediately measured in the air.\n\nThe plant produces additives for lubricants and paint, and pledges on its website \"to lead all activities in full security for people and goods while preserving the natural environment.\" The company didn't comment on the fire.\n\nImages showed bursts of orange flames and the sounds of repeated explosions from the plant overnight. The site was still spewing huge plumes of black smoke after dawn, with bursts of flames still visible as sirens sounded over and over.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
