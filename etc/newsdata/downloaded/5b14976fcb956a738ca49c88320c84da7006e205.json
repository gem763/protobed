That message echoes from the halls of the Capitol -- where Reps. JIM JORDAN, MARK MEADOWS and company say it on repeat -- to the president\u2019s Twitter account to Secretary of State MIKE POMPEO\u2019S plane, where he griped about it to us last week.\n\nIT\u2019S ALSO PRETTY SAFE TO SAY THAT this is a ploy, and a play for public sympathy. Many of the Republicans involved in these goofball antics -- busting into a secure facility, and even making a phone call from inside of it -- will privately concede that. It\u2019s a fine way for a quick headline, a nice way to appease President DONALD TRUMP, and for the slice of the electorate that\u2019s overly concerned about process, perhaps this is a useful tool.\n\nBUT REPUBLICANS WILL SOON FACE a new reality: The impeachment process will move to a more public phase. And at that point, their stand-outside-a-closed-door-for-cameras shtick will no longer work.\n\nSO, WHAT\u2019S NEXT? It\u2019s a bit tough to predict, because we don\u2019t know what the process will look like. There are a bunch of decisions Democrats have to make before TRUMP\u2019S defenders figure out how to best try to defend the president. For example, at this moment, there are four committees involved in impeachment. How do Democrats decide which one/ones get to prosecute the case?\n\nWE SPOKE TO some of the top Republicans in the House to see how they view the next stage of the fight.\n\n-- WITNESSES: REPUBLICANS have wanted to issue subpoenas in closed hearings, and they say when the process goes public, they want to be able to present their side of the case on behalf of the president. MEADOWS (R-N.C.): \u201cI think if it\u2019s fair to Trump it would be the ability to have other witnesses give conflicting or counter testimony, and I\u2019d probably use the word conflicting rather than cross-examining.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve found with six witnesses so far is that there are six different opinions on what happened and why it happened and it\u2019s probably better to view that through the lens of journalists and the American people rather than a partisan lens that wants to see a guilty or acquittal just based on politics.\u201d\n\n-- IN THE DARK \u2026 We reminded Rep. LEE ZELDIN (R-N.Y.) that a few dozen Republicans are present at each deposition. He made this point about those who are not: \u201cI still appreciate and understand the frustration of [a] member who is in the dark who is getting all these questions substantively from constituents and local media and they have no idea how to answer those questions because they don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening behind closed doors.\u201d\n\n-- FWIW: Zeldin says he would like all the transcripts released to the public at this point. He says Democrats are moving in the other direction, and aides are monitoring lawmakers if they ask to review the material in the SCIF.\n\nBUT HERE\u2019S THE KEY QUOTE, courtesy of MEADOWS: \u201cDemocrats are going to get a report from the Democrats, Republicans are going to get a report from Republicans. And 435 members are going to have to make a decision on a very weighty issue based on a report that comes really through two or three staffers writing a report through each side. That\u2019s problematic. But elections have consequences. And so would I expect there to be complaints from the Democrats if they were in the minority? Probably.\u201d\n\n-- FOR THE RECORD: It seems somewhat newsy that Republicans will write their own impeachment takeaway report.\n\nBTW \u2026 45 REPUBLICANS -- nearly a quarter of the House Republican Conference -- have access to the depositions, including many among the top ranks of the caucus.\n\nTHE FOLLOWING REPUBLICANS HAVE ACCESS to all of the closed depositions and hearings: House Minority Leader KEVIN MCCARTHY, MEADOWS, House Intelligence Chairman DEVIN NUNES (R-Calif.), Rep. JOHN RATCLIFFE (R-Texas), Rep. SCOTT PERRY (R-Pa.), ZELDIN and Rep. GREG PENCE (R-Ind.), the VP\u2019s brother.\n\n-- NYT ED BOARD: \u201cWhy Did Republicans Storm the Capitol?

Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), the son of sharecroppers who rose to become one of the Democratic Party's most influential figures at a tumultuous time in American politics. The late Oversight Committee chairman \u2014 who represented his majority-black Baltimore district in the House for two decades \u2014 will become the first African American lawmaker to lie in state in the Capitol, an honor bestowed to only a few dozen statesmen, presidents and military leaders throughout U.S. history.\n\n\u201cThousands of visitors are expected to stream through the Capitol on Thursday to pay their final respects to Cummings, who died Oct. 17 at age 68. Earlier in the day, Cumming's casket will lie in state about 75 feet away from a statute of another civil rights icon, Rosa Parks, and just steps away from the bust of the former Confederate president Jefferson Davis \u2014 a reminder of Washington's troubled history on race relations, which Cummings himself battled throughout his life.\u201d POLITICO\n\nSPEAKING AT CUMMINGS\u2019 FUNERAL FRIDAY IN BALTIMORE: Barack Obama, Bill and Hillary Clinton, and Nancy Pelosi.\n\nDAILY RUDY -- \u201cRudy Giuliani is looking for a defense attorney, sources say,\u201d by CNN\u2019s Erica Orden, Katelyn Polantz and Evan Perez: \u201cRudy Giuliani has been approaching defense attorneys for possible representation, according to three sources familiar with the matter. The move by Giuliani, who is President Donald Trump's personal attorney, is notable because last week he said he would not be seeking a new lawyer unless he felt one was needed. His previous lawyer, John Sale, was helping him deal with congressional inquiries.\u201d CNN\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

At another time, they convinced a Florida-based businessman to loan them $100,000 so they could connect him with Giuliani and other prominent conservatives. And in a third instance, they attempted to influence the management board of a Ukrainian gas company.\u201d CNN\n\nA message from Google: Searches on Google for \u201cdrug drop off near me\u201d or \u201cmedication disposal near me\u201d now show permanent drop-off locations near you on Google Maps.\n\nFOR YOUR RADAR -- \u201cNorth Korea urges U.S. to act wisely through year-end deadline,\u201d by AP\u2019s Kim Tong-Hyung in Seoul, South Korea: \u201cNorth Korea on Thursday accused U.S. officials of maintaining hostility against Pyongyang despite a \u2018special\u2019 relationship between leader Kim Jong Un and President Donald Trump and urged Washington to act \u2018wisely\u2019 through the end of the year.\n\n\u201cThe statement issued by Foreign Ministry adviser Kim Kye Gwan was clearly referring to an end-of-year deadline set by Kim Jong Un for the Trump administration to offer mutually acceptable terms for a deal to salvage their diplomacy.\n\n\u201cNuclear negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang have faltered after the collapse of a February summit between Kim Jong Un and Trump where the U.S. side rejected North Korean demands for broad sanctions relief in exchange for a piecemeal deal toward partially surrendering its nuclear capabilities.\u201d AP\n\nJOHN BRESNAHAN: \u201cRep. Katie Hill investigated over allegations of improper relationship with staffer\u201d: \u201cThe House Ethics Committee announced Wednesday it has launched an investigation into Democratic Rep. Katie Hill following allegations she engaged in an improper sexual relationship with a male congressional staffer.\n\n\u201cThe California Democrat denied that allegation in a statement to POLITICO on Tuesday, and she blamed the controversy on an \u2018abusive husband\u2019 whom she is in the midst of divorcing.\n\n\u201cHowever, in a letter to her constituents sent out just before the Ethics Committee announcement, Hill admitted to having an \u2018inappropriate\u2019 relationship with a female campaign staffer during her run for Congress in 2018. Hill apologized for the relationship, which the freshman lawmaker said occurred \u2018despite my better judgment.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018During the final tumultuous years of my abusive marriage, I became involved in a relationship with someone on my campaign,\u2019 Hill said in her letter. \u2018I know that even a consensual relationship with a subordinate is inappropriate, but I still allowed it to happen despite my better judgment. For that I apologize. I wish nothing but the best for her and hope everyone respects her privacy in this difficult time.\u2019\u201d POLITICO\n\nTRUMP\u2019S THURSDAY -- The president will participate in a Diwali ceremonial lighting of the diya at 1:45 p.m. in the Oval Office.

Instead, the group spent most of the three-hour discussion talking about how to navigate the insistence from Trump and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, for a probe and how to avoid becoming entangled in the American elections, according to three people familiar with the details of the meeting.\u201d AP\n\nICYMI -- \u201cGiuliani associates plead not guilty in campaign finance case,\u201d by Josh Gerstein: \u201cTwo associates of President Donald Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani entered not guilty pleas Wednesday to a federal indictment accusing them of funneling hundreds of thousands of dollars in foreign money into U.S. elections, including a pro-Trump super PAC.\n\n\u201cThe pleas came as the two men, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, made their first court appearance in Manhattan following their arrest earlier this month at Dulles Airport near Washington as they attempted to board a flight for Vienna.\n\n\u201cDuring the hearing, one of Parnas\u2019 lawyers appeared to warn prosecutors that the case could be a challenging one for them because of complex issues of attorney-client privilege and even executive privilege, since Parnas claims to have been working with Giuliani as he worked for Trump.\u201d POLITICO\n\n-- NYT: \u201cAs Russian Money Poured Into Cannabis, Giuliani Allies Scrambled to Partake\u201d\n\nUPCOMING IMPEACHMENT TESTIMONY -- Saturday: Philip Reeker, acting assistant secretary of State for European and Eurasian affairs; Monday: Charles Kupperman, former deputy national security adviser; Thursday: Timothy Morrison, NSC senior director for Europe and Russia.\n\nTHE DREAM THAT WILL NEVER DIE -- Former Hillary Clinton aide Philippe Reines on Tucker Carlson\u2019s show Wednesday night \u2026 CARLSON: \u201cShe\u2019s not -- she hasn\u2019t foreclosed the possibility, I guess.\u201d REINES: \u201cNo, she has not.\u201d \u2026 Reines rating the odds of a Clinton run in 2020 to POLITICO Magazine in October 2018: \u201cIt\u2019s somewhere between highly unlikely and zero, but it\u2019s not zero.\u201d (h/t Annie Karni)\n\nA message from Google: Find out where you can properly dispose of unused prescription drugs.\n\nWHAT RUDY IS READING -- \u201cHunter Biden\u2019s Name Was Used as Selling Point in Fraudulent Bond Scheme,\u201d by WSJ\u2019s Dave Michaels and Theo Francis: \u201cHunter Biden\u2019s work in Ukraine and China has attracted criticism from President Trump and other Republicans.
