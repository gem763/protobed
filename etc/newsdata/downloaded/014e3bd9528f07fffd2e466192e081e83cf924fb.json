However, one thing is for sure. Hundreds apply and are whittled down to a few entrepreneurs who get a chance to pitch or are invested in by the sharks.\n\nHowever, here\u2019s the point: The sharks decide who gets a chance.\n\nResearch and fact-checking seven years of Shark Tank deals Forbes.com reveals some interesting stats. About 70% of the businesses did not get the exact deal made on the TV show. In most cases, more due diligence investigations after the show changed things before any contract was signed. Having a shark deal fall through is not death to the business, in fact, a majority of companies who pitched were still operating after the TV show.\n\n\u201cGood grades\u201d in business school are decided by the teacher\u2019s grade, not the market. Both shark tank events and business classes can be helpful, but neither is essential for business startup success! Yes, most businesses fail within the first five years, but real entrepreneurs either are successful, or they learn and turn their many failures into successes. Most millionaires fail four to five businesses before becoming a millionaire,[1] but let\u2019s not forget that lots of businesses are successful in the marketplace without ever getting good grades in school or being involved with a shark tank. Neither Steve Jobs nor Bill Gates ever finished college and became billionaires.\n\nProv 20:5 (AMP) A plan (motive, wise counsel) in the heart of a man is like water in a deep well, But a man of understanding draws it out.\n\nBusiness plan competitions are not much better. These competitions ask businesses to pitch their idea for the first cut, and then a select few are allowed to pitch for a small investment to the winner(s). Not all of the \u201csharks\u201d are knowledgeable enough to make a decision or give advice about what works and what does not, especially when it comes to industries with which they're unfamiliar. That\u2019s why, in reality, every entrepreneur needs many advisors with much feedback.\n\nProv 15:22 (AMP) Without consultation and wise advice, plans are frustrated, But with many counselors they are established and succeed.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s a better idea than shark tanks, business schools, and business plan competitions. Writing my first book, How to Start a Business: Mac Version, I was always in front of my intended readers at Apple daily, answering their questions and then going home to write evergreen business content from what I had encountered. THE best approach for any startup business is to get in front of their intended clients. A church or community can broaden this approach for potential entrepreneurs: \u201cCrowdfunding\u201d within a community of commerce. \u201cCrowdfunding\u201d new ideas give entrepreneurial businesses a chance to have their ideas in front of their customer\u2019s eyes with the support and encouragement from their church and community.\n\nTwo ideas come to mind. First, a local business community or chamber of commerce can start a \u201cStartup Limelight\u201d campaign (the limelight idea coming from the intense stage lighting used in theater/music halls during the early 1800s). A community \u201cshines the light\u201d on new ideas within the local area: 1) Local businesses which make room in their retail shelf space for an entrepreneur\u2019s \u201cStartup Limelight\u201d of new products or services to try out, similar to major chains having a \u201cFor Limited Time Only\u201d offer for new products. The church or community could do the same for any campaign of new products; 2) Each new product has the potential to bring in new customers to the business that might not otherwise have visited the supporting company; 3) Each new product draws a crowd, even a new group, that otherwise would not have ventured out or visited the local business. Business owners, entrepreneurs, and customers win.\n\nThe local business/community/church or chamber of commerce is now: 1) Marketing the local business \u201csponsorship\u201d of the new entrepreneur\u2019s product or service; 2) Marketing the new entrepreneurs who get a chance to do real-time market research from feedback and if sales are high, increase the bottom line of the local business \u201csponsoring\u201d them; 3) Marketing entrepreneurialism so more people are encouraged to become entrepreneurs because more companies are supporting new ideas to improve people\u2019s lives. Imagine a small or urban town, or a local church (hint, hint!) having a full marketing and a \u201cStartup Limelight\u201d campaign where lots of local businesses have a new product to showcase from the community. The key with this idea has multiple businesses \u201copt-in\u201d to this \u201cStartup Limelight\u201d campaign, so it sparks a local community effort to support and become involved.\n\nSecond, rather than having many businesses or locations participating and spreading out among others with the new products, you can have one site wholly devoted to a \u201cStartup Limelight\u201d campaign of new products and services for a weekend. Have a pop-up event or trade show in a single location which has plenty of space for all and could be used to draw in others. A local church could involve its members and their community or the local civic center bringing everyone in from around the area to participate.\n\nA church could have a trade show where congregant member startups could showcase their new products and services. Then the church could have a potluck Saturday/Sunday dinner where the congregation and visitors sit down at tables with each startup entrepreneur and learn about their startup story. Imagine parents hearing how fulfilling it is about how they apply their God-given talents and spiritual gifts in the marketplace and wanting to start a side gig. Then these inquisitive parents could involve their kids who show an interest in participating in a home business. It now becomes a whole family affair with the kids getting a part of the profits by working to earn their own money in business. Imagine kids making money from their parents and saving up for their car, college education, or investing in their own startup business. Their entrepreneurial kids now are steps ahead of their peers in the marketplace, learning about product, money, customer service and loyalty, marketing, and sales.\n\nAs some in the startup community, erroneously states, \u201cGo BIG or go home.\u201d Sorry, but a vast majority of businesses rarely \u201cgo big,\u201d they go to work! Every day is slugging it out, serving their customers and working at making a living, and in the long term creating wealth for themselves and their community. Let\u2019s get this done.\n\nCall me if you need help to go to work!", "description": "My wife and I learn a lot watching Shark Tank, .10/17/2019 10:24:35AM EST.", "authors": ["Kevin Cullis", "Leah Barkoukis", "Cortney O'Brien", "Beth Baumann", "Bronson Stocking", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2014/120/e27496ac-4ba0-4d23-b2d7-69d6321d6777.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
