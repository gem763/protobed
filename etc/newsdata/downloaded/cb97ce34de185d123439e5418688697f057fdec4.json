Al Green (D-Tex.) calling for Trump\u2019s removal from office.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cDemocrats were already trying to impeach @realDonaldTrump without a reason back in MAY 2017,\u201d Scalise wrote on Twitter. \u201cThis has always been about politics and power for them \u2014 not the facts.\u201d\n\n8:30 a.m.: Omar re-ups impeachment call ahead of Trump rally in her district\n\nRep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) went on Twitter on Thursday morning to preempt an expected attack on her at Trump\u2019s Minneapolis rally and to remind voters that she has called for impeaching the president.\n\nOmar, a naturalized U.S. citizen who was born in Somalia, has been in Trump\u2019s crosshairs for months and was the subject of a \u201csend her back\u201d chant at a Trump rally in North Carolina in July.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cTrump will see his rally in my district today as an opportunity to attack me,\u201d Omar tweeted Thursday morning, hours before Trump was scheduled to depart the White House. \u201cBut no smear will ever stop me from working toward what I\u2019m in Congress to do.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nShe listed several of her priorities, ending with \u201cImpeach Trump.\u201d\n\n7 a.m.: Trump hits campaign trail for first time since inquiry opened\n\nAhead of his planned campaign rally in Minneapolis, Trump posted a video on Twitter on Wednesday night that features a montage of photos from past events with large crowds of enthusiastic supporters.\n\nThe two-minute video is set to the renowned Queen song, \u201cWe Will Rock You.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThursday night\u2019s rally will be the first since House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) announced the impeachment inquiry against Trump on Sept. 24.\n\nIt marks a rare campaign appearance in a state that Trump did not carry in 2016.

Conway III, offered their legal reasoning for an \u201cexpeditious\u201d impeachment probe into Trump, creating a document they hope will be read by Republicans who continue to stand by the president.\n\nThe 16 attorneys, many of whom worked in Republican administrations, wrote in a joint statement released Thursday morning that Trump\u2019s now infamous call with Zelensky, the text messages between diplomats and Trump\u2019s public call for China to investigate a political opponent are \u201cundisputed\u201d events that amount to Trump violating his oath of office.\n\n\u201cWe have not just a political candidate open to receiving foreign assistance to better his chances at winning an election, but a current president openly and privately calling on foreign governments to actively interfere in the most sacred of U.S. democratic processes, our elections,\u201d they wrote.\n\nAD\n\nRead more here.\n\n5:45 a.m.: Biden campaign slams New York Times for op-ed by conservative author behind Ukraine claims\n\nAs Trump has lobbed unsubstantiated and false claims of international corruption at Biden and his son, he\u2019s often turned to one source for ammunition: conservative author Peter Schweizer.\n\nSo when the New York Times ran an op-ed on Wednesday written by Schweizer about the Bidens, the Democratic presidential candidate\u2019s campaign cried foul.\n\nIn a letter sent to New York Times executive editor Dean Baquet, Biden\u2019s campaign called Schweizer a \u201cdiscredited right-wing polemicist\u201d and suggested the op-ed was part of a larger pattern of \u201cjournalistic malpractice.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you truly blind to what you got wrong in 2016, or are you deliberately continuing policies that distort reality for the sake of controversy and the clicks that accompany it?\u201d Kate Bedingfield, Biden\u2019s deputy campaign manager, wrote in the Wednesday letter.\n\nRead more here.\n\n\u2014 Tim Elfrink\n\n6:30 a.m.: 51 percent of voters want Trump removed from office, Fox News poll finds\n\nA Fox News poll is the latest to show growing support for ousting Trump.\n\nFifty-one percent of voters want Trump impeached and removed from office, according to the poll released Wednesday night.\n\nThat number has risen from 42 percent in a July poll by the network.\n\nFox noted that support for impeachment has risen since July among several of Trump\u2019s key constituencies, including white evangelical Christians (up five percentage points), white men without a college degree (up eight points) and rural whites (up 10 points).\n\nSupport for impeaching Trump and removing him from office has ranged from 43 percent to 48 percent in other independent national polls released this week.\n\n5 a.m.: Ousted Ukraine envoy expected to testify in impeachment probe despite White House vow not to cooperate, congressional aides say\n\nCongressional investigators expect that Marie Yovanovitch, the former ambassador to Ukraine, will appear as planned for a Friday deposition in the House\u2019s ongoing impeachment inquiry, despite the White House\u2019s emphatic pledge not to cooperate with Democrats\u2019 efforts to investigate Trump, according to congressional officials involved with the process.\n\nYovanovitch and her lawyer are \u201con board,\u201d according to a senior congressional aide, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive negotiations. State Department officials would not address questions about the matter, and efforts to contact Yovanovitch on Wednesday were unsuccessful.\n\nWhite House lawyer Pat Cipollone issued a letter to Democrats on Tuesday outlining the Trump administration\u2019s objections to the impeachment inquiry, calling it unconstitutional and vowing to reject congressional requests to cooperate.\n\nHouse Democrats have deposed only Trump\u2019s former special envoy to Ukraine, Kurt Volker, who resigned his post late last month and then provided the committees with copies of text messages he exchanged with other diplomats, Trump personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani and a top aide to Zelensky.\n\nRead more here.", "description": "The president is holding a rally for the first time since House Democrats launched an impeachment inquiry against him late last month.", "authors": ["John Wagner", "National Reporter Leading The Post'S Breaking Political News Team", "Congress", "Campaigns", "Health Policy", "Pennsylvania Politics"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/BnuQTnzVjGdJ5bCUPoBQ4kxr3Kc=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VTYFRSHLKYI6TBOAQWQJRZD3G4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
