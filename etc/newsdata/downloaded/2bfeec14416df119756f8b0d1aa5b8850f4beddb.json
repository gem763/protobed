(AP) - Jim Harbaugh hired Josh Gattis and handed him the keys to Michigan\u2019s offense last winter, hoping the offensive coordinator would bring the program up to speed in college football.\n\nHarbaugh envisioned and touted a new brand of football that would put some of the team\u2019s talent in open spaces to make big plays.\n\nSo far, the 10th-ranked Wolverines are sputtering on offense and the preseason talk is getting called into question.\n\nMichigan has turned the ball over seven times in two games and by Gattis\u2019 count, players on offense have committed 10 penalties and combined to drop seven passes.\n\n\u201cYou go back and you look at all those plays in critical situations, they\u2019re killing us,\u201d Gattis said Monday.\n\nMichigan has managed to win its first two games, barely beating Army in double overtime after a sluggish opener in which overmatched Middle Tennessee was beaten 40-21.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve stopped ourselves more than anything,\u201d Gattis said.\n\nShea Patterson has been shaky with the ball, losing three of the team\u2019s five fumbles. Patterson and his teammates will have plenty of time to work on taking better care of the ball because their next game follows an off week on Sept. 21 at No. 14 Wisconsin.\n\n\u201cI think our kids are just pressing, wanting to be great,\u201d Gattis said. \u201cThere\u2019s a high level of excitement and standard for them, a lot of pressure. It\u2019s a perfect opportunity to get them calmed down. Let\u2019s play loose, play our type of football.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll spend the bye week, hopefully, get some voodoo expert in here and get rid of the curse of the fumbles.\u201d\n\nGattis confirmed Patterson has been playing with an oblique injury, but insisted it has not affected the senior quarterback. Backup Dylan McCaffrey has played in place of Patterson in both games, following a plan Harbaugh has had since during the preseason.\n\n\u201cWhen we pull Shea, it\u2019s not necessarily that he\u2019s doing bad,\u201d Gattis said.\n\nThe time off may help Michigan get some key players back.\n\nStandout receiver Donovan Peoples-Jones and offensive tackle Jon Runyan have missed the first two games with injuries.\n\nDefensive coordinator Don Brown said linebacker Josh Ross left the Army game with a stringer. Defensive lineman Michael Dwumfour had a cast on his right hand last week after injuring himself in the opener.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to play with one hand,\u201d Brown said.\n\nMichigan\u2019s defense has played relatively well, considering its offense has turned the ball over seven times to give opponents chances to score on a short field. Brown\u2019s unit, though, has not been able to avoid head-scratching mistakes.\n\nSenior linebacker Khaleke Hudson, for example, lined up offside to give the Black Knights a first down to set up their touchdown in the first overtime Saturday.\n\n\u201cCan you believe it?\u201d Brown asked two days later, still shaking his head in disbelief.\n\nOn both sides of the ball, Michigan is making mental and physical mistakes that are creating doubts preseason predictions for college football\u2019s winningest program will ring true. The Wolverines were a popular pick to win the Big Ten title, for the first time since 2004. Some expected them to reach the College Football Playoff for the first time and to contend for their first national championship since 1997.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why the ball\u2019s on the ground. I don\u2019t know why we\u2019re jumping offside,\u201d center Cesar Ruiz said. \u201cBut I know it can be fixed, and that\u2019s one thing we\u2019re going to work on.\n\n\u201cI think the bye week was perfect for us to really focus on what we got to fix.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Jim Harbaugh hired Josh Gattis and handed him the keys to Michigan's offense last winter, hoping the offensive coordinator would bring the program up to speed in college football.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Larry Lage"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/07/army_michigan_football_61358_c0-106-2529-1580_s1770x1032.jpg?bae7147c1109d91d6d5459e02b6cfa7695493439", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
