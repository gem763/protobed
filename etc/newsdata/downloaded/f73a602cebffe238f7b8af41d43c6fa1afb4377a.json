He had such a terrible injury which he\u2019s come back from. He\u2019s 18 years of age and can spray the ball around like that, left or right, and he is full of confidence,\u2019 Shearer said on Match of the Day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018He can go on the outside and come on the inside.\u2019\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\n\u2018Everything Chelsea did well he was at the heart of it. He did his bit defensively which he had to do and he was hugging the touchline, and with that drive that he\u2019s got he makes it very difficult for defenders.\n\n\u2018For the goal he sets it up for Alonso, puts it into his path and says \u201cgo on, have a go\u201d and that was the winning goal. Chelsea were the better team and deserved to score.\n\n\u2018What a week it has been for him. Two for the Under-21s as well. He\u2019s a talent.\u2019\n\nOn Hudson-Odoi\u2019s display, Lampard said: \u2018I thought he was good, really good, in terms of product on the wing and taking people on.\n\n\u2018He looked sharp, getting at people \u2013 a big threat. I am really pleased with that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018The end product will come even more with Callum. Coming inside and getting his shots away, he was giving them a big problem, so it was great to see and for the fans to see. Callum needs to carry on doing that.\n\n\u2018There is the other side of the game, off the ball. He knows that he can get better at that, and he will do. There are glimpses today of some of the special stuff he has got.\u2019\n\nMORE: Robbie Fowler taunts Sir Alex Ferguson ahead of Man Utd vs Liverpool", "description": "Alan Shearer has showered Callum Hudson-Odoi with praise after the forward's impressive performance in Chelsea's 1-0 victory over Newcastle.
