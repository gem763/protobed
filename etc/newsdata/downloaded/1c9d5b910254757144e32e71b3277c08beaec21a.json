Sticking strictly to this measure, however, can leave savers with a significant shortfall if, for example, markets sour or inflation stirs, financial advisors warn.\n\n\u201cThe 4% rule was developed using historical data available over 20 years ago and is less relevant to data available now or looking forward,\u201d says Kathleen Stewart, wealth strategist at BNY Mellon Wealth Management. \u201cOver the last several years, lower interest rates and low fixed-income yields have been a factor in retirement planning. Going forward, they may not produce suitable returns necessary to assure that 4% rule works over the long term,\u201d she says.\n\nThe danger of holding tight to the idea of a 4% withdrawal rate is that people could outlive their assets or take too much risk to generate the income needed. For example, they could feel the need to hold more stocks than they otherwise would in order to generate the returns necessary to meet their withdrawal needs, she says. This could add a level of risk to their portfolio that may not be prudent given their time horizon.\n\nMost retirees require a greater degree of certainty than sticking to the 4% rule offers, according to Daniel R. Hill, president and CEO of Richmond, Va.-based registered investment advisory Hill Wealth Strategies.\n\nWhen he works with prospective clients in their early to-mid-60s, he uses a so-called Monte Carlo simulation technique to help them understand their chance of having enough money in retirement. He starts with a 4% withdrawal rate because it\u2019s what people are familiar with\u2014but he doesn\u2019t end up there. That\u2019s because the simulation usually shows a chance they\u2019ll run out of money at that rate.\n\n\u201cIf I told you, getting on an airplane, that it had a 90% chance of landing safely, would you get on that plane? It doesn\u2019t seem like a good plan to me if it\u2019s not 100%. We need to have a better plan,\u201d he says.\n\nHis advice is for investors to do the math and see what works in their particular situation. For some people, an ideal withdrawal rate may be 5%, 3% or even 2% depending on factors such as the size of their portfolio, how much debt they have, their living expenses, and how they want to spend their retirement.\n\nStewart of BNY Mellon says it\u2019s also important for retirees to manage and evaluate their withdrawal rates regularly, as markets fluctuate and other life circumstances change, to help ensure retirees stay on track with their plan.\n\nShe recommends that investors develop an integrated asset-allocation strategy that works with their expenses. For instance, she says, some retirees may require a more conservative 60% fixed-income allocation (with only 40% in stocks) when their portfolio primarily covers fixed expenses, such as housing, utilities, food, clothing, and transportation.\n\nOn the other hand, a slightly more aggressive portfolio could be appropriate for some retirees whose life circumstances are different, she says.\n\nYour tax rate will be lower in retirement\n\nAnother commonly false assumption pre-retirees make is that their tax rate will be significantly lower in retirement. They assume because they are no longer bringing in the same level of income, they won\u2019t be paying the same level of taxes.\n\nBut often they forget they will still owe taxes on their traditional 401(k) distributions, says Gary Droz, managing director at MainLine Private Wealth, a registered investment advisor in Wynnewood, Pa. He says families\u2014particularly those with household earnings over $100,000\u2014often have a similar tax rate in retirement, or even higher once required minimum distributions are taken into account.\n\nThis miscalculation is especially impactful because so many families have such a significant portion of their wealth tied up in a traditional 401(k) and IRS rules don\u2019t allow people to keep the money in these accounts indefinitely. People generally have to start taking distributions from their traditional 401(k) at age 70\u00bd at ordinary income rates. Oftentimes, these amounts are enough to put them over the tax rate they were when they were earning income from their jobs, Droz says.\n\nHad they realized this before retirement, they might have been able to take advantage of the Roth 401(k), which is funded with after-tax dollars and whose withdrawals are tax-free if the account owner is at least 59\u00bd and has held the account for at least five years. Converting a traditional 401(k) to a Roth 401(k) may not make sense because of tax considerations, but a majority of companies that offer a traditional 401(k) plan also offer a Roth 401(k) option, Droz says.\n\nPeople can ask their employer about the possibility of including this feature if the option doesn\u2019t already exist, he says. \u201cWhat many individuals fail to realize is that the majority of your retirement account balance at the end of your working life is earnings, not contributions,\u201d Droz says. \u201cIf you used a Roth 401(k)? Every dollar of that balance is yours to keep.\u201d\n\nThe upshot, Droz says, is this: The concern that people will outlive their money\u2014or be forced to crimp their lifestyle in retirement\u2014is exacerbated by the fact that many retirees underestimate their tax liability. \u201cThey don\u2019t consider taxes a viable drag on their cost of living,\u201d he says, \u201cbut that\u2019s just not the case.\u201d\n\nQuestions?
