(Tom Fox/The Dallas Morning News via AP) More\n\nGuyger, 31, is charged with murder stemming from the Sept. 6, 2018, fatal shooting of 26-year-old Botham \"Bo\" Jean at the South Side Flats apartment complex in Dallas.\n\nGuyger, who was fired from the Dallas police department 18 days after Jean was killed in his own apartment, claimed she mistook the victim's apartment for her own, which was one floor below and had an identical layout.\n\nNot only did she mistakenly park on the wrong floor of the complex, she walked down a long hallway, passing 16 different apartments but failed to realize she was not headed to her front door, a prosecutor said during his opening argument on Monday.\n\nProsecutors said Guyger, who had just gotten off duty after working more than 13 hours, acted recklessly on the night of the shooting and was distracted, suggesting from her text messages that she was planning to have a rendezvous with her police partner and lover. Prosecutors said she failed to recognize numerous hints that she was headed to the wrong apartment, including failing to realize she was standing on a red mat before entering Jean's apartment door, which she found unlocked and ajar.\n\nArmstrong said the evidence did not support the prosecution's claims that Guyger was reckless.\n\nWhen asked to express his opinions on the evidence collected, prosecutors raised an objection and Dallas County District Court Judge Tammy Kemp sent the jury out of the courtroom.\n\nWithout the jury in the courtroom, Kemp allowed Rogers to proffer Armstrong's opinions on the investigation but refused to allow him to state those opinions in front of the jury, at least for the time being.\n\nPHOTO: Texas Ranger David Armstrong testifies in fired Dallas police officer Amber Guyger's murder trial, Sept. 25, 2019, in Dallas. (Tom Fox/The Dallas Morning News via AP) More\n\nRogers reserved the right to recall Armstrong as an expert witness for the defense, which would set up the awkward situation of the prosecution trying to discredit the testimony of the lead investigator in their case.\n\nArmstrong testified that in his opinion, Guyger believed that she had encountered a burglar in what she wrongly thought was her own apartment.\n\n\"Do you have an opinion as to whether it was reasonable, based on the facts and circumstances, for an ordinary and prudent person in Amber Guyger's position, for her to perceive Botham Jean was a deadly threat?\" Rogers asked Armstrong.\n\nHe responded, \"I believe that she did perceive him as a deadly threat.\"\n\nContinuing his cross-examination, Rogers asked, \"And today you're telling us that based on everything and based on your training and experience, you don't believe there's even probable cause that Amber Guyger committed any crime, correct?\"", "description": "The lead investigator in the wrong-apartment killing of an innocent man by a former Dallas police officer on trial for murder claimed on Wednesday that the officer did not commit a crime based on the totality of the evidence.
