Swiss luxury goods group Richemont\n\nfell nearly 5%, weighing the most on the pan-European\n\nSTOXX 600 index , while Swatch declined 2.4%\n\nafter a bearish note by UBS.\n\nMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan\n\nticked up 0.08% while Japan's Nikkei\n\ndipped 0.18% after 10 straight days of gains and China's\n\nblue-chip share index rose 0.49%.\n\nWall Street futures pointed to a softer opening.\n\nBrent crude futures dipped 0.26% to $64.38 a barrel,\n\nhaving conceded about 65% of their gains made after the weekend\n\nattack on Saudi Arabia's oil facilities.\n\nBrent crude futures dipped 0.09% to $64.48 a barrel,\n\nhaving conceded a chunk of their gains made after the weekend\n\nattack on Saudi Arabia's oil facilities.\n\nU.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 lost 0.5% to\n\n$59.04 per barrel, paring back around half of its gains after\n\nSaturday's attack.\n\nSaudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman on Tuesday\n\nsought to reassure markets, saying the kingdom would restore its\n\nlost oil production by month-end having recovered supplies to\n\ncustomers to the levels they were prior to the weekend's\n\nattacks. \"I would think a spike in oil prices will likely prove to be\n\nshort-term given that the global economy isn't doing too well,\"\n\nsaid Akira Takei, bond fund manager at Asset Management One.\n\nStill, heightened geopolitical tensions underpinned oil as well\n\nas some safe-haven assets such as U.S. bonds.\n\nA U.S. official said on Tuesday the United States believes\n\nthe attacks originated in southwestern Iran, an assessment that\n\ncould heighten the rivalry between Tehran and Riyadh. Iran has\n\ndenied involvement in the strikes. Adding to uncertainties in the Middle East were exit polls\n\nfrom Israel's election, which showed the race too close to call\n\nsuggesting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's fight for\n\npolitical survival could drag on. Gold was 0.07% down at $1,501.54, while the 10-year\n\nU.S. Treasuries yield fell to 1.799% , compared with\n\nFriday's 1-1/2-month high of 1.908% ahead of the Fed's policy\n\nannouncement on Wednesday.\n\nWhile a 25-basis point rate cut is seen as near-certain,\n\ninvestors look to the statement and economic projections from\n\nFed policymakers, given signs of deep disagreements among them.\n\n\"People are very cautious right now,\" said Christophe\n\nBarraud, at Market Securities in Paris. \"They're waiting for the\n\nFed meeting and potential new development in Saudi Arabia.\"\n\n\"For the Fed meeting, people are not betting on a big\n\npositive surprise.\"\n\nThe ongoing U.S.-China trade war has raised policymakers'\n\nconcerns about slowing factory output although resilient\n\ndomestic consumption has given hawks some reasons to worry about\n\ncutting rates too hastily.\n\nPossibly further complicating their discussions, short-term\n\nU.S. interest rates shot up this week, with overnight repo rates\n\nrising to 7%, due largely to seasonal factors such as huge\n\npayments for taxes and bond supply. That prompted the New York Fed to conduct its first repo\n\noperation in more than a decade to inject funds to stressed\n\nmoney markets. The New York Federal Reserve said late Tuesday it would\n\nconduct a repurchase agreement operation early on Wednesday \"in\n\norder to help maintain the federal funds rate within the target\n\nrange of\" 2.00% to 2.25%. Jeffrey Gundlach, chief executive of DoubleLine Capital,\n\nsaid on Tuesday that the repo market squeeze makes it more\n\nlikely that the Federal Reserve will resume expansion of its\n\nbalance sheet \"pretty soon.\" Also in focus is the Bank of Japan's policy meeting due\n\nThursday. While the latest Reuters poll suggests the BOJ will\n\nkeep its policy on hold, 28 of 41 economists expect it will ease\n\nits policy this year and 13 believe it may surprise by taking\n\naction at the Thursday meeting. In currencies, sterling edged lower after climbing to a new\n\nsix-week high on hopes for a last-minute Brexit deal.\n\nThe pound fell 0.2% in early European trade to $1.2476\n\nGBP=D3 , but that followed a decent gain on Tuesday to $1.2528\n\non the back of optimism that Prime Minister Boris Johnson was\n\ntrying to secure a Brexit deal with the European Union before\n\nthe Oct. 31 deadline.\n\nAgainst the euro sterling was unchanged at 88.585 pence\n\nEURGBP=D3 .\n\nThe yen eased slightly to 108.21 yen , near a\n\n1-1/2-month low of 108.37 touched on Tuesday.", "description": "GLOBAL MARKETS-Caution rules oil, financial markets due to Middle East worries, Fed", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEB0E0CQ_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
