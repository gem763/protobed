Democrats looking for ways to attack Donald Trump have been licking their chops at the prospect of a James Mattis tell-all memoir. Unfortunately for them, Mattis has indeed written such a book, but it tells all about Mattis\u2019 observations of their front runner, Joe Biden, and his former boss Barack Obama.\n\nThe Washington Examiner got a sneak peek of Mattis\u2019 new memoir Call Sign Chaos, and it\u2019s not pretty. While Mattis warned of the risks of a sudden withdrawal in 2011, Biden refused to listen:\n\n\u201cI found him an admirable and amiable man. But he was past the point where he was willing to entertain a \u2018good idea.\u2019 He didn\u2019t want to hear more; he wanted our forces out of Iraq. Whatever path led there fastest, he favored,\u201d Mattis writes. \u201cHe exuded the confidence of a man whose mind was made up, perhaps even indifferent to considering the consequences were he judging the situation incorrectly.\u201d Biden reassured Mattis that Maliki wouldn\u2019t eject all American troops from the country. \u201cMaliki wants us to stick around, because he does not see a future in Iraq otherwise,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI\u2019ll bet you my vice presidency.\u201d Mattis doesn\u2019t say whether he tried to collect on that bet. As he writes, \u201cIn October 2011, Prime Minister Maliki and President Obama agreed that all U.S. forces would leave at the end of the year.\u201d Mattis\u2019 warnings proved prescient, as Maliki, free of American influence, went after Sunni politicians and districts, alienating a third of the country. \u201cIraq slipped back into escalating violence. It was like watching a car wreck in slow motion,\u201d Mattis writes. A Sunni revolt and a weak Iraqi Army allowed al Qaeda-aligned terrorists to return in 2014, calling themselves the Islamic State.\n\nMattis told reporters last week that he won\u2019t criticize a sitting president whose administration he served. It\u2019s widely suspected that Mattis has no love for Donald Trump, and some of his remarks about leadership seem implicitly aimed at his former boss. When it comes to Trump\u2019s retired predecessor, however, Mattis shows no such restraint. His assessment of Barack Obama doesn\u2019t even carry the leavening of personal admiration that Mattis expresses about Biden:\n\nMattis summarizes his time commanding CENTCOM, overseeing military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia until Obama fired him, in harsh terms: \u201cIt was to be a time when I would witness duty and deceit, courage and cowardice, and, ultimately, strategic frustration.\u201d The general was in charge of two wars, in Iraq and Afghanistan, though one ended on his watch \u2014 or so the president said. \u2026 The White House \u201cdealt with Iraq as a \u2018one-off,\u2019 as if the pullout of our troops there would have no regional implications, reinforcing our allies\u2019 fears that we were abandoning them. I argued strongly that any vacuum left in our wake would be filled by Sunni terrorists and Iran.\u201d Mattis believes he was vindicated by events. Obama declared the war over, but \u201cIraq slipped back into escalating violence. It was like watching a car wreck in slow motion,\u201d Mattis says. \u201cAll of this was predicted \u2014 and preventable.\u201d Obama made \u201ccatastrophic decisions\u201d in Iraq, Mattis concludes. And he did so because he ignored the advice coming from multiple military and civilian advisers, thinking he knew better than all of them. \u201cAt the top, then as now, there was an aura of omniscience. The assessments of the intelligence community, our diplomats, and our military had been excluded from the decision-making circle,\u201d Mattis writes.\n\nHis continuing conflict with Obama over regional strategic issues led to his abrupt dismissal the next year, Mattis writes. After noting that he was known for \u201cblunt speaking,\u201d Mattis implicitly accuses Obama of cowardice in the manner in which he got cashiered:\n\nHe was relieved of command without even an official phone call. \u201cIn December 2012, I received an unauthorized phone call telling me that in an hour, the Pentagon would be announcing my relief,\u201d he writes. \u201cI was leaving a region aflame and in disarray. The lack of an integrated regional strategy had left us adrift, and our friends confused. We were offering no leadership or direction. I left my post deeply disturbed that we had shaken our friends\u2019 confidence and created vacuums that our adversaries would exploit.\u201d\n\nObama\u2019s history, but Biden is presently arguing to be the future. This assessment from Mattis makes that argument a lot more complicated, especially since foreign policy and national-security strategy is supposed to be Biden\u2019s strong point. Mattis is now the second former Secretary of Defense to allege that Biden\u2019s the emperor with no clothes on when it comes to his supposed specialty. Remember what Robert Gates wrote about Biden a few years ago?\n\n\u201cI think he has been wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades,\u201d Gates writes, according to a New York Times review of the book posted Tuesday.\n\nSounds like a consensus has developed among the people who truly know these policy areas.", "description": "\"Catastrophic decisions.\"", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Andrew Malcolm"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/obama-biden.jpg"}
