The events that led to Travis Kalanick's removal from Uber transpired over the course of one no good, very bad year. But WeWork and Adam Neumann have always wanted to be exceptional. As it turns out, that also means that the company's implosion came about with exceptional rapidity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's all gone from business as usual\u2014well, as usual as it ever was at WeWork\u2014to total catastrophe in the span of six weeks. Among the deluge of developments over the past seven days: Neumann is out as WeWork's CEO, having reportedly voted for his own removal. Two co-replacements have been named. WeWork is planning layoffs. It's planning divestitures. There almost certainly isn't going to be an IPO this year. A \"purge\" of Neumann's confidants at the company is reportedly in the works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey're even selling the company Gulfstream. The Gulfstream! Where's Neumann supposed to get high during\n\nhis transcontinental travels now?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeWork has responded to a quickly shrinking valuation and nearly unprecedented amounts of pre-IPO ridicule by blowing everything up\u2014and that's one of 10 things you need to know from the past week:\n\n\n\n\n\nDeep breaths, everyone. (rudall30/iStock/Getty Images Plus) 1. The fall of WeWork As the autumn leaves are turning color, WeWork is turning into a startup saga for the ages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Monday, I\n\nwrote a piece comparing Neumann's \"potential\" ouster to the conclusion of Kalanick's time at Uber. The very next day, in a move that was in some ways stunning but in others seemed to be the only logical conclusion to this whole mess, Neumann\n\nstepped down as CEO, acquiescing to the apparent wishes of Masayoshi Son and SoftBank. Also to his own wishes, I guess: Neumann voted to remove himself in a meeting of the WeWork board, according to Reuters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeumann will remain with the company as non-executive chairman with his influence greatly diminished; his super-voting shares that once were worth 20 votes each have been reduced to 3 votes per share. Two career executives will take his place as new co-CEOs: Artie Minson, who joined WeWork in 2015 after stints in the C-suites at Time Warner Cable and AOL, and Sebastian Gunningham, who spent more than a decade at Amazon before jumping to WeWork last year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the time of his hire, Gunningham issued a statement that he was \"headed to join another magical company in its mission to reinvent the places and communities where people go to work.\" It probably doesn't seem so magical anymore.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt appears Minson and Gunningham won't waste any time in making some major changes. Thousands of layoffs could be in store, up to half of the company's workforce, according to TechCrunch. Neumann's wife, Rebekah, is giving up her roles as chief brand officer at WeWork and CEO of WeGrow, the company's bizarre education offshoot. Leadership is planning \"to purge nearly 20 friends and family members\" of the Neumanns, including a vice chairman and the chief product officer, per the WSJ. Bloomberg reported Friday that SoftBank is enlisting former Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure to fill an unspecified role at WeWork. The company reportedly plans to sell off three startups it acquired for a combined $475 million over the past three years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd again: the Gulfstream. The Gulfstream! The $60 million private jet was \"a favorite\" of Neumann's, according to the WSJ. At first, that honestly makes me feel a tiny bit bad for the guy, because that would suck to go from having access to your own $60 million jet to not having access to your own $60 million jet. But then my sanity returns, and I start to giggle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a memo to WeWork employees after his resignation, Neumann reportedly wrote, \"Since the announcement of our IPO, too much of the focus has been placed on me.\" I mean, yeah, but also: That particular problem began way before the announcement of the IPO. One way to look at WeWork's past few years is as a story of investors (like Son and SoftBank) and bankers (like Jamie Dimon and JPMorgan Chase) enabling an egomaniac's worst impulses by furnishing him with an unlimited supply of capital. It's the logical endpoint of the cult of the founder. It's how you get stuff like a $13 million-plus investment in a company that makes wave pools.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Well, that was quick.
