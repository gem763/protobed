An escort carrier that saw distinguished service as a submarine-hunter in the North Atlantic during World War II, during the early morning hours of May 2, 1964, Card was part of U.S. Military Sealift Command.\n\nThe ship supported an escalating military commitment of the South Vietnamese government that occurred well before the Tonkin Gulf Incident. Since 1961, Card had transported both fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters to the beleaguered nation as well as the U.S. pilots and support crews need to operate them.\n\nThe commandos swam toward Card, where they spent about an hour in the water attaching the charges just above the waterline near the bilge and the engine compartment on the ship\u2019s starboard side. They set the timers and quickly swam away.\n\nThe charges exploded. Five civilian crewmen on board Card died, the explosion tore a huge hole in the engine-room compartment and a proud ship that had survived German U-boat attacks was on her way to the bottom \u2014 the last aircraft carrier in U.S. military history to date sunk by enemy action.\n\nThe sinking of the Card was stunning victory for the Viet Cong, yet little remembered today. It illustrated how vulnerable naval vessels can be even when faced with a low-tech enemy \u2026 and how difficult maintaining port security can be in a war with no real front.\n\nBut it also demonstrated how resilient American naval forces are. In 17 days, salvage crews raised Card out of nearly 50 feet of water, and six months later the ship returned to service for another six years.\n\nNot surprisingly, North Vietnam celebrated the sinking of Card, considering it a propaganda victory of the first rank. The U.S. government refused to even acknowledge the vessel\u2019s sinking, telling the public the carrier had only been damaged.\n\nThe North Vietnamese government even commemorated the event by portraying the operation on a 1964 postage stamp.\n\nNaval vessels often have a mystique about them \u2014 they look formidable, bristle with weapons and aircraft, and have the ability to project a nation\u2019s power anywhere on the planet. In particular, aircraft carriers are the symbol of a nation possessing \u201cgreat power\u201d status.\n\nBut they are vulnerable to attack. For example, there are reasons why even aircraft carriers have numerous escort vessels \u2014 destroyers, guided-missile cruisers, even submarines \u2014 to protect a carrier as well as engage the enemy.\n\nWe shouldn\u2019t be too surprised when an enemy takes out a naval vessel in combat, even if it is a commando with a time bomb, James Holmes, a naval historian and analyst who teaches at the U.S. Naval War College, told War Is Boring.\n\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t get carried away with thinking of warships as \u2018castles of steel,\u2019 or latter-day dreadnoughts, or whatever,\u201d Holmes said. \u201cA castle is a fortification whose walls can take enormous punishment, whereas most modern warships have thin sides \u2014 the nuclear-powered carrier being an honorable exception. So a guy with a charge can do a lot of damage.\u201d\n\nHolmes said the sinking of Card \u201cprovided a preview\u201d of the attack on the USS Cole in 2000 \u2014 a textbook case of a low-tech assault taking out a prime example of U.S. naval might.\n\nAl Qaeda operatives mounted a suicide attack against Cole, a guided-missile destroyer, using a small boat packed with explosives that targeted the American ship while she was docked in Aden harbor. The blast tore a huge hole in the vessel, killing 17 sailors and injuring 39 \u2014 the deadliest attack on a U.S. Navy ship in recent history.\n\nThe blast from the explosion reached Cole\u2019s galley, killing and wounding many there as sailors were lining up for lunch. Investigators later said they did not consider the timing of the attack a coincidence.\n\nFifty years ago, penetrating harbor security was a major concern as well for the perpetrators of the attack on Card.\n\nLam Son Nao, 79, the leader of the Viet Cong commandos, was a maintenance worker at the port at the time of the attack. He used his job as cover while he gathered intelligence, hid explosives and planned the mission.", "description": "It was a huge blow.", "authors": ["Robert Beckhusen"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/FXDT5Z2EPeUgfzQjVKV8vg--~B/aD0xMDA5O3c9MTQ0MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/125fba9d6745824026319c4e6f458b00", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
