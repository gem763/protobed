As children start to learn about the dangers in the world, as well as what death means, when they are about eight-years-old, nightmares can be the brain's way of processing this new information.\n\n\"Lavender is really relaxing for the senses, so this may help. I would advise to start using this mist an hour before bed, to help stimulate the parasympathetic nervous system and also to initiate the release of melatonin, the hormone that induces sleep.\"\n\nCuckooland's Anti-nightmare mist is sold for \u00a34.95 and has proved so popular with parents that it's currently out of stock, but will be back on sale soon.\n\nCheck cuckooland.com for more information on availability.", "description": "If your little one is plagued by nightmares, one company might have come up with a clever way to get them to sleep", "authors": ["Courtney Pochin", "Image", "Getty Images", "Cuckooland"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20714177.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_They-always-come-out-at-night.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
