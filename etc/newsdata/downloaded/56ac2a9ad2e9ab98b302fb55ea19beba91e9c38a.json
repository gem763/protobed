REUTERS/Tom Brenner\n\nThe Republican president, who is on a three-day swing through the U.S. West that has included a rally in New Mexico and a number of fundraisers in California, also used his trip to criticize the homelessness problem in Los Angeles and San Francisco.\n\nWhile deciding how to respond to an attack on oil infrastructure in Saudi Arabia and fresh from naming a new national security adviser, the president still had immigration at the top of his mind.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to show you a lot of wall. We\u2019re building a lot of wall,\u201d he told reporters in Los Angeles before taking off for San Diego.\n\nTrump\u2019s supporters are eager for the president to keep his promise to build a wall to stem migrant crossings through Mexico from Central America. Crowd chants of \u201cBuild the Wall!\u201d are often the loudest at his political rallies across the country.\n\nIn February, Trump declared a national emergency in order to divert funding toward wall construction when Congress refused to give him the amount he requested. As a candidate in 2016, Trump promised that Mexico would pay for the wall. It has refused to do so.\n\nTrump has sought to assure supporters he is making good on his promise, but according to Politifact, his administration has not built new segments of a wall since he took office in 2017, although it has replaced some 60 miles (96 km) of existing border barriers with new fencing.\n\nDemocrats sharply criticize Trump\u2019s policies and do not believe a wall is the answer to the country\u2019s immigration challenges.\n\nTrump is also collecting cash to bolster his campaign coffers as multiple Democratic presidential candidates ramp up their efforts to take him on in the November 2020 election.\n\nThe president\u2019s campaign and the Republican National Committee were expected to raise some $15 million at events during his western trip, according to an RNC official.\n\nThe RNC raised $23.5 million in August and $141.4 million for the 2019-2020 election cycle so far, and has $53.8 million in cash on hand, the official said.\n\nUnlike his predecessor, Democratic President Barack Obama, Trump is not a frequent visitor to California, a heavily Democratic state that Trump lost by more than 4 million votes in 2016. He used his visit to criticize the state for its challenges dealing with a growing homeless population.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t let Los Angeles, San Francisco and numerous other cities destroy themselves by allowing what\u2019s happening,\u201d he told reporters on Air Force One on Tuesday, suggesting that the issue had dented those cities\u2019 reputations.\n\nBig-city mayors in California have said the homelessness problem in the most-populous U.S. state should not be a partisan issue.", "description": "President Donald Trump will visit a section of wall along the U.S. border with Mexico on Wednesday in a bid to illustrate his commitment to crack down on illegal border crossings as he raises money in California for his re-election campaign.", "authors": ["Jeff Mason", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190918&t=2&i=1431386281&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8H20Y", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
