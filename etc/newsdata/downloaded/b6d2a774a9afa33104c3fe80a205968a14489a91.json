Talk of a special dividend on Wall Street from Costco has finally died down in large part because of its potential $10 billion price tag, says Guggenheim Securities analyst John Heinbockel.\n\n\u201cFor much of the past 18 months, there has been considerable discussion among investors as to the timing and magnitude of a potential special dividend. Such talk has, rightfully, died down. We believe this reflects the shares\u2019 strong performance and the considerable cost of a \u201cmaterial\u201d special dividend,\u201d Heinbockel notes.\n\nShoppers push their carts at the Costco store in Nashua, N.H. (AP Photo/Charles Krupa) More\n\nThe analyst, who rates Costco\u2019s stock a Neutral ahead of its Oct. 3 earnings report, says Costco would only get a temporary lift to its stock price from the dividend. Instead the warehouse retailer would be better served using its financial power to continue to aggressively open stores globally and pay down debt.\n\nIt does make sense, however, that for years Costco has been earmarked for a special dividend payout.\n\nCostco has lots of cash\n\nThe company generates a steady stream of cash flow from its members, who renew their memberships each year. As it opens new warehouses serving bulk mustard and toilet paper, Costco\u2019s cash flow stream only gets stronger. Costco finished the quarter ended May 12 with more than $8 billion in cash and short-term investments, almost two times higher than its long-term debt.\n\nImpressive.\n\nCostco also has had a very low debt-to-equity ratio, according to Yahoo Finance Premium data.\n\nAll of that has led Wall Street to view Costco as one that should be moving more aggressively to return cash to shareholders beyond buybacks and capital reinvestment.\n\nFair point, but don\u2019t expect that special dividend anytime soon bulls.\n\nBrian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and co-anchor of The First Trade at Yahoo Finance.
