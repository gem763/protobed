She also confessed that she thought it was a joke until she eventually spotted the predator.\n\nThe picture, taken by her photographer friend in India, looks like a very boring image of a tree and some dirt, but it turns out there\u2019s actually an apex predator sitting pretty almost front-and-centre in the shot.\n\nSomeone just sent this to me and asked me to find the leopard. I was convinced it was a joke\u2026 until I found the leopard. Can you spot it? pic.twitter.com/hm8ASroFAo \u2014 Bella Lack ???? (@BellaLack) September 27, 2019\n\nSince the image was first posted, it has amassed a whopping 4.1k likes and 1.3k retweets, as well as countless replies from people that are convinced the animal doesn\u2019t actually exist in the image.\n\nAlthough leopard print is a very *extra* fashion trend for humans, it\u2019s quite the contrary for the animals themselves. Their impressive spots basically allow them to disappear in plain sight in rocky and dry terrain.\n\nThe tweet also prompted a plethora of other \u201cspot the leopard in the rocky cliffs\u201d photos. Honestly, it\u2019s like your very own Where\u2019s Wally book.\n\nWhen followers first started spotting the beast, other users were convinced it was some sort of inside joke and that the picture was just a bunch of rocks. However, some wonderful people later dropped spoilers in the reply to point it out to those of us who should\u2019ve gone to Specsavers.\n\nBut even when circled in a big red marker, this sneaky leopard is still near impossible to find. It took a helpful internet stranger literally outlining the animal for some of us to be able to see it.\n\nThe post was also a reminder that leopards are the masters of camouflage, which would be slightly terrifying if you ever found yourself coming face to well, pile of rocks, with one in the wild.\n\nIf you aren\u2019t prepared to spend hours trying to find this fucking leopard like I definitely did, you can find the glaringly obvious spoiler in the replies and at the bottom of this story for those of you who require instant gratification.", "description": "Twitter user Bella Lack has gone viral after sharing a photo that apparently contains a leopard.
