This is oil country. My father has worked in the oil industry. We don\u2019t need foreigners coming in and telling us how to run our business, support our families, put food on our tables \u2026 just shut up until you have solutions.\u201d\n\nThe man said his father, who had recently passed away, would have been \u201cdisgusted\u201d by the mural.\n\nLater that day, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) reported that they returned to find another man adding a French slur.\n\nHe also wrote that Ms Thunberg should leave the country. He refused to speak to reporters.\n\nThe Canadian state of Alberta, where Edmonton is situated, is well known for its oil and gas industry.\n\nHome to the country's vast oil sands, the region holds the world\u2019s third-largest crude reserves, but has struggled to recover from the 2014-15 global oil price crash because of delays in building new export pipelines, which have been met with strong opposition from environmental and indigenous groups, as well as regulatory hold-ups.\n\nWith historic ties to the industry, many energy sector workers and the Alberta government feel the oil sands, scorned by environmentalists for their high carbon emissions intensity, have been unfairly targeted. They say the sector is making progress cutting greenhouse gas output.\n\nWorkers\u2019 rights groups have previously called for mass retraining in renewables to ensure former oil and gas employees are not left behind in the ongoing transition. The energy sector provides 150,000 jobs in the region.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.
