REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach/File Photo\n\nLess than a year ago, the ECB shuttered its 2.6 trillion euro quantitative easing program and gave guidance it would raise interest rates by the end of this year.\n\nBut the ECB has changed course, along with many of its peers. The U.S.-China trade war has slowed global growth, and now the euro zone\u2019s biggest economy, Germany, appears headed for recession.\n\nThe Aug. 29-Sept. 3 poll showed nearly 70 economists were expecting the ECB to cut its deposit rate at its Sept. 12 meeting, with the vast majority predicting a 10 basis point reduction to -0.5%. Nearly a quarter forecast a 20 basis point cut.\n\nEuro zone money markets give a 60% chance of a 20 basis point cut in the deposit rate from minus 0.4%.\n\nAlmost 90% of respondents said the ECB would introduce some form of compensation for banks to offset the unwelcome side-effects of negative interest rates.\n\nAnd nearly 90% of respondents also expected the ECB to announce the restarting of its money printing presses, with monthly purchases of 30 billion euros from October.\n\nWhile more than three-quarters of economists said now is the right time for the ECB to roll out a stimulus package, over 80% of respondents said they were not confident the central bank could control inflation.\n\n\u201cThe ECB should do something even though it is not going to be sufficient to reach the target. That is a situation they have actually been in for quite a long time already and it is a situation the Bank of Japan has been in for much longer,\u201d said Andrew Kenningham, chief Europe economist at Capital Economics.\n\n\u201cThey haven\u2019t got any choice ... otherwise they would be saying \u2018we are not going to fulfill our mandate\u2019. But not many believe inflation is likely to pick up anytime soon, particularly given the state of the world economy and the euro zone economy.\u201d\n\nThe Reuters poll was taken before an exclusive Reuters story based on sources that suggested ECB policymakers were in favor of a stimulus package including a deposit rate cut with a tiered system and a reinforcement of forward guidance.\n\nThat came after last week\u2019s flash reading of 1% for August headline inflation \u2014 the same as in July and the lowest since late 2016.\n\nEven with a host of ECB stimulus measures now widely expected, a majority of economists in the latest poll downgraded their own inflation outlooks for next year \u2014 with the consensus for 2020 the lowest since polling began in April last year.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the ECB will reach its inflation goal in the foreseeable future, but things would be worse without more monetary stimulus. What they will at least be able to do is to prevent inflation from falling further,\u201d said Kristian Toedtmann, senior economist at Dekabank.\n\n\u201cThe ECB needs to defend its credibility in being able to reach its inflation goals. Therefore I expect the ECB to respond with a strong package.\u201d\n\nMedian forecasts for quarterly growth ranged between just 0.2% and 0.3%, little changed from last month, but with lower highs and lower lows for most quarters over the coming two years.\n\nA majority of respondents either lowered their annual average forecasts for growth or kept them unchanged from the previous poll.\n\nThose concerns pushed the chance of a euro zone recession in the coming year to 25% in the latest survey from 20% in July\u2019s poll. But the probability held at 30% in the next two years.\n\nThe poll median forecast the ECB to cut its deposit rate again to -0.6% next quarter and then keep it on hold through to at least the end of 2020.\n\nBut while a majority of economists said the central bank should deliver a stimulus package next week, almost a fifth said it should not.\n\n\u201cThe stimulus package will not be effective in terms of bringing about a recovery or in terms of bringing inflation to target. On the other hand, it runs the risk of being counterproductive,\u201d said Michael Schubert, senior economist at Commerzbank.", "description": "The European Central Bank will cut its deposit rate next week and announce a restart of its asset purchase program, but over 80% of economists polled by Reuters were skeptical about the bank's ability to influence inflation over the medium term.", "authors": ["Richa Rebello", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190904&t=2&i=1425943313&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF83005"}
