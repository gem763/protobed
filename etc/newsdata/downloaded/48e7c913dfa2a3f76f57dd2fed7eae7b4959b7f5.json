They were coming to the United States tonight,\" the president wrote.\n\nBefore the meeting could take place, Trump said, the Taliban admitted to a Kabul attack that killed 12 people, including an American soldier.\n\n\"If they cannot agree to a ceasefire during these very important peace talks, and would even kill 12 innocent people, then they probably don't have the power to negotiate a meaningful agreement anyway,\" Trump tweeted.\n\nThe White House and the State Department both declined to offer any further details about Trump's statement.\n\nA spokesman for the Taliban said the group had only learned of the cancellation through the media \u2014 and that U.S. officials had not formally notified them. Suhail Shaheen, the insurgents' spokesman, said Taliban officials wanted to meet and discuss the latest developments before they could respond further.\n\nThis is not the first time an announcement by Trump has disrupted negotiations. On Aug. 29, Trump told Fox News Radio he was planning to wind down troop numbers to 8,600 for the time being. That outraged Taliban officials who told NPR that they were negotiating for a full, not partial, withdrawal of foreign forces \u2014 in exchange for promises they would not allow the country to become a base for global terror.\n\nThe announcement of talks being canceled may be a partial relief to many Afghans who feared a withdrawal of American troops would embolden insurgents to step up their violent attacks against Afghan security forces, who would be badly weakened in the case of any withdrawal.\n\nThe Taliban already contest or control more than half the country. A U.S. withdrawal could have encouraged them to march onto Kabul \u2014 triggering an even more violent and chaotic round of conflict. And activists feared the Taliban gaining more power would quickly erode their fragile gains for women's rights and democracy.\n\nUntil now, it had appeared that the U.S. was nearing a deal with the Taliban that would bring home some, if not all, of the 14,000 U.S. troops still stationed in Afghanistan.\n\nThe U.S. and the Taliban have held multiple rounds of talks this year in the Gulf nation of Qatar.\n\nTrump has argued repeatedly that it's time to end the war that has dragged on for nearly two decades.", "description": "President Trump says the Taliban admitted to an attack in Kabul that killed an American soldier, so he canceled a planned meeting at Camp David and called off peace negotiations.", "authors": ["Ayesha Rascoe", "Diaa Hadid", "Abdul Sattar"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/09/07/gettyimages-1172289889_wide-7cf6cb6b814e5a79dd67258eb1267f6cf3ca3c64.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
