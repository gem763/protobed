Taubman shouted, \u201cThank God we got Osuna!\u201d according to SI, which said he made similar remarks several times during Saturday night\u2019s celebration, punctuating them with a profanity.\n\nHouston issued a statement Monday accusing the SI reporter of making up the story. Taubman apologized for his language in a statement Tuesday, and MLB and the team started an investigation.\n\nAstros general manager Jeff Luhnow apologized Thursday for the team\u2019s initial response, saying it was wrong, and the team apologized to the SI reporter, the magazine and people who saw the incident, and to those who were offended.\n\n\u201cI think it was important that they recognized that they had made a mistake, that they issued an apology, and they dealt with the individual situation in a decisive way,\u201d Manfred said.\n\nManfred said MLB\u2019s investigation began because of concern over the initial statement but was ongoing.\n\n\u201cI would say that there are a variety of issues,\u201d Manfred said. \u201cThere are other things that we want to talk to the Astros about.\u201d\n\nManfred said MLB intends to have conversations with Houston owner Jim Crane.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want there to be an expectation that this piece of it is going to be as quick as the last piece because there\u2019s more to it,\u201d Manfred said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Major League Baseball is conducting a wider probe of the Houston Astros that goes beyond the assistant general manager who was fired", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/25/ed7070_mlb-astros-investigation-baseball-01327-in-jan-17-2018-file-photo-houston-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
