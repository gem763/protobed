The company has released new trailers for its first three children\u2019s shows: Snoopy in Space, Helpsters, and Ghostwriter.\n\nThese aren\u2019t the first trailers for the shows, but it\u2019s clear that Apple is trying to get potential TV Plus subscribers hyped for the service\u2019s launch by releasing additional looks. The first features Charlie Brown\u2019s lovable dog in a series of 12 short films, according to a press release. Snoopy finally achieves his dream of becoming an astronaut with NASA, and he spends his time taking command of the International Space Station, exploring the Moon, and much more.\n\nGhostwriter follows four friends who team up to figure out why a ghost at a haunted bookstore is releasing fictional characters into the real world. It\u2019s a reimagining of a 1992 series that was originally dreamt up at Sesame Workshops. Each episode is based on a piece of literature, including classic novels and new pieces that have been commissioned by authors like DJ Machale and Kwame Alexander.\n\nHelpsters is a live-action show from the makers of Sesame Street that\u2019s targeted at preschoolers. The show follows Cosy and the \u201chelpsters,\u201d a team of monsters who love to solve problems. No problem is too small, based on Apple\u2019s description of the show, which describes some of the problems as \u201cplanning a party, climbing a mountain, or mastering a magic trick.\u201d\n\nAll three shows will launch alongside Apple TV Plus on November 1st. There will be nine originals at launch, including Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon\u2019s The Morning Show, Jason Momoa\u2019s See, and Ronald D. Moore\u2019s For All Mankind.
