They have a finite amount of writes.'\n\n'When this burns out, you wake up to a black screen [in the car's center console.] There's nothing there. No climate control. You can generally drive the car, but it won't charge.'\n\nJason Hughes, from 057 Technology, told Insideevs , 'The main issue is that this excessive log file writing causes eMMC flash wear'\n\nAnd he continued to explain that this issue seems to occur after four years of use.\n\nVice noted that the malfunction brings to light Telas not abiding by the same rules as other manufactures when it comes to repairs.\n\nThe issue highlights the fact that Tesla is not bound by the same rules when it comes to repair as other auto manufacturers.\n\nThe firm is not a part of the memorandum of understanding signed by other auto manufacturers in 2014, in which they agreed to sell parts to independent repair shops.\n\nAlthough Tesla has yet to make a public statement, the firm's CEO Elon Must did tweet Hughes about the issue stating it 'should be much better at this point,' but did not elaborate about what changes or if and when they will be fixed\n\nThis results in just a few few independent Tesla repair professionals and getting their hands on parts can be difficult -- many parts are salvaged from wrecked Tesla vehicles.\n\nAlthough Tesla has yet to make a public statement, the firm's CEO Elon Must did tweet Hughes about the issue stating it 'should be much better at this point,' but did not elaborate about what changes or if and when they will be fixed.", "description": "Older Tesla models are bricking as a result of a worn-out flash memory chip and it could cost more than $1,800 to fix the issue.
