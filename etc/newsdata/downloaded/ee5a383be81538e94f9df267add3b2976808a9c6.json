Craig, had a choice to make,\u201d Campoamor said, pointing at the defendant. \u201cHe took a gamble. He gambled that nobody would ever learn what he had done. He gambled that the folks in the FARA unit would take his word for it. And they did.\u201d\n\nHowever, Craig\u2019s defense stressed that prosecutors were asking the jury to believe that Craig was essentially willing to throw away a reputation built over half a century.\n\n\u201cMr. Craig is not the kind of person who would lie to a U.S. government agency, not after a 50-year career based on character and trust,\u201d Defense Attorney William Murphy said. \u201cWhat value does 50 years of a life well lived have in the scales of justice as you weigh the evidence? I suggest to you that it weighs a lot.\u201d\n\nMurphy also blasted the prosecution\u2019s case as resting on the testimony of admitted liars and crippled by the absence from the witness stand of key players in the saga, like Paul Manafort, the infamous international political consultant and Trump campaign chairman who helped commission and roll out Craig\u2019s Ukraine-related report, and New York Times reporter David Sanger, whom Craig gave an early look at the review.\n\nGlobal Translations A new podcast series from POLITICO.

Where\u2019s David Sanger?\u201d Murphy asked.\n\nProsecutors did call Manafort\u2019s deputy Rick Gates and British public relations consultant Jonathan Hawker to testify that\u2014contrary to Craig\u2019s denials\u2014his handoff of the report to Sanger was part of Ukraine\u2019s broader media plan.\n\nBut Murphy savaged the men he described as the prosecution \u201cstar witnesses,\u201d blasting Gates as \u201ca congenital liar\u201d and slamming Hawker as \u201can occupational liar.\u201d\n\nThere was a decidedly defensive tone to the outset of the prosecution\u2019s argument, with the prosecutor quickly trying to reassure jurors that the trial \u2014 which entered its fourth week Tuesday \u2014 is a worthy endeavor despite the fact that Craig is only charged with being misleading and not with failing to register as a foreign agent or some more grave offense.\n\n\u201cDo not be mistaken. It matters,\u201d Campoamor insisted. \u201cThat\u2019s information that\u2019s important for the American public, for our legislators and people in government to make decisions\u2026. Don\u2019t let the defense get up here and tell you this is a case merely about words as if this case doesn\u2019t matter. It does.\u201d\n\nThe prosecutor also seemed to go out of his way to draw attention to how closely Craig worked with Manafort, who some jurors have expressed disdain for.\n\n\u201cManafort was the main point of contact. They were the two generals,\u201d Campoamor said.\n\nBut Campoamor also sought to ward off doubts about the credibility of figures like Gates and Hawker and the absence of other potential witnesses by stressing that prosecutors believe that, standing alone, the emails introduced in the case are enough to convict Craig of scheming to bamboozle the government.\n\n\u201cThe witnesses here are just providing the context for some of the documents. You have it in black and white,\u201d Campoamor argued. \u201cIt is a crime to conceal. It is a crime to carefully craft your answers, so that when you read them together, they don\u2019t even make sense or are misleading or would lead you to believe something else?\u2026.That, ladies and gentlemen, is a crime.\u201d\n\nMurphy was about halfway into his two-hour presentation to the jury before he offered up one of the defense\u2019s most strained contentions: a claim that when Craig told the Justice Department he distributed the report only \u201cin response to requests from the media,\u201d he was not lying because Sanger asked to look at a copy after Craig offered him one.\n\n\u201cDid he push the report on Sanger?\u201d Murphy asked, noting that Craig\u2019s email asked Sanger if he was interested in the review and whether he had time to look it over.\n\n\u201cMr. Sanger says, yeah, I\u2019d like to get a copy,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cLadies & gentlemen, that is a truthful statement. Mr. Sanger requested a copy of the report. In fact, he requested it twice.\u201d\n\nWhen prosecutor Jason McCullough rose to deliver a final, impassioned pitch to the jury, he angrily dismissed the defense\u2019s position as an exercise in sophistry.\n\nAs McCullough lit into the defense, he used TV monitors in the courtroom and jury box to display Craig\u2019s email to Sanger below a graphic featuring the words: \u201cThis is NOT a \u2018request from the media.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is a lie\u2014a lie!\u201d McCullough exclaimed. \u201cThis is a false statement.\u201d\n\nMcCullough also argued emphatically that Craig\u2019s dealings with the New York Times must have been at Ukraine\u2019s bidding because a Ukrainian steel tubing magnate, Viktor Pinchuk, had paid $4 million for the project. The prosecutor also suggested that Craig had compromised himself from the outset of what was billed as an independent review.\n\n\u201cShow me the money,\u201d the prosecutor shouted. \u201cHe\u2019s spending 4 million to do this. He\u2019s under the control of Ukraine\u2026.. He cares about the fact that Ukraine gets what it paid for.\u201d\n\nCraig is the only appointee of a Democratic administration to be charged in the cases stemming from former special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation. Mueller probed the Ukraine project because it was orchestrated in part by Manafort, who was a top adviser to Tymoshenko\u2019s rival, Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych.\n\nManafort eventually admitted to conspiring to evade the foreign-agent law in connection with the Skadden project and others. He\u2019s serving a seven-and-a-half year prison term on various charges. Prosecutors said in a court filing that they concluded they could not \u201csponsor\u201d Manafort\u2019s testimony in Craig\u2019s case.\n\nThe probe into Craig and Skadden was eventually handed off to prosecutors in New York and, later, a team in Washington that is handling Craig\u2019s trial.\n\nThe jury of nine men and three women is set to begin deliberating Wednesday morning, following a reading of formal jury instructions by Judge Amy Berman Jackson. Under a schedule Jackson set at the outset of the case, no deliberations are expected Thursday or Friday, so jurors are likely to return Monday if they don\u2019t reach a verdict by Wednesday afternoon.\n\nThe jury heard from 16 prosecution witnesses, including Gates, who testified for the first time since appearing at Manafort\u2019s trial in Virginia a year ago and is awaiting sentencing on a pair of felony charges he pleaded guilty to. The defense called Craig and five others, including four character witnesses who attested to Craig\u2019s outstanding reputation.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

The judge dropped the latter charge last month, ruling that it was unclear whether that specific provision \u2014 aimed at FARA filings \u2014 applied to a letter arguing someone should not have to register under FARA.\n\nCraig faces a maximum potential sentence of five years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000 if convicted on the remaining count, but most defendants are sentenced under federal guidelines that typically call for more lenient punishment, particularly for offenders with no prior criminal record.\n\nThe judge would not be required to sentence Craig to prison time, but other defendants who pleaded guilty to a similar charge in Mueller-related cases \u2014 including a junior Skadden lawyer on the Ukraine project \u2014 got short prison terms.\n\nJurors seemed attentive as they heard the 90-minute lead-off argument from Campoamor, followed by two hours from Murphy and an additional 30 minutes from McCullough.\n\nMcCullough closed his argument by displaying, over a defense objection, a rudimentary image of a puzzle with two missing pieces. He told jurors that they could still discern what was shown even with a few pieces missing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s missing a couple pieces and it\u2019s frustrating,\u201d the prosecutor said. \u201cDo not get distracted by all of the other things that we\u2019ve gone through that might be interesting to know.\u201d\n\nA steady stream of friends and family members have been in court to support Craig during the trial. Among them for the crucial closing arguments Tuesday was David Kendall, a longtime attorney for Bill and Hillary Clinton. Kendall and Craig were former law partners at Williams & Connolly and worked closely together defending President Clinton from impeachment.\n\nDuring breaks in the arguments Tuesday, Craig chatted with some of his well-wishers in the gallery. He also received an enthusiastic hug from Murphy just after the defense lawyer wound up his lengthy oration to the jury with a plea to \u201crestore Greg Craig to his colleagues, his family, and his friends and salvage his reputation.\u201d\n\nAt least two members of Mueller\u2019s team were also on hand for the pivotal court session Tuesday: prosecutor Adam Jed and a key FBI agent in the prosecution against Manafort, Brock Domin.\n\n\n\n", "description": "But Craig\u2019s lawyer says he simply wouldn\u2019t lie to the government.", "authors": ["Josh Gerstein"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/9f/45/6df3909649f8950af503dae81659/190903-greg-craig-gty-773.jpg"}
