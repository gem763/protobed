But despite their differences, subscribers to each appear to have settled on a common theme: Trump voters backed their candidate because they felt their social standing had become precarious, and believed that he could somehow restore it. So far, he\u2019s responded like many of his detractors predicted he would. He has implemented the cruelest border-security agenda in recent memory and used his platform to enrich himself, his family, and their allies. His inexperience with governing \u2014 he\u2019s never held public office and was best known previously for real estate and reality TV \u2014 has resulted in striking and sometimes dangerous ineptitude, as his failed effort to fund his border wall by shutting down the government and needless saber-rattling toward North Korea and Iran illustrate.\n\nNone of these deficiencies were unforeseeable, nor do they seem especially troubling to many of his supporters. They might even be endearing: At least one study suggests that a small but influential contingent of Trump acolytes takes pleasure in chaos and revels in the president\u2019s lies while conducting their own online misinformation campaigns. Even those who feel differently aren\u2019t especially put off \u2014 Trump\u2019s approval ratings among his fellow Republicans have rarely dipped below 80 percent since he took office. In 2016, he won white voters across gender, age, and income levels by healthy margins, and if he wins again in 2020, it will likely be with a similar coalition. That so many whites and Republicans, a party which is overwhelmingly white, have responded to the alleged perception of lost social standing by electing the most visibly unhinged, inexperienced, and insecure candidate in the field speaks volumes about their cost-benefit analysis \u2014 but might say even more about their fellow voters who also faced uncertain futures but responded differently.\n\nSpecifically, there are few measures by which black Americans aren\u2019t traditionally among the most socially and financially precarious. From median income and homeownership to employment, education, and arrest and incarceration rates, most social indexes find black people at or near the bottom and whites at the top. This is exacerbated by black Americans\u2019 long-term role as political punching bags \u2014 from their Reagan-era casting as leeches bleeding government coffers dry to the Bush- and Clinton-era crackdowns on black poverty, despair, and addiction through harsher policing and imprisonment. Trump, for his part, has vacillated between describing black people as filth-dwellers of questionable citizenship and lambasting black luminaries for protesting racism and not thanking him loudly enough for all the things he thinks he\u2019s done for their communities. Yet there\u2019s been no comparable gravitation by black voters en masse toward a bigoted autocrat vowing retributive violence against their political opponents. On the contrary, black voters have overwhelmingly embraced pragmatism \u2014 sometimes to a fault.\n\nThe Trump presidency \u2014 as with plenty before it \u2014 is as amenable as any to radical countermeasures by black people. Instead, polls indicate that black primary voters are coalescing behind Joe Biden, whom many believe has the best odds of defeating the Republican in 2020. \u201cWe just want to win,\u201d Michael Nutter, the black former mayor of Philadelphia, told Politico earlier this month, explaining why black voters are backing Biden early despite the abundance of younger, nonwhite, and more progressive options. \u201cBecause Donald Trump is so damaging and so frightening to many people in this country \u2026 the primary theme is, \u2018I just want to be with someone who I believe can actually win.\u2019 And that\u2019s what people care about.\u201d The tradeoff is significant: Biden\u2019s history of cozy relationships with segregationists is not just well known \u2014 he\u2019s boasted about it. As a senator, he authored the 1994 crime bill that lent federal sanction to mass-incarceration efforts nationwide, which affected black people disproportionately. His various gaffes \u2014 calling then-presidential candidate Barack Obama \u201cthe first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean\u201d; saying that \u201c[poor] kids are just as bright and just as talented as white kids\u201d \u2014 not only cast doubt on his understanding of how racism manifests in political discourse, but his political instincts more generally. But the tradeoff has also occasioned what might on its surface appear to be strange bedfellows: Biden\u2019s early polling lead is driven by support from both black voters and Democrats more likely to hold racist and sexist views than their counterparts who support Senators Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and Kamala Harris \u2014 the three who, along with Biden, round out the top four candidates in most polls.\n\nAccording to a Washington Post analysis from last week, \u201cracial resentment\u201d followed by \u201chostile sexism\u201d are the voter priorities that best predict Democratic-primary support for Biden. The metric also includes categories like abortion rights, increasing taxes on the rich, adopting clean and renewable energy by 2035, and Medicare for All. The presence of racist and sexist views was determined by a questionnaire developed by psychologists to detect animus via indirect means, in order to prevent respondents from \u201cdefaulting to answers that they know are socially preferred.\u201d These include queries about whether respondents believe that slavery and segregation have made progress difficult for black people; whether black people should learn to work and live without \u201cspecial favors\u201d; and whether \u201cwomen seek to gain power by getting control over men.\u201d The correlation between these hostile or resentful views and support for Biden was more dramatic than in any other included category. This is not to say that the majority of Biden supporters hold such views. But the Post\u2019s data indicates they\u2019re significantly more likely to than their counterparts.\n\nThere is, of course, precedent for black voters making peace with racist allies when faced with less-desirable \u2014 and often more racist \u2014 alternatives. Most recently, Virginia governor Ralph Northam and state Attorney General Mark Harris weathered simultaneous blackface scandals but retained black support; Republican control of state politics in the wake of them resigning was the other option. And there are other factors driving their support for Biden: That younger black voters prefer Sanders while older ones back Obama\u2019s former vice-president likely stems from generational disagreements about the salience of uncompromising progressivism and the goodwill generated by the first black presidency. But in neither case are black voters backing a radical or someone vowing violence. In fact, most are supporting the candidate whose experience and record are best-known to them, and who they feel presents the least possibility for error. Whether they\u2019ve arrived at the right conclusion, even by those metrics, is debatable, and there\u2019s plenty of time for things to change \u2014 the Democratic primaries are still months away. But so far, black voter behavior leading up to 2020 is a damning indictment of white voter behavior in 2016. The majority of white voters saw a flicker of precariousness and threw the Election Day equivalent of a tantrum. Black people \u2014 for whom precariousness is, in a disproportionate share of cases, a persistent condition \u2014 have responded by reinvesting in a status quo that\u2019s rarely worked for them, knowing intimately how much worse things can get.", "description": "Joe Biden\u2019s early 2020 support from black voters testifies to the pragmatism informing their decision.
