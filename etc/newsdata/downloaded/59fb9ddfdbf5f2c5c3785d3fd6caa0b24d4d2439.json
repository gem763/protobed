But, thanks to modern health codes, barbers these days don\u2019t really use those traditional straight razors with a fixed blade, because laws ban them from using the same blade on multiple clients. If you\u2019re getting a \u201cstraight-razor shave\u201d at a barbershop today, your barber is probably using something called a \u201cshavette,\u201d or a disposable straight razor, which is basically a blade holder that accommodates a disposable, single-edge metal blade. A shavette essentially offers the same quality of shave as a straight razor, according to the barbers we spoke with, who say the newer technology is much lower maintenance, as the fresh blades for each shave, unlike a fixed one, don\u2019t need to be sharpened. Using a shavette will also be less expensive, according to master barber Angelo Ruscetta: \u201cIf you want a nice clean shave and want that nostalgia, with a shavette, you\u2019re straight-razor shaving without the big cost.\u201d\n\nThe barbers we talked to say using either a traditional straight razor or a shavette offers benefits over other methods of shaving. For instance, straight razors and shavettes give you complete control over a blade, while safety razors offer only partial control and cartridge razors offer none at all. \u201cWith a straight razor, you can really adjust your angle, so you can get a little more aggressive\u201d or go light, Ruscetta says. Straight razors are also really great for shaping beards, he adds, because \u201cyou can really see [and control] where you\u2019re cutting.\u201d However, it does take some time and patience to master the technique. If you\u2019re thinking about trying it yourself, you should heed master barber Julien Howard, who suggests this classic barber-school training tip before putting the blade to your actual face: Inflate a balloon, cover it with shaving cream, and \u201cshave\u201d it off with the razor. \u201cIf you pop the balloon, you\u2019re probably going to cut yourself,\u201d he says. To find the best straight razors and shavettes, we talked to Howard, Ruscetta, and seven other barbers. Read on for their picks \u2014 which are heavy on shavettes, because those are the tools they told us they use every day, but include a few traditional straight razors, too.\n\nBest overall shavette straight razor\n\nDovo Silver Shavette Satin Finish Straight Razor It should come as no surprise that barbers have strong opinions on razors. The nine we spoke with for this article didn\u2019t overlap a lot in their recommendations, but certain brands came up more than others. German company Dovo, which is famous for its traditional straight razors, was the most mentioned of all, with five barbers recommending the brand. Two of those barbers specifically recommended this Dovo shavette, and, as Ruscetta notes, shavettes are a better option for beginners who want to try straight-razor shaving at home. Heather Manto, owner of Austin\u2019s Independence Barber Co., says this shavette is her go-to when doing hot-towel shaves, because it\u2019s \u201clightweight and easy to control.\u201d She also likes that \u201cthe holder and handle are stainless steel, so it will last many years.\u201d (Dovo does make this in a less expensive plastic-handled version, but most of the experts favor metal shavettes for their durability and weight.) This shavette comes with two inserts \u2014 one for standard-length shorter blades, which Manto says she prefers, and one for longer blades. Howard, too, recommends this one. He likes that it\u2019s \u201cGerman-made\u201d and says that the red plastic piece \u201cadds a little guard, like a safety razor.\u201d $37 at Amazon Buy $37 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest (less expensive) shavette straight razor\n\nParker SRX Stainless-Steel Shavette Straight Razor (With 5 Shark Blades) $25 (was $35, now 29% off) Ruscetta, who has tried the above Dovo, told us he prefers Parker\u2019s all-metal stainless-steel shavette, which is what he uses on all his clients. In addition to costing about a third the price of the overall-best Dovo, this style, with a metal body Ruscetta likes, \u201chas some weight.\u201d But his favorite feature is how it \u201clocks in blades\u201d tighter than any other shavette he\u2019s tried. \u201cThe blade snaps in between these two pieces, and it really holds it tight,\u201d Ruscetta says. He points out that, in general, it\u2019s just really well constructed, and the details are carefully considered, and \u201cthe two posts that hold the blade are made out of copper, so you know that\u2019ll last a long time.\u201d $25 at Amazon Buy $25 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest (even less expensive) shavette straight razor\n\nClassic Samurai Stainless-Steel Shavette Straight Razor (With 100 Derby Blades) Another folding metal shavette, and even less expensive than the Parker, this comes recommended by Ralph Wilburn, senior barber at Fellow Barber\u2019s Chelsea Market location. \u201cI\u2019ve used this on clients for years. It\u2019s fully metal so it lasts forever,\u201d he says, adding that he always recommends going with something heavier and made out of metal, no matter the brand. \u201cI like them made out of metal because they have a little weight. Some are fully plastic, which I personally think is too light. You need a certain amount of pressure, and the weight of the metal helps.\u201d As a bonus, this already well-priced shavette comes with a box of 100 single-edge blades from Derby, one of our experts\u2019 favorite blade manufacturers (more on those below). $14 at Amazon Buy $14 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest made-in-Japan shavette straight razors\n\nFeather Artist Club SS Straight-Handle Straight Razor We know that shoppers can get particular about the origins of their products (see our Made in Japan, France, and Korea series). So if you\u2019re keen on buying Japanese, you might consider Feather, the Japan-based razor company that came second to Dovo in terms of how often experts praised the label (three of our barbers named the brand as a generally superior maker of shaving products). Each of those barbers, however, mentioned a different model in Feather\u2019s Artist Club SS line of shavettes, which they say is very popular in their profession. One of the things Feather is famous for is its ultrasharp double-edge blades, and razors in the Artist Club line only work with blades made specifically by Feather. Some might see this lack of flexibility as a downside, but most barbers trust the company, especially when it comes to razor blades. \u201cFeather is the best. They know what they\u2019re doing,\u201d says Howard. The blades made for Feather razors are also longer than the standard single-edge blades most shavettes take. A representative from The Barber Soho told us that their barbers use a shavette from Feather\u2019s professional-focused Artist Club DX line that\u2019s very similar to this model. The DX is generally thought to give a more aggressive shave because it lacks the SS\u2019s rounded metal blade-holder, but both take the same blades and have the same straight handle \u2014 which, unlike the other shavettes we\u2019ve named thus far, does not fold. Some barbers feel the straight handle gives them more control, but they say that whether you use a straight or folding handle ultimately comes down to personal preference. $59 at Amazon Buy $59 at Amazon Buy\n\nFeather Artist Club SS Folding-Handle Straight Razor If you think you\u2019d prefer a folding shavette, this model, also from Feather\u2019s SS Artist Club line, comes recommended by Brian Porteous, owner of Heritage Barbershop in Portland, Oregon. \u201cI use this for any straight-razor shaving I do in the shop,\u201d he says. Porteous prefers the folding version because it\u2019s safer to store and tuck away, and he likes that the metal head is heavier than the rest of the razor \u201cso it gives it a little more weight.\u201d He\u2019s also a fan of the Feather Artist Club blades, which he says are thicker than other blades (more on them below.) $59 at Amazon Buy $59 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest traditional straight razors\n\nDovo Inox Straight Razor With Olive Wood Handle 5/8 Inch As far as traditional straight razors are concerned, Dovo was again recommended more than any other brand, with three experts saying it makes some of the best. According to Arthur Iskhakov, owner of Barber\u2019s Blueprint in New York, \u201cDovo is the top brand when it comes to straight razors.\u201d For those looking to buy their first traditional straight razor, Iskhakov would recommend a 5/8-inch-thick blade, like this model, which he says is essentially the standard blade size for a good straight razor. Regarding the maintenance of blades on a traditional straight razor, there is a lot to say. Ruscetta gave us some pointers: You should sharpen the blade about once per year, and he recommends sending it out to a specialist (most knife-sharpening services can handle straight razors). If you want to do it yourself, he says to use a \u201ccombination Norton stone with 4,000 grit on one side and 8,000 grit on the other.\u201d Ruscetta adds that, while it might seem unnecessary, \u201cstropping\u201d with a leather strop before each use is essential. \u201cEvery time you use the razor, you get microscopic bends in the razor,\u201d but the strop \u201cstraightens out\u201d those tiny bends, and you can really feel the difference when you shave, he explains. He says any standard strop should work; just make sure it\u2019s at least an inch thick. $160 at Amazon Buy $161 at West Coast Shaving Buy\n\nDOVO Bizmark Straight Razor With Ebony Wood Handle 6/8 Inch $188 (was $275, now 32% off) Ruscetta loves traditional straight razors, too, and while his favorite manufacturer of all time is the now-extinct Dorko, he agrees Dovo is one of the best companies currently producing them. He prefers a slightly thicker blade, because he feels \u201cthe weight gives a more comfortable shave,\u201d and recommends this model with a hefty 6/8-inch-thick blade. $188 at Amazon Buy $188 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest disposable razor blades for shavette straight razors\n\nDerby Professional Single Edge Razor Blades (100 Count) Our barbers mentioned Derby\u2019s disposable shavette blades more than any other brand\u2019s, with four telling us these are their go-to \u2014 and an industry standard in most barbershops. $5 at Amazon Buy $5 at Amazon Buy\n\nFeather Artist Club Professional Single Edge Razor Blades (20 Count) $9 (was $13, now 31% off) The three experts who recommended Feather straight razors all told us that they love Feather\u2019s Artist Club disposable blades, which are specially designed to work with all of Feather\u2019s shavette straight razors. $9 at Amazon Buy $9 at Amazon Buy\n\nShark \u201cSaloon\u201d Single Edge Razor Blades (100 Count) Ruscetta says these \u201cSaloon\u201d shark blades are his favorite, because they\u2019re thicker than the other brands he\u2019s tried out. $5 at Amazon Buy $5 at Amazon Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
