While the board expressed its continued support for Muilenburg, it pledged \u201cactive oversight\u201d of his performance, a sign of the pressure he\u2019s under to surmount regulatory hurdles and soothe the safety concerns of customers, pilots and passengers.\n\nLead director David Calhoun, a senior executive at Blackstone Group Inc., will take over as non-executive chairman. Calhoun, 62, a former boss of General Electric Co.\u2019s aviation division, stands out on the board for his deep aerospace experience and has been mentioned in years past as a contender for Boeing\u2019s CEO job.\n\n\u201cIt provides stability and continuity but also introduces a new approach to leadership,\u201d said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst at Teal Group. \u201cIt\u2019s not a huge move in itself, but it creates the potential for a much bigger move.\u201d\n\nMuilenburg, 55, is under increasing scrutiny as the global flying ban on the Max nears the seven-month mark, with little clarity on when Boeing\u2019s best-selling jet will return to service. The planemaker\u2019s reputation and finances have been battered since two Max crashes killed 346 people and prompted a worldwide grounding.\n\nThe shares were little changed after the close of regular trading in New York, having advanced 1.1% to $374.92 in the Friday session. Boeing slumped after the flying ban began in March, but the stock has climbed 17% since mid-August as investors bet that the Max would soon return to service. That\u2019s the biggest gain on the Dow Jones Industrial Average over that period.\n\n\u2018Full Confidence\u2019\n\nThe board will soon add a director who will serve on a new safety panel, Calhoun said in the statement. The Aerospace Safety Committee is part of a board-ordered safety push.\n\n\u201cThe board has full confidence in Dennis as CEO,\u201d he said.\n\nMuilenburg, 55, said he was \u201cfully supportive\u201d of the change.\n\n\u201cOur entire team is laser-focused on returning the 737 Max safely to service and delivering on the full breadth of our company\u2019s commitments,\u201d he said in the statement. He took the reins as CEO in July 2015 and added the chairmanship in March 2016.\n\nGovernance Activists\n\nCorporate-governance activists had already been clamoring to separate the chairman and CEO positions.\n\nBoeing opposed a proposal to divide the roles at the annual meeting earlier this year, saying directors should be able to select their leadership structure rather than be bound by an \u201cinflexible policy.\u201d Investors rejected the measure but it won 27% support, up from 20% the year before, including abstentions and non-votes.\n\nShareholder activist John Chevedden filed a proposal Oct. 9 to raise the matter again at Boeing\u2019s 2020 annual meeting. Directors would have the discretion to phase in an independent chairman, \u201calthough it would be better to have an immediate transition,\u201d the measure said.\n\nThe Max\u2019s return continues to slip amid scrutiny from sometimes fractious regulators. Until recent weeks, Boeing had insisted the plane would be cleared early in the fourth quarter. But the Max\u2019s three U.S. operators -- Southwest Airlines Co., United Airlines Holdings Inc. and American Airlines Group Inc. -- have taken the single-aisle jet out of their flight schedules until January.\n\nA longer delay would jeopardize Muilenburg\u2019s position as CEO, said Aboulafia.\n\n\u201cIf they\u2019re on course for re-certification in the fourth quarter as they maintain, then he could hang on,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it slips much beyond that, then his job is definitely at risk.\u201d\n\nBoeing Lifer\n\nAn aerospace engineer by training and Boeing lifer, the CEO has served as the company\u2019s public face throughout the Max crisis. That\u2019s made him a target of critics who contend that Boeing was too slow to fully explain the role its flight-control software played in the crashes.\n\nMuilenburg will have two critical chances to shape perceptions about his handling of the crisis this month: When third-quarter results are released on Oct. 23 and when he testifies before Congress a week later.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Boeing Co. stripped Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg of his role as chairman, leaving him little margin for error in his final push to resolve the crisis engulfing the company\u2019s 737 Max jetliner.Separating the CEO and chairman roles will let Muilenburg focus on getting the grounded", "authors": ["Julie Johnsson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
