NO!\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cWe must determine the Whistleblower\u2019s identity to determine WHY this was done to the USA.\u201d\n\nTrump has repeatedly called on House Democrats to reveal the identity of the whistleblower. \u201cI do not know why a person that defrauds at the American public should be protected,\u201d the president tweeted on Wednesday.\n\nThe whistleblower initially came forward with concerns about a July phone conversation between Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky based on second hand accounts of the discussion. Trump subsequently released a transcript of the call revealing that he asked Zelensky to investigate corruption allegations against Joe Biden.\n\nDays before the July conversation, Trump delayed a military aid package earmarked by Congress for Ukraine. The timing has caused Democrats to suspect that Trump withheld the aid package to pressure Ukraine to conduct an investigation damaging to his political rival.\n\nTrump has called the Democrats\u2019 accusations a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d and a \u201choax.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, a second whistleblower who reportedly has direct knowledge of the conversation between Trump and Zelensky has come forward, and is being represented by the same legal team as the initial whistleblower.\n\nMore from National Review", "description": "House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff (D., Calif.) announced on Sunday that the whistleblower at the center of an impeachment inquiry into President Trump may not testify before Congress due to concerns over the person's safety.\"Our primary interest right now is making sure that", "authors": ["Zachary Evans"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/wnRw00NbGS5BcjDciRw8PA--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://slick-prod.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/slick_thumb/yahooNews-311078-1571075283790.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
