I can\u2019t control an industry, but I can sure stand up and say, \u2018This isn\u2019t cool.\u2019\u201d\n\nDr. Cleary says he only began to learn of his numerous biological offspring in March of 2018, when two of his biological daughters contacted him. The two women said they were able to identify him with the help of Ancestry.com as well as \u201cspecific and substantive information\u201d from the clinic, according to the lawsuit.\n\nMoney and numbers\n\nThe discovery prompted Dr. Cleary to send his DNA to Ancestry.com, which led him to uncover fifteen other children. Most of them live in Oregon and he has now met three of them. In the press conference, he noted that there may be even more children.\n\nA spokesperson for OHSU released a statement saying only that \u201cOHSU treats any allegation of misconduct with the gravity it deserves. In light of our patient privacy obligations and the confidentiality of protected health information, we cannot comment on this case.\u201d\n\nAt the news conference Wednesday, Dr. Cleary sat next to one of his biological children conceived through the clinic, 25-year-old Allysen Allee, who lives in Vancouver. Allee said she didn\u2019t plan on suing OHSU but was disturbed by the case.\n\n\u201cIt feels like OHSU really didn\u2019t take into consideration the fact that they were creating humans,\" she said. \"They were reckless with this, and it feels like it was just money and numbers to them.\"\n\nDr. Cleary said he only donated his sperm 30 years ago after the clinic solicited him and his fellow first-year medical school classmates, offering $40 for a donation.\n\nIn his lawsuit, filed in Multnomah County Circuit Court, Cleary says he is \u201cprofoundly distressed\u201d and is grappling with the \u201cmoral, legal, ethical, and personal obligations\u201d to his many children.", "description": "Some go to the same school as the kids he has with his wife.", "authors": ["Beth Mole"], "top_image": "https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/GettyImages-460716005-760x380.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
