Toiletry bags were sewn in, as well as several pairs of pants to provide extra storage.\n\n\u201cSecurity wasn\u2019t an issue, I just put it in the tray,\u201d he told The Independent.\n\n\u201cThe worry and the nerves were something else, but I got to the gate and boarded the plane with zero issues.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThere\u2019d be no hesitation in doing it in future or recommending other people give it a go. It\u2019s not so much the cost even, but you don\u2019t have to wait for your bag to be offloaded at the other end. It saves time and money.\u201d", "description": "A passenger whose luggage exceeded the weight limit at the airport took an innovative approach to avoid paying the hefty excess baggage charges.
