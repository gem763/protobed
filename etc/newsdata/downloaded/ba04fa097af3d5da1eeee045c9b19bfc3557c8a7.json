We don't need Middle Eastern Oil & Gas, & in fact have very few tankers there, but will help our Allies!\" tweeted the president.\n\nHowever, although the US imports less Saudi oil than it used to, it still receives 9% of its supply from the country. It is also debatable whether Trump is personally responsible for the change.\n\nTrump issued the tweet after attacks on two oil facilities in eastern Saudi Arabia on Saturday caused global oil prices to spiral. Iran has denied the accusations by the US it was behind the attack.\n\nIn January, the US Energy Department said that the boom in US oil and gas production would make the US a net energy exporter by 2020. According to some reports, the US has been the larger global energy producer since 2014, about halfway through Barack Obama's second term.\n\nThe sources of the boom are in the shale oil revolution, which began last decade.\n\nBut experts say that the US still won't be fully energy independent in 2020, because its refineries rely on the medium and heavy crude oils found overseas, not just the lighter crude oil extracted in the US.\n\nRecent US government figures, dated to 2018, say that the US imports around 900,000 barrels of Saudi oil per day, 9% of its total imports. The same figures say that 16% of US oil comes from the Persian Gulf region, and 29% from OPEC countries.\n\n\"Until the US refining sector is able to process more lighter crudes, we're never going to have energy independence,\" Joe McMonigle, a former Energy Department official under President George W. Bush, told CNN.", "description": "The President wrote \"We don't need Middle Eastern Oil & Gas\" \u2014 a statement contradicted by figures showing continued US imports from the region.", "authors": ["Tom Porter"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7f76832e22af0ed34ec1b8-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
