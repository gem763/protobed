But I\u2019ve been working hard and obviously it\u2019s a massively proud moment for me and my family.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t really too nervous. It\u2019s a game of football so it\u2019s something that I\u2019ve done all my life. When you come on, you just want to get on the ball, have your first touch, get that out the way and then try to influence the game. It\u2019s been a crazy last couple of months. Making my debut for Chelsea, and now being called up to the England squad and making my debut today. It has been a blur.\u201d\n\nMount was an unused substitute in last October\u2019s Nations League doubleheader against Croatia and Spain, but there was no sense of frustration from the playmaker \u2013 especially as that led his debut to be extra special.\n\nRice was still a Republic of Ireland international back then, but his subsequent switch to the country of his birth meant the West Ham midfielder was on the field when his former Chelsea youth team-mate entered the fray.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve obviously known each other for a very, very long time and always speaking about maybe that opportunity of playing with each other again,\u201d Mount said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s obviously happened today so I went over to him straight away and just said \u2018well done, we\u2019re back on the pitch together\u2019, so, yeah, looking forward to the future now.\u201d\n\nAsked if lifting silverware was the ultimate dream for the pair, he told beIN SPORTS: \u201cYeah, of course. And I think the group we\u2019ve got, the young group, I think we\u2019re definitely working towards that. So hopefully in the next, I don\u2019t know months or years we, can achieve something.\u201d\n\nMount will be hoping to get another chance to impress when England host Kosovo in Southampton on Tuesday evening.\n\nGareth Southgate told the post-match press conference that the 20-year-old has already shown to be \u201ca threat to the starting team\u201d and was quick to go over to the player at full-time.\n\n\u201cHe just said congratulations for making your debut and well done,\u201d Mount added. \u201cAll the boys came up to me after the game in the dressing room saying well done.\n\n\u201cYou can feel how tight the group is. It\u2019s a young group, fired up to win games and to learn. I felt it was very nice and to have all the boys around me.\u201d", "description": "Mason Mount was elated to not only have fulfilled his childhood dream but also make his England debut alongside best friend Declan Rice.
