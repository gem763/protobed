Under the terms of the 1997 handover, Hong Kong was meant to enjoy a high degree of autonomy, including certain freedoms not enjoyed in mainland China. But critics believe those freedoms have been eroded.\n\nChina has called the handover agreement signed by the UK and China, the Joint Declaration, a \u201chistorical document\u201d with \u201cno practical significance\u201d.\n\nChinese officials have lashed out at the UK for signalling its support of Hong Kong. A UK foreign office spokeswoman in June said the document was a \u201clegally binding treaty \u2026 that remains as valid today as it was when it was signed\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Anti-government protesters hold up banners and Union Jack flags outside the British consulate in Hong Kong.

The passports, which replaced the British Dependent Territories Citizens passports held by three million people in the lead up to the 1997 handover, only grant the right to visit the UK for six months.\n\nLast weekend, thousands marched on the US consulate to call on US lawmakers to pass legislation that could potentially sanction Hong Kong officials, in an effort to step up pressure internationally for their cause.\n\nBeijing and pro-Beijing figures in Hong Kong have previously accused foreign powers like the US and the UK of secretly funding and organising the rallies.\n\nOn Saturday, democracy activist and former student leader of the 2014 umbrella movement in Hong Kong Joshua Wong called on US officials to include Hong Kong and a human rights clause in ongoing negotiations as the US and China try to resolve a long-running trade war.\n\n\u201cWe hope ... for bipartisan support,\u201d Wong told Reuters, adding that he hoped to convince lawmakers to pass the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, which would implement an annual review of Hong Kong\u2019s special status in terms of trade and investment from the US.\n\nDemonstrators vowed to defy a police ban on a previously planned march on Sunday, and were expected to collect in a popular shopping district, Causeway Bay, the site of several previous confrontations between police and protesters.\n\nRival protesters clashed in fist fights and scuffles in several locations in Hong Kong on Saturday, as pro-Beijing demonstrators staged rallies. Videos showed groups of men using a Chinese flag to beat younger residents. Groups of anti-government demonstrators were seen chasing and hitting people accused of spying on the protesters.", "description": "Protesters call on London to apply pressure on Beijing to uphold \u2018one country, two systems\u2019 agreed in 1997", "authors": ["Lily Kuo"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4580ac9760a695cd9eb8cfb582afeaa50554ccc9/0_22_5000_3001/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=46d08c01d9bf0fb2c9bc89e3922d1e34", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
