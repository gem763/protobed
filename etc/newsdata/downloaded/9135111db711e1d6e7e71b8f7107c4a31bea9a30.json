REUTERS/Stephane Mahe\n\nTrudeau came to power in 2015 promising \u201csunny ways\u201d and a new way of doing politics but saw his popularity drop earlier this year amid an ethics scandal. Images of him in blackface emerged last month, further hurting his Liberal Party ahead of the Oct. 21 election.\n\nThe 47-year-old prime minister, his voice increasingly hoarse, said Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer would slash spending and rip up Liberal plans to fight climate change.\n\nPolls show the Liberals and the Conservatives in a dead heat, with neither able to capture a majority of the 338 seats in the House of Commons. That would leave the party winning the most seats seeking support of smaller parties to govern.\n\n\u201cI know Canadians want a strong progressive government that would stop Conservative cuts,\u201d Trudeau told a rally in a fire station in the Ontario city of Hamilton, west of Toronto.\n\nIn the absence of an overriding narrative, dirty tactics and awkward moments have characterized the campaign.\n\nAnother example of that was on display on Saturday when People\u2019s Party of Canada (PPC) leader Maxime Bernier said his party was considering legal action against the Conservatives after the Globe and Mail newspaper reported that the latter had hired a consultant to \u201cseek and destroy\u201d the PPC party and try to get Bernier barred from televised leaders\u2019 debates.\n\n\u2018DIRTY POLITICS\u2019\n\nBernier, a former Conservative cabinet minister, lost the Conservative leadership race to Scheer in 2017 and started his own right-leaning party. Lagging far behind in polls, the PPC could still split some of the Conservative vote.\n\nRelated Coverage Dirty tactics and awkward moments dominate Canada's meandering campaign\n\n\u201cThis is the kind of dirty politics that confuse Canadians\u2019 faith in politics,\u201d Bernier said at a press conference in Sainte-Marie, Quebec. \u201cHe (Scheer) is ready to steal the election with lies and manipulations.\n\n\u201cWe have already filed a complaint with Elections Canada with our concerns about what the conservative party did. We are considering other (legal) avenues.\u201d\n\nScheer, speaking in Toronto, repeatedly refused to answer questions about the report, saying only: \u201cWe don\u2019t make comments on vendors that we may or may not have engaged with.\u201d\n\nAsked about the story, Trudeau said: \u201cConservatives have had to use the politics of fear and division and they just make stuff up.\u201d\n\nA Nanos Research poll for the Globe and Mail and CTV released on Saturday put the Liberals at 32.6% public support and the Conservatives at 30.3%. The left-leaning New Democrats, who compete for the same voters as the Liberals, were at 18.4%.\n\nTrudeau sidestepped questions about his plans if he did not win a majority. Minority governments in Canada rarely last more than two and a half years.\n\nScheer, speaking in Toronto, said Trudeau would spend his first 100 days negotiating a coalition with the New Democrats that would impose tax hikes.\n\n\u201cJustin Trudeau has made it clear he will pay any price to stay in power, and he will use your money to do it,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nThere has only been one coalition in Canadian history, in 1917 during World War One.\n\nThe Leader of Canada's Conservatives Andrew Scheer campaigns for the upcoming election in Toronto, Ontario Canada October 19, 2019.
