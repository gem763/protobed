Heddle Shipyards, where I\u2019m president, is ready to build six new ships for the Canadian Coast Guard but politicians in Ottawa seem to be rigging the procurement process to appease political insiders and raise political capital in Quebec.\n\nThe government of Canada is in the process of seeking a qualifying shipyard to become the third shipyard in the National Shipbuilding Strategy (NSS), a massive procurement program designed to rebuild the fleets of the Royal Canadian Navy and Canadian Coast Guard. Projections for the total spend on the NSS are now over $100 billion, making it the largest single taxpayer expense in our country\u2019s history. The shipyard that qualifies as the third yard will have the opportunity to bid on the construction of six icebreakers for the Canadian Coast Guard, a project that on its own is valued in the billions. These are very high stakes for taxpayers.\n\nSeveral of the requirements the government initially set for shipyards wanting to qualify as bidders for this NSS project were patently unreasonable and appeared to indicate bias against Ontario-based applicants. The most blatant of these, since corrected, was the ability to launch a vessel greater than 24 metres in breadth. This would have disqualified all Ontario-based shipyards, which have to use Seaway locks 23.8 metres wide \u2014 even though the icebreakers to be built will be required to navigate the very same locks in and out of the Great Lakes.\n\nThese questionable requirements, in combination with comments by politicians and executives at Quebec-based Davie shipyard, are the basis for our concern that the process was designed to favour Davie, which is located east of the size-restricted lock system. Believing the procurement process was not \u201cfair, open and transparent,\u201d our company submitted a complaint to the Canadian International Trade Tribunal (CITT). Last month, the government moved to dismiss the Tribunal\u2019s investigation of it by invoking a \u201cnational-security exception,\u201d which meant it did not have to adhere to Canadian trade or procurement laws and could not be subject to further CITT complaint or inquiry. No explanation of possible national security concerns was given, Ottawa having changed the rules this summer so it did not have to provide one.\n\nThat the federal government has invoked national security to justify circumventing oversight on a competitive procurement process should concern all Canadians. Eliminating oversight and competition on procurements can only inflate costs. Our Coast Guard\u2019s budget is not limitless. It needs to get the greatest possible value for its dollar. The massive costs, cost overruns and delays that the federal government has incurred on major marine procurements recently \u2014 especially on projects not subject to competitive bidding \u2014 suggests value for money has not been its highest priority.\n\nAt the moment, the biggest challenge in delivering new ships on schedule is a straightforward lack of Canadian shipbuilding capacity. The only two shipyards currently qualified in the NSS, Irving in Halifax and Seaspan in Vancouver, are operating with decades\u2019 worth of backlog, while Davie recently acquired a big backlog through sole-sourced contracts. The Coast Guard needs ships ASAP. The idea that only three shipyards, each with a significant backlog, can deliver what\u2019s needed on time is unreasonable.\n\nRather than repeat the mistakes of the past, the government should consider adding a fourth qualified shipyard. Doing so would make the \u201cNational\u201d Shipbuilding Strategy truly national, with shipyards on the east and west coasts, in Quebec and also in Ontario, a province so far largely neglected in the strategy. If for some reason four shipyards is not an option, then shipyards other than Davie should be given a \u201cfair, open and transparent\u201d opportunity to compete for the third spot in the NSS.\n\nWe see ourselves as part of the solution. Heddle has been in operation since 1987. In 2016 we purchased the Thunder Bay Shipyard, a storied shipbuilding facility that once employed over a thousand people. In 2017 we entered a long-term lease to operate the Port Weller Dry Docks. Port Weller was once the most prominent shipbuilding facility in Canada, employing approximately 2,000 people. Some of the largest icebreakers ever built in this country were built there. As this is written, we are preparing to launch the CCGS Pierre Radisson from the deep dock at Port Weller after a major refit and overhaul. The Radisson has roughly the same dimensions as the six new proposed icebreakers.\n\nHeddle is not a giant company but we have formed a joint venture with Damen Shipyards from the Netherlands, arguably the most successful shipbuilder in the world. Damen has designed, built and delivered over 6,500 vessels to clients in over 100 countries, including Canada. It is currently at work on one of the largest and most sophisticated icebreakers ever built, the RSV Nuyina, which the government of Australia will operate in Antarctica. Damen\u2019s transfer of knowledge, technology and experience to Heddle will immediately expand capacity in Canada and help deliver icebreakers on time and at a cost that makes sense for taxpayers.\n\nWe intend to continue our fight for fair and open competition for Canada\u2019s Shipbuilding Strategy. Competition will benefit Heddle, to be sure, but it will also benefit our employees and suppliers in Ontario and on the east coast, the sailors of the Canadian Coast Guard who desperately need new vessels, and, maybe most importantly, Canadian taxpayers, who ultimately pay for the lack of competition resulting from a policy agenda that is not in their best interest.\n\nShaun Padulo is president of Heddle Shipyards.", "description": "Opinion: Canadian taxpayers ultimately pay for the lack of competition resulting from a policy agenda that is not in their best interest", "authors": ["Shaun Padulo", "Special To Financial Post"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/ships.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
