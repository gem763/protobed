Dikicioglu had a Rottweiler growing up, and was looking to get her own dog out of college. For the first two years, Scout was relatively low cost.\n\nThat was until a friend's birthday party, where a much larger dog unexpectedly came lunging towards Scout, taking hold of Scout's tiny paw and \"completely snapping it.\"\n\n\"It was the loudest yelp I've ever heard,\" she said.\n\nScout got an X-ray, revealing a group of grain-sized broken bones. Dikicioglu was in her mid-20s, a couple of years out of college and starting her career in advertising, and was \"freaking out,\" about how to pay for the necessary surgery.\n\n\"It's unconditional love \u2014 I never would have even hesitated to try and figure out a way to pay for it,\" she said. \"I was like okay, what do we need to do, and when are we going to do it?\"\n\nShe opted for CareCredit, a relatively unknown financing option to non-pet-parents but a staple in more than 90% of veterinary offices across the country. It's owned by Synchrony Financial, the Stamford Connecticut-based firm that also powers credit cards for Amazon, Lowe's, Sam's Club and PayPal.\n\nSynchrony executives anticipate Americans becoming even more obsessed with their dogs and cats\u2014 a trend they call the \"humanization of pets \u2014 and are looking to the booming animal care market for its next leg of growth.", "description": "Synchrony Financial is betting on the billion dollar pet-financing market through CareCredit.", "authors": ["Kate Rooney"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106032035-1563797507479gettyimages-694935984.jpeg?v=1567186683", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
