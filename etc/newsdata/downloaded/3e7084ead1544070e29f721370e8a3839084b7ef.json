Instead, the trade war has clearly hurt U.S. manufacturing. Indeed, it has done considerably more damage than even Trump critics like yours truly expected.\n\n[For an even deeper look at what\u2019s on Paul Krugman\u2019s mind, sign up for his weekly newsletter.]\n\nThe Trumpist trade warriors, it turns out, missed two key points. First, many U.S. manufacturers depend heavily on imported parts and other inputs; the trade war is disrupting their supply chains. Second, Trump\u2019s trade policy isn\u2019t just protectionist, it\u2019s erratic, creating vast uncertainty for businesses both here and abroad. And businesses are responding to that uncertainty by putting plans for investment and job creation on hold.\n\nSo the tweeter in chief has bungled his way into a Trump slump, even if it isn\u2019t a full-blown recession, at least so far. It\u2019s clearly going to hurt him politically, notably because of the contrast between his big talk and not-so-great reality. Also, the pain in manufacturing seems to be falling especially hard on those swing states Trump took by tiny margins in 2016, giving him the Electoral College despite losing the popular vote.\n\nAnd while many presidents have found themselves confronting politically damaging economic adversity, Trump is, as I said, unique in that he really did this to himself.\n\nOf course, that doesn\u2019t mean that he will accept responsibility for his mistakes. For the past few months he has been trying to portray the Federal Reserve as the root of all economic evil, even though current interest rates are well below those his own officials predicted in their triumphalist economic projections.\n\nMy guess, however, is that Fed-bashing will prove ineffective as a political strategy, not least because most Americans probably have at best a vague idea of what the Fed is and what it does.\n\nSo what will come next? Trump being Trump, it\u2019s a good bet that he\u2019ll soon be denouncing troubling economic data as fake news; I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see political pressure on the statistical agencies to report better numbers. Hey, if it can happen to the National Weather Service, why not the Bureau of Economic Analysis (which reports, by the way, to Wilbur Ross)?", "description": "And he has only himself to blame.", "authors": ["Paul Krugman"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/03/opinion/03krugmanWeg/03krugmanWeg-facebookJumbo.jpg"}
