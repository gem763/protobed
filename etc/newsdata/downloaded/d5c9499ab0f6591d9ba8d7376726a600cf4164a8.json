But this is the first time it published their ratio at all publicly listed ones.\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family on Wednesday, only 1,199 of 29,794 executives at 2,072 publicly listed companies are women. Some 1,407 or 67.9 percent of those companies have no female executives at all.\n\nAt the top 500 companies only, the proportion of female executives is even smaller at 3.6 percent, though the proportion that have none at all is also lower at 62 percent.\n\nSome 498 female executives take up again around four percent of 12,370 executive board members with voting rights. The proportion of female outside directors stands at just 3.1 percent, suggesting companies have no great interest in calling in the expertise of women.\n\nChang Mi-hye at the Korea Women's Development Institute said, \"The low percentage of female decision-makers in the private sector is a factor that seriously impairs gender equality in Korea, even as women are now better educated than men.\"", "description": "Minute Proportion of Corporate Execs Are Women", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://english.chosun.com/site/data/img_dir/2019/10/17/2019101701523_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
