That\u2019s the kind of pushback I thought was desirable,\u201d Dudley said.\n\nDudley created a firestorm earlier in the month when he suggested in a blog-post the Fed might take Trump\u2019s 2020 election prospects into consideration when setting interest-rate policy.\n\nDudley has tried to clarify this remark, saying in the Bloomberg interview he did not want Powell and his colleagues to take the re-election into account.\n\nRead: Dudley: I picked a fight with Trump because the Fed didn\u2019t stand up for itself\n\nDudley said that the Fed has already become \u201cpoliticized\u201d from the president\u2019s tweets.\n\nHe cited a new academic study, released Monday by the National Bureau for Economic Research, that concluded the president\u2019s tweets were causing investors to lower their expected path for interest rates.\n\n\u201cPeople are not sure now if the Fed is easing because that is the appropriate policy path or because of pressure from the president,\u201d he said.\n\nDudley said he had confidence in Powell.\n\nHe said there is no big split at the Fed.\n\nSome Fed officials want to cut rates to take out insurance while others want to see more weakness before moving, he said.\n\nDudley said rate cuts help the economy on the margin even if they are not well suited to mitigate trade uncertainty.\n\nRate cuts help the stock market and the bond market, which supports growth and takes upward pressure off the dollar, he said.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.09% was up modestly on Monday. The index fell last week, snapping a three-week winning streak.", "description": "Former New York Fed President William Dudley says that he\u2019s pleased that Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has started to push back on President Trump\u2019s efforts to...", "authors": ["Greg Robb", "Senior Economics Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GD377_Dudley_ZG_20180208125911.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
