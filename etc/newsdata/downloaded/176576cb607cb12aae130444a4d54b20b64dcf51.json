Calls to Athens police were not immediately returned.\n\nLeatherwood said the school is investigating all the hazing claims.\n\nDouglas Sacha/Getty Images, FILE\n\n\"Any time we have allegations come forward, we take them very seriously,\" she said. \"These measures were all taken to preserve the safety and security of our students.\"\n\nDespite the suspension for the marching band, the 245 members of Marching Band 110 will still be allowed to participate in school-sanctioned activities, like the Homecoming Parade, that count as academic credit. However, they cannot participate in any social gatherings.\n\nCalls to the marching band and the director of sorority and fraternity life were not returned.\n\nMore than 2,000 students -- or around one in eight undergraduates -- are involved in Greek life at the school.", "description": "Ohio University suspend 20 student organizations, including all fraternities, over hazing allegations.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/athens-ohio-college-campus-stock-gty-jef-191011_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
