The match was also under a media blackout, and the South Koreans first spoke to journalists about the playing conditions upon their return to Seoul on Thursday.\n\n\u201cThe opponents were very rough, and there were moments when very abusive language was exchanged,\u201d Tottenham striker Son Heung-min said.\n\n\u201cIt was hard to concentrate on the match because you were thinking about avoiding injury first \u2026 It\u2019s an accomplishment that we returned from a game like that without injury,\u201d Son said.\n\n\u201cRoad matches can\u2019t always be good \u2014 our players and staff had a hard time,\u201d he told reporters at Incheon International Airport.\n\nThe team\u2019s general manager Choi Young-il said the South Korean soccer association, known as KFA, will discuss whether to submit a complaint to FIFA over what he described as North Korea\u2019s failure to properly accommodate the visiting team and decision to block media and spectators.\n\nNorth Korea kept out South Korean media and spectators and refused a live broadcast from the stadium.\n\nFIFA President Gianni Infantino also attended the match, and on Tuesday issued a statement saying he was \u201cdisappointed to see there were no fans in the stands.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were surprised by this and by several issues related to its live broadcast and problems with visas and access for foreign journalists,\u201d Infantino said.\n\nNorth Korea did provide a DVD recording of the match to the South Koreans, but it was unclear as of Thursday afternoon whether South Korean networks would use it to broadcast the game on tape delay.\n\nThe North had been expected to have a unique home advantage in the 50,000-capacity stadium devoid of South Korean fans, but South Korean players and soccer officials were surprised to realize there would be no home crowd support, either.\n\nSon said it was regrettable that South Korea, which has a stronger team on paper, couldn\u2019t return with three points, but admitted that their opponents\u2019 physical play got into the players\u2019 heads.\n\nChoi, a former defender who played for South Korea during the 1994 World Cup held in the United States, said the North Koreans played like they were \u201cwaging a war,\u201d violently swinging their elbows and hands and driving into their opponents knee first when competing for balls in air.\n\n\u201cI have never seen something like this in soccer before,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen they weren\u2019t playing or training, South Korean players and staff spent the rest of their time in Pyongyang holed up at the Koryo Hotel, which appeared to have no other guests, Choi said. They had no outside contact, having left their cellphones at the South Korean Embassy in Beijing before entering the North. Choi said North Korean officials didn\u2019t inform the South Korean team that the match would be played in an empty stadium.\n\n\u201cWe got there an hour and a half early and kept thinking that the gate will open and a crowd of 50,000 would pour in,\u201d Choi said. \u201cBut the gate never opened until the end.\u201d\n\nThe game was the first competitive meeting between the national men\u2019s teams in the North Korean capital, although the North hosted the South in a friendly in 1990.\n\nNorth Korea in recent months has severed virtually all cooperation with the South amid deadlocked nuclear negotiations with the United States, and repeatedly ignored the South\u2019s calls for discussions on media coverage issues and allowing South Korean cheer squads ahead of the game.\n\nSouth Korean government and soccer officials still aren\u2019t sure why the North cast the game into media darkness and blocked out spectators.\n\nSome experts say the North was expressing its political displeasure with the South by shutting out rival reporters and fans, but opted to compete in an empty stadium at home in an effort to level the playing field and avoid questions about fairness.\n\nOthers say North Korea might have been concerned about the possibility of its national team losing to the South in front of a massive home crowd, which would have been a humiliating development for leader Kim Jong Un, who has a passion for sports.\n\nThe awkward buildup to the game \u201cdemonstrates the immense discontent North Korea has for (South Korea)\u201d for its failure to break away from its U.S. ally and restart inter-Korean economic projects held back by U.S.-led sanctions, said Choi Kang, vice president of Seoul\u2019s Asan Institute for Policy Studies.\n\nDuring qualification for the 2010 World Cup, North Korea chose to host games against South Korea in Shanghai, refusing to hoist the South Korean flag and play the South Korean anthem on its soil.\n\nThe fate of the game in Pyongyang was uncertain until last month when the governing body of Asian soccer informed the KFA that the North decided it would host the qualifier as scheduled.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s two Group H matches against North Korea will be crucial in qualifying for the World Cup. The second match between the Koreas is scheduled for June 4 in South Korea.\n\nSouth Korea has dominated the past 17 inter-Korean matches with seven wins, one loss and nine draws.\n\nGroup H also includes Lebanon, Turkmenistan and Sri Lanka.", "description": "SEOUL, South Korea (AP) \u2014 South Korea's national soccer team described their World Cup qualifier against North Korea in Pyongyang as a \"rough\" match", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/16/047f42_south-korea-koreas-world-cup-qualifier-60721-son-heung-min-south-korean-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
