But I have said before that my game doesn't change, my personality doesn't change.\n\n'I am still the same person, I still try and lead by example on and off the pitch and I will continue to do that.\n\n'I have been in high pressure situations before in my career, whether that is going through goal droughts, playing in high-pressure games or not playing well as a team. It is something I will take in my stride and improve on.\n\nKane's fifth-minute penalty against the Czech Republic was his 20th goal as England captain\n\n'It is a long, old season for club and country ahead - a lot of games to be played so there are going to be tough periods.\n\n'We are in one now as a club, hopefully we can win on Monday night for England and that will make Friday night less impactful and then I will go back to Spurs and take that in my stride and see how that progresses.'\n\nKane's goal in the Czech Republic was his 20th as England captain, seeing him draw level with Bryan Robson and Alan Shearer for the number of times he has found the back of the net while wearing the armband.\n\nHe has scored seven across the five Group A qualifiers to date and another in Bulgaria would see him become the highest-scoring England skipper of the modern era - a statistic that Kane believes backs up his ability to lead the team.\n\n'Yes, I think so,' he replied when asked if such a landmark shows how comfortable he is in the role of captain.\n\nKane believes his goalscoring record backs up his ability to lead the line for club and country\n\n'As one of the leaders in the team and as a striker, I want to score goals and help the team in that way.\n\n'It has worked out pretty well since I have been captain. But it is not just me who has to lead, there are other players in the team that definitely do that.\n\n'We have a young team and an inexperienced team - we all try to help each other as much as we can.\n\n'The defence are always talking, the midfield is always talking. The strikers are always talking about how can we get better. I have no issues in that role because I know I am not the only one doing it.'", "description": "Harry Kane insists he is ready to take on the pressure of leading both England and Tottenham and can point to his goalscoring record as Three Lions captain as proof.", "authors": ["Mark Mann-Bryans"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/07/19678798-0-image-a-19_1571032940822.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
