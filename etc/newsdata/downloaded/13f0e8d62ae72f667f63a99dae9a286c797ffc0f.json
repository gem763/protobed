It could be 14 or 15 hours of verbal abuse.'\n\nVictim: Nicola Lee was found guilty of manslaughter over the death of her former partner Paul Taylor, 45\n\nHer former partner said Lee had threatened: 'I will kill you', adding: 'From her, I would take it serious. Yes, she's a woman, but I'm actually frightened of her.'\n\nHe said Lee's abuse would 'escalate from verbal to physical' and added: 'I'm not lying when I say basically every week she threatened to kill me.'\n\nHe cotninued: 'She would just rip me to bits with her mouth. Sometimes I did react and shout back.\n\n'I'm not saying I didn't and yes I did restrain her but you have a right to defend yourself.'\n\nThe second ex-boyfriend said Lee had grabbed him by the testicles during a violent row and then injured his arm when she picked up a knife.\n\nA former neighbour also told the court Lee was 'manipulative, calculating, venomous, dangerous, viciously aggressive', adding: 'She is a compulsive liar and preys on the vulnerable.'\n\nThrashing around, she tries to strike them, scolding them for arresting her after informing her Mr Taylor had died\n\nPolice officers urge her to 'calm down', telling her the arrest is 'just a process we have to go through'\n\nProsecutor Caroline Goodwin QC said on the night Mr Taylor died, Lee was 'drunk, aggressive and argumentative', telling the court: 'Her unlawful action led to the termination of his life by a single stab wound.'\n\nMiss Goodwin said the couple's relationship was fraught with turbulence and added: 'Neither of them were angels but the crown say the person who was particularly violent was the defendant.'\n\nThe court heard Lee had previously hit Mr Taylor with a hammer and attacked him with a knife.\n\nShe said it came to the attention of police at the time but Mr Taylor said he had done it to himself.\n\nMr Taylor later confided in a friend that Lee was the one who attacked him.\n\nThe prosecutor said: 'The Crown say that the defendant was the aggressor and perpetrator of further domestic violence.'\n\nBut Lee continues to lash out, saying: 'No, no, no', even when she is put in handcuffs by the officers\n\nMiss Goodwin QC told the court how Mr Taylor's friend Shaun Hunter described an 'atmosphere' between the couple while drinking at her home on March 30.\n\nShe said when Mr Hunter left the address, he received a phone call from Mr Taylor and he walked back to meet him.\n\nMr Taylor had said to Mr Hunter that his head was 'battered' as Lee was going 'on and on and on'.\n\nJurors were told Mr Hunter asked him to come back with him, but Mr Taylor said 'no' as he was going to go back and 'sort it out' with Lee.\n\nMiss Goodwin continued: 'The Crown said that decision was the worst decision of Paul Taylor's life.'\n\nShe said a shop worker described seeing Mr Taylor 'crying' while buying two bottles of Southern Comfort just after 9pm that night.\n\nLee is pictured pacing the living room of her home in Jarrow, north east England, on the night she killed her boyfriend Paul Taylor\n\nShe said, not long later, Lee walked into the same shop to buy a case of Magners cider.\n\nThe shop worker, who described her as being in a 'foul mood', heard Lee shouting 'they better get out my flat or I'll kill them.'\n\nMiss Goodwin said: 'She was drunk and she was angry.'\n\nThe prosecutor told the court how Lee's neighbour Margaret Mason heard the couple arguing just after 10pm and Lee shouting: 'I'm going to kill you, I'm going to kill you, I'll f***ing kill you.'\n\nShe said the neighbour then heard a 'scuffle' take place and she heard shouts of: 'Paul, Paul.'\n\nThe prosecutor told the court Lee called the emergency services, claiming Mr Taylor had 'stabbed himself in the chest'.\n\nDuring the phone call, which was played to the jury, Lee can be heard saying: 'My partner is in the kitchen, he's on the floor, we have ended up having an argument and he's stabbed himself, it's not the first time he's done it, the last time he smashed himself on the head with a hammer.'\n\nShe goes on to tell the operator: 'I'm sick of it, man, he does it on purpose and blames it on me.

Are you for real? I never hurt him, he did it himself.\n\n'He smashed himself on the head with a hammer. I knew I'd get the blame sooner or later.'\n\nShe was charged on April 2, at which point she still maintained: 'I did not stab and kill my boyfriend.'\n\nMiss Goodwin told the court Lee has a 'propensity to be violent' with previous convictions for criminal damage and affray.\n\nThe court heard how a friend of the couple had previously heard Lee saying to Mr Taylor: 'I could kill you and get away with it because of my bipolar.'\n\nThe defendant was remanded in custody and will appear at the same court on October 30 for sentencing.", "description": "Nicola Lee, 44, knifed her partner Paul Taylor, 45, in the kitchen of her Jarrow home on March 31.", "authors": ["Lara Keay For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/16/20043186-0-image-a-72_1571759506649.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
