Those who were already in the scheme were allowed to continue paying the reduced rate.\n\nA Freedom of Information (FOI) request made by mutual insurer Royal London to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) found that, 40 years on, around 200 women are still thought to be paying the reduced rate.\n\nThe number of women paying the reduced stamp peaked in 1977/78 at around 4.4 million.\n\nRoyal London said the entitlement to pay in only lapses if a woman does not pay contributions for a period of two full years.\n\nSir Steve Webb, director of policy at Royal London, said: \"It is not widely known that women who paid the reduced stamp at any point in the 35 years before they retired, and who come under the new state pension system, can claim a minimum payment under the new system.\n\n\"If any woman is getting a substantially reduced amount from the new state pension, she should check if she paid the reduced stamp and contact the Pension Service if she is in any doubt,\" Webb added.", "description": "Newly-retired women are being urged to check whether they could be entitled to extra money in their pension - dating back decades", "authors": ["Emma Munbodh", "Image", "Getty", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article9346090.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/Beautiful-Senior-Couple.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
