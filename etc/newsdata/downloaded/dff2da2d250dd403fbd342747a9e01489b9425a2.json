Analysts surveyed by FactSet had expected per-share earnings of $1.24. Revenue rose 13.6% to $33.06 billion, beating analysts projections.\n\nMicrosoft reported sales for its three main product areas in the quarter surpassed its guidance.\n\nThe Redmond, Wash., company has enjoyed a strong period of higher earnings, in part because of Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella's bet on cloud computing, a model where customers rent computing power instead of buying their own machines.\n\nRevenue for Microsoft's commercial-cloud operations, which include Azure computing services, Office 365 tools and other cloud services, increased 36% to a record $11.6 billion.\n\nIts focus on the cloud has helped turn Microsoft into the third company to hit a $1 trillion valuation. It was the most valuable company in the world before ceding the title back to Apple Inc. this month.\n\nMicrosoft has been trying to take market share from Amazon.com Inc., the No. 1 company in cloud computing by sales. To bolster its position, it has made a series of acquisitions to add services to its cloud business. This week, the company announced it was acquiring startup called Mover, which will help businesses migrate data to Office 365.\n\nOne of Microsoft's biggest challenges is to sustain its cloud-computing momentum amid concerns that businesses may slow information-technology spending in coming months over concerns of a global economic slowdown. Azure sales growth in the last quarter fell to 59% from 64% in the previous quarter.\n\nBrad Reback, an analyst at Stifel, Nicolaus & Co. said Microsoft earnings were strong \"across the board.\" Though Azure's sales have slowed, Mr. Stiffel said the company's performance was impressive with Microsoft's growth outpacing that of Amazon's cloud service at a comparable point.\n\nMicrosoft's intelligent cloud segment, which includes its Azure product line, booked revenue of $10.85 billion, up 27%, beating analyst expectations of $10.42 billion.\n\nMicrosoft's productivity and business process division, which includes LinkedIn, sales-management software Dynamics and commercial subscriptions to the Office 360 product suite, had $11.07 billion in sales, up 13% from the same quarter a year ago. Analysts were expecting sales of $10.85 billion for the quarter.\n\nThe company's slower-growing \"more personal computing\" segment, which includes Xbox gaming equipment, its Surface hardware lineup and Windows licensing fees, reported revenue of $11.13 billion, up 4%, versus analyst estimates of $10.88 billion. Sales of Surface hardware were down 4% from the previous year.\n\nSales of computers featuring the company's Windows 10 software appeared to get a boost as companies transition away from the older Windows 7 suite that Microsoft has said it would stop supporting early next year. Revenue from the Windows Pro segment rose 19%, compared with an 8% increase a year ago.\n\nMicrosoft Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood called the results a strong start to the fiscal year.\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 23, 2019 18:17 ET (22:17 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
