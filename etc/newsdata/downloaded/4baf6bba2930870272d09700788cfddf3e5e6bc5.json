There are ambiguities. People who do really good stuff have flaws.\u201d\n\nThe former president went on to critique shifts among young political activists towards more vitriolic judgments on those they disagree with, especially when using online platforms.\n\n\u201cOne danger I see among young people particularly on college campuses, I do get a sense sometimes now among certain young people \u2014 and this is accelerated by social media \u2014 there is this sense sometimes the way of me making change is to be as judgmental as possible about other people and that\u2019s enough.\n\n\u201cLike if I tweet or hashtag about how you didn\u2019t do something right, or use the wrong verb, then I can sit back and feel pretty good about myself. \u2018Cuz man, did you see how woke I was? I called you out!\u2019\u201d Obama sarcastically remarked.\n\nEarlier this month, Obama tweeted in support of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, saying he was \u201cproud\u201d to have worked with him. In September, evidence of Trudeau appearing in blackface developed into a scandal which resulted in a public apology from Trudeau\n\nI was proud to work with Justin Trudeau as President. He's a hard-working, effective leader who takes on big issues like climate change. The world needs his progressive leadership now, and I hope our neighbors to the north support him for another term. \u2014 Barack Obama (@BarackObama) October 16, 2019", "description": "Former President Barack Obama chided \u201cwoke\u201d social media activism for popularizing so-called cancel culture during a speech on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Tobias Hoonhout", "Zachary Evans", "Kevin D.
