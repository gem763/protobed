Security Council resolutions.\n\nNorth Korea rejects U.N. Security Council resolutions that ban Pyongyang from using ballistic missile technology, saying they are an infringement of its right to self-defence.\n\nTalks aimed at dismantling North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile programmes have been stalled since a second summit between Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump in Vietnam in February broke down in disagreement over nuclear disarmament.\n\nNorth Korea fired the missile hours after announcing it would resume talks with the United States by holding working-level negotiations on Oct. 5.\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s chief nuclear negotiator, Kim Myong Gil, arrived at the Beijing airport on Thursday with other North Korean officials and booked flights to Stockholm, Sweden, Yonhap reported, citing an airport official.\n\nWhat appears to be a submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) flies in an undisclosed location in this undated picture released by North Korea's Central News Agency (KCNA) on October 2, 2019. KCNA via REUTER\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going for the DPRK-U.S. working-level negotiations,\u201d the negotiator Kim told reporters in Beijing, according to Yonhap. \u201cThere\u2019s been a new signal from the U.S. side, so we\u2019re going with great expectations and optimism about the outcome.\u201d\n\n\u2018NUCLEAR CAPABLE\u2019\n\nThe Pukguksong-3 appeared to be a new design that has enhanced range and stability compared with a version tested in 2016, three analysts said.\n\nIt was probably launched from a test platform and not a submarine, which would be the final stage of testing, said Kim Dong-yub, a military expert at Kyungnam University\u2019s Institute of Far Eastern Studies in Seoul.\n\nState news agency KCNA released photos and a report in July of leader Kim Jong Un inspecting a large, newly built submarine, but an unnamed South Korean military source said on Thursday that the submarine appears to be still incomplete, Yonhap news agency reported.\n\nLeader Kim Jong Un\u2019s absence at the test is \u201cextremely unusual,\u201d Kyungnam University\u2019s Kim said, probably meant to contain the political fallout that could result in the upcoming talks falling apart before they even start.\n\nOn Wednesday, South Korea\u2019s military said the missile flew 450 km (280 miles) and reached an altitude of 910 km (565 miles). It was likely a Pukguksong-class weapon, as the North\u2019s earlier submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) under development were known.\n\nSouth Korean Defence Minister Jeong Kyeong-doo said the Pukguksong, or Pole Star in Korean, would have had a range of about 1,300 km (910 miles) on a standard trajectory.\n\nWhat appears to be a submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) flies in an undisclosed location in this undated picture released by North Korea's Central News Agency (KCNA) on October 2, 2019. KCNA via REUTERS\n\nNorth Korea had been developing SLBM technology before it suspended long-range missile and nuclear tests and began talks with the United States that led to the first summit between Kim and Trump in Singapore in June 2018.\n\nThe latest version of the Pukguksong may be the longest-range North Korean missile that uses solid fuel and the first nuclear-capable missile to be tested since November 2017, Ankit Panda of the U.S.-based Federation of American Scientists said.\n\nNorth Korea has been developing rocket engines that burn solid fuel, which has advantages in military use compared with liquid fuel because it is stable and versatile, allowing it to be stored in missiles until they are ready for launch.", "description": "North Korea said on Thursday it had successfully test-fired a new submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) from the sea to contain external threats and bolster self-defence, ahead of fresh nuclear talks with the United States.", "authors": ["Joyce Lee", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191003&t=2&i=1436522382&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9203L"}
