Neal has said the committee wants Trump's tax returns because it's interested in oversight and legislation about how the IRS enforces tax laws against a president.\n\nThe Treasury Department rejected Neal's request and subsequent subpoenas, arguing that they lacked a legitimate legislative purpose. The Ways and Means Committee then filed a lawsuit in July in an effort to get a judge to order Treasury Department and the IRS to comply with the requests and subpoenas.\n\nThe lawsuit is still pending. The administration, along with Trump's personal lawyers, have filed a motion to dismiss the case, and a hearing on that motion is scheduled for Nov. 6.\n\nThe Committee revealed in court documents in August that a federal employee had reached out with credible allegations of possible attempts to influence the IRS's program for mandatory audits of presidents and vice presidents. The Washington Post reported Thursday that the whistleblower is a career IRS employee who reported that he was told that at least one Treasury political appointee tried to interfere with the mandatory audit program.\n\n\u2014Updated at 4:55 p.m.", "description": "The\u00a0Treasury Department inspector general's (IG) office is investigating the department's handling and rejection of House Democrats' request for President Trump's tax returns.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/treasury_061319gn_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
