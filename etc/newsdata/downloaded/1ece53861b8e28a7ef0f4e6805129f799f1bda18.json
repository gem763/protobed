Often living in communities such as Miami\u2019s Little Haiti, these first- and second-generation immigrants are rooted in family and connected by social ties with compatriots, who have lived through similar experiences, and who share the need to deal with all of that while making a life and a livelihood in America.\n\nBut for all their connections and similarities, the characters in these stories are distinct individuals with their own personalities, their own places in their community and their own ways of making a living. Elsie, the central character of \u201cDosas,\u201d is a nurse\u2019s assistant, her husband a mechanic turned musician. Kim, the narrator of \u201cSeven Stories,\u201d is the daughter of two pediatricians; her friend Callie is the daughter of one prime minister and the wife of another. In \u201cWithout Inspection,\u201d Darline, a cook, came to the United States only because her husband insisted. He drowned while crossing as an illegal immigrant; she survived because she had to save her son, Paris, so-named because it was his father\u2019s dream to visit the capital of France.\n\nDreams and aspirations give many of these admirable Haitians their strength. Lies and tricks and betrayals \u2014 sometimes committed by other Haitians \u2014 confound them, sometimes finally, but often only until they marshal their resources yet again and begin to claw their way back.\n\nTheir personalities determine their responses to the hand life deals them. In a metonymy for all behavior, Elsie reflects \u201cSome people just want to go home, no matter what the cost,\u201d She herself does not pine to return permanently to Haiti, but for good or ill, she and her husband, Blaise, and friend Olivia behave as they do because of their natures. \u201cThey were dosas. All three of them. Untwinned, lonely, alone together.\u201d Elsie suffers enormous losses. Yet, had she and Blaise\u2019s mentor been able to act just slightly differently, their lives would probably have worked out much better.\n\nSome writers could have made a novel-sized meal out of the material in \u201cDosas\u201d with its sharp focus on four characters, its back stories of several lives, its pairing of betrayal in one plot with devotion in a sub-plot. Typically, the always eloquent Edwidge Danticat strips the fat from her narrative to zero in on her characters. She is kind to them but not indulgent. She tells it like it is.\n\nThe most dramatic example in this volume is, perhaps, Carole, a new grandmother losing the memories and abilities that have sustained her as she drifts into Alzheimer\u2019s. In \u201cSunrise, Sunset,\u201d her daughter, Jeanne, is scarcely better at coping, spending days in bed, unable to mother her 7-month old. But Carole, for all her mental losses, reflects astutely \u201cHer daughter\u2019s psyche is so feeble anything can rattle her. Doesn\u2019t she realize that the life she is living is an accident of fortune? Doesn\u2019t she know she is an exception in this world, where it is normal to be unhappy, to be hungry, to work nonstop and earn next to nothing, and to suffer the whims of everything from tyrants to hurricanes and earthquakes?\u201d Alzheimer\u2019s notwithstanding, Carole acts vigorously to focus Jeanne\u2019s attention on her baby\u2019s needs. \u201cSunrise, Sunset\u201d \u2014 the beginning and ending of lives \u2014 captures not just the dramatic results when someone steps way beyond the normal limits, but also the ways in which each moment is a link in the long chain of moments that becomes a life.\n\nThis is another striking instance in which the narrative is shaped by a decisive action \u2014 an action that, even in her decline, Carole had to take because she has devoted herself to her family\u2019s success in a new country. And so, it is in all the stories: Character drives the plot, or rather, more specifically character is the plot: What happens \u2014 the events recounted in the stories \u2014 springs from the way a character must inevitably respond to other characters or events.\n\nThis collection comprises eight lucid and profoundly moving mini-masterpieces of the storyteller\u2019s art. The stories are like crystals. Polished by Edwidge Danticat\u2019s brilliant prose, each facet is sparklingly clear, as she turns them to show us her people and their situations in different lights.\n\n\u2022 Claire Hopley is a writer and editor in Amherst, Massachusetts.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nEVERYTHING INSIDE\n\nBy Edwidge Danticat\n\nKnopf, $25.95, 241 pages\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
