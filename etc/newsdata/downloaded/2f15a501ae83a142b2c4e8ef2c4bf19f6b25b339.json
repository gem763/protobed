Turkey has long wanted the U.S. to end its support for the Kurds, an ethnic group the Turkish government views as terrorists.\n\nThe White House\u2019s announcement Sunday to allow Turkey to invade northern Syria startled some members of Congress, who warned such a move could lead to a genocide of the Kurds and allow ISIS to creep back into the region.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), a frequent cheerleader of the president, split with Trump on his Syria decision, calling it \u201cshortsighted\u201d and \u201cirresponsible\u201d during a phone interview with \u201cFox & Friends\u201d on Monday.\n\nLindsey Graham calls in to Fox & Friends & calls Trump's decision to abandon the Kurds \"impulsive.\"\n\n\n\n\"I hope I'm making myself clear how shortsighted & irresponsible this decision is in my view,\" he says. \"This to me is just unnerving to its core.\" pic.twitter.com/URH0DVA1bo \u2014 Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) October 7, 2019\n\nGraham, who helped to convince Trump to reverse his decision last December to withdraw U.S. forces from Syria, tweeted Monday that abandoning our Kurdish allies would be \u201ca stain on America\u2019s honor.\u201d\n\nHe said he plans to introduce a Senate resolution opposing and asking for a reversal of Trump\u2019s decision if he moves forward with it.\n\nI don\u2019t know all the details regarding President Trump\u2019s decision in northern Syria. In process of setting up phone call with Secretary Pompeo.\n\n\n\nIf press reports are accurate this is a disaster in the making. \u2014 Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) October 7, 2019\n\n* Ensures ISIS comeback.\n\n* Forces Kurds to align with Assad and Iran.\n\n* Destroys Turkey\u2019s relationship with U.S. Congress.\n\n* Will be a stain on America\u2019s honor for abandoning the Kurds. \u2014 Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) October 7, 2019\n\nSen. Mitt Romney of Utah echoed his fellow Republican\u2019s concern.\n\nThe President\u2019s decision to abandon our Kurd allies in the face of an assault by Turkey is a betrayal. It says that America is an unreliable ally; it facilitates ISIS resurgence; and it presages another humanitarian disaster. https://t.co/Tu8ARa8Pmp \u2014 Senator Mitt Romney (@SenatorRomney) October 7, 2019\n\nSeveral other Republicans also spoke out about the sudden shift in U.S. foreign policy. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy urged the U.S. to \u201ckeep its word\u201d with its foreign allies during an appearance Monday on \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a terribly unwise decision by the President to abandon our Kurdish allies, who have been our major partner in the fight against the Islamic State,\u201d Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) said in a statement.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) called Trump\u2019s decision a \u201cgrave mistake.\u201d\n\nIt would confirm #Iran\u2019s view of this administration & embolden then to escalate hostile attacks which in turn could trigger much broader & more dangerous regional war. \u2014 Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) October 7, 2019\n\nSen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, called the move \u201cpositively sinister.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. convinced the Kurds to destroy ISIS for us, causing massive Kurd casualties.\n\n\n\nThen we conned the Kurds into dismantling their defenses, promising to protect them.\n\n\n\nNow Trump invites the Turks into Syria, green lighting them to wipe out the Kurds.\n\n\n\nPositively sinister. \u2014 Chris Murphy (@ChrisMurphyCT) October 7, 2019\n\nBrett McGurk, the former U.S. envoy to the global coalition fighting ISIS, blasted Trump for demonstrating \u201ca complete lack of understanding of anything happening on the ground.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrump made a similarly impulsive decision when I was managing the policy,\u201d tweeted McGurk, who resigned last year when Trump announced plans to abruptly withdraw American troops from Syria. \u201cTrump tonight after one call with a foreign leader provided a gift to Russia, Iran, and ISIS.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump is not a Commander-in-Chief. He makes impulsive decisions with no knowledge or deliberation. He sends military personnel into harm\u2019s way with no backing. He blusters and then leaves our allies exposed when adversaries call his bluff or he confronts a hard phone call. \u2014 Brett McGurk (@brett_mcgurk) October 7, 2019\n\nThere\u2019s a similar defect at the core of US foreign policies across the board: maximalist objectives for a minimalist president combined with no process to assess facts, develop options, or prepare contingencies. Our personnel are left exposed at the slightest moment of friction. \u2014 Brett McGurk (@brett_mcgurk) October 7, 2019\n\nDaniel Drezner, a professor of international politics at Tufts University, accused Trump of \u201cscrewing over a local ally that has done pretty much everything the U.S. has asked.\u201d\n\nIt cannot be stressed enough how much Trump \u2014 and let\u2019s be clear, this is Trump, no one else in his administration wants to do this \u2014 is screwing over a local ally that has done pretty much everything the U.S. has asked. https://t.co/fU9A39CPlL \u2014 Daniel W. Drezner (@dandrezner) October 7, 2019\n\nTrump appeared to address some of the concerns over his decision to withdraw support in northern Syria, tweeting Monday that he would \u201ctotally destroy\u201d Turkey\u2019s economy if its leaders did anything he considers to be \u201coff limits.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe U.S. has done far more than anyone could have ever expected,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt is now time for others in the region, some of great wealth, to protect their own territory. THE USA IS GREAT!\u201d\n\nAs I have stated strongly before, and just to reiterate, if Turkey does anything that I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits, I will totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey (I\u2019ve done before!). They must, with Europe and others, watch over... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 7, 2019\n\n....the captured ISIS fighters and families. The U.S. has done far more than anyone could have ever expected, including the capture of 100% of the ISIS Caliphate. It is time now for others in the region, some of great wealth, to protect their own territory. THE USA IS GREAT! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 7, 2019\n\nThis is a developing story. Check back for updates.", "description": "Sen.
