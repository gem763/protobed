James\u2018 father, Jeffrey, thought that since his little boy had been born a boy, that he should be raised as a boy, and sexually and biologically speaking, remain a boy \u2014 and that despite the fact the boy enjoyed watching the Disney princess movie \u201cFrozen,\u2019\u201d it didn\u2019t really mean anything other than, well, he liked watching the movie \u201cFrozen.\u201d Makes sense, right?\n\nBut these are dark times. Common sense is hard to find.\n\nIt\u2019s quite possible, given the jurors\u2019 ruling, that Georgulas could soon enough chemically castrate James. James, who is 7. James, whose life consists of cartoons and coloring and a bedtime probably of 8 o\u2019clock.\n\n\u201cThis means James\u2018 mother \u2026 will be able to continue \u2018transitioning\u2019 him into \u2018Luna,\u2019 and now has full authority to start him on puberty blockers and eventually cross-sex hormones,\u201d LifeSite.com reported.\n\nThis is horrific stuff. The stuff of horror movies. The stuff that should stay of horror movies.\n\nOnly it\u2019s real life, and what\u2019s more, American life.\n\nCan we truly be this stupid? What 7-year-old understands the meaning of sex, never mind the complexities and politics of sex changes?\n\nThis case is far from over; no doubt, at some point, higher courts will be asked to weigh in and make clear the parental boundaries and authorities, as well as the rights of the child in matters involving sex.\n\nBut the larger point is this: that such cases actually exist in America.\n\nThe LGBTQ movement has been on a steady march toward this very moment \u2014 the moment when it becomes accepted by society that sex is something as easily changed as clothing. The moment when traditional family walls crumble. The moment when the rational becomes the irrational; the norm, the abnormal. Or maybe more to the truth, the moment when the abnormal becomes the norm.\n\nAnd shame on American society for allowing this to happen.\n\nFears of appearing politically incorrect, of facing a legal challenge, of dealing with trolls on social media, of withstanding the vicious outcries of the far-leftists in the press \u2014 these fears and more have all had the chilling effect of bringing America to a time when child abuse is being sold as compassion. Because chemically castrating a little boy who is 7 years old is nothing but child abuse, no matter how you dress it, no matter how you justify it, no matter what you call it.\n\nThis is evil at its purest.\n\nNobody is cheering here but the wicked.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
