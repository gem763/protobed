The STA news agency described the Adria Airways flight grounding as \u201cthe biggest upset in Slovenian civil aviation in decades.\u201d\n\nAdria Airways has said the suspension is temporary.\n\n\u201cThe company is at this point intensively searching solutions in cooperation with a potential investor,\u201d it said in a statement late on Monday. \u201cThe goal of everyone involved is to make Adria Airways fly again.\u201d\n\nFormerly Slovenia\u2019s national carrier, Adria Airways was sold in 2016 to German investment fund 4K Invest. The company has since sold all its planes and is using leased planes.\n\nThe decision to suspend flights came after repeated delays and cancellations by the cash-strapped carrier. Two of the company\u2019s leased planes have been taken back because of unpaid debt.\n\n\u201cThe company deeply regrets the situation and apologizes to all its passengers and partners,\u201d Adria Airways said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Slovenia-based carried Adria Airways on Tuesday suspended all flights except one for Frankfurt for two days due to shortage of funds.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": ""}
