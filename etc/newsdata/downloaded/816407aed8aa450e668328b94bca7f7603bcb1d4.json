REUTERS/Michele Tantussi\n\nBERLIN (Reuters) - Germany\u2019s foreign minister said he hoped British lawmakers would vote on Monday to proceed with an orderly Brexit, adding that he could imagine a short extension to Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union if London needed the time to pass legislation.\n\n\u201cI hope that the British lower house, showing the necessary responsibility, can take a decision on this today and that on the basis of this decision we will be in a position to achieve an orderly Brexit,\u201d Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said in Berlin.\n\n\u201cShould there be problems in Britain with the ratification, I would not rule out that there could be a short, technical extension,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cShould there not be a majority in the British lower house, then we in the European Union would have to look at whether there would then be a full extension - and only then would there be a decision about that.
