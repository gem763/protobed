Brad Pitt, one of our last true movie stars, is currently in a somnambulant space epic. His last film, an ostensible ode to Hollywood, revolved around the Manson family.\n\nWe have been warned by nothing less than the United States Army that fall\u2019s next big movie, \u201cJoker,\u201d is probably a clarion call for mass-shooter incels targeting multiplexes.\n\nAnd Demi Moore, once the highest-paid actress on the planet, has just published \u201cInside Out,\u201d her very grim memoir.\n\nMoore writes of her rape at 15, when the assailant paid $500 to her alcoholic mother; her struggles with drugs, alcohol and an eating disorder; her claims that her much-younger husband Ashton Kutcher pressured her into threesomes and back into substance abuse, then cheated on her with, among others, a 21-year-old friend of her own daughter; miscarrying at six months and subsequent failed IVF attempts; her previous marriage to Bruce Willis ruined by his cheating and resentment of her fame.\n\nNothing, it seems, has been left out. None of it\u2019s good. And these are the selling points!\n\nIt\u2019s all so depressing. And, perhaps, not surprising: Pop culture, after all, reflects our mood at any given moment, and right now that mood is best described as anxious, depressed, scared, angry. The country is shot through with pessimism \u2014 over President Trump (whether you\u2019re for or against), over climate change (the current face of which is a very angry 16-year-old girl), over mass shootings, \u201cfake news,\u201d terrorism, recession fears, immigration.\n\nEverything, it seems, is terrible. Except it isn\u2019t.\n\nAs Steven Pinker wrote in his recent book \u201cEnlightenment Now: The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism and Progress,\u201d we, as a planet and a people, are better off than at any time in history. Technology is helping even the poorest gain access to better, more financially beneficial lives. The worldwide trends for peace, prosperity, safety, lifespans, health and, yes, happiness all go in one direction: up.\n\nSo why can\u2019t we have joy in the one place we typically seek it \u2014 Hollywood? Even the year\u2019s biggest Marvel movie ended (spoiler alert) with the death of Tony Stark.\n\nCurrently, I\u2019m reading one of the all-time great Hollywood memoirs: \u201cThe Kid Stays in the Picture,\u201d published in 1994 by now-89-year-old producer Robert Evans. What\u2019s most striking about the book \u2014 and I\u2019m in the middle, before the cocaine trafficking and suspected involvement in a murder, but we\u2019ll see how it goes \u2014 is how joyful it is. Each page practically buzzes with one sentiment: \u201cCan you believe it?\u201d Evans can\u2019t. He can\u2019t believe he\u2019s a failed actor running a Hollywood studio, or that he knows Jack Nicholson, or that he marries America\u2019s sweetheart at the height of her fame.\n\nAnd when that sweetheart, Ali MacGraw, leaves Evans for her co-star Steve McQueen, Evans blames himself. But mostly he dishes and bitches and it\u2019s all in good fun.\n\nSo yes to J.Lo\u2019s 1998 Movieline interview! Yes to a pre-social media, pre-packaged profile that\u2019s actually revealing! Yes to a starlet talking trash about her contemporaries, naming her sleaziest male co-stars, fighting for more money and not caring if she sounds greedy (\u201cI want to make as much or more as Demi Moore when it\u2019s my time\u201d), to talking unironically about \u201cmy craft\u201d and declaring that of all the girls in Hollywood, \u201cI\u2019m the best.\u201d\n\nNow that\u2019s fun.\n\nRelated Video Video length 54 seconds :54 Demi Moore says man raped her at 15, then paid alcoholic mom $500 Demi Moore says man raped her at 15, then paid alcoholic mom $500", "description": "When Jennifer Lopez\u2019s infamous interview with Movieline resurfaced on Thursday, I thought: How fun.", "authors": ["Maureen Callahan", "September"], "top_image": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/sad-hollywood.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
