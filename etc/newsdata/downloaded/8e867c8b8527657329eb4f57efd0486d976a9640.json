Tehran has denied involvement.\n\nThe attacks were claimed by Iran-backed Yemeni rebels.\n\nMnuchin, on a tour of the Middle East and India, said \"we have a shared view as to the threat that Iran poses to the region and to the world\" and spoke of the US \"maximum pressure campaign\" involving sanctions.\n\n\"We will continue to ramp up more, more, more, as you've said.\"\n\nWashington has hit Iran with unilateral sanctions since withdrawing from a 2015 nuclear accord between world powers and Tehran.\n\nIsraelis have been concerned over Trump's withdrawal of US troops from neighbouring Syria that many have viewed as a blatant abandonment of Washington's Kurdish allies.\n\nThere are worries that Israel too could be abandoned by its most important ally, as well as longstanding concerns that Iran could move to fill any vacuum in Syria.\n\nIran, along with Russia, has been backing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime in his country's eight-year civil war.\n\nJared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, was among the US officials accompanying Mnuchin on his trip.\n\nKushner and US special representative for Iran Brian Hook also met Netanyahu on Monday.\n\nBenny Gantz, Netanyahu's main opponent in Israel's deadlocked September 17 elections, met Kushner and Hook as well.\n\nNetanyahu failed to form a new government following the elections, and Gantz is now seeking to do so though he also faces long odds.\n\nThe stalemate has raised the possibility that Israel will soon be heading toward a third election in a year's time.", "description": "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday accused Iran of wanting to strike Israel with precision-guided missiles from Yemen as he urged US President Donald Trump's administration to further pressure Tehran.
