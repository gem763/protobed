Petrofac did not ultimately win the contract.\n\nAsfari and his wife, Sawsan, have donated almost \u00a3800,000 to the Conservative party since 2009. The donations were made in a personal capacity.\n\nDocuments obtained by the Guardian raise questions about how governments should best manage the perceived potential conflicts of interest generated by donations from business figures to political parties.\n\nThe government said it was routine for ministers to support British businesses bidding for major foreign contracts. Petrofac said official support had been obtained through entirely proper channels.\n\nThe Serious Fraud Office (SFO) has been investigating Petrofac over suspected bribery, corruption and money laundering for at least two years.\n\nMay\u2019s support for Petrofac\u2019s bid is detailed in documents released under the Freedom of Information Act.\n\nIn 2017, Petrofac requested a meeting with Liam Fox, then international trade secretary, \u201cas part of their ongoing relationship\u201d with the British government, according to the documents.\n\nOn 8 March, Fox wrote to May telling her that Asfari had \u201crequested government support for a bid he is making together with a US-based company. The bid is for a major expansion of the Bahraini national oil company, Bapco refinery. The overall project is one of the largest ever in Bahrain at approximately $5bn.\u201d\n\nFox said four consortiums were bidding for the contract and those bids were soon to be evaluated. \u201cMr Asfari believes that high level government support could make a substantial difference.\u201d\n\nHe asked May to send a letter to the Bahraini prime minister, Prince Khalifa bin Salman al-Khalifa. Six days later, after Asfari met Fox in his Whitehall office, May wrote to Prince Khalifa \u201cin support of\u201d Petrofac\u2019s bid.\n\n\u201cI am certain that Petrofac will do everything possible to deliver the most attractive techno-commercial offer for the project,\u201d the prime minister wrote.\n\nShe said that \u201cgiven the strategic importance of this project for Bahrain and for the economic relationship between our two countries\u201d, Fox \u201chas committed to follow and support this project to ensure that it receives the fullest commitment\u201d of the British government.\n\nPetrofac said it sought British government support for landing the contract through Britain\u2019s ambassador in Bahrain, in line with common practice.\n\nThe Department for International Trade, speaking on behalf of May and Fox, said: \u201cThe support Petrofac received from the then prime minister and the then trade secretary followed the correct process, and was carried out with due propriety throughout. Government supports British business at home and abroad, including backing companies when they bid for international opportunities.\u201d\n\nCameron visited Bahrain on 10 and 11 January 2017 on his way back from China. His office said it was an opportunity to visit Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad al-Khalifa after the cancellation of a scheduled visit while he had been prime minister.\n\nHis office said he carried out a \u201cwide-ranging schedule of engagements and visits organised with the support of the UK\u2019s ambassador to Bahrain, who accompanied Mr Cameron for part of the programme\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhile visiting the country, Mr Cameron took the opportunity to help promote the interests of a British-based company. This was done in coordination with the UK government at the time.\n\n\u201cMr Cameron, both as prime minister and subsequently, has been an enthusiastic advocate for British businesses around the world. He was not paid anything for this engagement and his support for the company had nothing whatsoever to do with donations made to the Conservative party.\u201d Asfari did not accompany Cameron on the trip.\n\nForeign Office memos record that Cameron visited the headquarters of the Bahrain Economic Development Board. May\u2019s letter outlined how Petrofac proposed to work with the board to help train Bahraini engineers.\n\nSFO names four Petrofac managers over multimillion-pound bribe scheme Read more\n\nA spokesperson for Petrofac said the firm \u201cdoes not make political donations. Any donations by Ayman Asfari and his family are made in a strictly personal capacity.\u201d The spokesperson stressed that no preferential treatment was given by the government to the company as a result of his personal donations.\n\nAsfari, who reportedly has a fortune of around $1bn, co-founded Petrofac and has headed the multinational company for more than two decades. It designs and builds facilities for the oil and gas industry, employing 11,500 people in 24 countries.\n\nCameron appointed Asfari in 2014 as one of 43 prime minister\u2019s business ambassadors, working with the British government to promote trade and investment.\n\nA Whitehall memo prepared for Fox in 2017 described Asfari as being \u201cvery active as a business ambassador which is greatly appreciated\u201d. The business ambassadors scheme was closed by the government earlier this year.\n\nIn May 2017, the SFO announced it was investigating Petrofac. During its investigation the SFO arrested and interviewed Asfari under caution, among others. He was released without charge.\n\nIn February this year, David Lufkin, 51, a former Petrofac executive, pleaded guilty to 11 counts of offering bribes between 2011 and 2016 in an attempt to secure contracts in Saudi Arabia and Iraq. He has yet to be sentenced.", "description": "Former PMs asked princes to support bid for $5bn contract by Ayman Asfari\u2019s firm Petrofac", "authors": ["Rob Evans", "David Pegg"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9b14b45f9aeaa686aa6ef64d1a115c742630161/0_248_3758_2255/master/3758.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=be326d5aaa958533eefacf802a38be93", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
