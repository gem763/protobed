Lyft also has other subscription products focused on car rides, but they will be phased out and replaced with this one.\n\nYes, but: These subscriptions usually only make sense for super users of the service \u2014customers for whom the discounts and freebies will add up to more than the monthly fee.\n\nThe bottom line: The companies are battling for customers\u2019 loyalty as their services have become more and more commoditized in major U.S. cities, where riders often use both apps and order a ride from whichever is cheaper or can pick them up faster.", "description": "Lyft is rolling out a new plan for all of its transportation options.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://assets.axios.com/203e9f932cc97836ac2ff4c6c982676c.png", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
