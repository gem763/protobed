Nelson became president last year but was a member of a top governing body called the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles when the policy took effect.\n\n\u201cWe knew that this policy created concern and confusion for some and heartache for others,\u201d said Nelson, who is considered a prophet by church members. \u201cThat grieved us. Whenever the sons and daughters of God weep, for whatever reasons, we weep.\u201d\n\nNelson contended that leaders can\u2019t change God\u2019s laws but have the authority to adjust church policy.\n\n'Trauma is a slow burn': Mormons seek healing as church eases anti-LGBT policy Read more\n\nThe remarks were the latest move in a continuing effort by the Utah-based faith widely known as the Mormon church to carve out a compassionate stance toward LGBTQ people while adhering to opposition of gay marriage.\n\nCritics say the balancing act has led to a confusing push-and-pull of policies that leave LGBTQ members and their allies confused and sometimes distraught. The 2015 policy angered many and led to protests and some defections.\n\nThe church considers homosexual relations a sin, forcing gay and lesbian members to avoid intimate relationships to remain full-fledged members.\n\nNelson, 95, said in a basketball arena packed with nearly 19,000 students that they must follow God\u2019s laws if they want exaltation.\n\n\u201cThe arbiter of truth is God, not your favorite social media news feed, not Google, and certainly not those who are disaffected from the church,\u201d Nelson said.", "description": "President of Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints says church can change policies but not God\u2019s law", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9b9a1f5b1d4c3ec955f1e6cefacf94a6756ac3c/0_285_4100_2461/master/4100.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=05c25beee4deaef37f8b1ef5d2d555b1", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
