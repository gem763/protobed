REUTERS/Edgard Garrido\n\nVazquez was the 13th human rights defender in Mexico likely killed for her activism in 2019, according to the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), a tally almost surpassing its total for all 2018.\n\nOver two months later, no suspects have been arrested. Vazquez\u2019s murder adds to the heavy toll on Mexico\u2019s record under President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who took office in December pledging to contain mounting lawlessness.\n\n\u201cWe have to see this as just the tip of the iceberg, because there are many more other forms of aggression that affect human rights defenders,\u201d Jan Jarab, the OHCHR representative in Mexico, told Reuters. \u201cAll serious crimes need to be investigated far better in Mexico than they are.\u201d\n\nMore than 29,000 murders were registered in Mexico last year, and the total for 2019 is on track to go higher. Activists make up just a tiny fraction of the total, but their plight has heightened alarm over the surging violence.\n\nPolice found Vazquez\u2019s body at her apartment in the city\u2019s western neighbourhood of Condesa on July 1, when neighbours reported a foul smell. Days earlier, passers-by had alerted police to screams in the vicinity.\n\nA member of a local neighbourhood watch committee, Vazquez took an active role in protesting to authorities against breaches in rules and regulations, friends and neighbours said.\n\nComplaints she made about a building under construction next to her home, improper use of a local park and the activities of street vendors made her enemies, and she received threats, said Quetzal Castro, the committee\u2019s leader.\n\nNo suspect has been named over the killing and nobody has been charged so far. Local police did not respond to repeated requests by Reuters for comment on the case.\n\nMexico City attorney general Ernestina Godoy said in July that Vazquez\u2019s complaints about the building was one of the first lines of inquiry opened into her death. But her office has since given no further details on the investigations.\n\n\u201cALONE WITHOUT YOU\u201d\n\nHuman rights activists, like journalists, have faced increasing exposure to risk during a broader deterioration in security since the government sent in the armed forces to battle organised crime at the end of 2006.\n\nLopez Obrador says his administration must do more to quell the violence, which he has cast as the \u201crotten fruit\u201d of corruption, state-sanctioned rights abuses and failed economic policies of previous governments.\n\nAccording to the OHCHR, 14 rights activists were killed in 2018. Tallies vary, and Mexico\u2019s National Human Rights Commission (CNDH) categorized Vazquez as the seventh such victim in 2019 after registering six last year.\n\nThe CNDH estimates more than 90% of activist murders go unsolved, making it hard to classify cases.\n\nRural rights advocates are often among those most exposed if they clash with economic interests competing for land or natural resources, experts say.\n\nIn February, indigenous activist Samir Flores was gunned down on his doorstep in the state of Morelos, after protesting a gas pipeline set to cut through his area.\n\nProsecutors in Morelos denied the killing was linked to his activism, a move that Jarab of the OHCHR said \u201cseriously called into question the investigation.\u201d\n\nThe case is still unresolved.\n\nViolence against activists has a chilling effect, dissuading others from doing their work.\n\nAfter Vazquez\u2019s killing, Castro of the Condesa neighbourhood watch group joined a government protection scheme for activists. Some members of her committee stopped going to meetings, afraid that \u201csomeone could be watching their every move,\u201d she said.\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\nVazquez\u2019s elderly mother, Cristina Chavarria, sobbed as she vented her frustration over the lack of progress on the murder.\n\n\u201cWe want to know if they\u2019re really working on it, or if they\u2019ve just abandoned it,\u201d she said as a pendant of St. Jude, the patron saint of lost causes, dangled from her neck.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know where you are,\u201d she said, clutching two photographs to her chest of the daughter who had cared for her in old age. \u201cI\u2019m alone without you.\u201d", "description": "Human rights activists in Mexico had already suffered a bad year by the time 58-year-old Cristina Vazquez was murdered in her apartment in an affluent Mexico City neighbourhood at the end of June.", "authors": ["Rebekah F Ward", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190909&t=2&i=1427922825&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8811E", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
