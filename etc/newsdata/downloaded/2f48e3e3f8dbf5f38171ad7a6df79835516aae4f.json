Trump unhappy after Fed announces modest rate cut", "language": "en", "text": "Under pressure from Wall Street and the White House, the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates on Wednesday for a second straight meeting, but declined to signal if it would continue to drop rates in the future.\n\nIlhan Omar condemns Trump for spreading 'lies that put my life at risk' Read more\n\nCiting the global economic outlook and \u201cmuted\u201d inflationary pressures at home, the central bank decided to lower interest rates a quarter of a point to meet a target borrowing rate of 1.75% to 2%.\n\nThe cut was in line with the expectations of investors and economists, but the board showed it was not willing to schedule further cuts.\n\nThe decision showed Fed officials are split over where to set interest rates. Seven of 10 officials voted in favor of the cut, two opposed it and one argued for a larger half-point cut.\n\nThe board said: \u201cThis action supports the committee\u2019s view that sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the committee\u2019s symmetric 2% objective are the most likely outcomes, but uncertainties about this outlook remain.\u201d\n\nThe analytical firm Capital Economics noted the Fed was split over rates and said its economic projections were unchanged since July.\n\n\n\nThe breakdown of the split \u201csuggests most Fed officials still see a rebound in economic growth as their base-case scenario, which means any further rate cuts would be limited,\u201d it wrote in a note to investors.\n\nFinancial markets largely welcomed the news as a buffer against risks from a global slowdown and uncertainty over Donald Trump\u2019s trade policies.\n\nBut some analysts warned the cut could do more harm than good.\n\nKerstin Braun of the Stenn Group said: \u201cReal capital growth and real economic activity are driven by long-term interest rates, which are functions of expected future inflation and investor confidence.\u201d\n\nWith rates head toward zero, Braun added, \u201cbanks have no incentive to loan money, making credit actually tighter for companies that want to grow\u201d.\n\nThe cut was immediately criticized by Trump, who last week said the Fed\u2019s \u201cboneheads\u2019\u2019 should reduce rates to zero or lower. Trump is counting on a strong economy fueled by cheap money to boost his reelection chances next year.\n\n\u201cJay Powell and the Federal Reserve Fail Again. No \u2018guts,\u2019 no sense, no vision! A terrible communicator!\u201d Trump said in a tweet following the announcement.\n\nAt his news conference in July, Powell surprised markets by calling the rate cut then a \u201cmid-cycle adjustment\u201d. In comments on Wednesday Powell said the economic outlook was broadly \u201cfavorable\u201d but warned that a \u201csequence\u201d of rate cuts could be needed if economy turns.\n\nhe analytical firm Capital Economics noted that the Fed is still split over rates and its economic projections unchanged since July.\n\nThat, it wrote in a note to investors, \u201csuggests most Fed officials still see a rebound in economic growth as their base case scenario, which means any further rate cuts would be limited.\u201d\n\nBut some analysts warned the cut could do more harm than good.\n\n\u201cReal capital growth and real economic activity are driven by long-term interest rates, which are functions of expected future inflation and investor confidence,\u201d said Dr Kerstin Braun, President of Stenn Group, an international provider of trade finance.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why a cut in short-term rates is unlikely to fuel business investment and manufacturing. Uncertainty around the global economy and the impact of the trade war has killed any appetite to invest.\u201d\n\nWith rates head toward zeo, Braun added, \u201cbanks have no incentive to loan money, making credit actually tighter for companies that want to grow.\u201d", "description": "Central bank approves quarter-point rate cut in line with economists\u2019 expectations as Trump tweets: \u2018Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve fail again!\u2019", "authors": ["Edward Helmore"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/811f8f88abfec50118a4bb1cc81727f53c77f2ad/0_141_5181_3109/master/5181.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=15ec3422b09a965f794c7c9839245437", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
