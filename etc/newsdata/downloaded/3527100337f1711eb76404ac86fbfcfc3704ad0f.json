But he intends to turn that to his advantage.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump has made a calculation that it\u2019s better be on hostile terms than friendly terms with California because it works as a very convenient political foil for him,\u201d said Bill Whalen, a media consultant for California politicians including the ex-governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. \u201cHe was elected by predominantly blue-collar workers in the middle of the country and California is \u2018exhibit A\u2019 in their concerns about there the country is headed.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s trip west raised millions of dollars from rich Republican donors and allowed him to view construction of his long promised border wall. But he also seized the opportunity to exploit the homelessness crisis in big cities.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t let Los Angeles, San Francisco and numerous other cities destroy themselves by allowing what\u2019s happening,\u201d Trump said, suggesting that it is causing residents of those cities to leave the country. \u201cThey can\u2019t believe what\u2019s happening.\u201d\n\nFlying back to Washington on Air Force One, he said the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) would act against San Francisco, accusing the city of allowing a huge amount of waste, including needles, to go through storm drains into the ocean.\n\nImmigration, rail funding and lawsuits: why California and Trump are at war Read more\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a terrible situation that\u2019s in Los Angeles and in San Francisco,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to be giving San Francisco \u2013 they\u2019re in total violation \u2013 we\u2019re going to be giving them a notice very soon.\u201d\n\nTrump had also announced via Twitter that his administration was revoking California\u2019s authority to set CO2 emissions rules that exceed federal standards. He insisted the action would result in safe, less expensive cars and more jobs for Americans but was roundly condemned.\n\nThe California congressman Adam Schiff, long a thorn in Trump\u2019s side, tweeted in response: \u201cWhile Trump launches an all-out assault on the environment, rolling back protections for endangered species, our water, and our air \u2013 California remains steadfast. We will not allow our natural resources to be tarnished for generations to come. Not on our watch.\u201d\n\nCalifornia was not always hostile territory to Republicans and was home to the former presidents Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan. But in the current era of political polarisation, it has turned deep blue. In last year\u2019s midterm elections, Democrats gained control of all seven House seats whose districts include Orange county, a conservative stronghold where Nixon was born and raised.\n\nTrump and California have gone toe to toe during his two and a half years in office in politics, in the media and especially in court. The state attorney general, Xavier Becerra, has filed more than 50 lawsuits against the White House over issues including immigration, healthcare and the environment, successfully slowing or blocking some initiatives.\n\nJessica Levinson, who teaches at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, told the New York Times in April: \u201cIt\u2019s bloody combat. This isn\u2019t a cold war. It\u2019s a scorching hot war. And that\u2019s politically expedient for both sides.\u201d\n\nCalifornia is not merely on the defence. Mindful that Trump is the first president for four decades not to make his taxes public, it passed a law that requires candidates for president and governor to release five years\u2019 worth of tax returns to appear on the state\u2019s primary ballot. This received a setback on Thursday when a federal judge ordered a temporary injunction, though officials are likely to appeal.\n\nCulturally, also, although he owns a golf club and other properties in the state, the brash New Yorker finds little comfort in California, where his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame has been repeatedly vandalised. Trump regularly clashes with actors including Robert De Niro, Debra Messing, Bette Middler, Meryl Streep and Barbara Streisand. He has been denounced from the stage of the Oscars and sought revenge by deriding its TV ratings.\n\nHis political foes include California\u2019s Schiff, Senator Kamala Harris, Representative Maxine Waters and the governor, Gavin Newsom, who told HBO\u2019s Axios programme that Republicans were \u201cfinished\u201d and likely to become the third party at a national level in 10 to 15 years. He said of Trump: \u201cHe has blatantly expressed racist points of view and expressed them on multitudes of occasions during the campaign and since.\u201d\n\nThe vice-president, Mike Pence, and other allies join Trump in portraying the state as dominated by liberal elites out of touch with the American heartland. Kevin McCarthy, the House minority leader, insisted that the president was merely highlighting the shortcomings of Democratic leaders who have dominated California for years. \u201cWhen he\u2019s talking about homelessness and solving that problem, and affordability, that goes across party lines,\u201d he told the Associated Press.\n\n\u201cDrive around \u2013 every community, even in Bakersfield \u2013 homelessness is the number one issue,\u201d McCarthy said, referring to his own district in the rural Central Valley, just outside Los Angeles.\n\nFor Trump, the message is, if you want to see the future under Democrats, look at California Bill Whalen\n\nIn July, California became the first state in the country to offer government-subsidised health benefits to young undocumented immigrants, just one example of how the state often leads on issues still being contested by the 2020 Democratic candidates for president.\n\nWhalen, now a research fellow at the Hoover Institution in Palo Alto, said: \u201cDemocrats won\u2019t have a debate in California but they are having a debate about California. For Trump, the message is, if you want to see the future under Democrats, look at California.\u201d\n\nThis year a man who wore a \u201cMake America great again\u201d hat in a Starbucks in Palo Alto was berated by a woman, who then threatened him on Facebook (she later lost her job). Whalen said: \u201cIf you\u2019re a Trump supporter in this part of California, you tread lightly and don\u2019t put a Trump bumper sticker on your car. There\u2019s been a strain of crazy liberalism in California for some time but Trump exacerbated it because of the nature of his victory and because he likes to pick at the wound.\u201d", "description": "On a rare visit to the state where he faces almost certain defeat Trump attacked the handling of homelessness\u2013 and raised millions from rich Republican donors", "authors": ["David Smith"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af1b67bccd5c2fcc2fc4271dbab7fe10eae75350/0_371_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6b07aef59fe177ef50f7bdb86475ae50", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
