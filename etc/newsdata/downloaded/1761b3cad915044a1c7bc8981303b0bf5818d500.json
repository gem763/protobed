This line never made any sense to me before until now.\n\nUnsplash\n\nI\u2019ve been the sort of person who always speaks their mind and contributes to enough conversations. It was never a bad thing. I debate, I put my opinions forward and express myself in full strength.\n\nThis, however, also made me a person who\u2019d react to almost everything.\n\nUnsplash\n\nMy dad is one person who used to say that \u201cMuh main zubaan aur jeb mai paisa ho toh kuch karna mushkil nahi hai.\u201d I guess, I took the first half of that saying a little too seriously.\n\nDon't Miss 415 SHARES 431 SHARES\n\nI realised I am turning into a person who has to react to every tiny thing. Things that are not even worth considering and things that are creating chaos in my head, which I felt was unhealthy.\n\nSo, I stopped. I soon began to see positive changes that gave me immense peace.\n\nunsplash\n\nI started to gain control over my emotions which I was losing over a period of time. I also started to identify topics that apparently triggered me the most. This is when I got to know I\u2019ve been reacting to a whole set of things that are not even contributing to my life enough to make me the person that I want to be.\n\nIt is highly important to have control over your emotions. It shapes you for the better. Secondly, I realised how people and their views were affecting me too much because reacting to everything was a priority for me.\n\nToday, I feel happy with myself. That was ever since I sat down and took the time to figure out all of the stuff mentioned above. Too many reactions to everything was making me upset overtime. It used to drain my energy to a level where all I had was distress.\n\nUnsplash\n\nI also realised I was not being productive about things that should top my list of priorities. I started to work on that too. I am now more appreciated in my personal and professional lives.\n\nI even lost a few friends along the way. May be they didn't like the the aggressive behaviour that usually followed every statement.\n\nHowever, I now also know that not everyone deserves your reaction. Some people don\u2019t know themselves enough to have a thoughtful conversation with. One should not only live in the present but think enough if the thing that made you react a certain way will make a difference in your life.\n\nUnsplash\n\nMore than anything, it is the sense of peace that I attained that I am thankful for most. There's more clarity in my life now than ever before.", "description": "I learned that since I was putting myself a little too much there, I was not being productive about things that should top my list of priorities.
