But dog, how the fuck is Ivanka Trump in the trunk of my car?\u2026 Cause I feel somewhat responsible for the dumb little blonde girl, that motherfuckin\u2019 baton twirler that got dumped in the pond. Second murder with no recollection of it \u2026\u201d he rapped on Fame.\n\n\u201cThis is not the first time MATHERS made threatening comments towards POTUS and his family,\u201d the documents stated. \u201cIn June 2017, MATHERS freestyled comments that were threatening in nature towards POTUS.\u201d\n\nStrangely, the agency seems to have been alerted to the lyrics on Revival by an employee of the tabloid TMZ, just hours after they had published an article about Eminem\u2019s criticism of Trump.\n\n\u201cI want to know if your agency is investigating Eminem for his threatening lyrics about first daughter Ivanka Trump,\u201d the concerned citizen at TMZ asked.\n\nAfter meeting with the musician and his lawyers, the Secret Service ultimately declined to refer to matter to federal prosecutors.", "description": "Documents show agency interviewed rapper in December of 2017 about lyrics disparaging the president and his family", "authors": ["Luke O'Neil"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e4deb70f67c77458b51e60aaa8613c75bfe30e7/0_1685_3744_2246/master/3744.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6e4ce1e0c529b8fdcecdd1602881a62f", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
