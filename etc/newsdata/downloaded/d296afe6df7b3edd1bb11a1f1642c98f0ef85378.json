Mr Trump was not present for the event.\n\n\"This video was not approved, seen, or sanctioned\" by the event's organisers, Mr Phillips said.\n\nThe setting for the massacre depicted is the video is the \"Church of Fake News,\" echoing Trump's familiar refrain about news stories and organizations that he deems unfair.\n\nCNN, The Washington Post, the BBC, PBS, NBC and Politico are among the news organisations depicted as victims of the fake Trump's violent fury.\n\nThe video also includes the logo for Mr Trump's 2020 campaign, but spokesman Tim Murtaugh said the \"video was not produced by the campaign, and we do not condone violence.\"\n\nThe White House Correspondents Association, which represents journalists covering the president, had issued a statement late Sunday saying it was \"horrified\" by the content and calling on Trump to offer his condemnation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"All Americans should condemn this depiction of violence directed toward journalists and the President's political opponents,\" said Jonathan Karl, WHCA president. \"We have previously told the President his rhetoric could incite violence. Now we call on him and everybody associated with this conference to denounce this video and affirm that violence has no place in our society.\"\n\nThe video appears to have first been posted to a YouTube page in July 2018, where it has been viewed more than 100,000 times since. The YouTube video uses a violent clip from the 2014 spy thriller Kingsman: The Secret Service. In the original scene, actor Colin Firth is depicted shooting a crowd of churchgoers.\n\nThe channel frequently posts violent parody videos of Trump playing popular movie superheroes or assassins. An email account listed for the YouTube channel did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nPhillips told the Times the video was played as part of a \"meme exhibit\" and was not associated with or endorsed by the conference \"in any official capacity.\"\n\n\"American Priority rejects all political violence,\" he told the paper.\n\nAAP", "description": "Supporters of Donald Trump were shown a violent parody video featuring the US President hitting a Democratic congresswoman and shooting characters representing the media.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_7/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/2f6690b9948ddd6d530449e430838f9c18a1edd0", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
