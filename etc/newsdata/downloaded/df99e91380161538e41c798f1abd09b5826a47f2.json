So any reprieve to ISIS granted by America\u2019s abrupt withdrawal may be temporary.\n\nBut a larger and more critical point is that the challenge facing Russia and its client regime in Syria\u2014not just consolidating control of Syria but rebuilding a devastated country\u2014leaves Russia with no interest in the further destabilization of the Middle East. Which is good, because it\u2019s hard to imagine the Middle East getting much more unstable\u2014especially along the fault line between Iran and Syria on the one hand and Israel and Saudi Arabia on the other\u2014without another disastrous war breaking out.\n\nRussia has already shown signs of being able to play a constructive role here\u2014a fact that, oddly, has been emphasized even by some who buy the \u201cgift to Putin\u201d thesis. Hal Brands of the American Enterprise Institute\u2014in a Bloomberg Opinion essay titled, \u201cPutin Conquered the Middle East.
