REUTERS/Al Drago\n\n\u201cI am concerned that California is being unfairly targeted,\u201d Feinstein, a Democrat who represents the state, said in her letter to Charles Sheehan, deputy inspector general of the EPA.\n\nIn response to the letter, an EPA spokesperson said: \u201cEPA\u2019s actions are not political. We will continue to work toward fulfilling the mission of the Agency.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Andrew Wheeler sent a letter to California\u2019s top air regulator threatening to withhold the federal highway funding, saying the state \u201chas failed to carry out its most basic tasks under the Clean Air Act,\u201d and not produced timely plans to meet targets for air quality goals.\n\nFeinstein\u2019s letter said \u201cthis issue of backlogged state implementation plans is nothing more than a pretext to attack California, rather than a good-faith effort to help improve California\u2019s air quality.\u201d\n\nHer letter was the latest flashpoint between California and the Trump administration over the state\u2019s defense of its own stricter clean air and water rules, such as tighter vehicle emission standards that are followed by more than a dozen states.\n\nFeinstein disputed that backlogged state implementation plans were due to California inaction. She cited one example where a state plan was awaiting EPA approval, and another where the state still had one year to comply.\n\nShe asked the inspector general to investigate whether over three dozen states with similar issues are being targeted.\n\n\u201cThere are no reports suggesting that any of those other states received a threat like the one sent to California to their transportation funding,\u201d the letter said.\n\nFeinstein said by withholding highway funds, the EPA would deprive California one of its biggest tools to improve air quality.\n\nCalifornia had imposed strict state limits on vehicle emissions in defiance of Trump\u2019s attempts to roll back federal clean car regulations. Tailpipe emissions are regulated separately from ambient air pollutants, but California argues the vehicle rules are essential to meeting those goals.\n\nTrump\u2019s Justice Department this month opened an antitrust probe of four major automakers that struck a deal this month to adopt California\u2019s stricter emissions standards. President Donald Trump said he would revoke California\u2019s legal authority to set more stringent standards.\n\nThe administration this year also withheld $929 million from California\u2019s high-speed rail project awarded in 2010, prompting the state to sue.\n\nOn Thursday, EPA\u2019s Wheeler accused California of violating clean water laws by allowing human waste from homeless residents to enter waterways.", "description": "U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein on Friday called for a probe into whether politics instead of pollution was behind the Trump administration's threat this week to withhold more than $4 billion in federal transportation funding from California over claims of poor air quality.", "authors": ["Valerie", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190927&t=2&i=1434615059&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8Q1I1", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
