The referendum was pressure, the referendum was difficult,\u201d Cummings said, according to the Daily Telegraph newspaper.\n\n\u201cThis is a walk in the park compared to that. All the Vote Leave team, we are enjoying this, we are going to win, we are going to leave, don\u2019t worry,\u201d he said in a rare public appearance.\n\nIn 2016, 17.4 million voters, or 52%, backed Brexit while 16.1 million, or 48%, voted to remain. The country and parliament remain bitterly divided, with no majority support among lawmakers for the main options: a deal, a no-deal exit, a second referendum, or remaining in the EU.\n\nOn Tuesday, Johnson suffered a humiliating defeat in Britain\u2019s top court which ruled his suspension of parliament was unlawful, a decision which led to the reconvening of the hostile legislature where he has no majority and has lost a succession of votes.\n\nIn a febrile and vitriolic session on Wednesday, Johnson was accused of inflaming tensions which had led to death threats against lawmakers by using words such as surrender and betrayal in his description of those who opposed Brexit.\n\nJohnson has declined to apologise and said delivering Brexit would \u201clance the boil\u201d. Cummings agreed, saying many lawmakers and those in London were out of touch with the sentiment of the rest of the country.\n\n\u201cThe MPs (lawmakers) said we will have a referendum and we will respect the result. Then they spent three years swerving all over the shop. It is not surprising that some people are angry about it,\u201d the Telegraph quoted him as saying.\n\n\u201cFor me it says that fundamentally a lot of people in parliament are more of out touch with the country now than they were in summer 2016.\u201d\n\nCummings, the key figure in Johnson\u2019s Brexit strategy, has been cast by allies as a ruthless strategist who cares little for the conventions of traditional British politics and by enemies variously as an anarchist, Britain\u2019s Rasputin or a political vandal.\n\nHe gave no indication of what his plans for Brexit were, but said the current fevered atmosphere could only be addressed by parliament delivering on the 2016 vote.\n\n\u201cIf anybody thinks that turning around after three years of abject failure in parliament and then saying \u2018no, we are sorry everyone we have completely failed let\u2019s have another vote\u2019. If they think that is going to work and that is going to wash they will get a terrible, terrible shock,\u201d he said.", "description": "Dominic Cummings, Prime Minister Boris Johnson's senior adviser, said on Thursday the current Brexit maelstrom was a \"walk in the park\" compared to the 2016 EU referendum, saying there was no pressure and they were enjoying it, the Daily Telegraph said.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1434307621&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P233", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
