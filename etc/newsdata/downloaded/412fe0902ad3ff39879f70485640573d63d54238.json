It was the first negative monthly trade balance since November 2017 and only the third in the last 20 years.\n\nOil and gas, which normally contribute about half of export revenues, declined to around 39%, SSB's data showed.\n\nThe value of gas exports declined 68% year-on-year as prices fell and volumes dropped by more than a third due to maintenance work at offshore platforms and distribution terminals.\n\nThe value of crude exports fell 19%, mainly due to lower prices.\n\nState-controlled oil firm Equinor this month began production from its Johan Sverdrup oil field, the largest North Sea crude discovery since the 1980s, which is expected to provide a significant boost to exports.\n\nThe year-to-date trade surplus fell to 106.3 billion crowns from 206.4 billion in 2018.\n\n($1 = 9.1188 Norwegian crowns) (Reporting by Terje Solsvik; editing by John Stonestreet)", "description": "OSLO, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Norway on Tuesday reported its  first monthly trade deficit in almost two years, triggered by a  sharp fall in sales of natural gas...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
