In the next hours, the Americans threw the Pentagon\u2019s arsenal at them, including B-52 strategic bombers. The attack was stopped.\n\nThat operation, in the middle of the U.S.-led campaign against the Islamic State group in Syria, showed the extent to which the U.S. military was willing to protect the Syrian Kurds, its main ally on the ground.\n\nBut now, with the White House revoking protection for these Kurdish fighters, some of the Special Forces officers who battled alongside the Kurds say they feel deep remorse at orders to abandon their allies.\n\n\u201cThey trusted us and we broke that trust,\u201d one Army officer who has worked alongside the Kurds in northern Syria said last week in a telephone interview. \u201cIt\u2019s a stain on the American conscience.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m ashamed,\u201d said another officer who had also served in northern Syria. Both officers spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid reprisals from their chains of command.\n\nAnd the response from the Kurds themselves was just as stark. \u201cThe worst thing in military logic and comrades in the trench is betrayal,\u201d said Shervan Darwish, an official allied with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces.\n\nThe next flurry of orders from Washington, as some troops had feared, will pull U.S. troops out of northern Syria altogether. Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper said Sunday that President Donald Trump had ordered the roughly 1,000 U.S. troops in the country\u2019s northeast to conduct a \u201cdeliberate withdrawal\u201d out of the country in the coming days and weeks.\n\nThe defense secretary\u2019s statement came after comments Friday pushing back on complaints that the United States was betraying allies in Syria \u2014 \u201cWe have not abandoned the Kurds\u201d \u2014 even as he acknowledged that his Turkish counterpart had ignored his plea to stop the offensive.\n\nArmy Special Forces soldiers \u2014 mostly members of the 3rd Special Forces Group \u2014 moved last week to consolidate their positions in the confines of their outposts miles away from the Syrian border, a quiet withdrawal that all but confirmed the United States\u2019 capitulation to the Turkish military\u2019s offensive to clear Kurdish-held areas of northern Syria.\n\nBut as the Americans pulled back, the Kurds moved north to try to reinforce their comrades fighting the offensive. The U.S. soldiers could only watch from their sandbag-lined walls. Orders from Washington were simple: Hands off. Let the Kurds fight for themselves.\n\nThe orders contradicted the U.S. military\u2019s strategy in Syria over the last four years, especially when it came to the Kurdish fighters, known as the YPG, who were integral to routing the Islamic State group from northeastern Syria. The Kurds had fought in Manbij, Raqqa and deep into the Euphrates River Valley, hunting the last Islamic State fighters in the group\u2019s now defunct physical caliphate. But the Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF, as the Kurdish and their allied Arab fighters on the ground are called, are being left behind.\n\nFighters with the Syrian Democratic Forces near Baghuz, then the last Islamic State stronghold, in Syria, Feb. 2, 2019.
