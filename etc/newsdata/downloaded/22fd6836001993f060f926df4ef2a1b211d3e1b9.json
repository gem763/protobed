Ask (about) the future.\n\n\"I am trying to become the president of the future Sri Lanka. So if you concentrate on the future, it is better.\"\n\nHe said even the Tamils were more interested in jobs, education and infrastructure than raking over the past.\n\nThe Rajapakses insist no civilians were killed by government forces in the latter stages of the war, and accuse the rebels of using tens of thousands of civilians as human shields.\n\nAt least 100,000 people were killed in the conflict between 1972 and 2009.\n\nMahinda Rajapakse's administration was on the verge of international sanctions because of its refusal to investigate the alleged war crimes when he was defeated at the January 2015 elections.\n\nGotabhaya Rajapakse was addressing the press Tuesday for the first time since launching his bid to become president in an election scheduled for November 16.\n\nThe presidential poll has attracted a record 35 candidates, with nearly 16 million people eligible to vote.", "description": "Sri Lanka's front-running presidential candidate Gotabhaya Rajapakse vowed Tuesday that if elected he will scrap Colombo's pledge to investigate war crimes...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/13/wire-19739456-1571141867-351_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
