(Pictures: Shutterstock/Getty)\n\nIt\u2019s that time of year again \u2013 the temperature drops, the rainy weather sets in and all you want to do is snuggle up inside with a nice scented candle.\n\nBut, the nation\u2019s love of candles could be harming the environment, as well as causing damage to our bodies, due to the dangerous toxins they release.\n\nIn a positive move, earlier this year, Michael Gove (who was the Environment Secretary at the time) said that candle manufacturers will be told to reduce emissions in their scented candles.\n\nThankfully not all candles are harmful \u2013 so it\u2019s good to get to grips with what\u2019s what.\n\nWhy are candles dangerous?\n\nIt all pretty much comes down to one ingredient.\n\nMost scented candles contain paraffin wax, which is derived from petroleum, coal or shale oil. When it\u2019s burnt, paraffin wax releases toxic compounds into the air, including acetone, benzene, and toluene \u2013 all known carcinogens.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo not only are they damaging the environment but our health, too.\n\nOne study at South Carolina State University found that paraffin wax candles give off harmful fumes linked to lung cancer and asthma, although researchers said it would take years of regular use for it to be a significant health risk.\n\nSadly, the bad news doesn\u2019t stop there.\n\nParaffin candles also produce a fair bit of soot \u2013 the black stuff caused from flickering flames \u2013 and when the soot is airborne it can be inhaled.\n\nThese particles can find their way into the deepest depth of the lungs, as well as the lower respiratory tract and alveoli, according to a study published in MSD Manual \u2013 and this doesn\u2019t sound too healthy.\n\nDespite the risks, brands tend to use paraffin because it\u2019s cheaper than other types of wax. It also helps to create a stronger-smelling fragrance than natural waxes.\n\nBack in March, Douglas Booker of the National Air Quality Testing Services (NAQTS) shared his thoughts with the Daily Mail, and said: \u2018When scented candles are burned, they give off tiny particles, so small that you could fit a thousand of them across a single human hair.\n\n\u2018The problem with particles this small is that they can get into the bloodstream, and they have been associated with both short- and long-term health problems, including asthma and cardiovascular disease.\u2019\n\nAre all candles toxic?\n\nThe short answer is no, which will be music to a lot of people\u2019s ears \u2013 the trick is to opt for natural candles, made from renewable resources.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSoy wax candles are a great alternative as they don\u2019t contain toxic pollutants and produce significantly significantly less soot than a paraffin product. These candles do not burn as hot as paraffin wax candles, but they burn slower and so will usually last around 30-50% longer.\n\nIt\u2019s worth pointing out that while soy candles might seem like an eco-friendly option, they are still a by-product of the soybean industry \u2013 which has growing concerns around deforestation and its use of pesticides and fertilisers.\n\nBeeswax candles are another option. They can help clean the air while they burn as it\u2019s said they release negative ions \u2013 which clears pollen, mold spores, bacteria and viruses. They also tend to burn for longer than both paraffin and soy candles. Although \u2013 as the name suggests \u2013 these candles would not be suitable for vegans.\n\nSome other wax products are also made from minerals and vegetables, and tend to release fewer particles into the air when they burn. High street brands like Jo Malone use these types of ingredients in their candles, but they often come with a hefty price tag.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to be aware of how candles are made to smell nice.\n\nNatural fragrances are created with essential oils \u2013 derived from plants and flowers \u2013 whereas synthetic fragrances are man-made, usually from petroleum-based chemicals. This means you\u2019re once again exposed to dangerous toxins.\n\nNathalie Allard, founder of organic candle company Petits Rituels, said: \u2018For essential oils, there are no dangers (as long as you don\u2019t inhale them in their concentrated form).\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Once natural oils are inhaled into the body they re-modulate themselves and work in a friendly way.\u2019\n\nWho is at risk?\n\nIt\u2019s important to know how different types of candles affect you (Picture: Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nAnyone who burns a scented candle, or is near a scented candle, could be a risk of inhaling the particles emitted.\n\nThe chemicals released from paraffin candles can be especially harmful to people with respiratory conditions, such as asthma.\n\nEmma Rubach, head of health advice at Asthma UK, told Metro.co.uk: \u2018Scented candles could cause people with asthma to cough, wheeze or even have a potentially life-threatening asthma attack as strong scents from perfumed products could be a trigger for an estimated 2.5million people with asthma in the UK.\u2019\n\n\u2018Although we don\u2019t yet know exactly which chemicals or fragrances are most likely to trigger people with asthma, our advice is for people to avoid them if they notice they cough more or get symptoms such as breathlessness around scented candles.\n\n\u2018While it\u2019s difficult to avoid candle scents, you could tell your friends and neighbours about how they affect you and ask them not to use them when you are around. You could also try using battery-operated tealights if you want to create a calming atmosphere without the risk of triggering an attack.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat to do if you love candles?\n\nKnowledge is power.\n\nWhen buying new candles, check the list of ingredients.\n\nLook out for an unscented candle or a wax that has been scented with essential oils, rather than a synthetic fragrance.\n\nAlso don\u2019t be fooled by \u2018natural\u2019 labelling. Industry experts have said candle companies only need to include 51% of natural ingredients to call a product \u2018natural\u2019 \u2013 the rest can be synthetic.\n\nBurning candles for less time is a good way to reduce the amount of particles sent into the air and keeping a room well-ventilated will also help.\n\nMORE: Aldi launches range of Bake Off dessert inspired candles \u2013 and there\u2019s a Jaffa Cake one\n\nMORE: Poundland launches new cocktail inspired scented candles for \u00a31 each\n\nMORE: Is blowing out candles on a birthday cake actually really unhygienic?\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "The nation\u2019s love of candles could be harming the environment and even causing damage to our bodies \u2013 here's what to know.", "authors": ["Lizzie Thomson"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_89442840_1570809756.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
