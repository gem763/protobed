China officials\u2019 visas, demands end to Uighur \u2018repression\u2019", "language": "en", "text": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 The United States said Tuesday it would curb visas for Chinese officials until Beijing ends its \u201crepression\u201d of Uighurs and other Muslims in the western region of Xinjiang, a day after imposing commercial restrictions.\n\nThe one-two punch by President Donald Trump\u2019s administration marks the most forceful attempt by a foreign power to address what some rights groups call a historic crisis in Xinjiang, and comes amid a range of feuds between the United States and China.\n\n\u201cChina has forcibly detained over one million Muslims in a brutal, systematic campaign to erase religion and culture in Xinjiang,\u201d Secretary of State Mike Pompeo wrote on Twitter.\n\n\u201cChina must end its draconian surveillance and repression, release all those arbitrarily detained and cease its coercion of Chinese Muslims abroad,\u201d he said.\n\nIn an accompanying statement, Pompeo said that the State Department would restrict visas granted to government and ruling Communist Party officials involved in \u201cdetention or abuse\u201d of Uighurs, Kazakhs or members of other predominantly Muslim ethnic groups in Xinjiang.\n\nThe order will also affect their family members, including children who may be seeking to study in the United States.\n\nThe State Department said it could not specify which officials were affected due to US confidentiality laws.\n\nBut lawmakers have specifically asked for action against Chen Quanguo, the Communist Party chief for Xinjiang.\n\nReputed within the party for his handling of minority groups, he earlier led iron-fisted policies aimed at crushing dissent in Tibet.\n\n\u2013 Defying Chinese protests \u2013\n\nChina voiced anger at the move, denying any human rights abuses in Xinjiang and accusing the United States of using \u201cmade-up pretexts for its interference.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe counter-terrorism and de-radicalization measures in Xinjiang are aimed to eradicate the breeding soil of extremism and terrorism,\u201d the Chinese embassy in Washington said on Twitter.\n\n\u201cThey are in line with Chinese laws and international practices,and are supported by all 25 million people of various ethnic groups in Xinjiang,\u201d it said.\n\nThe visa step came hours after China issued a similar protest over action by the US Commerce Department.\n\nIt blacklisted 28 Chinese entities including video surveillance firm Hikvision and artificial intelligence companies Megvii Technology and SenseTime over their involvement in Xinjiang.\n\nRights groups say more than one million Uighurs and other Muslims are being held in a vast network of camps in Xinjiang aimed at homogenizing the population to reflect China\u2019s majority Han culture.\n\nWitnesses say that China has sought to force Uighurs to drop core practices of Islam such as fasting during Ramadan and abstaining from alcohol and pork.\n\nChina, after initially denying the camps, describes them as vocational schools aimed at dampening the allure of Islamist extremism and violence.\n\nAuthorities have cracked down especially hard since 2009, when nearly 200 people died in riots in Xinjiang\u2019s capital Urumqi, which has seen an influx of Han Chinese.\n\nThe violence was sparked by news of a factory brawl in southern China in which two Uighur migrant workers were killed.\n\nPompeo has previously called China\u2019s treatment of Uighurs one of the \u201cworst stains on the world\u201d and likened the camps to actions by Nazi Germany.\n\nBut few Muslim leaders have spoken out against a rising China with the exception of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, which has linguistic and cultural connections with the Uighurs.\n\nRights advocates also say that Trump has been inconsistent in exercising pressure over human rights, with the tycoon president warmly embracing authoritarian leaders of allies such as Egypt and Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe actions on Xinjiang come as a trade war shows no signs of abating between the United States and China, the world\u2019s two largest economies, which have imposed tariffs on billions of dollars worth of each other\u2019s goods.\n\nAt the United Nations last month, Trump also warned China that the United States was watching Hong Kong, where months of swelling protests have demanded that Beijing respect the city\u2019s semi-autonomous status.", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 The United States said Tuesday it would curb visas for Chinese
