Bush on her daytime talk show. \u201cJust because I don\u2019t agree with someone on everything doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m not going to be friends with them,\u201d she told the audience (and over 28 million viewers to date on Instagram and Twitter combined). \u201cWhen I say \u2018be kind to one another,\u2019 I don\u2019t mean only the people that think the same way that you do, I mean be kind to everyone,\u201d she said.\n\nDeGeneres\u2019s take earned the praise of many, including fellow celebrities like Reese Witherspoon, Kendall Jenner, Jamie Foxx, Jennifer Garner, Orlando Bloom, and Lenny Kravitz.\n\nI can\u2019t get over this. Celebs are insane. pic.twitter.com/wKe2d00LzW \u2014 Bustopher Walken (@Douchetoevsky) October 8, 2019\n\nHowever, many also took issue with DeGeneres and co.'s willingness to overlook Bush\u2019s history, including his decision to march the country into war in Iraq, Pakistan, and Afghanistan following the 9/11 terrorist attacks, which resulted in the deaths of 250,000 civilians, according to a study by Brown University. He has also been accused of war crimes.\n\nThis is a bad take and you should re-examine it. Sometimes you have to be kind by protecting other people and holding the powerful, especially powerful criminals, to account.\n\n\n\nGWB is a war criminal. Treating him normally normalizes war crimes.\n\n\n\n\u2014 \ud83d\udc7b Online Voting \ud83d\udc7b / Matt W (@MJWhitehead) October 9, 2019\n\nYou know what's \"interesting\" about this whole rehabilitation Bush/Ellen BS is that the same will be done with the racist in charge.\n\n\n\n\"You know he's not so bad. I mean yeah, sure kids in cages and supremacy and all that but he's pretty funny...\"\n\n\n\n\u2014 Lilliam Rivera (@lilliamr) October 9, 2019\n\nEllen killed people with kindness, Bush killed people with torture and bombs.

But since it's a million dead Iraqis and Afghans, no big deal. \u2014 Remi Kanazi (@Remroum) October 8, 2019\n\nthis whole thing is really not more complicated than class solidarity https://t.co/Oc1KvZYsGr \u2014 Emma Roller (@emmaroller) October 9, 2019\n\nThe fact that Ellen made friends with George W. Bush is proof that class is one of the most important divides in American life.\n\n\n\nShe goes on TV and makes jokes about yukking it up with rich friends.\n\n\n\nShe'll never meet the millions of poor people whose lives he ruined. pic.twitter.com/aSNDQj6nLT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 Arlen Parsa (@arlenparsa) October 8, 2019\n\nRELATED: People Are Mad at Ellen DeGeneres for Sitting Next to George W.

What a monstrous leader. I now understand the rage.. \u2014 Jameela Jamil \ud83c\udf08 (@jameelajamil) October 9, 2019\n\nThis response elicited a backlash of its own, with people tweeting that she should have known earlier, as she was in her twenties when he left office.\n\njameela jamil claiming to be an activist but having to google the Iraq war despite having been in her 20s when it was happening is why I know anything I put my mind to will happen. it's actually inspirational. from today im an engineer. \u2014 \ud83e\udd8e (@zamarudd) October 9, 2019", "description": "The talk show host's viral meditation on kindness has sparked a major conflict on social media.", "authors": ["Isabel Jones"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/2MYWlJGgCs7.UefTxe_ncg--~B/aD0xODc0O3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/instyle_846/cc768131c2f86ac973fd565d2d5d4c90", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
