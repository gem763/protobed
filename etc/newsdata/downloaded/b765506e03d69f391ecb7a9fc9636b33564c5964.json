Agatha Christie\u2019s The Murder of Roger Ackroyd\u2019", "language": "en", "text": "The writer on \u2018the boss\u2019 Janet Malcolm, grappling with the Libor scandal and being read the Narnia books by his father\n\nThe book I am currently reading\n\nBudd Schulberg\u2019s Moving Pictures: Memoirs of a Hollywood Prince. He was the son of an early studio boss, and wrote On the Waterfront. I\u2019m addicted to early Hollywood stories at the moment, and Schulberg had the most extraordinary life.\n\nThe book that changed my life\n\nOh man, where to start? There are probably 100 titles that I could mention here. But how about an early one: Agatha Christie\u2019s The Murder of Roger Ackroyd. I was 12 or so when I read it. I will never forget the sheer delicious shock of that ending, and realising \u2013 maybe for the first time \u2013 that it was possible to tell a story in a way that made the reader gasp. I\u2019ve been chasing that same result (not nearly as successfully) ever since.\n\nThe book I wish I\u2019d written\n\nJanet Malcolm\u2019s The Journalist and the Murderer, or, for that matter, anything by her. She\u2019s the boss. The rest of us are just pretending.\n\nThe book that had the greatest influence on me\n\nThe Blind Side by Michael Lewis. It\u2019s the parable of the good Samaritan, only set in Memphis, involving a football player as the man by the side of the road and a wealthy white family as the Samaritan. It\u2019s worth reading two or three times \u2013 at minimum \u2013 because there\u2019s really not a word or moment out of place. It\u2019s just a pure, beautiful story.\n\nThe book that is most underrated\n\nJared Diamond\u2019s Guns, Germs and Steel is massively underrated. It had never occurred to me that the problem \u2013 or at least the limitation \u2013 of history is that it is written by historians, scholars with a predisposition towards a particular kind of narrative. So along comes someone who knows a lot about geology and geography, and history looks completely different. And the crazy thing is that Diamond isn\u2019t even trying to be disputatious or counterintuitive. It\u2019s just \u2013 this is what history looks like from another building in the university.\n\nThe book that changed my mind\n\nI\u2019m not dodging this question, I promise. But doesn\u2019t every book you read change your mind? Even if it\u2019s just a little bit? But OK. I was on holiday, in a rented house, and someone had left a copy of David Enrich\u2019s The Spider Network about the Libor scandal. was intended to convince me that Libor was a massive, disfiguring outrage. It didn\u2019t. In fact it left me completely confused about what exactly was supposed to have happened.\n\nThe last book that made me cry\n\nBooks don\u2019t make me cry. Movies and podcasts do. I need a voice.\n\nThe last book that made me laugh\n\nI recently reread Woody Allen\u2019s classic Without Feathers, which I hadn\u2019t read in 20 years. It\u2019s still as funny today as it was back then.\n\nThe book I couldn\u2019t finish\n\nI don\u2019t finish books all the time. But the last book I couldn\u2019t finish? I really, really wanted to finish John Carreyrou\u2019s book on the Theranos scam, Bad Blood. But halfway through, I started saying to myself: \u201cI get it! I get it! She made it all up!\u201d\n\nThe book I\u2019m most ashamed not to have read\n\nI\u2019ve never read any Tolstoy. It may have to wait until I have an extended period of free time, like if I\u2019m ever incarcerated.\n\nMy earliest reading memory\n\nMy father reading the Narnia books to me and my brother, when we were children.\n\nMy comfort read\n\nOld John le Carr\u00e9 thrillers.\n\nThe book I most often give as a gift\n\nFor some reason, I have gotten it into my head that everyone in my life needs to read Stone\u2019s Fall by Iain Pears.\n\nThe book I\u2019d most like to be remembered for\n\nMy next book!\n\n\u2022 Talking to Strangers: What We Should Know about the People We Don\u2019t Know by Malcolm Gladwell is published by Allen Lane (\u00a320).
