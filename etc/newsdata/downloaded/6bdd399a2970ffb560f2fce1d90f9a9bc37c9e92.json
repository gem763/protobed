The \u201cYou\u2019re So Vain\u201d singer is releasing a new memoir on Oct. 22 titled \u201cTouched by the Sun: My Friendship with Jackie,\u201d which details the political and fashion icon\u2019s thoughts about both of her husbands \u2014 President John F. Kennedy and Aristotle Onassis \u2014 as well as her two children.\n\n\u201cI was holding her hand, telling her I loved her and saying goodbye,\u201d recalled the 74-year-old in this week\u2019s issue of People magazine.\n\n\u201cThere was an otherworldly recording of monks singing, intermingled with sounds of uproarious laughter from the next room, where various Kennedys were having an Irish gathering. It was surreal.\u201d\n\nCARLY SIMON\u2019S PAL JACKIE KENNEDY ONASSIS SAID JFK MADE \u2018STUPID MISTAKES,\u2019 ARISTOTLE ONASSIS WAS \u2018VERY SEXY\u2019\n\nJACKIE KENNEDY ONASSIS REGRETTED NAMING JOHN F. KENNEDY JR. AFTER HIS FATHER, CLAIMS PAL\n\nAccording to Simon, it was Onassis\u2019 son John F. Kennedy Jr. who introduced his mother to her on Martha\u2019s Vineyard back in 1983. The two remained close until Onassis\u2019 death.\n\n\u201cI could be neurotic, bohemian and all over the place; she always had to be so correct,\u201d revealed the singer/songwriter. \u201cI was who she wasn\u2019t. I think she got a big kick out of that.\u201d\n\nWhen Onassis fell ill with non-Hodgkins lymphoma in 1993, Simon told the outlet she was there to support her friend \u2014 even though she initially learned about the devastating diagnosis from others.\n\nJACKIE KENNEDY'S ASSISTANT KATHY MCKEON DISHES ON THE FORMER FIRST LADY\n\n\u201cWomen of that generation didn\u2019t talk about illness,\u201d said Simon.\n\nOnassis was buried four days later next to her late husband at Arlington National Cemetery.\n\nAfter Onassis passed away, her son John Jr. gave a statement on the steps of her New York City apartment.\n\nJACKIE KENNEDY ONASSIS DEALT WITH SUICIDAL THOUGHTS OVER JFK ASSASSINATION, AUTHOR CLAIMS\n\n\u201cLast night, at around 10:15, my mother passed on,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cShe was surrounded by her friends and family and her books and the people and the things that she loved. And she did it in her own way, and we all feel lucky for that, and now she\u2019s in God\u2019s hands.\u201d\n\nSimon shared that while it was heartbreaking to lose Onassis, her friends were grateful that she passed before her son, who died five years later in a horrifying plane crash at age 38. His wife Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy, as well as her sister Lauren Bessette, perished in the 1999 accident.\n\nLEE RADZIWILL COMFORTED JACKIE KENNEDY AFTER JFK ASSASSINATION, BUT SIBLINGS HAD A \u2018COMPLICATED\u2019 RELATIONSHIP, REPORT SAYS\n\nJOHN F. KENNEDY JR. WAS READY TO PURSUE POLITICS, DETERMINED TO SAVE HIS MARRIAGE BEFORE PLANE CRASH, SAYS PAL\n\n\u201cThere was a communal sigh of relief that she didn\u2019t live to see that,\u201d said Simon.\n\nSimon previously told People magazine that while Onassis was 16 years older than her and notoriously private, it didn\u2019t take long for the two women to become friends.\n\nSimon said Onassis even talked about President Kennedy\u2019s adultery.\n\n\u201c[She] understood that he made some stupid mistakes,\u201d said Simon. However, she told the outlet that Onassis brushed off the affairs because \u201cshe knew he loved her more, much more.\u201d\n\nJACKIE KENNEDY ONASSIS WAS 'HORRIFIED' OF RECLUSE AUNT, COUSIN LIVING IN CRUMBLING GREY GARDENS, BOOK CLAIMS\n\nOnassis also got candid about her second husband, Aristotle Onassis, whom she married in 1968 \u2014 five years after Kennedy\u2019s 1963 assassination.\n\nCARLY SIMON'S EX-HUSBAND JAMES HART TELLS ALL IN NEW MEMOIR\n\n\u201cShe said he was very sexy \u2014 he would sing to her on his yacht and take her great places to make love,\u201d Simon recalled. \u201cShe knew marrying him was the bad-girl move. In a way, I never knew whether she was sticking up for her own decision or whether she really loved him.\u201d\n\nNo matter what was occurring in Onassis\u2019 love life, she remained fiercely protective of her son, John Jr., and daughter, Caroline Kennedy. Simon said Onassis was particularly worried about her son.\n\n\u201cJackie was very consumed with getting him on the right path,\u201d Simon explained. \u201cShe didn\u2019t approve of some of [the women] \u2014 she was horrified by Madonna.\u201d\n\nCARLY SIMON REVEALS SEAN CONNERY ASKED FOR M\u00c9NAGE-\u00c0-TROIS WITH HER SISTER\n\nJFK JR.\u2019S WIFE CAROLYN BESSETTE STRUGGLED TO FIT IN, RECEIVED STERN ADVICE FROM ETHEL KENNEDY, BOOK CLAIMS\n\nBut Simon also stressed that Onassis was \u201cincredibly funny.\u201d She described how the two women attended a recording session with opera singer Placido Domingo in 1990. The next day, Simon received a gushing letter and photograph from him. But when Simon called Onassis to share the exciting news, she got an unexpected revelation.\n\n\u201cShe paused for a long time, and then she said, \u2018Carly, did you really think it was from Placido?\u2019\u201d said Simon. \u201cShe\u2019d written it up herself and disguised her handwriting! The practical joker in her was nonstop.\u201d", "description": "Carly Simon still vividly remembers being at pal Jackie Kennedy Onassis\u2019 beside as she lay dying.", "authors": ["Stephanie Nolasco"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-585797865.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
