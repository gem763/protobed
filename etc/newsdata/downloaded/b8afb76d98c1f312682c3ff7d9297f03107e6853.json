Now, despite bizarre results, UN concerns and dozens of suicides directly linked to the shambolic process, senior politicians across India are talking about rolling it out nationwide.\n\nThe National Register of Citizens (NRC) was published online in its final form at the weekend. Applying only to the verdant, tea-growing northeastern state of Assam, its creation has cost the country 1.5bn rupees (\u00a316m) and the work of more than 52,000 officials. The human cost of the process, however, is a lot harder to calculate. As things stand, nearly two million people in Assam have been told that they are not citizens and, unless they successfully appeal, they face an uncertain future that could include being made stateless or put in a detention camp.\n\nAll of the state\u2019s 33 million residents were invited to apply to be included on the NRC, and asked to provide potentially dozens of documents that proved they or their descendants were residents of the state before 1971. That date is significant. Assam, with the draw of work at its tea plantations and a porous, 262km-long border with Bangladesh, has long been subject to migration from both other countries and other states.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe politicisation of this migration \u2013 immigrants were accused of threatening Assamese traditions and the rights of indigenous populations \u2013 led to violent clashes in the 1980s in which more than 2,000 Bengalis were killed by mobs, and no one ever prosecuted. In 1983, the government agreed to take action to curb illegal immigration and plans were made to update the original 1951 NRC, but the scale of the task meant it was put off indefinitely.\n\nFinally, in 2013, the Supreme Court of India ordered the update to go ahead, and said that the cut-off point after which a family would be considered illegal immigrants would be 1971 \u2013 the date of the formation of Bangladesh, and a period when high numbers of refugees fled across the border to escape violence.\n\nCritics said the process was little more than a thinly veiled, court-approved act of Islamophobia, designed to identify people vilified by Amit Shah as Bangladeshi Muslim \u201cinfiltrators\u201d. Shah, the now Home Minister, is Narendra Modi\u2019s right-hand man and had used the phrase \u201ctermites\u201d. Government officials from Modi\u2019s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) tried desperately to assert that the word \u201ctermite\u201d \u2013 deemak \u2013 was somehow less offensive in Hindi.\n\nAnd the completion of the NRC process, with the last two million additions to the list announced on 31 August, has received particular attention internationally as it came just a few weeks after the government announced its 5 August decision to withdraw unilaterally the autonomy of Kashmir and the break-up of its state.\n\nThough the Indian government rejects the idea of a link between events in the two states, they come after a second huge election victory for a Hindu nationalist BJP that stands accused of failing minorities and prioritising the Hindu majority. In the last couple of weeks, both state and central government officials have come out with statements designed to allay the fears of those left off the NRC, saying they have 120 days to appeal the decision at a local quasi-legal Foreigners Tribunal before, if they are unsuccessful, taking their case to the Assam High Court and ultimately the Supreme Court.\n\nYet for rights activists, such reassurances come far too late to a largely poor, mostly uneducated population in Assam, which has spent the better part of eight years with the threat of being declared \u201cforeigners\u201d or \u201cBangladeshis\u201d \u2013 an insult in this part of the world \u2013 hanging over them.\n\nCitizens for Justice and Peace, one of India\u2019s largest human rights NGOs, has been working for two years on the NRC issue, travelling to remote villages to help isolated tribal communities get what little documentation they have in order. The non-profit organisation estimates it has assisted more than one million people navigate the bureaucratic nightmare of proving their right to citizenship.\n\nIn that time they have been tracking what they call \u201cNRC-related deaths\u201d: suicides by people who have been or feared being excluded from the list and who did not want to be a financial burden on their families through a lengthy appeals process. There have been 65 such deaths so far, said Teesta Setalvad, CJP\u2019s national secretary, in an interview with The Independent.\n\n\u201cThe question is still open in terms of what happens to these people, and [no wonder] there is fear on the ground,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople who are teachers or who have government jobs don\u2019t know if they will be allowed to work any more. There are so many rumours, about statelessness, about detention camps.\u201d\n\nThe high number of suicides speaks to \u201cvery poor communication\u201d between officials and the people of Assam, as well as a \u201ccomplete lack of empathy\u201d, she said. \u201cIt is really quite shocking and shameful that they can be playing with people\u2019s lives like this. This is eventually a political issue, it should be dealt with in a mature political way.\u201d\n\nOne victim of this political decision was Rahim Ali, a father of five living in the Muslim village of Banti Pur. He hanged himself the day before his five children were to appear in front of a Foreigners Tribunal, worried that they would be excluded from the list and sent to a detention camp, his wife Halimun Nessa told the Associated Press.\n\n\u201cHe was saying we don\u2019t have any money to fight this case. He was thinking that his children will be taken away. He went to the market, came back and did this,\u201d she said. Another death came on 31 August itself when, after hearing rumours that her name was not on the list, 60-year-old Sayera Begum jumped into a well in northern Assam.\n\n\u201cShe was dragged out of the well and taken to the hospital, but she died,\u201d said Mukesh Agarwal, a senior Assam police official. An hour later, when the final list was released, it was found that Ms Begum, along with her husband and son, were not excluded after all.\n\nThe UN has led international calls for clarity and the rights of people in Assam to be protected. Filippo Grandi, the UN high commissioner for refugees, said in a statement this month that India had a duty to ensure that no one ends up stateless as a result of being excluded from the NRC, \u201cincluding by ensuring adequate access to information, legal aid, and legal recourse in accordance with the highest standards of due process\u201d.\n\n\u201cAny process that could leave large numbers of people without a nationality would be an enormous blow to global efforts to eradicate statelessness,\u201d he said.\n\nBizarrely, it is not just national and international rights groups who are unhappy with how the process has panned out; even those who have been calling for the updating of the NRC since the 1980s are upset. This is in no small part down to the fact that, as far as the government can tell, of the 1.9 million excluded from the list the split of Hindus and Muslims is roughly equal.\n\nThere are many examples of families where one spouse and some children have been included on the list, while the other half of the immediate nuclear family has been excluded.\n\nAnd there are also some high profile cases of people from notable, historic Assamese families who have yet failed to make the cut. They include Sajid Ali Ahmed, a close relative of India\u2019s fifth president Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed. Ahmed, 25, said he and his family were excluded just because one document relating to his grandfather, the president\u2019s brother, had \u201cthe name spelled wrong\u201d. \u201cWe got entangled in legal formalities and eventually our names did not appear in the citizens list,\u201d he said.\n\nThe leader of the BJP\u2019s state arm in Assam, Ranjit Dass, effectively disowned the exercise, saying that \u201cthe NRC in its current form cannot be regarded as an error-free list of citizens\u201d.\n\nAnd even the All Assam Students Union, which spearheaded the anti-migrant movement of the 1980s and has been the main petitioner for decades in attempts to get the NRC updated, was critical of the outcome. AASU leader Samujjal Bhattacharya said the NRC was \u201cnot error-free. The names of indigenous people have been excluded while many foreigners have been included,\u201d he said, adding that his group would appeal to the Supreme Court until \u201cAssam [is] illegal migrant free\u201d.\n\nYet despite all these issues, there are worrying signs that BJP leaders in other states are keen for their own \u201cAssam-like\u201d citizens\u2019 lists. Yogi Adityanath, the firebrand former Hindu cleric who is now the BJP chief minister in populous Uttar Pradesh and one of the party\u2019s most recognisable figures, insisted that he saw the implementation of the NRC in Assam as an \u201cimportant and brave decision\u201d.\n\nUttar Pradesh has a long border with Nepal, and Adityanath said Assam \u201ccan be an example for us\u2026 when [we] need an NRC, we will do so\u201d. He said a list would \u201cput a stop on the rights of poor being taken away by illegal immigration\u201d, without specifying what rights those were. And Manohar Lal Khattar, the BJP chief minister of Haryana, said his state would begin work to \u201cimplement NRC along the lines of Assam\u201d. He said a retired high court judge from the state, Justice HS Bhalla, would visit Assam \u201csoon\u201d and bring back recommendations for how to proceed.\n\nGovernment sources said it was not currently the BJP\u2019s policy that the NRC should be rolled out to other states. Officials said that Shah\u2019s repeated pledges to do so were made during the election campaign only, and did not represent the government\u2019s plans. As for what the government does actually plan to do with those excluded from the list in Assam, it remains unclear.\n\nThere is certainly no immediate prospect of anyone being \u201csent back\u201d to Bangladesh. That much was made clear after the issue was brought up during a recent visit to Dhaka by the external affairs minister S Jaishankar, who told his counterpart that Bangladesh need not be concerned and that the NRC was India\u2019s \u201cinternal matter\u201d to deal with.\n\nAssam currently has about 1,000 illegal immigrants, who have been declared as such by Foreigners Tribunals outside of the NRC process, detained in six existing facilities. It is near to completion of a seventh, much larger detention centre capable of housing 3,000 people, images and reports of which contributed to stoking the fears of NRC applicants whose cases were borderline. Local media reports last month quoted unnamed state officials as saying that there are plans to build as many as 10 more such facilities.\n\nEven then, that would be nowhere near the capacity required to house the numbers currently excluded from the NRC. The government\u2019s stance is that, in the short term, those excluded \u201cwill not be deprived of any rights or entitlements which they have enjoyed before\u201d or detained, according to a statement from Raveesh Kumar, the government\u2019s official spokesperson.\n\nYet during at-times heated exchanges in a recent briefing with international media in Delhi, government officials admitted that there was still a chance many people could be detained. \u201cUntil all legal channels are exhausted, nothing will happen to them,\u201d an official said, a process that, including all appeals, could take years.\n\nAfter that, well, \u201cnobody has taken a decision. There are detention camps everywhere in the world,\u201d the official said. \u201cIt is a possibility [that people will be detained]\u2026 everything is possible.\u201d\n\nIn a recent statement, Amnesty International condemned what it called the \u201carbitrariness\u201d of the NRC process, one that placed \u201cimmense pressure [and] emotional and psychological impacts\u201d on millions of people without a clear end goal.\n\nThe international community, it said, had a duty to pressure India and \u201censure justice for those victimised by the arbitrary and discriminatory procedure. Although the lives and years lost can never be reclaimed, it is still not too late to reverse what now seems an inevitable outcome of mass-disenfranchisement,\u201d it added.", "description": "It was supposed to be the ultimate fix to weed out illegal immigrants, administered by a right-wing ruling party that dubbed them \u201ctermites\u201d.
