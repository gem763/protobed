Carabao Cup fifth round.\n\nThe United and England striker bagged the reds\u2019 first goal with a 24th-minute penalty after Marcos Alonso brought down Daniel James.\n\nAnd after Michy Batshuayi had drawn Chelsea level with a fine and deserved equaliser on the hour-mark, Rashford then wrapped his right boot around a sumptuous set-piece that left Willy Caballero no chance.\n\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer\u2019s men have proved a thorn in Blues boss Frank Lampard\u2019s side this season.\n\nThey beat them 4-0 on the opening day of the season, a result which didn\u2019t reflect the closeness of the game.\n\nChelsea had much more possession than the visitors here at Stamford Bridge but Rashford\u2019s seventh and eighth goals of the season saw his side to victory again.\n\n(Image: Action

business when given a chance with a cracking goal.\n\nThe self-styled \u2018Batman\u2019 headed Willy Caballero\u2019s clearance over Harry Maguire on the halfway line, turned and advanced to the edge of the United box with the England defender on his tail.\n\nThere were four other red shirts around him as he travelled but none got close enough to stop him drilling a very good, low finish beyond Sergio Romero.\n\nIt was his eighth goal in 10 games for club and country this season yet he\u2019s behind Tammy Abraham at Chelsea and Romelu Lukaku with Belgium.\n\nThe 26-year-old was told he could leave Stamford Bridge in the summer but loves life in London and fought to stay.\n\nLampard will be pleased he did.\n\n(Image: EMPICS Sport)\n\nGiroud out in the cold\n\nA penny for or Olivier Giroud\u2019s thoughts after the striker failed even to get a start in Frank Lampard\u2019s Carabao Cup team.\n\nThe World Cup-winning Frenchman has found himself behind Tammy Abraham in the Premier League this season and will have viewed this clash with United as an ideal opportunity to get minutes into his legs.\n\nBoss Frank Lampard has made it clear to Giroud that he wants him to stay at the club but the striker has started just one game this season and, at 33, he knows he can\u2019t afford to spend too much time on the bench.\n\nA move away from the club in January looks increasingly likely.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nWilliams ready to rough it\n\nBrandon Williams, Manchester United\u2019s 19-year-old left-back, looks cherubic but a clash with Chelsea\u2019s Callum Hudson-Odoi early in the second half suggested he might just be another baby-faced assassin.\n\nThe pair were tussling for the ball close to the touchline and the United kid, annoyed by Hudson-Odoi\u2019s grappling, grabbed his opponent and rolled him into the advertising board.\n\nSolskjaer will like the fact Williams will refuse to be bullied in senior football and, while Hudson-Odoi caught him out a couple of times, there were a couple of excellent blocks and tackles from the defender.\n\nThis game, his fifth appearance of the season, will have been another good step in his education.\n\n(Image: Getty

international was a target for the Chelsea boo-boys last season because he was seen as Maurizio Sarri\u2019s pet and the fans had had enough of the manager.\n\nBut he has rejuvenated his relationship thanks to his performances under Frank Lampard this season and is one of the most important players in the Chelsea squad.\n\nThe circumstances of Xhaka\u2019s fallout with Arsenal supporters are different, of course, and he\u2019s not as talented as Jorginho.\n\nBut if he can get his head down and work hard, as Jorginho has done, then long term there may be a future for the Swiss at the Emirates \u2026 if he still wants it.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nZouma steps up\n\nKurt Zouma bore the brunt of the blame after Manchester United\u2019s 4-0 victory over Chelsea on the opening day of the season.\n\nSo he will have been much happier with the way things went at Stamford Bridge.\n\nThe Frenchman has found his performances, like so many of his team-mates, regularly overshadowed by his younger team-mates.\n\nBut he has been impressive overall since returning to the Bridge and has been a big help in Fikayo Tomori\u2019s settling into the Chelsea defence.\n\nAgainst United, Zouma had another academy product, Marc Guehi alongside him, and he was a big help to the youngster all evening.", "description": "Rashford scored once in each half to send Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side into the
