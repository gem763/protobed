He added that regulators likely saw Libra as a Facebook project.\n\nThe comments come after a particularly tough week for Facebook\u2019s Libra Association, the nonprofit behind the project. On Friday, PayPal, one of its major backers, pulled out of participation altogether, citing worries that its own reputation would suffer.\n\n\u201cWe remain supportive of Libra\u2019s aspirations and look forward to continued dialogue on ways to work together in the future,\u201d a representative of the firm told Cointelegraph.", "description": "Brad Garlinghouse, the CEO of blockchain payments network Ripple, thinks that Facebook will fail to launch its Libra digital currency before 2023", "authors": ["William Suberg"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvZWIzNzQyOWFmYTc2MzRmYjAxMTc2ZjI1MWNkODJmMTIuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
