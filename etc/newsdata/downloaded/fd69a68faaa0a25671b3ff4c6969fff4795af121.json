A celebrated Spanish filmmaker, Salvador has lost his bearings. He\u2019s gravely depressed, and his body seems to have permanently surrendered to his maladies, to his bad back, migraines, asthma and fits of terrifying, mysterious choking. When a friend offers him some heroin to smoke, Salvador readily lights up and disappears. His nagging pains suddenly give way to images from his childhood, idylls that brighten the screen like beacons in a fog.\n\nA story of memory and creation, youth and its loss, \u201cPain and Glory\u201d circles around the idea of art as self-creation. The precipitating event \u2014 the thing that nudges Salvador and the movie forward \u2014 is the screening of an early triumph, a 1980s film called \u201cSabor.\u201d (Its poster is suitably Almod\u00f3varian: a strawberry-like tongue licking its luscious red lips.) Uneasy about the screening, Salvador reaches out to one of its actors , Alberto ( Asier Etxeandia ), a debauched looker with dangerous habits and a thing for skulls. The men haven\u2019t spoken for years, but slip into a thorny intimacy that\u2019s almost domestic, pushing and pulling at each other while picking at old scabs.\n\nThe screening turns into a mild farce, but it stirs something in Salvador, lighting a small fire. The grinning face of death hangs over \u201cPain and Glory,\u201d but it soon emerges that Salvador\u2019s most debilitating issue is that he is a man without desire. He\u2019s alone and hasn\u2019t made movie in a while, and a new one doesn\u2019t seem on the horizon. Yet even as he idles, his will to create \u2014 to dream, share stories, make drama \u2014 remains intact. He may not be shooting a film, but it\u2019s telling how much his life seems like a melodrama or a comedy or even, as in a gritty scene with slashing knives and blood, a thriller.", "description": "Antonio Banderas plays a filmmaker in crisis in Pedro Almod\u00f3var\u2019s movie about loss, love, imagination and memory.", "authors": ["Manohla Dargis"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/02/arts/00painandglory-1/00painandglory-1-facebookJumbo.jpg"}
