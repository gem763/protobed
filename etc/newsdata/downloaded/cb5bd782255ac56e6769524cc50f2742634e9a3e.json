Since its launch in 1984, Sir Richard Branson\u2019s aviation project has worked wonders to improve service and value for passengers.\n\nInitially Virgin was kept out of Heathrow airport, but since the government relented and let it compete head to head with BA \u2013 and many other airlines \u2013 the traveller has been the winner. Grant us more slots at Heathrow, goes the argument, and we could compete more effectively against BA.\n\nBut this campaign is misconceived.\n\nThe very term \u201cflag carrier\u201d is comically 20th century: an airline accorded special status because it represents the nation. Aer Lingus, Iberia, Lufthansa \u2026 you can instantly decode them as Irish, Spanish and German. But Aer Lingus is dwarfed by mighty Ryanair as Ireland\u2019s aviation ambassador, and is merely a partner (along with Iberia and British Airways) in the pan-European IAG consortium.\n\nLufthansa remains mighty, but part of its strength is that it owns other flag carriers, including Austrian and Swiss. Like Air France and KLM (uncomfortably part of the same multinational) it must compete against highly successful nation-neutral short-haul carriers, such as easyJet and Wizz Air. But at least, I imagine they think each day at the airlines\u2019 HQs in Frankfurt and Paris, we don\u2019t have to jostle with someone like Virgin Atlantic.\n\nThe prime performer of the Virgin brand has been a constant thorn in the side of British Airways, and (from the passenger\u2019s point of view), long may that rivalry continue. If and when a third runway is finally built at Heathrow, and hundreds more daily slots become available, BA\u2019s majority holding of operations will turn into a minority share.\n\nBut Virgin Atlantic will not be the main beneficiary \u2013 indeed, while it will probably get a dozen or two more slots, its already meagre proportion of only four per cent is likely to dwindle relative to a much-expanded total.\n\nThat is because of all the new slots, incumbents will probably have to share between them only half. The remainder will be distributed to newcomers such as easyJet and possibly even Ryanair.\n\nBritish Airways\u2019 parent, IAG, was robust in its rejection of Virgin Atlantic\u2019s case. When slots came on to the market, BA bought plenty, but Virgin did not.\n\nA spokesperson for British Airways was scathing: \u201cVirgin Atlantic\u2019s lack of Heathrow routes is down to its own corporate strategy.\n\n\u201cVirgin had the opportunity to increase its slot share at Heathrow to 19.7 per cent by buying slots but it chose not to do so.\u201d\n\nOne reason Virgin Atlantic was not a buyer: the cost would have run into billions of pounds. A cynical passenger might conclude that the airline\u2019s campaign is merely some softening up ahead of expansion at Heathrow: give us some of the most precious assets in aviation, and we\u2019ll deliver for the traveller.\n\nNot an unreasonable argument for a carrier, but it has nothing to do with flags. Virgin Atlantic is a formidable challenger. Let\u2019s keep it that way.", "description": "How many \u201cflag carriers\u201d does the UK need?
