Biden\u2019s red eyes and shaky memory have become major media stories in recent days, complicating the 76-year-old Democrat\u2019s insistence that he is up for running the White House.\n\nCoverage of Mr. Biden\u2019s tired expressions and weak campaign schedule earlier this year raised questions, but his fitness for the job has become more worrying.\n\nThe Washington Post reported that Mr. Biden bungled details of a dramatic story about issuing a war medal to a Navy captain who was reluctant to take it, insisting he didn\u2019t deserve an award because men died in the operation. Mr. Biden mangled details such as the branch of service, people involved and the timing of the events, The Post said.\n\nThen on Wednesday, at a CNN forum on climate change, close-ups appeared to show blood pooling in Mr. Biden\u2019s eye. Photos quickly went viral.\n\nThose compounded questions from early last month, when Mr. Biden said he was vice president during the Florida school massacre last year. In fact, he had left office more than a year earlier.\n\n\u201cAnytime you have a 76-year-old running for president, particularly one that suffered two brain aneurysms, even though they were 33 years ago, [he] will get an additional level of scrutiny and discussion, as Biden has and is,\u201d said Charlie Cook of the Cook Political Report.\n\nMr. Biden\u2019s red eye was assumed to be a subconjunctival hemorrhage, which, according to the Mayo Clinic, \u201coccurs when a tiny blood vessel breaks just underneath the clear surface of your eye\u201d and is usually harmless.\n\nBut candidates know that any health problem can become a political problem, particularly when there\u2019s a pattern.\n\nFor Mr. Biden, it\u2019s questions about his physical health and his mental acuity. Mr. Cook said he doesn\u2019t see Mr. Biden\u2019s issues as a problem \u2014 yet.\n\n\u201cIf it stays at the current level, it won\u2019t be a problem for him, but anything much more could become a real challenge,\u201d he said.\n\nOther analysts, though, said the incidents are taking a toll.\n\n\u201cJoe Biden\u2019s verbal miscues have gone from being benign to possibly electorally disqualifying for a presidential nominee,\u201d said Richard E. Vatz, a professor of political rhetoric at Towson University.\n\n\u201cHis recent serial misstatements, such as his getting locations incorrect of shootings as well as his own speaking locations added to his conflating a number of largely false stories regarding his pinning medals on soldiers and then defending his mistakes with \u2018details are irrelevant\u2019 are leading him down a spiral to a likely impossibility to win the Democratic nomination, much less a national election,\u201d Mr. Vatz said.\n\nFar from retreating, Mr. Biden leaned into the questions. He said angrily that it didn\u2019t matter that he botched some details of the story about troops\u2019 medals. His bigger point, he said, was the heroism of the troops.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what the problem is. I mean, what is it that I said wrong?\u201d he told Jonathan Capehart in a podcast.\n\nBut the political danger is not lost on him, and he has turned to humor to try to defuse it.\n\n\u201cAre you going nuts?\u201d Stephen Colbert asked Mr. Biden during an appearance on \u201cThe Late Show\u201d this week.\n\nMr. Biden answered, \u201cThe reason I came on the Jimmy Kimmel show is I am not.\u201d\n\nDespite his stumbles, Mr. Biden sits atop national polls and is leading the field in Iowa and New Hampshire, the first two stops on the nomination calendar.\n\nJoAnn Hardy, chair of the Cerro Gordo County Democrats, said the media talk more about Mr. Biden\u2019s gaffes than voters do, but she added that the candidate\u2019s support could be stronger in the state and his overall energy level could be higher.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t seem to be as steady in that sometimes he is up and sometimes he is down,\u201d she said. \u201cAt the same time, you know, there is something about Joe. He has been around, and he knows how things need to work to be successful, and there is something grandfatherly-like about him \u2014 that he will come and comfort us and fix things.\u201d\n\nMiriam Kenning, a longtime Iowa activist, said she thinks the fixation on Mr. Biden\u2019s miscues is driven by ageism. Still, she said, the missteps and mistakes have shaken her confidence in her preferred candidate.\n\n\u201cThere is shake, a shiver, but when I analyze what I want from a leader for four years, he has that ability to move me,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe it is a yearning for what was.\u201d\n\nRonna McDaniel, chair of the Republican National Committee, said Mr. Biden can\u2019t hide from his missteps.\n\n\u201cHe has forgotten which state he is in, he forgot which president he worked for, he\u2019s made up stories,\u201d she said Thursday on Fox News. \u201cIt\u2019s time after time after time. These gaffes are adding up. It raises questions about is he ready for this presidency?\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
