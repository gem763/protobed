U.S. health officials on Friday urged people to stop vaping until they figure out the cause of severe breathing illnesses.\n\nOfficials have identified about 450 possible cases, including as many as five deaths, in 33 states. The count includes newly reported deaths in California, Indiana and Minnesota.\n\nUS HEALTH OFFICIALS REPORT NEW VAPING DEATHS, REPEAT WARNING\n\n\u201cHere's why everyone is panicked about this: these five deaths are problematic because people came [to a doctor] in time, they should have been able to be saved,\u201d he explained.\n\nDr. Oz said it's \"not true\" to blame the illnesses solely on marijuana-based vaping products, adding that the lung damage seen in the patients \"doesn't happen overnight.\"\n\n\u201cIt's called a lipoid pneumonia. The fat, something in the material that you\u2019re inhaling, it could be the vitamin E acetate, not normally toxic, in some of these cases. But something's happening that\u2019s making this material, like grease, coat the inside of your lungs,\" Dr. Oz said, adding that many vaping products contain unknown ingredients from other countries.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHealth officials have only been counting certain lung illnesses in which the person had vaped within three months. Doctors say the illnesses resemble an inhalation injury, with the body apparently reacting to a caustic substance that someone breathed in. Symptoms have included shortness of breath, fatigue, chest pain and vomiting.\n\nAssociated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "The five deaths linked to vaping are leaving medical professionals looking for answers, including Dr. Mehmet Oz.", "authors": ["Joshua Nelson", "Joshua Nelson Is A Freelance Reporter For Fox News."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/Screen-Shot-2019-09-09-at-9.02.35-AM.png", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
