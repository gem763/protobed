Anthony Russo finished 25 of 51 for 258 yards and three touchdowns, but he also three interceptions and had one returned for a score.\n\n\u201cI told them it won\u2019t happen again, and I told them I won\u2019t let them down like I did on Saturday and want to do everything in my power to make sure I won\u2019t let them down like I did,\u201d Russo said after Tuesday\u2019s practice.\n\nThe Owls (2-1) boast the nation\u2019s No. 9 passing offense, averaging 347 yards per game. Georgia Tech (1-2) only allows 140 per game, though the Yellow Jackets have seen a heavy dose of the run because their run defense is next-to-last among FBS schools (274.3 ypg allowed).\n\nCollins spent the past two seasons at Temple and he will see plenty of players he knows well across the sideline. He is more interested in continuing the transition at Georgia Tech, where he is running a pro-style offense at a school that had spent 11 years running the triple-option.\n\nGeorgia Tech was blown out by No. 1 Clemson in the opener, managed to beat South Florida and then lost at home to The Citadel, an FCS school.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t panic,\u201d Collins said Tuesday. \u201cWe know we\u2019re going to get better.\u201d\n\nTemple was the first head coaching job for the 48-year-old Collins, who left for a job at what is essentially his hometown school.\n\nFAMILIAR FACES\n\nFive assistant coaches at Georgia Tech were with Collins at Temple. Russo also said he has talked with Temple defensive players about what Collins and former defensive coordinator Andrew Thacker like to do.\n\nFIRST TIME\n\nGeorgia Tech is in its 127th season and Temple is in its 121st but it is the first meeting between the two schools in football.\n\nKEY PASS CATCHERS\n\nTemple\u2019s Branden Mack finished the Buffalo game with four catches for 72 yards and the two touchdowns while fellow WR Jadan Blue led all receivers with eight catches for 87 yards. \u2026 Georgia Tech wide receiver Jalen Camp had a breakout performance against The Citadel with three receptions for 71 yards and a touchdown, all career highs.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Temple heads into Saturday's game against Georgia Tech and former coach Geoff Collins looking for a much faster start.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/14/the_citadel_georgia_tech_football_73154_c0-958-2089-2175_s1770x1032.jpg?3409b5405bb02250b68f121596d54cdc0f6c72d2", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
