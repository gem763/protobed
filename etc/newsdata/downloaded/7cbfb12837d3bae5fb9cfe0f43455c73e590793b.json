It would have been a massive boost for Owen Farrell, too \u2014 having busted a gut for an hour \u2014 to have a fresh mind like Ford coming on to pick everything up with a feel for where the spaces are.\n\nThat is the difficult thing about Ford, though. He is so good at killing off a game like that, it gives Jones a good reason to have him on the bench, especially when Owen Farrell, Manu Tuilagi and Henry Slade gave England such balance against Australia\u2019s physical midfield.\n\nGeorge Ford was outstanding in helping manoeuvre England into a World Cup semi-final\n\nSlade has an X-factor going forward with his running threat, speed and aggression. I actually thought he started the game poorly but showed real class with his interception and chip for Jonny May\u2019s try and that bedded him in. He was superb after that.\n\nI think Jones will go with the same three against New Zealand. The only reason he might want to switch back to Ford and Farrell is if he wants to isolate Beauden Barrett, who is not a natural 15.\n\nPin back the All Blacks and make sure you kick better than Jonny Sexton did for Ireland.\n\nThe problem with that, though, is New Zealand are so good at covering the play. Isolate one player and they have other guys who can pick the ball up and by kicking for the corners you also lose the attacking threat.\n\nFord is so good at killing off games that it gives Jones a good reason to have him on the bench\n\nHenry Slade made some early mistakes but looked more confident after his interception\n\nIf you go with Ford and Farrell you also lose physicality in midfield, which will be crucial against New Zealand.\n\nAll Blacks have Anton Lienert-Brown, who is not the biggest guy but has great feet and a superb off-loading game. Sonny Bill Williams is one of the best off-loaders in the game. Jack Goodhue is a throwback to the 80s with that mullet, but is big and abrasive. He\u2019s an under-rated player, a bit like Conrad Smith was for them over the past decade.\n\nEngland have to match that power. They can\u2019t afford to get overrun in midfield. They need their pack in the game \u2014 not constantly going backwards.\n\nSticking with Farrell, Tuilagi and Slade is the best way to go and it gives Jones options off the bench.\n\nNew Zealand are beatable but England will have to play at 95 per cent of their game or more. Manage their frustrations, keep it tight and, crucially, stay in the game. Then they have a real chance.", "description": "TOBY FLOOD: Eddie Jones talked about players making an impact off the bench and George Ford was outstanding when he came on to see out the game.", "authors": ["Toflood For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/22/19937536-0-image-a-155_1571519745105.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
