Rather, the question is whether Sheriff Long\u2019s plan runs afoul of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution. It does,\u201d the ruling reads.\n\nThe Obama-appointed district court judge noted that Georgia law only requires sex offenders\u2019 names, addresses and pictures to be listed in an online directory and \u201cdoes not require or authorize sheriffs to post signs in front of sex offenders\u2019 homes.\u201d\n\nJudge Treadwell only granted a preliminary injunction for the three plaintiffs but did not expand that ruling to the county\u2019s other sex offenders the men said they were suing on behalf of, according to CNN.\n\nRegardless, Judge Treadwell cautioned Mr. Long about continuing these kinds of actions.\n\n\u201c[Mr. Long] should be aware that the authority for [his] blanket sign posting is dubious at best and even more dubious if posted over the objection of registrants,\u201d he said.\n\nThe three plaintiffs \u2014 Christopher Reed, Reginald Holden and Corey McClendon \u2014 filed their lawsuit last month claiming that Butts County law enforcement officials trespassed to place signs in their yards that read: \u201cWarning! No Trick-or-Treat at this address.\u201d\n\nThe signs \u2014 originally placed in 2018 and were going to be placed again this year \u2014 were labeled as being a \u201ccommunity safety message from\u201d Mr. Long, and the sex offenders were told only police officers could remove it, with one plaintiff claiming he was told he would be arrested if he discarded it.\n\nThe three plaintiffs said the police had no \u201clegal authority\u201d to place the signs and caused them humiliation, claiming in court documents they \u201cpaid their debts to society\u201d and now live \u201cproductive, law-abiding lives.\u201d\n\nMr. Long wrote in a statement posted on the Sheriff\u2019s office\u2019s Facebook page he \u201crespectfully and strongly\u201d disagreed with the ruling, saying extra enforcements would be dispatched to \u201cneighborhoods where we know sex offenders are likely to be.\u201d\n\nDeputies will have candy in their patrol vehicles and will interact with the children until the neighborhood is clear of trick-or-treaters to ensure the safety of our children on Halloween night,\u201d he wrote.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
