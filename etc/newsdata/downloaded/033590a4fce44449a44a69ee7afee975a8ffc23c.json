For the whole UK.\n\n\"But the EU has been encouraged by our weak and incompetent Parliament to think Northern Ireland is the price. That's wrong. Boris is right to defend our Union.\"\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nThe PM unveiled his \"reasonable compromise\" last week to rewrite the Brexit deal to ditch Theresa May's Irish backstop - instead having a system of two borders in the region.\n\nBut he refuses to publish the full legal text and the EU have refused to enter into detailed talks.\n\nToday private briefings emerged from sources in both No10 and the EU warning a deal is set to collapse - and blaming the other side.\n\nBoris Johnson held an 8am phone call with Germany's Chancellor that a Downing Street source called a \"clarifying moment\". The No10 source said: \"The call with Merkel showed the EU has adopted a new position.\n\n\"She made clear a deal is overwhelmingly unlikely and she thinks the EU has a veto on us leaving the customs union.\n\n\"Merkel said that the PM should tell Northern Ireland that it must stay in full alignment forever, but that even this would not eliminate customs issues.\"\n\nThe briefing prompted a furious response from DUP leader Arlene Foster and the Tories' Northern Ireland Secretary.\n\nMs Foster said Merkel's supposed plans would be \"beyond crazy\" adding: \"No UK Government could ever concede such a surrender.\"\n\nNorthern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith tweeted: \"I am clear that any threat on withdrawing security cooperation with Ireland is unacceptable. This is not in the interest of NI or the Union.''\n\n(Image: Dan Kitwood)\n\nMeanwhile, a scathing verdict on progress over Brexit was leaked to the right-wing Spectator website by an anonymous \"contact\" inside 10 Downing Street.\n\nThe briefing - widely blamed on top aide Dominic Cummings - says \"if this deal dies in the next few days, then it won\u2019t be revived\" and any sincere co-operation \"will be in the toilet\".\n\nAnd it claims EU countries that back a delay to Brexit will be punished by being sent to the \"bottom of the queue\" for a future trade deal.\n\nThe briefing says: \"We will make clear privately and publicly that countries which oppose delay will go the front of the queue for future cooperation.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\"Those who support delay will go to the bottom of the queue\".\n\nThe BBC revealed specific objections to the plan within the EU. Brussels chiefs were said to be \"nonplussed\" at a line in the legal text that asks them to rule out checks on the Irish border.\n\nBoris Johnson's own deal does not guarantee a lack of checks. Instead the Stormont Assembly would be given a veto over future trading rules with the Republic.\n\nThe BBC claimed EU chiefs were so shocked by the proposal that they asked if it was a mistake.\n\nShadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer said: \u201cThis is yet another cynical attempt by Number 10 to sabotage the negotiations.\n\n\u201cBoris Johnson will never take responsibility for his own failure to put forward a credible deal. His strategy from day one has been for a No Deal Brexit.\n\n\u201cIt is now more important than ever that Parliament unites to prevent this reckless Government crashing us out of the EU at the end of the month.\u201d", "description": "The European Council President launched a scathing attack as No10 tried to pin the blame for a Brexit deal breakdown on Brussels", "authors": ["Dan Bloom", "Image", "Getty Images", "Pa", "Dan Kitwood"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article19004953.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Heads-Of-Government-Attend-G7-Summit.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
