But the koala genome is defending itself, revealing that DNA has its own immune system to shut down invaders.\n\nThe virus, called koala retrovirus (KoRV), is linked to weakened immunity, cancer, and chlamydia infection in koalas. All retroviruses hijack the DNA in some cells of their host\u2019s body, but not all of them manage to be transmitted to the host\u2019s offspring.\n\nYour DNA is eight per cent virus\n\nOver the millions of years of evolutionary history, retroviruses have at one time or another made their way into the genomes of all species of vertebrates that we have studied.\n\nWe know about these ancient infections because retroviruses sometimes infect the animal\u2019s sperm or egg cells, which means the virus incorporates its own DNA sequences into the genome that is passed from generation to generation.\n\nThese viral sequences can contribute to disease, but have also been \u201cco-opted\u201d by the host animals for processes that are essential to normal development. As much as 8 per cent of the human genome is made up of the remnants of infectious viruses.\n\nWhile we know that retroviruses have frequently appeared during evolutionary history, we don\u2019t know much about how retroviral sequences infiltrate sperm and egg cells, or how these cells react.\n\nCatching a retrovirus in the act\n\nAlmost all known retrovirus genome invasions happened millions of years ago. However, KoRV is a recently identified exception. The virus spreads between individuals, but is also infecting sperm and egg cells, so many koalas are born with this pathogen as part of their genome.\n\nMy colleagues and I at the University of Queensland are collaborating with scientists from the University of Massachusetts Medical School to analyse how koala sperm and egg cells respond to KoRV-A infection.\n\nOur findings, published today in Cell, suggest these cells mount a novel \u201cinnate genome immune response\u201d to viral infection, which may help control the spread of infectious KoRV.\n\nWithin this project, the team analysed DNA and RNA from different tissue samples from deceased wild koalas from South East Queensland. (Like DNA, RNA also contains genetic information about the koalas \u2013 but it is also what KoRV\u2019s own genome is made of.)\n\nThe team specifically looked for short sequences of RNA, between 23 and 35 nucleotides long, known as PIWI Interacting RNAs (piRNAs). Clusters of piRNA sequences are retained within the genome and serve as a kind of memory bank of undesirable sequences \u2013 signatures of invading viruses \u2013 to be targeted.\n\nAn immune system for the genome\n\nBased on our new findings, we suggest that there is a specialised immune system to defend against retroviral genome invasion. Like the ordinary immune system, this one includes an innate response \u2013 a sort of general-purpose defence against attackers \u2013 and an adaptive response, which learns to recognise specific pathogens and take them down.\n\nAt the early stages of egg or sperm infection, the altered DNA sequence results in a \u201cmolecular pattern\u201d that is recognised by an innate genome immune system, which stops the activity of the virus and starts producing signature piRNA sequences to recognise the invader.\n\nThe innate immune response works until a memory of the genome invader is created and a sequence-specific adaptive response kicks in.\n\nWe propose a framework through which a sequence from an invading retrovirus can first have its genes \u201csilenced\u201d, and then through targeted processes it eventually becomes an integral part of the host genome.\n\nThis \u201cgenome immune system\u201d changes our understanding of what shapes the genomes of all animals. No more can we view the genome as a defenceless entity governed purely by natural selection \u2013 it fights back.\n\nKeith Chappell is a Senior Research Fellow at the School of Chemistry and Molecular Biosciences, The University of Queensland\n\n.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.
