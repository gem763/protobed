Analysts' forecasts for the weekly report had ranged from 800,000 tonnes to 1.6 million tonnes.\n\nA Bloomberg report said China was willing to buy $20 billion of U.S. farm goods in the first year of a trade deal.\n\nBeijing on Tuesday offered major Chinese and international soybean processors waivers that would exempt the companies from steep tariffs on imports of up to 10 million tonnes of U.S. soybeans, according to two people briefed on the matter.\n\nUSDA has confirmed sales of about 6 million tonnes of soybeans to China since the marketing year began on Sept. 1. That compares with cancellations of 431,000 tonnes in the comparable period of 2018 and about 8.4 million tonnes in the comparable period of 2017, before the trade war began.\n\nTraders are also closely watching U.S. pork sales to China, where a fatal pig disease had decimated the world's largest hog herd, raising the need for meat imports.\n\nChina's total purchases of U.S. pork last week were 2,002 tonnes, the smallest in five weeks, according to USDA data. That was down from record-large weekly purchases of 152,599 tonnes reported in the week ended Oct. 10, although USDA said sales from previous weeks may have been included.\n\nBeijing imposed hefty tariffs on imports of U.S. pork as part of the trade war.\n\nIn Brazil, Agriculture Minister Tereza Cristina Dias said in a video on Twitter that her country is confident Chinese authorities will authorize more Brazilian meat exporters before Chinese President Xi Jinping visits Brazil next month.\n\nAt 10:45 a.m. CDT (1545 GMT), Chicago Board of Trade November soybean futures were up 2 cents at $9.35-3/4 a bushel.
