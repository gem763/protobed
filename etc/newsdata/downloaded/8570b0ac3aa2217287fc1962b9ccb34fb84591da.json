Today, there are easier ways to access credit that consumers often prefer.\n\nRead more on Business Insider.\n\nThe housing market recovery over the last decade hasn't been matched by homeowners taking out home equity lines of credit, or Helocs, which are loans that use property as collateral.\n\nThe change is hurting banks, which once counted on homeowners taking the loans as a solid source of revenue, Bloomberg reported Monday. At Bank of America, Helocs produced $552 million of interest income in the third quarter, down almost 70% from a decade ago, the report said.\n\nA main reason is that American homeowners have grown wary of the products following the financial crisis.\n\nThe years leading up to the crisis saw doubled volumes of Helocs, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Because property prices were so high at the same time, homeowners could borrow significantly against their homes to boost consumer spending \u2014 some used loans for renovations, college payments, and more, according to the report.\n\nBut, when the housing bubble burst, that left those who had taken out the so-called \"piggy bank\" mortgages unable to repay debts when the prices of the houses they'd borrowed against fell.\n\nRead more: UBS studied 50 years of history to pinpoint the single biggest risk to stocks \u2014 and its conclusion spells imminent trouble for the market\n\nNow, many homeowners are foregoing the products. In the last decade, the number of Helocs has fallen by almost half, according to data from the New York Fed. That means in 2016, only 4% of households in the US had an open home equity line, down from 10% during the 2000s.\n\nIn addition, low mortgage rates today and easy access to different types of personal loans have made Helocs less appealing. Currently, the typical interest rate on a 30-year mortgage is lower than the rate on a Heloc, which means that borrowers are more likely to go for a cash-out refinancing, Bloomberg reported, citing Rutger van Faassen, a vice president of consumer lending at Informa.\n\nOften borrowers would also rather apply for personal loans, many of which can be done online and approved quickly, than fill out paperwork and wait 45 days for a Heloc, the report said. Consumers can be more comfortable with personal loans too because if they default, they don't risk losing their homes like they would with a Heloc, according to Bankrate.\n\nNow read more markets coverage from Business Insider:\n\nArgentina's central bank cuts dollar purchase limits to stabilize the economy after Sunday's election result\n\nGeorge Soros doesn't think Wall Street will determine the 2020 election\n\nThe market's favorite recession indicator has stopped flashing red.
