REUTERS/Stephane Mahe/File Photo\n\nFRANKFURT (Reuters) - Easyjet (EZJ.L) is looking at some of collapsed travel firm Thomas Cook\u2019s (TCG.D) assets, the airline\u2019s Chief Executive Johan Lundgren told German newspaper Die Welt.\n\n\u201cOf course, like all airlines and tour operators, we will look at what might be of interest to us from the Thomas Cook network. But there is no decision yet,\u201d Lundgren told the paper.\n\nLundgren also told Die Welt that he was not interested in buying rival airline Condor.\n\nSeparately, he said efforts by Germany to curb carbon dioxide emissions through new taxes on the airline industry should penalize those carriers which use old aircraft and carry fewer passengers.\n\n\u201cA fixed tax rate, a flat tax, does not provide any incentive to fly more efficiently,\u201d Lundgren told the paper, explaining that some airlines fly with 70-80% seat occupancy, while Easyjet\u2019s occupancy rate is around 92%.\n\nA tax on kerosene, the main fuel used by the airline industry, could be a way forward, he said, \u201cbecause it promotes the use of efficient aircraft\u201d.", "description": "Easyjet is looking at some of collapsed travel firm Thomas Cook's assets, the airline's Chief Executive Johan Lundgren told German newspaper Die Welt.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191004&t=2&i=1436919066&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF930DE", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
