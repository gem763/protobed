But according to Rory Burns, his close friend, the right-hander remains upbeat regardless.\n\nRoy\u2019s move down into the middle order started brightly enough, opening his account with a caressed four through extra off Josh Hazlewood. But on 22 it was terminated by the same man who, amid an impressive three-wicket burst that cashed in on the pressure built by Pat Cummins after tea, exposed his defence by jagging one between bat and pad.\n\nHazlewood burst rattles England after Root and Burns show path to survival Read more\n\nHaving averaged 9.5 as an opener in the series, and spoken before the Test about being drained from the World Cup, Roy likely has one final chance to demonstrate his game can transfer to the longest format; his Surrey teammate, Ollie Pope, is next in line having already been on standby as a concussion replacement.\n\nBurns, who has risen through the county ranks with Roy, said: \u201cHe\u2019s all right. He\u2019s still the same old Jason, which you like to see. He hasn\u2019t changed in terms of how he is off the park and that\u2019s a good thing. He got a start and would have liked a few more but it is something to build on.\u201d\n\nIn contrast to Roy, Burns is enjoying a breakthrough summer and though disappointed to fall for 81, the left-hander now boasts 323 runs for the series \u2013 some 99 runs more than the rest of the openers on both sides combined.\n\nOn the match situation, which sees England resuming on 200 for five and still 98 away from avoiding the follow-on, Burns said: \u201cWe\u2019re in a fight and it\u2019s very obvious what we need to do. A couple of good partnerships and then we are up close to them, and we\u2019re asking them to make a play. We have got to look at from a positive aspect. The way Headingley went, anything is possible.\u201d\n\nAs Jofra Archer spent the day reflecting on his first wicketless outing in Test cricket, England\u2019s bowling coach, Chris Silverwood, moved to warn the wider public that expectations for the young quick must remain tempered.\n\nThe Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.\n\nAlready a World Cup winner in his first summer of international cricket, Archer burst on to the Test scene at Lord\u2019s with the high-octane spell that felled Steve Smith and then claimed six for 45 in the first innings at Headingley through a skilful harnessing of seaming conditions.\n\nBut after the 24-year-old shipped none for 97 from 27 overs in Australia\u2019s first innings at Old Trafford, looking down on pace and failing to disrupt Smith en route to his third double century against England, Silverwood was quick to urge patience.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re just going to be careful with Jofra,\u201d Silverwood saidtold Sky Sports. \u201cHe\u2019s playing his third Test match, so we\u2019ve got to cut him a little bit of slack. He\u2019s still finding his way into international cricket. He\u2019s figuring out what it\u2019s all about.\n\n\u201cTest cricket is hard work. You must put the workload in, but it\u2019s there, and he\u2019s trying and we\u2019ve seen what he\u2019s capable of. But he\u2019s not going to do it every day.\u201d\n\nAshes 2019: England v Australia fourth Test, day three \u2013 as it happened Read more\n\nArcher may well earn an extended breather after this series, with England now pondering resting their leading multiformat players during the five-match Twenty20 series in New Zealand this November before returning to near-full strength for the two Tests that follow.\n\nTwo players who may well benefit from this and receive their first England call-ups in short-form cricket are the Somerset opener Tom Banton and Saqib Mahmood, the Lancashire quick, who are known to be in the thoughts of the selectors as they look to blood the next generation.\n\nJimmy Anderson may well be held back from the Tests in New Zealand. After failing to recover from the calf injury that struck in the first Ashes Test, there are thoughts of sending the 37-year-old to South Africa in early December as part of a bowling camp with a view to readying him for the four-Test series against the Proteas that begins on Boxing Day.", "description": "Rory Burns said his England teammate Jason Roy was still upbeat despite another cheap dismissal in the fourth Ashes Test against Australia", "authors": ["Ali Martin"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e1199deed9b65cf4cf0f8fe69c9252fbaad638d3/0_36_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1a1db48822d3b88cdf8c39f60e63d7fc", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
