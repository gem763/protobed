He bypassed the then-richest person, Bill Gates, when his net worth peaked to $80 billion as Zara's parent company Inditex's stock peaked.\n\nBut when the stock went back down, Ortega went back to being the world's second-richest man, a title he gained in June 2015.\n\nDespite Ortega's net worth, many people have never heard of him. The 82-year-old Spaniard fiercely guards his privacy and gives few interviews to the press.\n\nOrtega founded fast-fashion giant Zara with his then-wife Rosalia in 1975. Today, his retail company Inditex SA \u2014 which owns eight brands including Zara, Massimo Dutti, and Pull&Bear \u2014 has more than 7,500 stores around the world.\n\nOrtega is surpassed in wealth by only five people: Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, Bernard Arnault, Warren Buffett and Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nAshley Lutz and Mallory Schlossberg contributed to an earlier version of this story.", "description": "Amancio Ortega founded fast-fashion giant Zara with his ex-wife Rosalia.
