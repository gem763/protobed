Read on ... if you dare", "language": "en", "text": "I\u2019ll be blunt. I hate haunted houses and the gory side of Halloween.\n\nWhy? There are many reasons, really, but here is one.\n\nIn a day and age of alarming wickedness \u2013 from global terrorism to psychotic people who kill for the thrill of it \u2013 is it really wise to deliberately and voluntarily induce horror into our minds and our neighborhoods?\n\nCAROL ROTH: CANCELING HALLOWEEN IS NOT A SOLUTION \u2013 IT ONLY MAKES KIDS EQUALLY MISERABLE\n\nGo ahead, call me prudish or puritanical. Or boring. Or worse.\n\nThe owners of McKamey Manor in Summertown, Tenn., obviously disagree. Billed as the world\u2019s scariest horror house, visitors are required to take a physical, watch a two-hour video and sign a 40-page waiver before entering the place.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nIn fact, the experience is purportedly so intense that its owners promise anyone who completes the \u201ctour\u201d a $20,000 prize As of this past week, nobody had claimed the cash.\n\nThen there\u2019s a cob-web covered house a few miles from where we live in Colorado Springs with mannequins hanging from the porch rafters. But wait \u2013 there\u2019s more. A beat-up old car is parked in the driveway, a blood-splattered mannequin hanging out its window. The last piece of the gory display is a knocked over baby carriage, made to look like it was hit by the car, complete with a dead, bloodied \u201cchild\u201d slumped on its side.\n\nAnd they call this entertainment? I call it sick.\n\nMy community is hardly alone. I suspect there are similar displays in your town. In recent years, Halloween has become big business. The National Retail Federation reported Americans spent $9 billion last year on costumes, candy and decorations.\n\nI assume the rise in the darker side of Halloween is attributable to a constellation of factors ranging from a rise in secular beliefs to the influence of media and the escalating nature of things.\n\nThe degree of guts and gore notwithstanding, scaring people for entertainment likely dates back to the beginning of recorded history. Riveting tales of suspense are legendary. But like anything else, it\u2019s human nature to escalate, push the envelope, and take things to the extreme.\n\nAccording to most historians, the origin of the haunted house can be traced back to 19th century England. In 1802, the French artist Marie Tussaud created a big stir in London when she sculpted and assembled a collection of \u201cdeath masks\u201d featuring the faces of guillotine victims. It was called the \u201cChamber of Horrors\u201d \u2013 and at the time it generated an enormous cultural buzz.\n\nBelieve it or not, Walt Disney, long considered America\u2019s icon of wholesome family fun, is credited with launching the modern-day haunted house craze. Opening in 1969, Disneyland\u2019s \u201cHaunted Mansion\u201d became a huge it, proving once again that Hollywood shapes culture in more ways than one.\n\nI have Christian friends who object to the holiday altogether, citing its pagan and creepy origins. I respect their convictions and have to admit that from a theological standpoint, I\u2019m on shaky ground recognizing the yearly festival.\n\nNevertheless, I\u2019ve always enjoyed the innocent side of the Halloween or harvest holiday, first as a kid, and now as a parent. When I hear the rustle and crunch of fallen leaves underfoot, I\u2019m transported back to hours upon hours of trick-or-treating on Long Island streets. My costumes included Superman, Batman as well as baseball and football players.\n\nIt was always such great fun to carve pumpkins, bob for apples and roam the neighborhood in the crisp fall air with my brothers and sister, collecting the coveted candy and homemade treats our neighbors so generously dispensed.\n\nI\u2019m looking forward to taking our boys trick-or-treating again this Thursday evening, hopefully adding to their storehouse of happy memories.\n\nBut I assume the rise in the darker side of Halloween is attributable to a constellation of factors ranging from a rise in secular beliefs to the influence of media and the escalating nature of things. Psychologists will tell you that what was once titillating soon proves boring, leading producers to magnify horror productions to get the same thrill or chill.\n\nTo be sure, I know there are a lot of fine people who enjoy a good scare and who feel they can easily separate the fact from the fiction. But the human mind is a tender, fragile, highly sensitive \u2013 and mysterious creation. The fact of the matter is that we become what we think about \u2013 and I\u2019ve just never understood why anybody would want to ponder the ghoulish, inane and profane. As a favorite pastor used to say, \u201cGarbage in, garbage out. What goes down in the well comes up in the bucket.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nI\u2019ve long appreciated the timeless wisdom of the Apostle Paul, who once advised his friends, \u201cWhatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable \u2013 if anything is excellent or praiseworthy \u2013 think about such things.\u201d\n\nIf you ask me, that kind of advice is all treat and no trick.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM PAUL BATURA", "description": "A lot of fine people enjoy a good scare.
