We still expect the Fed to lower rates, but whether that is good for the market remains to be seen. In fact, Barron\u2019s Randall W. Forsyth argues that it might not be good for the economy because ultralow rates hinder growth, not help it.\n\nOf course, that\u2019s still a non-consensus view, and the market would be none too happy if the Fed stood pat. \u201cBottom line for the Fed, if today\u2019s events turn out to be net-hawkish, that will weigh on risk assets as investors remain overly optimistic about an aggressive easing cycle over the coming months and quarters and stocks could potentially selloff hard on a July-like disappointment,\u201d writes The Sevens Report\u2019s Tom Essaye.\n\nPart of the reason for the concern is that the yield curve is till too flat, a sign that the economy is slowing, and even inverted in some spots, an indicator of a possible recession. Ultimately, what the Fed has to say about its future efforts in steepening the curve will have more of an impact than a simple rate cut. \u201c[The] Fed must convince investors that they are committed to steepening the curve through further accommodation. With both growth and inflation near 2%, a simple reiteration of data dependence would likely disappoint investors,\u201d writes Credit Suisse strategist Jonathan Golub.\n\nBut it won\u2019t just be about rates today. With the short-term funding markets seizing up this week\u2014and the Fed being forced to intervene for the first time since the Financial Crisis\u2014investors are almost certainly going to be asking Powell what he can do to avoid a repeat. \u201c[It] is important to note that this week\u2019s repo incident in the US doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that another liquidity crisis is at the door, but it clearly rings the alarm bell for the Fed, which is now urged to fasten up the launch of a new policy tool, an overnight repo facility, to reduce the pressure on short-term rates and to avoid liquidity from drying up for any reason in the future,\u201d writes the London Capital Group\u2019s Ipek Ozkardeskaya.\n\nWrite to Ben Levisohn at Ben.Levisohn@barrons.com", "description": "The Fed\u2019s decision is due at 2pm today, and whether it cuts or not looks less like a sure thing, given the recent rise in oil prices.", "authors": ["Ben Levisohn"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-82686/social"}
