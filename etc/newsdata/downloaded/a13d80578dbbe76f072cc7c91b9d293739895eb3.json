This landmark bill comes as legislators nationwide struggle to keep regulations apace with the fast-growing, and notoriously inaccurate, technology.\n\nSweden's First Data Protection Fine Goes To A High School Piloting Facial Recognition Attendance A school in northern Sweden experimented with facial recognition as a system to document student attendance, and the Swedish Data Protection Authority (DPA) fined the municipality 200,000 SEK (about $30,653) for violating the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). It\u2019s the first time the country has been fined for violating the digital privacy violation, which began enforcement in May of last year.

Though there is one exception: If police release these videos to the public, they can use the software to blur faces for privacy reasons, per Reuters. An earlier draft proposed a seven-year ban but, according to Reuters, this was shortened to three years over \u201cconcerns that the technology might greatly improve.\u201d The legislation secured the state Senate\u2019s support earlier this week and will go into effect in 2020 pending approval from Governor Gavin Newsom.\n\nCritics of this technology argue it stands to seriously threaten Americans\u2019 civil rights and civil liberties if used by police in its current state, particularly among people of colour since it\u2019s demonstrably less accurate with darker skin tones. At this point, facial recognition software often can\u2019t even tell the difference between legislators and suspected criminals.\n\nU.S. law enforcement agencies have also already proven that a new gadget isn\u2019t going to buck their track record of systemic abuse. Several departments have already been caught using facial recognition technology in highly questionable and occasionally outright dumb ways, such as using edited photos, forensic sketches, or celebrity lookalikes to search for suspects.\n\nAll this is precisely why many digital rights organisations, including the 15-million member strong coalition Fight for the Future, joined together earlier this month to petition a nationwide ban, calling the technology \u201cunreliable, biased, and a threat to basic rights and safety.\u201d\n\nCalifornia\u2019s new bill follows similar legislation in Oregon and New Hampshire. Several cities, including San Francisco and Somerville, Massachusetts, as well as the largest manufacturer of police body cameras, Axon, have also followed suit. And Europe may not be too far behind.\n\nWhile it\u2019s too early to tell whether the question of regulating facial recognition technology will reach the federal level any time soon, California\u2019s decision will no doubt earn the issue some serious credence. Hopefully enough to land it on the agenda of national legislators.\n\n[ Via Reuters]", "description": "California became the largest state to ban police from using body cameras with facial recognition software after lawmakers passed a three-year moratorium Thursday, Reuters reported.
