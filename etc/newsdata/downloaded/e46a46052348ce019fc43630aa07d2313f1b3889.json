Anderson Cooper pressed O\u2019Rourke for more details, asking what he planned to do if people simply refused to participate in a mandatory \u201cbuyback\u201d program. (A gentle reminder that you can\u2019t \u201cbuy back\u201d something you didn\u2019t sell in the first place.) Beto insisted that this would work, suggesting there would be \u201cother consequences\u201d for those who don\u2019t comply. (Free Beacon)\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke promised \u201cother consequences\u201d for Americans who choose not to turn in their firearms under his gun confiscation plan. O\u2019Rourke was pressed by CNN debate moderator Anderson Cooper on how he planned to \u201ctake away weapons from people who do not want to give them up.\u201d He hinted at \u201cother consequences\u201d for individuals unwilling to voluntarily turn their weapons in \u201cIf someone does not turn in an AR-15, or an AK-47, one of these weapons of war, or brings it out in public and brandishes it in an attempt to intimidate\u2014as we saw in Kent State recently\u2014then that weapon will be taken from them,\u201d Beto said. \u201cIf they persist, there will be other consequences from law enforcement.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the video in case you missed the show.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to imagine what the \u201cother consequences\u201d are aside from having police or sheriff\u2019s deputies show up at your house and forcibly remove the firearms. And that\u2019s not a job that any of our law enforcement officers are going to be looking forward to. Sure, most law-abiding people are going to wind up complying, but there\u2019s always the chance that you\u2019ll be heading to the home of somebody with a \u201ccome and get \u2019em\u201d attitude and things could turn ugly quickly.\n\nLess drastic options could include threatening to revoke the permits of people not in compliance. But yet again you wind up turning people who haven\u2019t been accused of committing any crime into criminals and treating them as such.\n\nGun confiscation is a losing proposition politically and even a majority of the candidates on the stage aren\u2019t willing to go that far. Even if I were a supporter of a ban on so-called \u201cassault weapons\u201d it\u2019s easy to see the more rational, if slower route to achieving the Democrats\u2019 objectives. If you ban the manufacture and sale of that class of firearms but grandfather all of the ones currently in legal circulation, the majority of them will eventually fall out of circulation through attrition. Yes, it would likely take several generations, but it would happen eventually.\n\nBut that won\u2019t satisfy the rabid gun-grabbers in this political circus, however. They need immediate action. So we\u2019re likely to continue hearing bizarre plans like these all the way through the primary. Next November we\u2019ll find out how the voters feel about it after the Democratic platform gets pushed so far to the left that it\u2019s ready to fall off a cliff.", "description": "Come and get 'em", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/BetoDebate.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
