Democratic Voters Don't Want to Hear It", "language": "en", "text": "Then President Barack Obama during the National Prayer Breakfast at the Washington Hilton hotel in Washington, Feb. 4, 2016. (Drew Angerer/The New York Times)\n\nIn some of the tensest moments of the 2020 debates, a viewer might have concluded that Democrats were poised for a large-scale clash over the legacy of President Barack Obama.\n\nThere have been heated arguments about whether to stick with Obama\u2019s architecture for health care policy or to pursue a single-payer system, and flashes of direct criticism over his record on immigration. In televised debates, Democratic rivals like Juli\u00e1n Castro have pressed his former vice president, Joe Biden, to repudiate the large-scale deportations carried out under Obama\u2019s watch.\n\nThere have also been defiant professions of loyalty, delivered as if Obama were under siege from fellow Democrats. Biden, the Democratic front-runner, has made these moments a hallmark of his candidacy: \u201cI stand with Barack Obama all eight years, good, bad, indifferent,\u201d he said at the last debate.\n\nYet among the vast majority of Democratic voters, there is little appetite for a brawl over the merits of Obama\u2019s record. And while Obama\u2019s consensus-seeking liberalism appeals to many Democratic voters, few appear to be thinking about the 2020 primary as a forum for determining which candidate would follow Obama\u2019s exact policy blueprint.\n\nInterviews with Democratic voters and party leaders found near-unanimous admiration for the former president and his policies, a sense of nostalgia for what they recall as his dignified conduct \u2014 and, at the same time, a hunger for something new.\n\nObama remains immensely popular among Democrats: In a poll published Tuesday by NBC News and The Wall Street Journal, nine in 10 Democrats said they viewed him in positive terms. More than three-quarters said they believed Obama \u201cdid as much as was possible at the time in addressing the issues facing the country.\u201d\n\nObama has kept a low profile in the presidential race, meeting privately with many of the Democratic candidates but telling associates that he does not see it as his place to direct the party\u2019s future. He has expressed interest, at different times, in rising stars like former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana. Obama had issued a warm statement about Biden\u2019s entry into the primary but had declined to endorse him or anyone else.\n\nSome of the aura around Obama surrounds Biden, too, granting him much of the party\u2019s good will.\n\n\u201cHe was with President Obama,\u201d said Tajshiek Nehemiah, 31, who watched Biden deliver a speech in Birmingham, Alabama, last Sunday. \u201cI like the way he spoke as vice president, what he stood for, what he believes.\u201d\n\nBut Democrats supporting other candidates have no difficulty reconciling that preference with their affection for Obama. And they do not necessarily connect the social problems the left is most focused on, like economic inequality and health care costs, to the agenda Obama pursued on those issues.\n\n\u201cI love Obama,\u201d Maureen Conboy, a lawyer in New York, said Monday after watching Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts give a speech in Washington Square Park. \u201cHe made mistakes but he\u2019s honest, he really cared \u2014 you could just tell he\u2019s a good person.\u201d\n\nConboy also said that was the past.\n\n\u201cI think re-litigating what happened, making this about Obama, the Obama administration, is the wrong thing,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to look forward, and if it\u2019s Biden, we\u2019re going to do nothing but looking back.\u201d\n\nPatrick Dillon, Obama\u2019s former deputy political director in the White House, said many Democrats shared that mindset. He said candidates had to offer new ideas, but saw little evidence that skepticism of Obama was growing.\n\n\u201cI think every candidate has to talk about how they\u2019re going to build forward from the Obama legacy,\u201d said Dillon, who is married to O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign manager but is not working for the campaign. \u201cThe notion of \u2018building on\u2019 seems to have won the conversation, versus the notion of aggressively reassessing or tearing down.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for Obama declined to comment.\n\nThat any Democrat might consider running as an Obama clone underscores his unusual political stature. No recent former president has enjoyed a comparable glow immediately after leaving office. Even relatively popular presidents were seen as more tainted: for Ronald Reagan, there was Iran-Contra; for Bill Clinton, the lurid ripples of impeachment.", "description": "In some of the tensest moments of the 2020 debates, a viewer might have concluded that Democrats were poised for a large-scale clash over the legacy of President Barack Obama.There have been heated arguments about whether to stick with Obama's architecture for health care policy or to pursue a single-payer", "authors": ["Alexander Burns"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/tV1EZoScpMKAw9khpkABGg--~B/aD0zMzg2O3c9NTA3OTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_new_york_times_articles_158/f5506f090c08203e6957bfb35b73d5f5", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
