Most areas of B.C. currently \"spring forward\" into daylight time in March then \"fall back\" to standard time in November.\n\nIf daylight time is kept year-round, meaning no clock changes, sunrise would be later in the winter in B.C. That means it could stay dark until as late as 9 a.m. PT in Vancouver or 9:30 a.m. in northern communities like Prince George.\n\nThe Vancouver skyline is pictured on May 13, 2016.

(GP Mendoza/CBC)\n\nMore than 223,000 residents responded to the survey \u2014 nearly 12 times the amount of responses the government got for its public consultations on the regulation of cannabis.\n\nThree-quarters said health concerns were the driving reasons behind their support for scrapping the clock change. More than half noted the benefits of extra daylight during their evening commutes in winter, while 39 per cent mentioned other safety concerns in their responses.\n\nWest Coast alignment\n\nHorgan has previously said B.C. would stick to its time-changing ways because the province needs to keep with time in neighbouring jurisdictions. More than half of respondents agreed, saying it was \"important\" or \"very important\" that B.C. be aligned with its neighbours when it comes to keeping time.\n\nIn Alberta, proposed legislation that would have ended daylight time in the province won overwhelming public support in 2017. However, the Alberta legislature shot down the idea this week after an all-party committee said the impact on business would be too onerous.\n\nSaskatchewan has never practised daylight time, having rejected the idea when it first took hold more than 50 years ago.\n\nIf British Columbia moves to permanent daylight time, as respondents want to do, it means the province won't \"fall\" back in November while most of the country still will.\n\nIt would mean B.C. and its neighbour to the east, Alberta, would be on the same time for four months, until Alberta springs forward to return to standard time in March. It also means B.C. would only be two hours behind Ontario over the winter, rather than the usual three hours for the rest of the year.\n\nSunset sky above YVR airport in Vancouver.

(Mike Hillman/CBC)\n\nLegislators from the three U.S. states aligned with B.C. \u2014 Washington, Oregon and California \u2014 proposed bills this year that would end the one-hour time changes from standard time to daylight time in spring, then back again in fall, instead sticking to one time setting year-round.\n\nHorgan said in March he sent a letter to the three governors of those states, requesting they share information on the proposed change.\n\nMore than two dozen other U.S. states are considering measures to avoid the twice-yearly clock change. Federal law in the U.S. allows states to opt into standard time permanently \u2014 which Hawaii and Arizona have done \u2014 but opting out is prohibited and requires congressional action.\n\nHorgan said the results of the survey will be incorporated as B.C. moves toward its decision.\n\n\"This engagement has done exactly as we hoped it would in providing clarity about a preferred direction. The insights generated will be relied upon as we make a final decision about how to move forward,\" the premier wrote.", "description": "More than 93 per cent of British Columbians who responded to a government survey want to do away with the twice-yearly clock change and make daylight time permanent, the province said Tuesday.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5278070.1568142018!/cumulusImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/daylight-saving-clock.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
