Elizabeth Warren Joins Striking Chicago Teachers To Support Unions And Schools", "language": "en", "text": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) flew into rainy Chicago on Tuesday morning to join the city\u2019s teachers and support staff in their sixth day of striking for a better union contract deal with the city and Chicago Public Schools.\n\nWarren, who is running for president in the 2020 election, joined the Chicago Teachers Union and Service Employees International Union Local 73 on the picket line at DePriest Elementary School on the West Side to voice her support for unions and public school educators.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here to stand with Chicago teachers. I\u2019m here to stand with Chicago nurses. I\u2019m here to stand with Chicago\u2019s librarians,\u201d Warren told the cheering crowd outside the school. Joining her were CTU President Jesse Sharkey and American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten.\n\nRallying with Chicago's striking teachers and school support staff, Elizabeth Warren says she knows what it's like to be in their shoes pic.twitter.com/p901fDnZ7S \u2014 Nader Issa (@NaderDIssa) October 22, 2019\n\nCTU and SEIU were in their sixth day of striking and fourth day of no classes on Tuesday as the unions continued negotiating with Mayor Lori Lightfoot and CPS on issues like smaller class sizes; more nurses, social workers and special education teachers; affordable housing; and better pay. There has been no academic instruction in the schools since Oct. 17, but buildings have stayed open to provide meals and safe places for children who need them.\n\nCPS is the third-largest school district in the nation, with 25,000 teachers serving more than 300,000 students. The size of the district has given the strike nationwide significance as the relatively new mayor clashes with Chicago\u2019s public school teachers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here because the eyes of this nation are upon you,\u201d Warren said. \u201cThey have turned to Chicago for you to lead the way, for you to show how the power of standing together is the power of making real change in this country.\u201d\n\nIn her campaign, Warren has called public education an issue that\u2019s personal. The senator was a special education teacher at a public elementary school in New Jersey when she was in her 20s, but she said she left after being discriminated against for being pregnant.\n\nI attended and taught at America\u2019s public schools, and I believe in them. That's why I've got a plan to invest in public schools and ensure every kid in America has the same access to a high-quality public education. https://t.co/XAPnwjooVX \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 21, 2019\n\n\u201cA long time ago, I stood where you stand. I was there on the frontlines with the children,\u201d the senator said. \u201cI remember what it was like to see a child\u2019s eyes light up. I remember what it was like to be one of the most important people in a child\u2019s life.\u201d\n\nWarren\u2019s visit comes just one day after the presidential candidate unveiled her sweeping education plan to tackle segregation, high-stakes testing and for-profit charters for kindergarten through 12th grade. At the center of her plan is fighting continued segregation in the education system, a battle that schools in Chicago\u2019s South and West Sides have historically dealt with.\n\n\u201cI believe in public education, and I believe it is time in America to make a new investment in public education,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I got a plan for that.\u201d\n\nIn addition to supporting public schools, Warren said she was also in Chicago to stress the importance of unions and worker rights.\n\n\u201cBecause the unions are how we have a voice. The unions are how we have power. The unions are how we make sure that the needs of every one of our children are heard loud and clear,\u201d she said.\n\nWarren\u2019s campaign did not immediately respond to HuffPost\u2019s questions on whether she had spoken to Lightfoot about the strike and whether standing with the unions has affected her relationship, as a Democratic presidential candidate, with a major city\u2019s mayor.\n\nLightfoot downplayed Warren\u2019s alliance with the unions at a news conference Tuesday morning.\n\nMORNING UPDATE: Mayor Lightfoot joins press in Northside Chicago for brief media availability. https://t.co/bgbFZPA3aK \u2014 Mayor Lori Lightfoot (@chicagosmayor) October 22, 2019\n\n\u201cShe has her right to come in. I would expect all Democratic candidates for the presidency to support workers. That\u2019s who we are as a party,\u201d the mayor said. \u201cBut at the end of the day, what\u2019s going to get it done is what happens at the bargaining table.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, Lightfoot and school district CEO Janice Jackson wrote a letter to Sharkey urging the union to end the strike and go back to work while negotiations continue, and she said at a news conference that teachers are asking for too much money. Sharkey, who earlier hoped negotiations could wrap up by the end of the week, told reporters Monday night that the mayor\u2019s remarks \u201cdashed my hopes\u201d on the walkout ending soon.\n\nChicago Public Schools announced that the union did not end its strike as of 4 p.m. Tuesday, leading to the walkout\u2019s continuation Wednesday and students\u2019 fifth day out of class. The teachers union is calling for a national day of action on Thursday, asking teachers nationwide to show support for Chicago\u2019s teachers.\n\n\u201cThe nation turns to you to show how people who fight from the heart, people who are told: \u2018Quit now, give up,\u2019\u201d Warren told strikers, \u201c[they] don\u2019t give up. They stay in the fight for what they believe, and they change the course of American history.\u201d", "description": "The Massachusetts Democrat and 2020 presidential candidate stood alongside the Chicago Teachers Union in its sixth day of striking for a better contract ...", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5daf9670210000ba1e34ac19.jpeg?cache=c6amjtldlp&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
