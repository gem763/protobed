In emails supplied to Congress by the state department inspector general, Kent expressed concerns about White House efforts to remove the then ambassador to Ukraine.\n\nThe impeachment inquiry is moving at dizzying speed. The Axios website noted that if everyone agrees to appear, Democrats will have interviewed 11 administration officials by the end of next week. Every witness has \u201cbolstered the case against Trump\u201d, Axios added, leaving White House officials demoralised or panicked.\n\nThe hearings have been held behind closed doors but Democrats may yet decide to publish transcripts. Trump, who has been leading his own defence, tweeted on Tuesday: \u201cDemocrats are allowing no transparency at the Witch Hunt hearings. If Republicans ever did this they would be excoriated by the Fake News.

It concerned the role played by Rudy Giuliani, the former New York mayor commonly described as Trump\u2019s lawyer, in trying to persuade the Ukrainian government to open investigations into Democrats including Biden.\n\nHill said Bolton instructed her to tell the NSC\u2019s attorney that Giuliani was acting in concert with White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, in a rogue operation with legal implications.\n\n\u201cI am not part of whatever drug deal Rudy and Mulvaney are cooking up,\u201d Bolton instructed Hill to tell the NSC lawyer, according to her testimony.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The House intelligence committee chairman, Adam Schiff, arrives for a closed door meeting on Capitol Hill in Washington on Tuesday.

Show Hide Article 1 of the United States constitution gives the House of Representatives the sole power to initiate impeachment and the Senate the sole power to try impeachments of the president. A president can be impeached if they are judged to have committed \"treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors\" \u2013 although the constitution does not specify what \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d are. The process starts with the House of Representatives passing articles of impeachment. A simple majority of members need to vote in favour of impeachment for it to pass to the next stage. Democrats currently control the house, with 235 representatives. The chief justice of the US supreme court then presides over the proceedings in the Senate, where the president is tried, with senators acting as the jury. For the president to be found guilty two-thirds of senators must vote to convict. Republicans currently control the Senate, with 53 of the 100 senators. Two presidents have previously been impeached, Bill Clinton in 1998, and Andrew Johnson in 1868, though neither was removed from office as a result. Richard Nixon resigned in 1974 before there was a formal vote to impeach him. Martin Belam\n\nHill also testified on Monday about Trump\u2019s decision, taken despite strenuous objections from aides including herself, to recall the ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch.\n\nThe Washington Post reported that Hill had confronted Sondland over Giuliani\u2019s activities, which were not coordinated with officials charged with carrying out foreign policy. Sondland is due to give his version of events on Thursday.\n\nI did nothing wrong at all, but it was poor judgment to be in the middle of something that is \u2026 a swamp in many ways Hunter Biden\n\nThe impeachment inquiry was sparked by a whistleblower complaint filed in August that in part described a 25 July phone call between Trump and the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in which Trump requested the \u201cfavor\u201d of an investigation into Biden, a potential rival in the 2020 election.\n\nTrump-Ukraine impeachment scandal: timeline of key events Read more\n\nTrump and Republicans have repeated unproven allegations of corruption against Hunter Biden, who was on the board of a gas company in Ukraine while his father was involved in international efforts to curb corruption in its government.\n\nBreaking his silence over his business dealings in Ukraine and China, the younger Biden told ABC News on Tuesday he had allowed himself to become involved in what he described as \u201ca swamp\u201d. But he repeatedly denied ever discussing his foreign work with his father.\n\n\u201cIn retrospect, I think there was poor judgment on my part,\u201d he said. \u201cI know I did nothing wrong at all, but it was poor judgment to be in the middle of something that is \u2026 a swamp in many ways.\u201d\n\nWhy the battle for the suburbs is Democrats\u2019 key to winning 2020 Read more\n\nSeveral Democratic strategists have questioned the wisdom of Hunter Biden speaking out. The fear is that it might switch the focus away from Trump\u2019s efforts to enlist the help of the Ukraine government and on to the president\u2019s home ground: his unsubstantiated claims of corruption on the part of the Bidens.\n\nThe week could deteriorate rapidly for Trump, whose effort to rally defenders in his own party has been damaged by concerns about a growing disaster in northern Syria, following Trump\u2019s abrupt pullback there, and a sense that major secrets attached to the Ukraine scandal are yet to emerge.\n\nMeanwhile, on Tuesday afternoon, Giuliani formally notified the House that he wouldn\u2019t submit documents demanded via subpoena by the Trump-Ukraine impeachment inquiry.\n\nIn a letter to the relevant committee chairmen from his erstwhile lawyer, Jon Sale, the inquiry was condemned as \u201can unconstitutional, baseless and illegitimate \u2018impeachment inquiry\u2019\u201d and the subpoena called \u201coverbroad and unduly burdensome\u201d.\n\nThe government budget office said that it would not comply with the demand for documents, either.\n\nThe subpoena issued to the office of management and budget related to the delay in military funds to Ukraine.\n\nThat issue is at the heart of the impeachment inquiry, in relation to allegations that Trump held back congressionally approved aid to Ukraine as a form of pressure to persuade the new president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to investigate the Bidens.", "description": "State department official George Kent testifies in private as Hunter Biden admits \u2018poor judgment\u2019 but denies wrongdoing", "authors": ["Julian Borger", "David Smith", "Tom Mccarthy", "Ed Pilkington"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f0948a82097b0ec8de2dd00cd555445d45eca710/0_96_4407_2645/master/4407.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f32e2d3351b71e62bd57fa1bc49298fc", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
