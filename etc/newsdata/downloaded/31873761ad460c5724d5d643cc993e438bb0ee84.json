This week, Air Canada announced it removed the jets from its schedule until Feb. 14, WestJet Airlines Ltd. scrubbed them from its holiday schedule and leisure airline Sunwing won\u2019t re-introduce them until May 2020.\n\nStill, the reintroduction could eventually put pressure on pricing since it will add significant capacity worldwide, said Robert Kokonis, president of consultancy AirTrav Inc.\n\nWhen the jets were pulled from the skies after the tragedies in Indonesia and Ethiopia, about 325 of the 737 Max fleet were operating daily, including 24 for Air Canada and 13 for WestJet. Since then, Boeing delivered roughly 70 more jets and produced another 300, Kokonis said, meaning about 700 aircraft will be re-introduced into commercial service in the next year.\n\n\u201cAt three to four flights per day, that\u2019s half a million seats back into the global market place,\u201d he said. \u201cThat will be a yield bubble that will somewhat burst.\u201d\n\nOn top of the groundings, financial trouble spelled the end for airlines including South Korea\u2019s Air Philip, Britain\u2019s Thomas Cook (four of its airlines went under), Iceland\u2019s Wow Air, France\u2019s XL Airways and Denmark\u2019s Primera Air. While not all of these had routes to Canada, some did, leaving passengers clamouring for seats on Canada\u2019s local airlines, Kokonis said.\n\nThis comes at a time of solid demand for all North American airlines, CIBC analyst Kevin Chiang noted in a report this week.\n\n\u201cWe continue to see a healthy demand environment for air travel, which is keeping load factors elevated with strong pricing,\u201d Chiang wrote.\n\nAltaCorp analyst Chris Murray also noted the strong demand when evaluating the trend of higher prices.\n\n\u201cLots of folks are travelling,\u201d Murray said, adding the airport authorities are saying they had \u201ctremendous\u201d traffic this summer.\n\nBut for the airlines there\u2019s a flip side to the higher fares \u2014 higher costs.\n\nIn order to accommodate demand, airlines have been flying larger planes on domestic routes, spending big on schedule changes and, in some cases, giving up routes, Murray said. While Boeing plans to compensate airlines for the problems \u2014 it estimated a US$5-billion charge in July \u2014 it\u2019s not clear exactly how much.\n\nMurray anticipates Air Canada will be slower than most to return the planes to service since it has delayed hiring and training pilots for the jets, a completely new type of plane for the airline.\n\n\u201cJust be very cautious about the pace at which we can ramp to the full fleet size,\u201d Murray said.\n\n\u2022 Email: ejackson@nationalpost.com | Twitter: theemilyjackson", "description": "A perfect storm of high demand, Boeing 737 Max grounding and airline bankruptcies", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/air-canada-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
