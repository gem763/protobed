I just wanted to send a message of positivity to you, I hope your weeks [sic] been amazing and wishing you a great weekend,\" he wrote on Instagram.\n\n\"I appreciate all the positive vibes you've sent my way. I haven't given up, I'm still right here fighting! #stillirise.\"\n\nHamilton previously said it had taken him \"32 years to understand the impact\" he was having on the world, adding he was \"figuring out daily\" how to \"play a better part\".\n\n\"I want my life to mean something and honestly up until now my life's had no meaning,\" he said. \"Being a part of the issue is not meaningful. Being part of the solution is and I'm striving to do better.\"\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nHamilton called on his followers to \"research\" and \"recognise\" how what they ate kept \"the meat and dairy industry flourishing and therefore deforestation, animal cruelty, our seas and climate decaying on a daily basis\".\n\nHamilton added: \"Go vegan, it is the only way to truly save our planet today. It can be done so quickly, all you have to do is put your mind to it.\n\n\"Honestly I feel like giving up on everything. Shut down completely. Why bother when the world is such a mess and people don't seem to care. I'm going to take a moment away to gather my thoughts. Thank you to those of you who do give a damn about the world.\"", "description": "Lewis Hamilton recently urged his fans to go vegan and said he feels like \"giving up on everything\" due to his concerns about the environment", "authors": ["Matt Maltby", "Image", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20586582.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Lewis-Hamilton-File-Photo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
