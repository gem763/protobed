In that document, which was released by lawmakers, the whistleblower raised concerns about Trump\u2019s July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, during which Trump pressed for an investigation of Joe Biden, one of his political rivals, and dangled a White House meeting.\n\nThe White House released a rough transcript of the call last month.\n\nThe whistleblower, according to the statement from Bakaj and Zaid, \u201cvoluntarily provided relevant career information\u201d to the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general to \u201cfacilitate an assessment of the credibility of the complaint.\u201d\n\nThe inspector general concluded that the whistleblower\u2019s complaint was urgent and credible, they added.\n\nThe whistleblower\u2019s identity is irrelevant, the attorneys said.\n\n\u201cTo date, virtually every substantive allegation has been confirmed by other sources,\u201d their statement says.\n\nFelicia Sonmez contributed to this story.", "description": "Their statement followed tweets by President Trump that allege the whistleblower had ties to one of his opponents.", "authors": ["Congress", "Campaigns", "Health Policy", "Pennsylvania Politics", "October At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/X3SsXdhSUKWrFJIBywn_wyKp1jA=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6IA2DFXK5EI6TEYGI7FQGJH5IQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
