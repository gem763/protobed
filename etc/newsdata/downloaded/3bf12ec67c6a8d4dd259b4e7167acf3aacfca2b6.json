The whip count looked close, but after the so-called Letwin Amendment passed, Johnson said there was little point in proceeding with the vote on his deal. He also vowed not to negotiate an extension beyond the Oct. 31 deadline with the EU \u2014 though he is bound by law to seek one.", "description": "\"No deal\" is now dead \u2014 or is it?", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/EwEhyKDb3Hlbq9Dj84yfQ9j0avI=/0x220:4000x2470/1920x1080/2019/10/19/1571494620412.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
