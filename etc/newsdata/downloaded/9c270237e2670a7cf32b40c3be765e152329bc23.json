One such time was a surreal 48 hours in Miami in 2006.\n\nIn his new autobiography, he reveals: \u201cIt was just after the World Cup in Germany and I went to Miami with some mates.\n\n\"We went to this club and I walked past this guy and went, \u2018It\u2019s [actor] Mickey Rourke\u2019.\u201d\n\n(Image: PA Archive/Press Association Ima)\n\nPeter, known for his robotic celebration dances, said: \u201cAs I walked past, he went, \u2018Oh my god. You\u2019re robot boy!\u2019, and I went, \u2018That\u2019s me.\u2019 We had a drink by the bar, and then we got a picture of me and him doing the robot.\u201d And the pair kept boozing together afterwards.\n\n\u201cWe all went over to his table and carried on drinking. At the end of the night he said, \u2018Let\u2019s do this again tomorrow night. Meet me at this bar,\u2019 and we thought, \u2018Yeah, right, he\u2019ll never turn up,\u2019 but he did and the same thing happened the next night.\n\n\u201cIt turns out he\u2019s a huge football fan and had watched the World Cup so we bonded over that and the second night was just like the first. One massive party. At the end of that night it he was like, \u2018Hey guys, let\u2019s meet for dinner tomorrow,\u2019 and we were like, \u2018OK chum, it\u2019s wearing a bit thin now.\u2019\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d done two big nights, we\u2019d had about five hours sleep in the last 48 hours. So we just headed back to our hotel room to recover after getting in at 4am.\n\n(Image: Reuters)\n\n\u201cThen a few hours later there was a knock on the door and we could see through the peephole that it was Mickey, saying, \u2018Hey guys. Mickey Rourke. Let\u2019s do it again\u2019. But were all like, \u2018F*** this lads. Let\u2019s bin him.\u2019\n\n\"So we binned Mickey Rourke by pretending we weren\u2019t in, but that didn\u2019t deter him. He posted a note under the door saying \u2018Let\u2019s meet here tonight,\u2019 but we threw it away. We couldn\u2019t hack it.\u201d\n\nThis is just one of many tales in Peter\u2019s new book I, Robot: How to be a Footballer 2. After 22 years in the game, a dozen professional clubs and 22 international goals, the 6ft 7in striker with \u201clinguine\u201d arms surely deserves some kudos.\n\nBut one celebrity who wasn\u2019t the least bit impressed with his credentials was Madonna, who he ended up sitting next to at a restaurant on that same trip to Miami.\n\nAfter spending some time signing autographs and FaceTiming the children of her four British bodyguards, he thought he\u2019d earned at least a quick chat with the pop star. But it was not to be.\n\nPeter explained: \u201cSuddenly they got all serious and just said, \u2018She doesn\u2019t want to be disturbed. \u2019 I was like, \u2018Neither do f***ing I want to be disturbed, but I\u2019ve just spent half an hour with you\u2019.\n\n\u201cBut they were just like, \u2018No. We can\u2019t ask her\u2019, so perhaps being blown out by Madonna was kind of karma for blowing out Mickey Rourke.\"\n\nIn the book, Peter also addresses more serious issues, such as the ongoing racism in the game. He said he first witnessed it on a Spanish club tour with Tottenham Hotspur in the late 90s.\n\nHe said: \u201cI grew up in London surrounded by a diverse mix of ethnicities so racism didn\u2019t really register for me. I remember visiting a water park with Ledley King and a couple of other black lads.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs we were walking around, this woman started spitting on the floor at us. It was the first time I\u2019d encountered racism and I couldn\u2019t get my head round it. I know there have been a few incidents in the last few years but it\u2019s got to be better than when I started out, but obviously it\u2019s a fight that still needs to be fought.\u201d\n\nPeter then lightens the tone with tales of his favourite pastime \u2013 hedge jumping. He says: \u201cI\u2019ve always loved jumping bushes. Ever since I was a kid. We just find the springiest hedges and launch ourselves at them and then see how far they propelled us.\n\n(Image: Sunday Mercury)\n\n\u201cI almost broke my neck once on a first-class hedge when I was trying to break into the first team at QPR. I spotted a beauty coming up, and launched myself, only to spot, at the very last moment, a large metal spike sticking up through the middle.\n\n\"Twisting in the air, I somehow managed to brush it with my leg rather than catching it directly where it surely would have killed me. I still sustained a brutal gash up my thigh.\n\n\u201cAs I lay there on the pavement in agony, blood coming through my jeans, I thought, \u2018Is this how it all ends? Is this how I go out of professional football, when I\u2019ve barely even begun?\u2019.\u201d Thankfully for Peter, and his many fans, he lived to play another day.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Peter Crouch said even Prince Harry told him model wife Abbey Clancy is way out of his league", "authors": ["Nick Mcgrath", "Image", "Reuters Getty", "Getty Images Europe", "Pa", "Pa Archive Press Association Ima", "Reuters", "Sunday Mercury"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20578536.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Bradley-Theodore-VIP-private-view-At-Maddox-Gallery-Mayfair.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
