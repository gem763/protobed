Page said the process would begin with overhauling the police board, which oversees the police chief, adding that an announcement on the new appointments is \u201cforthcoming.\u201d\n\nAn attorney for Wildhaber did not respond to a request for comment late Sunday. The police department also could not be reached. The county\u2019s police union said in a statement to The Washington Post on Monday that it has \u201ca long history of fighting for equality for all of our members.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhile we are extremely embarrassed of the alleged actions of some of our Department\u2019s senior commanders, we look forward to the healing process that can begin to take place now that this has been heard in open court,\u201d the statement said.\n\nAD\n\nThe jury\u2019s decision marked the end of a week-long trial during which the police department was accused of having an anti-LGBT culture and a history of retaliation that ultimately led to Wildhaber being passed up for promotions 23 times, the Post-Dispatch reported. St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar and other members of the department denied the allegations of discrimination in testimony, but jurors decided in favor of Wildhaber.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to send a message,\u201d the jury foreman told reporters, according to the Post-Dispatch. \u201cIf you discriminate you are going to pay a big price. \u2026 You can\u2019t defend the indefensible.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nWildhaber joined the department as a security officer in 1994 after spending four years in the U.S. Army, the lawsuit said. He became a police officer in 1997 and rose through the department\u2019s ranks, working as a patrolman and then a detective until 2011, when he was promoted to the rank of sergeant.\n\nAD\n\nThree years later, Wildhaber, who had a clean disciplinary record and positive performance reviews, set his sights on lieutenant, according to the complaint. Wildhaber\u2019s scores from a written test and another unspecified assessment ranked him third out of the 26 candidates vying for the position, placing him in a group of officers \u201cconsidered to be first in line for promotions,\u201d the suit said.\n\nThen, while visiting a restaurant in February 2014 on a routine check, Wildhaber ran into John Saracino, who was a member of the county police board, the lawsuit said. That\u2019s when Wildhaber alleged that Saracino made the remark about his \u201cgayness.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI think I said, \u2018I can\u2019t believe we are having this conversation in 2014.\u2019 It was devastating to hear,\u201d Wildhaber testified Wednesday, according to the Post-Dispatch. \u201cWe had never spoken of my sexuality before, and I thought he was just trying to be helpful to me and looking out for my best interest in the promotional process.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSaracino has denied that the conversation between him and Wildhaber ever took place, telling the Post-Dispatch in 2017, \u201cI would never say anything like that.\u201d\n\nStill, the lawsuit alleged that Wildhaber, who continued to apply for open lieutenant positions, remained a sergeant while his colleagues were promoted.\n\nIn April 2016, Wildhaber filed a discrimination complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the Missouri Commission on Human Rights, alleging that the county had \u201cfailed to promote him based on his sex/gender,\u201d according to the lawsuit.\n\nAD\n\nInstead of being promoted, in May that year Wildhaber says he was transferred to another precinct roughly 27 miles from his home, where he was assigned to work 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. Before filing the complaint, Wildhaber had been working the afternoon shift much closer to home, the suit said. Not long after his transfer, Wildhaber submitted a second complaint, this time tacking on a retaliation charge.\n\nAD\n\nThe suit alleged that Wildhaber was denied promotions because his \u201cbehavior, mannerisms, and/or appearance do not fit the stereotypical norms of what a \u2018male\u2019 should be.\u201d It also alleged that switching Wildhaber to \u201can undesirable shift at an undesirable work location\u201d after he filed the complaints amounted to retaliation.\n\nDuring last week\u2019s trial, Wildhaber\u2019s attorneys called witnesses who testified that higher-ranking officers had either made inappropriate comments about the police sergeant or about members of the LGBT community in general.\n\nAD\n\nOne witness recalled a captain describing Wildhaber as \u201cfruity\u201d at an event in April 2015, according to the Post-Dispatch. The captain went on to say that Wildhaber was \u201cway too out there with his gayness and he needed to tone it down\u201d if he wanted to be promoted.\n\nAD\n\nBut another witness, who at one point was an executive assistant to Deputy Chief of Police Kenneth Gregory, said the department\u2019s poor treatment of LGBT employees goes beyond Wildhaber. The witness said she once heard Gregory tell a commander that the Bible says homosexuality is \u201can abomination,\u201d the Post-Dispatch reported. The witness told jurors that when her colleagues learned she identified as gay, she too experienced \u201charassment, humiliation and embarrassment almost daily.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, St. Louis County leaders stressed that change is necessary to prevent future incidents. Councilwoman Lisa Clancy (D) also called for Belmar to resign.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt is clear to me that there is a rampant culture of homophobia and also racism,\u201d Clancy told KSDK. \u201cThe council hears about this almost every week at our council meetings, but also within the community, that there\u2019s a lot of issues within our police department right now.\u201d\n\nPage did not specify Sunday whether Belmar would remain in his position, only noting that the chief and the current police board had \u201cserved the county faithfully for years.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "\u201cWe wanted to send a message,\u201d the jury foreman said. \u201cIf you discriminate you are going to pay a big price. \u2026 You can\u2019t defend the indefensible.\u201d", "authors": ["Allyson Chiu", "Reporter With The Morning Mix Team"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Jge8sgfwWFApoQYkHD9sU8R9CJg=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6FY3X2HYFAI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
