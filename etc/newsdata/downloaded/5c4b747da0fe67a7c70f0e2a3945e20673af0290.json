I was with my sister for six weeks, I fled the house in the final week I left him.\n\n\"I felt like I was being suffocated with all of this contact, it was incessant. I had to leave my job, I didn\u2019t feel safe working at the gym.\n\n(Image: Heath Speakman/ Cavendish Press)\n\n\"Then I moved in with my friend but I felt like I was constantly checking number plates and vans. He was following me around in work and I felt there was no way of getting away from him. He knew my routine and I felt my world was so small.\n\n\"This has affected everything I have ever done, everything with work, even now. As a personal trainer, I have to put myself out there in the public domain and I can\u2019t go into hiding.\n\n\"But any time I have an enquiry for, an unknown number, there\u2019s that fear that it\u2019s him.\n\n\"In the back of my mind he is still watching from some sort of account. I am constantly looking over my shoulder, even now. I fear for other women as well.\u201d\n\nThe court heard the pair had dated for three years and lived together in Disley but they split up in 2018 and Speakman began hounding her soon after that.\n\n(Image: Kate Brooks/ Cavendish Press (Ma)\n\nShe said: \"He was accusing me of cheating and lying and he was obsessively using social media.\n\n\"He was obsessed with this one person called Tom and he was fixated with him and during our whole relationship he was accusing me of cheating with him.\n\n\"The messages were erratic, they were coming from all communication channels, he was posting abusive comments and sending me emails.\n\n\"He was setting up multiple email accounts and he sent me messages saying I owed him money. There were email messages saying he had cancer and that he was going to commit suicide.\n\n\"He was suffocating me and coming from all angles, it was nonstop, multiple times a day, multiple comments over many different channels.\n\n(Image: Heath Speakman/ Cavendish Press)\n\n\"I knew the emails were fake email accounts and I knew they would be from him. He was saying he was not going to stop this until I responded.\n\n\"He said he was going to confront me and it got to that point that the police officer I was going to, was convinced he was saying this so many times that he was going to come and confront me, so she had him arrested.\n\n\"He even committed fraud in my name. He contacted N Power as we used them at the house we previously lived at.\n\n\"He claimed that I was the tenant and he said he was the landlord and a \u00a33,000 bill was sent to my sisters address, as I was living with my sister at the time.\n\n\"That was the final straw and I went to the police about that. I received hundreds of texts, around 50 emails, all of which I still have.\n\n(Image: Kate Brooks/ Cavendish Press (Ma)\n\n\"They were from a lot of different accounts. He set up a fake Facebook account of someone called 'Kevin Green'. He also set up another profile of a man\u2019s name with woman\u2019s picture.\n\n\"I had a blog, which I\u2019ve since deleted, called \u201cGym and Toneics\u201d and he used his business page \u201cCleaning and Furniture\u201d to comment on every single thing I posted.\n\n\"I posted a blog post and he wrote: \u201cWas Tom there, did you talk about me\u201d.\n\n''Tom was a personal trainer I had sessions with him years ago and he was obsessed with that guy. He thought I had cheated with him. Many arguments were started about this guy.\n\n\"I even received a friend request on Instagram from \u201cStretchTomOne\u201d when Tom had an account called \u201cStretchTom\u201d, so I knew Heath had made a fake account.\n\n(Image: Kate Brooks/ Cavendish Press (Ma)\n\n\"The police did get in touch with Tom and he confirmed it was a fake account and the defendant had mirrored his account, it was the same kind of biography and everything.\n\n\"I wrote a blog post called the naked truth and he commented: 'Wouldn\u2019t worry, everyone has seen you naked'. My blog was just about exercising and gym.\n\n\"Every single picture I put on that account, he commented on. An account called 'Kevin Green' tried to add me then he sent me a message. He was texting me saying if I didn\u2019t respond he would confront me.\n\n\"When we were together I worked at a gym and he had a free membership because I worked there but I can count on one hand the amount of times he went into the gym to use it. Then when I split up with him, he went all the time.\n\n\"Work were aware of what was going on. I changed my shift at the gym.\n\n(Image: Kate Brooks/ Cavendish Press (Ma)\n\n\"I would see his car driving round the the gym and then I would see his car parked next to my car. One evening I was escorted out of work by a member of staff and he had left a letter on the windscreen on my car.\n\n\"It said: 'Kate, I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019ve seen my email, I think you have but I need to be sure. I have an STI, and what I have is cancer.\n\n\"You need to get a smear test...\u201d I have never suffered with anxiety ever, not properly. I am now fully aware of what I was in, in terms of how bad this relationship was.''\n\nSpeakman was arrested in August last year.\n\nPc Tracy Brookes told the JPs: \u201cHe explained they were looking to move to Devon.\n\n\"Heath Speakman confirmed emailing her several times using several accounts and when asked why, he said he wanted to make sure she got the message about the STI as he was aware she had blocked him on social media.\n\n''When asked why he continued to contact her after she blocked him, he said he didn\u2019t know if she was getting the message.\n\n\"He said he is receiving treatment at hospital and said he knew one of the Facebook accounts but he was not responsible. He said he had a friend staying at his house and they used his phone to make the posts, but he did not name them.\n\n\"He was asked about the Facebook account Kevin Green but he said it was not him. He said he thought everyone knows about the whole situation, so it could be anyone.\n\n\"He said he told a woman about the situation and said she had apologised to him for doing it, but he didn\u2019t name the woman. He confirmed he had been to the gym with his children.''\n\nMagistrates found the case proved in Speakman's absence.", "description": "Kate Brooks, 35, was left a 'broken woman' after she hounded by businessman Heath Speakman who falsely claimed he had cancer, threatened suicide and said he had a STD", "authors": ["Amy Walker", "Lorraine King", "Image", "Heath Speakman", "Cavendish Press", "Kate Brooks", "Ma"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20755120.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_PAY-Cavendish-Press-Manchester-Ltd.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
