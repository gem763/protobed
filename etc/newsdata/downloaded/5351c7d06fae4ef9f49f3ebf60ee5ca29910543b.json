It has shed 84% of its value since the inauguration in late 2015 of President Mauricio Macri, an advocate of open markets who has failed to solve Argentina\u2019s long-standing economic problems.\n\nMacri is expected to lose Sunday\u2019s vote to populist-leaning Peronist Alberto Fernandez. Polls show Fernandez could win outright, avoiding a November second-round vote\n\n\u201cThe central bank is intervening, basically trying to get to the election with a mixture of not losing too much in reserves while maintaining a foreign exchange rate that is not too restless,\u201d said economist Martin Kalos with consultancy Elypsis.\n\nBusiness leaders and investors welcomed Macri\u2019s election four years ago, but his orthodox policies have not healed Latin America\u2019s No. 3 economy. Economic activity shrank 3.8% in August from a year earlier, government data showed on Thursday. Inflation is at 53.5%.\n\nThe presidential front-runner\u2019s running mate is Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, a populist icon who implemented heavy trade and currency controls during her two terms ending in 2015.\n\nAlberto Fernandez says he would be firmly in charge if elected, although some investors and average Argentines say they suspect the former president would play an outsized role.\n\n\u201cThere is a lack of confidence in Alberto Fernandez\u2019s promises. And I believe it would take him a long time to gain it,\u201d said Gabriel Zelpo, director of economic consultancy Seido.\n\nMacri was elected on promises of \u201cnormalizing\u201d an economy distorted by Fernandez de Kirchner\u2019s market interventions. But he overestimated his ability to attract investment and underestimated the inflationary impact of his fiscal policies.\n\nThese included cuts in public utility subsidies that boosted electricity and heating bills for businesses, which in turn hiked prices for the goods and services they sold. Inflation took off and has yet to moderate. Consumer prices rose 5.9% in September alone.\n\nWidely expected to be sworn in as Argentina\u2019s leader in December, Fernandez this week appealed to Macri to take measures to keep the currency stable during the likely upcoming transition of government. The peso tumbled after Fernandez thumped Macri in the Aug. 11 primary election, Argentina\u2019s dress rehearsal for the general election.\n\nSince then, the central bank has spent more than $4.5 billion in reserves to prop up the peso, which has nonetheless lost 23.6% against the greenback during the same period.", "description": "Argentina's battered peso weakened another 1.34% on Thursday, even after the central bank sold $346 million in reserves to ease its fall three days ahead of a presidential election that has increased uncertainty over the inflation-racked economy.", "authors": ["Hugh Bronstein", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444660882&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N247", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
