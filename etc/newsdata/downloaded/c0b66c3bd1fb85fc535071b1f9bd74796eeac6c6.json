Under the iron rule of its former chairman, Roger Ailes, overt conflict between hosts was quickly snuffed out. That Mr. Carlson and Mr. Smith traded jabs over 36 hours suggested that the Ailes style of harsh discipline had eroded at the network.\n\nEarlier in the week, an episode of the talk show \u201cThe Five\u201d deteriorated after the liberal pundit Juan Williams suggested that his conservative co-hosts were echoing talking points from the White House. \u201cAsking a foreign government to investigate a political rival is illegal,\u201d Mr. Williams said, before his colleagues angrily shouted him down.\n\n\u201cYou get that from Media Matters, Juan?\u201d one co-host, Greg Gutfeld, said in an angered tone, referring to an advocacy group that regularly denigrates Fox News. Even by the standards of \u201cThe Five,\u201d it was a stinging exchange.\n\nMr. Wallace, in his appearances Friday on Fox News, offered a grim analysis of Mr. Trump\u2019s political standing, even as he made clear he did not view impeachment as inevitable. But he swatted down some of his colleagues\u2019 suggestions that the whistle-blower\u2019s complaint contained little of note.\n\n\u201cTo dismiss this as a political hack seems to be an effort by the president\u2019s defenders to make nothing out of something, and there is something here,\u201d Mr. Wallace said.\n\nAt one point, the news anchor Sandra Smith challenged Mr. Wallace, saying that she did not see a clear offer of quid pro quo \u2014 \u201cthe exchange of something for value\u201d \u2014 in the rough transcript of Mr. Trump\u2019s call.\n\nMr. Wallace arched a brow. \u201cYou don\u2019t think that dirt on Joe Biden and Joe Biden\u2019s son would be of value?\u201d he asked.", "description": "As Tucker Carlson and Shepard Smith go public with a feud over President Trump\u2019s latest troubles, Sean Hannity rides high in the ratings.", "authors": ["Michael M.
