Authorities conducted no interviews to learn why a whistleblower took the extraordinary step of taking his concern to the inspector general for the nation's intelligence agencies.\n\nStunning rebuke: Government watchdogs criticize DOJ's handling of whistleblower letter\n\nAnd it took only a few weeks for prosecutors to conclude there was no violation of campaign finance law.\n\nYet in the month since that decision was made public, a fast-moving House impeachment inquiry and a separate criminal investigation raise serious questions about the Justice Department\u2019s assessment of the president\u2019s conduct.\n\n\"In hindsight, the decision by prosecutors was premature and ill-advised,\" Richard Ben-Veniste, one of the Watergate prosecutors, said. \"The information provided by the whistleblower cried out for further inquiry.\"\n\nJustice Department officials say Attorney General William Barr, whose assistance Trump offered to Zelensky, was not the one who decided to decline an investigation.\n\nRussia probe: DOJ inquiry into origins of Russia investigation has shifted to criminal probe\n\nBut lawmakers and former prosecutors say his close relationship with Trump threatens the department's independence as the president faces his greatest threat yet.\n\nThose suspicions are likely to deepen after news broke Thursday night that the Justice Department has shifted an internal examination into the origins of the Russia investigation \u2013 which Trump often disparages as a \"witch hunt\" \u2013 to a criminal matter.\n\nRead the summary: President Trump's call with Ukraine president about Biden\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who is leading the impeachment inquiry, said the Justice Department\u2019s decision not to launch an investigation based on the whistleblower\u2019s complaint effectively forced Congress to look into the matter itself.\n\nIn just four weeks, House Democrats have elicited damning testimony from current and former administration officials that bolsters their central argument for removing Trump: that the White House dangled military aid and a meeting with the president in an effort to get Ukraine to investigate Biden and his son Hunter Biden.\n\n\u201cUnlike in past impeachment proceedings in which Congress had the benefit of an investigation conducted in secret by an independent prosecutor, we must conduct the initial investigation ourselves,\" Schiff said last week, referring to the Watergate investigators who pursued Richard Nixon and the Whitewater prosecutors who scrutinized Bill Clinton.\n\n\"This is the case,\" he said, \"because the Department of Justice under Bill Barr expressly declined to investigate this matter after a criminal referral had been made.\"\n\nChaotic scene: GOP protest temporarily halts impeachment deposition of Defense official Laura Cooper\n\n'I would like you to do us a favor'\n\nIt is illegal for a political candidate to solicit or receive anything of value from a foreign source. Justice officials said they decided not to move forward with a campaign finance inquiry because they concluded the president's request for an investigation had no quantifiable value. The conclusion, officials said, was rendered by Criminal Division chief Brian Benczkowski.\n\n\"The department's Criminal Division reviewed the official record of the call and determined, based on the facts and applicable law, that there was no campaign finance violation and no further action was warranted,\" the Justice Department said in a statement last month.", "description": "Testimony in the impeachment inquiry has corroborated a whistleblower's complaint and raises questions about the Justice Department's review.", "authors": ["Kevin Johnson", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/7GrguDXtsGpoA6UO6fxgtQ--~B/aD0zNTMwO3c9NTE2NztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/3b027883d02299a0dd7137264c69a275", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
