He\u2019s making quite a mess!\u201d (It was a giant baby; he was being quite messy).\n\nThe tightly choreographed scene was a demo of an iPad reboot of the classic \u201cFrogger\u201d game, which Apple was teasing as an example of its new arcade gaming platform. It was also a tidy example of just how peculiar and out of touch the company\u2019s product unveilings have become. And why Apple needs to put an end to its 90-plus minute advertising spectacles .\n\nThe evolution of the Apple keynote is understandable. Apple is a global company that changed computing by putting little ones in all our pockets. Their new phones are big deals by virtue of the fact that they\u2019ve sold more than 2.2 billion iOS devices since their debut in 2007. iPhones changed how we communicate with each other and seek information; they\u2019ve addicted us, tethering us to our jobs and helping us feel both attached to and alienated from one another. So it makes sense that we pay attention when the company dreams up a new iteration. Plus, they\u2019re exceedingly shiny and the cameras can turn any point-and-click amateur taking photos of their goofy dog (me!) into Annie Leibovitz.", "description": "The company\u2019s product launch pageant has become a parody.
