Bystanders and Hadi encourage her to stop, before the woman throws a punch at Hadi.\n\nThe woman hops off the car and enters the vehicle through the driver-side door while Hadi tries to stop her. \"Get out my car!\" he shouts, as he pulls the woman out to the ground. The woman tries punching the Uber driver \u2014 before biting him, prompting him to scream.\n\nIt's unclear what sparked the altercation. Hadi said Campbell appeared out of nowhere and randomly attacked him.\n\n\"She's acting weird, she's acting wild, and she's on the car hitting it, telling me I need to die, to kill me,\" Hadi told WAGA of the encounter. \"The pain, I said, \"God, just let her take my flesh, I don't care.
