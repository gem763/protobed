Blackstone CEO wants to make profession 'tax-exempt'", "language": "en", "text": "While some 2020 Democrats are focused on directly raising teacher\u2019s wages, another prominent U.S. businessman \u2013 who has President Trump\u2019s ear \u2013 has another plan to boost salaries in the education sector.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nBlackstone CEO Stephen Schwarzman proposed boosting teacher pay by eliminating taxes on employees in the profession during a podcast interview with Recode\u2019s Kara Swisher.\n\n\u201cI think we need to get teachers in a position where they can attract very high-quality people. One way to do that is to make teachers the only tax-exempt occupation in the United States,\u201d Schwarzman said. \u201cThat would give them a very large boost in income just the day you did it.\u201d\n\nThe CEO added that a secondary benefit of the proposal would be to add a sense of prestige back to the profession, in a bid to attract high-quality candidates.\n\nSchwarzman served as the chair of Trump\u2019s Strategic and Policy Forum before the group was dissolved. The president also reportedly regularly speaks with the Blackstone CEO.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut not everyone thinks the president should follow Schwarzman\u2019s lead on this plan.\n\nChris Edwards, director of tax policy studies at the Cato Institute and editor of www.DownsizingGovernment.org, called the proposal \u201cidiotic.\u201d\n\n\u201cPublic school teacher wages may be too low or too high depending on the state, but teachers typically receive fatter retirement benefits than workers in the private sector,\u201d Edwards told FOX Business. \u201cTrying to micromanage the economy by exempting favored professions from federal tax would be a dangerous and very unfair direction for policy. If enacted, Schwarzman\u2019s plan would create a slippery slope\u2014lobbyists for every profession would line up in Washington to get a tax exemption.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson from the National Taxpayers Union told FOX Business that the group also opposes special tax-exempt carve-outs for certain groups.\n\n\u201cNTU is dedicated to making the tax code fairer and flatter for everyone, not giving special-interest groups favorable treatment,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nAccording to the National Education Association, the starting salary for teachers is about $39,249 \u2013 and has not recovered to pre-recession levels. When adjusted for inflation, as of 2019 starting salaries have actually declined nearly 2 percent since 2017-2018.\n\nIncreasing teachers\u2019 pay has been a priority for some 2020 Democrats. California Sen. Kamala Harris has proposed boosting teacher pay by $13,500 on average. The plan also includes measures to close the teacher pay gap in every state. According to her office, the entire plan could cost $315 billion over the course of a decade.\n\nIndependent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has also proposed raising starting salaries for teachers to $60,000.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "During an interview with Recode, Stephen Schwarzman said the plan would help attract high-quality candidates.", "authors": ["Brittany De Lea"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/10/0/0/teacher.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
