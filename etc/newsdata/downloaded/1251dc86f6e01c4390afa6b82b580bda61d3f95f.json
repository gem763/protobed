He is just the latest second and third-stringer to get a shot at playing in the NFL while the former 49er sits and stews.\n\nKaepernick, the first NFL player to take a knee during the National Anthem, has now been out of the league for three years. During that time, he won a collusion case against the NFL for keeping him out of the league, spawned a protest by musicians over appearing at the Super Bowl halftime because he has been denied employment, and became the face of a Nike campaign that emphasized his rebel qualities.\n\nStill, the lure of football is something Kaepernick can\u2019t seem to shake. So his agents put out a release that includes nine questions and statistics that, they believe, shows the misinformation circulating about him. It joins the workout videos circulated on social media as part of a package to show that he remains ready and willing to take some snaps, if only given a chance.\n\nThe release:\n\nOctober 10, 2019\n\nFacts to Address the False Narratives Regarding Colin Kaepernick.\n\nThere have been so many false narratives in the media regarding Colin, we believe it is important to set the record straight, again. Nothing below is up for interpretation or debate, it\u2019s the truth and nothing else.\n\nIs Colin still able to seek employment in the NFL after he filed a grievance?\n\nYes. Eric Reid filed the same grievance and is currently employed by an NFL team.\n\nHas Colin been offered a job by an NFL team?\n\nNo, not a single team has offered Colin a job since the 2016 season, in which he began his peaceful protest.\n\nHas Colin ever had a workout with an NFL team?\n\nNo, not a single team has brought Colin in for a workout. Seattle brought Colin in for a visit but did not work him out. Afterwards, Pete Carroll said Colin is a \u201cstarter in this league.\u201d No other NFL team has interviewed or worked out Colin in the past 3 seasons, despite other false statements in the media to the contrary.\n\nHave you reached out to every team on Colin\u2019s behalf?\n\nI have reached out to all 32 teams about Colin\u2019s employment, with little to no response from teams about an opportunity for Colin. In 25 years, I have never seen anything like it.\n\nHas Colin demanded a specific salary in connection with his employment?\n\nNo, that narrative is completely false.\n\nWhat about Colin being a \u201cdistraction\u201d with the 49ers?\n\nHis coach, Chip Kelly, during the 2016 season said about Colin, \u201cHe is zero distraction.\u201d In that same 2016 season, Colin also won the Len Eshmont Award, voted on by 49er players and given to the 49er who best exemplifies inspirational and courageous play.\n\nDoes Colin still want to play?\n\nYes, he has been working out 5 days a week, for 3 years, in preparation to play again.\n\nIf Colin wants to play, why did he opt out of his 49ers contract?\n\nColin opted out after his conversation with the 49ers GM, John Lynch, who told Colin they were going to cut him and publicly stated, \u201cI don\u2019t want to characterize it as he made a decision to leave here\u2026You can opt out, we can release you.\u201d Colin opted out prior to free agency to maximize potential employment opportunities and because the 49ers would have cut him prior to the start of the 2017 season.\n\nDoes Colin fit into most teams\u2019 \u201csystem\u201d?\n\nYes. Colin played in a West Coast Offense under Jim Harbaugh, and the idea he doesn\u2019t fit a team\u2019s system does not mesh with how teams have adjusted their offensive schemes to fit the skill set of their quarterbacks. Colin has the same skill set as many of the young mobile quarterbacks flourishing in the NFL right now.\n\nIs Colin still good enough to play?\n\nLet\u2019s provide some statistics to show Colin\u2019s ability to play football at the highest level: Despite having to recover from three surgeries during 2016, Colin immediately started once healthy and was never beaten out by any other quarterback on the roster.", "description": "Colin Kaepernick is obviously growing more and more frustrated that the National Football League is ignoring him.
