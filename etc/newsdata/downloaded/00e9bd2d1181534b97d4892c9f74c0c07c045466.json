Some of the goods being transported are referred to as \u201cjust in time\u201d goods such as car parts that allow manufacturers to adapt with supply and demand needs.\n\nAnother key item transported through the port is perishable goods like fruit that depend on a timely transfer to retain freshness. But with Brexit day looming, business owners in Dover say they are concerned that any delays at the border could impact operations inside the Port.\n\nChristine Wolfe relies on the delivery of fresh flowers from Holland and Italy, and she told Euronews her entire business relies on the ability to get her stock quickly from the continent.\n\n\u201cI can add 20 red rose roses to my order coming from Holland tonight, it will be here tomorrow and we can deliver it to that shop by 6 o\u2019clock tomorrow morning. This could change,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe are having to prepare for something that may not happen. If it\u2019s a deal we will carry on doing what we are doing. If it\u2019s a no deal - I think everyone is just waiting to see what happens. It\u2019s very frustrating.\u201d\n\nThe UK government has published guidelines for businesses on what to do if the UK leaves the EU without a deal. It\u2019s spent millions of pounds preparing for Brexit. The Port of Dover says it has extra resources and made major investments itself as it understands that it has become Britain\u2019s \u201cjust in time conveyor\u201d belt.\u201d\n\nBut not all businesses are convinced. Those in the logistics industry rely on just in time goods, particularly from countries like Germany and Holland to the UK.\n\n\u201cIf every truck has to wait for clearance, say on average 5 hours, I mean you can work out how that\u2019s going to impact our industry, you know there\u2019s going to be massive delays on this side of the channel and on the other side of the channel,\u201d said Ronald Krom, a hauler from Promax Logistics.\n\n\u201cMy job totally depends on the free flow of goods import and export. If that doesn\u2019t happen anymore I\u2019m incredibly worried about losing my job,\" he said", "description": "Businesses across the United Kingdom rely on Dover to help bring fresh food and critical components into the country.
