A total of about 520,000 cars are affected.In the United States, 4.1 million vehicles are affected. The models differ slightly from Korea.The announcement comes as the group has resolved class action litigation with U.S. owners of Hyundai and Kia vehicles equipped with the Theta II GDI engine, agreeing to provide compensation. The group said the U.S. court will review the proposed settlement for preliminary approval this month.The terms of settlement include cash reimbursement of certain past repairs and related expenses such as towing cars and free installation of the knock sensor detection system software update that the carmaker says will prevent engine failures by continuously monitoring engine vibrations.The group said similar terms of compensation will be offered for both Korean and U.S. customers.The carmaker is still being investigated in criminal cases in both Korea and the United States.BY KIM JEE-HEE [kim.jeehee@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://static.joins.com/joongang_15re/profile_koreajoongangdaily_200.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
