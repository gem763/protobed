[YONHAP]\n\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong-un visited Mount Paektu atop a white horse, reported the country\u2019s state media on Wednesday in a propaganda piece suggestive of major policy changes to come.The official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) published photos of Kim mounted on a white steed, with the snowy peaks of Mount Paektu in the background, hailing his visit as \u201ca great event of weighty importance in the history of the Korean revolution.\u201dKim\u2019s visit to the mountain - a symbolic location that North Korea claims is the birthplace of Kim Jong-un\u2019s father and the regime\u2019s former dictator, Kim Jong-il - could herald a major decision in the next few weeks as a stalemate drags on in Pyongyang\u2019s denuclearization negotiations with Washington.The English-language KCNA report alluded to such a possibility, saying \u201call the officials accompanying [Kim] were convinced with overflowing emotion and joy that there will be a great operation to strike the world with wonder again.\u201dKim also took the opportunity to inspect the township in Samjiyon County, Ryanggang Province, where the mountain is located, providing field guidance to construction sites and factories in the area, another KCNA report read.During these inspections, the report read, Kim directly condemned the \u201cU.S.-led anti-DPRK hostile forces\u201d that he said were trying to \u201cstrangle us with the chain of pressure\u201d but stressed that such trials have only emboldened his people to survive.DPRK is the acronym for North Korea\u2019s official name, the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea.\u201cThat no matter what persistent efforts the enemy make, we can live well with our own efforts and pave the avenue to development and prosperity in our own way is a review of the year 2019 that has brought about a higher leap forward, miracles and feats despite trials and difficulties,\u201d Kim said with conviction, according to the report.The dictator\u2019s high profile visits to Mount Paektu in the past usually preceded key policy decisions, like in February 2013, when he discussed the country\u2019s governance with key officials before embarking on a political purge - and eventual execution - of his uncle, Jang Song-thaek.More recently, Kim returned to the mountain in December 2017, just months before he resumed diplomatic engagements with South Korea about the Winter Olympics hosted by the South. During the third inter-Korean summit last year, Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in visited Mount Paektu together.South Korean analysts noted this most recent visit coincides with what could be a time of great uncertainty for North Korea as a result of the breakdown of working-level talks with the United States earlier this month over the scope of denuclearization efforts.While Pyongyang left open room for a positive response from Washington by the end of this year, the regime\u2019s top nuclear envoy, Kim Myong-gil, and the country\u2019s Foreign Ministry also hinted that the North could withdraw its self-imposed moratorium on nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic missile tests if the United States does not relent.BY SHIM KYU-SEOK [shim.kyuseok@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://pds.joins.com/jmnet/koreajoongangdaily/_data/photo/2019/10/16195819.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
