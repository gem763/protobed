So sorry this happened to you; at our age, publicly parading in our undies is the wrong sort of thrill.\"\n\nThe telly star - who appeared in BBC show Civilisations - replied: \"my little black vest, no bra, not a good look!\"\n\nAnd she said she had told staff that she only had underwear on beneath the outfit.\n\nShe said: \"To be honest I'm not very easily humiliated, but it was a surprise! Staff polite but insistent (following instructions, I guess, don't want to get them into trouble).\"\n\nIn another tweet, she added: \"it was a definitional issue in part, though I did say that I only had undies underneath! A mistake at root, but shouldn't happen.\"\n\nBut when asked if she'd \"made a fuss\", she replied: \"I did demur!\"\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nAuthor Caroline Criado-Perez shared the academic's tweet and added: \"Sounds to me like security who don\u2019t understand women\u2019s clothes.\"\n\nDr Heather Parry added: \"Why would you want to try to humiliate Mary Beard when she is a National Treasure?\"\n\nAnd illustrator Katherine Hardy joked: \"A extremely jetlagged person we both know once caused a security alert in an airport by whipping their top off to prove there were no bombs under there to avoid an \"unnecessary\" pat down.\"\n\nOn Twitter, the airport apologised and asked for further details about the incident before telling Mirror.co.uk: \u201cOur colleagues work incredibly hard to keep Britain\u2019s skies safe and any passenger is able to be searched in private. We apologise that this did not happen in this instance.\"\n\n(Image: Corbis via Getty Images)\n\nProf Beard said she was \"tough\" and had \"no desire to see the staff concerned told off\" and so refused to release which terminal the incident occurred in.\n\nShe told Mirror.co.uk: \"My point has been made. It was no doubt a 'mistake' of some sort...and I have no interest in getting the security person into trouble, who has a tougher and less comfortable and less well paid job than I do.\"", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: The Cambridge academic said she told staff she only had underwear on underneath but that they were \"insistent\"", "authors": ["Rosaleen Fenton", "Image", "Afp Via Getty Images", "Getty Images", "Afp Getty Images", "Corbis Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20755501.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_SPAIN-ASTURIAS-AWARD.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
