We could all do with fewer lectures on \u201cgrace\u201d from the people who would dispatch federal bayonets to force septuagenarian nuns to underwrite contraception coverage in order to press a petty political advantage for no purpose other than precedent and humiliation.\n\nI will not presume to speak on behalf of the Almighty \u2014 Who has not, as a matter of fact, requested my opinion on the matter \u2014 but even taking into account that the Lord works in mysterious ways and that He seems to have a bizarre and occasionally cruel sense of humor, it is difficult to imagine an omnipotence worth having that is constrained to express itself through the instrument of Pete Buttigieg, who looked at creation and saw that it was . . . messed up.", "description": "", "authors": ["Kevin Williamson", "Nationalreview.Com Pete-Buttigieg-Democrats-Try-Coopt-Christians"], "top_image": ""}
