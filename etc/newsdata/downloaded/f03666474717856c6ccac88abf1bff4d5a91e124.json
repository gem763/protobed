Most of the outstanding audits were from public entities.\n\nThe AG audits 14 state-owned enterprises. These include national broadcaster the SABC, airlines SA Express and SAA, the Post Office, the Land Bank and Denel.\n\nThe AG does not audit Eskom, diamond miner Alexkor or the Industrial Development Corporation, as it does not have the resources to do so, Makwetu told members of Parliament. However, the AG will be deploying capacity to be the signing-off auditor for Transnet for the 2020/21 year.\n\nOutstanding audits\n\nThe AG only completed audits of 11 SOEs. The remaining three \u2013 SAA, Trans-Caledon Tunnel Authority (TCTA) and the South African Nuclear Energy Corporation (Necsa) had outstanding audits.\n\nWhile the AG expects to complete audits for Necsa and TCTA by the end of October, no timeline was given for the SAA audit.\n\nFin24 previously reported that SAA's annual financial report could not be tabled in September due to financial challenges. Makwetu cited the same reason for not being able to complete the audit.\n\nHowever, he said the bulk of the auditing had been done and about 10% of the work is outstanding.\n\nIn a statement, Scopa chairperson Mkhuleko Hlengwa said it was concerning some SOEs and government departments had not submitted their financial statements to the AG. SAA in particular had not submitted financial statements for two years, the committee heard.\n\n\"As a result of this non-submission, no auditing work has been done for 2019 at SAA due to the outstanding information. This shows the disregard of SAA for the law and sets a wrong precedence of normalising the non-submission of financial statements,\" Hlengwa said.\n\n\"Some of the reasons for outstanding audits on SOEs are because of known going concern difficulties and challenges,\" the AG's presentation to Parliament read. \"Two of the SOEs for which the audit was finalised had going concerns problems \u2013 namely Petroleum Oil and Gas Corporation of South Africa and the SA Post Office.\"\n\n\n\nGovernment exposure\n\nThe AG further unpacked that during the 2018/19 year, government guarantees amounting to R446bn were issued to 11 SOEs. This includes SOEs which are not audited by the AG.\n\n\"The total government exposure relating to these guarantees amount to R328bn,\" the AG said.\n\nThe AG noted that SOEs used the guarantees to obtain loans from lenders. \"Guarantees or bailouts for SOEs would increase the budget deficit of the fiscus, government debt and borrowing costs, and result in downgrades from rating agencies,\" the presentation read.\n\nIrregular expenditure\n\nThe report showed that irregular expenditure by the 11 audited SOEs amounted to R1.35bn. The SABC accounted for the largest amount (R351m) of irregular expenditure, followed by Airports Company South Africa and Denel.\n\nIrregular expenditure is incurred through the non-compliance of supply chain management processes, as well as payments made without following due process, Makwetu said.\n\n*This article was updated at 13:50 on Wednesday, October 23 to include remarks from Scopa.", "description": "State-owned enterprises are increasingly relying on government guarantees to secure loans, but this comes at the cost of the fiscus, the Auditor-General of South Africa has warned.", "authors": ["- Lameez Omarjee"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/6735/d6468d050e424da2a87d5c23525d44df.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
