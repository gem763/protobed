While he was serving in the navy during the war, my dad, Michael Flanders, caught polio.\n\nIt put him in a wheelchair from the age of 21, and was a large part of the reason he didn\u2019t live to see me grow up.\n\nIn many ways, my story is not that unusual. It took nearly three decades from the rollout of the first polio vaccine in the 1950s for the disease to be eradicated in the UK.\n\nFor a younger generation, polio may seem like a problem that has already been consigned to the history books. But for many of us, it isn\u2019t. Today, there are an estimated 100,000 British survivors of the disease.\n\nFor those of us who\u2019ve seen what this disease can do first-hand, the UK\u2019s global role in the fight against polio is a source of enormous pride.", "description": "Like thousands of others in the UK, my childhood was shaped by polio\u2019s legacy.", "authors": ["Stephanie Flanders", "Yuki Sugiura"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/global-health/2019/10/23/959876_AP_PHOTOS-Century-Collection-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqgW2UAm0HjlZ8ybX6umLHjwUWDw2TsedWvSpZ4pVBHoI.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
