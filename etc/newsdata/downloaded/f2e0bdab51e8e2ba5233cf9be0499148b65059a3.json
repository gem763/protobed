Housing", "language": "en", "text": "The myth that house prices were being driven by a lack of new housing supply, as opposed to investor activity fuelled by cheap finance and increasing leverage, was clearly exposed by the royal commission.\n\nAs soon as credit availability was tightened, house prices rolled over and speculative new development activity went with it. High house prices driven by investor speculation kill housing demand by driving down the household formation rate.\n\nThis impact is difficult to measure directly, but there is clear evidence in the increasing vacancy rates and weak rental growth in the market. With a solid pipeline of completions still to come, and given the amount of negative housing equity that still exists for investors and developers, it is likely to be quite a while before we see a rebound in housing construction and the risk is that it continues to decline further.\n\nThis is the real reason that the RBA is cutting rates, not some vague reference to underachieving on our employment potential.\n\nWorst still to come\n\nIt is likely to get worse from here. The time to construct high-rise apartments, where a lot of the speculative activity has occurred, is quite long, so current construction activity is still near record highs.\n\nAs new starts vanish, there will be significant employment impacts in the construction sector which could feed back into the broader economy through weaker spending. It\u2019s the RBA\u2019s hope that lower interest rates will stimulate the broader economy and absorb this weakness. We are sceptical that this will work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Australia, interest rates have stimulated mainly through increased house prices, driving wealth effects and construction activity.\n\nFirstly, we are hitting the lower bound of policy effectiveness as banks are simply unable to lower their funding costs enough to pass on all the rate cuts. Secondly, low rates need to be viewed in the context of the record high household debt that has been built up to support high house prices.\n\nThose with debt, particularly those that have found themselves with negative equity, will be more inclined to pay it down in times of uncertainty while those with assets may be cautious in spending their capital given the low rates of return available.\n\nGiven the strong rebound in cyclical stocks so far, we suggest caution owning them going forward. The housing construction stocks like CSR, Boral and Brickworks are moving into shorting territory given the likely pressure on earnings. Some of these have significant commodity exposures \u2013 like CSR to aluminium and Brickworks to coal \u2013 which also look weak.\n\nFor a building stock it\u2019s better to look further afield. We like James Hardie, which has good exposure to improving trends in US housing, a stronger structural growth story through market penetration and trades at multiples not too dissimilar to the domestic builders.\n\nSean Fenton is the managing director and portfolio manager of Sage Capital.", "description": "The myth that house prices were being driven by a lack of new housing supply was clearly exposed by the royal commission.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/a5b2c813b1c0a504a815105b3c42fc2cb06b55c1", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
