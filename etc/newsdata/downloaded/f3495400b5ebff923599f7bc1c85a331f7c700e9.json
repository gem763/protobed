Hopefully the results will be different for Game 3 of the National League Division Series at Nationals Park tonight. Don\u2019t expect any trouble from the weather for the game. Showers should hold off until tomorrow afternoon and evening, and even then it may not be enough rain to disrupt Game 4 of the NLDS, but we\u2019ll have to keep watching it as we get closer.\n\nListen to our daily D.C. forecasts: Apple Podcasts | Amazon Echo | More options\n\nThrough tonight: An elevated chance of isolated showers this evening and overnight. I expect it to remain mostly dry and just cloudy in and around the District (specifically for Game 3 at Nats Park). Mild overnight, with lows in the low to mid-60s under a south wind around 10 mph.\n\nView the current weather at The Washington Post.\n\nTomorrow (Monday): Overcast for the first part of the day, with shower chances on the rise through the afternoon. Mild, with highs in the mid-70s under a south wind at around 10 mph. The threat of scattered showers persists through the evening hours before tapering off overnight, with lows in the low to mid-60s.\n\nSee Brian Jackson\u2019s forecast through next week.
