Senior adviser Anita Dunn and deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield emailed news network executives Sunday, demanding they end existing and future plans to have Donald Trump's lawyer on air.\n\n\"While you often fact check his statements in real time during your discussions, that is no longer enough,\" they wrote to CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN and Fox News. \"By giving him your air time, you are allowing him to introduce increasingly unhinged, unfounded and desperate lies into the national conversation.\"\n\nThe campaign leaders cited recent coverage of Hunter Biden's business in the Ukraine and China as one of the reasons for keeping the lawyer and former mayor of New York off air. In an appearance on CNN last week, Giuliani said he didn't ask Ukrainian officials to investigate Joe Biden and his son for bribery and then, less than 30 seconds later, reversed himself and said \"of course I did.\"\n\nHe told \"Face The Nation\" on Sunday that the State Department was aware of his activities.\n\n\"Your obligation is to provide the American people with an informed, fact-based and responsible coverage and debate of critical issues,\" the Biden campaign wrote. \"Giving Rudy Giuliani valuable time on your air to push these lies in the first place is a disservice to your audience and a disservice to journalism.\"\n\nGiuliani commented on the email Sunday via Twitter, writing \"the Bidens are clearly rattled.\"\n\n\"Reminds me of the reaction to the corrupt pols of the 70's and 80's. They have their Dem media trying to destroy my reputation and silence me!\" he tweeted.\n\nThe Bidens are clearly rattled by the affidavit showing there is a named accuser and not an anonymous source, who is ready to testify! Reminds me of the reaction to the corrupt pols of the 70\u2019s and 80\u2019s. They have their Dem media trying to destroy my reputation and silence me! pic.twitter.com/xQ2isIPzos \u2014 Rudy Giuliani (@RudyGiuliani) September 29, 2019\n\nHe continued to tweet about the Biden campaign over the next few hours, claiming that \"the Bidens have played the influence game for years.\"", "description": "Biden's aides said having Giuliani on air is a \"disservice to journalism\"", "authors": ["Li Cohen"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/30/185188ae-f100-40d8-9aaa-2e0c0ac36d16/thumbnail/1200x630g7/749ba4894e7024d90144891d03485e0e/gettyimages-1177534504.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
