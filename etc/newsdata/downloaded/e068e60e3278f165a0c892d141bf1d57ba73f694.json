It read: \"Busch Light Supply Needs Replenished.\" The 24-year-old Iowa State Cyclones fan then listed his Venmo account for anyone who saw ESPN'S \"College Gameday\" coverage and felt inclined to donate to his plight.\n\nKing hoped for maybe a couple of dollars. Instead, he has received more than $200,000, which he announced he would donate to the University of Iowa's Stead Family Children's Hospital. He did keep enough to pay for one case of Busch Light, however.\n\n.@CarsonKing2 this is the best thing we have read all year, we\u2019re inspired.\n\n\n\nWe\u2019re going to match your donation to University of Iowa Hospitals & Clinics, and we\u2019ll throw in some of that Busch Light you were looking for. https://t.co/NPPrPp6zJg \u2014 Busch Beer (@BuschBeer) September 17, 2019\n\nThe previously humorous and now heartfelt fundraiser was backed by both Venmo and Busch, who both promised to match the donations that were sent to King \u2014meaning, University of Iowa Stead Family Children\u2019s Hospital will likely receive more than a half million dollars.\n\nWe see a lot of great stories, but this is one of our favs @CarsonKing2. Count us in for matching the donation to the hospital, too. #ftk\ud83d\udc9b@BuschBeer @CollegeGameDay https://t.co/thS8JXOXC3 \u2014 Venmo (@venmo) September 17, 2019\n\nOn Friday, Busch upped the ante once more by announcing they would not only be sending King a year's supply of Busch Light, but the limited edition cans, which won't be released to the general public, will also have a personalized design on them.\n\nHey @CarsonKing2, we said we\u2019d send you a year\u2019s worth of Busch Light, but first we had to make sure the cans were fit for a King. Let us know where to send the truck. #IowaLegend pic.twitter.com/czGBuXRE92 \u2014 Busch Beer (@BuschBeer) September 20, 2019\n\n\"Hey [Carson King,] we said we\u2019d send you a year\u2019s worth of Busch Light, but first we had to make sure the cans were fit for a King,\" the company's tweet read. \"Let us know where to send the truck.\"\n\nThe limited-edition cans feature, underneath King's visage, the words \"Iowa Legend.\"\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been great being a part of Carson\u2019s story \u2014 his incredible act of goodwill is one of the most inspiring stories we\u2019ve seen in a long time, and we\u2019re honored to be a part of it,\" Daniel Blake, a representative of Busch Light, told the Des Moines Register. \"Placing a person\u2019s face directly onto our product is something we\u2019ve never done before, but we felt we needed to create something special just for Carson. We can\u2019t wait to get these new cans over to him so he won\u2019t have to worry about running out of his Busch Light supply anytime soon.\u201d\n\nDonations can still be sent to King through Venmo to his account @Carson-King-25 until the end of the month.\n\nBusch and King did not immediately respond to Yahoo Lifestyle\u2019s requests for comment.\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "Carson King held up a poster asking for help to replenish his supply of Busch Light and listed his Venmo account.
