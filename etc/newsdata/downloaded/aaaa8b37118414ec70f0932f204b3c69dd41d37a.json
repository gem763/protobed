Joaquin Castro, his twin brother, campaign chairman and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus chair; and Texas Rep. Colin Allred, who worked under Juli\u00e1n Castro at the Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n\nBut the latest slate of endorsements includes support from current and former officials from Arizona, New Mexico, Minnesota, Texas and California, and Latino leaders from the Clinton and Obama White Houses and administrations, Nebraska, California, Minnesota and Florida.\n\nNoemi McGregor, president of the Democratic Hispanic Caucus of Florida, said she supports Castro \u201cbecause his progressive policies have reflected the priorities of the Latino community.\u201d\n\n\u201cSec. Castro understands our community\u2019s complex dynamics \u2014 we are Mexican, Cuban, Venezuelan, Puerto Rican, Central American,\u201d she said. \u201cSec. Castro has demonstrated that he\u2019s willing to address our individual needs, and not treat us as a monolithic group. We feel seen, heard, and empowered, and his candidacy will help mobilize our country\u2019s biggest voting bloc to the polls.\u201d\n\nThe Castro brothers were in New York on Sunday for the 20th Annual New Yorker Festival. They participated in a discussion with Jonathan Blitzer.\n\nCastro also recently began dispatching additional surrogates to campaign on his behalf. His mother, civil rights activist Rosie Castro, went on a solo, three-day trip through Iowa last week. His campaign manager, Maya Rupert, made stops in Las Vegas two days last week, while Joaquin Castro was there on Friday for a pride parade and other events.\n\nTuesday also represents the latest filing deadline for candidates\u2019 third-quarter fundraising reports. Castro\u2019s campaign has not said publicly how much it raised from July through September.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/af/d4/1447235049a3a210b0fc364dc820/20191014-castro-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
