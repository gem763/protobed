I kind of felt heavy [in the legs] early,\" Ahmed, who won Canada's first-ever distance medal at worlds in the 5,000 earlier in the week, told Scott Russell of CBC Sports. \"I've gotta work on my stride and learn how to run smoothly, balanced and comfortable among the [lead] pack.\n\n\"I'm not disappointed. These [worlds] have been a success already with the bronze medal. I wanted to get the gold in this one \u2026 but two years ago I was eighth and [more than 12 seconds back of winner Mo Farah's year world-leading 26:49.51]. Today, sixth, and [11 seconds off the winning time]. It's a learning curve.\n\n\"As the body adapts and gets old,\" continued Ahmed, \"I should be able to recover better, but it's another monkey off my back.

Moh doesn't have that luxury. He holds his place on the inside lane really well, keeps fighting to the end and his concentration levels seen to have improved significantly in the past four years.\"\n\nMoorcroft wondered if Ahmed is on the verge of \"something special\" in Tokyo and noted the Canadian has arrived as a serious medal contender, not just a top-five finisher.\n\n\"Medal contenders have a different mindset and aura, and I believe Moh has that,\" said Moorcroft, a two-time Commonwealth Games champion and former world-record holder in the 5,000. \"He is now not just a fast runner but also a great racer and he has to believe he can take that to the next level.\"\n\nCanada DQ'd in women's relay final\n\nCanada's Alicia Brown, Aiyanna-Brigitte Stiverne, Maddy Price and Sage Watson were disqualified for a lane infringement following their fifth-place finish in the 4x400 relay final in 3:25.91, 5-100ths of a second off their season best from Saturday's heats.\n\nSimon Nathan, high performance director with Athletics Canada, contested the ruling but after official review by the International Association of Athletics Federations, the Canadians were penalized for the lane violation on the first exchange between Brown and Stiverne.\n\nFrom left, Canada's Alicia Brown, Aiyanna-Brigitte Stiverne, Maddy Price and Sage Watson were disqualified from the women's 4x400-metre relay for a lane infringement following their fifth-place finish in 3:25.91.
