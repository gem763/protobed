(Jeenah Moon/Bloomberg)\n\nIn the wake of fierce criticism, Lyft said Tuesday it will make several changes to improve safety, including mandating driver education and adding a notification system for potentially dangerous off-track rides.\n\nLyft said in a blog it had partnered with RAINN, the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network, to add the mandatory community safety education. New drivers will take the training immediately, while existing drivers will be asked to complete it within a certain time frame.\n\nIt also added the new smart trip check-in feature, which the company promised to put in place this year. That will prompt Lyft to check in with riders and drivers to ask if they need help or even to call emergency services if there are unexplained delays with a trip.\n\n[How Lyft lost the trust of #DeleteUber women who thought it was \u2018woke\u2019]\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t take lightly any instances where someone\u2019s safety is compromised, especially in the ride-share industry, including the allegations of assault in the news last week,\u201d said Lyft President John Zimmer, in a statement on the company\u2019s website. \u201cThe onus is on all of us to learn from any incident, whether it occurs on our platform or not, and then work to help prevent them.\u201d\n\nThe changes come about a month after The Washington Post reported on allegations of serious safety lapses at Lyft, where victims called for changes such as improved driver training and better avenues for receiving help. Many critics have said that despite Lyft\u2019s reputation as a friendlier and more socially conscious ride, it has lagged on improving safety features compared with rival Uber.\n\nLyft has also faced additional scrutiny in the form of lawsuits. Attorneys in San Francisco announced last week they had filed a lawsuit in San Francisco Superior Court on behalf of 14 people who alleged they were raped or sexually assaulted while riding on Lyft. The suit alleged Lyft allowed \u201cknown sexual predators\u201d to transport passengers on the platform and covered up sexual assault complaints in multiple locations.\n\n[Lyft outlines all the reasons ridesharing could fail, in its IPO documents]\n\nIn a statement, Michael Bomberger, one of the attorneys from law firm Estey and Bomberger who filed the cases against Lyft in San Francisco, decried the announcement as a \u201ccheap public relations stunt in response to the lawsuit we filed against them last week.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat the victims describe is terrifying and has no place in the Lyft community,\u201d said Mary Winfield, Lyft\u2019s head of trust and safety, in a statement responding to the lawsuit.\n\nLyft said it was making the additional improvements as it launched in-app 911 integration, a feature informally known as a \u201cpanic button\u201d that allows riders and drivers to alert authorities in the event of an emergency. Lyft previously said this spring it would add that function, as well as introduce voluntary sexual harassment prevention education to its platform. Uber already has a panic button in its app.\n\n[Uber and Lyft are floating a $21 minimum wage. Critics say it\u2019s closer to $15.]\n\nLyft said it will package all of its safety features in a single location within the app. Users\u2019 location and vehicle information, such as license plate numbers, will be displayed prominently so they can inform dispatchers of the details of their trip, though the feature stops short of transmitting that information directly to dispatchers.\n\nAllison Tielking, a Stanford University senior who alleged she was sexually harassed three separate times in Lyft rides, has been pressing Lyft directly for changes. She said the steps taken by Lyft Tuesday were a \u201chuge, huge step forward.\u201d\n\n\u201cLyft seems to be listening more to these viral tweets asking for alerts in some way if you\u2019re going really off course,\u201d she said. Still, she said Lyft still needs to provide concrete data on the frequency of reports of sexual assault and harassment, something the company has pledged to release.\n\n[Your next Lyft ride may cost a little more]", "description": "The company will mandate driver safety education and use prediction to determine if riders or drivers need help.", "authors": ["Faiz Siddiqui", "San Francisco-Based Tech Reporter Covering Automation", "The Future Of Transportation", "Including Tesla", "Uber", "September At Pm", "Faiz Siddiqui Is A Reporter With The Washington Post'S Technology Team.
