(Leah Millis/Reuters)\n\nDid you notice that for the past few years, the biggest stories in American politics basically amounted to waiting for reports from law-enforcement agencies? We keep getting told that bombshells on par with Watergate are just around the corner . . . and then when the final reports arrive, the facts are more complicated and muddier than suggested and turn out to be less consequential.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust wait until the FBI completes its investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s server! Eh, James Comey said Clinton and her colleagues were \u201cextremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information\u201d but did not recommend prosecution.\n\nJust wait until Robert Mueller finishes his investigation into Trump and Russia\u2019s actions during the 2016 election! Eh, you saw what we got there. Insufficient evidence to prove criminal conspiracy, some presidential desire to impede the investigation, but not enough provable actions.\n\nJust wait until the Department of Justice Inspector General finishes its review of the FBI and its actions during the 2016 campaign! Eh, the inspector general included some criticism of Comey, but it didn\u2019t recommend any prosecution. The IG\u2019s office said it was \u201cdeeply troubled\u201d by the text messages sent by Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, but the report stated it found no evidence that their personal views influenced decisions that were made in the Clinton email investigation.\n\nJust wait until the Department of Justice Inspector General finishes the investigation into Comey\u2019s decision to keep several memos he produced as FBI director! Eh, the report criticized \u201cthe unauthorized disclosure of sensitive investigative information, obtained during the course of FBI employment, in order to achieve a personally desired outcome\u201d but did not recommend prosecution of Comey.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow we\u2019re being told to just wait until Attorney General Barr and prosecutor John Durham complete their investigation into how the investigation into Trump in 2016 began. Depending upon who you ask, this investigation is either \u201can investigation that Americans demanded,\u201d led by \u201ca man of unimpeachable character\u201d (Mark Thiessen) or a reckless exercise that \u201cendangers relationships with key U.S. allies\u201d (Sen. Mark Warner).\n\nMaybe Barr and Durham really will find something that shakes American politics to its foundation. Or maybe it will be like the inspector general\u2019s report on \u201cFast and Furious,\u201d or \u201cFitzmas,\u201d or the 9/11 Commission, or . . .", "description": "We\u2019re being told to wait until Attorney General Barr and prosecutor John Durham complete their investigation into how the investigation into Trump began.", "authors": ["Jim Geraghty", "Andrew C.
