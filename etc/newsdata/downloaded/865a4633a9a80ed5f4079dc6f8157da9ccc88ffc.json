On a list of things that Giuliani is likely to be under, federal investigation might even narrowly beat out his own cousin.\u201d (Yes, Giuliani notoriously married his second cousin.)\n\nThe federal probe is reportedly tied to two of Giuliani\u2019s associates, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, who\u2019ve been arrested and charged with illegally funneling foreign donations to political campaigns\u2014including $325,000 to a pro-Trump super PAC.\n\n\u201cOK, come on! These two men are just cartoonishly suspicious!\u201d Oliver joked of Parnas and Fruman. \u201cThey look like they\u2019re about to sell you a rocket launcher in a Grand Theft Auto game. And if that wasn\u2019t suspicious enough, they were arrested at the airport trying to fly out of the country with one-way tickets.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn any case, thanks largely to their political contributions, these two gained entry to Republican inner circles. Here is a photo that [Parnas] posted, captioned \u2018Power breakfast !!!\u2019 with Don Jr., whose very presence alone disqualifies this meal from being a \u2018power breakfast,\u2019\u201d Oliver added.\n\nParnas and Fruman also posed for a photo with President Trump and Vice President Pence at the White House. \u201cAnd it\u2019s going to be pretty difficult for Giuliani in particular to distance himself here,\u201d Oliver opined, \u201cbecause he reportedly had lunch with them just hours before they were arrested, and it is not hard to find evidence of their relationship online.\u201d The HBO host then threw to a viral online video of Parnas, Fruman, and Giuliani partying it up at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., last year.\n\nThe plot thickens. \u201cWe know Giuliani wanted career diplomat Maria Yovanovitch removed as ambassador to Ukraine because he felt she was blocking his anti-Biden campaign. Igor and Lev also wanted her gone\u2014enter [former] congressman Pete Sessions. Igor and Lev donated a bunch of money to him, and at a meeting, Parnas apparently told him the ambassador was \u2018disloyal to Trump\u2019 and that she\u2019d been \u2018bad-mouthing our president,\u2019\u201d explained Oliver.\n\nSessions, a former House Republican from Texas, subsequently wrote to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo alleging that Yovanovitch had \u201cdisdain\u201d for the president, and she was subsequently removed\u2014something that Trump brought up on his infamous phone call with the Ukrainian president, asking him to investigate the Bidens numerous times and saying Yovanovitch was \u201cbad news\u201d and \u201cgoing to go through some things.\u201d\n\n\u201cWow. That\u2019s ominous,\u201d said Oliver.\n\nAnd, when Trump was asked during a press scrum whether Giuliani was still his personal attorney, he replied, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know\u2026 he\u2019s a very good attorney, and he has been my attorney.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, that is not good, Rudy, because history suggests that sooner or later Trump will abandon him, at which point, to paraphrase his maybe client, Giuliani\u2019s going to be \u2018going through some things.\u2019\u201d", "description": "The \u201cLast Week Tonight\u201d host went over all the drama surrounding Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, who is currently under federal criminal investigation.", "authors": ["Marlow Stern", "Senior Entertainment Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_675,w_1200,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571029555/150413_ff_johnoliver_wv3yq0_qtteas_tcesbs", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
