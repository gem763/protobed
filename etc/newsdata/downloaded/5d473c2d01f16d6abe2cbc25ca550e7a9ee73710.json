Given that the woman who was said to be involved in the incident refused to be interviewed, and her friends have said she doesn\u2019t remember what happened, why did you include that accusation in the essay?\n\nDAO: The essay included a previously unreported claim that friends pushed Mr. Kavanaugh\u2019s penis into the hand of a female Yale student during a dorm party with drunken classmates. During the authors\u2019 investigation, they learned that a classmate, Max Stier, witnessed the event and later reported it to senators and to the F.B.I. The authors corroborated his story with two government officials, who said they found it credible. Based on that corroboration, we felt mentioning the claim as one part of a broader essay was warranted.", "description": "", "authors": ["Nytimes.Com Reader-Center Brett-Kavanaugh-Accusation-Yale.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
