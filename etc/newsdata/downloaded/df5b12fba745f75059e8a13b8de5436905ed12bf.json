But I certainly didn't think she'd climb that fire escape.'\n\nPaul was prompted to speak out about the affair 39 years ago after being outed as her former lover following a mention in Demi's shocking tell-all memoir, Inside Out.\n\nIn the book, Demi, 56, recalls her whirlwind marriage to Freddy which lasted until 1985.\n\nBut she admits she was unfaithful to the musician the night before they were set to say 'I do.'\n\n'The night before we got married, instead of working on my vows, I was calling a guy I'd met on a movie set,' Moore writes. 'I snuck out of my own bachelorette party and went to his apartment.'\n\nIn 1980, Ghost star Demi was still reeling from the shock suicide of her dad Danny Guynes.\n\n'Why did I do that?' Moore wrote. 'Why didn't I go and see the man I was committing to spend the rest of my life with to express my doubts? Because I couldn't face the fact that I was getting married to distract myself from grieving the death of my father. Because I felt there was no room to question what I'd already put in motion. I couldn't get out of the marriage, but I could sabotage it.'\n\nThe two met on the set of a film called Choices, where Demi played Carafotes's girlfriend. Above they are pictured together in 1980\n\nDemi (pictured right in 1982)was 18 when she was called to read lines for her part in Choices (left). Carafotes described her as 'fun and charming and she had sort of a little spunk to her'\n\nNow speaking for the first time about the steamy liaison, Paul tells DailyMailTV that Indecent Proposal actress Demi wanted a last 'hurrah' before saying her wedding vows.\n\n'It was 1980 and I had done Headin' for Broadway which was the first movie I did with Fox and then this other movie came up.\n\n'It was called Choices and I was starring in the movie and Demi came in to read to play my girlfriend. She was fun and charming and she had sort of a little spunk to her.\n\n'Demi was different from all the other girls... you could see it. She had it. You know, she had that little bit of magic and it turned out to be a lot of magic in the end.\n\n'We would rehearse. We had an affinity for each other and liked each other very much.\n\n'We laughed, had a good time and played around on the set and this developed into a relationship over a little bit of time.\n\n'And then I guess we had an affair, you know, a leading man and the young ing\u00e9nue, we were young, I was 21, she was 18.'\n\nPaul said their friendship turned romantic during long rehearsal sessions at his apartment and admits they had 'indiscretions' in his movie trailer.\n\nDemi married first husband Freddy Moore (pictured) the day after her tryst with Paul, on February 8, 1980. The couple divorced five years later\n\nCarafotes said Demi called him the night of her bachelorette party and asked to see him. The actor told her she could climb up his fire escape\n\nHe said: 'She was beautiful, she had fantastic eyes, she was adorable and fun loving and she had a spark, an energy, she was the it girl, that became obvious with what she did in her career.'\n\nBut the night of February 7, 1980 was by far the most memorable for Paul.\n\nAnd he admits he almost turned Demi down.\n\n'I had worked 18 hours, I was tired and Demi didn't work that day. I was sleeping and the phone rang. It was her and she wanted to come over and see me.\n\n'And I just said, \"Ah you know, that's probably not a great thing to do right now. I'm tired. I'm in bed.\" I hang up the phone and she called again, she was persistent.\n\n'Then I finally said, \"look, uh, if you want to come over, I'll open the kitchen window. You can climb the fire escape, I'm four flights up. If you want to do that, then you have at it.\" I went back to sleep.'\n\nIn her memoir, Inside Out, released in September, Demi admitted to being unfaithful but did not identify her lover\n\nPaul said he never expected Demi to take him up on such an unattractive offer.\n\n'The next thing I knew she was standing there with a bottle of Dom Perignon, standing over my bed saying, \"let's do this, let's party.\" I was shocked, she was wild. What's a red-blooded boy supposed to do?\n\n'I had a buddy of mine staying with me over from Boston, he woke up and he was like, \"Hey aren't you getting married tomorrow? Are you Catholic?\" She said, \"Sure. Yeah,\" and he went back to sleep.'\n\nPaul said he decided to take Demi to an apartment he had in Westwood paid for by the production company on Choices.\n\n'So we went over there and drank the champagne, had a little celebration. That's basically what happened,' he recalls.\n\n'I think she just wanted to have a last hurrah before she got married. She wanted to have some fun, she was young, she was a kid. Maybe she wanted a last throw down and then she was going to be the good Catholic girl, I don't know.\n\n'We probably should have done something differently, but you're young, excited, making a movie, you're in Hollywood, people are partying having a good time.\n\n'The next morning I woke her up and said, \"hey you've got a wedding to go to\" and off she went.'\n\nDemi married rock star Freddy Moore on February 8, 1980 but the marriage lasted just five years.\n\nPaul, a veteran actor who appeared alongside Tom Cruise (pictured) in All the Right Moves, said he kept the affair a secret for years\n\nPaul was a series regular on hit CBS day time show Knots Landing. He is pictured with Dennis Quaid in an undated photo\n\nWith a wry smile Paul added: 'What can I say, she did come up the fire escape and you have to admit, not many get to have them come up the fire escape.'\n\nAs for whether Demi, who has long been a Hollywood A-list beauty and the envy of many leading ladies, was good in the bedroom, Paul says: 'Incredible.'\n\n'She had great hands, she had a nice touch, beautiful girl, she was fun, she was great.'\n\nPaul says that was the last time he saw Demi romantically but they stayed friends and would run into each other from time to time over the years.\n\nHe admits he does feel a little guilty for cheating with another man's fiancee.\n\n'I care about people and you find these things out years later, it's hurtful. I probably owe him an amends, you know, I'm sorry that that happened,' he said.\n\nPaul, a veteran actor who appeared alongside Tom Cruise in All the Right Moves and with Brad Pitt in Fight Club as a well as being a series regular on hit day time show Knots Landing, said he had kept the affair under wraps for most 40 years.\n\n'But now she's got a book and she's talking about all these things that were going on in her life,' he says.\n\nThe Ghost star went on to marry Bruce Willis in 1987, but kept her first husband's last name. The pair divorced in 2000 and she married Ashton Kutcher in 2005\n\nDemi and Bruce had three children \u2014 daughters Rumer, 31, Scout, 28, and Tallulah Belle, 25\n\n'She's got the right to talk about her life like that.'\n\nAs for any regrets over letting Demi go: 'No we were living our own lives, we were busy,' he says.\n\nBut Paul says Demi, a recovering alcoholic, deserves respect for sharing the ups and downs of her life in a memoir.\n\nCarafotes is now happily married to wife Toni and the two share two kids\n\nThe actor is proud to say he's coming up to 17-years sober, something Demi has also struggled with in her life.\n\n'I commend her, she had a great career, how we handle it, that's the deal, you have to look after yourself,' he said.\n\n'Alcohol is a disease, she had it, I had it and many others had it. She's letting everybody know what the road was for her.'\n\nPaul, who most recently appeared in TV crime thriller Mindhunter, is also a talented musician and has written a line of children's story and audio books called the Adventures of Charlie Bubbles.\n\nHe lives in La Crescenta-Montrose, California with wife Toni and they share two children.\n\nAfter Demi separated from Freddy Moore in 1985, she married Die Hard star Bruce Willis in 1987 after a four-month romance.\n\nThe two had three children \u2014 daughters Rumer, 31, Scout, 28, and Tallulah Belle, 25 \u2014 and later divorced in 2000.\n\nDemi began dating actor Ashton Kutcher in 2003, and the two married in 2005.\n\nThe couple split and divorced in 2013.", "description": "Actor Paul Carafotes, 60, has spoken out after he was outed as Demi Moore's lover when she was with first husband Freddy Moore, in an exclusive interview with DailyMailTV.", "authors": ["Ryan Parry West Coast Editor For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/16/19498548-0-image-a-2_1570634995731.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
