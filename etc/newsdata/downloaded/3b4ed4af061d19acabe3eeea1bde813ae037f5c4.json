The filing of formal charges comes a month after Westminster rejected Frosh\u2019s offer of a settlement.\n\nAD\n\nThe lawsuit does not list how much the attorney general is seeking in damages, but Frosh said in an interview Wednesday that it could be millions.\n\nKushner stepped down as chief executive of Kushner Cos. in 2017 when he became a senior White House adviser. The White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn a statement Wednesday, Kushner Cos. chief executive Laurent Morali said the company was prepared to defend itself against what it called \u201cbogus allegations.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe refuse to be extorted by an ambitious Attorney General who clearly cares more about scoring political points than fighting real crime and improving the lives of the people of Maryland,\u201d Morali said.\n\nFrosh has filed or joined numerous lawsuits against the Trump administration, on issues ranging from immigration to the environment to the emoluments clause.\n\nAD\n\nBut he said it is \u201cunfounded and absurd\u201d to suggest that the suit was politically motivated.\n\n\u201cJust read the complaint,\u201d Frosh said, noting that Westminster and other parties listed in the lawsuit had chalked up hundreds of thousands of violations of Maryland\u2019s Consumer Protection Act. \u201cThis does not have to do with politics. It has to do with their treatment of their tenants.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe Kushner family has been the subject of fierce scrutiny and criticism in parts of Maryland, where it manages a wide portfolio of apartment complexes. In 2017, Baltimore County officials revealed that Kushner Cos. properties were cited for more than 200 code violations in a calendar year.\n\nThis July, when President Trump characterized Rep. Elijah E. Cummings\u2019s Baltimore-based congressional district as a \u201crodent infested mess,\u201d Baltimore County Executive John A. Olszewski Jr. called the insults \u201cironic,\u201d pointing to the allegations of neglect and disrepair at Kushner\u2019s properties.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAny practices that undermine our working families and their efforts to get ahead is unacceptable,\u201d Olszewski (D) said Wednesday. \u201cI applaud Attorney General Frosh for taking this significant legal action.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "Westminster Management engaged in \u201cunfair or deceptive\u201d practices at 17 properties, the lawsuit alleges.", "authors": ["Rebecca Tan", "Local Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/QJzPYQ51CmXWbTERyqtaCDJtu44=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/IRCT6JXVYYI6TIUFRAVI4ODKSY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
