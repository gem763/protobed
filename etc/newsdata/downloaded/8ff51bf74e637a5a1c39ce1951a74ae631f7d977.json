There\u2019s still a mess of teams vying for supremacy in their respective divisions, though the picture is starting to clarify somewhat.\n\nHere are the winners and losers across the NFL from Week 5.\n\nBUT FIRST, 4TH & MONDAY:Get all the NFL commentary and news in our football newsletter\n\nWINNERS\n\nColts' O-line: One week after falling to the Raiders in a disappointing loss, Indy pulled off the huge upset, 19-13 against the Chiefs. Perhaps Indianapolis benefited from the Chiefs being banged up and losing defensive tackle Chris Jones, but this was a victory that embodied exactly what the Colts want to be: a tough, physical team that controls the line of scrimmage. They ran for 180 yards (Marlon Mack had 132) and allowed just three hits on quarterback Jacoby Brissett. One stat that will surely get overlooked: The Colts possessed the ball for 37:15, thanks in large part to the dominance of the O-line, compared to Kansas City\u2019s mark of 22:45. In effect, they did something so many teams struggle to do. They kept Patrick Mahomes off the field.\n\nGreen Bay Packers: It seems like there\u2019s always a tension bubbling between Aaron Rodgers and his coach. But tension can be a good thing. So far in Matt LaFleur\u2019s rookie campaign as the Packers' coach, the collaboration has been positive. In a 34-24 victory on the road against the Cowboys, Green Bay raced out to a 24-0 lead and everything clicked. The running game is complementing the passing, and Rodgers is still throwing ridiculous passes.\n\nBut Green Bay\u2019s defense might be why the Packers are 4-1 and looking like NFC contenders. It forced Dak Prescott to throw three picks and sacked him three times. And when adversity hit and when the Cowboys launched a comeback attempt in the second half, the Pack made enough plays to stay on top.\n\nPatriots' defense: The stats from New England\u2019s five games are impressive for the defense, and they only got better after the Patriots toppled the Redskins 33-7. New England is allowing opposing teams to score just 6.8 points per game, which would set an NFL record. The 2000 Ravens, by comparison, set the mark at 10.3. The Patriots certainly the beneficiaries of a favorable early schedule. Four of New England\u2019s five opponents have combined for a 1-17 record. The other was the 4-1 Bills, who average just 18 points per game. Still, the Patriots have the makings of a very good unit. They clamp down in the secondary and allow an NFL-best 160.4 passing yards per game. They\u2019re stingy in the rushing game, ranking fourth with only 78 yards per game. They force turnovers, tied for first in the league with 12. They\u2019re the best third-down defense (12.2%). A regression is to be expected as the season progresses and as the schedule intensifies, but New England clearly has the pieces for its defense to be a strength in its quest for another Super Bowl title.\n\nTeddy Bridgewater: In a 31-24 Saints victory against the Buccaneers, Bridgewater didn\u2019t play like the guy who\u2019s backing up starter Drew Brees as he heals from a thumb injury. He played like a starter. For the first time since Week 14 of 2015, Bridgewater threw for 300 yards or more. He threw four touchdown passes, tying a career high. While Brees unquestionably will get his job back when healthy, Bridgewater provides an invaluable resource for New Orleans, which looks like a legitimate Super Bowl contender. He could\u2019ve signed elsewhere this offseason in search of a starting job, but he opted to return to New Orleans. Bridgewater, however, will be an unrestricted free agent at the end of this season. And there\u2019s nothing better for a backup passer to swell his value on the market than to play efficiently and effectively.\n\nChristian McCaffrey: You can make the argument that right now, there is no multipurpose weapon in the NFL better than McCaffrey. The Panthers' running back bolstered his argument further by racking up 237 yards from scrimmage and three total touchdowns in a 34-27 victory against the Jaguars. He has registered two of the three longest rushes in Panthers' franchise history, and both of them came this year. He had an 84-yard score against the Jags and a 76-yard touchdown Week 3 against the Cardinals. He leads the league with 866 yards from scrimmage. Carolina might want to monitor his usage, but that\u2019s hard to do, considering he\u2019s one of the rare players who can score literally any time he touches the ball.\n\nNFL WEEK 5:32 things we learned\n\nPACKERS DEFENSE:Cowboys' Ezekeil Elliott, Dak Prescott held in check after focusing on fundamentals\n\nLOSERS\n\nDan Quinn: It\u2019s no wonder why Quinn is on the hot seat. The Falcons' roster is loaded with talent \u2014 many players from the team that got to the Super Bowl just three seasons ago. That\u2019s why Atlanta\u2019s 53-32 loss against the Texans is basically inexcusable. Texans quarterback Deshaun Watson went off, completing 28 of 33 passes for 426 yards and five touchdowns. Receiver Will Fuller had 217 yards and three scores. Texans players looked like they had grease on their uniforms and slipped off of tacklers. Gaps in Atlanta\u2019s zone defense were far too big. This is all the more concerning, considering that Quinn is a defensive specialist. Owner Arthur Blank said he\u2019s not considering a coaching change. More performances like this could change things.\n\nAdam Gase/New York Jets/Luke Falk: They\u2019re all losers. Each and every one of them. Sure, Gase, the head coach of the Jets, is in a tough spot with starter Sam Darnold still recovering from mono, meaning he\u2019s down to Luke Falk, the third-string quarterback. But with Gase\u2019s uninspired and stale play calling, and with his decision to reportedly give Falk just one day of practice with the first team, the entire operation \u2014 especially Falk \u2014 was set up to fail. The Jets lost to the Eagles 31-6, and Falk was sacked 10 times behind a porous offensive line. They scored just their second offensive touchdown of the season. That was New York\u2019s fourth game. The Jets are 0-4.\n\nCairo Santos: The Tennessee Titans lost to the Buffalo Bills 14-7, and the biggest reason was Santos, the placekicker. He went 0-for-4 in field goal tries, tying the worst performance in a game since the NFL-AFL merger in 1970. The misses were of 50, 36, and 53 yards. A 33-yard try was also blocked. Had he gone just 75%, Tennessee would\u2019ve won. Don\u2019t be surprised if coach Matt Vrabel brings in some competition this week.\n\nKhalil Mack: Perhaps the revenge angle was overplayed, but there\u2019s no way Mack is leaving London in a good place. His Bears lost 24-21 to his former squad, the Raiders. By the second quarter, the Bears had allowed 94 rushing yards \u2014 more than they had given up in any entire game this season (90). Oakland finished with 169 rushing yards, many of them gained by rushing at where Mack was lined up. Mack registered three tackles, but only one QB hurry, and recovered a fumble during a quiet day. Oakland, on the other hand, sacked Bears passer Chase Daniel four times. Making matters worse, the Bears were in an early 17-point hole and marched back to take the lead, only to relinquish it late and lose.\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Lorenzo Reyes on Twitter @LorenzoGReyes.\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.
