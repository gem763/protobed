After Victoria\u2019s revelation, Robert is unable to process what he\u2019s learned\u201a knowing that this new development could mean he\u2019ll be charged with murder.\n\nAmid all of the confusion, Liv (Isobel Steele) suggests that Robert not only goes on the run, but that he takes Aaron with him. After some discussion, Robert and Aaron agree to do just that, but \u2014 upon coming to such a decision \u2014 they are hit by the reality of the situation, and what it means for their future.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey set off to bid farewell to their nearest and dearest, and Aaron reveals everything to Chas (Lucy Pargeter) \u2014 who\u2019s understandably distraught at the prospect of losing her son.\n\nOn Robert and Aaron\u2019s decision, Danny Miller said: \u2018The goodbyes are rushed. You can see that Aaron and Robert almost don\u2019t have time to take in the emotion due to the rush and panic. The police are essentially on their way, it\u2019s all so quick, it\u2019s a serious crime so he can\u2019t be out on bail.\u2019\n\n\u2018They both say their individual goodbyes but I don\u2019t think they realise this could be the final time they speak to people.\u2019\n\nThe married couple bid adieu to their loved ones before driving off, ready to start their new adventure.\n\nThe question is: will they managed to evade the law?\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Will they successfully manage to evade the law though?", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/15_10_emm_robert_aaron_leave_01sssffgsffgfgfggssgsss-39bc_1569845851.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
