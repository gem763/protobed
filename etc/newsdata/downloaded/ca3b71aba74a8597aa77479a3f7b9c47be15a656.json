You've been warned!\" the house's website states.\n\nBut now McKamey Manor's radical reputation is being challenged. A Change.org petition \u2014 which calls on both the Tennesee and Alabama state senates to permanently close the attraction \u2014 has earned more than 63,000 signatures since launching five days ago.\n\nThe petition, titled \"Shut down McKamey Manor,\" claims the haunted house is actually a \"torture chamber under disguise\" that \"uses loopholes to get out of being arrested.\"\n\n\"They do screenings to find the weakest, most easily manipulated people to do the 'haunt'... McKamey Manor is a shame to all haunted houses, and needs to be shut down,\" the petition reads.\n\nFrankie Towery, who started the Change.org page, alleges that the attraction often includes waterboarding and visitors being forced to eat things, adding that attendees have even reportedly been injected with drugs in order to cause hallucinations.\n\n\"It's literally just a kidnapping and torture house,\" the petition's description also says. \"Some people have had to seek professional psychiatric help and medical care for extensive injuries. I propose that all locations where this is happening be shut down immediately.\"\n\nMcKamey has defended his haunted house from those claims, saying the attraction is nothing more than a wild \u2014 but legal \u2014 experience.\n\n\"I\u2019m a very straight-laced conservative guy,\" KcKamey told WFLA-TV. \"But here I run this crazy haunted house that people think is this torture factory, fetish factory. All of these things that it\u2019s not, but people believe that based upon the films that I have made.\"\n\nThe owner, who claims he's never had alcohol, drugs or a cigarette in his entire life, said he films everything happening inside the house. That way, he can go back and show attendees exactly what they believe happened to them.\n\n\"You\u2019d be surprised over the years how many people have claimed something happened to them inside,\" McKamey told WFLA. \"And I need to go back and show whoever needs to see it the raw and unedited footage, saying \u2018here ya go, here\u2019s the complete show.'\"\n\nIn addition to the 40-page waiver, McKamey also requires his visitors to show proof that they are in \"excellent health,\" both mentally and physically. That also includes attendees showing proof of medical insurance and even passing a drug test.\n\nBut despite the logistics, there is no fee to enter. McKamey has five dogs, and he simply asks that any potential \"contestants\" bring him a bag of dog food \u2014 in addition to meeting his rigorous entry standards.\n\nThe petition, however, claims this is one of the \"loopholes\" the attraction uses to get away with its \"torture.\"\n\n\"People don't pay money to get in, which is technically the loophole \u2014 that they're 'doing it for fun' (and it's not fun after about 10 minutes of getting duct tape wrapped around your head, [being] forced to eat things [and getting] waterboarded and forced underwater),\" the petition states.", "description": "A haunted house that lasts 10 hours and\u00a0requires its visitors to fill out a 40-page waver is now the subject of a petition calling for its closure.", "authors": ["Dillon Thompson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/qqQK06VCJsTQ_hieS_aFUA--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMDI4O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims3/GLOB/crop/1518x996+252+176/resize/1028x675!/format/jpg/quality/85/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/d54e9610-fb30-11e9-ad3f-8708652a738d", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
