Her winning time of two hours, 32 minutes, 43 seconds was the slowest ever to win the world championships.\n\nStill, it was enough for a comfortable victory over Bahrain\u2019s defending world champion Rose Chelimo, who settled for silver crossing more than a minute adrift.\n\nNamibia\u2019s Helalia Johannes completed the podium taking the bronze.\n\nWith the first gold medal of the championships up for grabs the women stepped up to the start line ready to tackle a steamy 26.2 miles (42.195 km) floodlit course along the waterfront of Doha\u2019s famous Corniche promenade.\n\nThe race scheduled to begin one minute before midnight on Friday and finish in the early hours of Saturday saw the field head out right on the stroke of 12.\n\nThe midnight start tempered the sting of a searing sun but with that temperature sitting at 32.7C and the humidity index at 73% the conditions were right on the limit of what the IAAF said were allowable.", "description": "Kenya's Ruth Chepngetich overcame extreme heat and humidity to win the world championship midnight marathon on Friday, in a gruelling test of survival that saw nearly a third of the 70 starters fail to reach the finish line.", "authors": ["Steve Keating", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190927&t=2&i=1434711452&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8Q21J", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
