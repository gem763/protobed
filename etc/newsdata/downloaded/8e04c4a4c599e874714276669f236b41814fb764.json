That means the average benefits would go up by about $23.40 per month. That may not be good news for retirees, who face rising costs of living.", "authors": ["Lorie Konish"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/103316526-GettyImages-144560285.jpg?v=1568300581", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
