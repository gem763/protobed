But with Wednesday\u2019s plea agreement, Hayes admitted to lying to federal agents in August when he said he had never talked with the insurance commissioner about \u201cpersonnel or personnel problems\u201d or about his co-defendants Lindberg, founder and chairman of the firm Eli Global, and John Gray, a consultant.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cToday was a big step forward,\u201d Hayes\u2019s attorney Kearns Davis said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cRobin looks forward to completing this process and moving ahead.\u201d\n\nHayes still faces up to six months in prison, but the plea deal could mean that he emerges from the bribery scandal with no jail time, former FBI official and Charlotte lawyer Chris Swecker told the Charlotte Observer. Plea documents say the government intends to \u201crecommend a sentence at the low end of the applicable guideline range.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a real astute, savvy move on [Hayes\u2019s] part,\u201d Swecker said, according to the Observer.\n\nThe March indictment, which also names Eli Global executive John Palermo, describes a May 2018 phone call with Insurance Commissioner Mike Causey in which Hayes allegedly mentions millions of dollars pledged by Lindberg and Gray, along with their desired staffing change.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere were some personnel issues,\u201d Hayes told Causey, according to court documents, going on to reference a woman whom \u201cthey would like to see put back into that department to make sure that things got done that needed to get done.\u201d\n\nLindberg, Gray and Palermo still face bribery and conspiracy charges, according to the Justice Department. Their trial was set to begin Nov. 18, but attorneys for Gray and Palermo have sought a delay until February to provide more prep time for what the lawyers called an \u201cunusual and complex\u201d case, according to the Observer. The case reportedly involves more than 2 million pages of documents.\n\nHayes is a one-time gubernatorial candidate who represented North Carolina\u2019s 8th Congressional District for a decade through 2009. He chaired the state GOP from 2011 to 2013 and from 2016 to this year. His bribery indictment in spring came on the heels of another scandal for Republicans in the state: Less than two months earlier, North Carolina officials had ordered a redo of a congressional race after evidence of ballot-tampering tainted GOP candidate Mark Harris\u2019s victory.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s become clear to me that the public\u2019s confidence in the 9th District-seat general election has been undermined to an extent that a new election is warranted,\u201d Harris acknowledged at the time.\n\nHayes weighed in as GOP chairman to say that the state party backed Harris\u2019s decision to support a redo.\n\nRepublicans narrowly retained the seat in a special election last month, as new candidate Dan Bishop pulled about two percentage points ahead of his Democratic rival in a district that President Trump had won by 12 points in 2016.\n\nRead more:\n\nNorth Carolina Republicans vote to override a budget veto in half-empty Assembly during 9/11 remembrance\n\nHolder-affiliated group launches new challenge to partisan gerrymandering in North Carolina\n\nDemocrats didn\u2019t win in North Carolina\u2019s special election, but here\u2019s why they\u2019re still celebrating\n\nAD", "description": "Robert \u201cRobin\u201d Hayes\u2019s plea deal requires him to cooperate with federal prosecutors and potentially testify against three other men indicted with him in March.", "authors": ["Hannah Knowles", "General Assignment Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/RZ3zm-Q4cubOth183YUbeEYlLew=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/J3UE5XXFHEI6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg"}
