In the past week, the Wall Street Journal editorial board has blasted \u201cthe frenzy against e-cigarettes\u201d and multiple conservatives have taken aim at Trump\u2019s ban in high-profile op-eds.\n\n\u201cA ban on flavored e-cigarettes could cost Trump a second term,\u201d Paul Blair of Americans for Tax Reform argued in a Washington Examiner op-ed last week. The \u201cwell-organized vaping constituency could swing the outcome of the Electoral College one way or the other.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration on Wednesday morning invited outside conservatives to a meeting with senior officials, framed to hear out their concerns. But by Thursday morning, the meeting with conservative groups was called off, and invitees told POLITICO that they\u2019ve felt sidelined through a rapidly evolving debate \u2014 and that it\u2019s misrepresented their position.\n\nPOLITICO Pulse newsletter Get the latest on the health care fight, every weekday morning \u2014 in your inbox.

The official noted that Trump has directed the FDA to take action to protect the public health of children. Trump tweeted last week, \u201cWhile I like the Vaping alternative to Cigarettes, we need to make sure this alternative is SAFE for ALL! Let\u2019s get counterfeits off the market, and keep young children from Vaping!\"\n\nBloomberg first reported the meeting\u2019s cancellation.\n\nBeyond Thursday\u2019s canceled meeting, the Trump administration has sought to reassure vaping advocates and other potential critics by deploying top health officials \u2014 including Surgeon General Jerome Adams \u2014 to listen to their concerns over the past week, said two individuals with knowledge of the strategy. An HHS spokesperson said Adams had a number of calls with interested parties, as is common with policy rollouts. \"Those calls have been with leading health care organizations and associations that seek to advance public health and highlight the dangers tobacco products pose for our youth,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nThe vaping ban has increasingly pitted Trump's advisers in the White House \u2014 worried about alienating activists and allies who are mobilizing around the issue \u2014 against public health officials like Adams and former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, who took a hard line against teen use of e-cigarettes before stepping down in April, according to three people with knowledge of the disputes.\n\nThat fight accelerated earlier this year as health officials sought new restrictions on vaping. A February letter \u2014 signed by prominent conservatives like Grover Norquist and Ken Cuccinelli, who was subsequently tapped to serve as a top immigration adviser to the president \u2014 warned that any crackdown on e-cigarettes would hurt small businesses and hinder adults' efforts to quit traditional cigarettes. Adams also has clashed online with conservatives who say Trump's e-cigarette strategy goes too far.\n\nMeanwhile, vaping advocates and lobbyists, led by the Vapor Technology Association, swarmed Capitol Hill on Wednesday to push back against Trump's ban and possible congressional legislation. The group's representatives also met with White House officials, said one individual with knowledge of the meeting. The association didn't respond to questions about the meeting.\n\nThe shared goal of conservatives and vaping advocates: To weaken or reverse Trump's broad ban, which still needs to navigate a regulatory thicket ahead of the 2020 election.\n\n\"I think if the proposal goes out, and flavors are pulled from the market, you would see a dramatic adverse economic impact,\" said Tony Abboud, the head of the Vapor Technology Association. \"I certainly hope that will be taken into account when you have 14,000 small business owners who would be virtually eliminated overnight.\"\n\nJuul, the dominant e-cigarette manufacturer, has avoided directly lobbying the White House since Trump\u2019s ban was announced, said an official with knowledge of the company\u2019s strategy, as it weighs short-term trade-offs versus long-term strategy.\n\n\u201cThe company fully supports the flavor part of the ban,\u201d said the official, adding that the rise in teen vaping has created public health concerns and puts the entire industry at risk. But Juul is still deciding its position on Trump's call to limit menthol e-cigarettes, because menthol is available in combustible cigarettes, the official added.\n\nSarah Owermohle contributed to this report.", "description": "The Trump administration had on Wednesday morning invited outside conservatives to a meeting with senior officials, framed to hear out their concerns.", "authors": ["Daniel Lippman", "Dan Diamond"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/9d/2d/dcab36bb4d548c9a5108ee112202/19919-trump-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
