He is missed beyond measure.\n\n\"Myself and Emma were just blessed to have such a perfect little boy. It was too short but absolutely blessed to have a beautiful boy as he was.\"\n\nPathologist Doctor Srinivas Annavarapu, who deals exclusively in cases involving children, told the inquest the pea was lodged by the vocal cord and had food around it, blocking the airway.\n\nDr Annavarapu said that it would not have been possible for someone to remove the food using their fingers and confirmed paramedics would not have been able to carry out the procedure required to dislodge it.\n\n(Image: Handout)\n\nNow, Daniel and Emma are urging parents to learn CPR so they do not face the same tragedy.\n\nDaniel said: \"I just hope nobody else has to go through this again.\n\n\"If anyone could learn CPR and such do it because I never in a million years thought I would be in a position where I had to do what I had to do.\n\n\"If someone could do something to prepare themselves for it, if it ever happened to them. I can't stress enough that they should take that opportunity.\"\n\nCounty Durham and Darlington Coroner James Thompson concluded Austin's death was an accident.\n\nHe said: \"This has been a difficult case both for myself and staff dealing with it. I can't begin to think what it has been like for yourselves.\n\n\"I do hope in some small way, what you heard today gives some sort of understanding of what has happened.\"", "description": "Austin Hardman, from Durham, was at home eating sugar snap peas with his big brother, Noah, when one became lodged in his airway, before his dad Daniel desperately performed CPR", "authors": ["Kali Lindsay", "Image", "Handout"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20703955.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_KLR_NCE_221019_austin3JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
