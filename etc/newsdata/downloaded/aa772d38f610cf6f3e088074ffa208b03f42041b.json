But his mother claims this was ignored by doctors\n\nIn the summer of 2012, Ryan, from Brynithel, Blaenau Gwent, complained of a pounding headache, sore throat and aching muscles.\n\nOther symptoms which came and went over the period included projectile vomiting, difficulty walking and a rash.\n\nA welfare officer at his school, who was asked to look into his regular absences in the months leading up to his death, noted he looked 'thin, grey and gaunt' during a school meeting with his mother.\n\nThe teacher said: 'I noticed that his skin was dark. He looked Indian or Pakistani in race. There wasn't much of him.'\n\nA subsequent inquest into the boy's death in September 2017 heard Dr Rudling said Ryan's darkening skin was a sign of puberty - a claim she denied.\n\nWHAT IS ADDISON'S DISEASE? Addison's disease is a condition in which the body does not make enough of the hormone cortisol. When the body's cortisol levels drop too low, this can cause a range of symptoms. These include weakness, dizziness, fatigue and abdominal pain. A very low cortisol level can be life-threatening. This is because cortisol is vital as it helps regulate blood pressure and the immune system and it helps the body respond to stress. Addison's disease is treated with hormone replacement tablets. It is thought about 8,000 people in the UK have the illness and most cases first develop in people aged between 30 and 50. About 70 per cent of cases are thought to be caused by an autoimmune disease but it can also be triggered by TB.

This is a rare disease and one that GPs will not normally encounter.\n\n'Tragically if the condition was diagnosed its fatal outcome could have been prevented.\n\n'Unfortunately neither doctor nor parent thought it necessary to refer Ryan to hospital where the true nature of illness may have been diagnosed.'\n\nMr Bowen said Ryan's death was 'due to natural causes where the opportunity to administer lifesaving treatment was missed'.\n\nThe tribunal will take place between November 4 and 22.", "description": "Dr Joanne Rudling, from Cardiff, failed to notice 12-year-old Ryan Morse's deadly Addison's disease which darkened his skin and saw his weight dramatically drop to four stone.", "authors": ["Jack Elsom For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/11/19984408-0-image-a-6_1571653572180.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
