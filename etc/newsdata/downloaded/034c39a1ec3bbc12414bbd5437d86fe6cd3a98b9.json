He has a small twinge and we'll assess where he is a little bit later today,\" assistant coach Neal Hatley said.\n\n\"He's in really good spirits, moving well, and we expect Jack to be fit for selection as well. It's fantastic where we are - all 31 being available for selection at the end of the week.\"\n\nEngland have also been boosted by Mako Vunipola's return from the hamstring injury that limited him to 17 minutes of rugby since May 11 until he came on as a replacement against Argentina.\n\nEngland assistant coach Neal Hatley has said it is 'fantastic' to have all 31 squad players fit\n\nThe Saracens prop was promoted into the starting XV against Australia and responded with a display brimming with high work rate and key interventions.\n\n\"We were unbelievably impressed by Mako. He continues to go from strength to strength,\" Hatley said.\n\n\"And he needs to because Ellis Genge and Joe Marler have been ferocious in training and everyone's putting the pressure on.\n\n\"We've talked before about this team of 31 and everyone's doing their part but Mako, when he plays well like he did, is a real force.\n\n\"Without sounding massively blase about it, I wasn't surprised at the performance he turned in, but I can understand why people outside of our group would look at it and go 'that's a hell of a performance'.\"\n\nEngland name their team to face New Zealand on Thursday morning.", "description": "England expect to face New Zealand in Saturday's World Cup semi-final with a fully fit squad after delivering a positive bulletin on Jonny May and Jack Nowell.", "authors": ["Duncan Bech", "Pa England Rugcorrespondent"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/10/19982842-0-image-a-32_1571650031493.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
