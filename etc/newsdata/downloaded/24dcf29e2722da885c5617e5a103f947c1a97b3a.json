According to a new film and book, both called The Trayvon Hoax: Unmasking the Witness Fraud that Divided America, Fulton is also the person who knows better than anyone that the central witness in the prosecution of Zimmerman for Martin's death was not who she said she was. Joel Gilbert, the author and filmmaker, chronicles how Fulton remained silent about it as Zimmerman\u2019s life hung in the balance. And to this day, Fulton continues to cite her son\u2019s death to advance a racial narrative about the supposed targeting of innocent black men by racist whites in America. Gilbert also points out that Fulton has enjoyed monetary gains (through speaking fees, a trademark and an insurance settlement) in the process. Now she wants political power too.\n\nHillary\u2019s endorsement of Sybrina Fulton is no small thing. Rather, it is a significant piece in Hillary\u2019s long history of promoting lies, hoaxes and the odious manipulation of events in order to advance her party\u2019s political fortunes. That history ranges from Hillary\u2019s trashing of women with whom her husband had affairs or had sexually assaulted, to preposterously claiming she\u2019d come under sniper fire as First Lady while visiting Bosnia, to attempting to smear Donald Trump as an \u201cagent of Russia\u201d in her epic fail as a presidential candidate. I could go on, but we all know what a \u201ccongenital liar\u201d Hillary is, in the words of the late New York Times columnist William Safire.\n\nThe Trayvon Martin shooting was one of the most tragic events of this last decade, not simply for the young man who lost his life and the man who was wrongly charged with second-degree murder, but for our entire nation. It spawned, as the result of a deliberate plan on the part of the Obama administration, a national meme that \u201cinnocent, unarmed black men\u201d were being targeted by police officers and white males generally. The Obama administration\u2019s Department of Justice even deployed its Community Relations Service to organize and coordinate protest marches in Florida in the wake of Martin\u2019s death, in furtherance of inflaming the public, getting the Sanford, Florida police chief unjustly fired, and ensuring that Zimmerman was indicted for murder.\n\nThe new movie (see trailer here ) , does a huge service with its exhaustive investigation and detailed revelations of the gross fraud that took place. Gilbert reveals beyond any real doubt that the central witness in the case, Rachel Jeantel, was in fact an impostor. He demonstrates that Jeantel lied about being on the phone with Martin and all the events surrounding Martin\u2019s death, even eventually confessing on the witness stand that she \u201cdidn\u2019t know\u201d about the events to which she was testifying.\n\nGilbert posits that Rachel Jeantel was substituted for Trayvon\u2019s actual girlfriend and phone witness, Diamond Eugene (who appears in the movie), who wisely refused to perjure herself. Gilbert demonstrates very ably that the one person who was aware of this witness switch was Trayvon Martin\u2019s biological mother, Sybrina Fulton, now being promoted by Hillary for a seat on the Miami-Dade County Commission.\n\nTrial watchers may recall that Rachel Jeantel claimed her nickname was \u201cDiamond Eugene\u201d and that she had signed a handwritten letter to Sybrina Fulton as \"Diamond Eugene\" detailing the events just prior to Trayvon's shooting. However, Jeantel was unable to even read the letter on the witness stand, causing her credibility to unravel. Gilbert also proved with a forensic handwriting expert that Jeantel did not sign the name \"Diamond Eugene\" on the letter. It turns out the real Diamond Eugene signed it and gave it to Trayvon's mother in person, according to Sybrina Fulton's own statements to prosecutors two weeks before Rachel Jeantel appeared in the guise of \"Diamond Eugene.\"\n\nAll of this might have only made for tragi-comic legal farce if the story ended simply with Rachel shown to be a terrible witness and George Zimmerman acquitted on the murder charge, which he was. But the story didn\u2019t end there. Great havoc was wrought in our country as a direct result, according to Gilbert, because of the witness swap.\n\nBlack Lives Matter was formed in the wake of Martin\u2019s death. They would be feted by Obama at the White House and would incessantly riot and protest at any opportunity, calling for the assassination of police officers with chants like, \u201cPigs in a blanket, fry \u2018em like bacon.\u201d And every time an unarmed black man died at the hands of police, even if attempting to seize a weapon from a police officer as occurred in the case of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, riots would ensue, and the police would be demonized in the media.\n\nEventually, the \"BLM\" narratives would lead to the assassination of five Dallas police officers, ironically as those police officers were protecting BLM marchers, of all things. In New York City, two NYPD officers, Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos, would be murdered while sitting in their marked patrol car in Brooklyn by Ismaaiyl Brinsley, who claimed that he was upset by the death of Michael Brown and Eric Garner, who died while resisting arrest and whose death was in part triggered by heart disease and asthma.\n\nEven more tragically, the Obama-induced racial strife that began with the Trayvon Martin protests would lead to the \u201cFerguson Effect,\u201d which refers to increased crime and homicides, particularly in the nation\u2019s inner city black communities, as police departments pulled back from proactive policing, fearing false accusations of targeting black men.\n\nGilbert states on his website, \"No one has suffered more from The Trayvon Hoax then the black youth of America.\" He adds, \"Sybrina Fulton could have prevented all of this had she stopped the Zimmerman trial by revealing what she knew, that Rachel Jeantel was not Diamond Eugene.\"\n\nSo, true to form, Hillary is helping to promote Sybrina Fulton, who could have prevented The Trayvon Hoax train from leaving the station. Gilbert told me he believes the Democratic Party will trot out Ms. Fulton at the Democratic National Convention once again to push The Trayvon Hoax, the ongoing \"black-men-are-targeted-by-racist-whites\" narrative. Meantime, we\u2019ll undoubtedly see this become a central theme of the Democrats\u2019 2020 playbook to control 95 percent of the black vote.\n\nHillary, it\u2019s time for you to leave the good people of the United States alone. Find a beach somewhere and enjoy an undeserved, peaceful retirement.\n\nWilliam F.
