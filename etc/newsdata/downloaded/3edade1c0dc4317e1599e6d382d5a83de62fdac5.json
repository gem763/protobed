Although some searches show a brief introduction, they're not playable.\n\nOn Douban, a famous film review website in China, search results show that \"according to relevant laws, regulations and policies, search results are not displayed\".\n\nOn China's popular search engine Baidu, \"South Park\" still returns results - but most of the entries are old news. The top-ranked result criticises the show for its negative impact on teenagers.\n\nSome people have got around the ban by using \"S23E02\" (Season 23, Episode 2) to discuss the show on Weibo.\n\nHow did South Park's makers respond?\n\nOn Twitter, the show's writers Trey Parker and Matt Stone issued an \"official apology to China\".\n\n\"Like the NBA [National Basketball Association], we welcome the Chinese censors into our homes and into our hearts,\" it said.\n\n\"We too love money more than freedom and democracy. Xi doesn't look just like Winnie the Pooh at all.\n\n\"Long live the Great Communist Party of China! May this autumn's sorghum [a cereal crop] harvest be bountiful! We good now China?\"\n\nThe NBA reference follows US basketball coach Daryl Morey backtracking after tweeting support for the Hong Kong protesters.\n\nMr Morey's tweet led to his team, the Houston Rockets, having their games pulled from Chinese TV, as well as Chinese sponsors withdrawing support.\n\nThe NBA said Mr Morey's comments were \"regrettable\", while Rockets player James Harden said: \"We apologise. We love China.\"\n\nMr Morey later said: \"I have had a lot of opportunity since that tweet to hear and consider other perspectives.\"\n\nHow much does China censor?\n\nTwitter and Facebook are not available to most users, Google is blocked, while in May, Wikipedia announced all versions of its site were also unavailable.\n\nChina's internet operates something like an intranet where only information deemed appropriate is freely available - often referred to as the Great Firewall of China.\n\nChinese newspapers and TV are under Communist Party control, while certain words and phrases are censored on Chinese social media.\n\nReports from the Hong Kong protests have been limited, while people can be banned for discussing sensitive issues.\n\n\"A friend of mine just got his WeChat [a Chinese messaging platform] account blocked for three days after he had a conversation with his friend talking about China's legal system, and reform of the legal system,\" Chinese journalist Karoline Kan told the BBC in September.", "description": "The show was largely scrubbed from the Chinese internet after an episode called \"Band in China\".", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/3A56/production/_109143941_southparktoys.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
