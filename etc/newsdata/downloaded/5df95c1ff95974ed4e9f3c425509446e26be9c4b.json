REUTERS/Mohamed Nureldin Abdallah\n\nFaisal Saleh told reporters after the cabinet\u2019s first meeting that Hamdok, in his first foreign visit, would join five members of the ruling sovereign council in the South Sudanese capital Juba on Thursday.\n\nSudan\u2019s transitional government has made peacemaking with rebels fighting Khartoum one of its main priorities as it is a key condition for the country\u2019s removal from the United States\u2019s sponsors of terrorism list.\n\nThousands of people have been killed in Sudan\u2019s civil wars, including the conflict in the western Darfur region, where rebels have been fighting against then-President Omar Hassan al-Bashir\u2019s government since 2003.\n\nDarfur\u2019s war pits local rebel groups drawn largely from African farming tribes complaining about neglect against government forces in a conflict that has displaced about 2.5 million people.\n\nThe fighting in Darfur has subsided over the past four years where the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) and two factions of the Sudanese Liberation Army (SLA) are active, but skirmishes persist.\n\nJEM leader Jibril Ibrahim as well as the SLA faction headed by Minni Minawi are present at the Juba talks while Abdel Wahid el-Nur\u2019s faction is absent, officials and rebel sources said.\n\nRebels of the Sudan People\u2019s Liberation Army-North (SPLA-N) in South Kordofan and Blue Nile, two southern regions in Sudan, have largely committed to a ceasefire over the past two years. They have been fighting Khartoum\u2019s rule since ending up on the Sudanese side of the border when South Sudan seceded in 2011.\n\nBoth factions, headed by Malik Agar and Abdelaziz al-Hilu, are present at the talks.\n\nSouth Kordofan and Blue Nile are home to large communities who sided with the south during decades of civil war with Khartoum. Many say they have been marginalised by the Khartoum government since South Sudan declared independence in July under a 2005 peace deal.", "description": "New Sudan prime minister Abdalla Hamdok will head to South Sudan for peace talks between the ruling sovereign council and rebel leaders, the information minister said on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190910&t=2&i=1428338114&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF89198-OZATP", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
