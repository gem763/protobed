Advances in technology have allowed the masterful game design of these titles to shine even brighter. Arguably, no game in the series has benefited as much from a visual overhaul as the \u201cThe Legend of Zelda: Link\u2019s Awakening,\u201d which was originally released in 1993 on the Game Boy.\n\nI never played \u201cLink\u2019s Awakening\u201d when it originally came out. Back then, I was rather put off by the system\u2019s monochrome palette which looked washed out in comparison to the PC games I was into with their sumptuous, 256-color VGA graphics. This was my loss. I imagine that if I\u2019d spent time with it, I would have found in those drab visuals a compensatory vitality because \u201cLink\u2019s Awakening\u201d strikes me as a wonderful companion piece to \u201cThe Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past,\u201d probably my favorite game on the Super Nintendo. Both games ably create the illusion that one has fallen into a small, densely packed world like something out of a swaggering fairy tale.\n\n\n\nThe Legend of Zelda: Link\u2019s Awakening (Nintendo)\n\nAt the start of the updated adventure Link appears on a boat in the middle of a dark, storm-tossed sea. As he frantically tries to maintain control of his vessel, it\u2019s destroyed by lightning. Later, on a sunny day, a young girl discovers him washed up on a beach. After waking up in the home of a villager he learns that he is on Koholint Island. Though the homeowner tells him that he retrieved Link\u2019s shield, the man neglected to pick up Link\u2019s sword on account of the monsters that cropped up around it. After Link makes his way south to the beach and finds his sword, a large owl lands on a flower-decked promontory near him. Putting two and two together, the owl attributes the recent violent behavior of the monsters to Link\u2019s appearance on the island. He informs Link that the only way for him to get off the Island is to awaken the Wind Fish nestled in a large egg that rests on top of the mountain which overlooks the island. To accomplish this, Link will have to thread his way through a number of dungeons in which there are instruments capable of stirring the Wind Fish.\n\nLeaving aside for the moment the revamped visuals of the new Nintendo Switch version, \u201cLink\u2019s Awakening\u201d is a testament to how well its developers have adapted, for gaming-on-the-go, the sprawling landscapes for which Zelda is known. Though I played a lot of \u201cLink\u2019s Awakening\u201d on my TV, via the Switch\u2019s docked mode, the game feels particularly suited to handheld play because of its snug environments.\n\n\n\nThe Legend of Zelda: Link\u2019s Awakening (Nintendo)\n\nThe map, with its grass, forest, rock, desert and water regions, is geographically diverse, and these areas were obviously designed with a small screen in mind. From the trees to the houses, everything appears miniaturized and the screen is never overcrowded with enemies. Through the haze of memory, it seems to me that bosses in \u201cLink\u2019s Awakening\u201d are, generally speaking, easier than those that originated on consoles. That said, a \u201cHero\u201d difficulty level is available from the start that makes enemies deal double damage.\n\nStill, the appeal of \u201cLink\u2019s Awakening\u201d lies more in the joy of exploration than in whacking some enemy over the head or the game\u2019s writing, for that matter, which is rudimentary. Any emotional attachment to the game stems more from the act of doing than in listening to something a character says. Sitting on a log on the beach or leading a lost, friendly ghost to its home are the types of sentimental moments that punctuate the story. What makes \u201cLink\u2019s Awakening\u201d a classic is the old formula, pioneered by the Zelda series, of dropping players off in a world brimming with secrets and leaving them to puzzle out what is needed to get from one point to the next. It is as compelling today as it was more than a quarter of a century ago.\n\nUnsurprisingly given the province of its hardware, the vibrant new visuals of \u201cLink\u2019s Awakening\u201d boast more details than \u201cA Link Between Worlds\u201d \u2014 the 3DS spiritual successor to A \u201cLink to the Past.\u201d This is old-school Zelda the way you\u2019d like to remember it.\n\nChristopher Byrd is a Brooklyn-based writer.
