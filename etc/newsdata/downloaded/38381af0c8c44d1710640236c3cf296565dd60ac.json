(AP) - Officials say four gray wolves from Michigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula were transported for resettlement in Isle Royale National Park to help restore the predator species on the Lake Superior island chain, though one of them died shortly after arriving.\n\nThe National Park Service said Friday that Isle Royale\u2019s wolf population is now 17. It had fallen to two before the project began in 2018.\n\nOfficials plan to relocate a total of 20-30 wolves from Canada, Michigan and Minnesota to the park over several years, including the animals that have already been taken there. Wolves prey on moose that can damage the island\u2019s vegetation.\n\nSuperintendent Phyllis Green says obtaining animals from different places will prevent the inbreeding that nearly wiped out the population.\n\nThe newest wolves - two males and two females - were flown in Sept. 13.\n\nOne female died shortly afterward. A necropsy is planned but Green says the relocation is stressful for wolves.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Officials say four gray wolves from Michigan's Upper Peninsula were transported for resettlement in Isle Royale National Park to help restore the predator species on the Lake Superior island chain, though one of them died shortly after arriving.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
