The luxury property has been one of the city\u2019s premier hotels since opening in 2008, while Westward is the face of a transition from a former entity that represented a broader range of grassroots, artisan spirits.\n\nIn April, the two built a partnership that sends tourists across the Morrison Bridge for a tour of Westward\u2019s distillery, and brings the experience together with drinks and a bottle to take home back to the hotel room along with a night\u2019s stay (and valet parking).\n\nExperiences like this one are representative of a new trend happening across the U.S.: luxury hotels working with local distilleries, breweries, and wineries to offer specialized packages purpose-built to drive new business in the most competitive sections of the hospitality market.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s mutually beneficial in the way that it highlights the craftsmanship and the artisans of our city,\u201d of the hotel and the spirit, says Westward Whiskey brand ambassador Jordan Felix.\n\nIn Burlington, Vt., Hotel Vermont\u2019s Food & Beverage director Matt Canning explains that beer tourism was a focus since opening six years ago, but they\u2019ve noticed the demand for richer experiences and elevated their offerings to meet that.\n\nThe hotel\u2019s Summer Beer Exploration package is a two-day immersion in the brewing process where guests get to be involved from step one all the way through to canning of a certain style of beer depending on what the brewers are making that day. Guests interact directly with the brewers and malters, and are served coursed meals throughout.\n\n\u201cThis is about having a unique experience with Vermont beer,\u201d Canning says. \u201cThe demand was there, and we have some guests even coming back to try the beer later on.\u201d (Participants in this package also get to take home a four-pack of their own brew.)\n\nIn Chicago, two hotels offer different approaches for enthusiasts to experience their favorite beverages.\n\n\u201c It\u2019s mutually beneficial in the way that it highlights the craftsmanship and the artisans of our city \u201d \u2014Jordan Felix\n\nThe Blackstone Hotel\u2019s Tapping the Barrel package includes a curated tour and private tasting at KOVAL Distillery and a mini bottle of the hotel\u2019s personal bourbon.\n\nWith the hotel downtown and the distillery in the north of the city, it\u2019s also a way for guests to see another part of Chicago.\n\n\u201cOur partnership with The Blackstone makes so much sense from an alignment perspective, and we can tell it\u2019s definitely sticking with people,\u201d says KOVAL PR & Communications Coordinator Abby Soler. \u201cWe\u2019re typically connecting with people from around the world who might not have gotten a chance to come and experience all that the north side of Chicago has to offer, especially if they are staying in the heart of downtown.\u201d\n\nThe Viceroy Chicago keeps the experience solely at the hotel with a private in-room tasting from Chicago Distilling. The partnership launched in 2017 and is still being developed between both the hotel and the distillery. Last month, they added a CBD element to their offering with bath bombs from California-based Kush Queen. The total package resembles more relaxation and spa-like setups than what other properties are doing.\n\nInternationally, properties are taking note of the trend and developing beverage tourism as well.\n\nEarlier this year, Edinburgh\u2019s Glasshouse launched a comprehensive package, including a seven-course whiskey tasting dinner and bespoke distillery tour (locale of the guest\u2019s choosing), following the historic property\u2019s refurbishment in 2018.\n\nAcross the channel in Ireland, Ashford Castle is opening an extremely limited run of Midleton Very Rare whiskey as part of a tasting package with glasses at US$180 each and bottles averaging more than US$1,200.\n\nIn the U.S., beverage tourism is big business. There were 1.6 million visitors to Vermont breweries in 2017, and Portland\u2019s long-lauded beer scene welcomed an estimated 19 million total visitors in 2016. Bourbon tourism in Kentucky has grown significantly as well.\n\nIt\u2019s showing no signs of slowing, and that\u2019s spurring luxury hospitality to adapt to the times.\n\n\u201cIt infiltrates [tourists] travel as they come through and they interact with it,\u201d Canning says about beer tourism, specifically. \u201cSomehow, you can\u2019t really miss it.\u201d", "description": "Luxury properties are seeing the value in catering to the desires of drink enthusiasts", "authors": ["Geoff Nudelman", "Jordan Felix"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-105355/social", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
