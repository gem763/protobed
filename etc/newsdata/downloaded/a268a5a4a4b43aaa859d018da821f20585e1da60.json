Phoenix, Las Vegas and Seattle also registered substantial growth in their black populations.\n\nMeanwhile: The nation's white population has grown only 0.1% since 2010 and is projected to decline over the next decade.\n\nThe map above appears to have large \"white\" areas where racial minorities are not highly represented. But these are small, less-populated areas where the white population is stagnating, per Frey's analysis.\n\nSince 2010, 96% of all U.S. counties saw declines in shares of white population \u2014 and those declines aren't likely to be offset by white immigration from other countries or increased U.S. birth rates going forward.\n\n\"In the next 5\u20136 years, we're going to see an actual decline in white population,\" Frey told Axios, noting the shrinking share of the white population since 2000 among children under the age of 18. \"In the next 10 years or so, the 20-something population will become minority white. It's happening from the bottom up of the age structure.\"\n\nBetween the lines: The white population's declining slice of the population pie is widely blamed for the rise of white nationalist extremism and anti-immigrant sentiment. But the demographics also show that diversity and immigration are key to future U.S. economic growth.\n\nThe bottom line: The country's rapidly changing racial makeup is exposing a growing cultural gap between generations.\n\n\"Baby boomers grew up in an era where America was mostly white, and the biggest racial minority was African Americans who were still mostly segregated,\" Frey noted. \"Millennials and post-millennials are much more open to diversity and integration.\"\n\nGo deeper: Six maps that reveal America's expanding diversity (Brookings Institution)", "description": "Data shows expanding diversity will be the theme of this century's demographic shift.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/gGQEKvm6beSfX35MgllP0EgLvJY=/0x0:2400x1350/1920x1080/2019/09/11/1568222088701.png", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
