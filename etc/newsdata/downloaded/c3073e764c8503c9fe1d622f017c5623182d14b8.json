It has!\n\nThis is legal-speak for \u201cnot in the eyes of the law, pal.\u201d It means the judiciary has overruled the action and declared it null and void.\n\nHow soon will parliament be recalled?\n\nSpeaker John Bercow has said that parliament will be recalled on Wednesday morning.\n\nSadly, there will be no prime minister\u2019s questions session, as would usually take place at noon on this day. But Johnson will almost certainly face scrutiny, over both the Supreme Court judgment and his Brexit strategy. And perhaps even over whether he allocated public money to a model turned technology entrepreneur.\n\nBercow has said there would be scope for urgent questions, ministerial statements and emergency debate applications, meaning MPs can get on with sorting Brexit.\n\nSome MPs are already in parliament taking selfies to prove a point.\n\nNOT Silenced!\n\n\n\nAn extraordinary day when parliamentary sovereignty has been upheld\n\n\n\nThe session is resumed and we need to get back to work - holding to account an Executive that is lurching ever further out of control pic.twitter.com/GbV0UeRjtt \u2014 Caroline Lucas (@CarolineLucas) September 24, 2019\n\nJust arrived in House of Commons Speakers office thinks we will sit tomorrow at 11am. pic.twitter.com/j5ar24D82v \u2014 Barry Sheerman (@BarrySheerman) September 24, 2019\n\nDoes this mean that Boris Johnson has to resign?\n\nNot automatically, as in it was not in the judges\u2019 remit to rule on this.\n\nBut he is under serious pressure to do so and it hardly needs saying that it is an extraordinary verdict for any prime minister.\n\nJeremy Corbyn has demanded Johnson stand down, telling Labour conference delegates chanting \u201cget Johnson out\u201d in Brighton that the PM should \u201cconsider his position\u201d and become \u201cthe shortest serving prime minister there has ever been\u201d.\n\n\"This is a huge victory for the rule of law and for democracy\"\n\n\n\nThe SNP's Joanna Cherry calls on PM Boris Johnson to \"have the guts for once to do the decent thing and resign\", after UK Supreme Court rules suspension of Parliament unlawfulhttps://t.co/T7ZMBpHjmE pic.twitter.com/MKWoFyNRL7 \u2014 BBC Politics (@BBCPolitics) September 24, 2019\n\nLib Dem leader Jo Swinson, Green MP Caroline Lucas and a whole host of other leading figures have said Johnson should resign.\n\nNigel Farage and other members of the Brexit Party have also called for Dominic Cummings, Johnson\u2019s most senior advisor in Number 10, to resign.\n\nLast night Johnson suggested he wouldn\u2019t resign if he lost the case, saying: \u201cI will wait and see what the justices decide, the Supreme Court decides, because as I\u2019ve said before I believe that the reasons for... wanting a Queen\u2019s speech were very good indeed.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat does it mean for Brexit?\n\nAs ever, this is the million dollar question.\n\nThere are a number of avenues MPs could choose to take.\n\nOne is that a vote of no-confidence is tabled in the prime minister.\n\nScottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeon has said the prime minister should face this if he refuses to quit.\n\nIf Johnson loses, opposition MPs could form an alternative government with Corbyn \u2014 or another figure \u2014 serving as caretaker prime minister. In all likelihood, this could mean Brexit is delayed.\n\nIf Johnson wins, however, he could continue in his efforts to strike a new deal with Brussels which could be brought before MPs sooner.\n\nIt is more likely, however, that Johnson will be forced to seek an extension.\n\nUnder the anti-no-deal act passed by MPs earlier this year, it is the law for any PM to seek an extension to Article 50 if no agreement has been agreement by parliament by mid-October.\n\nGiven this shock judgment, it seems highly unlikely Johnson will now try to flout the law or get around the act.", "description": "When will MPs be back in parliament?
