Mullarkey, for his part, rebounded in the second round, the closest of the fight. While Riddle still landed in the standup, Mullarkey implemented a successful ground game in a tossup of a round.\n\nThen came the third, one of the most memorable rounds of 2019 in all of MMA. Riddell was tired. Mullarkey was utterly exhausted. But both pushed on, and, well, we\u2019ll let the action speak for itself:\n\nThese two are in a barn burner in round 3!! #UFC243 pic.twitter.com/K4ALAZbnzz \u2014 UFC (@ufc) October 6, 2019\n\nThings somehow got even crazier in the final moments. Mullarkey, by this point, appeared to be out on his feet. Referee Marc Goddard apparently wasn\u2019t going to stop the fight for anything short of decapitation. Mullarkey sauntered on.\n\nThen came a moment that belongs on the UFC\u2019s all-time highlight reel:\n\nAfter the fight, Riddell was somehow coherent enough to give an interview.\n\n\u201cThis is the best debut I could\u2019ve ever had,\u201d Riddell said, breathing heavily. \u201cThe best crowd I\u2019ve ever been in front of. I think it\u2019s the best crowd I will ever be in front of. \u2026\n\n\u201cYeah, mate. He\u2019s pretty tough. \u2026 That definitely wasn\u2019t my best performance. I look forward to a quick turnaround, fighting again as soon as I can.\u201d\n\nWe think he should consider taking the $50,000 bonus that should be coming his way and take a little time off, but what do we know?\n\nThe Blue Corner is MMA Junkie\u2019s blog space.
