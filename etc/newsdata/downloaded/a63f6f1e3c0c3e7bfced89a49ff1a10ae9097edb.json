Were you denying climate change when you were four?'\n\n'Were you denying climate change at age four?' Rove McManus (left), 45, took a swipe at Steve Price (right), 64, over his views on the environment during a segment on Monday's The Project\n\n'Just keep drawing, smartie,' Steve responded after erupting in laughter.\n\nRove later revealed a picture he had drawn during the segment, a tap-dancing wombat.\n\nHowever the triple Gold Logie-winner could't help but take another dig at Steve, announcing on-air: 'I did Steve Price as a tap-dancing wombat.'\n\nRove held up the drawing which featured the wombat alongside a speech bubble that read: 'Slimate Change Schmimate Change!'\n\nAll in good humour: The swipe occurred after Steve criticised Rove for his childhood of TV drawings and cut-outs. Rove appeared on The Project to promote his children's picture book\n\nSteve has been vocal about climate change and the environment and during a segment on The Project in August, revealed he doesn't recycle as he thinks it's a 'waste of time'.\n\nThe shock jock said despite recently ditching plastic bags, he still isn't on board with recycling.\n\n'I don't hate recycling, I just think it's a waste of time. All that stuff gets chucked in the same hole anyway,' he said.\n\nHaving the last laugh: Rove later held up a drawing of 'Steve Price as a tap-dancing wombat' with a speech bubble that read: 'Slimate Change Schmimate Change!'\n\nAnd in July, Steve criticised the Federal Member for Warringah Zali Steggall, for making climate change the focus of her maiden speech in Parliament.\n\nIn her speech, Zali took action on climate change, saying it's 'the greatest threat to our national security, our economy, our health and our environment'.\n\nSteve said on his 2GB radio show that it's ridiculous for Zali to place so much attention on industries that are not part of the area in which she was elected.\n\n'None of that, of course, happens in Warringah. She's not speaking, in her maiden speech, about anything that affects the people that live in her area.'", "description": "Rove McManus appeared on Monday night's The Project to promote his children's picture book, Disgusting McGrossface.", "authors": ["Kristy Johnson For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/15/19398644-0-image-a-39_1570456848249.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
