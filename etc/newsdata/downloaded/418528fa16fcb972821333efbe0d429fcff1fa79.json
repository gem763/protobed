He had originally been blocked by the State Department from doing so.\n\nBut Sondland indicated in his letter to the committees that he could not hand over relevant documents and copies of text messages that had been requested by committee staff. \u201cAmbassador Sondland does not control the disposition of his documents,\u201d Sondland\u2019s attorney said in a statement.\n\nThat is the kind of information that could be pursued through the courts, but Democratic staff already have copies of text messages provided to them by Kurt Volker, former U.S. ambassador to NATO, that show Sondland offering another diplomat reassurances that Trump had not offered any quid pro quo to the Ukrainians in exchange for investigating Biden.\n\nNBC News has reported that before Sondland sent those texts denying a quid pro quo, he spoke by phone to Trump directly.\n\nPresident Trump speaks to reporters as he departs for travel to Minnesota from the South Lawn of the White House on Thursday.

And multiple interviews with knowledgeable Democratic aides revealed that there\u2019s not much appetite for slowing down the process this way.\n\nDemocrats don\u2019t feel desperate for more information, so a lack of cooperation almost certainly won\u2019t prevent Democrats from holding a vote in the full House sometime in December, as one knowledgeable source said is most likely.\n\nTrump\u2019s stonewalling might give the White House some days when Democrats are not able to fill the news cycle with new developments, creating a vacuum that Republicans can fill with their own spin. But so far, there has been no shortage of news.\n\nFor example, on Thursday, Democrats issued a subpoena to Energy Secretary Rick Perry, the same day that two men associated with Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani \u2014 and suspected of helping Giuliani and Trump in a scheme to pressure the Ukrainians \u2014 were arrested at Dulles International Airport in Virginia as they prepared to board a one-way flight to Germany.", "description": "Democrats believe they have enough evidence to impeach Trump, in the form of a whistleblower complaint and a partial transcript of a phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in which Trump asked Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son.", "authors": ["Jon Ward", "Senior Political Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/zIp_FEFOFjcGl0qa6_a5UQ--~B/aD0yOTEyO3c9NDM2ODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/982f1390-ec58-11e9-bc5b-fd2e75e05533", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
