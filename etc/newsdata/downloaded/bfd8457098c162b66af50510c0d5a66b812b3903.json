England players were racially abused when they played a Euro 2020 qualifier in Montenegro in March, for which the Montenegrin football association were fined \u20ac20,000 and ordered to play a game behind closed doors.\n\nThe crowd in the Vasil Levski national stadium a week on Monday will be down 5,000 from its 46,340 capacity because of racist incidents when the Bulgarian team played against Kosovo and the Czech Republic in June. Southgate said that the players would be made aware that it is the referee and his fellow officials\u2019 duty to react if racism is reported, with liaison between the Uefa delegate in the stands.\n\nThe three-step protocol begins with the referee stopping the game and requesting a stadium announcement warning a crowd to stop racist chanting. If he judges it necessary the referee may, in consultation with the other officials, then take the players off the pitch for a period of time.\n\nSouthgate has said in the past that he would support his players refusing to play-on if the referee did not take action but the consensus is that it is the referee\u2019s responsibility to take charge.", "description": "Gareth Southgate will brief his England players on how to react if they face racial abuse from the stands in the team\u2019s World Cup qualifier next week in Sofia, where the capacity in the Vasil Levski national stadium will be reduced because of similar previous crowd offences in June.", "authors": ["Sam Wallace", "Chief Football Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/05/TELEMMGLPICT000208925399-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqq0hXPkI_GX3QDYmEw99JfNmODXfBJNT2A-I3349gei4.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
