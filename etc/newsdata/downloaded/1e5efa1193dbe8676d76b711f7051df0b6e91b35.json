Diners eagerly ordered it on Wednesday despite the New York Times calling it overrated\n\nInside, the restaurant staff were less jovial.\n\nSome bartenders cracked jokes to burger chomping customers in high stools, feigning dismay over the Times\u2019 Pete Wills\u2019 scathing assessment of them.\n\nBut the ma\u00eetre d', somewhat jumpy amid a flurry of questions and renewed criticism, was less eager to talk about it.\n\nThe dining room\u2019s waiters were downright offended by the review.\n\nOne, who declined to be named but told DailyMail.com that he had been working there for 31 years, said: \u2018I thought it was too personal.\n\n'Lots of people come and give reviews, but none are ever like that.\u2019\n\nAnother was more stern.\n\n'It\u2019s just wrong. We\u2019ve been in business for 131 years. We have a simple menu and the best ingredients,' he said.\n\nMore fake lying news from the New York Times! It's the best steakhouse in the world! Bill Munkas, a Peter Luger cardholder who has been visiting for decades\n\nThe server, who also declined to be named, said the New York Times has done 'nothing good' for the restaurant in 50 years.\n\nManagement wouldn\u2019t be interviewed and owner Jody Storch did not return requests for comment.\n\nBut satisfied diners heaped praise on both the food and service as they left the restaurant.\n\nDoorman Anil Gurung said the restaurant was just as busy on Wednesday as any other day\n\nOne was a retired NYPD cop who did not wish to go on camera but enthusiastically told DailyMail.com he had come for lunch on Wednesday to support the steakhouse where he\u2019s dined since the 1980s.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve got some news - this place is great!\u2019 he yelled as he made his way to his car.\n\nHe was not the only one who had come to stand behind the restaurant in the wake of the Times' rebuke.\n\nTwo friends in their thirties changed their Manhattan lunch plans to come to Luger\u2019s.\n\nMike Jones and Doug Lauretano said they wanted not only to support the restaurant, where one enjoyed birthday meals as a teenager with his parents, but to also decide for themselves if the Times review was fair. They said it wasn\u2019t.\n\nThey also questioned why Pete Wells, the food critic, ordered sole during one of the recent visits he based his negative review on.\n\nLauretano conceded that the servers were 'brusque' but said it was part of the restaurant's charm.\n\nClaudia Schnuriger, 62, a German native living in Australia who first visited the restaurant 20 years ago with her parents, had returned for a \u2018walk down memory lane. She said her burger was 'a bit dry' but that she 'probably ordered the wrong thing' and had a good experience\n\nFloyd Kephart, who has been visiting for 50 years, and his colleague Candace Rauter, who is a vegetarian and a first-time visitor, loved their lunch. Kephart said of the steep prices: 'This is New York, in case anyone hadn't noticed'. He said he paid 'no attention' to reviews\n\nBill Munkas showing off his Peter Luger credit card. He called it the 'best steakhouse in the world' and said the New York Times is 'fake news'\n\nFrank Bruno with a doggy bag of steak (left) and Wakana Shima, Yeon Ji, and Nao Hemmi (right)\n\nTakashi Sai and his family squeezed in a meal at the steakhouse before returning to Japan. They said the food was 'very good'\n\n'To me, the waiter was very short and curt. That's what I expect. I think it's part of the atmosphere. There's no place like it,' he said.\n\nA Japanese family-of-four came with a recommendation from a New Yorker friend. Takashi Sai and his family, who squeezed in a final meal before flying home, said the food was \u2018very good\u2019.\n\nIt was a similar story among a group of women from Florida who said that while their meal was expensive, the food was \u2018amazing.\u2019\n\n'It was our very first time. It was amazing! Just amazing. I had t-bone steak. It was so nice.\n\n'We lined up this morning for a reservation,' Wakana Shima said.\n\nOnly one person had anything remotely negative to say.\n\nClaudia Schnuriger, 62, a German native living in Australia who first visited the restaurant 20 years ago with her parents, had returned for a \u2018walk down memory lane.\u2019\n\nShe tried to get an evening reservation earlier in the week but was told she had \u2018no chance\u2019 so came back for lunch and had an underwhelming burger.\n\n\u2018It was a bit dry,\u2019 she said, adding that she \u2018probably ordered the wrong thing\u2019 and should have had a steak.\n\nBill Munkas, who said he\u2019d been coming for \u2018decades\u2019, proudly produced his Peter Luger credit card.\n\n'More fake lying news from the New York Times! It's the best steakhouse in the world!\n\n'It's only one man's opinion. Come here try the steak for yourself if you can get in,' he he said of Wells' review.\n\nJack Bruno, 35, who was also in his party, echoed his praise, as did Candace Rauter, a vegetarian who had come for the first time with a more seasoned colleague and enjoyed the spinach, broccoli and a baked potato.\n\nWednesday's lunch crowd was a mix of tourists, loyal locals and businessmen and women. They were all stunned by the bad review and had only good things to say about the food and service\n\nA few lone diners occupied high stools at the bar. There, bartenders feigned dismay over the New York Times review\n\nThe wall of positive reviews and commendations along the wall in the restaurant's entryway\n\n'I thought it was great I thought the service was really good and the food was very tasty. I had some of the spinach and the broccoli and baked potato. I loved it!' she said.\n\nFloyd Kephart has been visiting for 50 years.\n\n'This place has been here longer than I have. The fact of the matter is, if you go back through the years, you'll always find some negative things.\n\nNew York Times food critic Pete Wells\n\n'It's kind of like movies - I pay no attention to reviews,' he said.\n\nOf the steep prices, he said: 'This is New York in case anybody hasn't noticed. The prices are the prices.'\n\nJay Donovan, who has been visiting since the 70s, said it hadn't changed.\n\n'It's always great,' he said, adding: 'It's a plain old steakhouse, the way steakhouses used to be.'\n\nIn his review, Wells said the restaurant had gone downhill over the years.\n\nHe said the staff were unpleasant and that the food was often unevenly cooked.\n\nIt made paying such high prices as $104 for steak for two and $6.95 for a single slice of bacon painful, he said.\n\n'What gnaws at me every time I eat a Luger porterhouse is the realization that it\u2019s just another steak, and far from the best New York has to offer,' he wrote.\n\nTwitter users sprang into action to claim they shared Wells' opinion. They called it 'long overdue'.\n\nStorch told The New York Post in response: 'We know who we are and have always been. The best steak you can eat. Not the latest kale salad.'", "description": "Peter Luger steakhouse in Brooklyn was busy when DailyMail.com visited on Wednesday lunchtime, a day after the New York Times' scathing review which accused it of being overpriced and overrated.", "authors": ["Jennifer Smith For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/21/20395070-0-image-a-34_1572471252213.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
