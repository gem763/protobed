U.S. gold futures GCv1 edged 0.3% higher to $1,495.40.\n\nThe U.S. central bank is set to share the statement of a\n\ntwo-day monetary policy meeting at 1800 GMT. Investors expect\n\nthe Fed to lower rates by a quarter of a percentage point for a\n\nthird time this year. FEDWATCH\n\n\"If the Fed signals a hawkish cut, that could spell more\n\ndollar strength in the near term and could suppress gold\n\nprices,\" said FXTM market analyst Han Tan.\n\n\"However, if Fed Chair Jerome Powell still has cognisance of\n\nthe downside risks to the U.S. economy, of the economic\n\nheadwinds, and he believes the door is wide open for more rate\n\ncuts going to 2020, then you could see some dollar weakness in\n\nthe near term.\"\n\nA weaker greenback makes dollar-denominated gold cheaper for\n\nholders of other currencies.\n\nSupporting gold, a rally in global shares stalled on worries\n\nthat a Phase 1 trade deal between the United States and China\n\ncould be delayed, after a U.S. administration official said an\n\nagreement might not be completed in time for signing in Chile\n\nnext month. MKTS/GLOB \"The demand for bullion will remain intact because the\n\n'Phase 1' trade deal doesn't dismantle existing tariffs ... so,\n\ngiven the deteriorating economic conditions and the swelling\n\nconcerns over the global economic outlook, safe-haven assets\n\nlike gold will remain supported going into 2020,\" said FXTM'S\n\nTan.\n\nData released on Tuesday showed U.S. consumer confidence\n\nfell for a third straight month in October, further helping\n\ngold. Technically, \"we would have a first bearish signal only\n\nbelow $1,480, while a rebound above $1,500 could open space for\n\nanother recovery to $1,520\", ActivTrades' chief analyst Carlo\n\nAlberto De Casa said in a note.\n\n\"As long as prices can remain above $1,460-$1,470, the main\n\ntrend remains positive, despite the recent weakness,\" he added.\n\nInvestors also kept a close watch on Brexit developments,\n\nwith Britain set to hold a December election after Prime\n\nMinister Boris Johnson won approval from parliament for an early\n\nballot. Elsewhere, silver rose 0.8% to $17.94 an ounce,\n\nplatinum XPT= was up 0.2% at $922.02 and palladium XPD=\n\ngained 0.4% to $1,788.26.\n\n\n\n", "description": "PRECIOUS-Gold firms as investors await Fed verdict", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/gold_4_800x533_L_1412670524.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
