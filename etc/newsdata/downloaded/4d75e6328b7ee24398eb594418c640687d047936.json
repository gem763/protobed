Meanwhile, the Titan XD sort-of-heavy duty model is being discontinued.\n\nOffered in five trim levels with either 4x2 or 4x4 drivetrains, the Titan features refreshed exterior styling inspired by Nissan\u2019s Titan Warrior concept of several years ago, with new grille and headlight designs. The interior gets a few minor tweaks plus an optional 9-inch touchscreen for the infotainment system, which is equipped with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration.\n\nAll Titans come standard with Nissan\u2019s Safety Shield 360 driver assist system, which includes automatic emergency brakes and lane departure warning. Adaptive cruise control and a birds-eye-view camera system can be found on the options list.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nPricing and fuel economy for the 2020 Titan will be released closer to when it goes on sale early next year.", "description": "Nissan hopes you like V8s.", "authors": ["Gary Gastelu", "Gary Gastelu Is Foxnews.Com'S Automotive Editor.
