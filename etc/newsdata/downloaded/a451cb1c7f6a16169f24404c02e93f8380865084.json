Congress should stop it.\u201d \u2015 recalled how the president\u2019s first floating of the idea in August at the last G-7 gathering in France had initially \u201csounded like a joke.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is not a jest: It is blatant and corrupt self-dealing by the president,\u201d it wrote, adding that if hosting the summit at the president\u2019s resort did not violate the Constitution\u2019s emoluments clause \u201cthen nothing does.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt the start of his term, Mr. Trump promised to insulate himself from the business operations from which he would continue to profit,\u201d the board concluded the piece. \u201cNow he is doing just the opposite: using his office to drive millions of dollars in revenue to a faltering property that is a critical component of his company\u2019s portfolio. Will Congress really tolerate such crude corruption? It shouldn\u2019t.\u201d", "description": "\"It is blatant and corrupt self-dealing by the president,\" the newspaper's board wrote in a new opinion piece.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5daaac02210000701734a6e6.jpeg?cache=gjmyexmwpn&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
