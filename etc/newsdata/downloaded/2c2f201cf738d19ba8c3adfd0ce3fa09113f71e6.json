John Kennedy (R-La.) said Wednesday that he\u2019s not inclined to support President Donald Trump\u2019s judicial nominee Steven Menashi, a major blow for an already controversial court pick with strong opposition from progressive groups.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m real doubtful,\u201d Kennedy, who is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, told HuffPost. \u201cMy thought is, look, if he\u2019ll treat a United States senator the way he treated us, I wonder how he would treat the people.\u201d\n\nKennedy said he was \u201cvery annoyed\u201d by Menashi\u2019s performance in his confirmation hearing last week, where he visibly angered Republicans and Democrats by refusing to provide details about what he\u2019s worked on in his current role as a White House legal adviser (yes, Trump nominated one of his own aides to be a federal judge).\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know enough about him to be able to say he\u2019d be a good judge. And that was the whole point of having a hearing,\u201d Kennedy said Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019m tired of it. He should answer the questions.\u201d\n\nThe Louisiana Republican said after the hearing, he asked Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), the chairman, to bring Menashi back in for another hearing so senators could have a \u201csecond shot at it.\u201d It\u2019s not clear if Graham supports doing so.\n\nWhen asked for comment last Friday, a Graham spokesman wouldn\u2019t say either way how the senator is feeling about Menashi.\n\nMenashi, Trump\u2019s choice for a lifetime seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New York, doesn\u2019t have support from either of his home-state senators. Progressive groups are trying to sink his nomination because of his long record of opposing and undermining equality for communities of color, women and LGBTQ people. Protesters showed up outside of his hearing last week and got arrested for loudly chanting \u201cTitle IX is on the line,\u201d a reference to Menashi serving as legal counsel to Education Secretary Betsy DeVos when she rolled back Title IX protections for survivors of sexual assault on campuses.\n\nProtesters just erupted into loud shouting: \"Title IX is on the line! Title IX is on the line!\"\n\n\n\nThey can definitely hear this in the hearing. pic.twitter.com/y9Q6bkikOe \u2014 Jennifer Bendery (@jbendery) September 11, 2019\n\nAs CNN first reported, Menashi, 40, has complained about \u201cgynocentrists\u201d participating in Take Back the Night marches, accused the Human Rights Campaign of having \u201cincessantly exploited the slaying of Matthew Shepard\u201d for political benefit, and claimed that a Dartmouth fraternity wasn\u2019t being racist when it held a \u201cghetto party\u201d attended by white partygoers wearing Afro wigs and carrying toy guns.\n\nHe has also denounced women\u2019s marches as sexual assault, opposed the \u201cradical abortion rights advocated by campus feminists and codified in Roe v. Wade,\u201d and spread the Islamophobic myth that Gen. John Pershing executed Muslim prisoners in the Philippines in 1913 with bullets dipped in pig fat.\n\nAsked about the Pershing article in his confirmation hearing, Menashi said he wrote it 20 years ago (he was a public affairs fellow at the Hoover Institution at the time) and believed back then that the offensive anecdote was true, only to discover in later years that it was not.\n\n\u201cI regret having repeated it,\u201d he said.\n\nGraham has not yet scheduled a committee vote on Menashi.", "description": "\"If he'll treat a United States senator the way he treated us, I wonder how he would treat the people,\" said Sen.
