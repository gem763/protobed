We were competitive, the banter was great, the back and forth.'\n\nWoods got himself back into the fifth, winning two skins to move to within one of Day. On the eighth he added three more and another $40,000 to his winnings, leaving McIlroy and Matsuyama with plenty of work to do.\n\nThe moment of the day arrived on the seventh hole, however, when a quartet of retired rugby greats each teamed up with a player to show off their own swing.\n\nWoods was partnered with England hero Mike Tindall, McIlroy formed a duo with Irish legend Brian O'Driscoll and former South Africa star Bryan Habana played alongside local favourite Matsuyama.\n\nAfter a mixed bag of tee shots, Matsuyama was left lifting Habana into the air after holing a monster putt, while O'Driscoll proved his sporting talent stretches way beyond the rugby pitch after making his own birdie putt alongside McIlroy.\n\nAll four legends continued to follow the action after putting their clubs away, with O'Driscoll cheering McIlroy on to a four-skin win worth $60,000 on the 12th.\n\n'With the way the course was set up, we could fire at some pins,' McIlroy said.\n\n'It was good fun, there were probably a few holes out there where during the tournament (ZOZO Championship) this week we probably won't use a driver but it was good to get a driver in the hands and have a hit, and have a bit of fun.\n\n'It was still quite competitive out there. It was really good fun, and great to be part of something like this in Japan, a great way to kick off the week.'\n\nThere was plenty of fun had on the par-five 14th, with each player having to choose just a single club to use for the entirety of the lengthy hole.\n\nDay opted for a six iron, a decision which looked to have cost him when his third shot ended up in a greenside bunker.\n\nHowever, his incredible short game shone through and he somehow got his ball up and out of the sand before holing a short putt with the blade of the club to tie the hole.\n\nMasters champion Woods partnered former England rugby star Mike Tindall on the 7th hole\n\nFormer South Africa wing Bryan Habana shouts out 'Fore!' after hitting his tee shot on the 7th\n\nIreland icon Brian O'Driscoll (left) celebrates with Tindall after holding his putt on the 7th green\n\nHe would go on to have the last laugh after putting himself in a commanding position on the 17th, a four-skin win adding another $80,000 to his personal prize pot.\n\nWith Matsuyama on $20,000 after winning the 13th, each of the four players had a chance of finishing on top of the money leaderboard as they approached the 18th 'super skin', worth $100,000 alone.\n\nBut it was that man Day who held his nerve again, making birdie before watching Woods miss his attempt despite McIlroy and Matsuyama urging him on in the hope of going to a 19th hole.\n\n'It was great,' said Day. 'I think the back and forth was nice. Hopefully the fans all around the world enjoyed the banter.\n\n'Overall, it was a brilliant afternoon/evening. I think it's the first time I've ever finished under lights so that was exciting.\n\n'I haven't watched a skins game before! Apparently Tiger has played six skins matches himself, and he hasn't won one yet so I am one up on him which is good.\n\n'This is nice, the back and forth was great, it was clean, within the game and a lot of the guys had fun out there. Hopefully I get the invite back next year.'\n\nTiger did say skins is all about timing! Fun day out with him, Rory and Hideki in Tokyo. Hope you guys enjoyed watching something different. #TheChallengeJapanSkins @MGMJapan pic.twitter.com/Ou1XOWqa2b \u2014 Jason Day (@JDayGolf) October 21, 2019\n\nFans around the globe can watch a full replay of the event for free* by registering with GOLFTV powered by PGA TOUR (outside of the U.S.) and visiting challenge.golf.tv (https://challenge.golf.tv).\n\nDue to existing rights agreements in the UK and Ireland, fans will be required to subscribe to watch The Challenge.
