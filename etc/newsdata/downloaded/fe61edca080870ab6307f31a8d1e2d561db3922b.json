Iran said the tanker will arrive at one of its ports in about 10 days.\n\nSaudi Arabia, meanwhile, broke its silence Saturday on the incident, saying through its state-run news agency that authorities received an electronic message Friday from the captain of the Sabiti \"that the front of the vessel has been broken, resulting in an oil spill in the sea from the cargo and tanks of the vessel.\"\n\nIt said the Sabiti continued moving and turned off its electronic tracker without offering more information.\n\n\"The kingdom affirms its commitment to the security and safety of maritime navigation, as well as international agreements and norms,\" the statement on the state-run Saudi Press Agency said.\n\nAs Washington and Riyadh weigh a response to a drone-and-missile strike on the kingdom's oil industry that shook global energy markets, Iran said any attack by the U.S. or Saudi Arabia will spark an \"all-out war.\"\n\nThe attacks came after President Donald Trump's decision to unilaterally withdraw America from Tehran's nuclear deal with world powers and impose crushing sanctions targeting Iran's crude oil sales and shipments. Iranian officials warned for weeks that if they couldn't sell their oil, neither would anyone else in the region.", "description": "A senior Iranian security official said Saturday that an attack on one of the country's oil tankers won't go unpunished, the official IRNA news agency reported.
