For 2020, the economic institute slashed its growth forecast to 1.2% from 1.7%.\n\n\u201cLike an oil slick, the weakness in industry is gradually spreading to other sectors of the economy, such as logistics,\u201d said Timo Wollmershaeuser, Ifo\u2019s head of forecasts.\n\nThe German economy shrank by 0.1% percent in the second quarter and Ifo expects another 0.1% decline in the third quarter, two consecutive quarters of contraction.\n\n\u201cTechnically speaking, that would be a recession,\u201d Wollmershaeuser says. A slight recovery in the fourth quarter plus the 0.4% increase of 0.4% achieved in the first quarter would result in growth of 0.5% for 2019 as a whole.\n\nThe cut in Ifo\u2019s outlook follows similar moves from German economic institutes this week. On Wednesday, the DIW institute in Berlin lowered its 2019 growth outlook to 0.5% from 0.9%, and its 2020 forecast to 1.4% and 1.7%. The IfW institute in Kiel is more pessimistic. On Wednesday, it cut its 2019 forecast to 0.4% from 0.6%, and 2020 outlook to 1.0% from 1.6%.\n\nIfo said that its forecasts are associated with high uncertainties. The Munich-based institute said, for example, that it doesn\u2019t assume there will be a further escalation in the U.S. trade dispute or a hard Brexit for the U.K.\n\nFor 2021, all three institutes expect growth of 1.4%.\n\nRead: ECB must try to avoid wrecking eurozone banks with a rate cut\n\nAnd: Too little or never enough: The ECB risks delivering only disappointment", "description": "For 2019, Ifo now expects growth of 0.5% compared with a previous forecast of 0.6%.
