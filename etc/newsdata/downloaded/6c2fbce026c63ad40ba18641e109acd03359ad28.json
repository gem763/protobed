He was caught after he allegedly used a recording device to view someone in the bathroom without their knowledge.\n\n\"Nickey Stane is every woman's nightmare,\" Fresno County District Attorney Lisa Smittcamp said. \"He appears to be a regular person and he is a sexual predator who has terrorized women throughout this valley.\"\n\nStane is also the \"primary suspect\" in the 1996 murder and rape of Debbie Dorian, but has not yet been charged and authorities are still gathering evidence, Fresno Police Chief Jerry Dyer said.\n\nPHOTO: Nickey Stane in a police booking photo.
