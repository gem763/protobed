Secondly, we are obviously partnered with the largest global cannabinoid company, Canadian-based Cronos Group, and thirdly, we have an Asia-Pacific focus.\n\n\"The asset-light business model, where we are working with best-in-class cultivators and manufacturers to supply the product, also allows us to focus on brand and product development, sales and marketing, which we believe is a differentiated strategy in the market.\"\n\nMr Cocks argued that this strategy makes Cronos more responsive to how the medicinal cannabis market ends up playing out in the region. Management can change tack more quickly than they otherwise could if the company was too bogged down running marijuana farms.\n\nCronos Australia aims to generate early revenue by importing and distributing PEACE NATURALS\u2122 products, which are sold in Canada and Germany, before developing its own branded products.\n\nDistribution agreement\n\nPEACE NATURALS\u2122 products contain a hybrid of THC (the main psychoactive part of the cannabis plants), CBD and terpenes (which provide flavour). They include dried cannabis strains called \u201cHappy Feet\u201d and \u201cDancehall\u201d to a range of CBD oils.\n\nDifferent strains can be used to treat medical conditions from acute muscle pain to mental illnesses like anxiety and depression.\n\nCronos has a memorandum of understanding with ASX-listed Sigma Healthcare, which supplies and distributes healthcare products to pharmacies across Australia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Cocks said they are finalising this distribution agreement.\n\n\"We are also working with doctors and healthcare practitioners with prescribing the medicinal cannabis products,\" he said.\n\nIn Australia medicinal cannabis can be legally accessed in three ways: firstly, in a clinical trial. Secondly, through an authorised prescriber, and thirdly and most commonly, through the \u201cSpecial Access Scheme B\u201d (SASB), which is administered by the Therapeutic Goods Administration.\n\nMr Cocks said the number of people accessing medicinal cannabis under the SASB scheme \"has been escalating month by month quite significantly\".", "description": "Marijuana stock hopeful Cronos Australia has changed up its business strategy for its initial public offering after being advised against floating in 2018.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5978%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_1540%2C$y_431/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/380d03bfc9afd28a2e41847e69796be04deb41c3", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
