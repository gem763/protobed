For them, it made all the difference between making a trip and not making a trip.\u201d\n\nBerggren has invested in the guest experience with thoughtful touches to delight his younger visitors, such as a welcome gift for the littlest ones.\n\n\u201cI have repeat visitors, and I\u2019m very happy with the comments I get on the feedback sheet. It gives me a lovely feeling.\u201d\n\nThe property\u2019s financials tell a similarly happy story. To purchase the home, Berggren took out an interest-only mortgage. The property required little upfront capital expenditure; it was in good shape, with modern fittings alongside its original character features, and no major renovations required to prepare it for the short-term rental market.\n\nThe property\u2019s rental income is almost three times the interest-only repayments on Berggren\u2019s mortgage loan. \u201cIf I pay off the mortgage loan, it starts to look like a really good return, clearing about seven per cent,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at the outgoings and the income, right now, it\u2019s a great return on the amount of money I\u2019ve got invested.\u201d\n\nThe property\u2019s rental income has been consistent, too, with an occupancy rate of around 60 per cent \u2013 above average for the area.\n\n\u201cBefore deciding to go into the market, I had monitored a number of properties around Launceston to see what their occupation rate was. My recollection is that 50 per cent was common,\u201d says Berggren.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s possible appreciation, too. The property is close to the university, which has expanded, and the area is attractive, with lots of older homes which give it plenty of charm.\u201d\n\nThe benefits of short-term rental go beyond the balance sheet, says Berggren, who\u2019s a retired executive.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re no longer working full-time, it can keep your skills \u2013 especially communication skills \u2013 up to date,\u201d he says. \u201cIt keeps you active and alert, too, if you choose to do some of the maintenance yourself.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, he enjoys the freedom of the low-maintenance Stayz listing platform, which can be managed almost entirely remotely. \u201cI have installed a key safe so I don't have to meet visitors in person, and that frees me up to do everything from home, apart from the cleaning between tenants, which I\u2019ve now outsourced.\u201d\n\nThree years in, and with increasing occupancy rates for the property, Berggren is more than satisfied with his decision to list the property as a short-term holiday rental.\n\n\u201cI certainly have no regrets about it. I\u2019m very happy with how it\u2019s going,\u201d he says.\n\nStayz powered by HomeAway technology, is a world leader in the holiday rental industry and provides everything you need to rent out your property for the first time.
