House Democrats launched the impeachment inquiry on September 24, months before the American public goes to the polls to elect the next president in November 2020.\n\nUntil the American public votes in November 2020, it will remain unclear whether the Democrats\u2019 impeachment effort will hurt or benefit Trump. The impeachment probe, however, is already having an impact on the ongoing 2020 presidential election, potentially changing the minds of some voters.\n\nMainstream media outlets have acknowledged that impeachment could have collateral effects linked to the 2020 elections.\n\n\u201cImpeachment could drastically affect the 2020 election,\u201d MSNBC conceded on September 25, a day after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) announced the impeachment probe.\n\n\u201cAn election with an impeached Donald Trump at the top of the Republican ticket is an invitation to an electoral uprising that should haunt [Senate Majority Leader] Mitch McConnell\u2019s [R-KY] dreams,\u201d the New York Times added in an October 1 editorial.\n\nThe impeachment effort is reportedly driving away voters critical of Trump\u2019s reelection, namely white women, independents, and college-educated whites, Politico reported on October 3.\n\n\u201cTaken together, the latest polls paint an alarming picture for the president, whose base is sticking by him but cannot be counted on by themselves to deliver him a second term,\u201d the news outlet added.\n\nOn October 5, Quartz also acknowledged that the impeachment effort could impact the upcoming presidential election.:\n\nBecause 2020 is an election year, both sides will manage proceedings with an eye to the November poll. \u2026. For the Democrats, the best outcome would be a split within Republican ranks, which leaves Trump in office but weakened and vulnerable to a challenge for re-nomination.\n\nSome of the news reports disseminated in the wake of the impeachment probe suggest Trump\u2019s allegation that the Democrats \u2018 efforts to remove him are \u201cinterfering\u201d in the 2020 elections have merit.\n\nIn an op/ed published a day after Democrats announced the impeachment probe, the Washington Post acknowledged, \u201c[I]f the [impeachment] investigation turns up anything short of a slam-dunk case to remove him, swing voters might punish a party they see as determined to overturn the result of the last presidential election.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, lawmakers voting in favor of impeaching and removing Trump may galvanize swing voters against the president\u2019s reelection.\n\nCNN noted on October 15:\n\n[T]o the extent the impeachment fight reinforces negative views about Trump \u2014 such as the belief that he considers himself above the law or puts his personal interests above the nation\u2019s \u2014 winning voters who disapprove of his performance will only grow more difficult for him, whatever their views about the Democratic alternative.\n\nCNN conceded that an impeachment effort so close to a presidential election is \u201cunprecedented,\u201d noting on October 15:\n\n\u201cThat unique prospect could scramble the electoral calculations next year for both parties,\u201d it added.\n\nThe House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry stemmed from an intelligence community \u201cwhistleblower\u201d complaint that accused Trump of \u201cusing the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country [Ukraine] in the 2020 U.S. election.\u201d Trump and Ukraine have denied the allegation.\n\nDemocrat\u2019s impeachment efforts may backfire and end up stoking Trump\u2019s base and other voters, several news outlets conceded.\n\nSome vulnerable Democrats in Republican-friendly districts who have come out in support of impeachment have received backlash from some of their constituents. The threat of impeachment has also benefited fundraising at the hands of Trump\u2019s reelection campaign.\n\nSince Democrats announced the impeachment probe, Trump has raised more money than any other president seeking reelection before him at this point in the campaign.
