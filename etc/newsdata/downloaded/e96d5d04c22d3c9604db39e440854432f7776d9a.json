But that was still way below industry norm of around 90% at least.\n\nInvesting.com analyst Barani Krishnan said the surprise draw in crude was also helped by a significant drop in crude imports. Despite being the world\u2019s largest producer of light crude, the United States still buys significant volumes of heavy grade crude each week from Middle East and other producers.\n\n\u201cThe reason for the draw is because imports fell by over 400,000 barrels to reach below 6 million for the first time in a while. It probably became obvious to many that you don\u2019t need to import as much with current refinery run rates.\u201d\n\nAnd Krishnan added, exports ticked up to almost 3.7 million barrels a day,\u201d Krishnan added.\n\nU.S. oil production remained at 12.6 million barrels per day.\n\n\u201cThe market\u2019s focus, accordingly, is on the continuous slump in distillate and gasoline inventories that are busting expectations,\u201d Krishnan said. \u201cAnd, of course, talk of even more OPEC cuts despite Russia playing mind games as always with the market.\u201d\n\nRetail gasoline prices have slowly working their lower, which typically occurs in the fall. AAA's Daily Fuel Gauge Report said the U.S. average was $2.628 a gallon, down 1.3% from Wednesday and 1% for the month. For the year, they're up nearly 16%.", "description": "Oil Pops on Surprise U.S. Stock Slide; Eyes Back on OPEC", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEE5S1ZM_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
