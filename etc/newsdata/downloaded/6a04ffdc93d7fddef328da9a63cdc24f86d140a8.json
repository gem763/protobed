That was well above analyst expectations of around $98 million.\n\nThe one-shot treatment, which promises to cure a devastating muscle-wasting disease in infants, launched at the end of May. It is one of the first in a new wave of treatments known as gene therapies whose price tags are raising concerns about whether they can be afforded by governments and health insurers struggling to control spending.\n\nNovartis Chief Executive Vas Narasimhan said on a call with reporters Tuesday that 99% of patients who were eligible for Zolgensma were receiving it, although some must go through an appeal process to do so. He added that, even with appeals, patients were on average receiving Zolgensma within 30 days of requesting it.\n\nTo allay payer concerns, the company is offering outcomes-based deals where a portion of the cost is refunded if Zolgensma proves ineffective. It is also offering insurers the option to pay for the treatment in five equal installments over five years.\n\nDr. Narasimhan said that while the outcomes-based offer had been taken up by every payer that has agreed to cover Zolgensma, there had been little interest in the installment option. Although the payment-by-instalment approach would ease the upfront cost, cash flow isn't a major concern for insurers, which are by law required to hold large reserves.\n\nThe Novartis boss said Zolgensma's uptake hadn't been affected by a data manipulation scandal that has sparked criticism and could lead to criminal penalties from the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nThe company earlier this year discovered that data on mouse testing related to the manufacture of certain lots of Zolgensma had been manipulated by scientists at the AveXis unit that makes it. The FDA criticized Novartis for failing to disclose those concerns immediately, but has said the manipulation doesn't change its view that Zolgensma is safe and effective.\n\nNovartis has since replaced AveXis's two top scientists -- one of whom was a founder of the gene therapy company -- and promised to accelerate the integration of the unit into the wider organization. Novartis acquired AveXis for $8.7 billion in April last year.\n\n\"We are seeing rapid uptake because many of the payers see both impact and value,\" said a Novartis spokesman, pointing to an independent assessment of Zolgensma by the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review. The nonprofit concluded the treatment was worth $2.1 million when given to newborns who haven't yet developed symptoms of the disease, known as spinal muscular atrophy.\n\nZolgensma halts, rather than reverses, the disease, so the earlier a patient receives treatment, the better the outcome. Novartis hopes that as newborn screening gains traction, the majority of patients will fall into this category.\n\nNovartis has also defended the price of Zolgensma by noting that it would cost half that of the current standard treatment, Biogen Inc.'s Spinraza, over a 10-year period. Spinraza, which is a continuing treatment, costs $750,000 for the first year and then $375,000 for each year after that.\n\nThe update on Zolgensma came as Novartis reported an 8% rise in third-quarter net income to $2.04 billion, driven by strong sales of its newer drugs. Sales rose 10% to $12.17 billion.\n\nIn addition to Zolgensma, Novartis highlighted heart-failure pill Entresto and skin and rheumatic disorder treatment Cosentyx as top performers.\n\nCore operating profit, a figure watched by analysts that strips out extraordinary items, was $3.75 billion, up from $3.26 billion.\n\nNovartis raised its full-year guidance, saying it now expects sales to grow by a high single-digit percentage at constant currency. It forecast core operating income to grow by a mid-to-high teen percentage, also stripping out currency effects. It had previously expected sales to grow by a mid to high single-digit percentage and for core operating income to increase by a low double digit to midteen percentage.\n\nWrite to Denise Roland at Denise.Roland@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 23, 2019 02:47 ET (06:47 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
