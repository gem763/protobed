He is married with two sons and lives in New York City.\n\nWhat is your greatest fear?\n\nDying, and sometimes living.\n\nWhat is your earliest memory?\n\nWhen I was four, we were at Midway airport in Chicago, and there was a large crowd of people surrounding a lady \u2013 everyone was screaming at her, lights were flashing. It was scary. I later learned she was Marilyn Monroe.\n\nWhat is the trait you most deplore in yourself?\n\nSecond-guessing myself: being a Monday morning quarterback for everything I say and do.\n\nWhat makes you unhappy?\n\nFeeling that I have disappointed my wife, my children, my friends, my co-workers, my audience.\n\nIf you could revive something extinct, what would it be?\n\nAll the lost languages, indigenous cultures, plants and animals that we have let die.\n\nWhat is the worst thing anyone\u2019s said to you?\n\n\u201cI hate tenors and I hate Jews, but you moved me.\u201d Said by an audience member who waited to meet me after a concert.
