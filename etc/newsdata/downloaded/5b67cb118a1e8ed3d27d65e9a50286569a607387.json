It tracks Reserve Bank data on new credit card activations against its own referrals, and claims to be responsible for 10 per cent of all activity in some months.\n\nIndeed Finder is so popular that it is one of the few comparison sites that in some instances can justify charging a commission on click-throughs alone rather than sales.\n\nBut while he's had early success, he rejects the 'get rich quick' ethos that might see him try to list Finder before it fulfils more of his global ambitions, which saw it expand to the US in 2015 and the UK this year.\n\n\"Finder is a real business, making profits and paying dividends, and we intend on growing it privately,\" he said.\n\n\"If there is a clear reason to IPO, we will. Otherwise we aren\u2019t looking to cash in quick, unlike some of those Ponzi scheme start-ups you've seen where the share prices tanks on listing.\"\n\nMichael Bailey's feature on Frank Schebesta appears on www.afr.com and inside the Young Rich issue of AFR Magazine, inside Friday's Financial Review.", "description": "The co-founder of Finder.com hopes consumers having more rights to their data will expand his $100 million-a-year product comparison business.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2383%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_334/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/a57f67e227e93b5b811ea3bcd5855310495b79e2", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
