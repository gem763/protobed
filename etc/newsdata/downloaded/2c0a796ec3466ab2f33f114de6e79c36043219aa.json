Shares of EDF had slumped 6.8% by 1:00 p.m. London time on Tuesday.\n\nEDF said Framatome had warned of \"a deviation from technical standards governing the manufacture of nuclear-reactor components.\"\n\nIt added that \"steam generator welds\" on existing in-service components, as well as new as-yet uninstalled parts had potentially not met the standards required by the nuclear industry.\n\nFrance relies heavily on nuclear power for its energy. The IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) said in 2018 that 71.67% of the country's electricity production is from nuclear sources \u2014 the highest percentage in the world.\n\nSeparately, a brand-new reactor at the Flamanville nuclear power plant in northern France is still under construction and has been heavily delayed after components were found to have weakened steel.\n\nA spokesperson for EDF was not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC.", "description": "Shares of the state-owned power company slipped almost 7% after the firm issued a statement.", "authors": ["David Reid"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106121472-1568119467023gettyimages-1152462911.jpeg?v=1568119518", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
