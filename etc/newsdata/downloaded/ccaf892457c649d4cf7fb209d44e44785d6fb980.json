Photo: Retailer\n\nIn the most recent issue of New York Magazine, we explored the enduring appeal of the striped T-shirt \u2014 we tested a bevy of new stripes-specific brands, parsed one stripe-obsessives\u2019 (hefty) collection, and even stood on a street corner in Soho for three hours counting how many we saw (94).
