(Photo: Will Heath, NBC)\n\n\u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d opened this week's episode with a President Donald Trump skit \u2013 big surprise, huh? \u2013 but this Alec Baldwin outing was much better than some recent ones.\n\nThe cold open from Saturday's episode, which was hosted by Chance the Rapper, packed in newsy items \u2014 Syria, ISIS, impeachment, tax returns \u2014 while throwing jabs at Trump, Sen. Lindsey Graham, former President Bill Clinton and the most zealous of Trump rallygoers.\n\nRefreshingly, it highlighted the talented \u201cSNL\u201d cast \u2014 supported by alums Darrell Hammond and Fred Armisen \u2014 rather than relying on the celebrity stunt-casting that has propped up some less-than-stellar presidential skits.\n\nThe Trump skit played a September rally in New Mexico, but also referenced the real president's comment last week that a wall is being built in Colorado, a non-border state, a statement that is hard to parody.\n\nBaldwin's Trump is back: Alec Baldwin returns to 'SNL' as Trump stressing about impeachment; 'Kanye' ends friendship\n\nSome special guests at the Trump rally \u203c\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/HvgumqdEXO \u2014 Saturday Night Live - SNL (@nbcsnl) October 27, 2019\n\nThe gag was bolstered by a funny map that included Good America (mostly states that voted for Trump), Bad America (the Northeast, which didn't), Bad Mexico (which borders Colorado, with New Mexico to the north), New Mexico being north of Colorado and California, which did not vote for Trump, in the ocean.\n\nTrump got the devoted rally crowd going, asking what the impeachment inquiry really is? \"A witchhunt,\" they replied in unison.\n\nWhite House antics: Rudy Giuliani as Joker? A Ferris Bueller-esque Mike Pompeo? It's all in 'SNL's opening skit\n\nHe then segued into, \"And there was no?\" \"No collusion!\" they shouted.\n\n\"No, the new one,\" Baldwin's Trump said, hinting at a phrase he has used to combat the impeachment inquiry. \"No quid pro quo,\" the crowd yelled.\n\nBaldwin's Trump was then praised by a bunch of fervent supporters he invited to the microphone. Cecily Strong played a woman whose t-shirt misspelled Trump's \"Keep America Great Again\" slogan. When Trump mentioned some typos, she responded, \"No, this is taken verbatim from one of your tweets. Therefore, it's correct.\"\n\nComing at you live from the Trump rally in Albuquerque. pic.twitter.com/m7r5gXGwuB \u2014 Saturday Night Live - SNL (@nbcsnl) October 27, 2019\n\nShe said the impeachment inquiry is \"a deep-state liberal conspiracy and everyone's in on it: The CIA, the FBI, the M-I-C, the K-E-Y, and the M-O-U-S-E.\"\n\nAidy Bryant played another Trump devotee: \"I love you and I worship you as the one true white lord.\"\n\nWhen Trump said he might shoot the anonymous author of an upcoming Trump expose on Fifth Avenue, playing off a real Trump statement, Bryant's supporter offered him a gun. \"Well, the earth is flat and Beyonc\u00e9 is white,\" she said, as Trump shooed her off.\n\nPete Davidson, clad in black, was introduced as a young Trump supporter. The president asked if he was from New Mexico.\n\n\"ISIS,\" Davidson's character answered, echoing news of ISIS escapees in Syria. \"I was in a prison in Syria until last week when you freed me. So, I just wanted to say thank you for bringing jobs back \u2013 to ISIS. And I promise that I will make ISIS great again.\"\n\nCLOSE Who are the Kurds and what does less U.S. troops in the region mean for the war against ISIS? We explain. Just the FAQs, USA TODAY\n\n\"Terrific. What a great guy,\" Trump responded. \"ISIS is back in a big way, folks. And we love that, don't we?\"\n\nThen, it was time for famous faces. Trump couldn't seem to identify Graham, one of his strongest supporters in Congress. \"Sorry, I thought you were a scoop of ice cream melting into a suit.\"\n\n\"I'm sweating profusely all the time,\" Kate McKinnon's jowly senator replied. \"Even my bodily fluids are trying to distance themselves from me.\"\n\nFacebook founder Mark Zuckerberg (Alex Moffat), who faced harsh questioning in Congress last week, was on hand, because \"he got his (behind) completely owned by AOC (Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez), so it means he's one of us now.\"\n\nCourt battle: Trump tax returns: New York prosecutor says president can't block subpoena for financial records\n\nTrump thanked him for running \"our Russia campaign,\" with Moffat's awkward Zuckerberg replying \"Facebook isn't pro-Russia. It's just not anti-Russia.\" He then went on about a rigorous fact-checking review board \u2014 before Davidson's ISIS soldier said he was on the panel.\n\nHammond's Clinton then arrived, saying he just \"followed the party.\" When Trump said he was getting impeached, Clinton surmised it had something to do with a sex-related matter, as it was when he was impeached in 1998.\n\n\"No, it's not for that,\" Trump said. \"They don't mind when I do that.\"\n\nFinally, Trump introduced his \"new friend,\" Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. (The real president's decision to change U.S. policy in Syria after a call with the Turkish president has come under bipartisan criticism.)\n\nChloe Fineman, left, as a former Miss Teen USA who now heads the U.S. Department of Energy, and Alec Baldwin, as President Trump, appear in Saturday's opening sketch from \"Saturday Night Live.\" (Photo: Will Heath, NBC)\n\n\"Erdogan and I are such good friends now,\" Trump said.\n\n\"It's like when Franco and Mussolini would take vacations together,\" Armisen's Erdogan responded, continuing the bromance banter.\n\nWhen Trump said he didn't have anything to gain financially from the decision, the pair got into a debate about how rich Trump really is. When Erdogan said Trump had $100 billion, Trump said, \"Not exactly, but it's definitely billions.\"\n\n\"He's being modest,\" Erdogan responded, setting up one last dig on a newsy item. \"I'm sure it's more than that. Show them your tax returns.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2019/10/26/saturday-night-live-president-trump-alec-baldwin-new-mexico-rally/2477170001/", "description": "Alec Baldwin opened \"Saturday Night Live\" with a strong President Trump skit riffing off a recent rally in New Mexico.", "authors": ["Bill Keveney", "Published A.M.
