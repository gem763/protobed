Read more\n\nThe lawsuit, filed at the district court in the central city of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, demands that the plant\u2019s operators stop burning lignite, or take measures to eliminate the plant\u2019s carbon emissions, by 2035 at the latest.\n\n\n\nMarcin Stoczkiewicz, the head of central and eastern Europe at ClientEarth, said: \u201cThe Be\u0142chat\u00f3w power plant has provided Poland with vital power for decades, but times have changed. The largest emitters, like Be\u0142chat\u00f3w, must shoulder their share of responsibility for the climate crisis. Without a rapid coal phase-out, the climate fight will be futile.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Be\u0142chat\u00f3w plant burns approximately 45m tonnes of coal each year, and has emitted approximately 1bn tonnes of CO 2 over the course of its lifetime.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Poland\u2019s president, Andrzej Duda, says it would be difficult for the country not to use its coal supplies.

While an increasing proportion of the coal burned in Poland is imported from elsewhere, such as Russia, its rightwing leadership portrays the fossil fuel as a guarantor of the country\u2019s energy security and future economic growth.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere is no plan today to fully give up on coal,\u201d Poland\u2019s president, Andrzej Duda, said in the run-up to the UN climate talks in December. The event was held in Katowice, in the south-western region of Silesia, the centre of the Polish coal industry. \u201cExperts point out that our supplies run for another 200 years, and it would be hard not to use them,\u201d he added.\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, another state-owned company opened a new coking coalmine in Jastrz\u0119bie-Zdr\u00f3j, near Poland\u2019s border with the Czech Republic, in a ceremony attended by the Polish prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki. It was the first coalmine to be opened in Poland since 1994.\n\nOn the same day, Poland\u2019s ruling rightwing Law and Justice party announced plans to pass legislation allowing the government to build coalmines without the need to secure the approval of local authorities.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Greenpeace protesters on the roof of the economy ministry in Warsaw, Poland. Photograph: Radek Pietruszka/EPA\n\nThe energy minister, Krzysztof Tch\u00f3rzewski, told reporters at the opening of the mine at Jastrz\u0119bie-Zdr\u00f3j: \u201cThis special legislation being prepared by lawmakers is related to the fact that local authorities are not interested in new mines being built in their areas, while we will need new coal deposits to secure supplies for the energy industry.\u201d\n\n\n\nTchorzewski said the legislation would facilitate the development by Polska Grupa Energetyczna of a new lignite open-pit mine at Z\u0142oczew, not far from Be\u0142chat\u00f3w.\n\n\n\nThe Polish government\u2019s continuing enthusiasm for coal is widely seen as obstacle to EU-wide efforts drastically to drastically reduce the bloc\u2019s carbon emissions.\n\n\n\nDuda was embroiled in a diplomatic spat with Emanuel Macron this week, after the French president singled out the Polish government for blocking his attempts to make the EU commit to carbon neutrality by 2050.\n\n\n\n\u201cMarching every Friday to say that the planet is burning, that\u2019s nice, but that is not the problem,\u201d Macron said before the recent UN climate talks in New York. \u201cGo protest in Poland! Help me move those I cannot push forward.\u201d\n\nMacron\u2019s remarks prompted Duda to describe his French counterpart as \u201cdishonest and impudent\u201d.", "description": "Future of Poland\u2019s Be\u0142chat\u00f3w power station under scrutiny as grassroots groups and NGOs take radical action", "authors": ["Christian Davies"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c794626b8900a3446c0261cd12f5e904b2ff067/0_11_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=fd8e66cc04a84d46faf4f40e0e89a6e8", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
