This shows that she is capable of concealing evidence. She only handed herself over to the police after the bodies were found.\"\n\nThe children were 11-months-old, three, seven and eight years old.\n\nHarmse told the court that Maditla, who is charged with a Schedule 6 offence, failed to show exceptional reasons why she should be granted bail in terms of Section 60 (11) of the Criminal Procedure Act.\n\nMaditla was represented by Mphile Ndzondo from Legal Aid South Africa.\n\nNdzondo told the court earlier on Friday that the impact the children's deaths had on Maditla was \"one of exceptional circumstances\".\n\n\"We cannot change the fact that the applicant will always be hurt by the loss of her children,\" said Ndzondo.\n\n\"The applicant handed herself over to the police. This is an indication that she will not evade trial if she is given bail.\"\n\nMagistrate Mdumiseni Mavuso postponed the case to June 24.", "description": "A woman who is accused of killing her four children in Klarinet in Mpumalanga allegedly kept their bodies in her rented room for four days, the Witbank Magistrate's Court heard.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8372/6d3f8255f73c43a4ba602790a0900fa6.jpg", "published_at": "2019-06-14"}
