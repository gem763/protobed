John McCain, for whom the think tank was founded, and the president of Arizona State University, which is a partner of the institute.\n\nCindy McCain, in a statement released in tandem with Volker\u2019s, thanked the career diplomat for his service, crediting Volker for \u201chelping to build the McCain Institute into the results-driven, action-oriented institution that it is today. We are proud of these accomplishments and I especially appreciate his dedication to my husband and the entire McCain family.\u201d\n\nVolker was a key player early on in the Ukraine scandal that\u2019s engulfed the Trump presidency. Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal attorney, roped him in almost from the outset, defending his snooping for dirt on the Bidens by publicizing text messages in which Volker set up a meeting between Giuliani and a top aide to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nAnd text messages released last week after his nine-hour testimony show that Volker factored in heavily as a go-between with Zelensky\u2019s top aide. In one text, Volker suggests a meeting between Trump and Zelensky is contingent on the latter agreeing to investigate alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. election.\n\nVolker was also involved in efforts for the Trump administration to weigh in on a statement being crafted for Zelensky to announce such an investigation, though he told lawmakers he desired a broader statement than Giuliani envisioned. He also told lawmakers that he gave Giuliani a heads up that he had likely been fed misinformation by contacts in Ukraine.\n\nVolker's revelations gave ammo to both Trump's investigators and his defenders in Congress, who took differing stances on what his testimony meant for the narrative of the impeachment investigation.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/50/f2/0506fb304467b322e8152ba40077/191007-volker-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
