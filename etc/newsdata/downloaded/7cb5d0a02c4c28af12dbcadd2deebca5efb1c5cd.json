Esper and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Joseph Dunford announced in an evening press conference Friday that a \u201cmoderate\u201d number of U.S. troops would be deployed and will be focused on air and missile defense. President Trump has said he is displaying \u201cstrength\u201d in his measured response so far to the attack on a key Middle East ally.\n\nMr. Esper said the U.S. is not seeking conflict with Iran, but \u201call indications are that Iran was responsible for the attacks\u201d on Saudi Aramco oil facilities on Sept. 14.\n\nThe Pentagon Thursday called on other countries to \u201ccontribute assets in an international effort to reinforce Saudi Arabia\u2019s defense.\u201d\n\nLawmakers on Capitol Hill have expressed opposition to engaging in a new military strike against Iran or its regional allies. Sen. Chris Murphy, Connecticut Democrat, told The Washington Times Wednesday \u201cit would be an absolute disaster for the United States to engage in military strikes against Iran. Saudi Arabia is not the 51st state.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe do not have a defense agreement with them, and they have behaved generally in a manner that is completely reckless and irresponsible unbefitting of an American security guarantee,\u201d he added.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
