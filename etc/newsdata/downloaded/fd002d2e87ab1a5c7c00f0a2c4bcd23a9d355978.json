(Photo: Sara Karnes/News-Leader)\n\nD'Avanzo is demanding Silver Dollar City change the name of its new ride to avoid confusion and unfair competition, according to court filings.\n\nSilver Dollar City responded with a lawsuit this month, saying it went through the necessary steps to register the Mystic River Falls mark with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, and D'Avanzo did not oppose Silver Dollar City's application during the requisite opposition period.\n\nIn the lawsuit, Silver Dollar City indicates it does not believe there will be confusion between its multimillion-dollar ride and the haunted house D'Avanzo created in the attached garage of his home as a \"family project and neighborhood attraction.\"\n\nRelated: Silver Dollar City announces major park expansion, Mystic River Falls\n\nThe lawsuit says D'Avanzo's Mystic Motel haunted house is no longer operational, and the Mystic Motel name doesn't appear to be in use.\n\nSilver Dollar City's Mystic River Falls ride is scheduled to open in summer 2020.\n\nSilver Dollar City says the name Mystic River Falls is an ode to the theme park's origin centered around Marvel Cave, which contains the Mystic River Passage and Mystic River Pool Room.\n\nThe Mystic River Falls ride will replace the old Lost River of the Ozarks water ride, and it boasts the \"the tallest drop on a raft ride in the Western Hemisphere.\"\n\nMore: Marvel Cave: a natural wonder and an inspiration for growth at Silver Dollar City\n\nIn the recent filings, Silver Dollar City says it has \"extensively advertised and promoted\" its new water ride using the Mystic River Falls name and it does not believe D'Avanzo's claim should force the theme park to change the name of its new water ride.\n\nAn attempt to reach D'Avanzo's attorney for comment was not successful.\n\nSilver Dollar City spokeswoman Lisa Rau said the organization is aware of the court filings but did not have a comment since it is a legal matter.\n\nMeanwhile, in New Jersey: American Dream Nickelodeon Universe giant indoor theme park sells out for first weekend\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/experience/america/theme-parks/2019/10/28/silver-dollar-city-branson-missouri-mystic-river-falls-ride-name/2490613001/", "description": "Silver Dollar City's Mystic River Falls is expected to open in summer 2020, but a California man claims the name is too similar to his haunted house.", "authors": ["Harrison Keegan", "Published P.M.
