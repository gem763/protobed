(AP Photo/Richard Drew)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Latest on U.S. negotiations to end the war in Afghanistan (all times local):\n\n12:35 p.m.\n\nFormer Defense Secretary James Mattis says that when it comes to trying to negotiate an Afghanistan peace deal with the Taliban, the key question is whether or not they can be trusted.\n\nMattis cites past U.S. nuclear talks with the Russians, when the American side talked about \"trust but verify.\"\n\nHe tells CBS' \"Face the Nation\" that \"I think you want to verify, then trust\" in dealing with the Taliban.\n\nMattis says the U.S. since the Bush administration, has \"demanded that they break with al-Qaida\" but \"they've refused to do so.\" He also says \"we should never forget\" that they were behind the Sept. 11 attacks.\n\nPresident Donald Trump says he was set this weekend to meet at Camp David with leaders of the Taliban. But Trump says he called off that meeting, and a separate one with Afghanistan's president, after a Taliban bombing that killed an American soldier and 11 other people.\n\n___\n\n12:20 p.m.\n\nA Taliban spokesman contends that the insurgent group had finalized an Afghanistan peace deal with the United States and that both sides were satisfied.\n\nSuhail Shaheen in a tweet says that the government of Qatar, where the talks have taken place, was going to announce the agreement \u2014 until President Donald Trump stepped in.\n\nShaheen says Trump's tweets canceling a secret meeting with the Taliban at Camp David and calling off negotiations have hurt U.S. credibility.\n\nTrump cited a recent Taliban attack in Kabul, the Afghan capital, that killed an American soldier.\n\nOfficials in Qatar haven't responded to a request for comment.\n\n___\n\n12:05 p.m\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo (pahm-PAY'-oh) says the Trump administration has recalled envoy Zalmay Khalilzad (ZAHL'-may kah-LEEL'-zahd), who has been negotiating with Taliban leaders for months in Qatar (KUH'-tur).\n\nPompeo says it'll up to the insurgent group whether talks will resume.\n\nPresident Donald Trump says he canceled negotiations with the Taliban in the wake of Thursday's car bombing in the Afghan capital that killed an American soldier, a Romanian service member and 10 civilians in a busy diplomatic area near the U.S. Embassy.\n\nAnd Trump called off secret Afghanistan peace talks planned for Camp David on Sunday.\n\n___\n\n9:05 a.m.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo (pahm-PAY'-oh) says the Taliban \"overreached\" with their car bomb attack in a diplomatic area near the U.S. Embassy in Kabul, killing an American soldier \u2014 and that led President Donald Trump to pull back from planned Afghanistan peace talks at Camp David.\n\nPompeo says it's now up to the Taliban to \"change their behavior.\" America's top diplomat isn't saying whether or when peace talks would resume.\n\nTrump tweeted on Saturday night that he had canceled a secret meeting, planned for Sunday at the presidential retreat in Maryland, with Taliban and Afghan leaders, and called off talks with the insurgent group.

The Taliban so far has refused to talk with the Afghan government, calling it a U.S. puppet.\n\nThe militants' statement says the invitation to Camp David had been delivered in late August. Trump's series of tweets said he had planned to meet separately with the Taliban and with the Afghan president.\n\nTrump blamed the cancellation on the death of a U.S. service member in a Taliban attack in Kabul on Thursday, but critics point out that several U.S. soldiers had already been killed in the course of negotiations.\n\n___\n\n3:15 a.m.\n\nThe Afghan government says it doesn't believe talks between the United States and Taliban will continue \"at this stage\" after President Donald Trump abruptly called them off.\n\nAfghan presidential spokesman Sediq Seddqi spoke to reporters hours after Trump in a series of tweets announced that he had canceled a secret meeting set for Sunday at Camp David with Taliban and Afghan leaders.", "description": "Former Defense Secretary James Mattis says that when it comes to trying to negotiate an Afghanistan peace deal with the Taliban, the key question is whether they can be trusted.
