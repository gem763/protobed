In a handful of photos, Union, 46, and Dunst, 37, are lavishly dressed in ethereal couture designs.\n\nWhile the two are not photographed together, they referenced their 2000 cheerleader comedy in the best way possible. It all started when a fan tweeted, \"Isis and Torrance snapped @itsgabrielleu @kirstendunst @VogueRunway,\" calling the actresses by their character names.\n\n\"Dare I say... We brought it \ud83e\udd14\ud83d\ude2c\ud83e\udd17,\" Union quipped as she retweeted photos of the shoot.\n\nDare I say...

I\u2019ve never been nominated for anything. Maybe, like, twice for Golden Globes when I was little and one for Fargo. But, like, I always feel like nobody -- I don\u2019t know,\" she said in an interview with SiriusXM\u2019s Larry Flick of In Depth With Larry Flick. \u201cMaybe they think I\u2019m just the girl from Bring It On? I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just feel like, \u2018What did I do?\u2019 I\u2019m so chill, maybe I don\u2019t play the game enough?\u201d she pondered. \"I don\u2019t know.\"\n\nET was on the set of Bring It On, where both Dunst and Union talked about their time making the movie.
