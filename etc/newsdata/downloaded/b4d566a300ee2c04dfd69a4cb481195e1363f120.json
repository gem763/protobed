He is under scrutiny by federal prosecutors. But throughout the building controversy, Giuliani has continued to represent clients, broker deals and take on consulting contracts in Washington and around the world in ways that leave him subject to criticism that he is using his role as President Donald Trump\u2019s personal lawyer to open doors to the government and influence policy despite the questions about his own conduct.\n\nA few weeks ago, Giuliani secured a meeting, along with some other defense lawyers, with the head of the Justice Department\u2019s criminal division and attorneys in the fraud section. They were there to discuss a foreign bribery case for a client that Giuliani described as \u201cvery, very sensitive.\u201d\n\nGiuliani declined to divulge any details about the meeting, except to say it had nothing to do with legal issues facing him or Trump. Days after the meeting, it was revealed that Giuliani was under investigation himself for possible violations of foreign lobbying laws by federal prosecutors in Manhattan.\n\nGiuliani lashed out at what he said were efforts by congressional Democrats, as well as journalists and critics in the executive branch, to \u201cdestroy\u201d his business.\n\n\u201cI really try very hard to be super-ethical and always legal,\u201d he wrote in a text message in response to questions about his meeting with the Justice Department. \u201cBut I can\u2019t publicly defend everything I do because I\u2019m presumed guilty. If I did, my business and firm would be unable to have any clients. That\u2019s why this malicious torrent of questions is so damaging.\u201d\n\nOver the last year, he has circulated widely on television defending Trump, denouncing the special counsel\u2019s investigation into Russian election interference and trying to turn attention to what he says is wrongdoing by Democrats. Giuliani has meanwhile pursued a range of lucrative deals with clients around the world.\n\nThat business development push coincided with a heightened demand for back channels to Trump, who swept into office without connections to the usual array of Washington gatekeepers and power brokers. Business and political leaders \u2014 particularly in Africa, Asia, the Middle East and the former Soviet Union \u2014 were willing to pay handsomely for relationships with Trump intimates that could give them access in Washington or additional credibility and stature at home.\n\nIn one recent example that has not been disclosed in detail, Giuliani was retained this year to headline a team that was paid $425,000 to drum up American and foreign government support for a methane project in Uzbekistan that was also seeking Chinese financing, according to people familiar with the effort.\n\nThat deal came after a string of others that have come under more scrutiny as Giuliani has pursued his work on Trump\u2019s behalf. He was paid $500,000 late last year by a company co-owned by a Ukrainian-American businessman who played a key role in facilitating the campaign to pressure Ukraine that Trump championed.\n\nGiuliani was paid what he described in an interview as \u201ca reasonable amount of money\u201d in 2017 by a Ukrainian Russian developer to create an emergency management plan for the developer\u2019s hometown in northeast Ukraine near the Russian border.\n\nAnd Giuliani\u2019s security company this year won a contract to consult for the Bahraini government, which described him as leading a \u201chigh-level United States delegation\u201d when he visited to pitch his services to the king in December.\n\nWhile Giuliani insists he does not lobby, and says his contracts explicitly state that he will not, some of his clients and prospective clients said in interviews that they saw him as a conduit to the administration.\n\nFor instance, while Giuliani was exploring work in the Democratic Republic of Congo last year, its ambassador to the United States said in an interview that his country was relying on Giuliani to act as a liaison as it sought to avoid further sanctions from the Trump administration.\n\nHe has at times sought to shape American foreign policy to benefit his clients, pressing Trump and Rex Tillerson, then the secretary of state, during an Oval Office meeting in 2017 to consider releasing a jailed client, an Iranian Turkish gold trader, as part of a potential prisoner swap with Turkey.", "description": "WASHINGTON -- It is an extraordinary time in Washington, but it is more or less business as usual for Rudy Giuliani.He is a central figure in the impeachment inquiry.
