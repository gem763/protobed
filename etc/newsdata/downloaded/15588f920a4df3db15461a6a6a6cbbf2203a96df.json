Bloomberg\n\nEviation's plane, the Alice, is in the vanguard of a push into all-electric models. The company is betting its nine-passenger capacity and 650-mile (1046km) range will attract environmentally conscious buyers in a commuter market served by a variety of light aircraft.\n\nRunning costs will be about $US200 ($2935) per flight hour versus $US1000 for a turboprop, though the model will be slower than some conventional craft.\n\nEviation now expects its first flight next year rather than before Christmas as initially targeted, as US Federal Aviation Administration certification has slipped towards 2022, according to Bar-Yohay, who spoke in Tel Aviv, near where the company is based.", "description": "Eviation Aircraft is betting the Alice's nine-passenger capacity and 1046km range will attract environmentally conscious buyers in a commuter market.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2738%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_31%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/13618880d8b2388b05d2f649a626af0d4a1a8b69", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
