Forecasts made hours before Election Day three years ago went spectacularly awry, so who can know what will happen in November 2020?\n\nYet like it or not, the most important watchers of the Democratic debate on Thursday will be electability voters, who happen to constitute a majority of the party. And they are right to believe that the priority in 2020 is defeating President Trump. A man who invents the trajectory of a hurricane is not exactly someone whom we should entrust with four more years of power.\n\nStill, if the question of who can win is a constant, the dynamic going into this encounter is very different from that of July\u2019s face-offs \u2014 and not just because 10 candidates who were there before will be missing. Rather quickly, the Democratic presidential race has come down to three candidates, and then everyone else.\n\nThe battle for supremacy is between former vice president Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), with Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.) holding on to his loyalists but having trouble reaching beyond them. The seven others will have to decide which of these three they most need to bring down.\n\nWarren has had by far the best 2019 of anyone. She is still rising in the polls, and she was greeted with warm jubilance at the New Hampshire Democratic State Convention on Saturday. This makes her a target in a way she wasn\u2019t before.\n\nWarren\u2019s supporters have been the sharpest critics of the electability test because it is so often used against her. The doubts about whether she can beat Trump are sometimes expressed in ideological terms (\u201cshe\u2019s too left\u201d) and, much more guardedly, about who she is. Can a one-time Harvard professor win Pennsylvania or Wisconsin? Could the sexism that helped undermine Hillary Clinton also undercut Warren?\n\nBringing up sexism, of course, risks giving sexists power. Is it any different to vote against Warren because she\u2019s a woman, or because other voters might? Either way, the result is the same. When Democratic voters raise the question of sexism, they do so guiltily. But they raise it.\n\nWarren therefore has one big, if amorphous, task: to convince doubters she can beat Trump. How do we know this? A fascinating poll in June by the Democratic data firm Avalanche found Biden ahead with 29 percent to 17 percent for Sanders and 16 percent for Warren. But when the same voters were asked whom they would make president with a \u201cmagic wand,\u201d 21 percent picked Warren, with Biden and Sanders getting 19 percent each. The bottom line: If Democrats think she can win next November, she can win primary and caucus contests in February and March.\n\nWarren is fully aware of the burden she must meet. \u201cWe need to win in 2020,\u201d she told New Hampshire Democrats. \u201cI get it. There is a lot at stake. But we can\u2019t choose a candidate we don\u2019t believe in because we\u2019re scared.\u201d\n\nIt was an indirect but pointed barb at Biden, whose 10-point gap on Avalanche\u2019s preference and \u201cmagic wand\u201d questions underscores why he needs a commanding performance this week. A Washington Post-ABC News poll released Sunday brought the point home. Overall, the 76-year-old former vice president was preferred by 29 percent of Democrats to 19 percent for Sanders and 18 percent for Warren. But while 45 percent saw Biden as the candidate having the best chance of defeating Trump, only 24 percent said he would make the best president \u2014 to Warren\u2019s 20 percent and Sanders\u2019s 16 percent.\n\nBiden has to reinforce the idea that he is the safest choice against Trump, a view that was brought into doubt by his less-than-stellar outing in the first debate in June and by various missteps and misstatements that critics link to his age. Easing such concerns is his one and only job on Thursday.\n\nFor Sanders, who also got an enthusiastic reception in New Hampshire, the question is whether he can break out beyond his seemingly rock-solid base of loyalists. A \u201cNew Bernie\u201d is both an impossibility and a bad idea for his brand as a conviction politician. But he won\u2019t win unless he can expand his market share, a phrase I use with apologies to all democratic socialists.\n\nThe take I have offered leaves out \u201ceveryone else,\u201d which is in one sense unfair. California Sen. Kamala D. Harris and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg are within striking distance of the top three. Someone among Thursday\u2019s remaining five could catch a break if one of the current leaders falters.\n\nBut that is the point: For now, nearly two-thirds of Democrats support one of the three leaders. And things are likely to stay that way if Sanders\u2019s devoted band keeps the faith \u2014 and if Biden and Warren convince Democrats that they can, indeed, throw the world\u2019s most inept meteorologist out of the White House.\n\nRead more from E.J.
