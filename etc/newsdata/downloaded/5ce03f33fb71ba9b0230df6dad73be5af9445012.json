When the England players arrive on Monday night the Bulgarian Football Union has laid out a red carpet and ropes around the entrance hall that leads into the main stand.\n\nBulgarian football, the team itself, is on its knees. By Tuesday night they have lost 10 games in succession. The boys of 1994 are in their 50s now and they run the show, although not very successfully. Borislav Mikhailov, the goalkeeper from that team, most famous for playing in a wig so distinct it deserved its own squad number, is the president. Krasimir Balakov, a brilliant attacking midfielder from the 1994 team, is the manager. Both have pinned all the team\u2019s Euro 2020 hopes on winning their Nations League qualifier. The qualifiers have been sacrificed and performances have been dreadful. Patience is running thin.", "description": "The question that the England players are asked first in the aftermath of Monday night\u2019s game at the Vasil Levski National stadium in Sofia is the easiest to answer:", "authors": ["Sam Wallace", "Chief Football Writer", "Paul Hayward", "Jason Burt"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/15/TELEMMGLPICT000213034808-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq900leoZVuq6ru6F43OqP_jlaTMTxUhlzF8Rkw038U-A.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
