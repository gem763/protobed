By Gwen Stefani, Mike had to compete with Catherine Tyldesley in the bottom two to keep his space.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was a split decision with head judge Shirley Ballas ultimately keeping Mike in and sending Catherine home.\n\nResponding on today\u2019s BBC Breakfast, he said: \u2018It\u2019s an entertainment show, we\u2019re all just trying our best.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve said before, and this was the advice from Katya [Jones, his pro partner], I\u2019m not really competing against anybody else, you\u2019re competing against yourself to try and just learn to get better every week.\n\n\u2018As a non-dancer myself that\u2019s all I can really do.\u2019\n\nMike said he was trying to rise above the hate he was getting online and keeping positive for the week ahead (Picture: BBC)\n\nTalking about the hate he\u2019s received, he added: \u2018You have to rise about the abuse and people giving you abuse on social media, it\u2019s one of the sad things about social media.\u2019\n\nHe also added that he didn\u2019t want to see Catherine and pro Johannes Radebe go, but he had to accept what decision was made.\n\nThe video was retweeted by fellow competitor Kelvin Fletcher, who wrote above it: \u2018Honestly you won\u2019t meet a nicer guy. What a class act.\u2019\n\nWill Bayley, who was absent from this week\u2019s shows due to injury, added: \u2018Love him.\u2019\n\nMike and Katya landed in the dance off with their Alice in Wonderland themed routine (Picture: BBC)\n\nIt seems that Catherine and Johannes being let go was as much of a shock to the rest of the cast as it was to Mike and Katya \u2013 with Michelle saying her \u2018jaw hit the ground\u2019 over the decision.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I\u2019m telling you if they\u2019d kept the camera on me my jaw was on the ground,\u2019 Michelle told Lorraine today.\n\nMore: Strictly Come Dancing Strictly Come Dancing star Johannes Radebe says show helped him 'accept' himself Michelle Visage reveals BTS reaction to Catherine Tyldesley's Strictly Come Dancing exit How old is Strictly Come Dancing's Craig Revel Horwood and is he married?\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t know.
