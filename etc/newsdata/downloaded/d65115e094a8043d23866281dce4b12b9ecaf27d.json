Dexus, which says it expected judgment to be handed soon after the November 22 hearing, accused Grocon of avoiding judgment by putting the two entities, Grocon Constructors (Qld) Pty Ltd and Grocon Constructors (Vic) Pty Ltd, into administration.\n\nDexus' general counsel and company secretary Brett Cameron said Grocon \"appears to be seeking to avoid the court hearing by winding up these entities.\"\n\nGrocon also developed the office tower, which it sold to Dexus and the Dexus Wholesale Property Fund. In a matter unrelated to the $28 million spat, The Australian Financial Review's Street Talk column last year reported that Grocon was pressured by rental guarantee obligations it had relating to the \"lease tails\" of tenants it drew out of other buildings to 480 Queen Street.\n\nGrocon suffered a $27.5 million loss in the 2017 year, prompting auditor PwC to report that \"material uncertainty\" cast doubt on its ability to continue as a going concern.\n\nThe privately owned builder on Friday said it had appointed John Park of FTI Consulting in Brisbane, as joint and several voluntary administrator of two subsidiaries.\n\nGrocon said it both subsidiaries were dormant and had no employees. Their administration would not affect the builder's other projects, including The Ribbon in Sydney and Northumberland in Melbourne, it said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cGrocon has developed and constructed billions of dollars of real estate for Dexus over the years and its attitude to this matter is both unreasonable and disappointing,\" Mr Grollo said.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, Dexus\u2019 reluctance to wait until the Court matter is concluded, means that Grocon has been left with no choice. The voluntary administration process will ultimately resolve the situation.\"\n\nThe Australian Financial Review in 2017 reported that a steel-fixing subcontractor filed for bankruptcy after Grocon failed to the $600,000 it owed E &S Reinforcements over the construction of 480 Queen Street. The Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union said Grocon had not paid several groups of sub-contractors in Queensland for six to eight months.", "description": "Australia's largest office landlord Dexus says builder Grocon failed to pay rent over office space it had leased.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5116%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_97/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/d8cb938964514700bf906e36480b46e526928d6c", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
