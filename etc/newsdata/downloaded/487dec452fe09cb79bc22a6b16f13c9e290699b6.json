It is to ensure that spaces are made available on a regular basis for customers using the facilities in the surrounding area, that is achieved by encouraging a regular turnover of spaces.\n\n\u2018As you will appreciate from the images you have seen, the driver in question parked in a manner which contravened the terms and conditions stated on the signage. Had the driver parked within the confines of a valid marked bay they would have not received a PCN.\n\n\u2018The terms and conditions on site are valid 24 hours a day, seven days a week, so we must reiterate that the way in which the driver has parked still contravenes these terms regardless of the time.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
