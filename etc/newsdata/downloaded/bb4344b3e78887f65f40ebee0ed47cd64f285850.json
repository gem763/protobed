When the butter has melted add the eggs, salt and pepper and stir with a wooden spoon until the mixture starts to thicken. Gradually add the diced butter and creme fraiche to the eggs, stirring all the time, this will stop the eggs from cooking too quickly and setting. Cook until the scrambled egg will just hold its shape when piled onto the avocado, you don\u2019t want it sliding off!\n\nCut the avocado in half, take out the stone and remove a little of the flesh. Brush the cut sides with a little oil or melted butter. Half fill the cup with sausage meat and press down with the back of a spoon, fill the rest of the cup with half of the tomato and spring onion mixture. Top each avocado half with some scrambled egg and sprinkle over the remainder of the sausage meat.\n\nPlace on a baking tray and bake in the oven for 8-10 minutes.\n\nRemove to a plate, top with the remaining tomato and spring onion mixture and sprinkle over some red pepper flakes for a touch of mild, fruity heat and colour.\n\nFollow Beverley Hicks @littlechelseakitchen", "description": "Baked avocado cups with egg and sausage Avocado takes on an even creamier taste when baked in the oven.\u00a0Add some perfectly cooked scrambled eggs and sausage and you\u2019ve got yourself a delicious breakfast or light snack.
