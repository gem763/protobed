Juul, which has three-quarters of the vaping market, has also been the target of lawsuits over allegations that it targeted teens with deceptive marketing practices.\n\nJuul CEO to non-smokers: \"Don't vape. Don't use Juul.\"\n\nThe FDA letter highlights an incident that two New York high school students recounted during a congressional hearing in July. The teens testified that a Juul representative was invited to address the school on addiction issues. During the presentation, the representative told students the company's product was \"totally safe.\"\n\nIn marketing materials, Juul has also referred to its products as \"99% safer than cigarettes, \"much safer\" than cigarettes, \"totally safe\" and \"a safer alternative than smoking cigarettes,\" according to the FDA letter.\n\nJuul said it discontinued its school programs last September. Responding Monday to the FDA's letter, Juul said in a statement that \"We are reviewing the letters and will fully cooperate.\"\n\nVaping has recently been linked to at least five deaths and 450 illnesses nationwide, Prompting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to warn people \"to consider not vaping pending further investigation.\"\n\nLast week, Michigan became the first state to ban sales of flavored e-cigarettes. San Francisco has also banned sales of e-cigarettes that are not FDA approved.", "description": "Federal watchdog says vaping company hasn't proven that its products are less harmful than cigarettes", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/04/03/b5edf2e6-5b69-4a51-ab61-ea577444b23c/thumbnail/1200x630/ad0dc0a4f76cdeaa76691ee714c1ddb9/rts2ct0q.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
