While Wednesday\u2019s jobs report from ADP was soft rather than outright weak, \u201cwithin the context of other bad macro data the last couple of days, it\u2019s sort of piling on.\u201d\n\nRelated: Why Gold is Shining Bright This Quarter\n\nPolitical risk may have also played into Wednesday\u2019s selling after presidential candidate Bernie Sanders canceled campaign appearances due to a health issue. Art Cashin, who runs the NYSE floor operations of UBS, argued that if Sanders dropped out, most of his support would go to Sen. Elizabeth Warren, whom has been a long-time critic of banks and Wall Street.\n\n\u201cThe last 200 to 300 points may have been a Bernie factor,\u201d Cashin said in a note.\n\nThis article originally appeared on ETFTrends.com\n\nClick here to read the original article on ETFdb.com.", "description": "U.S. markets and stock ETFs declined Wednesday after a soft patch in private-sector jobs weighed on sentiment and fueled fears that the economy is making a turn for the worse.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
