Elizabeth Warren\u2019s plans to break up Big Tech to the harrowing working conditions of contract content moderators. You can read the full transcript of Zuckerberg\u2019s leaked internal Facebook Q&A sessions here.\n\nZuckerberg wanted to show the world what goes on at internal Facebook Q&A sessions\n\nThe lack of previous leaks from these Q&As, which Zuckerberg has been hosting for roughly a decade now, was a source of pride for Facebook and a symbol of the trust Facebook employees have historically put in their boss. And, as Recode\u2019s Peter Kafka pointed out this week, the leak signals that the company\u2019s culture may be undergoing substantial changes as its public image continues to suffer. Earlier this year, Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin stopped showing up to the company\u2019s similar weekly town hall meetings in response to an uptick in leaks. (Zuckerberg, to his credit, said he would not stop hosting the Q&As.)\n\nIn the Q&A, Zuckerberg spoke freely about why he talks transparently with employees and the trust he believes he\u2019s built within the company, a trust that was apparently betrayed by the decision to share audio with the media. But putting that aside, Zuckerberg hosted what seemed to be a fairly standard talk that was followed by a global Q&A featuring employees for a number of remote offices.\n\nAmong the topics Zuckerberg was asked about include his thoughts on billionaires, which prompted him to share his interesting perspective that \u201cno one deserves to have that much money,\u201d and what he believes would signal that Facebook is on the decline. He was also asked again about Warren, to which he replied that he did not want to \u201ctry not to antagonize her further.\u201d He did ultimately express his view that innovation is a proper counterweight to industry consolidation.\n\nHe spoke at length about virtual and augmented reality, and he was pressed by an employee to explain his company\u2019s push toward encrypted messaging services after The New York Times reported this past week how the spread of such technology has thwarted law enforcement\u2019s ability to combat the spread of child pornography. That encryption issue in particular has caught the attention of the US Justice Department, which sent a letter today asking the company halt its efforts to create unified, encrypted messaging services.\n\nYou can watch the full Q&A session here:", "description": "Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg broke with a longstanding tradition today and decided to live stream one of his company\u2019s routine Q&A sessions he hosts with employees, ones where anyone is free and supposedly even encouraged to ask the chief executive a tough question.
