It's not that they're going anywhere\u2014we definitely all need them in our lives\u2014but they're more of a wardrobe staple than the trend that they were a few years ago. On the flip side, there's another athleisure trend that's rapidly gaining steam as of late: bike shorts.\n\nSo how do we know that bike shorts are eclipsing leggings right now? Trusted retail analytics company Edited recently released a study about current activewear trends, and in it, it named bike shorts as the trend of the season. Edited's studies show that the trend has increased by 2000% in the non-active apparel category and by 363% in the activewear category, and it credits none other than Kim Kardashian West and her parade of Yeezy looks.\n\nWe're well aware that the bike-shorts trend is even more polarizing than leggings, but we also want to point out that they're easier to wear than you'd think. Just add a blazer and a pair of sneakers or block-heel sandals, and you have yourself a winning bike-shorts outfit.
