But somehow, the girl who grew up in front of Australia as Sally Fletcher on Home And Away leapfrogged the post-childhood fame limbo to establish herself as a bona fide radio star, one-third of Nova\u2019s Kate, Tim and Marty.\n\nThe hugely popular national drivetime show has scooped up plenty of ACRAs, but the 2018 prize marked Ritchie\u2019s first solo gong.\n\nIt also smashed any shadow of doubt over whether Ritchie had cemented her place in the industry.\n\nIt\u2019s something she\u2019s grappled with since picking up her first radio shift at Nova in 2007, partnering with then-drive presenter Akmal Saleh.\n\nThat on-air stint was relatively short-lived (she was replaced by comedian Cal Wilson in May) but it put her on the radio map.\n\n\u201cIn some ways I\u2019ve always felt like a visitor here in this world, but the more things that continue to happen with Kate, Tim and Marty, where we continue to go from strength to strength \u2026 there are all these signs that the universe is telling me maybe I\u2019m not just visiting,\u201d she told news.com.au after winning the ACRA in 2018.\n\nBut the road to success hasn\u2019t been without its dramas for the award-winning presenter, who almost blew her on-air chances with a failed TV gamble.\n\nHOME AND AWAY\n\nRitchie grew up in front of Australia from the age of eight as Sally Fletcher on Home And Away, quickly becoming one of the most familiar faces on TV.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember what it was like to go to school or go to the supermarket or go anywhere and not be approached by strangers or pointed at,\u201d she told ABC\u2019s Australian Story in 2008.\n\n\u201cSome days that doesn\u2019t bother me, you know, and I can talk to everyone and I\u2019ll say hello and I\u2019ll be at the butchers. But there are other days where I can get in the car and go to the supermarket and then I don\u2019t get out of the car and I come home, because I just can\u2019t do it.\u201d\n\nTwenty years and two Gold Logies later \u2014 and after jointly breaking the Guinness World Record for longest continuous role in an Aussie drama series \u2014 Ritchie finally said farewell to Summer Bay in 2008.\n\nIt was a bold move \u2014 but the actress \u201cwanted a challenge\u201d.\n\n\u201cI wanted to feel scared and I wanted to feel like I didn\u2019t know what I was doing and I wanted someone to teach me something,\u201d she told Australian Story.\n\n\u201cI always knew I could do something else but now I\u2019m trying to prove it. I\u2019m not just that girl on Home And Away.\u201d\n\nLIFE AFTER SUMMER BAY\n\nWhen Wilson took over from Ritchie on Nova\u2019s drive show in 2007, it was reported that the actress was struggling to juggle her TV and radio commitments \u2014 at that point, she was yet to quit Home And Away.\n\nBut after finally ditching Sally Fletcher, Ritchie again set her sights on radio.\n\nIn early 2008, she was named as Nova 96.9\u2019s new breakfast show co-host, alongside Merrick Watts and Tim \u201cRosso\u201d Ross.\n\nDuring that time, she kept one foot in the acting pool, picking up the role of Judi Kane in season two of Underbelly.\n\nNearly two years after joining the radio show, Ritchie announced in November 2009 that she was quitting Merrick, Rosso and Kate to return to her acting roots and star in Nine\u2019s new police drama Cops L.A.C.\n\nIt was a risky move \u2014 and one that unfortunately didn\u2019t pay off. The series flopped and was cancelled after just one season.\n\nIt led to a quiet few years on the job front for Ritchie. She narrated Channel 10\u2019s Don\u2019t Tell The Bride before heading back to Home And Away to reprise the role of Sally in 2013 to commemorate the show\u2019s 25th anniversary, and was an occasional fill-in host on Nova.\n\nBut then came arguably the most significant career turn of her adult life.\n\nIn November 2013, it was announced that Ritchie would replace Meshel Laurie on Nova\u2019s drive show, co-hosting with Marty Sheargold and Tim Blackwell. As Ritchie said at the time, it was her \u201cdream job\u201d.\n\nKATE, TIM & MARTY\n\nSix years on, and the Kate, Tim and Marty show is the number one drive show in the country (if you want to know why they\u2019re so popular, news.com.au reporter Andrew Bucklow broke it down a few years back).\n\nIn the world of radio, where longevity is often elusive, it\u2019s no small feat that the trio \u2014 who refuse to interview celebrities and have admitted to mostly winging it \u2014 have managed to stay on top of the game.\n\nEspecially for Ritchie, whose leap to radio has been nothing short of a smashing success.\n\n\u201cI am proud of what I have achieved throughout this radio adventure of mine,\u201d she told news.com.au in 2018. \u201cI certainly haven\u2019t mastered it but I have learnt a great deal both on and off the air and Nova keep asking me back so I must be doing something night.\u201d", "description": "Just over a year ago, Kate Ritchie pulled off an incredible career feat.", "authors": ["Bronte Coy"], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/26ebd10aac409c54d5ec47a4f24ceffc?width=650", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
