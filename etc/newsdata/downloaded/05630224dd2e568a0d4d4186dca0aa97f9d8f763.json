(AP) - No. 1 Alabama and No. 2 LSU are in the process of turning long-held perceptions of the Southeastern Conference upside down.\n\nThey are the highest-scoring teams in the nation at the midway point of this college football season. That should shatter any lingering notions that the SEC features stifling defense and ball-control offenses heavy on smash-mouth runs.\n\n\u201cIf you tell a guy to go huddle, you\u2019d have to explain what a huddle is nowadays,\u201d LSU coach Ed Orgeron joked this week while discussing a transformation in his offense, which has produced a nation\u2019s best 52.5 points per game this season for the unbeaten Tigers (6-0).\n\nNo. 1 Alabama (6-0) is averaging 51 points per game, slightly ahead of Oklahoma (50.2) for second nationally.\n\nThese are the same two teams that famously played to a 9-6 struggle won by LSU in 2011 - an overtime game in which not one touchdown was scored by either team. And the SEC is the conference that as recently as 2008 had a 3-2 final score - albeit in bad weather - with Auburn edging Mississippi State.\n\nGiven the cyclical nature of football, perhaps the SEC will see such results again someday. But probably not in the near future.\n\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s trying to evolve to be more open, spread, distribute the ball,\u201d said Florida defensive coordinator Todd Grantham, who last weekend saw LSU gain 511 total yards in a 42-28 victory over the Gators. \u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019re probably looking relative to five years ago probably numbers are up as far as offensive production and things like that.\n\n\u201cPeople are trying to find ways to get players balls in space and they\u2019re doing a good job with it. So as a defense, you\u2019ve got to continue to work and understand what\u2019s happening and find a way to get stops.\u201d\n\nWhile Orgeron was a former defensive lineman in college and spent much of his career as a defensive assistant, he was convinced when he came to LSU that an up-tempo spread was the offense of the future, and that the Tigers had to adopt it to compete for SEC and national titles. That wasn\u2019t simply because of schematic advantages on the field. There\u2019s also the matter of using a scheme that appeals to elite recruits.\n\n\u201cI do believe in order for us to get where we want to go, first of all we had to change our scheme to score more points,\u201d Orgeron said. \u201cIn recruiting, that\u2019s where the guys want to be. \u2026 They all played in this offense in high school.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good change. It goes to show you the shift that\u2019s in the SEC. It\u2019s the spread. It\u2019s the quarterback,\u201d Orgeron added. \u201cThey\u2019ve got great athletes and they\u2019ve got great coaches coaching them.\u201d\n\nAlabama coach Nick Saban was quick to point out that the SEC has had prolific offenses well before this most recent trend, such as Steve Spurrier\u2019s \u201cFun \u2018N Gun\u201d scheme with Florida, or Tennessee\u2019s aerial attack when Peyton Manning was behind center.\n\nBut those appear to have been more exceptions than the norm in a conference that did not have a single quarterback taken in the first round of the NFL draft between 1976 and 1994, and hasn\u2019t had two first-round QBs in the same year since 1952 (Vanderbilt\u2019s Billy Wade and Kentucky\u2019s Babe Parilli).\n\nThat streak seems bound to end next spring when LSU\u2019s Joe Burrow and Alabama\u2019s Tua Tagovailoa - both currently seen as Heisman Trophy hopefuls - will be eligible for the NFL draft. Burrow, who\u2019s completed 79.6 percent of his passes for 2,157 yards and 25 TDs, is on pace to break LSU single-season passing records for yards and touchdowns, among others.\n\nSaban said LSU\u2019s coaching staff - as well as some others in the SEC - have \u201cdone a great job of featuring the talent they have relative to the offensive system that they run.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve kind of changed how we do things here relative to the players that we have,\u201d Saban continued. \u201cIt starts always with the quarterback. So I think when you do that, you\u2019ve got the opportunity for more explosive plays.\u201d\n\nTennessee coach Jeremy Pruitt was Alabama\u2019s defensive backs coach during the Tide\u2019s low-scoring 2011 tilt with LSU.\n\n\u201cYou can look over for a bunch of years there at LSU. They\u2019ve always had great skill players. They\u2019ve just had a certain way they chose to play,\u201d Pruitt said. \u201cSame way in Tuscaloosa. There was a certain mindset of how they wanted to play the game and win the football game, and they had success.\u201d\n\nBut this weekend he\u2019s preparing for an Alabama offense averaging 536.8 yards per game, including 366 through the air.\n\n\u201cThey definitely have a lot of playmakers. It\u2019s given them an opportunity to recruit some of the best skilled players in the country based off how they\u2019ve played,\u201d Pruitt said. \u201cGood players want to play with good players.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writers Steve Megargee in Knoxville, Tennessee; Mark Long in Gainesville, Florida; and John Zenor in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "No. 1 Alabama and No. 2 LSU are in the process of turning long-held perceptions of the Southeastern Conference upside down.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Brett Martel"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/07/utah_st_lsu_football_33226_c0-137-3272-2045_s1200x700.jpg?89da741db1d7a12ce8aa3451bf8e5548e51bbb0f", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
