Trudeau will need the support of two smaller left-leaning parties to pull together a ruling coalition. Trudeau faced a late setback after acknowledging wearing brown-face and black-face several times years ago. Trudeau also faced allegations of bullying his former attorney general, an indigenous woman. The vote was \"a reflection of the fact that the shine has come off the Trudeau brand,\" said University of Toronto political science professor Andrew McDougall. In his victory speech, Trudeau said \"it is always possible to do better.\" [The New York Times, CNBC]\n\n2.\n\nThe Democratic-controlled House on Monday rejected a GOP proposal to censure Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), the chair of the House Intelligence Committee, for his handling of his committee's part in the impeachment inquiry of President Trump. The censure measure specifically criticized Schiff's depiction, during a Sept. 26 hearing, of the phone call in which President Trump urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a leading candidate for the Democratic nomination to challenge Trump in the 2020 election. House Democrats blocked a floor vote on the censure measure. Earlier in the day, Trump had called for his fellow Republicans to \"get tougher and fight\" the impeachment proceedings. [The Washington Post]\n\n3.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday that he had failed in his effort to form a governing coalition following a near tie in last month's elections. Israeli President Reuven Rivlin said he would let Netanyahu's rival, former Army Chief of staff Benny Gantz, try to pull together a ruling coalition. Gantz, leader of the centrist Blue and White Party, will have 28 days to see if he can succeed where Netanyahu, leader of the conservative Likud party, failed. \"This broadens the political imagination to include the possibility that someone not named Netanyahu could be the prime minister of the state of Israel,\" said Mordechai Kreminitzer, senior fellow at the Israel Democracy Institute. \"But I think Gantz will also find it extremely difficult to shape a coalition.\" [The Washington Post]\n\n4.\n\nSouth Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg surged into third place in the Democratic field in a new Iowa poll, close behind former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Calif.) in the first-in-the-nation caucus state. Biden led the pack with the support of 18 percent of likely Democratic caucus-goers in the Suffolk University/USA Today poll, which was released Monday. Warren trailed just behind him with 17 percent, while Buttigieg received the backing of 13 percent of the respondents. He had just 6 percent in a similar poll in June. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) trailed with 9 percent. Billionaire Tom Steyer, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii), Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) picked up 3 percent support. Twenty-nine percent remained undecided. [Politico]\n\n5.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson is pushing for Parliament to approve his Brexit deal on Tuesday in what he has called a \"do or die\" moment ahead of Britain's scheduled Oct. 31 departure from the European Union. House of Commons Speaker John Bercow rejected his call for a Monday vote. Bercow said Johnson's Monday request was essentially the same as one Parliament rejected Saturday. \"The house should not be continually bombarded with the requirement to consider the same matter over and over and over again,\" Bercow said. Lawmakers want more time to review the deal Johnson reached with the EU, which hasn't responded to a request for an extension Johnson was legally obliged to make after missing a deadline for winning Parliament's approval. [USA Today, The Washington Post]\n\n6.\n\nResidents of a Kurdish-controlled city threw rocks and potatoes at a caravan of departing U.S. troops, shouting at the military vehicles as they passed on the way to crossing the border from Syria into Iraq. \"Like rats, America is running away,\" one man shouted in a video distributed by the Kurdish news agency. More than 100 U.S. military vehicles left Syrian Kurdish territory as the U.S. withdrew most of the 1,000 U.S. personnel who fought alongside the Kurds against the Islamic State. President Trump decided to pull out the U.S. forces, clearing the way for Turkey to launch an offensive to take control of Kurdish-dominated areas along its border. Turkey considers the Kurdish forces terrorists. Trump reportedly is considering leaving 200 troops to guard oil fields.
