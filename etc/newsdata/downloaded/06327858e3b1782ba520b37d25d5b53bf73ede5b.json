The fire started when trash being hauled caught fire and the driver dumped the load aside a road, according to Riverside County officials. An 89-year-old woman, Lois Arvickson, is missing, according to her son.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom criticized PG&E and ordinary customers complained about the inconveniences caused by the unprecedented blackouts that began midweek, with many wondering: Did the utility go too far in its attempt to ward off more deadly fires? Could it have been more targeted in deciding whose electricity was turned off and when?\n\nPG&E, though, suggested it was already seeing the wisdom of its decision borne out as gusts topping 77 mph (122 kph) raked the San Francisco Bay Area amid a bout of dry, windy weather.\n\n\u201cWe have found multiple cases of damage or hazards\u201d caused by heavy winds, including fallen branches that came in contact with overhead lines, said Sumeet Singh, a vice president for the utility. \u201cIf they were energized, they could\u2019ve ignited.\u201d\n\nBecause of the dangerous weather in the forecast, PG&E cut power Wednesday to an estimated 2 million people in an area that spanned the San Francisco Bay Area, the wine country north of San Francisco, the agricultural Central Valley and the Sierra Nevada foothills. By Thursday evening, the weather had eased and the number of people in the dark was down to about 510,000.\n\nInspections and repairs were expected to resume at daybreak and power could be restored Friday to many more customers, Singh said.\n\nPG&E cast the blackouts as a matter of public safety, aimed at preventing the kind of blazes that have killed scores of people over the past couple of years, destroyed thousands of homes, and ran up tens of billions of dollars in claims that drove the company into bankruptcy.\n\nCEO Bill Johnson didn\u2019t respond to Newsom\u2019s criticisms but promised if future wind events require similar shut-offs, the utility will \u201cdo better\u201d when it comes to communicating with customers. It\u2019s unacceptable that its websites crashed, maps were inconsistent and call centers were overloaded, Johnson said.\n\n\u201cWe were not adequately prepared,\u201d he said.\n\nMany of those affected by the outages, which could last as long as five days, were not so sure about the move.\n\nSergio Vergara, owner of Stinson Beach Market, situated on scenic Highway 1, on the Pacific Coast just north of San Francisco, operated the store with a propane generator so his customers could have coffee, milk, meat and frozen meals.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m telling you as a plain human being, there is no wind, there is no heat,\u201d he said. \u201cWe never saw something like this where they just decide to shut off the power, but on the other side - preventing is a good thing, but it\u2019s creating a lot of frustration.\u201d\n\nBut in powered-down Oakland, Tianna Pasche said: \u201cIf it saves a life, I\u2019m not going to complain about it.\u201d\n\nFaced with customer anger, PG&E put up barricades around its San Francisco headquarters. A customer threw eggs at a PG&E office in Oroville. And a PG&E truck was hit by a bullet, though authorities could not immediately say whether it was targeted.\n\nThe governor said PG&E was to blame for poor management and should have been working on making its power system sturdier and more weatherproof.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s decisions that were not made that is leading to this moment in PG&E history,\u201d Newsom said. \u201cThis is not from my perspective a climate change story so much as it is a story of greed and mismanagement over the course of decades.\u201d\n\nMarybel Batjer, president of the California Public Utilities Commission, blasted PG&E\u2019s communication and said the situation was unacceptable.\n\nExperts say the big shut-off will yield important lessons for the next time.\n\nDeliberate blackouts are likely to become less disruptive as PG&E gets experience managing them and rebuilds sections of the grid so that outages can be more targeted, said Michael Wara, a researcher on energy and climate policy at Stanford University.\n\nGrids are built and operators are trained to keep the power on at all times, so the company and its employees have little experience with intentionally turning the electricity off in response to rapidly changing weather, he said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a skill that has to be learned, and PG&E is learning it at a mass scale right now,\u201d Wara said.\n\nAfter a June shut-off in the Sierra foothills, PG&E workers reported repairing numerous areas of wind damage, including power lines hit by tree branches.\n\n\u201cThat was worth it,\u201d Wara said of the deliberate blackout. \u201cThat could have prevented a catastrophe.\u201d\n\n___\n\nCooper reported from Phoenix.
