We\u2019ll look at how we need to play and what the opposition are going to bring to the party, then we\u2019ll decide on selection.\u2019\n\nThe next day, Jones and his senior assistant, John Mitchell, were in attendance to see South Africa edge past Wales courtesy of a try by their powerful inside centre, Damian de Allende.\n\nThis prompted speculation England would revert to the midfield combination of Farrell, Tuilagi and Henry Slade, as they had for the quarter-final win over Australia in Oita.\n\nHead coach Jones is boosted by the expected recovery of Farrell (pictured) for Saturday\n\nThat was deemed a horses-for-courses selection to counter the threat of the imposing Wallaby centre, Samu Kerevi.\n\nHowever, Kerevi weighs 15lb more than De Allende and England\u2019s coaches will be mindful of the need to combat the Springboks\u2019 tactical kicking game. Ford has been exceptional in that department in this tournament.\n\nMeanwhile, it is understood that England have been fined a four-figure sum by World Rugby for their \u2018V\u2019 formation response to the haka five days ago.", "description": "CHRIS FOY IN TOKYO: Eddie Jones\u00a0is poised to retain the creative alliance of George Ford and Owen Farrell in England's backline for the World Cup final against South Africa on Saturday.", "authors": ["Chris Foy For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/20/20345438-0-image-a-7_1572381652916.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
