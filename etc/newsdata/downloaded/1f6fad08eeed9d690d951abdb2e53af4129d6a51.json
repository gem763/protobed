It produces 3.3 million tonnes of it annually.\n\nRestaurants from around the world have been taking part in the Al Dente Festival, a week-long event that culminates with the awareness day.\n\nThe festival and the dishes produced are organised around themes. \"Ethical\" focuses on vegetable dishes and sustainability, while \"different\" looks at how to cook with various types of pasta including spelt and kamut. \"Traditional\" deals exclusively with tomato sauces.\n\nRome's Alfredo alla Scrofa restaurant chose the \"classic\" theme. The eatery claims to be the birthplace of fettuccine Alfredo and for the festival it is remaining faithful to the tradition, which dates back more than 100 years.\n\nOwner Mario Mozzetti said this is essential in order to build for the future.\n\nHe said: \"Roots are what the present and the future are made of. That is what made us famous all over the world.\n\n\"From this point, we are able to create, we can become artists, we can compose and in this way, we can also meet today's demands, such as for organic and gluten-free food. In my opinion, the future will be to carefully follow the demands of a specific diet, Mediterranean or not. We can absolutely meet [these demands] with the concept of pasta.\"\n\nWorld Pasta Day is organised by Italy's food union and the International Pasta Organisation.", "description": "Did you know that Italy produces 3.3 million tonnes of pasta every year?", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/25/81/36/1000x563_cmsv2_73f79f6d-d380-50a8-8283-662650ed36bd-4258136.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
