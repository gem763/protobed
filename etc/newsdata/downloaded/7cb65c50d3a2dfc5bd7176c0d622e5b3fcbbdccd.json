That top-line benefit increase \u2015 along with an assortment of other benefit improvements \u2015 would lift an estimated 4.9 million people out of poverty, according to an independent analysis of the plan conducted by Mark Zandi, the chief economist of Moody\u2019s Analytics, which Warren\u2019s campaign released alongside the proposal.\n\nHer plan finances the changes by increasing taxes on the 2% of Americans making $250,000 a year or more. The additional revenue is enough to push back the date of the program\u2019s impending funding gap from 2035 to 2054, according to Zandi.\n\n\u201cWe need to get our priorities straight,\u201d Warren wrote in a Medium post outlining the plan. \u201cWe should be increasing Social Security benefits and asking the richest Americans to contribute their fair share to the program.\u201d\n\nNic Antaya/Boston Globe viaGetty Images Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) frames her plan to increase Social Security benefits as part of a career-long commitment to consumer advocacy rooted in her legal research.\n\nWarren\u2019s reform plan would also switch the program to a more generous cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) formula to account for seniors\u2019 health care costs, resulting in higher year-over-year benefit growth. The additional $200 a month that beneficiaries would receive would become part of a base benefit subject to the new COLA formula, which is designed to insulate benefits from the effects of inflation.\n\nAnd in addition to the proposed across-the-board benefits, Warren calls for targeted benefit increases that aim to shore up some of the most vulnerable populations.\n\nMany of the provisions have been in other recent progressive Social Security reform proposals. She would, for example, establish a special minimum benefit of 125% of the federal poverty level; allow caregivers of young children, seniors or people with disabilities to count caregiving work toward their earnings; reinstate and expand on the defunct \u201cstudent benefit\u201d enabling the children of a deceased worker to receive cash payments through the age of 24 if they pursue a higher education; and eliminate an obscure penalty on select state and local government employees who received some pension benefits in lieu of Social Security.\n\nWarren\u2019s plan to finance the higher Social Security benefits \u2015 and patch up the program\u2019s funding gap in the process \u2015 also builds on elements already in circulation. Unlike some other progressive reform plans, though, she maintains present tax rates for workers earning $250,000 a year or less.\n\nCurrently, American workers contribute payroll taxes into Social Security on the first $132,900 that they earn each year, leaving the incomes of higher earners untouched. Warren would create a new payroll tax bracket on earnings over $250,000, including investment income not currently taxed for Social Security. Her plan would subject that income to a 7.4% tax on the employee and the employer both (14.8% total) while maintaining the 6.2% rate on income below the current taxable maximum.\n\nBut what distinguishes Warren\u2019s plan from other recent reform proposals, including Rep. John Larson\u2019s Social Security 2100 Act and Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 Social Security Expansion Act, is the simplicity and universality of its across-the-board increase. The additional flat dollar amount would make it less abstract than the more technical changes in other proposals, such as modifications to the benefit formula.\n\nIt\u2019s the additional $200 a month above all that gives Warren license to claim that her plan offers \u201cthe biggest and most progressive increase in Social Security benefits in nearly half a century.\u201d And, as with her plan to cancel most Americans\u2019 student debt, Warren has created an online calculator for people to see how their Social Security benefits would change under her plan.\n\nIn the Medium post, Warren documented in detail the growing importance of Social Security as a source of retirement income in light of slow wage growth and the decline of defined-benefit pensions. Among workers approaching retirement \u2015 ages 50 to 64 \u2015 the average 401(k) balance is less than $15,000, Warren noted. As a result, Social Security provides 90% of the income for 1 in 4 senior households, and a majority of the income for at least half of those households.\n\nOne thing is clear: it\u2019s getting harder to save enough for a decent retirement. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)\n\nWarren framed her decision to back a major expansion of Social Security benefits as part of a larger commitment to fighting for consumers and struggling families that dates back to her days as a bankruptcy law expert.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve dedicated most of my career to studying what\u2019s happening to working families in America,\u201d she wrote. \u201cOne thing is clear: it\u2019s getting harder to save enough for a decent retirement.\u201d\n\nAs with the cause of adopting a \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d single-payer health care system, Warren is typically less closely associated with grassroots efforts to defend and expand Social Security than Sanders, her closest ideological counterpart in the Democratic presidential primary field. Sanders led opposition to then-President Barack Obama\u2019s efforts to reduce Social Security benefits as part of a \u201cgrand bargain\u201d with Republicans prior to Warren\u2019s arrival in the Senate.\n\nBut after Warren took office in 2013, she quickly became a pivotal figure in progressive efforts to reorient the Social Security debate from one centered on alarmism about the program\u2019s finances to a discussion of the role it could play in addressing a growing retirement income crisis. In a speech on the Senate floor in November 2013, Warren made the case for expanding Social Security benefits, sparking criticism from Third Way that resulted in several members of Congress distancing themselves from the business-friendly think tank.\n\nMany Social Security advocates regard the speech \u2015 and the response it evoked \u2015 as a key turning point in the public debate on Social Security. She subsequently sponsored a nonbinding budget amendment in March 2015 calling for \u201csustainable expansion\u201d of Social Security benefits; all but two of the Senate Democrats present voted in favor.\n\nWarren \u201cis a powerful leader in the movement to expand Social Security,\u201d said Nancy Altman, a co-founder of the nonprofit Social Security Works, which has been working with Warren on the issue since her first Senate campaign. \u201cAll Americans owe her a debt of gratitude for standing up for our Social Security system.\u201d\n\nThe greatest political vulnerabilities of Warren\u2019s plan are its failure to fully close Social Security\u2019s long-term funding gap and its expansion of benefits for all workers, not just those with the greatest needs. Larson\u2019s bill, for example, would extend Social Security\u2019s solvency for the entirety of the 75-year outlook that the program\u2019s actuaries examine.\n\nBut Warren is not the first progressive Social Security advocate to chafe under the program\u2019s 75-year outlook. Aside from Medicare Part A, Hospital Insurance, there are few if any major government programs required to plan so far into the future.\n\nAnd when it comes to the effect of her proposed reforms on the neediest in the population, Warren can point to ample evidence that her plan is weighted toward those with the least. Benefits would increase for workers in the bottom half of the earnings scale by 25% on average, while the top 10th of workers would see their benefits increase by less than 5%, according to the analysis conducted by Zandi of Moody\u2019s Analytics.", "description": "Her latest plan would give current and future retirees $200 more a month.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d79b962240000c92b7826f2.jpeg?cache=efd9nryxbv&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
