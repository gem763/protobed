But the prospect terrifies me, and it should terrify you, too.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that it\u2019s the wrong move. Arguably, it\u2019s the only move, at least in terms of fidelity to the Constitution and to basic decency. From the moment that Trump stepped into the office of the presidency, he has degraded it \u2014 with words that a president has no business speaking (or tweeting); with ceaseless lies; with infantile and often unhinged behavior; with raging conflicts of interest; with managerial ineptitude; with a rapacious ego that\u2019s never sated; and with foreign dealings that compromise America\u2019s values, independence and interests. How can principled lawmakers not tell him, in the most emphatic manner available, that enough is enough?\n\nBut there\u2019s no way to say what happens now that a formal impeachment inquiry is being opened. None. You\u2019re going to hear a lot in coming days and weeks about Bill Clinton, but using the example of his impeachment in late 1998 is a bit ridiculous: He was a very different president accused of very different offenses at a very different time. Besides which, political analysts who do cite it don\u2019t agree on the lessons. So a pundit making confident predictions about the political fallout from the impeachment of Trump is a pundit far out on a slender limb.\n\nAny scenario is possible, including one in which impeachment redounds to Trump\u2019s benefit and increases the chances of his re-election, because he paints himself a martyr, eludes conviction in the Senate, frames that as exoneration and watches his fans mobilize and turn out as never before. And a second Trump term wouldn\u2019t just be the sadly suboptimal byproduct of a noble stand; it would be disastrous. Morally as well as practically, limiting this unfit, amoral, unsteady man\u2019s time in the presidency takes precedence over any small cluster of sentences written centuries ago.\n\nSign Up For the Morning Briefing Newsletter\n\nBut while an impeachment\u2019s impact on November 2020 is unknowable, its effect on us as a nation is almost certain. A dangerously polarized and often viciously partisan country would grow more so, with people on opposing sides hunkering down deeper in their camps and clinging harder to their chosen narratives as the president \u2014 concerned only with himself \u2014 ratcheted up his insistence that truth itself was subjective and up for grabs.\n\nThat\u2019s not a reason to blink, but it\u2019s a reality to brace for. At a juncture when we so desperately need to rediscover common ground, we\u2019d be widening the fault lines. Bringing the country together afterward would call for more than a talented politician; it would demand a miracle worker. None of the Democratic presidential candidates qualify.\n\nImpeachment should terrify you because it would mean a continued, relentless, overwhelming focus on Trump\u2019s lawlessness, antics, fictions and inane tweets. He would win in the short term \u2014 and all Americans would lose \u2014 because as long as most of the oxygen in Washington is consumed by the ghastly carnival of this barker, there\u2019s too little left for the nation\u2019s very real problems and for scrutiny of his substantive inadequacy in addressing them.\n\nFrom the House Republicans\u2019 persecution of Hillary Clinton through the permanent hysteria of House Democrats under Trump, Washington has devolved ever further into a place where process muscles out progress, grandstanding eclipses governing and noise muffles any meaningful signal. To be engaged in politics is to be engaged in battle \u2014 and that shouldn\u2019t and needn\u2019t always be so.\n\nWhere\u2019s the infrastructure plan that we\u2019re \u2014 oh \u2014 a quarter-century late in implementing? Where are the fixes to a health care system whose problems go far beyond the tens of millions of Americans still uninsured? What about education? Impeachment would shove all of those issues even further to the margins than they already are.\n\nDuring the Democratic primary and then the general election, the Trump melodrama and the Trump spectacle would overshadow all else. And many Americans\u2019 estrangement from Washington \u2014 their cynicism about its ability to improve their lives even a whit \u2014 would intensify.\n\nThat could be all the more true on account of their confusion. If you\u2019re favorably disposed toward Trump and receptive to his claims of persecution, you\u2019ve watched the meticulous and drawn-out work of Robert Mueller, you\u2019ve noticed a seemingly nonstop schedule of Capitol Hill hearings and of star witnesses (Michael Cohen, Mueller, Bill Barr, Corey Lewandowski), and you thought that the House Judiciary Committee was already doing an impeachment inquiry. The latest developments strike you as \u201cGroundhog Day\u201d on the Potomac.\n\nIf you\u2019re horribly offended and utterly exhausted by Trump, you\u2019re tempted to cheer impeachment as long-sought justice and prayed-for release and forget that it\u2019s just the prelude to the main act, which is a trial in the Senate. That chamber is controlled by Republicans, who, based on current conditions, are as likely to convict Trump as they are to co-sponsor Elizabeth Warren\u2019s wealth tax. So Trump\u2019s supporters would wind up furious that he was put through what they regarded as an overwrought exercise with a foregone conclusion, while the frustration of Trump\u2019s detractors would be exponentially multiplied. Let the healing begin!\n\nAnd would impeachment proceedings effectively lay bare \u2014 and force Americans to focus on \u2014 sins of Trump\u2019s that are being ignored? That\u2019s long been one of Democrats\u2019 arguments for impeachment, but I wonder. For starters, some of the hearings to date \u2014 Lewandowski\u2019s in particular \u2014 raise questions about their ability to pry loose what they want from witnesses and isolate the damning evidence amid the ambient vitriol. But more than that, there has been such saturation coverage of Trump that many voters may not be able to stomach it any more, and today\u2019s political tribalism doesn\u2019t allow for all that much in the way of epiphanies and transformations. Trump\u2019s true colors were conspicuous from the start. You either saw a perverse rainbow or you stared into darkness.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump. How vulnerable will drawn-out impeachment proceedings make him feel? How impotent? How desperate? To flex his power, vent his fury or distract the audience, what would he do? He\u2019s untethered by scruple. He\u2019s capable of anything. Maybe it\u2019s not just a culture war that he\u2019d whip up. Maybe it\u2019s the real thing.\n\nCertainly he\u2019d do all he could to persuade Americans of the nefariousness of Democrats, and absolutely his strategy would be to smear the people, the procedures and the institutions arrayed against him as utterly unworthy of trust. If holding on to power meant ruling over rubble, so be it. Trump is beholden only to Trump, and he\u2019d simply declare the rubble gold dust.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.
