Awesome Burgers come in a two-pack of patties and they\u2019ll be sold at supermarkets around the country\u2014including Wegmans, FredMeyer, Safeway, Stop & Shop, HyVee, and more\u2014starting October 1.\n\nIn case you\u2019re having trouble keeping track of all the faux meat options out there, this is the third big plant-based burger launch in recent months, joining Impossible Burgers and Beyond Burgers.\n\nWhat is the Awesome Burger made of?\n\nThe big ingredient is textured pea protein (Beyond Burger is also made with a pea protein isolate). Other than that, it has water, coconut oil, wheat gluten, canola oil, vinegar, corn starch, salt, and a few other ingredients.\n\nAwesome Burger nutrition\n\nPhoto credit: Sweet Earth Foods More\n\nAs for nutrition, a quarter-pound patty contains the following:\n\nCalories: 260\n\nFat: 15 grams\n\nSaturated fat: 7 grams\n\nSodium: 400 milligrams\n\nCarbohydrates: 9 grams\n\nFiber: 6 grams\n\nProtein: 26 grams\n\nIs the Awesome Burger healthy?\n\nIt\u2019s not bad. \u201cOverall I think Nestl\u00e9 did a great job with this burger by offering a healthy plant-based option,\u201d says Keri Gans, RDN, author of The Small Change Diet. \u201cMost impressive is that it provides 6 grams of fiber per patty, an important nutrient that most people don\u2019t consume enough of in their daily diets.\u201d\n\nThat said, this is \u201cvery highly processed,\u201d points out Karen Ansel, RDN, co-author of Healthy in a Hurry. \u201cThe fact that it\u2019s 100 percent plant-based makes it seem like it\u2019s healthy, but if you take a deeper dive into the nutrition stats and the ingredient list, you\u2019ll see that most of its fat comes from coconut oil, which (despite its health halo) is still filled with saturated fat,\u201d she says. \u201cIt also contains a fair amount of sodium.\u201d\n\nFrom a nutritional standpoint \u201cit looks a lot like a lean burger,\u201d says dietitian Scott Keatley, RD, of Keatley Medical Nutrition Therapy, and he agrees that it has great fiber content. \u201cHowever, this burger packs a lot more sodium than your traditional beef burger and what may be most lacking is vitamin B12 and iron, which are essential for red blood cells that do, well, just about everything in your body,\u201d he says.\n\nWhile the burger is plant-based, the ingredients are \u201cbroken down, pulverized, and mixed together\u201d and \u201cmay not deliver the same health benefits,\u201d Ansel says.\n\nHowever, nutrition is not the only factor here. If you\u2019re looking to cut back on how much red meat you eat (for environmental or other ethical reasons) while still enjoying a burger, Gans says this is a good option. She recommends topping it with avocado, tomato, lettuce, and onion on a 100 percent whole grain bun to max out the health benefits.\n\nBut overall, Keatley says you should treat this (and other plant-based burgers) like a burger. \u201cFor every nutrient you gain, you lose others,\u201d he says. \u201cBut give it a try. If you love the taste, then add them into your burger rotation. But if the taste leaves you wanting the beef burger, it\u2019s okay to go back.\u201d\n\nLike what you just read?
