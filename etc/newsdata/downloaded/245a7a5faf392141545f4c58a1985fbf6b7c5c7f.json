The two parties entered the parliamentary and presidential elections in an alliance last year, which allowed them to attain a majority in parliament together.\n\nTurkey\u2019s Foreign Ministry said on Sunday it had summoned the U.S. Charge d\u2019Affaires to the ministry and requested an \u201copen and clear\u201d explanation regarding the issue.\n\nThe AK Party said on Twitter that the user who had posted the message was wanted for links to the network of Fethullah Gulen, which Ankara says orchestrated the abortive coup in July 2016.\n\nOmer Celik, spokesman for the AK Party, said the U.S. State Department and Embassy needed to investigate the issue and an apology would not suffice.\n\n\u201cIt shows that some people employed in the Embassy are making a special effort to damage the relations between the two countries,\u201d Celik said on Twitter.\n\n\u201cThe United States Embassy needs to try to understand Turkey not through people linked with terrorist organisations but through people who can conduct proper analysis,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Embassy posted an apology on Twitter late on Saturday.\n\n\u201cEarlier today our Embassy Twitter account \u201cliked\u201d an unrelated post in error. We regret the mistake and apologise for any confusion,\u201d it said. The like was also removed from the Embassy\u2019s page.\n\nSemih Yalcin, deputy head of the MHP, said on Twitter late on Saturday that Bahceli has recovered from his illness and would return to work in the coming week.\n\nThe relations between the NATO allies have been under pressure in recent years over a range of issues, including Turkey\u2019s purchase of Russian S-400 missile defence systems, differences in policy in Syria and the detention of local U.S. consulate employees and citizens in Turkey.", "description": "Turkey summoned a top U.S. diplomat to its foreign ministry on Sunday, a day after the U.S. Embassy's Twitter account liked a tweet regarding Devlet Bahceli, the leader of the nationalist party who has recently fallen ill.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191006&t=2&i=1437650139&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF9505U", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
