We still have a lot of unanswered questions,\" Hartstra said.\n\nThe mother of the children was believed to have died before the family moved to the Dutch farm in 2010, De Groot told reporters. None of the family members was registered as a resident with the municipality, the police statement said.\n\n\n\n\n\nREMOTE SPOT\n\nThe farm is located on a secluded plot of land on the outskirts of the village. Residents were surprised that anyone could have been hidden away for so long in their tiny community without being noticed.\n\n\"It's possible here ... (it) is such a remote spot, in the middle of fields,\" said neighbor Roelie van Dijk. \"You see it can happen anywhere. Not only in a big city but also in the countryside. And perhaps even more in the countryside, where you can hide completely.\"\n\nVan Dijk said she and her husband had seen a man driving in and out of the property for years and doing construction work. He always kept the gates closed and never socialized, she said.\n\nHer husband Sjon said he once asked to see how the renovations were coming along, but the man yelled \"no\" and sped off.\n\n\"We tried to make contact, my husband just last week, with the man in the car...(But) he drove on. He went through the gates and locked them again.\"\n\nThe siblings had apparently lived in makeshift rooms inside the farm and survived partly on vegetables and animals from a secluded garden on the property, local TV RTV Drenthe reported.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Anthony Deutsch and Stephanie van den Berg Writing by Anthony Deutsch; Editing by Mark Heinrich)", "description": "A man who paid the rent on a Dutch farmhouse where six members of a family were found locked away in a secret room will appear in court on Thursday on charges of unlawful detention and harming others' health, prosecutors said.
