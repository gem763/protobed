If her story seems believable to the league, Brown\u2019s story will need to be more believable. And there\u2019s a chance that Brown simply won\u2019t be a good witness, regardless of whether he\u2019s telling the truth.\n\nBrown has navigated his way through plenty of delicate situations by relying heavily on a broad, electric smile. He\u2019ll need more to persuade the league that he didn\u2019t do what he is accused of doing, especially in light of messages sent to Taylor that, on their face, seem to corroborate portions of her allegations. How will he explain those? Will he be combative or belligerent when challenged with tough questions, or will he concede what he needs to concede in order to be believed as to the most important questions regarding whether he sexually assaulted or raped Taylor?\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nLast Tuesday night, Brown\u2019s lawyer issued a sweeping denial of all allegations in the civil complaint filed by Taylor. That\u2019s an unrealistic, and technically untrue, characterization of the lawsuit. While Taylor may not be telling the truth as to the most critical aspects of the lawsuit, there surely is plenty of truth contained in the complaint as it is written.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf Brown is wired to simply deny everything Taylor says, the league will need to corroborate only portions of her allegations with objective evidence to justify a full and complete rejection of his story. He\u2019ll need to be able to set aside the frustration inherent to being accused of something he believes he didn\u2019t do, and to provide calm, reasoned, and factually accurate answers.\n\nAnd make no mistake about it \u2014 the league\u2019s investigators are trained to assess credibility as to small issues in order to get a feel for credibility as to big issues. If he can be caught in a lie as to facts that don\u2019t go to the heart of the matter, it becomes far easier to assume he\u2019s not telling the truth as to the allegations that go to the core of the case.\n\nIt therefore will be incumbent on Brown\u2019s camp to get him prepared to face the interrogation to come. He\u2019s not a lawyer but a witness, and when the time comes to answer questions he needs to answer them clearly, directly, and dispassionately. If he strays into becoming an advocate for his position, he runs the risk of engaging in swordplay with the person who is questioning him instead of simply submitting to the process.\n\nThe challenge for the league becomes assessing Taylor\u2019s story from the perspective of whether she has provided enough proof to convince the Commissioner that Brown \u201cmay have violated\u201d the Personal Conduct Policy. If she has, the league will be justified in placing Brown on paid leave while the investigation proceeeds.\n\nIt\u2019s also possible that, before doing so, the league will conduct a preliminary interview with Brown aimed at confirming any suspicion that he \u201cmay have violated\u201d the policy, with a more exacting session happening after the Commissioner exercises his broad powers to take Brown off the field pending the completion of the league\u2019s work.\n\nRegardless of how it plays out, the fact that the league devoted so much time on Monday to talking to Brown\u2019s accuser shows that the matter is being taken seriously. Which suggests that the league realizes the potential damage to The Shield that comes from letting Brown play under the cloud of allegations that the league potentially finds to be credible based on a 10-hour interview of the person who is making them.\n\nIn other words, the league can at any time place Brown on the Commissioner-Exempt list. Likewise, if the Patriots become aware of evidence that gives credence to the allegations made against Brown in a civil lawsuit, the Patriots could decide to sever ties with him, without any advance warning or notice.\n\nSo even though it seems that the situation has died down, it hasn\u2019t. And the work that currently is happening outside of the view of the public could lead, sooner than later, to major decisions affecting Brown\u2019s ability to continue to play football.", "description": "The NFL reportedly has secured 10 hours of information from Britney Taylor, the woman who has accused Patriots receiver Antonio Brown of sexual assault and rape.
