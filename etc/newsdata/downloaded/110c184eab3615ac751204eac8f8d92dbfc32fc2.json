His job, believed to come with a three-year contract, will be to rebuild long before the final sledgehammer is thrown, and so to field and maintain a competitive baseball team upon a potentially unsettled foundation.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThirteen years ago, Maddon, child of the Angels, left the organization to become manager of the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. He took that young franchise to a World Series in his third season. In 2016, in the second of five seasons in Chicago, he helped engineer the Cubs\u2019 first World Series championship in more than a century.\n\nBack in Anaheim, he will discover a team that has lost its way, that has one postseason appearance in a decade, that has squandered nine seasons of Mike Trout and that also bears the scars of human loss and its possible role in that tragedy.\n\nJoe Maddon won a World Series with the Cubs in 2016.

This, today, becomes his most severe challenge, and perhaps the one that is most personal. He wore the Angels\u2019 colors as an A-ball catcher straight out of Lafayette College in Easton, Pennsylvania. He managed low- and mid-minor league Angels teams for seven seasons. He served as a big-league coach under four managers, among them the long-running Mike Scioscia. He was an interim manager when some of that went wrong. He got his first big-league managing job in his early 50s.\n\nSo, really, there would be only one man for the job, if he would have them.\n\nThe Angels fired manager Brad Ausmus after a single season, their worst in two decades, a season in which Skaggs died in a Dallas hotel room in early July. Free-agent acquisitions from the previous winter \u2014 pitchers Matt Harvey, Trevor Cahill and Cody Allen, among others \u2014 underperformed. General manager Billy Eppler goes into this winter in the final year of his contract, a period that has netted a reputedly improved farm system and little in the way of American League relevance. The Angels have not had a winning season since 2015.\n\nEight of baseball\u2019s 30 teams had managerial openings in mid-October. In that climate, and given Maddon\u2019s resum\u00e9, the Angels moved quickly. They had considered veteran managers Buck Showalter and John Farrell, among others, but their true target was the folksy and charismatic Maddon, who\u2019d been on the bench when they\u2019d won their only World Series title, in 2002. Who\u2019d grown up an Angel.\n\nHe is 65. This job could be his last. For an organization in pain and under scrutiny, that must first seek the depth of the wound before it can begin to heal, that seeks truer courses in nearly all ways, Maddon will stand on the dugout\u2019s top step. He is the right man for it. But he is a small part of the reconstruction, even as the bulldozer revs again.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "In the wake of the Tyler Skaggs tragedy, the Angels are a franchise in full-blown turmoil, and Maddon is now tasked with helping them heal.", "authors": ["Tim Brown"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Tb8l8KBVH90JLeZTcVgJGQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/jYpHdjHVu2WscMUeW7H4qA--~B/aD0yMDAwO3c9MzAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/b076efd0-f02d-11e9-a4c9-0bce808b7501", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
