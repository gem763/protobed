He needs more agents, he has a longer timeframe than they originally thought when they started this whole thing.\n\nERIC TRUMP: This corruption in D.C. is unbelievable. Again, my father said we have the greatest economy in the history of this country. Our country is doing phenomenally well. The Democrats are trying to do everything they can to distract against the fact that we have 3.5% unemployment, the lowest unemployment in the history of this nation. He has done an unbelievable job.\n\nIt\u2019s an absolute clown show. This is a clown show because they know they don\u2019t have any people left to run against my father in 2020. They know they\u2019re going to lose. Nancy Pelosi jumped the gun. She doesn\u2019t know what to do at this point. They\u2019re floundering in the wind. And honestly, I think if they keep this up, I think it\u2019s guaranteeing my father re-election. The fundraising numbers we have coming in right now are out of control.", "description": "Eric Trump called the Democrats an \"absolute clown show\" during his remarks on the formal impeachment inquiry targeting his father.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Eric-Trump-22Clown-Show22-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
