The President is finally telling the EPA that enough is enough, they must follow the law, and we appreciate that,\u201d Kevin Ross, president of the National Corn Growers Association, said in a statement.\n\nSen.

Joni Ernst: 'Whistleblowers should be protected' MORE (R-Iowa) was among the lawmakers from corn-producing states who issued statements Friday praising the proposal.\n\nBut the oil industry appeared just as unhappy as farmers were elated.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s not sugar coat it, ethanol mandates are being raised because a handful of corn-state senators have extorted it from the president using election year politics,\u201d LeAnn Johnson with the Small Refiners Coalition said in a statement.\n\nBoth the American Petroleum Institute (API), the lobby for the oil industry, and American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers, which represents oil refineries, called the proposal concerning, vowing to challenge the policy because \u201cit is by no means a win-win.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe administration is heading in the wrong direction on ethanol policy and we also believe that it\u2019s being done for all the wrong reasons, which are political and not in the best interests of our energy security,\u201d Frank Macchiarola, API\u2019s vice president of downstream and industry operations, told The Hill.\n\n\u201cWhat farmers are mad about is trade policy,\u201d he said. \u201cThis administration, as I\u2019ve said before, is trying to remedy one bad policy with another bad policy.\u201d\n\nThe oil industry has argued that many cars cannot effectively burn E15 fuel, and they are also concerned by hints from the administration that it might continue offering waivers to small refineries.\n\nThat portion of the program is viewed as problematic by farmers as well. When small refineries don\u2019t blend ethanol in, other refineries are supposed to pick up their slack. But farmers were irked that the EPA would grant exemptions and then never force other refineries to add in extra ethanol.\n\nMacchiarola said it\u2019s unfair to put that burden on refineries that are already blending in the required amounts of ethanol.\n\nWhen asked how the EPA would begin enforcing that portion of the law, an EPA official said only that it would determine that through the rulemaking process.\n\n\u2014Updated at 12:52 p.m.", "description": "The Trump administration unveiled a fuel proposal Friday that would buoy corn farmers and ethanol producers\u00a0to the detriment of the nation\u2019s oil industry.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/farm_iowa_corn_072018getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
