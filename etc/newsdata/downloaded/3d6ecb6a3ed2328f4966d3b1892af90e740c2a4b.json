Before he could finish the thought, he was subsumed by cross-talk.\n\nHalfway through Monday night's English-language leaders' debate, perhaps the single most-watched event of this fall's campaign, Trudeau was trying to draw his bottom line.\n\nBut he was beset on all sides by rivals \u2014 Conservative leader Andrew Scheer, primarily, but also NDP leader Jagmeet Singh and Green leader Elizabeth May \u2014 who were eager to deliver their own lines and trample all over his.\n\nTrudeau has fought and won his share of public contests \u2014 from real boxing to the make-believe fisticuffs of election debates. But this televised brawl \u2014 a microcosm of this election \u2014 was something else entirely, more complicated and with greater stakes.\n\nTwo weeks short of finding out whether he might be prime minister for another four years, Trudeau was challenged to simply hold his ground.\n\nHis first appeal to clarity came as a segment about Indigenous affairs wandered off into the great, overarching question of climate change.\n\nSlogans, plans and one-line zingers\n\nGiven the opportunity to ask a question of another leader, May went right at Trudeau, calling on him to adopt a more ambitious target for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n\"Targets are not a plan,\" Trudeau responded.\n\nThe Liberal plan, he insisted, was \"realistic, ambitious and doable.\"\n\n\"Your target is a commitment to failure,\" said May, who is vowing to reduce emissions by 60 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030 (as opposed to Trudeau's 30 per cent).\n\nShe then hit Trudeau on his decision to purchase the Trans Mountain pipeline, insisting that he could not be a \"climate leader\" and make that decision. Trudeau seemed ready for this.\n\n\"A slogan is not a plan,\" Trudeau said.\n\nMay insisted she had a plan. Trudeau responded that it was \"unrealizable.\"\n\nMay, who can seem flummoxed when disagreed with, momentarily seemed to agree that the Trudeau government had done more on climate change than previous governments, but then insisted that former Liberal prime minister Paul Martin had had a better plan in 2005. Trudeau quickly pointed out that the Martin government hadn't implemented that plan.\n\nIn the segment of the debate that may have featured the best one-liners, the leaders go on the offensive - and defend - plans on climate change. 3:47\n\nBut then Trudeau, who had turned to his right to address May, was suddenly hit from his left by Scheer, who was insisting that, contra Trudeau's assurances, the rebate from the federal carbon levy would not leave most Canadians better off.\n\n\"Just because you say something over and over again doesn't make it true,\" Scheer said.\n\n\"Oh, it would be nice for you to learn that, Mr. Scheer,\" Trudeau said.\n\nThere was a ripple of laughter from the audience.\n\n\"No one believes your numbers, Justin,\" Scheer said.\n\n\"You don't want to act on climate change, Mr. Scheer,\" Trudeau responded.\n\nThen Singh jumped in, telling viewers that they didn't need to choose between \"Mr. Delay\" and \"Mr. Deny.\"\n\nMore laughter.\n\nBut before the NDP leader could finish his thought, May came back to challenge Singh on his own target.\n\nThen Maxime Bernier, the People's Party leader, chimed in to claim that Scheer and Trudeau were the same on climate change.\n\n\"That's false,\" said Scheer.\n\n\"I think that's the most offensive thing you've said all night, Max,\" Trudeau quipped.\n\n\"I think he's said much more offensive things,\" Singh argued off camera.\n\nTrying to make their mark\n\nOne politician, on his or her own, tends to consume a significant amount of oxygen. Put six of them on stage and things are bound to get messy. But such is life in a multi-party democracy.\n\nWith air time at a premium, the participants seemed determined to capitalize on their moments, with most of their energies put toward explaining their complaints about how Trudeau has governed.\n\nThe home audience had only just tuned in when Scheer turned and delivered a remarkable attack on Trudeau that culminated in the Conservative leader calling the Liberal leader a \"phoney\" and a \"fraud.\"\n\nThe aggressive tack seemed like a deliberate reaction to a timid and widely panned performance last week at the TVA debate. It looked like a politician who went into this debate thinking he needed to land the fabled \"knockout punch.\"\n\nBut, in that respect, it did not suggest a politician who is confident about his standing in the polls.\n\nSingh was loose and in good spirits. When a moderator referred to him as \"Mr. Scheer,\" Singh joked that they shouldn't be easy to confuse with each other and that he'd worn an orange turban for just this reason.\n\nAfter Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau accidentally calls NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh \"Mr. Scheer,\" the real Andrew Scheer jumps to accuse Trudeau of treating small business owners as tax cheats. 0:54\n\nAt one point, three of the leaders on stage \u2014 most notably Scheer, who would benefit from the NDP taking votes away from the Liberals \u2014 took turns praising Singh's handling of issues of race in this campaign.\n\nSingh tried to position himself as the anti-elite fighter, portraying Trudeau as a politician with \"nice words\" but not enough action. May was, as always, the pleading voice of climate concern. At one point, she seemed to appeal for God to intervene to block a Liberal majority.\n\nWhile Scheer was throwing haymakers in hopes of landing something that would turn the campaign, Trudeau was mostly content to jab back in response, with periodic flourishes.\n\nThe most decisive blows in previous debates \u2014 Brian Mulroney hitting John Turner in 1984, Jack Layton flooring Michael Ignatieff in 2011 \u2014 came when the leader being attacked seemed momentarily stunned and unable to respond.\n\nTrudeau seemed to avoid such a moment \u2014 though he seems unwilling or unable to counter claims that his emissions policy for large emitters amounts to an exemption \u2014 but he still had to absorb an array of blows.\n\nThe most-passionate version of Trudeau emerged in the night's final segment, on the environment and energy. There, again, Trudeau invoked the choice he wants voters to see, between Conservatives who would rip up the current plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and Liberals who are pledged to keep going.\n\nWhen May again beseeched him to do more, Trudeau reminded her that he's currently opposed by Conservative premiers \"from the Rocky Mountains to the Bay of Fundy.\"\n\nThe clarity of that purported choice is muddled by all manner of other issues and considerations: from blackface and SNC-Lavalin to the purchase of a pipeline to unfulfilled promises, to the competing climate proposals of the Greens and NDP. All of that challenges Trudeau's preferred frame. All of it, including the bits that have nothing to do with the future of the planet, weighs on the actual choice.\n\nNothing is ever simple in a multi-party democracy. Whether it's a two-hour debate or a six-week campaign, the contest comes down to who breaks through the noise.", "description": "The leaders' debate, perhaps the most-watched event of the 2019 federal campaign, was a six-way melee that repeatedly wandered off topic as the participants sought to land that elusive knockout shot.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5312924.1570508782!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/fedelxn-campaign-20191007.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
