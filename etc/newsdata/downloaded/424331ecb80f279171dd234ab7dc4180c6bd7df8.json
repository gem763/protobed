(AP) - The Latest on Hurricane Dorian (all times local):\n\n5:20 a.m.\n\nTropical storm-force winds are ruffling southeastern Massachusetts as Hurricane Dorian continues to move north.\n\nEarly Saturday, the center of the weakening Category 1 storm was around 145 miles (233 kilometers) southeast of Nantucket, Massachusetts, and around 410 miles (660 kilometers) southwest of Halifax, Nova Scotia. The storm, which is moving at northeast at around 25 mph (40 kph), is expected to produce hurricane conditions in parts of the Canadian province later Saturday.\n\nThe Canadian Hurricane Center has adjusted its warnings for Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Quebec\u2019s Lower North Shore. A hurricane warning is in effect parts of eastern Nova Scotia and western Newfoundland and a hurricane watch is in effect for Prince Edward Island and the Magdalen Islands. A tropical storm warning is in effect for other parts of the Canadian provinces as well as portions of Massachusetts and Maine.\n\nThe storm\u2019s top sustained winds are near 85 mph (137 kph).\n\n___\n\n5:10 a.m.\n\nStranded residents of North Carolina\u2019s Outer Banks are beginning to assess the damage wrought by Hurricane Dorian.\n\nSteve Harris has lived on Ocracoke Island for most of the last 19 years. He\u2019s ridden out eight hurricanes, but he said Friday that he\u2019d never seen a storm bring such devastation to his community.\n\nHarris lost his car to the storm and his air conditioning is damaged, but he said he\u2019s blessed that his condominium is on the third floor and he is insured.\n\nThe U.S. Coast Guard began landing local law enforcement officers on the island Friday via helicopter and airlifting out the sick, elderly and others in distress.\n\nBy Friday evening, Gov.
