Whether you\u2019re packing grub for a preschool child, elementary-school kid, tween middle-schooler, or even yourself, having the right lunch box and lunch gear can streamline the process of getting a meal together, keep the leftover tofu stir-fry from leaking onto the cheddar-cheese cubes, and cut down on extra plastic and waste. But which lunch box to choose?\n\nWe asked 14 teachers, parents, and nutritionists to tell us about their favorite dishwasher-friendly lunch boxes, easy-to-open containers, and playground-proof thermoses that are best for kids of every age. And while we\u2019ve broken the lunch boxes and gear down into age groups here, most of the items here can be used by kids of any age (and adults, if you\u2019re looking for something for bringing your lunch to work).\n\nBest overall lunch box: bento-style lunch box\n\nEight of the 13 teachers and dietitians we spoke to recommended bento-style lunch boxes for kids. These boxes, which can come in a variety of materials, including stainless steel and plastic, allow parents and kids to separate their meal into a variety of smaller portions. \u201cWe see many lunch boxes and by far, the most popular seems to be the bento-box style,\u201d says Kristin Brady, director of Cobble Hill Play School, who says she uses a bento-style lunch box herself. \u201cI think the magic lies in the various different compartments \u2014 children love to make their own choices. Even if parents choose the contents, children get to choose the order [in which they eat the foods]. Some of our parents even report letting their children pick the contents for one compartment while they pick the others \u2014 this way, packing lunch can be something that happens with children rather than just for children.\u201d\n\nPlanetBox Rover Stainless Steel Lunch Box PlanetBox was the brand we heard about again and again, for kids of all ages. \u201cPlanetBoxes are stainless steel, so better for the environment, and they come in three sizes so you can vary based on child size, age, or appetite, and have a lot of accessories to tailor to the family needs,\u201d says childhood nutrition and feeding expert Jill Castle. Nutritionist and mom of three Lauren Antonucci likes PlanetBox\u2019s lunch boxes because they make a healthy lunch look more appealing. \u201cWhat\u2019s really good about that one, especially for the younger and middle kids, is that you can make it look really fun to eat fruits and vegetables by putting different colors of fruits and vegetables in different places,\u201d she says of the brand\u2019s boxes. \u201cAnd because all of the little compartments are small, even if you did want to put a treat, it\u2019s going to be small.\u201d And while the price may seem a little high for a lunch box, the nutritionists and parents we spoke to found that the container was versatile enough to be used over many years. Stacie Billis and Meghan Splawn, co-hosts of the family-focused food podcast \u201cDidn\u2019t I Just Feed You,\u201d are fans, and so are their kids: \u201cStacie\u2019s 9-year-old has been taking his lunch to school in their PlanetBox Rover ever since he was in kindergarten,\u201d says Splawn. She uses them with her own kids, as well. \u201cI like that it\u2019s a single molded piece, so no crevices where food can get crusty. And clearly they hold up \u2014 in all these years, we\u2019ve only had to buy new insulated sleeves,\u201d she says. $56 at Planetbox Buy\n\nBest lunch boxes and gear for preschoolers and kindergartners\n\nPlanetBox Shuttle Lunch Box For children in preschool and kindergarten, a smaller lunch box is a better bet, and according to Nicole Silber, pediatric nutritionist with FoodieKid, Planet Box\u2019s Shuttle Lunch Box is a good option because it allows kids to see all of their food choices at once, but with only two compartments (as opposed to the more typical five) and a small dipping cup, the options remain fairly simple. \u201cThis is a great way to offer variety without overwhelming\u201d says Silber. $40 at Planetbox Buy\n\nLunchBots Large Trio Stainless Steel Lunch Container Many of the parents, teachers, and nutritionists we spoke to named LunchBots as another (slightly less expensive) go-to brand for stainless-steel bento boxes for younger children. \u201cLunchBots are really great for little kids who don\u2019t need a ton of food,\u201d says Antonucci. \u201cThey\u2019re good for pre-K, kindergarten, and first grade.\u201d She suggests adding a main item, like a soup or a sandwich, and filling the smaller compartments with fruits, veggies, cheese, and a \u201csecondary treat,\u201d like cheese crackers or dessert. Dietician Robin Kaiden seconded the recommendation, noting that LunchBots \u201cfit in standard-size lunch boxes\u201d (unlike PlanetBoxes, which require the brand\u2019s own carrying cases). Food writer and founder of the Children\u2019s Food Lab Jill Santopietro also recommended LunchBots, which she says are \u201cdish-washable, nonplastic, lightweight, and easy to open.\u201d $39 at Amazon Buy $39 at Amazon Buy\n\nYumbox Original Leakproof Bento Lunch Box Container Castle nominates Yumbox\u2019s lunch containers as her favorite bento-style boxes. \u201cYumbox is leakproof, has an insertion that shows what foods go where, so there\u2019s some subtle nutrition education, and it\u2019s great for preschoolers and young elementary kids,\u201d she says. \u201cThey have so little time to eat at school and the three compartments hold just enough for my kids to get what they need to eat and actually finish it.\u201d Milana Shabekova, director of early childhood education at JCC Brooklyn in North Williamsburg, told us that these are the most popular lunch containers in her school, and that they work well both for warm foods and cold foods when insulated with an ice pack. $30 at Amazon Buy $30 at Amazon Buy\n\nEasyLunchboxes Snack Box Food Containers \u201cI like the EasyLunchboxes because they are really easy for little kids to open and close on their own, totally affordable, they are BPA-free, and they fit inside every other lunch box carrier I have purchased for my kids,\u201d says Susannah Gersten, co-owner of the Great Room, a community space for parents in Brooklyn. Castle also recommended EasyLunchboxes as a practical way for parents to pack the right amount of food for their kids \u2014 and to give kids plenty of food to choose from. \u201cCompartmentalized lunch boxes encourage variety and reasonable portions by nature of the way they are laid out,\u201d she says. \u201cI think it makes it easier for parents to pack age-appropriate amounts of food and do better with food variety.\u201d $13 at Amazon Buy $13 at Amazon Buy\n\nBayco Glass Food Storage Containers with Lids\n\nBayco Glass Food Storage Containers with Lids If you\u2019d rather pack food in individual containers, Chloe Smith, a teacher at Saint Ann\u2019s School in Brooklyn Heights and mother of a 5-year-old, says that she likes Bayco\u2019s glass containers and puts them directly into her daughter\u2019s unicorn-themed backpack. \u201cShe can open the tops of the food containers on her own, so I would definitely say they are kid-friendly,\u201d Smith says. $40 at Amazon Buy $40 at Amazon Buy\n\n\u201cThe amount of juice boxes and string-cheese wrappers we throw away over the course of the year is really astonishing,\u201d says Nora Painten, science and garden teacher at Red Hook Play Group. She\u2019s been reducing waste by packing food in reusable bags: \u201cIf my children need an extra snack, I\u2019ll use a reusable cloth Velcro bag like the ones by Lunchskins for a sliced apple,\u201d she says. \u201cI also love using Bees Knees or Etee waxed canvas for wrapping sandwiches.\u201d Painten notes that these products can be used by kids as young as 2, but can be helpful for anyone trying to cut down on their plastic use (we\u2019ve sung the praises of Bee\u2019s Wrap before, too).\n\nWildkin Kids Insulated Lunch Box And for carrying lunch gear to school, Ilona Zeltser, site director of the Windsor Terrace JCC, says that Wildkin lunch boxes are very popular among her program\u2019s younger kids. Kristin Brady also mentioned Wildkin as a favored lunch box brand at her school, too. The lunch box comes in a wide range of patterns, which would appeal to kids of all kinds. We especially like this cheery yellow one. $18 at Amazon Buy $18 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest lunch boxes and gear for elementary-school kids\n\nLunchBots Large Snack Tray Steel Lunch Container All of the items that were recommended for preschoolers and kindergartners can be used by older kids (including, as we noted earlier, our winning lunch box, the Rover). But as kids get older, the size of the lunch box will probably get larger. For instance, an elementary-school kid may want to graduate from LunchBots\u2019 three-compartment offering to their larger snack tray. \u201cMeghan\u2019s second-grader is starting to pack her lunches this year and she has been reaching for the LunchBots large Snack Tray most often,\u201d says Billis of her business partner\u2019s daughter. \u201cIt\u2019s great for kids who like variety and we like that it\u2019s dishwasher-friendly. Also, what kid won\u2019t be sold on a lunch box that\u2019s called a snack tray?!\u201d $42 at Amazon Buy $42 at Amazon Buy\n\nKlean Kanteen Double Wall Vacuum Insulated Stainless Steel Food Canister For packing a hot lunch, Antonucci, who is the mom of a third-, sixth-, and eighth-grader recommends Kleen Kanteen\u2019s containers. \u201cKleen Kanteen makes some really good-quality, throw \u2018em around the play yard \u2014 not saying they should, but they\u2019re going to \u2013 really easy to screw on and off, nothing leaks, you can put hot stuff in there, it\u2019ll stay moderately warm containers,\u201d says Antonucci. \u201cBut the biggest thing is they\u2019re sturdy, they\u2019re durable, they\u2019re not going to break, and they\u2019re really easy to close, so for those little kids, those work really well.\u201d $32 at Amazon Buy $32 at Amazon Buy\n\nTo-Go Ware Bamboo Travel Utensils \u201cWe have bamboo utensils that I\u2019ve had for years and years,\u201d says Antonucci, who cites To Go Ware as her favorite brand. \u201cIt has a fork, a knife, a spoon, and chopsticks in this cute little holder. Every once in a while the kid will lose one, but it\u2019s still so much better than all of that plastic.\u201d She packs the sustainable utensils in her kids\u2019 lunches. $12 at Amazon Buy $12 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest lunch boxes and gear for middle-school kids\n\nStasher 100% Silicone Reusable Food Bag \u201cFor older children in middle school, who find lunch boxes too \u2018childish,\u2019 I love Stasher bags as environmentally friendly alternative to sending single-use plastic,\u201d says Silber. \u201cThey\u2019re reusable, resealable, silicone-based bags that come in different sizes from smaller snack bags that would fit a sandwich.\u201d Silber notes that while these might seem a little pricey for a snack bag, Stasher bags are dishwasher-, freezer-, and oven-safe, so they can be used for cooking and storage beyond packing lunches. Antonucci seconds the silicone pouch recommendation. \u201cYou could put a banana in a silicon pouch so it doesn\u2019t leak in the backpack \u2014 the crackers can go in there, the grapes, the cheese, and they have tiny ones that you could put a smaller serving size in. I use them all the time,\u201d she says. The bags were also recommended to us when we asked sustainability experts about the best ecofriendly kitchen items. $12 at Amazon Buy $12 at Amazon Buy\n\nWaxed Canvas Lunch Bags Brown Paper Bag Styled Billis told us that for her 12-year-old son, the idea of carrying a lunch box is \u201cmortifying\u201d \u2014 \u201cso a brown bag it is,\u201d Billis says. \u201cI\u2019m hoping I can at least appeal to his ecofriendly nature so that he\u2019ll carry a reusable brown bag.\u201d She suggested this waxed canvas lunch bag, which has that classic brown-bag look without the waste. $16 at Amazon Buy $16 at Amazon Buy\n\nOXO Good Grips Leakproof On-The-Go Salad Container $16 (was $18, now 11% off) \u201cFor middle-schoolers who are willing to take a healthy salad to school, I love this Oxo salad container that has a separate dressing container to prevent soggy salads,\u201d says Silber. \u201cThe lids are easy for kids to open.\u201d She also likes the brand\u2019s \u201cOn the Go\u201d container , which \u201cfits both a sandwich and a bowl that can be filled with fruits and veggies.\u201d $16 at Amazon Buy $16 at Amazon Buy\n\nOmieBox Bento Box for Kids And for the design-minded tween, Silber recommends Omie\u2019s \u201cflexible\u201d lunch box, which can hold hot and cold foods at the same time. $40 at Amazon Buy $40 at Amazon Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
