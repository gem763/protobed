(AP) - Connecticut\u2019s hemp industry is beginning to take off.\n\nGov. Ned Lamont announced this week that the state has licensed 82 hemp growers, two processors, and 21 manufacturers under a pilot program the Democrat signed into law earlier this year.\n\nThe law allows for the cultivation, harvesting, processing, and manufacturing of hemp plants and by-products in the state. In total, there are 294 acres of land being used to grow hemp in Connecticut.\n\nUnder the law, which created a new industrial hemp research project, anyone who plans to manufacture hemp products that are consumed in any way by people - such as food products, lotions or oils - must obtain a license from the state Department of Consumer Protection.\n\nLamont said the program is creating more opportunities in the agricultural industry.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Connecticut's hemp industry is beginning to take off.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
