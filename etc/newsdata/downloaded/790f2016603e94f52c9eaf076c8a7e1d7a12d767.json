However, to date, they have suffered from a number of limitations, not least severe price volatility. Thus, [cryptocurrencies] have served as a highly speculative asset class for certain investors and those engaged in illicit activities, rather than as a means to make payments.\u201d\n\nHowever, the G7 appears to recognize that conventional finance is, in many ways, hopelessly ill-equipped to compete with digital finance, and concedes that \u201ccross-border payments remain slow, expensive and opaque, especially for retail payments such as remittances.\u201d\n\nA large number of blockchain enterprises, commercial banks and cryptocurrency businesses from around the world have already begun introducing cross-border remittance and payments solutions that outperform conventional finance in both speed and transparency.\n\nThe report continues,\n\n\u201cFinance ministries, central banks, standard-setting bodies [\u2026] and international organizations should continue their efforts to promote faster, more reliable and less costly payment systems for both domestic and cross-border purposes, using new technology where appropriate, and in a globally consistent and coordinated manner.\u201d\n\nThe authors say they want G7 nations to create \u201croad maps\u201d that focus on \u201cimproving the efficiency and lowering the cost of payments and financial services.\u201d\n\nThe \u201croad maps\u201d in question could include digital fiat plans, as well as:\n\nProviding support for initiatives that improve cross-border payments, standardization and legislative reform for \u201cemerging payment products and services\u201d and facilitating useful and responsible innovation\n\nPromoting financial inclusion by reviewing and updating calls for action and boosting support programs for less developed countries.\n\nImproving coordination between authorities, both domestically and internationally, including regulatory cooperation and harmonized standards.\n\nLearn more: Central Banks Realize They Can\u2019t Ignore Crypto, Digital Fiats Any More\n\nExperts have recently told Cryptonews.com that financial authorities\u2019 responses to crypto and blockchain developments thus far have been akin to \u201cwatching the taxi industry responding to Uber.\u201d And \"If people want to use these tokens, there is little governments can do to stop this. It would be like trying to ban the internet.\"\n\nMore fatally, it's still unclear how decentralized the improved financial system might be, which stands as one of the main selling points of true cryptocurrencies.\n\n\"Cryptoassets like Bitcoin are not about the digitalization of money,\" says Iqbal Gandham. \"The whole reason Bitcoin was created was its ability to bypass financial institutions, like banks, and issuing authorities, like governments, in a bid to create a currency that was borderless and decentralized,\" Iqbal V.
