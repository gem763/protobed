And that made them unsentimental about Amazon's decision.\n\n\"There's no need for Amazon. Go somewhere else,\" Lee said.\n\nAmazon's decision is not entirely surprising: Axios reported yesterday that the company's plans \u2014 born in a different era in which Big Tech was f\u00eated everywhere \u2014 had gone aground in a new age of popular unhappiness with the companies.\n\nOn this corner, you could feel the kind of in-your-face personality that Amazon perhaps had not anticipated \u2014 or feared. In this case, that personality was April Simpson, president of the Queensbridge Tenants Association, who until now had publicly supported the potential of new neighborhood jobs.\n\nWhen asked if she was upset, she said, \"Do you want me to beat you with this cane?\" Simpson lashed out at Amazon.\n\n\"I'm very disappointed because we were in negotiations with them. This is shameful. They should be ashamed.\"\n\n\u2014 April Simpson, president of the Queensbridge Tenants Association", "description": "Amazon's decision is not entirely surprising", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/H554Bhl-EjhOYucz3SlW38ZqjQg=/0x470:5538x3585/1920x1080/2019/02/15/1550190701151.jpg", "published_at": "2019-02-15"}
