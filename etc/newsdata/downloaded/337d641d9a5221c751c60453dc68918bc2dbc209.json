They\u2019re covered in letters, naturally, but often the millennia have not been kind and there are not just cracks and chips but entire missing pieces that may comprise many symbols.\n\nSuch gaps, or lacunae, are sometimes easy to complete: If I wrote \u201cthe sp_der caught the fl_,\u201d anyone can tell you that it\u2019s actually \u201cthe spider caught the fly.\u201d But what if it were missing many more letters, and in a dead language, to boot? Not so easy to fill in the gaps.\n\nDoing so is a science (and art) called epigraphy, and it involves both intuitive understanding of these texts and others to add context; one can make an educated guess at what was once written based on what has survived elsewhere. But it\u2019s painstaking and difficult work \u2014 which is why we give it to grad students, the poor things.\n\nComing to their rescue is a new system created by DeepMind researchers that they call Pythia, after the oracle at Delphi who translated the divine word of Apollo for the benefit of mortals.\n\nThe team first created a \u201cnontrivial\u201d pipeline to convert the world\u2019s largest digital collection of ancient Greek inscriptions into text that a machine learning system could understand. From there it was just a matter of creating an algorithm that accurately guesses sequences of letters \u2014 just like you did for the spider and the fly.\n\nPhD students and Pythia were both given ground-truth texts with artificially excised portions. The students got the text right about 57% of the time \u2014 which isn\u2019t bad, as restoration of texts is a long and iterative process. Pythia got it right\u2026 well, 30% of the time.\n\nBut! The correct answer was in its top 20 answers 73% of the time. Admittedly that might not sound so impressive, but you try it and see if you can get it in 20.\n\nThe truth is the system isn\u2019t good enough to do this work on its own, but it doesn\u2019t need to. It\u2019s based on the efforts of humans (how else could it be trained on what\u2019s in those gaps?) and it will augment them, not replace them.\n\nPythia\u2019s suggestions may not be perfectly right on the first try very often, but it could easily help someone struggling with a tricky lacuna by giving them some options to work from. Taking a bit of the cognitive load off these folks may lead to increases in speed and accuracy in taking on remaining unrestored texts.\n\nThe paper describing Pythia is available to read here, and some of the software they developed to create it is in this GitHub repository.", "description": "Machine learning and AI may be deployed on such grand tasks as finding exoplanets and creating photorealistic people, but the same techniques also have some surprising applications in academia: DeepMind has created an AI system that helps scholars understand and recreate fragmentary ancient Greek texts on broken stone tablets.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/getty-greek-tablet.jpg?w=609", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
