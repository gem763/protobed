Clear analysis. Everything you\u2019ve come to expect from the newsroom of The Post -- for your ears.\n\nA turning point in the Syrian-Kurd conflict, and U.S. policy\n\nJust over a week ago, President Trump announced the removal of troops in northern Syria. That announcement has sparked a chain of events along the Syria-Turkey border, in what appears to be the quick unraveling of longstanding U.S. policy.\n\n\n\n\n\nMissy Ryan , who covers the Pentagon and national security for The Post, says Kurds in Syria believe \u201cAmerica has abandoned them and left them to their fate against this much better-armed Turkish military.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe withdrawal of U.S. forces in northern Syria has upended long-standing U.S. policy, Ryan says. And the effect of that decision is having a rippling effect within the Trump administration and with Turkey.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Trump\u2019s 2020 campaign is creating a new political consulting class\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s lean presidential campaign \u2014 with its few political consultants and its shoestring budget \u2014 was a point of pride in 2016 for the businessman-turned-candidate, who promised to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d of longtime Washington insiders and pollsters.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the president\u2019s reelection campaign for the 2020 election looks nothing like before. Trump\u2019s campaign and supporting committees have spent nearly half a billion dollars, with a large chunk going to the new class of political consultants who rode Trump\u2019s coattails to Washington.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHe has spent more money than any of [his] predecessors had at this point in the campaign,\u201d says reporter Michelle Ye Hee Lee . \u201cAnd that\u2019s because President Trump\u2019s campaign never ended.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:\n\n\n\n\n\nPower is back on in California, but questions remain about the intentional blackout\n\nLast week, a million people were without power in Northern California. The utility company Pacific Gas and Electric shut off power to lessen the risk of wildfires amid predictions of dry, heavy winds, which can knock down power lines and spark a fire.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt felt a lot to people like it was a political act by Pacific Gas and Electric,\u201d says senior national correspondent Scott WIlson . PG&E is now in bankruptcy after being held responsible for last year\u2019s Camp fire, and the utility company is pushing for California to change the laws. \u201cIt felt a little bit like a public negotiation taking place to people who were losing business and schools that were canceled and a lot of small and large inconveniences that rippled across the region last week.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:", "description": "Missy Ryan talks about how the fight in Syria connects to U.S. diplomacy.
