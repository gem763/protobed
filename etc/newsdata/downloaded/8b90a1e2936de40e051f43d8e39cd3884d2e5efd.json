Khan Academy Founder Sal Khan\n\nKhan asserts the main difference between Chinese test scores and United States test scores is the amount of school days the students go to school.\n\n\"Summer vacation ... came out of the 19th century when a lot of kids had to work on a farm,\" Khan said. \"We\u2019re now a much more urban society where that isn\u2019t true. And there\u2019s famously the summer learning loss, where not only are kids not learning over that three months, but they\u2019re forgetting over that three months.\"\n\nGirl studying during the summertime\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmerica's international educational ranking is right in the middle, but Khan thinks there's a good explanation for that.\n\n\"There\u2019s really two sides to that [ranking,]\" Khan said. \"One is, it\u2019s not acceptable. We want our country to be at the very top. The other thing, I do make one qualifier, which is, when you look at those rankings, some of the countries are like the United States or Brazil, and some of the countries or like \u2013 they\u2019re not countries or they\u2019re city-states. It\u2019s Shanghai ... so I think, to be fair, you have to compare against large, diverse countries like the United States.\"\n\nKhan admits there are pockets of the American educational system that is working, but others that are failing the students.\n\n\"The statistic I always give is that 70 percent of American kids who have to go to community college, they have to take remedial math -- which is sixth or seventh grade math -- which shows that for large chunks of our students, especially the ones that are most marginalized, they\u2019re spending many years in the system not getting a lot out of it,\" Khan said.\n\nKhan insists students need to be allowed to work at their own pace. One way to encourage that, Khan said, is for parents to help tutor their kids during the summer break.\n\nSit down with your children. Khan Academy Founder Sal Khan\n\n\"I would say motivate them to do even 20 minutes a day,\" Khan said. \"If they were to go on the Khan Academy, once again, it\u2019s free, non-commercial. I\u2019m not selling anything. We\u2019re seeing some pretty profound efficacy gains.\"\n\nKhan thinks 20 minutes a day a few times a week will help any student, no matter their level.\n\nAnother secret that I think a lot of parents of top-performing kids do is try to learn the material for the next year before you get there. Khan Academy Founder Sal Khan\n\n\"So over the summer ... if you\u2019re kid\u2019s entering into eighth grade, go to Khan Academy and get them started on that eighth-grade material before they show up at school,\" Khan said.\n\nCLICK TO GET THE FOX BUSINESS APP\n\nKhan said the most important thing for students to try to do is to not just learn how to get the grade but to truly learn the material.", "description": "Khan asserts the main difference between Chinese test scores and United States test scores is the amount of school days the students go to school.", "authors": ["Blair Shiff"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/08/0/0/iStock-1031377826.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"}
