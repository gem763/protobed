The protests have brought together everyone and this has never happened before,\" said Sahar Younis, a 32-year-old worker with a non-governmental organisation.\n\nMusic blared in the streets as protesters chanted and waved the Lebanese flag.\n\nThousands were expected to show up to protest and calls have been mounting for members of the government to resign. The Christian Lebanese Forces party, allied with Prime Minister Saad Hariri, resigned over the weekend.\n\nHariri gave his coalition partners a 72-hour deadline on Friday to agree to reforms and suggested he might resign if the reforms are not passed.\n\nIt would be hard for the various parties in the coalition government to form a new cabinet if Hariri, a Sunni Muslim backed by the West and Sunni Gulf Arab allies, resigns, Reuters reported.\n\nThe protests were in part sparked by a proposed tax on WhatsApp calls.\n\n\"All of the leaders should be put under house arrest and be held accountable to return the money they stole from the state so Lebanon can get back on its feet,\" said Antoine Zahli, 43, a pharmacist who was among the protesters in downtown Beirut.\n\nGDP growth in Lebanon is estimated to have only grown by 0.2% in 2018, the World Bank said. The country has also been heavily impacted by the Syrian refugee crisis, taking in an estimated 1.5 million refugees, the World Bank said.\n\nThe country ranked 138th out of 180 on Transparency International's Corruption Perception Index for 2018.", "description": "Anti-government protests went on in Lebanon as the government failed to agree on economic reforms.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/24/53/40/1000x563_cmsv2_6059a650-43d2-560b-95c3-4ff4d637910d-4245340.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
