(Win McNamee/Getty Images)\n\nTwo days after President Trump unceremoniously announced on Twitter that he had dismissed his national security adviser this week, he said that John Bolton had made \u201csome very big mistakes.\u201d\n\n\u201cJohn wasn\u2019t in line with what we were doing,\u201d he said.\n\nA replacement for Bolton will be announced as soon as next week, Trump said Wednesday, adding that at least five people are interested in the job \u2014 people he described as \u201cvery highly qualified, good people I\u2019ve gotten to know over the last three years.\u201d\n\nTrump hasn\u2019t publicly named any candidates for the job. But because this is Washington, there\u2019s already plenty of speculation about who they might be. Some hypothesized that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who has managed to maintain a positive relationship with Trump, could be asked to hold both jobs at once.\n\nHere are some of the other names that have circulated as potential Bolton replacements.\n\nStephen Biegun, lead envoy on North Korea\n\n\n\nU.S. Special Representative for North Korea Stephen Biegun, left, with South Korean Unification Minister Kim Yeon Chul in Seoul on Aug. 21, 2019. (Lee Jin-man/AP)\n\nStephen Biegun was vice president of international governmental relations for Ford when Pompeo tapped him to join the State Department last August as lead envoy on North Korea.\n\nAnd he and Bolton have since held differing opinions on how to approach landmark negotiations on the peninsula. As The Washington Post reported in February, Bolton \u201cfiercely opposed\u201d Biegun\u2019s plans to use diplomatic incentives to urge North Korea to dismantle its uranium and plutonium enrichment facilities, preferring to use a maximum-pressure policy.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump said Bolton\u2019s ideas on how to handle North Korea had contributed to him losing his job.\n\nIf selected to replace Bolton, Biegun would come to the role with prior National Security Council experience. Under the George W. Bush administration, he served as the council\u2019s executive secretary and as a senior staffer to Bush\u2019s national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice. Biegun also previously served as national security adviser to former Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-Tenn.).\n\nAnd Biegun is used to bringing big foreign policy ideas to those with little experience in them. In 2008, while working on then-Sen. John McCain\u2019s (R-Ariz.) presidential campaign, he was charged with briefing vice presidential running mate Sarah Palin on foreign policy issues.\n\nBrian Hook, U.S. special representative on Iran\n\n\n\nBrian Hook, the U.S. special representative for Iran, speaks during a news conference in Kuwait City on June 22, 2019. (Yasser Al-Zayyat /AFP/Getty Images)\n\nBolton, well-known as an aggressive Iran hawk, pushed for hard-line measures and devastating sanctions against Iran. So when Trump tweeted news of Bolton\u2019s departure, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani seemed to signal that Iran saw it as a potential win.\n\n\u201cAmericans have to realize that warmongering and warmongers are not to their benefit,\u201d Rouhani said on Iranian TV. \u201cThey should not only abandon warmongering but also abandon their maximum-pressure policy.\u201d\n\nSo what would they think of Brian Hook, the Trump administration\u2019s point person on Iran, as his replacement?\n\nHook may not be quite as hawkish as Bolton, but he said last week that more sanctions against Iran are on the way and that the State Department \u201ccan\u2019t make it any more clear that we are committed to this campaign of maximum pressure.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. government has already leveled sanctions against a number of firms, individuals and shipping vessels they say are involved in an Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps network that violates U.S. sanctions by shipping Iranian oil to Syria. And the Financial Times reported that Hook personally contacted an Indian ship captain suspected of smuggling oil and offered him millions of dollars to redirect his route and hand over the ship. Four days later, Washington sanctioned the tanker.\n\nIranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif called the offer \u201coutright blackmail.\u201d\n\nThe State Department later said that it had indeed \u201cconducted extensive outreach to several ship captains,\u201d the Guardian reported.\n\nBefore taking over the Iran post, Hook served as a director of policy planning staff at the State Department. A former Bush administration official, he spent much of President Barack Obama\u2019s tenure managing a consulting firm. Hook also advised former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney on foreign policy.\n\nDouglas Macgregor, a retired Army \u00adcolonel and conservative commentator\n\nIn a 2018 episode of Fox News\u2019 \u201cTucker Carlson Tonight,\u201d one of Trump\u2019s preferred shows, retired Army Col. Douglas Macgregor said it was a good thing that \u201cPresident Trump hasn\u2019t listened very much to his advisers,\u201d crediting any progress Trump had made on recent international relations to Trump\u2019s own personal decisions.\n\n\u201cGod Bless the president,\u201d Macgregor said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t listen to these people.\u201d\n\nNow, Macgregor might be in the running to become one of them. He has written five books on military strategy and could come to the job with a more restrained U.S. policy than some of Trump\u2019s other close advisers \u2014 including Bolton.\n\nIn the same Fox News segment, Macgregor said that \u201canyone who threatens the United States with this man in the office should seek psychiatric care.\"\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re crazy, because Donald Trump means what he says,\u201d he said. \u201cHe will fight to defend the United States.\u201d\n\nAs The Post reported earlier this week, Macgregor recently spoke with Trump\u2019s acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, about a possible role in the administration.\n\nRichard Grenell, ambassador to Germany\n\n\n\nU.S. Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell in 2018. (Michael Sohn/AP)\n\nIt didn\u2019t take long after Richard Grenell landed in Berlin last year to take up his new post as U.S. ambassador for him to ruffle his host\u2019s feathers. An hour after the U.S. Embassy\u2019s official Twitter account confirmed his arrival, Grenell tweeted that \u201cGerman companies doing business in Iran should wind down operations immediately.\u201d\n\nAs @realDonaldTrump said, US sanctions will target critical sectors of Iran\u2019s economy. German companies doing business in Iran should wind down operations immediately. \u2014 Richard Grenell (@RichardGrenell) May 8, 2018\n\nIn Germany, the comments were widely perceived as an impolite order from a visiting diplomat. He has continued to irk politicians there, with Wolfgang Kubicki, a top opposition lawmaker, saying in March that he was behaving like \u201ca high commissioner of an occupying power.\"\n\nIn a meeting with Vice President Pence earlier this year, German Chancellor Angela Merkel told him that Grenell\u2019s style \u201ctook getting used to,\u201d the Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nGrenell, a close ally of Bolton\u2019s who has clashed with Pompeo, also very briefly served as a spokesman for Romney\u2019s 2012 presidential run. Grenell made regular appearances on Fox News and served as a spokesman for the U.S. mission to the United Nations during the George W. Bush administration.\n\nHe has also been a regular customer of Trump\u2019s businesses, according to internal documents from Trump\u2019s D.C. hotel that were obtained by The Washington Post. They showed that Grenell was listed among the \u201cVIP Arrivals\u201d for June 22, 2018 \u2014 and indicated that he was a repeat customer whose past stays had earned him a \u201cgold\u201d status on the company\u2019s Trump Card loyalty program. That status appears relatively rare: The Post reviewed VIP Arrivals logs showing more than 1,100 reservations at the Trump hotel in 2018, and only 10 of the guests were listed as having gold status. Another one of the gold-level members \u2014 Kelly Craft, a GOP fundraiser whose family is heavily invested in the coal business \u2014 was recently named by Trump as his ambassador to the United Nations.\n\nRobert C. O\u2019Brien, special presidential envoy for hostage affairs\n\nEarlier this year, Trump tweeted a quote calling himself the \u201cgreatest hostage negotiator that I know of in the history of the United States.\u201d He didn\u2019t say who called him that, but then-White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said it could be attributed to Robert C. O\u2019Brien, Trump\u2019s hostage envoy. O\u2019Brien had previously said Trump had \u201cunparalleled success\u201d in bringing home hostages.\n\nBefore serving as a hostage specialist for Trump, O\u2019Brien, the founding partner of a Los Angeles law firm, helped run the State Department\u2019s justice reform initiative in Afghanistan, training Afghan lawyers and judges.\n\nIn Europe, O\u2019Brien is best known for his recent visit to Stockholm to monitor the trial of U.S. rapper A$AP Rocky and two of his associates. Trump\u2019s decision to deploy his hostage affairs envoy to a trial held in an allied nation sparked ridicule and anger in Sweden, where the sight of O\u2019Brien on the calm streets of inner-city Stockholm appeared bizarre to some and offensive to others.\n\nWhen a Swedish court released all three defendants \u2014 before finding all of them guilty \u2014 O\u2019Brien framed the decision as a \u201cvery good night for the United States of America and for the Kingdom of Sweden.\u201d\n\nSwedish observers vehemently disagreed with that assessment, arguing that Trump\u2019s attempts to interfere with the independence of Sweden\u2019s judiciary reflected the president\u2019s disregard for rules and his ignorance in regard to foreign allies. Trump, said O\u2019Brien after Rocky\u2019s release, was \u201cquite pleased with that result.\u201d\n\nDavid Fahrenthold contributed to this report from Washington, Rick Noack from Berlin.\n\nRead more:\n\nA nonprofit paid to rent Trump\u2019s D.C. hotel ballrooms.
