However, there's a slight hiccup for Brits, as the spacious Barsala penthouse is located in Los Angeles.\n\n(Image: Hotels.com)\n\nNot exactly ideal for a short trip.\n\nOf course if you have a holiday booked or were thinking of a trip anyway, it's worth leaving space on the itinerary.\n\nOh, and there are return flights to LA from \u00a3321pp on Skyscanner if you really are dedicated to a trip down memory lane.\n\n(Image: Hotels.com)\n\nThe Lisa Frank Flat will be open for bookings from Friday 11th October on the Hotels.com listing here until Sunday 27th October. Stays will be on offer for the same window of dates.\n\nPrices start from $199 a night (approx \u00a3163) and the flat can be booked for multiple nights.\n\n(Image: Hotels.com)\n\nAdam Jay, President of Hotels.com, said: \"We wanted to design a room that celebrates all things \u201890s, and nothing screams childhood nostalgia more these iconic designs.\n\n\"Hotels.com is thrilled to bring this dream room to life and reward travelers with a blast from their past.\"", "description": "Get ready for a trip down memory lane in this bright and colourful flat that's a glorious tribute to all things 90s", "authors": ["Julie Delahaye", "Image", "Hotels.Com"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20538478.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Hotel.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
