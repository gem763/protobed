There\u2019s the Ken Loach approach, worthy and moving but, in this overcrowded landscape, arguably not fashioned to persuade (or even attract) those viewers not already on-side, and there\u2019s the fast-paced Armando Iannucci satire, in which hypocrisies are gleefully punctured and the accepted political culture is stretched toward its Swiftian logical conclusions. The latter is often more fun to watch, but of course that\u2019s partly because it tends to flatter its audience as it goes along, which has an obvious downside. It\u2019s also a method that depends on the anxious, image-conscious bad faith of its real-life targets. What to do, though, when the target\u2014too busy openly reveling in his own corruption to indulge in much old-school hypocrisy\u2014is beyond, or immune to, satire?\n\nBurlesque seems the only way to tackle billionaire Silvio Berlusconi, Italy\u2019s longest-serving postwar prime minister, whose various convictions for fraud and bribery\u2014and even an ongoing trial for a cover-up related to his allegedly paying an underage girl for sex\u2014haven\u2019t prevented his making yet another comeback this year, if only as a member of the European Parliament. And it happens that burlesque is something of a specialism for Paolo Sorrentino, probably the best known and internationally most praised contemporary Italian director. In his new film, Loro (Them), you could say that his style\u2014a frenetic expressionism of swooping camera angles and carnivalesque set pieces\u2014has finally met its ideal match. If the film threatens to leave many audience members queasy, exhausted, distended in the manner of a force-fed goose ready for its fate, that might just be the body\u2019s response to a place where twenty-first\u2013century aesthetics and politics meet.\n\nThough it\u2019s especially alarming to watch at this current moment, Loro is a period piece, a mostly imagined look behind the scenes at Berlusconi\u2019s milieu during the mid-aughts, after one of his falls from power, as he plotted and bribed his way to the next rise. Its title describes him and the gang of enablers, cronies, and hangers-on who were looting Italy around that time. The film\u2019s first hour or so follows a hungry, younger man, Sergio Morra (Riccardo Scamarcio), who is desperate to catch the eye of the great showman: An early scene finds him, the picture of postmodern ambition and focus, fucking and snorting coke off a young woman with a Berlusconi tattoo on her lower back. (Sadly, though there are a few spirited performances, this is close enough to an encapsulation of the function served by women in the film. Their schemes and protests notwithstanding, they exist mostly as bait, trophies, transactional objects rather than full moral actors, and aren\u2019t paid the compliment of curiosity that the principal men, however crude their motives, receive.)\n\nWe then follow Morra\u2019s entrepreneurial efforts to gather a large stable of similarly endowed beauties in hopes of attracting attention with a drug-fueled party at the mansion next to Berlusconi\u2019s summer place. Time slows and stretches around the complex machinations of the wannabe acolytes and around the long, loud shots of bodies undulating in rooms and by pools, so that, although the camera leaps and lingers on his lavish estate, we don\u2019t get to Berlusconi himself until nearly halfway through the film. (In Italy, Loro was released in two parts.) That\u2019s an intriguing move, creating a certain suspense and mystery around someone whose fondness for smoke and mirrors and tits all over has always seemed notably designed to impress and overwhelm, rather than to hide anything. Shamelessness is, after all, the brand.", "description": "The problem with enjoying a seductive drama about Silvio Berlusconi.", "authors": ["Lidija Haas"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/d5b963e3354b9afebefa05aea9d312b67a7cca6e.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
