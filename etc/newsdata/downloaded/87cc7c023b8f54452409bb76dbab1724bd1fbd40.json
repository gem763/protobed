Notably, the motion to dismiss specifically claims that the plaintiff, Bradley Sostack, does not have standing to file a complaint, rather than address claims that XRP is a security.\n\nIn the motion to dismiss, Ripple states that the plaintiff failed to bring a case within three years of the initial offering (which would have been 2013), meaning the statute of repose expired; that the plaintiff did not \u201cplausibly allege\u201d that he purchased XRP during the initial offering; and that the plaintiff did not \u201cplausibly allege\u201d that any of the defendants actually sold the XRP that he bought.\n\nNotably absent from the motion to dismiss is a full-fledged argument over why XRP is not a security. Indeed, the filing only addresses the question in a footnote (footnote 19), which states that XRP is not a security \u201cbecause it is not an \u2018investment contract.'\u201d\n\nThe filing goes on to say:\n\n\u201cPurchasing XRP is not an \u2018investment\u2019 in Ripple; there is no common enterprise between Ripple and XRP purchasers; there was no promise that Ripple would help generate profits for XRP holders; and the XRP Ledger is decentralized.\u201d\n\nThe footnote also adds that \u201cbecause XRP is a currency,\u201d it cannot also be a security under law. The filing states that the court itself does not need to determine \u201cwhether XRP is a security or currency for purposes of this motion, which assumes Plaintiff\u2019s allegation that XRP is a security.\u201d\n\nThe filing also states that \u201cthe federal Departments of Treasury and Justice publicly concluded that XRP is a \u2018convertible virtual currency,'\u201d in its \u201cfactual background\u201d section.\n\n\u201cThis is consistent with the CFTC\u2019s position that virtual currency is a commodity,\u201d the filing states. \u201cNonetheless, Plaintiff alleges that XRP is a \u2018security\u2019 under federal and state law, \u2026 and that Defendants have offered and sold XRP despite its non-registration with securities authorities.\u201d\n\nMoving to dismiss\n\nRipple\u2019s actual arguments focus on when the most recent case has been filed, with the first hinging around the fact that XRP entered the market in 2013. The filing states:\n\n\u201c\u2026 under Plaintiff\u2019s own allegations, Defendants offered XRP to the public throughout 2013 through 2015. Accordingly, the three-year statute of repose expired as of 2016 (three years after the sales cited in the May 2015 settlement) and in no case later than May 2018 (three years after the May 2015 settlement agreement in which \u2018Defendants acknowledged that they had sold XRP to the general public,\u2019 Complaint \u00b6 25). The Securities Act claims in the Complaint, filed August 5, 2019, are therefore untimely and barred by the statute of repose.\u201d\n\nThe filing adds that the plaintiff does not claim he bought XRP directly from Ripple or another defendant, but rather, \u201che was part of the \u2018general public\u2019 who purchased XRP through transactions in a two-week period in January 2018.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe necessary inference is that he bought and sold XRP through a secondary trading exchange,\u201d the filing says.\n\nThe response also states that plaintiff\u2019s consumer protection claims under California state law (rather than federal securities law) should be dismissed because the statutes require a securities claim.\n\nAs a result, the response says, the complaint should be dismissed with prejudice (meaning plaintiffs would not be able to re-file the suit).\n\n\u201cLeave to amend should be denied because amendment would be futile.\u201d\n\nYear-long case\n\nRipple\u2019s filing comes a month and a half after the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, alleging the company, affiliated entities and individuals violated both state and federal securities laws.\n\nThe new complaint, filed by law firms Susman Godfrey and Tayler-Copeland Law, alleges that Ripple, its subsidiary XRP II, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and others violated securities law by selling XRP. In a first, the complaint borrowed from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s digital assets framework, drawing parallels between the SEC\u2019s analysis for what constitutes a security and Ripple\u2019s alleged actions.\n\nThe case itself stretches back to early 2018, when XRP purchasers first began filing lawsuits against Ripple. The complaints alleged that Ripple sold XRP, using the proceeds to fund its operations. The cases were consolidated into the current form.\n\nWhile the class has not been certified yet, Thursday\u2019s filing is still the first time Ripple has had to respond to the substance of the complaints against it.\n\nAt the heart of the matter is the question of whether XRP is a security. Some of Ripple\u2019s detractors claim it is, one that is issued and managed by Ripple. The startup disagrees, saying XRP is a token created by Jed McCaleb (now at Interstellar), Arthur Britto and David Schwartz.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the case proceeds to a jury trial, or if settlement talks occur first. However, the filing notes that there is a hearing scheduled for early next year, and the attorneys say they are willing to argue the motion then.\n\nLegal team shake up\n\nFriday\u2019s filing comes just days after Ripple brought Damien Marshall and Kathleen Hartnett, two lawyers with Boies Schiller Flexner LLP, on board to work on the case (a judge approved their appearance for the case on Sept. 17).\n\nThey join Skadden Arps attorneys Peter Morrison, John Neukom and Virgina Milstead, who have been listed on the docket but whose names did not appear on the filing Friday morning.\n\nOn Thursday night, former SEC Division of Enforcement director Andrew Ceresney also applied to join the case as a lawyer for Ripple. Ceresney is currently an attorney with Debevoise & Plimpton, an international law firm based in New York, and his name appeared on Friday\u2019s filing.\n\nHe previously represented Ripple against one of the previous class action lawsuits, filed by plaintiff Ryan Coffey, alongside former SEC Chair Mary Jo White.\n\nThat case was voluntarily dismissed, and White\u2019s work for Ripple appears to have ended around that time.\n\nBrad Garlinghouse image via CBInsights", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.coindesk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/brad1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
