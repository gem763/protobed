It was exactly the kind of clumsy, self-absorbed move that, despite Clinton\u2019s lifetime in the public eye, revealed a total misunderstanding of how politics work. Far from exposing or thwarting Gabbard, as Clinton loyalists want to believe, the former secretary of state overshot the mark by making an accusation without proof. Gabbard will now dismiss real concerns about her as just so much conspiracy theorizing.\n\nClinton is right that there is plenty to worry about with Gabbard. Indeed, debate moderators and other Democratic candidates should have never let her escape the first debates without direct questions about her unnatural fluency with both Syrian and Russian talking points. Gabbard even emulates the stiff, unnatural cadences of Russian rhetoric, as when she referred to Clinton on Twitter as \u201cqueen of the warmongers\u201d\u2014the Russians used to refer to close Clinton ally Madeleine Albright as \u201cMadam War.\u201d She repeatedly echoes pro-Assad propaganda in using the phrase \u201cregime-change war\u201d to describe the U.S. presence in Syria.\n\nMoreover, Clinton is also right that both Stein and Gabbard are favorites of the Russian government, which has rushed social media bots and state-controlled media to their defense at various times. Stein even got a seat at dinner with Vladimir Putin, an honor one might think is a bit out of the weight class of a super-minor American candidate. The fact that Stein was sitting at the same table as Putin, along with the retired general, future Trump appointee, and current felon Michael Flynn should have raised alarm bells, because Putin never wastes a minute of his day on people who cannot be of use to him. But once Trump was in the race, Russia focused its efforts on getting him elected, and Stein was left to do what damage she could as a third-party spoiler.\n\nAt this point, three years after the 2016 election, dwelling on Stein\u2019s relationship with Russia is just crying over spilled vodka. Clinton\u2019s mistake was to raise Gabbard\u2019s profile, and then to throw around the term Russian asset.\n\nTo call someone a Russian asset implies willful coordination and awareness. It is not the same thing as being friendly to the Russian point of view. Nor is it akin to being compromised by knowing the Russians have damaging material\u2014as so many have speculated is the case with President Donald Trump. Think of being a Russian asset as something in between cluelessness and conspiracy. But without further evidence, all Clinton managed to do was to prepare the ground for Gabbard to dismiss all future accusations or revelations as just more grandstanding from a defeated and bitter 2016 nominee.", "description": "The 2016 Democratic nominee is right to worry about the congresswoman from Hawaii\u2014but overshot the mark by calling her a Russian asset while offering no proof.", "authors": ["Tom Nichols", "Author Of"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/AP_19173701453548/facebook.jpg?1571517534", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
