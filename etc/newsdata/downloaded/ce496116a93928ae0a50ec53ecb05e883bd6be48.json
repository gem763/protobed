The Justice Department said there was no admission of liability.\n\nThe company ceased operations in 2017 because of whistleblower allegations and an ensuing probe, a spokeswoman for the UTC principals said.\n\n\u201cAfter five years of legal defense, the principals ultimately agreed to a settlement, having simply run out of energy to continue prolonged legal proceedings,\u201d the spokeswoman said in a statement.\n\nThe Justice Department accused the defendants of having paid physicians from 2013 to 2017 to induce them to order genetic tests, purportedly in return for involvement in a clinical trial to create a registry of people who underwent genetic testing.\n\nIt also said the defendants offered kickbacks to other entities and individuals, and billed Medicare for unnecessary genetic tests.\n\nAccording to whistleblowers\u2019 complaints, the \u201cDiagnosing Adverse Drug Reactions Registry,\u201d or DART trial, was intended to catalog the effects of genetic testing on the drug regimens and clinical outcomes for 250,000 patients.\n\nThe defendants were accused of having falsely represented that Medicare would cover testing that was a prerequisite for enrollment in the registry.\n\n\u201cHealthcare fraud, in any incarnation, hurts patients, honest medical practitioners, and all of the nation\u2019s taxpayers,\u201d U.S. Attorney Peter Strasser in New Orleans said in a statement.\n\nThe False Claims Act lets whistleblowers sue on behalf of the government, and share in recoveries.\n\nOn Sept. 27, federal agents raided a series of genetic testing laboratories and criminally charged 35 people over an alleged fraud that caused $2.1 billion of losses to federal healthcare insurance programs.\n\nThe government has also issued a consumer alert concerning genetic testing fraud.", "description": "A New Orleans-based genetics testing company and its three principals will pay $42.6 million to resolve charges they defrauded the federal government by paying kickbacks for referrals and billing for medically unnecessary tests, the U.S. Department of Justice said on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Jonathan Stempel", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
