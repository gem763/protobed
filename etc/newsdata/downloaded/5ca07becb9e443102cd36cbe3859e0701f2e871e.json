In 2012, the US Treasury added his name and that of his older sibling, Ivan, to its list of drug kingpins.\n\nOvidio Guzman Lopez was briefly detained by Mexican officers resulting in a gun fight. In a chilling demonstration of the Sinaloa cartel's destructive power, he was handed back following a ferocious battle in which the authorities were hopelessly outgunned by the gang\n\nVideo footage from Thursday's battle showed civilians, including women and children, fleeing in terror as gunmen stalked the streets on foot and in trucks with heavy machine guns mounted on the back. Motorists drove in reverse, desperately trying to get away. Some footage showed bodies lying on the ground and officials said at least eight people \u2013 including five gunmen, a policeman, a civilian and the inmate of a local prison \u2013 had been killed.\n\nCartel fighters, some in black ski masks and matching combat gear, blocked streets with burning buses and barricades. Many were armed with assault rifles and some even had high-calibre Barrett guns, immensely powerful sniper rifles.\n\nMothers clutched their children to them as they hid under cars to avoid being hit in the street battles around them.\n\nIn one video, a girl could be heard asking her father: 'Why are they shooting bullets?' In a severe embarrassment for the government, which has vowed to defeat the drug lords, forces then released Guzman as areas of the city were effectively turned into warzones.\n\nCompounding the chaos, 27 prisoners took advantage of the panic to escape from the local prison. Under El Chapo \u2013 who used a network of tunnels to smuggle drugs, and escape from his homes and even jails \u2013 the Sinaloa cartel allegedly exported vast amounts of cocaine into the US.\n\nThe US Treasury considered him the 'most powerful drug trafficker in the world', running a criminal enterprise that spanned continents and was responsible for huge bloodshed in Mexico. Critics had said the Mexican government's pledge to defeat the drug cartels was empty even before the Culiacan humiliation.\n\nJoaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman, 62, (pictured) was convicted in New York in February on murder, drug and money laundering charges and was sentenced to life in prison in the US\n\nYesterday, the streets of the city \u2013 which has a population of 750,000 \u2013 were deserted with army helicopters hovering overhead after officials warned people to stay at home. Mexican president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador insisted it had been the 'right decision' to give up Guzman to avoid loss of life.\n\nHe said: 'The situation turned very difficult and many citizens' lives were at risk, many human beings. Catching a criminal can't be worth more than people's lives... You can't fight fire with fire.' As analysts warned that Mexicans will see the debacle as the government surrendering to organised crime, Mr Lopez Obrador insisted his security strategy hadn't failed.\n\nHe set up the National Guard \u2013 the militarised police force that handed back Guzman \u2013 specifically to take on the cartels in a country where many police are working for the drug lords. Defence minister Luis Sandoval contradicted his leader on the scale of the humiliation, however. He admitted the plan to arrest Guzman was 'badly planned'. He said: 'The task force acted too hastily. [The operation] wasn't improvised... it takes time to obtain an arrest warrant.'", "description": "The Mexican city of Culiacan turned into a warzone as Mexican police arrested El Chapo's son, only to have to hand him back after a bloody clash with gang members on Thursday.", "authors": ["Tom Leonard For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/21/19901244-0-image-a-6_1571428801719.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
