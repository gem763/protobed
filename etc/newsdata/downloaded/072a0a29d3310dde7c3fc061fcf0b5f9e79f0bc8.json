The United States could challenge the amount of retaliatory sanctions sought, which could send the long-running dispute to arbitration.\n\nThe office of U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Robert Lighthizer has said the WTO ruling recognised that the United States had proved that China used state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to subsidise and distort its economy.\n\nBut the ruling also said the United States must accept Chinese prices to measure subsidies, even though USTR viewed those prices as \"distorted\".\n\nChina and the Trump administration are locked in a tit-for-tat trade war. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said on Thursday that China's \"serious commitment\" to buy up to $50 billion worth of U.S. agricultural goods as part of a phase 1 trade deal would depend in part on private companies and market conditions.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday he thinks a trade deal between the world's two largest economies will be signed by the time the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meetings take place in Chile on Nov. 16 and 17.
