But when Ninis Rosqvist and her team took this year\u2019s measurements, at the end of the summer melt on 3 September, the northern peak was 1.2 metres higher at 2,096.8 metres.\n\n\u201cWe suspected this was probably the case last year,\u201d Ninis Rosqvist told the Guardian from the Tarfala research station at the foot of the massif. \u201cBut unfortunately our measurements were not precise enough. Now we can say with certainty: we are accurate to within a couple of centimetres.\u201d\n\nThe scientist said the height of Kebnekaise\u2019s southern peak was the lowest on record: 24 metres less than in the 1960s. \u201cAlmost all the shrinkage has been in past two decades, when the glacier has lost an average of one metre a year,\u201d she said.\n\nSince the glacier was likely to expand again with winter snow and ice, the southern peak could briefly recover its ranking, Ninis Rosqvist said. \u201cIt will keep changing for a while,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the trend is now firmly established, and very clear.\u201d\n\nSweden recorded its hottest ever months of May and July in 2018, with temperatures soaring to more than 10C above normal. With wildfires burning across the Arctic, the Kebnekaise glacier shrank by almost four metres.\n\nAlthough this July was not as hot after an unusually cool start to the month, the village of Markusvinsa in the far north of the country recorded 34.8C on 26 July \u2013 the highest temperature ever recorded north of the Arctic circle in Sweden.\n\nNinis Rosqvist said small glaciers such as that on Kebnekaise\u2019s southern peak were particularly badly affected by warm summers. It was mainly cool summers that allowed glaciers to grow, rather than particularly harsh winters, she said. But the past two Scandinavian summers had caused the snow and ice to melt away very fast. \u201cYou can see it at the top, where it\u2019s most exposed to the sun. It really looks different. It gets slippery up there; you can see the meltwater running off.\u201d\n\nThe news may have been expected, but the official downgrading of the southern peak was still \u201cemotionally quite something\u201d, Ninis Rosqvist said. \u201cThe mountains are changing so fast \u2013 higher temperatures, less snow, winter rain.\u201d\n\nThe glacier on Kebnekaise\u2019s southern peak was \u201ciconic \u2013 a symbol for all the glaciers in Sweden\u201d, she said, adding: \u201cBut you know, we don\u2019t need any more symbols. We don\u2019t need to pile up more evidence. We can see the climate changing before our eyes up here, and we need to do something about it.\u201d", "description": "Glacier at Kebnekaise\u2019s summit has shrunk amid soaring Arctic temperatures, say scientists", "authors": ["Jon Henley"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18130088e2b5fc3dfd99048700b8a276d56510fa/0_380_5700_3420/master/5700.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8194f42f2783ea5d330bd28d9389c82d", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
