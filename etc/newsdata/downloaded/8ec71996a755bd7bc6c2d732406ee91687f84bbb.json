Analysts led by Paul Choi slashed their stock price target to $16 from $54. the stock has underperformed for the last 18 months, as execution missteps outweighed announcements of mostly positive clinical developments, said the analysts. \"When we initiated coverage of NKTR on Dec. 13, 2018, we expected additional data from the PIVOT-02 study of NKTR's bempegaldesleukin + BMY's Opdivo (potential treatment for a variety of advanced solid tumors) to help rebuild the investment case after investors grew bearish on the stock in the wake of deteriorating efficacy data presented at ASCO 2018 and a decreasing likelihood of industry M&A,\" the analysts wrote. \"While the reported data since then has been somewhat encouraging, NKTR disclosed manufacturing discrepancies which resulted in suboptimal batches of bempeg being used in the PIVOT-02 and PROPEL clinical trials.\" The resulting investor uncertainty has pulled the stock down 60% from its Jan. 19 high and will likely remain an overhang, they wrote.
