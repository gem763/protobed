Jurors in St Louis county court also heard that a police captain had called Wildhaber \u201cfruity\u201d.\n\n\u201cI was sickened by it,\u201d Wildhaber told the court last week, according to the St Louis Post-Dispatch.\n\n\u201cI think I said: \u2018I can\u2019t believe we are having this conversation in 2014.\u2019 It was devastating to hear.\u201d\n\nWildhaber said he was told to \u201ctone down the gayness\u201d by John Saracino, a former St Louis county police board of commissioners member. Saracino has denied it.\n\nDonna Woodland, a witness in the trial, supported Wildhaber\u2019s complaint, the Post-Dispatch reported. Woodland testified that she had heard the St Louis county police captain Guy Means say Wildhaber was \u201cway too out there with his gayness and he needed to tone it down if he wanted a white shirt [be promoted]\u201d.\n\nShe also recalled Means saying: \u201cYou know about him, right? He\u2019s fruity.\u201d\n\nThe jury awarded Wildhaber $1.9m in actual damages and $10m in punitive damages on the discrimination allegation, according to the Post-Dispatch. It also found Wildhaber had been the victim of retaliation after filing his lawsuit, adding $999,000 in actual damages and $7m in punitive damages for that charge.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to send a message,\u201d the jury foreman, who was not named, told reporters. \u201cIf you discriminate you are going to pay a big price \u2026 You can\u2019t defend the indefensible.\u201d\n\nThe St Louis county executive, Sam Page, said in a statement he would appoint new members to the police board.\n\n\u201cOur police department must be a place where every community member and every officer is respected and treated with dignity. Employment decisions in the department must be made on merit and who is best for the job,\u201d Page said.\n\n\u201cThe time for leadership changes has come and change must start at the top.\u201d", "description": "Keith Wildhaber, who was allegedly passed over for promotion 23 times, wins discrimination lawsuit against St Louis county policeSergeant Keith Wildhaber.
