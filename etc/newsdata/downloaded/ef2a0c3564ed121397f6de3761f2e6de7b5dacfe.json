(AP) - The U.S. Forest Service is asking a federal judge to reconsider an earlier order that banned tree-cutting across thousands of square miles of Southwest forest.\n\nThe ruling stemmed from a 2013 case that alleged the agency failed to consider the effects of thinning and logging on the threatened Mexican spotted owl and its habitat.\n\nThe Forest Service says without clarification, efforts to mitigate wildfire threats will be compromised until at least 2023 when data on the owl population is expected.\n\nEnvironmentalists say the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Forest Service have failed to track the bird\u2019s numbers.\n\nThe ban excludes personal firewood cutting permits that rural residents rely on, but it does prohibit thinning projects, prescribed burns and commercial wood cutting across all five national forests in New Mexico and the Tonto National Forest outside Phoenix.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The U.S. Forest Service is asking a federal judge to reconsider an earlier order that banned tree-cutting across thousands of square miles of Southwest forest.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Susan Montoya Bryan"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
