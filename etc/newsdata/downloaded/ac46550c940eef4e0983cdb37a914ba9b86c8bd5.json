They can start it but I don\u2019t think it will go anywhere.\u201d\n\nSiems will cast the first presidential vote of her life next year. She was among supporters gathered at the centre of a basketball arena in Minneapolis on Thursday night for a close-up look at the president. Thousands more sat in the stands wearing \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d caps as well as sweaters and T-shirts with slogans such as \u201cCops for Trump\u201d, \u201cFake News\u201d, \u201cSocialism Sucks\u201d, \u201cSpace Force\u201d and \u201cThe Trump Strikes Back\u201d.\n\n'Everything is in flux': will crucial swing voters give Trump another Iowa win in 2020?

In fact, a man who built his political career on the formula that what does not kill him makes him stronger aims to do it again with the impeachment inquiry. In a blistering and blustering 102-minute speech, he made clear he intends to wield impeachment as a cudgel in next year\u2019s presidential election.\n\nThe formula only works because of his fiercely partisan support base, which has proved willing to swallow his faults because he shares their animus towards the same foes. Robert Leonard, a radio news director in Iowa, told CNN many conservatives are \u201cstanding strong behind President Trump because he is a kind of a golden hammer\u201d that they believe is \u201cneeded to break what they see as the liberal stranglehold on America\u201d.\n\nWe think the United States is under attack by the liberals and it\u2019s \u2026 pushing us towards socialism Doug Peltier, 69\n\nThis sentiment was echoed by a dozen Trump supporters interviewed by the Guardian. All but two dismissed the impeachment inquiry, triggered by Trump pressuring the leader of Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden, one of his leading rivals, as mere political theatre. Few were troubled by the president\u2019s abrupt decision to withdraw US troops from northern Syria. Most predicted a landslide win next year.\n\nSome Trump fans gathered at the Loon Cafe in downtown Minneapolis for a drink or lunch before the rally got going. On the street outside, a man wearing an Uncle Sam costume held a placard that said \u201cMN v Trump!\u201d \u2013 reflecting how the city is a liberal stronghold and the state narrowly voted in favour of Hillary Clinton in 2016.\n\nBut sitting at a table in a \u201cUSA\u201d cap and \u201cUSA\u201d sweater beside his wife, Carol, who sported a \u201cTrump\u201d cap, Doug Peltier, 69, was having none of it.\n\n\u201cWe think the United States is under attack by the liberals and it\u2019s really changing our culture, pushing us towards socialism,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are so grateful for a president like him putting the American people first. Yes, he has faults, but don\u2019t we all?\u201d\n\nThe retired educational administrator dismissed the fast-moving impeachment inquiry launched by Democrats in the House of Representatives, led by Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been trying to impeach him from before he became president,\u201d he said. \u201cIf this blows up in their face, which it will, they\u2019ll try something else. They know they can\u2019t win an election.\u201d\n\nHe also defended Trump\u2019s decision to pull troops out of Syria, despite even his Republican allies condemning the abandonment of the Kurds.\n\n\u201cAgain he\u2019s kept his promise to get us out. Why have been there so long? The United States has spent enough blood and treasure in foreign countries. It\u2019s time for other people to step up.\u201d\n\nTrump supporters often combine a romanticised sense of destiny with a ruthlessly pragmatic focus on results. Peltier said: \u201cI don\u2019t agree with everything Trump does but I\u2019m concerned with the end product and the end product is better than anything we\u2019ve had since Ronald Reagan. There\u2019s no doubt in my mind that Trump, despite all his shortcomings, was the right person at the right time ordained by God. I truly believe that.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not a fan of him as a person \u2013 he\u2019s a pig \u2013 but he \u2026 says what he thinks and that\u2019s what I like Casey Crawford, 40\n\nNearby, Casey Crawford, 40, was plying her trade selling pro-Trump merchandise \u2013 a cottage industry that has grown up around his political career and rallies. Her red cap said \u201cMake Ocasio-Cortez bar tend again\u201d \u2013 an attack on the Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a former bartender from New York who is now the youngest congresswoman in US history and a target of Trump\u2019s anti-socialism rhetoric.\n\nCrawford, a former food and drinks director at a hotel, did not vote in 2016 but will vote for Trump in 2020.\n\n\u201cIn the beginning I was not a Trump supporter, but as I\u2019ve come to the rallies and learned more and seen more with my own eyes, I\u2019ve become one,\u201d she said. \u201cThis country is full of Trump supporters. I\u2019m not a fan of him as a person \u2013 he\u2019s a pig \u2013 but he doesn\u2019t sugar-coat anything. He says what he thinks and that\u2019s what I like.\u201d\n\nCrawford said the steel industry had been revived in her home, Granite City, Illinois, since Trump became president. But she allowed that the impeachment inquiry might have solid grounds.\n\n\u201cI hate to be the person who says I don\u2019t know what to believe, but I really don\u2019t,\u201d she admitted. \u201cIf he\u2019s impeached and that\u2019s the way it\u2019s going to go, that\u2019s what the country is founded on.\u201d\n\nStanding at the bar, Deena Eriksson, an estate agent, agreed: \u201cIf he did something wrong, he should be impeached. He should have handlers dealing with his tweeting and his bull-in-a-china-shop behaviour.\u201d\n\nTrump used his rally to hurl coarse insults at Biden (\u201cHe was only a good vice-president because he understood how to kiss Barack Obama\u2019s ass\u201d) and fling allegations about Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, enriching himself in Ukraine. The claims of wrongdoing have no factual basis but echo in conservative media and appear to be penetrating, at least on Planet Trump.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Trump supporters on stage at the rally in Minneapolis.

If someone has been eating cookies and there\u2019s chocolate around my mouth, it\u2019s probably me. If there\u2019s chocolate around someone\u2019s mouth here, it\u2019s probablyJoe Biden.\u201d\n\n\u2018It\u2019s all political games\u2019\n\nSome loyalists are in denial about the content of Trump\u2019s July call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, despite the White House having released a rough transcript that shows the US president brought up Biden. Democrats have suggested it is a more clear-cut case than the special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report on Russian election interference, which found 10 potential instances of Trump seeking to obstruct justice.\n\nBut Mark Mitchell, 58, argued that Trump did not intend to single out Biden and was rather concerned more generally about corruption involving Democrats, including during the 2016 election. \u201cI\u2019m lawyer and it\u2019s all jazzed up,\u201d he insisted. \u201cTrump may be a really bad bike ride but he doesn\u2019t have a mean streak. If he did, he wouldn\u2019t have put out the transcript.\n\n\u201cThe Democrats are playing political games. They\u2019re trying to focus on the distillation of the call to make it seem he has a hardened heart but I don\u2019t think he has that sophistication. He was asking if there\u2019s corruption there and saying we need to root it out. There\u2019s nothing there.\u201d\n\nCloser to the 20,000-seat arena, Ben Kangar, a Liberian American and one of the few people of colour at the rally, expressed a similar sentiment.\n\nThe president hasn\u2019t done anything I would say is liable to impeachment. It\u2019s all political games Ben Kangar, 56\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he was wrong,\u201d the 56-year-old said. \u201cHe has the right as the president ask if anyone from his country is doing something wrong. It is a matter of integrity. The things were done before Biden got in the race. Biden did what the president is accused of.\u201d\n\nKangar, a leadership trainer, added: \u201cThe president hasn\u2019t done anything I would say is liable to impeachment. It\u2019s all political games.\u201d\n\nRolf Lalone, 60, a nuclear plant engineer, dismissed impeachment as \u201ca political show\u201d and backed Trump\u2019s judgment on Syria.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m always one to say we need to pull back,\u201d he said. \u201cIf there are humanitarian issues, it needs to be the world coming together. Obama said lead from behind. I like that.\u201d\n\nSuch responses suggest that while Trump\u2019s move in Syria provoked a rare rebellion from Republicans in Congress, his instincts may still be closely aligned with those of his supporters. After he told a rambling but emotive story about receiving the coffins of America\u2019s war dead, the rally erupted in chants of \u201cBring them home!\u201d\n\nMarie Yovanovitch's testimony on Trump cracks the wall of silence Read more\n\nImpeachment remains the biggest crisis of his presidency. While the House seems likely to enforce it, Trump will presumably be acquitted by the Republican Senate unless public opinion turns. This week, a Fox News poll asked \u201cShould the president be impeached and removed from office?\u201d Fifty-one per cent said yes and 43% said no.\n\nNothing, however, lubricates his cult of personality as much as his knack for turning liberals and the media into pantomime villains. It is his final firewall against impeachment.\n\nJoe Kaneble, 65, an office clerk, said: \u201cHe was our last-ditch effort to save America from socialist Democrats and the Hillary Clinton establishment. It was like the revolutionary war, as far as I\u2019m concerned.\u201d\n\nClinton beat Trump by 3m ballots in the popular vote but won in the electoral college. So who did Kaneble think will win the battle of 2020?\n\n\u201cAnother landslide,\u201d he said.", "description": "Gathering for a Minneapolis rally, backers see political games at work \u2013 though some raise doubts", "authors": ["David Smith"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e401baf6f0fb4f141c15885e8441ccdf73f42c56/0_63_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f316b6ae85858b7f53d753893787dc22", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
