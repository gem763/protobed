At the same time, however, much of the movie involves McBride's inner voice and psyche.\n\n\"Maybe James and I are both at an age where, you know, we probably lived more than we have left, and you start thinking about ... impermanence,\" Pitt said. \"You start thinking of ... your own personal values.\"\n\nPitt said his character was \"getting to a point\" where \"the life he's constructed doesn't work for him anymore.\"\n\nHe is \"forced to confront\" what he once avoided, Pitt added, \"dealing with ... the soul.\"\n\n\"I find myself drawn to projects -- with subject matter that -- that I'm already focused on,\" Pitt said. \"And the beautiful thing about what we get to do is you get to focus on it intensely.\"\n\n\"It's really coming to terms with knowing yourself, a full acceptance of yourself instead of a -- living with regrets or the grief we carry, the loneliness we carry,\" he said. \"I just believe that -- in being really open about that and understanding that in yourself ... which is not fun.\"\n\nStill, Pitt said, \"peace comes ... from that.\"\n\n\"And [it] makes me better with the people I love,\" he added.\n\nBecause of this, Pitt said he felt he brought an authenticity to the role.\n\n\"It is the universal human experience,\" he said. \"It's quite poetic that we have to go out to the abyss, the endless space, you know, which might as well be a grave, you know?\"\n\nPitt has had a whirlwind past few years and is finally putting peace ahead of pressure after his divorce from actress Angelina Jolie, with whom he has six children, and a year and a half in Alcoholics Anonymous. Now sober, he is even more in demand than ever after two major performances in 2019.\n\n\"This film ... is really delicate, and it walks the line because it's sincere,\" he said. \"It stands right on the line of being too earnest.\"\n\nThe film's title, \"Ad Astra,\" means \"to the stars,\" according to Pitt.\n\n\"I think it's, 'Through hardship, to the stars,'\" he explained. \"There's no avoiding it, so you better buckle up!\"", "description": "", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/brad-pitt-gty-jt-190904_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
