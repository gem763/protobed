They had a great performance against Georgia.\n\n'They're very much a confidence side so we'll have to be on top of our game and be defensively strong at the set-piece.\n\n'We've got a short turnaround of four games so a lot of the players who haven't had any rugby will get an opportunity then.\n\n'They'll be chomping at the bit to play against Uruguay.'", "description": "Wales will go into the quarter-finals with a mental edge if they leave their pool unbeaten, according to Warren Gatland.", "authors": ["Will Kelleher For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/05/22/19343246-0-image-a-61_1570310009503.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
