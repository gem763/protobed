But on Friday, October 18, a revealing interview with Duchess of Sussex Meghan Markle made the rounds online, in which she opens up about the intense media scrutiny that's followed her since she became a royal. Fans are now responding to the interview by rallying behind the Duchess of Sussex with messages of support.\n\nAn upcoming documentary Harry & Meghan: An African Journey follows Meghan Markle and Prince Harry on their recent royal tour of Southern Africa. In a teaser clip from the film, director Tom Bradby asks Markle how she's minding her physical and mental health amid the media scrutiny she's faced in recent months. Her answer is gut-wrenching. \u201cI would say\u2026look, any woman, especially when they\u2019re pregnant, you\u2019re really vulnerable,\u201d Markle says. \u201cSo that was made really challenging. And then when you have a newborn, you know?\n\n\"And especially as a woman, it\u2019s really, it\u2019s a lot,\" Markle continues in the clip. \"So if you add this on top of just trying to be a new mom or trying to be a newlywed, it\u2019s um\u2026. Yeah, well, I guess, and also thank you for asking because not many people have asked if I\u2019m okay. But it\u2019s a very real thing to be going through behind the scenes.\u201d\n\nFans online were stunned at the Duchess's honesty\u2014and at the difficulties she's faced in silence. So Greg Hogben, a writer, asked royal fans to share posts with #WeLoveYouMeghan to show their support.\n\nThe response was overwhelming. Thousands of fans have written messages to the Duchess with #WeLoveYouMeghan. One called her \"a true warrior\"; several others noted that her story's a potent reminder to treat everyone with kindness. Here's just a sample of the messages fans sent.\n\nHigh-profile voices have chimed into the conversation to share their support for the duchess, and to remind their followers that any role that comes with press attention can feel isolating. Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez retweeted the clip, noting that Markle's quick rise to notoriety was not unlike her own. \"Sudden prominence is a very dehumanizing experience,\" Ocasio-Cortez said. \"There\u2019s a part of your life that you lose, & it later dawns on you that you\u2019ll never get it back.\"\n\nThe official Sussex royal accounts haven't responded to the trending moment, but fans can hope that Markle may have seen their messages of support and love\u2014and that Markle now knows she's not alone.\n\nOriginally Appeared on Glamour\n\n", "description": "Fans are using the hashtag WeLoveYouMeghan after the Duchess opened up about intense media scrutiny.", "authors": ["Halie Lesavage"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/znByed.4fiJX3iec198zag--~B/aD0yMzk0O3c9MzU5MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/glamour_497/04471a433a075e5e3db7775579ff7367", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
