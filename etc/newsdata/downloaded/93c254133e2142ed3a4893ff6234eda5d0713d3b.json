The Nobel Prize?\u201d Her broad grin was practically audible. \u201cThis is just amazing news. We love him for what he did with Eritrea, and it\u2019s great that he is being recognized for it. Without peace, you can\u2019t grow.\u201d\n\nThe history of the Ethiopia-Eritrea war is dark and bloody. Over the course of 20 years, the two countries, brothers in culture and language, waged a vicious battle over land, politics and ideology. When war first broke out, in 1998, families that spanned both sides of the border found themselves split apart by violence. An estimated 80,000 died in the first two years of the conflict, cousins fighting cousins in what Eritrea called a war of independence. To the tribes that had historically occupied the border areas, it felt more like a civil war.\n\nA brief peace prevailed in 2000, only to collapse a few months later into a protracted, low level border conflict that consumed soldiers and massive amounts of wealth from both countries, draining national resources and depriving the citizenry of funds better spent on development. Reuniting families was all but impossible. \u201cIt was like a wall,\u201d says Hagos, a 24-year-old cart driver from the border town of Zalambesa, who grew up on the Ethiopian side even though his father was Eritrean.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

In a surprise move, he said he would hand a disputed border town over to Eritrea, in accordance with the terms of a long-neglected peace agreement from 2000. A few weeks later Abiy and Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki declared an end to the war between the two countries.\n\nThat same month, long dormant phone lines between the two nations were reconnected, and Ethiopians started calling random Eritrean numbers, just to say hello. Ethiopian Airlines resumed flights between Asmara, the Eritrean capital, and Addis Ababa. On a July 14 visit to Addis Ababa, Afwerki attended a state dinner, saying in a prepared speech: \u201cHenceforth, anyone who says Eritreans and Ethiopians are two different peoples is one that doesn\u2019t know the truth.\u201d\n\nOn Sept. 11, the border was reopened, allowing thousands to be reunited with their loved ones. Hagos\u2019 father had died in the conflict, but when he was finally able to meet the uncles and cousins he had never known, he says, \u201cI didn\u2019t feel like an orphan anymore.\u201d Alemu, whose mother was Eritrean, flew with her family to Asmara to meet cousins for the first time in 20 years.\n\nPeace between the two countries, while welcome, moves slowly. And domestically, Abiy\u2019s tenure as prime minister has been rocked by eruptions of ethnic violence even as he pushes for national unity. \u201c[His] hardest challenges lie ahead,\u201d said William Davison, Crisis Group Senior Analyst for Ethiopia. Afwerki, meanwhile, still presides over one of the most repressive states in the world, accused of major human rights violations and charged with using military conscription as a cover for forced labor in Eritrea \u2014one of many reasons, perhaps, that he was not invited to share the award with Abiy.\n\nThe border town of Zalambesa, where Hagos drives his pony cart, is periodically closed to all but Eritreans returning from Ethiopia, and even those numbers are but a trickle, as few Eritreans are allowed the necessary papers to leave. Still, as an example of how even the most deeply entrenched foes can bridge a seemingly unassailable divide, Abiy\u2019s unprecedented push for peace is reason for hope.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Over 20 years, Eritrea and Ethiopia waged a vicious battle over land, politics and ideology.
