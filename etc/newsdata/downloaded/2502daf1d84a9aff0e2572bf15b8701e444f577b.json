For starters, Schiff is a Clinton hatchet man. The background of the Schiff-Clinton relationship is an important part of the current impeachment farce and must not be overlooked.\n\nYou see, after President Bill Clinton was impeached by the U.S. House of Representatives and acquitted by the U.S. Senate in 1998-1999 for perjury and obstruction of justice, the Clintons and their loyal pack of political operatives made it a priority to defeat the Republicans House impeachment managers in the 2000 elections.\n\nOne of those races was against California Republican Representative James Rogan. Rogan took a leading role in the Clinton impeachment effort and became a top target for the Clinton team.\n\n'THIS IS JUST WRONG': STARR SAYS DEMS DOING DISSERVICE TO AMERICA BY SHROUDING INVESTIGATION IN SECRECY\n\nThe Democratic candidate in that race was none other than Adam Schiff; and it became such a priority that even Bill Clinton himself held a fundraiser for Schiff in Washington, D.C. It\u2019s virtually unheard of for a sitting president to headline a fundraiser for a single congressional candidate who\u2019s not an incumbent.\n\nAt the end of the day, Schiff defeated Rogan 53 to 44 percent and the Clintons got their pound of flesh in the race that was at the time the most expensive House race in history. That single House seat gained a ton of national attention and garnered headlines like, \u201cDemocrats hit Rogan to avenge Clinton.\u201d\n\nFast-forward twenty years. Adam Schiff is now the Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and leading the anti-Trump impeachment crusade and his political benefactors -- the Clintons -- are still seething.\n\nJust behind the scenes, the Clintons are once again out for revenge, unable to move on from the epic loss to President Trump in 2016. In fact, Hillary Clinton\u2019s pinned tweet remains one that is dated November 9, 2016, the day after she lost.\n\nIn judicial proceedings, witnesses have due process rights and the defense is allowed to investigate the credibility and motivations of the accusers. So far, those rights have been thrown out the window.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that with his latest partisan impeachment push, thanking the Clintons for their help two decades ago must be on Adam Schiff\u2019s mind. After all, in grand jury investigations like the one Schiff thinks he\u2019s running, motives matter.\n\nIf Schiff wants to run his fraudulent political impeachment inquiry like a wannabe special counsel with a secret grand jury, it cuts both ways.\n\nIn judicial proceedings, witnesses have due process rights and the defense is allowed to investigate the credibility and motivations of the accusers. So far, those rights have been thrown out the window.\n\nSchiff is making an enormous mistake by choosing not to conduct a public fact-finding investigation with a transparent process. Past impeachment inquiries have been run out in the open for a reason \u2013 nothing is more serious than attempting to remove a duly elected president from office and the American people should be able to see what\u2019s happening. Maybe Schiff didn\u2019t get the memo.\n\nAs a matter of basic fairness, everyone understands the importance of affording the accused with basic rights; and that includes cross-examination of witnesses and allowing the defense to call its own witnesses.\n\nFurthermore, the American people have a right to know if Schiff himself is a witness in this investigation. If Schiff\u2019s fairytale grand jury in the basement of the U.S. Capitol building has any credibility, Schiff\u2019s own role in concocting the latest attempt to impeach President Trump must come to light.\n\nWhy did Schiff lie about his staff\u2019s contact with the whistleblower? Does Schiff or members of his staff have a pre-existing relationship with the whistleblower? Does the whistleblower have a professional relationship with former Vice President Joe Biden, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton or former CIA Director John Brennan? These are critically important questions that must be answered.\n\nUnfortunately, House Republicans\u2019 effort to censure Schiff for his lies and abuse of power failed on a party-line vote, but the facts remain.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nCongressman Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, is exactly right when he says the American people understand basic fairness and see what Schiff\u2019s witch hunt is doing to a sitting president is unfair to its core.\n\nSince my time as Chief Investigator for the House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight, I\u2019ve seen firsthand that every time a committee chairman overreaches in a partisan investigation like Schiff is currently doing, the boomerang comes back to hit you twice as hard.\n\nSchiff seems to believe that he must stop blocking the whistleblower from testifying before Congress. I think the American people want the whistleblower to be identified. We must uncover how the plan was hatched to file the complaint with the Intelligence Community Inspector General in the first place.\n\nIn this atmosphere, where it seems everything is politically motivated, the American people have a right to know if this entire operation was inspired by operatives with Election Day 2020 on their minds.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe American people must be allowed to learn the origins of this whistleblower complaint. Who did the whistleblower discuss filing the complaint with? Was the whistleblower approached by individuals with a political mindset? Was anyone connected to a Democratic presidential campaign involved? Who are the other actors in the backstory?\n\nUnhinged, partisan Democrats are talking about impeaching the president of the United States of America. These important questions matter.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM DAVID BOSSIE", "description": "Rep.
