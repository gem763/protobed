Cultivated, they take little water, space and power to grow. Stored in the right way, mushrooms will last for weeks and can be preserved for months.\n\nTo store, remove them from any plastic packaging and refrigerate either in a paper bag or ceramic bowl, so any excess moisture can escape. Do not wash the mushrooms, because they will absorb the water and become slimy.\n\nThe moment your mushrooms start to turn, check they are OK by smelling them. If they still smell nice, cook up the whole batch \u2013 stalks, skin, the lot. I\u2019d recommend frying them finely diced with onions to make a sauce or soup (this could then be frozen, if necessary). Another way to prolong their life for a month or more is this 18th-century-inspired mushroom ketchup.\n\nCaramelised artichoke leaves with burrata and pesto recipe | Waste Not with Tom Hunt Read more\n\nMushroom ketchup\n\nThis recipe is based on an 18th-century mushroom catsup, but made more modern by giving it a thicker consistency. To make an 18th-century-style mushroom catsup, don\u2019t blend the mushrooms with the liquid: strain and press out the liquid using a fine sieve and the back of a ladle. The thin liquid should be used like Worcestershire sauce. Dry the remaining mushrooms by spreading out on trays in the sun or in the oven. I like to save electricity by drying the mushrooms alongside other items which I need to cook. Once they are completely dry, store them in a jar and use as a seasoning for plates of food or stews. Use this ketchup as a marinade for meats or vegetables or as a condiment with any meal. I particularly like it with eggs on toast for brunch.\n\nRest 8 hr+\n\nCook 30 min\n\nMakes enough for a 500ml bottle\n\n200g mushrooms, roughly chopped\n\n1 tsp sea salt\n\n\u00bd tsp black pepper\n\n1 small onion, finely chopped\n\n1 garlic clove, peeled\n\n1 bay leaf\n\n\u215b unwaxed organic lemon, including skin\n\n1 tsp grated horseradish or English mustard\n\n1 pinch all spice\n\n1 pinch nutmeg\n\n1 pinch cayenne\n\n80ml apple cider vinegar\n\nCombine all the ingredients in a bowl, mix well, cover and, if you have time, leave to rest for about eight hours or overnight.\n\nPour into a saucepan, bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer and cook for about 25 minutes, stirring occasionally.
