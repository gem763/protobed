The institute also revised its August reading to 157,000, down from 195,000.\n\nThe hiring data followed the lowest factory-activity readout in a decade, released by the Institute for Supply Management on Tuesday. The organization said its manufacturing index fell to 47.8 last month, missing forecasts of 49.1 and hitting its lowest point since June 2009.\n\nThe duo of weak readouts led to a resurgence of concern on Wednesday that the US economy could be bound for a slowdown as the US-China trade war weighs on producers. There's also worry that the slowdown could spread to consumers and lead to a decline in spending.\n\nMega-cap tech stocks were hit particularly hard. Shares of Apple fell by more than 2.5%; Google's parent, Alphabet, shed 2.3%; and Amazon slid by 1.3%.\n\nWithin the S&P 500 sectors, energy declined more than 2.5%, while consumer staples and financials fell close to 2%. Industrials and materials both tumbled 1.9%.\n\nRead more: The last 2 times stocks entered the 'Grey Zone' were before the tech bubble and the global financial crisis.
