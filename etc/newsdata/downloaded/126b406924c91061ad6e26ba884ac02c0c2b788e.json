'And I see things happening that are hard to understand.'\n\nThe 82-year-old former Secretary of State under President George W. Bush recalled to Trump's media fiasco with Hurricane Dorian to make his point, criticizing not only Trump for misrepresenting the facts about the storm hitting southeast Alabama, but also GOP party leaders in Congress and in Trump's administrations for failing to hold the Commander-in-Chief accountable for his obvious mistakes.\n\n'And in my time and [Madeleine Albright's] time, one of us would have gone to the president and said, \"Mr. President, you screwed up. So we gotta fix it. And we'll put out a correction,\" Powell said.\n\nTrump arrives at the White House after a visit to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Friday\n\nThe president insisted that he asked Ukraine's government to re-open investigations into Joe Biden and his family only out of an interest in fighting corruption while speaking the White House Press Corps on Friday\n\n'You know what [Republicans] did this time? They ordered the commerce department to go out and back up whatever the president has said. This is not the way the country is supposed to run. And Congress is one of the institutions that should be doing something about this. All parts of Congress.'\n\nPowell reminded the audience and viewers at home that in order for the U.S. to function properly its institutions have roles to play, including the media and the public at large.\n\n'We gotta remember that all of these pieces are part of our government - executive branch, Congress, Supreme Court and the Fourth Estate,' he said. 'We gotta remember what the Constitution started with. It's \"We the People,\" not, \"We the President.\"", "description": "Powell, a retired four-star general and former Secretary of State and Defense, was speaking with CNN's Fareed Sakaria when he laid into Trump and Republicans who back him on the Hill.", "authors": ["Chauncey Alcorn For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/07/19382214-0-image-a-73_1570429703472.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
