Miami allowed nearly 400 total yards in the first half to take a 42-10 deficit into halftime.\n\nThe Ravens offense deserves credit \u2014 Jackson completed 10 of his 11 passes for 210 yards and an impressive four touchdowns, including two long scoring strikes to Marquise Brown.\n\nBut the story of the first half was how lost the Dolphins defense looked while attempting to stop the Ravens attack. With solid protection against a lackluster defensive rush, Jackson had all the time in the world to watch plays develop, and drop passes into receivers' hands seemingly uncontested.\n\nThe Dolphins offense didn't fare much better, with Ryan Fitzpatrick going 12-22 with one touchdown and one interception through his first half as the Dolphins starting quarterback. Through 30 minutes of play, the Dolphins offense managed just nine total rushing yards, compared to 181 yards on the ground from the Ravens.\n\nIt was always going to be a tough year for Miami, who are clearly in rebuilding mode and as a team in between quarterbacks, likely wouldn't mind winding up the worst team in football and landing the first overall pick in the 2020 draft and the right to draft Alabama's Tua Tagovailoa.\n\nRead more: We ranked every NFL team's situation heading into the 2019 season\n\nThe Dolphins' front office all but committed to a year in the tank just before the start of the season when the team traded away left tackle Laremy Tunsil and wide receiver Kenny Stills to the Houston Texans in exchange for a boatload of picks in the next two drafts \u2014 a move that reportedly was met with a potential \"revolt\" from the Dolphins players.\n\nBut even if it was a part of the long term plan for the team, the Dolphins first half on the field was hard to watch.\n\nThe season is long, and there's still a chance that the Dolphins find some life and turn things around \u2014 Week 1 is no time to overreact to a small sample. But through one half of football, Miami has made a strong case for themselves as the worst team in football.\n\nJags linebacker Myles Jack goes berserk after being ejected from Jaguars-Chiefs game for throwing a punch\n\nIt took Patrick Mahomes just 96 seconds to throw his first touchdown pass of the 2019 NFL season\n\nWhy Antonio Brown can't play for the New England Patriots in Week 1\n\nTexas forced the LSU band to sit in the nosebleed seats in the pettiest move of the college football weekend", "description": "It was already looking like a rough year for the Dolphins, but their first half on Sunday showed this season might be even more painful than expected.", "authors": ["Tyler Lauletta"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d754b152e22af629e5acbd5-1536-768.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
