We're looking for some creativity and goals.\u201d\n\nAfter Greenwood\u2019s first senior goal against Astana earlier this month, Solskjaer described allowing Lukaku and Sanchez to leave as \u201cthe right decision\u201d.\n\nThe failure to replace them, however, is not ideal. Talks with Juventus for both Paulo Dybala and later Mario Mandzukic broke down, leaving United with limited options.\n\nSolskjaer conceded that United wanted a new striker this summer, but said: \u201cThere were strikers, but they weren't the ones we wanted. We couldn't get the one we wanted.\n\n\u201cIf we had the right one, if it was there, we would have. It was time for Rom to go. He knows that. He didn't want to be here. What is the point in having players that don't want to be here?\n\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s no point getting players in that you're not 100 per cent sure about. When you get players in, you need the right ones that are going to stay here for a longer period.\n\n\u201cThat's the long-term thinking we have to show. I cannot think: \u2018I need a player because this is my reputation\u2019. No, it's the club.\u201d", "description": "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has revealed that Manchester United\u2019s next priority in the transfer market will be a forward, with a move possible in the forthcoming January window.
