The initial phase would also include chapters on structural agricultural issues and currencies.\n\nMnuchin said Treasury had not determined how to address its designation of Beijing as a currency manipulator in its October currency report, which was due on Tuesday. He said the two sides had agreed on currency provisions last week, which will be reviewed \"as we put out the report\".\n\nThe Treasury chief also said some conversations with the governor of China's central bank, Yi Gang, had eased some Treasury concerns.\n\n\"I'm not prepared to go into the details of them other than to say that there were certain issues that he did get us more comfortable on, and more information,\" Mnuchin added.", "description": "US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin says phone conferences are being held and would travel to Beijing if necessary.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/17/83869aa52f99460a843cddc030697abf_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
