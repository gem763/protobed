If she and Trump's DOJ can find common cause investigating Big Tech's power, that would be one more sign of the issue's bipartisan appeal.\n\nDetails: James is expected to meet with Attorney General William Barr, Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen and Associate Attorney General for antitrust Makan Delrahim, the person familiar with the plans said. A bipartisan group of state attorneys general is also expected to join the meeting, the person said.\n\nStates investigating Google for anticompetitive practices \u2014 including Texas and New York \u2014 sent representatives to meet with top DOJ officials in July to discuss tech antitrust issues.\n\nThe Justice Department and FTC split jurisdiction over major tech companies for competition concerns earlier this year, with the FTC taking up an antitrust investigation into Facebook. But, as Bloomberg reported, Barr prodded his agency to begin its own Facebook inquiry, prompting concerns from both FTC chairman Joe Simons and Republican Sen. Mike Lee about overlapping investigations.\n\nWhat they're saying: Spokespersons for the Justice Department and New York attorney general's office declined comment.\n\nThe bottom line: Pressure on Facebook and other tech companies is building from state capitals to Washington, where lawmakers and regulators are conducting their own investigations into the power of tech.", "description": "The meeting could be the precursor for the state-level antitrust investigation making common cause with the Justice Department.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/48su8btHEeO15Nq6A15Q_hkTbxE=/0x152:5178x3065/1920x1080/2019/10/06/1570399940275.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
