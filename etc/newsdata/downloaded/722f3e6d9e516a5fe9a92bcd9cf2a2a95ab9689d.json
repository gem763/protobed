The Socialists and Democrats\u2019 Kathleen Van Brempt, however, told POLITICO that his answers on green rules in the Mercosur trade deal with South America had been \u201cvery vague\u201d and \u201cnot good enough.\u201d\n\nOn Monday evening, three officials said Hogan would win the green light on Tuesday, but that his letter of approval would make some additional requests about the enforceability of green and labor rules in trade deals.\n\nBernd Lange, the trade committee chair, told POLITICO that Hogan \"delivered a B in the hearing, no mistakes, but sometimes a little vague and few very clear commitments. Now there will be an evaluation letter tomorrow, which will include some homework as well.\"\n\nHere are five key takeaways from his hearing:\n\nHe was tougher on China than expected\n\nHogan\u2019s hearing was music to the ears of French President Emmanuel Macron, who has sought more robust trade defenses against China.\n\nHogan said he wanted more muscle in EU measures to screen investments from China, even though that harder line faces resistance in Eastern Europe. He also vowed to press ahead with EU rules on \u201creciprocity.\u201d\n\nThese are a big French priority and effectively mean that Europe can shut public tenders for projects like roads and railways to Asian bidders, if Asian countries do not open their markets to EU bidders. Armed with this tougher approach, Hogan reckoned he could secure an investment deal with China by 2020.\n\nThe EU trade enforcer is for real\n\nThere was more good news for France when Hogan mapped out the status of a new position for the European Commission: a trade enforcer, exactly as sought by Paris. \u201cI see this as a deputy director general status in the department of trade and that it will have terms of reference that will actually give it some teeth\u201d to take on countries that are found in breach of World Trade Organization rules on matters like intellectual property, are subsidizing industries or demanding technology transfers, Hogan said, in a thinly veiled allusion to China.\n\nThe showdown with the US is likely to overshadow Hogan\u2019s mandate\n\nThere was plenty of discussion about impending U.S. tariffs on Airbus, which could come as early as Tuesday, and about Donald Trump\u2019s all-out assault on the World Trade Organization, which the U.S. president thinks is biased toward China.\n\nWhile Hogan said he was \u201ccommitted to working on a positive transatlantic agenda,\u201d it was quite clear that it might come to blows. In the tariff domain, Hogan insisted that he was willing to hit back: \u201cEurope has to stand up for itself,\u201d he said.\n\nIn terms of the WTO, whose arbitration court could collapse in December under U.S. pressure, Hogan said that he would take a \u201cplurilateral\u201d approach of trying to keep the system alive with like-minded allies in the face of opposition from the White House.\n\n... Unless it\u2019s Brexit that overshadows the mandate\n\nHogan was unusually tight-lipped on Brexit but did say that he would work with the Parliament to ensure a \u201clevel-playing field\u201d in trade and prevent the U.K. from undercutting EU standards through regulatory divergence. Much attention has focused on whether U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson would seek to weaken restrictions on genetically-modified organisms after Brexit, but Hogan didn\u2019t give much detail on where Britain might pose a threat.\n\nHe was well-prepared but unconvincing on ethical trade\n\nThe commissioner-designate faced lots of questions on the increasing role of environmental and labor rights in trade agreements, but his answers left socialists such as Van Brempt unimpressed. South Korea was raised as a particularly embarrassing example of a country where the EU has failed to use trade leverage effectively to improve labor standards.\n\nHogan, however, insisted that trade did work as leverage and gave the Mercosur agreement with Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay as an example. He argued that Brazil\u2019s President Jair Bolsonaro would never have made any commitments on the environment if it weren\u2019t for the EU deal. He did, however, concede that the situation was serious, in an apparent reference to the fires and increased deforestation under Bolsonaro. \u201cAll of us are appalled by what we see in the Amazon,\u201d he said.\n\nJakob Hanke and Hans von der Burchard contributed reporting.", "description": "Unconfrontational hearing looked more like a coronation than a grilling.", "authors": ["Christian Oliver", "Maxime Schlee"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1172554600-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
