In mid-July, dozens of activists of various ideological stripes gathered in Washington, D.C., to publicly protest a group they all view as a common foe \u2014 the National Iranian American Council (NIAC).\n\nThe demonstration was the culmination of growing outrage on the part of the Iranian diaspora with the activities of NIAC, which in recent years has unilaterally appointed itself the advocate for America\u2019s nearly 1 million-person Iranian expatriate community \u2014 and used that perch to advance policies overwhelmingly favorable to Iran\u2019s clerical regime.\n\nIndeed, although ostensibly a \u201cnonpartisan, nonprofit organization,\u201d NIAC was a key member of the \u201cecho chamber\u201d created by the Obama administration to sell its 2015 nuclear deal with Iran to a skeptical American public. Since then, further revelations regarding the group\u2019s close, ongoing coordination with the Iranian regime \u2014 in particular its wily foreign minister, Javad Zarif \u2014 have put to rest any lingering doubts that NIAC was and remains an ardent advocate for the Islamic Republic.\n\nThe July rally was intended as a public condemnation of this activism, and it naturally drew significant media attention from a bevy of media outlets, ranging from the BBC to RT. Yet, one was conspicuously absent. The Voice of America\u2019s Persian News Network, which serves as the U.S. government\u2019s principal Persian-language broadcaster, opted not to cover the protests. In the process, it re-ignited a long-simmering debate over the state of American outreach toward Iran and its people.\n\nFor years, VOA has been the target of scathing criticism from Iran-watchers and opposition activists alike for its failure to properly explain U.S. policy, its perceived bias in favor of the Iranian regime, and widespread internal mismanagement and corruption. VOA\u2019s credibility has suffered greatly as a result, with the service becoming overshadowed by foreign counterparts like BBC Persian and Manoto, which are uniformly viewed as being both more credible and more dynamic.\n\nAll of that, however, was supposed to be a thing of the past. Over the past year, in response to widespread criticism (including a 2017 study chaired by this author), the government agency overseeing U.S. international broadcasting, now known as the U.S. Agency for Global Media, launched an overhaul of its Persian-language outreach. The effort was intended to create a more nimble, responsive and politically engaged service, and resulted in the launch this pring of a 24/7 television and digital channel dubbed VOA 365.\n\nBut while these upgrades do indeed boast some improvements to programming and content, many problematic practices (including the arbitrary censorship of influential opposition voices) still persist. Perhaps more significantly, VOA\u2019s outreach to Iran still seems to be missing a crucial ingredient \u2014 a real strategy to better explain U.S. policy, deliver improved coverage of Iranian domestic politics and provide a more representative picture of conditions within the Islamic Republic.\n\nAll of which should matter a great deal to the White House. Over the past year, the Trump administration\u2019s campaign of \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d has succeeded in significantly impacting prosperity and stability within the Islamic Republic. In the process, it has given a much-needed shot in the arm to the Iranian opposition, which \u2014 for perhaps the first time in four decades \u2014 now senses that a collapse of Iran\u2019s repressive regime could be an actual possibility.\n\nYet, in order to engage this critical constituency, America\u2019s Iran policy needs to be coupled with a robust messaging capability \u2014 one that engages Iran\u2019s captive population, signals U.S. support for meaningful change within the country and explains exactly how Washington is working to make such change happen.\n\nSo far, the U.S. government\u2019s official Persian-language outreach has fallen far short of that mark. And as a result, it remains at best a peripheral part of America\u2019s approach to Iran. At worst, it serves as a clear detriment to it.\n\nThe White House should make it a priority to change this sorry state of affairs, and do so without delay. The long-term success of its Iran strategy could very well depend on it.\n\n\u2022 Ilan Berman is senior vice president of the American Foreign Policy Council in Washington, D.C.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
