The government\u2019s opponents claim Johnson illegally shut down the legislature to prevent lawmakers from scrutinizing his Brexit plans.\n\nGovernment lawyer James Eadie told 11 Supreme Court justices that the decision to send lawmakers home until Oct. 14 was \u201cinherently and fundamentally political in nature,\u201d and not a matter for the judiciary. He said that if the court intervened it would violate the \u201cfundamental constitutional principle\u201d of the separation of powers.\n\nBut a lawyer for lawmakers challenging the shutdown accused the government of being \u201cunworthy of our trust.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got here the mother of parliaments being shut down by the father of lies,\u201d said attorney Aidan O\u2019Neill. He urged the judges to \u201cstand up for truth, stand up for reason, stand up for diversity, stand up for Parliament, stand up for democracy.\u201d\n\nThe judges, for their part, wondered why Johnson had refused to provide a sworn statement to the court about his reasons for the suspension.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it odd that nobody has signed a witness statement to say: \u2018This is true. These are the true reasons for what was done\u2019?\u201d said one of the judges, Nicholas Wilson.\n\nThe developments were the latest in a rocky week for Johnson, who pulled out of a news conference with the prime minister of Luxembourg on Monday because of noisy protesters nearby. On Wednesday he was berated by the father of a sick child over funding cuts to Britain\u2019s health service as he visited a London hospital.\n\nJohnson took power in July with a vow that Britain will leave the EU on Oct. 31 \u201ccome what may.\u201d He promised to break a stalemate that saw the Brexit agreement struck between the EU and Johnson\u2019s predecessor Theresa May rejected three times by Britain\u2019s Parliament, prompting May to resign.\n\nMany lawmakers believe a no-deal Brexit would be economically devastating and socially destabilizing, and have put obstacles in Johnson\u2019s path, including legal challenges to the Parliament shutdown.\n\nLast week, Scotland\u2019s highest civil court ruled the move illegal, saying it had the intention of stymieing Parliament. The High Court in London, however, said it was not a matter for the courts.\n\nThe Supreme Court is being asked to decide who is right in a three-day hearing that ends Thursday. If it overturns the suspension, lawmakers could be called back to Parliament as early as next week.\n\nJohnson insists he is working hard to get an agreement with the EU that will ensure a smooth departure. EU leaders are skeptical of that claim.\n\nEuropean Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said Wednesday that the risk of a no-deal Brexit remained \u201cvery real\u201d because Britain still had not produced workable new proposals.\n\n\u201cI asked the British prime minister to specify the alternative arrangements that he could envisage,\u201d Juncker said. \u201cAs long as such proposals are not made, I cannot tell you \u2014 while looking you straight in the eye \u2014 that progress is being made.\u201d\n\nJuncker, who met with Johnson on Monday, told a gathering of the European Parliament that a no-deal Brexit \u201cmight be the choice of the U.K., but it will never be ours.\u201d\n\nThe main sticking point over a Brexit deal is the Irish border \u201cbackstop,\u201d an insurance policy that would require Britain to respect EU trade and customs rules in order to avoid a hard border between EU member Ireland and the U.K.\u2019s Northern Ireland until a better solution is found.\n\nPro-Brexit British politicians oppose the backstop because it would prevent the U.K. from striking new trade deals around the world. Johnson says he won\u2019t back any Brexit deal unless the backstop is removed.\n\nBut the EU sees the measure as essential to ensuring an open border, which underpins the local economy and the peace process that ended decades of violence in Northern Ireland.\n\n\u201cI have no sentimental attachment to the backstop,\u201d Juncker said. But he added that he remains committed to the purpose it serves, which is to prevent border structures that could be detrimental to peace in Northern Ireland.\n\n\u201cThat is why I called on the British prime minister to come forward with concrete proposals, operational and in writing, on all alternatives that would allow us to reach these objectives,\u201d Juncker said.\n\nEU chief negotiator Michel Barnier said there was no point \u201cpretending to negotiate.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s our responsibility to continue this process with determination and sincerity,\u201d said Barnier, who offered to keep working \u201cnight and day\u201d in order to find a deal that could satisfy both sides.\n\nHe said that if Britain left without a deal, major problems would still have to be resolved, including the future of U.K. and EU citizens hit by Brexit, peace in Northern Ireland and the protection of the EU\u2019s single market and the Irish economy.\n\n\u201cNone of these questions disappears,\u201d Barnier said. \u201cWe need legally operative solutions in the withdrawal agreement to respond precisely to each problem \u2014 to address each risk \u2014 that Brexit creates.\u201d\n\nLawmakers in the European Parliament pledged Wednesday to reject any deal without a backstop and insisted Britain would be \u201csolely responsible for a no-deal departure.\u201d The legislature must endorse any Brexit deal for it to be implemented.\n\nEuropean lawmakers also agreed to support a delay if Britain asked for one. They adopted a non-binding resolution supporting another extension to the Brexit deadline, which has already been postponed twice.\n\nJust before the suspension, Britain\u2019s Parliament passed a law ordering the government to seek a three-month delay to Brexit if no agreement has been reached by late October.\n\nJohnson says he will not seek a delay under any circumstances, though it\u2019s not clear how he can avoid it.", "description": "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was accused by European Union officials Wednesday of failing to negotiate seriously and branded the \u201cfather of lies\u201d by...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR591_juncke_ZG_20190918181818.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
