She attended high school near Lincoln Center in Manhattan, where many students wore brand-name clothes and returned from holiday break with the latest gadgets. When she went to Brown University, her friends were often going bowling or eating at Chipotle, CMG, +1.06% activities she couldn\u2019t afford on a regular basis.\n\nSo she opened her first credit card at 18 years old, with a $1,500 limit. \u201cI never had that much money before,\u201d she said. She used that credit card \u2014 and three others she opened during her college years \u2014 for textbooks and a laptop, as well as trips to the movies and restaurants. By the time she graduated, she had nearly $20,000 in debt \u2014 $15,000 in credit card debt and $5,000 from a student loan. Her credit card interest rates were around 21%.\n\nSee: Financial literacy skills have taken a nose dive since the Great Recession\n\nA $9 book called \u201cWomen and Money\u201d by Suze Orman caught her eye one day while she was buying shampoo at Duane Reade. \u201cThat book taught me everything I wish I knew before I was 18,\u201d she said. She spent the next few years reading up on saving and investing, and listening to podcasts and TED talks about financial topics.\n\n\u201cI became obsessed with knowledge I felt I was deprived from,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was social justice and financial empowerment, and that combination helped fuel my curiosity to learn as much as I could.\u201d She started her own YouTube channel, MissBeHelpful, to share some of her own lessons about money as well.\n\nAfter the YouTuber paid off her debts, in less than two years, she opened her first Roth IRA and then allocated whatever debt payments she used to make into savings and investing. Three years after that, in March 2018, she had amassed just shy of $50,000. In the last 18 months, she\u2019s doubled her net worth. Part of her inspiration was the goal to eventually have a comfortable retirement.\n\nEspinal, now 30, is the director of educational outreach at Next Gen Personal Finance, a nonprofit organization that offers free resources and tools to educators interested in teaching personal finance.\n\nLess than half of U.S. states have a financial literacy requirement for high-school students. Financial illiteracy is a growing problem in the U.S., especially for young adults. Less than one-third of college students (28%) could correctly answer three multiple-choice questions about interest, inflation and risk diversification, according to a 2015-2016 FINRA study, and slightly more than half (53%) could do the same.\n\nAlthough financial literacy is useful, there is a debate about when and how to dispense these lessons. Presidential candidate Andrew Yang tweeted in September that, in his experience, teaching financial literacy is difficult to people who don\u2019t have money. Some Twitter users criticized him for the statement, saying individuals can make the most of the lessons they learned when they finally do come into money, while others agreed with him that having the funds beforehand allows people to put their financial education to use immediately.\n\nStill, there are steps anyone can take to get started on the path to financial freedom \u2014 and eventually a nest egg like Espinal\u2019s. Here are a few:\n\nDon\u2019t miss: Money expert Jean Chatzky on how Americans should save for retirement and what you\u2019re getting wrong about the FIRE movement\n\nEmbrace as much information as you can\n\nMuch of Espinal\u2019s success can be traced back to her thirst for knowledge, and all the time she spent reading up on financial topics and soaking up information in podcasts and shows about money.\n\n\u201cWhen you don\u2019t know about your money and you don\u2019t know about money, you are in this helpless place,\u201d she said. \u201cLearn as much as you can and look at your situation.\u201d\n\nThere are plenty of benchmarks and metrics online to measure how well an individual is doing compared with her peers. Sometimes these guidelines can be useful, as a way to gauge what is average, but sometimes they can be discouraging. The key, Espinal said, is simply to assess your current financial situation, and see if there are any tweaks that can be made to spending and saving, as well as other personal factors, like the interest rate you\u2019re being charged on your loans or the payment schedule that\u2019s set up. Espinal said the interest rates were about five times as high as what she would have been charged if she\u2019d taken out student loans instead, but she didn\u2019t realize that until it was too late.\n\nStrike a balance between spending and saving\n\nEvery dollar in a paycheck matters to someone who is living paycheck to paycheck. Although it might seem impossible to part with that money to pay down debt as well as save for retirement and other future goals, it is imperative, Espinal said.\n\nSome people may find they are spending on products and services they don\u2019t actually care that much about \u2014 such as one too many happy hour tabs or a superfluous subscription box (it doesn\u2019t always have to be a cup of coffee or avocado toast).\n\nMany financial advisers suggest putting aside 10% (or more) of a salary for retirement, but that\u2019s not always feasible. For people who can\u2019t afford that, Espinal suggests cutting that rate in half. And if that seems impossible, try putting 3%. The goal is to set aside something \u2014 anything \u2014 even when money is tight. This is especially true when an employee has access to an employer-match, which is essentially free money. In that case, most financial experts will say put at least the amount to meet the full match.\n\nAlso see: This new \u2018Broke Millennial\u2019 book has secrets for young people who don\u2019t want to think about retirement\n\n\u2018Automate, automate, automate\u2019\n\nMaking financial decisions can be stressful, especially when there isn\u2019t that much money in the budget \u2014 that may lead people to making the less optimal choice. Automating financial decisions, such as saving a set percentage of every paycheck or when to pay off credit card debt, can support good financial habits, said Tim Ranzetta, co-founder of Next Gen Personal Finance, where Espinal works. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to set aside money for the future when the current situation feels so urgent,\u201d he said. \u201cAutomating it means you don\u2019t even have to think about it.\u201d\n\nThe first savings goal should be an emergency account, which can help pay for an unexpected car repair or a trip to the hospital. Eventually, people can use automation to create and build an investment account, Ranzetta said.\n\nAutomatic deposits and automatic escalation of retirement contributions has proven to help Americans for decades. Richard Thaler, who received the Nobel Prize in economics in 2017, is credited with helping Americans put nearly $30 billion in their retirement accounts, because of his and colleagues\u2019 research on behavioral finance and auto-enrollment and auto-escalation.\n\nTalk about it\n\nMoney isn\u2019t the easiest thing to talk about, but it\u2019s important. Parents can teach their children a lot about finances, as can their children eventually teach them when they\u2019re older. Friends and family members should try being more open about these discussions, which can help in many ways, including knowing they\u2019re not alone in a difficult situation or finding useful advice for a problem.\n\nOpening up about your financial situation can also mean finding an accountability partner, said Joe Buhrmann, manager of financial planning support at Country Financial. Friends can become accountability partners, looking for budget-friendly activities and meals, or emotional support systems.\n\nLook for a side hustle\n\nNot everyone has the time or means to create a side income stream or work another job, but it\u2019s one surefire way to make extra money to put toward debt, and eventually savings. Espinal said she juggled a few jobs to earn more, especially when she was paying down all of her debt. She\u2019d tutor on Saturday mornings, which seemed like a sacrifice when friends were on their way to the beach, but it ensured she\u2019d get to a place where was financially comfortable. \u201cGet creative coming up with income,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s 2019. There are so many ways to find side gigs and hustles.\u201d", "description": "The Brooklyn native grew up in a low-income neighborhood with a family working hard to make a living.", "authors": ["Alessandra Malito"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS656_yanely_ZG_20191004091643.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
