Here are edited excerpts from the conversation.\n\nKyle, now that you finally get to make a solo for Misty, is it as you imagined?\n\nKYLE ABRAHAM It\u2019s better. In 2012, I imagined her coming out with a boombox to this remix of the Ciara song \u201cGoodies.\u201d That would have been a strictly a show-off kind of thing, and I don\u2019t think either of us feel we have to do that now. The more I get to know Misty, the more I want to show aspects of her artistry that people aren\u2019t always given the chance to see. That\u2019s why I wanted to make something with a simmer to it.\n\nMISTY COPELAND There are these expectations of what people have seen you do or what they think you can do. But I\u2019ve been realizing what\u2019s valuable to me and what kinds of works I want to be a part of. I love the tradition of ballet \u2014 the deep, rich history \u2014 but there are some things we have to let go of. So I feel this is the perfect moment to delve into something different and a new language for this generation.", "description": "He is making a solo for her at a point in their careers when neither feels a need to show off.", "authors": ["Brian Seibert"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/02/arts/01kyle-misty3/02kyle-misty3-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
