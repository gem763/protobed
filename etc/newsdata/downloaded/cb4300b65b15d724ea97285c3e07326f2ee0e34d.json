He thinks he's into his red wine. Ask him for a glass of red wine and he'll pour it out and sniff it.\"\n\nTowards the end of the interview, Stokes told of the nasty story behind his gnarled right hand.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\"I fell off a wall in Cockermouth when I was 18,\" he said. \"The slate on the top of the wall was loose and I tried to jump up and sit on it.\n\n\"I ended up falling backwards and the tile ended up falling back onto my hand.\"\n\nStokes then holds up his hand to show Bullard who says: \"Wow, that's evil!\"\n\n\"Disregard that,\" Stokes replies, holding his bent fingers. \"That's cricket injuries.\"", "description": "The England cricket hero opened up on his favourite film, actor, chosen super power and much, much more", "authors": ["Joe Cooper", "Image", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20708904.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Jimmy-Bullard-speaking-with-Ben-Stokes.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
