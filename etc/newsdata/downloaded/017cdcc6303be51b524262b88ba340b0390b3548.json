The prequel, which shot a pilot over the summer starring Naomi Watts and written by showrunner Jane Goldman, was set \u201cthousands of years before the events of Game of Thrones\u201d and would have portrayed \u201cthe world\u2019s descent from the golden Age of Heroes into its darkest hour.\u201d\n\nDeadline doesn\u2019t give a direct reason for HBO\u2019s decision not to proceed with a series order, but it does note that there were rumors of issues during the filming of the pilot over the summer. That echoes stories that the original Game of Thrones had a terrible pilot, which was wildly different from the final version that ended up on-screen. HBO reportedly had to reshoot more than 90 percent of the episode before it aired, kicking off the cultural juggernaut the series eventually became.\n\nHBO has other \u2018GOT\u2019 spinoff ideas in the works\n\nThe canceled series \u2014 rumored at one point to be called The Long Night \u2014 is by no means the only Game of Thrones spinoff in the works. HBO originally commissioned five prequel and spinoff ideas before the original show even ended. Back in May 2019, A Song of Ice and Fire creator George R.R. Martin said three of those ideas were \u201cedging closer\u201d to reality.\n\nOne of those three is presumably the now-canceled Watts series, which would still leave at least two others in the mix. We might know one of those other ideas, too: Deadline reported in September that HBO was close to giving a pilot order for a second series based on an idea from Martin and Colony co-creator Ryan Condal. That series would adapt Fire and Blood, Martin\u2019s fictional history book detailing the Targaryen dynasty.\n\nGiven Game of Thrones\u2019 massive popularity, it\u2019s practically guaranteed that HBO will continue the series in one form or another. But whatever comes next for the franchise, it seems that the Goldman series won\u2019t be part of it.", "description": "HBO\u2019s first Game of Thrones spinoff reportedly isn\u2019t moving past the pilot stage.
