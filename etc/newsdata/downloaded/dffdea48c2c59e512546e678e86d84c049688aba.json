Our readers\u2019 curiosity shapes our inspiration and ultimately our next adventure, and based on this year\u2019s list, we\u2019ll be making plenty of new discoveries.\u201d\n\nSeveral marquee choices filled the lineup, but there were also more than a few surprises sprinkled throughout. In Los Angeles, for instance, iconic hotels like the Beverly Hills Hotel, the Chateau Marmont and the Beverly Wilshire spring immediately to mind. But none of them topped the rankings.\n\nAlso see: Chicago named favorite big city in U.S. among tourists for three years running\n\nNo, that honor belongs to the recently renovated SLS Hotel in Beverly Hills, where rooms are currently listed starting at $339 a night.\n\nSLS Hotel Beverly Hills The SLS Hotel in Beverly Hills.\n\n\u201cThe chic Philippe Starck decor at this Los Angeles hotspot rockets guests into the future as soon as they walk in,\u201d Cond\u00e9 Nast said, pointing out that chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s runs the food program. \u201cThe hotel has retained the playground-esque feel that Starck created through a unique blend of dining, drinking, and lounge spaces that are mostly decorated with mid-century modern furnishings, with surrealist touches.\u201d\n\nIn the fourth spot in the rankings is another Los Angeles hotel that perhaps flies more under the radar than the others: 1 Hotel West Hollywood. Rooms on this busy corner of the Sunset Strip are currently starting at just over $300 a night.\n\n1 Hotel West Hollywood.\n\n\u201cIt makes sense then that you feel as if you\u2019ve stepped far from Los Angeles when you walk into the lower-level lobby, with exposed wood beams on the ceiling, natural-toned fabrics on the couches and chairs and the lobby bar, and, yes, even more plants,\u201d Cond\u00e9 Nast wrote in the description. \u201cThe WeHo location is 1 Hotel\u2019s first West Coast outpost \u2014 and it maintains all of the brand\u2019s sustainable initiatives. From a chef\u2019s garden filled with herbs and veggies for the four on-site restaurants and carpets made from recycled plastics pulled out of the ocean, it\u2019s a floor-to-roof mission.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the top 10:\n\n10. Rosewood Luang Prabang Northern Laos 9. Beau-Rivage Palace Lausanne, Switzerland 8. Monastero Santa Rosa Hotel & Spa Amalfi Coast, Italy 7. Rambagh Palace (Taj) Jaipur, India 6. Royal Mansour Marrakech, Morocco 5. Four Seasons Hotel at The Surf Club Miami 4. 1 Hotel West Hollywood, Calif. 3. Taj Lake Palace Rajasthan, India 2. Baur au Lac Zurich, Switzerland 1.
