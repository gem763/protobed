However, he'll have to dive deeper if he hopes to catch fish, the volunteer explained.\n\nLazarus moved to Owl Rescue Centre last month after spending his early years at a sanctuary with no open water.\n\nHe was abandoned as a pup and has never had to opportunity to master the art of swimming until now.\n\nCape clawless otters spend 18 months with their mothers in the wild, learning to fend for themselves.\n\nThe animals are capable of being nocturnal and diurnal. They hunt in fresh water or sea water on coasts and wetlands across Africa.", "description": "Lazarus, a three-year-old Cape clawless otter, spent his early years on a reserve with no open water but has now been trained to hunt at the Owl Rescue Centre in Hartbeespoort.", "authors": ["Sebastian Murphy-Bates For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/01/19565642-0-image-a-9_1570755137636.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
