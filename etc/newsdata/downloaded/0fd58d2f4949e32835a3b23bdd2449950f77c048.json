And within the party there is growing frustration that Steyer\u2019s time, efforts and resources would be better spent further bankrolling the pro-impeachment project he started years ago than in a long-shot presidential campaign that many view as a vanity project.\n\n\u201cIt just shows he doesn\u2019t believe in anything other than trying to buy the presidency,\u201d said Adam Jentleson, public affairs director at Democracy Forward and a pro-impeachment advocate.\n\nWhile Need to Impeach is now jumping into the impeachment ad wars, it is already playing catch-up. The group spent just $5,309 on Facebook ads this past week, according to the social media site\u2019s online database. By contrast, Steyer\u2019s presidential campaign has spent $382,783 during that time frame. Both Trump and the RNC spent more than $2.1 million on Facebook ads during that same time period, about a quarter of which was devoted to hitting the impeachment issue.\n\nAlberto Lammers, Steyer\u2019s campaign spokesman, scoffed at criticism that Steyer wasn\u2019t doing enough, saying that the current landscape around impeachment actually vindicated his boss\u2019 decision to enter the presidential race.\n\n\u201cHe is partially responsible for getting the House there before this whole thing broke,\u201d he said, noting that Need to Impeach had more than 8.3 million members on its email list. \u201cHe started Need to Impeach against the wishes of the leaders of the Democratic Party because he knew it was the right thing to do and now it is all coming to fruition. And the things he has done with impeachment he can do elsewhere: getting the corporate corruption out of politics and acting on climate change and health care immediately.\u201d\n\nBut the ad spending disparities has prompted renewed criticisms within some corners of the party about the merits and value of Steyer\u2019s presidential bid and it has led to more dire warnings that Dems may fumble a historically significant moment.\n\n\u201cThe inequality in online ad spending between Trump allies and Dems is a potential crisis,\u201d warned Zach Petkanas, a party strategist and former aide to Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign.\n\nSteyer\u2019s presidential campaign advertising has not been entirely without a pro-impeachment push. Indeed, the issue has been featured in some of his spots, including a recent television ad his campaign aired on Fox & Friends. And a campaign spokesman said that they are currently readying a new digital and television ad on impeachment that will be unveiled over the coming days.\n\nBut the main focus of the campaign\u2019s ad blitz remains on bolstering his long-shot presidential effort. Of the 65 ads he is currently running on Facebook, 49 focus on items other than impeachment, and many of the spots he has run on television have been geared towards early state voters and not a national audience writ large. The ad that they are set to launch, for example, will be shown only in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada.\n\nCompared to other entities, however, Steyer\u2019s network of organizations is actually making robust investments in the pro-impeachment ad campaigns. Almost all of the online ad spending being placed by presidential campaigns is on their own election efforts. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), has emphasized that she was one of the first presidential candidates to call for impeachment. But of the hundreds of current ads she is running on Facebook, just 16 are devoted to that topic, according to an analysis of Facebook\u2019s database.\n\nAnd Priorities USA, the Democratic Party\u2019s top super PAC, said it has no plans to adjust its current 2020 ad campaign strategy in response to the launch of impeachment proceedings and the Trump campaign\u2019s investments.\n\n\u201cRather than respond to this gambit,\u201d the PAC\u2019s president Guy Cecil said, \u201cPriorities USA will continue to commit our resources to our $100 million program holding Trump accountable in key states for his record on health care, wages and the kitchen table issues that Americans struggle with on a daily basis.\u201d\n\nWithin this vacuum, the effort to sway voters on the impeachment question has fallen largely to the Democratic Party. But even there, expenditures have been paltry compared to the sums dropped by Trump\u2019s political apparatus. The Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Governors Association have led the party\u2019s Facebook ad strategy on the impeachment issue. According to Bully Pulpit data, they spent less than $16,000 on Facebook ads relating to impeachment last week.\n\nA DNC official noted that, in addition to Facebook, their impeachment ads were appearing on \u201cGoogle, and Twitter\u2019s in-platform audiences of users who have displayed interest in Democratic politics and progressive allies, as well as lookalike audiences made from matched lists of various DNC donor segments.\u201d The official also noted that the ads had \u201ccontributed to September being our best month of email acquisition of the year.\u201d\n\nThat Democrats find themselves being outgunned on the ad wars right as impeachment is picking up steam on the Hill is, in part, the byproduct of strategic decisions made weeks ago. Kevin Mack, the lead strategist on Need to Impeach noted that over the summer, the group shifted its focus from ad spending to grassroots organizing as it reconsidered whether it made sense to continue to target specific House Democrats. Mack conceded that the group\u2019s $3.1 million TV ad expenditure wouldn\u2019t even the scales with what Trump and his allies are already spending. But, he argued, Democrats didn\u2019t necessarily need to be on the same level.\n\n\u201cThe reason Trump is now advertising is because they are losing. They are responding to us. Let\u2019s not lose site of that. They are on the defensive. His presidential campaign is now spending money to defend him on impeachment,\u201d said Mack. \u201cHe has to spend money to change the narrative. This is his campaign overreacting and in a bit of a panic.\u201d\n\nOne top Democratic operative echoed these views, noting that the actual revelations emerging from Capital Hill and the news media\u2014which have raised almost universally bad questions for the president\u2014made the difference in ad spending less critical. But others in the party worry that at a time when the president was on his heels, the absence of a full-throated ad push would prove illogical and, frankly, dumb in retrospect.\n\n\u201cThe president and his allies are running a massive campaign to try and muddy the waters on this impeachment fight,\u201d said Petkanas. \u201cCurrently, Democrats are able to play offense but as the weeks drag on it is going to become very hard to maintain the level of message discipline that currently is being employed by the pro-impeachment forces. It is going to be extremely important for a paid communication element of this that begins with an online buy commensurate with the president\u2019s enormous spending.\u201d", "description": "Democrats are baffled that after spending a fortune to advocate for Trump\u2019s impeachment, Tom Steyer is opting for a long-shot presidential bid.", "authors": ["Sam Stein", "Lachlan Markay", "Politics Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569995599/191001-stein-dem-fears-tease_ynjnpw"}
