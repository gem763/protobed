It means that we are preparing to ensure that if no extension is granted \u2013 and we cannot guarantee that an extension will be granted \u2013 that we have done everything possible in order to prepare to leave without a deal.\u201d\n\nMr Gove said that the only way MPs can now guarantee no deal does not happen is to vote for Mr Johnson\u2019s deal.\n\n\u201cParliamentarians have a choice,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a sure thing in front of us and that is the prime minister\u2019s deal, that honours the referendum mandate.\n\n\u201cAnd if people vote for it, then we can leave, and we can leave in an orderly way. But if they don\u2019t vote for that deal, then the risk is that the European Council will say, \u2018That\u2019s it. We\u2019re not interested in delay. You decided not to back the deal that we\u2019ve backed, and we say is a good deal. I\u2019m afraid that\u2019s it.\u2019\u201d\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

We do not want to leave with no deal and it\u2019s up to MPs. It\u2019s only possible if MPs vote to leave with no deal. I believe MPs will vote for the prime minister\u2019s deal and for a good free trade agreement.\u201d\n\n- Supporters of a Final Say referendum on any Brexit deal can sign a letter demanding a public vote at peoples-vote.uk/letter", "description": "Michael Gove has triggered the government\u2019s Operation Yellowhammer contingency plan to put in place measures to cope with a no-deal Brexit.
