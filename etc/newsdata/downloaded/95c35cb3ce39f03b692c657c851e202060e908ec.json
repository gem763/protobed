But not at the moment,\u201d Slok wrote in a Tuesday note to clients. \u201cHow can the S&P 500 be so high and credit spreads so tight when rates markets are so worried about the growth outlook and therefore the corporate earnings outlook?\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps the answer is that equity and credit markets are no longer driven by fundamentals, but instead by [the Federal Reserve] and [European Central Bank\u2019s] promises of lower rates, more dovish forward guidance\u201d and open-ended bond purchases known as quantitative easing (QE), he posited.\n\nThe Federal Reserve decided to cut interest rates for the second time in as many meetings on Sept. 18, and the European Central Bank cut a key benchmark rate further into negative territory and relaunched its quantitative-easing program one week before.\n\n\u201cPut differently, we may have gotten to a point where investors ignore fundamentals because central banks will always step in with more QE and easy money to limit any widening of credit spreads and declines in the stock market,\u201d Slok added. In short, because of unlimited central bank safety nets ... S&P 500 may not decline, and credit spreads may not widen next time we enter a recession.\u201d", "description": "Deutsche Bank\u2019s Torsten Slok worries that markets are ignoring a worsening macro picture", "authors": ["Chris Matthews", "Markets Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HM885_FedPow_ZG_20190709070143.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
