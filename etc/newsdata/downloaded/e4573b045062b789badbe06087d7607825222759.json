You could say it's the closest thing to feeling like Iron Man on two wheels\n\nNudging close to \u00a3100,000 it's not cheap, though it is said to be aimed at rakish, trailblazing and eco-conscious millionaires.\n\nIt's the first model to be produced by Arc - a team of top engineering specialists based in the UK's high-tech automotive heartland in the midlands - who have been likened to Marvel's superhero team by the company's founder.\n\nIt has been revealed the the motorcycling world at the biggest European show of the year - Milan's EICMA event.\n\nLikely to be the biggest talking point in the Italian fashion capital, the bike itself is a work of art.\n\nThe lightweight chassis and carbon components used for the rear and - unusual - front swing-arms mean this machine - even with a bulky electric powerplant onboard - weighs just 220kg and used exotic parts such as Ohlins suspension, Brembo brakes and BST wheels like you'd find on Valentino Rossi's MotoGP bike.\n\nWhile the quote on range is 200 miles, that's for urban use. Arc says it's more like 120 miles if you're riding on the motorway - though even that is around 30 per cent more than comparable electric motorcycles already on the market.\n\nThe bike uses an electric power cell that produces 399 units of voltage. That means it can accelerate from 0-62mph in 3.1 seconds and onto a top speed of 120mph\n\nThe Zenith helmet displays speed, revs and sat-nav directions on the small screen fitted in front of the visor so the rider has all the vital information in eye-sight - similar to the Iron Man helmet from the famous Marvel films\n\nThe Origin jacket vibrates to alert the rider if there are dangers around them or if they're riding too fast\n\nBuyers (who can afford one) will get their own personal electric charge point installed at their desired premises. Plug the vector in and it will charge in 45 minutes - even if you use a public quick charge point in towns or at service stations.\n\nBut while the motorbike is the key component, it's the riding gear that sparks more interest.\n\nThe Zenith helmet has been designed in collaboration with British company Hedon and has the speedo, sat-nav and ancillary graphics projected onto the rider's visor so they can keep their eyes affixed to the road.\n\nA live rear-view camera is encased in the calfskin-trimmed helmet, giving the user the ability to see what's behind them without ever having to turn their head.\n\n\u2039 Slide me \u203a A live rear-view camera is encased in the calfskin-trimmed helmet. This gives the user the ability to see what's behind them without ever having to turn their head\n\nTailored in collaboration with UK bike-protection firm Knox, the jacket also plays music and can tell the rider how close to the limit of the motorcycle's capabilities they are based on factors such as how hard they brake or open the throttle\n\nThe bespoke jacket, called Origin, has Human Machine Interface (HMI) technology applied too.\n\nIt's fitted with technology that alerts the rider of potential hazards as well as providing dynamic performance-based feedback with smartphone-style vibrating notifications.\n\nTailored in collaboration with UK bike-protection firm Knox, the jacket can also play music as well as tell the rider how close to the limit of the motorcycle's capabilities they are based on factors such as how hard they brake or open the throttle.\n\nIn short, you'll feel like Tony Stark riding to your next Avengers mission.\n\nMuch of the bike is made from carbon-fibre or lightweight carbon composites to negate the bulky weight of the electric power plant\n\nThe carbon fibre front and rear swing-arms are stunning and quite unusual. Traditionally, motorcycles have fork front suspension, though swing-arm front units have been used in the past, such as the 1993 Yamaha GTS1000\n\nThe bike features exotic parts such as an Ohlins rear damper, Brembo brakes and BST wheels like you'd find on Valentino Rossi's MotoGP bike\n\nArc's founder Mark Truman, who formerly worked for Jaguar Land Rover, said: 'We felt that there was more one could get out of motorcycling which no one was tapping into.\n\n'This is about using technology to strip back the experience of riding a bike.\n\n''The HUD and haptics of the helmet and jacket work in tandem with the Vector bike to remove distractions and emphasise the joy of riding.'\n\nTruman, 42, a purist biker and technology evangelist, has assembled an engineering dream team and put in motion an ambitious business plan.\n\nWhile the quote on range is 200 miles, that's for urban use. Arc says it's more like 120 miles if you're riding on the motorway - though even that is around 30 per cent more than comparable electric motorcycles already on the market\n\nAvenger on two wheels: Riding this bike will make you feel like Tony Stark talking to the tech in the Iron Man helmet referred to as J.A.R.V.I.S - short for Just A Rather Very Intelligent System\n\nThe ARC Vector comes with its own personal electric charge point that can be installed at the owner's desired premises. Plug the vector in and it will charge in 45 minutes - even if you use a public quick charge point in towns or at service stations\n\nArc's staff have worked in senior positions within Aston Martin, KTM, Ducati, Triumph, Jaguar Land Rover, MotoGP and Formula One. Pioneers in their field, they've designed vehicles for James Bond movies, emergency rescue units and niche electric hypercar companies.\n\n'With Vector, we've set out to build the best performance electric motorcycle,' explains Truman.\n\n'With electric vehicles in general, the powertrain weighs a lot.\n\n'This really can't be avoided if you want capacity, distance and performance.\n\n'So, it was about stripping everything back and using a lot of exotic, lightweight materials, such as carbon-fibre.\n\n'The chassis and battery module had to be one, and because of this approach we've been able to reduce the weight as much as possible to achieve the performance we wanted.\n\n'The design brief was; if the term 'cafe racer' was going to be coined in ten years' time, what would that look like?'", "description": "The jacket alerts the rider to dangers around them and the helmet projects vital information, such as their speed, revs and a rear view camera on the visor to make you feel like Iron Man on a bike.", "authors": ["Rob Hull For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
