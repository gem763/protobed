And four in ten would be more likely to stick with Labour in the December 12 General Election if Mr Corbyn stood down.\n\nEven Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson was seen as stronger, more statesmanlike and smarter than Mr Corbyn in the Survation poll of 1,010 voters.\n\nThe Labour leader yesterday used his last Commons clash with the Prime Minister before the election to accuse him of putting the NHS \u2018up for grabs\u2019 to secure a trade deal with the United States.\n\nMr Johnson dismissed the claims and said a Labour government would be an \u2018economic catastrophe\u2019.\n\nThe graphic above shows how UK voters back Prime Minister Boris Johnson over Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn\n\nBoris Johnson (pictured above) is more trusted to care for the NHS than Jeremy Corbyn, according to a poll for the Daily Mail today\n\nAsked which leader had the best health policies, 36 per cent of voters said Mr Johnson while 34 per cent opted for Mr Corbyn (above)\n\nEven Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson (pictured above) was seen as stronger, more statesmanlike and smarter than Mr Corbyn in the Survation poll of 1,010 voters\n\nThe election battle gets under way properly today, with Mr Johnson visiting a hospital in East Anglia in his drive to convince the public the NHS is safe in his hands. He will use this first campaign visit to accuse Mr Corbyn of thwarting his \u2018do or die\u2019 pledge to take Britain out of the EU on time.\n\nMr Johnson, who said he would rather be \u2018dead in a ditch\u2019 than delay Brexit beyond tonight, will acknowledge the deadline has been missed \u2013 but lay the blame on Labour.\n\nIn other electoral developments yesterday:\n\nNicky Morgan and Amber Rudd both announced they were quitting as MPs, leading a growing exodus from Parliament of Tory Remainers;\n\nMr Johnson is poised to make a substantial offer of free childcare in the Tory election manifesto;\n\nThe Prime Minister was also poised to announce a moratorium on fracking;\n\nMr Corbyn prepared to launch his campaign with a pledge to tackle the \u2018corrupt system\u2019 of tax dodgers and bad bosses;\n\nLabour was accused of risking the break-up of Britain by saying it wouldn\u2019t block a second Scottish independence referendum;\n\nThe Lib Dems were in talks with the Greens and Plaid Cymru over a Remain pact;\n\nNigel Farage suggested his Brexit Party will target Labour Leave seats;\n\nDominic Grieve and Antoinette Sandbach said they would stand as independents in their current seats \u2013 against Tory candidates;\n\nMr Corbyn challenged Mr Johnson to a TV debate during the campaign.\n\nToday\u2019s poll suggests that Mr Johnson\u2019s decision to make the NHS a top priority since entering No 10 is paying off. As well as being ahead on the NHS, the Prime Minister is 18 points ahead on jobs, a key issue for working-class voters.\n\nMr Johnson is streets ahead on the economy, defence, trade and foreign relations. The only issue where Mr Corbyn is in the lead is welfare.\n\nThe Tories have 34 per cent support overall, eight points ahead of Labour on 26, with the Lib Dems on 19 and the Brexit Party on 12.\n\nThat would be enough to give the Prime Minister a slim Commons majority.\n\nAccording to those surveyed, Mr Johnson\u2019s poll advantage could increase over the six-week contest. A total of 44 per cent say he is the best campaigner, with Mr Corbyn on 21 and Miss Swinson on ten. Asked who would be the best PM, Mr Johnson scores 42 and Mr Corbyn 19, only four ahead of Swinson on 15.\n\nNicky Morgan (left) and Amber Rudd (right) both announced that they were quitting as MPs Parliament, leading a growing exodus from Parliament of Tory Remainers\n\nAnd in an encouraging sign for Mr Johnson\u2019s attempt to squeeze the Brexit vote, support for Mr Farage\u2019s party continues to fall. It is now barely half the level it was before Mr Johnson entered No 10. In the same period, Tory support has steadily risen, suggesting Conservatives who switched to the Brexit Party when Theresa May was leader are returning to the fold.\n\nThe figures provide further evidence that Mr Corbyn\u2019s fence-sitting on Brexit could see Labour support haemorrhage to the fervently anti-Brexit Lib Dems.\n\nMr Johnson\u2019s Brexit stance is favoured by 41 per cent; Remainer Miss Swinson is on 23 with Mr Corbyn on a meagre 15.\n\nA total of 42 per cent of Labour supporters say they would be more likely to vote for the party if Mr Corbyn stepped down; 18 per cent say they would be less likely to vote Labour.\n\nNigel Farage (pictured above) suggested that the Brexit Party will target Labour Leave seats - which could still cost the Tories an election win\n\nDominic Grieve (left) and Antoinette Sandbach (right) said they would stand as independents in their current seats - against Tory candidates\n\nNor were voters convinced by Mr Corbyn\u2019s excuses for initially holding out against a December election.\n\nNearly half say he did so because he was scared of losing; 30 per cent say it was to avoid No Deal; just 9 per cent believed him when he said it would be too cold to vote.\n\nMore than half of voters (51 per cent) say Mr Johnson is right to have called a poll.\n\nAstonishingly, 15 per cent of Labour voters will feel \u2018fear\u2019 if Mr Corbyn triumphs on December 12; 58 per cent will be \u2018joyful.\u2019 Similarly, one in ten Labour voters will feel \u2018joy\u2019 if Mr Johnson is victorious; 73 per cent will be \u2018fearful\u2019.\n\nThe Conservative lead extends across the parties\u2019 front benches. Chancellor Sajid Javid, Home Secretary Priti Patel and Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab are all more popular than Labour counterparts John McDonnell, Diane Abbott and Emily Thornberry.\n\nA total of 44 per cent blame Parliament for forcing the Prime Minister to break his \u2018die in a ditch\u2019 pledge to leave the EU by today; 32 per cent point the finger at Mr Johnson himself; 11 per cent blame Brussels.\n\nSurvation interviewed 1,010 adults online on Tuesday and yesterday after all four main parties backed a December election.", "description": "36 per cent of voters in the UK said Boris Johnson had the best health policies, while 34 per cent opted for Jeremy Corbyn.", "authors": ["Simon Walters", "Jason Groves For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/22/20398702-0-image-a-63_1572472937549.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
