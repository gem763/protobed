This comes as somewhat of a surprise because the North flatly refused to let South Korean reporters come to the country for an inter-Korean match on Tuesday in Pyongyang. The second-round Asian qualifier for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar took place in bizarre circumstances, lacking a live broadcast, fans or media presence.\n\nSome speculate the North authorized reporters to cover the weightlifting competition because the country wants to promote its hosting of a major international event.\n\nThe North is very strong in weightlifting, winning 24 medals -- seven gold, 12 silver and five bronze -- and setting five world records at the International Weightlifting Federation World Championships in Thailand last month.\n\nOn the other hand, there looks to be a big gap between the two countries in football. In men's football, South Korea is ranked 37th in the FIFA world rankings and North Korea 113th.\n\nThe North may have banned media at the World Cup qualifier because it feared that South Korean footballers would deliver a strong performance, embarrassing it on its home turf.\n\nThe two Koreas drew the match 0-0.\n\n", "description": "N.Korea Invites S.Korea to Int'l Weightlifting Championships in Pyongyang", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://image.chosun.com/facebook/newson.gif", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
