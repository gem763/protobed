Biden Jr., who is a leading candidate for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nHere are some of the basic facts behind the controversy.\n\nWhat did Mr. Trump do?\n\nIn a July 25 phone call, Mr. Trump is said to have pressed the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, to investigate Mr. Biden\u2019s younger son, Hunter, who sat on the board of a Ukrainian energy company. Mr. Trump has seized on an unsubstantiated theory that Mr. Biden was trying to protect the company from prosecution when he called for the firing of Ukraine\u2019s top prosecutor in 2016. Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyers, has pushed the Ukrainian government to investigate the matter.\n\nWhy is this coming up now?\n\nBecause of an intelligence community whistle-blower who filed a complaint last month about the president\u2019s actions. An inspector general deemed the complaint \u201ccredible\u201d and \u201curgent\u201d and forwarded it to the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, who has refused to share it with Congress. The issue was brought into the open when the House Intelligence Committee chairman, Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California, sent an angry letter to Mr. Maguire on Sept. 10 demanding the complaint be shared with his panel.\n\nWhat did the whistle-blower claim?\n\nThe full extent of the whistle-blower\u2019s complaint, as well as the whistle-blower\u2019s identity, is not publicly known. Reporting by The New York Times and others has established that the complaint involves Mr. Trump\u2019s interactions with Ukraine and a phone call with a foreign leader \u2014 possibly, but not necessarily, Mr. Zelensky. It is not clear if it includes other matters.", "description": "President Trump is under intense scrutiny over a classified whistle-blower complaint about some of his behavior.", "authors": ["Michael Crowley", "Kenneth P.
