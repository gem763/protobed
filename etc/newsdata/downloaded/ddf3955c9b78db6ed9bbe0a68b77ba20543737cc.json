He is likely to be back in action in October.\u201d\n\nEarlier on Friday, Arsenal manager Unai Emery confirmed defenders Kieran Tierney and Hector Bellerin are both close to being available for first team duties after injury.\n\nBellerin has been on the sidelines for almost nine months following knee ligament damage, while Tierney is waiting to make his Arsenal debut having arrived from Celtic with a groin problem in addition to undergoing a hernia operation.\n\n\u201cThey are now close to us but they need to continue to work. They need to take their time to feel comfortable so they can play,\u201d Emery told a news conference ahead of Arsenal\u2019s Premier League match at Watford on Sunday.\n\n\u201cIt depends how they can progress in the next few weeks. Maybe we will decide at the beginning to play them first with the Under-23s to be ready with us.\n\n\u201cMaybe they can take confidence and rhythm and be ready to play for us 100%.\u201d\n\nEmery confirmed forward Nicolas Pepe will be involved this weekend despite withdrawing from the Ivory Coast squad due to fitness issues, while defender Rob Holding is nearing full-fitness and could be involved in cup competitions.\n\n\u201cRob Holding is the same situation but he earned time with matches with the U23s. We need to decide if he will play,\u201d Emery added.\n\n\u201cNext week we start with the Europa League and then the Carabao Cup, so with more U23 minutes, he can be ready to give us a performance.\u201d", "description": "Arsenal forward Alexandre Lacazette will be out of action until next month because of an ankle injury, the north London club said on Friday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429478544&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C1MR", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
