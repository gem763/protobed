Andrew Cuomo on Friday sought to make clear that he supports the presidential impeachment investigation, a clarification that came a day after he said the \u201cquote unquote inquiry\u201d was opened because of pressure from \u201cleftist\u201d Democrats.\n\nIn a statement, the governor\u2019s office said Cuomo\u2019s position had been \u201cmisrepresented\u201d and that, despite his harsh words at an event Thursday night with former New Jersey Republican Gov. Chris Christie, the Democrat believes Speaker Nancy Pelosi \u201cmust proceed with an impeachment investigation as a matter of constitutional duty.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cIt is no longer an option or a political decision: the House must investigate,\u201d spokesperson Dani Lever said in a statement to POLITICO. \u201cThe Governor has further said, which is also indisputable, that early calls for impeachment from the far left flank members of the caucus were more aggressive, and Nancy Pelosi was taking a deliberative path which the Governor agreed with.\n\n\u201cHowever, that all changed once the Ukraine revelations came to light,\u201d she said. \u201cNow, there\u2019s no question that the investigation must follow all leads.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday evening, during a one-on-one conversation with Christie that took place at Seton Hall Law School in Newark, N.J., Cuomo did not once say he supported the investigation, instead predicting it would create gridlock in Washington and that it would not end with President Donald Trump being removed from office.\n\nIn what appeared at the time to be a reversal of his comments from Wednesday, when he said \u201cyou\u2019re darn right there should be an inquiry,\u201d Cuomo told Christie the nation was headed \u201cdown a very long and unproductive road.\u201d\n\nCuomo did not comment during the event about the substance of the whistleblower complaint or the partial transcript of Trump\u2019s call with the Ukrainian president, merely saying \u201cthe Ukraine issue raises a lot of questions\u201d and that an investigatory committee could spend months, \u201cone witness after another, one witness after another, on all sort of different tracks.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere does it go, ultimately? Nowhere, because even if they vote for impeachment, it goes to the Senate,\u201d he told Christie, who hosted the event as the first in a series about civility and bipartisanship in politics.\n\nIn her statement Friday, Lever said Cuomo had previously made his position clear and has not changed his mind about the need for an inquiry.\n\n\u201cThe Governor strongly believes that the paths to investigate must include the allegations of the President's solicitation of foreign assistance, the President's abuse of power in effectively extorting the Ukrainian president with federal funds, the reported cover up by the Attorney General of a complaint that implicated Barr himself, and the tampering with government documents in the attempt to secret the transcripts,\u201d she said.", "description": "\u201cIt is no longer an option or a political decision: the House must investigate,\u201d spokesperson Dani Lever said in a statement to POLITICO.", "authors": ["Ryan Hutchins"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/20/ab/4d54e7934e878a76de71e086e0bd/0801cuomo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
