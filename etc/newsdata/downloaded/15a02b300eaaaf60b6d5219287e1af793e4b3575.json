But it should also shame all those in the fund management industry who hailed him as the genius who proved single-handedly that active fund managers could beat the passive index trackers.\n\nThey should have known that if something seems to be too good to be true, it's because it is.\n\nThe Woodford catastrophe is a devastating blow to the reputation of the so-called 'star' stockpicking investment business, and it's no surprise the industry now fears the public may stop investing their savings entirely. Who could blame them?\n\nInvestors are right to be sceptical about expensive so-called experts such as Woodford, but are also worried by other recent scams at mini-bond issuer, London Capital & Finance, and Park First.\n\nWoodford's fall from his high horse is a nightmare for regulators at the Financial Conduct Authority.\n\nAlthough it has toughened up the rules on open-ended funds, the watchdog must now study how investors can best be advised on how to approach hot share tips marketed by the big funds.\n\nThe deeper question raised by Woodford is: what should investors do with savings in an era of low interest rates and renewed economic uncertainty?\n\nFor those who do not want to take big risks, sticking with passive trackers is probably still the safest route. And it would be cheaper too.\n\nAs we report today, Vanguard, the world's biggest passive fund manager, is triggering a price war and taking advantage of the crisis by slashing fees on 36 of its funds open to UK investors. About time too.\n\nFund managers need to take a long hard look at themselves. They should ask how they can improve their industry, not only their image but how to be more transparent about charges, and how to provide more secure outcomes for investors.\n\nThe model to aspire to is that of the airline sector. After horrendous accidents in the 1970s, industry leaders radically overhauled their attitude towards safety.\n\nZero tolerance was the Holy Grail. This 'black box' approach forced the industry to face up to its mistakes and learn from them. Fund managers should do the same.\n\nTasty Takeaway\n\nOn my desk is a beautiful box of hand-iced biscuits which arrived today as a thank-you from a friend. They are from London-based Le Biscuiteers, one of many online delivery companies sprouting up all over the world.\n\nOnline food delivery is worth \u00a310billion worldwide and forecast to grow to \u00a3282billion over the next decade.\n\nIt's why South Africa's Naspers group, through Prosus, wants to gobble up Just Eat and break up its merger with Dutch giant Takeaway.\n\nProsus is offering a tasty \u00a34.9billion for Just Eat \u2013 a healthy premium on the shares.\n\nFood delivery may be big business but it's a fiercely competitive market \u2013 rivals include Uber Eats and Deliveroo. New technology means barriers to entry are relatively low.\n\nJust Eat's directors should invite Prosus in for a takeaway, and get the price up. Takeaway might come back with a better dish than its all-share offer. Then shareholders should dine out on the proceeds.\n\nComplicit auditors\n\nThe year after Thomas Cook merged with Mytravel the former boss, Manny Fontenla-Novoa, was paid a \u00a35million bonus called a 'secured synergies bonus plan'.\n\nIt was signed off in the 2008 annual report after a review by EY \u2013 Thomas Cook's auditors.\n\nAt the time, Thomas Cook was laden with debt because of the merger, and went on to write down a \u00a31.1billion loss on the deal.\n\nYet the bonus was still paid, and so was another \u00a340million of bonuses over the next ten years.\n\nEY, and fellow auditor, PwC, were correctly picked out for being complicit in Thomas Cook's downfall by MPs yesterday.\n\nThe accountancy industry is another one that needs black-box thinking.", "description": "We've had Neil Woodford as the star stock-picker, the computer-beating investor guru and Britain's answer to Warren Buffett, such was his capacity for making money.", "authors": ["Maggie Pagano For The Daily Mail", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
