It's even worse at four-year public schools, where it has jumped 35 percent during that period. Yet for many prospective students, free college is becoming a reality, as more states adopt scholarship programs to increase enrollment and accessibility.\n\nThese so-called promise programs typically offer college students two years of free tuition at participating state community colleges or other associate-degree programs and vocational schools. Most are what's known as \"last dollar\" scholarships, meaning the program pays for whatever tuition is left after financial aid and grants.\n\nEleven states \u2014 Oregon, Nevada, Arkansas, New Jersey, Maryland, Tennessee, New York, Rhode Island, Delaware, Kentucky, and Indiana \u2014 already have these programs in place and nine more are working on legislation to do so.", "description": "The growing number of state-based free tuition programs can be a lifeline for students who could not otherwise afford college.", "authors": ["Jessica Dickler"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/104489895-1552398861990harvardgrad.jpg?v=1552398870", "published_at": "2019-03-12"}
