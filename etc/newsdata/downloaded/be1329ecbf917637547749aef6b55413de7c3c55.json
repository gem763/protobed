For more information, see our ethics policy .\n\nWe\u2019ve rolled out over 50 exclusive deals for readers this week as part of our deals event. This included some laptops that we liked, such as the LG Gram 17, Dell XPS 13, and Razer Blade Stealth, as well as deals that you can\u2019t find elsewhere on unlocked phones, like the Sony Xperia 1 and Samsung Galaxy A50.\n\nWe\u2019re wrapping things up, and we\u2019ll soon be back on the hunt for other good deals. But in case you missed out on our many reader-exclusive deals (originally published Monday and Tuesday), we\u2019re putting our favorite picks back in the spotlight once more.\n\nYou can also enter to win a giveaway from our Verge Deals Twitter account. Head over to this page, then follow the instructions to enter the contest, and you might win a mystery bag full of tech right from our closet.\n\nSony\u2019s excellent 1000X M3 over-ear wireless headphones are $298 at BuyDig with the offer code THEVERGE. These sit at the top of our list of the best wireless headphones, and they stand out from the rest with their comfortable fit, amazing sound quality, USB-C charging, and great battery life.\n\nThe headphones are available in black or silver, and BuyDig is offering readers of The Verge a $25 Hulu gift card with purchase.\n\nThe Dell XPS 13 (with FHD display, 8th Gen Intel Core i7 processor, 16GB RAM, 256GB M.2 NVMe PCIe SSD, supports Thunderbolt 3) is $1,279 at B&H Photo.\n\nThis model usually lists for $1,691.25, and it\u2019s the first XPS 13 to get rid of the nostril cam, putting it up near the top of the display. Dieter Bohn says that this edition of the Dell XPS 13 is \u201cgreat all around\u201d in his review, and it might be a great fit for you if you want a small, well-rounded machine without breaking the bank.\n\nThe HooToo USB-C hub pictured above (three USB 3.0 ports, SD card reader, HDMI, 55W pass-through) is $25.99 at Amazon with the offer code TV6PVAH8 used at checkout.\n\nMy colleague Chaim Gartenberg has tried a lot of different USB-hubs, and HooToo\u2019s is one of the better ones that you can buy. It\u2019s hard to find a hub that can do it all (this one lacks Ethernet), but it offers 55W pass-through, three USB 3.0 ports, an SD card slot, and HDMI.\n\nThe RavPower 45W USB-C GaN wall charger is $29.99 (usually $49.99) at Amazon with the offer code TVK3YGQI.\n\nThis wall charger is especially great if you have outlets without much clearance. It\u2019s slim, letting you plug in your USB-C device (phone, laptop, Nintendo Switch, etc.) on its bottom. It\u2019s fast, too, providing enough power to fast-charge any phone, even the new Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Plus or the MacBook Air.\n\nXbox One S (the disc-less All Digital Edition console) is $229 (usually $368.95) at BuyDig, and it comes with one month of Xbox Live Gold service and six games (Madden NFL 20, Gears of War 4, PUBG, Minecraft, Forza Horizon 3, and Sea of Thieves). You can get this deal by using offer code THEVERGE at checkout.\n\nSamsung Galaxy A50 unlocked smartphone (white, compatible with GSM carriers only, dual-SIM) is $249.99 (usually $279.99) at B&H Photo.\n\nMost of Samsung\u2019s phones cost well over $500, but the Galaxy A50 might have more than enough power and features for your needs. It certainly looks and feels like a high-end phone, but at $250, it\u2019s a great deal if you\u2019re on a GSM carrier like AT&T or T-Mobile. This international version of the Galaxy A50 is covered by a one-year B&H Photo warranty, protecting it against manufacturer defects, as a Samsung warranty would.\n\nIt\u2019s also available in black or blue.\n\nRavPower\u2019s Fast Charge Qi wireless pad is $22.49 (includes power adapter) at Amazon after you clip the $3 coupon on the product page, then enter the offer code TVPC03423. RavPower\u2019s Fast Charge Qi wireless stand is $26 (usually $47.99, includes power adapter) at Amazon with the offer code TVPC06934.\n\nThese wireless chargers come in a two-way tie in Chaim Gartenberg\u2019s roundup of the best options. That\u2019s because they\u2019re equally good in all the ways that matter (charging speeds that scale up to 10W, affordability, simplistic designs, and they both include a 24W wall charger). But, one may appeal to you over the other. The pad is great if you don\u2019t mind setting your phone down to charge. However, the stand will be more useful if you want to have your phone upright while charging. This is especially handy for iPhones that require Face ID to unlock since this stand orients the phone much like how you would hold it in your hand.\n\nMophie is offering a 20 percent discount for readers of The Verge on its mobile accessories, including portable batteries and charging cases. You can use the code on anything, including Mophie\u2019s new Dual Wireless Charging Pad, pictured above. Use the offer code VERGE20 at checkout to save.", "description": "Our reader-exclusive deals event is wrapping up, but we\u2019re putting some of our favorites back in the spotlight.
