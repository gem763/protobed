When you have some difficulties, such as your key market going down in Sharm el Sheikh , it leaves you in a very weak position.\u201d\n\nAlmost one million British holidaymakers were either abroad or holding future bookings with Thomas Cook.\n\nThe transport secretary, Grant Shapps, told Parliament: \u201cAll parties considered options to avoid how this company could be not put into administration.\n\n\u201cUltimately, however, it was Thomas Cook and its directors took the decision themselves to place this company into insolvency.\u201d\n\nThe Department for Transport (DfT) launched an airlift to bring 140,000 Thomas Cook customers home, known as Operation Matterhorn.\n\nOf the \u00a3100m cost, \u00a360m will come from the Atol fund.\n\nRefunds of a further 800,000 forward bookings are now being processed by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). Handling holiday money could cost a further \u00a3400m \u2013 some covered by the Atol fund, the remainder by insurance taken out by the CAA.\n\nThere are concerns that the present Atol fee of \u00a32.50 per passenger could increase, But Mr Tanzer said: \u201cWe\u2019ll be very disappointed if they increase the Atol levy.\n\n\u201cThe pain of the Thomas Cook failure is being felt very widely in our industry, by tour operators, travel agents, hotels and other suppliers.\u201d\n\nAround 9,000 Thomas Cook staff lost their jobs in the collapse: at the headquarters in Peterborough, the airline\u2019s base in Manchester and at more than 500 high street travel agencies.\n\nBut Abta\u2019s chairman, Alistair Rowland, said: \u201cThere are at least three bids for most of the shops.\u201d Many staff are likely to be employed by the successful bidders.\n\nOther travel firms, including his own organisation, Mid-Counties Co-op, are competing to take over Thomas Cook travel agencies.\n\nMr Tanzer also spoke of the \u201cuncertainty and disruption\u201d in the travel industry that would follow a no-deal Brexit.\n\nThe Abta chief executive said: \u201cIt is also very damaging to consumer confidence.\n\n\u201cIn the run up to the March deadline, we saw an industry slowdown, and the same pattern is repeating itself as we approach another cliff edge.\u201d\n\nAnother speaker at the Tokyo convention, the writer Marcel Theroux compared Brexit to Japan\u2019s \u201cclosed country\u201d policy that lasted from the 17th to 19th century.\n\nHe poured scorn on the process of a country \u201cwillingly cutting itself off from the world and going into commercial isolation\u201d.\n\nLast week Boris Johnson told Parliament: \u201cLet us seize this moment to honour our over-riding promise to the British people, respect Brexit and get Brexit done.\u201d", "description": "The collapse of Thomas Cook was \u201cmore a failure of corporate finance than a failure of travel\u201d, according to the chief executive of Abta.\u00a0 Speaking at the travel association\u2019s annual convention in Tokyo, Mark Tanzer said: \u201cThomas Cook paid \u00a31.2bn in finance charges over the past six years, plus goodness knows how much in advisory fees to the City. \u201cThose were profits from its", "authors": ["Simon Calder"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/08/06/thomascookrepat.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
