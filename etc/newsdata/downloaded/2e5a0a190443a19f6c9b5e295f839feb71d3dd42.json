It\u2019s expected that Typhoon Mitag, the 17th of the season in Japan, will see high winds and heavy rain batter the region as the week progresses.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nAccording to the Japan Meteorological Agency, the Typhoon is moving towards a projected path that will see it miss the coastline, although World Rugby are still preparing for the worst should the tropical cyclone hit.\n\nIf the game is cancelled, World Rugby stipulates that France vs USA would be scored a 0-0 draw, meaning that the French would miss out on a potential five-point haul if they were to secure a bonus-point win, and instead take just two points from the match.\n\nThat would give Les Bleus a serious disadvantage to England, who have already take a maximum 10 points from their games against Tonga and the USA, and who face Argentina next Saturday before taking on France in \u2018Le Crunch\u2019.\n\nIt would give England a four-point advantage over both the French and Pumas going into the weekend\u2019s fixtures, with England facing Argentina and France playing Tonga, and if they both emerged triumphant, the likelihood is that Jacques Brunel\u2019s side would need a bonus-point victory over England in the final round of fixture to top the pool.\n\nA World Rugby statement said: \u201cWorld Rugby and Japan Rugby 2019 are monitoring Typhoon Mitag, which is developing off the south west coast of Japan.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cBased on the latest information from our weather information provider and the Japan Meteorological Agency, the Typhoon could bring high winds and heavy rain to the southern island of Kyushu on 2 October, possibly impacting the France versus USA match at Fukuoka.\n\n\u201cThe latest information indicates that the Typhoon is moving further away from Japan\u2019s coastline than originally predicted, and the impact risk is reducing. However, in the best interests of the teams and the integrity of the tournament, we have informed France and the USA of the contingency plans in the event that adverse weather means that it is not possible to play the match in Fukuoka on the scheduled date.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to closely monitor this developing situation in partnership with our weather information provider, local authorities, transport providers and the teams, and will provide a further update tomorrow.
