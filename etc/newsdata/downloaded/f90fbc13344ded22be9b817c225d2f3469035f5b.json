Firstly, he wanted to look into whether Ukrainian officials took steps during the 2016 presidential election to damage Mr Trump\u2019s campaign, the newspaper reported.\n\nHe also wanted it to press ahead with enquiries into Mr Biden\u2019s 2016 actions as vice president, when he threatened the allegedly corrupt administration in Kiev with the withholding of $1bn in United States loan guarantees, and to investigate if Ukraine\u2019s leaders did not dismiss the country\u2019s top prosecutor, who had been accused of turning a blind eye to corruption in his own office.\n\nMr Giuliani told the newspaper he had \u201cstrongly urged\u201d the Ukrainian official, Andriy Yermak, a close ally of Mr Zelensky, to \u201cjust investigate the darn things\u201d. He said he could not determine whether his actions would interfere in relations between the countries.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t really evaluate that \u2013 whether my involvement in it makes it worse or better,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t see how advocating for an investigation of two alleged crimes puts too much pressure on them, other than to do the right thing.\u201d\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Polls suggest there is only modest support among the public for impeachment.\n\nEarlier this year, special counsel Robert Mueller reported that his two-year investigation into Russia\u2019s alleged interference in the 2016 election, and possible collusion with the Trump campaign, found no evidence of collusion. He said investigators were unable to clear the president of claims of obstruction of justice, and attorney general William Barr decided there would be no indictment of Mr Trump.\n\nAdditional reporting by Reuters", "description": "Donald Trump\u2019s alleged efforts to pressure the\u00a0government of Ukraine to assist his 2020 re-election campaign\u00a0are\u00a0being investigated by Democrats on Capitol Hill.", "authors": ["Andrew Buncombe"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/09/15/trump.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
