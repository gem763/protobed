Coming in three distinct waves, the ABC retracement appears to have terminated at 36,850, having found support at the 200-week MA in December and bullish momentum is now back in control.\n\nTwo higher lows have formed as part of an inverted head-and-shoulders pattern which, if successful, projects an initial target just above the 2018 highs. This week\u2019s breakout has confirmed the bullish reversal pattern, although if we have indeed seen the end of the 15-month ABC correction, it should be breaking to record highs over the coming months. And assuming the head is the end of wave 2 retracement, this week\u2019s breakout assumes we\u2019re now in a iii or 3 wave.\n\nSamsung one-day chart\n\nSwitching to the daily chart shows just how strong bullish momentum is. A small bullish hammer shows a minor pullback to 46,400 ahead of a daily close above 47,750 which confirmed the head and shoulders reversal. However, a breakaway gap on above-average volume saw prices explode higher to close above 49,000 yesterday and today\u2019s price action has also gapped higher. Granted, we could find interim resistance around 50k but, given the strength of the breakout, we don\u2019t envisage yesterday\u2019s gap to be filled.", "description": "Shares Analysis by Matt Simpson covering: Samsung Electronics Co Ltd.
