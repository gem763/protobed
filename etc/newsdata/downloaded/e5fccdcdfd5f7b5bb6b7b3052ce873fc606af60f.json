She later became his trainer, which is when he began assaulting her, according to the suit.\n\nMr. Brown denies \u201ceach and every allegation\u201d in the lawsuit, according to a statement from his lawyer, Darren Heitner. The statement said Mr. Brown and Ms. Taylor had sex but that \u201cany sexual interaction\u201d between them was consensual, including the night in which she accuses him of raping her. Mr. Brown\u2019s lawyer described the lawsuit against his client as a \u201cmoney grab.\u201d The Patriots, who just days ago agreed to a deal with the star receiver, didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. The suit alleges various incidents of misconduct by Mr. Brown over two years. In one alleged incident, in June 2017, Mr. Brown exposed himself and kissed Taylor without her consent, the suit alleges. After the alleged incidents, Ms. Taylor stopped working for Mr. Brown, according to the suit. But months later, she says, Mr. Brown persuaded her to resume working with him, after which he raped her, the suit alleges. In May 2018, it says, Mr. Brown physically overpowered her and disregarded her pleas for him to stop and forcibly penetrated her. \u201cAs a rape victim of Antonio Brown, deciding to speak out has been an incredibly difficult decision,\u201d Ms. Taylor said in a statement through her lawyers. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear whether any of her accusations against Mr. Brown were reported to police. Ms. Taylor said she would cooperate with the National Football League. The accusation, earlier reported by the New York Times, comes after a turbulent off-season for Brown, one of football\u2019s most talented players. When Mr. Brown signed with the Patriots, the deal marked his third team in less than a year. He asked to leave Pittsburgh at the end of last season, and the Steelers traded him to the Oakland Raiders. After a series of disagreements with the Raiders, he demanded his release, which was granted before he ever played a game for the team. That release potentially cost Mr. Brown a great deal of money, but it didn\u2019t take him long to agree to terms with the Patriots on a new deal with the reigning Super Bowl champions. He has yet to suit up for the Patriots, and his first opportunity would have been next weekend, though it is unclear if he will now be permitted to do so.
