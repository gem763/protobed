However Mercedes wastes little time in consoling her.\n\nMeanwhile, with James still the prime suspect in his boyfriend\u2019s murder, he sets out to discover the truth, but little does he know the information he\u2019s about to become party to later in the day.\n\n(Picture: Lime Pictures)\n\nElsewhere, having learned the truth, Grace makes her way to The Dog \u2014 where the villagers have congregated after Harry\u2019s funeral \u2014 and takes to the stage. She proceeds to play Mercedes\u2019 confession aloud for all those in attendance to hear.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMercedes \u2014 and the entire village, for that matter \u2014 is left devastated by the revelation. Several villagers turn on Mercedes \u2014 including James, who begins to think that she might\u2019ve had a hand in Harry\u2019s death.\n\n(Picture: Lime Pictures)\n\nLater in the week, an emotional Mercedes heads to The Loft after an argument ensues.\n\nWhile there, she heads onto the dance floor, and dances the night away. However, disaster strikes as someone picks up the nearby gun and shoots her \u2014leaving her to die.\n\nWith James and Grace having demonstrated how much they dislike Mercedes over her actions, could either one of them perhaps be the culprits?\n\nThey\u2019re certainly among the suspects, but are either of them capable of carrying out such a heinous act?\n\nWhat\u2019s more, will Mercedes live to find out who\u2019s responsible?\n\nOne to watch: Friday 1st November at 7pm on E4.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Mercedes makes quite a few enemies in one day \u2014 two of which are Grace and James.", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/HO-EP-5291-WHO-SHOT-MERCEDES-03-d7bd_1572019648.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
