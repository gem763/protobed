But while Defense Secretary Mark Esper tweeted that the U.S. is working with \"our partners to address this unprecedented attack,\u201d President Donald Trump has alienated key allies by unilaterally pulling out of the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran and re-imposing sanctions. It has already been unable to enlist allies to protect shipping in the region from Iranian attacks.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cIn a normal administration, we should be able to get 40 or 50 countries on board for something like this but we can\u2019t because nobody trusts the Trump administration and everybody thinks they\u2019re going to take them into war,\" said Ilan Goldenberg, a former Obama administration national security official who worked on Iran policy at the Pentagon, referring to the maritime security initiative \u2014 which he called \"pathetic.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no offensive coalition against Iran, not there or anywhere else in the world right now,\u201d added Michael Knights of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, who studies Iranian military activity in the Middle East.\n\nEven leading Republicans in Congress called on Trump to take action only with the help of allies. \"The best way to counter Iran is by working by, with and through regional partners \u2014 including making sure they have what they need to defend themselves and our shared interests,\" Sen. Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma said in a statement late Monday.\n\nThe Senate Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell, said earlier that \u201cI hope our international partners will join us in imposing consequences on Iran for this reckless destabilizing attack.\u201d\n\nSuccessive U.S. administrations have used coalitions to bolster the legitimacy of military actions and to relieve some of the pressure on heavily used U.S. military forces \u2014 from the 1991 Gulf War and the Clinton administration\u2019s actions in the Balkans to the much-maligned \u201ccoalition of the willing\u201d that the George W. Bush administration recruited for the 2003 invasion of Iraq.\n\nAnd since taking office, Trump has often expressed frustration with allies over burden-sharing, pushing European, Asian, and Middle Eastern partners to bear greater financial and practical costs in areas where the U.S. underwrites their security.\n\nThat was the Pentagon\u2019s rationale when it announced the so-called International Maritime Security Construct in July following the Iranian seizure of a British tanker and the June shoot down of a U.S. surveillance drone. By recruiting international partners for a flotilla of naval vessels and surveillance aircraft, the Pentagon hoped to limit the amount of U.S. military might it would have to commit to providing security in waterways where Iranian naval forces have harassed commercial shipping.\n\nThat\u2019s seen as a key concern at a time when the military is trying to shift troops, aircraft, warships and other equipment away from the Middle East to better prepare for potential conflicts with Russia or China.\n\nYet many allied nations \u2014 including bedrock military partners like France and Germany \u2014 steered clear out of concern that the Trump administration might use the mission to drag them into a confrontation with Iran.\n\nFrance and Germany have both condemned the weekend attacks on the Saudi oil industry. But France appears committed to diplomacy with Iran. French President Emmanuel Macron last month called for Trump and President of Iran Hassan Rouhani to meet to try to arrange a summit.\n\nAnd a German government official last month warned of being \u201csucked into\u201d a larger military mission if it joined the maritime security mission.\n\nGlobal Translations A new podcast series from POLITICO.

It draws on unspecified forces from the Bahraini military \u2014 whose navy mostly consists of small patrol craft \u2014 as well as a British contingent of two frigates, a destroyer and five mine hunting vessels, according to a British official who spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nAustralia, meanwhile, has pledged to deploy a surveillance plane later this year and a warship next year, and Australian Defense Minister Linda Reynolds stressed when she announced that commitment that \u201cAustralia\u2019s core interest in this mission is de-escalation.\u201d\n\nIn leading the effort, the U.S. has committed destroyers and \u201cintelligence gathering assets,\u201d according to a statement from U.S. Central Command. Telling reporters last month that the mission was \u201cup and running,\u201d Esper described its mission as \u201cfirst, to provide freedom of navigation for the commercial shipping that is so vital to global economic trade, and second, to deter provocations and avoid conflict in the region.\"\n\nThe skeletal maritime force is far too small to be used in any type of military response to the Saudi Aramco attacks \u2014 a mission that would go beyond its intended purpose.\n\n\u201cThe idea that this coalition could be used to respond significantly or seriously to Iran is fanciful,\u201d said Goldenberg, who is now with the Center for a New American Security.\n\nFor quick aerial or sea-launched retaliatory strikes against Iranian missile and drone facilities, a coalition could be more of an impediment than as asset, according to Eric Edelman, a former George W. Bush Pentagon official. \"If the president decides on a military response, I think you want it to be fairly prompt and you don\u2019t want to spend a lot of time coordinating with others beyond Saudi Arabia,\" Edelman said.\n\nBut building a stronger international consensus before taking military action could foil Iran's efforts to diplomatically isolate the U.S., advised Jack Keane, a retired Army general who is close to the Trump administration.\n\n\"What the U.S. has the opening to do now, once it's gathered all the evidence, is present it to an emergency session of the U.N. Security Council,\" Keane said, calling that \"a vehicle to garner more support to counter future aggressive Iranian behavior.\"\n\nIf the Trump administration does seek to build a separate, broader coalition specifically for retaliatory action against Iran over the Saudi Aramco strikes, it\u2019s likely to come up empty \u2014 or nearly empty \u2014 for the same reasons the maritime coalition has struggled to gain traction.\n\n\u201cInternational allies don\u2019t know what Trump\u2019s going to do,\u201d said Kelly Magsamen, a former Obama administration Pentagon official at the Center for American Progress. \"They look at him and think one minute he\u2019s trying to get us into some sort of maritime coalition, and the next he\u2019s tweeting that he wants to meet [Iranian President Hassan] Rouhani.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not going to sign up for politically or militarily challenging endeavors without a better understanding of what U.S. strategy is\u201d on Iran, she added.\n\nSpooking traditional allies like Germany and France has left the administration \u201cwith very few cards to play at this point,\u201d said Magsamen.\n\nThe administration\u2019s habit of making major foreign policy pronouncements over Twitter or in other impromptu formats has also hurt allies\u2019 willingness to work jointly with the U.S. on matters as weighty as potential military action, Goldenberg said.\n\n\u201cThen they do things like release the intel on Twitter before talking to any allies about it,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not what you do. You take it to your friends and convince them, and then you go out together and make the case.\u201d", "description": "President Donald Trump hasn't yet blamed Iran outright for the latest attacks, which an Iranian-backed rebel group has claimed as its handiwork.", "authors": ["Wesley Morgan"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/5a/fd/96719d5e4d68a1d9f811792072fa/190917-trump-mbs-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
