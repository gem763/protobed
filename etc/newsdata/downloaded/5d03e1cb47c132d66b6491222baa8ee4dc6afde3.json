Thomas Clagett Jr. Memorial Clinic and Regatta, an event she has competed in since losing her sight nearly a decade ago.\n\nEach year, dozens of athletes with disabilities participate in the twice-a-year event, which is held in both Newport, Rhode Island, and Oyster Bay, New York. The mission is to provide a space for sailors with disabilities to train and compete at an elite level, and sailors of various abilities -- ranging from paraplegia to those missing limbs to those who are blind -- are invited to show off their skills.\n\nJJ Salvator Photography via Clagett Regatta\n\nSince its founding in 2002, 20 of the regatta\u2019s sailors have gone on to win medals at the Paralympics.\n\n\u201cThese sailors have done very well,\u201d Clagett president, chair and co-founder Judy Clagett McLennan told \u201cGMA.\u201d \u201cJust because you may not have a leg or you have a disease-driven issue doesn\u2019t mean that you are not a whole person inside and that you need to expel that competitive energy somewhere and sailing is one of the many ways they can do this.\u201d\n\nPerhaps no one is more competitive than Dowell, who has a degenerative eye disease that has left her legally blind.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very passionate about every aspect of sailing, and it\u2019s growing every year,\u201d she told \u201cGMA.\u201d\n\nJJ Salvator Photography via Clagett Regatta\n\nDowell loves sailing so much, she even resides on a sailboat in Boston Harbor with her guide dog.\n\n\u201cIt was always a dream to live on a boat,\u201d she said. \u201cI live year-round [on the boat] and yes, the boat is heated.\u201d\n\nShe says that sailing has given her a new beginning.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not allowed to drive. Even robots will have jobs driving but I will never do that,\u201d she said. \u201cI can drive the boat. I can make the boat go. I am able to be an integral part of a team and that\u2019s huge for me.\u201d\n\nJodi Munden is one of Dowell\u2019s closest teammates. Munden, who is blind herself, found sailing six years ago when a friend invited her to a sailing event in Ontario, Canada.\n\n\u201cIt gave me a whole new world of freedom and self-confidence,\u201d Munden said. \u201cIt gives a new meaning to the word independence and showing individuals what you can do as a blind athlete.\"\n\nThe duo has competed in a multitude of competitions all over the world against sighted and non-sighted athletes. They find the sport of sailing to be fairly equal for all participants, regardless of physical ability.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s this great equalizer where we can play on, basically, an even playing field... Off the water, it\u2019s not an even playing field,\u201d Munden explained.\n\nMore than certain other sports, sailing can be adapted based on competitors' physical abilities. For Dowell and Munden, they compete with the assistance of a sighted guide whose only job is to alert them if there is an obstacle or safety hazard.\n\nFor other competitors, equipment can be altered on the vessel to accommodate an athlete\u2019s physical needs.\n\nJJ Salvator Photography via Clagett Regatta\n\nThis is the case for Sarah Everhart Skeels, who was paralyzed from the waist down after a spinal cord injury in the early 1990s.\n\n\u201cI will be sitting in a seat that keeps me in the boat, but my job is to still sail the boat,\u201d she said.\n\nHer teammate, Cindy Walker, also suffered a spinal cord injury, leaving her unable to walk since the age of 14. Today, Walker has regained some movement in her legs but uses adaptive equipment to help her balance while sailing.\n\nJJ Salvator Photography via Clagett Regatta\n\n\u201cSailing is the only sport where there\u2019s no barriers,\u201d Walker said. \u201cI can take my family out in a sailboat, but I can\u2019t necessarily take my family to play wheelchair basketball.\u201d\n\nAt the end of the day, sailing comes down to skill.\n\n\u201cEveryone out on the water has a different ability. We happen to have abilities that are more identifiable to people, not necessarily on the water but here on land,\u201d Skeels said. \u201cIt\u2019s about capitalizing on what your abilities are and not worrying about what abilities you don\u2019t have.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more about being in the moment than it is about abilities,\u201d she added. \u201cThe disability is just another aspect of who we are, but we are sailors out on the water.\u201d", "description": "The C.
