The previous week\u2019s claims figure was revised up by 1,000 to 220,000.\n\nEconomists had expected claims to remain flat with the previously reported 219,000.\n\nJobless claims can be volatile week-to-week. The four-week average of claims, which smooths out that volatility, rose by 1,000 to 213,740. That is considered a very low number.\n\nBecause jobless claims are a proxy for layoffs, they have been closely watched for signs that economic conditions\u2013including tariffs, the UAW General Motors strike, or the contraction in the manufacturing sector\u2013are costing jobs for American workers. The low levels of claims, as well as very low unemployment, indicates that U.S. businesses are reluctant to let workers go despite some strains.\n\nJobless claims can also weigh on consumer spending, causing consumers to pull back when they rise. The low and falling jobless claims is likely to support consumer spending, a crucial element of economic growth.", "description": "Layoffs are scarce in the United States despite concerns over global growth and trade tensions. | Economy", "authors": ["John Carney"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/Donald-Trump-buy-American-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
