Two minutes of prayer, visualization, meditation for those in the way of the storm.\u201d\n\nWilliamson posted the tweet on Wednesday morning and deleted it less than two hours later, replacing it with a more neutral \u201cPrayers for the people of the Bahamas, Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas. May the peace of God be upon them and their hearts be comforted as they endure the storm.\u201d\n\nThe Category 5 hurricane devastated the Bahamas this week, killing at least seven people with dozens more missing. Thousands of homes were destroyed.\n\nMarianne Williamson; Hurricane Dorian (Yahoo News photo Illustration; photos: Ben Margot/AP, Nick Hague/NASA) More\n\n\u201cWe are in the midst of a historic tragedy,\u201d said the Bahamian prime minister, Hubert Minnis. \u201cThe devastation is unprecedented and extensive.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was a metaphor,\u201d the Williamson campaign told Yahoo News in a statement. \u201cWhen others speak of prayer and the mind it\u2019s considered profound, but Williamson is held to a different standard. Because the comment led to confusion it was replaced. Everyone please pray for the people of the Bahamas, Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas. May the peace of God be upon them, may they and their families remain safe and their hearts be comforted as they endure the storm.\u201d\n\nWilliamson, whose dogma is based on a New Age text called \u201cA Course in Miracles,\u201d had a series of viral moments in early debates touting the power of love over fear and the danger of \u201cdark psychic forces.\u201d Her anti-hurricane idea is similar to the \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d generally expressed by politicians following mass shootings.\n\nThis summer Williamson defended comments she made that were seen as anti-vax, including calling mandatory vaccines \u201cdraconian\u201d and \u201cOrwellian.\u201d Williamson denies that is her position, although she has a history of similar statements.\n\nThe bestselling author failed to qualify for next week\u2019s presidential debate due to low polling numbers, generally recording zero percent in most of the Democratic National Committee-approved surveys. She did reach the requisite 130,000 donors to qualify, although at least some of those donations came from Republicans who thought she would embarrass the rival party.\n\nVisualizing the hurricane away is not the only unconventional anti-hurricane policy that\u2019s been suggested recently. Last month, Axios reported that President Trump asked advisers multiple times if it made sense to fire nuclear weapons at hurricanes to slow them down.\n\n\"They start forming off the coast of Africa, as they're moving across the Atlantic, we drop a bomb inside the eye of the hurricane and it disrupts it. Why can't we do that?\" a source told Axios, paraphrasing Trump\u2019s remarks.\n\nTrump has denied he suggested the tactic, but a 2017 National Security Council memo details one of the conversations in which he brought it up.\n\nPhysicists say doing so would spread radiation over a large area and wouldn\u2019t work; the power of a hurricane is orders of magnitude greater than even a large nuclear explosion.\n\n_____\n\nDownload the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:", "description": "The New Age author and Democratic presidential candidate posted, and then quickly deleted, a tweet suggesting that it was \u201cnot a wacky idea\u201d to collectively visualize Hurricane Dorian turning away from land.", "authors": ["Christopher Wilson", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/N1jGBCaLwx1u2VIPlPdHJA--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/0e5fd100-cf29-11e9-8dff-97e1bbc03a2c"}
