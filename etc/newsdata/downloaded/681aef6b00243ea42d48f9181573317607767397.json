However, unlike many boxers, I have continued to maintain my fitness and healthy lifestyle since my last fight with Steve Collins.\n\n\"I acknowledge the risks associated with the sport, and fully understand the importance of being fully assessed by medical professionals. Therefore, I\u2019ve welcomed the requirements of BIBA to clearly establish that I AM \u2018fit to box\u2019.\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\"I have undergone numerous and regular medical investigations to confirm this, including periodic MRI brain scans. Now that I\u2019m in the UK, within the next few weeks I have welcomed (at the request of BIBA) a further series of tests \u2013 including another MRI brain scan to provide clear clarification of my state of health.\n\n\"BIBA are also facilitating additional safeguarding at ringside for my fight (which far exceeds the criteria of any other sanctioning organisation).\n\n\"My desire to box again is something that has remained within me for several years\u2026 It is MY choice alone, and I've not been persuaded or coerced by any other person.\n\n\"I feel like that I am being discriminated against because of my age. I can also confirm that I have chosen to fight an opponent who is a renowned former world champion in his own right. The challenge that I\u2019ve set myself is high.\n\n\"This IS a tough challenge, but one that I feel I need to pursue to bring about final closure and an inner peace of mind for myself as a man. It\u2019s NOT about the money, it\u2019s about closing a desire that remains within my mind, body and soul.\n\n\"This is my dream, and I hope boxing fans around the world will embrace my wishes, and support and respect the fact that this is my decision alone.\"\n\nBenn had been warned that he \"could die\" if he entered the ring for the fight by former manager Peter DeFreitas.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t said a word about Nigel in 23 years but now he\u2019s fighting again it\u2019s time to talk,\" DeFreitas said to the Daily Star.\n\n\"I\u2019m talking because I\u2019m concerned - I fear for his life.\"", "description": "Nigel \nBenn was set to make his first appearance in the ring for 23 years against Sakio Bika on November 23 in Birmingham", "authors": ["Alex Smith", "Image", "Paisley Daily Express", "Nigelbennofficial Instagram", "Action Images Via Reuters", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20465062.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Nigel-Benn-Press-Conference.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
