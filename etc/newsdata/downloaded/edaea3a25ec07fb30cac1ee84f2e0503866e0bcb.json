Doug Olson, president of Meredith Magazines, said in a press release that the company doubled its presence in the women\u2019s lifestyle category in 2018 when it acquired the Time Inc. portfolio of brands.\n\n\u201cOur portfolio philosophy continues to emphasize investing in brands that are market leaders and/or possess the highest growth potential,\u201d Olson said. \u201cSometimes, that means making hard decisions.\u201d\n\nFamily Circle was founded in 1932. It changed hands several times during its history and went to Meredith in 2005 as part of the company's purchase of Gruner + Jahr USA. It is published 12 times a year with a ratebase of 4 million.\n\nSome Family Circle employees will move elsewhere in Meredith, the company said. Cheryl Brown, Family Circle\u2019s editor-in-chief, is moving to Health as its executive editor. The company didn\u2019t specify how many employees would lose their jobs.\n\n\u201cFortunately, we have been able to find new roles for some of the Family Circle team, and I would like to thank the entire group for its hard work and wish those employees affected the best in future endeavors,\u201d Olson said.\n\nThe publisher said subscribers will receive another Meredith title until their subscription is filled.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "The monthly title\u2019s December 2019 issue will be its last.", "authors": ["James Leggate"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/family-circle-covers.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
