REUTERS/Philippe Wojazer/File Photo\n\nShares of the company rose 7% in premarket trading as it posted the first rise in international sales in a year during the third quarter and a 3.6% dip in U.S. retail motorcycle sales - the smallest decline in nearly three years.\n\nProfits continued to sink - by 24% - but the results offered some hope that one of the biggest names in motorcycles was finally beginning to arrest a slide in global sales that it has been fighting for years.\n\nSales in the world\u2019s biggest motorcycle markets in Asia, which Harley has targeted with smaller bikes that go against its traditional profile, rose 8.7% in the quarter and are up about 1.6% this year overall.\n\nThe company plans to source half of its revenue from overseas by 2027 and international retail sales rose 2.7% to 23,619 motorcycle in the quarter.\n\nWhile worldwide shipments fell 5.8% to 45,837 motorcycles, they topped analysts\u2019 estimates by over 1,000 motorcycles, and the Milwaukee, Wisconsin-based company stuck to its 2019 shipment target of 212,000 to 217,000 bikes.\n\nThe company is also cutting spending and it said it now saw 2019 capital expenses of $205 million to $225 million, about $20 million less than its previous estimates.\n\nExcluding items, the company earned 70 cents per share, beating Wall Street expectations of 52 cents while revenue from motorcycles and related products overall fell 4.9% to $1.07 billion.\n\nTARIFF HIT DOUBLES\n\nThe company, which has been criticized by President Donald Trump for its plan to shift some U.S. production overseas, has also been battling the effects of trade tensions on its business globally.\n\nEarlier this year, it said retaliatory import duties imposed by the European Union on its bikes would cost the company between $100 million and $120 million in 2019.\n\nBrussels in June raised import duties on U.S.-manufactured Harley bikes to 31% from 6%, and the company said the impact from tariffs more than doubled in the third quarter from a year ago to $21.6 million.\n\nIn response, Harley plans to begin shipping bikes from its Thailand plant but a delay in regulatory approval from the trading bloc means it will not see any benefit in earnings before the second quarter of 2020.", "description": "Harley-Davidson Inc beat expectations for profit on Tuesday and stuck to its full-year shipment forecast, allaying fears of another major hit from European import tariffs and a further slump in sales in its main U.S. market.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191022&t=2&i=1443702696&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9L0XA", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
