(David J. Phillip)\n\nAn Arizona gun store is crediting a major sales bump to Democratic presidential candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke after turning his recent call for a buyback of high-powered firearms into a promotional event.\n\nAlpha Dog Guns in Tempe, Ariz. sold out of AR-15 and other rifles within four hours of running a discount dubbed the \u201cBeto Special,\u201d owner Matt Boggs said Thursday during an appearance on \u201cFox & Friends First.\u201d The sales gimmick, which priced rifles around $350, was prompted by O\u2019Rourke\u2019s comment during last week\u2019s Democratic presidential debate in Texas that he was committed to a mandatory gun buyback of certain high-powered firearms.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s a weapon that was designed to kill people on a battlefield, if the high-impact, high-velocity round when it hits your body shreds everything inside of your body because it was designed to do that, so that you would bleed to death on a battlefield not be able to get up and kill one of our soldiers,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said on the debate stage. \u201cWhen we see that being used against children . . . hell, yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.\u201d\n\nAlpha Dog Guns launched its sale the next morning and said on Facebook it was \u201cdiscounting AR15\u2032s to such a low price that EVERY AMERICAN can afford one.\u201d\n\n[There are so many AR-15s in U.S. consumer hands that it makes no sense to produce more, Colt says]\n\nThursday, the National Rifle Association sent a tweet that mockingly called O\u2019Rourke the \u201cAR-15 salesman of the month.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign didn\u2019t immediately respond to request for comment.\n\nBoggs, the store\u2019s owner, insists there was no grand strategy behind the promotion.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t really start this off to be a political statement by any stretch of the imagination. I just happened to hop on Facebook and see his comments, and I was like, \u2018Well maybe I\u2019ll sell 20 rifles and see what happens,\u2019\u201d he told Fox.\n\nBoggs said the reaction to the \u201cBeto Special\u201d in his community has been positive; he disputed O\u2019Rourke\u2019s claim \u2014 which drew cheers during the debate \u2014 that legal gun owners were warm to the idea of a mandatory buyback.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know anyone who owns an AR or an AK who is willing to actually give them up,\u201d Boggs said in the interview. \u201cYou\u2019re giving up your Second Amendment right.\u201d\n\nA recent Washington Post-ABC News opinion poll showed that while a majority of respondents favored gun-control measures such as background checks and so-called \u201cred flag laws,\u201d attitudes over mandatory buybacks of assault weapons were more evenly split. (They diverge more sharply across party lines.)\n\n[Support is moving in favor of gun control \u2014 but is it enough to pass new laws?]\n\nO\u2019Rourke has staked out the most aggressive stance on gun control among the field of Democratic presidential hopefuls, making it a central campaign issue following a mass shooting that killed 22 people in his hometown of El Paso in August. In addition to his support for gun buybacks, O\u2019Rourke also favors universal background checks, a national gun registry and tightening federal gun-trafficking laws.\n\nO\u2019Rourke\u2019s stance on firearm confiscation has drawn the ire not only of President Trump but of some of the presidential hopeful\u2019s fellow Democrats, too.\n\n\u201cI frankly think that clip will be played for years at Second Amendment rallies with organizations that try to scare people by saying Democrats are coming for your guns,\u201d Sen. Christopher A. Coons (D-Del.) told CNN the day after O\u2019Rourke\u2019s debate remark. \u201cI don\u2019t think a majority of the Senate or the country is going to embrace mandatory buybacks. We need to focus on what we can get done.\u201d\n\nDespite the pushback from some of his fellow party members, O\u2019Rourke is doubling down: He blasted Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.), saying that his fellow Democrat has accomplished \u201cabsolutely nothing\u201d on gun control.\n\n\u201cAsk Chuck Schumer what he\u2019s been able to get done,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said, speaking to reporters after a town hall in Aurora, Colo., on Thursday night. \u201cWe still don\u2019t have [universal] background checks. Didn\u2019t have them when he was in the majority, either. So, you know, the game that he\u2019s played, the politics that he\u2019s pursued have given us absolutely nothing and have produced a situation where we lose nearly 40,000 of our fellow Americans every year.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Rourke made the comments after Schumer downplayed Democrats\u2019 support for a mandatory buyback program for assault-style weapons.\n\nRead more:\n\nThe top 15 Democratic presidential candidates, ranked\n\n[We\u2019re asking 2020 Democrats where they stand on key issues]\n\nHow the NRA hijacked history", "description": "An Arizona gun store is trying to profit from Beto O'Rourke's comments on a mandatory buyback of guns.", "authors": ["Kim Bellware", "Reporter Covering National Breaking News", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/F5ChMhrzoiaI9Cx_TcfHvNhoh7A=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EEVCC4WWYMI6TCJEDW35VR4X7M.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
