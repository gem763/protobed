The companies include Zhejiang Dahua Technology, IFLYTEK Co, Xiamen Meiya Pico Information Co and Yixin Science and Technology Co.\n\nThe department filing said the \u201centities have been implicated in human rights violations and abuses in the implementation of China\u2019s campaign of repression, mass arbitrary detention, and high-technology surveillance against Uighurs, Kazakhs, and other members of Muslim minority groups.\u201d\n\n'If you enter a camp, you never come out': inside China's war on Islam Read more\n\nThe list includes municipal and county public security bureaus and the Xinjiang Police College.\n\nUS officials said the announcement was not tied to this week\u2019s resumption of trade talks with China. Being added to the \u201cEntity List\u201d bars companies or other entities from buying parts and components from US companies without US government approval.\n\nThe Commerce Department previously added Huawei Technologies Co and more than 100 affiliates to the Entity List.\n\nHikvision, officially known as Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology Co Ltd, with a market value of about $42bn, calls itself the world\u2019s largest video surveillance gear maker. Reuters reported in August Hikvision receives nearly 30% of its 50 billion yuan ($7 billion) in revenue from overseas.\n\nHikvision did not immediately comment on the Commerce Department\u2019s move. The Chinese embassy in Washington also did not immediately comment.\n\nIn April, a bipartisan group of US lawmakers urged the move against Chinese companies it called \u201ccomplicit in human rights abuses\u201d and specifically cited Hikvision and Dahua.\n\nChina faces growing condemnation from Western capitals and rights groups for setting up facilities that UN experts describe as mass detention centres holding more than one million ethnic Uighurs and other Muslims.\n\nUS Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said last week at the Vatican that \u201cwhen the state rules absolutely, it demands its citizens worship government, not God. That\u2019s why China has put more than one million Uighur Muslims ... in internment camps and is why it throws Christian pastors in jail.\u201d\n\nJohn Honovich, founder of surveillance video research company IPVM, said Hikvision and Dahua both use Intel Corp , Nvidia Corp, Ambarella Inc, Western Digital and Seagate Technology as suppliers and that the impact on the Chinese companies would be \u201cdevastating.\u201d Shares in Ambarella fell 12% in after-hours trading on the news.\n\nIn August, the Trump administration released an interim rule banning federal purchases of telecommunications equipment from five Chinese companies, including Huawei and Hikvision.\n\nHuawei has repeatedly denied it is controlled by the Chinese government, military or intelligence services and has filed a lawsuit against the US government\u2019s restrictions.", "description": "Xinjiang Police College and video surveillance company Hikvision among those blacklisted for implications in human rights violations", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/391d85fdabaf52740ddf49fd66be7e4c9210bb4a/0_166_5000_3001/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=dfe554b462f7bf857c39108e34c1d02a", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
