(Toni L. Sandys/The Washington Post)\n\nNicole Mosley applied for the Washington Mystics\u2019 in-arena DJ job four times over 10 years before she was finally offered the position in 2017. Known as DJ Heat to Mystics fans and local radio listeners, Mosley had a considerably easier time landing a gig with the team during its inaugural season in 1998, when she emailed a member of the front office and asked whether the WNBA expansion franchise could use a ballgirl.\n\nThat\u2019s how Mosley, who grew up in Southeast Washington and played sparingly on the basketball team at McKinley Tech High, came to spend the summer she turned 19 handing cups of Gatorade to players during timeouts, folding towels and mopping the MCI Center floor at every Mystics home game. It was slightly more exciting than her other job selling concessions at the Union Station movie theater.\n\n\u201cI always loved sports, and the \u201996 Olympic women\u2019s basketball team was a phenomenon,\u201d Mosley, 40, said in a phone interview. \u201cI got to see those players that were on that team. I remember [Mystics guard] Nikki McCray being so cool, and at the end of the season she gave me her practice jersey. I still have a ball signed by the team. Just the opportunity to be around these people, I think we were all a little star-struck. One of the other ball girls was a huge Sheryl Swoopes fan. She had a Swoopes T-shirt under her Mystics T-shirt when [Swoopes\u2019s Houston Comets played in D.C.].\u201d\n\nThe Mystics, who defeated the Connecticut Sun, 95-86, in Game 1 of the WNBA Finals on Sunday, went 3-27 in their first season but drew a league-best 15,000 fans per home game. Mosley remembers the energetic crowds more than the losses. During her freshman year at Morgan State, she spent a lot of her free time in the computer lab updating the Mystics fan site she created on Tripod. Eventually, her sports fandom took a back seat to her budding music career.\n\n[When the Mystics go to work, even in the WNBA Finals, it's business casual]\n\nMosley, who started DJing when she was 13, interned with Big Tigger at WPGC-FM while in college, an opportunity that led to a full-time job at the station. Mosley first applied for the Mystics\u2019 DJ position in 2008, but the team instead hired one of her WPGC colleagues, DJ Jealousy, who now works as the in-arena DJ for Georgetown and Capital City Go-Go games. She applied again in 2014 and 2015 but didn\u2019t receive a response either time.\n\n\u201cLooking back, I probably wasn\u2019t as prepared as I am now,\u201d Mosley said. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to get this gig for a while, but it seemed like everyone wanted this for me before I knew I wanted it.\u201d\n\nIn 2017, longtime Wizards host Trey Rainey encouraged Mosley to apply for the Mystics\u2019 position again. She was reluctant but did anyway and got the job after a competitive audition in which applicants were challenged to play songs for various in-game scenarios.\n\n\u201cTo me, I felt like it was a full-circle moment,\u201d said Mosley, who also works as a DJ at Baltimore\u2019s 92Q-FM. \u201cThat season was their 20th anniversary season, and I was a ballgirl for their first season. That\u2019s crazy.\u2019 \u201d\n\nBACC AT IT AGAIN!!!!! SECOND STRAIGHT WNBA FINALS!!! I\u2019M AMPED!!! LET\u2019S BRING IT HOME FOR DC!!!! OWWWWWWW!!!! https://t.co/4LWNzDmwJN \u2014 DJ Heat (@DJHeatDC) September 25, 2019\n\n[The inaugural Mytics almost never won. Now they think 'it is time' for a title.]\n\nDuring Mosley\u2019s first season as the Mystics\u2019 DJ, a leak in the roof at Capital One Arena delayed the start of the second half of a game against the Indiana Fever. Mosley kept fans and players entertained during the 45-minute delay by leading an impromptu dance-off. The video went viral, even appearing on \u201cSportsCenter.\"\n\nOn Mystics game days, Mosley begins playing music from a table at center court during the pregame shoot-around. She plays for another half-hour after the doors to the arena open before relocating to the upper level with her two laptops alongside the rest of the arena\u2019s audio team for the game.\n\nTo keep things fresh, Mosley changes her playlist from game to game. Mosley was in a pop mood for Game 1 of the semifinals and sprinkled in Britney Spears and David Guetta. Other nights she\u2019ll lean into throwback hip-hop by playing dance-inducing singles from the likes of Yung Joc or Soulja Boy. \u201cSwag Surfin\u2019 \u201d by F.L.Y., which has become the team\u2019s unofficial anthem, is a key part of Mosley\u2019s playoff rotation. Late in the regular season, the Mystics ball girls began providing Mosley a list of song requests from players before every game. She\u2019ll make mental notes of music featured in players\u2019 Instagram and Snapchat posts for additional inspiration.\n\n[Basketball is celebrated in Southeast D.C., and the Mystics are worthy of playing there]\n\n\u201cThe main thing is to get the fans and the team into it,\u201d Mosley said. \u201cThat\u2019s always my goal. Anything that has a nice tempo that you can clap along to, the whole arena is clapping along to the beat of the song. You can always win with old-school music. It\u2019s just feel-good things and fun things that make you want to enjoy the night even more.\u201d\n\nThe Mystics went 14-3 at home en route to capturing the No. 1 seed in the WNBA playoffs during a record-breaking regular season, their first at Entertainment and Sports Arena in Ward 8. Washington has won all three games it has hosted this postseason. While the team\u2019s new arena has roughly one-fourth the capacity of the building where Mosley served as the team DJ for the previous two years \u2014 and worked as a Mystics ballgirl for one summer two decades ago \u2014 the energy on game days, she said, is better than ever.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s electric. I\u2019ve never seen a crowd as amped as this year,\u201d Mosley said. \u201cI\u2019ll play music during the game, but sometimes I hear the crowd so into it that I won\u2019t play anything. I\u2019ll let the crowd get into the opposing team\u2019s head or amp up the players. It\u2019s freaking amazing. It\u2019s wonderful.\u201d\n\n\n\n(Courtesy of Nicole Mosley) (DJ Heat/DJ Heat)\n\nRead more from The Post:\n\nMystics guard Ariel Atkins lets her shot do the talking in WNBA Finals\n\n\u2018Playoff Emma is having some fun!\u2019 Mystics\u2019 reserved Meesseman puts on a show.\n\nThe inaugural Mystics seldom won.
