Everyone enjoys talking about it and imagining if it was real, but nobody really believes that it is.\n\nAnd really, nothing\u2019s changed on that count, but there are increasingly loud rumours that a new Half-Life VR game is underway at Valve and may be out very soon.\n\nSimilar rumours emerged earlier this year and even before that Valve were rumoured to be working on a new Half-Life for their Valve Index VR headset.\n\nValve has even admitted they\u2019re working on three big \u2018flagship\u2019 VR games, one of which is due out this year \u2013 although they never said what they are or if they\u2019re anything to do with Half-Life.\n\nValve Index \u2013 Half-Life would definitely be a killer app\n\nThe fan community at Valve News Network has pulled together all of Valve\u2019s comments and related rumours and predicted that Half-Life VR will be unveiled and released this year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey claim that it\u2019s been in development for around four years and intended as the killer app for Valve Index and VR in general.\n\nAll of which sounds perfectly plausible, include the suggestion that it will run on the Source 2 graphic engine and rely greatly on realistic physics \u2013 just like the original games.\n\nDetails on what exactly the game is still remain very limited, but it\u2019s suggested that Half-Life VR is a 12 to 16 hour single-player game where you play as Alyx Vance.\n\nIt\u2019s supposedly a prequel to Half-Life 2 though, so you still aren\u2019t going to get any closure on the ending of Half-Life 2: Episode Two.\n\nEmail gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter\n\nMORE: Thief robs Valve by taking \u00a333,000 of games and hardware home in a wheelie bin\n\nMORE: Valve Index pre-orders begin at \u00a3919, Half-Life VR still a possibility\n\nMORE: Half-Life 2: Episode Three plot revealed by ex-Valve writer \u2013 read it all here", "description": "Valve is planning a surprise release for a new 12-hour Half-Life adventure within the next three months, according to latest theories.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/hl2-e1416618897870_1571303405.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
