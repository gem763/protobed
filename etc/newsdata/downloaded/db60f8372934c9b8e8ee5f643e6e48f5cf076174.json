Ramos Miranda\n\nSANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chile's government will extend a state of emergency to cities in its north and south, President Sebastian Pinera said late on Sunday, after at least seven people were killed amid violent clashes and arson attacks over the weekend.\n\n\"We are at war against a powerful enemy, who is willing to use violence without any limits,\" Pinera said in a late-night televised statement at army headquarters in Santiago.\n\nHe confirmed the state of emergency he declared for Santiago on Saturday night, which brought the military onto the streets, would be extended to the north and south of the capital.\n\nProtests led by students began two weeks ago over fare hikes on public transport.\n\nPinera said Santiago\u00b4s metro and bus system would operate a partial service on Monday, along with hospitals and some schools and cr\u00e8ches, and appealed for Chileans to band together and help their neighbors to get on with their lives and remain safe.\n\n\"Tomorrow we will have a difficult day,\" he said. \"We are very aware that (the perpetrators of riots) have a degree of organization, logistics, typical of a criminal organization,\" he said.\n\n\"Today is not the time for ambiguities. I call on all my compatriots to unite in this battle against violence and delinquency,\" he said.\n\nInterior Minister Andres Chadwick told news conference in Santiago earlier on Sunday night that the decision to extend the emergency measure came amid an \"escalation of violence and vandalism.\"\n\nHe cited 70 \"serious incidents of violence\" on Sunday, including the looting of 40 supermarkets and other businesses. Chadwick said military and police numbers were at 10,500 in Santiago and would be reinforced where necessary.\n\nSantiago and other Chilean cities have been engulfed by several days of riots, along with peaceful protests, after the increase in public transport costs.
