This is the last time you're going to speak to them.'\n\nReading a statement on behalf of herself and her colleagues, Senior Constable Christine Barnes, whose surname at the time was Darlington, became emotional, as Ms Takiwa also wept.\n\n'We'd like to extend our sincerest condolences for the tragic loss of your beautiful children,' the officer said on Wednesday.\n\n'We joined police to save lives and make a difference. On the rare occasion, we are unable to do that.\n\n'We too carry that burden every day. Please accept our deepest sympathy for your loss.'\n\nSenior Constable Barnes, who was an acting sergeant in the District Control Centre at the time, asked a recruit and a sergeant to get more information from Ms Takiwa about the situation.\n\nMs Takiwa contacted police after her estranged partner (pictured together) made a threatening phone call where he said 'this is the last time you will speak to your kids'\n\nAt that stage, police did not have an address to dispatch a vehicle to, she said.\n\nSenior Constable Barnes said there was no history of domestic violence reported and she agreed with coroner Sarah Linton's suggestion that police could not just assume the worst-case scenario.\n\nAs tragic as the outcome was, police acted properly in conducting their inquiries and did everything they could, she said.\n\nSenior Constable Christine Barnes cried before she read a statement in court on Wednesday, as did Ms Takiwa (pictured with her kids)\n\nGrandmother Lois May testified that when police contacted her partner Douglas Headland to ask if he knew the children's whereabouts, she did not initially get a sense of urgency.\n\nShe also said they had rehashed that night over and over in their hearts and minds.\n\nMs Linton said she was unlikely to make recommendations in her findings and any potential adverse comments would be in a 'general sense'.\n\n'It's not that anyone failed in their duty or did the wrong thing in any specific sense, it's more about missed opportunities,' she said.\n\nSenior Constable Barnes said there was no history of domestic violence reported and she agreed with coroner Sarah Linton's suggestion that police could not just assume the worst-case scenario.
