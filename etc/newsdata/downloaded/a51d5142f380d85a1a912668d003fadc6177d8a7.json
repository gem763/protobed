The suit claims that the women were coerced into performing in x-rated scenes before being paid less than agreed.\n\nThe suit also claims that the women were told that their videos would remain anonymous and only be sold to private buyers in Australia.\n\nNow, Pratt's former administrative assistant, Valerie Moser, is revealing the scandals within the company using what she calls a 'Cover Your A** Journal,' according to The Daily Beast.\n\n'I have seen Michael Pratt attack an employee. [Another colleague] has shown me scars where Michael Pratt stabbed him,' Moser said in court transcripts.\n\n'I have seen him at his drunkest. I have seen the worst parts of him. I know what he's capable of. I think I understand the way his mind works and that's scary,' Moser told the court.\n\nMoser, who started working for Pratt in 2015, claimed that during his tantrums, he would smash phones and keyboards. When she was hired, Moser also signed a non-disclosure agreement.\n\nShe then testified about her primary role at the company, which included overseeing modeling contracts, expenses, and keeping the company stocked with prepaid credit cards.\n\nAccording to the Daily Beast, Moser claimed she was responsible for picking the models up from the airport, getting them in makeup and dropping them off at hotels for shoots.\n\nPratt allegedly told her to tell anyone who asked her about her role that she was 'an Uber driver'.\n\nIn August, the first of 22 women testified in San Diego Superior Court against Girls Do Porn (file image) as part of a lawsuit against the company. The suit claims that the women were coerced into performing in x-rated scenes before being paid less than agreed\n\nMoser told the court that she had no idea that the name of the company was Girls Do Porn when she was hired.\n\nIt wasn't until later on when she overhead Pratt use the real name that she realized the company's name was not BLL Media, which is one of several alternate names for Girls Do Porn.\n\nHe then instructed her to never use Girls Do Porn and if asked use Plus One Media, according to the Daily Beast.\n\nMoser then talked about overhearing another conversation while Pratt was speaking with a model.\n\nThe model was upset because Pratt allegedly told her and others that the footage of them would be mailed directly to private buyers in Australia and their identities would be kept a secret.\n\nSeveral models then started sending complaints to Moser about the videos that were allegedly uploaded directly online and often racked up hundreds of thousands of views.\n\nAccording to Moser, the models asked for their videos to be removed and even offered their earnings in exchange.\n\nWhen Moser sent the complaints to Pratt, he allegedly told her to block their numbers.\n\nIn 2016, when the class action lawsuit was filed against Girls Do Porn, Pratt allegedly instructed Moser to delete all of the messages and complaints from the models as well as shred all of the receipts and expenses that she had kept up with.\n\nThat's when she started documenting everything in her 'Cover Your A** Journal'.\n\nMoser was ultimately fired in 2018 when Pratt learned about the journal.\n\nIn August, the first of the 22 women, who are all identified from Jane Doe 1 to 22, gave testimony at San Diego Superior Court that she responded to a Craigslist advert in 2016.\n\nJane Doe 15 said her video was circulated widely online - despite contractual promises that the recordings was to be distributed on DVD abroad only.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that the company made millions in profits by coercing young women into the scenes, by initially advertising themselves online as a modelling website and lying to them about the conditions of the scenes.\n\nGirls Do Porn, an adult subscription service, started in 2006, by Pratt, of New Zealand.\n\nThe company trafficked in x-rated videos involving women aged 18-22 and advertised that it was the 'one and only time [the girls] do porn'.\n\nBut the 22 women claim Pratt and his associates defrauded and underpaid the women, making false promises about the distribution of the material to victims, many of whom were too young to drink.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Jane Doe 15, who was 18 at the time, admitted she consented to the shoots but only on the understanding that the videos would not include any identifying information, and would only be distributed to private collectors abroad.\n\nDespite the understanding, Jane Doe 15 claimed she and the other models later discovered the tapes had been widely distributed online - along with their names, phone numbers and personal information.\n\nAccording to Jane Doe 15, she responded to a Craigslist advert for models (file image). She said that when she agreed to the terms, the video of her was circulated widely online - despite contractual promises that the recordings was to be distributed on DVD abroad only\n\nJane Doe 15 said in her testimony: 'If I had known that, not only was it going on the internet but that they were posting it on the internet, that my name would be attached to it, that it would be in the United States, and that I wouldn't be paid $5,000, but $2,000 less, and insulted because I was pale and bruised; if I had known that it was more than 30 minutes of filming, if I had known any of that, just any one of those; if I had known that other girls had been harassed and kicked out of school for it, if I had known that I would be kicked off the cheer team; if I had known any of that, I wouldn't have done it,' the Daily Beast reported.\n\nAccording to Jane Doe 15, she responded to a Craigslist advert for models.\n\nShe was contacted by a 'Jonathan N' - who attorneys claim is a pseudonym for Pratt - and offered $5,000 to film adult scenes.\n\nThe agreement was five sexual positions, each for around seven minutes and that it would be filmed in a San Diego hotel, with return flights to the city covered by them.\n\n'He said it would be 30 minutes of filming sex,' Doe 15 recalled in court. 'He said it would be $5,000 dollars. He said specifically about five positions, five to seven minutes each. He would fly me out to San Diego, pay for a hotel.\n\n'And then he just repeatedly said: \"Not online, not online, not in the US\" - it would be on DVDs to Australia, the UK. And then he said a few other really remote countries, I don't remember. And then I asked if I could just do regular modeling, and he said no, it had to be both.'\n\nShe was even allegedly put in contact with two women who themselves had apparently been filmed and had never been exposed, to assuage her fears.\n\nOne such woman has since admitted she was paid to speak to the victims and convince them, earning $200-300 each time.\n\nThe plaintiff alleged on the day of filming, the adult star she would partner with arrived and immediately threw up, and then began smoking cannabis which he offered to her.\n\nJane Doe 15's attorneys attest that it undermined her ability to sign contracts.\n\nMeanwhile, the adult film star, called Andre Garcia, only paid her $3,000 and not the agreed higher sum because 'she was pale and had bruises'.\n\nDespite agreements to the contrary, Jane Doe 15 claims the videos were quickly circulated online and her entire friendship group and many college peers became aware.\n\nShe said was kicked off her cheerleading squad, began suffering from panic attacks, and moved away from the campus to relieve her anxiety.\n\nAdditionally, it affected her relationship with her boyfriend, a college baseballer who was left 'humiliated'.\n\nThe case is ongoing, with more women still preparing to provide their testimony. It was reported that the adult film company has attempted so far to disrupt proceedings by filing bankruptcy, intentional subpoena dodging, and another series of miscellaneous delays.\n\nIn a previous statement to NBC 7, Aaron Sadock, the website owners' attorney, said all of the women were of age and signed contracts agreeing to be in the videos.\n\n'The models...made statements on video agreeing the pornographic videos could be used in any manner the producer wished to use them,' wrote Sadock.\n\n'Some models regret the choice they made. But those models were free to decide whether to star in a pornographic video or not. Nobody forced them.'\n\nMeanwhile, Pratt fled the country in September. He was due to testify in the lawsuit but fled the US instead.\n\nDailyMail.com has approached Pratt's attorneys for comment.", "description": "A whistleblower has revealed that Girls Do Porn owner Michael Pratt (left) was violent and prone to tantrums in a shocking testimony for a class-action lawsuit against the company.", "authors": ["Valerie Edwards For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/08/29/19/17844420-0-image-a-24_1567103483223.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
