It found city staff ignored inquiries from rival providers and allowed the vendor to help define the scope of its contract.\n\nThe public version of the report does not identify the officials or the dollar amount of the contract.\n\nRonald Villa, assistant chief operating officer for the city, filed a 9-page response that disputes many of the findings. However, he agreed to implement all the audit\u2019s recommendations.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The San Diego Union-Tribune, http://www.utsandiego.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "An audit concludes San Diego employees improperly awarded a multimillion-dollar contract to a vendor that provided information technology services to the city.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
