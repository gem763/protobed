But you can\u2019t do that over one transfer window, so you have to be patient because it will be slow.\n\n\u2018What he is trying to do was much needed. He needs time.\u2019\n\nOn Sunday, Solskjaer\u2019s struggling Manchester United face a Newcastle side second from bottom in the Premier League, having won just once this season.\n\nAnd Red Devils legend Giggs added: \u2018They are both at massive clubs. When you don\u2019t win regularly at big clubs you are going to get criticised.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s a tough club, Newcastle. I knew Steve Bruce as a player and he was a leader. They are both big enough characters to turn it around.\n\n\u2018Everyone needs time and a bit of luck. Every top manager has had luck along the way.\n\n\u2018You need luck with injuries and the odd decision. It\u2019s a big game for both of them at the weekend.\u2019\n\nThe Red Devils face Newcastle on Sunday (Picture: Getty)\n\nSolskjaer, meanwhile, has heaped praise on Manchester United\u2019s young players ahead of the trip to St James\u2019 Park.\n\n\u2018We\u2019re not in the 90s now so it\u2019s a different era, a different group that we\u2019re building,\u2019 he said. \u2018We know there are going to be ups and downs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018But I\u2019m ready to see these boys blossom. There\u2019s not many clubs with our stature that play the young players that we do.\n\n\u2018They\u2019ll have a chance to come through and we\u2019re sure that some of these will be part of a successful team.\u2019\n\nMORE: How Christian Pulisic has reacted to being sidelined by Frank Lampard at Chelsea", "description": "Ryan Giggs says Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Manchester United need to sign five more players to bring the glory days back to Old Trafford.
