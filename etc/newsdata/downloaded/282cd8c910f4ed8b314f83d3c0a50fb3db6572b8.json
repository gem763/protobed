Earnings were up 9% after adjustments and exceeded expectations from analysts, according to FactSet.\n\nThe industrial conglomerate recorded sales of $9.09 billion for the quarter, down 16% from the comparable quarter last year and following the company's move to spin off businesses. Analysts were expecting $9.12 billion in sales.\n\nThe company's sales rose 3% on an organic basis, which excludes currency fluctuations and the effect of deals, and sales in the company's aerospace business rose 10% on the same measure.\n\nThe aerospace business, Honeywell's largest unit by sales, generated $3.54 billion in sales for the quarter. The company produces a range of aerospace systems and technology, from electric power systems to engine controls.\n\nThe company has previously said that it didn't expect any major impact from the grounding of the Boeing Co.'s 737 MAX plane, which uses some of its products.\n\nCharlotte, N.C.-based Honeywell has moved to slim down in recent years, spinning off its home and transportation businesses into two separate companies.\n\nThe company on Thursday nudged down the top end of its sales outlook for 2019, saying it now expects to generate up to $36.9 billion in sales, down from a prior forecast that saw up to $37.2 billion in sales.\n\nHoneywell increased the bottom end of its adjusted-profit forecast. It said it expects to earn at least $8.10 a share on that metric, compared with a prior outlook that foresaw at least $7.95 a share.\n\nIn addition to its aerospace products, Honeywell makes rubber boots, industrial-automation products, water-processing systems and other products.\n\nShares of Honeywell were off 1% in premarket trading.\n\nWrite to Dave Sebastian at dave.sebastian@wsj.com and Micah Maidenberg at micah.maidenberg@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 17, 2019 07:30 ET (11:30 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
