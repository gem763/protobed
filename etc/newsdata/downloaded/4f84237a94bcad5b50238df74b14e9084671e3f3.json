She's crazy,' the president told Fox News' Sean Hannity in an interview that aired Monday.\n\n'She's accusing everyone of being a Russian agent,' Trump also told reporters, referring to Clinton. 'She's not a Russian agent. These people are sick. There's something wrong with them.'\n\nTrump added that he thought Clinton's substance-free accusations against Gabbard ultimately would help his own political chances in 2020.\n\nSanders also came to her defense.\n\n'Tulsi Gabbard has put her life on the line to defend this country. People can disagree on issues, but it is outrageous for anyone to suggest that Tulsi is a foreign asset,' Sanders tweeted Monday evening, making mention of her overseas deployment.\n\n'Thank you for speaking the truth,' Gabbard said when asked what her reaction was to Sanders' defense.\n\nReports emerged that Clinton dropped the engagement because former Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen is also attending\n\nBernie Sanders also came to Gabbard's defense. Gabbard stepped down from her post as vice chairwoman of the DNC and endorsed Sanders in 2016 instead of establishment Democrat Hillary Clinton\n\nHe said the attack from Clinton against Gabbard is 'outrageous'\n\nIn 2016, Gabbard quit as vice chairwoman of the DNC and endorsed Sanders instead of Clinton in the Democratic primary race. At the time she also accused Democratic party leaders of stifling her freedom of speech and unfairly tipping the scales in favor of Clinton's presidential campaign.\n\nShe insisted in a video over the weekend that her decision to support Sanders could be linked to Clinton's 'smear' of her now.\n\n'People warned me in 2016 that my endorsement of Bernie Sanders would be the end of my 'political career' -- they said Clinton would never forget, that she and her rich and powerful friends -- her allies in politics and the media -- will make sure you're destroyed,' Gabbard said in the video posted to her Twitter Sunday.\n\n'If they can falsely portray me as a traitor, then they can do it to anyone -- and in fact, that's exactly the message they want to get across to you,' Gabbard continued.\n\n'If you stand up to Hillary and the party power brokers -- if you stand up to the rich and powerful elite and the war machine, they will destroy you and discredit your message. But, here is the truth: They will not intimidate us. They will not silence us,' she said.\n\nSanders joined the likes of a handful of other Democratic candidates who have come to Gabbard's defense in the last few days: entrepreneur Andrew Yang, former Rep. Beto O'Rourke and author and spiritual adviser Marianne Williamson.\n\nClinton also said Gabbard is a 'favorite of the Russians,' likely due to the fact she is a frequent mention in Russian and Kremlin-backed media outlets.\n\nGabbard suggested that she wants a chance to confront Clinton, but that will not be happening at the Fortune Most Powerful Women Summit this week.\n\nClinton, who was scheduled to appear at the summit with a trove of other powerful women, said she last week she would no longer be going. Although Merrill cited a scheduling conflict, reports indicate she dropped the engagement because the event would also feature Trump's former Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.\n\nGabbard is critical of the Democratic establishment \u2013 even though she's running in the Democratic primary. She even floated boycotting the October debates, accusing the Democratic Party of 'rigging' the election and obviously favoring certain candidates during the debates.", "description": "Tulsi Gabbard said Monday she wants to confront Hillary Clinton after the failed 2016 presidential candidate perpetuated a conspiracy theory that she's a 'Russian asset.'", "authors": ["Katelyn Caralle", "U.S. Political Reporter For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/15/20040456-0-image-a-15_1571756136181.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
