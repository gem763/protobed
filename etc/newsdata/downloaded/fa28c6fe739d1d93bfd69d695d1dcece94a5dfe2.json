Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), who has decried the ultra-wealthy\u2019s influence in politics in the past, has received contributions from at least 30 billionaires over the course of her political career, the New York Post found.\n\nWarren prides her presidential bid as a 100 percent grassroots-funded campaign. While she has raised millions \u2014 an impressive $24.6 million in the third quarter \u2014 she reportedly used $10.4 million in leftover funds from her 2018 senatorial bid to cushion her current campaign. During the course of her senatorial campaign, Warren happily attended fundraisers and accepted money from big donors, sparking questions surrounding her newfound commitment to keep big donors out of politics.\n\nThe New York Post analyzed Warren\u2019s past campaign contributions and found that she has accepted donations from at least 30 billionaires throughout her political tenure.\n\nThe Post reports:\n\nChristopher Sacca, a venture capitalist who appeared on \u201cShark Tank\u201d, gave $2,800 to Warren in May. The 2020 Democratic presidential candidate also netted two $2,500 contributions from GitHub founder Tom Preston-Werner\u2019s wife, Theresa, in June. That same month Susan Pritzker, wife of Hyatt heir Nicholas Pritzker II, donated $2,500 to Warren. The donations run from 2011 to 2019 and include contributions to Warren\u2019s presidential and Senate campaigns. Most of the individual billionaires are giving at or near the maximum contribution limit, which currently is $2,800 for the primary and $2,800 for the general election for a total for $5,600.\n\nThis revelation comes in the wake of Warren\u2019s public criticisms of the wealthy. Over the summer, the presidential hopeful bragged that billionaires \u201caren\u2019t in favor\u201d of the idea of her presidency:\n\nAre you telling me that billionaires aren\u2019t in favor of my being president of the United States? I\u2019m shocked! pic.twitter.com/XJf0kQIJC0 \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) July 4, 2019\n\nBut @realDonaldTrump is right \u2013 I am angry, and so are a lot of Americans. Angry because his corrupt cronies control the levers of government to help their billionaire buddies. Angry because DC kicks dirt in the teeth of working people time and time again. We've had enough of it. \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) March 11, 2018\n\n.@realDonaldTrump\u2019s economic plan? Cut taxes for billionaires & the rules on Wall Street, & leave working families behind. #debatenight \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) September 27, 2016\n\nAmerica\u2019s future isn\u2019t stronger when @realDonaldTrump gives away gigantic tax breaks to billionaires & giant corporations so there\u2019s no money for education, infrastructure, & the tools we need to succeed. \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) January 31, 2018\n\nI believe Washington should work for you\u2014not billionaires or Wall Street. I'm Elizabeth Warren, and I approve this message. pic.twitter.com/MSnFyiEJxu \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 2, 2019\n\nWhile Warren has not gone as far as her ideological counterpart, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), in calling for the disappearance of billionaires, the \u201cUltra-Millionaire Tax\u201d has become a hallmark of her campaign. The proposal would implement a two percent wealth tax on those with more than $50 million in assets. A three percent tax would be imposed on individuals with more than $1 billion in assets:\n\nThe rich & powerful run Washington. Here\u2019s one benefit they wrote for themselves: After making a killing from the economy they\u2019ve rigged, they don't pay taxes on that accumulated wealth. It\u2019s a system that\u2019s rigged for the top if I ever saw one. \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) January 24, 2019\n\nWhat's \u201cridiculous\u201d is billionaires who think they can buy the presidency to keep the system rigged for themselves while opportunity slips away for everyone else. The top 0.1%, who'd pay my #UltraMillionaireTax, own about the same wealth as 90% of America. It's time for change. https://t.co/D04G5fNvpa \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) January 29, 2019\n\nWarren came under fire last week after refusing to say if her potential running mate would refrain from attending high-dollar fundraisers.\n\n\u201cIs your vice presidential pick going to also try and avoid those high-dollar fundraisers as well?\u201d a reporter asked.\n\nInstead of offering an emphatic \u201cyes,\u201d Warren dodged the question, calling it \u201ca little premature.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know, I think it\u2019s a little premature to be talking about vice presidential. We\u2019re still in primary here, and I\u2019m working hard on this,\u201d she said.\n\nBut look, I want a vice presidential partner, someone who\u2019s going to get out there and fight for the same values,\u201d she added:", "description": "Sen.
