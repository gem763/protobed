Dave Birkett, Detroit Free Press\n\nThe Green Bay Packers beat the Detroit Lions, 23-22, on a last-second field goal by Mason Crosby.\n\nThe Packers moved to 5-1 and took sole possession of first place in the NFC North.\n\nHowever, that was not the topic of discussion following the clash of rivals at historic Lambeau Field.\n\nInstead, it was several questionable calls by the referees that had people \u2014 both current and former NFL players, and other experts \u2014 angry in the aftermath of the \"Monday Night Football\" game.\n\nFrom Lions legend and Pro Football Hall of Famer Barry Sanders to former Packers linebacker and current Los Angeles Rams player Clay Matthews, here's a look at the intense reaction to the refs.\n\nThat is sickening... the @NFL needs to look at a way to prevent that from happening. Two phantom hands to the face calls really hurts us tonight. Yes, we could have scored TDs, but @Lions played too well to have the game end this way. #DETvsGB@espn \u2014 Barry Sanders (@BarrySanders) October 15, 2019\n\nThe storyline for the 2019 season continues to be the refs inability to make the accurate and correct calls week in and week out. Al Riveron continues to blindly side with his refs and the current status quo. Something must change! Zero accountability. ...#throughthewire \u2014 Clay Matthews III (@ClayMatthews52) October 15, 2019\n\nThe refs need to be investigated. This is horrendous. Check bank accounts. #NoExcuses \u2014 Desmond Howard (@DesmondHoward) October 15, 2019\n\nThere needs to be an explanation about this. You can\u2019t make that call TWICE and nothing comes of it. That\u2019s embarrassing. \u2014 Louis Riddick (@LRiddickESPN) October 15, 2019\n\nThe bogus personal foul and the non call Pass Interference was six more points. Four wrong calls is hard to imagine. https://t.co/GUoT0h7JV4 \u2014 Tony Dungy (@TonyDungy) October 15, 2019\n\nIn my 11 years involved with the NFL, I\u2019ve never seen worse officiating than this year and it\u2019s not even close. \u2014 TJ Lang (@TJLang70) October 15, 2019\n\nI'm obviously biased toward the Packers, but the refs are taking this game away from the Lions. \u2014 Andrew Brandt (@AndrewBrandt) October 15, 2019\n\nOnce again the officials determined the outcome of a game. Just a darn shame. \u2014 Joe Theismann (@Theismann7) October 15, 2019\n\nGreen Bay can thank the refs for that touchdown \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2642\ufe0f \u2014 Reggie Bush (@ReggieBush) October 15, 2019\n\nDon\u2019t blame us Detroit. We're not the ones who pushed the \u201crefs are trash\u201d button. \u2014 Buffalo Wild Wings (@BWWings) October 15, 2019\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.
