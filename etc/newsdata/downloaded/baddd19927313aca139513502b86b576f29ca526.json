Plenty of bricks are being added to that wall for investors to scale. But the worry might not be justified. Stocks slid on Friday following a Bloomberg report that the Trump administration is mulling curbs on U.S. investments in China, including limiting pension funds\u2019 holdings of Chinese stocks and delisting those shares from U.S. exchanges. This would escalate the U.S.-China trade war by adding capital flows to the conflict, which already involves tariffs on billions of goods transactions.\n\nIn actuality, this proposal has been around a while, according to Leland Miller, who heads China Beige Book International. And looking beyond the sensational headlines and the extreme comments in the Twittersphere, there is good justification for it.\n\nWhat\u2019s actually being discussed would plug a loophole exempting Chinese companies from the same disclosure requirements that other foreign and U.S. concerns face. These exemptions were granted by the Securities and Exchange Commission during the Obama administration, Miller explains. Legislation sponsored by Sen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.) also would prevent U.S. pension funds from investing in opaque Chinese companies, rather than letting them pour money \u201cinto a black hole,\u201d Miller adds.\n\nThe proposed measure is \u201csomething that should have been done on day one,\u201d he says. It shows the levers that Washington can pull in trade negotiations, but the idea that the government wants to cut off China from U.S. capital markets doesn\u2019t add up. Chinese authorities can readily provide funding to their companies internally, Miller points out.\n\nMoreover, China has net foreign assets of $1.3 trillion, observes David P. Goldman, an Asia Times columnist and former head of bond research at several top Wall Street banks. That shows China is not in need of foreign capital.\n\nStill, U.S.-traded Chinese stocks took a hit on Friday. The exchange-traded fund (ticker: MCHI) fell 2.2%, while Alibaba Group Holding (BABA) plunged 5.2%. Even the ETF (ASHR), which tracks China-based shares traded in Shanghai and Shenzhen, fell 1.3%. Goldman sees a buying opportunity.\n\nThen there\u2019s the worry that the belly-flops of some high-profile initial public offerings portends bad things for stocks. Actually, Peloton Interactive \u2019s (PTON) IPO provides an apt metaphor for the overall market: lots of furious spinning, going nowhere. The S&P 500 index isn\u2019t far from where it stood a year ago or at the end of January 2018. And it has been left in the dust by bonds, with the ETF (TLT) up 21.39% over the past 12 months, versus 1.64% for the S&P 500. If the equity market is showing rational reluctance to provide profitable exits for private investors in profitless unicorns, that\u2019s all good.\n\nAn arcane corner of the money market, repurchase agreements, also has gotten outsize attention. There has been a lot more demand for credit, owing to seasonal factors such as tax payments, a rise in Treasury borrowing, and the coming quarter end, combined with less liquidity because of the shrinkage of the Fed\u2019s balance sheet. The central bank has responded by providing repos to the market and will probably increase its assets to match the expansion of its liabilities, mainly currency and bank reserves. In other words, it\u2019s about double-entry accounting, not a crisis.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nAnd then there\u2019s politics. While cable news has been all impeachment, all the time, it matters less to either Main Street or Wall Street. Just as Watergate didn\u2019t bother Lynyrd Skynyrd, the start of House impeachment inquiries is likely to have scant impact on consumer sentiment, which has been plateauing, along with stocks, for the past 12 months.\n\nFar more important are the bottom-line matters of jobs and incomes. On the plus side, the unemployment rate stood near a half-century low of 3.7% in August, with more job openings than available workers, according to various surveys. But employment growth and hours worked have slowed, suggesting waning growth in demand for labor.\n\nMore Up & Down Wall Street How to Solve the Public Pension Crisis\n\nBank of America Merrill Lynch economists estimate that payroll growth of about 128,000 a month would keep the jobs market in equilibrium. That\u2019s higher than some Federal Reserve economists\u2019 estimates in the range of 50,000-100,000 per month. Merrill\u2019s analysis suggests that job growth is slowing to a break-even point where labor demand just meets supply. Tariffs could slow hiring further. That would begin to raise the jobless rate and put a damper on spending, they conclude.\n\nSeptember employment data due out on Friday could indicate whether that\u2019s beginning. Economists project a payroll rise of 150,000, up from August\u2019s 130,000 but below the 173,000 average of the past 12 months, and bolstered by Census hiring. The workweek (34.4 hours, at last count) and hourly earnings (up 3.2% over the past year) also will be tells if the U.S. economy is working for average Americans. And that counts more to them than impeachment.\n\nWrite to Randall W.
