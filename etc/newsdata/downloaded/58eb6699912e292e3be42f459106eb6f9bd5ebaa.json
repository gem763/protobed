Graham: The White House\u2019s impossible job\n\nThen there was Tucker Carlson, a figure without precedent in American politics. On the June 21 broadcast of Carlson\u2019s show, just as Bolton was urging a military response to Iran, Carlson devoted a long segment to comparing Bolton to a \u201ctapeworm\u201d that had infested the Republican security establishment and that now was feasting on the ample guts of Trump himself. Carlson has reportedly served as an informal adviser to Trump, and his show sometimes seems intended for an audience of one (the occupant of the Oval Office). Days after that show, when Bolton was packing his bags for Mongolia, Carlson accompanied Trump to Korea. By all evidence, the president preferred his advice to the advice he was getting in-house.\n\nThe question I asked at the time\u2014how long can Bolton put up with this?\u2014now has an answer. \u201cI disagreed strongly with many of his suggestions, as did others in the Administration,\u201d Trump tweeted after firing Bolton and before thanking him for his service. Bolton, in his own tweet minutes later, sounded stunned: \u201cI offered to resign last night and President Trump said, \u2018Let\u2019s talk about it tomorrow\u2019\u201d\u2014implying that Trump\u2019s tweet amounted to saying, \u201cYou can\u2019t quit\u2014you\u2019re fired!\u201d (No doubt the dispute about whether Bolton was fired or quit voluntarily will affect Bolton\u2019s COBRA coverage. But that is a matter for White House HR.)\n\nBecause Bolton has expressed himself with such pungency and clarity over the course of decades in public life, we know what he thinks, and it is easy to discern the nature of his disagreements with the president. Bolton thinks that self-described enemies of the United States\u2014especially nuclear proliferators such as North Korea and Iran\u2014should be punished, rather than rewarded; that friendship with such regimes is dangerous and dishonorable; and that willingness to project American military force is a necessary precondition of lasting peace. Trump, we now know definitively, disagrees with each of these propositions. He will happily strike deals, and his proposed move in North Korea is to lure Kim with visions of condominiums and resorts overlooking the Yellow Sea.\n\nEarlier this year I wrote a profile of Bolton. In my interviews with him, he sometimes prefaced a statement with \u201cThe president thinks,\u201d or \u201cIt\u2019s the president\u2019s view that.\u201d This preamble, I came to understand, most often meant that Bolton was about to say something that he personally thought was nonsense. \u201cIt\u2019s the president\u2019s view that he will meet with anyone, at any time,\u201d Bolton once told me, poker-faced. Indeed, Trump was willing, until the last minute, to meet with the Taliban at Camp David, on the eve of the anniversary of the September 11 attacks. He has met with Kim twice. Trump\u2019s willingness to hold talks may or may not be wise, but there is little doubt that Bolton considers it comically naive. He would prefer that Trump line up the world\u2019s dirtbag dictators and read them a riot act for a new century, with a guarantee of humiliation and ruin for anyone who defies America and its allies. This riot act would not mention luxury condos.", "description": "His dismissal by tweet came after an unusually long prelude of disrespect, both by President Trump and by favored allies.", "authors": ["Graeme Wood", "Staff Writer At"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/_S5A6145_03_RGB/facebook.jpg?1568142447", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
