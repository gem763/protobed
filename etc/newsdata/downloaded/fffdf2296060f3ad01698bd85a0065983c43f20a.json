Aid agencies have warned of a humanitarian crisis, with nearly a half-million people at risk near the border.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump cleared the way for Turkey\u2019s air and ground assault after he pulled American troops from their positions near the border, drawing swift bipartisan criticism that he was endangering regional stability and abandoning Syrian Kurdish forces that brought down the Islamic State group in Syria.\n\nTrump has warned Turkey to act with moderation and safeguard civilians, and the Pentagon said the operation is a threat to progress in combatting IS militants and a potential threat to U.S. troops in Syria.\n\nPlumes of black smoke billowed Friday from the Syrian border town of Tal Abyad as Turkey continued bombarding the area in an offensive that was progressing \u201csuccessfully as planned,\u201d the Turkish Defense Ministry said.\n\nTurkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu has said the military intends to move 30 kilometers (19 miles) into northern Syria and that its operation will last until all \u201cterrorists are neutralized.\u201d NATO member Turkey considers the Syrian Kurdish fighters to be terrorists linked to a Kurdish insurgency inside Turkey and says the offensive is a counterterrorism operation necessary for its own national security.\n\nThe Defense Ministry statement reported the death of two Turkish soldiers, with three wounded, but did not give details. Defense Minister Hulusi Akar said 342 \u201cterrorists\u201d \u2014 Ankara\u2019s term for Syrian Kurdish militiamen \u2014 have been killed so far. The figure could not be independently verified. Syrian activists say only eight fighters were killed.\n\nThe Kurdish militia has fired dozens of mortars into border towns inside Turkey in the past two days, including Akcakale, according to officials in two provinces on the Turkish side. They said at least nine civilians were killed, including a 9-month-old boy and three girls under 15.\n\nMourners in Akcakale carried the coffin of the slain boy, Mohammed Omar Saar, as many shouted, \u201cDamn the PKK!\u201d referring to the Kurdish insurgent group in Turkey linked to Syrian Kurdish fighters. The PKK is considered a terrorist group by Turkey, the United States and other countries.\n\nThe latest attack hit the town of Suruc, and a child in the town of Ceylanpinar died of his wounds Thursday night, the Anadolu Agency reported.\n\nOn the Syrian side, seven civilians have been killed since Wednesday, activists said.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin said he doubts that the Turkish army has enough resources to take control of prison camps in the region housing Islamic State detainees, and he fears the captured fighters \u201ccould just run away,\u201d leading to a revival of the militant group.\n\n\u201cWe have to be aware of this and mobilize the resources of our intelligence to undercut this emerging tangible threat,\u201d Putin said during a visit to Turkmenistan.\n\nThe Syrian Kurdish forces had been holding more than 10,000 IS members, but they said they are being forced to abandon some of those positions to fight the Turkish invasion.\n\nIn Washington, chief Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman said Defense Secretary Mark Esper \u201cmade clear\u201d in a phone call Thursday with his Turkish counterpart that the U.S. opposes the incursion.\n\nEsper told his counterpart that the military actions \u201cplace at risk\u201d the progress made to defeat the extremists and he urged Turkey to stop its operation, according to Hoffman. Esper also said the incursion \u201crisks serious consequences\u201d for Turkey, and he expressed his concern that it could harm U.S. personnel in Syria.\n\nSeparately, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg urged Ankara to exercise restraint, although he acknowledged what he said was Turkey\u2019s legitimate security concerns about the Syrian Kurdish fighters.\n\nIn a joint news conference with Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu, Stoltenberg also expressed worry that the Turkish offensive could \u201cjeopardize\u201d gains made against IS. Cavusoglu said Turkey expected solidarity from its allies.", "description": "Turkish forces pushed deeper into northeastern Syria on Friday, the third day of Ankara\u2019s offensive against U.S.-allied Syrian Kurdish fighters, as casualties mounted, international criticism of the campaign intensified and thousands of civilians fled the violence.
