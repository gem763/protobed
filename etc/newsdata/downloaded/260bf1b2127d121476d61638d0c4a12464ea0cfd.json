Here is part of their conversation.\n\nDid you post anything about the protests?\n\nYes I did, of course. But this is not with me in uniform. I was just doing it like a normal Hong Kong citizen.\n\nWe've been doing it for years, all kind of protests. It seems not a problem to them at that time.\n\nWere you warned that you shouldn't be participating in any form?\n\nThey just warned us, \"You can't participate in those illegal ones,\" but the those I participated in [were] legal. We got the no objection notification from the police.\n\nYou call your termination part of a \"white terror\" campaign. What do you mean by that?\n\nYeah, because they are asking us to even keep our mouth shut when you're in your private time, when you're off duty and you're not in your uniform.\n\nActually, we are not representing the company. We are just telling everyone or share our thoughts or share some post or make some comments on some events using our own private Facebook accounts.\n\nWhy the company would have the right, or they would even listen to the Chinese authority, to ask the employees to stop doing this, we just found ridiculous.\n\nYou shouldn't oppress one's freedom of speech because it's granted by the basic law. And we have been enjoying it. We have been doing it for so many years in Hong Kong, even after 1997.\n\nDemonstrators hold signs opposing the recent firings of Cathay Pacific employees as they gather for a demonstration at the Edinburgh Square in Hong Kong on Aug. 28, an event organized by the main trade union representing employees.

[They] even search baggage. They have to ask all kinds of safety questions, check our safety equipment on board.\n\nActually, our crews at the beginning were very tolerant. Our crews are very patient. They know it is not [the] company's problem. They are very understanding. They realize it's something we can't avoid because when China says that they have the right to stop protesters from flying through their airspace and even flying to China, we know that it is related to our job.\n\nRebecca, you're not just an employee of Cathay Pacific, but you were also cabin crew union leader and the chairwoman of the 2,000-member Hong Kong Dragon Airlines Flight Attendants' Association.\n\nWhat happens to those workers now?\n\nAs soon as they know that I've been terminated, even the union representative, the union chairperson, all the members [were] very angry.\n\nIt's not fair when you're exercising your own freedom of speech, and you didn't even say anything bad about the company. - Rebecca Sy\n\nThey're sad and they're shocked, but they're very angry as well because they know that I've never done anything wrong and I shouldn't be terminated just because I admit that Facebook belongs to me.\n\nIt's not fair when you're exercising your own freedom of speech, and you didn't even say anything bad about the company.\n\nRebecca, I'm wondering how tense the situation is in Hong Kong right now for you?\n\nFor me, although I have to handle my own legal persecution ... I want to tell the public what I'm doing now is also fighting for the freedom of speech for Hong Kong people, not just for myself.\n\nI'm trying my best to fight for the justice and that they made a wrong decision to terminate us because we have a different political stance.\n\nWritten by Amara McLaughlin, with files from Reuters.
