Charlie Lim (Official Audio)\n\nThe single certainly shows Yeo at his most emotive, offering a glimpse at what the rest of Recovery Channel has in store.\n\n\u201cI had been going through a lot, and I made some really bad choices over the past 16 months,\u201d he confesses. A severe back injury, followed by a nervous breakdown, and the death of his father all seemed to hit Yeo at once. \u201cI hurt a lot of people around me, and those people were my friends. Even though I did that, they stuck around. When I reached out for support, they rallied around me, and it was a very eye-opening experience.\u201d\n\nThis was how By Myself (and much of the album) was born, Lim being one of the people who Yeo reached out to.\n\nA group of teen Hong Kong dancers wants the city to embrace hip hop culture\n\nFans will notice a shift in style and tone in the new tracks, as Yeo channels a slower, more contemplative rhythm-and-blues groove, compared to the bouncier electropop of his previous material.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t do it on purpose, it\u2019s just the way it came out,\u201d admits the musician.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to feel every individual element a little bit more when I\u2019m making music now,\u201d he reveals, adding that he enjoys singing more than ever before.\n\nFrom the military to musician: Charlie Lim's path to music faced challenging internships and heartbreak\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pushing my voice to do things it\u2019s never really done before, and it\u2019s really reaching the part of my audience who pay attention to lyrics. They\u2019re not just there for the big bass drops, the 808s [drum machine beats] and dancing the night away. They care about the story, and how it makes them feel.\u201d\n\nThis approach signifies how much the Melbourne-based musician has grown as a songwriter.\n\n\u201cWhen I turned 19, I\u2019d written a couple of songs that got played on national radio, and received really positive online reviews. I knew that I wanted to produce, and it just so happened that no one else really wanted to sing the songs that I wrote \u2013 so I sang them!\u201d he laughs. \u201cBut when you get played on radio for the first time, it\u2019s euphoric!\u201d", "description": "The singer-songwriter discusses the experiences that inspired his contemplative new record", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/576c634e-efd2-11e9-9f3d-785f2d889e39imagehires151436.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
