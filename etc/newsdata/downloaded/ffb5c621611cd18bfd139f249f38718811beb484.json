I really think that\u2019s fair, and this problem is obvious now.\n\n\u201cWe will not be the victim of this problem. We play tonight, we wanted to win it, we did that, and if they don\u2019t find a proper date for us, then we cannot play the next round and whoever is our opponent will go through \u2013 or Arsenal play them.\u201d\n\nIt seems highly unlikely the EFL would run the risk of allowing Klopp to carry out his threat, considering the commercial and television appeal the record eight-time winners of the competition carry.\n\nBut Klopp has put the ball firmly in the organisation\u2019s court and given then plenty of warning of the potential consequences.\n\nIronically, Liverpool feared they might be kicked out of the competition after fielding an ineligible player in the previous round against Milton Keynes Dons.\n\nBut instead the Champions League holders were fined for playing Spanish midfielder Pedro Chirivella, who didn\u2019t have international clearance.\n\nMeanwhile, under-fire Arsenal boss Unai Emery defended his decision to take off Mesut Ozil in the second half.\n\nOzil, making only his third appearance of the season, had a hand in three of Arsenal\u2019s goals, but Emery still took off the German midfielder.\n\nThe move came days after Arsenal midfielder Granit Xhaka swore at fans when he was booed following his substitution against Crystal Palace.\n\n\u201cWe had decided beforehand (to take off Ozil). He worked well in 65 minutes. We are going to play on Saturday and in my mind there\u2019s the possibility to use him again,\u201d Emery said.\n\n\u201cOzil played very well. He played a very good match.\u201d", "description": "Liverpool (AFP) \u2013 Jurgen Klopp has warned Liverpool could pull out of the League Cup if the English Football League do not help with their hectic", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/30/916a22_liverpool-curtis-jones-is-congratulated-by-jurgen-klopp-scoring-winning-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
