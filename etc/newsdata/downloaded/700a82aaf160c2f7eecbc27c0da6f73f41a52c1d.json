You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nJust in time for the onset of crisp weather, the duo has delivered a collection brimming with pieces that promise to take pride of place in your winter wardrobe, from cosy checked jumpers to elevated sportswear.\n\n\u201cPringle of Scotland has a long history of collaboration, and this latest partnership with H&M has been hugely inspiring,\u201d says Katy Wallace, brand director at Pringle of Scotland.\n\n\u201cWe are always looking for new ways to express the DNA of our heritage knitwear and we hope this latest playful, sporty take on our famous argyle and fair isle knitwear will delight our existing customers, as well as reach a worldwide audience via H&M.\u201d\n\nThe British knitwear label\u2019s iconic highland argyles and jacquards fill the collection, with a subtle twist. Key pieces include a sweater which combines a retro-inspired diamond pattern with heavy ribbed wool, as well as a cropped, funnel-necked jumper with balloon sleeves.\n\nElsewhere, traditional yarns come generously oversized with raw-edged sweaters and jumper dresses feature ring-pull zip closures.\n\nUsing recycled polyester and organic cotton alongside cosy wool, the collection comes in an autumn-ready palette of grey, biscuit brown and mustard, peppered throughout with flashes of acid yellow.\n\nIn a playful touch for dog-lovers, the collection also includes dog sweaters in matching prints and colours.\n\nThe prices are also pleasingly affordable, starting at \u00a36.99 for a pair of fingerless gloves and going up to \u00a349.99 for a chunky knitted cardigan.\n\n\u201cThe collaboration with Pringle of Scotland, a brand with such a rich and impressive history, has been so much fun for the H&M design team,\u201d says Maria Ostblom, head of design womenswear at H&M.\n\n\u201cWe have re-worked the iconic argyles and jacquards to incorporate a youthful and sporty touch and I\u2019m proud that we have managed to employ a range of recycled polyesters, wools and organic cottons. I look forward to seeing our customers style the pieces in their own way.\u201d\n\nClick through the gallery above to see every piece from the new collection.\n\nH&M x Pringle of Scotland is available to buy in-store worldwide and online at hm.com from 3 October.", "description": "Our fashion roundups are unbiased.
