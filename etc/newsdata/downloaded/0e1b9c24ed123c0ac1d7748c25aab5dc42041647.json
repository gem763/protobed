To be a parent is to be compromised. You pledge allegiance to justice for all, you swear that private attachments can rhyme with the public good, but when the choice comes down to your child or an abstraction\u2014even the well-being of children you don\u2019t know\u2014you\u2019ll betray your principles to the fierce unfairness of love. Then life takes revenge on the conceit that your child\u2019s fate lies in your hands at all. The organized pathologies of adults, including yours\u2014sometimes known as politics\u2014find a way to infect the world of children. Only they can save themselves.

An admissions officer at a private school with brand-new, beautifully and sustainably constructed art and dance studios gave him a piece of paper and crayons. While she questioned my wife and me about our work, our son drew a yellow circle over a green squiggle.\n\nRather coolly, the admissions officer asked him what it was. \u201cThe moon,\u201d he said. He had picked this moment to render his very first representational drawing, and our hopes rose. But her jaw was locked in an icy and inscrutable smile. Later, at a crowded open house for prospective families, a hedge-fund manager from a former Soviet republic told me about a good public school in the area that accepted a high percentage of children with disabilities. As insurance against private school, he was planning to grab a spot at this public school by gaming the special-needs system\u2014which, he added, wasn\u2019t hard to do. Wanting to distance myself from this scheme, I waved my hand at the roomful of parents desperate to cough up $30,000 for preschool and said, \u201cIt\u2019s all a scam.\u201d I meant the whole business of basing admissions on interviews with 2-year-olds. The hedge-fund manager pointed out that if he reported my words to the admissions officer, he\u2019d have one less competitor to worry about. When the rejection letter arrived, I took it hard as a comment on our son, until my wife informed me that the woman with the frozen smile had actually been interviewing us. We were the ones who\u2019d been rejected. We consoled ourselves that the school wasn\u2019t right for our family, or we for it. It was a school for amoral finance people. At a second private school, my wife watched intently with other parents behind a one-way mirror as our son engaged in group play with other toddlers, their lives secured or ruined by every share or shove. He was put on the wait list. Places at the preschool were awarded on a first-come, first-served basis. At the front of the line, parents were lying in sleeping bags. They had spent the night outside. The system that dominates our waking hours, commands our unthinking devotion, and drives us, like orthodox followers of an exacting faith, to extraordinary, even absurd feats of exertion is not democracy, which often seems remote and fragile. It\u2019s meritocracy\u2014the system that claims to reward talent and effort with a top-notch education and a well-paid profession, its code of rigorous practice and generous blessings passed down from generation to generation. The pressure of meritocracy made us apply to private schools when our son was 2\u2014not because we wanted him to attend private preschool, but because, in New York City, where we live, getting him into a good public kindergarten later on would be even harder, and if we failed, by that point most of the private-school slots would be filled. As friends who\u2019d started months earlier warned us, we were already behind the curve by the time he drew his picture of the moon. We were maximizing options\u2014hedging, like the finance guy, like many families we knew\u2014already tracing the long line that would lead to the horizon of our son\u2019s future. The mood of meritocracy is anxiety\u2014the low-grade panic when you show up a few minutes late and all the seats are taken. New York City, with its dense population, stratified social ladder, and general pushiness, holds a fun-house mirror up to meritocracy. Only New York would force me to wake up early one Saturday morning in February, put on my parka and wool hat, and walk half a mile in the predawn darkness to register our son, then just 17 months old, for nursery school. I arrived to find myself, at best, the 30th person in a line that led from the locked front door of the school up the sidewalk. Registration was still two hours off, and places would be awarded on a first-come, first-served basis. At the front of the line, parents were lying in sleeping bags. They had spent the night outside.\n\nI stood waiting in the cold with a strange mix of feelings. I hated the hypercompetitive parents who made everyone\u2019s life more tense. I feared that I\u2019d cheated our son of a slot by not rising until the selfish hour of 5:30. And I worried that we were all bound together in a mad, heroic project that we could neither escape nor understand, driven by supreme devotion to our own child\u2019s future. All for a nursery school called Huggs. New York\u2019s distortions let you see the workings of meritocracy in vivid extremes. But the system itself\u2014structured on the belief that, unlike in a collectivized society, individual achievement should be the basis for rewards, and that, unlike in an inherited aristocracy, those rewards must be earned again by each new generation\u2014is all-American. True meritocracy came closest to realization with the rise of standardized tests in the 1950s, the civil-rights movement, and the opening of Ivy League universities to the best and brightest, including women and minorities. A great broadening of opportunity followed. But in recent decades, the system has hardened into a new class structure in which professionals pass on their money, connections, ambitions, and work ethic to their children, while less educated families fall further behind, with little chance of seeing their children move up. From June 2018: The 9.9 percent is the new American aristocracy When parents on the fortunate ledge of this chasm gaze down, vertigo stuns them. Far below they see a dim world of processed food, obesity, divorce, addiction, online-education scams, stagnant wages, outsourcing, rising morbidity rates\u2014and they pledge to do whatever they can to keep their children from falling. They\u2019ll stay married, cook organic family meals, read aloud at bedtime every night, take out a crushing mortgage on a house in a highly rated school district, pay for music teachers and test-prep tutors, and donate repeatedly to overendowed alumni funds. The battle to get their children a place near the front of the line begins before conception and continues well into their kids\u2019 adult lives. At the root of all this is inequality\u2014and inequality produces a host of morbid symptoms, including a frantic scramble for status among members of a professional class whose most prized acquisition is not a Mercedes plug-in hybrid SUV or a family safari to Maasai Mara but an acceptance letter from a university with a top\u201110 U.S. News & World Report ranking.\n\nIn his new book, The Meritocracy Trap, the Yale Law professor Daniel Markovits argues that this system turns elite families into business enterprises, and children into overworked, inauthentic success machines, while producing an economy that favors the super-educated and blights the prospects of the middle class, which sinks toward the languishing poor. Markovits describes the immense investments in money and time that well-off couples make in their children. By kindergarten, the children of elite professionals are already a full two years ahead of middle-class children, and the achievement gap is almost unbridgeable. On that freezing sidewalk, I felt a shudder of revulsion at the perversions of meritocracy. And yet there I was, cursing myself for being 30th in line. 2. Not long after he drew the picture of the moon, our son was interviewed at another private school, one of the most highly coveted in New York. It was the end of 2009, early in President Barack Obama\u2019s first term, and the teachers were wearing brightly colored hope pendants that they had crafted with their preschoolers. I suppressed disapproval of the partisan display (what if the face hanging from the teachers\u2019 necks were Sarah Palin\u2019s?) and reassured myself that the school had artistic and progressive values. It recruited the children of writers and other \u201ccreatives.\u201d And our son\u2019s monitored group play was successful. He was accepted.\n\nThe school had delicious attributes. Two teachers in each class of 15 children; parents who were concert pianists or playwrights, not just investment bankers; the prospect later on of classes in Latin, poetry writing, puppetry, math theory, taught by passionate scholars. Once in, unless a kid seriously messed up, he faced little chance of ever having to leave, until, 15 years on, the school matched its graduates with top universities where it had close relations with admissions offices. Students wouldn\u2019t have to endure the repeated trauma of applying to middle and high schools that New York forces on public-school children. Our son had a place near the very front of the line, shielded from the meritocracy at its most ruthless. There was only one competition, and he had already prevailed, in monitored group play. Two years later we transferred him to a public kindergarten. My wife and I are products of public schools. Whatever torments they inflicted on our younger selves, we believed in them. We had just had our second child, a girl. The private school was about to start raising its fee steeply every year into the indefinite future. As tuition passed $50,000, the creatives would dwindle and give way to the financials. I calculated that the precollege educations of our two children would cost more than $1.5 million after taxes. This was the practical reason to leave. But there was something else\u2014another claim on us. The current phrase for it is social justice. I\u2019d rather use the word democracy, because it conveys the idea of equality and the need for a common life among citizens. No institution has more power to form human beings according to this idea than the public school. That was the original purpose of the \u201ccommon schools\u201d established by Horace Mann in the mid-19th century: to instill in children the knowledge and morality necessary for the success of republican government, while \u201cembracing children of all religious, social, and ethnic backgrounds.\u201d\n\nThe claim of democracy doesn\u2019t negate meritocracy, but they\u2019re in tension. One values equality and openness, the other achievement and security. Neither can answer every need. To lose sight of either makes life poorer. The essential task is to bring meritocracy and democracy into a relation where they can coexist and even flourish. My wife and I are products of public schools. Whatever torments they inflicted on our younger selves, we believed in them. We wanted our kids to learn in classrooms that resembled the city where we lived. We didn\u2019t want them to grow up entirely inside our bubble\u2014mostly white, highly and expensively educated\u2014where 4-year-olds who hear 21,000 words a day acquire the unearned confidence of insular advantage and feel, even unconsciously, that they\u2019re better than other people\u2019s kids. Public schools are a public good. Our city\u2019s are among the most racially and economically segregated in America. The gaps in proficiency that separate white and Asian from black and Latino students in math and English are immense and growing. Some advocates argue that creating more integrated schools would reduce those gaps. Whether or not the data conclusively prove it, to be half-conscious in America is to know that schools of concentrated poverty are likely to doom the children who attend them. This knowledge is what made our decision both political and fraught. From October 2017: Americans have given up on public schools. That\u2019s a mistake.\n\nOur \u201czoned\u201d elementary school, two blocks from our house, was forever improving on a terrible reputation, but not fast enough. Friends had pulled their kids out after second or third grade, so when we took the tour we insisted, against the wishes of the school guide, on going upstairs from the kindergarten classrooms and seeing the upper grades, too. Students were wandering around the rooms without focus, the air was heavy with listlessness, there seemed to be little learning going on. Each year the school was becoming a few percentage points less poor and less black as the neighborhood gentrified, but most of the white kids were attending a \u201cgifted and talented\u201d school within the school, where more was expected and more was given. The school was integrating and segregating at the same time. One day I was at a local playground with our son when I fell into conversation with an elderly black woman who had lived in the neighborhood a long time and understood all about our school dilemma, which was becoming the only subject that interested me. She scoffed at our \u201czoned\u201d school\u2014it had been badly run for so long that it would need years to become passable. I mentioned a second school, half a dozen blocks away, that was probably available if we applied. Her expression turned to alarm. \u201cDon\u2019t send him there,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s a failure school. That school will always be a failure school.\u201d It was as if an eternal curse had been laid on it, beyond anyone\u2019s agency or remedy. The school was mostly poor and black. We assumed it would fail our children, because we knew it was failing other children.\n\nThat year, when my son turned 5, attending daytime tours and evening open houses became a second job. We applied to eight or nine public schools. We applied to far-flung schools that we\u2019d heard took a few kids from out of district, only to find that there was a baby boom on and the seats had already been claimed by zoned families. At one new school that had a promising reputation, the orientation talk was clotted with education jargon and the toilets in the boys\u2019 bathroom with shit, but we would have taken a slot if one had been offered. Among the schools where we went begging was one a couple of miles from our house that admitted children from several districts. This school was economically and racially mixed by design, with demographics that came close to matching the city\u2019s population: 38 percent white, 29 percent black, 24 percent Latino, 7 percent Asian. That fact alone made the school a rarity in New York. Two-thirds of the students performed at or above grade level on standardized tests, which made the school one of the higher-achieving in the city (though we later learned that there were large gaps, as much as 50 percent, between the results for the wealthier, white students and the poorer, Latino and black students). And the school appeared to be a happy place. Its pedagogical model was progressive\u2014\u201cchild centered\u201d\u2014based on learning through experience. Classes seemed loose, but real work was going on. Hallways were covered with well-written compositions. Part of the playground was devoted to a vegetable garden. This combination of diversity, achievement, and well-being was nearly unheard-of in New York public schools. This school squared the hardest circle. It was a liberal white family\u2019s dream. The admission rate was less than 10 percent. We got wait-listed.\n\nThe summer before our son was to enter kindergarten, an administrator to whom I\u2019d written a letter making the case that our family and the school were a perfect match called with the news that our son had gotten in off the wait list. She gave me five minutes to come up with an answer. I didn\u2019t need four and a half of them. I can see now that a strain of selfishness and vanity in me contaminated the decision. I lived in a cosseted New York of successful professionals. I had no authentic connection\u2014not at work, in friendships, among neighbors\u2014to the shared world of the city\u2019s very different groups that our son was about to enter. I was ready to offer him as an emissary to that world, a token of my public-spiritedness. The same narcissistic pride that a parent takes in a child\u2019s excellent report card, I now felt about sending him in a yellow school bus to an institution whose name began with P.S. A few parents at the private school reacted as if we\u2019d given away a winning lottery ticket, or even harmed our son\u2014such was the brittle nature of meritocracy. And to be honest, in the coming years, when we heard that sixth graders at the private school were writing papers on The Odyssey, or when we watched our son and his friends sweat through competitive public-middle-school admissions, we wondered whether we\u2019d committed an unforgivable sin and went back over all our reasons for changing schools until we felt better.\n\nBefore long our son took to saying, \u201cI\u2019m a public-school person.\u201d When I asked him once what that meant, he said, \u201cIt means I\u2019m not snooty.\u201d He never looked back. Paul Spella 3. The public school was housed in the lower floors of an old brick building, five stories high and a block long, next to an expressway. A middle and high school occupied the upper floors. The building had the usual grim features of any public institution in New York\u2014steel mesh over the lower windows, a police officer at the check-in desk, scuffed yellow walls, fluorescent lights with toxic PCBs, caged stairwells, ancient boilers and no air conditioners\u2014as if to dampen the expectations of anyone who turned to government for a basic service. The bamboo flooring and state-of-the-art science labs of private schools pandered to the desire for a special refuge from the city. Our son\u2019s new school felt utterly porous to it. I had barely encountered an American public school since leaving high school. That was in the late 1970s, in the Bay Area, the same year that the tax revolt began its long evisceration of California\u2019s stellar education system. Back then, nothing was asked of parents except that they pay their taxes and send their children to school, and everyone I knew went to the local public schools. Now the local public schools\u2014at least the one our son was about to attend\u2014couldn\u2019t function without parents. Donations at our school paid the salaries of the science teacher, the Spanish teacher, the substitute teachers. They even paid for furniture. Because many of the families were poor, our PTA had a hard time meeting its annual fundraising goal of $100,000, and some years the principal had to send out a message warning parents that science or art was about to be cut. Not many blocks away, elementary schools zoned for wealthy neighborhoods routinely raised $1 million\u2014these schools were called \u201cprivate publics.\u201d Schools in poorer neighborhoods struggled to bring in $30,000. This enormous gap was just one way inequality pursued us into the public-school system.\n\nWe threw ourselves into the adventure of the new school. We sent in class snacks when it was our week, I chaperoned a field trip to study pigeons in a local park, and my wife cooked chili for an autumn fundraiser. The school\u2019s sense of mission extended to a much larger community, and so there was an appeal for money when a fire drove a family from a different school out of its house, and a food drive after Hurricane Sandy ravaged the New York area, and a shoe drive for Syrian refugees in Jordan. We were ready to do just about anything to get involved. When my wife came in one day to help out in class, she was enlisted as a recess monitor and asked to change the underwear of a boy she didn\u2019t know from another class who\u2019d soiled himself. (Volunteerism had a limit, and that was it.) The private school we\u2019d left behind had let parents know they weren\u2019t needed, except as thrilled audiences at performances. But our son\u2019s kindergarten teacher\u2014an eccentric man near retirement age, whose uniform was dreadlocks (he was white), a leather apron, shorts, and sandals with socks\u2014sent out frequent and frankly needy SOS emails. When his class of 28 students was studying the New York shoreline, he enlisted me to help build a replica of an antique cargo ship like the one docked off Lower Manhattan\u2014could I pick up a sheet of plywood, four by eight by 5/8 of an inch, cut in half, along with four appropriate hinges and two dozen plumbing pieces, if they weren\u2019t too expensive? He would reimburse me.\n\nThat first winter, the city\u2019s school-bus drivers called a strike that lasted many weeks. I took turns with a few other parents ferrying a group of kids to and from school. Everyone who needed a ride would gather at the bus stop at 7:30 each morning and we\u2019d figure out which parent could drive that day. Navigating the strike required a flexible schedule and a car, and it put immense pressure on families. A girl in our son\u2019s class who lived in a housing project a mile from the school suddenly stopped attending. Administrators seemed to devote as much effort to rallying families behind the bus drivers\u2019 union as to making sure every child could get to school. That was an early sign of what would come later, of all that would eventually alienate me, and I might have been troubled by it if I hadn\u2019t been so taken with my new role as a public-school father teaming up with other parents to get us through a crisis. 4. Parents have one layer of skin too few. They\u2019ve lost an epidermis that could soften bruises and dull panic. In a divided city, in a stratified society, that missing skin\u2014the intensity of every little worry and breakthrough\u2014is the shortest and maybe the only way to intimacy between people who would otherwise never cross paths. Children become a great leveler. Parents have in common the one subject that never ceases to absorb them. In kindergarten our son became friends with a boy in class I\u2019ll call Marcus. He had mirthful eyes, a faint smile, and an air of imperturbable calm\u2014he was at ease with everyone, never visibly agitated or angry. His parents were working-class immigrants from the Caribbean. His father drove a sanitation truck, and his mother was a nanny whose boss had been the one to suggest entering Marcus in the school\u2019s lottery\u2014parents with connections and resources knew about the school, while those without rarely did. Marcus\u2019s mother was a quietly demanding advocate for her son, and Marcus was exactly the kind of kid for whom a good elementary school could mean the chance of a lifetime. His family and ours were separated by race, class, and the dozen city blocks that spell the difference between a neighborhood with tree-lined streets, regular garbage collection, and upscale cupcake shops, and a neighborhood with aboveground power lines and occasional shootings. If not for the school, we would never have known Marcus\u2019s family.\n\nThe boys\u2019 friendship would endure throughout elementary school and beyond. Once, when they were still in kindergarten, my wife was walking with them in a neighborhood of townhouses near the school, and Marcus suddenly exclaimed, \u201cCan you imagine having a backyard?\u201d We had a backyard. Our son kept quiet, whether out of embarrassment or an early intuition that human connections require certain omissions. Marcus\u2019s father would drop him off at our house on weekends\u2014often with the gift of a bottle of excellent rum from his home island\u2014or I would pick Marcus up at their apartment building and drive the boys to a batting cage or the Bronx Zoo. They almost always played at our house, seldom at Marcus\u2019s, which was much smaller. This arrangement was established from the start without ever being discussed. If someone had mentioned it, we would have had to confront the glaring inequality in the boys\u2019 lives. I felt that the friendship flourished in a kind of benign avoidance of this crucial fact. At school our son fell in with a group of boys who had no interest in joining the lunchtime soccer games. Their freewheeling playground scrums often led to good-natured insults, wrestling matches, outraged feelings, an occasional punch, then reconciliation, until the next day. And they were the image of diversity. Over the years, in addition to our son and Marcus, there was another black boy, another white boy, a Latino boy, a mixed-race boy, a boy whose Latino mother was a teacher\u2019s aide at the school, and an African boy with white lesbian parents. A teacher at the private school had once called our son \u201canti-authoritarian,\u201d and it was true: He pursued friends who were mildly rebellious, irritants to the teachers and lunch monitors they didn\u2019t like, and he avoided kids who always had their hand up and displayed obvious signs of parental ambition. The anxious meritocrat in me hadn\u2019t completely faded away, and I once tried to get our son to befriend a 9-year-old who was reading Animal Farm, but he brushed me off. He would do this his own way.\n\nThe school\u2019s pedagogy emphasized learning through doing. Reading instruction didn\u2019t start until the end of first grade; in math, kids were taught various strategies for multiplication and division, but the times tables were their parents\u2019 problem. Instead of worksheets and tests, there were field trips to the shoreline and the Noguchi sculpture museum. \u201cProject-based learning\u201d had our son working for weeks on a clay model of a Chinese nobleman\u2019s tomb tower during a unit on ancient China. Even as we continued to volunteer, my wife and I never stopped wondering if we had cheated our son of a better education. We got antsy with the endless craft projects, the utter indifference to spelling. But our son learned well only when a subject interested him. \u201cI want to learn facts, not skills,\u201d he told his first-grade teacher. The school\u2019s approach\u2014the year-long second-grade unit on the geology and bridges of New York\u2014caught his imagination, while the mix of races and classes gave him something even more precious: an unselfconscious belief that no one was better than anyone else, that he was everyone\u2019s equal and everyone was his. In this way the school succeeded in its highest purpose. And then things began to change. 5. Around 2014, a new mood germinated in America\u2014at first in a few places, among limited numbers of people, but growing with amazing rapidity and force, as new things tend to do today. It rose up toward the end of the Obama years, in part out of disillusionment with the early promise of his presidency\u2014out of expectations raised and frustrated, especially among people under 30, which is how most revolutionary surges begin. This new mood was progressive but not hopeful. A few short years after the teachers at the private preschool had crafted Obama pendants with their 4-year-olds, hope was gone.\n\nAt the heart of the new progressivism was indignation, sometimes rage, about ongoing injustice against groups of Americans who had always been relegated to the outskirts of power and dignity. An incident\u2014a police shooting of an unarmed black man; news reports of predatory sexual behavior by a Hollywood mogul; a pro quarterback who took to kneeling during the national anthem\u2014would light a fire that would spread overnight and keep on burning because it was fed by anger at injustices deeper and older than the inflaming incident. Over time the new mood took on the substance and hard edges of a radically egalitarian ideology. At points where the ideology touched policy, it demanded, and in some cases achieved, important reforms: body cameras on cops, reduced prison sentences for nonviolent offenders, changes in the workplace. But its biggest influence came in realms more inchoate than policy: the private spaces where we think and imagine and talk and write, and the public spaces where institutions shape the contours of our culture and guard its perimeter. Who was driving the new progressivism? Young people, influencers on social media, leaders of cultural organizations, artists, journalists, educators, and, more and more, elected Democrats. You could almost believe they spoke for a majority\u2014but you would be wrong. An extensive survey of American political opinion published last year by a nonprofit called More in Common found that a large majority of every group, including black Americans, thought \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d was a problem. The only exception was a group identified as \u201cprogressive activists\u201d\u2014just 8 percent of the population, and likely to be white, well educated, and wealthy. Other polls found that white progressives were readier to embrace diversity and immigration, and to blame racism for the problems of minority groups, than black Americans were. The new progressivism was a limited, mainly elite phenomenon.\n\nPolitics becomes most real not in the media but in your nervous system, where everything matters more and it\u2019s harder to repress your true feelings because of guilt or social pressure. It was as a father, at our son\u2019s school, that I first understood the meaning of the new progressivism, and what I disliked about it. Every spring, starting in third grade, public-school students in New York State take two standardized tests geared to the national Common Core curriculum\u2014one in math, one in English. In the winter of 2015\u201316, our son\u2019s third-grade year, we began to receive a barrage of emails and flyers from the school about the upcoming tests. They all carried the message that the tests were not mandatory. \u201cInform Yourself!\u201d an email urged us. \u201cWhether or not your child will take the tests is YOUR decision.\u201d During the George W. Bush and Obama presidencies, statewide tests were used to improve low-performing schools by measuring students\u2019 abilities, with rewards (\u201crace to the top\u201d) and penalties (\u201caccountability\u201d) doled out accordingly. These standardized tests could determine the fate of teachers and schools. Some schools began devoting months of class time to preparing students for the tests. The excesses of \u201chigh-stakes testing\u201d inevitably produced a backlash. In 2013, four families at our school, with the support of the administration, kept their kids from taking the tests. These parents had decided that the tests were so stressful for students and teachers alike, consumed so much of the school year with mindless preparation, and were so irrelevant to the purpose of education that they were actually harmful. But even after the city eased the consequences of the tests, the opt-out movement grew astronomically. In the spring of 2014, 250 children were kept from taking the tests.\n\nThe critique widened, too: Educators argued that the tests were structurally biased, even racist, because nonwhite students had the lowest scores. \u201cI believe in assessment\u2014I took tests my whole life and I\u2019ve used assessments as an educator,\u201d one black parent at our school, who graduated from a prestigious New York public high school, told me. \u201cBut now I see it all differently. Standardized tests are the gatekeepers to keep people out, and I know exactly who\u2019s at the bottom. It is torturous for black, Latino, and low-income children, because they will never catch up, due to institutionalized racism.\u201d Our school became the citywide leader of the new movement; the principal was interviewed by the New York media. Opting out became a form of civil disobedience against a prime tool of meritocracy. It started as a spontaneous, grassroots protest against a wrongheaded state of affairs. Then, with breathtaking speed, it transcended the realm of politics and became a form of moral absolutism, with little tolerance for dissent. We took the school at face value when it said that this decision was ours to make. My wife attended a meeting for parents, billed as an \u201ceducation session.\u201d But when she asked a question that showed we hadn\u2019t made up our minds about the tests, another parent quickly tried to set her straight. The question was out of place\u2014no one should want her child to take the tests. The purpose of the meeting wasn\u2019t to provide neutral information. Opting out required an action\u2014parents had to sign and return a letter\u2014and the administration needed to educate new parents about the party line using other parents who had already accepted it, because school employees were forbidden to propagandize.\n\nWe weren\u2019t sure what to do. Instead of giving grades, teachers at our school wrote long, detailed, often deeply knowledgeable reports on each student. But we wanted to know how well our son was learning against an external standard. If he took the tests, he would miss a couple of days of class, but he would also learn to perform a basic task that would be part of his education for years to come. One day I asked another parent whether her son would take the tests. She hushed me\u2014it wasn\u2019t something to discuss at school. Something else about the opt-out movement troubled me. Its advocates claimed that the tests penalized poor and minority kids. I began to think that the real penalty might come from not taking them. Opting out had become so pervasive at our school that the Department of Education no longer had enough data to publish the kind of information that prospective applicants had once used to assess the school. In the category of \u201cStudent Achievement\u201d the department now gave our school \u201cNo Rating.\u201d No outsider could judge how well the school was educating children, including poor, black, and Latino children. The school\u2019s approach left gaps in areas like the times tables, long division, grammar, and spelling. Families with means filled these gaps, as did some families whose means were limited\u2014Marcus\u2019s parents enrolled him in after-school math tutoring. But when a girl at our bus stop fell behind because she didn\u2019t attend school for weeks after the death of her grandmother, who had been the heart of the family, there was no objective measure to act as a flashing red light. In the name of equality, disadvantaged kids were likelier to falter and disappear behind a mist of togetherness and self-deception. Banishing tests seemed like a way to let everyone off the hook. This was the price of dismissing meritocracy.\n\nI took a sounding of parents at our bus stop. Only a few were open to the tests, and they didn\u2019t say this loudly. One parent was trying to find a way to have her daughter take the tests off school grounds. Everyone sensed that failing to opt out would be unpopular with the principal, the staff, and the parent leaders\u2014the school\u2019s power structure. A careful silence fell over the whole subject. One day, while volunteering in our son\u2019s classroom, I asked another parent whether her son would take the tests. She flashed a nervous smile and hushed me\u2014it wasn\u2019t something to discuss at school. One teacher disapproved of testing so intensely that, when my wife and I asked what our son would miss during test days, she answered indignantly, \u201cCurriculum!\u201d Students whose parents declined to opt out would get no preparation at all. It struck me that this would punish kids whom the movement was supposed to protect. If orthodoxy reduced dissenters to whispering\u2014if the entire weight of public opinion at the school was against the tests\u2014then, I thought, our son should take them. The week of the tests, one of the administrators approached me in the school hallway. \u201cHave you decided?\u201d I told her that our son would take the tests. She was the person to whom I\u2019d once written a letter about the ideal match between our values and the school\u2019s, the letter that may have helped get our son off the wait list. Back then I hadn\u2019t heard of the opt-out movement\u2014it didn\u2019t exist. Less than four years later, it was the only truth. I wondered if she felt that I\u2019d betrayed her.\n\nLater that afternoon we spent an hour on the phone. She described all the harm that could come to our son if he took the tests\u2014the immense stress, the potential for demoralization. I replied with our reason for going ahead\u2014we wanted him to learn this necessary skill. The conversation didn\u2019t feel completely honest on either side: She also wanted to confirm the school\u2019s position in the vanguard of the opt-out movement by reaching 100 percent compliance, and I wanted to refuse to go along. The tests had become secondary. This was a political argument. Our son was among the 15 or so students who took the tests. A 95 percent opt-out rate was a resounding success. It rivaled election results in Turkmenistan. As for our son, he finished the tests feeling neither triumphant nor defeated. The issue that had roiled the grown-ups in his life seemed to have had no effect on him at all. He returned to class and continued working on his report about the mountain gorillas of Central Africa. Paul Spella 6. The battleground of the new progressivism is identity. That\u2019s the historical source of exclusion and injustice that demands redress.
