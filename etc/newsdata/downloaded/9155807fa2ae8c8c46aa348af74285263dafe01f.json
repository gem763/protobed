The farm ministry said the damage is estimated at 38.28 billion yen as of Friday morning, up from Thursday's estimate of 24.92 billion yen.\n\nThe figure is expected to increase as there are areas that have yet to be included in the counts, it said.\n\nThe ministry made the estimate based on reports from 34 of the country's 47 prefectures.\n\nAmong the most affected regions, apple and plum orchard farms in the central Japan prefecture of Nagano and northeastern Fukushima were inundated. Livestock and rice farmers were also hit hard in central, eastern and northeastern regions, according to the ministry.\n\nAgriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Minister Taku Eto told reporters he intends to visit disaster-hit areas soon and \"explain relief measures to support reconstruction efforts.\"\n\n\u00a9 KYODO", "description": "Japan's weather agency warned Friday of a secondary disaster in wide areas of the country already flooded by Typhoon Hagibis, as heavy downpours were forecast to hit over the weekend while recovery efforts continue.
