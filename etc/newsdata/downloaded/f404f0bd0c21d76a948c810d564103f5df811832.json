Bananarama, Pontins and the brutally funny dance-off", "language": "en", "text": "Good art often chimes with our own life experiences and gives us cause to reflect on our memories, loves, hopes and fears. But rarely is the connection quite this niche.\n\nIn 1987, a roughly seven-year-old Dan Watson failed to win a dance contest at a Pontins holiday camp. It\u2019s an experience that haunts him, to the extent that, 32 years later, his comedy-dance-theatre show Venus is all about it.\n\nWatching Watson\u2019s show at the Place in London, I felt a spooky sense of deja vu \u2013 and an empathetic bitterness. Because somewhere around the same time, maybe even that same summer, I too entered a holiday camp dance competition and didn\u2019t win. I danced my socks off and my heart out to Rick Astley\u2019s Never Gonna Give You Up, only to place a disappointing second. We were in north Wales. The winner was called Cerys. \u201cThey picked the local girl,\u201d my mum said, kindly.\n\nUntil now, I\u2019d never met anyone who shares this very particular chagrin (although Watson\u2019s 80s pop totem was Bananarama, not Rick Astley): the blow of having your dancefloor joy blemished by a panel of bluecoats. Yet Watson\u2019s show doesn\u2019t come with sourness, but rather with wistful nostalgia and self-reflection, hopeful reinvention, generous spirit and a lot of good jokes.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Hopefu reinvention \u2026 Dan Watson\u2019s Venus. Photograph: Holly Revell\n\nOf course, ironically, Watson did become a dancer (although there\u2019s a good line in the show from his late nan about that), working at the more maverick end of dance and physical theatre with the likes of Gecko, Wendy Houstoun and Nigel Charnock. This lo-fi one-man show is more about the chat than the dance: Watson is great company, full of nervous energy and good humour as he dives back into his Pontins memories. They begin with an unexpected triumph, thrashing obliviously about the stage to the Sweet\u2019s Wig Wam Bam to find himself crowned Cherry Pepsi Disco Winner. His prize was four cans of fizzy pop and a place in the grand finals. But that small victory only leads him to huge disappointment and some brutal lessons about the dance industry, such as the terrifying nature of well-drilled tween girls split-leaping in sparkly Lycra, and the realisation that just being yourself isn\u2019t always good enough.\n\nVenus climaxes by revisiting that fateful night, in a scene that is three and a half minutes of pure joie de vivre. It\u2019s the most winning thing I\u2019ve experienced in a theatre for ages. The question Watson sets himself is whether you can rewrite history and create another version of the past. It\u2019s something that I had already put into practice three decades ago, when it turned out the second place trophy I won wasn\u2019t silver but a smaller version of the winner\u2019s gold one. So when I got home, I just let people think I\u2019d come first. In the interest of an honest victory, though, I would 100% challenge Cerys to a rematch.", "description": "In 1987, Dan Watson\u2019s dance routine failed to nab first prize from a panel of pesky bluecoats.
