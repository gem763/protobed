'We are trying to work something out,' he added.\n\nDowning Street had raised the hopes of the Dunn family, announcing that Mr Johnson had spoken to the President and 'urged him to reconsider the US position' in a phone call.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in Washington overnight, Mr Trump said he had a 'good conversation' with the PM. 'We are trying to work something out,' he added.\n\nHopes raised: Downing Street revealed in a statement last night that Boris Johnson (pictured today) had urged Donald Trump to 'reconsider' over the death of Harry Dunn\n\nDowning Street was today told by ex-diplomat Sir Ivor Roberts that it cannot be 'business as usual' with the US embassy as he suggested Woody Johnson, the US ambassador, could be declared a 'persona non grata'\n\nBut Mr Trump dashed those hopes in a press conference just 46 minutes later on Wednesday night, joking about driving on the wrong side himself and saying: 'It happens'.\n\nTo make matters worse, the President accidentally revealed a briefing note which stated that 'the spouse of the US government employee will not return to the United Kingdom'.\n\nMr Trump was pressed again about the situation as he left Washington DC for a rally in Mineapolis last night.\n\nAsked whether Ms Sacoolas had been spoken to, he said: 'They are in the process of being spoken to...\n\n'I had a conversation with Boris Johnson yesterday, a good one. We are talking about diplomatic immunity, a very interesting situation. We are trying to work something out.'\n\nMinisters have been staying tight-lipped on the row, apparently keen to avoid a public meltdown that could prevent the issue being resolved behind the scenes.\n\nBusiness Secretary Andrea Leadsom, the Dunn family's local MP, tweeted last night that she was 'pleased' the council had agreed to 'extending road signs around the American base, making clear which side of the road to drive on'.\n\nHowever, she has not done any interviews on the subject since Monday.\n\nIn contrast MPs and the family have made no secret of their anger.\n\nLabour's Wes Streeting said of Mr Trump's comments yesterday: 'These are crass and insensitive comments that will inflict further pain and suffering on a grieving family.\n\n'Mrs Sacoolas should return to the UK immediately to provide answers as to what happened to Harry Dunn.\n\n'The Special Relationship between our two countries has been the cornerstone of our mutual defence and prosperity for nearly a century. President Trump continually undermines that relationship.'\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn also took aim at Mr Trump, saying he would 'mount legal action' in the US if he were prime minister.\n\n'For somebody to be killed in our country and the person who did it to flee to the United States and then claim diplomatic immunity is completely unacceptable,' he said.\n\nMr Dunn's family branded the President 'insensitive, clumsy and oafish' and said they were 'horrified by his words'.\n\nHarry Dunn (pictured), 19, was killed n a car crash in Northamptonshire allegedly caused by the wife of an American diplomat\n\nThe parents of Mr Dunn are demanding justice after the suspect, Anne Sacoolas (pictured), claimed diplomatic immunity and was spirited out of Britain after the crash\n\nThe President accidentally revealed a briefing note which stated that 'the spouse of the U.S. government employee will not return to the United Kingdom'\n\nMr Trump's bombshell briefing reveals the US has already told Britain she will not be returned to the UK to face justice\n\nSpeaking to Sky News about the briefing note, which Mr Trump accidentally flashed to cameras, the teenager's mother Charlotte Charles said: 'I'm just disgusted.\n\n'I don't see the point in Boris Johnson talking to President Trump, or President Trump even taking a call from Boris Johnson.\n\n'If he'd already made his decision that if it were to be asked and if it were to be raised, the answer was already going to be no.\n\n'It's just beyond any realm of any human thinking.'\n\nNumber 10 had last night put out a statement, published by the Press Association at 8.38pm, which said the two leaders would 'work together to find a way forward'.\n\n'The Prime Minister urged the President to reconsider the US position so the individual involved can return to the UK, cooperate with police and allow Harry's family to receive justice,' the statement said.\n\nThe President said he was fully aware of the case and deeply saddened by what had happened, and he expressed his condolences to Harry's parents, who are separated.\n\n'The leaders agreed to work together to find a way forward as soon as possible.'\n\nHarry Dunn's mother Charlotte weeps as she and her family speak to the media yesterday\n\nIn Washington, Mr Trump started a wide-ranging press conference at the same moment that the statement appeared.\n\nAt 9.24pm UK time, he was asked about the case and said: 'The woman was driving on the wrong side of the road, and that can happen.\n\n''When you get used to driving on our system and then you're all of a sudden on the other system where you're driving - it happens. You have to be careful, very careful.\n\n'You know, those are the opposite roads, that happens. I won't say it ever happened to me, but it did.'\n\nTraffic drives on the left in Britain and on the right in America.\n\nMr Trump said officials would speak to the driver, 42-year-old Mrs Sacoolas, but reiterated that she had diplomatic immunity.\n\n'So a young man was killed, the person that was driving the automobile has diplomatic immunity, we're going to speak to her very shortly and see if we can do something where they meet,' Mr Trump said.\n\n'It was an accident, it was a terrible accident.'\n\nThe note in his pocket said that U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had already informed Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab that Ms Sacoolas would not return.\n\nMr Dunn's mother said: 'You would hope, being a UK citizen, that they would be the ones to help us as much as possible.\n\n'With Donald Trump saying yesterday that every driver has driven on the wrong side of the road at some point - perhaps they have.\n\nCharlotte Charles (left) and Tim Dunn (right), the parents of Harry Dunn, arrive with their partners at the Foreign Office today ahead of the meeting with the Foreign Secretary\n\nThe crash took place in August outside RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire (pictured) \u2013 a US intelligence hub in Britain\n\n'But not every driver has travelled the distance that Anne Sacoolas did and taken the life of a 19-year-old who was completely and utterly innocent.\n\n'So to us, although it's a personal issue for us, it is more of a unique case than just having accidentally driven on the wrong side of the road so I'm not very happy about those throw-away comments.'\n\nMr Trump has generally enjoyed a warm relationship with Mr Johnson, backing him for the Conservative leadership earlier this year.\n\nThe President called the Tory politician a 'very talented person' and said the former London mayor would do a 'very good job' as Prime Minister.\n\nAs mayor, Mr Johnson had heavily criticised then-candidate Trump in 2015, saying he would not want Londoners to face the 'risk of meeting Donald Trump'.\n\nThe latest diplomatic row has again tested the so-called Special Relationship, a term coined by Winston Churchill.\n\nThe car which crashed into Mr Dunn in August was thought to have been driving on the wrong side of the road after leaving RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire, a military base used by the U.S. Air Force.\n\nMrs Sacoolas, reportedly the wife of a US intelligence official, was granted immunity and flown back to America on a private jet from RAF Mildenhall.\n\nNorthamptonshire Police have also asked the US to consider waiving the diplomatic immunity.\n\nRevealed: Coroner warned 12 years ago about dangers of US service personnel driving on wrong side of road near American airbases in UK after two servicemen died in crash\n\nThe death of Harry Dunn is the fourth fatal crash in recent years where an American living at a RAF base in Britain was driving on the wrong side of the road, MailOnline can reveal today.\n\nAmerican airmen Julious Hawkins, 25, John Biram, 27, and Hunter Davis, also 27, all died after head-on smashes near RAF Lakenheath and RAF Mildenhall in Suffolk.\n\nThe county's coroner was so worried he wrote to US air force chiefs warning them to 'learn lessons' urgently after Mr Hawkins drove the wrong way down a dual carriageway for 13 miles while drunk before he smashed into an oncoming lorry in 2007.\n\nDr Peter Dean told MailOnline today the road deaths dating back 12 years have chilling similarities to the August crash where US spy's wife Anne Sacoolas allegedly killed Harry Dunn before fleeing the country claiming diplomatic immunity.\n\nHe said: 'This new case involves a young man who had his whole life in front of him. I feel for him and his family. I hope there will be a resolution for them. This tragedy shows that a moment's inattention can have devastating and life-changing consequences'.\n\nStaff Sergeant Hunter Davis died in a head-on crash near his Suffolk airbase after sending text while driving in 2016. Brit David Rolfe (right) also died in a crash involving an American serviceman\n\nHarry, 19, was killed in a car crash in Northamptonshire six weeks ago allegedly caused by diplomat's wife Anne Sacoolas who then fled the country\n\nExplaining why he wrote the US Air Force in Suffolk in 2007 he said: 'I was trying to raise awareness that it is a real problem after two people died having driven on the wrong side of the road.\n\nFormer Suffolk coroner Dr Peter Dean, who presided over two cases involving US airmen, wrote to US Air Force chiefs urging them to 'learn lessons'\n\n'If it is the case [as Trump says] that this driver was on the wrong side of the road I can really believe that. If you are focussed on something else, tired, it can be easy for a driver used to the other side of the road to drift there. The tragedy is that every now and again it happens'.\n\nAnne Sacoolas allegedly hit 19-year-old motorcyclist Harry Dunn with her Volvo SUV outside a US spy station in Northamptonshire after driving on the wrong side of the road for up to 400 yards on August 27.\n\nDays later she was spirited from UK soil on a state-sponsored private jet from RAF Mildenhall, protected by her husband Jonathan's diplomatic immunity.\n\nMailOnline has uncovered a string of similar cases today.\n\nIn 2007 Julious Hawkins, 25, from RAF Mildenhall, died in a crash with a lorry after travelling 12 miles westbound on the eastbound carriageway of the A14 at 70mph at 3am.\n\nTests after his death revealed he had 'pre-coma' levels of alcohol in his blood. He had also taken sleeping tablets.\n\nThree months later fellow serviceman John Biram, 27, from RAF Lakenheath, died in a head-on smash near Newmarket race course. He was also drunk and driving on the wrong side of the road.\n\nIn the same year 56 Suffolk-based US personnel appeared at Sudbury Magistrates' Court - the court local to the bases - in just one day to face speeding charges.\n\nIn 2016 RAF Mildenhall airman Staff Sergeant Hunter Davis, 27, died after drifting on to the wrong side of the road. An investigation found the most likely cause of the three car collision was a loss of concentration due to the use of a mobile phone.\n\nThe 352d Special Operations Wing held a memorial at RAF Mildenhall on June 20 to say goodbye to SSgt Hunter Daviswho lost his life in a tragic vehicle accident after sending a text while driving\n\nAnne Sacoolas (left, and pictured right on her wedding day in 2003) was travelling on the wrong side of the road for 400 yards before hitting him head-on, Harry Dunn's heartbroken parents claim\n\nIn a similar case in 2013 a USAF Staff Sergeant was banned from driving after causing a head-on crash which resulted in the death of 75-year-old local man David Rolfe.\n\nCandice Griffin, who had only been in the UK for two months, failed to see on an approaching car when she pulled out from an exit at RAF Mildenhall. That collision pushed the Peugeot into the path of a Mazda being driven by Mr Rolfe, who suffered fatal chest and neck injuries.\n\nGriffin denied she was on the wrong side of the road - but admitted she had looked in both directions before beginning her move out of the airbase road but failed to look right for a second time.\n\nThis week Irving Berlin's granddaughter was spared jail after she caused a head-on crash that killed a pensioner while holidaying in Scotland.\n\nAmerican Caroline Emmet, who lives in Paris, was driving on the wrong side of the road when her vehicle smashed into a car in which Elizabeth Henderson, 83, was a passenger.\n\nThe accident happened on the A198 in East Lothian on July 19, 2017. Mrs Henderson died two days later in Edinburgh Royal Infirmary.\n\nAt the High Court in Edinburgh yesterday, Lord Glennie deferred sentence until November next year after Emmet agreed to carry out 500 hours of unpaid work in France, where she lives. He also banned her from driving for three years.\n\nDonald Trump has upset Harry's family and British road safety campaigners he defended the wife of a US spy who killed him while driving on the wrong side of the road.\n\nMr Trump then said: 'Those are the opposite roads. That can happen. I won't say it ever happened to me, but it did. It happens. You have to be careful.'\n\nThe Dunn family called his words 'oafish, insulting and inflammatory'.\n\nNeil Greig, Director at safety charity IAM RoadSmart said: 'It is important that anyone who is driving in a new country takes steps to familiarise themselves with the road conditions and regulations. In areas with high numbers of visitors we would support extra signposting'.\n\nThe US Air Force insists they give servicemen and women 'stringent' training about driving in the UK.\n\nOn top of its two-hour local road conditions course on arrival, there is a additional refresher course that all drivers under the age of 26 must complete within their first year there.", "description": "Sir Ivor Roberts, a former UK ambassador in Dublin, said Number 10 should consider telling Woody Johnson that he is no longer welcome in Britain unless the White House changes course.", "authors": ["Jack Maidment", "Deputy Political Editor For Mailonline", "James Tapsfield", "Mailonline Political Editor"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/14/19588486-0-image-a-24_1570799027321.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
