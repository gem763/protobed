In an August 26th letter, Atkinson said the officer was found to have harbored \u201cpolitical bias\u201d in favor of a rival political candidate to President Trump. York\u2019s report contradicts a claim by CNN anchor Jake Tapper, who stated last week that the so-called \u201cwhistleblower\u2019s\u201d political bias was that he was a \u201cregistered Democrat.\u201d\n\nThe officer\u2019s alleged political bias isn\u2019t the only glaring issue with his complaint. Last week, Fox News reported the anonymous Deep Stater concealed his communications with a House Intelligence Committee aide from Atkinson, who told lawmakers he possessed \u201cno knowledge\u201d of the officer\u2019s contacts with the Capitol Hill staffer. As Breitbart News reported, the development suggests the officer failed to follow the law for protecting intelligence community members seeking to report alleged wrongdoing.\n\nThe Trump-Zelensky call sparked House Democrats to launch a so-called impeachment inquiry into the president \u2014 despite the fact that the two have both denied any pressure was applied to investigate the Biden family. In a nod to transparency, the White House released a transcript of the call to illustrate no wrongdoing took place.\n\n\u201d I think you read everything. I think you read text. I\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t want to be involved to democratic open elections, elections of USA. No, sure, we had I think good phone call. It was normal. We spoke about many things, and I \u2014 so I think and you read it that nobody pushed me,\u201d Zelensky told reporters at the United Nations earlier this month.\n\nHowever, questions still remain about Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings in Ukraine and China and whether he benefited personally while his father was vice president. As Breitbart News reported, Hunter Biden\u2019s investment firm secured a $1.5 billion investment deal with the Bank of China after traveling with his father on Air Force Two to the country in 2013. In regard to Ukraine, Hunter Biden was paid $83,000 per month as a board member of the gas giant Burisma Holdings, despite having little-to-no expertise in the energy sector. The vice president forced out former Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin as he was investigating Burisma Holdings and even bragged about threatening to withhold $1 billion in aid to Ukraine unless he was fired.\n\nSpeaking to reporters outside the White House last week, President Trump suggested China and Ukraine should investigate the Biden family\u2019s business dealings.\n\n\u201cChina should start an investigation into the Bidens, because what happened in China is just about as bad as Ukraine,\u201d the president said ahead of a visit to Florida to deliver remarks on Medicare.\n\n\u201cI would think that if they were honest about it, they would start a major investigation,\u201d he added. \u201cNobody has any doubt that they weren\u2019t crooked; that was a crooked deal, 100 percent.\u201d", "description": "Testimony alleges the so-called Ukraine \"whistleblower\" had a previous \"professional relationship\" with a 2020 Democrat candidate.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/AP_19256002885874-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
