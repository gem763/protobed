Investigators at the Oregon Health Authority Public Health Division said Tuesday that they received reports that the person who died in July had recently used a vaping device containing cannabis bought from an Oregon store.\n\nOfficials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said they are looking at 215 possible cases across 25 states. All the cases involve teens or adults who have used e-cigarettes or other vaping devices. Symptoms of the disease include coughing, shortness of breath, chest pain, fatigue, nausea and vomiting.\n\nThe Oregon Health Authority did not say the age or gender of the person who died, CBS affiliate KOIN reports.\n\nPublic health physician Ann Thomas says investigators don't yet know whether the illnesses are caused by contaminants, ingredients in the liquid or something such as the device itself. Officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last week recommended that people who vape consider avoiding e-cigarettes while they investigate.\n\nDoctor on vaping: \"Nobody is saying that this has value or benefit\" for youths\n\nThe death comes less than two weeks after Illinois health officials said that a patient who contracted a serious lung disease after vaping died, which may have marked the first death in the U.S. linked to the smoking alternative.\n\nSickened individuals experienced symptoms including shortness of breath, cough and chest pain.\n\nLast week, an 18-year-old told CBS News that his lung collapsed after vaping. Chance Ammirata, who had never been a traditional smoker, said he started using Juul e-cigarettes a year and a half ago, when he was 16. He now believes Juuls caused his lung injury.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with \"CBS This Morning's\" Tony Dokoupil, Juul CEO Kevin Burns said the company never intended for Juul to be used by kids or teenagers.\n\n\"As a parent of a 16-year-old, 19-year-old, I don't want my kids using the product. It's not intended for them,\" he said.", "description": "Oregon health officials say they are investigating the death of a person who had severe respiratory illness after using an e-cigarette", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/10/06/97b27c76-934e-49fa-8435-751762f2832c/thumbnail/1200x630/da4613961061c392cf7a26c766e09532/vaping-exhale-620.jpg"}
