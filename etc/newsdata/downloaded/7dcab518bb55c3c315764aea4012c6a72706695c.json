I have no doubt that he will thoughtfully lead BP through the transition to a low carbon future.\"\n\nNEAR BUST TO BOOM\n\nDudley will step down as CEO after the company's full-year results on February 4 2020 and will retire on March 31, BP said.\n\nHe was appointed to the top job in 2010 following the Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nDudley led the company through near-bankruptcy after it caused the largest oil spill in U.S. history and through an oil price crash four years later.\n\nPreparations for Dudley's departure were accelerated after Helge Lund became BP chairman in January with a mandate to oversee succession plans.\n\nDudley succeeded Tony Hayward who stepped down in the wake of the April 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster that left 11 rig workers dead.\n\nHe has had to navigate a vast asset disposal to pay for more than $60 billion in litigation and clean-up costs followed by a landmark settlement with U.S. authorities.\n\nHe has also overseen BP's efforts to address growing investor pressure to meet targets under the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement to fight climate change by investing in renewable energy and reducing BP's carbon emissions.\n\n\"As the company charts its course through the energy transition this is a logical time for a change,\" Lund said in a statement.\n\nDudley has enjoyed overwhelming support from investors at BP's annual general meetings, however a majority of shareholders opposed his 2016 pay package, forcing the company to slash it by 40%.", "description": "BP names Bernard Looney as next CEO, Dudley to leave in 2020", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF930IG_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
