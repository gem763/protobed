According to these specialists, their specific brand of holistic BDSM has helped clients with a range of emotional issues from trauma to anxiety.\n\nLondon-based Lorelei set up her own business as the Divine Theratrix in September 2018 after two years working as a therapeutic counsellor. Marketing herself as a \u2018loving female authority\u2019, Lorelei uses BDSM components such as restraint and impact play (rhythmic hitting) to enable her clients to open up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLorelei, 33, tells Metro.co.uk: \u2018The first time I introduced BDSM to a therapy session, the client progressed more in two hours than they usually would in two months of traditional counselling. Having your physical presence is so powerful.\u2019\n\nLorelei began to explore BDSM therapy after becoming frustrated by the rigid detachment she has to retain during traditional counselling sessions.\n\n\u2018I was struggling with the barrier,\u2019 she explains. \u2018I thought \u201cChrist if I could actually have contact with clients, I know it would make a difference to them\u201d.\u2019\n\nLorelei, 33, is a BDSM therapist who became frustrated with the detachment required in more traditional treatments (Picture: Amorata Photography)\n\nThe former lawyer became involved with BDSM while exploring her own sexuality at sex parties and was particularly drawn to the role of a dominant. Lorelei looks entirely unimposing, with a youthful, elfin face and a petite frame clothed in black trousers and a lacy black top. Despite her delicate appearance and obvious warmth, Lorelei has a certain air of command; a no-nonsense kind of confidence that one can imagine her using to great effect in her work.\n\nHaving gained her diploma in therapeutic counselling, Lorelei was struck by the similarities between BDSM and conventional therapy. A BDSM session with her is broken down into three main parts, which are holding (establishing the power dynamic and trust), opening and then putting back together again, which could easily describe a formalised counselling session.\n\nBut unlike standard psychoanalysis where everything is achieved through talking, Lorelei will apply physical and occasionally painful actions such as nipple tweaking or flogging to facilitate the different stages. This is always a detailed conversation about the client\u2019s limits and session goals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe also holds her \u00a3200 per hour sessions in a rented dungeon while garbed in classic fetish wear, which Lorelei explains reinforces the power balance and takes clients outside of their daily reality.\n\nLorelei tells us: \u2018I deal with a lot of clients who have a lot of early trauma, which is incredibly difficult to shift because it\u2019s in your primal brain, which predates any cognitive thought processes.\n\n\u2018I know from personal experience that these feelings can be very overwhelming and they need to come out. In this setup, clients know that because I am completely in control, they can totally let go and I will be there to make sure they feel safe and feel held.\n\n\u2018Just because I\u2019m a dominant doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t be nurturing.\u2019\n\nBecause of its reliance upon specific power roles, anticipation and the relinquishing of control, BDSM is an inherently psychological practice. But how does a BDSM healer make emotional catharsis and not sexual gratification the primary goal of a session?\n\nNew York based Aleta Cai tells us: \u2018Making sure that client understand what they want to achieve through a session is key. I make it very clear that healing and self-actualisation are the primary objectives of my sessions.\u2019\n\nAleta Cai combines reiki with restraint (Picture: Cory Rice)\n\nAleta practices what she describes as Sacred BDSM which combines new age modalities such as reiki and clairvoyance with traditional BDSM devices, including sensory deprivation and restraint. A self-described empath, Aleta explained that the BDSM template allows clients to access a deeper level of surrender.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I feel that in the West, there is a focus on psychoanalysis and probing the rational mind, which can lead to people getting stuck in their own narratives,\u2019 Aleta says. \u2018Things may be alerted to the rational mind that the body needs to process, and BDSM can facilitate that processing.\u2019\n\nBorn in China, Aleta moved to Los Angeles during infancy and has retained her tinkling LA inflection. However, the 29-year-old speaks in a slow, measured manner which demands full attention. After completing her degree in Psychology at NYU, Aleta worked as a professional dominatrix at a well-known BDSM dungeon for two years.\n\nHer transition towards Sacred BDSM began three years ago. The turning point came during a standard mummification session (this process involves being wrapped up like its Egyptian cadaver\u2019s namesake) where Aleta introduced crystals and healing energy devices to the process.\n\nAleta said: \u2018I was amazed, in just 20 minutes I felt the client\u2019s different energies being unblocked and the immense sense of release he experienced. That\u2019s what began my journey towards introducing certain elements into my own healing work.\u2019\n\nThe reiki master also runs what she calls a \u2018vanilla\u2019 healing practice alongside her multiple artistic projects. Spirituality informs both practitioners\u2019 work, with Lorelei being inspired largely by branches of matriarchal mysticism and paganism while Aleta is particularly influenced by Eastern medicine and esoteric theologies.\n\nAleta says: \u2018My intention is to maximise their healing through BDSM so for instance if I felt someone\u2019s root chakra is very heavy, I would cane them repetitively until I saw a somatic relief in that chakra. If I mummify someone, I will take them into hypnosis which will allow them a deeper layer of catharsis that is not just the physicality of being wrapped up.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe concept of accessing a kind of heightened consciousness through BDSM makes sense scientifically as pain triggers adrenaline and endorphins which can lead to feelings of euphoria. For this to be experienced in a therapeutic and emotionally releasing manner is mostly dependent upon how the activity is framed.\n\nSeani Love said: \u2018A lot of BDSM does involve some level of therapy anyway, because sexuality is humanity\u2019s inherent driving force. But when you outline the BDSM experience as an emotionally healing practice, it involves all aspects of the person making the release not only psychological, but also emotional, physical and spiritual.\u2019\n\nThe Australian native applies a variety of disciplines to his BDSM work, including Pagan ritual and Qigong, in what he describes as a \u2018hodgepodge of healing practices\u2019.\n\nThe former software engineer began working part-time as a Shamanic BDSM practitioner eight years ago, finally going full time in 2013. Seani now prefers the title of sex worker and has won awards for his travail, which earn him \u00a3390 for a three hour booking. However, the 49-year-old still runs sessions and workshops specializing in Conscious Kink and BDSM therapy. It was Seani who personally mentored Lorelei while she was deciding what path she would take.\n\nAt the start of our meeting Seani seems slightly nervous; softly spoken and prone to fidgeting. As the interview gets further underway he seems to relax a little, obviously passionate about the remedial aspects of his work. When asked about his greatest achievement during his BDSM therapy career, Seani describes an intense experience with a 65-year-old client who had been rejected by his mother after being dropped on his head.\n\n\u2018I called in a female assistant so he could experience some maternal love in his body during the session,\u2019 Seani tells us. \u2018We retraced some particular steps, used some impact play to get him out of his head and got him back to that pre-verbal stage, then invited the assistant to hold and nurture him. It was so powerful; he finally found peace with his mother from the ritual we created.\u2019\n\nSeani also has a background in gestalt therapy and a level 3 diploma in counselling, but has found his particular therapeutic niche within the erotic and BDSM sphere. While he has helped many people through applied BDSM, he is quick to state that it isn\u2019t the right path for everyone.\n\n\u2018I think it\u2019s important for me to say that I wouldn\u2019t prescribe shamanic BDSM as a healing path for all people,\u2019 he notes. \u2018I would never directly recommend it, but if people are drawn to it, it\u2019s available.\u2019\n\nAt first glance, BDSM therapy seems contradictory. Alleviating emotional distress with physical pain seems illogical, even detrimental. But when done skilfully, this practice enables the expression of raw emotion, without rationalisation or any holding back from the client.\n\nPeople have turned to primal scream sessions, isolation tanks and rebirthing therapy in pursuit of emotional balance and found such practices effective. With mental health conditions making up 28% of the NHS\u2019s total burden, perhaps for some select people, an overtly physical approach could provide the release that is so desperately needed.\n\nNeed support?
