It is generally accepted that if you offer a footballer an excuse, they will take it and the notion of a club being in transition fits the description.\n\nRebuilding or transition suggests that things will improve gradually, eventually, at some unspecified point in the future. But as for the here and now, there can be bumps along the road \u2013 which is the phrase that Solskj\u00e6r used after West Ham. They must be tolerated, accepted. And, by that measure, it is no great leap to see the situation as working to lessen competitive edges, to allow for drift.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nIt is not a direct analogy but remember what happened when Sir Alex Ferguson announced at the beginning of the 2001-02 season that he would step down as the United manager at the end of the campaign? In Ferguson\u2019s own words, a lot of the players \u201cput their tools away\u201d. He would change his mind midway though the season and stay.\n\nOle Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r defends United players and rues missed \u2018big chances\u2019 Read more\n\nUnited are drifting and Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s honeymoon period, which peaked with the 3-1 Champions League win at Paris St-Germain last March, a night of miracles when anything seemed possible, has come to feel like a long time ago. When United triumphed that night, Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s record in all competitions read: W14 D2 L1. And the defeat was in the first leg against PSG.\n\nSince then, it has been five wins, four draws and 10 defeats in all competitions while in the Premier League it is W4 D4 L7 \u2013 or 16 points from 15 games. Transpose that across a 38-game season and it makes 40.5 points. It is practically relegation form.\n\nThousands of Twitter users laughed at the clip from the West Ham game that went viral. It appeared to show the defender Phil Jones, who was in the stands having been excluded from the squad, murmuring along with a chorus from the West Ham fans about Solskj\u00e6r being \u201csacked in the morning\u201d. The executive vice-chairman, Ed Woodward, turns around and seems to mouth: \u201cWe\u2019re on camera. Stop.\u201d\n\nGarwain (@Garwain) Phil Jones : sacked in the morning\n\nEd Woodward : we\u2019re on camera, stop\n\n\ud83d\ude02pic.twitter.com/OhYvjoN3pT\n\nThe true context is difficult to know but it did not look good and chimed with the overall impression of disarray, which had been pronounced when Marcus Rashford had to go off with a groin strain and Solskj\u00e6r looked at his options on the bench. Anthony Martial was missing with a thigh problem while the 17-year-old Mason Greenwood had not travelled because of tonsillitis. There was nothing else to do but send on the attacking midfielder Jesse Lingard and ask him to play as a false nine.\n\nIt was easy to link Rashford\u2019s injury to his game time for the club this season. The striker had sat out only five minutes in all competitions and he was pressed through all 90 of the Europa League tie against Astana at Old Trafford last Thursday.\n\nPremier League: 10 talking points from the weekend\u2019s action Read more\n\nIt has not taken an injury crisis to show up United\u2019s lack of high-grade options. With only Paul Pogba missing in midfield, Solskj\u00e6r started with Nemanja Matic, Scott McTominay and Juan Mata. Would any of the trio get into West Ham\u2019s first-choice lineup ahead of Declan Rice, Mark Noble and Manuel Lanzini?\n\nRecruitment has been a major shortcoming at United for a number of years and the positive reading of Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s rebuilding comment is that he is only telling the truth. The summer was the first opportunity for him to begin to put his mark on the squad, given the vagaries of the January window, and the additions of Harry Maguire, Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Daniel James represented steps in the right direction.\n\nConsider the outgoing business. United sold Marouane Fellaini in January and, over the summer, they moved on Antonio Valencia, Chris Smalling, Matteo Darmian, Ander Herrera, Alexis S\u00e1nchez and Romelu Lukaku. It was hard to argue with the reasons for parting with each one yet it added up to a clearout and, in some positions, left Solskj\u00e6r slightly short in terms of bodies.\n\nQuick guide Follow Guardian sport on social media Show Hide Twitter: follow us at @guardian_sport Facebook: like our football and sport pages Instagram: our favourite photos, films and stories YouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channels Photograph: Chesnot/Getty Images Europe\n\nThe renewal process has further ground to cover, with more unwanted players to shift and fresh quality needed. It will take time, at least another summer or two, and the difficulties of making top-class signings while United are a Europa League-level club ought not to be underestimated.\n\nUnited have eight points from their opening six league matches, which is the same number as Tottenham and Chelsea, but the sense of angst at Old Trafford feels more acute; the spotlight on Solskj\u00e6r more unforgiving. Perhaps it is because of the credit that Mauricio Pochettino has built at Spurs and the fact that Frank Lampard has just started his managerial project at Chelsea.\n\nSome fans have started to question whether Solskj\u00e6r is the right man to oversee the United rebuild. The dangers and realities he faces are plain.", "description": "The manager\u2019s honeymoon period is over and the defeat at West Ham demonstrated their lack of high-grade options again", "authors": ["David Hytner"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b99e8035b1d1e4b01955d876bcb5043220fe1d08/0_188_1522_913/master/1522.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6c6052270e25f03c81b6c55868b1fc5b", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
