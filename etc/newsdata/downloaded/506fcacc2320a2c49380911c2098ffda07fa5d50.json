Rwanda has also offered to take in evacuees, which Avramopoulos welcomed.\n\nAccording to the United Nations refugee agency, 14 countries \u2014 including 10 EU member states \u2014 have pledged some 6,600 resettlement places for those evacuated from Libya to Niger as of August. But resettlement has progressed slowly, NGOs reported earlier this year.\n\n\"We must make resettlement a priority if we want to support partner countries that have taken in refugees,\"Avramopoulos said. \"That's also important to provide refugees who want to go to Europe with safe routes, so that they no longer have to fall back on dangerous and illegal sea and land routes.\"\n\nHe added that overall, some 35,000 refugees had been resettled to the EU from third countries over the past two years.\n\n\"This is more than ever before,\" Avramopoulos said. \"But we must not become complacent. Resettlement should become the most important route to entering the European Union for those in need of protection.\"", "description": "Dimitris Avramopoulos urged member states to take in refugees evacuated from Libya in particular.", "authors": ["Jillian Deutsch", "Cristina Gallardo", "Madeleine Speed"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/GettyImages-909521280-1-1200x628.jpg"}
