It was ugly, and Democrats and Republicans traded vicious words.\n\nBut Clinton never publicly accused his detractors of treason or floated the idea that one of them be arrested on those grounds, as Donald Trump just did with Adam Schiff.\n\nClinton and his defenders raised the specter of a \u201cvast right-wing conspiracy,\u201d to use Hillary Clinton\u2019s infamous phrase, thus asserting that he was being persecuted for his politics, not punished for his misdeeds.\n\nBut they didn\u2019t insist, as Trump and his defenders routinely do, that a vital part of the federal government was an evil cabal intent on undermining our democratic processes, which is Trump\u2019s self-serving characterization of the intelligence community. Their central strategy wasn\u2019t to ignite a full-blown crisis of confidence in the institutions of government. They weren\u2019t serving dire notice, as Trump essentially is, that if the president goes down, he\u2019s taking everyone and everything else with him.\n\nGallery: Donald Trump's life in pictures (Photos)\n\nThe Clintons possessed and projected a moral arrogance that was laughably oxymoronic under the circumstances. And they and other prominent Democrats junked the party\u2019s supposed concern for women\u2019s empowerment to savage Monica Lewinsky, Paula Jones and others who came forward with claims about the president\u2019s extramarital sexual activity, including serious accusations of sexual violence.\n\nBut they didn\u2019t equate the potential fall of the president with the fall of the Republic. They didn\u2019t go full apocalypse. Bill Clinton didn\u2019t prophesy that his impeachment would lead to a kind of \u201ccivil war\u201d from which the country would \u201cnever heal,\u201d as Trump did by tweeting an evangelical pastor\u2019s comments on Fox News along those lines.\n\nI wrote last week that the prospect of Trump\u2019s impeachment terrified me, and one of the main reasons I cited was what we\u2019re seeing now: his histrionic response, which is untethered from any sense of honor, civic concern or real patriotism.\n\n\u00a9 AP President Donald Trump speaks during an Armed Forces welcome ceremony for the new chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n\nHe\u2019s not like most of his predecessors in the White House, who had some limits, at least a few scruples and the capacity to feel shame. Their self-pity wasn\u2019t this unfathomably deep, their delusions of martyrdom this insanely grand. \u201cThere has been no President in the history of our Country who has been treated so badly as I have,\u201d he tweeted last week, and the violins have wailed only louder and weepier since.\n\nWhile there were fellow narcissists among his forebears, was there a single nihilist like Trump? I doubt it, and so the current waters are in fact uncharted, because the ship of state has a sort of madman at its helm.\n\nThat he\u2019s fighting back by impugning his critics\u2019 motives, stonewalling investigators and carping about the media shouldn\u2019t disturb anyone, not if we\u2019re being grown-ups. Richard Nixon, confronted with his impeachment, thrashed and seethed. Clinton assembled a war room in an effort to outwit his adversaries. That\u2019s the nature of politics. That\u2019s the right of the accused.\n\nBut in the mere week since a formal impeachment inquiry was announced, Trump has already gone much farther than that and behaved in ways that explode precedent, offend decency and boggle the mind. We\u2019re fools if we don\u2019t brace for more and worse.\n\nFor grotesque example, he has suggested \u2014 repeatedly \u2014 that government officials who tattled about his crooked conversation with the Ukrainian president are spies who deserve to be executed. Had any other president done that, many Americans would speak of nothing else for the next month.\n\n\u00a9 AP The White House is under siege.\n\nBut from Trump, such a horror wasn\u2019t even surprising, and it competed for attention with so many other outrages that it was dulled, the way so much of his unconscionable behavior is. When you churn out a disgrace a minute and no one expects anything nobler, you\u2019re inoculated by your own awfulness.\n\nHe has taken his vilification of the media to new depths, content on this front, as on others, to pump Americans full of a toxic cynicism so long as he profits from it. He and his handmaidens have disseminated distortion after distortion, lie upon lie, including the claim that deep-state officials tweaked the criteria for whistle-blowers just so that someone could ensnare him.\n\nThey have instructed Americans not to believe their own eyes, their own ears, their own intelligence. They mean to put truth itself up for grabs, no matter the fallout.\n\nLindsey Graham, the sycophant of the century, called the whistle-blower\u2019s complaint a setup, as if it didn\u2019t rest on the sturdy foundation of a reconstructed transcript \u2014 released by the White House \u2014 that shows Trump imploring a foreign leader to do political dirty work for him.\n\nTrump keeps saying it was a \u201cperfect\u201d call, which is like seeing Dom P\u00e9rignon in a puddle of sewage. Then again, his presidency has long depended on such optical illusions.\n\nThere\u2019s light, though, and it\u2019s this: As corrosive as his as tirades are, they may also be what does him in. He\u2019s poised to take this persecution complex too far.\n\nAlready, there has been a swell of support for impeachment, according to new polls released by CNN and Monmouth University, and I bet that trend continues as revelations of his wrongdoing cascade and as he wildly overreacts.\n\nThat probably wouldn\u2019t be enough to get Republican senators to convict him and remove him from office, should the House follow through with impeachment and a Senate trial ensue. But it would affect November 2020.\n\nHe\u2019s in a bind, because his burn-down-the-house defense against impeachment makes the best case that he must be impeached \u2014 that a leader with no bounds and no bottom can\u2019t be allowed to rage on unimpeded. The impeachment inquiry is laying Trump bare. As scary as that is for us, it may be even scarier for him.\n\nI invite you to sign up for my free weekly email newsletter.
