Kamala Harris (D-CA) engaged in \u201creal talk\u201d with a crowd at a town hall event on Thursday and asked if America is ready for her presidency, to which some replied with an emphatic, \u201cNo!\u201d\n\nA clip of the town hall event in Reno, Nevada, surfaced on Thursday, showing Kamala Harris attempting to relate to the crowd with a bit of \u201creal talk.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m at the stage of the campaign where I\u2019m kind of like, you know, I\u2019m just gonna gauge a real talk. I don\u2019t want to waste your time with anything else,\u201d the presidential candidate said. \u201cLet\u2019s just have some real talk.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo real talk. In this election in the last kind of couple \u2014 I mean, maybe a couple months, certainly few weeks \u2014 there\u2019s this whole conversation that\u2019s been coming up about electability, focused on our campaign,\u201d Harris said.\n\n\u201cIs America ready for that?\u201d she asked, to which some in the crowd shouted, \u201cNo!\u201d\n\nTheir response appeared to take Harris by surprise, and she responded with a quick, \u201cWell, yes they are\u201d:\n\nWhile it is possible \u2014 and likely, even \u2014 that certain members of the crowd misheard Harris. The awkward moment is emblematic of the presidential hopeful\u2019s overall struggle to break through with voters and re-emerge at the top of the Democrat field.\n\nThe current Real Clear Politics average shows Harris in fifth place with 4.8 percent support nationally.", "description": "Sen.
