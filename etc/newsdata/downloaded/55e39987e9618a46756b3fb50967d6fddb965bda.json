Standing alongside him, Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Lofven said a deal was possible, but question marks remained around the U.K.s plan.\n\nThe Northern Irish Veto That Could Torpedo Johnsons Brexit Plan", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Follow @Brexit\u00a0and\u00a0sign up to our Brexit Bulletin.\u00a0Boris Johnson is winning the battle for Conservative support after outlining his new Brexit proposals in Parliament.
