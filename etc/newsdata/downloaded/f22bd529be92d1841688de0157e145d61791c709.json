Those who suffered from my decisions are now trying to drag me down with accusations of corruption.\u201d\n\nThe Central Bank, he insisted, had no control over the private bank accounts of government members. \u201cThe Central Bank does not handle private accounts. I do not have this privilege. The banks should know their clients and report to us if they see something suspicious.\u201d\n\nAs for the supposedly lavish Cannes wedding, the focus of much ire, Salameh said it took place overseas because his son, a Christian, wed a Muslim and it was easier to have a civil marriage in France. \u201cIt was just a normal dinner,\u201d he said.\n\nSalameh was clearly worried. He said he had no idea how the confrontation would end. Small and medium-size enterprises make up most of the Lebanese economy, and for now they have no income, with the country paralyzed . \u201cThe solution is not a violent one,\u201d he told me. \u201cYou need to regenerate confidence.\u201d\n\nI asked if he would quit. \u201cIf it serves the country, but I think it may have the opposite effect, in terms of the confidence of markets.\u201d He paused. \u201cLook, if I am the problem, you can consider it solved. But mobilizing by identifying capital and money as the enemy is not the way forward. We need to build the state and build an economy that has growth.\u201d", "description": "The Middle East could use a decent country. One million Lebanese protesters are demanding one.
