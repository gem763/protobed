She has three children, Jordan, 23, Amber, 20, and Jade, 30, and two granddaughters, aged three and one.\n\nSOLO SPA SESSION\n\nEvery fortnight, I spend an hour at the spa in my local David Lloyd club. I love the relaxation room, which has low lighting and foam beds \u2014 I often fall asleep there! Afterwards, I sit in the steam and sauna rooms with an Elemis Fruit Active Rejuvenating Mask on my face (\u00a328.80, amazon.co.uk). It uses strawberry and kiwi extracts to hydrate skin. I end with the icy dipping pool and Jacuzzi. This stops me taking other people\u2019s stresses home from work.\n\nTracy Belinda, 53, (pictured) from Berkshire, reveals how using a moisturiser with UV protection combined with spa treatments helps to maintain her ageless appearance\n\nMULTI-TASKING SPF\n\nMy mum taught me never to go out without first applying moisturiser. I wear Obagi Medical Sun Shield Tint SPF 50 (\u00a364, crewehairandskinclinic.uk). A friend recommended it to help with sun spots. It\u2019s worth investing in quality UV protection, and this lasts all year. I wear it instead of foundation as it\u2019s tinted.\n\nBLAZE FITNESS CLASS\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve found it harder to stay in shape, especially around my stomach, so now I do five exercise classes per week. My favourites are HIIT (high-intensity interval training), where you do 30 seconds on, then 30 seconds off; and Blaze, where the aim is to hit the \u2018red zone\u2019. You have to wear a heart-rate monitor to track your progress, and the results are put up on a screen in front of everyone \u2014 which is great motivation.\n\nLIFE-CHANGING HRT\n\nLast year, I went on HRT after reading an interview with Carol Vorderman, who spoke about how it helped ease her menopause symptoms: mood swings and sleeplessness. Before this, I\u2019d struggled with natural methods and had a breakdown because I wasn\u2019t sleeping. Now I use an oestrogen patch \u2014 and I\u2019ve never felt better. Within a week, I had more energy, a boosted libido and no hot flushes. I feel like I\u2019m 30 again!\n\nMOBILE BEAUTY THERAPY\n\nOnce a month, I have an amazing beauty therapist come to my house. She starts with an ESPA facial (\u00a330) \u2014 I\u2019ve had these regularly since I was 19 \u2014 then I get a back massage and Indian head massage (both \u00a340), plus aromatherapy (\u00a340) to de-stress. It all takes two hours.\n\nDo you look good for your age?
