They fired rubber bullets and tear gas canisters, dispersing demonstrators in Beirut\u2019s commercial district. Dozens of people were wounded and detained.\n\nPrime Minister Saad al-Hariri blamed his partners in government for obstructing reforms that could ward off economic crisis and gave them a 72-hour deadline to stop blocking him, otherwise hinting he may resign.\n\nHariri, addressing protesters, said Lebanon was going through an \u201cunprecedented, difficult time\u201d.\n\nLebanon\u2019s biggest protests in a decade recall the 2011 Arab revolts that toppled four presidents. Lebanese from all sects and walks of life have come out on to the streets, waving banners and chanting slogans urging Hariri\u2019s government to go.\n\nThe rallies follow warnings by economists and investors that Lebanon\u2019s economy and graft-riddled financial system are closer to the brink than at any time since the war-torn 1980s.\n\n\u201cThere are those who have placed obstacles in front of me ... and in the face of all the efforts that I have proposed for reform,\u201d Hariri said, without naming names.\n\n\u201cWhatever the solution, we no longer have time and I am personally giving myself only a little time. Either our partners in government and in the nation give a frank response to the solution, or I will have another say,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe deadline left is very short. It\u2019s 72 hours.\u201d\n\n\u2018STEP DOWN\u2019\n\nProtesters poured through villages and towns as well as the capital Beirut for a second day. No political leader, Muslim or Christian, was spared their wrath.\n\nTheir chants called for leaders including Hariri, President Michel Aoun, and Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri to step down.\n\nThe mood was a mixture of rage, defiance and hope.\n\nAs night fell, crowds waving Lebanese flags marched through the streets as patriotic music blared from loudspeakers. They shouted: \u201cOur demands are one, our objective is one: the people want the downfall of the regime.\u201d\n\nSome protesters fainted as security forces fired tear gas. The Red Cross said its teams had treated 160 people wounded in protests since Thursday evening.\n\n\u201cYou should be protecting us. Shame on you,\u201d a young man yelled as he covered his face against the choking fumes.\n\nLebanon\u2019s internal security apparatus said 52 police were injured on Friday and its forces arrested 70 people.\n\nSome protesters, including men in black hoods, blocked roads, set tyres on fire and used iron bars to smash storefronts in Beirut\u2019s posh downtown district.\n\nA demonstrator walks near a fire blocking a road during a protest targeting the government over an economic crisis, in downtown Beirut, Lebanon October 18, 2019.

Firefighters struggled late into the night to douse the flames.\n\nWith demonstrators crowding around Aoun\u2019s palace in Baabda, the United Nations urged all sides to refrain from actions that could lead to more tensions and violence.\n\nSaudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates warned their citizens against travelling to Lebanon. Bahrain told its nationals to leave at once.\n\n\u2018TOTALLY CORRUPT\u2019\n\nForeign Minister Gebran Bassil, Aoun\u2019s son-in-law, also blamed other parties for blocking reforms, saying the government must work to stop corruption and avoid imposing new taxes.\n\nThe latest unrest erupted out of anger over the rising cost of living and new tax plans, including a fee on WhatsApp calls.\n\n\u201cWe came to the streets because we can no longer bear this situation. This regime is totally corrupt,\u201d said Fadi Issa, 51, who marched with his son. \u201cThey are all thieves, they come into the government to fill their pockets, not to serve the country.\u201d\n\nIn an unprecedented move, Shi\u2019ite protesters also attacked the offices of their deputies from the influential Hezbollah and Amal movements in southern Lebanon.\n\nTo boost revenues, a government minister on Thursday unveiled a new fee for WhatsApp calls that fuelled outrage. But as the protests spread hours later, Telecoms Minister Mohamed Choucair revoked the planned levy.\n\nIn a country fractured along sectarian lines, the unusually wide geographic reach of the protests highlights the deepening anger of the Lebanese. The government, which includes nearly all Lebanon\u2019s main parties, has repeatedly failed to implement the reforms needed to fix the national finances.\n\nSlideshow (27 Images)\n\nForeign allies have pressured Hariri to enact reforms long promised but never delivered because of vested interests.\n\nShattered by war between 1975 and 1990, Lebanon has proportionally one of the world\u2019s highest debt burdens. Economic growth has been hit by regional conflict, while unemployment among the under-35s runs at 37%.\n\nSectarian politicians, many of them civil war militia leaders, have used state resources for their own benefit and are reluctant to give that up.", "description": "Security forces fired tear gas and chased down protesters in Beirut on Friday after tens of thousands of people across Lebanon marched to demand the demise of a political elite they accuse of looting the economy to the point of collapse.", "authors": ["Ellen Francis", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191019&t=2&i=1442505222&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9I012", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
