Oli promised that Nepal would oppose any \"anti-China activities\" on its soil, according to CCTV.\n\nThe Chinese president's comments come as pro-democracy protests in its semi-autonomous territory of Hong Kong have continued into their fourth month.\n\nWhat began as demonstrations against legislation that would have allowed for the extradition of Hong Kong residents to China to face trial has since snowballed into a violent fight against Chinese influence in the region.\n\nThough a portion of protests over the past 19 weeks have been peaceful and largely without incident, offshoot groups of protesters have frequently clashed with the police, throwing bricks, umbrellas, and other objects at law enforcement.\n\nThe police have ramped up their responses to protests, firing tear gas and rubber bullets at crowds, infiltrating protest groups using disguises, and arresting people en masse. Protesters have also suggested that the police have turned to organised gangs to carry out attacks on commuters.\n\nOn Sunday, peaceful rallies in the city descended into chaos, leading to the destruction of Beijing-linked shops and the closure of at least 27 train stations, according to the BBC.\n\nAuthorities say petrol bombs were also thrown at a police station in Mong Kok, and a police officer was stabbed in the neck.\n\nEarlier this month, police shot 18-year-old protester Tsang Chi-kin at point-blank range in the chest, marking the first time that live fire was used since protests began in June.\n\nA foreign journalist was also blinded after being hit in the eye with a rubber bullet while covering clashes.", "description": "Xi's comments come as pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong have entered into their 19th week and have recently seen an uptick in violence.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/5151/66acdcdcb9364d47822ae7921308518e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
