Here's what you need to know as you start your Tuesday ...\n\nNational Security Council official to testify that he was 'concerned' after listening to Ukraine phone call, alerted counsel\n\nAs part of the House's formal impeachment inquiry, a top official at the National Security Council is expected to testify Tuesday that he listened to the July phone call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Situation Room, and reported his concerns to the NSC\u2019s lead counsel.\n\nIn prepared remarks obtained by Fox News, Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a director of national security affairs, wrote: \u201cI did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the U.S. government\u2019s support of Ukraine.\u201d He added, \u201cFollowing the call, I... reported my concerns to NSC\u2019s lead counsel,\u201d a reference to top NSC lawyer John A. Eisenberg.\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 inquiry was opened after a whistleblower complaint alleged that Trump, during the July phone call, pushed Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter as military aid to the country was being withheld. The White House and the president\u2019s allies have maintained there was no such quid pro quo. Meanwhile, more questions are emerging about Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Monday the House will vote on a resolution to formalize -- and establish the parameters -- of the Trump impeachment inquiry.\n\nIn a letter sent to Democratic House lawmakers, Pelosi, D-Calif., said the resolution \"affirms the ongoing, existing investigation,\" \"establishes the procedure\" for future investigative steps and to potentially prevent the Trump administration from withholding documents and preventing witnesses from testifying. Fox News has learned the vote will take place Thursday on the House floor. It is not an actual article of impeachment, but rather a resolution that sets process ground rules.\n\nRepublicans hit back Monday at Pelosi over the planned vote, with South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham -- the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which would play a role in a Senate impeachment trial -- saying, \u201cA vote now is a bit like un-ringing a bell as House Democrats have selectively leaked information in order to damage President Trump for weeks.\"\n\nAl-Baghdadi informant was inside compound at time of raid, Kurdish general tells Fox News\n\nThe U.S. raid that led to the death of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was months in the making and involved significant intelligence from Kurdish allies in Syria \u2013 including a rare informant at the heart of ISIS who was in the compound at the time of the raid, Fox News has learned.\n\nGen. Mazloum Abdi, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) commander, told Fox News how they tracked al-Baghdadi after the caliphate fell. The general said the informant \u201ctold us that he moved west to Idlib, and to a specific house. We told American intelligence on May 15, and together set up a secret cell, which had three Americans in it.\u201d\n\nThe SDF informant told them about the tunnels under the compound, how many people were with al-Baghdadi, and that he was planning to move, having been at that location for months. That's when the U.S. decided to strike.

Bertelsman, is based on an amended complaint filed by Sandmann's legal team.\n\nICYMI: Meet the hero dog injured in Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi raid\n\nPresident Trump tweeted a photo of the U.S. military dog injured in the raid that claimed al-Baghdadi's life. The hero dog -- whose name still a mystery -- was unveiled in a tweet, reading: \u201cWe have declassified a picture of the wonderful dog (name not declassified) that did such a GREAT JOB in capturing and killing the Leader of ISIS, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi!\u201d The photo was released hours after Army Gen.
