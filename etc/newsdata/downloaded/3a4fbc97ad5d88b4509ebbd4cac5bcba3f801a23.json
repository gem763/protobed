A court has ruled that France\u2019s most famous rooster can carry on with his dawn chorus, in a legal case that has pitted town against country.\n\nOn Thursday, a tribunal rejected a couple\u2019s complaint about the bird\u2019s early morning crowing and ordered them to pay \u20ac1,000 (\u00a3897) in damages to Maurice\u2019s owner, Corinne Fesseau.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m speechless. We certainly ruffled their feathers,\u201d Fesseau said outside the hearing. \u201cIt\u2019s a victory for all those who are in my situation. I hope this will be a precedent for the others. Everyone will now be protected: the church bells, the frogs \u2026 why not a Maurice law to protect all rural noises.\u201d\n\nJulien Papineau, the defence lawyer for Fesseau and Maurice, said they had won because: \u201cUnder French law you have to prove there is a nuisance, and this was not done.\u201d\n\nThe dispute between Fesseau and her neighbours on the \u00cele d\u2019Ol\u00e9ron, western France, has taken two years to resolve. Two retired farmers with a second home on the island complained that Maurice was making an abnormal racket when he crowed at 6.30am and was disturbing the peace during their holidays.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A man wears a T-shirt in support of Maurice, whose loud crows landed him in court accused of noise pollution.

The pair had bought a second home on the island in 2004, long before Maurice hatched in 2017. They were not in court because of the media interest in the case, their lawyer said, but they asked the court to rule that the noise had to stop.\n\nThe case was seen as symbolic of the clash between those living in rural areas who have long kept animals or rung church bells and those from urban areas of France or abroad who have bought second homes in the countryside.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Corinne Fesseau (right), Maurice\u2019s owner, talks to a woman in Rochefort, western France.

Legal arguments focused on whether Saint-Pierre d\u2019Ol\u00e9ron, where Maurice lives and where the 7,000-strong local population swells to 35,000 in summer, could be described as \u201crural\u201d.\n\nVincent Huberdeau, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, rejected the idea that Maurice was a \u201ctown v country\u201d issue. \u201cThe rooster, the dog, the car horn, the music \u2026 it\u2019s about noise,\u201d he said during the hearing. \u201cIt\u2019s not a row between bourgeois and rural dwellers.\u201d He did not say if the couple would appeal against the court\u2019s decision.\n\nBruno Dionis du S\u00e9jour, a retired farmer and mayor of the village of Gajac in south-west France has proposed a solution to the chorus of complaints about animal noises \u2013 he has asked the government to declare them part of France\u2019s heritage, giving them state protection.", "description": "French judge ruffles feathers by rejecting complaint about bird\u2019s dawn squawking", "authors": ["Kim Willsher"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f068b795cd8cfa5f84316bbe4e354a6e4595dbd8/0_2_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b30f746d03c7ddf6c494291ebe1b18e5", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
