Bolton says he offered to resign on his own.\n\nPresident Donald Trump ousted national security adviser John Bolton on Tuesday, saying he and the hawkish aide had \"disagreed strongly\" on many issues and suggesting that Bolton had collided with other Trump advisers, too.\n\nThe decision came after widespread reports that Bolton tried to stop Trump from inviting leaders of the Afghan Taliban to Camp David for peace talks. Trump ultimately scrapped the idea, but multiple people familiar with the issue said the news reports about Bolton\u2019s dissent \u2014 believed to have been planted by Bolton aides \u2014 infuriated Trump.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBolton\u2019s ouster leaves yet another vacancy in the upper echelons of the Trump administration, where many roles are either unfilled or filled on an acting basis, including several that deal with national security issues. It also means Trump could hear fewer dissenting voices on major moves he wants to make on the national security front, such as talking to the leaders of Iran.\n\nThe president himself didn\u2019t get too specific in his tweets announcing Bolton\u2019s departure, though he indicated it was not a spur of the moment move.\n\n\"I informed John Bolton last night that his services are no longer needed at the White House,\" Trump wrote. \"I disagreed strongly with many of his suggestions, as did others in the Administration, and therefore ... I asked John for his resignation, which was given to me this morning. I thank John very much for his service.\"\n\nBolton offered a conflicting account on Twitter minutes after Trump's posts. \"I offered to resign last night and President Trump said, 'Let's talk about it tomorrow,'\" he wrote online. Bolton did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe news caught many in the administration off guard. Shortly before Trump\u2019s tweets, the White House had announced that Bolton would appear at a briefing later Tuesday with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. The two Cabinet secretaries, both of whom had their own frustrations with Bolton, appeared together, and in good spirits.\n\nI offered to resign last night and President Trump said, \"Let's talk about it tomorrow.\" \u2014 John Bolton (@AmbJohnBolton) September 10, 2019\n\nPeople familiar with the issue said Trump grew frustrated over time with news stories about divisions in the administration that he was convinced were peddled by Bolton and his media surrogates.\n\nOver the weekend, as reports in The New York Times and other outlets laid out the back-and-forth within the administration over whether to invite the Taliban to Camp David, Trump \u2014 as well as other officials like Pompeo \u2014 grew upset at what they were sure were leaks from Bolton and his aides.\n\n\u201cWhen the New York Times story came out, it was pretty clear that Bolton or his people had his fingerprints all over it, that it wasn\u2019t his idea to meet with the Taliban, that it was Pompeo\u2019s. That was the end of business. It was petty and stupid,\u201d said a Trump confidante familiar with the president's thinking.\n\nA second person confirmed that explanation, saying that it was part of a pattern of leaks believed to have come from Bolton\u2019s camp that highlighted dissent in the president\u2019s inner circle.\n\n\"The fundamental problem here is the president had a national security adviser who was unwilling to accept the decisions made by the president,\" this person said. \"When they contradicted his opinion, he worked to undermine them.\"\n\n\"It\u2019s safe to say that the entire administration that is on the national security team has talked to the president about their frustrations,\" the person added.\n\nOn Monday night, Bolton and Trump met in the Oval Office before the president took off for a rally in North Carolina, according to White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham.\n\nIt was at that meeting that Trump asked for Bolton's resignation, she said. Asked whether the tenor of the conversation was negative, Grisham replied: \"I mean, he was asked for his resignation...\"\n\nBolton's resignation letter, dated Tuesday, was terse: \"I hereby resign, effective immediately, as Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs. Thank you for having afforded me this opportunity to serve our country.\"\n\nSome administration officials appeared pleased when they appeared Tuesday afternoon. When Pompeo was asked whether he was blindsided, he quipped, \"I'm never surprised,\" and broke into a grin.\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201909/2439/1155968404_6085050598001_6085050972001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\" true\n\n\"The president's entitled to the staff he wants at any moment,\" Pompeo added, saying that when Trump \"makes a decision like this, he's well within his rights to do so.\"\n\nAsked by one journalist whether the president's national security team is \"a mess,\" Mnuchin shot back: \"Absolutely not. That's the most ridiculous question I've ever heard of.\"\n\nWhite House deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley said Charles Kupperman, the deputy national security adviser, will replace Bolton on an acting basis.\n\nFrom the start of his tenure, Bolton frustrated many of his peers by largely dispensing with the traditional national-security decision-making process \u2014 holding fewer formal high-level meetings to hash out issues and keeping many topics within a tight circle of aides. Officials at the State Department and the Pentagon often felt blindsided or left out of what process there was. Bolton also has clashed with staffers for Trump's acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney.\n\nA former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Bolton came in to the White House espousing hawkish foreign policy views that were often at odds with Trump on issues like Iran and North Korea.\n\nTrump has acknowledged the differences between him and Bolton in the past, but he\u2019s suggested he\u2019s found it useful to have a \u201cbad cop\u201d like Bolton in his corner, especially when facing nemeses like the Islamist regime in Tehran, which Bolton advocated overthrowing before joining the White House.\n\n\u201cJohn Bolton was Trump\u2019s way of trolling Iran, curating an element of the unpredictable. But he had no power. John Bolton was more of a mascot,\u201d a second Trump confidant told POLITICO.\n\nStill, Bolton's dissent apparently grated on Trump\u2019s nerves. The president has been keen on trying to strike a peace deal with the Taliban that would allow U.S. troops to partially or fully leave Afghanistan, for instance, but Bolton has not.\n\nWhen NBC News reported that Bolton as well as Vice President Mike Pence were opposed to the idea of such a summit, others in the administration came to believe that it was Bolton or one of his aides who leaked that story, two people familiar with the topic said. Trump on Monday dismissed the story as untrue.\n\n\"A lot of Fake News is being reported that I overruled the VP and various advisers on a potential Camp David meeting with the Taliban. This Story is False!\" he wrote on Twitter, adding that the \"Dishonest Media likes to create ... the look of turmoil in the White House, of which there is none.\"\n\nBolton in the past has made it clear he\u2019s been displeased with Trump\u2019s efforts to strike a nuclear deal with North Korea, which have included three meetings with the country's dictator, Kim Jong Un. Bolton also voiced unhappiness with Trump\u2019s desire to meet with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani during the upcoming United Nations General Assembly meeting.\n\nWhile it\u2019s not clear if Rouhani will agree to the session, his aides, including Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif, have frequently derided Bolton as a member of Trump's \u201cB-team,\u201d a group of advisers determined to take Trump into a war he doesn\u2019t want. Earlier this year, Trump nearly launched a military strike against Iran after Tehran took credit for downing an American drone.\n\nOne person sure to benefit from Bolton's ouster is Pompeo. The country's top diplomat is already one of Trump's most trusted advisers, and, unlike Bolton, he has generally avoided publicly airing any differences he may have with Trump. There's even speculation that Pompeo could serve as both national security adviser and secretary of State, just as Henry Kissinger once did.\n\nOne of the people familiar with the circumstances said past stories about tensions between Bolton and Pompeo were \"overblown\" \u2014 alleging they were planted by Bolton. But the person said the national security decision-making process will be smoother moving forward.\n\n\u201cThe secretary and the president will be able to build a national security team that will present the president with the best available information, a range of options, and then implement the presidential decisions without attempting to undermine them,\u201d the person said.\n\nAlready there is speculation about who will replace Bolton on a permanent basis. Names being floated include Stephen Biegun, the current U.S. envoy for North Korean issues; Brian Hook, the U.S. envoy for Iran issues; Ric Grenell, the U.S. ambassador to Germany; and Douglas Macgregor, a retired Army colonel who often appears on Fox News.\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201909/3857/1155968404_6085050604001_6085042811001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\"\n\nReactions on Capitol Hill to Bolton's exit came swiftly from Republican lawmakers, with Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) heralding him as \"a brilliant man\" whose resignation constituted \"an extraordinary loss\" for the United States.\n\n\"I\u2019m very, very unhappy to hear that he\u2019s leaving,\" Romney said, praising Bolton's \"contrarian\" sensibilities as \"an asset, not a liability.\"\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) a top ally to Trump and occasional counselor on foreign policy, complimented Bolton as someone who \"sees the world for what it is,\" but stressed the importance of the \"personal relationship\" between the president and the national security adviser.\n\n\"I appreciate what John Bolton had done for the country for a long period of time, and now the president can pick a national security adviser he has more confidence in,\" Graham said.\n\nKentucky Sen. Rand Paul, a libertarian-leaning Republican who has tried to broker talks between Trump and Iranian officials, was more blunt, saying Bolton's removal was a \"necessary action.\"\n\nBolton served as the U.S. ambassador to the U.N. for 16 months under former President George W. Bush\u2019s administration.\n\nHe took over as Trump\u2019s top national security aide in April 2018 \u2014 despite widespread opposition from Democrats and concern among several high-profile members of the diplomatic community over his perceived proclivity for military intervention and role in the origins of the Iraq War.\n\nBolton\u2019s hawkishness extended to cyberspace, where he encouraged the increased use offensive digital operations. In June, Bolton said the U.S. would expand these kinds of cyberattacks to deter election interference and corporate data breaches.\n\nDuring his time at the White House, Bolton pushed out homeland security adviser Tom Bossert and eliminated a cybersecurity coordinator position, earning him considerable criticism from Capitol Hill.\n\nBolton is the third national security adviser of Trump\u2019s presidency. He assumed leadership of the administration\u2019s National Security Council following the March 2018 ouster of H. R. McMaster, the Army lieutenant general who frequently clashed with the president on matters of foreign policy and was branded by detractors as not sufficiently conservative.\n\nTrump\u2019s first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, became ensnared in former special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation, and pleaded guilty in December 2017 to one felony count of lying to the FBI about conversations he had with Russia\u2019s ambassador.\n\nArren Kimbel-Sannit, Marc Caputo, Nancy Cook, Eliana Johnson, Anita Kumar, Daniel Lippman, Eric Geller and Caitlin Oprysko contributed to this report.", "description": "The president says he asked for Bolton to leave.
