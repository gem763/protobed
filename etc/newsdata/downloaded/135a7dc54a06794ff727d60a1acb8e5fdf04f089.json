Others, however, might read his latest comments as yet another needless prescription of acquiescence to a bloc of Americans on the wrong side of history.\n\nIn an interview with actor and activist Yara Shahidi at the Obama Foundation Summit in Chicago, the former president decried what he deemed \u201cwoke culture\u201d for its purported unhelpful puritanism.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\n\"Like, if I tweet or hashtag about how you didn't do something right or used the wrong verb. Then, I can sit back and feel pretty good about myself because, man, you see how woke I was?\" he said. \"You know, that's not activism. That's not bringing about change. If all you're doing is casting stones, you're probably not going to get that far.\u201d\n\nMuch like your average conservative or Fox News political analyst, Obama went on to say that he sees this culture disturbingly prevalent across college campuses: \u201cI do get a sense sometimes now among certain young people \u2014 and this is accelerated by social media \u2014 there is this sense sometimes of 'the way of me making change is to be as judgmental as possible about other people,'\" he continued.\n\nThen came even more paternalistic observations.\n\n\"This idea of purity, and you're never compromised, and you're always politically woke and all that stuff, you should get over that quickly.\u201d In a call for more nuance, he added, \"The world is messy, there are ambiguities. People who do really good stuff have flaws. People who you are fighting may love their kids and share certain things with you.\n\nI suppose on the surface, you can understand Obama\u2019s point. People are complicated. People can change. If a person is open to change, they should be given space to evolve.\n\nBut we need to be real about the actual context of these remarks. It is not as if a bunch of young folks and/or nonwhite people have started a purity test ring. Liberals are hardly perfect, but in talking about the dangers of being judgmental and bullheaded, I\u2019d rather talk about the conservative media and political complex and its major players.\n\nSomeone being called out for their prejudices at any given moment in the mentions of their Twitter timeline is not as dangerous as a propaganda vehicle propping up the corrupt white supremacist who locks up babies in cages as he routinely attacks other nonwhite groups in terms of both rhetoric and policy.\n\nAre we not in an era in which young Americans across the country are mobilizing to raise awareness about issues like gun violence, anti-racism, trans and queer acceptance, and climate change? Am I to believe that young people being vocal online is not an important first step in their path towards activism? Am I to pretend online activism isn\u2019t a thing?\n\nIt\u2019s quite curious to see where Obama continues to aim his ire.\n\nAs Buzzfeed News political reporter Clarissa-Jan Lim highlights, these latest comments are extremely similar to those Obama offered in a 2017 interview with Prince Harry and last year at the Nelson Mandela Annual Lecture last year.\n\nAt the latter event, the former president asserted: \"Democracy demands that we're able also to get inside the reality of people who are different than us so we can understand their point of view. Maybe we can change their minds, but maybe they'll change ours. And you can't do this if you just out of hand disregard what your opponents have to say from the start.\"\n\nShape Created with Sketch. 9 of Barack Obama's best feminist quotes Show all 9 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch. Shape Created with Sketch. 9 of Barack Obama's best feminist quotes 1/9 On shifting sexist attitudes 'We need to keep changing the attitude that raises our girls to be demure and our boys to be assertive, that criticises our daughters for speaking out and our sons for shedding a tear. We need to keep changing the attitude that punishes women for their sexuality and rewards men for theirs.' (Glamour magazine, August 2016) Getty Images 2/9 On fair workplace policies 'Today, women make up about half our workforce. But they still make 77 cents for every dollar a man earns. That is wrong, and in 2014, it\u2019s an embarrassment. A woman deserves equal pay for equal work. She deserves to have a baby without sacrificing her job. A mother deserves a day off to care for a sick child or sick parent without running into hardship \u2013 and you know what, a father does, too. It\u2019s time to do away with workplace policies that belong in a Mad Men episode.' (State of the Union speech, January 2014) Getty Images 3/9 On the importance of feminist role models 'Michelle and I have raised our daughters to speak up when they see a double standard or feel unfairly judged based on their gender or race \u2013 or when they notice that happening to someone else. It\u2019s important for them to see role models out in the world who climb to the highest levels of whatever field they choose. And yes, it\u2019s important that their dad is a feminist, because now that\u2019s what they expect of all men.' (Glamour magazine, August 2016) Getty Images 4/9 On breaking glass ceilings 'As we prepare to write the next chapter of women's history, let us resolve to build on the progress won by the trailblazers of the past. We must carry forward the work of the women who came before us and ensure our daughters have no limits on their dreams, no obstacles to their achievements, and no remaining ceilings to shatter.' (Presidential Proclamation for Women's History Month, February 2011) Getty Images 5/9 On granting women equal opportunities 'Around the world there is a tradition of oppressing women and treating them differently and not giving them the same opportunities, and husbands beating their wives, and children not being sent to school. Those are traditions. Treating women and girls as second-class citizens. Those are bad traditions. They need to change.' (During speech in Nairobi, Kenya in July 2015) Getty Images 6/9 On gender stereotypes 'We know that these stereotypes affect how girls see themselves starting at a very young age, making them feel that if they don\u2019t look or act a certain way, they are somehow less worthy. In fact, gender stereotypes affect all of us, regardless of our gender, gender identity, or sexual orientation.' (Glamour magazine, August 2016) Getty Images 7/9 On gender pay inequality 'It is now our generation\u2019s task to carry on what those pioneers began. For our journey is not complete until our wives, our mothers and daughters can earn a living equal to their efforts.' (Inaugural Address, January 2013) Getty Images 8/9 On the true meaning of masculinity 'It\u2019s easy to absorb all kinds of messages from society about masculinity and come to believe that there\u2019s a right way and a wrong way to be a man. But as I got older, I realised that my ideas about being a tough guy or cool guy just weren\u2019t me. They were a manifestation of my youth and insecurity. Life became a lot easier when I simply started being myself.' (Glamour magazine, August 2016) Getty Images 9/9 On what a feminist looks like 'I did want to stop by and make one thing very clear: I may be a little greyer than I was eight years ago \u2013 but this is what a feminist looks like. Of course, in my household there\u2019s no choice.'

(United States of Women Summit, June 2016) AFP/Getty Images\n\nI am never quite sure if Obama really thinks this naively or if he\u2019s trying to convince certain sects of the population \u2014 notably young black folks, whom he just loves to lecture\u2014 that it\u2019s better to coddle white people about their prejudices with the hopes of growth rather than speak our minds as we see fit.\n\nRecall his 2004 DNC speech that there being no red America or blue America, just the United States of America. I never believed that. I found it adorable and rhetorically impressive \u2014 but that doesn't mean it was true.\n\nAnother problematic moment occurred in 2008, when Obama publicly denounced Reverend Jeremiah Wright while running for president. Wright, his former pastor, was marred in controversy over a sermon he had given in 2003 in the wake of the Iraq invasion. \u201cNo, no, no. Not God bless America,\u201d Wright declared in the circulating clip. \u201cGod damn America!\u201d\n\nAs Jamelle Bouie wrote in Slate, Wright \u201cwas speaking in a black religious and political tradition that condemns America for its treatment of black and brown people, for the genocide of natives and the enslavement of Africans, for internment and displacement. In Wright\u2019s eyes, America was sinful, and until it atoned for those sins, God would deny His blessings. Not God Bless America. God Damn America!\u201d\n\nThose remarks were grossly misinterpreted and used as a means to further other then-candidate Obama. In response, on March 18, 2008, Obama delivered an address in Philadelphia now known as his \u201cA More Perfect Union\u201d speech in which he acknowledged the root of Wright's anger but spoke dismissively of his personal views: \u201cIt's that he spoke as if our society was static; as if no progress has been made; as if this country\u2014a country that has made it possible for one of his own members to run for the highest office in the land and build a coalition of white and black; Latino and Asian, rich and poor, young and old\u2014is still irrevocably bound to a tragic past,\u201d he said.\n\nYes, and that country then voted for Donald Trump \u2014 a nod many took at this century's Great Redemption.\n\nAs it turns out, Wright knew better about this country than some let on.\n\nI supported President Obama throughout his term. I love what he and his family symbolize to so many black people. I respect him immensely as a writer and orator. That admiration and respect is why his continued instance to speak in these platitudes to his own and to young people to be so disheartening.\n\nWe the people do not have to cower to the powerful and their righteousness. Nor do we have to stand for their miscategorizations or generalizations \u2014 no matter how much we appreciate them and their contributions. You can like someone and still find what they have to say in a given moment utterly useless. There\u2019s no better time than the present. Given the time in history we\u2019re at, it\u2019s right to wonder if a former US president as beloved as Barack Hussein Obama ought to be making better use of his time and platform.\n\nObama can believe what he wants, but the era of hope and change was succeeded by American carnage. There are lessons to be learned from that and one of them should be to call out wrong when spotted. Some people can stand to chill, but to act like this period we\u2019re in isn\u2019t more rewarding than it is detrimental is a tale I won\u2019t fall for.\n\nIf you want solid proof that the big bad cancel culture theory is hokum, look no further than Obama\u2019s recent endorsement of Justin Trudeau for re-election as Canada\u2019s prime minister. Cancel culture is so dominant that the man couldn\u2019t even remember the number of times he wore blackface gets rewarded with an endorsement by America\u2019s first black president and eventual victory.\n\nAny day now, hopefully our former leader will speak more about Donald Trump and the antics of the national political party and media organizations emboldening his white nationalist nightmare of an administration. Why hasn\u2019t he accepted that speaking in niceties surely won\u2019t stop any of them?", "description": "On Tuesday this week, former President Obama called on Americans to behave more sensibly and compassionate \u2014 or at least, that\u2019s how some have viewed his remarks.
