Well, subscribe right now, right here), the full contents of the big, new issue of National Review \u2014 which includes our special annual focus on energy \u2014 are available to read and enjoy, from The Week at the get-go to the last-page \u201cHappy Warrior\u201d (where Kyle Smith dreams about dad-based superheroes), and so much excellence in between. Such as: Douglas Murray\u2019s cover essay on the Brexit Knot, which finds itself in the company of two great profiles. First: John McCormack grabs a beer with Senator Ben Sasse, facing reelection amidst the GOP\u2019s identity crisis. Second: Charlie Cooke visits Justice Neil Gorsuch\u2019s SCOTUS chambers to talk originalism and the Constitution. And then there is Jay Nordlinger\u2019s deep dive with Ryan Crocker into America\u2019s shifting Afghan policy. Meanwhile, the special energy section kicks off with Mario Loyola\u2019s analysis of America\u2019s shale-gas revolution, and the political forces determined to squash it, and also includes a look at the troubling state of the country\u2019s electrical grid by Mark Mills.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut wait, there\u2019s more: Kat Timpf checks in (it\u2019s her first big NR magazine piece) about the defiance of stand-up comedian Dave Chapelle in the era of Woke Warriors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRemember, even non-NRPLUS subscribers are permitted to read a handful of magazine pieces, so enjoy what you can. But really, do subscribe.", "description": "Read all about energy, Justice Neil Gorsuch, and Brexit, here, now!", "authors": ["Jack Fowler", "Kevin D.
