But not one influential, veteran money manager.\n\n\u201cI think the markets independent of the [presidential] elections frankly are due for a very big wake-up call,\u201d Ariel Investments Chief Investment Officer Rupal Bhansali said on Yahoo Finance\u2019s On the Move. Bhansali has $7 billion under management at Ariel Investments and is the author of the new book \u2018Non-Consensus Investing.\u2019\n\nBhansali added, \u201cI will tell you that in 2007 having been through markets and covering 50 countries, this playbook has been with us before. If you care to look back in history, Japan tried quantitative easing and it failed. Ultimately it\u2019s about corporate earnings and balance sheets. Ultimately investors need to wean themselves off steroids.\u201d\n\nThe stock market could experience a major setback this year, Bhansali thinks, adding that investors need to pay more attention to the recently soaring costs in the repo markets and sub-2% 10-year Treasury yield.\n\nThe unexpected\n\n\u201cPeople are not expecting it which is exactly why it could happen. The real disappointment is not going to come from earnings that everyone keeps watching, it\u2019s about balance sheet risk,\u201d said Bhansali.\n\nPhoto: Jin Lee/AP/dapd More\n\nTo Bhansali\u2019s point, investors, perhaps, have gotten too high on the hog this month. The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite are all up almost 3% in September, despite no good news on the U.S.-China trade war front. High beta, momentum tech stocks such as Facebook (FB) and Alphabet (GOOG) have led the markets higher.\n\nMeanwhile, the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) \u2014 aka Wall Street\u2019s fear gauge \u2014 is hovering around the lows of the year.\n\nSo, given that complacency, it\u2019s not far-fetched investors could be badly caught off guard in the fourth quarter. Sometimes it pays \u2014 handsomely \u2014 to be a contrarian investor like Bhansali.\n\nBrian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and co-anchor of The First Trade at Yahoo Finance.
