The ambassador said he was \u201cnot complaining\u201d but relations had been \u201cvery difficult\u201d with the EU. \u201cWe have gotten a lot of pushback, we have gotten a lot of nos. Changing the members of the team might help break that logjam.\u201d\n\nThe US team did not see serving EU leaders, including Jean-Claude Juncker, who negotiated a truce in a trade dispute with the US. Nor did they see Donald Tusk, who has previously described the Trump-led United States as a geopolitical \u201cthreat\u201d to the EU.\n\nA multimillionaire hotelier appointed by Trump, Sondland argued that \u201cdifferences are not necessarily as great as they are portrayed in the media\u201d, citing Iran as an example.\n\nUS dismisses French plan to ease Iran tension and piles on economic pressure Read more\n\nYet the EU and US remain deeply divided on how to handle Iran, after Donald Trump pulled out of the international agreement to limit the country\u2019s nuclear programme. The ambassador said the US was studying a plan from the French president, Emmanuel Macron, to set up a $15bn credit line for oil sales \u2013 an idea that hinges on US buy-in.\n\nYawning gaps remain over the climate emergency, while the two sides did not discuss the details of their differences on trade in the latest meetings. Sondland said \u201cthe substance of our trade disagreement hasn\u2019t changed\u201d, while adding he was cautiously optimistic. The US, he said, wanted \u201cto identify some low-hanging fruit\u201d where the two sides could reach \u201csome quick preliminary agreements\u201d to build trust, including Iran, Venezuela, China and the rollout of 5G.\n\nIan Lesser, director of the German Marshall Fund\u2019s Brussels office, said that Europeans would be looking for clear prospects of policy change. \u201cTo have a reset on style is possible to an extent, to have a reset in policy is much more difficult.\n\n\u201cI do think some very considerable damage has been done in recent years by discourse and policy choices, but the truth is there is a very substantial relationship that remains.\u201d\n\nPompeo and Sondland also met the new president of the European parliament, David Sassoli, as well as the future EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, who has previously slammed Washington\u2019s \u201ccowboy\u201d diplomacy in Venezuela.\n\nSpokespeople at the European commission and parliament declined to comment on the meetings, beyond confirming \u201cintroductory\u201d and \u201cfirst contact\u201d meetings had taken place.\n\nThe US media criticised the decision not to invite any journalist on to the secretary of state\u2019s plane, a breach with standard practice.", "description": "Gordon Sondland says relations have been \u2018very difficult\u2019 after Mike Pompeo visit to meet new leaders of European institutions", "authors": ["Jennifer Rankin"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec07c65365e0e28f009ddef6ec67c42578461e31/0_0_4012_2408/master/4012.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=afb1ab42ccd1cdca099465766e44aad7"}
