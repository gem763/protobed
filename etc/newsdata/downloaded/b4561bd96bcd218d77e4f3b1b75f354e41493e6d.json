Exactly what these are for isn\u2019t clear, although it does mean you will, like the Oculus headsets, be able to instantly switch to a view that shows your surroundings when you have the headset on.\n\nIt also has obvious applications for AR, rather than just VR, and while it\u2019s not mentioned we\u2019d be very surprised if the new headset didn\u2019t allow for proper roomscale tracking like the Oculus Quest \u2013 allowing you to move around in a large virtual space rather than just sitting or standing.\n\nApart from anything, the prospect of new controllers is enough to get excited about on its own, as the current PlayStation Move wands are very imprecise and weren\u2019t even originally designed with VR in mind, but instead were created for Sony\u2019s answer to Kinect way back in 2010.\n\nLetsGoDigital are the same Dutch site that discovered the patent for the PlayStation 5 dev kit and created a 3D render of it, which they recently updated based on new information.\n\nBut as with any patent there\u2019s no guarantee that it will be turned into a final product, even if the idea of a new headset does seem inevitable.\n\nThe only thing Sony has said in connection with PlayStation 5 and VR is that the current headset will work with the new console. But it\u2019s been widely assumed there will be a new version of the technology as well, and this patent seems to be evidence of that.\n\nThe PS5 dev kit in rendered form (pic: LetsGoDigital)\n\nEmail gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMORE: Sony unsure if PlayStation 5 backwards compatibility will cover every game\n\nMORE: PlayStation 5 tech specs reveal hardware-accelerated ray-tracing and 4K Blu-ray\n\nMORE: PlayStation 5 name and Christmas 2020 release date confirmed", "description": "Newly discovered Sony patents seem to show designs for a next gen PSVR 2 headset for the PlayStation 5, with new controllers too.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screenshot_2-63da_1570630185.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
