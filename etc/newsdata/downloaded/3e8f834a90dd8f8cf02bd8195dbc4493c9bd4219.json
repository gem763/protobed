This year, AFL chairman Richard Goyder had to settle for proprietor Kerry Stokes and Seven Group CEO Ryan Stokes as representatives of the free-to-air network. As we forewarned, this gig is all chiefs and no Indians.\n\nSeven West Media chief executive James Warburton: has his priorities. James Alcock\n\nMr Ambitious \u2013 as David Leckie labelled him in unhappier times \u2013 was in Melbourne attending the Brownlow Medal function on Monday, so at least made an early appearance at the Festival of the Boot. But by Saturday he\u2019d escaped to Lord Howe Island for his mother\u2019s 80th birthday. You only get one family \u2013 and six years ago, the media executive tragically lost his father Richard, who was fatally hit by a ute while walking to a pilates class. Mrs Warburton had encouraged her husband to get out more.\n\nHere\u2019s hoping the family knees-up wasn\u2019t too disruptive to the local black rat population.\n\nAlso in the Olympic Room \u2013 although not on the top table \u2013 was Southern Cross Austereo CEO Grant Blackley, who Ten Network\u2019s boss Leckie delighted in referring to in interviews as Gert Clackley, Greg Cackley or any other vague iteration of his actual name. The magic of television!\n\nRounding out the TV luminaries was another former Ten CEO in Hamish McLennan, now sitting pretty as chairman of REA Group and HT &E, and as deputy chairman of Hamish Douglass\u2019 funds management giant Magellan.", "description": "His predecessor Tim Worner was always a fixture at the head table with Aussie rules\u2019 other broadcasters,", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1839%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/59f85a4df3377f2b1e9e7ef0526afe5796c7f704", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
