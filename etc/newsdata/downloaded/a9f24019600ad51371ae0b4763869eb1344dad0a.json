I was pushing from the beginning because our strategy was clear,\" Marquez said. \"This time I tried to open the gap from the beginning because I felt very strong in the warm-up.\"\n\nHe said he lost focus during the race when he realized his bike was burning through fuel too quickly, forcing him to \"play a lot with switches\".\n\nBut Marquez was never directly threatened and enjoyed a two-second gap ahead of Quartararo through most of the second half.\n\nQuartararo finished with his third narrow defeat to the championship winner in recent races but was left smiling after winning the Rookie of the Year award.\n\n\"Marc was super fast today,\" the Frenchman said. \"I really pushed at my 100 percent to try to stay with him.\"\n\nHe was also fending off pressure from Dovizioso, whose late charge fell just short.\n\n\"Dovi was unbelievably fast. He was riding more than a half second faster than me,\" Quartararo said.\n\nDovizioso, marking his 100th career podium finish, said he struggled to find his form until late in the race, where he could only compete for the possible second while fending off Yamaha's Marverick Vinales behind him.\n\n\"I was pushing so hard, but it was a bit over the limit. I wanted to (win) second, but it was not enough,\" the Italian said. \"We struggled a bit during the weekend.\"\n\nMarquez had already secured his season victory by winning the Thailand Grand Prix earlier this month.\n\nDovizioso is currently second in the world standings but missed the chance to lock in a runner-up championship finish with three more races left in the season.\n\n\u00a9 2019 AFP", "description": "MotoGP world champion Marc Marquez won the Japan Grand Prix Sunday to notch his tenth victory of the season and third win on the circuit in four years.
