It battered the Abaco Islands and Grand Bahama, in the north of the archipelago, for two days.\n\nBahamas PM Hubert Minnis called the storm \"one of the greatest national crises in our country's history\". He expected the number of fatalities to increase.\n\nWhat's the latest on the storm?\n\nThe US National Hurricane Center (NHC) said that at 06:00GMT Dorian was 170km (105 miles) south-east of Charleston and moving north at about 11km/h (7mph).\n\nIt is expected to turn north-east on Thursday and speed up.\n\nThe NHC warns that a \"life-threatening storm surge with significant coastal flooding is expected along a large portion of the south-east and mid-Atlantic coasts of the United States in the next couple of days\".\n\nSouth Carolina is preparing for a record storm surge and the effects are already being felt.\n\nDorian is forecast to move \"near or over\" the coast of South Carolina on Thursday, then the coast of North Carolina overnight and on Friday.\n\nGraphics showed waters could rise up to 8ft (2.4m) above ground level on the South Carolina coast, and up to 15in of rain could fall in the coming days.\n\n\"Time to get out is running out,\" the state's governor Henry McMaster told reporters.\n\n\"Water levels could rise well in advance of the arrival of strong winds,\" the NHC said, adding these storm surges are expected \"regardless of the exact track of Dorian's centre\".\n\nMore than 2.2 million people have been ordered to evacuate along the eastern seaboard.\n\nUS President Donald Trump earlier held up a map incorrectly suggesting Dorian could hit Alabama. Some observers said it looked as though a line around the state was drawn with a felt pen.\n\nThe president has since said he did not know why the chart showed this.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nPresidential candidate Marianne Williamson meanwhile earlier suggested on Twitter that prayer could drive the storm away. She defended her now-deleted tweet, claiming that those praying should not be treated with \"mockery or condescension\".\n\nWhat happened in the Bahamas?\n\nAlthough Grand Bahama suffered severe damage and floods, the northern Abaco Islands were hardest hit. Footage taken from the air showed vast swathes of destruction. Homes, roads and businesses have been torn apart, and high waters remain.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Thousands of homes have been damaged or destroyed on the Abaco Islands\n\nHealth Minister Duane Sands told the Washington Post 17 had died in the Abaco Islands and three on Grand Bahama. These figures are reportedly expected to rise as rescuers search through the devastated country.\n\n\"There's nothing left in most of Marsh Harbour,\" said Alicia Cook, who evacuated from the area in the Abaco Islands. \"People are starting to panic: pillaging, looting.\"\n\nImage copyright AFP/Getty Image caption Rescue and relief efforts are underway to help those affected in the Bahamas\n\nBob Cornea also spoke to the BBC in the capital Nassau after being evacuated from Marsh Harbour. He said he and his wife took shelter on the second storey of their son's house.\n\n\"Water was up to my neck. It stayed like that for two or three hours... My son... he got us out and we got over to safety.\n\n\"We've been through all kinds of hurricanes, all kinds of storms: never anything that bad. I mean, it was like we were standing in the middle of the ocean. That's what it looked like. Waves, the water just crashing in over us. Horrifying. Absolutely horrifying.\"\n\nThe British Royal Navy vessel RFA Mounts Bay has begun landing personnel and emergency aid to the Abacos. Helicopters and three UK humanitarian experts have been helping to co-ordinate the rescue response.\n\nInteractive See extent of flooding in Abaco Islands caused by Hurricane Dorian After Dorian Before Dorian\n\nBringing in aid to Grand Bahama has been hampered by severe damage to its airport.\n\nThe International Red Cross fears 45% of homes on Grand Bahama and the Abacos - some 13,000 properties - have been severely damaged or destroyed.\n\nSome 70,000 people are in \"immediate need\" of aid, UN officials said.\n\nIs climate change making hurricanes worse?\n\nScientists cannot say whether climate change is increasing the number of hurricanes, but the ones that do happen are likely to be more powerful and more destructive because of our warming climate, says BBC Weather's Tomasz Schafernaker.\n\nHere's why:\n\nAn increase in sea surface temperatures strengthens the wind speeds within storms and also raises the amount of precipitation a hurricane will dump\n\nSea levels are expected to increase by one to four feet over the next century, bringing the potential of far worse damage from sea surges and coastal flooding during storms\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Hurricanes and climate change\n\nUse our guide to see how these deadly storms form, their devastating effects and how they are measured:\n\nHurricanes A guide to the world's deadliest storms Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters.\n\nWarm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. \"Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. Well, we're about to get punched in the face.\"\n\nFlorida Mayor Bob Buckhorn, ahead of Hurricane Irma (2017) The central eye of calmer weather is surrounded by a wall of rainstorms.\n\nThis eyewall has the fastest winds below it and violent currents of air rising through it. A mound of water piles up below the eye which is unleashed as the storm reaches land.\n\nThese storm surges can cause more damage from flooding than the winds. \"Urgent warning about the rapid rise of water on the SW FL coast with the passage of #Irma's eye. MOVE AWAY FROM THE WATER!\"\n\nTweet from the National Hurricane Center The size of hurricanes is mainly measured by the Saffir-Simpson scale - other scales are used in Asia Pacific and Australia. Winds 119-153km/h\n\nSome minor flooding, little structural damage.\n\nStorm surge +1.2m-1.5m Winds 154-177km/h\n\nRoofs and trees could be damaged.\n\nStorm surge +1.8m-2.4m Winds 178-208km/h\n\nHouses suffer damage, severe flooding\n\nStorm surge +2.7m-3.7m Hurricane Sandy (2012) caused $71bn damage in the Caribbean and New York Winds 209-251km/h\n\nSome roofs destroyed and major structural damage to houses.\n\nStorm surge +4m-5.5m Hurricane Ike (2008) hit Caribbean islands and Louisiana and was blamed for at least 195 deaths Winds 252km/h+\n\nSerious damage to buildings, severe flooding further inland.\n\nStorm surge +5.5m Hurricane Irma (2017) caused devastation in Caribbean islands, leaving thousands homeless \"For everyone thinking they can ride this storm out, I have news for you: that will be one of the biggest mistakes you can make in your life.\"\n\nMayor of New Orleans Ray Nagin ahead of Hurricane Gustav, 2008 Click arrow to proceed Loading ...
