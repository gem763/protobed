How quickly the conductor of one of the finest team goals of the season can become the architect of a devastating downfall.\n\nDeclan Rice is already the darling of these parts. The West Ham faithful need no invitation to toast their young midfield general. There was little they could do but marvel on Saturday night, though, when Rice orchestrated a 14-pass move that tore Crystal Palace apart and put Manuel Pellegrini's side on course for another three points.\n\nSebastian Haller's name is on the scoresheet but all he did was apply the finishing touches after the home side had swept from one end of the pitch to the other.\n\nJordan Ayew's last-gasp tap in edged Crystal Palace to victory against London rivals West Ham\n\nThe Palace striker slotted beneath Roberto following Martin Kelly's header across goal\n\nThe video assistant referee checked Ayew's goal for offside and allowed the goal to stand\n\nMATCH FACTS West Ham (4-1-4-1): Roberto 6; Fredericks 6.5, Cresswell 6 (Zabaleta 84), Ogbonna 6, Diop 6; Rice 6.5; Yarmolenko 7 (Wilshere 78), Lanzini 6 (Fornals 68), Noble 6.5, Anderson 6.5; Haller 7 Subs not used: Martin, Balbuena, Snodgrass, Ajeti Gosls: Haller 54 Yellow cards: Yarmolenko, Haller, Fredericks Crystal Palace (4-3-3): (Guaita 7, Ward 7, Van Aanholt 6.5, Kelly 6.5, Cahill 6.5; McArthur 6.5, Kouyate 6, McCarthy 6 (Townsend 81); Zaha 6.5, Ayew 6.5 (Benteke), Schlupp 5.5 Subs not used: Hennessey, Tomkins, Dann, Meyer, Camarasa Goals: Van Aanholt 63, Ayew 87 Yellow cards: Ward, Benteke Att: 59,912 Referee: Michael Oliver 7\n\nWithin seven minutes Rice at the centre of things once more. This time, though, the midfielder was the fall-guy. He blocked a cross with a raised arm, gifting Patrick van Aanholt the chance to level the scores from the spot. That was how it remained until the final few minutes, when Palace stole the points through Jordan Ayew's late goal. The striker turned home Martin Kelly's header but the goal was originally ruled out for offside. Out came the rulers as VAR checked two razor-tight calls. Eventually it was given and Palace had beaten West Ham for the first time in nine league meetings.\n\nPellegrini refused to criticise the referee, preferring instead to rue missed chances.\n\n'I don't really remember one chance of Palace shooting,' he said. 'I think we did all to win this game.'\n\nOn whether Rice should have kept his arm down, he added: 'Yes of course, maybe. But it's his instant reaction\u2026 I didn't think he wanted to block the ball. ' For a few hours, at least, fourth-place Palace are the kings of London. Only Manchester City and Liverpool can better their tally of 25 away points in 2019.\n\nBut still their manager is refusing to get carried away.\n\nPatrick van Aanholt's penalty had hauled the visitors back on to level terms on the hour mark\n\nThe Crystal Palace full back buried the penalty home from 12 yards after Declan Rice's handball\n\n'It's nice to start reasonably well and even be up with the front runners for a while but you know full well you have to keep up that pace and keep doing the things you're doing,' he said.\n\n'We don't have a big squad\u2026 but if we can keep our heads above water and get to the January transfer window I'm rather hoping we'll be able to do something about that.'\n\nHodgson admitted his players can probably give him no more. Pellegrini, meanwhile will know this was one his let slip. They had more than enough chances to score before Haller's opener. Instead, they tasted defeat for the first time in seven games. Haller's shot cannoned off Vicente Guaita from close range, while Manuel Lanzini and Angelo Ogbonna both went close. With the score goalless, Palace had their moments, too.\n\nShortly before the break Wilfried Zaha turned Aaron Cresswell too easily inside the area and put the ball on a plate for Jeffrey Schlupp. A few yards out with the goal gaping, however Schlupp scuffed his shot, allowing Ryan Fredericks to scramble back and clear off the line.\n\nSebastien Haller had opened the scoring for West Ham in their victory against Palace\n\nThe French frontman tucked a finish through Vincente Guaita from inside the penalty area\n\nWhen the breakthrough did come, it was worth the wait.\n\nThe move began deep in West Ham territory, with Cresswell, Anderson and Rice hounded by a pack of Palace players. But they unpicked the lock and Rice found Noble, who played in Anderson down the left hand side. He did well to keep the ball and find Lanzini.\n\nAcross it went to Rice, to Yarmolenko and finally out to Fredericks whose low cross was turned home by Haller. That was as good as it got. Not long after, Cheikhou Kouyate's cross struck Rice's arm from close range. He protested his innocence but neither Michael Oliver nor VAR were in doubt.\n\nVan Aanholt set up a tantalising last few 27 minutes but most of those passed without incident, until Kelly rose highest to feed Ayew. The London Stadium stood still for several minutes, and then emptied almost as quickly as West Ham's fate was sealed.\n\nBoth sides carved out several chances in the first half but were unable to break the deadlock\n\nTwo of the Premier League's most experienced managers clashed in the capital on Saturday\n\nJames McCarthy's stinging drive from the edge of the penalty area was denied by Roberto", "description": "DANIEL MATTHEWS AT THE LONDON STADIUM: How quickly bubbles can burst.
