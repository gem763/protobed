In quarter three his favourability rating was 29% \u2013 the highest in the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was all through the period of the Zuma Must Fall movement. During this movement Maimane had the highest favourability. And what we see is that it was in quarter three of 2017 just before CR17 [Cyril Ramaphosa\u2019s campaign to be elected ANC president], that Ramaphosa\u2019s favourability rose above Maimane\u2019s,\u201d said Reza Omar, strategic research director at Citizen Surveys.\n\n\u201cBut before that, Maimane was at the top. For a whole nine months \u2026 And for the past two and a half years Maimane has been very consistent in terms of favourability, which has remained at 29% for a very long time.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Zuma Must Fall movement \u2013 which started after former president Jacob Zuma removed Nhlanhla Nene as finance minister in early December 2016, a move that saw the rand crash through the R15/$ mark, carried on well into 2017.\n\nOn December 16 2016, South Africans held marches in different cities for people to demonstrate their anger with Zuma\u2019s decision, their unhappiness with his leadership and call for his resignation.\n\n\n\nIn April 2017 political parties including the DA, EFF, Cope and the UDM marched to the Union Buildings in support of the movement and calling for the former president\u2019s resignation.\n\nHowever in terms of which political parties were seen to be linked to critical challenges in South Africa, according to data collected in Q1 of 2019 \u2013 during the election period \u2013 Maimane\u2019s former party \u201chad no strong associations with solving any of South Africa\u2019s most important problems\u201d.\n\nOmar explained: \u201cWhat this shows is that when we asked the question \u2018which political party is best at solving problems?\u2019, the ANC was associated with maintaining roads, providing water and providing electricity, basic service delivery.\n\nThe most important problem facing South Africa is unemployment and no political party was associated with being able to create jobs Reza Omar, strategic research director, Citizen Surveys\n\n\u201cThe EFF was associated with being able to reduce corruption. The DA had no strong associations.\u201d\n\nAccording to the survey no political party was associated with creating jobs.\n\n\u201cThe most important problem facing South Africa is unemployment and no political party was associated with being able to create jobs,\u201d said Omar.\n\nHaving collated data from \u201cface-to-face interviews with a nationally-representative sample of 1 300 respondents a month, of the population 18 and older\u201d Citizen Surveys said that \"Maimane currently leads EFF leader Julius Malema by 4%\u201d.", "description": "Mmusi Maimane has enjoyed moments of being the most favoured of all the political party leaders in the country.", "authors": ["Palesa Dlamini"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9515/faff5eec38ae417aa66d88e007b062d1.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
