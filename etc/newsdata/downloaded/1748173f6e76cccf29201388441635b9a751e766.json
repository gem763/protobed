Now, it can feel as if everybody is trying to quit.\n\nAmid reports of at least 805 cases of vaping-related lung injury in 46 states and one US territory, states including New York, Massachusetts, Michigan and Rhode Island have all banned sales of flavored electronic cigarette products.\n\nIn California, where e-cigarette giant Juul Labs is headquartered, the matter has particularly hit home, with the state\u2019s department of public health issuing an advisory this week urging \u201ceveryone to refrain from vaping\u201d and the governor launching a $20m public awareness campaign about the dangers of it.\n\nEven Donald Trump is developing a federal flavored e-cigarette ban.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been touted as safer than cigarettes, even to the extreme of being safe, period,\u201d said John Maa, a past president of the San Francisco Marin Medical Society. \u201cBut we don\u2019t really know what the effects of chronic vaping is on your lungs.\u201d\n\nAnd yet it was not that long ago that vaping was widely accepted as the healthier alternative to cigarettes.\n\nIs Juul the new big tobacco? Wave of lawsuits signal familiar problems Read more\n\nWhen e-cigarettes entered the US marketplace in about 2007, they were billed as a tool to help smokers quit smoking . Like cigarettes, they contain nicotine, but not its parent compound, tobacco, which kills up to half its users.\n\nTo many, the process of vaping also felt better than smoking and with a wide variety in flavors, they appealed to an audience much wider than smokers. \u201cSomeone who doesn\u2019t smoke might pick up a cigarette, take a few puffs, cough, and question why they\u2019re doing it,\u201d Maa said. \u201cBut with an electronic cigarette, it\u2019s tasty. It\u2019s like having a lollipop.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Vaping products come in a wide variety of flavors, to appeal to a much wider audience.

The shift coincided with the launch of Juul, the immensely popular small vape developed in San Francisco that would soon conquer the world. In hundreds of lawsuits filed in federal and local courts across the US, attorneys blame Juul for the rise in youth vaping, pointing to a targeted marketing campaign directed at kids and young adults.\n\nE-cigarette use among middle and high school students increased 900% from 2011 to 2015, according to the surgeon general, with roughly 4.9 million teens using e-cigarettes in 2018 \u2013 an increase of 1.5 million from the year before.\n\nAnd in far too many cases, the kids didn\u2019t know what they were doing. Almost two-thirds of Juul users ages 15 to 24 surveyed by the Truth Initiative in 2018 did not know that their Juuls contained highly addictive nicotine, a substance known to be particularly harmful for youth whose brains are still developing.\n\n\u201cThese kids were trying them out because they tasted nice,\u201d said Mahzad Hite, an attorney working on a number of personal injury lawsuits against Juul. \u201cNicotine can have long lasting and sometimes permanent effects on the brain of people under the age of 26. We\u2019re seeing kids who were honor students who are now failing their classes. We\u2019re seeing kids who were athletes who can longer perform.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest US attorneys blame Juul for the rise in youth vaping. Photograph: Seth Wenig/Associated Press\n\nHite works at the San Francisco-based law firm Levin Simes Abrams, which has filed 60 lawsuits against Juul in the past months.\n\n\u201cThe science is developing, and I think that\u2019s why we\u2019re seeing so many reports now, even though vaping has been around for years,\u201d said attorney Rachel Abrams. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing people going in with lung issues and not knowing what\u2019s contributing to them and not willing to admit that they\u2019re vaping.\u201d\n\nAbrams and Hite represent clients who have ended up in the hospital because of lung issues believed to have been caused by vaping. Some of their clients had such severe cases of pneumonia that they had to be intubated, or rushed to the emergency room. They also represent the family of a 14-year-old boy who died of an asthma attack he had while vaping.\n\nIn many cases, they said, it took time before their clients realized the role vaping may have played in their health issues. Medical providers have long been asking patients questions about smoking, but only recently have they begun asking if they vape, the lawyers said.\n\nAlthough it may seem like all these reports of vaping-related lung injuries are suddenly coming out of the woodwork, Hite believes it is more likely that these cases have been underreported.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re only just now connecting the dots,\u201d Abrams said. \u201cWe\u2019re using the word epidemic, and it truly is. I think we\u2019re just seeing the tip of the iceberg.\u201d\n\nIn June, San Francisco \u2013 where Juul is headquartered \u2013 became the first US city to ban the sale of e-cigarettes. Juul has since spent $11.5m to promote a local ballot measure to overturn the ban, depositing workers with signs outside bus stations and flooding mailboxes with literature proclaiming that overturning the ban would stop youth vaping.\n\nEarlier this month, the Food and Drug Administration issued a warning letter to to the company, saying it had not received federal approval to promote and sell its vaping products as a healthier option.\n\nJuul did not return requests for comment. In testifying before Congress in July, however, the company admitted to presenting the product at a school and marketing it as \u201cmuch safer than cigarettes\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest In congressional testimony, Juul admitted to marketing their product as \u2018much safer than cigarettes\u2019.

On Thursday, San Joaquin County district attorney Tori Salazar announced that she was launching both a criminal and civil investigation into Juul, looking into the company\u2019s marketing and targeting of youth.\n\nThe US Federal Trade Commission is also investigating whether Juul used deceptive social marketing that targeted minors.\n\nOn Wednesday, Juul\u2019s chief executive Kevin Burns stepped down and was replaced by KC Crosthwaite, chief strategy officer at Altria, the tobacco giant that is Juul\u2019s largest shareholder.\n\n\u201cI have long believed in a future where adult smokers overwhelmingly choose alternative products like Juul,\u201d Crosthwaite said in a statement. \u201cThat has been this company\u2019s mission since it was founded, and it has taken great strides in that direction. Unfortunately, today that future is at risk due to unacceptable levels of youth usage and eroding public confidence in our industry. Against that backdrop, we must strive to work with regulators, policymakers and other stakeholders, and earn the trust of the societies in which we operate.\u201d\n\nEffective immediately, the company suspended all broadcast, print and digital product advertising in the US.\n\n\u201cJuul is losing a lot of steam as more reports come out and more information gets made public,\u201d Abrams said. \u201cI think California and San Francisco was ahead of the curve and I think the rest of the nation is going to catch up in banning them.\u201d", "description": "Several states have enacted a ban on sales of vaping products amid more than 800 reports of lung injuries nationwide", "authors": ["Vivian Ho"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/826b25b449114454e2993010ee25958404a59694/0_41_1669_1001/master/1669.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=978d2b2c225498e50889ac83a511e1bd", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
