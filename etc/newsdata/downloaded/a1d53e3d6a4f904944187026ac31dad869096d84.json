Was it historically accurate? Of course. Was there an uptick in requests for it at Park Slope barber shops in the ensuing months? We\u2019re assuming yes. But, according to the film\u2019s hair stylist Alessandro Bertolazzi, it took a bit of convincing for Chalamet to go all-in on the cut, given that our boy Lil Timmy Tim really loves his mop of curly follicles.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a really good guy and takes care of himself. He loved his hair,\u201d Bertolazzi told Vulture in a recent interview. \u201cSometimes it seemed his hair was more important than himself. I don\u2019t know if he wanted to cry or kill me in the beginning, but in the end, he realized how important the haircut was to his character. Thank God there were other people around me that supported me. We cut one inch and he was like, That\u2019s enough, that\u2019s enough! No, Timoth\u00e9e, it was just the beginning, we\u2019ve gotta keep going.\u201d\n\nWe made an acorn cut on Timoth\u00e9e, because that was the only way.\n\nWhile the idea of fitting Chalamet for a wig was floated around for a bit, Bertolazzi and his team never relented on pushing for an actual cut, given that the actor had a perfect length of hair to achieve such a look. (The two other leading men in the film, Robert Pattinson and Ben Mendelsohn, indeed wore wigs to accommodate longer, wavier hairstyles.) \u201cWe made an acorn cut on Timoth\u00e9e, because that was the only way. We had to do a dramatic, visible transformation,\u201d Bertolazzi said. \u201cHenry was a party boy who became king. I fought for that cut, we needed that cut. Timoth\u00e9e is a sex symbol, even with that dramatic haircut. He\u2019s a cool guy. We did many tests to show the haircuts of the time, and everybody was worried about how dramatic the haircut was going to be. You know when you\u2019re sure about something? I was more than sure. This is my job.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, Bertolazzi added that the inspiration for the main acorn lewk came from the Middle Ages\u2019 hottest trend epicenter: The church. \u201cWhen you do a movie, you need to make something that pleases the actors and the egos of the actors. It\u2019s not the same with period movies,\u201d he explained. \u201cThis one was simple. In the Middle Ages, there was no \u2018status\u2019 of beauty. It didn\u2019t exist. People didn\u2019t care about beauty, both the common folks and the royals. The only reference was the church. The church made the rules. The men looked like priests or monks, and women looked like nuns.\u201d Conveniently, Halloween is next week!", "description": "Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet has a particularly stylish haircut in Netflix\u2019s The King.
