Chuck Grassley this week. The 38 are current and former State Department officials but were not identified.\n\nThe investigation covered 33,000 emails that Clinton turned over for review after her use of the private email account became public. The department said it found a total of 588 violations involving information then or now deemed to be classified, but could not assign fault in 497 cases.\n\nFor current and former officials, culpability means the violations will be noted in their files and will be considered when they apply for or go to renew security clearances. For current officials, there could also be some kind of disciplinary action. But it wasn't immediately clear what that would be.\n\nThe department began the review in 2016 after declaring 22 emails from Clinton's private server to be \"top secret.\" Clinton was then running for president against Donald Trump, and the now-president made the server a major focus of his campaign.\n\nThen-FBI Director James Comey held a news conference that year in which he criticized Clinton as \"extremely careless\" in her use of the private email server as secretary of state but said the FBI would not recommend charges.\n\nThe Justice Department's inspector general said FBI specialists did not find evidence that the server had been hacked, with one forensics agent saying he felt \"fairly confident that there wasn't an intrusion.\"\n\nGrassley started investigating Clinton's email server in 2017, when he was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. The Iowa Republican has been critical of Clinton's handling of classified information and urged administrative sanctions.", "description": "The State Department has completed its internal investigation into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's use of private email and found violations by 38 people, some of whom may face disciplinary action.
