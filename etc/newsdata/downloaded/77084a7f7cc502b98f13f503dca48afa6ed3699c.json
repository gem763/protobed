That would seem to be the message from two of Biden\u2019s top people \u2013 senior adviser Anita Dunn and deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield. They have sent a letter to the major television networks demanding that Rudy no longer be booked as a guest on news shows.\n\nWhile this looks like authoritarianism that the left frequently uses against those who do not fall in line, the demand also reminds us of a time when Barack Obama encouraged Democrats to boycott Fox News Channel (FNC). If the left is afraid of the truth, or simply of a different point of view, the source of that friction must be shut down. There is no room for more than one point of view.\n\nInterestingly enough, Anita Dunn is in the middle of delegitimatizing Rudy now. She also played a role in the FNC boycott during the early days of the Obama administration. She was the White House communications director. Now she and Bedingfield are trying to silence Rudy Guiliani. They accuse Guiliani, President Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, of spreading \u201cfalse, debunked conspiracy theories\u201d.\n\n\u201cBy giving him your air time, you are allowing him to introduce increasingly unhinged, unfounded and desperate lies into the national conversation.\u201d \u201cWe write to demand that in service to the facts, you no longer book Rudy Giuliani,\u201d they continued, suggesting that the Trump surrogate has \u201cdemonstrated that he will knowingly and willingly lie in order to advance his own narrative.\u201d\n\nThat is a standard accusation these days. Both sides of the aisle accuse the other of lying if what is being said isn\u2019t jiving with a narrative. In this case, Team Biden is facing a downward trend in Uncle Joe\u2019s campaign and his staff is worried. So, their inclination is to simply demand that their friends in the media stop interviewing the man who goes on television and tells viewers what he wants them to know about whatever controversy is in the news \u2013 right now it is Ukraine.\n\nI suppose this is a natural progression for Biden\u2019s campaign. Remember recently when Biden jabbed his finger in the face of FNC\u2019s reporter Peter Doocy and told him to \u201cask the right question\u201d? Kate Bedingfield was quite proud of her boss for that remark and tweeted the exchange out. Biden also said he\u2019d \u201cbeat Trump like a drum\u201d.\n\nSpeaking of unhinged behavior, as Biden\u2019s campaign does of Rudy, I thought at the time that Biden sounded unhinged with Doocy and posted it on Twitter (you can follow me @penguinponders). I found Bedingfield\u2019s tweet about the exchange to be odd but clearly she was proud of the candidate.\n\nAs a side note, I watch Showtime\u2019s The Circus, a semi-documentary style series that records the candidates out on the trail and in candid interviews. It\u2019s all from a liberal, anti-Trump point of view. Two liberal reporters and one GOP Never-Trump consultant are the \u201ctalent\u201d in the show. When the show included Biden\u2019s exchange with Doocy in that gaggle with reporters in Iowa, the \u201cask the right question\u201d statement was edited out. When I tweeted about that, I had a little exchange with one of the three privately, in DM. The GOP consultant tried to tell me I had it wrong, that Biden\u2019s \u201cask the right question\u201d incident happened the next day. He was wrong and there is no defense for the edit, other than to help Joe Biden. This is why Americans don\u2019t trust reporters.\n\nApparently Team Biden didn\u2019t like Rudy\u2019s performances in service to his client as he appeared on Sunday morning shows. Rudy is a no-nonsense kind of guy and doesn\u2019t sit idly by to let show hosts spin events and narratives to make Democrats look better \u2013 in this case, it was the alleged Biden family corruption with their dealings in Ukraine. This Ukraine story is as toxic for Biden as it may be for Trump. The media didn\u2019t bother to do any investigating about Biden threatening to withhold aid to Ukraine during the Obama administration, nor did they uncover his son Hunter\u2019s sweet deal with the Ukrainian gas company. Reporters only awakened from their 8-year slumber during two Obama terms when Trump won the election.\n\nGiuliani appeared on Sunday on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d and CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d with the shows\u2019 hosts, George Stephanopoulos and Margaret Brennan, respectively, among the recipients of the letter from the Biden campaign. The letter was sent to more than a dozen TV news executives and journalists, including the presidents of CNN (Jeff Zucker), Fox News (Suzanne Scott), MSNBC (Phil Griffin), ABC News (James Goldston), NBC News (Noah Oppenheim) and CBS News (Susan Zirinsky), and hosts such as CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper, NBC\u2019s Chuck Todd and Fox News\u2019 Chris Wallace.\n\nRudy Guiliani is the president\u2019s personal lawyer. He is doing his job. He sometimes goes rogue and his conversations with reporters go in different directions but he is aggressively defending President Trump and that is a good thing. Democrats are accustomed to friendly media and old Joe seems to be having trouble when he is asked legitimate questions that may be uncomfortable to answer. He isn\u2019t very quick on his feet.\n\nThe networks haven\u2019t responded to Team Biden\u2019s strongarm tactics yet. Guiliani has, as you might expect.\n\nOver the course of an hour on Sunday evening, Giuliani fired back with half a dozen posts on Twitter. \u201cJoe and Hunter Biden are clearly rattled by the affidavit showing there is a named accuser and not an anonymous source,\u201d he tweeted, without giving any details. \u201cThe Bidens have played the influence game for years and now the American people are demanding answers!\u201d Regarding the letter from the campaign, he said: \u201cThink of the Biden arrogance and entitlement to protection. They believe they own the media and they are demanding that they silence me. They know I have incriminating facts, not hearsay, because they know what they did in selling Joe\u2019s office to a Ukrainian crook.\u201d\n\nDunn and Bedingfield characterize Guiliani as a Trump surrogate when he is much more than that. He is the president\u2019s personal lawyer and he is mixed up in the Ukraine story himself. He isn\u2019t just defending Trump, he is also defending himself. Dunn and Bedingfield think the networks are damaging Biden\u2019s campaign and must have an interview with a Biden surrogate if Rudy is on air. Not just a Democrat but a campaign surrogate. Networks do that, though, so their demand falls short. Senator Coons, for example, speaks as a campaign surrogate when he appears on FNC and not just as a run-of-the-mill Democrat for balance. Many of the anchors on cable news channels often sound as though they are on the Biden campaign\u2019s payroll. Give me a break.\n\nBiden\u2019s team keeps a short leash on him. He doesn\u2019t sit for many interviews and certainly not with reporters who are not on his side of the aisle. This is a way of increasing protection from the press as his campaign hits bumpy terrain. It sure doesn\u2019t inspire confidence in the candidate and his ability to handle controversy if his team has to demand special treatment. And his campaign\u2019s strong-arming of the media is now surprisingly transparent. It should be an embarrassment that the letter was made public but it won\u2019t be to them. Remember, Bedingfield proudly tweeted his \u201cask the right question\u201d response. They think this is normal behavior. The campaign should make Biden available if he\u2019s being treated wrongly and let him defend himself.", "description": "\"Dedicated liar\"", "authors": ["Karen Townsend", "Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/GiulianiTrump.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
