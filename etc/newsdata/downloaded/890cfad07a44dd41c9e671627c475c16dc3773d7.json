Here\u2019s what you should know about pregnancy-related incontinence and how to keep your bladder healthy.\n\nUrinary incontinence during and after pregnancy is more common than you think. ~\n\nPregnancy is normally a happy time of your life, but bear in mind that there are many changes taking place in your body \u2013 including your pelvic floor and bladder.\n\nWhen you are pregnant, you will receive advice from many people who have been there themselves, but urinary leakage during and after pregnancy is not something women often talk about.\n\nWhy is urinary incontinence common during pregnancy?\n\nLeaking urine when coughing, sneezing and laughing during pregnancy is common \u2013 this leakage is called stress incontinence. The reason why it happens is because of the pressure your unborn baby places on the pelvic floor muscles, urethra and bladder. This type of stress incontinence usually goes away after your baby is born, and you should visit your doctor if leaking occurs after six weeks or more of giving birth.\n\nUrinary incontinence after pregnancy\n\nPregnancy, the type of delivery and the number of children during a woman\u2019s life all may increase her risk of incontinence.\n\nIn some cases, vaginal birth and a Caesarean section can have an effect on the pelvic floor muscles, which might cause incontinence after pregnancy as well and therefore have a much higher risk of stress incontinence than those have never given birth.\n\nLoss of bladder control after pregnancy can be caused by pelvic organ prolapse that can sometimes occur after childbirth. Your uterus is held inside your body with a collection of muscles, tissue and ligaments that form the pelvic floor. These muscles and ligaments are weakened through childbirth and during pregnancy. In some cases, especially during difficult labour, the cervix might drop towards the bottom of the vagina and place pressure on the pelvic floor, which leads to stress incontinence.\n\nIn some cases, the bladder may also sag and cause the opening of the uterus opening to stretch. This is known as cystocele.\n\nWhen you do experience urinary incontinence that doesn\u2019t clear up within six weeks after pregnancy, you should consult your doctor as you need to understand the cause of the incontinence to help determine the treatment plan, whether surgical or non-surgical.\n\nKeep your bladder and pelvic floor healthy and strong during pregnancy\n\nThere are a number of ways to keep your bladder healthy during pregnancy:\n\nDrink well: spread your drinks out during the day, don\u2019t overfill your bladder and don\u2019t become dehydrated, as this can irritate your bladder more, which can lead to more leakage.\n\nCut down on sugary drinks, fizzy drinks and juice, as well as caffeine as these may irritate the bladder.\n\nEat plenty of fibre to keep your bowel movement regular. Constipation can be a side effect of pregnancy and can also increase your risk for urinary incontinence as there is now more pressure on your pelvic floor.\n\nAvoid regular heavy lifting during pregnancy as this can weaken the pelvic floor muscles.\n\nDo exercises that can strengthen the pelvic floor. See this guide.\n\nAim for at least 30 minutes of exercise a day if your gynaecologist or doctor has cleared you. This can help combat constipation.\n\nDon\u2019t hold in urine \u2013 go to the toilet as soon as you feel the urge to urinate.\n\nImage credit: iStock", "description": "Many women experience urine leakage during pregnancy.
