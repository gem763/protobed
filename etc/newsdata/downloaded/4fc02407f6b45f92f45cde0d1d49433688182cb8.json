No wonder climate change alarmists are not willing to debate their views in public.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s experts include Will Happer, the former Cyrus Fogg Bracket professor of physics emeritus at Princeton University, recently serving on the National Security Council. Mr. Happer has been a long-term member of JASON, a private organization of scientists advising the federal government. He also served as director of the Energy Department\u2019s Office of Science.\n\nMr. Happer has long argued that carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are good for the environment, indeed essential for the survival of all life on the planet. CO2 promotes photosynthesis in plants, which is the foundation of the entire food chain. Without plants, animals would not survive.\n\nThe increasing concentration of atmospheric CO2 has produced a literal greening of the planet, supporting increased plant growth that has been photographed by satellites in orbit and measured by scientists here on Earth.\n\nRichard Lindzen is an impressive atmospheric physicist who is also advising Mr. Trump. He is formerly the longtime Alfred P. Sloan professor of meteorology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He served as an author for the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). He also authored 230 peer-reviewed papers and articles from 1965 to 2008. Mr. Happer was likely to appoint Mr. Lindzen to join him on a climate change advisory commission for the president.\n\nStill another climate expert advising Mr. Trump is Roy Spencer, principal research scientist at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, and the U.S. Science Team leader for the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) on NASA\u2019s Aqua satellite. Mr. Spencer also served as senior scientist for climate studies at NASA\u2019s Marshall Space Flight Center. Mr. Spencer received a special award from the American Meteorology Society for his work developing the methodology for U.S. satellites to monitor the global temperature of the atmosphere. Mr. Spencer was another likely Mr. Happer appointee to his climate change advisory commission for the president.\n\nStill another climate realist expert and likely Happer appointee is Patrick Michaels, a climatologist who formerly served as research professor of environmental sciences at the University of Virginia. Mr. Michaels is also a past president of the American Association of State Climatologists and a former senior fellow in environmental studies at the Cato Institute.\n\nThe most senior of Mr. Trump\u2019s experts on climate change is S. Fred Singer, an Austrian-born atmospheric physicist and emeritus professor of environmental science at the University of Virginia. Mr. Singer established the National Weather Bureau\u2019s Satellite Service Center in 1962 and authored numerous peer-reviewed papers and books on a wide variety of important scientific topics. During recent decades, he has placed special emphasis on the climate change issue.\n\nThe Heartland Institute drew heavily on Mr. Singer\u2019s work for several volumes of its peer-reviewed \u201cClimate Change Reconsidered\u201d series. \u201cClimate Change Reconsidered\u201d comprises thousands of pages of science summaries written by scientists, as well as citations to thousands of peer-reviewed studies and objective data sources.\n\nMessrs. Happer, Lindzen, Spencer, Michaels and Singer have each spoken at one or more of the Heartland Institute\u2019s 13 international conferences on climate change. Their presentations are archived on the Internet and demolish alarmist climate propaganda and alarmist lies asserting an overwhelming international scientific consensus on climate change.\n\nIt is no wonder climate alarmists realize they cannot publicly defend their hysterical views about climate change in a public debate. Greta Thunberg, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, Al Gore and other climate alarmists are all hopelessly overmatched.\n\n\u2022 Peter Ferrara, the Dunn Liberty Fellow in Economics at the Kings College in New York, is a senior fellow at the Heartland Institute and at the National Tax Limitation Foundation.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
