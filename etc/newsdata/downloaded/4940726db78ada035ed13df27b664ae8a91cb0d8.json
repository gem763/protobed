In January, China landed the first probe ever on the far side of the moon. The lander and accompanying rover have been operating since then.\n\nAn Israeli nonprofit sent a small robotic spacecraft named Beresheet to the moon, but its landing attempt in April went awry in a manner similar to Chandrayaan-2. The initial descent went as planned, but then communications were lost near the surface. It was later discovered that a command to shut off the engine was incorrectly sent.\n\nChandrayaan-2 launched in July, taking a long, fuel-efficient path to the moon. Earlier this week, the 3,200-pound lander, named Vikram after Vikram A. Sarabhai, the father of the Indian space program, separated from the orbiter and maneuvered toward the moon\u2019s surface.\n\nFifteen minutes before the planned landing, the Vikram lander was traveling at more than 2,000 miles per hour at an altitude of about 20 miles. Four of its engines fired to quickly slow it down as it headed toward its landing site on a high, flat plain near the South Pole. Later in the landing process, it appeared that Vikram was descending too fast and then data from the spacecraft ended.", "description": "The country will likely have to wait for a future mission to join the elite club of nations that have landed on the moon.", "authors": ["Jeffrey Gettleman", "Kenneth Chang", "Kai Schultz", "Hari Kumar"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/06/science/06INDIAMOON1b/06INDIAMOON1b-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
