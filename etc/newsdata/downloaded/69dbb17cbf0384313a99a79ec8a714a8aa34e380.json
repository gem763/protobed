But that\n\nsupply chain will be disrupted by the ore export ban set to\n\nstart on Jan. 1, part of Indonesia's push to develop a\n\nhigher-value domestic metal processing industry. Indonesia accounted for 26% of global nickel ore supplies\n\nlast year, according to the International Nickel Study Group\n\n(INSG), but since 2016 has ramped up production of NPI, an\n\nintermediate product containing around 10% nickel used by\n\nstainless steel mills.\n\nThe increase in NPI production has mostly come from Chinese\n\ncompanies operating in Indonesia.\n\nFrom nearly zero in 2014, Indonesia's NPI output climbed to\n\n261,000 tonnes a year in 2018, according to data from\n\nAustralia's Macquarie Group Ltd.\n\nThat could climb to as much as 530,000 tonnes in 2020,\n\naccording to estimates from Chinese trading firm Grand Flow\n\nResources.\n\n\"It is estimated that the annual increase of nickel metal\n\ncontent in NPI will be 130,000 tonnes a year. The high speed\n\nexpansion will extend from 2020 to 2021,\" said Wang Chongfeng,\n\nan analyst at Grand Flow Resources.\n\nEnergy and minerals consultants Wood Mackenzie forecast that\n\nby 2021, Indonesian NPI output will surpass China's, which is\n\nestimated at 570,000 tonnes this year.\n\n\"It is possible some, and ultimately all, of the lost NPI\n\nproduction in China could be offset by NPI production increase\n\nin Indonesia \u2013 but this will take some time,\" said analyst Linda\n\nZhang of Wood Mackenzie.\n\nThe expected disruption of ore supply and the resulting\n\ncurtailment of Chinese NPI output has caused nickel prices to\n\nsurge.\n\nLondon nickel CMNI3 rose to a five-year high on Monday and\n\nhas leaped over 70% this year, while Shanghai nickel SNIcv1\n\nhit a record as markets feared the stainless steel industry,\n\nwhich consumes 70% of global nickel output, will lack supplies.\n\nIndonesia in 2018 produced 289,868 tonnes of primary nickel,\n\nwhich includes NPI and other nickel products, a 42% surge from a\n\nyear earlier, but consumed a lot of that extra tonnage itself,\n\nutilising 165,000 tonnes in 2018, INSG data showed.\n\nThat additional metal processing is also leading to higher\n\noutput of stainless steel from Indonesia, exports of which rose\n\nsharply in 2018 and are expected to continue climbing.\n\n\n\nWith metal stocks for delivery on the London and Shanghai\n\nexchanges being tight, stockpiling by Chinese NPI producers\n\ncould underpin market sentiment for the coming months, but \"time\n\nis limited,\" said Xu Aidong, Antaike's chief nickel analyst.\n\nSNI-TOTAL-W MNISTX-TOTAL\n\nThe extent of any enduring supply shortage depends on how\n\nquickly other ore exporters crank up output and shipments in\n\nresponse to the elevated prices.\n\nPhilippine nickel miners are expected to boost ore\n\nproduction next year, but may still not be able to fill up the\n\nsupply gap. \"There's a decent chance that... the Philippines ramp up a\n\nlittle bit more but not huge amount. We're talking maybe 50,000\n\ntonnes,\" said BMO's commodities research director Colin\n\nHamilton.\n\nAnalysts said the Philippines faced the challenge of the\n\napproaching rainy season, stricter emissions controls coming\n\ninto effect, and limited new mine capacity.\n\nOther ore producers in Australia, Canada, Russia and New\n\nCaledonia are also expected to attempt to raise output, but face\n\nsimilar constraints.\n\n\"Ore from Indonesia could not be readily be replaced from\n\nPhilippines or any other ore exporting country, and the only\n\npossible outcome is a decline in NPI production in China,\" said\n\nWood Mackenzie's Zhang.\n\n\n\nPrimary nickel production by top producers https://tmsnrt.rs/2kb7ioY\n\nNickel mine and primary metal production by top producers https://tmsnrt.rs/2kc4OXq\n\nGlobal nickel prices surge on Indonesian ore export ban, tight\n\nexchange stocks https://tmsnrt.rs/2k8C5CN\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n\n", "description": "RPT-UPDATE 1-Short-term pain, long-term gain: Indonesia could plug nickel pig iron gap", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/indicatornews_2_800x533_L_1412601599.jpg"}
