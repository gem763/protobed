Addazio said Brown will have surgery within the next few days. The injury is not expected to be career-ending.\n\nBrown was injured in the second quarter of the Eagles\u2019 41-39 loss to Louisville on Oct. 5. In six games this season, he had 1,250 yards passing, nine touchdowns and two interceptions. He also rushed for 126 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nSophomore Dennis Grosel, who replaced Brown during the Louisville game and threw for three touchdowns, is expected to start when Boston College (3-3) hosts N.C. State on Saturday.\n\nThis is the second season-ending injury Brown has suffered during his career. He was the starter in 2017 when he suffered a knee injury that kept him out the rest of the year.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Boston College junior quarterback Anthony Brown will miss the rest of the season with a leg injury.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
