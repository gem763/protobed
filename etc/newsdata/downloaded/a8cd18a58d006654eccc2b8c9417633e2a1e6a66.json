Photo: Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call via Getty Images\n\nMassachusetts representative Ayanna Pressley plans to introduce a resolution Tuesday calling for impeachment hearings of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who finds himself once again at the center of a decades-old allegation of sexual misconduct.\n\n\u201cSexual predators do not deserve a seat on the nation\u2019s highest court and Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation process set a dangerous precedent,\u201d Pressley said in a statement to WBUR. \u201cWe must demand justice for survivors and hold Kavanaugh accountable for his actions.\u201d\n\nThe two-page resolution, which Politico obtained early, calls on the House Judiciary Committee to look into whether the newest Supreme Court justice should be removed from his seat and grants the committee subpoena power in its quest to answer that question.\n\nPressley\u2019s resolution comes after the New York Times published an excerpt from a book titled The Education of Brett Kavanaugh. Written by two Times reporters, Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly, the book adds further support to claims made during Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation hearings that he exposed himself to a woman named Deborah Ramirez when they were both students at Yale. It also details a previously unreported allegation of sexual misconduct at Yale. The calls for Kavanaugh\u2019s impeachment came quickly after the report was published, with several Democratic candidates for the presidency leading the way.\n\nElizabeth Warren tweeted, \u201cLike the man who appointed him, Kavanaugh should be impeached.\u201d Kamala Harris, Beto O\u2019Rourke, and Juli\u00e1n Castro all tweeted something similar, all pointing out that they believe Kavanaugh lied under oath.\n\nThe fervor seemed to die down after the Times amended its story to note that the woman at the center of the new allegation does not remember the incident and declined to speak to reporters about it. As the Washington Post noted on Tuesday, the book also includes new details that call Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s account into question. Blasey Ford said her friend Leland Keyser attended the high school party where she was sexually assaulted. Keyser did not testify during the Kavanaugh hearings, telling investigators that she believed Ford but could not recall the night in question. But in an interview with Pogrebin and Kelly, Keyser makes it clear that she now questions Blasey Ford\u2019s story. \u201cThose facts together I don\u2019t recollect, and it just doesn\u2019t make any sense,\u201d Keyser said.\n\nPressley\u2019s eagerness to start the process of impeaching Kavanaugh is not being welcomed by many of the leaders of her own party. \u201cGet real,\u201d Democratic senator Dick Durbin told Politico about the push to remove Kavanaugh. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get beyond this \u2018Impeachment is the answer to every problem.\u2019 It\u2019s not realistic.\u201d\n\nMore importantly, Jerry Nadler, who chairs the House Judiciary Committee, says he has no interest in talking about impeaching Kavanaugh. Instead, he said Monday, the committee will be \u201cconcentrating our resources on determining whether to impeach the president.\u201d\n\nThis post was updated to include new details on Leland Keyser.", "description": "Democratic Representative Ayanna Pressley plans to introduce a resolution to being impeachment of Brett Kavanaugh but leaders in her own party are not interested.", "authors": ["Adam K.
