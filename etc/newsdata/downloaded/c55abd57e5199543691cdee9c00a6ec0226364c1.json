They were used as evidence that Iraq was obtaining weapons of mass destruction, and justification for the 2003 war.\n\nIn July of that year, the former diplomat wrote in the New York Times: \"I have little choice but to conclude that some of the intelligence related to Iraq's nuclear weapons programme was twisted to exaggerate the Iraqi threat.\"\n\nThe following week, conservative columnist Robert Novak reported that part of the reason Mr Wilson had been given the Niger mission was that his wife - a CIA agent - recommended him.\n\nMs Plame, whose work required secrecy, was forced to resign from the service. It was seen by many as an act of revenge against Mr Wilson by the Bush administration.\n\n'Heart of a lion'\n\nIn subsequent years, the couple spoke of having their lives turned upside down by what had happened. Speaking to the New York Times after her husband's death, Ms Plame described her former husband as \"an American hero\" with the \"heart of a lion\".\n\nShe said his actions were not motivated by his Democratic sympathies.\n\n\"He did it because he felt it was his responsibility as a citizen,\" she said. \"It was not done out of partisan motivation, despite how it was spun.\"", "description": "Joseph Wilson is known for disproving claims that Saddam Hussein bought uranium in Niger.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/F6EA/production/_109001236_mediaitem109001235.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
