Here\u2019s what you need to ensure that your search reaps results in no time.\n\nMany people who find themselves in the position of looking for new work will tell you that finding a new job is a time-consuming process that often feels fruitless and exhausting.\n\nFor some, getting that new post can take a good few months (months you don't really have to spare), while others seem to obtain new work within a few weeks, and effortlessly at that.\n\nSo why is it that some people get hired so quickly?\n\nWhat advantages do they have that\u2019s helping them land that job you want? And what do you need to ensure that you stand out and are noticed more quickly than the rest of the candidates that you\u2019re competing against?\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to do:\n\nEvaluate what you want by making use of aptitude tests\n\nLooking for a new job might be stressful, but it also gives you a unique opportunity to start anew, especially if you're thinking of going in a different direction.\n\nA good idea before you even start your search \u2013 this is the part that takes up the most time, especially if you haven't done any updates \u2013 is to really consider what you want.\n\nMake use of online resources such as career aptitude tests that can help you determine possible career choices and guide you into the direction you need to go before you even search for positions.\n\nAccording to Mark Connelly from Change-management-coach.com, tests like these can\u2019t make any decisions for you , but they can help you determine and gain a better understanding of your skills and how and where they would fit best. Mark also notes that beyond that it can also give you career options that you may not have thought of yet.\n\nI took the Holland\u2019s model test and the results were pretty apt for my line of work. It also gave me a lot of compelling options that I would otherwise have disregarded.\n\nIn doing so, you won't blindly search for just any job \u2013 which many people often resort to because they feel that the more jobs you apply for, the better their chances. It\u2019s actually all about developing and having a game plan.\n\nA while back, at my previous work, we engaged in workshop sessions where part of the programme was to determine which personality type we fit into based on a colour test.\n\nIt seemed a bit ridiculous at the time, but it turns out that, according to M.J. Grueso from Psychology.Knoji.com, the four colours (blue, green, yellow and red) help us how to understand and interact with our colleagues.\n\nBut, it's not just about understanding interaction, it's also about using that knowledge and insight about yourself to find out what kind of work and office culture suits you best.\n\nBy establishing what you want, you can narrow down your search on job boards because you\u2019ll have a clearer idea of what you really want in terms of both work and office culture.\n\nOther good ways to ensure that you\u2019re prepared before you start your search is to ensure that your CV and cover letter is updated. And remember to adjust and tailor your CV to each position that you\u2019re applying for. Generic resumes don\u2019t entice recruiters.\n\nHarness the power of social media\n\nSocial networks like Twitter, Facebook and Instagram have morphed from merely being a hotspot where users can engage with each other, to sites where you can also find exciting work opportunities.\n\nWith the rise of influencer culture, promoting yourself through social media seems to be the way to go.\n\nJust a few days ago, someone on my timeline tweeted that he was available for freelance copywriting and editing. Within a matter of minutes, there were several retweets and a good number of responses that promised referrals and, in other cases, were potential clients.\n\nOf course, social media has the power to boost your image, but what you post and how you use it can be subjected to scrutiny. Make sure that when you\u2019re about to embark on a job hunt, that you\u2019ve removed anything that could jeopardise your chances of landing that job.\n\nREAD MORE: Why a career change can make you happier\n\nFind like-minded individuals and network, network, network. Looking for a new job isn't just about browsing for posts online. It's about getting yourself out there and making it known that you're looking for a job.\n\nDon\u2019t just find people within the industry to talk to (although that\u2019s always a good thing), but surround yourself with people who may be in the same boat as you. According to J.T O\u2019Donnell from Inc.com, the best advice you can get when it comes to finding a new job is from fellow job-seekers \u2013 especially if you've been in one position for years and feel out of your depths now that you're venturing into the unknown.\n\nWhile you want to get industry-specific advice, getting help from people who are currently job-hunting within the same field can help you in terms of exchanging tips and tricks that would make navigating your job hunt easier.\n\nNot only that, but having someone within your peer group or community know that you're looking for a new post means that they'd be able to send any relevant job posts and listings your way, thereby helping to make your job hunt that much faster.\n\nWriter | Tammy February", "description": "Looking for a new job but don\u2019t have much time on your hands?
