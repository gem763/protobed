Instead temporary migrants should be made to buy health insurance, he said.\n\nThe surcharge was introduced by the Coalition Government in April 2015 when it was set at just \u00a3200 a year \u2013 or \u00a3150 for students. At the time, Ministers said it would ensure visitors on short-term visas made a 'fair contribution' to NHS coffers. They pointed out that before its introduction, temporary migrants could legally access NHS services for nothing.\n\nBut last year civil servants calculated that each IHS payer was costing the NHS between \u00a3470 and \u00a3480 a year on average. Ministers doubled the charges last February to 'better reflect' the true cost.\n\nCaroline Nokes MP, Immigration Minister at the time, admitted the new fees were 'still below full average cost recovery level' and remained 'a good deal for those seeking to live in the UK temporarily'. But quite how good a deal it was for them has not been fully realised \u2013 until now.\n\nBased on actual usage by IHS payers, the health department's latest modelling found that, on average, each cost \u00a388 in GP appointments, \u00a335 in dental and eye care, \u00a355 in prescriptions, \u00a3237 in hospital care including A&E, and \u00a3216 in other costs, including ambulance services, mental health and administration.\n\nAt the moment, those coming from outside Europe to visit the UK for more than six months must pay the Immigration Health Surcharge (IHS) (file image)\n\nThe \u00a3631 total was rounded down to \u00a3625. With about 630,000 people paying the IHS annually, and with just under half of them students, the surcharge brings in a little more than \u00a3200 million a year for the NHS.\n\nBut at \u00a3625 a head, IHS payers end up costing the health service just under \u00a3400 million a year. This newly revised cost is nearly \u00a3100 million more than previously thought.\n\nThe revelation comes three months after an anonymous NHS 'overseas visitor manager' claimed pregnant women and people with pre-existing health conditions such as kidney failure were travelling to the UK to exploit the NHS \u2013 quite legally \u2013 by paying the IHS.\n\nThe manager asked: 'Where else in the world can you buy yearly healthcare... for a few hundred pounds?'\n\nAny move to raise the IHS again is likely to face stiff resistance.\n\nBefore the February rise, the Immigration Law Practitioners' Association and the Joint Committee For The Welfare Of Immigrants argued doubling the fees would be 'detrimental to the NHS' \u2013 as many foreign NHS staff have to pay it.\n\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: 'The income generated from the Immigration Health Surcharge goes directly to NHS services, helping to protect and sustain our world-class healthcare system for everyone who uses it.'", "description": "A hidden shortfall to the NHS of almost \u00a3100 million caused by a temporary visitors' health charge being underpriced has been uncovered by an official analysis seen by The Mail on Sunday.", "authors": ["Stephen Adams Health Correspondent For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/01/19347254-0-image-a-27_1570320373034.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
