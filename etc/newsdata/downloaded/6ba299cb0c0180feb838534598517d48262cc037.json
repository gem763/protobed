One current senior Trump campaign official told The Daily Beast that the standard operating procedure among most staff has been to generally just \u201cignore them\u201d and not \u201cmake a big deal out of\u201d them, both to deprive them of as much press attention as possible and to avoid \u201cpissing off the crazy\u201d people.\n\nIn a particularly weird bit of Trumpworld drama that unfolded earlier this year, QAnon believers turned on and began targeting former Trump aide Sebastian Gorka after he called their beliefs \u201cGARBAGE.\u201d Since the Tampa rally, Gorka and other Trump allies have struggled to stop QAnon\u2019s spread, on the grounds that it\u2019s an embarrassment to the larger Trump coalition.\n\nAnd over the past year, more and more QAnon fans who also support Trump have alleged that their Q gear and shirts have been banned from the president\u2019s rallies, and they have accused security personnel of instructing them to, for instance, turn their T-shirts inside out. The U.S. Secret Service, for its part, has publicly denied that it is involved in QAnon suppression at Trump rallies. If QAnon-related clothing and signs are banned, it\u2019s possible that the ban has been imposed by additional, hired security guards, rather than the Secret Service.", "description": "", "authors": ["Sommer", "Thedailybeast.Com Source Articles Via Rss"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
