Or how many looks are you going to be serving?!!!'\n\nKim responded with 'I was up until 1:30am shooting one look! I have one w kids, one w Kanye and one solo.'\n\nAdding: 'I have a 4th look but not sure if I will do it this year. Need to decided.'\n\nLast year, Kim had an array of costumes, which began with her Victoria's Secret Angel shoot with sisters Khloe, Kourtney, Kylie and Kendall.\n\nShe also dressed up with best friend Jonathan Cheban - she was Pamela Anderson with him as Tommy Lee from their 1999 VMAs look.\n\nImpressive: Kim dressed up as her idol Cher on October 27, 2017 for the Casamigos Halloween party\n\nStylish: She also dressed up with best friend Jonathan Cheban - she was Pamela Anderson with him as Tommy Lee from their 1999 VMAs look\n\nThe year prior, she dressed up as Cher with Jonathan as Sonny Bono, Madonna and Michael Jackson and as Aaliyah and Selena Quintanilla.\n\nAnd hours earlier, Kim posted a photo of her and Kanye West's daughter North, six, in a Prada-made, one-shouldered Halloween costume that looked fit for a fully grown movie star.\n\nIt does however look like Kim is taking her husband's opinion into account, as the little girl appeared to be makeup-free (a departure from North's previous cosmetic-heavy looks that sparked her parents' conflict in the first place).\n\nWow: The year prior, she dressed up as Cher with Jonathan as Sonny Bono and as Aaliyah and Selena Quintanilla; pictured in October 2017\n\nAnother one: Kim was also Madonna with Jonathan as Michael Jackson as well in 2017\n\nDone up: Kim Kardashian posted a photo of her and Kanye West's daughter North, six, in a Prada-made, one-shouldered Halloween costume that looked fit for a fully grown movie star\n\nIn the snap, North stands in the center, flanked by two of her gal pals.\n\nThe three girls are outfitted in chic black and grey sleeveless getups, with North in a black column midi dress with jewels encrusted on the one-shouldered top.\n\nShe wears black tights and black feather flats, and sports a fake cast on one arm.\n\nNorth completes the look with a choker, pigtail buns with a black satin hair bow, and a single tendril of hair framing her face.\n\nSilver star: Kardashian was in full make up when she and Kanye West left the 2019 Night Of Stars at Cipriani Wall Street on Thursday. But he has banned North from copying her mom\n\nAll three girls have very mature, fashion-forward expressions on their unsmiling faces, like from models in the pages of a high-end glossy magazine.\n\nThe girls' flapper-inspired costumes are in fact designed by high-end fashion labels, which Kim tags in the photo: Givenchy, Prada and Dolce & Gabbana.\n\nKim K captioned the picture, 'Styled by North * fake cast included'.\n\nRecently, Kardashian revealed her husband Kanye banned their six-year-old daughter from wearing make-up and crop tops after becoming a 'born again' Christian.\n\nThe 42-year-old rapper, who finally released his new album called Jesus is King last week, has ruled that the young girl can't touch cosmetics until she is a teenager.\n\nAnd his wife, a reality star turned make-up mogul, has admitted that his new conservative views are causing tension in their household, particularly when it comes to his views on North using cosmetics.\n\nWith full glam, Kim style: North was seen with dark lipstick when she attended Kanye's church service in March\n\n'North is trying to get in on the makeup, but she's being blocked heavily because her dad has stopped all makeup for her until she is a teenager,' the 39-year-old old E! News at the debut of her KKW Beauty at an Ulta Beauty store in New York on Thursday.\n\n'It's a big discussion, a big fight in the household right now but it is what's best.\n\n'I think as a parent you just learn and figure it out as you go and we realized we didn't really want her to wear makeup at a young age but she sees her mom putting on lipstick and lip gloss.'\n\nThe rapper first put his foot down to block North's growing interest in make-up last month, having previously allowed North to wear cosmetics many times.\n\nKim and Kanye's eldest child has been pictured on multiple occasions testing a variety of makeup trends, including bright orange eyeshadow and red lipstick.\n\nFor the Kardashian Christmas Eve party last year, which was hosted at the West household, North proudly puckered her lips for the camera while rocking a bold lipstick shade.\n\n'I think he had it [with North's make-up so] he changed all the rules,' Kim told E! when Kanye first made the decision to stop wearing beauty products.\n\n'I'd let her wear, you know, she has a little red for Christmas, I'd let her wear a red lip, or I'd let her do one pop of something. I'd let her if she's wearing a black dress, a black lip.'\n\nAnd it doesn't help that Auntie Kylie Jenner gives North all of the enticing lip kits from her eponymous beauty brand, which has helped to make the 22-year-old a billionaire.\n\n'I kind of got in trouble for that, too. So, it's now no more makeup,' Kim added.\n\nKanye also has new rules about North's clothes.\n\nHe revealed on Apple Music's Beats 1 that when North was young he wanted her to look like a pop star.\n\nHe said: 'I was literally out there making [North] try to out dress Rihanna.'\n\nAnd he regrets it: 'I don't think North should wear a crop top after I had her wear a slip dress when she was two years old. I think and feel differently now that I am Christian.'\n\nKim and Kanye also share daughter Chicago, 21 months, along with sons Saint, three, and five-month-old Psalm.\n\nMommy sells makeup for a living: Here Mrs Kanye West is seen at the KKW Beauty launch at ULTA Beauty on Thursday in New York City\n\nRegret: West admits he used to want North (seen left in 2016) to 'out dress Rihanna' but now regrets putting her in slip dresses and crop tops. Rihanna is pictured right in 2015\n\nKanye, a reformed porn addict, has also urged his wife to tone down her sexy looks, much to the chagrin of fans and feminists.\n\nThe rapper didn't approve of the low-cut Thierry Mugler dress she wore to the Met Gala earlier this year, and he wanted her to wear something more conservative.\n\nIn scenes shown on Keeping Up With The Kardashians, he said: 'The corset, underwear, all of that vibe, I just feel like I just went through this transition where, from being a rapper, like, looking at all these girls, and looking at my wife, like, \"Oh, my girl needs to be just like the other girls, showing her body off, showing this, showing that.\n\n'And I didn't realize that that was affecting, like, my soul and my spirit as someone that's married and loved, and the father of, like, now what about to be four kids.\n\n'A corset is like a form of underwear. It's hot. It's like, it's hot for who, though?'\n\nHowever, the reality star fired back and told her man she didn't need the 'negative energy' of his disapproval.\n\nShe argued: 'You knew last night I was having really bad anxiety, and I don't need any more negative energy for you to now say that you're not into me wearing a tight dress.'\n\n'Too sexy': Kanye didn't approve of the low-cut Thierry Mugler dress she was planning to wear to the Met Gala. The couple argued over his views during a recent episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians\n\nKanye then insisted it 'affects' him when his partner poses for 'sexy' photos.\n\nHe added: 'You are my wife and it affects me when pictures are too sexy.'\n\nHowever, Kim pointed out her husband was the reason she felt confident and sexy, while insisting they were now in different places when it comes to their attitudes.\n\nShe explained: 'You built me up to be, like, this sexy person and confident and all this stuff. And just because you're on a journey, and you're on your transformation doesn't mean that I'm in the same spot with you.'", "description": "Kim Kardashian sported an array of Halloween costumes over the years, including a Victoria Secret Angel, singers Selena Quintanilla and Aaliyah as well as Pamela Anderson and Princess Jasmine.", "authors": ["Sarah Sotoodeh", "Dan Heching For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/22/20302146-0-image-a-48_1572301847100.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
