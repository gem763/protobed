According to the Google Play store, it already has more than 1 million downloads.\n\nThe whole thing feels like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu of earlier this year when everyone was using FaceApp\u2019s AI tech to morph the age of their selfies. And while, unlike FaceApp, Gradient may not ask you to sign away the rights to your face, it still does some pretty shady stuff. Particularly where your bank account\u2019s concerned.\n\nOne thing Gradient does manage to get right, though, is in exposing Elizabeth Holmes, the disgraced founder of the failed blood-testing company Theranos, for who she really is:\n\nI love this app pic.twitter.com/L74tz7PNsw \u2014 eve peyser (@evepeyser) October 17, 2019\n\nI mean, have you ever seen Holmes and Mark Zuckerberg in the same room at the same time? It\u2019s been right in front of our noses this whole time, people! The greatest con in American history, and we never even suspected...\n\nBack to that shady business, though. Before you can upload a picture to Gradient, the app requires you \u201cUNLIMIT yourself\u201d by purchasing a subscription, either $US4.99 ($7) per week or $US19.99 ($29) per month for weekly updates (at least, that\u2019s what Gradient\u2019s store description promises).\n\nOf course, if you just want to be like all the cool kids online and check out your own celebrity look-alike, there\u2019s a free three-day trial. That is, provided you fork over your credit card information first, which will be charged for an auto-renewing subscription once that free trial\u2019s up.\n\nI already know what you\u2019re thinking: \u201cI\u2019ll just uninstall the app before then.\u201d Oh, you sweet, sweet summer child. Even if you don\u2019t have Gradient downloaded, the subscription\u2019s still tied to your Google Play or Apple ID account. Cancelling it isn\u2019t exactly complicated \u2014 just head on over to your account settings in the app store and look under \u201cSubscriptions\u201d \u2014 but it\u2019s an extra step a lot of users wouldn\u2019t think to do until after they got that first bill. Also, be sure to cancel your subscription at least 24 hours before it ends. Otherwise, as per Gradient\u2019s description in the app store, you\u2019ll get charged for that next period.\n\nAnd while this kind of fine print is still gross and scammy, developer Ticket to the Moon Inc. seems to have learned at least one thing from FaceApp\u2019s scandal. The app\u2019s not mining and selling off your face data, as Gradient\u2019s privacy policy outlines on the very first page:\n\nWe do not collect or store any other data (including Personall Data) unless you provide it voluntarily. When provided voluntarily, we will not distribute or share your inofrmation with any third party without your consent.\n\nHowever, other information like cookies and usage data is still fair game for sharing among third-party providers and the company\u2019s affiliates. Gradient\u2019s sudden success has also drummed up some suspicion concerning its developer, a company apparently created this year with no other titles under its belt that shares an identical address to a Chinese investment firm called Meihua Capital Partners. Neither Ticket to the Moon Inc. nor Meihua Capital Partners immediately responded to Gizmodo\u2019s inquiries.", "description": "All those celebrity look-alikes you\u2019ve been seeing on your timeline come courtesy of the internet\u2019s latest collective obsession: Gradient, a barely week-old photo editing app that went viral after a few choice influences promoted this new feature on Instagram.
