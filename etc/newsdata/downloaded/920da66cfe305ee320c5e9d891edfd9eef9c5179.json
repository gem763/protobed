She cheered the second verdict in a later post, writing \"thank you god.\"\n\nMurder of Tyshawn Lee horrified Chicago: Now, gang members will stand trial\n\nMurder of 9-year-old Tyshawn Lee: Jury finds Chicago gang member guilty\n\nCook County State\u2019s Attorney Kimberly Foxx said she was pleased with the outcome of the case and hoped that the verdicts would bring some measure of closure and peace to Tyshawn's family.\n\n\u201cEven at a time when we\u2019ve become nearly numb to headlines about violence, this case shook us to our core. We grieve for 9-year-old Tyshawn as we continue to hold close those who are laboring in his wake,\" Foxx said in a statement Thursday.\n\nIn this Tuesday, Nov. 10, 2015, file photo, a mourner holds the program for the funeral of 9-year-old Tyshawn Lee at St. Sabina Church in Chicago.

The trauma is far-reaching and impacts us all, collectively,\" she said.\n\nWhile Boone-Doty's jury took just over two hours to reach a verdict, Morgan's jury deliberated for nearly 10 hours and was sequestered overnight.\n\nDefense attorney Todd Pugh said he feared that the prosecution's focus on gang culture and history on the city's South Side influenced the jury's final verdict.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a tremendous amount of repealable issues in this case, and we\u2019ll start the work of putting post-trial motions together,\u201d Pugh said.\n\nOver the past three weeks, Boone-Doty and Morgan were tried before separate juries, who shuffled in and out of the courtroom to hear evidence with respect to each case.\n\nA third man involved in the murder, Kevin Edwards, pleaded guilty to first-degree murder in exchange for a 25-year prison sentence.\n\nAfter school on Nov. 2, 2015, Tyshawn was sitting on a swing at the park down the street from his grandmother's house when Boone-Doty approached him, dribbled his basketball, offered to buy him anything he wanted and then led him to an alley, where he shot the child several times at close range, prosecutors say.\n\nThe execution-style shooting was an act of revenge, according to prosecutors. Boone-Doty and Morgan, members of the same gang, believed that a rival faction had killed Morgan's 25-year-old brother and wounded his mother a month earlier.\n\nMorgan and Boone-Doty were angered by the attack and wanted to get back at Tyshawn's father, Pierre Stokes, who was also an alleged member of the rival gang, prosecutors say. So Boone-Doty struck up a conversation with Tyshawn and led him to the alley.\n\nShell casings at the scene of the crime and the associated gun would eventually be linked back to Morgan and his brother, Anthony Morgan, who purchased the gun from a man in New Mexico.", "description": "On Friday, Corey Morgan was found guilty of first degree murder in the killing\u00a0of 9-year-old Tyshawn Lee in Chicago.", "authors": ["Grace Hauck", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/nxvCPLMze322wLXRykxYtA--~B/aD00MDY4O3c9MzQ4OTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/31862c1e2d2c2d7c225760937a4191b2", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
