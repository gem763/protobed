Fear not, we've got the best of what is on offer covered for you.\n\nRemember to check with each club's social media or websites to find out their special offers.\n\nAFC Fylde vs Sutton United\n\nCompetition: National League\n\nWhile a lot of clubs have received investment in recent years, few have done a better job with it than Fylde. They have built themselves a tremendously swanky home and are one of the friendliest clubs you will come across. Plus, the Non-League Dogs Twitter account is based out of this club, so there's every chance you'll come across a gorgeous little mutt.\n\nBath City vs Maidstone United\n\nCompetition: National League South\n\nFor many people, Bath is their favourite ground. Twerton Park is the epitome of non-league stadia. There's a big old school main stand and terracing behind the goals. The crowds are large and the experience is claimed to be one of the best and most authentically non-league around.\n\nBelper Town vs Stamford\n\nCompetition: FA Trophy\n\nAnother charming little football club - and one who are on a roll too. Trust us, the picture probably doesn't do this lovely little place justice. Belper have a trip to Notts County to look forward to in the FA Cup next weekend, but for now they are in FA Trophy action looking to make it 10 consecutive wins. The ground is neat, tidy and welcoming.\n\nCorinthian-Casuals vs Folkestone Invicta\n\n(Image: Stuart Tree)\n\nCompetition: Isthmian Premier Division\n\nOn the face of it, Corinthian-Casuals' ground is nothing spectacular. But once you delve into the history of his incredible football club - and realise that they are playing in an eye-catching pink and brown kit - you will see why it has so much appeal. They have close ties to Corinthians in Brazil and also have one of the best little club shops around. It's the best garden shed you will ever walk into.\n\nDulwich Hamlet vs Weymouth\n\nCompetition: National League South\n\nLondon's millennial football club, if you like, and one of the most positive matchday experiences you can have in football. Dulwich are all about diversity and inclusion - and an all round incredible day out. Dulwich are only recently back in their Champion Hill ground after debates with their landlords and there's a serious feel good factor about the place.\n\nHitchin Town vs Bromsgrove Sporting\n\nCompetition: Southern League Central\n\nHalf of this gem of a ground is surrounded by wooden terracing, making Hitchin one of the most unique grounds on the whole of England. There's an incredible concrete terrace down the far end of the ground, too. If the weather is reasonable, you'll experience this charming ground in all its wonderful glory.\n\nKing's Lynn Town vs Chester\n\nCompetition: National League North\n\nThe Walks is a cracking venue for non-league football, with full covering down one side, looking over at the enormous main stand opposite. This fixture is especially interesting, too. The two sides are the challengers to York City, who currently sit at the top of the National League North. You might remember Chester's joint-managers Anthony Johnson and Bernard Morley from their Salford days, too. It's never boring when they are involved.\n\nMatlock Town vs Mickelover Sports\n\nCompetition: Northern Premier League Premier Division\n\nIf views and scenery is your thing, then Matlock Town is the place for you to go this weekend. This charming three-sided ground is overlooked by a massive hill with a striking residence at the top, making it one of the most photogenic football venues around. A kind word about the food on offer at Matlock, too. It's belting.\n\nRamsbottom United vs Colne\n\nCompetition: FA Trophy\n\nThe matchday experience at Ramsbottom is particularly authentic - and you even get your cuppas given to you in a proper mug, with volunteers collecting them back in as the game goes on. The Riverside is neat, tidy and pleasant. And if you're especially lucky, you will get the treat of a steam train on the East Lancs Railway head past behind the goal. There is intrigue around Colne too, who are the lowest-ranked team left in this season's FA Cup.\n\nSt Albans City vs Eastbourne Borough\n\nCompetition: National League South\n\nSt Albans is another incredibly stereotypical non-league ground - and it is full of plenty of charm. Three sides of this ground featured old concrete terracing, while the main stand is historic in its own right. Overlooked by fir trees, there's a real sense of history and community at this charismatic stadium.\n\nStourbridge vs Banbury United\n\nCompetition: Southern League Central\n\nThe second three-sided ground to make the list - but offering one open side of the pitch to look over at the cricket pavilion only adds to this delightful multi-sport venue. Stourbridge are one of the friendliest football clubs around offer a superb food collection, too. It's got some belting old fashioned terracing and makes for a proper non-league experience.", "description": "Non-League Day returns for another installment this weekend and if you're undecided where to go, let us try and help you", "authors": ["Aaron Flanagan", "Image", "Handout", "Stuart Tree"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20544840.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Screen-Shot-2019-10-09-at-130421.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
