It must have been about 6.45am,'he added\n\n'Then I looked out of the window and saw this tiny orange boat. You could tell it was a migrant dingy. They were about two miles from the coast of Britain.\n\n'It was a very cold night, the water was quite choppy, so they must have been getting very wet.'\n\nThe group lit a flare after their vessel reportedly started taking on water this morning\n\nA ferry called the coastguard who went out to rescue the group\n\nHe added: 'The ferry kept a safe distance from the dingy but kept circling until a coastguard helicopter came over. And then we saw two coastguard boats coming out of the port of Dover.'\n\nA spokeswoman for DFDS told MailOnline the ship's captain had followed procedure to wait at a safe distance from the tiny vessel until the coastguard arrived.\n\nShe added: 'Sadly this is a regular occurrence.'\n\nThe dangerous dingy crossing is the latest in a growing flotilla of small boats packed with migrants trying to reach the UK by sea.\n\nAn estimated 1,000 people have reached the UK so far this year, with illegal crossings from the beaches of northern France attempted almost every night.\n\nHundreds of others have been rescued from the sea in small boats and returned to France. At least five migrants have drowned in recent weeks trying to make it to Britain.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: The captain of the DFDS ferry raised the alarm when the tiny inflatable was sighted in its path across the Channel from France - one of the busiest shipping lanes in the world.", "authors": ["Nick Fagge For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/11/20277124-0-image-a-5_1572263727865.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
