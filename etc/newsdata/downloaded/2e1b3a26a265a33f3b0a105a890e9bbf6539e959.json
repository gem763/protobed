Between college, babies, home ownership, and careers, it's hard to find time to devote to a financial plan.\n\nCouple these factors with burgeoning levels of student-loan debt, and planning for the future looks more like a dream than a reality.\n\nThat's where Douglas Boneparth, the president of Bone Fide Wealth comes in. He has detailed the road to mastering and growing wealth, which is built on timeless advice.\n\nBoneparth caters to NYC's affluent millennials \u2014 or those with incomes ranging from $400,000 to $1.2 million \u2014 but the lessons and values he shares are applicable to anyone looking to get their finances in order.\n\nHe breaks it down into three simple steps: Define a system, master your cash flow, and earn the right to invest. Here are details around each:\n\n1. Define a system\n\nBoneparth breaks down this easy-to-deploy methodology into three subcategories: identify, quantify, and prioritize.\n\nIdentify\n\n\"The first thing you need is a system for your goals,\" he said on \"Millennial Investing\" by the Investor's Podcast Network. \"What do you want for yourself? What great things in life? Is it a house? Is it retirement? Is it to sleep well at night with a cash reserve? Do you want a boat? It's your life; you figure it out.\"\n\nHe continued: \"The sooner you figure it out, the sooner you can start attacking them.\"\n\nRead more: Dyslexic, failing at school, and partially blind: How Larry Hite overcame the odds to become one of the most successful self-made stock traders using a strategy that's 'accessible to anybody'\n\nThe identification step lays the groundwork for the rest of Boneparth's thesis. Without identifying goals, you have nothing to strive for. No North Star. It's akin to wandering around aimlessly and hoping to one day arrive at financial freedom. Unfortunately, it doesn't work like that.\n\nQuantify\n\nBoneparth breaks down this step into two parts: how much and when.\n\n\"How much is that goal worth? If it's a house, well how much is that house? And then quantify by time,\" he said. \"Now you got a timeline on it, and now you know how much it's going to take to get there.\"\n\nThis step will clearly vary for different people, but the overarching message rings true. Its purpose is to systematize and discipline the way you think about your goals and what it will take to reach them.\n\nPrioritize\n\nThe completion of this step lets a person know exactly what to focus on, and it requires hard work. Boneparth is quick to demonstrate the fickleness of life and knows that things can change quickly. However, sound prioritization makes transitions much smoother and easier to cope with.\n\n\"Prioritization of your goals means you're honest about which of your goals are most important to you,\" he said. \"Because more than likely, your income and ability to save is limited, and if you have multiple goals, you're not going to be able to do all of them right now.\"\n\nOnce you've identified, quantified, and prioritized your goals, it's time for the next step.\n\n2. Master your cash flow\n\nBoneparth refers to this as the \"least sexy\" part of personal finance but also \"the most powerful part.\"\n\nIn broad strokes, this step requires you to go back anywhere and look at six to 12 months' worth of expenses and categorize them. This way, you'll know exactly where your money is going. He mentions budgeting platforms like Mint, Tiller, and the old faithful Microsoft Excel to help with the endeavor.\n\nRead more: Why a $60 billion investing firm thinks unloved value stocks represent the best market opportunity in 20 years\n\nOnce you've identified and categorized your spending, it's time to make a budget. You take the data you've collected from the first portion and apply it going forward.\n\n\"This is intimately understanding how money goes in and out of your life,\" he said. \"What that should show you and get you to is consistently saving towards the goals that you've already defined.\"\n\n3. Earn the right to invest\n\nThis is the final piece of the puzzle \u2014 and Boneparth's phrasing speaks volumes about his philosophy.\n\nYou have to earn it. Without mastering the other steps, you're not ready to put money at risk. You're not adequately prepared.\n\n\"Then, once you've built a cash reserve \u2014 three to six months of your living expenses \u2014 once you do all of these things I just mentioned, you've earned the right to invest,\" he said. \"That's the road to earning the ability to put risk on your money and grow your wealth.\"\n\nHe said: \"Nothing will really stop you in your pursuit of accumulating your wealth if you've mastered and have done all of those steps before.\"", "description": "\"Nothing will really stop you in your pursuit of accumulating your wealth if you've mastered and have done all of those steps before,\" Boneparth said.", "authors": ["Christopher Competiello"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5adf56cf19ee861d008b4798?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
