Aljamain fell out and got hurt. Frankie is coming to the end of his career, and he could end up getting himself into a title position again. To take the Conor fight makes no sense.\u201d\n\nAs for Conor\u2019s future, White didn\u2019t elaborate in detail. McGregor hasn\u2019t competed since October 2018, but White is confident fans will see \u201cThe Notorious\u201d fight again.\n\n\u201cI think Conor will fight next year,\u201d White said.\n\nThe rivalry between McGregor and Edgar stems back to 2015, when McGregor earned the featherweight title with a 13-second knockout of Jose Aldo. At the time of that victory, Edgar was one of the division\u2019s leading contenders. However, a McGregor title defense never materialized and neither did the Edgar bout.\n\nWednesday on Twitter, McGregor called for a matchup with Edgar in December. \u201cThe Answer\u201d responded touting his acceptance and put the onus on the UFC and White. McGregor issued one final reply, in which he said he would donate his entire fight purse to first responders.", "description": "There are a number of reasons why Dana White is disinterested in a potential showdown between Conor McGregor and Frankie Edgar.", "authors": ["Nolan King", "Dave Doyle", "Mma Junkie Staff", "John Morgan", "Farah Hannoun"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/conor-mcgregor-ufc-229-ap1.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
