We left a number of points out there but I was so pleased with the attitude of the players.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s two tests in a row we haven\u2019t conceded a try.\u201d\n\nLOTS TO WORK ON\n\nDespite their pressure, England had to wait until the 56th minute for their third try as hooker Jamie George went over off the back of a driving maul as Tongan legs tired.\n\nEngland somehow failed to claim their fourth score when Henry Slade failed to connect with Elliot Daly with the line at their mercy but replacement front-rower Luke Cowan-Dickie claimed the bonus point try after being sent clear by Jonathan Joseph.\n\nCaptain Owen Farrell, who kicked 15 points, was delighted to get off to a winning start.\n\n\u201cA lot to work on, a lot to build on but to come away with a bonus point win at a World Cup is always a good start,\u201d he said, adding that England had used the kick-and-chase tactic well to nullify Tonga\u2019s physical threat.\n\n\u201cTonga are a very physical team and to give them targets to hit would be playing into their hands. I thought we chased well and got some opportunities off the back of it.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s still some mistakes that we can look at and get better at but that\u2019s the exciting thing, we still have got a lot more in us.\u201d\n\nTuilagi, wearing a Tongan shirt as he received the player-of-the-match award, said: \u201cWe knew coming into this game Tonga was going to be a tough test for us but we managed to get the five points and it\u2019s a great start for our campaign.\u201d\n\nEngland next face the United States in Pool C on Thursday while Tonga take on Argentina on Saturday.", "description": "England got their World Cup campaign off to a scrappy start in Sapporo on Sunday with a 35-3 Pool C victory over Tonga, Manu Tuilagi leading the way with two tries.", "authors": ["Peter Rutherford", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
