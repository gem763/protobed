(AP) - Football has always been considered a safe haven in this tiny farming community, an island of pure Americana for families trying to make it in America. After each week\u2019s work in the fields is done - an effort that helps produce a significant chunk of the nation\u2019s produce - the whistles and thuds of Friday night high school games take over.\n\n\u201cFootball is its own drug,\u201d Immokalee High coach Rodelin Anthony says. \u201cIt\u2019s a way to numb the pain (of) a lot of these kids\u2019 issues, whether educational, emotional, or immigration. For a couple hours, I forget immigration is real.\u201d\n\nBut this fall, that window of escape in this tucked-away community is narrower than ever. Just a couple of weeks before football practice began, multiple media outlets and several residents reported Immigration and Customs Enforcement vehicles in the area. Images of unmarked cars were shared on social media feeds as warnings. Many members of the large migrant population stayed in their homes for hours or even days.\n\n\u201cYou could hear the dogs, the chickens,\u201d says Danny Gonzalez, president of the town\u2019s chamber of commerce. \u201cYou could not hear a single soul walking. You could hear no commotion, no traffic. All day Saturday and Sunday. A ghost town in that part of the area. It was pretty bad.\u201d\n\nWhether the perceived threat that weekend was real or imagined - ICE declined to comment on whether any of its officials were present in town at the time - the concern is clear: President Donald Trump\u2019s promise of raids targeting immigrants who are in the country illegally has put a chill on this proud community, and that has added a strange feel to a normally thrilling time of year. Even the high school football players, not used to giving much mind to politics or current events, have taken it upon themselves to monitor their Facebook accounts in an effort to look out for their teammates and families - just in case.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something important to check in on, 100 percent,\u201d says Frankie Alameda, a senior offensive lineman for Immokalee.\n\n\u201cWhat if you\u2019re out, you forget your license, you forget your identification?\u201d says senior linebacker Woudlin Pierre, 17, who was born here but has been carrying his Social Security card around for the first time. \u201cBad timing. Wrong place at the wrong time. Things can happen. My mom is always on me about having my wallet, my license, all that.\u201d\n\nThe situation is even more acute for Hispanic players such as Diego Matias, whose family fled Guatemala when he was 8. He says he has his papers in order, but the worry around him is constant.\n\n\u201cA lot of people are very scared right now,\u201d says Matias, 15, whose mother works in the fields. \u201cThat (ICE) will take them and leave their family here.\u201d\n\nThat is what took place in Mississippi on Aug. 7 as nearly 700 arrests were made in six towns on the first day of school. Images of wailing children were beamed around the world. The first day of school in Immokalee, about an hour\u2019s drive northeast from Naples, came and went as normal. But the question lingers in the humid air: Will it happen here, too?\n\n\u2013\n\n\u2018The only way out is hard work\u2019\n\nEven if you haven\u2019t heard of Immokalee (pronounced IM-MOCK-AH-LEE), you\u2019ve almost certainly enjoyed what it has to offer. More than a third of the nation\u2019s winter tomatoes are grown here, as well as a healthy percentage of its citrus. And if you\u2019re a football fan, you\u2019ve heard of Edgerrin James, the Pro Football Hall of Fame finalist whose mural is up near the bleachers, or J.C. Jackson, who won last season\u2019s Super Bowl with the New England Patriots. (Of the nine \u201cNotable People\u201d listed on the city\u2019s Wikipedia page, seven are football players.)\n\nAnthony has coached seven seasons and made seven trips to the playoffs, and football here is both a cherished pastime and a representation of the work ethic on which the community prides itself.\n\n\u201cThe only way out is hard work, dedication, and that\u2019s pretty much it,\u201d says Pierre, the linebacker. \u201cYou have to be willing to do most things others won\u2019t do. It\u2019s hard.\u201d\n\nDrive into the center of town and it\u2019s immediately clear how far this is from the beachfront mansions and fancy hotels of mostly white Naples - one of the richest areas in America. Immokalee has Haitian stores, Guatemalan stores, Mexican stores. Anthony, the son of refugees from Haiti, says \u201c90 percent\u201d of his players are from immigrant families.\n\nLozano\u2019s is one of the town\u2019s most popular restaurants, and a typical lunch crowd includes law enforcement, construction workers and young families. This is one of the places where fans of the high school team go before or after games on Friday nights. But when ICE vehicles are spotted in the Winn-Dixie plaza or elsewhere in town, Gonzalez says \u201cit\u2019s devastating for all the businesses.\u201d\n\nConcern about authorities cracking down on undocumented workers is not new - President Barack Obama was sometimes referred to as the \u201cdeporter-in-chief\u201d - but the recent Trump decree has brought a new level of anxiety.\n\n\u201cBorder Patrol back in the (1980s) and \u201890s wasn\u2019t bad,\u201d says Gonzalez, who was once a migrant worker. \u201cBut ICE created something different.\u201d\n\nAt the restaurant, the discussion can be frank when it comes to the possibility of ICE raids.\n\n\u201cWhen ICE comes here, we just warn the people,\u201d Gonzalez says of the migrant population. \u201cThat\u2019s all we can do. Warn \u2018em.\u201d\n\nAt school, though, these are practically impossible conversations to have.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I even know (how many players are dealing with immigration fears),\u201d Anthony says. \u201cEven if I ask, they wouldn\u2019t tell me the truth. We do have a relationship, but I represent a school. I represent a government agency of sorts.\u201d\n\nAccording to federal law, school officials are not allowed to inquire about citizenship status or request proof of citizenship. That has been the case since the Supreme Court\u2019s 1982 ruling in Plyler v. Doe, which held that undocumented children are entitled to public education.\n\nSo for Anthony, there\u2019s a lot of guesswork as to what may be on a player\u2019s mind. It could be regular teenage turmoil. Or it could be the tough living conditions most of his students face. A high percentage of those enrolled at Immokalee High qualify for free or reduced lunch, which means Anthony is never sure how recently his players have eaten. Migrant workers are, by definition, always on the move. So his players are sometimes cooks and caretakers. Is a player missing tackles because he\u2019s poorly coached? Or because he\u2019s poorly fed?\n\n\u201cIf they don\u2019t have food, they end up hitting one of us up,\u201d says Alameda, a senior. \u201cSometimes parents have bills to pay, and sometimes guys don\u2019t get fed. It\u2019s something we take care of.\u201d\n\nAnthony picks up a few of his players before dawn on some mornings, making sure they arrive on time to school, yet he never meets the parents of most of the players on his team. Just last season he had a player with college potential, and he encouraged him to attend camps where he might get discovered. The player improved significantly.\n\n\u201cThen it got time for scholarships as a senior,\u201d Anthony says. \u201cHe looked me, square in the eye, and said, \u2018Coach, I\u2019m undocumented.\u2019 \u201c\n\nAll the coach could think of in response was to offer support. Undocumented students can attend college, but they are ineligible for federal student aid.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the kid doing now?\u201d Anthony says with a hint of exasperation. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\n\u2013\n\nMatias still hears stories about life in Guatemala. \u201cGangs, out in the country, everyone is scared,\u201d he says. Here there is much less fear - he walks to practice by himself, knowing his paperwork is in order - but it\u2019s always a topic. \u201cA lot,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen they go to stores, or shopping, they have to walk (because) they don\u2019t have cars or licenses. They\u2019re scared.\u201d\n\nHe says he\u2019s frustrated not about the system of laws here, but the choices ICE is making.\n\n\u201cThey should take whoever is doing bad things,\u201d Matias says. \u201cSome (people) they\u2019re taking did nothing wrong. Some are doing something wrong and they\u2019re not taking them.\u201d\n\n\u201cICE prioritizes the arrest and removal of unlawfully present aliens who pose a threat to national security, public safety and border security,\u201d an ICE spokesperson wrote in a statement. \u201c\u2026 However, all of those in violation of the immigration laws may be subject to immigration arrest, detention and - if found removable by final order - removal from the United States.\u201d\n\nAnthony hasn\u2019t addressed his team directly about the shadow over the town. He knows they\u2019re all talking about it \u2026 but should he talk about it? He sits in an empty locker room after an early-morning practice and soul-searches. There are placards all around him with motivational phrases used by coaches before him, but Vince Lombardi never had to rally a team in a community where the fertile ground seems to shift underneath your feet.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t talk to them about it,\u201d he says, almost to himself. \u201cAnd I may have to start talking to them about it. When that time comes again, I\u2019ll probably have to address it. I just know it\u2019s a scary situation and I can lend some help and comfort to the kids.\u201d\n\nLately he\u2019s especially worried about one student in particular, who didn\u2019t want to be interviewed for this story. The boy hasn\u2019t said much to anyone about his home life lately.\n\n\u201cI think something is wrong,\u201d Anthony says with an obvious look of concern. \u201cI think maybe something happened.\u201d\n\nAmid all this, there\u2019s a season to play. Immokalee lost its starting quarterback to a transfer, and the home opener ended in an 18-0 loss. Anthony addressed the team afterward, taking all the blame for himself. There isn\u2019t much time to wallow around here. Winning teams are never predestined, but rather forged in setbacks and worry.\n\n\u201cIt goes in waves,\u201d Anthony says. \u201cWe just never know what\u2019s coming next.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Football has always been considered a safe haven in this tiny farming community, an island of pure Americana for families trying to make it in America.
