Darkest of all for marketers and advertisers.\n\nOnly 3% of people trust marketing and advertising, the lowest of any industry or practice, and that trust is falling fastest among millennials, an ominous sign for the future.\n\nWe have no one to blame but ourselves.\n\nLike everyone else, we\u2019ve been blinded by the promise of tech\u2019s false promise of \u201cBig Data Solves Everything.\u201d Martech is driving the dialog in our industry right now, and they\u2019re telling us that collecting as much consumer data as possible \u2014 regardless of the actual value of that data, and regardless of our consumer\u2019s best interests \u2014 will reveal a magic growth formula.\n\nThat\u2019s a farce. There is no magic growth formula, and tech won\u2019t do your job for you. Believing that amassing data will save your business instead of focusing on fundamentals has only led to lazy marketing, plummeting consumer trust and a two-fold increase in the number of expensive martech solutions over the last two years.\n\nPublic awareness of the surveillance economy is sharpening. The press is increasingly paying attention to business AND advertising practices. Consumers are voting with their wallets and choosing to walk away from companies that don\u2019t practice the values they preach. This is a trend that will speed up, not slow down. The skepticism that has recently emerged around Amazon\u2019s new Alexa announcements is just the most recent example of this.\n\nHow soon before marketers and advertisers end up on The New York Times naughty list? How much longer will consumers tolerate the hypocrisy of brands claiming to care for them while they vacuum up their personal data? Is it worth the risk to your brand and your business?\n\nDoing what\u2019s right for your business means doing what\u2019s right for your consumers.\n\nIf you are a marketer reading this: You can do better.\n\nBeing a lean data company doesn\u2019t mean being a martyr \u2014 just the opposite. The top 10 U.S. most trustworthy S&P 500 companies outperform the market by 25-50%.\n\nBut it does mean doing something counterintuitive for many marketers in the era of big tech and adtech. It means striving to collect only the consumer data that you really need to give equal or greater value back to your customer \u2014 and protecting it. It means no more selling, sharing and buying user data. It means being transparent about your marketing practices.\n\nDoing so will take your focus off data collection for the sake of data collection and put that focus where it belongs \u2014 on understanding your customer\u2019s needs, delivering them more and more value and regaining their trust and respect.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just empty talk.\n\nAt Mozilla we\u2019re backing up this lean data commitment with action. In the spirit of truly putting our users\u2019 interests first, the latest release of the Firefox browser blocks third-party cookies by default. Frankly, we had anticipated some pushback from publishers, but instead they\u2019ve told us they haven\u2019t experienced the impact they expected, which is pushing them to question the actual value of the data they\u2019d been collecting and revisit their own practices.\n\nA lean data movement is growing. Others have taken action too, and there are many more who believe that doing what\u2019s right for your business means doing what\u2019s right for your consumers.\n\nSo whatever your own lean data commitment looks like, make it now, before it\u2019s too late. As marketers and advertisers, we\u2019ve survived some seismic shifts over the last few years, but no one can survive 0% trust.", "description": "These are dark days for trust -- darkest of all for marketers and advertisers.
