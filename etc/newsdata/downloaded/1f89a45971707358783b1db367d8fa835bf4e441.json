McDonough. \u201cWhen the choice comes down to leaving a room empty or renting that room to sex traffickers, the hotels in these lawsuits consistently chose to rent the room to sex traffickers.\u201d\n\nThe suits were filed against the corporate offices and affiliated parties for Red Roof Inns, Inc.; Choice Hotels International, Inc., which owns Suburban Extended Stay; La Quinta Worldwide, LLC, which is owned by Wyndham Hotels & Resorts; and Extended Stay America, Inc. for the following locations:\n\nRed Roof Inn, located at 2200 Corporate Plz, Smyrna, Georgia;\n\nSuburban Extended Stay, which is now a Hometown Studios, located at 2050 Peachtree Industrial Ct, Chamblee, Georgia;\n\nLa Quinta Inn, located at 1350 North Point Dr., Alpharetta, Georgia;\n\nExtended Stay America, located at 1050 Hammond Dr. NE, Atlanta, Georgia;\n\nExtended Stay America, located at 6250 Corporate Blvd, Baton Rouge, Louisiana\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe most shocking thing to me was there wasn\u2019t one shocking event -- there were so many shocking events and it was so pervasive,\u201d McDonough said Thursday. Tonges added: \u201cIt\u2019s the endemic nature of this.\u201d\n\nIn some cases, 10 to 20 men shuffled in and out of hotel rooms every day, the release alleges.\n\nIn Chamblee, a victim at the Suburban Extended Stay told an employee she had been attacked \u201cin an attempt to escape,\u201d the suit alleges, but the worker relayed the information to the trafficker \u2013 who then assaulted the woman for doing so.\n\nAt La Quinta Inn in Alpharetta, a victim was beaten so viciously by her John over the course of six hours that blood riddled the walls and surrounding areas of the hotel room, the suit states.\n\nAt the Baton Rouge Extended Stay America, four trafficking victims were allegedly required to make at least $1,000 every day for their sex acts, which equates to approximately 10 customers on daily basis, the suits allege.\n\nSmyrna Red Roof Inn employees were aware of the ongoing trafficking at the location \u2013 as were workers at corporate officers \u2013 as a result of several reviews on public websites about the ongoing activity at the motel, \u201cbut the company did not act,\u201d according to the release and court papers.\n\nCourt papers also feature photographs of signs posted at the Red Roof Inn that read: \u201cNO REFUNDS AFTER 15 MINUTES.\u201d\n\nSource: lawsuit\n\n\u201cThe policy exists so that commercial sex acts cannot be accomplished quickly at the Smyrna Red Roof Inn without also paying for a room at the Smyrna Red Roof Inn,\u201d the lawsuit states. \u201cIn other words, the Smyrna Red Roof Inn has a policy that allows commercial sex acts in its rooms, but only for a fee\u2014the full price of a daily room rental.\n\nThe lawsuits were filed Monday in the U.S. District Court in the Northern District of Georgia and are seeking unspecified damages on behalf of the victims, Tonge said.\n\nIn a statement to FOX Business, a company spokesperson for Choice Hotels, which owns Suburban Extended Stay, noted that all hotels are independently owned by franchisees.\n\n\"While we cannot comment on any specifics regarding pending litigation, we condemn human trafficking and are committed to raising awareness of and combatting this issue with our franchisees,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nA spokesperson for Wyndham Hotels & Resorts condemned human trafficking \"in any form.\"\n\n\"[W]e have worked to enhance our policies condemning human trafficking while also providing training to help our team members, as well as the hotels we manage, identify and report trafficking activities,\" spokesperson Gabriella Chiera said in a statement. \"We also make training opportunities available for our franchised hotels, which are independently owned operated.
