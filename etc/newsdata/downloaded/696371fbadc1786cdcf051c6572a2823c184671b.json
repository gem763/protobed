Even a rapidly rising dividend payout can rarely compensate for a fast share price decline.\n\nMore from Ned Piplovic: Vanguard's Five Best Income Funds\n\nTherefore, every investment portfolio \u2014 whether income-based, or asset-appreciation-based \u2014 should include a core of equities that offer reliable long-term capital growth, as well as a steady income flow.\n\nThe list below is not just a list of equities with the highest yields. Only one company has a one-year record of annual dividend hikes. All other equities have at least three years and as much as 19 consecutive annual dividend boosts.\n\nFurther, to make this list, every equity had to offer sufficient asset appreciation to deliver positive total returns over the past one, three and five years.\n\nWithout further delay, below is the list of seven monthly dividend stocks to buy now, presented in ascending order by their current dividend yield.\n\nSTAG Industrial, Inc. (STAG)\n\nDividend Yield: 4.88%\n\nHeadquartered in Boston and incorporated in 2011, STAG Industrial, Inc. is an industrial real estate operating company focused on the acquisition, ownership and operation of single-tenant, industrial properties throughout the United States.\n\nThe company boosted its annual dividend payout amount every year since its formation in 2011. The current $0.119 monthly distribution is equivalent to a $1.428 annual payout and currently yields nearly 5%.\n\nSee also: The 10 Best Blue Chips for Income & Growth\n\nIn addition to a steady dividend income, the company also enhanced its share price nearly 10% in the last year.\n\nFurthermore, the share price nearly doubled since its five-year low in February 2016.\n\nThe total return from the combined benefit of rising dividends and asset appreciation exceeded 12%. Over the last three and five years, the total returns were 35% and 75%, respectively.\n\nSolar Senior Capital Ltd (SUNS)\n\nDividend Yield: 8.03%\n\nSolar Senior Capital Ltd. is a business development company that provides investments to leveraged middle-market companies in the United States.\n\nThe company offers investments in the form of senior secured loans, including first and second lien debt instruments. Solar Senior Capital does not invest in start-up companies or companies having speculative business plans.\n\nThe company raised its monthly dividend distribution amount seven times during the first 18 months after its formation in mid-2011 and has paid a steady $1.42 annual dividend over the past seven years.\n\nIn addition to its steady dividend distributions, the company\u2019s share price contributed supplemental gains amid moderate volatility. Just over the past 12 months, the company delivered a 13.6% combined total return. Over the last three years, the total return was 35% and the total return exceeded 57% for the current five-year period.\n\nGladstone Investment Corporation (GAIN)\n\nDividend Yield: 6.59%\n\nHeadquartered in McLean, Virginia, and founded in 2005, the Gladstone Investment Corporation is a private equity fund specializing in lower middle market, acquisitions, buyouts, recapitalizations and debt refinancing.\n\nAfter losing nearly 85% of its value during the 2008 financial crisis, the company advanced more than five-fold and regained more than 90% of its losses since the all-time low in March 2009.\n\nThe company\u2019s current $0.068 monthly payout corresponds to a $0.82 annualized payout and has a yield of nearly 6.6%. Over the last nine years, GAIN enhanced its total annual distribution 70%, which is equivalent to an average growth rate of 6.1% per year.\n\nIn addition to its regular monthly distributions, Gladstone also distributed three extra dividends in 2017, two in 2018 and one year-to-date in 2019. Additionally, the company supplemented its rising dividend income with steady asset appreciation for a 17% total one-year return, as well as 70% total return over the last three years and a 130% total return over the last five years.\n\nStory continues", "description": "The only type of investment that income investors like more than equities that deliver a steady flow of quarterly dividend distributions are monthly dividend stocks, suggests Ned Piplovic, income specialist and editor of DividendInvestor.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
