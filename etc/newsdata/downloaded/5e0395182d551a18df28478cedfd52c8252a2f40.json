Her six-song medley was a thrill-ride of kaleidoscopic visuals, VMAdancers and costume changes: Elliott was a cyberqueen, a B-girl, a scarecrow, an airborne beachball, a one-woman advertisement for what pop music can be. The performance, marking her video vanguard award, instantly went viral, capped a year of honours (an honorary doctorate from Berklee College of Music, the first female rapper in the Songwriters Hall of Fame) and coincided with the Iconology EP, her first new body of work since 2005. It dazzled the uninitiated while reminding millions of older fans what a vital creative force the 48-year-old was and how much we had missed her.\n\nTwo days later, Elliott is still bathing in goodwill. \u201cIt\u2019s a blessing,\u201d she says, calling from New York. \u201cA blessing!\u201d She has a throaty southern accent and a brilliant, exclamatory laugh. After a month of planning and two weeks of rehearsals, she says the set went like a dream. \u201cThe only time I was scared was when I was backstage and I had to keep changing clothes really fast. I thought: \u2018Oh God, I\u2019m not going to have my pants on in time. I might be in my panties!\u2019 Ha ha!\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Katy Perry and Missy Elliott perform at Super Bowl Halftime in 2015.

The last time she returned to the public eye, as Katy Perry\u2019s guest during the Super Bowl half-time show in 2015, she \u201cfreaked out\u201d the night before, daunted by the size of the audience and the length of time she had been away. \u201cI ended up in the hospital for having an anxiety attack,\u201d she says. \u201cI think any artist who has had a break such as that one would be anxious. I remember Katy saying: \u2018This is the perfect time to perform your new record. It\u2019s the biggest platform.\u2019 I was like: \u2018I don\u2019t even know if they remember the old ones so I most definitely don\u2019t want to do a new one!\u2019 I\u2019m always anxious whenever I drop anything because you just never know if they\u2019re going to get it. So I\u2019m always biting my nails and pacing the floor.\u201d\n\nElliott was meant to release her long-overdue seventh album that year but after just one brilliant single, WTF (Where They From), she returned to her quieter life as a writer, producer and guest MC. \u201cI hate to say I\u2019m back because in reality I never went nowhere,\u201d she insists. \u201cI was still doing stuff behind the scenes. I don\u2019t always want to be upfront. I\u2019m very shy.\u201d I suggest that anyone watching her fly through the air in an inflatable leather suit at the VMAs would not automatically diagnose her with shyness. \u201cI was like that as a child,\u201d she says. \u201cWe would have family reunions and they always wanted me to get up on the table to perform. After an hour of them begging me, I would finally get on the table and become this other little kid. Then they couldn\u2019t get me off. Once I set foot on the stage, I block out everything. I can be in my own world.\u201d\n\nMelissa Elliott first constructed a private world as a child in Virginia. It was a fantastical refuge from a violent father, an abusive cousin and the grind of poverty; when reality fails you, build your own. Behind her bedroom door, she was a star, practising acceptance speeches in the mirror and performing to an audience of dolls. \u201cThe teacher would ask what everyone wanted to be and I said: \u2018I\u2019m going to be a superstar.\u2019 And everyone in the class would laugh. I wonder if those kids remember me to this day, because I remember everyone.\u201d\n\nIn high school, Elliott formed an R&B group called Fayze, who later signed with the Swing Mob label under the name Sista and moved to New York. But Sista flopped and the Swing Mob crew dissolved, so Elliott didn\u2019t hit her stride until she returned to her home state in 1995 with her best friend and producer Tim \u201cTimbaland\u201d Mosley. \u201cTimbaland was more quiet than me and I\u2019m super-shy so just imagine,\u201d she says. \u201cHe\u2019s most definitely not like that now! Through him I met Pharrell and we all bonded.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Missy Elliott and producer Timbaland in 2004. Photograph: Jon Furniss/WireImage\n\nAvoiding the radio and MTV, the Virginians tunnelled deep into their imaginations to find genuinely new sounds. Elliott describes one memorable day in Virginia Beach\u2019s Master Sound studio: \u201cI was in the booth doing The Rain [her debut solo single] and I kept hearing: \u2018I hate you so much right now!\u2019 And I was like: \u2018Yo, who is screaming?\u2019 I\u2019m getting so mad. And Pharrell comes knocking on the door and says: \u2018I want you to hear something.\u2019 And he plays it and it\u2019s Kelis. Me and Tim were like: \u2018Man, we wish we had done that record.\u2019 That\u2019s how we pushed each other.\u201d\n\nMissy \u201cMisdemeanor\u201d Elliott could do it all \u2013 sing, rap, write, produce \u2013 but what she and Timbaland were doing was so far out that they needed to prove themselves, first by working on Aaliyah\u2019s 1996 album One in a Million. It was the shape of R&B to come: radical yet irresistible. For her own The Rain (Supa Dupa Fly), Elliott cooked up a joyfully bizarre video with director Hype Williams to let people know who they were dealing with. \u201cIt helped people understand the type of artist that I am: witty, with a fun, comical sense, but futuristic, too.\u201d Suddenly, everybody wanted a piece of her.\n\nElliott remembers receiving calls from Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey and Janet Jackson in a single month. \u201cIt happened so fast that I\u2019m just now getting a chance to sit back and re-evaluate everything,\u201d she says. \u201cThis year has allowed me to look back over my life and be like: \u2018Wow.\u2019\u201d When she watches the spectacular video for her 1999 single She\u2019s a Bitch, in which she rises out of the ocean like a bald cyborg, she\u2019s amazed. \u201cI think: \u2018Where was my mind at? What space was we in to create records like that?\u2019 So many moments I look back and wish that I knew what I was thinking at the time.\u201d Like a hip-hop Doctor Strange, Elliott was a reality-bender. On hits such as Get Ur Freak On and Work It she made everything elastic \u2013 voice, rhythm, language, body \u2013 until the usual rules ceased to apply. Both avant-garde and platinum-popular, she revolutionised hip-hop and R&B while also wowing the likes of Thom Yorke, Damon Albarn and Bj\u00f6rk. Her videos with Hype Williams and Dave Meyers were no less game-changing than her records, each one a reinvention. She credits Elektra Records for running with her imagination. \u201cNot once did they say: \u2018No, you can\u2019t do this.\u2019 I would bring stuff to them and they\u2019d be like: \u2018Let\u2019s do it.\u2019 The only time you get pushback is when they realise the budget is a million dollars.\u201d She laughs. \u201cThen they\u2019re like: \u2018Wait a minute \u2026 \u2019\u201d\n\nSimultaneously, she and Timbaland created startling hits for other artists, including Tweet, Melanie B and Destiny\u2019s Child, featuring a 16-year-old Beyonc\u00e9. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that Beyonc\u00e9 came in and was loud or \u2018Look at me, I\u2019m gonna be the star,\u2019\u201d Elliott remembers. \u201cShe was very sweet. But when she went in the booth, that\u2019s when I knew.\u201d Beyonc\u00e9 later appeared on Elliott\u2019s 2002 track Nothing Out There for Me. \u201cI said: \u2018Hey, I want you to rap a little bit.\u2019 And she was like: \u2018Miss, if I sound crazy, don\u2019t put this out!\u2019 And I said: \u201cTrust me, B, I\u2019m not gonna allow you to sound crazy.\u2019 She went in there and now she\u2019s rapping better than me!\u201d\n\nIn recent years, critics have emphasised the political impact of Elliott\u2019s work. By radiating pleasure and freedom while upending expectations about race, gender and body image, she was an empowering figure, although she insists that was a byproduct rather than an agenda. \u201cNever, ever once did I think of making a political statement. I did what I did. I didn\u2019t know that it would become that for others later.\u201d She enjoys it, though. \u201cTo know that it has been taken that way, I\u2019m happy.\u201d\n\nThen, in 2005, Elliott effectively put her solo career on ice. What happened? \u201cWell, I\u2019m going to be honest, there were a lot of things,\u201d she says hesitantly. One was overwork. A stranger to holidays, she was always either working on her own music (six albums in eight years) or someone else\u2019s. \u201cI needed to refresh my mind. Then I got sick, so that was another thing.\u201d In 2008, after three years of chronic fatigue and drastic weight loss, she was diagnosed with Graves\u2019 disease, a thyroid disorder, and treated with radiation therapy. Even once she was able to resume recording, Elliott\u2019s hiatus between albums became self-perpetuating: the longer she stayed away, the harder it was to come back. Without deadlines or financial pressure (she invested wisely), her perfectionism took over. She disappeared into the studio, racking up several albums\u2019 worth of unreleased material. \u201cYou end up building up a trillion records,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s easier for me to write for other people and not be as critical. I\u2019m very hard on myself. I\u2019m like: \u2018Let me see if I can make something better,\u2019 so you just keep powering on.\u201d\n\nThe overwhelming, instant scrutiny of social media exacerbated this self-doubt. Earlier this year, Cardi B tweeted about anxiety and Elliott sympathised: \u201cMany people deal with this \u2026 i am one \u2026 it\u2019s real.\u201d This wasn\u2019t something that rappers discussed publicly in the 90s. \u201cAnxiety and depression, I\u2019m not gonna lie, I rarely heard that back then,\u201d she says. \u201cBut now I hear it a lot. Before social media you really didn\u2019t know what people thought of you but now it\u2019s so in your face that I think it probably gives a lot of artists anxiety. You have a lot of people coming at you, good or bad.\u201d So she stuck to supporting roles on records by the likes of Ariana Grande, Janet Jackson, the Missy-indebted Lizzo and debut recording artist Michelle Obama: Elliott was the highlight of Obama\u2019s 2016 charity single This Is for My Girls. \u201cI wasn\u2019t gonna say no. Y\u2019know, it\u2019s Michelle Obama. Am I really gonna be like: \u2018Nah Michelle, I\u2019m busy!\u2019 She made me feel she was in my family. I almost forgot she was the First Lady.\u201d\n\nNow, finally, Elliott is \u201cmost definitely\u201d ready to take the plunge and release that album, self-doubt be damned. \u201cThis time the label is like: \u2018Knock it off, Missy Misdemeanor Elliott!\u2019 Ha ha!\u201d\n\nThe good news is that new music means live shows. The bad news is that these might have to take the form of a Las Vegas residency because Elliott\u2019s ideas may be too ambitious to be portable. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a lot because there\u2019s so much going in my mind,\u201d she says. \u201cMy mind is like a rollercoaster. It\u2019s like an amusement park. Heh heh heh.\u201d At long last, Missyland is reopening for business.\n\nMissy Elliott\u2019s Iconology EP is out now", "description": "As she returns to the spotlight, the hip-hop icon talks Michelle Obama, collaborations and the truth behind her hiatus", "authors": ["Dorian Lynskey"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6de53bbc2260febc167488209afe81844c47ecaa/0_225_5352_3211/master/5352.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3fd1ca91f4bc11a2cbbac95a38fa7d87", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
