A monopolist in that situation will always use its power \u2013 the question is only by how much and how often.\n\n\u201cHow is it that Australia, much more so than other countries we compare ourselves to, allows this?\"\n\nThe new dilemma for the ACCC is that the latest ACT decision has the potential to establish a new and unwelcome precedent in creating a formula that releases the Port of Newcastle to increase its fees beyond the range already set by Sims & Co.\n\nThe ACT redrafted the fees set last year by the ACCC because it found fault with the mechanism of arbitration. The ACCC used what it believed was a standard process that set a maximum allowed revenue by establishing a replacement value of the port as the starting point for a process that established the final value of the regulated asset base (RAB).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe replacement value was put at $2.169 billion and from that the ACCC deducted the value of a slate of capital works at the port that had been funded by the customers. As a result, the RAB was trimmed to $1.257 billion, and the ACCC ended up trimming the port fees whose hike started this circular, three-cornered contest back in 2015.\n\nThe ACT\u2019s re-arbitration of the port\u2019s regulated fee base found, for a host of technical reasons, that the ACCC had erred in discounting the customer-funded component of the port\u2019s capital works. It accepted instead that Port of Newcastle\u2019s lengthy arguments, with included the concept that \u201cbygones should be bygones\u201d when it comes to historic capital costs.\n\nA very bad precedcent\n\nLooked at through the ACCC lens, the ACT decision allows fees to be set on capital works that were paid for by customers. In this case, 42 per cent of the capital spent on sustaining the shipping channel was raised under the user pays regime enforced by the NSW government.\n\nAllowing that investment to be included in the RAB means that the customers effectively pay twice for the asset, just as it allows the Port of Newcastle\u2019s new owners the opportunity to earn monopoly rents from investments that their business did not pay for.\n\n\u201cI find the decision disappointing in that companies that have paid for assets to be built now have those folded into an asset base and they have to pay for them all over again,\u201d Sims told The Australian Financial Review on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThat seems to me both unfair and to set a very bad precedent. Why would any company contribute to user funding in the future if they end up getting charged twice?\u201d\n\nLike so much in this elongated process, that simple clarity doesn\u2019t quite capture the complexity of the particular situation at the Port of Newcastle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the evidence presented by the Port of Newcastle, Glencore wasn\u2019t one of the users that actually contributed to the five channel projects that accounted for the ACCC\u2019s deduction. So, the port operator argued, given the ACCC ruling only covered Glencore\u2019s fees, why should it benefit from the capital provided by other users?\n\nWell, that is a question that may yet require further test. Who might best run that test is another matter entirely. It is far from clear whether Glencore has the appetite for a further legal challenge or whether the ACCC would have standing enough to force a judicial review of the ACT ruling.\n\nThree-cornered bunfight\n\nThe immediate effect of ACT\u2019s re-arbitration of a set of findings the ACCC delivered in July last year is that the Port of Newcastle is free to dramatically increase the navigation service fee it charges Glencore to a peak much higher than the one that started this three-cornered bunfight way back in 2015.\n\nThen, just months after Hastings Funds Management and China Merchants paid a staggering $1.75 billion for the Port of Newcastle, the new operators moved to hike fees for accessing their shipping channel and wharves by 40-60 per cent, depending on the size of the vessel its customers were using.\n\nThe navigation fee \u2013 which is by far the most material \u2013 rose to 78.86 cents a gross tonne in 2015 and then stepped up to 75.53 cents in 2018.\n\nIn between that first rise and the second, Glencore \u2013 the port\u2019s biggest user \u2013 trooped off to the National Competition Council seeking declaration of the port under Part IIIA of the Competition and Consumer Act.\n\nWhen the NCC rejected Glencore\u2019s application, the miner headed off to the ACT, where it was more successful. That success resulted in declaration and the delivery of arbitration powers to the ACCC. Further discussions between port operator and customer failed to produce an agreement and the ACCC was called in.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe ACCC trimmed the contentious navigation fee by 19.5 per cent to just 60.75 cents a tonne. That fee was backdated to July 8, 2016, and the ACCC established a five-year review provision that would see a review of the RAB based on capital invested over the regulated period that did not come from customers.\n\nThe rest should have been history. But it wasn\u2019t and, after nearly five years of see-sawing fortunes, the Port of Newcastle management and its owners have emerged with higher regulated fees than they had set themselves and freed from the complications of declaration.\n\nNot surprisingly, given that total victory appears to be at hand, Port of Newcastle management put out a pretty chipper statement in the wake of the ACT\u2019s generosity.\n\nThe operator welcomed a decision that offered incentive for a service provider to invest in a timely and efficient way to maintain and improve their infrastructure.\n\n\u201cWe have long said that port pricing should remain subject to an appropriate and efficient commercial relationship between the port and its customers,\u201d Port of Newcastle chief executive Craig Carmody said.\n\nAfter wishing for the end of a \u201cperiod of unnecessary uncertainty\u201d, Carmody said he was \u201clooking to sitting down with all our customers to discuss our services and pricing\u201d.", "description": "The operator of the world's biggest coal port signals a new round of price negotiations after securing back-to-back victories in its war with it major customer and the ACCC.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3246%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_159/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/0d8460e77a36a6503df98bf9cda708263cc1b46e", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
