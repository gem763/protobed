Prince, who died only months before Trump's election in November 2016, made \"Purple Rain\" famous in the 1984 movie of the same name loosely based on his own life and was notoriously protective of his music and copyrights.\n\n\"The Prince Estate would never give permission for President Trump to use Prince\u2019s songs,\" Friday's tweet read.
