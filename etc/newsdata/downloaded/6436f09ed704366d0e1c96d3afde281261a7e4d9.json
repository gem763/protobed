Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) tweeted out a report about the school activity ban, which she called \u201ccruel and punitive.\u201d\n\nFellow candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) also spoke out against the policy, tweeting, \u201d\u2018School lunch debt\u2019 is not a phrase that should exist.\u201d\n\nThis is cruel and punitive. Every kid needs and deserves a nutritious meal in order to learn at school. My plan will push to cancel student breakfast and lunch debt and increase funding to school meals programs so all students can get a nutritious meal. https://t.co/cAdQkw6qKt \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 21, 2019\n\nStudent lunch debt has been a longtime concern within the district. At a Board of Education meeting back in August, officials said student lunch debt had ballooned to $18,000. This followed a prior debt of $25,000 being erased in 2017.\n\nCherry Hill Superintendent Dr. Joseph Meloche, speaking at the meeting, argued against wiping out a list of debt owed by students as a solution to the problem.\n\n\u201cThere are absolutely children on that list who are in financial need. We know there are issues, that they need our support,\u201d he said. \u201cWiping out the debt, merely paying the money that the family owes, does not help the children because we\u2019ve been feeding the kids and we\u2019re going to continue feeding the kids.\u201d\n\nWiping out the debt, merely paying the money that the family owes, does not help the children because we\u2019ve been feeding the kids.\" Cherry Hill Superintendent Dr. Joseph Meloche\n\nWilson repeated that point, stating that students, regardless of how much debt is owed, will receive a non-discriminatory school lunch. Over the summer, the school district considered giving students who owed more than $10 tuna fish sandwiches for lunch. Students who owed more than $20 would have received nothing.\n\n\u201cAll children are fed, and all who get in line for lunch are provided the lunch of their choice, regardless of whether they have money for it or not,\u201d she said.\n\nWilson also attempted to strike down multiple reports that the district turned down a local businessman\u2019s offer to pay off the students\u2019 current lunch debt. StopRite grocery store chain owner Steve Ravitz said on Facebook that he sought to do so and was rebuffed.\n\nRavitz \u201chas not, at any time, contacted the school district with an offer of financial support,\u201d Wilson told HuffPost, adding that Dr. Meloch tried to reach out to Ravitz about the offer but has not received a response.\n\nRavitz\u2019s son, Jason Ravitz \u2014 who is the deputy mayor of neighborhing Voorhees Township, New Jersey \u2014 disputed Wison\u2019s claim in a phone interview with HuffPost.\n\n\u201cThe only thing I\u2019ll say is I really don\u2019t appreciate whether it\u2019s the Board of Education or the superintendent\u2019s office saying that my father never made a formal offer or serious offer, almost questioning his intentions or mocking him,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s offensive and nobody\u2019s going to buy it because people know that my dad has already been there to help families in need,\u201d he added.\n\nRavitz said he and his family are currently busy organizing Thanksgiving meals for local families and that \u201cit\u2019s best for the school board and for the administration to do their jobs.\u201d", "description": "Students with debt higher than $75 can be barred from extracurricular activities under a Cherry Hill Board of Education policy.", "authors": ["Breaking News Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5db0cf80210000492634add0.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
