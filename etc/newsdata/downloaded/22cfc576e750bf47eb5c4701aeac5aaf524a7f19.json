After Trump wondered aloud, \"Where's Hunter?\" at a Minnesota rally last week, his campaign began selling T-shirts with the question printed on them.\n\nHunter Biden joined the board of Burisma Holdings, a natural gas giant in Ukraine, in 2014. The company's founder was under investigation by then-prosecutor-general Viktor Shokin, who the U.S., United Kingdom and other western governments argued had failed to rein in corruption in the country.\n\nThe U.S. threatened to withhold roughly $1 billion in loan guarantees if Shokin was not replaced as prosecutor general, a message Joe Biden delivered to officials in Kiev while serving as vice president and recounted during a 2018 Council on Foreign Relations conference.\n\nWhile many of the president's allies have argued that there was minimally a conflict of interest at play in the case, the former vice president has denied acting with his son's interests in mind and there is no evidence of any criminal wrongdoing by either of the Bidens.\n\nTrump has also claimed that Hunter Biden got $1.5 billion from China, similarly alleging it is evidence of corruption involving the former vice president and his family.\n\nHunter Biden has business connections to China, but there is no evidence of how much he's made or that it had any relation to his father's work while in office.\n\nTrump has publicly urged Ukraine and China to look into the Bidens. Those comments and government documents are at the heart of an impeachment inquiry led by House Democrats.\n\n--This developing report will be updated.", "description": "Hunter Biden, the son of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, said in a rare interview broadcast early Tuesday that he made a mistake by getting involved with foreign companies, acknowledging that it provided an opening for critics to atta", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/bidenhunter_101219getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
