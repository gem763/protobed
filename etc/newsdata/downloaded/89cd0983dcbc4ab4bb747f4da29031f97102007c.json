She was always very self-sufficient and liked to find her own answers,\u201d Mr Russell told BBC News.\n\n\u201cI think she looked towards the Internet to give her support and help. She may well have received support and help, but what she also found was a dark, bleak world of content that accelerated her towards more such content.\u201d\n\nMr Russell outlined that some of the images Molly came across were \u201cas simple as little cartoons\u201d, while others were \u201cmuch more graphic and shocking\u201d.\n\nAccording to Instagram, the social media platform has removed double the amount of content related to self-harm and suicide since the beginning of 2019.\n\nThe Facebook-owned company said that between April and June 2019, 834,000 pieces of such content were removed from the platform, 77 per cent of which were not reported by Instagram users.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
