And he resented the fact that I had hinted that maybe he change his life a little bit and he\u2019d be happier if he tried something else.\n\n\"The person has actually got to want it. It\u2019s like me in the end; I really wanted it. I had two alternatives: one, to die, and one to live, and I wanted to live. But that\u2019s the difference if you want it, and poor George didn\u2019t want it.\u201d\n\nElton confessed his shock feelings as he spoke to close friend Sharon Osbourne on US TV show The Talk.\n\nRecalling the Careless Whisper star\u2019s death, he told her: \u201cI remember talking to you the day he died on Christmas Day, and I phoned you, and I was in Aspen and Ozzy got on the phone, and he said, \u2018He didn\u2019t want to be here.\u2019 And I thought that\u2019s the most succinct apt thing: he didn\u2019t want to be here.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\n\"He was so uncomfortable in his skin about being gay even though he said he wasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nElton admitted: \u201cWe all make terrible mistakes, and some of us are addicts when we are born, and we have to battle that addiction, but you can turn the corner and you can get help and it\u2019s been the most wonderful decision I\u2019ve made.\u201d\n\nHe then appeared to take a subtle swipe at the singer\u2019s former live-in lover and last partner Fadi Fawaz as he likened his battle to get clean with Michael.\n\n\"Part of your recovery was helping people who wanted help,\u201d he said, \u201cbut also, other people around me didn\u2019t want me to be sober: my mother, my personal assistant, my manager, because they lost control, or they began to lose control. But yeah, the whole point of sobriety is that when you get sober, you help other people. It\u2019s a fellowship.\u201d\n\nElton recalled how he saved fashion designer Donatella Versace from losing her life through addiction.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nHe added: \u201cIf Donatella can get sober and I can get sober, then anyone can get sober.\n\n\u201cDonatella came to a concert and we knew she had a problem and she would dodge me like a bullet because she didn\u2019t want me to see her and she was in a terrible state.\n\n\u201cAnd I said, \u2018She \u2018s ready.\u2019\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s come here and she was crying, but it was a cry for help. And I said,\u2018Let\u2019s do it. She\u2019s ready.\u2019\n\n\u201cAnd it was a hilarious event because it was not normal. She\u2019s sitting there in a $100,000 ball gown, and she resisted slightly and she went. It was very funny. She was like, \u2018I will come, but I don\u2019t want any oily food.\u2019 But she\u2019s been sober ever since.\u201d\n\nIn May 2017, Darren Salter, senior coroner for the county of Oxfordshire, said a post-mortem has found that the singer died of \"dilated cardiomyopathy with myocarditis and fatty liver.\"\n\nDilated cardiomyopathy is a condition in which the left ventricle of the heart becomes stretched and weakened, limiting the heart's ability to pump blood.\n\nMyocarditis is inflammation of the heart muscle.\n\nThe former Wham! singer was found dead at his country home in Goring, Oxfordshire. He was 53.\n\nMichael only revealed he was gay after he was arrested in Beverly Hills in 1998 when he was 34 years old.\n\nThe arrest, by an undercover cop in a public toilet, led to him being charged with 'lewd behaviour' and handed a $500 fine, as well as 80 hours of community service.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Sir Elton, 72, said his friend 'didn't want' to live any longer when he passed away on Christmas Day 2016", "authors": ["Christopher Bucktin", "Image", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20716895.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_George-Michael-and-Elton-John-Charity-Performance-At-The-Royal-Opera-House.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
