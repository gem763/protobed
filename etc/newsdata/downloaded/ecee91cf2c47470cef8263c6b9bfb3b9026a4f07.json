An abuse of power can be wrong but not a felony.\"\n\nThe \"Cuomo Prime Time\" anchor then asked Trump's attorney if he thought it was \"okay\" for the president to ask Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to \"help him with a political opponent.\"\n\nCNN ANCHOR ATTACKS TRUMP, DEFENDS BIDEN FROM '100 PERCENT WRONG' AND 'BASELESS' ACCUSATIONS'\n\n\"That's not what the president said in the transcript and you've read it and you know that it's not what the president said,\" Sekulow responded. \"And Joe Biden bragged on television that he gave a prosecutor in Ukraine to be fired in six hours or a billion dollars was going to be withheld. Do you think that's a quid pro quo?\"\n\n\"And think it's absolutely a quid pro quo,\" Cuomo conceded, \"but it wasn't done for personal advantage.\"\n\n\"Oh, really?\" Sekulow sarcastically reacted. \"Chris, you know that's not the case.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nEarlier in the day, Cuomo's daytime colleague Brooke Baldwin defended Biden, insisting Trump's claims are \"100 percent wrong\" and \"baseless.\"\n\n\"There is no evidence of wrongdoing, including by Ukrainian prosecutors,\" Baldwin said. \"Joe Biden is indeed on tape talking about withholding aid because the U.S. and Western nations wanted a corrupt prosecutor out. In fact, the goal of Western nations at the time was to get prosecutors who would investigate corruption. So, first and foremost, those are the facts.\u201d", "description": "CNN anchor Chris Cuomo made a rare admission on Wednesday night that former Vice President Joe Biden \"absolutely\" engaged in a quid pro quo with Ukraine, but insisted it wasn't for \"personal advantage.\"", "authors": ["Joseph Wulfsohn", "Joseph A.
