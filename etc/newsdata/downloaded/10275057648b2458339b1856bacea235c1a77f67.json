The impeachment process, because for some Republicans it makes them want to rally around the flag. Now I remember when I was anti-Bill Clinton from the Left in the \u201890s and then they tried to impeach him, and suddenly Clinton was my best friend and I was, like, 'Leave Bill Clinton alone,'\" Jones said on Thursday.\n\n\"So I think, you know, you get crosscurrents in this thing. At the same time, the Democrats are in a lose-lose situation, and if they don\u2019t do something, their own base is going to feel disappointed and you feel like maybe Trump gets away too much. If you go through with the impeachment though, you can divide the country further, you take the oxygen away from your candidates, and you still don\u2019t solve the problem of foreign interference,\" Jones said.\n\nHe added the whole situation was \"a big mess.\"\n\nSince Congressional Democrats have fully committed to the impeachment inquiry over Trump pushing Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, in exchange for military aid, Trump's reelection campaign has raked in large amounts of money.\n\nIn the 24 hours after Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi endorsed the impeachment inquiry in September, Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale said they and the Republican Party had raised $5 million.", "description": ".10/04/2019 12:49:53PM EST.", "authors": ["Julio Rosas", "Guy Benson", "Katie Pavlich", "Cortney O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/images/2019/277/3770f970-e452-4561-8877-31826b26be0d.png", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
