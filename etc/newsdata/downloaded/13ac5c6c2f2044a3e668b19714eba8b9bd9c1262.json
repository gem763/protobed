According to RTE, the information came from technical papers, officially called \u201cnon-papers,\u201d sent by London to Brussels.\n\nResponding on Twitter, Coveney said: \"Non-Paper = Non-Starter. Time the EU had a serious proposal from the UK Govt if a #Brexit deal is to be achievable in October. NI and IRE deserves better!\"\n\nFollowing up on the story, the U.K.'s Daily Telegraph newspaper reported Johnson would present his new proposals, including those related to the clearing centers, to EU officials this week.", "description": "UK PM wants to replace Irish backstop with customs checkpoints on either side of the border.", "authors": ["Jack Blanchard", "Naomi O'Leary"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-912503240-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
