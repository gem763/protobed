However, the U.K. government in July moved to intervene in the deal to examine its national-security impact.\n\nTo address concerns raised by the U.K. Ministry of Defense, the companies pledged to maintain existing security measures and implement enhanced controls to protect sensitive information and technology from unauthorized access as well as to continue the provision of certain capabilities and to maintain a U.K.-registered company to ensure that services remain under the country\u2019s jurisdiction, Morgan said.\n\nMorgan on Wednesday launched a consultation period on the draft remedies proposed by the companies, which will run until Oct. 24, but said she proposed to accept them instead of referring the deal to an in-depth probe.", "description": "U.K.\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority found no competition issues arising from takeover deal for Inmarsat.", "authors": ["Adria Calatayud"], "top_image": "https://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
