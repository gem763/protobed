Vegan meringues are better baked until completely dry in the centre. They are prone to getting sticky on the outside when exposed to humidity. You can always dry them out again in a low oven.\n\nMakes: one tray of meringues\n\n\n\nFor the meringue:\n\n120g egg whites (or aquafaba)\n\nPinch of cream of tartar (optional)\n\n180g caster sugar\n\n\n\nPlus:\n\nOrange, green, red and black gel food dyes (or use your favourite colours)\n\nEdible glue (or a paste made of icing sugar and water)\n\nEdible eyes and sprinkles\n\nAdd the egg white or aquafaba to a stand mixer bowl (you could use an electric whisk, but you will be whisking for a long time). Mix on high speed until you have soft peaks, whisk in the cream of tartar, then add the sugar a tablespoon at a time, whisking for about 30 seconds to a minute after each addition. It is important to add the sugar very slowly so that it all dissolves.\n\nWhen all the sugar has incorporated (the mixture should feel smooth between your fingers), divide the meringue between different bowls depending on how many colours you want to make. Stir the gel food dye into each bowl until evenly distributed.\n\nFor the pumpkins, slip a piping nozzle with lots of open teeth into your piping bag before spooning in orange-coloured meringue. When you pipe, it will look like the ridges on a pumpkin. Pipe a small amount of green meringue for the stalk (just snip the end of a piping bag for this). For the ghosts, fill a piping bag with white meringue (you can use other colours, too), cut a medium tip and pipe meringue kisses. You can also use your fingers to pinch the sides to create little arms, or pipe on little arms. For the tall ghosts with a rippled effect, alternate between squeezing and stopping squeezing your piping bag while working your way upwards. Play about with other shapes and effects.\n\nBake for 45-60min at 120C (100C fan)/250F/gas mark \u00bd for meringues that are gooey in the centre. For completely crisp and dry meringues, bake for 1hr 30min and then switch off the oven and leave the oven door closed for a few hours.\n\nTo decorate, use red gel food dye for blood (you can thin this with a little water) and black gel food dye for other details. Use edible glue to stick on edible eyes and sprinkles (eg bones).", "description": "Get your inner ghoul going with these mini meringue treats", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9a66fe6048259820e30fcbd0904e20a050694ee/0_219_6570_3942/master/6570.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=90a9af87c6f6bce98cc4c63173672660", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
