On Monday, he returns to the state for the first time since taking office to hold a re-election rally near Albuquerque.\n\nNew Mexico is among a handful of states Mr. Trump\u2019s well-financed campaign contends he can take from Democrats in 2020. The bravado comes amid continued Republican worries over Mr. Trump holding on to Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan, states that were essential to his 2016 victory.\n\n\u201cWe go into states with the assumption that we\u2019re going to win,\u201d said Rick Gorka, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee. The campaign is preparing to announce staff hiring for New Mexico and will invest in voter registration efforts, neither of which were done in 2016.\n\nOther states the campaign is eyeing as pickups, including Minnesota, New Hampshire and Nevada, were closer in 2016 than New Mexico, causing some skepticism even among Republicans. The state hasn\u2019t favored a Republican for president since 2004. Following Mr. Trump\u2019s election, Democrats have taken back the governor\u2019s mansion, increased a hold on the legislature and now control all three Congressional seats.\n\n\u201cWe take nothing for granted but the fact that the Trump campaign says their path forward lies through New Mexico is an indication they don\u2019t have a realistic argument about a path to 270 electoral votes,\u201d said David Bergstein, a spokesman for the Democratic National Committee.\n\nAs will be the case nationally, Mr. Trump\u2019s argument in New Mexico will focus on the economy.\n\nIn Albuquerque, aides say, he will tout overall job gains with a particular focus on Hispanics, who make up 40% of the state\u2019s electorate, and play up his trade battles. The campaign also thinks he can draw a contrast with a progressive policy shift New Mexico has seen under a new Democratic governor and the Democratic gains in the legislature. Lawmakers have pushed for more abortion access, stricter gun control and gender-neutral bathrooms.\n\nThe Trump campaign argues his positions on immigration resonate with Hispanic voters in New Mexico who value border security.

Michelle Lujan Grisham signed into law landmark energy legislation mandating emission-free electricity by 2045. Several leading Democratic presidential candidates have outlined their own proposals, including bans on fracking, which has been a boon to New Mexico\u2019s economy.\n\n\u201cNew Mexico has a long liberal perspective, but there has been an overreach,\u201d said Republican state Rep. Rod Montoya. \u201cThere is an opportunity here.\u201d\n\nDespite Mr. Trump\u2019s charged rhetoric about immigration, which has drawn criticism from Republicans in New Mexico, his campaign argues his positions resonate with Hispanic voters who value border security and want people to enter the country legally.\n\nCampaign manager Brad Parscale asserted in a conference call with reporters Wednesday that the president\u2019s tough trade stance with China is also resonating with Hispanic voters, and that is among the reasons driving the decision to compete for the state.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS How likely is it that President Trump can win New Mexico in 2020? Join the conversation below.\n\nA rally held in El Paso, Texas, earlier this year drew a number of Hispanics from New Mexico, according to the campaign, and helped convince Mr. Trump he should engage there. His last rally in the state drew a large crowd and was met with a rowdy protest, including clashes with police.\n\nStrong fundraising has buttressed the Trump campaign\u2019s hopes of expanding its electoral map. Through the second quarter of this year, $105 million has been raised between the campaign and the Republican National Committee, beating President Barack Obama \u2019s re-election fundraising during the same period eight years ago.\n\nRoughly $100 million remains in the bank and Mr. Trump is continuing a rapid fundraising schedule; after New Mexico he will travel to California for four events over two days.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump won a very, very narrow electoral victory in 2016, so it\u2019s natural to try to spread the field going into 2020,\u201d said Michael Steel, a former top Republican House aide who isn\u2019t involved in the campaign. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to know if it\u2019s realistic until we know his opponent, but given his campaign\u2019s vast resources, there\u2019s no reason not to try.\u201d\n\nWrite to Alex Leary at alex.leary@wsj.com", "description": "President Trump will return to New Mexico on Monday for the first time since taking office to hold a re-election rally near Albuquerque.
