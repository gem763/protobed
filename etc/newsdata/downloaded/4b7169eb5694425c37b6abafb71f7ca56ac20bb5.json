While many may feel frustrated at the prospect of another Liberal term, and others with the difficulties that come with running a minority, I feel frustration at how we have arrived at this result.\n\nThe seat allocation in the House of Commons doesn't represent what citizens wanted.\n\nAccording to the CBC, here are the number of seats won and the percentage of the popular vote earned by each party in this federal election:\n\nLiberals: 157 seats (with 33.1 per cent of the popular vote).\n\n157 seats (with 33.1 per cent of the popular vote).

People's Party: No seats (1.6 per cent of the popular vote).\n\nThis is what happens with the first-past-the-post system. We are not fairly represented, because some parties take disproportionate hits while others make disproportionate gains.\n\nJust look at the numbers. The Conservatives have more support than the Liberals, yet have 36 fewer seats.\n\nThe Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois have half the support of the NDP, but eight more seats.\n\nThe BQ and Greens are closely matched in support, and yet the BQ have 10 times more seats.\n\nThe People's Party has four times the support of Independents and yet no seats, while Independents have one.\n\nThe clear beneficiaries of first-past-the-post in Monday night's election were the Liberals and the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois. The BQ in particular made enormous, disproportionate gains \u2014 and in no fair world should they have more seats than the NDP or 10 times more than the Greens.\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau celebrates the Liberal Party victory with his supporters in Montreal on Oct. 21.

NDP: 54 seats (an increase of 30 seats or 125 per cent).\n\n54 seats (an increase of 30 seats or 125 per cent). Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois: 26 seats (a decrease of eight seats or 31 per cent).\n\n26 seats (a decrease of eight seats or 31 per cent).

People's Party: Five seats (an increase from none).\n\nFive seats (an increase from none). Independent: One seat (no change).\n\nThe total number of votes cast for each party indicates that, as a country, we wanted the Conservatives to have more seats than the Liberals, the NDP to have double the BQ, the Greens and BQ to be roughly even, and the PPC to have a handful.\n\nI'm not suggesting that popular vote and seat allocation should be in perfect tandem, but when you do the math it is illustrative that something must change.\n\nHow the 338-seat House of Commons breaks down, by party, after the 2019 election. (CBC News)\n\nAnd if you remember, Trudeau and the Liberals promised four years ago that it would.\n\nInstead, Trudeau broke a central campaign promise of 2015. His stated reason was that there was no consensus among Canadians about how to go about doing it \u2014 as if there is no possible way to address that challenge.\n\nHowever, I believe there is a much more personal Liberal reason. As Trudeau implored days before this year's election:\n\n\"In terms of the NDP and the Greens, remember this: If you want progressive action, you need a progressive government, not a progressive opposition. Voting Liberal is the only way to stop Conservative cuts.\"\n\nThe Liberals would be losers if first past the post were replaced. As Trudeau knows, progressive voters choosing between the Liberals, NDP, and Greens will often strategically vote Liberal in order to prevent the Conservative option from gaining power. (The PPC offers another conservative option, but isn't significant enough yet to vote-split the right.)\n\nReneging on their 2015 promise was, in my opinion, a cynical move on the part of the Liberals to ensure their seat count remains bloated. And it isn't acceptable.\n\nThe Liberals would have lost the election to the Conservatives if the first-past-the-post system had been replaced by proportional representation. (Michael Wilson/CBC)\n\nArguably, were we to reform our electoral system, it could change how politicians conduct campaigns and in turn how citizens vote. We would likely see different results, but results that better reflect us as a population. There are also systems that could retain our political ridings while still being proportional.\n\nBut we need fair representation in this country. We need consultation, serious dialogue, and expert advice on which electoral system would be fair. We need to be mindful of thresholds that could preclude radical fringe parties.\n\nWe may need a referendum on it, or on the options, as the Conservatives wanted in 2015.\n\nAnd we need the parties that benefit from it the most to do the right thing and reform our broken electoral system.\n\nIf we do not, we will continue with unfair elections that do not properly represent the voice of our citizenry.", "description": "While some are unhappy at the prospect of another Liberal term, and others with the difficulties that come with running a minority government, Warren Bowen feels frustration at the electoral system itself and how it generated this election result.", "authors": ["Warren Bowen Holds An Ma The University Of British Columbia.
