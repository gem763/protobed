Up to 6-7 million local investors are expected to participate in the listing, he added, but it is not clear how many of them will use credit to finance their share purchases.\n\nThe authority is assessing \"risk weighting and wants to ensure there will be no (regulatory) breaches\", a second source said.\n\nThe source said SAMA's questions - via telephone and email - were around how banks classify their exposure to Aramco, including its subsidiaries.\n\n\"Aramco has so much ownership in so many entities ... it's hard to say how much exposure it comes to,\" he said.\n\nThe world's most profitable company, Aramco dominates the local economy with over a dozen domestic subsidiaries in addition to partial ownership in joint ventures including power generation companies and large petrochemical firms such as Petro Rabigh (SE: ).\n\nSaudi banks have been under pressure in the past few years from a slowdown in the construction and retail sectors, but \"funding and liquidity remained sound, with deposit and loan growth roughly in line, and capital ratios solid\", Fitch rating agency said this summer.\n\nThe central bank's governor, Ahmed al-Kholifey, said last month that he did not expect the IPO to affect liquidity in the Saudi banking sector, but that SAMA may revise its lending regulations to facilitate availability of liquidity to investors before the IPO.\n\nSAMA and Aramco did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nPRESSING AHEAD\n\nSaudi Arabia is pressing ahead with plans to sell between 1% and 2% of its oil company, the world's largest, through a local listing, which might be followed by additional share sales locally and internationally.\n\nAramco has approached wealthy Saudi families in recent weeks as part of wider efforts to build a large investor base to achieve the $2 trillion valuation targeted by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, two sources previously told Reuters.\n\nThe local listing \u2013 crucial to Prince Mohammed's plans to wean the Saudi economy off its oil dependence \u2013 could raise more than $20 billion in its initial phase.\n\nAramco has been meeting analysts over the past few weeks to market the company ahead of the listing. Analysts' reports are expected to be released on Oct. 20.\n\nThe company's main advisers last week started pre-IPO meetings with potential investors in the United States, Europe and Asia, to gauge demand for the deal, two sources said.\n\nAn IPO prospectus in Arabic could be released to investors on Oct. 25 and an English one for the wider market on Oct. 27, the sources said.\n\nThis week, Fitch downgraded Aramco by one notch to an 'A' credit rating, citing last month's attacks and rising geopolitical tensions in the region.\n\nRiyadh has blamed adversary Iran for the attacks, a charge Tehran denies.\n\nAramco's bonds fell after the rating announcement, which was widely expected as it followed a similar downgrade of the sovereign on Sept. 30.", "description": "Exclusive: Saudi central bank vets local lenders ahead of Aramco IPO \u2013 sources", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF970TT_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
