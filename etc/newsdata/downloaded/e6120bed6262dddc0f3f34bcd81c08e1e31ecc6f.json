She was sitting on the curb, her car parked across the street, talking on the phone and minding her own business.\n\nThat's when police officers arrived. They believed she might be in possession of illegal drugs and asked to search her car. After she agreed, they called a female officer to also search her. Even though she didn't have any contraband, they said she couldn't leave until she was fully searched by detective Mara Wilson, according to court records filed last year in the Western District of Texas and seen by Insider.\n\n\"Do you have anything on you?\" Wilson asked Simms, per a transcript of dash-cam footage included in the lawsuit.\n\n\"No, ma'am, nothing,\" Simms replied.\n\nLater, Wilson, who allegedly did not have a warrant at the time, asked Simms if she could pull down her shorts.\n\nOut in the public, as cars drove by, Wilson conducted a vaginal cavity search, the lawsuit said. Wilson instructed Simms to \"spread your legs,\" and asked, \"do you have anything down here before I reach down here?\"\n\n\"Natalie began to realize, with shock, what Officer Wilson intended to do,\" according to the lawsuit. \"Officer Wilson intended to reach down into Natalie's pants and made contact with her pubic hair and vagina.\"\n\nWhen Simms told Wilson that she was on her period, the lawsuit alleges that Wilson lied by saying she wasn't going to reach into her pants but just \"look.\" Instead, with five male officers watching, Wilson \"pulled open Natalie's pants and underwear.\"\n\nAfter noticing Simm's tampon string during her search, she decided to pull. She did so \"knowing that Natalie was on her period,\" and even though \"Natalie had not consented to such a search, seizure, and/or use of force,\" according to the lawsuit.\n\n\"Is that a tampon?\" Wilson asked.\n\n\"It's full of blood, right?\" Simms said, in shock. \"Why would you do that?\"\n\n\"I don't know. It looked like it had stuff in there.\"\n\nA proposed $205,000 settlement\n\nFollowing the search, Simms sued the city of San Antonio and Wilson, who is now retired, alleging the encounter to be a \"blatant violation\" of her constitutional rights that \"resulted in significant and lasting harm.\"\n\n\"Natalie suffered through a shocking display of what can occur when police power is unchecked. Natalie was humiliated and degraded as a result of the police officer's actions,\" her attorney Dean Malone told local news station WOAI in March 2018. \"We intend to seek full damages available under the law and look forward to presenting Natalie's horrible experience to a jury.\"\n\nIn a surprise twist to Simm's case, however, city lawyers offered $205,000 to Simms, who is now 40. On Thursday, the city council will vote on the proposed settlement, according to San Antonio Express-News. The paper added that Simms and her attorney have agreed to that sum, which will be paid from the city's Self-Assurance Liability Fund, according to the city's agenda of Thursday's meeting.\n\nMalone told Insider that the two parties went to mediation, ultimately negotiating the proposed settlement. He said that if the city council doesn't accept that amount, they are fully prepared to go to trial.\n\n\"This wasn't really about money for her at all, it was about the return of her dignity,\" Malone said. \"When she filed suit it was to assert her rights and obviously she believed that she had been violated.\"\n\nAfter pulling out Simm's tampon, and ignoring her repeated claims she wasn't hiding contraband, as well as multiple requests to be taken to the police station, Wilson continued with the search. \"She decided at one point to run her fingers along Natalie's vaginal lips,\" according to the lawsuit. At one point, Wilson made a comment that \"you're very hairy.\"\n\n\"Officer Wilson had violated Natalie vaginally, and now it appeared that she might violate Natalie anally. She was doing so without a warrant, with no medical personnel present, and on a public street in view of several people as well as those passing by,\" the lawsuit said.\n\n\"But, Miss, this is like in public. Come on now. You already pulled the tampon out,\" Simms protested, after Wilson asked her to turn around and, once again, spread her legs, according to the lawsuit.", "description": "San Antonio may award a woman $205,000 after she accused a police officer of inappropriately searching her and pulling out her tampon in public.", "authors": ["Nicole Einbinder"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/gROZ947e_0TCxodbboeAOw--~B/aD02Njc7dz04ODk7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/insider_articles_922/2534123d6455c0c41befb1de7edf9bd7", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
