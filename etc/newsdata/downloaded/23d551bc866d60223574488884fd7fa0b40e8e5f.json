Along with the Navy SEALs, it is the most highly trained special operations force in the US military and the world.\n\nUS Army\n\nDelta Force, headquartered at Fort Bragg in North Carolina, draws candidates from throughout the military, including the Coast Guard and National Guard, but mostly selects from the Army. Many of the operators likely come from the Army Rangers and the Green Berets.\n\nThe classified group was established in 1977 by Col. Charlie A. Beckwith, who wrote a memoir about founding the elite group called \"Delta Force,\" according to We Are The Mighty.\n\nBeckwith saw the need for a force that could mobilize quickly to fight unconventional threats \u2014 a force like the British Special Air Service, with which he served as an exchange officer in 1962.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDelta Force's operations are often secret, but we do know that the unit was involved in the death of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.\n\nReuters\n\nDelta Force was famously involved in the 1993 operation to capture Somali militia leader Mohamed Farrah Aidid in Mogadishu and the subsequent effort to rescue Army pilot Michael Durant after his helicopter crashed during the mission.\n\nFive Delta operators were killed in that incident, as well as 14 other US troops. Several hundred Somali fighters and civilians were also killed.\n\nDelta was also involved in a failed effort to retrieve hostages from the US Embassy in Iran in 1980.\n\nDelta Force has been heavily involved in the war in Afghanistan and both Iraq wars and was instrumental in capturing Saddam Hussein.\n\nDelta pulled out of Iraq when US forces there left in 2011, but it has been a consistent presence in the fight against ISIS in the country, Wesley Morgan wrote in The Washington Post in 2015.", "description": "Delta Force, established in 1977, carries out some of the most challenging and dangerous missions in the world.", "authors": ["Ellen Ioanes"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/WsLM24SNvOywZEYfxh5D.Q--~B/aD01MTI7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/business_insider_articles_888/4813a03441cbff99de12a7e4e4ef6165", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
