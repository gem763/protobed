Jeremy Corbyn said it was a farce.\n\nQueen's Arrival for Queen's Speech Queen Elizabeth II is now at Westminster for the State Opening of Parliament and her Queen's Speech, prepared and given by prime minister Boris Johnson. The Queen's Speech outlines Johnson's agenda for the session. The Guardian Live Blog has coverage. Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn has condemned the government\u2019s planned legislative programme outlined in the Queen\u2019s speech as \u201ca farce\u201d, as he signalled he would back a general election that could deliver a Labour government within weeks. \"There has never been such a farce as a Government with a majority of -45 and a 100% record of defeat in the House of Commons setting out a legislative agenda they know cannot be delivered in this parliament,\" said Corbyn. Boris Johnson\u2019s hopes of getting a new Brexit deal through parliament depend to a large extend on the 10 Democratic Unionist party MPs. That is not necessarily because those votes are essential \u2013 if Johnson could win over a significant number of Labour MPs, he could make up for those lost 10 votes \u2013 so much as the fact the DUP support would help to unlock a chunk of hardline Tory Brexiter support. There were 28 Tory Brexiters who voted against Theresa May\u2019s deal three times, partly because of its impact on the union, but they would find it hard to object to a Johnson deal on unionist grounds if the DUP was in favour. Queen Says The Queen starts by saying the government\u2019s priority \u201chas always been to secure the United Kingdom\u2019s departure from the European Union on 31 October\u201d.\n\nThe Queen says says the government wants a new partnership with the EU, based on free trade.\n\nThe Queen says the government\u2019s new economic plan will be underpinned by a new fiscal strategy.\n\nThe Queen says the government wants everyone to have access to an excellent education.\n\nThe Queen says the government is committed to the environment. There will be measures to improve air and water quality, and to promote the welfare of animals. Trophy hunting will be banned. Full Text of Queen's Speech Here's the Full Text of the Queen's Speech. The text is 130 pages long with dozens of legislative ideas on the Withdrawal Bill, education, the environment, NATO, public finance, electoral fraud, animal welfare, infrastructure, national security, and health care to name a few. Boost for Johnson Hardline Brexit rebel Lee Rowley, one of the 28 so-called Brexiter \u201cSpartans\u201d who voted against Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal three times, opened the Queen\u2019s speech debate giving a boost to Johnson. Rowley said he would support Johnson's Deal. Pointless Debate This the maddest, most pointless Queen's Speech debate anyone alive has watched - because it is all displacement activity from the only two questions that matter, namely whether the UK is leaving the EU on 31 October (and if so how) and whether there will be a general... \u2014 Robert Peston (@Peston) October 14, 2019\n\nWhat About DUP?\n\nAn Irish Times story quotes the DUP MP Jim Shannon saying anything that does not treat Northern Ireland the same as England would be unacceptable. Shannon said: It is simple. Are we being treated the same as England? No, we are not. Therefore, if we are not being treated the same as England, then we are not going to accept it.\n\nIreland on Board\n\nI dismiss that. If the hard Brexiteers come on board that will be that.\n\nNotably, Simon Coveney, the Irish foreign minister and deputy prime minister, said this morning that a Brexit deal \u201cmay ... be possible this week\u201d ahead of a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Luxembourg.\n\nWhat Happened?\n\nThe number one priority of Boris Johnson is to stay in power.\n\nThe number one priority of the Irish Taoiseach (Prime Minister), Leo Varadkar, is to stay in power.\n\nVaradkar did not want to face a 2021 election with Ireland taking a 4% hit to GDP. Voters would likely hold that against him, no matter what they felt about EU unity.\n\nSimilarly, Johnson did not want to face voters in the event of short-term medical shortages and long lines crossing the tunnel under the English Channel.\n\nGood Deal?\n\nDid Johnson negotiate a good deal? It's hard to say because the final details are not in.\n\nInstead of all of the UK being permanently stuck in a backstop customs union, perhaps only Ireland is. And perhaps there is a time limit of some kind or voting procedure to break that impact.\n\nWe do not know what changes, if any, Johnson can get on the political declaration.\n\nBut on the surface this seems like a far better deal that what Theresa May negotiated.\n\nBinary Choice\n\nIf Johnson demands, and gets, word from the EU that it's this deal or a hard Brexit, the MPs will face the binary choice that Theresa May wanted but never succeeded in getting.\n\nThen we will see precisely where the \"Stop No Deal\" advocates really stand.\n\nMost likely, a short extension will be required to get the bill passed in the UK and EU parliaments.\n\nExpect a Deal\n\nMy baseline scenario is now a deal. There's positive movement on many fronts.", "description": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson presented the Queen's Speech outlining his .10/15/2019 11:01:33AM EST.", "authors": ["Mike Shedlock", "Guy Benson", "Timothy Meads", "Leah Barkoukis", "Cortney O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/306/4dd026fa-cfcb-4099-a6da-0aa0af379f2c.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
