There were no reports so far of any impact on aircraft or ships in the vicinity.\n\nChief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said that particular missile fell at 7:27 a.m. local time, or 2227 GMT, while another one a few minutes earlier fell outside of Japan's EEZ.\n\nThe launch was North Korea's ninth since U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un met at the heavily guarded Demilitarized Zone between the two Koreas in June.\n\nIt came just a day after Pyongyang announced it had agreed with the United States to hold working-level talks on Saturday, a development that could potentially break months of stalemate.\n\nTalks aimed at dismantling North Korea's nuclear and missile programmes have been stalled since the second summit between Trump and Kim in Vietnam in February ended without a deal.\n\nTrump has played down North Korea's recent series of short-range launches, saying in September the United States and North Korea \"didn't have an agreement on short-range missiles\" and that many countries test such weapons.\n\n\"North Korea has recycled its carrot-and-stick strategy against the U.S. multiple times with great success,\" said Lee Sung-yoon, Professor of Korean Studies at The Fletcher School at Tufts University.", "description": "A North Korean missile appears to have fallen into Japan's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) on Wednesday morning, Japan's top government spokesman said, adding there were no reports so far of any impact on aircraft or ships in the vicinity.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/104874678-RTX3KFX1.jpg?v=1529452404", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
