The incident is notable because the act of mining a limited number of vessels makes relatively little sense when viewed through the lens of traditional patterns of coercive behavior. Limited coercive acts typically have little value with regards to gaining concessions from a determined opponent. Generally, these acts may serve as a visible demonstration of a state\u2019s willingness to enact some other, more substantial threat, such as shutting down the Strait of Hormuz outright. However, this requires the state making the threat to have the capacity to make good on its more substantial threats and for its opponents to believe that it is willing to incur the risks entailed. Iran, however, could not shut down the Strait of Hormuz for very long even if it wished to\u2014something noted by President Donald Trump\u2014and is unlikely to incur the substantial risks that an attempt would entail. Iran\u2019s opponents, then, clearly don\u2019t see its limited provocations as harbingers of something worse.\n\nIf Iran cannot shut down the Strait of Hormuz, or convince either the United States or its regional allies such as Saudi Arabia that it can do so, then it becomes attendant to ask what the value of limited coercive acts is. One argument goes that limited actions can achieve disruption and price spikes with regards to oil irrespective of whether Iran can shut down the Strait o Hormuz. However, it is unclear how this would help coerce either the United States or Iran\u2019s regional adversaries. Driving up the price of oil globally does not hurt regional countries, which rank among the world\u2019s major oil producers, and will likely have mixed effects on the economic health of the United States, which is an increasingly large player in the energy market. To the extent that limited attacks could serve a coercive role, it would be as costly signals of Iran\u2019s willingness to shut down the Strait of Hormuz entirely\u2014something that would have a major effect on regional powers which rely on the straits for up to 90 percent of their imports and exports. Given that Iran\u2019s ability to sustain such an operation is limited, however, and given that shutting down the Strait of Hormuz entirely entails unacceptable escalatory risks , it is unclear why decisionmakers in Tehran would expect their counterparts in Riyadh or Washington to treat the threat to do so as being credible irrespective of Iran\u2019s limited provocations. Even if leaders worry that they might have miscalculated Tehran\u2019s intentions, the fact remains that Iran\u2019s capabilities cannot sustain the closure of the Strait of Hormuz for a prolonged period of time. To make this threat credible then, Iran\u2019s likely opponents would have to believe that Iran would risk heavy retaliation, the possible dismantlement of IRGCN facilities at Abu Musa and Farsi and a postwar settlement which would almost certainly be negative in order to create a temporary closure of the Strait of Hormuz.\n\nA window into Iran\u2019s strategic calculus, however, might be provided by way of an analogy with nuclear strategy. Scholars and practitioners have long puzzled why states would seek to maintain breakout capabilities. Easy to destroy and risky to produce, these very limited capabilities provide virtually no deterrent against a well-armed adversary. The possession of nuclear breakout capabilities makes sense, however, in the context of what Vipin Narang dubs a catalytic strategy. The target audience of a catalytic strategy is one\u2019s partners not one\u2019s adversary. By threatening to make a situation more volatile in a way that might endanger some of a larger partner\u2019s interests a smaller state can secure support and concessions from its larger partners. Thus, for example, several of America\u2019s Cold War partners maintained nuclear breakout capabilities because threat they posed to the U.S. nonproliferation agenda served to ensure sustained American support. This was because American policymakers calculated that security concessions to allies would prevent them from taking more radical steps to ensure their own security such as nuclear breakout.", "description": "Impeding global shipping.", "authors": ["Sidharth Kaushal"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/DYJON7lmbQRkIHwbxGgnOA--~B/aD0xMTA1O3c9MTQ0MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/f3b58358f6a57bbc2dea6276cfbe2ab3", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
