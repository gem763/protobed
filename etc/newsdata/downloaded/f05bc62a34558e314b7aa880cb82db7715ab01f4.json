The Democratic Party and the media (to the extent that the two are distinct from one another) are full of Clinton sycophants and enablers (George Stephanopoulos, Paul Begala, John Podesta, etc.), and Gabbard was not wrong to point out that many of them are still eager to do the dirty work of Democrats\u2019 ancien r\u00e9gime.\n\nThe party of Tulsi Gabbard has a future. The party of Hillary Clinton has a past.\n\nAs a conservative, I\u2019d prefer a Bill Clinton-style Democratic Party to one dominated by the dotty and fanciful thinking of Bernie Sanders or Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. But that is not where the Democratic Party is today, and it is fair for the younger, more left-leaning activists who represent the Democratic Party today to look at all of this endless Clinton psychodrama and ask: \u201cWhat\u2019s in it for us?\u201d\n\nThe subtle blend of fecklessness and vindictiveness that Mrs. Clinton brings to Democratic politics offers nothing except name recognition.", "description": "", "authors": ["Kevin Williamson", "Nypost.Com Tulsi-Gabbard-Dust-Up-Shows-Dems-Need-To-Dump-Clintons-For-Good"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
