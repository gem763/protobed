Karen Kwan said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bipartisan issue. It\u2019s not one side or the other saying it\u2019s important,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is the time to do it right.\u201d\n\nFunding and representation concerns are on the minds of many state leaders around the country. In California, for example, a think tank has estimated a 4% undercount could lead to the loss of a House seat. In New Mexico, the governor has warned a 1% percent inaccuracy could translate into more than $700 million in lost federal revenue over a decade.\n\nStates spending the most money are largely led by Democrats and include Illinois, New York and California, which is spending the most at $187 million, according to data provided by the National Conference of State Legislatures.\n\nConservative-leaning states such as Georgia, Alabama and North Dakota have also allocated funding.\n\nWhile the count itself will be run by the federal government, state-run outreach efforts are expected to include things such as public service messages, fliers in the mail, home visits and gatherings.\n\nIn Utah, half of the money allocated by the Legislature will be spent for programs aimed at tallying groups that are historically undercounted, including a relatively large population of children under 5.\n\nAnother undercount there could have a major impact on federal funding for things such as school lunches and after-school programming, said Ze Min Xiao, director of the Salt Lake County Office for New Americans, which is leading census outreach in Salt Lake County.\n\nCounty leaders are also spending money to reach immigrants who may still have a fear of participating sparked by the Trump administration\u2019s now-abandoned plans for a citizenship question on the census form.\n\nThe once-a-decade count will be the first done primarily online, which could make it harder to tally people living in Utah\u2019s vast rural spaces. People can also request paper or phone questionnaires.\n\nOn the Utah section of Navajo Nation, which also stretches into Arizona and New Mexico, many homes don\u2019t have electricity or running water. Almost none have internet access.\n\nUtah got about $5.7 billion a year in federal funding as of 2016 for everything from Medicaid to highways, according to an analysis by George Washington University. That means the state could lose an average of $1,800 for each person who goes uncounted.\n\nA census-outreach funding proposal failed during the regular legislative session, but it was re-introduced and passed easily this week.\n\nUnder federal rules, Utah can\u2019t count the thousands of young members of the state\u2019s predominant faith, long known as the Mormon church, who are out of the state on proselyting missions.\n\nThat became a point of contention when Utah narrowly lost out on getting a fourth U.S. House seat in 2000, though it came through a decade later.\n\n\u201cPersonally, I think it\u2019s very critical that we get an accurate count,\u201d said Utah Republican Rep. Jefferson Moss. \u201cA lot of decisions in our state are tied to the census.\u201d", "description": "Utah became the latest on Monday as its GOP-dominated Legislature voted to spend $1 million on outreach for the census, a first for the state that's one of the youngest and fastest-growing in the country.", "authors": ["Lindsay Whitehurst", "Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2019/07/2019-06-26T160635Z_1490743446_RC1C25BBC4C0_RTRMADP_3_USA-COURT-CASES1-1024x683.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
