(Don\u2019t worry, the cooked meat doesn\u2019t taste like mayo.) In this recipe, that means chicken cutlets that cook through and brown in about four minutes, with deep chimichurri flavor enhanced by a post-grill drizzle of fresh sauce. This recipe will work with nearly any marinade, exactly as written: You could use pesto, salsa verde, bottled barbecue sauce, jarred Thai curry paste, teriyaki sauce or mole, all with equal success.\n\nFeatured in: The Secret Ingredient That Improves Meat Every Time.", "description": "If the idea of rubbing chicken cutlets with mayo before grilling them leaves you cold, I relate \u2014 I felt the same way until I tried it Now I use mayonnaise as the base for nearly every marinade I use, whether I\u2019m cooking on the grill or in a cast-iron skillet indoors The magic of mayo is that it helps your other marinade ingredients spread evenly across the surface of the meat, delivering more consistent flavor, while improving browning", "authors": ["J.
