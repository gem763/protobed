NBA products were taken off shelves and games were boycotted by Chinese state TV.\n\nThe NBA released two statements on the tweet - the first one distancing itself from Mr Morey - turning a Chinese backlash into an American backlash as well.\n\nWhat did Mr Pence say?\n\nIn his remarks, Mr Pence accused the Chinese government of trying to \"influence the public debate here in America\" by \"trying to export censorship\".\n\nHe also accused Beijing of \"exploiting corporate greed\" of American companies hoping to do business in China.\n\n\"Nike promotes itself as a so called 'social-justice champion,' but when it comes to Hong Kong, it prefers checking its social conscience at the door,\" he said.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\n\"Nike stores in China actually removed their Houston Rockets merchandise from their shelves to join the Chinese government in protest against the Rockets general manager's seven-word tweet: 'Fight for Freedom, stand with Hong Kong.'\"\n\nSome of the NBA's biggest players and owners who routinely exercise their freedom to criticise this country are silent on other people's rights, he said.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and his administration have previously criticised Nike over its decision to support Colin Kaepernick, an American football player who controversially knelt as the US national anthem was played ahead of NFL games.\n\n\"In siding with the Chinese Communist Party and silencing free speech, the NBA is acting like a wholly owned subsidiary of the authoritarian regime,\" said Mr Pence.\n\nMr Pence also called on the country to show more respect for the rights of its minority citizens.\n\nThe speech comes after Congress voted on laws to support Hong Kong protesters. Beijing has indicated \"strong countermeasures\" if the White House allows the bill to become law.\n\nThe remarks come amid efforts by the US and China to end their trade war.\n\nIn his speech, Mr Pence said the US was \"not seeking to contain China's development\".\n\n\"We want a constructive relationship with China's leaders,\" he added.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Yao Ming played for the Houston Rockets between 2002 and 2011 boosting the team's popularity in China\n\nHow popular is basketball in China?\n\nBasketball is the most popular sport in China with 300 million people playing the game, according to the NBA.\n\nThe NBA has had a presence in China since 1992 when it opened its first office in Hong Kong.\n\nThe Houston Rockets are widely followed in China after it signed Chinese player and eight-time NBA All-Star Yao Ming in 2002.\n\nNBA China, which conducts the league's business in the country, was launched in 2008 and is now worth more than $4bn (\u00a33.1bn), according to Forbes.", "description": "In a much-watched foreign policy speech, Mr Pence took aim at China for \"exploiting corporate greed'.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07rz3jw.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
