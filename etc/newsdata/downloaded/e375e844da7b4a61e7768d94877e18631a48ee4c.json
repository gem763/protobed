While the Attorney General has yet to contact Ukraine in connection with this investigation, certain Ukrainians who are not members of the government have volunteered information to Mr. Durham, which he is evaluating,\" DOJ Spokesperson Kerri Kopek released in a statement.\n\nAccording to the transcript, President Trump was concerned about Ukraine's role and asked Zelensky to get to the bottom of what happened.\n\n\"I would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike...I guess you have one of your wealthy people...The server, they say Ukraine has it. There are a lot of things that went on, the whole situation,\" Trump said on the call. \"I would like to have the Attorney General call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it. As you saw yesterday, that whole nonsense ended with a very poor performance by a man named Robert Mueller, an incompetent performance, but they say a lot of it started with Ukraine. Whatever you can do, it's very important that you do it if that's possible.\"\n\nWhat is Crowdstrike?\n\nMost important point: It was *Crowdstrike* that concluded that the DNC was hacked. The Obama intelligence community then made its assessment (that foreign hackers had infiltrated the DNC) based on the data they were provided by Crowdstrike. The FBI never reviewed untampered data. \u2014 Jordan Schachtel (@JordanSchachtel) September 25, 2019\n\nCouple observations:\n\n1. The crowd strike reference is clearly newsworthy and utterly lost on everyone. I\u2019m guessing this is in reference to the ongoing investigation into the Russian election interference. Crowdstrike was the firm who the DNC hired after it was hacked. \u2014 Josh Holmes (@HolmesJosh) September 25, 2019\n\nCrowdStrike\u2014who made a stunning surprise guest star appearance in the transcript released today\u2014provides a statement: pic.twitter.com/DisZTAKsH2 \u2014 Dustin Volz (@dnvolz) September 25, 2019\n\nIn 2016, a DNC operative met with Ukrainian officials in Washington D.C. They were looking for dirt on then-candidate Trump.
