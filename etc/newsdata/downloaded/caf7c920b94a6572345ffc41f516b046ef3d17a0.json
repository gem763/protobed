Rather, Trump said, the Kurds battled alongside the U.S. for \u201ctheir land,\u201d and \u201cthat\u2019s a different thing.\u201d\n\nBut this is only the latest example of Trump throwing an ally under the bus. In many public appearances, he has dismissed the idea of honoring long-term friendships, at times mocking officials who complain about that treatment.\n\nLike at a Pennsylvania rally in 2018, where he mimicked a military general saying: \u201c'SIR, they are an ALLY. We must protect them.' And I say, General, I like 'em too. But they gotta pay. \"\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re a long way away!\u201d\n\nCover image: U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during an executive order signing event in the Roosevelt Room of the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Wednesday, October 9, 2019.
