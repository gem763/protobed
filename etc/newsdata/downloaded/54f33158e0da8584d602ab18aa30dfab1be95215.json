If there were players who didn\u2019t we wouldn\u2019t have come back out and played.\n\n\u201cThat shows the maturity and the character that everyone wanted to come back out and play.\u201d\n\nPA", "description": "England\u00a0captain Harry Kane has called for \u201cstronger punishments\u201d for racism after the Three Lions were caught up in an abuse storm on Monday night.
