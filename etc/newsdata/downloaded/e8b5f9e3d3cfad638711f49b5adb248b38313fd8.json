It is Martin Atkinson\u2019s decision,\u2019 Gallagher told Sky Sports.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018The referee is the closest person to it and he says no.\n\n\u2018There was a debate this morning, 50,000 people voted [on a Sky Twitter poll] and half say yes, half say no.\n\n\u2018So for the VAR, it\u2019s not clear and obvious and it cannot go against the referee.\u2019\n\nGallagher did concede that he felt that Lindelof\u2019s challenge was worthy of a free-kick, but that the correct protocol was followed afterwards.\n\n\u2018I did think it was a foul. He has the best view and he waved it away, he said no,\u2019 Gallagher added.\n\n\u2018Once he does that, it is out of the VAR\u2019s hands because it\u2019s such a subjective decision. So they can\u2019t go with it.\n\n\u2018[The VAR] did check it but the feeling was that the referee had the best view and he didn\u2019t feel it was a foul.\n\nLiverpool players protested to Atkinson after the goal but to no avail (Picture: Getty)\n\n\u2018He thought it was contact but not enough to give a foul.\n\n\u2018The referee was close and said no foul straight away.\n\nThis is a referee\u2019s decision on the field.\u2019", "description": "The refereeing team at Manchester United vs Liverpool were right to allow Marcus Rashford's opener to stand, according to Dermot Gallagher.", "authors": ["James Gray"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1177196314_1571656553.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
