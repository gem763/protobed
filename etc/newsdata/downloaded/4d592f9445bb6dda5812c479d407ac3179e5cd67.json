He was later reprimanded by the school\u2019s principal, who told him \u201cYou know what you do to diffuse a situation like that? You say, \u2018I\u2019m sorry, I meant to say him\u2019\u201d.\n\nHowever the incident appeared to have been the final straw after several concerns were raised with school officials relating to his treatment of the student in December.

The ADF refute the claim.\n\nThe complaint adds: \u201cDefendants gave Mr Vlaming an ultimatum: use male pronouns for this female student or lose your job.\n\n\u201cMr Vlaming could not violate his conscience, and it cost him his job\u201d.\n\nA spokesperson for West Point Schools told The Washington Post it would \u201cvigorously defend\u201d against the claim.", "description": "A Virginia high school teacher has filed a lawsuit after being fired for refusing to use a transgender student\u2019s pronouns, arguing he is being discriminated against for his faith.
