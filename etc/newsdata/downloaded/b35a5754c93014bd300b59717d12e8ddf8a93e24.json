Her aim, she told Sullivan, was to get the entire case dismissed because of \u201cegregious government misconduct.\u201d\n\nFor now, she added Flynn doesn\u2019t plan to withdraw from the plea deal, which he signed first in December 2017 and again in February 2018.\n\n\u201cThere is far more at stake here than sentencing,\u201d said Powell, who ticked through a series of complaints she\u2019s raising about the Mueller team for allegedly acting maliciously against Flynn and withholding evidence that would have cleared him of any charges.\n\nGovernment prosecutors a year ago said they would ask Sullivan to spare Flynn any jail time because of his \u201cextensive cooperation\u201d in the Mueller investigation.\n\nBut on Tuesday, DOJ attorney Brandon Van Grack said the government planned to refile a new sentencing memo for the retired Army general. He didn\u2019t indicate whether DOJ\u2019s position would change on whether Flynn should get a more severe punishment than the one year of probation it initially suggested.\n\nThe court later ordered DOJ to file its recommendations on Flynn\u2019s sentence by Dec. 2.\n\nWhile Flynn still remains locked into his guilty plea, he has made an abrupt shift in his defense strategy since firing his first team of lawyers in June and replacing them with Powell.\n\nLast month, she filed a 19-page motion seeking a court order for the government to turn over sensitive classified materials that would allegedly show her client was targeted for political reasons and that prosecutorial rules were broken in pursuing him.\n\nFlynn\u2019s list of complaints cover many of the same topics that his allies and family members have been pressing for years and center on the claim of an anti-Trump conspiracy inside the FBI.\n\n\u201cOur ethical obligation requires us to go back and look at everything,\u201d Powell said in court. She cited her interest in obtaining an internal DOJ memo that found Flynn wasn\u2019t a Russian agent and other materials widely discussed in conservative media circles that would undercut the entire premise of the Mueller investigation.\n\nSullivan, a judicial appointee of both GOP and Democratic presidents, appeared to cast doubt on Powell\u2019s arguments, noting at one point Flynn was never charged with being a Russian agent.\n\nBut Sullivan nonetheless scheduled an Oct. 31 hearing on Flynn\u2019s request to get the materials. For its part, DOJ maintains that Flynn shouldn\u2019t be given access to any classified materials and also argues that it\u2019s not aware of any relevant documents that must be disclosed under the court\u2019s rules.\n\n", "description": "Justice Department lawyers have repeatedly said they\u2019re ready to see the former national security adviser sentenced.", "authors": ["Darren Samuelsohn"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/6f/c1/53cf10664e5c8a431e156d157ae1/190910-michael-flynn-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
