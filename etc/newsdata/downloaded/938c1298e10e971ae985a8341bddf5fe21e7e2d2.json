Tom then asked, to which she replied: 'My dad was born in Syria, I should know that!'\n\nPutting on his usual sarcastic tone, Sam joked: 'Wow, he'd be very proud right now!'\n\nAwkward! Sam Pang (bottom row, right) found himself in trouble on Monday night's episode of Have You Been Paying Attention? when he joked about Ash London's dead father. Ash is pictured bottom row, centre\n\nBut what was meant to be a lighthearted joke turned rather morbid when Ash said: 'My dad died when I was 16. Thanks, Sam.'\n\nAfter a painfully awkward silence, Sam responded: 'This show's taken a bit of a turn!'\n\nFortunately, it seems that Ash didn't take Sam's throwaway comment to heart, as they continued to joke and rib each other for the rest of the show.\n\n'My dad died when I was 16. Thanks, Sam': A lighthearted joke about the Ash's father's heritage took a rather morbid turn when she revealed he had died when she was a teenager\n\nAsh, who hosts the popular Hit Network radio show Ash London Live, has previously spoken about how her father's death inspired her love of music.\n\n'When I was 16, my father passed away... and I still had my music,' she told Stellar magazine in September last year.\n\n'I was listening to Silverchair's Diorama the week he died and whenever I hear that album, I'm right back there. Music has been a constant in my life.'", "description": "Sam Pang found himself in trouble on Monday night's episode of Have You Been Paying Attention? when he\u00a0accidentally joked about Ash London's dead father.", "authors": ["Monique Friedlander For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/06/20021018-0-image-a-13_1571721823571.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
