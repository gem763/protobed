He thought it was such a good idea that he flew to the San Francisco Bay Area to pitch it to Luca Maestri, Apple's chief financial officer, at the iPhone maker's headquarters, Sherman reported. It's unclear what the deal would have entailed or how it would have worked, but as part of it, Apple would have made an investment in WeWork, according to the report.\n\nMaestri and Apple turned him down, Sherman reported.\n\nRepresentatives for WeWork and Apple did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment.\n\nThe meeting happened about the same time that Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi, the two biggest backers of SoftBank's Vision Fund, which, in turn, is the biggest bank-roller of WeWork, were souring on the real estate giant. At the time, SoftBank was considering investing an additional $16 billion in the company, but ended up putting just $1 billion directly into the company.\n\nRead more: WeWork and Uber are giving SoftBank a black eye, but that doesn't mean Vision Fund II is in trouble, experts say\n\nNeumann's partnership proposal with Apple was a kind of last-ditch effort to secure new funding for his company while keeping it private, an unnamed source familiar with the meeting told Sherman.\n\n\"This was the Hail Mary,\" the source said. \"There was Adam's idea that there was some way out.\"\n\nThe potential deal actually was a small one, a source close to Neumann told Sherman.\n\nThe failure of the Apple meeting and the much-reduced investment from SoftBank spurred Neumann to push for an initial public offering to raise more funds, according to Sherman's report. WeWork postponed its IPO last week amid resistance from potential investors.\n\nGot a tip about WeWork or another company?
