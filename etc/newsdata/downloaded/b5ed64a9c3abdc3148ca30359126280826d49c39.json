The share price hasn't reflected the effort and the work she's put in,'' he said.\n\nMs McBain said in a statement to the ASX she was now searching for opportunities to run a larger business.\n\n\"I believe now is a good time for me to consider career opportunities with larger enterprises,'' Ms McBain said.\n\nMaggie Beer and her husband sold the Maggie Beer Products business to Longtable Group in two tranches. AAP\n\nMs McBain, who earlier in her career was the chief executive of high-flying infant formula group Bellamy's Australia which then suffered a big fall from grace, said she had successfully turned around the performance of the Maggie Beer products business, while the other two brands were in the early stages of a turnaround.\n\n\"This has not been an easy decision given how much I love the portfolio of Australian premium food and dairy brands we have developed, and importantly the values those brands stand for,'' she said.\n\nLongtable has appointed Chantale Millard as acting chief executive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLongtable is also in the process of finding a new chairman, with Mr Robinson having previously signalled he would be stepping down.\n\nLongtable said in an announcement to the ASX late on Wednesday that the Maggie Beer business through to September, 2019 had produced trading earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of above 10 per cent. The company said demand for a Maggie Beer cheese range was ''strong'' and a range of plant-based take-home meals with independent stores had also been popular with customers.\n\nThe value of Paris Creek was slashed in 2018-19, with a $15.2 million impairment. It was a big factor in dragging the Longtable parent to a bottomline loss of $24.2 million in 2018-19.\n\nCelebrity chef Maggie Beer and her husband Colin sold the remaining 52 per cent of their Maggie Beer Products gourmet food business to Longtable in a cash and shares deal worth $10 million in April, 2019.\n\nThe sale came 40 years after the business was established in South Australia's Barossa Valley at a small shop adjacent to her Pheasant Farm restaurant run by the well-known chef, who has become a regular guest judge on the Channel Ten cooking show MasterChef and is a noted cookbook author.\n\nThe initial 48 per cent of Maggie Beer Products, which makes products such as ice-cream, quince paste, pate and sauces, was acquired by Longtable, previously known as Primary Opinion, in 2016 for $15 million.", "description": "Laura McBain exits after two years as chief of ASX-listed Longtable Group, which owns the Maggie Beer Products gourmet food operations.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_789%2C$y_179/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/36a4b00c0bf30fa78b243d37f5e7d373d4de37b2", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
