Click here to learn more about the global movement fighting for our future.\n\nPeople across Australia rallied on Friday to take part in global climate strikes happening all over the world, protesting environmental inaction and general shit-housery from our elected officials.\n\nJust around 12:00PM, Sydney was one of the first Aussie locations to kick off the rallies \u2013 and boy did they deliver.\n\nAs someone who was on the ground at The Domain, just off of Circular Quay and the city\u2019s NSW Art Gallery, you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking there was some sort of music festival going on. There were people walking through the middle of streets, spilling out onto the sidewalk, and a trail of police trying their best to keep everyone orderly (people were very respectful and polite to each other, which was also nice!)\n\nEarly reports say police have confirmed that at least 50,000 people packed out The Domain. Capacity is 80,000, and having been on the ground there I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the final figure is much closer to that.\n\nPolice have confirmed at least 50,000 people at the Sydney #climatestrike. May be more, considering capacity at The Domain is 80,000 and it was chockers. \u2014 Jenny Noyes (@jennynoise) September 20, 2019\n\nJust take a look at some of the insane photos from the Sydney site:\n\nThe amount of people at the Sydney Climate Strike. pic.twitter.com/eLVjDKoiRx \u2014 Sebastian (@With_Sebastian) September 20, 2019\n\nSo proud Sydney.
