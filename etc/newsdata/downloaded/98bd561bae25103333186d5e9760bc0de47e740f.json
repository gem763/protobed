If that's true, how do you explain our results in the big games when I wasn't involved? There's no real difference,' he told The Athletic.\n\n'I know people expect me to offer more, dictate play and make the difference \u2014 I do, too \u2014 but it's not that straightforward.\n\n'I'm not the only player in the team and, don't forget, some of our opponents are simply better than us.'\n\nMidfielder Ozil has his critics but he believes some of the denunciation is not fair\n\nOzil has fallen out of favour under Emery. Last season he was left out of several away matches and this term he has not been included in the Gunners' last three league games.\n\nThe 31-year-old has, in fact, been left out of the squad entirely for the past three matches in all competitions - the trip to Manchester United and the home clashes against Standard Liege and Bournemouth.\n\n'When I decided he shouldn't be in the squad it's because I think other players deserved it more,' Emery said after the Europa League victory over Standard Liege earlier this month.\n\nOzil was forced to miss the beginning of the season after himself and team-mate Sead Kolasinac were ambushed by attackers on mopeds in north west London and then due to 'further security incidents'.\n\nThe 31-year-old has made just two appearances this season, including just one league start\n\nHowever the midfielder has cost Arsenal \u00a319,718 a minute and he has played just 142 minutes on the pitch.\n\nOzil's current deal does not expire for another two years and despite his lack of game time he has insisted that he will see out his contract.\n\n'I have a contract until the summer of 2021 and I will be staying until then,' he said.\n\n'You can go through difficult times, like this, but that is no reason to run away and I'm not going to. I'm here until at least 2021.'\n\nEarlier this month former Arsenal midfielder Ray Parlour told talkSPORT: 'Ozil's not even in the squad now. I think that's probably the end of his career at Arsenal.\n\n'You have got youngsters that deserve an opportunity probably more than him at the moment.'", "description": "The midfielder, who is on a contract worth \u00a3350,000 a week at the Emirates, has been frozen out by manager Unai Emery and has made just two appearances this season.", "authors": ["Kate Mcgreavy For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/07/19824118-0-image-a-14_1571295549573.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
