London in early April? Cape Cod in October? Yes and yes.\n\nHow does this relate to cooking, you ask? (You mean you don\u2019t just want my random anecdotes?) It can be just as helpful to think about the shoulder seasons of food, too. You know, light soups in late summer or very early fall, roasted asparagus at the cusp of spring.\n\nMy new favorite example is horchata. The rice-and-milk beverage from Mexico will quench anyone\u2019s thirst on a hot day, but right now for me, it\u2019s ideal for that blurred area between summer and fall. Kind of like a short-sleeve sweater, as one of my tasters said. Cold and sweet is perfect for those toasty September afternoons we\u2019re still having, while the more substantial texture created when rice is ground into milk with cinnamon and vanilla hints at the headily spiced fall and winter days to come.\n\n[These fish tacos channel the best beach vacation vibes]\n\nPati Jinich, one of my go-to recipe sources, calls the drink \u201csuper refreshing and sweet.\u201d The chef, cookbook author and TV personality (the new season of her public television series, \u201cPati\u2019s Mexican Table,\u201d debuts nationwide the week of Oct. 4) says it\u2019s definitely something you can play around with. In Mexico, variations include the addition of almonds and sweetened condensed or evaporated milk. To make it vegan, use your choice of nondairy milk, or try coconut water. If you stick with dairy, whole or low-fat milk is best for creaminess. I halved the amount of water in Jinich\u2019s original recipe, but you can add more (up to 3 cups total), depending on how thin you want the drink. Keep in mind you\u2019ll probably be serving it over ice. The amounts of sugar and vanilla are up for interpretation, as well.\n\nThe recipe is a cinch to make, as long as you plan ahead. The dried rice needs to soak for at least 2 hours and up to overnight. The ultimate goal is to grind the rice as finely as possible, ideally to the texture of rice flour, Jinich says. A high-powered blender such as a Vitamix can easily dispatch the whole batch at once and give you just the right texture. With a more traditional blender, you will need to blend in batches and return the strained granules of rice to the blender a few times to ensure it is fine enough. The batches I made this way were still very good.\n\nIf you\u2019ve never had horchata, know that the graininess you get, regardless of your blender, is supposed to be there. \u201cSome people may not be used to it,\u201d Jinich says. \u201cIt is supposed to be sandy, and hopefully they find the charm in that.\u201d\n\nConsider us charmed.\n\nRecipe notes: If you can\u2019t find Ceylon (\u201ctrue\u201d) cinnamon sticks, which are thinner and less assertive than cassia cinnamon, Jinich suggests substituting a teaspoon or two of ground cinnamon to taste.\n\nThe horchata can be refrigerated for up to 1 week. Stir well before serving. Storing it in glass jars makes it easy to redistribute the ground rice with a few shakes.\n\nIngredients\n\n2 cups long-grain or extra-long-grain white rice\n\n1 cinnamon stick, preferably Ceylon (\u201ctrue cinnamon\u201d; see headnote)\n\n1 1/2 cups hot water\n\n4 cups whole or low-fat milk\n\n3/4 cup sugar\n\n1 tablespoon vanilla extract\n\nIce, for serving\n\nGround cinnamon, for serving (optional)\n\nSteps\n\nStep 1\n\nPlace the rice in a medium bowl and cover with the hot water. Crumble the cinnamon stick over the top. Let it rest, covered, at room temperature for at least 2 hours and up to overnight.\n\nDid you make this recipe?

Using a fine-mesh strainer, strain into a pitcher or container. If there is a lot of ground rice in the strainer, return it to the blender with some of the liquid and blend again until smooth. (You should still feel the graininess of the rice, but it should be about as fine as rice flour.) Strain again, making sure almost all the ground rice has gone through the strainer and into the pitcher. Repeat with the remaining rice mixture, milk, sugar and vanilla.\n\nStep 3\n\nStir well and serve over ice, or refrigerate until thoroughly chilled. Sprinkle some ground cinnamon on top, if desired.\n\nNutrition\n\nCalories: 310; Total Fat: 3 g; Saturated Fat: 2 g; Cholesterol: 15 mg; Sodium: 75 mg; Carbohydrates: 62 g; Dietary Fiber: 0 g; Sugars: 25 g; Protein: 8 g.", "description": "This rice-and-milk beverage is easy to pull together as long as you plan ahead.", "authors": ["Becky Krystal", "Reporter Covering Topics Related To Food", "September At Am", "Becky Krystal Is A Food Reporter", "The Lead Writer For Voraciously.
