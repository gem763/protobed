Twenty years ago, Reeder could have been immunized. From 1999 to 2002, SmithKline Beecham\u2014now GlaxoSmithKline\u2014sold a Lyme vaccine called LYMErix. But the company pulled LYMErix off the market after a public backlash and a spate of lawsuits.\n\nAs STAT reported on August 22, any new Lyme vaccine will face intense public scrutiny. But even getting the new vaccine to market could prove challenging. Valneva is currently seeking a partner to help develop and commercialize the vaccine, and at least one major manufacturer is out of the running. GlaxoSmithKline had been supporting the new vaccine\u2019s research and development, but in June the two companies terminated their partnership.\n\nIf the new vaccine does make it to market, will it fare any better than LYMErix? According to Gregory Poland, director of the Vaccine Research Group at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, who has given scientific advice to Valneva, that\u2019s \u201ca multi-million dollar question.\u201d\n\nOne factor that led to LYMErix\u2019s demise was how the vaccine worked. Lyme disease, named for the Connecticut town in which it was first discovered, is caused by a corkscrew-shaped bacterium called Borrelia burgdorferi that travels in the bellies of ticks. LYMErix prompted the immune system to generate antibodies against a protein on the surface of the bacteria called outer surface protein A (OspA). When a tick fed on someone who had been immunized, it ingested blood containing the Lyme-killing antibodies. Those antibodies traveled to the tick\u2019s gut and wiped out the bacteria before it could enter the human body.\n\nLYMERix worked, although imperfectly. A 1998 study in the New England Journal of Medicine looked at nearly 11,000 people who lived in Lyme-endemic areas and found that those who received three doses of LYMERix had a 76 percent reduction in Lyme disease the following year compared with those who didn\u2019t receive the vaccine. But just a week after the study was published, another paper came out showing that one particular portion of the OspA gene bears a striking resemblance to a portion of a human gene that plays a role in the body\u2019s immune response. While the second paper didn\u2019t address vaccination, the researchers posited that, because of the similarity, some people infected with Lyme disease might develop an immune response against the human protein, leading to lingering inflammation and treatment-resistant Lyme arthritis. It wasn\u2019t a stretch to imagine that vaccination, which also prompts an immune response against OspA, might produce the same effect.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration never found any compelling scientific evidence to support this theory, but that didn\u2019t stop people who believed they were harmed by the vaccine from speaking out and filing a class-action lawsuit. Sales of LYMErix tanked, and in 2002 SmithKline Beecham withdrew the vaccine. The following year, the company paid more than a million dollars in legal fees to settle the class action lawsuit.", "description": "False starts and fear have kept such a drug off the market for two decades.", "authors": ["Cassandra Willyard"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/AP_17184808355297/facebook.jpg?1570289836", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
