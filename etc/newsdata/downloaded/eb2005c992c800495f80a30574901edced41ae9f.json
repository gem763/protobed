(AP) - Matt Coghlin made a tie-breaking 21-yard field goal with 5 seconds remaining, and No. 25 Michigan State beat Indiana 40-31 on Saturday.\n\nAfter Coghlin\u2019s kick gave the Spartans (4-1, 2-0 Big Ten) a 34-31 lead, Indiana tried to lateral its way down the field on its final offensive play, but that resulted in a fumble that Michigan State recovered for a touchdown.\n\nBrian Lewerke threw for 300 yards and three touchdowns for the Spartans, who held off the upset-minded Hoosiers (3-2, 0-2) on a rare day when Michigan State\u2019s defense struggled. Michael Penix Jr. returned for Indiana after missing the previous two games with an undisclosed injury - and he gave the Spartans fits, completing 20 passes in a row during one stretch.\n\nPenix threw for three touchdowns, including an 11-yarder to Whop Philyor that tied the game at 31 with 2:00 remaining. Lewerke immediately led the Spartans back down the field. Darrell Stewart outfought defensive back Jaylin Williams for a 44-yard reception, then Lewerke broke free for a 30-yard run that put the ball at the 1.\n\nRather than try to score right away, the Spartans ran the clock down and set up Coghlin\u2019s kick.\n\nElijah Collins gave Michigan State a 7-0 lead with a 4-yard scoring run, but Indiana answered late in the first quarter with a 28-yard TD pass from Penix to Philyor.\n\nLewerke put the Spartans back ahead with a 5-yard touchdown pass to Stewart in the second, but Penix scored on a 2-yard run to tie it at 14.\n\nLewerke found Stewart for a 26-yard TD with 33 seconds left in the half.\n\nPenix completed his last seven pass attempts of the first half and his first 13 of the second, but Michigan State held the Hoosiers to a field goal in the red zone to start the third quarter.\n\nIndiana went ahead 24-21 with 14:52 remaining in the fourth on a 12-yard touchdown pass from Penix to Donavan Hale, who appeared to make the catch with one hand while cornerback Josiah Scott was draped all over him.\n\nMichigan State went back ahead 28-24 with 12:12 remaining when Lewerke threw a 10-yard scoring pass to Matt Seybert.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nIndiana: The Hoosiers had an impressive game plan, throwing quick, short passes and largely negating Michigan State\u2019s pass rush. It wasn\u2019t enough for a win, but Penix is a redshirt freshman and seems to have a bright future.\n\nMichigan State: The Spartans\u2019 offense has been deservedly criticized this year, but this is now back-to-back games with more than 30 points. Lewerke and Co. responded under pressure late in this one.\n\nPOLL IMPLICATIONS\n\nThe Spartans were barely in the Top 25, and this wasn\u2019t an especially convincing win - but unlike in their previous home game against Arizona State, they were able to prevail in the end.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nIndiana: The Hoosiers are off next weekend before hosting Rutgers on Oct. 12.\n\nMichigan State: The Spartans play at Ohio State next Saturday night.\n\n___\n\nFollow Noah Trister at https://twitter.com/noahtrister\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Matt Coghlin made a tie-breaking 21-yard field goal with 5 seconds remaining, and No. 25 Michigan State beat Indiana 40-31 on Saturday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Noah Trister"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/28/indiana_michigan_st_football_74737_c0-173-4141-2587_s1770x1032.jpg?101f51341c38e11cb498ec4535ac756e8e6a99b9", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
