Putting too much stock in a small sample size might cause you to make a decision that hurts you in the long run.

Realmuto\u2019s week featured 10 hits in 22 at-bats, a stolen base and a stretch of home runs in three straight games. The power surge lifted his home run total for the season to a career-high 23 bombs. It would be understandable if Realmuto faded a bit down the stretch considering how often he plays (his 119 starts at catcher easily leads baseball), but instead he\u2019s thrived, posting a .943 OPS since the All-Star break and belting nine homers since the beginning of August \u2026 It remains rather insane that the Brewers were able to land Yasmani Grandal on a one-year contract last offseason. Like Realmuto, Grandal also went deep in three consecutive contests last week, and he added an additional long ball to boot. He\u2019s also been playing a lot of first base since the club traded Jesus Aguilar, which not only gives him a few more plate appearances but also could help to save his legs down the stretch \u2026 It\u2019s hard to believe at this point that Mitch Garver wasn\u2019t even the first catcher on the Twins drafted in leagues this spring. The 28-year-old continued with his breakout campaign with three dingers over the weekend, as he\u2019s now just one long ball shy of the 30-homer plateau even though he\u2019s had just 317 plate appearances. While Garver\u2019s 30.5 percent HR/FB rate has been pretty lucky, he\u2019s created some of his own luck with a 47.7 percent fly ball rate, 53.3 percent pull rate and 48.2 percent hard-hit rate \u2026\n\nFirst Base\n\nJose Abreu has returned to the 30-homer level thanks to bombs in three of his last four games. He\u2019s also now up to an American League-leading 112 RBI after plating 38 runs and posting a 1.031 OPS over 37 games since the start of August. The impending free agent\u2019s 92.0 mph exit velocity this season ranks in the top five percent in baseball \u2026 It looked like Garrett Cooper\u2019s mixed league relevancy might be coming to an end during an ugly August when he batted just .216/.286/.295 with one home run. However, he\u2019s started to heat back up in September, going 10-for-27 (.370) with a couple dingers and six RBI over six tilts. Cooper\u2019s ceiling is still pretty limited given his lineup, ballpark and the fact that he hits so many balls on the ground. Among the 177 players with at least 400 plate appearances, he has the seventh-highest ground ball rate at 53.1 percent \u2026 In addition to giving hope to all of us with dad bods, Pete Alonso cranked a couple more home runs last week to extend his National League rookie record to 45. Alonso had a rough July in hitting only .177/.333/.430, but since the calendar flipped to August he\u2019s posted a .299/.381/.591 line with 11 taters and 30 RBI \u2026\n\nSecond Base\n\nOzzie Albies\u2019 consistency this season has been a pleasant surprise. The second baseman had a monster April (.988 OPS) in 2018 in his first full major league season but then didn\u2019t reach a .800 OPS in any subsequent month. In 2019, he\u2019s only had one month when his OPS fell below .844. Albies has his walk rate back up to a respectable 8.0 percent this season after it sat at just 5.3 percent last year. The second baseman has been locked in as the Braves\u2019 No. 2 hitter since late July. Being sandwiched in between Ronald Acuna and Freddie Freeman isn\u2019t a bad spot to be \u2026 Rougned Odor appeared to be in danger of losing his starting job following another lengthy slump that saw him put up just a .450 OPS across a 29-game stretch. However, with nine hits and three home runs over his last five contests, he appears to have staved off a benching for now. Granted, four of those five games were against the Orioles, so let\u2019s not proclaim that Odor is fixed just yet \u2026 Mauricio Dubon is getting a shot at everyday playing time with the Giants after they picked him up from the Brewers in a deadline trade. He\u2019s made the most of it thus far in batting .310/.333/.586 with a couple dingers and a stolen base in his first nine games with his new team. Dubon had a power breakout this season at Triple-A (who didn\u2019t?) but unfortunate didn\u2019t run nearly as much as he had in the past. His ceiling is fairly limited as the No. 8 hitter in a bad lineup and in a bad park for hitters \u2026\n\nThird Base\n\nWith three more bombs last week, Josh Donaldson has already matched his first-half home run total with 18 dingers since the All-Star break (and he\u2019s done so in 133 fewer plate appearances). In 59 games since the beginning of July, Donaldson has put up a robust 1.052 OPS with 21 home runs and 46 RBI. His 92.9 mph exit velocity ranks in the top two percent of the league. Oh, and by the way, Donaldson has already played 140 games this season after totaling just 165 games played over the previous two injury-riddled campaigns \u2026 Alex Bregman has been on some kind of run since the start of August, posting an utterly ridiculous .413/.493/.762 batting line with eight long balls, 37 RBI and 33 runs scored across 33 games. The hot streak has push his average on the season all the way up to .298 after he entered August batting just .259. Bregman is one of just two qualifiers (Carlos Santana being the other) who has walked more than he\u2019s struck out this season \u2026 The Nationals took a flier on Asdrubal Cabrera last month after he was released by the Rangers and he\u2019s rewarded them with a .355/.432/.618 batting line, four homers and 27 RBI over 22 contests. With Brian Dozier slumping again, Cabrera looks to have taken over second base duties against right-handers, and he\u2019s batted fifth each of the last two games \u2026\n\nShortstop\n\nIf you drafted Tim Anderson this spring, you probably weren\u2019t doing it with the anticipation that he would be a major boost to your team\u2019s batting average. Yet here we are on September 9 and Anderson is leading the American League with his .334 mark. The .396 BABIP no doubt helps, but Anderson has also significantly cut down on his strikeouts this season (20.9 percent) and he\u2019s done a much better job of using the entire field. Anderson\u2019s xBA of .293 ranks in the top eight percent in the game \u2026 Marcus Semien greatly improved his strikeout rate in 2018 in cutting it down to 18.6 percent. He\u2019s taken it to another level this year, though, whiffing at just a 13.8 percent mark while also upping his walk rate to 11.3 percent. About the only thing to complain about with Semien has been his inefficiency on the bases in getting caught (eight) almost as many times as he\u2019s been successful (nine). He should still reach double digits in steals again, though, and is on his way to career highs in the other four categories \u2026 Corey Seager\u2019s disappointing season at the plate would probably be getting more attention if the Dodgers weren\u2019t demolishing everyone, but there\u2019s no doubt that he\u2019s underwhelmed. And while a couple home runs last week was enough to get him on this list, he is just 4-for-26 at the dish overall this month \u2026\n\nOutfield\n\nAustin Meadows\u2019 production has fluctuated since a fantastic first two months, but he appears determined to close out September on a strong note, having gone a ridiculous 15-for-28 (.536) with four long balls, nine RBI, 10 runs scored and a stolen base over his first eight games this month. The 24-year-old has been a top-15 fantasy outfielder this season in his first full year with the Rays \u2026 Ketel Marte has matched Meadows with four home runs already this month and he\u2019s also driven in a whopping 14 runs over seven tilts. While the juiced ball has no doubt helped aid Marte\u2019s breakout season, he\u2019s significantly upped his launch angle to 11.4 degrees while at the same time maintaining an elite strikeout rate of 13.4 percent \u2026 After stealing four bases in the weekend series against the Cubs, Christian Yelich became just the 10th player ever to record 30 stolen bases and hit 40 home runs in a season. He\u2019s been caught just two times on the bases in his 32 tries. Like Marte, Yelich has notably increased his launch angle in 2019 to 11 degrees, and only Aaron Judge, Miguel Sano and Nelson Cruz have posted a higher exit velocity than Yelich\u2019s 93.1 mph \u2026 With four dingers across his last five games, Mookie Betts has already eclipsed his home run total from the first half with 14 bombs since the All-Star break. He hasn\u2019t run nearly as much this season, but Betts has a shot to reach 30 homers for the second year in a row while also leading all of baseball in runs scored \u2026", "description": "Ryan Boyer highlights and analyzes the hottest hitters using Rotoworld's Season Pass Player Rater.
