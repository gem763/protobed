The form, called a 302, was edited by Lisa Page, Powell claimed, linking both FBI lovers to the 'ambush.'\n\nMichael Flynn's next hearing, which was set for next week, was delayed Tuesday on the heels of his attorney filing new documents in an attempt to prove his innocence\n\nMichael Flynn's lawyer Sidney Powell (left) filed documents Thursday claiming Flynn (right) was innocent and that interview notes from the FBI were manipulated\n\nMichael Flynn's lawyer quoted FBI lovers Peter Strzok (left) and Lisa Page (right) in the fresh filings\n\nMichael Flynn pleaded guilty of lying to the FBI in 2017, but his attorney now says the FBI manipulated the interview documents to suggest something Flynn never definitively said\n\nFlynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI in 2017.\n\nHe admitted to saying that he hadn't spoken to former Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, when Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation found that he did.\n\nBut Powell now argues that Flynn said he wasn't sure he had spoken to Kislyak instead of saying a definitive no.\n\n'This is a deceptive manipulation because, as the notes of the agents show, Mr. Flynn was not even sure he had spoken to Russia/Kislyak on the issue. He had talked to dozens of countries,' Powell's fresh court filing said.\n\nPowell's brief also quoted texts between Strzok and his then-lover Lisa Page, an FBI lawyer.\n\nAfter the release of the so-called dirty dossier, Strzok and Page had texted, with Strzok wondering if the dossier's public release could be used as a reason to interview more people for the open Russia case.\n\nStrzok then met with former deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe to talk about interviewing Flynn.\n\nPowell then alleged that 'the upper echelon of the FBI met to orchestrate' the Flynn interview in 'such a way as to keep from alerting him from understanding that he was being interviewed in a criminal investigation of which he was the target.'\n\n'In short, they planned to deceive him about the entire scenario, and keep him \"unguarded,\"' Powell said.\n\nPowell's court documents also go after Strzok and Page for texting about coordinated media leaks and accuse former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper of ordering a media hit on Flynn courtesy of Washington Post reporter David Ignatius.\n\nPowell claimed that Clapper had told Ignatius to 'take the kill shot on Flynn' after the reporter got copies of the transcripts of Flynn's phone calls with Kislyak.\n\nClapper told Fox News that he 'absolutely did not say those words to David Ignatius.'\n\nProsecutors involved in the case called Flynn's claim of innocence 'an extraordinary reversal.'\n\n'He makes this claim despite having admitted his guilt, under oath, before two federal judges,' prosecutors said Tuesday.\n\nSullivan had set a December 18 sentencing date, though that could be delayed as well.", "description": "The federal judge presiding over former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn's case has canceled next week's hearing on the heels of Flynn's attorney claiming he's innocent.", "authors": ["Nikki Schwab", "Senior U.S. Political Reporter For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/20/20346406-0-image-a-108_1572382745330.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
