In the above video, which Close randomly teased on Instagram, the actor hangs out with mentalist Derren Brown, current star of the Broadway show Derren Brown: Secret and slaps him, repeatedly. This somehow helps him count things quickly, which is very impressive, even if it comes at the cost of some physical damage at the literal hand of the Wife (you know, of The Wife). We\u2019re not sure if the logical next step here is for Brown to get other famous actors to slap him (Amy Adams could probably do some real damage), or for Close to start going around slapping other professions (quick, someone bring her a CPA), but we\u2019re very much up for this becoming a continuing video series.\n\nRelated", "description": "Watch Glenn Close slap the Broadway illusionist and mentalist Derren Brown of \u201cDerren Brown: Secret\u201d over and over again in a video.", "authors": ["Jackson Mchenry"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/03/08/08-glenn-close.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
