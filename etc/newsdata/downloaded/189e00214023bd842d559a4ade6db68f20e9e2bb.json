She's not able to reply to people because she's away working and hasn't got access to her phone.\"\n\nMany people took to social media to disagree, with one writing: \"I don't see how anyone can say Georgia isn't racist. What she did was 100% black face, regardless are the reason no one should do it. Also the excuse 'she is in the UK' isn't a valid one, since more people over there are racist.
