He's also a pilot with the U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary and Pilots for Patients.\n\nIncumbent Gov. John Bel Edwards, D-Amite: Edwards, 53, the only Democratic governor in the Deep South, won a long-shot victory four years ago in a runoff with former Republican U.S. Sen. David Vitter, whose prostitution scandal soured voters. Edwards is an attorney who began his career as a U.S. Army Ranger.\n\nEddie Rispone, R-Baton Rouge: Rispone has a rags-to-riches bootstrap story in which he and his brother founded a contractor firm that generates about $400 million in annual revenues. He has financed his own campaign with $11.5 million of his fortune and has cast himself in the image of Republican President Donald Trump.\n\nMORE: 4 takeaways from Louisiana governor's debate\n\nHere's where the top three candidates stand on key issues in the 2019 Louisiana governor's race.\n\nOn the possibility of a constitutional convention\n\nDemocratic Gov. John Bel Edwards before Monday's Press Club of Baton Rouge debate (Photo: Greg Hilburn/USA Today Network)\n\nAbraham: Undecided. While Abraham said he's not opposed to a constitutional convention, he believes it's risky because the existing constitution protects priorities like public school funding and coastal restoration. \"If you open up the entire constitution you put things on the chopping block like education that we believe are important,\" he said.\n\nEdwards: No. The governor noted any amendments to the constitution were passed by two-thirds of the Legislature and voters in an election. \"I don't propose reducing funding to education,\" he said.\n\nRispone: Yes. \"I'm the only candidate who says we need a constitutional convention \u2014 a sea change,\" Rispone said. \"We don't have a constitution; we have a book of statutes.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOn whether or not they will keep Medicaid expansion\n\nRepublican Congressman Ralph Abraham, who's running for governor, flew the 5,000th mission for Pilots for Patients on Friday, Sept. 20, 2019. (Photo: Greg Hilburn/USA Today Network)\n\nAbraham: Yes. But the congressman said his administration would root out \"fraud and abuse,\" citing a legislative audit showing the state may have misspent as much as $85 million on Medicaid recipients who were ineligible.\n\nEdwards: Yes. The governor ushered in Medicaid expansion during the first hours of his taking office, saying it's the easiest decision he's ever made and noting that 450,000 Louisianans who weren't insured now have health insurance.\n\nRispone: Yes. But Rispone said he doesn't believe the cost for the state, a maximum of 10% compared to the federal 90% share, is sustainable. He, too, believes the expansion is wrought with fraud and abuse.\n\nOn setting a minimum wage in Louisiana higher than the federal minimum of $7.25 an hour\n\nBaton Rouge businessman Eddie Rispone, shown here as he arrived at the Louisiana Secretary of State's office Aug. 6 to qualify for the governor's election, has earned an endorsement from the Louisiana Association of Business and Industry. (Photo: Greg Hilburn/USA Today Network)\n\nAbraham: No. The congressman said he believes raising the minimum wage would stifle business and lead to job losses.\n\nEdwards: Yes. Edwards has supported some form of state minimum wage in each of his four years as governor, but the Legislature has killed it each year.\n\nRispone: No. Rispone, like Abraham, believes raising the minimum wage in Louisiana would hurt the economy and contract jobs.\n\nQuick hits\n\nOn whether they support Louisiana's \"fetal heartbeat\" bill prohibiting abortions after about 6 weeks with no exceptions for rape or incest\n\nAbraham: Yes.\n\nEdwards: Yes (he signed the bill, though its enactment depends on court rulings).\n\nRispone: Yes.\n\nOn whether they support the death penalty\n\nAbraham: Yes.\n\nEdwards: The governor has dodged questions about his personal belief, saying only that he will follow state law, which allows the death penalty.\n\nRispone: No.\n\nOn whether they would support a gas tax increase (Louisiana has a $14 billion backlog of deferred infrastructure maintenance)\n\nAbraham: Yes, if passed by the Legislature.\n\nEdwards: Yes.\n\nRispone: No.\n\nOn whether they will support full funding of TOPS, Louisiana's popular college scholarship program\n\nAbraham: Yes.\n\nEdwards: Yes.\n\nRispone: Yes.\n\nOn whether they would support phasing out a temporary .45-cent sales tax sooner than its expiration date of 2025\n\nAbraham: Yes.\n\nEdwards: No.\n\nRispone: No.\n\nOn whether there should be a state law requiring background checks to buy guns\n\nAbraham: No.\n\nEdwards: Yes for commercial sales; no for private sales.\n\nRispone: No.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/10/11/louisiana-governor-race-where-candidates-stand-issues/3955748002/", "description": "See where Louisiana governor candidates Ralph Abraham, Eddie Rispone and John Bell Edwards stand on Medicaid expansion, minimum wage and other issues.", "authors": ["Greg Hilburn", "Published A.M.
