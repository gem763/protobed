Boris Johnson in comments branded \u201cmisleading\u201d by the official statistician.\n\nAnd the CER said that the gap \u2013 calculated by comparing the UK\u2019s actual performance with those of comparable countries \u2013 had grown over the three months to June this year as Britain\u2019s economy shrank by 0.2 per cent while others continued to grow.\n\nThe CER analysis found that the contributions of consumption, investment and trade to UK GDP were all lower by the middle of this year than would have been the case after a Remain vote.\n\nAnd the think tank\u2019s deputy director John Springford said that while there would be some beneficial impact on consumer confidence and the value of sterling from a deal, the UK economy would still experience a permanent loss of growth due to the increased barriers to trade with its closest neighbours which are an inevitable part of Brexit.\n\nMr Springford said: \u201cIf Britain and the EU sign a deal in the next two weeks and the UK enters the transition phase, growth may rebound a little.\n\n\u201cBut uncertainty over the future relationship with the EU will continue to weigh on growth.\u201d\n\nThe Institute for Government\u2019s Brexit programme director Joe Owen told The Independent that the withdrawal agreement currently being negotiated with Brussels represents only a \u201ctiny subset\u201d of the issues which must be settled for the UK to finalise its future relationship with the EU, including trade, security and broader cooperation.\n\nExperience from previous deals suggest it will be \u201cimpossible\u201d for Mr Johnson to negotiate, ratify and implement a \u201cbest-in-class free trade agreement\u201d of the kind he says he wants with Europe by the end of the proposed transition period in December 2020, said Mr Owen.\n\nWith a new European Commission taking office on 1 November and likely to be preoccupied with the EU\u2019s multi-year budget as it draws up a new mandate for talks with the UK on future relations, it was highly likely that Britain will have to take up the option of a further two-year extension to December 2022.\n\nAnd even with this breathing space, it would be \u201cextremely impressive and surprising, based on international standards, if they were to agree a best-in-class free trade agreement in the three years available in the extended transition period\u201d, said Mr Owen, who said that the proposed agreement would be \u201cmuch more contentious\u201d than most FTAs because it involves breaking up trade links rather than forging them.\n\nEven if an FTA could be sealed in significantly less than the five-to-eight-year timespan typically required, businesses and government departments would then need time to prepare for entirely new arrangements for customs and immigration \u2013 processes normally undertaken over a decade or more \u2013 he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very possible that these big questions will still be going round and round by the middle of the 2020s, if not beyond,\u201d said Mr Owen \u201cThis is going to dominate government for years and years to come.\u201d\n\nIf a withdrawal agreement is reached this month, \u201cit\u2019s hard to see how official civil service activity dies down significantly and it\u2019s hard to see how the new negotiation is less contentious and doesn\u2019t soak up just as much political capital and time and energy,\u201d he said.\n\nAgreement this month will not end the threat of no deal, meaning British businesses will face repeated periods of uncertainty about the potential for a sudden change in trading arrangements, he warned.\n\nThe UK will face another crunch point in June 2020, when it is likely to have to ask for an extension to negotiation at a time when the EU will be able to exert maximum leverage over future access to UK fishing waters and equivalence for financial services regulations.\n\nAnd if a future partnership deal is finally achieved, it has to be ratified not only by Westminster and the European parliament but by national and regional assemblies across the continent, with the risk that a single veto could crash the agreement and force the UK once more to extend negotiations or revert to unfavourable World Trade Organisation terms.\n\nAs campaigners prepare for Saturday\u2019s march, Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson, Labour\u2019s London mayor Sadiq Khan, Joanna Cherry \u2013 the Scottish National Party MP who challenged the government in the courts over prorogation \u2013 Green MP Caroline Lucas, Labour\u2019s David Lammy, Plaid Cymru Westminster leader Liz Saville Roberts and Change UK leader Anna Soubry were all confirmed as speakers for the rally outside parliament.\n\nAnnouncing her party\u2019s proposed amendment to Mr Johnson\u2019s Queen\u2019s Speech, Ms Swinson said: \u201cThe best deal we have is as members of the European Union and we want to give the people the chance to choose to stop Brexit.\u201d\n\nMr Johnson is required by law to request an extension to Brexit negotiations unless he has secured parliamentary approval for a deal by Saturday.\n\nBut the author of the law, Commons Brexit Committee chair Hilary Benn, said it was also vital to ensure that any deal is subjected to public approval in a confirmatory referendum.\n\n\u201cSaturday is the day when the Safeguard Act comes into force,\u201d said Mr Benn. \u201cIf the prime minister hasn\u2019t by then succeeded in reaching a deal with the EU that parliament has approved then he will have to obey the law and seek an extension to the Brexit deadline.\n\n\u201cBut if a deal is put before parliament, then the next few days will be vital in seeking to ensure that it goes back to the people in a confirmatory referendum with Remain on the ballot paper.\n\n\u201cNow is the time for everyone to let their MP know just how much support there is for a Final Say referendum so that the British people can decide what happens.\u201d\n\nThe Centre for European Reform report can be read at https://www.cer.eu/insights/cost-brexit-june-2019", "description": "Brexit has already cost the UK economy almost \u00a370bn
