Derby previously said the 33-year-old Ireland international was among a small group of players who \u201ccontinued drinking into the night\u201d after a team-building dinner with club staff.\n\nBennett says: \u201cBeing a footballer and someone who young fans look up to I know the example I set is key. I am ashamed. At 23 I am old enough, and I was brought up, to know better.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Second-tier English club Derby is sanctioning two of its players who were charged with drunk driving following a car crash that left team captain Richard Keogh with a season-ending knee injury.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
