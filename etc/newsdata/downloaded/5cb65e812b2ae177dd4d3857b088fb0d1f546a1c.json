Apparently, we\u2019ve stopped going to church.\n\nThe data comes from the findings of two surveys released this month. Analyzing 2017 data from the American Time Use Survey, economist Michelle Freeman of the Bureau of Labor Statistics found that while millennials are more highly educated and spend more time working than their older counterparts, they have stepped back dramatically from religious activities.\n\nAD\n\nAt the Pew Research Center, studies tracking America\u2019s religious landscape found that although religious beliefs and practice have been declining at a rapid pace for people of all ages, the drop-off has been most pronounced among people ages 23 to 38. In 2019, roughly two-thirds attend worship services \u201ca few times a year\u201d or less, and 4 in 10 say they seldom or never go. A decade ago, it was more than half and only 3 in 10, respectively.\n\nAD\n\nSome of this might strike you as not-so-shocking. Millennials are entering their prime working years; they\u2019ve got to make their way, climb their ladders, pay down all that student loan debt somehow. So what if they don\u2019t have as much time for what the surveys call \u201ccivic and religious engagement\u201d right now? Most of us tend to believe in a life cycle effect: Yes, people may drift away from their church or temple or congregation when they\u2019re young, but they tend to come back when they have kids and things settle down.\n\nExcept that\u2019s not what\u2019s happening, either. Millennials are leaving religion \u2014 especially Christianity \u2014 and they\u2019re not going back.\n\nAD\n\nWhat to make of this latest deviation? First, there\u2019s the discomfiting reminder that millennials aren\u2019t as young as they used to be. Being born from 1981 to 1996 means that, at the upper end, some of us are 38 years old. By then you could be on your second husband and third career. Also, we may have \u201ckilled\u201d Toys R Us, but we\u2019re still having families: 30 percent of us now have children under the age of six. It\u2019s just that we\u2019re not drifting back into worshiping or volunteering.\n\nAD\n\nBut then again, so what? Will it matter for anyone other than the Sunday ushers whose collection baskets have suddenly gotten lighter?\n\nYes, actually. Religious and other civic organizations will atrophy \u2014 and not just from lack of funds. Faith and practice can\u2019t persevere through our generation without attendance, and neither can the hope they tend to bring. And while that may not seem like a problem now, it will soon. We still want relationships and transcendence, to be part of something bigger than ourselves. Our drive for those things isn\u2019t likely to wane, despite how ambivalent we might feel about ancient liturgies or interminable coffee hours or even pastors whose politics have taken a sharp turn MAGA-wards.\n\nAD\n\nSome of us are turning to convenient, low-commitment substitutes for faith and fellowship: astrology, the easy \u201cspiritualism\u201d of yoga and self-care, posting away on Twitter and playing more games. (Yes, literal games. The BLS survey found that we\u2019re nearly twice as likely to get our game on than non-millennials, and for a longer time \u2014 but then again, we\u2019re the \u201cWorld of Warcraft\u201d generation).\n\nAD\n\nHere\u2019s what really worries me: Few of these activities are as geared toward building deep relationships and communal support as the religious traditions the millennials are leaving behind. Actively participating in a congregation means embedding oneself in a community. This involves you in the lives of others and the other way around \u2014 their joys and sadnesses, connections and expectations. By leaving religion, we\u2019re shrugging off the ties that bind, not just loosening them temporarily.\n\nWhich is freeing, in some sense \u2014 \u201cFinally, no one\u2019s breathing down my neck about finding a spouse!\u201d \u2014 until it\u2019s not. Much of the conversation around millennials today does center on workload and debt, but it\u2019s our generation\u2019s complaints about relationship culture, family formation and a lack thereof that are likely to reach a crescendo in the coming years. Dating apps were exciting in 2012, but seven years later we\u2019re burnt out. A new wave of egg-freezing start-ups is targeting the growing number of millennial women who still haven\u2019t found the partner they hoped they would.\n\nAD\n\nIn longer-range studies, researchers are also seeing that millennials are busier but also much more lonely. Perhaps as a result, we are having much less sex \u2014 attributable to fewer long-term relationships, exactly the sort of tie-ups that used to be fostered by churches and civic organizations.\n\nAD\n\nThe Pew and BLS surveys are MRIs for the soul: They give a snapshot of busy millennial life that many will easily attribute to our phase of life. But while phases pass, the underlying needs and wants will continue to matter. What happens when sleeping, working and gaming more than our elders begins to make less sense? If we\u2019re closing the church doors behind us, we\u2019ll have to find somewhere else to tend to our spirits \u2014 and our hearts.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Few of their new favorite activities are geared toward building deep relationships at all, let alone in a religious context.", "authors": ["Christine Emba", "Columnist Focused On Ideas"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/1UYxB3PI45PuRl9UVnchMfqySjg=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EUZHKXVL6II6TFARUYEPTUGC2M.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
