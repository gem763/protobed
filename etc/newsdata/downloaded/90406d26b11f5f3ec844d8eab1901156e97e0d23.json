In three years of bitter conflict it turned Spain into Europe\u2019s ideological battleground, killing about 500,000 people and sowing bitter divisions.\n\nFranco was initially left out of a junta formed when coup leader General Jose Sanjurjo died in a plane crash shortly after the uprising, but he joined in August after his Moroccan columns crossed to the mainland and advanced towards Madrid.\n\nRebel generals met near Salamanca in September to choose a leader, opting for Franco thanks to his successes on the battlefield and hopes that fellow Fascist leaders Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini, with whom he had good relations, would provide military assistance.\n\nFranco assumed the title of head of state, and a nationalist government to rival the elected Republican one was installed in Burgos and recognised by Germany and Italy in November.\n\nIn April 1937 he merged the Falange Fascists with other traditionalist factions to create the \u201cMovement\u201d, a single-party system that lasted until his death in 1975.\n\nWith the help of men, planes and munitions from Hitler and Mussolini, Franco defeated the Soviet-backed Republicans to take power in April 1939.\n\nDICTATORSHIP\n\nAfter crushing final pockets of resistance, Franco unleashed a campaign of executions and mass jailings that lasted well into the next decade.\n\nHis rule remained authoritarian. Other parties were banned, active opposition figures were jailed and police clamped down on any demonstrations by students or workers, often violently.\n\nWhen World War Two broke out in September 1939, Franco at first declared Spain\u2019s neutrality, but after France fell in June 1940 he became more openly sympathetic to the Nazis.\n\nWhile never a formal ally, Spain sent a division to fight alongside Hitler\u2019s forces in Russia and gave logistical support to German submarines and fighter planes.\n\nFranco\u2019s regime was isolated politically and economically after Germany\u2019s wartime defeat in 1945, which caused great hardship to most Spaniards.\n\nDuring the Cold War, however, Franco\u2019s fervent anti-communist views found a receptive audience. The United States granted aid to Spain in 1953 and it joined the United Nations in 1955. NATO and the European Economic Community membership would have to wait until after Franco\u2019s death in 1975, however.\n\nFranco\u2019s domestic policies became less repressive after Spain became a major tourist destination in the 1960s, although political opposition was still banned and censorship remained in force.\n\nIn 1969, he designated as his official successor prince Juan Carlos, the grandson of Alfonso XIII, the Spanish monarch exiled when the Republicans took office 1931.\n\nFranco died on Nov. 20, 1975. In a posthumous message, he sought forgiveness from all Spaniards. \u201cJust as with all my heart I forgive those who declared themselves my enemies ... I believe that I had no enemies other than the enemies of Spain.\u201d\n\nPOLARISING LEGACY\n\nFranco\u2019s admirers saw him as a firm hand who fostered Spain\u2019s longest period of peace after centuries of turmoil, his detractors as a ruthless fascist who abrogated hard-won democratic freedoms.\n\nIn an effort to ease the transition to democracy after his death, Spain passed a pact pardoning political crimes committed during the conflict and his dictatorship.\n\nIn 2007, the Socialist government passed a historical memory law that seeks to recognise those who suffered under Franco.\n\nMore than a decade later, the same party is making good on a promise to remove Franco\u2019s remains from the Valley of the Fallen complex, which it has long sought to turn into a memorial to the hundreds of thousands killed in the civil war.\n\nAs the country barrels towards national elections in November, the exhumation has highlighted deep splits in parliament. In 2018, just 176 lawmakers voted in favour of moving him. Two were against while 165 - members of the conservative People\u2019s Party and centre-right Ciudadanos - abstained.\n\n\u201cWe are closing a dark chapter of our history,\u201d acting Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said last month, while Ciudadanos leader Albert Rivera accused him of \u201cplaying with Franco\u2019s bones to divide us.\u201d", "description": "Spain will on Thursday remove the remains of Francisco Franco from the state mausoleum where he lies buried, as the Socialist government seeks to end decades of controversy over the dictator's resting place.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
