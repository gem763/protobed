(David J. Kim/The Washington Post) (David Kim/David J. Kim)\n\nThe annual Army Ten-Miler will bring 35,000 runners and thousands more spectators to the Washington region on Sunday, closing streets and disrupting traffic, parking and transit across parts of the District and Northern Virginia.\n\nThe race, which starts at 8 a.m., begins and ends at the Pentagon, and the course will take runners through a large swath of the region throughout the morning and early afternoon.\n\nRunners will trek from the Pentagon toward the District via Route 110, passing Arlington National Cemetery and crossing the Francis Scott Key Memorial Bridge into Georgetown. There they will head east, passing parts of Foggy Bottom and entering the Mall area before crossing the Potomac again via the Interstate 395 HOV lanes to the finish line at the Pentagon.\n\nSome of the street closures will begin as early as 5:30 a.m., and residents and visitors should also anticipate parking restrictions along the route. The entire stretch of Route 110, which runs from Rosslyn to Crystal City, will be closed from 5:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. There will also be shorter-term rolling closures in effect along the course from about 7:30 a.m. until 11:30 a.m.\n\nThis map will help you explore the 35th Army Ten-Miler. Keep reading for information on Metro and a list of the street closures.\n\nRace route No parking and intermittently closed roads Mile marker First aid 1 Water station Spectator location WHITEHURST FRWY. key br.

There will be extra trains running on the Blue Line between Franconia-Springfield and Stadium-Armory from 7 a.m. until about 8:40 a.m. and from 11:15 a.m. to 12:50 p.m., Metro said.\n\nThe closest Metro station to the race starting point is the Pentagon station, which will be an \u201cexit-only\u201d station from 7 to 9 a.m. Metro officials are advising runners and spectators to use the Pentagon City station instead to avoid potential crowding at the Pentagon station.\n\nBuses that usually travel to the Pentagon station will be redirected to Pentagon City from the start of service Sunday morning through 2 p.m. Find more details here about how to get there, parking, and taxi and ride-share drop-off locations.\n\nThe road closures include:\n\nNorthern Virginia\n\nArlington Memorial Bridge\n\nI-395 HOV (northbound) to the Eads Street ramp\n\nLong Bridge Drive\n\nThe District\n\nConstitution Avenue NW between 23rd and 18th streets\n\nVirginia Avenue NW (all lanes)\n\nRock Creek Parkway south of Virginia Avenue NW\n\nIndependence Avenue SW (westbound lanes) from 14th to 7th streets\n\n4th Street along Jefferson Drive\n\n14th Street, south I-395 HOV (northbound)", "description": "The annual Army 10-Miler will bring 35,000 runners and thousands more spectators to the Washington region Sunday.", "authors": ["Luz Lazo", "Transportation Reporter Covering Washington'S Metro", "Buses", "Capital Bikeshare", "Taxis", "The Region'S Road Network"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/cwAQn-wKabY90SkFiXAlB7QRtX4=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FCRDTDXSQFHOXHAKQCZTXCEID4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
