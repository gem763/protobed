Though lawmakers have long promised a resolution recognizing the Armenian genocide, they have been hampered by Turkey\u2019s role as a critical ally whose significance has only increased with the rise of violent extremism across the Middle East.\n\nAs soon as next week, Democrats in the House of Representatives could ratify a measure recognizing the Armenian genocide, moving it out of committee and to the chamber floor, where it is likely to pass. The House Rules Committee is set to announce Thursday that it is going to take up the resolution next week, a final formal process before it can receive a vote.\n\nRep.

Jim McGovern, D-Mass., told Yahoo News, noting that his Worcester-area district has the oldest Armenian diaspora community in the United States. \u201cNot acknowledging the genocide is a stain on our human rights record and sends the exact wrong message to human rights abusers around the world,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to start holding Turkey accountable for its actions,\u201d said Rep. Don Beyer, D-Va. \u201cBoth Congress and the White House have remained silent on this issue for far too long, and I look forward to changing that next week.\u201d\n\nMembers of the Senate have introduced a genocide-recognition resolution of their own, though its fate is less clear.\n\nHaving either one or both chambers endorse such a resolution could prove awkward for President Trump, who is fond of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Sensitive to Turkey\u2019s geopolitical influence, American presidents have shied away from recognizing the Armenian genocide. The only president to do so was Ronald Reagan, in 1981. And though Congress has passed similar genocide resolutions, it has been more than two decades since it last did so.\n\n\u201cWith the president caving in to Erdogan, it\u2019s up to Congress to speak out for America,\u201d Aram Hamparian, the executive director of the Armenian National Committee of America, told Yahoo News. He added that the resolution would be a \u201csignal\u201d to the Turks that \u201cWashington won\u2019t be bullied, U.S. policy can\u2019t be hijacked and American principles are not for sale.\u201d\n\nProtesters in L.A. rally in 2017 outside the Turkish Consulate in commemoration of the 102nd anniversary of the Armenian genocide.

And it would be another instance of Congress rebuking Trump on his handling of foreign policy. The president was put in a similar position over his affinity for Russian President Vladimir Putin, after both chambers imposed new sanctions on Russia in 2017 as a punishment for interfering in the 2016 presidential election. Trump groused but signed the sanctions into law.\n\nOn the Armenian front, the new push for genocide recognition does not come because of historical revelations or newfound reserves of moral courage. Consensus that the killing of Armenians by Turks constituted a genocide is universal among those who have studied it. Yet Turkey has consistently denied that a concerted ethnic cleansing took place, and it has strenuously lobbied on Capitol Hill to keep the killing of Armenians from being classified as genocide.", "description": "As soon as next week, Democrats in the House could ratify a measure recognizing the Armenian genocide out of committee and to the chamber floor, where it is likely to pass.", "authors": ["Alexander Nazaryan", "National Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/cBaVMzD7RNru8LBgcduWZg--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/26c3f940-f668-11e9-a97e-c142a99d9ed3", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
