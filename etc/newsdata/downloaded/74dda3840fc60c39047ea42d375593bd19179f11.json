Best clickbait in the world, \u2018someone is spying on us\u2019.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t say it was us. He was very deliberate in doing that. He talked about it being someone else, probably a fan. But everyone has jumped on it. (He) has been very clever.\u201d\n\nHansen added that he and Jones exchanged text messages and \u201claughed\u201d at the claims and the stories about the pair\u2019s mind games ahead of the semi-final.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a mind game only if you buy into it,\u201d Hansen said. \u201cAs I said, it\u2019s allowed us to have a good laugh.\u201d\n\nThe New Zealander also dismissed suggestions in some quarters that the All Blacks are under more pressure than Jones\u2019s side, given they are two-times defending champions.\n\n\u201cI have talked about pressure since I have been All Blacks coach,\u201d he said. \u201cEarly in our history we probably ran away from it and ... let it chase us down the street.\n\n\u201cThese days we acknowledge it\u2019s there. We get it every game ... doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a quarter-final, semi-final or a test match. There is pressure ... but it would be very naive not to acknowledge it to be on both sides.\u201d\n\nHansen also said he doubts that Jones believes his own statement that England have \u201cnothing to lose\u201d.\n\n\u201cThey will have memories of the tournament from four years ago, where it didn\u2019t go that good,\u201d Hansen said of England\u2019s failure to go beyond the pool phase of the tournament they hosted four years ago.\n\n\u201cFor him to say they have nothing to lose, Eddie doesn\u2019t believe that either. They have had four years of work resulting in one outcome ... they have built themselves up for this.\n\n\u201cThat brings its own pressure.\u201d", "description": "All Blacks coach Steve Hansen has laughed off spying claims by England counterpart Eddie Jones and repeated his own assertions that the Australian likes to play mind games before big matches.", "authors": ["Greg Stutchbury", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444414672&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N0IC-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
