(Mauricio Lima/The New York Times)\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s decision Sunday to step aside and let Turkish forces come into northern Syria instantly cast into doubt the fate of ethnic Kurds there who have been the United States\u2019 closest allies in the fight against the Islamic State group, and who had worked to achieve a degree of self-rule in that stretch of Syria.\n\nNow, the question of who could provide a long-term deterrent to Iranian and Russian interests in the area \u2014 and help ensure that the Islamic State does not rebound in Syria \u2014 is suddenly very much in play again.\n\nWhat now for U.S. allies?\n\nThe prospect of a Turkish military push into northern Syria has caused deep fear in Kurdish areas there, as well as a burning sense that the Kurds have been betrayed by the United States after years of partnership on the battlefield.\n\nThe Syrian Democratic Forces \u2014 a loose coalition of militias that is led by Syrian Kurdish fighters and came together expressly to fight the Islamic State with U.S. backing, training and air support \u2014 accused the United States on Monday of failing to fulfill its obligations, paving the way for Turkey to invade.\n\nThe SDF also warned that a Turkish incursion could undo the gains made against the Islamic State.\n\n\u201cThis military operation in northeast Syria will have a great negative effect on our war against the ISIS organization and will destroy all that has been achieved in terms of stability over the past years,\u201d the group said in a statement, using an alternative name for the Islamic State.\n\nIt said it would \u201cnot hesitate for one instant to defend ourselves\u201d and called on the area\u2019s people to \u201cdefend our homeland from Turkish aggression.\u201d\n\nIt was unclear Monday when and where Turkish forces would cross into Syria, but the sense of betrayal by the United States among Syrian Kurds was clear.\n\n\u201cU.S. forces on the ground showed us that this is not how they value friendship and alliance,\u201d Mustafa Bali, a spokesman for the SDF, wrote on Twitter on Monday, adding that Trump\u2019s decision was \u201cabout to ruin the trust and cooperation between the SDF and U.S.\u201d\n\nStill, the Syrian Kurds have few other supporters to turn to.\n\nInside Syria, most of what remains of the country\u2019s rebel movement is backed by Turkey and opposes the SDF, and its relations with the government of President Bashar Assad are chilly.\n\nSome analysts speculate that the Kurds will be forced to court Assad\u2019s government for protection.\n\nWhat role do the Kurds play in Syria?\n\nThe Kurds are the driver within the Syrian Democratic Forces, which came together to help the United States fight the jihadis of the Islamic State.\n\nIts fighters received air support and training from the United States and fought together on the ground with U.S. Special Operations forces against the jihadis, losing thousands of fighters.\n\nThat has won the group praise from a range of top U.S. officials, and after eight years of war in Syria, the SDF remains the only significant armed group still aligned with Washington.\n\nWhile many of the group\u2019s fighters and most of its leaders are ethnic Kurds, the SDF also includes Arabs and members of Syria\u2019s other religious and ethnic minorities. Its ideology is secular, and it promotes a form of democracy characterized by rule at the community level.\n\nThe United States has given the SDF generous military support, but it has not endorsed the group\u2019s political project, in part to keep from alienating Turkey even more.\n\nSince the official destruction of the Islamic State caliphate early this year, the SDF has continued to pursue Islamic State remnants in cooperation with U.S. forces while seeking to strengthen the network of local councils that have been established to govern areas liberated from the jihadis.\n\nThe Kurdish forces have also become the de facto guardians of tens of thousands of former Islamic State residents and jailed fighters in northern Syria, and they receive limited aid to do so.\n\nIf a new conflict breaks out in the area, the question of what happens to those Islamic State prisoners and their family members will become urgent.\n\nWhy does Turkey want to invade?\n\nThe United States\u2019 close cooperation with the SDF has angered Turkey, a U.S. ally in NATO. Turkey accuses the Kurdish fighters of being terrorists and closely linked to the PKK, a guerrilla organization that has fought a bloody, decadeslong insurgency against the Turkish state.", "description": "President Donald Trump's decision Sunday to step aside and let Turkish forces come into northern Syria instantly cast into doubt the fate of ethnic Kurds there who have been the United States' closest allies in the fight against the Islamic State group, and who had worked to achieve a degree", "authors": ["Ben Hubbard"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/1KuURr31gu6wYHArS1ytlA--~B/aD0zODQwO3c9NTc2MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_new_york_times_articles_158/f4bfdd76e2af30df590eb5a91ce5c301", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
