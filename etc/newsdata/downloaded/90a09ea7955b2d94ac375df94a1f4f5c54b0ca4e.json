As Lorenzo Reyes details, the league's elite class is starting to crystalize. USA TODAY\n\nThere's so much noise to process this week with the trade deadline passing and no major fantasy stars changing teams. Unfortunately, there aren't any big names on the waiver wire either this week. But with four teams on bye -- the Atlanta Falcons, Cincinnati Bengals, Los Angeles Rams and New Orleans Saints -- the demand is high. So we'll try to make some sense of what's available.\n\nRecommended bids based on a free agent acquisition budget (FAAB) of $100 for the season.\n\nBEST BETS\n\nRB Alexander Mattison, Minnesota Vikings ($14). The Vikings\u2019 rushing attack has been so potent at times this season, it can support two running backs. Even while backing up Dalvin Cook, Mattison put up his highest combined yardage of the season in Week 8. With the Chiefs up next, he could get even more touches.\n\nRB Kenyan Drake, Arizona Cardinals ($10). Drake was a forgotten man in Miami, but a trade one day before the deadline to the RB-needy Cardinals might be just what he needed to restore his fantasy value. ... For one week, at least.\n\nRunning back Kenyan Drake was squeezed out of the game plan in Miami, but could have an immediate impact after a trade to Arizona.

Drake can run and catch the ball so there's some potential here if the injuries persist.\n\nTE Ryan Griffin, Houston Texans ($8). With the persistent injuries plaguing Jets tight ends, Griffin has stepped up as a legitimate option in the passing game. He had Week 8\u2019s most productive fantasy day among tight ends with four catches for 66 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nFANTASY SIZZLERS, FIZZLERS: Daniel Jones was great in Week 8\n\nREPLACEMENTS\n\nRB Tra Carson, Detroit Lions ($7). Once the Lions put starting running back Kerryon Johnson on injured reserve last week, Ty Johnson looked like he would be next in line for carries. But after Sunday\u2019s game, there\u2019s no clear answer. Carson got a much larger share than expected. Even though the results weren't earth-shattering, he led the team in carries (12) and rushing yards (34).\n\nWR Hunter Renfrow, Oakland Raiders ($7). Renfrow, also had his best game of the season in Week 8 \u2014 catching four passes for 88 yards and his first NFL touchdown. He could be a decent bye-week filler, especially if No. 1 WR Tyrell Williams continues to have foot issues.\n\nWR Darius Slayton, New York Giants ($11). Another rookie wideout made his greatest impact of the season, making the most of his two catches by scoring on both of them. Slayton had 50 yards and five targets as rookie QB Daniel Jones also had his best game of the year.\n\nWR Preston Williams, Miami Dolphins ($5). Williams led the Dolphins in targets on Monday night, setting career highs with six receptions for 82 yards. Hey, the ball has to go to someone.\n\nTE Jonnu Smith, Tennessee Titans ($4). If Delanie Walker continues to be limited by injury, Smith has shown he can produce. He caught six of seven targets for 78 yards and a score.\n\nRB Derrius Guice, Washington Redskins ($3). For those who aren't necessarily looking for immediate help, there's a possibility a No. 1 running back could soon be back on the field. Guice has been out since Week 1 with a knee injury, but the Redskins have designated him to return from injured reserve \u2014 and he'll need to be activated within three weeks.\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.
