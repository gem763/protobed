The sanctions have battered Iran's economy and put pressure on Rouhani.\n\nIn an interview with ABC News anchor David Muir last week, Rouhani called the sanctions \"an economic form of terrorism\" against Iranians and said they have been \"extremely destructive and extremely hurtful.\"\n\nThe pressure has pushed Iran's economy to the brink.

Inflation spiked 31% in 2018, according to the International Monetary Fund.\n\nReuters, FILE\n\nAs of early this year, the unemployment rate of 15-to-24-years living in cities was at 31.5%, according to the official website of the quasi-government-run Statistical Center of Iran.\n\nAs the value of the Iranian rial drops, the price of goods has skyrocketed, with red meat and poultry climbing by 57%, vegetables by 47% and milk, cheese and eggs by 37%, according to the Statistical Center of Iran.\n\nBut while the government has blamed the west for its tough economic situation, his critics also point to the problem of widespread corruption.", "description": "Brother of Iranian president Hassan Rouhani sentenced to five years imprisonment on corruption charges", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/hossein-fereydoun-gty-jt-191001_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
