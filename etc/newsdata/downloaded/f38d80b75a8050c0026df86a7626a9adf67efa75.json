Over the years, it received over a billion dollars worth of government contracts to provide security to top US officials, train members of the Iraqi army and police, and support the US Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) and Department of Defense's counternarcotics programme in Afghanistan.\n\nBut following the 2007 Nisour Square incident, wherein Blackwater employees killed 14 unarmed Iraqi civilians at a traffic circle, the firm and its founder shot to international notoriety, highlighting the clear dangers of using armed military contractors on the battlefield.\n\nPrince, a former US Navy SEAL, has since been channelling his efforts to train security personnel abroad, including most recently in China, where he launched the Hong Kong-based Frontier Services Group, a security and logistics company.\n\nHe has also offered a proposal to end the costly, ongoing US-led war in Afghanistan - the longest in the US history - by privatising the bulk of it: replacing thousands of US troops with private contractors and sending NATO forces home. But is he really the man to bring peace to the war-torn country?\n\nIn front of the Oxford Union audience, we challenge Prince on the record of his private contractors in the Iraq war and ask him to explain how his controversial plan for the conflict in Afghanistan would bring it to an end. We'll also ask Prince, who previously served as an informal adviser to President Trump and has been interviewed by both the US House Intelligence Committee and Special Counsel Robert Mueller about his ties to the current administration.\n\nWe are joined by a panel of three experts:\n\nSean McFate , a former private military contractor, ex-officer in the US army, and author of The New Rules of War\n\nGhaith Abdul-Ahad , an award-winning journalist with the Guardian from Iraq who has covered conflicts in Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen and beyond\n\nTim Collins , a former commander in the British Army and cofounder of the private military consulting company, New Century\n\nThis episode will be broadcast on March 8 at 20:00 GMT and will be repeated on March 9 at 12:00 GMT, March 10 at 01:00GMT and March 11 at 06:00 GMT.\n\nFollow us on Facebook and Twitter @AJHeadtoHead.
