The Spanish players\u2019 union, the AFE, will organise the stoppage. There is an international break on the weekend of 3 November, meaning the strike is likely to start on 16 November. The AFE president, David Aganzo, said other possible dates are under discussion.\n\nBarcelona and Real Madrid agree 18 December date for rescheduled cl\u00e1sico Read more\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going on strike,\u201d said the Athletic Bilbao captain, Ainhoa Tirapu, flanked by almost 200 players from the 16 clubs that compete in the first division. She said \u201cred lines\u201d had been crossed and the players had been left with no choice but to take industrial action.\n\nA strike had been considered towards the end of last season but was ruled out because it was not considered the right time. Aganzo said there had been 18 meetings with the clubs in an effort to reach an agreement.\n\nThe AFE wants an increase in minimum salary from \u20ac16,000 a year to \u20ac20,000 but the biggest stumbling block has been the failure to reach an agreement on part-time contracts. The players demanded part-time contracts have a minimum salary of \u20ac12,000, 75% of the full-time salary. The clubs argued it should be 50%, or \u20ac8,000.\n\n\u201cWe are footballers 24 hours a day, 100% of the time,\u201d Tirapu said. \u201cWe had to take drastic measures, negotiating alone was not enough. We have to seek a better future. We have to fight for our rights.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe go on about how good women footballers are and we have to give them what they deserve,\u201d Aganzo said. \u201cWe have to respect women. They should have rights commensurate with their obligations.\u201d", "description": "Spanish women footballers voted to take \u2018drastic measures\u2019 and aim to go on strike on 16 November", "authors": ["Sid Lowe"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4605e04c97eb343f4cef64538b44c7c323e8c6b/224_242_722_433/master/722.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5d18d1fd96154bf0e1e37902ad25fac5", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
