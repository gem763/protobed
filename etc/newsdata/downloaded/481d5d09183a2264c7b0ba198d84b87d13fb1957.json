Two huge downside price gaps with very heavy volume grab your attention. The moving averages have a hard time reacting. From a low in May prices have been creeping higher.\n\nSMG is now above the rising 50-day average line but still below the declining 200-day line.\n\nThe On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line shows some improvement from the May low and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator is above the zero line but crossing to the downside.\n\nIn this weekly bar chart of STMP, below, we can see that the price gaps disappear but the decline is still very dramatic. Prices are below the declining 40-week moving average line.\n\nThe weekly OBV line declined to a May low but it has inched higher in recent months.\n\nThe MACD oscillator generated a cover shorts buy signal in June but is still below the zero line.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of STMP, below, we can see a relatively nearby price target.\n\nBottom line strategy: STMP has been inching higher from late May. It could inch still higher but the overall chart pattern and indicators are not instilling confidence for investors. We can probably find better looking charts.", "description": "Let's look at the charts and indicators....STMP", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Stamps.Com Might Inch Higher But Overall The Charts Are Not Inspiring", "Let'S Look At The Charts", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "Jim Cramer", "James", "Rev Shark", "Peter Tchir", "Gary Berman", "Carolyn Boroden"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/592d35bf-ba17-11e9-805f-d1fb41243155.png", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
