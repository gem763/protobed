In a second incident, Pakistani forces fencing a section of the border were attacked and three were killed, the ministry said on Saturday.\n\nBoth incidents occurred in Pakistan\u2019s northwestern Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province.\n\nPakistan underscored in its meeting with the Afghan diplomat that Afghanistan was responsible for securing its side of the border.\n\nAn Afghan government spokesman could not be immediately reached. Afghan officials have in recent weeks accused the Pakistani military of several incidents of heavy artillery fire into Afghanistan.\n\nBoth of the uneasy neighbours are battling militant factions along their largely porous border and each accuses the other of harbouring their militant enemies.\n\nPakistan also summoned an Indian diplomat on Saturday after it said firing by Indian forces across the Line of Control (LoC) in the disputed territory of Kashmir killed a 40-year-old woman from the village of Balakot.\n\nThe nuclear-armed neighbours have fought two of their three wars over Kashmir.\n\nThe LoC, an old ceasefire line, is the de facto border between the parts of Kashmir that India and Pakistan administer.\n\nTensions between the two countries have flared since Aug. 5 when New Delhi flooded Indian Kashmir with troops to quell unrest after it revoked the region\u2019s special status.\n\nPakistan foreign affairs spokesman Mohammad Faisal said in a statement on Saturday that India deliberately targets civilian areas. A spokesman for India\u2019s external affairs ministry could not be immediately reached.\n\nIndia has long accused Pakistan of supporting militant groups fighting Indian security forces in its part of Kashmir. Pakistan denies that.", "description": "Pakistan has summoned diplomats from Afghanistan and India after several shooting incidents along two different borders killed four Pakistani soldiers and a civilian woman.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
