REUTERS/Erin Scott\n\nAhead of his first meeting with President Donald Trump this week, Zelenskiy was thrust into a political storm in Washington over accusations that Trump pressured him to launch a probe into the son of his main Democratic rival Joe Biden.\n\nZelenskiy cannot risk relations with either side of the political divide in Washington, whose bipartisan support Ukraine counts on for aid and diplomatic cover against Russia following Moscow\u2019s annexation of the Crimea peninsula in 2014.\n\nAn example of the pitfalls involved came this month when U.S. lawmakers suspected Trump of trying to withhold $250 million of military aid to Ukraine, which had already been approved by Congress, as a tool to pressure Zelenskiy. Trump denied doing so on Monday.\n\nThe Zelenskiy administration wants to stay out of the firing line following media reports that Trump asked him in a phone call in July to launch an investigation that could damage Biden.\n\nUkrainian officials deny Trump put pressure on Zelenskiy but have been reluctant to divulge details of the call, saying such conversations should be confidential.\n\n\u201cWhy should we react in any way? There was a conversation with the U.S. president. Full stop,\u201d top presidential official Oleksandr Danylyuk told Reuters by phone on Monday.\n\n\u201cAny attempts to use Ukraine by one party or the other is clearly detrimental to our relations,\u201d he added.\n\nSTAY AWAY FROM THIS MESS\n\nA comedian and, like Trump, a television star with no prior political experience when he took office, Zelenskiy won a landslide election victory in April promising voters an end to Ukraine\u2019s conflict with Russian-backed forces in the Donbass region that has killed 13,000 people.\n\nThe timing of the row in Washington is delicate for Zelenskiy, who hopes to build on the momentum from a recent prisoner swap with Russia to hold talks on the Donbass conflict with President Vladimir Putin in the coming weeks.\n\nBefore he was inaugurated, Zelenskiy got an early warning of what lay in store for him when Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudolph Giuliani announced in May that he would visit Ukraine and then abruptly aborted his trip.\n\nGiuliani had spearheaded calls for Ukraine to investigate the activities of Biden and his son, who joined the board of a Ukrainian gas company while Biden was vice president.\n\nSerhiy Leshchenko, a former Ukrainian lawmaker who was an adviser to Zelenskiy during his campaign, recalled Zelenskiy\u2019s reluctance to meet with Giuliani at that time.\n\n\u201cI think he understands that it\u2019s (an) attempt to take him and put him in the battle between two parties in the U.S.,\u201d Leshchenko told Reuters by phone.\n\n\u201cHe just doesn\u2019t want to be used by any of the sides. He\u2019s a smart guy in general, I think he\u2019s very wise and understands that for him it\u2019s better to sit away from all this mess.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause if he supports one side, the other side will be angry,\u201d he added.\n\nGiuliani canceled his visit saying Zelenskiy was surrounded by Trump\u2019s enemies. He named Leshchenko, who in August 2016 had divulged details of payments from a former Ukrainian president to Trump\u2019s campaign chief Paul Manafort during the U.S. election.\n\nGiuliani said the evidence was fake, which Leshchenko denies. Seeing how toxic the issue was likely to become, Leshchenko said he withdrew from his advisory role, not wishing to damage Zelenskiy\u2019s relations with Washington.\n\nAfter Giuliani canceled the trip, Andriy Yermak, an aide to Zelenskiy, later sought to meet Giuliani on what Yermak said was his own initiative. He was quoted in Ukrainian media outlet lb.ua on Monday as saying that he had told Giuliani that any investigation would be transparent.\n\n\u201cWe can guarantee that during our term in office all investigations will be carried out transparently,\u201d Yermak said. \u201cThese are the fundamental principles and basis of President Zelenskiy\u2019s program which we campaigned on.\u201d\n\nA Republican, Trump on Monday accused Democrats of waging a witch hunt against him, but he provided no evidence the accusations against him were politically motivated.
