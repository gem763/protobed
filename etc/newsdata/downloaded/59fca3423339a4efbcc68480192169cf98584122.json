But thankfully, it's from Aldi , and it's filled entirely with wine.\n\nSupermarket favourite Aldi has decided to bring back their best-selling wine advent calendar for 2019, fulled to the brim with 24 little bottles of red, white, sparkling and ros\u00e9 wines.\n\nSetting you back \u00a349.99, Aldi's wine advent calendar is set to return on Sunday 3rd November, where it will be available both in stores and online.\n\nBut considering it sold out in record time last year, we recommend setting your alarms for the big day if you do want to get your hands on the revamped version this time round.\n\nThe wine advent calendar includes customer favourites such as The Exquisite Collection Macon Villages and the Calvet Cap d\u2019Agde Rose, with the size of the bottles ranging from 187ml to 200ml.\n\nHowever, we can't find a cheaper option anywhere else, with Amazon selling a very similar one for \u00a369.99 , although it does appear to contain less sparkling wines than Aldi's version.\n\nWe also spotted one for \u00a355.99 on Amazon , which is heavy on the red wines but also includes four bottles of fizz.\n\nWe've got the full list of what's included in the calendar below.\n\nReds\n\nCalvet Reserve Merlot x 2\n\nCalvet Limited Release Merlot x 2\n\nJP Chenet Original Cabernet Syrah x 2\n\nSparkling\n\nBrut d\u2019Argent Pinot Noir x 2\n\nBrut d\u2019Argent Chardonnay x 2\n\nJP Chenet Ice Edition Rose x2\n\nJP Chenet Ice Edition Blanc x 2\n\nWhites\n\nJP Chenet Original Columbard Sauvignon x 2\n\nCalvet Limited Release Sauvignon x 2\n\nExquisite Collection Macon Villages Chardonnay x 2\n\nJP Chenet Original Colombard Chardonnay x 2\n\nRos\u00e9s", "description": "It's back!
