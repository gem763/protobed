Biden fights back against Trump's accusations of corruption", "language": "en", "text": "Joe Biden took another hit at Donald Trump Wednesday, demanding he 'shut up' until he releases his tax returns and proves he has no conflicts of interest.\n\nTrump insists it's his duty to put an end to corruption \u2013 an excuse he used to explain his call with his Ukrainian counterpart where he urged him to probe Biden and his son Hunter's business dealings in the country.\n\n'Mr. President, you want to talk about corruption. I've release 21-years of my tax returns,' Biden said during an event in Columbus, Ohio. 'Mr. President, even Richard Nixon released his tax returns. Mr. President, release your tax returns or shut up.'\n\nBiden made a campaign stop at the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Electrical Trade Center on Wednesday afternoon \u2013 the day after the fourth Democratic primary debates, which were held in the northeast Columbus suburb of Westerville, Ohio.\n\n'I entered as one of the poorest men in Congress, left one of the poorest men in government \u2013 in Congress and as vice president,' Biden continued in defending himself against the president's claims of corruption. 'I made no money while I was in there other than my salary.'\n\nJoe Biden had a message for Donald Trump during a campaign stop in Ohio on Wednesday: 'Mr. President, release your tax returns or shut up'\n\nIn a campaign stop the day after the fourth Democratic debates in Westerville, Ohio, Biden said he was the 'poorest' senator and vice president because the only money he made was from his salary\n\nTrump broke with longstanding precedent when he didn't release his tax returns when he became the GOP presidential nominee in 2016 and refused to release them ever since then. The practice attempts to create transparency and ensure no conflicts of interest\n\nIn his over three decades as a Senator from Delaware, Biden made somewhere between $60,000-$175,000 per year and as vice president made more than $200,000.\n\nTrump broke with a longstanding precedent where elected presidents release their tax returns to remain transparent and ensure no conflicts of interest or corruption exists between his personal businesses and the presidency.\n\nTrump and the former vice president have been smearing each other since the end of last month, when it was brought to light that Trump engaged in a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky where he attempted to solicit help to dig up dirt on his political rival.\n\nDemocrats claim Trump set a quid pro quo for Ukraine to help him influence the 2020 elections in exchange for the release of millions in military aid. The Trump administration from military aid to Ukraine just days before the July 25 phone call \u2013 but he claims it had nothing to do with the nature of their conversation.\n\nZelensky insists they didn't even discuss the military aid freeze during their talk this summer.\n\nTrump insists Biden is corrupt because his son, Hunter, accepted a board position with Ukrainian natural gas firm Burisma Holdings in 2014 \u2013 while his father was still president \u2013 and also traveled to China aboard Air Force Two in 2013 with his dad to make a visit with a Chinese-back equity firm board.\n\nBiden's son Hunter Biden (pictured) admitted he exhibited 'poor judgement' in his foreign business dealings while his father was vice president, but insists he and his father have done nothing wrong\n\nHunter reportedly earned $50,000 per month from Burisma between 2014 and earlier this year when he stepped down. The 49-year-old attorney and lobbyist also announced over the weekend that he is stepping down from Bohai Harvest RST (Shanghai) Equity Investment Fund Management Co.\n\nTrump claims Hunter made $1.5 billion in China following his tax-payer funded flight there while his father was vice president.\n\nWhen asked the campaign even in Ohio if he regrets anything with how he dealt with his son's business dealings in Ukraine and China, Biden said, 'No I don't.'\n\n'I never discussed with my son anything having to do with what was going on in Ukraine,' he continued.\n\nHunter emerged for the first time since the controversy sparked for an interview that aired Tuesday morning \u2013 just hours ahead of the Democratic debate \u2013 where no topic was off limits.\n\nIn his interview with ABC News, Hunter admitted he exhibited 'poor judgement' but maintains he and his father did nothing wrong.\n\n'In retrospect, look, I think that it was poor judgment on my part. Is that I think that it was poor judgment because I don't believe now, when I look back on it - I know that there was - did nothing wrong at all,' he said in the interview that aired on Good Morning America.\n\n'However, was it poor judgment to be in the middle of something that is...a swamp in- in - in many ways? Yeah,' he continued.\n\n'I gave a hook to some very unethical people to act in illegal ways to try to do some harm to my father. That's where I made the mistake,' he noted. 'So I take full responsibility for that. Did I do anything improper? No, not in any way. Not in any way whatsoever.'\n\n'Did I make a mistake? Well, maybe in the grand scheme of things, yeah,' he said, in reference to fallout from his overseas business. 'But did I make a mistake based upon some ethical lapse? Absolutely not.'", "description": "Joe Biden took another hit at Donald Trump Wednesday, demanding he 'shut up' until he releases his tax returns and proves he has no conflicts of interest.", "authors": ["Katelyn Caralle", "U.S. Political Reporter For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/19/19801458-0-image-a-6_1571251266703.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
