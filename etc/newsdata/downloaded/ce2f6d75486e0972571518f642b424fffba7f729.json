He wanted more", "language": "en", "text": "ASHBURN \u2014 To the skeptics, dating all the way back to high school, Terry McLaurin\u2019s NFL aspirations were a pipe dream.\n\nNot so for Terry McLaurin Sr.\n\nThe Redskin rookie\u2019s father has long collected milestones from his son\u2019s athletic accomplishments, and he made sure the younger McLaurin knew the football from the wideout\u2019s first NFL touchdown was \u201ccoming home\u201d to join the collection.\n\n\u201cHe has a man-cave full of my stuff,\u201d McLaurin said with a smile.\n\nMcLaurin Sr., it turns out, won\u2019t have to wait long for that particular souvenir.\n\nOn Sunday \u2014 his 24th birthday \u2014 the Redskins receiver plans to give his father the memento in person as his parents will be on hand at FedEx Field to watch the Redskins take on the Dallas Cowboys in Washington\u2019s home opener.\n\nMcLaurin, who had five catches for 125 yards and the touchdown in his debut, said he\u2019s happy to part with the gift.\n\nGiven his road to get to the Redskins \u2014 from being an undersized kid in Indianapolis to being overlooked at Ohio State to being a Day 2 draft pick \u2014 it\u2019s understandable.\n\nDrafted in the third round out of Ohio State, McLaurin has blown past expectations since arriving in Ashburn. Hailed for being the \u201cNo.1 special teams player\u201d in the draft by coach Jay Gruden, McLaurin didn\u2019t step on the field Sunday as a special teamer.\n\nHe\u2019s just too valuable.\n\nIn just a few months, the 6-foot-1 speedster has established himself as a starter that coaches are not going to risk losing on a kickoff.\n\n\u201cIt just speaks to what he\u2019s done as a receiver,\u201d receivers coach Ike Hilliard said. \u201cHe came in and got the work in. He learned on a daily basis. You try to apply to the grass from the classroom and he did that a very high clip.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we were smart, we would have taken him in the first round,\u201d Gruden said.\n\n\u2018Maybe this kid\u2019s got something\u2019\n\nNestled in for an afternoon of football at his Indiana home, Rick Streiff was watching Falcons-Vikings when the Fox broadcast interrupted the game to show highlights of McLaurin\u2019s first NFL touchdown. The ex-Cathedral high school coach saw his former player race past his defender with a post-route and sprint to the end zone.\n\nIt reminded him of another play, the one that convinced Strieff the young player was more than just a skinny teenager with speed.\n\nDuring Cathedral\u2019s state sectional playoff game against rival Roncali in 2011, McLaurin \u2014 then a 5-foot-7 sophomore \u2014 caught the game-winning touchdown, torching his defender to haul in a prayer from the Cathedral\u2019s quarterback.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s at that point, that\u2019s when you start going, \u2018OK, maybe this kid\u2019s got something here,\u2019\u201d Streiff said.\n\nMcLaurin\u2019s development took off in the following years \u2014 driven by a strong work ethic. McLaurin went from a 5-foot-4, 140-pound freshman to a 6-foot senior who in 2013 earned Indiana\u2019s Mr. Football award, given to the state\u2019s best player. A four-star recruit, McLaurin started receiving scholarship offers his junior year \u2014 with Purdue and Indiana among schools interested.\n\nBut it was Ohio State that interested McLaurin. The problem? The Buckeyes weren\u2019t fully ready to commit to him, not initially anyway.\n\nAs a junior in high school, McLaurin went to one of Ohio State\u2019s summer camps in hopes of reeling in an offer. Out of the hundreds of prospects in attendance, McLaurin dazzled with the camp\u2019s fastest 40-yard time. Yet when he met with coach Urban Meyer, McLaurin didn\u2019t receive a scholarship. Instead he left with a challenge.\n\nImpressed with McLaurin\u2019s intangibles, Meyer told McLaurin he needed to improve his hands. He told McLaurin to take the next three weeks \u2014 until Ohio State had another camp \u2014 to catch 200 balls a day and come back to him.\n\nSo for two hours per day, McLaurin used the jugs machine to haul in as many passes as he could. He also had his receivers coach, mother, father and sister throw passes until his hands were tired.\n\nBy the time McLaurin returned, Meyer had seen enough \u2014 offering him a scholarship at the end of camp.\n\n\u201cThere is nobody on the field that\u2019s going to outwork him,\u201d Streiff said. \u201cWhen you talk about lead-by-example, there\u2019s nobody that\u2019s going to challenge his work ethic. Nobody.\u201d\n\nFast track\n\nChris Thompson has been in the NFL since 2013, and in that time, the running back said he\u2019s never seen a rookie treated the way the coaching staff handled McLaurin this preseason.\n\nMcLaurin played a grand total of one snap across four games. With McLaurin nursing a minor injury in the third preseason game, the Redskins even kept the wideout sidelined. It was an indication of how far McLaurin had come in camp \u2014 and how important the Redskins planned on him being to the upcoming season.\n\n\u201cJay knew what he had,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cWe all knew what Terry was.\u201d\n\nAgainst the Eagles, McLaurin demonstrated why he was the Redskins\u2019 worst-kept secret. McLaurin\u2019s 125 receiving yards were the third-most from a Redskin since 2016. In one game, McLaurin had more yards in an outing than former first-rounder Josh Doctson individually did in three seasons.\n\nAccording to Sharp Football Analysis, McLaurin ran 40 different routes for Washington and led the team in air yards, a statistic that tracks the total distance between where the ball is thrown and the reception.\n\nThose stats, in particular, signify McLaurin\u2019s versatility. McLaurin, who ran a 4.35 40-yard dash at the combine, can combine his blazing speed with precise route running. It\u2019s desperately needed for an offense that struggled to pass in 2018.\n\nMcLaurin, meanwhile, isn\u2019t surprised by his success. He said he tries to do whatever the coaches ask.\n\nThe 23-year-old, too, set his goals higher than to just contribute on special teams. He wanted to be a starter.\n\n\u201cI felt like I had that type of skill set,\u201d he said. \u201cI may not have been able to showcase it at Ohio State, but I feel like I had that type of confidence. I didn\u2019t necessarily think it was going to happen that fast, but I was preparing for it to happen.\u201d\n\nBeing ready\n\nBrian Hartline gave McLaurin advice.\n\nHaving played seven seasons in the NFL, the Ohio State receivers coach observed countless players who didn\u2019t take full advantage of their opportunity. He knew there were players with off-the-charts attributes, similar to McLaurin\u2018s, who didn\u2019t \u201cmaximize\u201d their chance.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m telling you what, the quickest way to get off the field is by making mistakes,\u201d Hartline said he told McLaurin. \u201cIt\u2019s really, really hard to get a player off the field that doesn\u2019t make mistakes.\u201d\n\nMcLaurin accepted the challenge, just as he\u2019s always done throughout his life.\n\nAt Ohio State, McLaurin\u2019s actual play could go overlooked. He finished his senior season with just 35 catches for 701 yards. The Buckeyes had other big-name receivers \u2014 Parris Campbell, K.J. Hill and Binjimen Victor \u2014 that drew more attention.\n\nBut within the Buckeyes\u2019 locker room, McLaurin was held in high regard. A two-time captain, McLaurin led by example. Hartline said his player asked the right questions, quickly learned from his mistakes and set the tone for others.\n\nThe Redskins drafted McLaurin partially for that reason.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about Terry,\u201d Hilliard said. \u201cYou can see the way he goes about his business. The way he carries himself. How he speaks in front of a camera. He gets it. Hopefully, we can corral that and spread it around to the rest of the team and get a bunch of guys here that really love and care about the game and hopefully play well for each other.\u201d\n\nWashington and McLaurin both understand the receiver will need to build off his performance in Philadelphia.\n\nMcLaurin wants his play to excel, so he can finally earn his \u201cjust due.\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes you may feel like you\u2019re putting in the work and you may not necessarily be given the things you may expect. Obviously every receiver wants to get 1,000 yards and all these things, All-American. I kind of got comfortable doing whatever the team asked me to do at Ohio State, through high school and things like that.\n\n\u201cBeing ready when my number is called is another thing I\u2019ve really always lived by. If you seize one opportunity, more opportunities come.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
