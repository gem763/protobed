Their unique strategies will determine who gets that shot", "language": "en", "text": "Each of the five leading 2020 Democratic candidates can beat the president in a general election, according to the latest national match-up polls. But first, they will need to secure the party\u2019s nomination in a hotly contested primary season that started with more than two dozen hopefuls. They're each using very different tactics to do so.\n\nThose five candidates \u2014 Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris and Pete Buttigieg \u2014 joined each other on Thursday night for the third Democratic debates, along with five additional candidates currently polling beneath them: Cory Booker, Andrew Yang, Amy Klobuchar, Beto O\u2019Rourke and Julian Castro.\n\nThe debate marked the first time Americans saw all of the top Democrats on stage at once, discussing everything from climate change to gun control policy in a three-hour display credited with tackling a range of issues. For the most part the candidates were virtually in agreement with their visions for the future of the country, albeit with different plans and initiatives to effect change.\n\nEach candidate said they wanted to expand health insurance to the vast majority of Americans, for example, but Mr Biden and Ms Harris expressed support for a public option while Mr Sanders and Ms Warren took on a Medicare-for-All stance (Mr Buttigieg falls somewhere in between with a \u201cMedicare-for-All who want it\u201d plan, as he described it). Reducing carbon emissions, lowering prescription drug prices, achieving universal access to a quality education, ending the president\u2019s trade wars: these are all staples of every Democratic presidential platform.\n\nWhat separates the men and women vying for a shot at unseating Mr Trump in the Oval Office are not their policy proposals so much as their campaigning strategies, a fact that became increasingly clear during Thursday night\u2019s debate.\n\nMr Biden, a centrist statesman who stood centre-stage in between his two most progressive opponents, delivered sharp responses to their liberal policy ideas and reminded voters of his work under former President Barack Obama.\n\n\u201cI stand with Barack Obama all eight years, good, bad and indifferent,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile Mr Sanders, the Vermont senator who came somewhat close to beating out Hillary Clinton for the 2016 Democratic nomination, slammed the former vice president on several occasions, saying he was responsible for millions of Americans who went bankrupt due to medical bills under the Obama administration.\n\nHe was given a helping hand from Mr Castro, a Texas Democrat who previously served in Mr Obama\u2019s administration as well, who attacked Mr Biden and insinuated at one point the 76-year-old was forgetting key parts of his health care policy.\n\nInstead of attacking her fellow Democrats or shooting down centrist opinions, Ms Warren shared her personal story with voters and made the case for robust liberal reforms in order to rebuild America\u2019s middle class.\n\nShe described raising a family after becoming a teacher and then going on to study law as she explained the need to significantly reduce student loan debt nationwide.\n\nhttp://players.brightcove.net/624246174001/default_default/index.html?videoId=6085813017001\n\nDemocratic debate: who are the candidates\n\n\u201cI think I'm the only person on this stage who has been a public school teacher,\" she said.\n\nMr Biden at one point attempted to showcase the difference between himself and Ms Warren when he said: \u201cThe senator says she's for Bernie. Well, I'm for Barack.\u201d Ms Warren later credited the former president, saying: \u201cWe all owe a huge debt to President Obama, who fundamentally transformed health care in America.\u201d\n\nMr Buttigieg delivered a personal touch, recalling his military experience when discussing the need to end \u201cforever wars\u201d in Afghanistan and elsewhere.\n\nThe openly-gay mayor of South Bend, Indiana discussed his coming out story on the debate stage \u2014 a move that would have been considered unthinkable just a few years ago \u2014 and how his sexuality factored into his political life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You know, as a military officer serving under Don't Ask Don't Tell and as an elected official in the state of Indiana when Mike Pence was governor, at a certain point, when it came to professional setbacks, I had to acknowledge whether just being who I was, was going to be the ultimate career ending professional setback,\" He said. \u201cI came back from the deployment and realised that you only get to live one life and I was not interested in not knowing what it was like to be in love any longer.\u201d", "description": "Each of the five leading 2020 Democratic candidates can beat the president in a general election, according to the latest national match-up polls.
