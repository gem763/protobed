He needs 45% support to avoid a runoff vote on Nov. 24.\n\nMacri was elected president in 2015 as Argentines rejected a successor chosen by ex-President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez. But the divisive former leader is now seeking a return to high office as vice president on the Peronist ticket with Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez.\n\nSunday\u2019s largely peaceful election was dominated by concerns over rising poverty, a sharp depreciation of the currency and one of the world\u2019s highest inflation rates.\n\nAs soon as the polls closed Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez embraced his girlfriend as friends clapped around him. He then greeted sympathizers who gathered outside the gate of his apartment chanting: \u201cAlberto presidente!\u201d Hundreds more are waving sky-blue and white Argentine flags outside his campaign headquarters.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so happy. We were waiting for this change for a long time. We\u2019re tired of everything that has been happening,\u201d said Juan Jose De Antonio, 46, as other supporters crowded an outdoor stage where Fern\u00e1ndez was expected to appear.\n\n\u201cSome of us live a different reality from those suffering hunger, but when you have a friend who lost a job, a neighbor who can\u2019t make ends meet, it hits you.\u201d\n\nIf the result stands, it would mark a sharp political turn in South America, which has seen conservative governments elected in Brazil, Colombia and Chile in recent years. Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez was considered part of the \u201cpink tide\u201d of leftist governments that arose in the region in the 1990s and 2000s.\n\nNow the region is being rocked by unrest in Chile, Bolivia, Peru and Ecuador fueled by discontent over corruption, inequality and slowing growth.\n\n\u201cWe Argentines deserve a better country, with work, where we can live peacefully, above all,\u201d said Antonella Bruna, 32, as she voted at the medical school of the National University of Rosario, about 180 miles northwest of Buenos Aires.\n\nMacri retains wide support among the key farming sector in one of the world\u2019s top suppliers of grains. But overall frustration over the economy has eroded the popularity of the pro-business former mayor of Buenos Aires. It has also propelled the candidacy of Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez, whose surge has sent jitters in the financial markets over a possible return to interventionist polices of Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s 2007-2015 administration.\n\nMacri\u2019s camp has tried to capitalize on that unease, portraying her as a puppet master waiting in the wings. But the presidential candidate has dismissed those fears and voters gave him a decisive victory over Macri in August primaries, which are a barometer of support for candidates ahead of the presidential election.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see a conflict there,\u201d Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez said recently in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cArgentina\u2019s problem is not Cristina. It\u2019s what Macri has left behind.\u201d\n\nFern\u00e1ndez served as chief of staff from 2003 to 2007 for Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s predecessor and late husband, N\u00e9stor Kirchner. He remained in the position during part of her term as president but left after a conflict with farmers in 2008.\n\nPeronism is a broad but splintered political movement in the South American country of 44 million people.\n\nOn the election trail, Fern\u00e1ndez has criticized Macri\u2019s decision to seek a record $56 billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund, a deeply unpopular institution in Argentina that is blamed for creating the conditions that led to the country\u2019s worst economic meltdown in 2001.\n\nMacri is credited with returning Argentina to international global markets following a break after the 2001 crisis and with helping strike a free trade deal between South America\u2019s Mercosur bloc and the European Union amid global trade tensions and rising protectionism. But he failed to deliver on promises to jumpstart the economy of the recession-hit country, while Argentines continue to lose purchasing power to an inflation rate of more than 55 percent and about a third have been plunged under the poverty line.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Macri has pleaded for more time to reverse fortunes and reminds voters of the corruption cases facing Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez, who has denied any wrongdoing and remains a powerful if divisive figure in Argentina.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important so we don\u2019t go back to the time of the Kirchners, when there was so much robbery, so much embezzlement. That wouldn\u2019t be good for the country,\u201d said Bernarda Nidia Guichandut, who helped her elderly parents into a car to go to vote. \u201cMacri is honest. He\u2019s made mistakes, he\u2019s backtracked, but he\u2019s said: \u201cFine, I was wrong.\u2019\u201d\n\nFor the most part, the election atmosphere was calm and turnout large, though the Buenos Aires Province police department said more than 1,000 people were evacuated following 11 reports of bomb threats to schools that were being used as polling stations. No explosives were found.\n\nTo avoid a runoff on Nov. 24, a candidate needs to win 45% of the vote, or 40% support with a 10 percentage point lead over the nearest rival. Nearly all recent surveys give Fern\u00e1ndez more than 50% support, which would guarantee his outright victory in a first round.\n\nArgentines are also choosing 130 lower house seats and 24 senators in Congress, as well as regional mayors, governors for three provinces and the head of government for the Argentine capital.", "description": "Center-left Peronist candidate Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez was leading Argentina\u2019s presidential election Sunday, according to partial official results, as frustrated...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HU080_argent_ZG_20191027204715.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
