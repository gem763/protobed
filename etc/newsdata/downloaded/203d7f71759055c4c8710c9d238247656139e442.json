For example, when he intended to visit SA, there was usually a spike in cyber espionage targeting groups related to the visit.\n\nLegislation\n\nVan Niekerk used Mauritius as an example of an African country doing well in terms of attempting to use legislation and the building up of a good IT base to address cyber crime.\n\nAs for SA\u2019s proposed Cybercrimes and Cybersecurity Bill, Van Niekerk said the process of finalising it appeared to be slow.\n\n\"When compared to other African countries, SA seems strong in terms of its capability to deal with the issue of cyber crime, but in a global context it appears weak,\" said Van Niekerk.\n\n\"SA needs clear policy statements on cyber crime, signalling our intent in dealing with it. SA must be clear on how it will respond to suspected network intrusions.\"", "description": "Concerns about cyber-crime being a huge problem in Africa and also in the BRICS countries have been tabled numerous times, but have not resulted in decisive action, the International Conference on Cyber Warfare and Security heard.", "authors": ["Carin Smith"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/1854/9316c722b3fd4de79ae017243589b2d7.jpg", "published_at": "2019-03-02"}
