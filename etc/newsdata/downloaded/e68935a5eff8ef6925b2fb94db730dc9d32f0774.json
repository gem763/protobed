Thousands of residents have been evacuated and Gov. Gavin Newsom has declared a state of emergency. The Reagan Presidential Library is currently at risk of being torched, and the high winds are making containment of the blaze difficult (via WSJ):\n\nStrong winds are expected to continue in Southern California, complicating efforts to contain a new 1,300-acre blaze, as the threat of even more wildfires rattles a state already on edge. Firefighters on Wednesday were fighting a fast-spreading brush fire in the Simi Valley area, northwest of Los Angeles. The Easy Fire burned the hillside around the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and prompted mandatory evacuations in the immediate area. Sparked just after 6 a.m. local time, the blaze grew to over 1,000 acres within four hours amid gusty winds and dry conditions, threatening around 7,000 homes. \u201cIt was about the worst time it could happen,\u201d Ventura County Fire Chief Mark Lorenzen said of the strong winds at the time the fire began. \u201cUnfortunately for us, the winds are going to continue for another 24 hours.\u201d\n\nWith presidential history at stake, in addition to people\u2019s lives, homes, and livelihoods\u2014CNN contributor Keith Boykin, a frequent Trump critic and former Obama aide, decided to tweet, \"for those who think God punishes sinners with natural disasters,\" linking to a Fox News story about the wildfire closing in on the library.\n\nThe Left hates Reagan, so you\u2019d imagine the response he received. Yes, the intolerant Left, the classless Left, and petulant Left were on full display here. Yet, Boykin insisted that this wasn\u2019t his intention.\n\nEarlier today, I posted a tweet to make the point that God does not punish people with natural disasters. Unfortunately, many people interpreted my tweet to say the exact opposite. To clear up any confusion, I have deleted the tweet. \u2014 Keith Boykin (@keithboykin) October 30, 2019\n\n\u201cEarlier today, I posted a tweet to make the point that God does not punish people with natural disasters,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cUnfortunately, many people interpreted my tweet to say the exact opposite.

Hey, right now, I\u2019m more concerned about the wildfires, containing them, and specifically hoping first responders can keep the inferno from engulfing the Reagan Library. At the same time, this isn\u2019t the first time Boykin has tripped over himself by tweeting something awful (via Washington Times):", "description": ".10/30/2019 19:16:37PM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa", "Katie Pavlich", "Julio Rosas", "Bronson Stocking"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/303/36465a6f-3c2f-4487-8fab-f0721a70e18c.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
