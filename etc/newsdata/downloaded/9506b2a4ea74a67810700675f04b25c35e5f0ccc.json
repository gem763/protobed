Mystery pregnancy cards sent to women across US", "language": "en", "text": "Women throughout the United States came home this week to letters from a mysterious \u201cJenny B\u201d from Utah. The letters were all nearly identical, congratulatory in nature, and otherwise unexceptional \u2014 besides the fact that they would soon entwine each recipient in a nationwide mystery.\n\nJenny B was celebrating the women\u2019s pregnancies with her letters, and gifting them nearly $250 (\u00a3194) worth of gift cards to buy some new swag for their babies.\n\nBut there was just one problem: many of the women who received the cards said they were not pregnant \u2014 and had never met a Jenny B from Utah.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe surprise mail came in the form of a card, the type you would see at any chain convenience store. A cartoon avocado can be seen on the cover with a heart planted on its chest, its imaginary legs crossed and arms up on its hips.\n\n\u201cHoly guacamole!\u201d it reads, \u201cYou\u2019re going to avo baby!\u201d\n\nThe letters were sent to countless women across the country this week.\n\nJulia Hellman, one of the women who received the card, told The Independent \u201cit's very disturbing that they had my address.\u201d\n\nShe said she \u201cknew it was some sort of scam\u201d so she \u201cwas not even going to try and use the gift cards, but the fact that there were, like, hand cut coupons made it seem more real.\u201d\n\nMs Hellman said she received a handwritten letter that read: \u201cCongratulations!!! I\u2019m so excited for you! I hope you like these.\u201d The card featured a heart sign and a signature that read: \u201cJenny B\u201d.\n\nYoung girls and women in the US described the cards as alarming. Receipts that came with the letters totalled $245 (\u00a3190). Several women told The Independent the letters had been sent to their mothers, who opened the cards and called their daughters, some fearing they were unexpectedly pregnant.\n\n\u201cThey sent it to my parents\u2019 house, so I had to do damage control with my mom,\u201d author AP Hawkins told The Independent after she posted a Twitter thread about receiving one of the cards. \u201cIt took some convincing to get her to believe me that this wasn't my weird way of telling her I was pregnant.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cWhile it may not be a scam in that the coupons might be real, it still strikes me as somewhat predatory. If it were just, \u2018Hey possible soon to be parent, here's some coupons!\u2019, I don't think anyone would react to finding it in their mailbox. But instead it's, \u2018Hey friend who is definitely pregnant, here's $250 in gift cards that I bought for you, shop with these companies!\u2019\"\n\nAlexis Cruz, who lives in California but said her parents received the mystery letter in Massachusetts, said her mom called \u201cthinking maybe it was a wedding invitation or something\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little strange that they would have my parents\u2019 address for me, and I\u2019m also curious how they got my name and address in the first place,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if this really is some marketing promotional ploy, it seems like it wasn\u2019t executed very well since the majority of people writing about it, including myself, aren\u2019t even pregnant.\u201d\n\nThere was clearly something much deeper going on with the cards than a woman named \"Jenny B\" who just happened to have countless friends with new pregnancies that decided to purchase various gift cards in celebration. Instead, it appeared a private company was behind the mass mailing campaign in an effort to promote several of its brands geared towards moms.\n\nMother\u2019s Lounge is a company that sells \u201cdarling car seat accessories\u201d that are \u201cendorsed all over Instagram,\u201d according to its website.\n\nAnother website promoting one of Mother Lounge\u2019s brands called \u201cCanopy Couture,\u201d said the product \u201cis one of the many creations of Jenny Bosco in Pleasant Grove, Utah.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlthough Jenny is currently a full time at-home mother of five children, she's known to spend 40 hours or more per week working on or improving her many Mothers Lounge brands,\u201d the site reads.\n\nThe company was behind a similar mass marketing campaign that sent nearly identical letters in February, according to a statement issued by the Surry County Sheriff\u2019s Office in Virginia. The statement said officials spoke with Ben Pierce, the general manager for Mother\u2019s Lounge, and determined the letters were sent by someone named Jeanette Pierce. The mailing campaign \u201cdoes not appear to be a scam,\u201d the sheriff\u2019s office concluded at the time.\n\nThe Independent could not find anyone named Jenny Bosco or Jeanette Pierce associated with Mother\u2019s Lounge on LinkedIn. However, a profile for a Jennifer Pierce in Pleasant Grove, Utah says she is a marketing coordinator at Mother\u2019s Lounge, LLC. One of Ms Pierce\u2019s listed responsibilities is to \"expand marketing campaigns and increase reach\".\n\nAround the time the Virginia sheriff\u2019s office cleared the mailing campaign in February, the Better Business Bureau saw an increase in online complaints against Mother\u2019s Lounge reviewed by The Independent. The complaints alleged the company was \u201ctargeting pregnant women with \u2018gift cards\u2019 in the mail.\u201d\n\nOne complaint said \u201cgift cards\u201d were sent from someone apparently named \u201cJen\u201d to the following companies: Eskimo Kids, Little Wanderers, Canopy Couture and Udder Covers.\n\nThe Better Business Bureau said it contacted Mother\u2019s Lounge earlier this year \u201crequesting modification or discontinuation of certain practices of the company,\u201d including sending out the \u201cgift cards,\u201d saying the bureau believed this strategy was \u201cquestionable\u201d.\n\nIt also requested the company stopped a practice of increasing shipping fees from free to $11.97 (\u00a39.27) when using one of the gift cards it provides, as well as to add a return name and address on its envelopes.\n\nSome of those companies were the same featured on coupons sent this week to seemingly random recipients \u2014 including some men. What's more, all of the various coupons appeared to trace back to brands owned by Mother\u2019s Lounge.\n\nA phone number for Mother\u2019s Lounge had a voicemail that said it was for a company called Carseat Canopy. A search for carseatcanopy.com led to a website selling products called \u201ccanopy couture,\u201d matching the name of the company mentioned in the Better Business Bureau complaint.\n\nWhen we told a customer service agent on a live chat messaging system that I had received a card from \u201cJenny B,\u201d the agent replied: \u201cThose were sent by our head of marketing, Jenny B. She sent them out to a few people. If you are unable to use them, please feel free to give them to someone who can!\u201d\n\nThe connections continued further. When trying to purchase wholesale items on EskimoKids.com, the site suddenly links to Mother\u2019s Lounge, LLC.\n\nOn the About Us page for LittleWanderers.com, the site says it was created by \u201cJenny Bosco in Pleasant Grove, Utah.\u201d\n\nAnother coupon was for Custom Pacifiers, a limited liability company distributed by Mother's Lounge, according to its website.\n\nIf Jenny B, who appears to be Jenny Bosco, is in fact the head of marketing for Mother's Lounge as the agent said, that still doesn't explain how the company selected recipients of the letters for its apparent mass marketing campaign.\n\nScott Anderson, who is identified on his LinkedIn as the director of marketing for Mother\u2019s Lounge, did not respond to requests for comment on Wednesday. Phone calls made to a number listed for the marketing director were also left unanswered.\n\nOne Reddit user by the name \"Becca Book\" said she spoke with an agent as well, who wrote in a message that \"Jenny was given a list by a third party of expectant mothers\".\n\nA February post on WhatToExpect.com, a website for expecting mothers, said the writer had received one of the cards and \"almost fell for this scam but luckily sniffed it out\".\n\n\u201cIt kind of looks legit. And who doesn\u2019t have one or multiple Jens in their life?!\u201d the post said.\n\nIt continued: \u201cHowever when you go to the online stores, they have very slim inventory of overpriced products that may actually look appealing. A weird thing you notice quickly is that all of the websites look kind of the same and you may only use a gift card OR promo code, and the gift card does not apply toward shipping. The shipping fees are ridiculous! $13-22 (\u00a310-17) for basic shipping.\u201d\n\nMother's Lounge did not respond to numerous requests for comment.\n\nJennifer Bolton, a public information officer for the Utah Department of Commerce, pointed consumers who wished to file a complaint to an agency site.\n\n\u201cI can neither confirm nor deny whether the Division has received any complaints involving Mother\u2019s Lounge,\u201d read a statement sent to The Independent by David Pierson, a records officer for the Utah Division of Consumer Protection. The division cited Utah codes on protected records as to why it was unable to provide confirmation about complaints against Mother\u2019s Lounge.\n\nRecipients of the letters said they were worried about what implications it could have for other women who opened the cards believing they had just received gift cards for soon-to-be mothers.\n\n\u201cFor a financially struggling parent to get that letter and think it's real only to go shopping and realise it isn't would be a crushing blow,\u201d Ms Hawkins said. \u201cNot to mention people struggling with infertility. So it's definitely a terrible and weird marketing choice, at best.\u201d", "description": "Women throughout the United States came home this week\u00a0to letters from a mysterious \u201cJenny B\u201d from\u00a0Utah.
