It\u2019s in Our Hands (2002)\n\nAn overlooked gem, tacked on to the end of her fan-selected Greatest Hits collection, It\u2019s in Our Hands is a sublime slice of future R&B conjured up in collaboration with the avant-techno duo Matmos. There is a particularly spicy and formidable version included on the Vespertine Live album.\n\n19. Quicksand (2015)\n\nVulnicura at its most agitated; the arrangement would be beautiful if it weren\u2019t for the fact that it is allied to sudden sampled vocal interjections and a furious barrage of post-drum\u2019n\u2019bass rhythms that seem to stop, start and shift randomly. Bj\u00f6rk sounds as if she is barely keeping her emotions under control. Tough but powerful listening.\n\n18. Triumph of a Heart (2005)\n\nThe perfect example of Medulla\u2019s ability to conjure up magic from unlikely ingredients, Triumph of a Heart is built around a cacophony of rhythmic voices, recalling human beatboxing and the vocal representations of Indian percussion on Sheila Chandra\u2019s Speaking in Tongues. It gradually builds momentum until it sounds unstoppable; the melody, meanwhile, is gleeful.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Already electrifying \u2026 Bj\u00f6rk in 1995. Photograph: Jane Bown/The Observer\n\n17. Play Dead (1993)\n\nBj\u00f6rk\u2019s first two albums often feel like scrapbooks of musical ideas floating around the non-Britpop 90s: house, trip-hop, the Chemical Brothers\u2019 distorted breaks, Aphex-y electronica. Co-written with the Bond composer David Arnold and Jah Wobble, Play Dead keys into the era\u2019s revival of interest in soundtracks and easy listening, but never sounds like a pastiche: the song is too dramatic and powerful.\n\n16. Army of Me (1995)\n\nThe opening track of Post was, apparently, the sound of Bj\u00f6rk telling her brother to buck his ideas up. But Army of Me also works as a ferocious statement of individual artistic intent (\u201cSelf-sufficiency, please! / And get to work\u201d) bedecked with John Bonham drums and dirty synthesiser. Either way, it sounds electrifying.\n\n15. Earth Intruders (2007)\n\nBj\u00f6rk has always had great taste when it comes to collaborators \u2013 never more so than on Earth Intruders, which pitches the hip-hop auteur Timbaland against the Congolese \u201call-powerful likembe orchestra\u201d Konono No 1 to startling effect. It is a fizzing, electrifying blast of beats and distorted thumb-piano that embodies the lyrics: \u201cmetallic carnage ferocity\u201d.\n\n14. Venus As a Boy (1993)\n\nApparently Bj\u00f6rk\u2019s most-covered song \u2013 something like 30 different versions exist \u2013 Venus As a Boy sounds utterly lovestruck: \u201cHis wicked sense of humour / Suggests exciting sex\u201d. Its infectiously giddy mood is potentiated by the sound of an Indian orchestra, recorded in Mumbai by Talvin Singh.\n\n13. Pagan Poetry (2001)\n\nBj\u00f6rk\u2019s original concept for Vespertine involved having \u201cicy\u201d-sounding musical boxes specially made. You can hear the results fluttering alongside a harp on Pagan Poetry, a track that starts out being serene and chilled, and gradually works up a striking erotic charge as it goes. The moment when everything dies away except Bj\u00f6rk singing \u201cI love him\u201d is among the most powerful in her catalogue.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Oscars dress that everyone remembers \u2026 Photograph: Rex\n\n12. Arisen My Senses (2017)\n\nOn one level, Arisen My Senses sounds like chaos: crashing rhythms and overlapping voices that render the lyrics largely incomprehensible, alongside unpredictable scatterings of harp and explosions of electronics. As a musical representation of the dizziness of new love, however, it is perfect.\n\n11. I\u2019ve Seen It All (2000)\n\nThe problem with pretending to lay an egg on the Oscars red carpet is that it will overshadow the song you are there to perform: more people know about Bj\u00f6rk\u2019s swan dress than Selmasongs\u2019 centrepiece I\u2019ve Seen It All, a disturbing, dark duet with Thom Yorke. Its luscious, swirling strings are underpinned by a train-track rhythm and its eerie mood is hard to shake.\n\n10. Cosmogony (2011)\n\nBj\u00f6rk\u2019s later albums are conceptual pieces that invariably work better as a whole: something is lost by removing individual songs from their context. That said, the sense of wonder that informs Biophilia\u2019s scientific explorations is perfectly summarised by Cosmogony\u2019s sighing array of electronics, brass and wordless voices, her wide-eyed vocal and its almost showtune-like chorus.\n\n9. Stonemilker (2015)\n\nBj\u00f6rk\u2019s divorce album, Vulnicura, is frequently demanding \u2013 but rewarding \u2013 listening, the sound reflecting the raw emotions it deals with. But Stonemilker\u2019s music is at odds with its lyrical despondency: Arca\u2019s echoing beats nestling beneath a beautiful string arrangement, with the intensity of her vocal married to an exquisite melody.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest All Is Full of Love.\n\n8. All Is Full of Love (1997)\n\nIts Chris Cunningham-directed video attracted so much attention that the song behind it occasionally gets overlooked. But All Is Full of Love is utterly beautiful without any accompanying visuals: romantic, optimistic and drowsily erotic. A perfect sliver of electronic soul.\n\n7. Big Time Sensuality (1993)\n\nDebut offered two opposing views of early-90s dancefloor hedonism \u2013 the self-explanatory There\u2019s More to Life Than This v Big Time Sensuality\u2019s glorious, saucer-eyed paean to ecstasy: \u201cI know I\u2019m a bit too intimate / But something huge is coming up.\u201d The Fluke remix trumps the album version, setting her delirious growls to chugging electronics.\n\n6. Hidden Place (2001)\n\nIt says something about Bj\u00f6rk\u2019s gradual drift away from the mainstream that Hidden Place was Vespertine\u2019s lead single. It\u2019s a world away from the simple DayGlo pleasure of It\u2019s Oh So Quiet, but it\u2019s a stunning song: tentative new love wrapped in glitchy electronics and otherworldly choral vocals.\n\n5. Future Forever (2017)\n\nBj\u00f6rk described her most recent album Utopia as \u201cparadise\u201d compared with the \u201chell\u201d of its predecessor, Vulnicura. Nowhere was that clearer than on the gorgeous, sparse, dreamlike drift of Future Forever, where the airy soundscape supports a movingly optimistic lyric: \u201cImagine a future and be in it \u2026 the past is a loop, turn it off.\u201d\n\n4. Who Is It? (2004)\n\nThe lead single from Medulla, an album constructed almost entirely from vocals, hits a glorious sweet spot between experimentation and commerciality. The sound \u2013 a mass of occasionally discordant voices and beatboxing \u2013 is thrillingly alien and strange, but it resolves into a chorus that is both irresistible and pure pop.\n\n3. Declare Independence (2008)\n\nBj\u00f6rk isn\u2019t exactly known as a protest singer, but the distorted electronic punk of Declare Independence is a startling addition to the genre: originally inspired by Greenland and the Faroe Islands\u2019 relationship with Denmark, it is potent and nonspecific enough to apply to anything from #MeToo to Black Lives Matter to the Free Tibet movement: \u201cDon\u2019t let them do that to you!\u201d\n\n2. J\u00f3ga (1997)\n\nAn epic demonstration of Bj\u00f6rk\u2019s vocal abilities. A richly orchestrated, industrial-beat-driven examination of the intense emotions that lurk beneath close friendships, J\u00f3ga is a fabulous song that also feels remarkably ahead of the curve. The drop midway through seems to presage the rise of dubstep.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Hyperballad video\n\n1. Hyperballad (1995)\n\nBj\u00f6rk has made far more experimental and adventurous music than Hyperballad, a relatively straightforward track by her later standards. But whether she has ever written a better song is a different question. Its soaring chorus is the most life-affirming moment in her back catalogue, and the arrangement, which shifts from ambient electronics to cinematic strings, is beautifully done. The point almost exactly halfway through where its stuttering rhythm is replaced by a relentless four-to-the-floor house beat is the perfect example of how a simple idea, neatly applied, can take your breath away.\n\nThis article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.
