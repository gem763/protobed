(Well, at least the last stage for now.) It was considered a huge victory for the Fight for 15 crowd and, presumably, a big win for workers, particularly in the foodservice industry. So how has that been working out since then? As the New York Post reported this weekend, the law of unintended consequences has come roaring into play. They feature the story of one taco and tequila joint on the upper west side that\u2019s been doing a thriving business for a quarter of a century. But now it\u2019s all coming to an end, and they\u2019re far from the only restaurant feeling these effects.\n\nBig Apple restaurants are feeling the heat from minimum-wage hikes, cutting staff hours and even closing kitchens as they struggle to shoulder the extra payroll costs. Gabriela\u2019s Restaurant and Tequila Bar, a margarita and taco staple on the Upper West Side for the past 25 years, is closing at the end of September \u2014 and it has been a long, painful road downhill, according to its mom-and-pop owners. Since the $15-an-hour minimum wage hit New York City in December, Liz and Nat Milner say, they\u2019ve been forced to slash their full- and part-time staff to 45 people from 60. Quality has suffered, they admit, and customers have noticed: They\u2019re not coming in like they used to, and when they do, they\u2019re spending less.\n\nWhat happened to Gabriela\u2019s Restaurant and Tequila Bar is a sobering tale for the entire industry. If only somebody had warned the city that this was going to happen.\n\nOkay, that\u2019s a pretty bad joke. Everyone warned them it would happen, but they pushed through anyway to satisfy their liberal voter base. Gabriela\u2019s was a thriving business in an extremely competitive market. They obviously weren\u2019t paying a bunch of people to stand around and do nothing because they needed to keep labor costs down to remain ahead of their competitors. Laying off 25% of their labor force was obviously going to impact their ability to do business and it clearly did.\n\nNow they\u2019re shutting down. And they\u2019re not alone. Another restaurant in Harlem, employing more than 40 primarily minority workers, hasn\u2019t had to close yet but the effects are still being felt. The owner reports that she\u2019s had to cut back everyone\u2019s hours, raise prices and reduce the number of available menu options. All of that adds up to poorer service and fewer customers.\n\nIt\u2019s not just the loss of local watering holes and eateries that are the problem. All of the jobs they support are going away too. As of August, the restaurant industry in the Big Apple has shed a shocking 4,000 jobs this year. And as Gabriela\u2019s shows us, the pain isn\u2019t over yet.\n\nSo the remaining workers in many of these eateries are, on average, making more per hour than they used to. But many of them are getting fewer hours per week. And thousands of others are making zero in earned wages because they\u2019re on the unemployment lines. Is this really progress for workers? Or is it just a net benefit to the unions who are trying to organize them all?", "description": "If only someone had warned them...
