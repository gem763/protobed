Both invoked the will of the people and cast themselves as their protectors.\n\nMPs hope to force the prime minister to delay Brexit by changing the law to require him to seek an extension from Brussels if no exit deal has been agreed between the U.K. and the EU by next month's European Council meeting.\n\nIt is expected the government will put forward a motion calling for an election late Tuesday, with a vote Wednesday. This would need the backing of two thirds of MPs to trigger a snap election.\n\n\u201cThe prime minister has been very clear that should MPs tonight vote to trash the U.K.\u2019s negotiating position, hand power over to the opposition then the next logical step for the prime minister \u2014 which he doesn\u2019t want \u2014 would be via the Fixed Term Parliaments Act [to call] for an election and then the British public will decide who goes to Brussels to make that decision,\u201d a No. 10 spokesperson said.\n\nHowever, to clear the Commons vote Labour would need to back the motion and the party's position was unclear for much of the day. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has repeatedly called for an election, but now fears Johnson could set the national poll for a date later than the October 31 Brexit deadline, meaning the U.K. might quit the EU without a deal during the campaign.\n\nAs MPs debated, Labour's Shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry said the party would not vote for a general election before a no-deal Brexit has been taken off the table.\n\n\u201cThere won\u2019t be a general election tomorrow, because we\u2019re not going to vote for it, because we have to make sure this legislation is been embedded [and] signed off by the queen,\u201d Thornberry said.\n\n\u201cWe want a general election but we want to get this legislation done first,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s a question of getting the sequence right. First we stop no-deal, then Boris is going to send us all away and not let us come back for a while. But when we come back we will see what happens then.\u201d\n\nAt a meeting of Labour MPs and peers in the Palace of Westminster, chief whip Nick Brown said the party would not fall into a general election \u201ctrap,\u201d according to those who were in the room.\n\nLloyd Russell-Moyle MP said the meeting was about \u201cmaking sure that we don\u2019t fall into the elephant trap\u201d of allowing the prime minister to lead the country into a no-deal Brexit. He added: \u201cWe are dealing with some very dark forces.\u201d\n\nUK NATIONAL PARLIAMENT ELECTION POLL OF POLLS\n\nFor more polling data from across Europe visit POLITICO Poll of Polls.\n\nThis article is part of POLITICO\u2019s premium Brexit service for professionals: Brexit Pro.
