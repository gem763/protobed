The integrated BCH wallet will help HTC create a simple interface for crypto transactions and Bitcoin.com for a higher number of users, as reported by Venture Beat, September 16, 2019.\n\nControversial Move, But Faster Transactions\n\nA lot of people are going to be extremely unhappy that HTC has chosen to work with Bitcoin.com. A lot of Bitcoin advocates see Bitcoin.com as a \u201cbad actor\u201d in the space for promoting BCH over BTC.\n\nHowever, merchant adoption of BCH is an obvious merit that cannot be denied. With transaction fees around $0.01 and zero-confirmation transactions, which is safe for small amounts, BCH is gaining traction and living up to its motto of being peer to peer cash.\n\nHTCs Phil Chen believes that the Exodus vision was always supportive of public blockchains, and its core ideology rests in using crypto as money. Chen is happy to partner with Bitcoin.com to integrate BCH as a payment rail.\n\nThis is just the first step of the partnership. HTC plans to give discounts for those purchasing the phone with BCH, and Bitcoin.com plans to offer the phone for sale on its store.\n\nThe Battle for Bitcoin\n\nThe Bitcoin community is split into many parts today; from the singular BTC chain, we now have a ton of forks such as BCH and BSV which have gained traction.\n\nBCH is the strongest fork of the BTC chain and has been at the center of major controversies. Bitcoin.com has used deceptive marketing tactics to bring people toward BCH; this is completely unnecessary as BCH is a functioning chain with an array of benefits.\n\nThere are contradictions from both sides of the game. BTC proponents advocate for freedom and privacy, yet they shame people for using BCH. Bitcoin.com, led by major BCH supporter Roger Ver, markets BCH as the \u201creal Bitcoin\u201d and labels BTC as \u201cBitcoin Core\u201d.\n\nIf BCH lived up to libertarian values, they would simply state the features of both chains and allow the user to decide which one suits their need.\n\nOf course, BTC visibly dominates BCH as it is older, and the longest chain wins. However, this alone cannot erode the fact that BCH is growing stronger and has obvious merits (and demerits) when compared to BTC.", "description": "Mobile phone giant HTC has announced a partnership with Roger Ver led Bitcoin.com in order to create the capacity to store and transact with Bitcoin Cash (BCH) without an application.
