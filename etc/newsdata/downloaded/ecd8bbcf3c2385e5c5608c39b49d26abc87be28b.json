Supplied\n\n\"It will do things like interacting with large companies on our behalf \u2013 choosing our mortgage for us, paying our bills and maybe even calling our mums. We're going to hand over more and more decisions to it.\"\n\nShe added: \"What I'd like to see is the creation of a world in which AI runs our home with mindfulness and it's conscious of the planet, one that can be used in the building of another planet, and that's basically a mash-up of human science and AI.\"\n\nThe Morrison government has committed $150 million towards the development of new technology to support NASA's expeditions to the moon and Mars.\n\nAkin is Ms Yearsley's second AI start-up \u2013 IBM bought her first corporate voice-bot business, Cognea, in a multimillion-dollar deal in 2014.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe worked for IBM for a year before taking 12 months off because of a non-compete clause and then launched Akin with co-founder Travis Giggy, who had quit a start-up called Swing by Swing.\n\nIt was through her previous business that Ms Yearsley and JPL IT chief technology and innovation officer Tom Soderstrom became connected.\n\nFuture of AI in JPL\n\nAt its essence, JPL is a US national research facility and its job is to build and manage spacecraft and space instruments for NASA, run programs that seek to find life on other planets and to lead space-based astronomy and technological developments.\n\nMr Soderstrom said its personalised Rover tour guide would be able to shake and nod its head and engage with humans on a deeper level.\n\nBut this was just the beginning, he said, and in the coming years he hoped to use the AI to create a smart lab assistant for scientists, as well as a robot that could be deployed on long-duration space flights to not only help astronauts detect and manage problems in their environment but also be a companion to them during what can be a lonely period.\n\n\"In the lab, the robot will contain all the data and be able to answer questions, but it will also have a personal feel to it and be able to give advice,\" he said.\n\n\"On a long space flight, the assistant could then tell you if something is going wrong in the craft, or even better, say that the air filter was dirty but it had already cleaned it.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Soderstrom wants to have the personalised AI deployed in the Rover robot by Christmas.\n\nOther applications of the AI that JPL is developing include creating a fleet of robots to be deployed on Mars, which could complete tasks such as searching for water. The robots would be able to communicate with each other and join forces to generate more computing power.\n\nJPL is also working on creating an algorithm that would allow satellites to communicate with each other.\n\nWaves of technology\n\nLike Ms Yearsley, Mr Soderstrom believes humans will be surrounded by AI in the next decade, often not even realising it, thanks to the convergence of six \"waves\" of technology \u2013 cyber security challenges at scale, accelerated computing (things like cloud computing and quantum computing advances), software-defined everything (people get used to programming their environments), ubiquitous computing, applied AI (creation of AI that can be deployed in anything thanks to big tech companies like Amazon and Microsoft), and new technology habits, which will be driven by millennials.\n\n\"Everyone will have an intelligent assistant like Siri, but you'll be able to ask it bigger questions and have a conversation with it and use it at work. It'll start with things like Google Maps learning your behaviours and telling you that if you want to be home by 5pm, you need to leave now and take a certain route.\"\n\nAkin has already received financial backing from local fund Reinventure and Silicon Valley venture capital firm Comet Labs.\n\nMs Yearsley said her big goal was for it to become a $1 billion company and be able to demonstrate that it was possible to create something good for the world while being \"massively profitable\".\n\n\"I've built three fantastic companies that I'm proud of, but the most fun I had was when I was running an education franchise in Africa that was extremely profitable but also did enormous good and was changing lives every day,\" she said.\n\n\"But this is my life's work.\"", "description": "Liesl Yearsley is one of the pioneers of AI technology in Australia, having sold her first AI business to IBM in 2014.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5706%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_1426%2C$y_382/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/fc6493ecb35a40ca007ca483c19f09973113b134", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
