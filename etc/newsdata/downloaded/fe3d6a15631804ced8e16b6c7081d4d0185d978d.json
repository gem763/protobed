We\u2019ll create our own happiness.'\n\n'Even if it's just you and me' Pregnant MAFS star Cyrell Paule (pictured) shared a cryptic message on her Instagram page cradling her baby bump, appearing to confirm her split from Eden Dally\n\nShe finished off her post with the hashtags 'my little prince' and 'my one and only'.\n\nA representative for Cyrell confirmed the split when approached by Daily Mail Australia, while one for Eden is yet to comment.\n\nShortly after posting her baby bump photo, Cyrell took to Instagram once again to share an emotional message about the demise of her relationship.\n\n'You would think people would be happy to heart about my break-up' Cyrell took to Instagram later in the evening to share an emotional message about the demise of her relationship\n\nIt read: 'You would think people would be happy to heart about my break-up. Are you all not happy. Was this not what you all rooted and prayed for.\n\n'Or maybe your prayers of me having a miscarriage is what you're hoping for next. We live in a sad, bad world where we wish and pray for misery on others to feel better about ourselves.\n\n'I hope this shows a reflection of the weak, sad individual you are. I may not have a partner. But my son is all I need.'\n\nWhile the brunette bombshell dramatically removed all traces of her ex from her Instagram feed, Eden left images with his former partner firmly on his page.\n\n'Bring on tonight!' Eden Dally (pictured) revealed he was set to enjoy a night at a Halloween event on Friday night, just hours before Cyrell confirmed the split on Instagram\n\nAnd ignoring the drama, the former islander even revealed he is spending his evening at Sydney's biggest Halloween event at Luna Park.\n\n'Happy Friday bring on tonight! #halloween#lunapark,' he wrote, alongside a picture of himself smiling in a car.\n\nThe former couple only announced their baby news back in August, admitting that while the pregnancy 'wasn't planned', the couldn't wait to meet their little one.\n\nAll over? MAFS' Cyrell Paule (left) has hinted it could be all over for her and Love Island star boyfriend Eden Dally (right)\n\nCyrelle told New Idea she was stunned to discover she was pregnant, and tried four different at-home pregnancy tests before the reality of her situation finally sunk in.\n\nShe told Eden the news via text message. His initial response was shock and disbelief, but he eventually came around to the idea.\n\nWhile the pregnancy is cause for celebration, the couple expressed concerns that some people will dismiss their baby as a 'publicity stunt'.\n\nCause for concern: Cyrell also removed images with Eden from her Instagram page\n\nCyrell admitted the negativity has been 'sad' and 'exhausting', adding: 'I wouldn't be surprised if my child is going to get called a publicity stunt.'\n\nEden echoed similar sentiments, saying: 'I guarantee people will say the baby is a publicity stunt. They'll say we got pregnant to stay relevant or to extend our 15 minutes of fame.'\n\nCyrell began dating Eden earlier this year, months after her 'marriage' to electrician Nic Jovanovic fell apart on MAFS.\n\nRemember them? Cyrell was paired with electrician Nic Jovanovic (left) on this year's season of MAFS. Unlike Eden and Erin, Cyrell remains on friendly terms with her ex-'husband'\n\nShe confirmed their relationship on an episode of Talking Married in April, following weeks of dating rumours.\n\n'He's a cool guy\u2026 we're seeing each other,' she said at the time, adding that it wasn't exactly love at first sight for the couple.\n\n'[Eden] is one of those guys who's so attractive that at first, I was like, \"no\". But then you talk, and it grows,' she said.\n\nBefore dating Cyrell, Eden was in a relationship with Erin Barnett, whom he met on the first season of Love Island Australia last year.", "description": "Married At First Sight star Cyrell Paule has hinted she's split with her Love Island boyfriend Eden Dally.", "authors": ["Nicole Douglas For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/09/20170674-0-image-a-8_1571990939299.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
