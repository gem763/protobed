Supporters\u2019 groups maintain the symbol represents opposition to fascism and persecution - a human rights issue, not a political stance.\n\nThe new league policy was adopted this season. But supporters\u2019 groups have challenged it by continuing to display the Iron Front symbol on flags and banners.\n\nThere have also been protests, with fans remaining silent for the first 33 minutes of a match between the Sounders and the Timbers. A number of supporters from both clubs have been issued warnings and a handful of Portland fans were banned for three games.\n\nThe meeting between the two sides on Thursday in Las Vegas did not produce a resolution, but a conference call was scheduled for Tuesday.\n\nMLS President and Deputy Commissioner Mark Abbott issued a statement that reaffirmed the league\u2019s \u201ccommitment to the values of inclusion and diversity, including opposition to racism, fascism and homophobia and to ensuring that there is no place for repugnant hate speech in MLS stadiums.\u201d\n\n\u201cDuring today\u2019s meeting, the league proposed a collaborative process for reviewing its Fan Code of Conduct in a way that is inclusive of a cross-section of industry experts and national advocacy groups along with the leaders of its supporter groups,\u201d Abbott said. \u201cThe goal is to have that process completed prior to the start of the 2020 season.\u201d\n\nHe also said the league would evaluate its treatment of the Iron Front flag for the remainder of the 2019 season.\n\nThe supporters\u2019 groups and the ISC released statements saying they looked forward to \u201ccontinuing the conversation\u201d on Tuesday.\n\nTimbers owner Merritt Paulson praised the efforts of the two sides to come together.\n\n\u201cWe have always been advocates for soccer supporters uniquely having a right to exercise their voice on matters of human rights at games,\u201d he said.\n\nThe league\u2019s new fan code of conduct, implemented this season, prohibits \u201cusing (including on any sign or other visible representation) political, threatening, abusive, insulting, offensive language and/or gestures, which includes racist, homophobic, xenophobic, sexist or otherwise inappropriate language or behavior.\u201d\n\nEarlier this season, a fan waving a Trump 2020 flag was removed from Providence Park.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Major League Soccer officials met Thursday with supporters' groups from the Seattle Sounders, the Portland Timbers and the Independent Supporters Council to discuss a new league policy that bans fan displays deemed as political.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Anne M.
