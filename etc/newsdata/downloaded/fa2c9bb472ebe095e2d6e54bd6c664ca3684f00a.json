The 70,762-square-mile state only has one legal abortion provider and women seeking the procedure must undergo a state-mandated 24-hour waiting period, according to data compiled by the Guttmacher Institute, an abortion rights research group. Minors in the state are required to notify their parents if they receive an abortion and the state limits the ways in which private insurance carriers cover the procedure, according to Guttmacher.\n\nEight states have passed laws requiring abortion providers to tell patients about alleged medication abortion reversal. Five of those laws were passed this year. Tuesday's ruling is the first time this year that a court has ruled against one of those regulations, according to the Center for Reproductive Rights, one of the legal groups involved in the case. A judge in Arizona struck down a similar law in 2016 and state lawmakers eventually repealed the law.\n\n\"We're seeing a trend across the country \u2014 anti-abortion politicians are trying to use doctors as mouthpieces for the state. But doctors have first amendment rights like everyone else,\" said Marc Hearron, senior counsel at the Center for Reproductive Rights, in an email sent to CBS News on Tuesday morning. \"They cannot be forced to lie to their patients.\"\n\nThe lawsuit also challenges a separate state law that requires physicians to tell patients that abortion terminates \"the life of a whole, separate, unique, living human being.\" That aspect of the lawsuit has not yet been addressed.", "description": "Doctors in North Dakota won't need to tell patients that \"it may be possible to reverse the effects of an abortion-inducing drug\"", "authors": ["Kate Smith"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/06/10/47dffd0a-279a-4a92-8a15-ffde456ada41/thumbnail/1200x630g2/3fbd5337182231540c2aa0f21ab015ad/34-north-dakota.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
