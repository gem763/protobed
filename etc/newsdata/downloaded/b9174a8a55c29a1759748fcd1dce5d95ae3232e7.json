He never got it!\u201d\n\nSince my election, many trillions of dollars of worth has been created for our Country, and the Stock Market is up over 50%.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 2, 2019\n\nNext, he turned his attention to labor unions.\n\n\u201cJust watched AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka on @FoxNews and thought to myself how different he is on TV than he is when he is with me at the White House,\" the president wrote. \"Likes what we are doing until the cameras go on. We got robbed on Trade and everything else while his Dems just sat back.... and watched. NAFTA is the worst Trade Deal ever made - terrible for labor - and Richard let it stand. No wonder unions are losing so much. The workers will vote for me in 2020 (lowest unemployment, most jobs ever), and should stop paying exorbitant $Dues, not worth it!\u201d\n\nJust watched AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka on @FoxNews and thought to myself how different he is on TV than he is when he is with me at the White House.

All I do is call them out for the horrible things they have said. The Democrats have become the Party of the Squad!\"\n\nThe Amazon Washington Post did a story that I brought racist attacks against the \u201cSquad.\u201d No, they brought racist attacks against our Nation.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 2, 2019\n\nTrump then turned to one of his usual targets: the media.\n\n\u201cThe LameStream Media has gone totally CRAZY!\" he said. \"They write whatever they want, seldom have sources (even though they say they do), never do \u201cfact checking\u201d anymore, and are only looking for the \u201ckill.\u201d They take good news and make it bad. They are now beyond Fake, they are Corrupt.. The good news is that we are winning. Our real opponent is not the Democrats, or the dwindling number of Republicans that lost their way and got left behind, our primary opponent is the Fake News Media. In the history of our Country, they have never been so bad!\"\n\nThe LameStream Media has gone totally CRAZY!
