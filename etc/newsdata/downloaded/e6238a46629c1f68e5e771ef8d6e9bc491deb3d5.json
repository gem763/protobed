As you have witnessed him saying, he is going to petition the SCA,\" said Tyali.\n\nTaking the matter to the SCA will mean that Daubermann has to solicit the services of another legal representative because he does not qualify to represent the accused there.\n\nGET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now.
