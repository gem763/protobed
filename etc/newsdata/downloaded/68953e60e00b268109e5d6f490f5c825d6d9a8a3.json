REUTERS/Tyrone Siu\n\nLam said Beijing wanted Hong Kong to solve its own problems, but under its mini-constitution, known as the Basic Law, Hong Kong could ask Beijing for help.\n\n\u201cIf the situation becomes so bad, then no options could be ruled out, if we want Hong Kong to at least have another chance,\u201d Lam said at weekly new conference after a long weekend of violence crippled the city.\n\n\u201cBut at this moment, I and my team, we are still very committed in making sure we can use our own instruments...to try and restore calm and order in Hong Kong,\u201d she said, adding there were no plans to expand emergency laws introduced on Friday.\n\n\u201cBut I would appeal (to) everyone in society to join hands to achieve this objective.\u201d\n\nThe protests, which show no sign of abating, pose the biggest popular challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012 and are Hong Kong\u2019s thorniest political crisis since Britain returned it to China in 1997.\n\nLam said protests were severely damaging Hong Kong\u2019s economy. \u201cHong Kong\u2019s various sectors will enter a severe winter season,\u201d she said.\n\nTens of thousands of protesters took to the streets of Hong Kong over the weekend wearing face masks, despite Lam having banned masks under colonial-era emergency laws invoked on Friday. Protesters have been using masks to shield their identities and to protect their faces from police tear gas.\n\nThe rallies spiralled into some of the most violent clashes since protests started four months ago, forcing the unprecedented shut down of the city\u2019s metro after many stations were torched and scores of shops and China banks damaged.\n\nECONOMY FACES \u2018SEVERE WINTER\u2019\n\nSunday night saw the first interaction between protesters and Chinese troops stationed in the territory, which have so far remained in barracks. Protesters targeted a military barracks with laser pointers prompting troops to hoist a banner warning them they could be arrested. Senior ranking People\u2019s Liberation Army officers have said violence will not be tolerated.\n\nHong Kong police said on Tuesday 77 people had been arrested for violating the anti-mask law. Since Friday, more than 200 shops and public utilities have been damaged in the unrest and police have fired 367 tear gas rounds, said a police spokesman.\n\nWhat started as opposition to a now-withdrawn extradition bill has grown into a pro-democracy movement against what is seen as Beijing\u2019s tightening grip on the city, which protesters say undermines a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula promised when Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule.\n\nChina dismisses such accusations, saying foreign governments, including Britain and the United States, have fanned anti-China sentiment.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday that if anything bad happened in Hong Kong it would be bad for the U.S.-China trade talks.\n\nChina\u2019s Oct. 1 National Day holiday week is normally a time when Hong Kong is flooded with visitors, but many shops were closed and tourist numbers plummeted, said Lam, warning the city\u2019s third quarter economic data would \u201csurely be very bad\u201d.\n\n\u201cFor the first six days of October, during the so-called Golden Week holiday, visitors visiting Hong Kong plunged over 50%,\u201d she said. Retail, catering, tourism and hotels had been hit hard, with some 600,000 people affected, she said.\n\nSlideshow (9 Images)\n\nThe territory is facing its first recession in a decade.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s metro, which carried some 5 million people daily, was only partially operating on Tuesday, scores of shops were closed and a tenth of ATMs were broken due to vandalism.\n\nLam appealed to property developers and landlords to offer relief to retailers whose businesses had been hit.", "description": "Hong Kong's embattled leader Carrie Lam on Tuesday did not rule out asking Beijing for help, as the Asian financial hub struggles to deal with months of often violent anti-government protests that are damaging its economy.", "authors": ["Clare Jim", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191008&t=2&i=1438353910&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF970E8", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
