This won't happen to Harrison, he said, because she will refuse to fight her opponent's fight and instead focus on her strengths.\n\nAs a sixth-degree black belt in judo and a two-time Olympic gold medalist, those strengths are clear. And she will look to utilize those in the sixth fight of her MMA career at the PFL 7 show in Las Vegas on October 11.\n\nHarrison was originally scheduled to face striker Genah Fabian. However, she faces a late replacement opponent, Bobbi-Jo Dalziel, after Fabian was pulled from the bout on Thursday because of a medical issue.\n\nDalziel, who has a kickboxing base style, poses another striking threat, and Couture is curious how Harrison handles being hit hard.\n\n\"Nobody's really come out and stunned Kayla with a really good shot yet, and it will be really interesting to see how she deals with that adversity and absorbs that adversity and responds,\" he said. \"I think she'll respond \u2026 it will trip her trigger like it does a lot of us that are in this fight game.\"\n\nBut Harrison won't make the same mistake as Rousey once did\n\nAs a former judo player and training partner of Ronda Rousey, there have been comparisons to the former UFC champion.\n\nRousey, Harrison previously told Business Insider, was wildly dominant through much of her MMA career, having defended the UFC women's bantamweight title six times before losing to Holly Holm in 2015, then Amanda Nunes in 2016.\n\nRonda Rousey.

The defeat to Nunes finished Rousey's career.\n\nRead more: A fighter being hailed as the next Ronda Rousey says the comparison is unfair because she's actually way better\n\nIn the years since Rousey's losses, Harrison emerged and has been hailed as the new Rousey. But Couture told us there are clear differences between the two.\n\n\"The difference is Ronda was very caught up in the hype,\" he said. \"Caught up in what her coach [Edmond Tarverdyan] was telling her.\"\n\nBefore the Holm fight at UFC 193 in Melbourne, Australia, Rousey had knocked out Bethe Correira. \"Coming off a knockout victory gave her a false sense of security in her ability to stand and strike with a world-class striker in Holly Holm.\n\n\"I don't see any of that in Kayla \u2026 Kayla knows where her strengths are,\" Couture said, adding Harrison will fight her fight, not her opponent's \u2014 something Rousey did and lost. \"That's the difference.\"\n\n\"I believe Ronda was poorly coached,\" Couture added. \"It gave her great kudos to her striking coach if she goes and knocks somebody out. And that's not what put her in the position she was in. It was going out and taking people down and submitting them. That's made her what she was.\n\n\"She strayed away from that. She let somebody talk her into striking and didn't give Holly Holm the credit that Holly Holm deserved as a multi-time world champion in striking in combative sports.\n\n\"I think if Ronda went out with the proper mentality and made Holly fight Ronda's fight, it would have been a different outcome. I don't see Kayla Harrison falling into that trap.\"\n\n'F--- perfection, be effective'\n\nHarrison recently told Business Insider about four words of advice she got from Couture earlier this year that have stayed with her today.\n\nAs a perfectionist, Harrison wanted to be as good at striking as she was at grappling. But backstage after one fight, even though she had won, she was angry. She felt like her striking was letting her down.\n\nBut then Couture told her four words \u2014 \"f--- perfection, be effective.\"\n\nRandy Couture. Photo by Michael Tran/FilmMagic\n\n\"I remember the discussion,\" Couture told us. \"She was being very critical of herself. I get she's a perfectionist and strives for perfection but my comment to her was, 'F--- perfection, be effective.'\n\n\"I admire the hunger and passion that she has for being the best at this and learning all the other skills that can go with that judo gold medal.\n\n\"She's willing to do the work, put herself out there, and that's what shows. That's why she's 5-0, and it's been fun to watch. If she keeps that perfection mindset in check, she'll be very effective and difficult to stop.\"\n\nShould Harrison defeat Dalziel at the PFL 7 show in Las Vegas on October 11, she'll fight for a $1 million paycheck in the final PFL Championship show in New York on Tuesday, December 31.\n\nIf the two favorites in each women's lightweight semifinal this weekend triumph, then it creates one of the most anticipated women's fights of the year \u2014 Harrison, the PFL poster-girl, against Sarah Kaufman, a former Strikeforce women's champion and PFL's current number one seed in the competition.\n\n\"It will be huge for the PFL,\" Couture said. \"They brought this women's division in solely for that hopeful eventuality that those two would make the final \u2026 it would be absolutely huge for the sport of mixed martial arts.\"", "description": "The former UFC champion Randy Couture, now commentator and analyst with the Professional Fighters League, had high praise for PFL star Kayla Harrison.", "authors": ["Alan Dawson"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9f58663b33a7434a719ceb?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
