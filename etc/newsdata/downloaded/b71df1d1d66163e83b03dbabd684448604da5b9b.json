In one, an angry man yelled: 'I'll take this baseball bat and beat your brains in!'\n\nAn upset woman screams: 'You're scaring little people that can't defend themselves.'\n\nWrinkles, who wears a melted and slightly demented looking white mask to hide his face, at one point claims in the documentary he is a an older white man, who lives in a rundown RV and doesn't like children.\n\nHe says he likes fishing, sits in hotel rooms in dirty, undershirts - and goes to strip clubs with his friend.\n\nBut it's unclear whether that really is the man behind the mask.\n\nScroll down for videos\n\nThe man behind 'Wrinkles the Clown' speaks out about his experience of creating a viral sensation in a new documentary - but refuses to unmask himself\n\nWhen he started around five years ago, he posted stickers with a picture of the creepy clown face and a phone number. He never expected to be barraged with angry phone calls\n\n'If people knew who was under the mask it would kind of ruin the experience,' said the creator of 'Wrinkles' who started the viral sensation around 2014.\n\n'For the most part I\u2019ve always been quiet, kind of shy, never been in performing arts and all of a sudden to turn on a switch and be a personality that wasn't myself - that was kind of funny, kind of rude, annoyed by children - I thought it was one of the biggest rushes of my life,' he explained.\n\nHe uploaded his first video to the YouTube channel 'HvUseen Wrinkles' in November of that year.\n\nThe clip showed a young girl asleep in her bed, as a clown crawled out of a draw directly beneath where she was sleeping. As he emerged, she appeared to stir but started to sleep once more. The clown then stood over her, kissed a teddy that he laid next to her and walked towards a camera before covering it with his hands.\n\nHe would go onto add several more clips to his channel and watched as copycats began dressing and trying to replicate his look, according to the doc.\n\nThe man condemned parents for contacting 'Wrinkles' in a bid to use him as a 'disciplinary tactic' to keep their children in line.\n\n'I think it\u2019s more cruel and unusual than anything Wrinkles has ever done or has ever claimed to do,' he said.\n\nHe maintains that not everyone hates him and that some children have actually called because they find the clown amusing.\n\nThe man said: 'As many people that hate Wrinkles and hope he dies a slow horrible death, there\u2019s a lot of people out there that love Wrinkles.\n\n'They love the character and they like the funny parts about him and they like he cynical parts that they can relate to.'\n\n'Wrinkles the Clown,' which was directed by Michael Beach Nichols, is out theaters and available to stream online on November 1.\n\nFootage of 'Wrinkles the Clown' hiding beneath a child's bed was posted online\n\nOther videos emerged, including one outside a family home where they were playing cards", "description": "The man behind the mask agreed to speak out in a documentary under the provision that his name was hidden, his face always pixelated and voice altered to avoid any chance of identification.", "authors": ["Josh Saunders For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/23/19306352-0-image-a-47_1570226663305.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
