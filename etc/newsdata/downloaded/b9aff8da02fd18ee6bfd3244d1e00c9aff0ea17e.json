For months, Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiBiden: Trump has 'indicted himself by his own statements' House Democrats subpoena White House for Ukraine documents House conservatives press Schiff over knowledge of whistleblower complaint MORE fought calls for impeachment, much to the consternation of members of her Democratic caucus, preferring to focus on bread and butter issues such as health care and immigration, which remain two of the top issues for voters going into 2020.\n\nInstead, Democrats are now focused on another Trump scandal and every hour of every day that they are focusing on this is time not spent focused on policies and showcasing how their plans differ from Republicans. Democratic candidates hoping to spend time talking about their policies are now forced to talk about impeachment, which does not benefit a pool of candidates still looking to one-up the other in hopes of becoming their presidential nominee.\n\nVoters want to know one simple thing: how will their lives and the lives of their families will continue to improve, voters on the campaign trail aren\u2019t asking about impeachment they\u2019re asking about issues. However, Democrats blind hatred for Donald Trump has them rushing, which they have already admitted as they hope to conclude their impeachment inquiry with a vote by the end of this year.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThey\u2019ll vote and then what? It will go to the Senate where the president will not be convicted. Christmas will come and before you know it, its January 2020 \u2014 30 days before the February 3, Iowa caucus where impeachment won\u2019t be on the minds of voters. It is all but clear that this process will begin and end where it started, in the House. Democrats will find themselves once again bewildered by another miscalculation that does not yield any prolonged political advantage anymore then the Mueller investigation did or their attempts at gun reform.\n\nThings have changed, and our present environment yields far more strategic benefit to Trump than it does Democrats. We live in a fast-paced news cycle where people\u2019s attention spans are short. They aren\u2019t interested in prolonged nuanced stories; they want you to get straight to the point and demand to know how it's relevant to their lives. If those two things aren\u2019t met, their attention eventually fades and like we have seen so many times over the past two, and a half years, when that happens, it\u2019s nearly impossible to reel people back in.\n\nWelsh politician Aneurin Bevan once stated, \u201cpolitics is a blood sport,\u201d the clarity of his words has never been more apparent than today. The battle for political power and influence have changed. The way in which politicians and political parties must fight to garner the attention of the American people to convince them just how bad the other side and their policies are in comparison to their own has morphed into something, unlike anything we have seen in the past.\n\nTrump appears to be playing a game of chess while Democrats are playing checkers. They\u2019re making moves hoping for an advantage, but they don\u2019t seem to recognize that they\u2019re playing the wrong game. They seem unable to make the necessary adjustments that meet the rules of today\u2019s politics. That\u2019s a challenge, and hurdle Democrats have yet to meet since Trump\u2019s election, and until they do, Trump and Republicans will have the advantage for the foreseeable future.\n\nShermichael Singleton is a Republican strategist and political analyst regularly appearing on MSNBC.
