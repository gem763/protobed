However, Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s challenge to Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to back a pre-Christmas general election last night has put that decision on hold until likely early next week.\n\nMr Johnson has said that he will table a motion on Monday calling for a snap election on December 12th, in return for MPs having until November 6th to pass his Brexit deal. The proposal will need a two-thirds majority in the House of Commons to pass, meaning support from the Labour Party.\n\nOn Friday morning, Labour\u2019s spokeswoman Diane Abbott told the BBC that her party would be blocking the motion until the government promises that there will not be a clean-break Brexit. If Jeremy Corbyn and his Labour Party reject a general election, the Conservative government will reportedly go on strike.\n\nLetter from Boris: an Election on December 12? Johnson Calls for Election\u2026 for Third Time https://t.co/kpkGR8nU6C \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 25, 2019\n\nA diplomatic source told The Times in an article published on Friday: \u201cAs a result of the Corbyn move it will be harder to achieve consensus. We will all lament the lack of clarity and not take a decision. There will be a lot of discussion over the weekend and potentially a decision on Monday or Tuesday.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are increasingly under pressure so we can\u2019t drag this out,\u201d an EU source said, affirming that even with the change in British political climate, a decision will be made next week.\n\nEven if European leaders do not grant the extension today, ambassadors will still discuss the duration of the extension at the Brussels meeting. France remains the most hardened to the idea of granting a long extension to January 31st, 2020, as requested in the Remainer-backed Benn Act.\n\nAm\u00e9lie de Montchalin, France\u2019s European Affairs minister, told RTL radio on Thursday night her government wants to see \u201ca clear scenario\u201d before making a decision.\n\n\u201cOur position is that simply giving more time, without political change, without ratification, without an election, would be useless,\u201d she said in comments reported by the Associated Press.\n\nMost European leaders are said to agree to President of the European Council Donald Tusk\u2019s recommendation of offering a \u201cflextension\u201d to January 31st, expiring any time before then at the point the British parliament agrees to the exit deal.\n\nTusk Tells European Leaders to Agree Brexit Extension to Stop No Deal https://t.co/FwakKQmo52 \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 23, 2019\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron is keen to progress his European agenda and sees the Brexit situation as dominating EU affairs and reportedly wants an extension no longer than to November 15th. BBC politics editor Laura Kuenssberg claimed on Thursday night that Mr Macron and Mr Johnson were privately discussing the shorter extension.\n\nMs Kuenssberg said on the BBC\u2019s Brexitcast: \u201cSomeone told me that Macron texted Johnson this morning and said he wanted a short extension. He wanted it done in November.\n\n\u201cNow, I do not know if that is true or not, but there is clearly a view based on evidence. There\u2019s a genuine belief in Government that Macron is pushing very hard for a short extension. But they don\u2019t expect that to happen.\u201d\n\nIn either eventuality of a short or long extension, the government admitted that the UK will not be leaving the EU on October 31st as Prime Minister Johnson had pledged \u201cdo or die\u201d.", "description": "The EU is expected to delay a decision on whether to grant an extension of Article 50 amidst recent election uncertainty.", "authors": ["Victoria Friedman"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Tusk-and-Johnson-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
