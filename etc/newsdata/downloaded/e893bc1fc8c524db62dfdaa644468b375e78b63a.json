The real-time, multiplayer strategy game sees players set up defences to deal with a wave of enemies. Those enemies are little Raskull minions, who first appeared in the 2010 Xbox game, Raskulls.\n\nHalfbrick Makes Half Their Staff Redundant Halfbrick have made up to half of their staff redundant in a move to focus the studio on its two most successful games: Fruit Ninja and Jetpack Joyride. Read more\n\nThe road to this point for Halfbrick, since Fruit Ninja was first released nine years ago, has been long. While the studio was responsible for some solid mobile titles in the past such as the Fruit Ninja sequels and Jetpack Joyride, it faced some organisational changes and by 2018, two years after its last app release, half of its staff were made redundant.\n\nIt was suggested the studio was trying everything to ride on the coattails of Fruit Ninja and Jetpack Joyride by producing similarly engaging mobile apps \u2014 after the switch from developing mid-budget titles for PC and portable devices (like Nintendo DS and PSP Go) in the late 2000s. But after many tries and some alleged problems with a shifting work culture, the revenue river had run dry and Halfbrick was stalled. Three years after its last release and around one-and-a-half years after a mass redundancy, Magic Brick Wars will be an interesting app to watch.\n\nMagic Brick Wars will be available on iOS and Android from November 15.", "description": "Halfbrick Studios has announced its releasing a new mobile app, Magic Brick Wars, in November after a three-year hiatus.", "authors": ["Cecilia D'Anastasio", "Sarah Basford"], "top_image": "https://edge.alluremedia.com.au/m/k/2019/10/magicbrickwars.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
