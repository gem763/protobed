The Chiefs\u2019 season \u2014 and the balance of power in the NFL \u2014 seemed to hang in the balance as members of the team\u2019s medical staff examined Mahomes\u2019s knee after he was unable to get up off the turf.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCan the Chiefs win without Mahomes? Everyone is about to find out.\n\nThe MRI exam taken the day after Mahomes suffered his injury was encouraging to the Chiefs, showing no major damage beyond the patellar dislocation. Mahomes was back on the practice field last week, participating on a limited basis. Hopes have been raised that Mahomes\u2019s absence from the lineup will be brief.\n\nPackers at Chiefs\n\nWhen: Sunday at 8:20 p.m. Eastern time\n\nWhere: Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Mo.\n\nTV: NBC\n\nStreaming: fuboTV\n\nBut in the meantime, the Chiefs must lean upon veteran backup Matt Moore. He threw a touchdown pass to wide receiver Tyreek Hill in the lopsided triumph over the Broncos. Given Coach Andy Reid\u2019s excellence in designing an offense, perhaps the Chiefs will be able to be more competitive against the Packers than one might expect.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMoore has game-breaking talent around him, will Hill and tight end Travis Kelce. Wide receiver Sammy Watkins is expected to return from a hamstring injury.\n\nThe Packers are formidable, though. They\u2019re off to a 6-1 start and are vying for NFC supremacy. Rodgers is coming off a 429-yard, five-touchdown performance against the Oakland Raiders in which he had a perfect passer rating of 158.3. The Packers won, 42-24, and Rodgers joined Norm Van Brocklin and Mark Rypien as the only players ever to throw for more than 400 yards and have five or more passing touchdowns and a rushing touchdown in a game.\n\nBut mostly, Rodgers hasn\u2019t had to be as dominant in Coach Matt LaFleur\u2019s first season in Green Bay, because the Packers have been a more balanced and more versatile team. They\u2019re ranked only 26th in the league in total defense, based on yards allowed. But they\u2019re ninth in scoring defense. Outside linebackers Preston Smith and Za\u2019Darius Smith have totaled 13 sacks to lead a revitalized pass rush, after being added as high-priced free agents during the offseason.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis would have been, with Mahomes, one of the most captivating quarterbacking matchups of the 2019 season. With Mahomes sidelined, the Packers have their chance to secure a key road victory and maintain their place among the league\u2019s elite teams.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Can Andy Reid find a way to coach the Patrick Mahomes-less Chiefs to a home victory over Rodgers\u2019s Packers?", "authors": ["Mark Maske", "Sports Reporter Covering The Nfl"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/rDpmuOH1d8ioyf88yJlUgk_y2tI=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MYTNOWXWNYI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
