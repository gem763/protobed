The same is true for international trade\u201d.\n\nMr Hockey\u2019s remarks, to Westminster College in Fulton, Missouri on Thursday (Friday AEST), come almost a month to the day after Prime Minister Scott Morrison basked in the glow of a White House state dinner in the Rose Garden.\n\nThat meeting was largely ignored by US media, but in the weeks since there have been mutterings around some quarters in Washington that Australia\u2019s government has made itself conspicuous by yoking itself too closely to a flawed president, who now faces only the third impeachment trial in American history.\n\nIn his speech, Mr Hockey hammered against the argument that trade deficits are a bad thing - which is one of Mr Trump\u2019s primary economic justifications for slapping tariffs on China.\n\n\u201cAustralia, like the United States, is a rich nation because whatever it doesn\u2019t consume, it then sells around the world. And both nations are blessed with plenty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe sensible middle ground of society understands that when we trade freely with other nations, our nation gets richer.\u201d\n\n\u201cProtectionism discourages growth and rewards mediocrity,\u201d Mr Hockey said.\n\nIn an attack on the Trump administration\u2019s attempts to undermine the World Trade Organisation and other multilateral groups, Mr Hockey said that while the US is the \u201cmost innovative nation on earth\u201d like any market leader \u201cit will be beaten if it thinks it can do it all on its own.\u201d\n\n\u201cSooner or later the remaining 95 per cent of the world population that lives outside the United States will catch up!\u201d\n\nHe added that the use of tariffs to attack China is not a \u201csustainable long-term solution\", saying tariffs are \u201cimposed by governments on their own people\u201d - challenging another talking point of Mr Trump that China is \"paying\" for the imposts.\n\n\u201cIf citizens of other countries don\u2019t have the same restrictions, they win,\" Mr Hockey said.\n\n\u201cIn the 21st century, the consumer demands sovereignty. And consumer sovereignty is powered by the free flow of goods and services around the world. The end game must always be a free and fair global trading system.\u201d\n\nMr Hockey is due to finish his term as ambassador in January.", "description": "Ambassador Joe Hockey\u2019s stunningly blunt message to Donald Trump on protectionism and world trade: \u201cIf you abdicate leadership you rarely get it back\u201d", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_941%2C$y_57/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/e90c18d207eb4cd547928099ff313fa0c1d4747a", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
