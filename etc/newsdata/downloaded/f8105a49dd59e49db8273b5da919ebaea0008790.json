What does this mean for those on the front lines?\n\nFor most of the past two decades, American troops have been deployed all over the world\u2014to about 150 countries. During that time, hundreds of thousands of young men and women have experienced combat, and a generation of officers have come of age dealing with the practical realities of war. They possess a deep well of knowledge and experience. For the past three years, these highly trained professionals have been commanded by Donald Trump.\n\nTo get a sense of what serving Trump has been like, I interviewed officers up and down the ranks, as well as several present and former civilian Pentagon employees. Among the officers I spoke with were four of the highest ranks\u2014three or four stars\u2014all recently retired. All but one served Trump directly; the other left the service shortly before Trump was inaugurated. They come from different branches of the military, but I\u2019ll simply refer to them as \u201cthe generals.\u201d Some spoke only off the record, some allowed what they said to be quoted without attribution, and some talked on the record.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/static/a/theatlantic/img/default-thumbnail.png", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
