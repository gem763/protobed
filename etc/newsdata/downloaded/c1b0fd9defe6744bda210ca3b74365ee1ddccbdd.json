Yes, the rumors were true: Shingy was leaving AOL. Shingy (a play on his legal name, David Shing) made headlines in 2014 when he appeared on TV, touted as AOL\u2019s \u201cDigital Prophet.\u201d To people who experienced Shingy from the TV appearance, he seemed to represent the stumbles of AOL as a whole: a grown man with wild hair and nail polish referring to himself as a mystic on cable TV, a desperate attempt at cool. A withering New Yorker piece later that year cemented the perception.\n\nIn reality, the \u201cdigital prophet\u201d moniker was a funny name slapped on Shingy\u2019s fairly standard role in marketing AOL\u2019s brand to advertisers. Now Shingy says he\u2019s done with that role. \u201cWe inhabit a pivotal time at which much is at stake in how we practice media and marketing,\u201d he wrote in his goodbye letter. The man who, to some, became an avatar of AOL\u2019s (and then Verizon Media\u2019s) uncertainty and aimlessness is now in the wilderness himself, taking a break. He spoke with Intelligencer about his experiences so far, and what might be next.\n\nThe reason I got in touch was your recent announcement that you\u2019d left AOL. I was interested in that, plus you\u2019ve been a point of fascination within certain tech circles for a while.\n\nIt\u2019s interesting because I\u2019m taking some time off, but when I meet with people, the first thing they ask me is \u201cShingy, why\u2019d it take so long?\u201d And I\u2019m kind of bewildered by that because I\u2019ve been so nose down, bum up. I travel a lot. I\u2019ve been a constant output machine for years now. I get it, man, I\u2019m pretty self aware of people \u2014 they love me or they hate me, one or the other, and that\u2019s okay. And most of them see the persona; they don\u2019t actually get a sense of the person. It\u2019s all been by design.\n\nSo I guess I\u2019d like to start at square one. What was your childhood like? How did you get to where you are now?\n\nIt was pretty basic. I\u2019m one of ten kids from Australia, six miles north of Sydney, and because I\u2019m one of ten (I\u2019m number eight), it was a very active country lifestyle. I studied arts; that was really my favorite. For me, it was fine art. I was fascinated with Jackson Pollock and Picasso and all the standards you\u2019d expect. And then art in general, sculpting, and then painting and drawing was the thing I was really drawn to, woodwork. I mean, all the usual things that sort of ground you in hands and heart. I\u2019m not massively fascinated by science or biology or chemistry or any of that stuff.\n\nWhen I was about 17, I left school and went to Sydney, studied graphic design. And that was great. It just gave the grounding about what did it mean to go from art to graphic art? And then what does commercial graphic art look like? What does it mean to hand-kern fonts? And what does that mean to come up with concepts and ideas? And what\u2019s this idea of advertising, which I grew up with but I didn\u2019t really find fascinating until my early 20s.\n\nI worked for a little company, and then I went full time at a corporate software company \u2014 can\u2019t remember the name. Then from there, I joined a team to do some software, which was fascinating. Like, to be an interface designer for software for the internet.\n\nSo you were doing UI design? Was this at a time when UI design wasn\u2019t standardized, and everyone was still figuring it out?\n\nOh yeah. It was beveled buttons and having to create a GIF out of those things. And the idea of 256-color web palettes, 640 by 480 screens, 800 by 600 screens; 1,024 by 768 was probably brand-new back then. But UI was \u2026 oh no, Dreamweaver wasn\u2019t even a thing, I don\u2019t think. I think I was designing in Photoshop. When I came out of design school, which, fascinatingly, people would say, \u201cYou\u2019re going to get in trouble; the industry is going to implode.\u201d What do you mean? \u201cYou\u2019re the last of the old-fashioned graphic designers.\u201d Because what comes next are computers, and I hadn\u2019t trained on computers. And along came computers, and it did it hurt the industry because now everybody who had a computer was basically a designer and had access to millions of colors and tens of thousands of fonts. Like any industry, when that happens, it kind of democratizes it. Everyone\u2019s a designer. That\u2019s great. But very quickly after that, I realized that not everybody has taste. And that\u2019s what craft\u2019s about.\n\nWhen you load up an old Geocities site \u2014\n\nBeautiful, beautiful analogy.\n\nI love it, but it\u2019s a real mess.\n\nIt\u2019s a real mess. You know, it\u2019s so funny you should bring that up, because one of the things I\u2019ve been thinking about recently is that the internet needs to be punk. It needs to have more rock and roll in it. If you look at the internet, everything is homogenized; it really does look the same, particularly the places you hang out. So I was a designer, a GUI designer by default, since it was coming around the corner, and I got a chance to move to New York, late \u201990s, with a start-up that was doing website design, like software to build websites. If you think of Squarespace now, take it back to 1999; it was really chunky and hard to do. But there was some interesting technology in there.\n\nThen I ended up going to London, and a friend of mine who used to work for me in New York had joined AOL.\n\nWhat year was this?\n\nI went to London a couple of times, the second time was in 2007, 2008, or something like that. 2007. And then I came on as a contractor for him. And then we helped launch a bunch of territories.\n\nTerritories for \u2026\n\nAOL.\n\nAt that point, AOL is this enormous \u2014\n\nNot true. In the U.S. it was, and it was in the U.K. and Germany.\n\nSo is it like launching AOL \u2014\n\nDot E S, for Spain.\n\nIs it launching the web portal? Is it the dial-up service?\n\nOh, I see the dynamics of business.\n\nI\u2019m trying to figure out which part of AOL.\n\nThe ISP bit that you talked about, that wasn\u2019t part of the business model for a very long time. So when I came on board, it was to launch, you know, AOL.es, AOL.nl, AOL.pl, so launch countries, really, right? And it was an interesting strategy but not one that had longevity.\n\nWithin these regional launches, what were you tasked with?\n\nLaunching them as head of marketing. And that helped to build a relationship with people who would sell the site in the territory, because we didn\u2019t have salespeople on the ground. So we had resellers that would go out and sell for us. I didn\u2019t have to schmooze the locals, but my job was to bring someone in who could actually build the relationship. My job was to stand up the site, launch it, and then do it again in a bunch of other countries.\n\nDoes that involve a lot of travel or just a lot of phone calls?\n\nA lot of travel. You gotta be local. I mean, otherwise they\u2019re not going to care about you. Particularly in places like Italy and Spain and all of them. Poland, the Nordics generally, I mean, they\u2019re all just fascinating. We managed it from London, but you have to sort of set it up and make sure you nurture it. This virtuality we think of is not necessarily where it\u2019s all headed, because we want to have human relationships in business.\n\nOkay, so you launch all these territories. How do you go from doing that to your final role as the \u201cdigital prophet\u201d?\n\nLet me bridge you on this whole thing, so we\u2019re caught up. So Tim Armstrong comes onboard, and he is the new CEO, as you know, may not know. So he came onboard to rebirth AOL as a company, and he did a tour of all the territories; we met on one of those tours, and through that relationship of meeting, we were quite kindred immediately. One of the things I whispered to him is \u201cI don\u2019t know if all the territories I just launched is the best strategy forward. You might want to get it right first before you do global domination.\u201d And he asked me to come on full time and help the European organization. The person I was working for at the time was Kate Burns. She became the managing director of AOL Europe \u2014 fantastic lady, incredible operator \u2014 and I was thrilled working for her. She\u2019s a sort of vivacious, empowered operator; she really got shit done. In that tenure, we closed down all the stuff I launched, receded, and decided, you know, we should probably just be in the U.K., France, Germany. My job was media and marketing: sit with the sales team, figure out really what people wanted, what propositions they wanted to advertise on, and then either build them or take the ones we already had and extend them. That was kind of the gig. Pretty cool.\n\nThe \u201cprophet\u201d piece came from when I helped rebirth AOL\u2019s brand. I was hand-chosen to launch the mission statement for AOL in this period. Tim decided to launch a new mission, and in his first massive town hall, in front of probably 10,000 people, we launched the mission statement. I went onstage and announced it. I flew in from Europe, snuck in one night, turned up onstage, announced the mission statement, threw a bunch of hats into the crowd, and pissed off. And then, like, we\u2019re going to also rebirth the logo, identity, the whole strategy around it. I\u2019m like, \u201cGreat. That\u2019s my flywheel. Let\u2019s talk about that and try to steer that in the right direction.\u201d\n\nYeah, I have to imagine AOL\u2019s brand identity was not exactly a nimble ship to steer.\n\nIt has so many tentacles into so many different places that, you know, to say you\u2019re going to reboot the brand is incredibly difficult to prepare. So we invented this idea of this AOL, the idea that anything could be an A or a logo or part of an identity. So a photograph of this sugar [holds up sugar bowl] could have an AOL logo on it because it\u2019s part of culture. It\u2019s sweetener. This was a while ago now, but that was the concept. Take this thing that seemed like a pointed arrow and soften the shoulders superfast. So it was that principle, and then we ended up launching that.\n\nBut what happens in a company, particularly when you try and get a strategy right, is when one division performs poorly, everyone suffers. It\u2019s just the nature of the big business. Instead of dealing with that one problem, spreading the pain is a challenge. And when you\u2019re in a territory that isn\u2019t headquarters, that pain can feel like it\u2019s not much to headquarters, but it affects you intimately. So around 2010, after that happened, I decided to talk about AOL just in the marketplace differently. I didn\u2019t have the budget to really do consumer marketing aggressively, like I wanted to. And then we ended up \u2014\n\nWait, let\u2019s just pretend like I\u2019m 5. Like if it\u2019s not consumer marketing, do you mean marketing to other \u2014\n\nThe media community. So to advertising agencies, to brands, people who actually help us pay rent, people who are going to place ads on websites.\n\nSo like going to conferences.\n\nJust the market itself. Not giving a spiel. Like sit on panels and talk about stuff because I\u2019m the AOL guy. And it was less about amplifying the marketing to you, Brian, who doesn\u2019t know nothing about what we are. We didn\u2019t have the budget to do that much. We could do some, but not enormous. So it was really just to kind of make sure advertisers knew we were still around, people knew, you know, that it mattered. Then Tim asked me to come on full time and do it in New York. He wanted to call me an evangelist, and we all said, \u201cNo, that sounds too much like Google.\u201d There\u2019s evangelists at Google and Microsoft and a bunch of others; I\u2019m not that interested in that. So I decided to come up with a title overnight. Couple bottles of wine and boom, I had a laugh to myself and called myself the prophet.\n\nWould you say \u201cdigital prophet\u201d is like a synonym for \u201cevangelist\u201d?\n\nYeah, it\u2019s not different. I mean, the whole idea is, in the creative marketplace, I feel like it needed some fun, some levity. So I came up with something that\u2019s not serious. It was designed to have levity to it. A lot of people couldn\u2019t reconcile it \u2014 weird hair, nail polish, dude calls himself the digital prophet and walks around with an AOL business card, what gives? It\u2019s awesome. So much fun with that. If you read the New Yorker piece, you understand what happens. They did a profile on me, and it\u2019s just a total tear-up. Good luck. You spent an entire day with me, all you want to write about is the stuff that makes me look like a skylark. Like you don\u2019t see the value that happened behind the curtain.\n\nWhat did that piece leave out?\n\nMeetings I had that were actually business-development-style meetings. Or the fact that I spent the morning presenting, interviewing Gavin DeGraw onstage and Jason Momoa. I mean, you know, stuff that actually was real work. It was just a total stitch-up. And it was a joke. But thank God, they did. It just made me more interesting and more famous, so God bless.\n\nThat piece came out after a screenshot of you on TV started floating around.\n\nYeah, yeah, on The Cycle. What happened was that we had a bad week, news-cycle-wise. Tim went on TV and talked about the stress babies, and this terrible article came out. It was just taken out of context. If you know him, he\u2019s an incredible, incredibly compassionate \u2014 but anyway, taken out of context. I think the next day or that week, I was booked to do The Cycle, and I called the head of comms \u2014 I didn\u2019t book it \u2014 and said, \u201cHey, I\u2019m on this TV show thing. Shall I sit out?\u201d They\u2019re like, \u201cNo no, Shingy, business as usual. Let\u2019s get on with it.\u201d So now I\u2019m on MSNBC \u2014 The Cycle is pretty meat-and-potatoes America \u2014 and I\u2019m talking about concepts like defriend, unfollow, and there\u2019s the nail polish and the hair and the leather jacket and the glasses and the title \u201cprophet.\u201d\n\nThey had the chyron.\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah. And then, you know, Gawker, I think, took a screen grab. The rest, as they say, is history. Hell of a thing, man.\n\nPhoto: Valleywag\n\nI guess I\u2019m hearing that you think the reaction was overblown. But as someone who was looking at it from the outside, I think it looked like AOL \u2014 a company that, at that point, had a sort of stodgy reputation \u2014 was just trying and failing to be cool somehow.\n\nI don\u2019t think it was overblown. I just think it was if you\u2019re inside media or you\u2019re inside brands or you\u2019re an executive in the media, you kind of get the context because there is context. When somebody comes on for three minutes or something, it just seems like the context is completely off. That\u2019s why my comms team probably should\u2019ve said no to it. And it ended up being what it was. It wasn\u2019t overblown; I just think it was current and ripe for the picking. I just happened to be picked.\n\nAt AOL around that time, do you recall any internal reaction?\n\nPeople thought it was fantastic. Kept them in the news cycle, made us seem far more interesting, meant we had interesting people that just didn\u2019t \u2014 it wasn\u2019t stodgy, it\u2019s just a lot of people didn\u2019t know that. I think I represented more of the \u201cnot stodgy,\u201d if that makes sense. It\u2019s this historical, 25-year-old brand. It wasn\u2019t like, \u201cOh my God, now what?\u201d 2014, 2015 is an interesting time anyway. Everyone\u2019s trying to create the app of the century, iPad strategies, everyone\u2019s having a crack at it, trying to be culturally relevant. I was just agnostic, talking about stuff that\u2019s going on, whatever.\n\nThat fills in a lot of gaps\n\nReally? I thought that stuff had been written about.\n\nI guess maybe. Maybe I want to preserve the mystery.\n\nI\u2019m vibin\u2019 this, like, \u201cTreat me like a 5-year-old. I don\u2019t quite get why this works. Why is this relevant?\u201d I\u2019m feeling that from you, which I get. I mean, I respect that. But what I never tried to tell the marketplace \u2014 which, frankly, I don\u2019t really want to tell them now \u2014 is why it really worked and how it really worked. And, you know, that\u2019s kind of the mystery. But I can tell you that having that title and doing that work that I did, first it demonstrated that there was a hunger for it, so I did it for a while; second, there\u2019s value in it because it got people meetings they could never get before; and third, people in the industry still respect and know what I do, which is a separate piece from all of that shit.\n\nThere\u2019s a picture of me on a wrecking ball that made the rounds too. That was not a late-night party at South by Southwest. People thought I\u2019d orchestrated this incredible PR thing. I\u2019m on the wrecking-ball thing at 10:30 in the morning, and there\u2019s nobody in that room. And the publisher of Mashable at the time asked me to walk around their execution as a technical thing and give feedback. People thought it was like a 3 a.m. party. I probably shouldn\u2019t have corrected it. That\u2019s awesome to think I have the audacity to do that.\n\nDid the idea that anything you do can be taken out of context freak you out? Did you start second-guessing yourself?\n\nI definitely was cautious about it because when you get trolled several times, you\u2019re kind of like, \u201cI\u2019m good. I\u2019ll just put my head down and keep working and doing the work I need to do,\u201d which is not to be invisible. Don\u2019t get me wrong, oh my God, I\u2019m in the market more than ever before. It\u2019s just that the context was awesome. I just didn\u2019t think it was that important; I didn\u2019t think it was that interesting.\n\nI think it all sort of happened around the time Valleywag was very popular and was highlighting tech companies that were perceived to be pissing away money.\n\nNo, you\u2019re right. That calmed down, I guess, in the last five or six years.\n\nYeah, it\u2019s now that everyone\u2019s just mad at tech companies.\n\nAbsolutely, it\u2019s everybody\u2019s turn now. It\u2019s actually Facebook\u2019s turn. Everyone cycles, mate, you go through this. Look at Microsoft, they went through a period where they were the heroes, and they couldn\u2019t do anything wrong. They end up in the capitol, talking about why they shouldn\u2019t be split off and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And then 10 years later, it\u2019s Google\u2019s turn. They spent all this time down there. And then, well, guess what: Ten years later, it\u2019s Facebook\u2019s turn. Yeah, just everyone has a turn. And then they get superconservative. They can\u2019t do anything, because they become massive and bloated. So their innovation cycle\u2019s upset. That\u2019s popularity. It was always in the background \u2014 we held on to an audience that\u2019s just kind of \u2026 stayed. It\u2019s been interesting. So the idea of MSN, AOL, and Yahoo all coming together, it\u2019s no surprise, somebody had to do it. I\u2019m just surprised we did it.\n\nDo you think they\u2019ve gotten stronger together?\n\nNo, but thank God, there\u2019s focus. Can you bring down the best of those three into one thing? Awesome. Everything else that\u2019s independent, they hopefully get a lifeline to continue doing that. TechCrunch, Engadget, HuffPost, it\u2019s just the brands inside there that are independent, hopefully have the fuel to continue their independence. I love TechCrunch, and I love HuffPost \u2014 they\u2019re the rags I read. So, you know, I respect that. I don\u2019t often visit the homepage of Yahoo. I don\u2019t need to. But there are plenty of people that do.\n\nI feel like Yahoo and dinosaurs like that, for lack of a better word, are often coasting a lot of the time \u2014 at least, that\u2019s my read from the outside.\n\nNo, no, no disrespect there. What I think is interesting is there\u2019s two sides of the business. There are the media brands that are trying to continue creating contagion. Some of them have a bigger audience; they seem like they can\u2019t pivot quickly, so they stay true to the audience they have. Yahoo, AOL, MSN, etc. And then on the other side, you got these other brands trying to create really interesting contagion, changing. I mean, when we acquired HuffPost it was about that story you wrote will be published on that site and, if it became popular, could end up on the home page of the category you give a shit about. That\u2019s an interesting premise. Yeah, so it\u2019s kind of UGC [user-generated content] with both. The flip side of that was now it\u2019s changed to being paid editorial. And it\u2019s hard hitting, and it\u2019s fantastic. But that\u2019s kind of one side of the business, which is media. The other side of the business, which is really powerful for them, is the platform side, the ability to actually rep a whole bunch of third-party brands and give scale. And that\u2019s the programmatic side.\n\nSo the company is actually balanced between those two things, not just one thing, which is selling only their relationships with their audience, like everyone else\u2019s \u2014 Google, Facebook, etc. It\u2019s kind of like a portfolio over here and a bigger portfolio over here. It\u2019s this tech company that has media chops and advertising chops. You know, it\u2019s hard, man, to create new, compelling propositions, no matter how innovative they seem, with a masthead that may not seem as glossy to an audience.They don\u2019t rest on their laurels; they\u2019re constantly trying to change.\n\nWhat does Verizon get out of this?\n\nIncredible ad tech, owned-and-operated media. Think about all the households they have; they could go out and do relationships with third parties like YouTube, etc. They\u2019ve got their own now. If they can push that content directly, have more of a relationship with the consumer, they get closer to the consumer. It\u2019s not just about \u201cHey, I\u2019ve got this fat funnel. Do you want to bring your content along for the ride, so I can hold people\u2019s attention?\u201d That\u2019s really the power behind having the media side of this. The programmatic side is just about how to deliver some sort of compelling advertising opportunities, hopefully in a format that feels like it\u2019s innovative. It\u2019s not there yet, it\u2019s miles away from being there, but that\u2019s really the promise.\n\nIn your role as this evangelizing VP, how do you evaluate your own success? What would you accomplish that demonstrates you\u2019re good at your job?\n\nHundreds of meetings a year, outside of doing conferences.\n\nWhat\u2019s the goal of those meetings?\n\nThink about the brand differently and hopefully have a relationship that says, \u201cHey, if you want an editorial voice, TechCrunch might be the one to show you how to get there,\u201d or \u201cIf you want to meet mass consumers, AOL can help you get there as well.\u201d That\u2019s different than just social, different than just search. And that was really my role.\n\nDo you think you were successful in that role?\n\nYeah.\n\nSo you\u2019re not with Verizon Media anymore. What\u2019s next?\n\nI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m in limbo. I just decided to take some time off. I had an incredible July. I just came off Cannes, educating the young market, young creatives, and a bunch of good meetings while I was in Europe. And I just came off the road and thought, Let me look inwardly as an organization. We\u2019re part media, part technology: What does that mean for somebody who feels like they\u2019re a creative who wants to still build stuff, not just talk about building stuff or the potential of building stuff? And how do I do that? Could I construct something inside there that allowed me to do that but had a higher purpose? I ultimately decided, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think I could.\u201d I mean, I love my job, but I just wanted to do things that help better the world, just have a different type of legacy. I would rather speak about things that don\u2019t promote, for instance, not using plastic straws that are killing turtles. But what about the fact that the ocean\u2019s boiling? What can I do as as somebody who has creative, media, and technology experience and understanding how to orchestrate that.\n\nIt sounds like you just want some distance from it to do something a little bit new.\n\nAlso I\u2019m more of a polymath. People think I just do that; there are many other things I\u2019m interested in and have opinions and experiences. But I can\u2019t do it under the guise of a guy who touts the power of the internet.\n\nWould you say you\u2019ve become disillusioned with the internet?\n\nNo, I think the frequency of it is just slightly too high. We\u2019re in a space right now where [gesturing around the restaurant] your phone\u2019s on the table \u2014\n\nFor the record, my phone\u2019s out for recording this, just to be clear.\n\nTheir laptop\u2019s on the table, two phones there, two phones there, two phones over there with one person. What\u2019s remarkable is that there\u2019s only one person looking at their device right now. If we give it another ten minutes, probably 70 percent of this room is going to be on their phones. But what gives me faith, in this room right now, people are actually talking to each other. That\u2019s amazing. The more and more I travel, and a lot of the time I\u2019m traveling by myself, I look around and, like, people just aren\u2019t into it, man. They\u2019re just into not being present. And this technology is amazing, but it\u2019s not necessarily healthy. More frequently, I\u2019ve been talking about digital detoxing. How can you lower your vibration by being further away? [Points at phone] This thing is meant to be a productivity tool; it\u2019s not necessarily making you more productive if you haven\u2019t looked up. I\u2019m just concerned about some of those human traits, because it\u2019s changed our behavior but it hasn\u2019t changed our need: Our need for connection is still real. I just question whether that connection is any better. Which is kind of why I still think the internet needs to be punk a bit. It\u2019s a bit too homogenized.\n\nYeah, everything happens on like three sites right now that are all owned by Facebook.\n\nAnd you\u2019re told to be expressive in a place that\u2019s 716 pixels wide and there\u2019s blue bar across the top. And then the the format of it feels very linear.\n\nIs there anything coming down the pipeline that excites you?\n\nNot that I can really, really speak to, but I\u2019m intrigued by things like \u2014 I thought the New York Times was hitting something interesting when they did \u201cSnow Fall.\u201d I thought it was great. And that was before everything was parallaxed.\n\nEveryone went all in on parallax.\n\nOh boy, probably a little bit too over overconfident there, but that was a really interesting, intriguing moment to say, well, it feels like things are a bit too noisy. How about a visual that still has depth but isn\u2019t video? And it really makes you sort of sit up and look forward because you have to roll through it. I thought that was amazing. And then, you know, I think Medium\u2019s an interesting site too, just because some people have an outlet for long thought, sort of formatted a bit differently. It\u2019s all closing. You use WhatsApp, I assume?\n\nI mean, I use iMessage mostly, but with WhatsApp, all my friends are in the U.S., so it\u2019s not a go-to.\n\nIf I think about the things that are super contagious, they\u2019re WhatsApp, WeChat, Line \u2014\n\nMessaging.\n\nSnapchat, Messenger, texting. I mean, that\u2019s all kind of wonderful. It\u2019s going back to one-to-one. It\u2019s not about broadcast, so it\u2019s going back to narrowcast. The format\u2019s very unsexy. If you look at the GUI around WhatsApp, it looks like bloody Myspace \u2014 I mean, it\u2019s not very sexy. But it has the ability to feel like you\u2019re actually part of something because you\u2019re not broadcasting. I do think the broadcast medium has been very homogenized. There\u2019s a particular way to shoot photos to make sure you look like you\u2019re part of Instagram. Here\u2019s your persona outwardly, and here\u2019s your intimacy. Do the two come together? Maybe not.\n\nI feel it\u2019s more of a problem for people like my age or older, people who just like \u2014\n\nCare?\n\nOr who remember a point when you were advised to, like, \u201cbe careful what you do on the internet,\u201d you know. But now I feel like \u2014 and I have nothing to back this up \u2014 but, like, younger people just know how to reconcile those different spaces.\n\nYeah, absolutely. But that\u2019s also their culture. My time was TV, which is passive, and radio, just passive. So these passive behaviors are now part of the vernacular. It\u2019s common. I mentor these young kids, presented to a bunch of these kids last week \u2014 I have more time to do stuff I really couldn\u2019t justify doing and giving back. This was at a place in Detroit, and I sat and listened; I actually spent the whole day. Normally, I come in, present, and leave as quickly as possible for the next thing. But I learned a lot from them. A lot of them were concerned, saying, \u201cI\u2019ve closed down my Instagram, and now it\u2019s private,\u201d or \u201cEverything\u2019s private now because I don\u2019t want people to judge my own social footprint when I\u2019m getting a job.\u201d My feedback to them was if they judge your social footprint about getting a job, then you don\u2019t want to work for them, because it\u2019s the tool of your culture and your people, your time. So if people don\u2019t get that, then they\u2019re out of step with you anyway. That was kind of fascinating.\n\nIn this interim period for you, what do you do with your free time?\n\nI\u2019m looking to help advise the companies that I think are just interesting, in the spaces I don\u2019t normally play around in. Why not? And then I\u2019m taking real time off, phones off. I\u2019m watching the sunset on the beach every night.\n\nIn your good-bye letter, you said you have a daughter.\n\nYeah, a 2-and-a-half-year-old daughter. If I knew it was this good, I would have done it earlier.\n\nI assume you worry about all this stuff on a much more severe level now.\n\nI do. Oh, it\u2019s a heightened state of awareness, my friend. And that came from parenthood. Up until then, I was Peter Pan and happy for it to be jolly and happy for this whole thing that was maybe work, maybe not work. Now? I\u2019m very, very, very concerned about the attention economy, which I believed in.\n\nIs there any time when you\u2019re like, \u201cOh, she\u2019s not touching that until she\u2019s 7\u201d or whatever?\n\nYeah, I mean, my daughter is screen free until I have to introduce it. And there\u2019s a time when she\u2019ll have to be introduced. Anytime she gets to see a screen, it\u2019s the seatback on the airplane. She doesn\u2019t really have a context for that. So other than that, we\u2019re trying to be screen free. It\u2019s real tough. I\u2019m also trying to, you know, I don\u2019t have my phone out. I consciously don\u2019t pull it out. Trying to be in the popular culture means you\u2019re going to dig around your phone 1,000 times a day. I stop short of getting a flip phone. A little too radical, but I like the idea.", "description": "AOL\u2019s Digital Prophet speaks out.", "authors": ["Brian Feldman"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/grub/2019/10/03/03-shingy.w1200.h630.jpg"}
