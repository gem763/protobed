But that third rule is changing.\n\nHertz, Dollar and Thrifty rental car companies now accept debit cards for payment in Europe, according to The Points Guy. The change was made because debit cards are used more often than credit cards in Europe, a press release from Hertz claims.\n\nIt may offer convenience for many travellers, but it comes at a price. The three rental car companies in the Hertz group will take a pre-authorised deposit if you\u2019re paying by credit card to cover estimated charges, including a full tank of gas.\n\nThe deposit will be released when the car is returned and the final payment calculated, but it could take as long as 30 days for customers to see that deposit amount back in their account. \u201cAcceptable debit/check cards must have available funds, sufficient to pay the estimated amount of the rental charges plus the credit reserved or deposit pre-authorised by Hertz, Dollar or Thrifty,\u201d the release explains.\n\nYes, you read correctly. You will need double the estimated amount of your rental in your bank account before you get to the rental counter.\n\nPay with a credit card to spend less on rental car insurance\n\nAlternately, if you reserve a car with your credit card, that hold will be released after you return the car without impacting the actual amount of money you have. This is just one of two big reasons why you should always book a rental car on a credit card, even if debit is an option.\n\nAs we\u2019ve discussed before, some credit cards offer major travel insurance perks. Some only offer secondary insurance for car rentals, which covers anything left over after filing a claim with your regular car insurance company. Others offer primary insurance, meaning you can skip the upcharge at the rental counter and rely on your credit card\u2019s benefits for coverage.\n\nThat coverage can vary from card to card \u2014 it\u2019s common that credit cards only cover collision, not liability \u2014 and many rental companies will ask to see proof of your coverage when you pick up the car. But if you pay with a debit card, you won\u2019t have any chance at getting your coverage for free.", "description": "Even if you rarely rent a car, you probably know the usual restrictions for doing so: You need a valid driver\u2019s licence, you have to be at least 21, and in some countries, you need a credit card.
