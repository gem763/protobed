Photo: Mike Zarrilli/MLB Photos via Getty Images\n\nFor the record, I moved away from Georgia (where I had spent all but a few years of my life) at the end of 1994, just three years after the Atlanta Braves and their fans adopted the \u201ctomahawk chop\u201d as a gesture of support and encouragement for the team. I didn\u2019t think about it a lot other than observing that at least the team had earlier taken down the ludicrous teepee in the left-field stands inhabited by \u201cChief Noc-a-Homa,\u201d who got out and did what was purportedly a Native American dance every time the home team called Dr. Long Ball.\n\nI observed the off-and-on controversy over the chop from a distance, but did occasionally wonder if, given the state\u2019s history, a professional sports team from Georgia might want to be a tad less oafish about racially sensitive matters. I mean, there was this legacy of slavery, the insanely destructive War for White Supremacy (a.k.a. Civil War), the white terrorism that thwarted Reconstruction, and a near-century of Jim Crow. And the Peach State outdid its proto-Confederate southern cousins in the brutal and greedy way it treated its large Native population.\n\nBut more fundamental even than Georgia\u2019s megaracist history, the practice of mocking and offending Native Americans, even in the relatively innocent context of baseball, struck me as violating the chief behavioral principle with which I was raised by a very southern family: being polite and not acting ugly. Being rude to strangers was something those rude Yankees \u2014 bless their hearts \u2014 were prone to do because they didn\u2019t know better. So it did surprise me a bit when the Braves kept on with this brand-new \u201ctradition\u201d once it became clear it offended people that had suffered enough at the hands of Georgians.\n\nBut I sure didn\u2019t anticipate this level of boorish behavior (as reported by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution):\n\nGeorgia conservatives knocked the Atlanta Braves for pivoting from the \u201ctomahawk chop\u201d chant ahead of Wednesday\u2019s humiliating Game 5 playoff defeat against the St. Louis Cardinals.\n\nThe team didn\u2019t distribute the trademark foam tomahawks to fans at the decisive National League Division series game and took measures to reduce the chopping chant used to fire up the crowd after Cardinals pitcher Ryan Helsley raised concerns.\n\nYou should know this about Helsley:\n\nHelsley, a 25-year-old rookie, is from Tahlequah, Okla. His grandfather was full-blooded Cherokee and the family has deep roots in the heart of Cherokee Nation.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a misrepresentation of the Cherokee people or Native Americans in general,\u201d Helsley told the St. Louis Post-Disptach before Game 2 on Friday. \u201cJust depicts them in this kind of caveman-type people way who aren\u2019t intellectual. They are a lot more than that. It\u2019s not me being offended by the whole mascot thing. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s about the misconception of us, the Native Americans, and it devalues us and how we\u2019re perceived in that way, or used as mascots.\n\nI will note again that Georgians, as the heirs of those responsible for the Trail of Tears, ought to feel a particular obligation to show some respect to Cherokees. But to Georgia Republicans, that\u2019s all backward: Downplaying (not banning, but simply downplaying) the chop was deeply offensive to \u2026 to what? The right to be \u201cpolitically incorrect,\u201d as they love to say?\n\nDebbie Dooley, a Georgia tea party organizer, said the Braves \u201cjinxed itself by catering to a politically correct snowflake\u201d and suggested the team change its name to \u201cAtlanta Snowflakes.\u201d\n\nErick Erickson, the conservative commentator, highlighted images of fans swinging oversized tomahawks.\n\n\u201cBraves refuse to go with the Tomahawk Chop and get crushed on the field,\u201d Erickson wrote. \u201cFitting and embarrassing.\u201d\n\nThese comments were, it seems, the tip of an iceberg of contempt for the Braves\u2019 overdue effort to be nice and not act ugly.\n\n\u201cThis. Is. Painful,\u201d tweeted state Rep. Trey Kelley, one of the top Republicans in the Georgia House, midway through the team\u2019s first-inning implosion. \u201cHave to feel this is karma for the unjustified and rash decision to do away with foam tomahawks.\u201d\n\nHis was not a fringe sentiment. Nick Ayers, the former top aide to Vice President Mike Pence and a veteran Georgia operative, had a curt reaction to the team\u2019s first-inning struggles.\n\n\u201cMaybe don\u2019t ban the tomahawk chop next time?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what these people are suggesting occurred. Did God (or \u201ckarma\u201d) turn on ESPN and get upset about too little chop and smite the Braves? Did one Braves player turn to another and say, \u201cNot enough racism in the stands tonight; let\u2019s throw the game!\u201d\n\nEven if you don\u2019t share my views about the chop and similar gestures, are they really mandatory? Is it important to Georgia Republicans that their constituents be as offensive as possible?\n\nI don\u2019t know, but perhaps it has something to do with the fact that Georgia Republicans love a rude and foul-mouthed Yankee who says things every other hour that, according to my Southern Baptist upbringing, would earn a one-way ticket to hell. Indeed, they seem to love him precisely because he\u2019s the sort of man we\u2019ve been told to avoid like a drunk-driver pulling into a I-75 rest stop at 3 a.m. And now it seems they are beginning to value hatefulness as a virtue in itself.\n\nBless their hearts.", "description": "Georgia Republicans attributed a playoff loss by the Atlanta Braves to a decision to downplay the racially offensive Tomahawk Chop chant, showing that they\u2019ve replaced southern politeness with the manners of their rude yankee leader.", "authors": ["Ed Kilgore"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/10/10/10-atlanta-braves.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
