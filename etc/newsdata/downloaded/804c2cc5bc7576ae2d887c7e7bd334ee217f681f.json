The tepid moves come as investors prepare for the Fed's announcement of how it plans to proceed with its latest phase of monetary easing following the conclusion of the central bank's two-day meeting later Wednesday.\n\nInvestors have high expectations that the Fed will cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point to between 1.5% and 1.75%, but there is less clarity on how the central bank proceeds after that.\n\nFor now, investors are standing pat until the Fed releases its policy statement and Chairman Jerome Powell holds his press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET.\n\nThe S&P 500 fell 0.1%, while the Dow industrials slipped 11 points, or 0.1%, to 27057. The Nasdaq also edged lower, sliding 0.2%.\n\n\"The market is looking for signs about how committed the Fed is to support policy further,\" said Geoffrey Yu, head of the U.K. office of UBS's investment arm. \"Everybody knows the Fed has room to lower rates further, the question is how willing are they?\"\n\nCorporate earnings continued to contribute to swings in individual stocks.\n\nShares of Yum Brands declined nearly 10% after the restaurant chain marked down the value of its investment in online food delivery app GrubHub. Shares of Molson Coors Brewing also fell, shedding 4.1% after the maker of Coors Light and Miller Lite disclosed plans to cut hundreds of jobs.\n\nMeanwhile, General Electric jumped 10% after the company raised its cash-flow outlook for the year.\n\nAnd shares of Johnson & Johnson rose 2.5% saying Tuesday that a test of its baby powder didn't find traces of asbestos, rebutting U.S. regulators' claims about the product.\n\nA raft of major U.S. companies, including Apple, Facebook, Lyft and Starbucks, are poised to report through the day. There is also widespread expectation that the central bank will cut interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point after markets close.\n\nElsewhere, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 index declined 0.3%, with some of the region's biggest banks posting declines.\n\nShares of troubled German lender Deutsche Bank fell 6.4% after it said efforts to overhaul its global operations had taken a large chunk out of its revenue. Banco Santander declined 4.7% as third-quarter profit fell 75%.\n\nIn the U.K., major stock indexes slipped after lawmakers agreed to hold an early election on Dec. 12 in an attempt to break the stalemate over Brexit. The FTSE 250 gauge slipped 0.4%.\n\nIn Asia, the Shanghai Composite Index fell 0.5%, while Japan's Nikkei 225 gauge dropped 0.6%.\n\n--Michael Wursthorn contributed to this article.\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 30, 2019 10:09 ET (14:09 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
