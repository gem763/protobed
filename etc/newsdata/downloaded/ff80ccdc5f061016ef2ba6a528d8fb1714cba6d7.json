With her help, he begins an acting career, which leads lickety-split to the top job at Paramount Pictures. He helps deliver masterworks like \u201cThe Godfather\u201d and \u201cChinatown.\u201d A cocaine blizzard, legal spats and financial ruin come next. In the final reel, a comeback.\n\nIf a screenwriter had invented Robert Evans, the script would have been tossed on the rejection pile as too tall a tale. But Mr. Evans, who died on Saturday at his home in Beverly Hills, Calif., was living proof that, at least in Hollywood, truth can still be stranger than fiction.\n\nIn a world full of big lives, he lived one of the biggest: boardroom fights, tabloid romances, tennis with Henry Kissinger, even a murder trial.\n\nMr. Evans was 89. His death was confirmed on Monday by a family spokeswoman, who gave no other details.", "description": "He was a force behind masterworks like \u201cThe Godfather\u201d and \u201cChinatown,\u201d and his own story \u2014 of unlikely success and drug-fueled decline \u2014 was the stuff of legend.", "authors": ["Brooks Barnes"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/29/obituaries/00evans-robert-toppix-copy/00evans-robert-toppix-copy-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
