From body painters to astronauts, here's a look at some of the tournament's off-field highlights.\n\nWarm welcome\n\nEven before a whistle had been blown and a ball had been kicked, Japan proved itself to be an excellent host.\n\nEach team received a personal welcome, which included a haka for New Zealand's All Blacks, traditional hymns for the Welsh team , and a national anthem sung in kilts for Scotland.\n\nEmbracing new cultures and new languages, local fans have made everyone feel at home.\n\nAn astronomical good luck\n\nRugby World Cup support has come from all corners of the globe -- and beyond.\n\nThat was the case, at least, for Italian astronaut Luca Parmitano, who sent a good luck message to the Italian team from the International Space Station.\n\nThe rugby-mad Parmitano was able to watch the Azzurri take on South Africa as this World Cup became the first to be broadcast in space.\n\nHaving recorded wins over Canada and Namibia, however, Italy was brought back down to earth with a crushing defeat by the Springboks.\n\nAn out of this world good luck message from @esa astronaut @astro_luca to @Federugby team.\n\n\n\nThe rugby mad Italian fan will get to watch #RSAvITA from the International Space Station thanks to a special broadcast feed produced by World Rugby on Friday. #RWC2019 pic.twitter.com/E5NjGOYz3R \u2014 Rugby World Cup (@rugbyworldcup) October 3, 2019\n\nBak-san's body paint\n\nCloser to home, one fan who has gained lots of attention throughout the World Cup group stages.\n\nJapanese superfan Bak-san has been spotted at various stages of the tournament sporting the jerseys of a number of different teams -- in paint.\n\nWith the help of his wife, who painstakingly paints the colors onto his torso in impressive detail, Bak-san hopes to \"wear\" the colors of all 20 teams before the end of the tournament.\n\nJUST WATCHED Meet the Rugby World Cup's body-painting superfan Replay More Videos ...
