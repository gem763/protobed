REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon/File Photo\n\n\u201cWhen I look at the growth of U.S. and Chinese companies, I feel strongly it\u2019s not good enough,\u201d Son said in an interview.\n\nSon is spending most of his time on the group\u2019s investing activities - centered on the $100 billion Vision Fund - leaving day-to-day running of core businesses such as telecoms operator SoftBank Corp (9434.T) to key lieutenants.\n\nWith portfolio company WeWork pulling its IPO and valuations at other key investments falling, SoftBank is struggling to attract investment to a second mammoth fund, Reuters reported last week.\n\nSon touched on favorite themes in the interview, including the \u201cextremely unsavory\u201d state of Japan and its \u201cgrass-eating\u201d entrepreneurs - a Japanese phrase that makes a negative comparison with more aggressive meat-eaters.\n\nBy contrast \u201cthere is technological innovation in the U.S., China is growing mammoth and Southeast Asia is booming,\u201d Son said.\n\nInvestor scepticism about the path to profitability for Vision Fund\u2019s investments in money-losing startups such as Uber Technologies (UBER.N) and Slack Technologies (WORK.N) has led to a market sell-off, with SoftBank Group shares on Monday closing down 30% from their July peak.\n\n\u201cCompanies like WeWork and Uber are criticized for being in the red, but in 10 years they\u2019ll be making substantial profits,\u201d Son said.\n\nSoftBank and other investors led a revolt against WeWork co-founder Adam Neumann, who was criticized for his hard partying ways and level of control over the company, culminating in him stepping down as CEO.\n\n\u201cRecently I have been telling founders to \u2018know your limit\u2019\u201d, Son said.\n\nWeWork, into which SoftBank has poured more than $10 billion, is considering slowing its expansion to try to rein in costs, sources told Reuters last month.\n\nAnother SoftBank-backed startup trying to shore up its finances, India\u2019s Oyo, is facing a backlash from hotel owners complaining of being blindsided by fee increases.\n\nSoftBank\u2019s performance is increasingly tied to the fortunes of these unproven startups, with the company likely to report chunky writedowns on many investments for the quarter ended September.\n\n\u201cI include myself when I say it is not the time for Japanese entrepreneurs to be making excuses,\u201d Son said.", "description": "SoftBank Group <9984.T> founder and CEO Masayoshi Son is \"embarrassed and flustered\" by his track record, he told Nikkei Business magazine, as the Japanese company comes under pressure from some investors for its bets on loss-making businesses.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191007&t=2&i=1437980930&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF960BW", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
