(Maddie Meyer/Getty Images)\n\nThere are plenty of things the Baltimore Orioles will want to carry over beyond the 2019 season that ended Sunday.\n\nLosses such as this, a 5-4 defeat to the Boston Red Sox that denied the Orioles (54-108) their first series sweep of the season, will not be counted among those things.\n\nFor the last time but certainly not the first, an Orioles lead disappeared once the bullpen door swung open, and even a late rally to tie the game and a fabulous catch by Stevie Wilkerson to rob a go-ahead home run in the eighth inning couldn\u2019t swing things back Baltimore\u2019s way.\n\nMookie Betts singled and scored from first for the winning run in the ninth on a confusing Rafael Devers single to right field off Dillon Tate to end it.\n\n\u201cWe play with a ton of heart, bounce back like we normally do and just fall a little bit short \u2014 which we\u2019ve done so many times this year,\u201d Orioles Manager Brandon Hyde said. \u201cI\u2019m proud of our guys. Proud of the effort. Love the way we played this series. Even though that team\u2019s not going to the playoffs, it\u2019s still a really good team and a really good lineup, and we faced a guy going for his 20th win today. They had the varsity club in there trying to get it for him, and we just did a great job of competing.\u201d\n\n[A year into a rebuild, the Orioles have been shaken up and (they hope) straightened out]\n\nEven as the Orioles denied former farmhand Eduardo Rodriguez his 20th win, the bizarre end to the game on a single through the shift into shallow center field spoiled what could have been an uplifting end to the season for them.\n\n\u201cI think that second hop took a funny hop on Richie [Martin]; it really boomeranged,\u201d Hyde said. It was a tough play for him, and Wilkerson was playing no doubles, playing a little deeper than normal. He had to sprint in and Mookie with a really instinctual play. He\u2019s a great player, great instincts. Hopefully we\u2019ll learn from that and get the ball in a little quicker. Hats off to them, and hats off to Mookie for making a really good play.\u201d\n\nSaid Wilkerson: \u201cI\u2019ve got to do a better job of picking it up and just getting the ball in. Obviously, it\u2019s something I\u2019ll learn from but not the way you want to end it.\u201d\n\nThe Orioles had rallied for a 4-4 tie in the eighth thanks to an RBI single by Jonathan Villar. Evan Phillips, who escaped a bases-loaded, no-outs jam in the sixth, allowed a run in the seventh.\n\nWith the game tied and two outs in the eighth inning, Jackie Bradley Jr. hit a deep drive to right field that Wilkerson tracked to the wall, jumping into it for a game-saving catch.\n\nHyde said he \u201ccouldn\u2019t believe it\u201d when Wilkerson lifted his glove up to show he had the ball.\n\n\u201cI thought that ball was 30 rows in off the bat,\u201d Hyde said. \u201c. . . It was just one of the better catches I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d", "description": "Baltimore finishes 54-108 after Boston wins, 5-4, with a weird walkoff single.", "authors": ["Jon Meoli", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/RIr8-HZVb10XlB40HrBv_C9tifI=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OVDQMHHDFII6TJXIQ5M4LR7WBA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
