We just don\u2019t know about it because they haven\u2019t paid us a visit in 10 million years.\n\nThe study, published last month in The Astronomical Journal, posits that intelligent extraterrestrial life could be taking its time to explore the galaxy, harnessing star systems\u2019 movement to make star-hopping easier.\n\nThe work is a new response to a question known as the Fermi Paradox, which asks why we haven\u2019t detected signs of extraterrestrial intelligence.\n\nThe paradox was first posed by physicist Enrico Fermi, who famously asked: \u201cWhere is everybody?\u201d\n\ncaption The Gaia spacecraft maps the stars of the Milky Way. source ESA\n\nFermi was questioning the feasibility of travel between stars, but since then, his query has come to represent doubts about the very existence of extraterrestrials. Astrophysicist Michael Hart explored the question formally when he argued in a 1975 paper that there has been plenty of time for intelligent life to colonize the Milky Way in the 13.6 billion years since the galaxy first formed, yet we\u2019ve heard nothing from them. Hart concluded that there must be no other advanced civilizations in our galaxy.\n\nThe new study offers a different perspective on the question: Maybe aliens are just taking their time and being strategic, the authors suggest.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t account for motion of stars when you try to solve this problem, you\u2019re basically left with one of two solutions,\u201d Jonathan Carroll-Nellenback, a computational scientist and the study\u2019s lead author, told Business Insider. \u201cEither nobody leaves their planet, or we are in fact the only technological civilization in the galaxy.\u201d\n\nStars (and the planets around them) orbit the center of the galaxy on different paths at different speeds. As they do, they occasionally pass each other, Carroll-Nellenback pointed out. So aliens could be waiting for their next destination to come closer to them, his study says.\n\nIn that case, civilizations would take longer to spread across the stars than Hart estimated. So they may not have reached us yet \u2060- or maybe they did, long before humans evolved.\n\nA new idea about interstellar travel\n\ncaption Several antennas that are part of the Allen Telescope Array, radio telescopes that search for signals from alien life. source SETI Institute\n\nResearchers have sought to answer the Fermi Paradox in a number of ways \u2013 studies have investigated the possibility that all alien life forms in oceans below a planet\u2019s surface, and posited that civilizations may get undone by their unsustainability before accomplishing any interstellar travel. There\u2019s also the \u201czoo hypothesis,\u201d which imagines that Milky Way societies have decided not to contact us for the same reasons that we have nature preserves or maintain protections for some uncontacted indigenous peoples.\n\nA 2018 Oxford University study, meanwhile, suggested that there\u2019s a roughly 2-in-5 chance we\u2019re alone in our galaxy and a 1-in-3 chance we\u2019re alone in the entire cosmos.\n\nBut the authors of the newest study point out that previous research hasn\u2019t accounted for a crucial fact of our galaxy: It moves. Just as planets orbit stars, star systems orbit the galactic center. Our solar system, for example, orbits the galaxy every 230 million years.\n\nIf civilizations arise in star systems far away from the others (like our own, which is in the backwaters of the galaxy), they could make the trip shorter by waiting until their orbital path brings them closer to a habitable star system, the study says. Then once settled in that new system, the aliens could wait again for an optimal travel distance to make another hop, and so on.\n\ncaption Proxima Centauri, the closest star to our sun, is 4.25 light-years away from Earth. source ESA/Hubble/NASA\n\nIn this scenario, aliens aren\u2019t jet-setting across the galaxy. They\u2019re just waiting long enough for their star to get close to another star with a habitable planet.\n\n\u201cIf long enough is a billion years, well then that\u2019s one solution to the Fermi paradox,\u201d Carroll-Nellenback said. \u201cHabitable worlds are so rare that you have to wait longer than any civilization is expected to last before another one comes in range.\u201d\n\nThe Milky Way could be full of settled star systems\n\nTo explore the scenarios in which aliens could exist, the researchers used numerical models to simulate a civilization\u2019s spread across the galaxy. They factored in a variety of possibilities for a hypothetical civilization\u2019s proximity to new star systems, the range and speed of its interstellar probes, and the launch rate of those probes.\n\ncaption An illustration of NASA\u2019s Voyager spacecraft drifting through space.

So all our predictions are based on our own behavior.\n\nBut even with this limitation, the researchers found that the Milky Way could be filled with settled star systems that we don\u2019t know about. That still held true when they used conservative estimates of the speed and frequency of aliens\u2019 interstellar travel.\n\n\u201cEvery system could be habitable and could be settled, but they wouldn\u2019t visit us because they\u2019re not close enough,\u201d Carroll-Nellenback said, though he added that just because that\u2019s possible doesn\u2019t make it likely.\n\ncaption Earth-like planets have varying sizes and compositions. source NASA/JPL-Caltech/R. Hurt (SSC-Caltech)\n\nSo far, we\u2019ve detected about 4,000 planets outside our solar system and none have been shown to host life. But we haven\u2019t looked that hard: There are at least 100 billion stars in the Milky Way, and even more planets. One recent study estimated that up to 10 billion of those planets could be Earth-like.\n\nSo the study authors wrote that concluding that none of those planets hold life would be like looking at a pool-sized amount of ocean water and finding no dolphins, then deciding that the entire ocean has no dolphins.\n\nAliens may have visited Earth in the past\n\nAnother key element in debates about alien life is what Hart called \u201cFact A\u201d: There are no interstellar visitors on Earth now, and there is no evidence of past visits.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean they were never here, the authors of the new study say.\n\ncaption A group of protesters march in front of the General Accounting Office (GAO) in Washington, D.C. on March 29, 1995 to raise awareness about an examination being conducted by the GAO for documents about a weather balloon crash at Roswell, New Mexico in 1947.

They pointed to previous research suggesting that we may not be able to detect evidence of past alien visits.\n\nIt\u2019s even possible that aliens have passed near Earth since we\u2019ve been here, but decided not to visit. The paper calls this the \u201cAurora effect,\u201d named for Kim Stanley Robinson\u2019s novel \u201cAurora.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, aliens might not want to visit a planet that already has life, the authors said. To assume that they would, they added, would be a \u201cnaive projection\u201d of a human tendency to equate expansion with conquest.\n\nThe study accounted for all of these considerations \u2013 the calculations assumed that alien civilizations would only settle a fraction of the habitable worlds they encountered. Still, the researchers said, if there are enough habitable worlds, aliens could easily have spread across the galaxy by now.\n\nThere\u2019s still much more to learn\n\nFor now, the researchers don\u2019t think we should get discouraged by any perceived silence from the universe.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019re alone,\u201d Carroll-Nellenback said. \u201cIt just means that habitable planets are probably rare and hard to get to.\u201d\n\nIn the next few years, our ability to detect and observe other potentially habitable planets is expected to improve dramatically as new telescopes get built and launched into space.\n\ncaption The primary mirror of NASA\u2019s James Webb Space Telescope consists of 18 hexagonal mirrors. source NASA/Chris Gunn\n\nThe Kepler telescope made leaps and bounds in the search for planets that might host life in our galaxy. In Earth\u2019s orbit today, the Hubble Space Telescope and Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) are continuing the search. NASA is also building the James Webb Space Telescope, which may be able to see as far through space and time as the Big Bang. It\u2019s slated to launch in 2021.\n\nOf course, what would really improve scientists\u2019 ability to estimate the probability that we\u2019re alone in the universe would be more data on the speed or ranges of interstellar probes. A better sense of how long hypothetical alien civilizations last would be useful, too.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in desperate need of some data points,\u201d Carroll-Nellenback said.", "description": "Business Insider - The answer to the Fermi Paradox could be that aliens have already visited Earth, a study says.
