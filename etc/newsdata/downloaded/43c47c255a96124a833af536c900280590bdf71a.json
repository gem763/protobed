So I am a strong believer that there must be life elsewhere.\n\n\u201cLife doesn\u2019t just mean a green man coming to you, life started way before animals were crawling on the surface of earth.\u201d\n\nAccording to the professor, he is certain that humans will have detected alien life in 100 years' time.\n\nHowever, he is convinced it will happen much sooner than that, once we have built more advanced technology capable of detecting life on distant planets.\n\nProfessor Queloz, who discovered the first planet outside our solar system while still a PhD student, won the Nobel Prize alongside fellow researcher Michel Mayor, his PhD supervisor at Princeton.\n\nIn 1995, Professor Queloz and Professor Mayor discovered the exoplanet 51 Pegasi b using the Doppler spectroscopy technique, which measures wobbles of a star as a planet orbits around it.\n\nSince their initial discovery, more than 4,100 additional exoplanets have been found.\n\nThe Nobel Prize was awarded to the scientists for \u201ccontributions to our understanding of the evolution of the universe and Earth\u2019s place in the cosmos\u201d, with half of the prize awarded to James Peebles, for \u201ctheoretical discoveries in physical cosmology\u201d.\n\nRead more\n\nNobel Prize in Physics awarded for planet discoveries", "description": "A Nobel prize-winning astronomer has predicted that humans will find evidence of alien life in the next 30 years.On Tuesday, Professor Didier Queloz, from Switzerland, said he was \u201cconvinced\u201d of the existence of extraterrestrial life after winning the 2019 Nobel Prize in Physics.", "authors": ["Chelsea Ritschel"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5TdOcEDMxrVrkqHaVBfFRg--~B/aD0zNTE7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/b5e405c2d6719400089f62d5d5324b25", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
