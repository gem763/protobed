The worst crime is to make the viewer feel the cringe of secondhand embarrassment.\n\nFifteen-year-old Lily mostly posts niche memes about high-school swimming under the handle @420.gucci.gangg, but she\u2019s also done some look-alike videos about the actor Leighton Meester, known for playing Blair Waldorf on Gossip Girl, which premiered when Lily was 4 years old.\n\n\u201cI got a comment that I looked like\u2014I don\u2019t even know how to pronounce her name\u2014\u201d (she pronounced it wrong, but it\u2019s fine) \u201cfrom Gossip Girl? I\u2019ve never seen the show before,\u201d she told me. \u201cSo I looked her up, and I don\u2019t see [the comparison], but a lot of people do. So I ended up making the video, and a lot of people liked it.\u201d She didn\u2019t do anything special to make herself look more like Meester, but she did use TikTok\u2019s \u201cBeauty\u201d filter, which she says \u201cmost, if not all\u201d other celebrity look-alike videos use too.\n\nRead: Gossip Girl\u2019s prophetic relationship with technology\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s crazy to think you look like someone that you look up to so much,\u201d she says, about a famous person she\u2019d never heard of before. \u201cIn the simplest way, it\u2019s very cool. It\u2019s just cool to see common people who look like these stars.\u201d\n\nAccording to Sales, Lily\u2019s age is relevant here. \u201cThis is the first generation that [has] never known the days when there appeared to be a boundary [between regular people and celebrities],\u201d she said. \u201cAll they know is, That is me, I\u2019m famous too; I have 600,000 followers on TikTok.\u201d\n\nThe similarities don\u2019t stop at numbers, she argued. Just about everyone who spends significant time on social-sharing platforms like TikTok has a persistent celebrity-like experience of thinking, What am I going to do to market myself next? What story am I going to tell to get people interested in me next? To her mind, these kids are celebrities. \u201cA lot of them. In the new way celebrity exists in the world.\u201d\n\nBut this isn\u2019t the first time that the definition of celebrity has been muddled. In a 1984 column for The New York Times, Barbara Goldsmith argued that \u201cthe public appetite for celebrity\u201d had grown so ravenous that the media were manufacturing famous people, just as the U.S. Mint might run off bills willy-nilly once the country left the gold standard. Magazines were more than keeping up with their readers\u2019 demands \u2014 they were ready to \u201coutrun them, creating new needs we never knew existed.\u201d Of particular ire to her was People, which published stories about movie stars alongside macabre human interest stories about neo-Nazis, serial murderers, and people who would choose to kayak very long distances. \u201cThe ersatz and the real appear side by side, and the willingness to distinguish between them has been abdicated,\u201d she lamented.", "description": "Memes and moments come and go on TikTok, but its fascination with celebrity look-alikes is forever.", "authors": ["Kaitlyn Tiffany"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/AP_90124525156/facebook.jpg?1568918019", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
