Somerville did not have a criminal record prior to the judge\u2019s ruling.\n\nHe was also put on probation for a year and ordered to pay a $223 fine, write an apology letter of no less than 100 words and complete 150 hours of community service -- which included reporting to the jury office once a week to have a 10-minute discussion about the importance of jury duty, according to the records.\n\nOn Friday, Judge John S. Kastrenakes, the same judge who sentenced him in the first place, voided the order of guilty, meaning Somerville's criminal record is gone. Somerville had already spent the time in jail.\n\nBrynn Anderson/AP\n\nKastrenakes also decreased the probation to three months and the community service hours to 30.\n\nKastrenakes declined to comment about the case to ABC News, citing privacy laws, but said he wished he could speak \"because I don't think everybody got the facts right.\"\n\n\u201cI just use it as a lesson learned,\u201d Somerville told reporters at the courthouse Friday. \"I had to get punished. I should have came back. I take it as a learning experience.\"\n\nAs for his time in jail, Somerville said he \u201cdidn\u2019t feel comfortable at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cI never been to jail,\" he said. \"I\u2019m not made for jail. Jail\u2019s not made for me.\"", "description": "Deandre Somerville , 21, was jailed for 10 days after he missed jury duty because he overslept.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/somerville-ap-er-191005_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
