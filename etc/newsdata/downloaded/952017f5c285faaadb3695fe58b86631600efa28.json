Molnar, who was sentenced to a 16-month detention training order, was friends with Yousef, who he said he killed in self-defence. His stint at a Young Offenders Institute is a world away from an upbringing that saw him attend several exclusive schools, including the \u00a333,000-a-year Ellesmere College. Molnar loved rugby, regularly featuring and impressing in school teams. His victim Yousef, though from a poor background, went to a prestigious school and was a straight-A student who dreamed of becoming a surgeon. The schools Molnar attended are seen as a conveyor belt to Oxford and Cambridge - but he shunned his privilege to instead embrace a very different life. Despite the advantages of a good family and good education, Molnar became fixated with knives, living out 'idiotic fantasies' of being a middle-class gangster, his trial heard. One detective described him and a second defendant as, 'rich kids who have never had to live in the real world'. Despite the money spent on his expensive education, Molnar did not 'get on' with his family or appreciate his parents. He said he could pick his friends but not his parents. Molnar sported a south central LA style neck bandana, keeping his weed and 'shank' or knife in an Armani man bag. He thought knives were 'cool' and routinely smoked cannabis from the age of 15, telling the jury at his trial most of his peers smoked the drug and it was 'socially acceptable'. Videos of him posing with knives were just because people his age video everything they do, he said. One ominous clip recovered by police showed Yousef playfully taunting Molnar, repeating: 'Where's ya shank?' This obsession with becoming some kind of 'middle class gangster' eventually led to the tragic confrontation where Yousef lost his life.\n\nIt is accompanied by drill music from notorious London gang, 1011, whose members have been jailed for knife crime.\n\nDuring Molnar's difficult teenage years at Cheadle Hulme School, his mother, Stephanie Molnar, built up a successful business.\n\nYorkshire-born Mrs Molnar grew up in South Africa and studied in the UK, with degrees in biology and business from Bristol, London and Warwick universities.\n\nShe worked in scientific software before becoming a marketing manager, and in 2001 co-founded the Elmscot Group - which runs children's nurseries and out-of-school clubs in Cheshire.\n\nShe found inspiration for the business, she said, because as a working mother with young children, she struggled to find the right nursery for her own children, Lexi, a one-time Miss Cheshire contestant, and younger brother Joshua.\n\nMolnar had been initially enrolled at \u00a32,600 a term Hale Preparatory School, which takes children aged from four to 11.\n\nHe struggled with the 'teaching methods' there, according to his family, and was moved aged five to another school until the age of 11.\n\nThe nursery and after-school club business co-founded by his mother now employs more than 225 people, providing early years childcare and education for around 1,700 children.\n\nOn July 1 this year, Stephanie Molnar resigned as a director of Elmscot Group and other associated nurseries, according to documents lodged with Companies House.\n\nJoshua's father, Mark Lazlo Molnar - the son of a Hungarian refugee who was born and brought up in south Wales, is a management consultant and listed as an honorary general secretary of the Cheshire Lawn Tennis Association.\n\nHe is also listed as a director of Hale Village Tennis Club.\n\nNow, Molnar's mother Stephanie has spoken out after her rugby-playing son was named for the first time, describing the events in March as a tragedy and sharing her sympathy for Yousef's family.\n\nShe says that her son accepts responsibility for his friend's killing and will have to live with it for the rest of his life.\n\nHis parents have admitted that, since the killing, they have agonised over whether they could have prevented it by encouraging their son to make different decisions in the lead up to the night in question.\n\nMother Stephanie said she felt compelled to speak up after seeing rumours on social media and newspapers about her son.\n\nShe also described him as 'no different than any other 17-year-old in the area'.\n\nMolnar sported a south central LA style neck bandana, keeping his weed and 'shank' or knife in an Armani man bag\n\nMother Stephanie said she felt compelled to speak up after seeing rumours on social media and newspapers about her son\n\nStephanie told the Sunday Times: 'Nobody can know the detail of everything that your kids get up to. All you can do is rely on them to make positive choices based on the values that have been instilled in them throughout their upbringing.'\n\nYousef, who was from an Anglo-Lebanese family from Burnage, south Manchester, had won a scholarship to the prestigious \u00a312,000-a-year Manchester Grammar School.\n\nThe court heard how hours before the stabbing, Boy B arranged a \u00a345 cannabis deal and the teenagers planned to rob the drug dealer, a 'soft target'.\n\nBut the robbery went wrong and Yousef and Boy B fled, leaving Molnar to take a beating.\n\nAfter they met up again, Molnar then later pushed Yousef who called him a 'p****' and punched him in the face.\n\nMolnar told the jury Yousef pulled out a knife and he responded by also taking out a knife and his victim was accidentally stabbed.\n\nVideos of him posing with knives was just because people his age video everything they do, he said\n\nSpeaking about the killing and the subsequent trial, Molnar's mother Stephanie said: 'Circumstances on the night of March 2 led to our son Joshua accidentally killing his friend Yousef with a knife whilst defending himself against a knife. He was found not guilty to the charges of murder and manslaughter, based on self-defence, in a unanimous verdict.\n\n'The events of that night were a tragedy. These were three friends going out on a Saturday. They should all still be here to lead fulfilling lives but they are not.\n\n'I cannot imagine what Yousef's parents and family must be going through as they try to come to terms with this.\n\n'Joshua fully accepts responsibility for Yousef's death in the act of self-defence and the impact of this acceptance is massive.\n\n'He will have to live with the responsibility of his role in this for the rest of his life.\n\n'We are also acutely aware that the hurt and loss that Yousef's family is experiencing are infinitely greater than anything we are going through and nothing I can say can make up for or change that.\n\nYousef's furious father could be seen screaming at police officers outside the court after the verdict\n\nYousef's mother Deborah Makki, a psychiatric nurse, planted a tree in his memory on the grounds of his school in Manchester earlier this year\n\n'There were no winners in this case.\n\n'We fully support all the positive steps to celebrate Yousef's life and anything positive in the future that can come from this tragedy is something we would welcome and contribute to in whatever way possible.'\n\nHowever, her words were slammed by Yousef's sister, who described them as 'self-serving'.\n\nJade Akoum, 28, told the Sunday Telegraph: 'I thought a normal thing to do would be to apologise and lay low. I wouldn't want their help and I don't want to forgive them. They haven't once reached out to us.\n\n'Saying they want to celebrate Yousef's life? Your son killed my brother.'\n\nYousef's family reacted with fury after the controversial verdict in March with his father Ghaleb Makki shouting: 'F*** you! Where's the justice for my son! Where's the justice?'.\n\nBoy B had bought the knives online using a false name and had them posted from China to a friend's address, the court heard.\n\nOfficers later found a dark coloured 'flick knife' behind a low boundary wall near the scene of the killing plus a silver coloured lock knife in some bushes and recovered a flick knife from down a grid.\n\nIn court, Molinar broke down in tears and said: 'I got more annoyed. I [took] it out straight away, I don't really know what I did, kind of lifted my arm up. I didn't realise anything had happened at first.'", "description": "Joshua Molnar, who stabbed Yousef Makki to death, has been revealed as a rugby-loving student who attended the \u00a333,000-a-year private school Ellesmere College in Shropshire.", "authors": ["Danyal Hussain For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/11/19358292-0-image-a-5_1570357496165.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
