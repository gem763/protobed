Mr Ellesmere agreed with this assessment.\n\n\u201cOur first tip to create a beautifully balanced gin and tonic is ice, and plenty of it,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe colder the drink, the less dilution and more flavour there is.\u201d\n\nMr Conigliaro also made the same suggestion, stating that an individual making a gin and tonic should fill the glass with large, freshly frozen ice cubes before preparing the garnish.\n\nTonic\n\nWhen concocting a gin and tonic, choosing the right tonic to include is of the utmost importance, according to Mr Harper.\n\n\u201cSomething that is key is the tonic,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf three quarters of your gin and tonic is tonic you should be mixing with the best.\u201d\n\nMr Carter explained that in his eyes, the ideal proportions for a perfect gin and tonic is one part gin and two parts tonic.\n\nMr Conigliaro went into great detail providing comprehensive steps on how to prepare a refreshing gin and tonic.\n\n\u201cAdd 50ml of your chosen gin to the ice and a good splash of bubbly tonic water - bubbles are the key to bringing out the full flavour and aromas of a gin and tonic,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cGive the drink a brief mix, add some more ice cubes and fill the rest of the glass with tonic water before adding your garnish to serve.\"\n\nFor all the latest news on gin, click here.", "description": "A gin and tonic is a refreshing beverage best enjoyed with lots of ice\u00a0and a slice of lime.
