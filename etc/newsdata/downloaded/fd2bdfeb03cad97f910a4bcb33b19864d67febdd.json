Three things are now working in Bank of America\u2019s favor: Yields are going the right way, the recession scare triggered by the yield curve inversion has faded, and the bank plans to retire a huge load of BAC stock in coming quarters. Let\u2019s dive in.\n\nStock Yields Surge\n\nAll summer, bank stocks had been slumping. It wasn\u2019t hard to see why. Bond yields kept going down and down. Both overseas and at home, yields dropped to multi-year \u2014 in some cases all-time \u2014 lows. This is bad news for banks, who prefer higher interest rates, all else held equal.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBanks have already been paying depositors next to nothing on savings and checking accounts for years. So they get little benefit from rates going down because they aren\u2019t going to save money on their funding costs. Meanwhile, the rates they can charge on mortgages and other loans plunged.\n\nHowever, it appears that we\u2019ve hit an inflection point. Over the past two weeks, the 10-year Treasury Yield has gone from a trough under 1.5% to nearly 2%. That\u2019s the equivalent of two 25-basis point Fed rate hikes worth of movement. Similarly, the 30-year yield has gone from 1.9% to 2.4% over the same stretch.\n\nThat, in turn, will allow banks to make similar adjustments to their mortgage and other long-term loan rates in coming weeks. This will lead to a higher net interest margin (NIM) for banks in general and Bank of America stock in particular.\n\n\n\n\n\nGoodbye Yield Curve Inversion\n\nOn a related note, the infamous yield curve inversion has gone away. Well, to be technical, it\u2019s mostly gone away, depending on which parts of the yield curve you look at in particular. In general, however, long-term interest rates are now higher than short-term rates. This is the normal state of affairs, and has both a positive effect on the general economic outlook and the banking sector\u2019s earnings. It\u2019s no coincidence that BAC stock has taken off as the yield curve reverted.\n\nThere\u2019s also the sentiment factor to consider. The media loves scary headlines, and the yield curve inversion was a good one. As they so frequently said, yield curve inversions, historically, have almost always been followed by recessions. And that\u2019s true. But generally a recession takes 12-18 months to arrive following a yield curve inversion. The fact that rates inverted this summer means we shouldn\u2019t expect a big economic downturn until at least fall 2020.\n\nOn top of that, there\u2019s a decent chance the yield curve indicator won\u2019t work this time. Yes, I know it\u2019s risky to say \u201cthis time is different.\u201d However, in the past, far fewer people watched this indicator for a sign of recession. Now, with everyone talking about it, policy-makers \u2014 including the Fed \u2014 have adjusted, easing monetary conditions aggressively to offset the potential danger.\n\nThe fact that everyone saw the yield curve inversion and started planning for it could mean it won\u2019t have the predictive power that it used to when it wasn\u2019t a commonly-watched recession indicator.\n\nIn any case, the yield curve is already back to a healthy normal state and is getting steeper (which is better for BAC stock) with almost every passing day. It\u2019s still worth watching as conditions could worsen on this front again. But for now, it seems people got overly worried about it.\n\nBank of America Stock-Specific Upside\n\nWhile you can make a great case for the banking sector in general \u2014 and I\u2019ve bought bank stocks heavily this summer \u2014 let\u2019s turn to BAC stock in particular. The most appealing thing about BAC stock is its massive capital return.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Since early 2018, on four separate occasions, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) stock has traded up to at least $30 per share.
