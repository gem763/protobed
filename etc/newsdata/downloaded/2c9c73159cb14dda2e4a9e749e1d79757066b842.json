REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst/File Photo\n\nThe case, which will be argued before the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan, is one of several legal battles in which the Republican president is seeking to shield his personal finances from scrutiny.\n\nIn August, Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance, a Democrat, subpoenaed Trump\u2019s personal and corporate tax returns from 2011 to 2018 and other records from the president\u2019s longtime accounting firm Mazars USA.\n\nThe subpoena was part of a criminal probe into Trump and his family business. The scope of that probe is not publicly known.\n\nTrump sued Vance\u2019s office in Manhattan federal court to block the subpoena, arguing that as a sitting president, he cannot be subject to criminal investigation.\n\nU.S. District Judge Victor Marrero on Oct. 7 threw out Trump\u2019s lawsuit, calling his claim that he was immune from investigation \u201crepugnant to the nation\u2019s governmental structure and constitutional values.\u201d\n\nVance\u2019s investigation comes amid an impeachment inquiry and investigations into Trump\u2019s finances by Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nEarlier this month, a federal appeals court in Washington backed an effort by a House Oversight Committee to obtain Trump\u2019s financial records from Mazars.\n\nThe 2nd Circuit has put Marrero\u2019s Oct. 7 order on hold until it considers the case. Vance\u2019s office has agreed not to enforce its subpoena for 10 days if the court rules in its favor, to give Trump time to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice has weighed in on the case, arguing that Vance must make a \u201cheightened and particularized showing\u201d that he needs the documents for his investigation.\n\nThough the Department stopped short of saying Vance could not get the returns under any circumstances, it said it was \u201cunlikely\u201d he could demonstrate an immediate need for them because the U.S. Constitution bars states from prosecuting a sitting president.\n\nTwo other House committees are seeking to obtain Trump\u2019s financial records from Deutsche Bank AG and Capital One Financial Corp. The 2nd Circuit is currently considering a lawsuit by Trump to block them from getting those records, which do not include his tax returns.\n\nThe House impeachment inquiry focuses on the president\u2019s request in a July phone call for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate Democratic former vice president Joe Biden, a top contender for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.", "description": "Lawyers for U.S. President Donald Trump and New York state prosecutors trying to obtain Trump's tax returns are set to face off in a federal appeals court Wednesday.", "authors": ["Brendan Pierson", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1444069001&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M0S5", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
