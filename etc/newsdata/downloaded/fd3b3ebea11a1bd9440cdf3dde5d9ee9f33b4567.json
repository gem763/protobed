They left with the expectation of meeting again later this week.\n\nThere was no immediate decision other than to wait for further developments in London and to initiate procedural steps for the new Brexit deal to be approved legally and sent to the European Parliament for ratification.\n\nIn the U.K., the second letter prompted some furious reaction from Johnson's political opponents, who said that he was acting to undermine the law. Some suggested legal action could be taken against him should he appear to be advocating for EU27 leaders to deny the extension request.\n\nNext steps\n\nLegal or not \u2014 in reality, such lobbying would have little impact in Brussels.\n\nThe EU27, anticipating further ratification difficulties in London, were already calculating how best to use the continuing British political chaos to their best advantage \u2014 mainly by using it to further convince the British public that Brussels has never obstructed the U.K.'s departure and is not responsible for the delay.\n\nBeyond cementing EU victory in the so-called blame game, diplomat and officials said EU leaders' main goal has not changed: to do everything possible to eliminate any risk that the U.K. would leave in a chaotic and economically disastrous no-deal scenario. They also don't want to be drawn into the middle of the domestic political fight in the U.K.\n\nSome EU officials and diplomats said that they expect leaders to move slowly, given that there are still 11 days until the Oct. 31 deadline and that events in Westminster \u2014 very much outside of the EU's control \u2014 could make the extension request irrelevant.\n\nJohnson has made clear he wants to move forward with legislation needed for the U.K. to depart on Oct. 31, and is hoping to soon hold a so-called meaningful vote on the Withdrawal Agreement, perhaps on Tuesday.\n\n\"We have time,\" one EU diplomat said.\n\nAfter Sunday morning's meeting, another diplomat said: \"The EU decision regarding the next steps will be taken after the clarification of the situation in the British parliament.\"\n\nOfficials are grappling with the hole in the budget that will be left by the U.K.'s departure.\n\nWhile some EU27 leaders, notably French President Emmanuel Macron, have expressed frustration with British dithering and urged that the Oct. 31 deadline be respected, any overt pressure, including threats of refusing to grant an extension, would risk alienating Johnson's opponents, including members of the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats who oppose Brexit, not to mention avidly pro-EU forces like the Scottish National Party.", "description": "European Union leaders are considering Boris Johnson's Brexit delay request and how to turn it to their own maximum advantage \u2014 though some are wondering if there\u2019s any advantage left to gain.
