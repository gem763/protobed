Trysta Krick reacts to all the biggest games and moments from a wild weekend in the NFL. USA TODAY\n\nOn the heels of their 0-5 start and yet another blowout loss, the Washington Redskins have fired coach Jay Gruden, the team announced Monday.\n\n\u202aWith a six-year run that featured a 35-49-1 record and one playoff appearance, Gruden was the longest-tenured coach of Daniel Snyder\u2019s 20-year ownership of Washington\u2019s football team.\n\nHowever, that run produced only two winning seasons and just one playoff appearance.\n\n\"Through the first five games of the 2019 season, the team has clearly not performed up to expectations, and we all share in that responsibility,\" the team said in a statement announcing Gruden's firing. \"Moving forward we are committed to doing all that we can collectively as an organization to turn things around and give our Redskins fans and alumni a team they can be proud of in 2019 and beyond.\"\n\nOffensive line coach Bill Callahan will take over on an interim basis, according to a person with knowledge of the situation. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because the team had not officially announced the move.\n\nFollowing Sunday\u2019s 33-7 loss to New England, a game in which fans of the visiting Patriots overwhelming dominated the home crowd in number, Gruden acknowledged that he had received ample opportunities to turn the Redskins around. But he said as long as his key to Redskins Park still worked Monday morning, he would keep working to improve the team.\n\nWashington head coach Jay Gruden walks off the field after the Redskins loss to the New England Patriots on Sunday, Oct. 6.

But he also was hamstrung by organizational dysfunction and rampant injuries.\n\nHe went through three defensive coordinators and seven starting quarterbacks.\n\nHis playoff appearance in 2015 was one of only four postseason bids for Washington since Snyder purchased the team in 1999.", "description": "After a six-year run that featured a 35-49-1 record and one playoff appearance, the Redskins fired coach Jay Gruden.
