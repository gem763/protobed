Why would we fix something that isn\u2019t broken?\u201d asks one Biden hand at the campaign\u2019s Philadelphia headquarters. \u201cVoters know Joe Biden, so we don\u2019t have to introduce ourselves to voters.\u201d Where his rivals have to subject themselves to voters\u2019 constant probing, the thinking goes, Biden can go to voters he already knows to ask them for campaign contributions. In the last week alone, he\u2019s picked up checks in Houston, Beaumont, Texas, Dallas, Miami, suburban Washington, D.C., and Chicago.\n\nAt least to this point, the scaled-back strategy appears to be paying off. Biden has strengthening his position as the leader of a jumbled pack of hopefuls, expanding his already considerable coalition and bedeviling rivals who had expected the front-runner\u2019s support to collapse. An NBC News/ Wall Street Journal poll released Wednesday showed Biden had expanded his lead by five percentage points since July. Some 41% of Democrats in the same survey say they\u2019d be comfortable with Biden atop the ticket, compared to 35% who say the same of Elizabeth Warren, his closest rival. Biden may be more durable than his detractors had expected.\n\nIn fact, Biden may be getting stronger as the campaign goes on. In April, Biden led in just one of the 19 subsets CNN pollsters released results for, and that was among self-identified moderates. He was tied in two others \u2014 non-white voters and those earning less than $50,000 a year. The September CNN survey found Biden in a stronger position, ahead in 18 of the 26 slices of the electorate. (Biden still lags Warren among women, liberals, those who are \u201cextremely enthusiastic about the race,\u201d all college graduates and white college graduates. He trails Sanders among Hispanics, voters under 50 and voters under 45.)", "description": "", "authors": ["Philip Elliott", "Time.Com Joe-Biden-Democratic-Primary-Strategy"], "top_image": ""}
