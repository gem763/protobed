They accused Franco and two other men associated with his production company and school of sex discrimination, sexual harassment, fraud and other wrongdoing.\n\nFranco and his colleagues were \"dangling the opportunity to aspiring actors of employment in film and television,\" the lawsuit stated.\n\n\"Franco's targets were even duped to pay for their exploitation through a fraudulent 'acting school' (Studio 4) designed to benefit Franco and his production companies wherein employment opportunities for women supposedly increased when they agreed to overt sexual acts, nudity and performing in sex scenes - often in an orgy type setting,\" the lawsuit said.\n\nStudents were encouraged to pay $750 to join a sex scenes master class at the school and had to audition nude or partially nude, the lawsuit said.\n\nAfter completing the class, Tither-Kaplan was offered a role in a project in which Franco appeared in an orgy scene with women. He removed plastic guards covering actresses' vaginas while simulating oral sex, the suit said.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks class-action status on behalf of other women who attended the school, and seeks unspecified monetary damages.\n\nThe lawsuit also cited a comment made by Franco in early January 2018 in an appearance on Stephen Colbert's \"The Late Show\" days after he faced accusations of sexual misconduct on Twitter. He was asked on the show to comment on accusations made against him on social media.\n\nThe lawsuit, cited his comment, \"If I have done something wrong, I will fix it. I have to.\" The lawsuit said that Franco and others had \"committed egregious wrongs\" to student actors and had \"done nothing to fix these wrongs.\"\n\nFranco's best-known films include \"127 hours,\" \"Spider-Man\" and \"The Disaster Artist.\" At the Golden Globes ceremony on Jan. 7, 2018, Franco wore a Time's Up movement pin supporting victims of sexual harassment.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Alex Dobuzinskis; editing by Bill Tarrant and Leslie Adler)", "description": "Two women filed a civil lawsuit against Hollywood actor James Franco on Thursday, accusing him of running a bogus film school where young women eager to advance their acting careers were duped into auditioning nude or shooting explicit sex scenes.
