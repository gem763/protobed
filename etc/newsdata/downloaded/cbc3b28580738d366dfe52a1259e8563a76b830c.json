Murray-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe news followed a report by ESPN\u2019s Adam Schefter earlier Saturday that Osemele and the NFL Players Association were considering specific action against a team doctor after it was revealed that damage to his torn labrum was more extensive than first thought. Osemele had surgery Friday.\n\n\u201cPer Kelechi Osemele\u2019s agents: Osemele\u2019s surgery went well yesterday, but damage to shoulder was more extensive than anticipated,\u201d tweeted Schefter. \u201cHis representatives and NFLPA are now considering specific action against the Jets\u2019 team doctor for violations of State Medical Board Regulations.\u201d\n\nThe Jets doubted the severity of the injury and team physicians cleared Osemele, who has not played since Week 3. The team wanted him to play through the injury this season and has fined him since last Saturday for conduct detrimental to the team for each day he missed practice.\n\nOn Friday, Osemele was a no-show at practice following surgery and ESPN\u2019s Rich Cimini reported that he was fined for an \u201cunexcused absence.\u201d The fine for the week of missed practice is reportedly $579,000, one game check for Osemele.\n\nThe NFLPA issued a statement Thursday in support of Osemele ahead of his surgery, despite the team\u2019s contention he didn\u2019t need it right away.\n\n\u201cOur union supports every player\u2019s right to a second medical opinion, workers\u2019 compensation and the best medical care,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cIt is not appropriate or ethical for employers in any line of work to dictate the medical care and treatment of any employee. We are considering all options to protect Kelechi Osemele, as we would for any of our members.\u201d\n\nOsemele has filed a grievance over the fines, according to SNY.tv.\n\nOsemele started the first three games but hasn\u2019t played or practiced since Week 3 against the New England Patriots.\n\nThe Jets acquired Osemele, 30, in March from the Oakland Raiders. He was making $10.2 million this season and was set to earn $11.7 million in 2020 according to Spotrac. He has started 96 NFL games, playing for the Baltimore Ravens (2012-15), Raiders (2016-18) and Jets (2019). He is a two-time Pro Bowl selection.\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "The New York Jets cut veteran guard Kelechi Osemele on Saturday amidst a month-long injury dispute.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191026&t=2&i=1445331177&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9P0P4-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
