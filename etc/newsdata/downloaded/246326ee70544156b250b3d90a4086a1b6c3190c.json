The bodies were found in a shipping container on the back of a semi truck parked on the side of the road where police are now conducting their investigation.\n\nThe police have launched a murder investigation and have arrested the driver of the truck, a 25-year-old resident of Northern Ireland, on suspicion of murder.\n\nPolice and forensic officers investigate a truck in which 39 bodies were discovered in the trailer, as they prepare move the vehicle from the site on October 23, 2019 in Grays, Essex, England.

According to Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borisov, however the vehicle had not been in Bulgaria since 2017. Reuters reported that the truck was registered in Bulgaria to a company owned by an Irish Citizen.\n\nBritish Police later said the truck travelled from Zeebrugge, Belgium into the port at Purfleet near Grays, Essex. The police believe that the trailer, carried by the truck, originated in Ireland.\n\nDeputy Chief Constable Pippa Mills said Wednesday morning that the identification of the victims was the number one priority for the police. She said their nationalities remained unclear.\n\n\"This is a tragic incident where a large number of people have lost their lives,\" Chief Superintendent of Essex Police Andrew Mariner said in the statement.\n\nI\u2019m appalled by this tragic incident in Essex.

Neither the Essex Police nor the National Crime Agency were available to give a comment on any potential connection between the two cases.\n\nIn 2001, a Dutch truck driver was convicted of manslaughter for the deaths of 58 Chinese immigrants who suffocated in the back of his tomato truck that was found in Dover, southern England.", "description": "Police in Essex, just outside London, say the 25-year-old driver has been arrested on suspicion of murder", "authors": ["Caitlin Kelly"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/23/2ef60581-f02a-40f8-8270-a5d7164af1e8/thumbnail/1200x630/9f3040bdb2d2524b1db7354283650ec5/gettyimages-1177742351.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
