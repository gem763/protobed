He was less than thrilled with it, but he could not stop drawing them. With the compulsive fascination of a half-Jewish schoolkid discovering how easily reproduced the world\u2019s most potent symbol of hate is, he\u2019d etch them in his notebook\u2014then quickly scribble in extra lines, disguising them as four-paned windows. He\u2019d then get nervous about all the windows on his pages and draw houses, or sometimes skyscrapers, entire cityscapes full of windows. Hitler\u2019s mustache became another thing he couldn\u2019t get over; it just looked so absurd. It was the first thing about Nazis the future filmmaker learned to laugh at.\n\nWearing Hitler\u2019s mustache himself was less funny. Standing on set three decades later directing his sixth feature in head-to-toe Hitler regalia\u2014occasionally forgetting what he looked like, until the next skeeved-out stare or passing glimpse of himself in a mirror\u2014was actually \u201csuper embarrassing,\u201d as Waititi remembers it. But it would\u2019ve embarrassed Hitler, too; this half-Maori Jew\u2019s impression of him as the dim-witted product of a 10-year-old\u2019s imagination. That\u2019s where the fun of Waititi\u2019s latest, Jojo Rabbit, starts: in stripping the losers who worshipped Hitler of their grandiosity, and reducing them to slapstick.\n\n\u201cYes, they were scary and they were very dangerous people. But also, there\u2019s this layer to them which was just really pathetic and kind of desperate,\u201d Waititi says over a cup of orange juice the morning of Jojo Rabbit\u2019s release. Stretching across a hotel\u2019s patio sofa\u2014feet up, elbow propped in a somewhat familiar pose for him\u2014he takes aim, for a start, at Nazis\u2019 uniforms: \u201cIf you look at all the little details, on their hats, there\u2019s a skull and crossbones. On their belt buckles, there\u2019s lightning bolts. They were all into this iconography and these weird symbols and things that only a 10-year-old would really think was cool.\u201d\n\nA loose adaptation of Christine Leunens\u2019 2004 novel Caging Skies, Jojo Rabbit is a Waititi signature effort: as audacious and imaginative as it is heartbreakingly frank about its heroes\u2019 naiveties and fallibilities. Like Waititi\u2019s breakout feature Boy (2010) and Hunt for the Wilderpeople (2016), Jojo assumes a young outsider\u2019s perspective\u2014in this case, Jojo Betzler (Roman Griffin Davis), a lonely little boy coming of age in Hitler\u2019s Germany. The rise of Nazism hits Jojo with the fervor of Beatlemania. He idolizes Hitler, and earnestly believes in the Third Reich\u2019s mission, at least as he understands it: to rid the world of predatory, shape-shifting, baby-eating, actual fairy-tale monsters called \u201cJews.\u201d\n\nWaititi\u2019s mother, let it be known, is of Russian-Jewish descent. His Maori paternal grandfather, his namesake, fought in North Africa and Italy during World War II, though he downplays the latter. (\u201cEveryone\u2019s grandfather fought in World War II in New Zealand,\u201d he shrugs.) It isn\u2019t that he finds Nazis \u201cnecessarily funny,\u201d he stresses. But there are certain mundane surrealities he can still hardly believe. \u201cThe most ridiculous thing about them, to me, is all the weird little routines they had,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s rules that they made which, if we step back and look at them, just seem ridiculous and like a waste of time.\u201d\n\nThe Nazi salute, for instance, and the fact that officers \u201chad to say it again and again and again whenever they come into a room or meet people.\u201d (In a memorable Jojo Rabbit bit, Gestapo officers chirp \u201cHeil, Hitler\u201d at each other for several long, unbroken minutes as one character after another enters the scene. It\u2019s funny at first, then uncomfortable, then painful, until it loops back around to the point of parody.)\n\nJojo follows its central wannabe Nazi through his time in the Hitler Youth. He\u2019s a misfit among them with an empathy problem; the kid\u2019s too soft to kill even a rabbit, hence his classmates\u2019 taunting nickname and the movie title. With his mother (Scarlett Johansson) often busy (we soon learn she is helping the resistance) and his dad out of the picture, Jojo turns to his imaginary best friend for comfort: Hitler, as played by Waititi.\n\nWaititi caricatures the megalomaniacal leader as a juvenile, id-driven hype man\u2014like Tyler Durden, if Durden were a child in the body of a 44-year-old dressed like Hitler. As Jojo discovers that his mother is hiding a Jewish teenager named Elsa (Leave No Trace\u2019s Thomasin McKenzie) in their attic, a rift opens up between Jojo and Hitler, as the latter begins throwing tantrums over the kids\u2019 blossoming friendship. Still, Jojo is beguiled by Elsa\u2019s dry wit and humor. (When he asks her to draw \u201cwhere Jews live,\u201d she hands him back a picture of his head: \u201cYes,\u201d she tells him. \u201cThat\u2019s where we live.\u201d) Slowly it dawns on him that Jews are not the mind-controlling, fantastical horned villains he believed.\n\nWaititi wrote Jojo Rabbit eight years ago, after his mom passed along Leunen\u2019s novel with effusive praise. But studios were hardly racing to greenlight a heartfelt Nazi satire. Waititi\u2019s script sat untouched until 2017, when Fox Searchlight came to him with a proposal. They would make his movie on one condition: He must play Hitler himself. (His mom, for the record, barely blinked. \u201cShe\u2019s used to me doing all sorts of crazy shit,\u201d Waititi laughs. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to offend her.\u201d)\n\nHe could not have foreseen the resurgence of far-right white nationalism that would make his Nazi comedy resonate differently today than it might have eight years ago. \u201cIt\u2019s ironic and sad,\u201d he says of the film\u2019s accidental relevance. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame that all that stuff is going on. But in a way, I feel like it\u2019s a way better environment for this film to exist in. It probably has more of a chance of doing good or changing people\u2019s opinions, maybe.\u201d Not that he assigns it too much responsibility: \u201cIt\u2019s not a history lesson, let\u2019s put it that way.\u201d\n\n\u201c I\u2019m half-Jewish. I wasn\u2019t, like, gonna fuck up my relationship with my family by doing that. \u201d\n\nJojo\u2019s characters speak anachronistically\u2014\u201cHeil me, man!\u201d\u2014and the script hints at certain Nazis, especially Sam Rockwell\u2019s Hitler Youth camp leader Captain Klezendorf, secretly sympathizing with the enemy. Some detractors argue, for this reason, that the film doesn\u2019t go far enough in acknowledging the horrors of World War II-era Nazism. Waititi, for his part, \u201creally wasn\u2019t concerned that people would think I was sympathizing with Nazis,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m half-Jewish. I wasn\u2019t, like, gonna fuck up my relationship with my family by doing that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know myself and I know my style and the message I\u2019m trying to tell,\u201d he adds. \u201cI wanted to make sure the film felt like it was coming from the right place.\u201d Rockwell\u2019s character, he says, was written to show \u201cthat these people had lives before the war. This gay guy got caught up in this thing and had to hide who he was, and he pays for it.\u201d The movie neither forgives the character nor lets him off the hook for his complicity, he says. As for Jojo, \u201che\u2019s barely a Nazi. At the beginning of the film, he\u2019s a 10-year-old who just wants to go to this cool camp and hang out with all the other kids.\u201d\n\nWaititi watched \u201ca lot\u201d of documentaries about Hitler Youth while writing Jojo Rabbit. \u201cThey were all being indoctrinated,\u201d he says. \u201cThey were told, \u2018Never listen to your family. Rebel against your parents. Listen only to us. And if your parents try and sit you down or criticize the party or us, tell us and then we will deal with your parents.\u2019 So parents weren\u2019t going to sit these kids down and say, \u2018Well, Nazis are bad,\u2019 because they could have been executed. It was a dangerous time to grow up in, and to live in, and to be a parent in.\u201d\n\nJojo ends not unlike most of Waititi\u2019s films: on a note of hopeful optimism and forgiveness. \u201cAt the end of the day, it\u2019s a 10-year-old who\u2019s been brainwashed into this thing,\u201d Waititi says. \u201cI feel that most people can be redeemed. Pretty sure 10-year-olds can be redeemed. The older you get, I\u2019m not sure that really applies.\u201d\n\nThe director, whose Boy and Hunt for the Wilderpeople are still the highest-grossing films in New Zealand, propelled to new fame in 2017 with Thor: Ragnarok, his iconoclastic, Led Zeppelin-heavy take on Marvel\u2019s god of thunder. Ideas about families, outsiders, absent dads, and the naivet\u00e9 of childhood can be traced from Jojo Rabbit back through Waititi\u2019s short films, including the Oscar-nominated Two Cars, One Night. \u201cEven Thor\u2019s about abandonment issues,\u201d he muses. He leans back again, laying his head on one armrest, propping his feet on the other, hands crossed in the middle. \u201cThis is like therapy, I\u2019m in therapy mode,\u201d he grins.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t especially close with his own father when he passed away four years ago, though both his parents\u2014his dad was an artist, and his mom a schoolteacher\u2014encouraged Waititi\u2019s creative pursuits from early on. (The absentee dad Waititi plays in Boy seems to have been modeled in part on his dad, down to the biker gang affiliation.) \u201cI come from two cultures that are very resilient with a keen instinct for survival,\u201d he says. \u201cThere were very, very acute and strong senses of humor. I think that\u2019s where I\u2019ve drawn from both sides.\u201d\n\nStories about family have long fascinated him. \u201cIn the family dynamic, you\u2019ve always got heroes, you\u2019ve got villains, you\u2019ve got clowns,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the chorus in those aunties who all hang out and comment on everything. No matter what family you come from or where the family is, you always have the ability to find really satisfying stories and adventures and tragedies in those dynamics.\u201d Not to mention a breadth of genre: \u201cYou get adventure stories, road trip stories, horror stories, everything.\u201d\n\nTelling stories through the perspective of children, as he has in every film apart from Thor, \u201cwhen done well, can become way more emotional and more engaging for an audience,\u201d he says. A father to two young daughters himself, he\u2019s also intimately familiar with the honesty that entails. \u201cChildren, they don\u2019t fuck around,\u201d he laughs. \u201cThey will straight-up say to you, \u2018You are ugly.\u2019 Or, \u2018You are a bad dad,\u2019 or \u2018you betrayed me.\u2019 Some of it makes no sense, but at least they\u2019re being honest about their feelings. When you see a film through that lens, I think that just feels like a more truthful telling of the events.\u201d\n\nJojo Rabbit\u2019s surprise win of the People\u2019s Choice Award at the Toronto Film Festival, meanwhile, bodes well for its future at the Oscars. (Almost half the winners of that festival prize have gone on to be nominated for Best Picture, including 12 Years a Slave, La La Land, and Green Book.) A then 30-year-old Waititi made a memorable Oscars debut in 2005 by pretending to be asleep when Jeremy Irons listed his name among the best Live Action Short Film nominees. \u201cI was just so exhausted,\u201d he remembers now. \u201cI\u2019d been working on some other shit as well and just felt like I wanted to get through it.\u201d\n\nThe food situation was grim, he recalls. Still, he \u201cloved it as well,\u201d he admits. \u201cI had only really just arrived in Hollywood and to suddenly be thrust into that part of it was quite cool. Seeing Hollywood celebrities and all that sort of shit.\u201d\n\nPotential Oscar glory is one of several bright spots on Waititi\u2019s horizon. A live-action adaptation of the seminal anime Akira is in the works, following another Marvel sequel, Thor: Love and Thunder. The script for the latter is complete, though Waititi can reveal little. He does divulge that the defeated, portlier version of Thor in Avengers: Endgame is his favorite version of the character so far. \u201cI think Thor's at his most interesting when he\u2019s got his own personal issues to deal with, rather than just being on a quest,\u201d Waititi says. \u201cSo whatever it is that we figure out for him to do, I think the more interesting part of that journey will be seeing how he deals with the complication based on his emotional status.\u201d\n\nHe directed the finale of the first live-action Star Wars TV series, The Mandalorian, which will debut Nov. 12. And he\u2019ll adapt Terry Gilliam\u2019s 1981 time-travel fantasy adventure Time Bandits for Apple TV. It\u2019s a lot on the plate of an artist who, in early interviews, often spoke of feeling like his \u201cdays as a filmmaker are numbered.\u201d (\u201cI cannot concentrate on anything for very long,\u201d he said back then. \u201cMy attention drifts and I get interested in something else. I always say I\u2019m going to do something really different, like fashion.\u201d)\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s still true,\u201d Waititi laughs now. \u201cNo, I feel like I\u2019m not bored of it yet. But I can see myself running out of things to say, or maybe starting to feel like I wasn\u2019t surprising myself enough. But so far I\u2019m alright! I feel like I\u2019ve probably got about 10 years at least. But I do feel like, eventually I might just want to try something completely different.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to keep surprising myself,\u201d he smiles.", "description": "The talented New Zealand filmmaker behind \u201cBoy\u201d and \u201cThor: Ragnarok\u201d opens up about playing a wacky Hitler and why \u201cJojo Rabbit\u201d is the furthest thing from sympathetic to Nazis.", "authors": ["Melissa Leon", "Entertainment Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571637305/191020-leon-jojo-tease2_neyovs", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
