To err is human, or so they say, but a misstep in the property game can cost you dearly.\n\nRELATED: The top things to remember when buying your first home\n\nWhere to get Sydney\u2019s best bargains\n\n\u201cFirst-time buyers should be aware of the mistakes easily made that could impact their ability to buy, apply for a loan or cost them more in the long run,\u201d said Canstar group executive for financial services, Steve Mickenbecker.\n\n\u201cThe good news for first-home buyers is the panic and desperation of 2016 and 2017 has eased.\n\nIn 2018, new housing loans and prices were down for the first time in years. First-home buyers are now competing with fewer investors and require lower deposits,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to numbers crunched by the ABS, first-time buyers accounted for 29 per cent of owner-occupier home loans issued in May \u2014 the highest recorded proportion of the new mortgage market since 2012 and that number is tipped to rise.\n\nTaj Singh, co-founder and director of advocacy group, First Home Buyers Australia, said right now is a turning point for those looking to buy for their first time.\n\n\u201cThe relaxation of the lending rules from APRA has meant it\u2019s now a lot easier for first-home buyers to get a loan compared with the last few years,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAnd the NSW and Victorian governments have also introduced stamp duty exemptions, which are helping certain first-home buyers get into the market in those more expensive cities,\u201d he added.\n\nIn addition, the Federal Government is adding to existing State and Territory duty exemptions and grants by offering a helping hand in the shape of the First Home Loan Deposit Scheme (which will assist up to 10,000 Australians get into their first home with as little as 5 per cent deposit) from January 1, 2020.\n\nWith the tables finally turning in the favour of first-home buyers it is only logical the property market is set to be swamped with uninitiated buyers who should be focusing on homework before househunting.\n\nTo better equip first-home buyers, Canstar and First Home Buyers Australia have highlighted some of the biggest rookie real estate mistakes.\n\n\n\n1. Not being budget savvy\n\nTo put it simply, don\u2019t start looking online before you know how much you have to play with.\n\n\u201cFirst-home buyers need to ensure they have a clear idea of their budget before they go house hunting. This will ensure buyers are aware of what they can afford before getting hung up on a dream home beyond their means,\u201d Mr Mickenbecker said.\n\nHow to avoid: Use an online home loan borrowing calculator, or speak with a lender or mortgage broker to understand what the banks will be willing to lend you.\n\n2. Not having that 20 per cent deposit\n\nThere are ways to get into your first home without the standard 20 per cent deposit, but anything less can cost buyers dearly as they will need to take out Lenders Mortgage Insurance (aka LMI).\n\nAn insurance policy protecting the lender (not the buyer) from financial loss in the event you can\u2019t make your home loan repayments, LMI can add up to thousands of dollars that don\u2019t count towards the loan and you\u2019ll never see that cash again.\n\nHow to avoid: For buyers unable to save a 20 per cent deposit, who want to avoid paying for LMI, could tap into the First Home Loan Deposit Scheme if they make the cut.\n\n\u201cAnother option may be having a parent go guarantor for the loan to provide the additional security, however this needs to be carefully weighed up by both the buyer and their parents so all parties understand their responsibilities,\u201d Mr Mickenbecker explained.\n\n3. Not getting the reality of rates\n\nUnderstanding interest rates might not sound exciting, but knowledge is power in the mortgage world. Rates may be at historic lows, but what goes down must go up \u2014 eventually. A first-time buyer purchasing today will likely be in a home loan for up to 30 years so it\u2019s worth pointing out that interest rates were more than double their current status just 10 years ago.\n\nHow to avoid: \u201cProspective buyers should read up on what\u2019s influencing interest rates, so they\u2019re not blindsided when rates increase. Using a site like Canstar to compare home loans is a good way to remain up to speed with lenders interest rate movements and to determine if there are better offers available,\u201d Mr Mickenbecker said.\n\n\n\n4. Not having enough left over\n\nIt\u2019s not just about the purchase price. Beyond buying, Mr Mickenbecker said first-home buyers need to consider the hefty costs of stamp duty, building inspection or strata reports, transfer fees, solicitor fees, moving costs, new furniture or even renovations.\n\nHow to avoid: Research additional costs before buying so you have money left over to cover any unexpected expenses or repairs. Set a buying budget so you can tally up all the possible associated costs.\n\n5. Not getting reports\n\nMr Singh said he has seen too many first-home buyers try to cut corners when it comes to building and pest inspections or strata reports.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen people who decided not to do a building and pest inspection because to save a few hundred dollars, but that\u2019s one of the biggest mistakes first-home buyers make.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re obviously getting in with a skinny deposit and want to save as much as possible, so don\u2019t want to spend money where they think they don\u2019t need to,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBuilding and pest inspections or looking into the strata report of an apartment building are vital steps. If you aren\u2019t aware of a home\u2019s problems you could be out of pocket by tens of thousands of dollars.\u201d\n\nHow to avoid: Get an independent building and pest inspection done on each house you are considering or order a strata report to get insight on the financials of an apartment block you\u2019re looking at.\n\n6. Missing out on grants\n\nMarkets change and so does the assistance offered from Federal, State and Territory governments. The First Home Owners Grant differs in each corner of the country, but in most cases the grant is only for first-timers buying or building a new house or unit. In some places it can be used for established homes. Just how much you can get depends on a number of circumstances.\n\nHow to avoid: To understand which grants they may be entitled, and how much, first-home buyers should visit First Home website.\n\n7. Falling for the frills\n\n\u201cReal estate agents are there to sell the dream but it\u2019s not going to look like that once you move into it. First-home buyers just need to remember not to get too emotionally attached to a property because of the furniture or styling,\u201d Mr Singh said.\n\nHe added that the same idea goes for house and land packages or off-the-plan apartments.\n\n\u201cPeople go to display homes and get wowed by the new designs and inclusions builders are showing.\n\n\u201cBut if you want to get the exact same home, it could cost $100,000 to $200,000 more than the basic advertised price.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s where people go wrong, they think they\u2019re getting the display home but what they get is something pretty standard,\u201d he explained.\n\nHow to avoid: Read the fine print and ask lots of questions of the builder or developer. Get it down in black and white what you\u2019re actually signing up to buy.\n\n8. Not negotiating\n\nNot everyone is a born negotiator, but there\u2019s no time like the present to learn some barter banter.\n\nAfter years of a hot property market with sellers in the driver\u2019s seat across many cities and regions, buyers are now taking back control.\n\nThat power of negotiation also works when haggling for a home loan. Mr Mickenbecker said first-time buyers shouldn\u2019t take the first mortgage on offer.\n\n\u201cYou never know if you don\u2019t ask, so always asking your chosen lender for their best deal may yield savings you thought weren\u2019t possible, or open your eyes to a loan you hadn\u2019t considered previously,\u201d said Mickenbecker.\n\nHow to avoid: \u201cToo often people rely on the home loans presented to them by lenders, though first-time buyers should take a proactive approach and research what is available in the market and be prepared to negotiate on the interest rate to avoid paying too much,\u201d he said.\n\nTo learn more about buying your first home visit: https://www.canstar.com.au/home-loans/first-home-buyers/\n\nSIGN UP FOR THE LATEST REAL ESTATE NEWSLETTER HERE", "description": "It\u2019s going to be the most significant spend of your life that will either have you sitting pretty on the property ladder, or send your finances down the drain.
