New species of bat-winged dinosaur discovered\n\nScientists found melted and broken rocks such as sandstone, limestone and granite \u2013 but no sulfur-bearing minerals, despite the area's high concentration of sulfur-containing rocks. This finding suggests that the impact vaporized these rocks, forming sulfate aerosols in the atmosphere and causing cooling on the global scale.\n\nResearchers estimate the asteroid hit with the equivalent power of 10 billion atomic bombs of the size used in World War II. The blast ignited trees and plants that were thousands of miles away and triggered a massive tsunami that reached as far inland as Illinois.\n\nJay Melosh, a Purdue University professor and expert on impact cratering, who was not involved in the study, said the research helps scientists know that their understanding of the asteroid impact is on the right track.\n\nT. rex's cousin: Meet T. rex's teeny-tiny cousin: 3-foot tall tyrannosaur fossil discovered\n\n\"It was a momentous day in the history of life, and this is a very clear documentation of what happened at ground zero,\" he said.\n\nThe asteroid impact and resulting mass extinction, which scientists call the K-T boundary, marked the end of the Cretaceous Era. The aftereffects of that infamous asteroid collision killed 75% of all species on Earth, including the dinosaurs.\n\nIt's the planet's most recent mass extinction.\n\nMonday's study was published in the peer-reviewed journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Rocks discovered from the day the dinosaurs died 66 million years ago", "description": "Rocks from the most pivotal moment in Earth's history were discovered offshore of the Yucatan Peninsula, a study says.", "authors": ["Doyle Rice", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/os/mit/media/m/social/images/social_default_logo-1481777.png", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
