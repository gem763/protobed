So you turn to the next best thing \u2014 Instagram. These are people whom you follow out of courtesy, but don\u2019t interact with much.\n\nDon\u2019t worry, Instagram is testing a feature that might help you out unfollow some of them. According to app researcher Jane Manchun Wong,the social network is experimenting with a feature to let you group accounts \u2014 and it\u2019ll even corral those courtesy follows for you automatically.\n\nSome automatic groups are \u201cLeast interacted with\u201d and \u201cMost shown in Feed,\u201d calculated over the course of the last 90 days. You can go through accounts you don\u2019t interact with much, and unfollow some to clear out your list.\n\nInstagram is testing to \u201cgroup the accounts you follow to make them easier to manage\u201d, such as: \u201cLeast Interacted With\u201d and \u201cMost Shown in Feed\u201d which are counted in the last 90 days pic.twitter.com/REykEoMqu5 \u2014 Jane Manchun Wong (@wongmjane) October 19, 2019\n\nPlus, this feature will certain help you segregate accounts based on interests such as sports, design, fashion, and memes. This feature is similar to Twitter lists, and which is quite handy for creating alternative feeds.\n\nWe\u2019ve contacted Instagram to learn more about when this feature might roll out, and we\u2019ll update the story if we hear back.", "description": "", "authors": ["Ivan Mehta"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2FInstagram-test.png&signature=52a5e5f9e184cc79cb3160b64dc12de5", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
