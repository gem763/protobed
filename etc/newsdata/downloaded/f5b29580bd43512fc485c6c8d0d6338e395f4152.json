Council into its longest-serving member, Jack Evans (D-Ward 2), is delayed because key witnesses have refused to speak to investigators, Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D) said Monday.\n\nThe council voted in July to hire the law firm O\u2019Melveny & Myers to conduct the investigation, one of several probes into Evans\u2019s actions as a public official and as a private consultant.\n\nBut some of Evans\u2019s clients have refused to talk to the firm and comply with subpoenas issued by it, Mendelson said during a news conference.\n\nInvestigators have spoken to Evans and one other person, the chairman said. Another witness has an interview scheduled later in the month, Mendelson said.\n\nThe D.C. Council is scheduled to vote Tuesday on legislation that would give the city authority to petition the D.C. Superior Court to enforce the subpoenas.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a great deal of public unhappiness with regards to Mr. Evans\u2019s conduct, and the investigation needs to be completed now,\u201d Mendelson said. \u201cThis needs to move more quickly, and the fault here is the interviewees who are not coming in to be interviewed.\u201d\n\n[Rift deepens on D.C. Council amid Jack Evans scandal]\n\nMendelson hoped that investigators would finish most of their work during the council\u2019s summer recess and release their findings soon after. Now Mendelson says the report\u2019s release will be delayed until at least mid-October.\n\nMark Tuohey, a lawyer representing Evans, said his client was cooperating.\n\n\u201cJack has thoroughly cooperated with the Council investigation from the moment it started, including providing any document requested and sitting for multiple interviews,\u201d Tuohey said in a statement. \u201cHe will continue to do so and is confident that a thorough and objective investigation would conclude he tried to conduct his official and business duties properly and according to the rules.\u201d\n\nEvans told council colleagues in July that investigations will show his \u201cactions \u2014 while not becoming \u2014 are far from that which has been reported or suggested.\u201d\n\nThe lawmaker, who formed his NSE consulting firm in 2016, has not been charged with a crime.\n\n[House Republicans want Jack Evans to testify at D.C. statehood hearing]\n\n\u201cWe are going to look at letting this continue to linger and linger and linger into next year,\u201d said D.C. Council member David Grosso (I-At Large), who has urged Evans to resign. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s good for the institution, and I don\u2019t think the people of the District of Columbia deserve this.\u201d\n\nAt least one NSE client, Forge, the parent company of Colonial Parking, confirmed its cooperation with the council investigation.\n\n\u201cForge is fully cooperating with the council\u2019s review of Mr. Evans\u2019s conduct, including providing documents as requested and agreeing to meet with the council\u2019s lawyers to discuss these matters,\u201d said Kevin Byrd, the company\u2019s general counsel.\n\nOther NSE clients did not respond to requests for comment or declined to comment.\n\n[Controversy over Jack Evans evokes D.C.'s long history with ethics scandals]\n\nThey include local development firms WillCo and EastBanc, the regional Eagle Bank and Fischer Holdings, a real estate investment firm. Another client is Digi Outdoor Media, a digital sign company whose founder had offered $50,000 to Evans\u2019s consulting firm, along with 200,000 shares of stock and a paid summer internship for the lawmaker\u2019s son. Evans has said he returned the money and stock and his son declined the internship.\n\nEvans, who was first elected in 1991, is also facing a federal grand jury investigation.\n\nFederal prosecutors subpoenaed records from the D.C. city government involving Evans and his business clients. FBI agents searched Evans\u2019s Georgetown home in June.\n\nEvans used his government email account to send proposals to prospective employers in 2015 and 2018, in which he touted his influence and connections as an elected official and board chairman of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority.\n\nThe District\u2019s Board of Ethics and Government Accountability fined Evans $20,000 over his use of government emails, holding them up as evidence that he used government resources and the prestige of office for personal gain.\n\nThe emails also prompted the transit authority to launch its own investigation into Evans and his tenure there.\n\nA law firm retained by Metro concluded that Evans \u201cknowingly\u201d and repeatedly abused his position at the transit agency to help friends and private clients.\n\n[Read the full report by the firm hired by WMATA to investigate Evans]\n\nThe Metro board\u2019s ethics committee agreed to find one violation: that Evans failed to disclose a conflict of interest with the parking company that was secretly paying him $50,000 a year. Evans and Corbett Price, the District\u2019s other representative on the board, tried to keep this finding from becoming public, and both resigned in the fallout from the ethics probe.\n\nThe results of the Metro probe prompted the D.C. Council to strip Evans of his committee chairmanship and pursue its own investigation.\n\nAn earlier investigation by The Washington Post identified several instances in which Evans used his legislative position in ways that could benefit his clients.\n\nSteve Thompson contributed to this report.\n\nRead more:\n\nEmails contradict Evans\u2019s assertions about relationship with gambling lobbyist\n\nHow D.C. government agencies missed chances to save lives in deadly fire\n\nFirm with most of D.C. sports gambling contract has no employees\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "Council Chairman Phil Mendelson is pushing legislation to enforce subpoenas.", "authors": ["Fenit Nirappil", "Reporter Covering D.C.
