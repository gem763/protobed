(This is always what the wealthy and powerful have done, but this crossed the line from \u201cMy mom donated a building\u201d to \u201cMy dad told me to sit on this rowing machine and lie in my essay about my love of crew so I\u2019d be recruited for a sport I\u2019ve never played.\u201d) Do you also have an unquenchable thirst for movies that are so bad they are good? Well, hoo boy, do I have a gift for you. The trailer dropped Friday for Lifetime\u2019s College Admissions Scandal, a movie with the world\u2019s most literal title based on Operation Varsity Blues. It premieres October 12.\n\nIt stars Penelope Ann Miller and Mia Kirshner \u2014 an actor whose presence in anything prompts me to immediately scream \u201cUGH, JENNY! I THOUGHT YOU WERE DEAD\u201d \u2014 in roles inspired by Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin, two of the highest-profile folks implicated in the scandal. (Huffman pleaded guilty and now faces from four to ten months in prison and a fine of $20,000 plus restitution; Loughlin, and her husband, pleaded not guilty.) \u201cYou\u2019re worth every penny of the half a million dollars we paid you,\u201d Kirshner says in the trailer in a very normal and totally not stilted way, because she absolutely does not know the Feds are listening on the other end of the line and that\u2019s just how normal humans not looking to get charged with fraud talk.
