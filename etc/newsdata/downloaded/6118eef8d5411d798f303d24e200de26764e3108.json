Elizabeth Warren faced attacks over her position on health care.\n\nWarren is a supporter of Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019s Medicare for All plan, which will transition all Americans onto a single-payer health care plan where costs are paid by the government. Over the last few months, moderators and reporters have repeatedly attempted to get Warren to say that taxes on the middle class will go up under the plan. She has consistently declined, focusing on the fact that under the plan, total costs will go down for families because they\u2019ll no longer have to worry about the costs of premiums, copays or deductibles.\n\nAfter Warren again declined to state that taxes would go up, South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg went on an attack he has been telegraphing.\n\n\u201cWe heard it tonight: a yes-or-no question that didn\u2019t get a yes-or-no answer,\u201d said Buttigieg. \u201cLook, this is why people here in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington in general and Capitol Hill in particular. Your signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything except this.\u201d\n\nButtigieg has been promoting a public option plan that would retain private insurance, although his plan wouldn\u2019t guarantee universal coverage to all Americans.\n\n\u201cMy view on this and what I have committed to is costs will go down for hard-working middle-class families,\u201d said Warren. \u201cI will not embrace a plan like \u2018Medicare for All Who Can Afford It\u2019 which will leave behind millions of people who cannot, and I will not embrace a plan that says people have great insurance right up until they get the diagnosis and the insurance company says, \u2018Sorry, we\u2019re not covering your expensive cancer treatments.\u2019\u201d\n\nWarren was also pushed by Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who has attempted to stake out a centrist lane in the primary but has failed to gain traction.\n\nSen.

She added that a public option would be easier to pass than Sanders\u2019s Medicare for All plan, but the insurance industry is united in its opposition to both types of legislation.\n\nSanders came to Warren\u2019s defense, closing out the discussion by stating that he gets \u201ca little bit tired of people defending a system which is dysfunctional, which is cruel.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe issue is whether the Democratic Party has the guts to stand up to the health care industry which made $100 billion in profit,\u201d said Sanders. \u201cWhether we have the guts to stand up to the corrupt price-fixing pharmaceutical industry which is charging us the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs and if we don\u2019t have the guts to do that, if all we can do is take their money we should be ashamed of ourselves.\u201d\n\nThe American health care system is among the most expensive in the world and also has some of the highest prescription drug costs. At the same time, 28 million people are without health coverage and 79 million have medical debt, and crowdfunding sites to help cover medical expenses are proliferating.\n\n\n\n\n\n_____\n\nDownload the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:", "description": "In her first debate as a front runner, Sen.
