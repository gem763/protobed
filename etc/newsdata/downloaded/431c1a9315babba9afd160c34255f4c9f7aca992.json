Dell will sell it to you with Ubuntu pre-installed.\n\nWhile Dell is known for offering Linux pre-installed, we found a number of higher-end Dell machines previously listed as supporting Linux that no longer are available with Linux. So shop carefully. Even so, the XPS 13 is sweet, even if you're limited to onboard Intel UHD graphics.\n\nDisclosure: ZDNet earns commissions from some of the products featured in this gallery.", "description": "If you're a Windows user, there's tremendous choice when it comes to laptops.
