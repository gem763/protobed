But the U.S. television star said she \u201cnaively\u201d dismissed the warnings, because as an American she didn\u2019t understand how the British press worked.\n\n\u201cI never thought this would be easy but I thought it would be fair. And that is the part that is hard to reconcile,\u201d she said. \u201cBut (I) just take each day as it comes.\u201d\n\nThe royal couple revealed their struggles with the media during the ITV documentary \u201cHarry & Meghan: An African Journey,\u201d which followed them on a recent tour of Southern Africa. Both said they had struggled with the spotlight, particularly because they say much of what is printed is untrue.\n\nThe pressure was aggravated by the fact that the duchess was a newlywed, then pregnant and then a new mother.\n\n\u201cAny woman, especially when they\u2019re pregnant, you\u2019re really vulnerable. And so that was made really challenging, and then when you have a newborn, you know?\u201d she said, adding that it was a struggle.\n\nLater she added: \u201cI would say thank you for asking, because not many people have asked if I\u2019m OK, but it\u2019s a very real thing to be going through behind the scenes.\u201d\n\nThe 35-year-old Harry did acknowledge there have been some differences between him and his older brother, 37-year-old Prince William, although he said most of what has been printed about a rift between the two has been \u201ccreated out of nothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cPart of this role and part of this job and this family being under the pressure that it\u2019s under, inevitably stuff happens,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, look, we\u2019re brothers. We\u2019ll always be brothers. We\u2019re certainly on different paths at the moment, but I will always be there for him, as I know he\u2019ll always be there for me.\u201d\n\nHarry has lashed out at the British media in the past for its treatment of Meghan, accusing the media of hounding her the way it did his mother, Princess Diana, who died in a 1997 car crash while trying to elude paparazzi. Harry insisted he didn\u2019t want such history repeated.\n\nDuring the trip to Africa, Harry walked through the same minefield in Angola that his mother visited just before her death as she publicized efforts to clear thousands of mines left behind by the country\u2019s 27-year civil war.\n\nHe told ITV that one of the most difficult parts of being constantly in the public eye is that every click of a shutter and flash from a camera is \u201cthe worst reminder\u201d that his mother\u2019s life ended so young, at only 36.\n\nBut he added, \u201cI will not be bullied into playing a game that killed my mum.\u201d\n\nAt the close of their African tour, Harry and Meghan each brought separate legal actions against the media.\n\nThe duchess earlier this month sued the Mail on Sunday tabloid, claiming it illegally published a letter she wrote to her father. Harry sued over the alleged illegal interception of voicemail messages by journalists from the Sun, the News of the World and the Daily Mirror newspapers.\n\nHarry, who has joined his brother in promoting a more open discussion of mental health issues throughout society, described his own mental health struggles as being a matter of \u201cconstant management.\u201d\n\n\u201cPart of this job, and part of any job, like everybody, is putting on a brave face and turning a cheek to a lot of the stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cBut again, for me and again for my wife, of course, there is a lot of stuff that hurts, especially when the majority of it is untrue.\u201d", "description": "LONDON (AP) \u2014 The Duchess of Sussex says her first year of marriage to Britain's Prince Harry has been difficult because of the pressure from Britain's", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/21/c557e9_britain-royal-10304-duke-duchess-sussex-attend-annual-wellchild-awards-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
