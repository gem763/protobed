Sign up here.\n\nIndian External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar on Monday criticized China for what he described as one-sided trade policies, casting doubt over the progress of negotiations for a pan-Asian free trade agreement.\n\nSpeaking during a panel discussion in Singapore, the minister said India remained skeptical over \u201cunfair\u201d market access and \u201cChinese protectionist policies\u201d that have created a significant trade deficit between the two nations. India\u2019s trade deficit with China was $53.6 billion in the fiscal year ended March 2019.\n\n\u201cThe big concerns of India are of course, one, its relationship with China because we have an enormous trade deficit with China,\u201d Jaishankar said in response to a question regarding the ongoing negotiations for Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, or RCEP.\n\nNegotiators have expressed hope that RCEP -- which includes all 10 of Southeast Asia\u2019s Asean countries, as well as Japan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand, India and China -- would be delivered by the end of the year. While ministers from the 16 participating countries reaffirmed their commitment to reaching a deal this year following negotiations in Bangkok over the weekend, it is unclear whether such a goal will be met.\n\nJaishankar said he was unsure what was discussed in the latest round of negotiations, but noted that India\u2019s involvement would hinge on a mutually equitable, depoliticized arrangement.\n\n\u201cRCEP at the end of the day is an economic negotiation. It has a strategic implication, but the merits of the RCEP outcome have to be economic,\u201d said Jaishankar. \u201cIt has to be sold for its strength and I think if that was more self-evident to Indians I think you would get clearly a much stronger resonance.\u201d\n\nSingaporean Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan, who was also on the panel, urged India to reconsider its position on RCEP, saying that Beijing and New Delhi would have to come to terms on trade eventually.\n\n\u201cI am making the argument that it is worth making the effort, because this would be a game changer,\u201d Balakrishnan said.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Philip J.
