The vehicle looked to be transporting children's juice cartons\n\nAlmost 50 tons of heroin was found inside the lorries. The people involved are thought to have been part of an organised crime group\n\nIt is thought they are part of a well-established crime group that used Dutch and British front companies to import the drugs.\n\nThey managed to get the heroin, cocaine and cannabis through UK ports over an 18-month period.\n\nIn April this year four men and two women were also arrested by the Dutch National Police on European Arrest Warrants - they are all awaiting extradition to the UK.\n\nThe dealing of the groups was revealed following three consignments by the NCA in September this year.\n\nVegetables pictures above can be seen on the floor as investigations are carried out on the lorries\n\nThe drugs that were found were thought to have had a street value of more than \u00a338 million\n\nThe NCA said that they contained 351 kilos of cocaine, 92 kilos of heroin, 250 kilos of cannabis and 1,850 kilos of hemp/hashish.\n\nIn total, this amounted to a street value of more than \u00a338 million.\n\nIt was then discovered that they had imported drugs on numerous occasions between February 2017 and October 2018.\n\nThe investigation was then linked to a previous NCA investigation in which 13 individuals were jailed for 176 years after 100kg was seized in 2015.\n\nJayne Lloyd, NCA Regional Head of Investigations, said: \u201cThe NCA targets organised crime groups causing the greatest harm to the UK.\n\n\u201cStopping criminals who don\u2019t care about the damage they are causing in communities, and the children being exploited by County Lines drug dealing, is an absolute priority.\n\n\u201cWe suspect these men were involved in an industrial-scale operation \u2013 the biggest ever uncovered in the UK \u2013 bringing in tonnes of deadly drugs that were distributed to crime groups throughout the country.\n\n\u201cBy working closely with partners here and overseas, in particular the Dutch National Police, we believe we have dismantled a well-established drug supply route.\u201d\n\nOther international teams have helped support the NCA with the investigation including Europol, Eurojust, Police of Finland National Bureau of Investigation, Border Force, HMRC and numerous police forces.", "description": "The drugs were hidden in lorries bringing vegetables and juice over from Holland and those responsible have now been arrested as part of a National Crime Agency (NCA) investigation.", "authors": ["Terri-Ann Williams For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/12/19441040-0-image-a-13_1570535957103.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
