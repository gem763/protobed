The lazy \u2014 and the wise \u2014 man\u2019s onion, spring onions are versatile, dirt cheap and easy to deal with, and they should be a staple in everyone\u2019s kitchen, beyond their typical use a garnish.\n\nFor those who aren\u2019t familiar, spring onions are young onions, harvested before the bulb has formed. In appearance, they resemble a midpoint between chives and leeks: Wispy, hollow stalks; thin and green at the tips; and progressively heartier and whiter in colour as you get down to the stem.\n\nThe green part is herbal and grassy with a hint of sweetness, with a nice crisp snap, while the white part is closer to a traditional onion, only softer and milder, with less bite.\n\nHere\u2019s why you should make spring onions an every day ingredient in your kitchen if they aren\u2019t already.\n\nThey\u2019re easy to work with and won\u2019t make you cry\n\nIf you\u2019re a lazy, moody home cook like me, any slightly laborious task, such as dicing an onion, can be enough to dissuade you from making a meal, opting instead for junk food from the deli, or overpriced delivery. But with green onions, you reap the same benefits as regular bulb onions\u2014and then some \u2014 with much less hassle and absolutely no tears!\n\nIf I\u2019m using the spring onions as a garnish, all I have to do is snip the green tips with a pair of scissors. If I want to use the more savoury, whiter part of the onion near the roots for a sauce or stew, I can use a paring knife to make quick and clean slices.\n\nThey\u2019re versatile as hell\n\nTheir most popular use is as a garnish; you can sprinkle the thin green tips on top of almost any savoury food to excellent effect. As a general rule, they\u2019re not going to do any harm, and they will add a little something in both taste and texture, meaning you don\u2019t need to worry about overdoing it. But more than just an afterthought of a topping, spring onions can do the heavy lifting, serving as a key ingredient in the base for saut\u00e9s, sauces and stews.\n\nThey can also hold their own as a vegetable side when roasted or grilled whole. Plus, they\u2019re super cheap! A bundle of spring onions \u2014 roughly five to seven stalks bunched together \u2014 runs me $1 at my neighbourhood grocery store and can be used in so many different meals \u2014 more on that below.\n\nSome ways to get started\n\nPunch up a salad\n\nSpring onions freshen up the flavour and add a little snap to any salad when you\u2019re low on toppings. Starting with whatever lettuce looks freshest/won\u2019t kill you, my friend Maddie makes a lovely all-green salad, adding roughly chopped pistachios and green onions, and tossing it with a variation on Goddess dressing that combines, lime, honey, olive oil and salt and pepper, resulting in the perfect combo of herbal, crunchy and tangy.\n\nSprinkle them on top of literally anything\n\nAdd them to baked potatoes, use them in sandwiches (they go well mixed into tuna or chicken salad), or toss them on some eggs, avocado toast, rice bowl or any Asian-inspired noodle dish, like these cold, spicy peanut noodles, or even your sad microwave ramen.\n\nThey enhance any dip or spread; there\u2019s a reason spring onion cream cheese is the best kind of cream cheese. You can even use the roots in this manner \u2014 when well-washed and saut\u00e9ed until crispy \u2014 to add an oomph to a homemade onion dip.\n\nSaut\u00e9 them instead of onions\n\nThe heartier, white part at the stem of the spring onion is best diced and saut\u00e9ed as you would a traditional onion, and will work in its place if you don\u2019t have one on hand. Add to the pan when you\u2019re cooking up fried rice or a stir-fry, use as a savoury base before you braise meat or veggies, or add to ratchet up the flavour of homemade vegetable soup stock.\n\nCombine the green and the white\n\nOften, recipes call for both the green and white parts of the onion\u2014take ginger-spring onion sauce, a magic mixture for dumplings, noodles, pretty much anything you fancy which combines saut\u00e9ed minced ginger, vegetable oil, and a whole chopped spring onion.\n\nA charred spring onion butter, made by mixing saut\u00e9ed diced spring onion with lime zest, lime juice and butter, makes a creamy and tangy topping for fish or steak, and I\u2019d argue green onions would do just fine as a substitute for shallots in a classic white wine lemon seafood sauce.\n\nYou can also cook the combination into the dough for spring onion pancakes; using it in leftover veggie pancakes that salvage any produce you have floating around your fridge; or baking them into cheddar and spring onion biscuits for an extra kick.\n\nRoast or grill them whole\n\nSpring onions can hold their own as a vegetable side dish when roasted or grilled whole. Treat them as you would asparagus, tossing with plenty of olive oil, salt and pepper, and lemon if you like. If you\u2019re oven-roasting, opt for high heat, at least 200 - 230 degrees, cooked for about 20 minutes or until nicely wilted and browned.\n\nIf you\u2019re grilling, Alex Delaney at Bon Appetit recommends first slicing your spring onions in half lengthwise, to ensure that maximum surface area comes in contact with the grill, which should be at high heat. From there, lay them right on the grates or place them in a basket (or in foil) and cook for five minutes, until blistered.", "description": "I\u2019m keen on green onions.
