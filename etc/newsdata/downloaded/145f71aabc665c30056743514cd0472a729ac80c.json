Because, for an organisation that is meant to represent and guide the sport on the international level, there\u2019s something discerningly rudimentary about World Rugby\u2019s approach to the oncoming storm.\n\nIn its defence, the governing body has seemingly sought to justify its decision-making on the matter of \u2018consistency\u2019. Back to Gilpin we go. \u201cWith so many teams to move around, and to be able to deliver safely the exit of 12 teams after the pool stage, we couldn\u2019t guarantee contingency plans consistently,\u201d he added on Thursday. \u201cIf we can\u2019t do it for all, we can\u2019t do it for any.\u201d As crisis bluster goes, the egalitarian approach ranks highly. But it still does little to conceal World Rugby\u2019s mishandling of this situation.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nIn Typhoon Hagibis, the strongest storm of the year to date \u2013 maybe Gilpin should have offered this as an excuse \u2013 the organisation has been forced into drastic measures. The level of disruption is unprecedented in the history of the Rugby World Cup. England\u2019s meeting with France and New Zealand\u2019s clash against Italy have been cancelled. The Pool A finale between Japan and Scotland, which will decide the outcome of the group, remains on red alert. Most worryingly, if poor weather conditions persist, the game will be scrapped. Not postponed. Remember: consistency is key here.\n\nSo what are we now faced with? In the case of the two matches that have been called off, there was next to nothing riding on both. The Anglo-French encounter was a dead rubber, with both sides already through to the quarter-finals. As for Italy vs New Zealand, the Azzurri would have needed to inflict a humiliating, devastating defeat on their opponents to deny them a spot in the last eight. An improbable outcome, by no stretch of the imagination. But more on this later.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Rugby World Cup team of round three 1/16 Team of round three From Scotland's demolition of Samoa to France's narrow escape against Tonga, who makes the team of round three? AFP via Getty Images 2/16 1. James Slipper (Australia) Ninety-three Tests had come and gone for the Wallabies loosehead, but it was 94th-time lucky for the Queensland-born prop as he finally scored his first international try in Australia\u2019s 45-10 victory over Uruguay. Getty Images 3/16 2. Mbongeni Mbonambi (South Africa) Mbonambi was excellent at the lineout, finding his jumper on every occasion, but it was his work around the pitch that really stood out in the win over Italy as he bagged himself a try in the process. PA 4/16 3. Angus Ta\u2019avao (New Zealand) The rookie All Blacks prop was thrust into the contest against Namibia early when his team were struggling to break down the African side following Nepo Laulala\u2019s yellow card, but not only did he settle straight into the match, he immediately bagged himself a try that convinced Steve Hansen to leave him on for the rest of the match. Getty Images 5/16 4. Wimpie van der Walt (Japan) The uniquely-named lock led Japan\u2019s defensive charge against Samoa and was dominant in the aerial battle with a 100 per cent lineout effort alongside James Moore, which was made all the more impressive as he didn\u2019t start either of their opening matches. AFP via Getty Images 6/16 5. Sam Whitelock (New Zealand) Captained New Zealand in the absence of Kieran Read and led by example. Whitelock bagged a try himself, didn\u2019t panic when New Zealand were clawed back in the first half and contributed well with the ball in hand. His aggression in kicking for the corner early on paid off with a 71-point return. EPA 7/16 6. Rhys Ruddock (Ireland) Ireland may have been criticised for a drab performance in their victory over Russia, but Ruddock proved the silver lining with a man-of-the-match display that could thrust him into the side for the big contests. AFP via Getty Images 8/16 7. Sam Underhill (England) Another flanker named man of the match, Underhill was England\u2019s defensive heartbeat against Argentina, but also an emphatic carrier who helped set up George Ford\u2019s bonus point-clinching try. PA 9/16 8. Kazuki Himeno (Japan) The Japanese No 8 was one of their top performers against Samoa, carrying well and showing a deft touch with his ability to offload from the tackle. Earmarked as a real star of Japanese rugby, he looks to have real captaincy potential. AFP via Getty Images 10/16 9. Frank Lomani (Fiji) A livewire showing as the beating heart of a Flying Fijian side back at full strength and firing on all cylinders. Scored a try himself and delivered the quick ball that the Pacific Islanders crave to play their unique brand of rugby. AP 11/16 10. Jordie Barrett (New Zealand) Stepped out of the shadow of older brother Beauden to play a starring role in the demolition of Namibia. Scored a try himself but it was the in which he created Anton Lienert-Brown\u2019s score that really stood out, combining power, vision, passing ability and athletic determination to send the centre over. Getty Images 12/16 11. Semi Radradra (Fiji) The star of the side this week. When Radradra is playing his best rugby he is simply unstoppable, and so he proved last week. The Bordeaux back scored twice against Georgia and led pretty much every attacking stats list as the European side failed to shackle is delightful talent. AP 13/16 12. Anton Lienert-Brown (New Zealand) His form is keeping Sonny Bill Williams out of the Test side when New Zealand play their crunch fixtures, but on the weekend\u2019s evidence it was easy to see why. Two tries, the first an eye-catching mazy run from halfway, secures him the No 12 shirt this week, and probably for the All Blacks in the quarter-finals. Getty Images 14/16 13. Timothy Lafaele (Japan) Kicked off the performance against Samoa with their first try, starring with teammate Kotaro Matsushima to tear the Pacific Islanders apart early on and pave the way to their bonus-point victory. AFP via Getty Images 15/16 14. Cheslin Kolbe (South Africa) How do you stop him? The answer is yet to be found, with Kolbe\u2019s low centre of gravity, stunning footwork and Habana-like pace leaving team after team in knots \u2013 this time Italy \u2013 with two tries to kick-start his tally at this World Cup. AFP via Getty Images 16/16 15. Elliot Daly (England) Possibly his best performance for England in the No 15 shirt to date, Daly linked up superbly with Jonny May \u2013 who is hard done by not to make the side this week \u2013 and Anthony Watson in what was a scintillating first half for the English back three.

Getty Images\n\nAlthough Eddie Jones suggested the \u201ctyphoon gods\u201d were \u201csmiling\u201d down on his team, we can assume those travelling fans who had paid thousands to watch the game might not adopt such a blas\u00e9 attitude. Similarly, for the Italians, French and New Zealanders who had turned out to follow their respective sides, World Rugby\u2019s decision will have been met with disappointment.\n\nThere is, of course, a bigger picture here though. With 150mph winds expected to batter the country when Hagibis hits \u2013 and following Typhoon Faxai which last month killed three people \u2013 the governing body is justified in arguing that \u201cthe best interest of team, public, and tournament volunteer safety\u201d has been made a \u201cpriority\u201d. There are no queries on this front.\n\nBut could the games perhaps have been rescheduled? This is where organisers will point to the handbook. Before the tournament, it was made clear that a match which \u201ccannot be commenced on the day in which it is scheduled... shall not be postponed to the following day, and shall be considered as cancelled.\u201d\n\nBut in abiding by the letter of the law, World Rugby is demonstrating its lack of joined-up thinking. It\u2019s in times like this where common sense should be allowed to prevail. Because with so much riding on Japan and Scotland\u2019s showdown in Yokohama \u2013 a possible first quarter-final berth for the hosts vs what would be a heroic Scottish turnaround \u2013 it begs the question: why aren\u2019t organisers willing to push this match back?\n\nAssuming Hagibis has left the region\u2019s infrastructure decimated come Sunday morning, the fixture will be abandoned. Both teams will be awarded two points. Japan will go through. The Scots have rightly expressed their outrage while head coach Gregor Townsend has made clear his willingness to play out proceedings in an empty stadium, should that be the last option.\n\nItaly, too, deserve their opportunity to face the All Blacks, regardless if that\u2019s at a later date. You feel Sergio Parisse may have been on to something when he said: \u201dIf New Zealand needed four or five points against us it would not have been cancelled. It is ridiculous that there was no Plan B, because it isn\u2019t news that typhoons hit Japan.\u201d It\u2019s perhaps only England and France who will shrug their shoulders.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just the Japan-Scotland sub-plot which stands to be ruined. World Rugby\u2019s reputation is on the line. For three weeks, the tournament has been building confidently. Yes, there has been controversy: the red cards, the high tackles, the continuing question of inequality in the game. In reality, though, many will be relieved to see such conversations on the agenda. Japan 2019 still has the potential to emerge as a tournament in which rugby, under the glare of the global spotlight, takes another step forward in addressing those issues which for too long have persisted.\n\nBut all that is threatened to be undone on account of the organisers\u2019 failure to prepare for this eventuality and, more frustratingly, the stubborn refusal to reschedule on account of being \u201cconsistent\u201d. It\u2019s a hollow defence that doesn\u2019t stand up. It doesn\u2019t matter that World Rugby is doing what it \u201csaid we would do before the tournament\u201d \u2013 that just means the plans in place have been inadequate and inflexible from the very beginning.\n\nIn bringing the World Cup to Japan \u2013 which is no Doha when it comes to \u2018adverse weather\u2019, before anyone else questions the decision to stage the competition here \u2013 the organisation should have known that this was a possibility. The right contingency plans should have been in place. At best, that means moving the game to an indoor venue for the same day, playing it behind closed doors and mobilising the work force to make it happen \u2013 irrespective of what that means for broadcasters and the like. At worst, it means postponing fixtures. Given the amount of slack built into the tournament\u2019s schedule for the knockout stages, would it really be such an issue? The turnaround will be tough, but nothing the players are not accustomed to.\n\nAnd if, on both accounts, the fans are unable to attend, then so be it \u2013 they will understand we\u2019re dealing with the laws of nature. It goes without saying that, in Scotland\u2019s case, the supporters would rather their team handed the chance to progress than the current proposal. There\u2019s simply too much at stake here to be asked to sit back and accept their fate.\n\nWorld Rugby will be watching and waiting nervously as Typhoon Hagibis makes landfall. But it didn\u2019t have to be this way. If the governing body wants to be taken seriously, it needs to be seen taking proper and effective action in times of crisis, and applying a dose of common sense too.
