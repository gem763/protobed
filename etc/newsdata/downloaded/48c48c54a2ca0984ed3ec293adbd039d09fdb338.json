But to Chu, they\u2019re not as different as they may seem. \"I feel that UI art is the simpler form of graphic design, and then concept art can still be graphic but on a larger scale like an environment,\" she says. \"If you strip it down to its bare bones, they are made up of graphic shapes composed around a subject matter.\"\n\nIn her current role, she\u2019s able to work on a variety of projects, including blockbuster movies like the upcoming sequel to The Lego Movie. \"It's a fun challenge thinking with constrained rules,\" she says of that project, \"it's definitely a different way of thinking which is awesome.\"\n\nIn the future though, she\u2019d like to not only work on a game, but help create her own. It\u2019s the process of building new worlds that excites, and games afford ample opportunity to create a myriad of new things, from weapons to locations to in-game icons. (In her spare time she's been crafting an intriguing fantasy world called \"Knight Hood.\") And though she\u2019d prefer to create her dream game with a small team, that isn\u2019t stopping her from thinking big.\n\n\"My dream project is probably to make my own game one day that a lot of people can enjoy,\" says Chu. \"Something as memorable as Zelda.\"\n\nYou can find more of her work on her site.", "description": "Unlike a lot of artists, Janice Chu didn\u2019t necessarily grow up knowing she wanted to draw things for a living.
