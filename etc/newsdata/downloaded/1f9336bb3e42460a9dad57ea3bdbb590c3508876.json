(Jennifer Clasen)\n\nTV critic\n\nThose of us who love Amazon Prime\u2019s dramedy \u201cTransparent,\u201d as both a transgender story and a master class on modern Judaism, ran out of breath praising it. And then we were dealt a sudden and difficult blow when its star, Jeffrey Tambor, left the show in 2017 (and was later formally fired) after sexual harassment allegations.\n\nFollowing a suitable shiva period, creator Jill Soloway came up with a risky but enticing idea for a proper way to end the story with and without Maura Pfefferman, the late-blooming woman played by Tambor. Why not transform \u201cTransparent\u201d into a musical?\n\nThe result, a 100-minute send-off titled \u201cTransparent Musicale Finale\u201d (now streaming), features a lot of song and dance, some of which is drenched in self-absorbed sap and some of which is wildly and satisfyingly jubilant, with thoughtful and often clever music written by Soloway\u2019s composer sister, Faith Soloway.\n\nUpon finding out that Maura has passed away in her sleep (aortic aneurysm), Maura\u2019s family, friends and ex-wife Shelly (Judith Light) burst unnaturally into song \u2014 songs about L.A. traffic, songs about shocking grief, songs about long-bottled resentments. And, as Maura\u2019s body is prepped for cremation at a nearby funeral home, songs about letting go.\n\nThe stage is second nature to Light, who lends \u201cTransparent Musicale Finale\u201d all the performance panache it needs, as Shelly channels her grief into a loony autobiographical musical at her nearby community center, replete with amateur actors cast as her troublesomely neurotic adult children. To round out her story, Shelly needs a new Maura, and fate provides her one. (I won\u2019t spoil the details of it.)\n\n\n\nAmy Landecker, left, and Gaby Hoffmann revive their roles as Sarah and Ali in \u201cTransparent.\u201d (Erin Simkin)\n\nLivid at their mother\u2019s stab at catharsis, the Pfefferman children (Amy Landecker as Sarah; Jay Duplass as Josh; and Gaby Hoffmann as Ali, who has come out as non-binary and now goes by Ari) revert to some of the original unlikable petulance they showed in Season 1. The show struggles to find a way to meaningfully wrap up the Pfefferman siblings\u2019 stories, whether sung or spoken, but the actors put considerable effort into bringing \u201cMusicale Finale\u201d to its fullest vision.\n\n\u201cTransparent\u2019s\u201d extended cast also delivers, including Alexandra Billings as Maura\u2019s best friend, Davina, and Kathryn Hahn as Josh\u2019s ex, Raquel the Rabbi. Hahn is great in a sultry number that breaks down the Jewish grief ritual: \u201cYou can\u2019t run away from your sadness, it\u2019ll always find you,\u201d she sings. \u201cYou can\u2019t get through this s--- unless you sit in it.\u201d\n\nSitting shiva for Maura turns out to be the wrong prescription, however, leading \u201cTransparent\u201d to end on a giddy, extravagant note of celebration. \u201cWe Jews have a painful history, that we choose to convey in minor keys,\u201d Shelly sings, disrupting the polite reverence. \u201cNever to forget the shame, so our songs all sound the sa-ay-ay-ame.\u201d\n\n\u201cTransparent\u2019s\u201d send-off is an alternate message of unrestrained happiness \u2014 the only antidote, Shelly proclaims, to the burden of the Holocaust (one of the show\u2019s long-running preoccupations). Everyone joins Shelly in the refrain: \u201cJoy-a-caust, joy-a-caust! Hell, yes, we\u2019ve crossed the line. That\u2019s why we\u2019re feeling fine.\u201d\n\nLoyal viewers may find themselves wishing for a less silly way out. But that\u2019s not what\u2019s on offer. \u201cTransparent\u201d is urging its viewers to spread their wings and try some happiness for a change. After they shared so much gloom and depression, it seems rude to deprive the Pfeffermans of their moment in the sun.\n\nTransparent Musicale Finale (100 minutes) is available for streaming on Amazon Prime.
