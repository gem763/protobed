Sadly.\n\nLuckily, Morrisons have created a fun new twist on the trick or treat concept for grown ups to enjoy \u2013 in the form of pizza.\n\nThe pizza also features scotch bonnets and jalape\u00f1o pepperoni (Picture: Morrisons)\n\nThe new 10\u201d Trick or Treat pizza serves up a slice of heavenly delight, or a slice of devilish fire \u2013 and you have to be brave to take the risk.\n\nEach pizza is dotted with infamous ghost chillis hidden in random slices. And these chillies are no joke. They measure over one million units on the Scoville heat scale, 200 times spicier than Tabasco sauce.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you fall victim to a surprise devil\u2019s slice, you will also be hit by hidden Scotch Bonnet chillies, which measure between 100,000 to 350,000 on the scale. So\n\nThe heavenly slices feature slightly cooler, tangy ingredients, including jalape\u00f1o pepperoni, spicy chicken and cheese. So every bite becomes a dangerous game of roulette with your taste buds.\n\nThe chilli heat is so intense that the pizza actually comes with a warning label. So even if you end up crying and desperately pouring milk all over your face \u2013 you can\u2019t say that you didn\u2019t know the risks.\n\n\u2018The aim is to give customers the ultimate trick or treat,\u2019 says Shezad Mahmood, Pizza Buyer at Morrisons. \u2018The question is will our customers be prepared to roll the dice and face heaven or hell in a slice?\u2019\n\nAre you brave enough to give it a try? Stock up for your Halloween party; each pizza is \u00a33 or you can buy two for \u00a35.\n\nMORE: You can now get a \u2018sexy\u2019 vegan Beyond Burger costume for Halloween\n\nMORE: Dream job alert: earn \u00a32k a week staying in luxury homes\n\nMORE: Headteacher writes letter to tooth fairy to vouch for student\u2019s lost tooth\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Morrisons special Halloween pizza contains hidden chillies that are 200 times hotter than Tabasco sauce - so every bite is a a risk.", "authors": ["Natalie Morris"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_90983478_1571648404.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
