We\u2019re here to find the truth [and] to uphold the Constitution of the United States. This is not a game for us,\u201d said Mrs. Pelosi, California Democrat.\n\nMrs. Pelosi has long been a holdout on holding a vote, which some see as potentially endangering Democrats in swing states and districts by putting them on the record for impeachment, though all but a handful of Democrats are in favor of the inquiry.\n\nThe announcement came after Republicans spent the two-week recess hammering Democrats on the fact that their process deviated from past impeachments efforts, which all kicked off after a full House vote.\n\nRepublicans have also slammed the investigation as unbalanced, demanding that they be given equal subpoena power to call their own witnesses.\n\nThe White House sent a letter to Mrs. Pelosi last week refusing to cooperate with the investigation until she held a vote on the matter.\n\nDemocrats brushed those complaints off.\n\n\u201cThey can\u2019t defend the president, so they\u2019re going to process,\u201d Mrs. Pelosi said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going there.\u201d\n\nHouse Democrats had been testing the waters on a vote and reaching out to members in swing states to gauge their support on Tuesday, according to a report from Politico.\n\nWhile many members of the House Democratic caucus argued that the Constitution doesn\u2019t require the House to start an impeachment inquiry with a vote, others thought it could bolster their case.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s time for us to put a vote on the floor, a resolution for the inquiry structured in such a way that it can move forward with full power of the Congress behind it,\u201d Rep. John Garamendi, California Democrat, said on CNN last week.\n\nHowever, as Democrats went into their weekly meeting, several were ambivalent towards a vote.\n\n\u201cI think the way people view it and view this presidency, i think is fairly much baked in the cake. If we vote on it \u2014 fine. If we don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t think it hurts us,\u201d Rep. Dan Kildee, Michigan Democrat, told reporters.\n\nThe chatter over an impeachment inquiry vote is peaking on Capitol Hill just as 2020 Democratic candidates are set to take the stage in Ohio, with most of them having said Mr. Trump should be impeached.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
