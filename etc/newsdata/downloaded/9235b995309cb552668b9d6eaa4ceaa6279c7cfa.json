Trump said Baghdadi was under surveillance for a couple of weeks but that an earlier operation had been canceled due to Baghdadi\u2019s movements.\n\nThe president said U.S. troops cornered Baghdadi, who retreated into a tunnel with three children.\n\n\u201cHe died after running into a dead-end tunnel, whimpering and crying and screaming all the way,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe reached the end of the tunnel as our dogs chased him down.\u201d\n\nBaghdadi blew himself up with a suicide vest, killing himself and three children he'd brought with him, Trump said, adding that the tunnel collapsed, and his body was \u201cmutilated,\u201d but that DNA tests had proved his identity.\n\n\u201cIt was him,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThese savage monsters will not escape their fate.\u201d\n\nREAD: Trump says it's not his problem hundreds of ISIS fighters escaped Kurdish camps\n\nTrump said U.S. personnel took \u201chighly sensitive\u201d information, including documents, from the compound, much of it related to ISIS.\n\n\u201cWe took highly sensitive information from the raid, much having to do with ISIS, future plans, things we very much want,\u201d Trump said.\n\n\u201cI got to watch much of it,\u201d Trump said, praising the technology that allowed the small group in the Situation Room to watch the raid unfold in real time like \u201cwatching a movie.\u201d\n\nPeople look at a destroyed houses near the village of Barisha, in Idlib province, Syria, Sunday, Oct. 27, 2019, after an operation by the U.S. military which targeted Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the shadowy leader of the Islamic State group. (AP Photo/Ghaith Alsayed)\n\nBaghdadi took over leadership of the Islamic State in 2010 when his predecessor, Abu Omar al-Baghdadi, was killed.\n\nTrump derided Baghdadi\u2019s followers variously as \u201closers,\u201d \u201cvery frightened puppies,\u201d and \u201chard-core killers.\u201d Trump repeatedly returned to what he described as Baghdadi\u2019s cowardice in his final moments, saying Baghdadi \u201cdied like a dog,\u201d \u201cdied like a coward,\u201d and died \u201crunning and crying.\u201d\n\nHe said 11 children where pulled alive from the compound, and that two of Baghdadi's wives were killed wearing undetonated suicide vests, which slowed the recovery operation.\n\nTrump thanked Russia, Syria, Turkey, and Iraq for their help in conducting the attack, and also thanked the Syrian Kurds who provided intelligence for the operation. \u201cRussia was great, Iraq was excellent,\u201d Trump said.\n\nEarlier, the commander of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), Mazloum Abdi, called the operation an \u201chistoric, successful operation\u201d that had resulted from \u201cjoint intelligence work\u201d with the U.S.\n\nThe raid took place at a compound in Idlib province, a long way from where Baghdadi was believed to be hiding along the Syrian-Iraqi border. Idlib is controlled by jihadi rebel groups hostile to ISIS.\n\nEight helicopters landed on the scene and commandos stormed Baghdadi\u2019s hideout by blowing \u201choles in the side of the building\" to avoid the booby-trapped front entrance, Trump said.\n\nTrump said the Kurds \u201cgave us some information that turned out to be helpful\u201d \u2014 a point likely to prove controversial in light of accusations that Trump\u2019s recent pullout of U.S. troops in northeastern Syria abandoned the Kurds to an assault by Turkish forces.\n\n\n\nTrump had teased that \u201csomething very big has just happened\u201d in a tweet at 9:30 p.m. ET on Saturday night.\n\nA resident in the village of Barisha in Idlib province described a dramatic military operation late on Saturday night, telling the BBC that helicopters had launched an assault that lasted 30 minutes, firing missiles at two houses and flattening one, before troops became active on the ground.\n\n\n\nCover: An image grab taken from a video released on July 5, 2014 by Al-Furqan Media shows alleged Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi preaching during Friday prayer at a mosque in Mosul.(Photo by Al-Furqan Media/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images)\n\n", "description": "\u201cHe died after running into a dead-end tunnel, whimpering and crying and screaming all the way,\u201d Trump said.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5db59c08694a87008d66bbb4/lede/1572183050298-al-baghadadi.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.8450704225352113xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
