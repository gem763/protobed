I travelled with my wife Ola \u2013 you'll know her as one of the stars of Strictly too.\n\n\n\nBeach boy: James loved taking a dune buggy out to explore the island and find local eateries\n\nWe've been to other places in Greece before, including Halkidiki and Skiathos, and have always been impressed. Some friends had told us how much they liked Kos, so that was good enough for us.\n\n\n\nWe stayed in Psalidi, a small, modern resort on the east coast of the island and close to the capital, Kos Town. It was quiet and the perfect place for a break before putting on our dancing shoes again.\n\n\n\nThere were a number of watersports on offer at the beach, such as windsurfing and kitesurfing. I also enjoyed heading out on a jet-ski and a wakeboard \u2013 you have to use a combination of waterskiing and surfing techniques.\n\n\n\nGreek odyssey: Ola loved soaking up the sun at the couples-only resort\n\nBehind the beach was a promenade with lots of good, affordable restaurants. And when we fancied a longer stroll, we headed for Kos Town, about 25 minutes away. Among the highlights of the capital are the handsome 14th Century Neratzia Castle at the entrance to the harbour, and the famous plane tree of Hippocrates \u2013 the father of Western medicine is supposed to have given lectures under its leafy boughs.\n\n\n\nOur couples-only hotel, the four-star Oceanis Beach & Spa Resort, was a bit of a gem, set among quiet, secluded gardens.\n\n\n\nThere was plenty to keep me occupied during the day \u2013 I find it difficult to stay still for too long, while, in contrast, Ola is more than happy to soak up the sun on the beach or by the pool.\n\n\n\nBeside the watersports, I loved splashing about in the pools and there was an excellent spa at the hotel, offering hot stone massages and specialities including the socalled Anatolia Mystic treatment.\n\n\n\nWhen I could persuade Ola to leave her sunlounger, we travelled around the island in a hired dune buggy. This was a brilliant way to explore Kos.\n\n\n\nThere were ample places to eat at the hotel \u2013 a big buffet area, a stylish Italian and a Greek taverna specialising in authentic local dishes. We also visited a number of very good bars and restaurants dotted around the island during those days when we headed out in the dune buggy.\n\n\n\nCalamari, delicious Greek salads and a glass of wine... what's not to like?\n\n\n\nFortunately, I don't have to watch my diet too much. I can eat whatever I want \u2013 even junk food. That's because dancing on Strictly is the best exercise regime ever. I actually lose quite a lot of weight during the series because I'm training and practising so hard, and also because it's sometimes difficult to find the time to actually sit down and eat a proper meal.\n\n\n\nAlthough I find it hard to sit still for long on holiday, the one thing I never seem to do is dance \u2013 not even a bit of Zorba the Greek dancing!\n\n", "description": "Strictly Come Dancing stars James and Ola Jordan escape to a Greek island idyll ahead of the TV series and spend their days exploring with their own dune buggy.", "authors": ["James Jordan"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/01/19/article-0-1AA7E45500000578-94_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2014-01-19"}
