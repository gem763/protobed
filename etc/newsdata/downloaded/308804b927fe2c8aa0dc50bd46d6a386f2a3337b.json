(AP) - A Department of Veterans Affairs employee has pleaded guilty to leaking the medical records of Richard Ojeda as the former Army major was running for Congress.\n\nFederal prosecutors announced Tuesday that Jeffrey Miller has acknowledged accessing the medical records of six veterans when he was working for the VA\u2019s benefits administration.\n\nAuthorities say the 39-year-old Miller took a picture of Ojeda\u2019s records then sent the image to an unnamed acquaintance.\n\nOjeda says the records were distributed among high-ranking Republicans to derail his campaign for West Virginia\u2019s 3rd Congressional District in 2018. He sued the VA for documents related to the agency\u2019s investigation of Miller.\n\nOjeda lost to current Rep. Carol Miller.
