FEC filings show Dante made $650 a week as a policy analyst for the campaign, which de Blasio terminated last month\n\nIn the presidential campaign, Dante figured into de Blasio's biggest moment in the debates, when the candidate crowed that he was the only candidate with a black son \u2014 a remark that sent perplexed voters outside of New York scrambling to Google his family story.\n\nDe Blasio has two children with his wife Chirlane McCray, who is black, and who until meeting de Blasio in 1991 was a proud and outspoken lesbian.\n\nSoon after the first Democratic debate, Dante penned an op-ed for USA Today, describing how his father gave him 'the talk' about how to act around police officers as a young black man.\n\nIn July, Dante joined his father's campaign as a policy analyst.\n\nBill de Blasio is joined by his wife Chirlane and his son Dante at the Iowa State Fair\n\n'I've always loved politics, love learning about it, love being involved in it, and this campaign seemed like a great opportunity to get more involved in the world,' Dante told the New York Times at the time.\n\n'I expressed interest and they said we'd love to have you,' he said about joining the campaign.\n\nDe Blasio's latest FEC filings also revealed that most of his $1 million in expenses from July through September were related to his travel in early primary states.\n\nThe top donors to the campaign were members of the New York's powerful Hotel Trades Council labor union, city workers, and heiress Abigail Disney.\n\nThe campaign refunded $2,800 that actor Steve Buscemi had donated for the general election.", "description": "Dante de Blasio, who graduated from Yale University in May, made just $175 a week less than the campaign's South Carolina political director, according to FEC disclosures.", "authors": ["Keith Griffith For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/14/19788688-0-image-a-6_1571232283761.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
