There are three ongoing shifts and no easy way to synthesize them. The facts don\u2019t lend themselves to an overwhelming vision. Instead, they suggest that the planet\u2019s economic system is in the middle of a difficult and supremely important political battle with itself. As Brad Plumer, a New York Times climate reporter, tweeted last week: There are \u201ctwo radically opposed visions of the future; [it\u2019s] not yet clear which one will win out.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s into that morass that this week\u2019s New York magazine walks. In a widely shared article, David Wallace-Wells sketches the bleakest possible scenario for global warming. He warns of a planet so awash in greenhouse gas that Brooklyn\u2019s heat waves will rival Bahrain\u2019s. The breadbaskets of China and the United States will enter a debilitating and everlasting drought, he says. And millions of brains will so lack oxygen that they\u2019ll slip into a carbon-induced confusion.\n\nUnless we take aggressive action, \u201cparts of the Earth will likely become close to uninhabitable, and other parts horrifically inhospitable, as soon as the end of this century,\u201d he writes. \u201cNo matter how well-informed you are, you are surely not alarmed enough.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a scary vision\u2014which is okay, because climate change is scary. It is also an unusually specific and severe depiction of what global warming will do to the planet. And though Wallace-Wells makes it clear that he\u2019s not predicting the future, only trying to spin out the consequences of the best available science today, it\u2019s fair to ask: Is it realistic? Will this heat-wracked doomsday come to pass?\n\nMany climate scientists and professional science communicators say no. Wallace-Wells\u2019s article, they say, often flies beyond the realm of what researchers think is likely. I have to agree with them.\n\nAt key points in his piece, Wallace-Wells posits facts that mainstream climate science cannot support. In the introduction, he suggests that the world\u2019s permafrost will belch all of its methane into the atmosphere as it melts, accelerating the planet\u2019s warming in the decades to come. We don\u2019t know everything about methane yet, but the picture does not seem this bleak. Melting permafrost will emit methane, and methane is an ultra-potent greenhouse gas, but scientists do not think so much it will escape in the coming century.\n\n\u201cThe science on this is much more nuanced and doesn\u2019t support the notion of a game-changing, planet-melting methane bomb,\u201d writes Michael Mann, a climate scientist at Penn State, in a Facebook post. \u201cIt is unclear that much of this frozen methane can be readily mobilized by projected warming.\u201d\n\nAt other points, Wallace-Wells misstates what we know about the climate change that has already happened. Satellite data does not show that the world has warmed twice as fast as scientists thought, as he says; rather, the observed warming has tracked pretty close to what the models predicted. Carbon-dioxide levels only get high enough to seriously depress brain function in indoor spaces, though he implies it will become a global problem. Most importantly, we do not know nearly as much about climate change and war as he claims\u2014an idea that I will return to in a moment.", "description": "Why it's so hard to talk about the worst problem in the world", "authors": ["Robinson Meyer"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2017/07/RTSR9F3/facebook.jpg?1522774837", "published_at": "2017-07-10"}
