Smith, the CEO of Vista Equity Partners, made good on his promise to pay off student loans for the Class of 2019 at Morehouse College, donating $34 million.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nThe billionaire promised the graduates they could start their professional lives free of student loans after receiving an honorary degree from the historically black all-men\u2019s college in May. His donation, channeled through the new Student Success Program, will help more than 400 students from the class of 2019.\n\n\u201cThis liberation gift from Robert Smith -- the first of its kind to be announced at a graduation in higher education -- will be life-changing for our new Morehouse men and their families,\u201d President David A. Thomas said in a statement. \u201cIt is our hope that our graduates will use their newfound financial freedom to pursue their career goals, to lead and serve the community, and to remember the spirit of the gift given to them.\u201d\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Education, America\u2019s student loan debt currently sits at a whopping $1.6 trillion and exacerbates the wealth gap between African Americans and other groups.\n\nThe U.S. Census reports that nationwide, black households have the lowest median net worth, trailing behind Asian, white, and Latin Americans respectively, with economic status playing a huge role in the ability to repay loans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRecipients of Smith\u2019s generous endowment will be encouraged to take part in a study that will track what they do with their newfound freedom.\n\nAccording to Morehouse, typical student loan debt at graduation is between $35,000 and $40,000, which is higher than the average for historically black colleges and universities.\n\nUnited Negro College Fund research shows that graduates from the schools borrow an average $26,266, nearly twice as much as those at other institutions. One in four take out loans totaling $40,000 or more to attend college.\n\n\u201cMorehouse\u2019s program to provide debt relief to new graduates is a fund-raising opportunity that should be studied and duplicated nationally,\u201d said Michael L. Lomax, president of the United Negro College Fund. \u201cThe impact of such a gift, particularly for minority or economically disadvantaged families, could accelerate the growth of a more diverse and robust middle class.\u201d\n\nMorehouse alumni who graduated in May or finished their degree requirements during summer school in 2019, as well as their parents or guardians, are eligible to receive gifts in the inaugural offering from the Morehouse College Student Success Program.\n\nSmith\u2019s donation will cover the full payment of student loans and interest for education balances as of August 28, 2019, according to the Department of Education. The six types of loanseligible for repayment through his gift are federal subsidized loans, federal unsubsidized loans, Georgia Student Access Loans, Perkins Loans, Parent Plus Loans and private student loans processed through Morehouse College.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "Billionaire philanthropist Robert F.
