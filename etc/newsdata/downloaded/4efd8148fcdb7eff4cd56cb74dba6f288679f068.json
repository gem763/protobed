Her exit follows several resignations and terminations of SPLC leadership this year\u2014including its cofounder, who was fired amid sexual harassment allegations, and a deputy legal director who said the organization had \u201cmore work to do\u201d to guarantee a respectful workplace.\n\nBeirich has worked for the SPLC for 20 years. An expert on the neo-Confederate movement, she led the SPLC\u2019s Intelligence Project, which produced much of the center\u2019s front-facing journalism including its Intelligence Report magazine and Hatewatch blog. In a Monday memo to staff, she cited the two-decade anniversary as a reason for her departure.\n\n\u201cIt was with a heavy, heavy heart given how deeply I care about this work and all of you amazing people,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAs some of you may know, I reached my second decade here (yikes I\u2019m old!) in September and I\u2019ve felt for a while now that it may be time for a change for me. It\u2019s been a long and intense last few years for me, especially since Trump graced us with his presence and then with the challenges here at SPLC, and I am ready for a break and, after a few months of Netflix, a new start.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, Beirich said the SPLC's publications would carry on in her absence.\n\n\"I\u2019m proud of the work we have done and the work that SPLC will continue to do to shine a spotlight on hate and extremism, including continuing our Year in Hate report, our Intelligence Report magazine, the Hatewatch blog, our investigative projects and we are now looking into opportunities to expand into new media,\" Beirich wrote.\n\nThe SPLC\u2019s intelligence-gathering arm is only one component of the organization. The center has brought civil rights lawsuits for decades, and in June won a $14 million judgment against the publisher of a white supremacist website who led a harassment campaign against a Jewish woman and her family.\n\nBut the SPLC has been undergoing institutional upheaval since March, when the center fired cofounder Morris Dees. Dees, 82, founded the SPLC with two other lawyers in 1971, and brought the center to fame with successful lawsuits against the Ku Klux Klan and similar racist organizations beginning in the late '70s.\n\nBut recent decades reportedly saw internal complaints against Dees. The SPLC acknowledged this year that he was twice investigated for \u201cinappropriate conduct,\u201d although Dees denies wrongdoing. In March, two separate sets of SPLC employees penned letters to the center\u2019s leadership, referencing allegations of sexual harassment and racial discrimination connected to Dees.\n\n\u201cAllegations of mistreatment, sexual harassment, gender discrimination and racism threaten the moral authority of this organization and our integrity along with it,\u201d one of the employee groups wrote.\n\nThe SPLC publicly announced Dees\u2019 firing hours after employees sent the letter, The New York Times reported. His firing was reportedly the result of the second misconduct investigation against him. The second group of employees alleged the problems went further than Dees and penned a letter after his firing accusing SPLC leadership of being \u201ccomplicit in decades of racial discrimination, gender discrimination, and sexual harassment and/or assault.\u201d\n\nBeirich was among those who supported Dees\u2019 ouster, multiple people familiar with the organization told The Daily Beast.\n\nSPLC President Richard Cohen resigned the following week \u201cin order to give the organization the best chance to heal.\u201d\n\nOther March resignations included SPLC legal director Rhonda Brownstein and deputy legal director Meredith Horton. Horton claimed in her resignation announcement that the SPLC had \u201cmore work to do\u201d to become \u201ca place where everyone is heard and respected and where the values we are committed to pursuing externally are also being practiced internally,\u201d the Times reported.\n\nThe center announced that it would undergo workplace culture review, prompted by Dees\u2019 dismissal. That review is reportedly ongoing.\n\nThis story has been updated with a statement from Beirich.", "description": "It\u2019s the latest move in an ongoing shakeup at the anti-hate organization that began when a cofounder left under a cloud.", "authors": ["Kelly Weill"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_2398,w_4264,x_0,y_247/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1572281119/GettyImages-904354508_pudpuh", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
