She was also based in Washington, D.C., when the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks happened and covered the aftermath.\n\nWhile posted in London as CBC's Europe correspondent, she reported on the 2004 Madrid train bombings and the 2007 assassination of former Pakistani prime minister Benazir Bhutto. That same year, Lynch went undercover to report on the Zimbabwe election when Western journalists were barred from entering the country.\n\nIt's that critical, on-the-ground understanding of what people are going through that Lynch says she aims to bring to The Current.\n\nLynch has been close to The Current since the show hit the CBC Radio airwaves. In the summer of 2003, she became the first guest host to lead the 90-minute program while Anna Maria Tremonti was away.\n\nThe Current's top post has been vacant since Tremonti left in June after 17 seasons of hosting the acclaimed show in order to produce and host new, original podcasts for CBC.\n\nA permanent host will be named later in the season.", "description": "Laura Lynch, a longtime CBC political reporter and foreign correspondent, will debut at the helm of CBC Radio's national weekday morning current affairs program on Monday.", "authors": ["Cbc Radio"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5264395.1567107103!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/laura-lynch.jpg"}
