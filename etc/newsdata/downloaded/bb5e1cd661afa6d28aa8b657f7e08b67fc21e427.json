Nothing looks serious from tonight,\" he said.\n\n\"We had a couple of guys who were pretty sore after the Fiji game -- two or three of them -- but they should be back training in a couple of days so we should have a full complement to be able to choose from.\"\n\nWhen the final whistle blew Wales had enjoyed 66 percent of possession and 73 percent of territory, yet it took three tries in the last 15 minutes to give them a respectable scoreline.\n\nFor most of the match it was a sloppy display, although Wales at least completed pool play unbeaten for the first time since the inaugural World Cup in 1987.\n\nUruguay, who shocked Fiji in their tournament opener, threatened an even bigger upset when they trailed by only one point at half-time.\n\nWales had dominated all the right statistics, forcing Uruguay to make 90 tackles while missing 19 more in the opening 40 minutes.\n\nBut they seemed bereft of ideas and finesse, letting themselves down with a succession of knock-ons, and turned only 7-6 ahead.\n\nGatland, who made 13 changes to the side that started against Fiji on Wednesday, could not have been impressed with the high error-count.\n\nWales camped inside the Uruguay 22 for most of the first 16 minutes before they were eventually rewarded with a try.\n\nBradley Davies had lost the ball close to the line early in the match and Aaron Shingler put a foot in touch as he dived for the line, before prop Nicky Smith broke the deadlock when he drove over from close range.\n\nWales were unable to score again in the half, blowing another scoring opportunity when Hadleigh Parkes and Hallam Amos combined in a 50-metre run only for the final pass to float forward.\n\nIt was the first of three times Amos crossed the line and each time the try was ruled out -- twice for forward passes, and one knock-on.\n\nUruguay, meanwhile, made the most of the scraps that went their way with Felipe Berchesi landing two penalties to keep the pressure on Wales.\n\nJosh Adams, Wales' three-try hero against Fiji, opened the scoring in the second half to push Wales out to a 14-6 lead before their late scoring burst.\n\nWhen Uruguay flanker Santiago Civetta was yellow-carded for repeated fouls, Wales used the one-man advantage to drive at the line which resulted in a penalty try.\n\nUruguay were not done and fought back to drive over for a try of their own to hooker German Kessler.\n\nBut Wales had too much energy at the end and Tomos Williams added a fourth try before Davies scampered 40 metres for Wales's final five-pointer.\n\nScorers\n\nWales\n\nTries: Nicky Smith, Josh Adams, Tomos Williams, Gareth Davies, Penalty Try\n\nConversions: Leigh Halfpenny (4)\n\nUruguay\n\nTry: German Kessler\n\nConversion: Felipe Berchesi\n\nPenalties: Felipe Berchesi (2)\n\nTeams\n\nWales\n\n15 Leigh Halfpenny, 14 Josh Adams, 13 Owen Watkin, 12 Hadleigh Parkes, 11 Hallam Amos, 10 Rhys Patchell, 9 Aled Davies, 8 Aaron Wainwright, 7 Justin Tipuric (captain), 6 Aaron Shingler, 5 Adam Beard, 4 Bradley Davies, 3 Dillon Lewis, 2 Ryan Elias, 1 Nicky Smith.\n\nSubstitutes: 16 Elliot Dee, 17 Rhys Carre, 18 Wyn Jones, 19 Jake Ball, 20 Ross Moriarty, 21 James Davies, 22 Tomos Williams, 23 Gareth Davies.\n\nUruguay\n\n15 Gaston Mieres, 14 Leandro Leivas, 13 Juan Manuel Cat, 12 Andres Vilaseca, 11 Nicolas Freitas, 10 Felipe Berchesi, 9 Santiago Arata, 8 Alejandro Nieto, 7 Santiago Civetta, 6 Juan Manuel Gaminara, 5 Manuel Leindekar, 4 Ignacio Dotti, 3 Diego Arbelo, 2 German Kessler, 1 Mateo Sanguinetti.\n\nSubstitutes:16 Guillermo Pujadas, 17 Juan Echeverria, 18 Juan Pedro Rombys, 19 Diego Magno, 20 Manuel Diana, 21 Agustin Ormaechea, 22 Tomas Inciarte, 23 Rodrigo Silva.", "description": "Wales have beaten Uruguay in a Rugby World Cup Pool D clash at Kumamoto Stadium.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/5456/5b02aa526cea4b09ac4cc81307f4285d.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
