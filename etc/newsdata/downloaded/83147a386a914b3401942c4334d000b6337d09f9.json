Push him off.\u201d\n\nThe teenager was then shoved off and once he hit the ground he was Tasered by other officers.\n\nAmazingly, the suspect was unharmed from the fall and the Taser but according to an internal investigation by the Kissimmee Police Department, he could have easily been seriously injured.\n\nKissimmee Police chief Jeff O\u2019Dell said the suspect could have gotten a \u201csignificant injury\u201d.\n\nAccording to reports, the police officers involved were Sgt Anthony Amada and officer Plenio Massiah, but the suspect has not been named.\n\nMr Amada resigned from the police in June, when the internal investigation started, after being disciplined for a separate case, WFTV reports.\n\nThe police report said he would have been fired for the incident and his order to push the man was \u201cnot indicative of a supervisor with 14 years of experience\u201d.\n\nMr Massiah was previously at the Daytona Beach Police Department before working in Kissimmee.\n\nWFTV say that his records show this it the first time he has been disciplined. He was suspended for eight hours over the incident.\n\nThe police report also says that Mr Massiah feared that a struggle between him and the suspect could have led to them both falling off.", "description": "A US police\u00a0officer pushed a teenage suspect in a car theft off a roof, his department has said.\u00a0 The sergeant who ordered his colleague to push the 18-year-old off the roof would have been fired had he not already resigned, the department said.\u00a0 Bodycam footage has been\u00a0released showing the incident unfold in Kissimmee, Florida.
