Revenue for the quarter was EUR7.79 billion, up 13%, while SAP's closely watched revenue from cloud subscriptions and support increased by 37% to EUR1.79 billion.\n\nSAP had already reported some preliminary figures for the quarter earlier in the month, when it said that Bill McDermott, then chief executive, would step down. Executive board members Jennifer Morgan and Christian Klein were named co-CEOs at the time.\n\nThe company reiterated its full-year guidance, continuing to expect non-IFRS cloud revenue of between EUR6.7 billion and EUR7.0 billion at constant currencies and non-IFRS operating profit between EUR7.85 billion and EUR8.05 billion at constant currencies.\n\nThe company said it expects total revenue to increase strongly in the full year at a rate lower than operating profit.\n\nWrite to Max Bernhard at max.bernhard@dowjones.com; @mxbernhard\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 21, 2019 01:42 ET (05:42 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
