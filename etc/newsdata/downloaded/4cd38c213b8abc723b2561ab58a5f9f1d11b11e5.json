She set herself on fire outside the court and died a week later in hospital.\n\nHer death caused widespread grief and outrage, both within and outside Iran.\n\nFootball players and fans around the world have also been paying tribute to Ms Khodayari. Footballers from some European women's teams have been wearing blue armbands during matches, in her memory.\n\nFifa itself has faced growing criticism, with people calling for the body to suspend or ban Iran's football federation.\n\nWhat did Fifa say?\n\nFifa officials have spent a week in Iran discussing the 10 October match against Cambodia, Iran's first home game of the 2022 qualifying competition.\n\n\"We need to have women attending,\" Mr Infantino told a Fifa conference on women's football.\n\n\"We have been assured that as of the next international game of Iran... women will be allowed to enter football stadiums. This is something very important - in 40 years this has not happened, with a couple of exceptions.\"\n\nAlthough Iranian women have been banned from watching men's teams play, foreign women have been allowed limited access to stadiums in order to watch these matches.\n\nWhile the sporting ban is not written into law, it is \"ruthlessly enforced\", Human Rights Watch says.\n\nThe ban was temporarily lifted last year to allow women to watch the World Cup being streamed at a stadium in Tehran.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Hundreds of Iranian women watched their first men's football match at the World Cup last year\n\nLast November, there were hopes of more long-term change when a group of women were allowed to enter the second leg of the Asian Champions League final in Tehran. Mr Infantino was also at that match.\n\nHowever, women have been denied access to matches since.", "description": "Fifa says it received assurances from Iranian authorities, after the death of a woman this month.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/175E8/production/_108902759_gettyimages-979610696-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
