September top 10 pound-for-pound boxers in the world 1/11 Who is the best pound-for-pound boxer in the world? The ranking of The Independent's 10 best male boxers on the planet. Take a look through to see who comes out on top. AP 2/11 10. Manny Pacquiao (62-7-2) The Filipino looked sensational to outpoint Keith Thurman, flooring the American and rolling back the years at 40 years old to confirm himself as the No 3 welterweight in the world at worst. Considering the illustrious names on his resume, a place inside the top 10 pound-for-pound list and a world class win this year confirms his place here. AP 3/11 9. Juan Francisco Estrada (39-3-0) The two-weight world champion grabbed the lineal super flyweight title against Sor Rungvisai to snatch his pound-for-pound status and the WBC gold. Getty Images 4/11 8. Mikey Garcia (39-1-0) Despite coming up short against Errol Spence in their welterweight bout, Garcia is still a modern great as a four-weight world champion. Getty Images 5/11 7. Gennady Golovkin (38-1-1) Despite suffering the first loss of his career against Canelo Alvarez, Golovkin's stellar career keeps him in our rankings. Getty Images 6/11 6. Errol Spence (26-0-0) Spence beat Shawn Porter to unify the welterweight division as he goes in search of more belts. Danny Garcia looks set to be next. Getty Images 7/11 5. Oleksandr Usyk (16-0-0) The undisputed, undefeated, unified cruiserweight world champion moves up in weight, but injury has delayed his debut against Carlos Takam. Getty Images 8/11 4. Naoya Inoue (18-0-0) The man nicknamed the 'monster' destroyed Emmanuel Rodriguez in two rounds to win the IBF world bantamweight title, elevating his status as one of the world's most dangerous fighters. Getty Images 9/11 3. Terence Crawford (35-0-0) Another three-weight world champion, Crawford enters our top three and reaffirmed his place as one of the sport's greats after a knockout win against Amir Khan. Getty Images 10/11 2. Canelo Alvarez (52-1-2) One loss and a whole heap of controversy but Canelo's record is one to be celebrated, a three-weight world champion and still just 28. The biggest star in the sport and an impressive win over Daniel Jacobs cements his standing, arguably has a claim to the throne, but he just misses out here. Getty Images 11/11 1. Vasyl Lomachenko (14-1-0) There can only be one. The king of the amateur game has stepped up to become the king of the professionals. Just 15 fights into his career and despite one career defeat, the current unified lightweight world champion sets records for days. Loma won a world title in his third fight, became a two-weight champion in his seventh, and a three-weight champion in his twelfth fight. The king. Less magic against a brave Luke Campbell, but more brutality, slashing body shots and exquisite balance and movement. Who's next? Commey, Lopez, Davis?

Getty Images\n\nIn typical Haney fashion, the young, confident and brash newcomer had no problems settling in. \u201cOn my first day, they put me in there to spar a kickboxer but he was working on his standup game, and when I hit him I literally hit him out of his shoes, he had on some velcro and he went out.\u201d\n\nHaney is in London to sell himself to the UK public. He has already sparred with the three-time world champions Ricky Burns, performed a media workout at the underground Rathbone Boxing Club in London and spent some of his hard-earned cash in Harrods.\n\nA win over the Russian Zaur Abdullaev just two weeks ago has further helped to boost his profile. The 20-year-old nicknamed \u2018The Truth\u2019 made his opponent retire in between rounds after punishing head and body punches meant he could take no more.\n\nNow, one of the greatest boxers the world has ever seen awaits. The imperious Vasyl Lomachenko currently holds the WBA (Super), WBO and WBC lightweight belts, having previously been the WBO featherweight and junior lightweight world champion. He is ranked as the world\u2019s best active boxer, pound for pounds, by ESPN, the Boxing Writers Association of America, the Transnational Boxing Rankings Board and The Independent.\n\nAnd yet Haney and his team thinks that he can beat him.\n\n\u201cLomachenko don\u2019t want none of this work,\u201d Haney\u2019s team cry as he pounds the heavy bag, grunting heavier and heavier with each blow.\n\nHaney stands as mandatory challenger to Lomachenko\u2019s WBC title, and he doesn\u2019t want to waste time.\n\n\u201cMy body is still growing, maturing and I\u2019ve been saying that 135lbs is not easy for me to make. I don\u2019t know how much longer I can be there, once I\u2019m bumped up to world champion, hopefully I can unify or see what happens but I will not move up to 140lbs without becoming world champion. I\u2019m taking every weight class at its time and I will become a multi-division, multi-title world champion.\u201d\n\nDespite being just 20, Haney already has a storied professional record. He joined the pro ranks aged just 16, meaning that he was too young to fight in his native country. Instead, he travelled south of the border, spending his formative months in the sport fighting faceless Mexicans at the Billar El Perro Salado, a small club in Tijuana.\n\n\u201cTwo years before the Olympics they changed the minimum age to 19, I was 17 around the last Olympics,\u201d Haney says, disappointed to not have the chance to represent his country.\n\n\u201cThey changed the age and took headgear off but it\u2019s alright, I\u2019m OK with it and how my career has gone so far. I\u2019m OK with not going to the Olympics.\u201d\n\nHaney is the youngest in a hungry trio of fighters coming up in the lightweight ranks. Future bouts against 21-year-old Ryan Garcia and 22-year-old Teofimo Lopez already appear inevitable.\n\n\u201cTeofimo is a good, young fighter. He\u2019s doing good, he has a world title fight [against IBF champion Richard Commey] and I think he\u2019s going to win. Of course [it\u2019s a fight I want], we\u2019ll see what happens.\n\n\u201c2020, three fights. Luke Campbell, Ryan Garcia, Lomachenko. Those are three fights that the fans would love to see.\u201d\n\nGarcia poses a different challenge, a fighter with an appeal a casual audience can get behind. He is a social media superstar with more than 3 million Instagram followers along with a popular YouTube show that he stars in. And Haney wants in.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a rivalry, I don\u2019t like him,\u201d Haney jokes before laughing his own comments off.\n\n\u201cI like what he\u2019s doing, hopefully we can make that fight in 2020 or 2021, coming out of the amateurs, we\u2019re tied so in the pros we have to break that.\u201d\n\nHaney will next fight on the KSI-Logan Paul rematch undercard on 9 November. The show has come under scrutiny for featuring world champions of the sport on the undercard of two YouTubers. But Haney says he is just excited by the prospect of being seen by his biggest audience yet.\n\n\u201cI knew who they were from the last fight they did, I didn\u2019t get a chance to watch it but I knew who they were, the numbers they generated and how much buzz they get so I was with it right when he brought it to me.\u201d\n\nFor Haney, the fight presents him with a chance to burst into the big time. The very fact that he will be fighting on the card is testament to his commitment and perseverance. Because \u2013 remarkably for one of the most exciting young stars in the sport \u2013 until he recently signed with Eddie Hearn\u2019s Matchroom Boxing, he did not have a promotional company. Offers from the likes of Bob Arum, Oscar de la Hoya and Al Haymon could not tempt him, who was sold on the idea of setting himself up for life after the sport.\n\nBut then Matchroom USA made him an offer.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m setting myself up for after boxing, I talk with Eddie a lot about when I\u2019m done, I can\u2019t box forever.\u201d Hearn interjects: \u201cHe\u2019s 20 years old living in Vegas, what would we be doing if we were 20 living in Vegas? Not what Devin Haney is doing which is getting up, running at 2am, 10-15 miles.\n\n\u201cHis discipline is unbelievable and sometimes you\u2019ve got to check that he\u2019s 23-0, 20 years of age, WBC interim world champion and about to become WBC lightweight champion. I believe it will be the first of five weight class world championships, I believe he\u2019s that good. He has that drive. When he wins a world title, he won\u2019t be satisfied, he\u2019ll push himself, whether that\u2019s unifying or moving up a weight class.\n\n\u201cThe biggest and best future of American boxing is Devin Haney, even global boxing. The hype is real.\u201d\n\nThe 20-year-old has a long road ahead of him until all of that. But that doesn\u2019t stop him dreaming. And given all that he has already overcome \u2013 who on earth would bet against him?\n\n\u201cI want my name to be mentioned with the greats,\u201d Haney says as he finishes his workout and the crowd begins to dwindle. \u201cWhen people think of Devin Haney I want them to think of him as a great fighter, they put my name with the greats of the sport, in the hall of fame one day.\u201d", "description": "At 20-years-old Devin Haney is the future of boxing, but the rising star found his way into the sport in a predictably old-fashioned way.
