REUTERS/Rupak De Chowdhuri/Files\n\nBENGALURU (Reuters) - State Bank of India (SBI.NS) (SBI) reported a three-fold jump in quarterly profit and beat market expectations on Friday as asset quality at the country\u2019s largest lender improved, sending shares up more than 7%.\n\nGross bad loans as a percentage of total loans eased to 7.19% in second quarter ended Sept. 30 compared with 7.53% in the prior quarter and 9.95% a year earlier.\n\nThe Mumbai-based lender\u2019s performance is a bright spot in India\u2019s banking industry where weak loan growth due to a sluggish economy has compounded the near $150-billion bad loan problem.\n\nThe public sector bank\u2019s results come against the backdrop of rising stress in the corporate books of private sector banks such Axis Bank Ltd (AXBK.NS) and Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd (KTKM.NS).\n\nEarlier this week, Kotak said it was cutting its expectation for full-year loan growth. SBI on Friday maintained its credit growth expectation at 12% for the full year and said slippages, or fresh addition of bad loans, dropped 17.9% to 88.05 billion rupees in the quarter.\n\nChairman Rajnish Kumar said the bank was looking at a slippage ratio of 2% for the year, slightly higher than 1.60% in fiscal 2019.\n\nSBI said a one-time gain of 34.84 billion rupee from the stake sale of its life insurance unit helped it shore up provisions for stressed loans related to a power sector company and a non-banking financial firm.\n\n\u201cThe management\u2019s indication that they have already made sufficient provisions cheered the market of the bank\u2019s prudence to take care of any future liabilities,\u201d Saurabh Jain, assistant vice-president research, SMC Global Securities, said.\n\nThe bank\u2019s net interest income climbed 17.7% to 246 billion rupees in the quarter, while net interest margin, a key indicator of a bank\u2019s profitability, rose to 3.22%, up 42 basis points from a year ago.", "description": "State Bank of India (SBI) reported a three-fold jump in quarterly profit and beat market expectations on Friday as asset quality at the country's largest lender improved, sending shares up more than 7%.", "authors": ["Chris Thomas", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191025&t=2&i=1444803284&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9O0LB", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
