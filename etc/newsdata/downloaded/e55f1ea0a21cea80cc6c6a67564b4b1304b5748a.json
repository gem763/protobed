But it did have enough of an impact to start this week on a sour note.\n\n\n\nThe dipped 0.52% (or nearly 143 points) on Monday to 27,076.82, putting an end to 8 consecutive sessions in the green stemming from encouraging news on the trade front with China.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the S&P closed below 3000 again with a dip of 0.31% to 2997.96, while the NASDAQ was off 0.28% (or about 23 points) to 8153.54.\n\n\n\nThese indices have put together three straight positive weeks and they still have a good chance of making it four in a row. Even with all of today's troubles, the Dow and S&P remain approximately 1% away from new highs despite today\u2019s pullback.\n\n\n\nIt looks like Iran was behind the attacks, but President Trump doesn\u2019t plan to be hasty in responding.\n\n\n\nDespite this Middle Eastern drama, the big story this week continues to be the Fed meeting, which starts tomorrow.\n\n\n\nInvestors aren't going to let a drone attack divert their attention from the Committee\u2019s rate decision on Wednesday. Of course, they are counting on another cut of at least a quarter-point.\n\n\n\nStocks did not react as sharply to the oil disruption as energy prices did, which means there\u2019s still a good chance that we could see new highs in the coming days.\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s just hope there are no more surprises\u2026\n\n\n\nToday's Portfolio Highlights:\n\n\n\nBlockchain Innovators: The peer-to-peer lending space is fertile ground for blockchain, since the technology can help streamline the business by weeding out inefficiencies. That was the basis for today\u2019s addition of LendingClub (LC), a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) online financial services company that is expected to grow revenue 12.3% this year and another 13% next year. Read the full write-up for more on this new addition.\n\n\n\nTechnology Innovators: The portfolio is getting back into the security space with the addition of Radware (RDWR), a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) provider of a broad range of Internet traffic management solutions. The company has an impressive record of easily beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate with an average earnings surprise of more than 90% over the past four quarters. Most recently, it beat by more than 83%. The stock had a rough August, but Brian believes its poised to head higher.

Today it sold:\n\n\n\n\u2022 NRG Energy (NYSE: , +6.9%)\n\n\u2022 Arconic (ARNC, +5.8%)\n\n\u2022 T-Mobile US (NASDAQ: , +0.7%)\n\n\n\nThe new buys that replaced these names are:\n\n\n\n\u2022 CVS Health (NYSE: )\n\n\u2022 GMS (GMS)\n\n\u2022 Walmart (NYSE: )\n\n\n\nRead the Black Box Trader\u2019s Guide to learn more about this computer-driven service designed to take the emotion out of investing.\n\n\n\nOptions Trader: \"But it\u2019s clear that the U.S. energy market is night and day different than what it was 15-20 years ago and longer. As recently as 2005, we imported roughly 60% of our consumption needs. That number is now less than 19%. (The net number however is much smaller).\n\n\n\n\"Once upon a time, a big disruption like that would have wreaked havoc on our economy. Now, the U.S. can brush it off. And since one person\u2019s cost is another person\u2019s profit, the U.S. companies that export their energy products are actually benefitting.\n\n\n\n\"While we hope Saudi Arabia\u2019s production can get back to normal asap so it doesn\u2019t cause hardships for others, the U.S. is in a strong position where we can weather these types of situations.\" -- Kevin Matras\n\n\n\nAll the Best,\n\nJim Giaquinto\n\nRecommendations from Zacks' Private Portfolios:Believe it or not, this article is not available on the Zacks.com website.
