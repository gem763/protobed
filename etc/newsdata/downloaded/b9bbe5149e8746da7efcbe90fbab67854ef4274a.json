That privilege is so special, you can get caught wearing blackface on multiple times and still be endorsed by America's first black president. We have also heard for three years now how awful it is to interfere in a foreign election. The left has said its always wrong when our political leaders try to pressure foreigners to act one way or the other. Well, President Barack Obama didn't seem to care about either Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's questionable make-up nor in election interference. He just endorsed Trudeau ahead of Canada's upcoming election.\n\n\"I was proud to work with Justin Trudeau as President,\" President Obama tweeted. \"He's a hard-working, effective leader who takes on big issues like climate change. The world needs his progressive leadership now, and I hope our neighbors to the north support him for another term.\"\n\nI was proud to work with Justin Trudeau as President.

They left that task to elementary school girls as I wrote about last week.\n\nObama probably won't be questioned on the bogus accusation of foreign election interference either. Trump probably would be, but that's not the point. The larger point is that Obama knows he won't be taken to task by the mainstream media on any of those things simply by virtue of being a progressive.\n\nOn this story, yet again, it seems like our parody news websites predicted the future. In September, in wake of the first photos of Trudeau being released, the Babylon Bee released an article titled, Ralph Northam Assures Trudeau His Political Career Will Suffer No Consequences Whatsoever. Northam, of course, is the Virginia Democratic governor who admitted to wearing blackface on multiple occasions last winter.\n\nIt's almost like our fake news websites are more accurate than our \"real\" news websites. Must be nice to be a leftist. You get a pass and a slap on the back for everything you do.", "description": ".10/16/2019 16:34:54PM EST.", "authors": ["Timothy Meads", "Matt Vespa", "Bronson Stocking", "Cortney O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2015/324/2cd5ee83-fe38-45ec-9991-add0f4a8c3f5.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
