Though only a fourth-round pick by Washington in 2012, the eighth player selected at his position that spring, Cousins made a clear impression on Gruden with his attention to detail and ability to communicate. Gruden even remarked at the end of that episode that perhaps he\u2019d get back in the game to coach him.\n\nWell, this week, Gruden and the Oakland Raiders have been scheming against Cousins, who will try to bounce back for the Minnesota Vikings on Sunday from one of the worst performances as a pro.\n\n\u201cHe works hard at football. He\u2019s had a lot of production,\u201d said Gruden, who took over as coach of the Raiders last season. \u201cHopefully we can find a way to slow him down and win a football game.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what Green Bay did last weekend, when Cousins posted the second-worst completion percentage of his career and committed three turnovers in a 21-16 defeat. The comeback bid was waylaid by a first-and-goal interception in the end zone, an off-balance throw he said afterward he should\u2019ve sent to the seats. Vikings coach Mike Zimmer expressed anew the team\u2019s confidence in Cousins, who\u2019s in the second season of a three-year, $84 million, fully guaranteed contract.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to play well to earn peoples\u2019 confidence, so if he\u2019s saying that, it\u2019s because he\u2019s seen practice reps, he\u2019s seen game reps, he\u2019s seen what we\u2019re capable of as an offense throwing the football,\u201d Cousins said. \u201cSo you\u2019ve got to go out and earn it. Believe me, I\u2019m not going to be playing quarterback here if I go out and play the way I did this past Sunday for much longer. So I understand that, and I look forward to getting out there and playing at a much higher level.\u201d\n\nHere are some other angles to follow on Sunday:\n\nROAD TRIPPING\n\nThe Raiders (1-1) have begun this week a whopping 48-day stretch without a game at the Oakland Coliseum. After visiting the Vikings, the Raiders will travel to Indianapolis, then London for a \u201chome\u201d game against Chicago. After their bye week, they go back on the road to play Green Bay and Houston. The Raiders won\u2019t play in Oakland again until Nov. 3 against Detroit.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still trying to understand how that happened, but we\u2019re going to have to deal with it,\u201d said Gruden, whose team went 1-7 on the road last year. \u201cWe\u2019ve just got to showcase our mental toughness and deal with it. It\u2019s uncommon, maybe unprecedented, maybe unrealistic that this should ever happen in pro football. I\u2019m not excited about it, but we\u2019ll adapt and do it the best we can.\u201d\n\nINCOGNITO RETURNS\n\nThe Raiders will get a boost on the offensive line this week when left guard Richie Incognito makes his debut for the team. The four-time Pro Bowl pick missed the first two games, while suspended for violating the NFL personal conduct policy. He\u2019s eager as ever to see the field for the first time since a Jan. 7, 2018, playoff game with Buffalo. Incognito did not play at all last season.\n\n\u201cAll the negative stuff is behind me. Just eyes forward, staying positive,\u201d he said. \u201cRelishing the opportunity, enjoying every day in here because you don\u2019t know how many more you\u2019re going to have.\u201d\n\nBURFICT, BEWARE\n\nAnother talented veteran with a troubled past who joined the Raiders this year, linebacker Vontaze Burfict, is well-known to Zimmer, who was the defensive coordinator for Cincinnati during his first three NFL seasons. Burfict has been repeatedly fined and suspended by the league throughout his career for late, violent hits.\n\n\u201cHe knows the defense as well as anybody, probably as well as I do. He\u2019s very instinctive. He\u2019s very athletic. He reads things extremely quick, and he\u2019s a thumper,\u201d Zimmer said. \u201cWe better make sure the officials know he has to play clean.\u201d\n\nGruden wasn\u2019t having that.\n\n\u201cBurfict\u2019s played for us for two games. He hasn\u2019t had any penalties. So I don\u2019t know about all that,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cHe\u2019s had a bulls-eye on him in his career in Cincinnati, and I\u2019m sure the referees are looking out for him. I don\u2019t think the refs need any more help than they already have.\u201d\n\nThe Vikings, though, were prepared to keep their head on a swivel when catching a pass in traffic.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve all lost our emotions at times, or what have you, so I think he\u2019s learned from that stuff, and I think he\u2019s been a pretty clean football player recently,\u201d wide receiver Adam Thielen said.\n\nFAST START, SLOW FINISH\n\nThe Raiders have made a bad habit in one-plus season under Gruden of stalling by the offense after fast starts. They\u2019re tied for fifth in the NFL with an average of 2.83 points per drive on their first possession since the start of 2018, but that production has dropped to barely half of that over the rest of the game, with an average of 1.46 points per drive following their opening possession. Last week against Kansas City, Oakland had 10 points after two drives but didn\u2019t score the rest of the game.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always been able to start fast, which is good, and hopefully we can do that again this week but then maintain it and then cut out the penalties,\u201d quarterback Derek Carr said.\n\nRUNNING MEN\n\nThe Vikings, with Dalvin Cook leading the NFL in rushing, aren\u2019t the only team in this pass-favored league that\u2019s content to keep the ball on the ground. Rookie Josh Jacobs, one of three first-round draft picks by the Raiders, has 184 rushing yards, fourth in the NFL.\n\n\u201cHe runs hard, for sure,\u201d Vikings defensive end Everson Griffen said. \u201cHe has the quickness to get the ball outside and cut it outside quick. He\u2019s a downhill runner, and he can make the big play.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "During his nine-year hiatus from the NFL sideline, Jon Gruden evaluated players like he was still a coach, drawing particular attention as an analyst for ESPN for his one-on-one film breakdowns with quarterback prospects entering the draft.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Dave Campbell"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/19/vikings_packers_football_52638_c0-259-4341-2790_s1770x1032.jpg?1cfeca748c503fb264d0be69b79c6935f69b2756", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
