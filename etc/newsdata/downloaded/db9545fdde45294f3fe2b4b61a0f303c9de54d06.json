Having promised to pull the U.K. out of the European Union by October 31, the prime minister is now in the uncomfortable position of being unable to deliver unless he can win back his majority.\n\nAnd timing is crucial.\n\nIf Johnson fights an election on his preferred date of October 15 he can make a play for Leave voters up and down the country with a promise to put an end to the current Brexit impasse come what may by the end of the month. If he is forced to wait until November, he is vulnerable to Nigel Farage's Brexit Party peeling away voters who may by then have lost faith in the Tories' ability to deliver on the U.K.'s departure from the EU.\n\nJohnson could try to circumvent the requirement for a two-thirds majority by calling a no confidence motion in his own government.\n\nOpposition parties know this, and on Friday agreed a united position to block an election before they have a cast-iron guarantee that a no-deal Brexit cannot happen. But Johnson still has a few cards up his sleeve.\n\nJohnson asks again\n\nThe prime minister will call for an early election again on Monday night, after the bill aimed at blocking a no-deal Brexit receives royal assent and is added to the statute book. Under the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act, if Johnson wants to call an election in the middle of the usual parliamentary term, he would need two-thirds of MPs to vote for it. Johnson has three days to persuade the Tory MPs he expelled from the party early this week to back him again \u2014 a big ask.\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn said last week that his party would be willing to vote for an election once the bill became law. But on Friday, Corbyn and other U.K. opposition leaders agreed not to back Johnson\u2019s demand before the European Council summit on October 17-18.\n\nThe opposition insists that the priority should be taking the possibility of a no-deal Brexit off the table before an election is held. Labour argues that a re-strengthened Johnson, back from the polls with a majority, could hold votes in parliament to remove any barriers to taking the country out of the EU without a deal on October 31.\n\nVote of no confidence\n\nJohnson could try to circumvent the requirement for a two-thirds majority by calling a no confidence motion in his own government.\n\nThe Fixed-Term Parliaments Act appears to allow for this (although it has never been done) and it only requires a simple majority of MPs. That would kick off a 14-day period during which another government can be formed.\n\nIf no alternative government emerges, an election is triggered automatically and Johnson must advise the queen about the date.\n\nSome have argued, however, that this would be a step too far for any prime minister to take. Mark Harper, a Conservative MP and former minister for political and constitutional reform, said during the passage of the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act in 2011 that it would be \u201cabsolutely unconstitutional\u201d for a prime minister to behave that way.\n\nHe later stood by these comments in evidence to a parliamentary inquiry, saying that while it would be \u201clegally permissible,\u201d taking this route would be \u201crunning against the spirit of the legislation and would not be something that would be appropriate.\u201d\n\nBrigid Fowler, senior researcher at the Hansard Society, said this could open up \u201canother big argument about whether or not the government is abusing the intention of the Act and acting unconstitutionally.\u201d\n\nIt would also require the prime minister and his MPs to vote to say they have no confidence in their own leader and government \u2014 a difficult sell for voters. At the same time the opposition might try to thwart the move by voting that they have confidence in the prime minister. Strange times.\n\nChange of rules\n\nJohnson could also try to break free of the constraints of the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act by passing legislation to override its provisions. This could take the form of a very short bill, which the government should present by Monday night and pass by Thursday at the latest, before Johnson shuts parliament down.\n\nThe advantages are two-fold: the prime minister would only need a simple majority, and he could call an election on a date of his choice, which would probably be written in the bill.\n\nThe opposition could also maneuver in unpredictable ways, as this bill could be amended in both the Commons and the House of Lords, and the prime minister has no majority in either of them.\n\nNovember election\n\nBlocked from having an early election in October, Johnson could reluctantly hold a November ballot.\n\nThis is not ideal politically because by then he will \u2014 assuming he doesn't resign \u2014 have been forced to ask Brussels for a three-month Brexit extension in the event that no fresh deal has been struck by October 19.\n\nJohnson has said he would rather be \u201cdead in a ditch\u201d than delay Brexit. Breaking this promise would likely boost the Brexit Party votes and push Corbyn a bit closer to Number 10 Downing Street.\n\nUK NATIONAL PARLIAMENT ELECTION POLL OF POLLS\n\nFor more polling data from across Europe visit POLITICO Poll of Polls.\n\nResign\n\nThe logical conclusion of Johnson's \"do or die\" promise on Brexit is that if he fails to \"do\" he will have to \"die\" \u2014 politically at least.\n\nIn stepping down, he would need to advise Queen Elizabeth II on who is most likely to muster the confidence of the Commons to form a new government. The new prime minister would be under the same legal obligation to request a Brexit extension.\n\nThe Tories could try to return to Number 10 shortly after by calling a vote of no confidence in the government \u2014 they would just need a simple majority.\n\nJohnson has the coming weekend to consider his options, though none look like an easy win. \u201cWithout an election, and unless the government is able to rebuild its majority somehow, it will find it incredibly difficult to make progress on anything at all, Brexit or otherwise,\u201d said Marshall. \"This would be an unsustainable position for the government to be in.\u201d\n\nDo a deal\n\nThe wild-card scenario would be for Johnson to do something that most observers are highly skeptical he can pull off \u2014 agree a fresh deal with the EU that removes the backstop as it currently stands. The lack of detailed proposals from the U.K. government for alternative arrangements for the Irish border suggests that ministers realize there simply isn't time to work these up and agree them with Brussels by mid-October. But there is another potential way forward.\n\nAs Brussels is keen to remind the Brits, the current backstop \u2014 which involves keeping all of the U.K. in the EU's customs territory \u2014 was a London invention. The EU's preferred solution was for Northern Ireland only to remain within the EU customs territory. Theresa May's government rejected that because it would create a customs barrier down the Irish Sea and would alienate her allies in the Democratic Unionist Party.\n\nJohnson might attempt to resurrect the Northern Ireland backstop knowing that the EU would agree to it quickly. He would lose DUP votes, but might hope to make them up elsewhere in the House of Commons.\n\nA long-shot certainly, but set against his other unappealing options, it might begin to look attractive.\n\nThis article is part of POLITICO\u2019s premium Brexit service for professionals: Brexit Pro.
