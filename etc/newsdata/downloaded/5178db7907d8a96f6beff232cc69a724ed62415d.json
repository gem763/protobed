Ted Cruz announced Thursday he plans to vote against Judge Halil Suleyman Ozerden, President Trump\u2019s judicial nominee for the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, Politico reported.\n\nThe Texas Republican had previously expressed concerns about the nominee\u2019s record, questioning whether he\u2019s a constitutionalist fit for the federal appeals court, which hears cases from Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi.\n\nMr. Cruz questioned Judge Ozerden\u2019s record during the nominee\u2019s confirmation hearing in July over a 2012 case involving Obamacare\u2019s contraceptive mandate where the judge ruled against the Catholic Diocese of Biloxi.\n\n\u201cFor a lifetime appointment on the court of appeals, I believe we should be looking for someone with a strong, demonstrated record as a constitutionalist,\u201d Mr. Cruz told Politico. \u201cI have significant concerns that Judge Ozerden\u2019s judicial record does not indicate that he meets that standard. For that reason, I do not believe he should be on the court of appeals, and I will oppose his nomination.\u201d\n\nJudge Ozerden\u2019s nomination, though, is backed by senators from his home state, who have praised his service to the country as a combat veteran in addition to his judicial service.\n\n\u201cHis judicial and academic achievements alone qualify him for this position, but his good character, experience as a navy fighter pilot and record of volunteerism and community involvement are also exemplary,\u201d Sen. Roger Wicker, Mississippi Republican, said at the confirmation hearing.\n\nJudge Ozerden, the son of Turkish immigrants, graduated from Stanford Law School and has been a federal district court judge for 12 years. According to multiple reports, he is a friend of White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney.\n\nThe Judiciary Committee has yet to schedule a vote on Judge Ozerden\u2019s nomination.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
