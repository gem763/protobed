Lo's fan base. The cast also included Constance Wu, Cardi B, Lizzo, and Lili Reinhart, who made it a can't-miss movie for their majority female fans as 67% of the opening weekend audience was female.\n\nRead more: Jennifer Lopez is getting major Oscar buzz for her performance in \"Hustlers\" and it's fully deserved\n\nThe movie as a whole also earned its fair share of buzz. The movie has an 88% critic score on Rotten Tomatoes (71% audience score), and the Oscar buzz for Lopez' performance as the ring leader of the group has grown since it had its world premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival last weekend.\n\nFor the five-year-old STXfilms it's a huge win. Since releasing the surprise box office hit \"The Upside\" in January, starring Kevin Hart and Bryan Cranston, the studio had forgettable releases like \"Poms\" and \"Uglydolls.\" The studio nabbed \"Hustlers\" when the movie's original distributor, Annapurna Pictures, dropped the title in 2018.\n\nRead more: The director of \"Hustlers\" describes the 3-year struggle to make her gritty gangster movie, and not let it turn into \"'Ocean's 8' with strippers\"\n\nHowever, things weren't all cheery at the multiplex this weekend. Warner Bros./Amazon Studios' adaptation of Donna Tartt's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel \"The Goldfinch\" starring Ansel Elgort and Nicole Kidman was a complete dud its opening weekend. The $45 million-budgeted movie only brought in $870,000 on Friday and has an estimated $2.6 million for the weekend (it played on 2,542 screens).\n\nThat's one of the worst openings by a film from a major studio this year.", "description": "'Hustlers' surpassed industry projections giving STXfilms a much-needed win, while Warner Bros,' but 'The Goldfinch' is a box office bust.", "authors": ["Jason Guerrasio"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7e51ef2e22af30ec3a78b3-960-480.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
