REUTERS/Carlos Garcia Rawlins/File Photo\n\nWashington this year imposed several rounds of sanctions on PDVSA in an attempt to oust socialist President Nicolas Maduro, whose 2018 re-election was dismissed by the opposition and most Western democracies as a sham.\n\nThe measures banned U.S. firms from buying PDVSA\u2019s oil, depriving Venezuela of its former top destination for exports, and scaring off other customers as U.S. officials also threatened foreign firms with punishment if they \u201cmaterially assist\u201d Maduro\u2019s administration.\n\nThe OPEC nation\u2019s crude inventories as a result have risen sharply since late August to more than 38 million barrels, highest since early 2018, according to data intelligence firm Kpler. Venezuela\u2019s crude storage capacity is about 65 million barrels, but some tanks are inactive due to lack of maintenance.\n\n\u201cStorage is almost at top capacity. We are just days ahead of being forced to shut production at some eastern oilfields,\u201d a PDVSA executive said.\n\nPDVSA\u2019s portfolio of clients has shrunk, with Russia\u2019s Rosneft now taking about two thirds of Venezuelan oil exports for reselling to Asia.\n\nThe sanctions have also reduced the number of tanker operators willing to load in Venezuela, and left PDVSA with minimum access to hard currency to pay contractors and service providers, which has affected output, according to sources and company documents detailing the state company\u2019s struggles.\n\nAs of August, Venezuela\u2019s crude production is down 60% from January to 979,400 barrels per day (bpd), according to unofficial PDVSA figures seen by Reuters. Venezuela\u2019s oil exports were 770,000 bpd last month and active rigs fell to 25, compared with 48 drilling units two years ago.\n\nBLENDING SITES\n\nThe Petropiar crude blending facility near the Jose terminal, operated by PDVSA and U.S.-based Chevron Corp, suspended operations last week. Production has not yet been halted at the project\u2019s associated oilfield in the Orinoco belt as of Sep. 17, according to one of the documents and sources.\n\nChevron referred questions on its joint projects in Venezuela to PDVSA. The state-run firm did not reply to a request for comment.\n\nThe extra-heavy oil extracted from the Orinoco belt needs to be mixed with lighter crudes to create exportable grades like Venezuela\u2019s flagship Merey heavy crude.\n\nWith Petropiar\u2019s blending operations halted, Merey production has been slowed. The neighboring Petrosinovensa project, operated by PDVSA and state-run China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC), reduced output by 20,000 bpd last week, according to the same PDVSA document.\n\n\u201cPetropiar is out of service due to high inventories of Merey. Petrosinovensa\u2019s plant one is in service, output adjusted to 72,000 bpd. Plant two is re-circulating crude,\u201d it said.\n\nOf the country\u2019s total stocks, 19.6 million barrels were at the country\u2019s largest oil port - the Jose terminal on its eastern coast - waiting for vessels and customers as of Sep. 17, according to Kpler.\n\nPDVSA recently switched its focus to Merey, helping it find new customers in Asia amid sanctions. But it has also caused a faster build-up of stocks in the country\u2019s east, especially since CNPC and its units stopped loading Venezuelan oil in August, according to the sources and data.\n\nWESTERN PRODUCTION DECLINES\n\nOff the country\u2019s western coast, a handful of vessels have been acting as floating storage for months, according to Refinitiv Eikon data.\n\n\u201cWe currently have three tankers full of crude waiting for vessels that would load through ship-to-ship operations. But the vessels have not arrived,\u201d said an inspector from one of PDVSA\u2019s western ports.\n\nProduction had already slowed in Venezuela\u2019s western fields, but the difficulty in finding vessels for exports added to inventories, forcing PDVSA and its joint ventures to further curtail or suspend output at oilfields including Tia Juana, Lagunillas, Bachaquero and Boscan, according to sources from those projects.", "description": "Venezuela's state-run oil company PDVSA has suspended some crude blending and cut back production as inventories have swelled due to U.S. sanctions scaring off buyers and shippers, according to internal documents, sources and data.", "authors": ["Marianna Parraga", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190918&t=2&i=1431103866&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8H0BW", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
