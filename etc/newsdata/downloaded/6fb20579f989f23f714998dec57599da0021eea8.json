Franchise stalwart Jose Altuve, who was once thought to be too small to play in the big leagues, delivered one of the biggest and most dramatic home runs in MLB postseason history \u2014 a walk-off two-run blast against Yankees\u2019 closer Aroldis Chapman.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThe Astros will go on to face the Washington Nationals in a World Series that figures to be dominated by pitching. Both teams will send out a trio of aces capable of shutting down any offense in MLB.\n\nIt\u2019s the first-ever World Series appearance for Washington. For Houston, it\u2019s a chance to win the franchise\u2019s second championship after winning the first in 2017. Needless to say, it will be a big moment for whichever city is fortunate enough to celebrate.\n\nBefore we get too far ahead of ourselves, we figured it\u2019s only fair to look back at how the Astros got this far. After all, we did the same for Washington last week.\n\nThere are countless reasons the Astros are back in the World Series. Here before you are arguably the five biggest.\n\nThey were on a mission from day one\n\nDespite losing to the Boston Red Sox in the ALCS last season, it felt like the American League pennant was the Astros' to lose in 2019.\n\nThey never lost it.\n\nThough they couldn't run away and hide from the resilient New York Yankees at any point during the season, they established quickly they would be the team to beat. The Astros wrapped up May with a 38-20 record and carried that success all the way to a league-best 107 victories.\n\nStory continues\n\nA more complete team you will not find in MLB. The Astros offense, pitching staff and defense all finished top three during the regular season. Though they\u2019ve appeared beatable at times in October, no foe has proven strong enough to eliminate them.\n\nThe dominance of Gerrit Cole is a big reason the Houston Astros are going to the World Series. (AP Photo/Frank Franklin II)\n\nGerrit Cole's dominance\n\nThe Astros rotation features two legitimate Cy Young award candidates in Gerrit Cole and Justin Verlander and three legitimate aces now that Zack Greinke has been added to the mix. It\u2019s Cole, though, who stands out now after dominating each of his three postseason outings.\n\nThe soon-to-be free agent has allowed one run over 22.2 innings in October. He struck out 25 total batters in two ALDS starts against the Tampa Bay Rays, before throwing seven shutout innings with seven strikeouts in ALCS Game 3 against the Yankees.\n\nIn the regular season, Cole struck out a franchise record 326 batters while posting a league-best 2.50 ERA.\n\nYou can back up the Brinks truck for the 29-year-old right-hander during the offseason. First though, he\u2019ll take aim at the Washington Nationals in Game 1 of the World Series.\n\nJose Altuve does it all\n\nThe smallest player is still the most important for Houston. Altuve, who won AL MVP in 2017 and has three batting championships to his credit, clinched their trip to the World Series with a walk-off home run against Aroldis Chapman in ALCS Game 6.\n\nThat\u2019s the moment that will be replayed over and over again for generations to come. But Altuve\u2019s contributions go much deeper. He\u2019s a table setter when need be. He\u2019s a run producer when need be. He can hit for average or power. He can man second base with the best of them.\n\nAs long as he\u2019s healthy, and right now he clearly is, Altuve is the man Houston wants in the middle of every important moment.\n\nTheir defense is incredible\n\nOn the rare occasion when Houston\u2019s pitching staff needs to be bailed out, the Astros\u2019 defense seems to always rise to the occasion. That was the case in ALCS Game 6. Josh Reddick, Michael Brantley, Jose Altuve and Carlos Correa each contributed a defensive gem down the stretch that made it possible for Houston to win.\n\nSTOP WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND WATCH MICHAEL BRANTLEY \ud83e\udd2f\n\n\n\n(via @MLB)pic.twitter.com/Qj84pdPNaQ \u2014 Yahoo Sports MLB (@MLByahoosports) October 20, 2019\n\nWith every out being so precious in a game where Houston relied entirely on its bullpen, the five outs those players combined to steal were definitely the difference.\n\nAs noted previously, Houston\u2019s defense ranked No. 2 in fielding percentage during the regular season. It wasn\u2019t just one game or one stretch where the defense did its job. It was all season long. But the Astros\u2019 defenders definitely did their best job when needed the most.\n\nYou can only contain Alex Bregman and the Houston Astros offense for so long. (Photo by Alex Trautwig/MLB Photos via Getty Images)\n\nThe lineup is deep and dangerous\n\nAs good as Jose Altuve is \u2014 and we\u2019ve established here that he\u2019s really good \u2014 he\u2019s never alone. Houston\u2019s lineup has impact players up and down the batting order.\n\nMany of those players have undeniably struggled during the postseason. Alex Bregman has homered only once in October after hitting a career-best 41 during the regular season. George Springer, Michael Brantley, Carlos Correa, Yuli Gurriel and rookie Yordan Alvarez have all been mostly silent as well, with the latter two going a combined 4 for 45 during the ALCS.\n\nBut each is also undeniably capable of carrying the team for an entire series. As daunting as the matchup with Washington might seem, it seems unlikely that an MVP candidate like Bregman, or a three-time All-Star like Springer, or the possible Rookie of the Year in Alvarez, will continue being near non-factors.\n\nHouston\u2019s lineup finished third in MLB in runs scored (920), third in home runs (288) and first in team batting average (.274). When it\u2019s clicking, the Astros lineup is nearly unstoppable. More times than not in 2019, it was clicking.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "A look at five big reasons the Houston Astros made the World Series.", "authors": ["Mark Townsend"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/87WZOGUeuCG_.QbDZjqqcg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/glIrBA5pa1ZsaDoN.viCPg--~B/aD0xNjczO3c9MjUwOTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/08fae280-eff0-11e9-adf7-fcf409c99c0b", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
