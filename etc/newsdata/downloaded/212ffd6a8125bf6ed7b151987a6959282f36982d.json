A city council member has introduced a measure that would have the city join San Francisco, the first major municipality to ban the sale of all electronic cigarettes. In L.A.'s case, vaping devices would stay off the market until the Food and Drug Administration deems them safe.\n\n\"The city of Los Angeles is not content to wait and do nothing as the numbers of illnesses and even deaths associated with unregulated vaping devices increases daily,\" reads the motion from Councilmember Paul Koretz.\n\nNot just youngsters: Army says 2 soldiers are being treated for vaping-related lung injuries\n\nKoretz cited U.S. statistics showing 1,080 cases of potential lung damage associated with vaping have required hospitalization as of last week, including 18 deaths. California has had about 100 cases, he said, including two deaths.\n\nWhy are they sick? A lab in Cincinnati is testing hundreds of vaping products, seeking links to lung disease\n\nIt all amounts to a \"public health crisis,\" he said.\n\nMassachusetts also has instituted a four-month ban on all vaping products.\n\nIn Washington state, the State Board of Health adopted Gov. Jay Inslee's call for an emergency ban of flavored vaping products. Several other states have also adopted or are considering temporary bans.\n\nThe L.A. legislation follows another motion introduced last month, aimed at a one-year ban on only marijuana-related products that can be vaped. The new proposal would prohibit the sale of all e-cigarettes.\n\nIn this 2018 file photo, a man exhales smoke from an electronic cigarette in Washington, D.C.

She spoke at what was billed as a White House \"listening session,\" where teenagers told her about their experiences using e-cigarettes.\n\nContributing: Associated Press\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Vape ban: Los Angeles to ban e-cigs?
