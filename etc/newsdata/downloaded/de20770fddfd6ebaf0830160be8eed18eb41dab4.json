The original video, captioned \"exposing Panera,\" gained both outrage and skepticism from social media users.\n\n\"I'm cool with it being prepared this way but then CHARGING ALMOST $7 FOR A SMALL BOWL?!?!?!? OK THEN,\" one Twitter user commented.\n\n\"Y'all thought a chef was back there making pasta from scratch and hand grating cheese???\" another user said.\n\nY'all thought a chef was back there making pasta from scratch and hand grating cheese??? pic.twitter.com/0JwXt8bdyZ\n\n\u2014 Stanley's Mustache (@EdiblesKickinIn) October 12, 2019\n\nBut regardless of the mixed reactions, the video has now allegedly had some real-world consequences.

A spokesperson for the chain said in a statement to the Washington Post that the mac 'n' cheese is \"made offsite with our proprietary recipe developed by our chefs.\"\n\n\"It is shipped frozen to our bakery cafes \u2014 this allows us to avoid using preservatives which do not meet our clean standards,\" the statement added.\n\nFor her part, the woman behind the video said she wouldn't be commenting any further on the situation.\n\n\"Can't say nothing else, they asked me not to and i gotta respect it,\" she tweeted Friday.\n\nStill, social media users were quick to share their thoughts on the scandal, adding jokes and more thoughts on how the dish is prepared.", "description": "A woman who posted a viral video \"exposing\"\u00a0how Panera Bread prepares its mac 'n' cheese says she's now been fired from the company.", "authors": ["Dillon Thompson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/actVmOqR5R0lDo2H.eEaVw--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMDI4O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims3/GLOB/crop/1028x674+128+0/resize/1028x675!/format/jpg/quality/85/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/ead796d0-eea6-11e9-b9ff-8565388b16b6", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
