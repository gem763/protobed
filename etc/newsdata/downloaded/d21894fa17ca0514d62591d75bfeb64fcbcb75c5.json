They haven't changed their position since.\n\nWhy would EU countries halt arms to Turkey for the conflict, but not to Saudi Arabia for the same reasons?\n\nThere are a number of reasons, but two in particular stand out: business and alliances.\n\nFrance, Germany, the United Kingdom, Spain and Italy are all among the world's top ten biggest exporters of arms, while Saudi Arabia is also the world's biggest importer of arms.\n\nTurkey, in comparison, is the 13th biggest importer of arms.\n\nBetween 2013-17, the largest arms supplier to the Saudis was by far the US (61%).\n\nBut this was also followed by the UK (23%), France (3.6%), Spain (2.4%), Switzerland (1.8%), Germany (1.8%) and Italy (1.5%) respectively, according to SIPRI data.\n\nSo have countries been more reluctant to sanction one of their biggest clients because of economic reasons? Not necessarily, he said.\n\n\"You could ask whether Turkey is less of an important market than Saudi Arabia, but this is not the case for Germany, at least, for which Turkey has been (an important client) for a long time,\" Wezeman said.\n\nMeanwhile, EU countries have long alliances with the Saudis, but not with the Houthis.\n\nMeanwhile, the West may be part of NATO alongside Turkey, but they also have alliances with the Kurds, who were a crucial partner in the fight to defeat Islamic State (IS).\n\nFor Wezeman, how countries choose their allegiance does not always seem logical, as in terms of its proximity and importance in NATO, one would think that EU countries would be less inclined to sanction Turkey than Saudi Arabia.\n\nBut the partnership with the Kurds will have definitely played a role in the EU countries' decision to halt arm exports to Turkey, according to the expert.\n\nWezeman said that the proximity with Turkey could have more of a direct impact on Europe.\n\n\"The fight against IS is particularly important for Europe whereas what happens in Yemen has no immediate impact, doesn't lead to refugees or potential terrorists coming to Europe.\"\n\nHe also highlighted that the role of morality and adherence to international humanitarian can also play a role in a country's decision to halt arm exports.\n\n\"In Germany, there is a significant arm industry and they were keen to get a substantial arm contract with Saudi Arabia. They had a very good chance of selling tanks and in the end, the German government took the decision not to take those steps.\"\n\nHowever, the expert noted that political perspectives on arm trade differ from country to country, taking the example of France or the UK where moral considerations play a smaller role than the business aspect unlike Germany, Sweden, or Norway where it's the other way around.\n\nREAD MORE:", "description": "European countries halted arm exports to Turkey but why haven't they done the same for Saudi Arabia?", "authors": ["Rachael Kennedy"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/23/48/58/1000x563_cmsv2_101b4010-1f13-5bb4-8a69-334e25584d64-4234858.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
