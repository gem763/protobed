In the past week, Saudi Arabia, which has ended up with lower output levels not only because of planned cuts but also because of the attack on the Abqaiq refinery, hinted that it is keen to see other members stick to their output quotas, wagging an accusatory finger at Iran and Nigeria.\n\nDuring the week ahead, look out for a response from Russia which is less than keen to rein in its output. The CEO of Russia\u2019s Rosneft (MCX: ), Igor Sechin, made it openly clear that he is opposed to cutting production and recently indicated that Saudi Arabia should mind its own business rather than put pressure on Russia to reduce output.\n\nIrrespective of the less-than-amicable comments, oil producers are facing stagnating demand and a build-up of reserves which may force OPEC into not only extending existing output restrictions but also adding new ones to meet slowing demand.\n\nAPI WEEKLY CRUDE STOCKS\n\nUS Petroleum Products Exports\n\noil production is now running at an all-time high of 12.4M b/d, which is partially catering to slightly higher domestic demand but is also being increasingly exported abroad. According to the EIA the gradual increase in U.S. exports will mean that the U.S. will become a net exporter of petroleum in the last quarter of this year.\n\nThe on Tuesday and on Wednesday will show if the domestic U.S. stock levels are continuing to build as they did in September and October or if increased exports and domestic demand are managing to balance out the U.S. oil market.\n\nExpectations for U.S. on Wednesday are for a slight slowdown from the 2% growth in the second quarter, which tallies with other economic indicators over the last few months. A slowdown in domestic growth will not be supportive of the oil market and may require a re-think on domestic production levels.\n\nCrude Oil Stocks & Days Of Supply", "description": "Commodities Analysis by Matthew Weller covering: Crude Oil WTI Futures, NK Rosneft PAO, BP PLC ADR.
