It\u2019s: Are we going to bring out what is better in us versus what is worse in us?\u201d\n\nHe constantly plies this theme, which deserves constant plying. For him it\u2019s clearly more than cant, and has roots in his stint in the military, which throws diverse Americans together, endowing them with a shared purpose.\n\nHe routinely steers clear of extremes \u2014 on health care, on guns, on environmental issues \u2014 not because he lacks conviction or courage, at least not from where I\u2019m sitting, but because extremes aren\u2019t where the most progress is usually made or where healing is likeliest to happen. He\u2019s a champion of the sensible. In that way, he seems much older than his age.\n\nBut, ugh, that age. My wish for a young candidate didn\u2019t mean a 37-year-old one. There\u2019s much wisdom in this life that\u2019s accrued only with the passage of years, and he\u2019d be better off \u2014 and significantly less vulnerable in a general election \u2014 if he had even five more of them.\n\nIn 2016, I visited and spent many hours with him in South Bend, then wrote a column with the headline \u201cThe First Gay President?\u201d I was looking at least a decade into the future, after he\u2019d extended his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 beyond South Bend, which has only about 100,000 people.\n\nI\u2019d be a lot more comfortable if there were an additional zero in that population figure, if he had a better record on race, and if there weren\u2019t quite so many elitist mile markers on his journey to this point.\n\nAnd that\u2019s where my depression sets in. He\u2019s so very strong but so crucially weak \u2014 which is the story of the Democratic primary, whose leading candidates are all agonizingly unsafe bets. Without a nanosecond\u2019s pause, I\u2019d vote for any of them over Trump. But will enough other Americans? The stakes are enormous and reassurance is elusive.", "description": "So talented yet so vulnerable \u2014 like all the leading contenders for the Democratic nomination.", "authors": ["Frank Bruni"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/08/opinion/08bruniWeb/08bruniWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
