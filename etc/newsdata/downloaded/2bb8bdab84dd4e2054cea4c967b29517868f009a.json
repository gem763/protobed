The unit forced four turnovers, two interceptions and two fumbles. They limited rookie Daniel Jones to 225 passing yards.\n\nBut far too often, the Redskins (0-4) couldn\u2019t get off the field \u2014 a common theme for a team that has the league\u2019s worst third-down defense.\n\nAnd in a new wrinkle: the Redskins defense committed four defensive penalties, each one costly.\n\nThe Giants went 8-of-13 on third down \u2014 good for 62%. That falls in line with the Redskins\u2019 average this season as they entered the afternoon giving up 63% of their third downs to opposing teams.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re simplifying as much as possible,\u201d Redskins safety Landon Collins said. \u201cWe\u2019re making those plays count. We just have to be one step closer in the plays that work for us. We have to continue pushing that play.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the Redskins\u2019 worst third down of the day was a play that actually wasn\u2019t a conversion at all.\n\nEarly in the first, Redskins coach Jay Gruden took a risk. Shortly after Case Keenum tossed an interception to give the Giants a short field, the Redskins had made a stop, which would have set up a 46-yard field goal attempt for New York. But on the play, New York drew a holding call \u2014 which Gruden accepted.\n\nThe coach\u2019s thinking was understandable. The Giants had been pushed back to third-and-17, and out of field goal range. All Washington had to do was make another stop on third down, and New York would have to punt.\n\nInstead, the Redskins gave up 15 yards.\n\nAnd the Giants then converted on fourth-and-2, keeping the eventual touchdown drive alive.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think we\u2019d struggle on that,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cI think that\u2019s probably about a six percent chance in the league of converting (third-and-17).\u201d\n\nThe Redskins\u2019 next defensive series wasn\u2019t much better. Backed up at their own 6-yard line, the Giants took 13 plays to march 94 yards down the field for a 1-yard rushing touchdown from Wayne Gallman.\n\nAlong the way, the Redskins committed three penalties. On the first, Daron Payne and Jon Bostic saw their sack negated when Fabian Moreau was called for defensive holding. Later in the drive, cornerback Josh Norman was called for a facemask penalty on a 22-yard run from Gallman \u2014 though that play probably helped prevent a touchdown.\n\nTwo plays later, safety Montae Nicholson was whistled for defensive holding in the end zone, giving New York a fresh set of downs.\n\n\u201cVery frustrating,\u201d said Quinton Dunbar, who had both of Washington\u2019s interceptions. \u201cYou can\u2019t win any games with the penalties we\u2019re having. We have to be more disciplined and not get those penalties.\u201d\n\nFor the second straight week, the Redskins went without giving up a touchdown after halftime. But they routinely have failed to get off to a strong start. This week, they faced a two-touchdown deficit by the second quarter and went into halftime trailing 17-3.\n\nThe unit showed some improvement, but it wasn\u2019t drastic enough to prevent the loss.\n\n\u201cWe just have to settle down in the first half,\u201d Collins said. \u201cIf we do what we do in the second half, I think we can hold teams to three points or seven points within the game. \u2026 We\u2019ll be on point if we keep doing it.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
