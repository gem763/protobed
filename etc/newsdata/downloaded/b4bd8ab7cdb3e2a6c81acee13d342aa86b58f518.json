LOUIS (AP) - The Contemporary Art Museum St. Louis is kicking off a $12 million fundraising campaign and says it already has raised more than two-thirds of the amount.\n\nThe St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports that the goal of the campaign is to increase the museum\u2019s endowment, provide educational programming and make improvements to its 15-year-old building.\n\nThe museum already has raised more than $9.7 million toward what was initially a $10 million goal to boost its endowment. That includes a $5 million gift from Emily Rauh Pulitzer, who established the Pulitzer Arts Foundation next door.\n\nThe museum does not collect art but brings in rotating exhibitions. Since it stopped charging admission in 2013, its attendance increased by about 85%.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: St. Louis Post-Dispatch, http://www.stltoday.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Contemporary Art Museum St. Louis is kicking off a $12 million fundraising campaign and says it already has raised more than two-thirds of the amount.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
