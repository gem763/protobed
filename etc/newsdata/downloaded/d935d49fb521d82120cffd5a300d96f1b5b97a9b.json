Other protesters were also shoved out of the way.\n\n'Heavy-handed' officers have been slammed after social media footage (pictured left and right) showed one officer repeatedly hitting protesters with a baton\n\nSome social media users expressed their outrage over the eight-second clip shared on Twitter, with one labelling the actions of police as 'unnecessary heavy handedness'.\n\nAnother person wrote: 'The woman literally puts her hands up in submission and then gets smacked by an overly aggressive police officer with small man syndrome.'\n\nAnother said there was 'not much evidence' to justify use of the baton.\n\nOthers questioned whether the short clip showed the entire story.\n\nOthers questioned whether the short clip showed the entire story. One even heaped blame on the protesters\n\nOne social media user said: 'Only saw one cop with a baton...

'There is a misconception that as an industry mining does not operate with sustainable principles in mind,' they said in a statement. Mining is vital for the production of electricity, solar panels, electric car batteries, pacemakers and medical apparatus and public transport, they said. This year the conference will consider the importance of battery minerals, used in the emerging electric car market, and the growing importance of ethical investment for resource companies.\n\nThe activists picketed at multiple entrances to the centre, chanting 'land rights not mining rights, shut IMARC down' and 'blood on your hands' as they pushed back against a police line.\n\nA Victoria Police spokesman said: 'Police have arrested in excess of 20 protesters outside the Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre.\n\n'The protesters were blocking the disabled and wheelchair access into the building and were asked to move but refused.
