Letters to the Editor. The Burning of Moore Hall. All Was Hopeless. To the Editor of the Morning Post. Sir, - So many trite and colourless descriptions have appeared in the newspapers of Irish bonfires that it occurs to me you might like to publish the few lines which I quote telling of the burning of Moore Hall on the first of this month: I was sitting in my lodge reading when armed men who were perfect strangers to me came to the door and demanded the keys. I asked what for, and was told that a column was going to be put up there for the night. I wanted to go over, but would not be allowed; other armed men were patrolling the road from Annie's Bridge to Murphy's Lodge. I had no option but to give up the keys, and suspecting what was on I pointed out to the leader that the house was not Colonel Moore's property. This had no effect. I sat up all night, hoping that when all would be clear I could save even a portion of the library. At four o'clock I heard four loud explosions. At five I went to the place and found the whole house was seething in a mass of flames. I at once saw that all was hopeless. A fire brigade would be powerless, so firmly had the flames gripped the entire building. I could do nothing but stand by and await the end with the same feelings that one has when standing by the open grave of a very dear friend. I do not say this in the 'Uriah Heepish' way, for I really loved that old house. To me it was a modern edition of King Tutankhamen's tomb. At six o'clock the roof fell in with a terrific crash. When the fire died down I got ladders up to the library windows, hoping to save a few books, but nothing living could enter, so fierce was the heat. When Mr Ruttledge returns I would like to have instructions as to what is to be done. There is several feet of litter on the ground floor. I don't know if it be worth while to remove this - except steel or iron one cannot hope to find anything. In one sense, perhaps, the house had outlived its usefulness, but still it would be a pity even now to let it become a real ruin. If nothing can be done I would suggest building up the lower windows to prevent people trafficking in and out as they please. These lines will seem to many too simple to be considered as 'literature'; the many like ornament. But the simple directness of the lines appeals to me; I doubt if the story of the burning could have been better told; and if they recall to others, as they did to me, Virgil's celebrated words, sunt lacrimae rerum, they will justify their publication. - Yours, &c., George Moore 121, Ebury Street, London S.W. 1, Feb. 13", "description": "Moore Hall in County Mayo was built between 1792 and 1795 and was a bustling family home until it was destroyed by the Irish Republican Army (IRA) during the civil war in 1923.", "authors": ["Ross Ibbetson For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/15/19694858-0-image-a-77_1571062196823.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
