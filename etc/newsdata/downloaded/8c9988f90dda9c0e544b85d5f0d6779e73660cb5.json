It's a high-energy laser system mounted on a small all-terrain vehicle, to be specific, which uses electro-optical/infrared sensors to detect and track drones. After it identifies and tracks the unwelcome flying device, it then neutralizes it with its laser in a process that takes a few seconds.\n\nRaytheon says the system can draw power from a standard 220-volt outlet and can deliver dozens -- it didn't mention an exact number -- of laser shots on a single charge. However, it can also be paired with a generator if it needs to be on the field for an extended period.\n\nThe Air Force received the anti-drone system earlier this month and will deploy it overseas for a year-long experiment. It will train operators on how to use the system while testing how effective it is in real-world conditions. We're guessing the laser-equipped buggy would be used to prevent enemy drones from collecting information on military bases or to shoot down weapon-equipped unmanned aerial systems.\n\nRaytheon president Roy Azevedo said:\n\n\"Five years ago, few people worried about the drone threat. Now, we hear about attacks or incursions all the time. Our customers saw this coming and asked us to develop a ready-now counter-UAS capability. We did just that by going from the drawing board to delivery in less than 24 months.\"\n\nCheck out how the company's anti-drone system works below:", "description": "Raytheon has delivered the first anti-drone buggy to the US Air Force, just over year after it introduced the technology.
