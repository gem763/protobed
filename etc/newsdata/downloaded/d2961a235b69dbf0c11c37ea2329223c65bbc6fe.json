Australia and Turkey co-operate closely on Anzac Day commemorations at Gallipoli, however, and diplomatically are part of a middle-power group known as MIKTA alongside Mexico, Indonesia and South Korea.\n\nIn the Coalition party room on Tuesday, NSW backbencher Julian Leeser said the Kurds represented the values Western nations had fought for in the Middle East and urged Mr Morrison to work with allies to keep up the pressure on Mr Erdogan, in a contribution that was well received by colleagues.\n\n'Lawlessness' fears\n\nWhile the government has insisted it is too dangerous to repatriate Australians being detained in Syria, Mr Dabboussy said action could still be taken to bring the 66 women and children to safety but \"that is a situation of days rather than weeks\".\n\nMr Dabboussy warned there would be a period of \"lawlessness\" as the Syrian forces assumed control of the camp, adding to the threat of death from diseases and a lack of food and water the Australians already faced.\n\n\"In that environment you will have ISIS sleeper cells, you will have radicalised women in the camp and they in turn may take action,\" Mr Dabboussy said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The Australian women have all been deemed as apostates or non-radicalised women, they don't believe in the ISIS ideology and the ISIS ideology allows them to be killed as a result.\n\n\"They are open and vulnerable at this point in time. The only avenue for their survival is the Australian government and sooner or later there will be death in the camp.\"\n\nSave the Children Australia acting chief Mat Tinkler said the aid agency had withdrawn its international staff from the region because of the deteriorating security situation but rejected the government's claim it had been too risky to send Australian officials in to assist the women and children.\n\n\"Our advice is Kurdish administration and officials will facilitate the transfer of Australian nationals to the border with Iraq, where they can be repatriated by the Australian government,\" Mr Tinkler said.\n\nWhile many of the women had married Islamic State fighters, Mr Dabboussy rejected Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton's insistence they posed a security risk. He said they had been groomed, tricked or coerced into going to Syria, or had been naive. None of them had been combatants.\n\nMr Dabboussy urged people to think of the innocent children, with the majority of the 46 aged under five.\n\nMr Dabboussy said his daughter, who is living in the camp with her three children, had been taken at gunpoint across the Lebanon-Syria border.", "description": "As the government weighs sanctions against Turkey, family members are pleading with Canberra to repatriate Australian women and children caught in the firing line.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2082%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_169/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/f63c87c9a87253cfde6ad963a3f2e934a54b61c8", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
