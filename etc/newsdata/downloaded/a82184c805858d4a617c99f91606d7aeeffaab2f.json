Lizzo, the rapper-songwriter-flutist who loves you more than you love yourself, just earned her very first Billboard No. 1 song with \u201cTruth Hurts.\u201d She arrives at her throne just two weeks after Billie Eilish usurped the spot from 19-week legend Lil Nas X. Guess she\u2019s the bad guy now! \u201cTruth Hurts\u201d and its infectious piano-driven beat first arrived in 2017, and after it was featured in the Netflix movie Someone Great, it was added to the deluxe version of Lizzo\u2019s debut album, Cuz I Love You. Since then, it has only grown more popular. Pulling a Lil Nas X herself, Lizzo invited rapper DaBaby for a \u201cTruth Hurts\u201d remix. Under Billboard\u2019s remix rules, all versions of a song can count toward the original\u2019s chart movement, so the song definitely got a boost from anyone curious to hear what DaBaby has to say on track about being a bad bitch. This makes Lizzo the sixth female rapper ever to have a No. 1 on the Hot 100 chart: Lauryn Hill, Lil\u2019 Kim, Cardi B, Shawnna, and Iggy Azalea came before her. The 31-year-old artist celebrated her success on Twitter and dedicated it to anyone who has ever felt like less than the royalty they are.\n\nWE\u2019RE NUMBER 1. THIS IS A W FOR ALL OF US. ANYBODY WHO EVER FELT LIKE THEY VOICE WASN\u2019T HEARD. ANYBODY WHO FELT LIKE THEY WEREN\u2019T GOOD ENOUGH. YOU ARE. WE ARE. CHAMPIONS. I LOVE YALL 3 MUCH.

Truly, nothing can stop her now.", "description": "Lizzo becomes the sixth female rapper ever to earn a Billboard No. 1.
