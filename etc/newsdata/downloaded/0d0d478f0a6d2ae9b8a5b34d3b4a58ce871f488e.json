Subscribe now to see what\u2019s happening in right-wing media from the safety of your inbox.\n\nFormer White House adviser Sebastian Gorka is no stranger to conspiracy theories. In January, for example, he suggested that Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was secretly dead.\n\nNormally, that would align him with believers in QAnon, the wacko movement that posits that the Democratic Party is run by pedophiles and also think Ginsburg is dead. But now the top figures in QAnon are coming for Gorka.\n\nGorka has clashed with QAnon believers in the past. As a former White House insider, they expect him to validate that their theory is real. Instead, he frequently tweets that \u201cQ is garbage.\u201d\n\nBut the feud really stepped up this week. \u201cQ,\u201d the mysterious person or group of people who drop the \u201cclues\u201d that set QAnon believers off, posted a series of links about a super PAC Gorka once worked for. Then Q linked to the FBI tip line, with the implication that Gorka had committed all sorts of crimes.\n\nOf course, QAnon readers thought, this explains it: Gorka only says QAnon is fake because he\u2019s in on the plot. In the usual QAnon style, nothing was actually proven, but believers filled in the rest and started posting menacing tweets towards Gorka.\n\nPatriot\u2019s Soapbox, a 24-hour QAnon livestream on YouTube that\u2019s central to the conspiracy theory\u2019s origin story, posted Gorka\u2019s address and his wife\u2019s name. QAnon followers on Twitter starting posting pictures of his house.\n\nGiven that QAnon followers have been tied to two recent murders, the attacks on Gorka have the potential to become more than casual doxxing on the internet. Then a major figure in QAnon world took it further.\n\nDave Hayes , a religious \u201chealer\u201d and QAnon personality who goes by the handle \u201cPraying Medic,\u201d went on Trump superfan Bill Mitchell \u2019s show this week to threaten Gorka more directly. Hayes has become a powerful figure in QAnon-world by blending evangelical Christianity with an obsession with Q\u2019s mythos.\n\n\u201cYou may want to be careful with what you say and what you do,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cQ put somebody on the radar yesterday, and you probably don\u2019t want 10,000 anons from 8chan digging through your personal life.\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d Mitchell said.\n\nHayes added that \u201cthe hunter is now the hunted.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe people that have been writing hit pieces about us, criticizing us, calling us fools, those people are about to have their corruption exposed,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I\u2019m just letting people know, I think you\u2019re going to see a bit more of an aggressive stance on the side of people who have been taking this crap for a long time, they\u2019re not going to take it anymore.\u201d\n\nGorka didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.", "description": "Q fans once loved Gorka, now they think he\u2019s part of the deep state", "authors": ["Will Sommer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1553716439/190327-Sommer-Sebastian-Gorka-tease_pnjmuw", "published_at": "2019-03-27"}
