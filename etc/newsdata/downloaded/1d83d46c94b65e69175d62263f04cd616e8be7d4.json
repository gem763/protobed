He cant buts let's look at some comments.\n\nThe Remainers are huffing and puffing this morning, but it will be to no avail. Johnston's strategy is nearly foolproof.\n\nMy Reply: So What?\n\nMy Reply: Excellent News\n\nJohnson will appoint a whip who will obey his wishes. Should the Commons pull any legislative tricks that require the House of Lords, expect a filibuster.\n\nMy Reply: Not Legally Binding\n\nA petition calling on the government not to prorogue parliament has already been signed by more than 1.4 million people. The petition is growing even faster than the petition to revoke article 50, which eventually had 6m signatures.\n\nMy Reply: Not Legally Binding\n\nAccusations\n\nJacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, has claimed the Speaker, John Bercow, was being unconstitutional by criticising the suspension of parliament. Bercow described Johnson\u2019s move to prorogue parliament as a \u201cconstitutional outrage\u201d. But Rees-Mogg claimed it was Bercow who was acting outside the constitution by making such comments.\n\nRees-Mogg is correct. There is nothing unconstitutional about the move. Proroguing is frequent. Only the timing is unusual.\n\n\u201cIt was simply wrong and deeply irresponsible of him [Bercow] to say that. The Queen had no discretion over this. There is no precedent for the Queen refusing a request by her prime minister under these circumstances. This is a straightforward decision by the prime minister giving formal advice to the sovereign, which a constitutional monarch is obliged to follow. Lord O\u2019Donnell is saying things that are damaging to the constitution and wrong.\u201d\n\nRees-Moog commented: \u201cThe law of the land is that we leave the European Union, and parliament voted for that on the back of a referendum where 17.4 million people voted to leave. That\u2019s not railroading. That\u2019s delivering a proper constitutional settlement.\u201d\n\nCoup\n\nCall to Hang Johnson\n\nThe Shadow (opposition) Chancellor, John McDonnell, labeled Johnson a \u201cdictator\u201d.\n\nAcceptance\n\nThe cavalier behaviour of the wreckers who now control of the Conservative Party makes several political and constitutional reforms much more likely: proportional representation, a written constitution and separation of powers between the executive and Parliament 1/\n\nPM @BorisJohnson has said that the UK will leave the EU on 31 Oct. In all circumstances, the EU will continue to protect the interests of its citizens and companies, as well as the conditions for peace and stability on the island of Ireland. It is our duty & our responsibility.\n\nBoth Tweets sounds like acceptance.\n\nPolls\n\nNEW POLL: @YouGov for @thetimes Tories on 34%, highest since before March 29 Failure to leave the EU triggered collapse in Con support and the rise of Brexit Party, which is now back down to 13% https://t.co/pFQjrtrrRe pic.twitter.com/hMYqEgniAT\n\nCommon Sense from Eurointelligence\n\nBoris Johnson and Dominic Cummings have a strategy - and nobody else does. The prorogation plan is devious - or clever depending on your views. It tells us that this government will stop at nothing to frustrate the Remainers in the parliament, so long as it is legal.\n\nThe decision to prorogue parliament in the way they did dramatically reduces the options for the Remain supporters. There is now no time for legislation to force the government to extend Brexit. There is a little more than a week after the parliament convenes next week, and there will be a couple of weeks after the Queen\u2019s Speech October 14.\n\nCan this be stopped legally? Not really. It is not the prime minister who has prorogued the parliament. It was the Queen, who has her own legal counsel.\n\nPerhaps the most interesting news story yesterday - amid a torrent of noisy outrage - was a story in Die Welt according to which Germany and the EU - for the first time - now actually believe that a no-deal Brexit is possible. We have been pointing out for the last three years that Germans in particular did not believe that Brexit would happen. The German media have been obsessed with the second referendum campaign and reported on little else. It also has been the overwhelming experience of the EU that the other side always blinks first. What yesterday\u2019s decision did was to make it absolutely clear to the EU that the UK parliament won\u2019t stop a no-deal Brexit.\n\nThere is no way the House of Commons and the Lords will finalize an anti-Brexit law before parliament breaks up. They would have to re-table the legislation in mid-October. But at that time Johnson and EU leaders would be in last-minute negotiations. If the talks succeed, parliament will get a last-minute take-it-or-leave-it vote.\n\nThere is still one option left for Remainers to pursue, but it is very risky. They could hold a vote of no confidence when they come back next week. If they win, the fixed-term parliaments act sets out a definitive procedure. The House of Commons has two weeks to secure a majority in support of another prime minister - a technical government as the Italians would call it. But this is unlikely as the opposition is hopelessly divided on this point. If that effort fails, the Commons would be suspended for new elections. But, crucially, it is the government that sets the date for them. Number Ten said yesterday that the date for elections would be November 1-5, that is after a no-deal Brexit. In other words, a no-confidence motion could actually trigger a no-deal Brexit, as the Commons would have deprived themselves of the opportunity to ratify a withdrawal agreement.\n\nThis is why the timing of the prorogation is so clever - no doubt the work of Cummings.\n\nThe political reality is that the anti-Brexit campaign has committed one strategic blunder after another, and failed to attract enough support. They lost two general elections, one European election and one referendum. The ferocity of their reaction is best explained as a sudden realisation that they lost. They did not see this coming.", "description": "The Remainers are huffing and puffing this morning, but it .09/02/2019 3:15:41AM EST.", "authors": ["Mike Shedlock", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/273/008554d2-471e-4acc-b23d-0641a0c7b067.jpg"}
