This represents 15 per cent of transaction account holders, 10 per cent of credit cards and 5 per cent of mortgages.\n\nABA chief Anna Bligh said the Deloitte numbers show \u201ccompetition for a customer\u2019s business is fiercer than it has ever been\u201d.\n\nPredatory risks\n\nLauren Solomon, CEO of the Consumer Policy Research Centre, told the Future Banking Forum that while open banking will help customers compare offers, there are concerns it will see data analytics used to discriminate against customers.\n\n\u201cThere is likely to be increased profiling of consumers and growing inequality of offers in markets \u2026 and predatory lending practices that could emerge,\u201d she told the same event.\n\nMr Bordignon said the ACCC, which will release its enforcement approach to open banking in the coming weeks, is monitoring the risk of predatory lending.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe are alive to potential for this to be misused and for bad outcomes for consumers,\" he said. \"That\u2019s partly why its been given to the consumer protection regulator.\n\n\"We will be monitoring that and paying attention to that, and if we see those practices emerging, that is something we would be very interested in.\u201d\n\nBanks have also been put on notice that community groups, and the regulators, are monitoring the transparency of decisions based on data and the use of banking data by other industries.\n\n\u201cThere will be use cases where data is blended across sectors, which means people without expertise in a sector will use data from that sector to potentially infer information about people, and make decisions potentially without their knowledge,\" Ms Solomon said.\n\n\"This takes us into the realm of greater transparency of scoring mechanisms, which is a discussion happening internationally.\n\n\u201cOver the coming years, it is going to be increasingly challenging if we don\u2019t have some sort of accountability mechanism in place, where consumers are told what data has been used to make a decision about them, have an ability to correct the record if it is wrong, or to challenge a decision.\u201d\n\nThe Consumer Policy Research Centre also sees the CDR, which is voluntary, as one part of the development of a broader consumer protection framework that needs to introduce \"more fundamental rights and protections across the economy\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Office of the Australian Information Commission is preparing to release draft privacy rules to accompany the CDR this month, and wants to finalise these by the end of the year.\n\nThe ACCC is preparing to open draft applications for accreditation to receive data this month, after admitting nine fintechs into a testing environment to begin this month.\n\nThe Consumer Policy Research Centre, CHOICE and the Consumer Action Law Centre have pushed for more consumer involvement in testing of the system to ensure it is designed around their needs.\n\n\u201cWe are at the start of a very long journey here,\u201d Ms Solomon said.", "description": "Treasury and the ACCC are building a communication plan to boost awareness of open banking to help customers compare products and services.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.523%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_444%2C$y_56/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/707b19ffb36a6501aee8505b92aef7087eea87d0", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
