(Twitter)\n\nJarrid Wilson, a California church leader, author and mental health advocate, died by suicide Monday evening at age 30.\n\nWilson, known as a passionate preacher, most recently was an associate pastor at megachurch Harvest Christian Fellowship in Riverside, Calif. A co-founder of the mental health nonprofit Anthem of Hope, Wilson was open about his depression, often posting on his social media accounts about his battles with the mental illness.\n\n\u201cAt a time like this, there are just no words,\u201d Harvest Administrative Pastor Paul Eaton said in a statement.\n\n\u201cSometimes people may think that as pastors or spiritual leaders we are somehow above the pain and struggles of everyday people,\u201d Eaton said. \u201cWe are the ones who are supposed to have all the answers. But we do not.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, pastors are just people who need to reach out to God for His help and strength, each and every day,\u201d he added.\n\nNews of Wilson\u2019s death followed tweets the young pastor posted throughout the day Monday that dealt with suicide, including a post saying that even though loving Jesus doesn\u2019t cure illnesses such as depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, Jesus does offer companionship and comfort.\n\nWilson also posted on the same day that he was officiating a funeral for a woman who had died by suicide. Kay Warren \u2014 who along with her husband, Saddleback Church pastor Rick Warren, lost their son to suicide in 2013 \u2014 responded to Wilson\u2019s tweet with encouragement. \u201cPraying, Jarrid. Her devastated family needs so much tenderness and compassion right now. Grateful for your willingness to be the arms of Jesus to them,\u201d Warren wrote.\n\nThe news Tuesday of Wilson\u2019s death comes on World Suicide Prevention Day and follows a number of high-profile suicides among pastors and people in the mental health community, including 30-year-old Andrew Stoecklein, a pastor in Chino, Calif., who often preached about mental illness.\n\nWilson shared his mental health challenges in his most recent book, \u201cLove Is Oxygen: How God Can Give You Life and Change Your World,\u201d and blog posts. He blogged earlier this summer that he had dealt with \u201csevere depression throughout most of my life and contemplated suicide on multiple occasions.\u201d\n\nOn social media, he regularly encouraged others dealing with similar challenges, with messages such as: \u201cI\u2019m a Christian who also struggles with depression. This exists, and it\u2019s okay to admit it.\u201d\n\nEaton said Wilson wanted to especially help those who were dealing with suicidal thoughts.\n\n\u201cTragically, Jarrid took his own life,\u201d Eaton said.\n\n\u201cOver the years, I have found that people speak out about what they struggle with the most,\u201d he added.\n\nBreaking down the stigma of mental illness is one of the goals of Anthem of Hope, the nonprofit the pastor founded with his wife, Juli, in 2016. Anthem of Hope creates resources for the church to assist those dealing with depression, anxiety, self-harm, addiction and suicide.\n\nIn his summer blog post, Wilson challenged the idea that those who die by suicide are condemned to hell.\n\nChristians wouldn\u2019t tell someone with a physical illness such as cancer that they are going to hell because of their diagnosis, he noted. Neither should they assume it of people with mental illnesses, which can \u201clead many people to do things they wouldn\u2019t otherwise do if they didn\u2019t struggle.\u201d\n\n\u201cThose who say suicide automatically leads to hell obviously don\u2019t understand the totality of mental health issues in today\u2019s world, let alone understand the basic theology behind compassion and God\u2019s all-consuming grace,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe must do better at educating people on things they have a hard time wrapping their heads around,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd mental health is definitely [a] topic Christians around the world must yearn to better understand.\u201d\n\nJustin Herman said he knew Wilson from working as a pastor in Riverside. They would cross paths and talk about mental health and abortion.\n\n\u201cI know the guy loved Jesus and I know that he loved what he was doing, loved his family,\u201d Herman said.\n\nTo Herman, Wilson was \u201cnot just going with the program of life.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was counter to culture and shaped culture in a lot of ways,\u201d Herman said.\n\nIn addition to his wife, Wilson is survived by two sons, Finch and Denham; and his mother, father and siblings.", "description": "The news of Wilson\u2019s death comes on Suicide Awareness Day.", "authors": ["Roxanne Stone", "Emily Mcfarlan Miller", "Alejandra Molina", "Religion News Service", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ewh7yes2LaX3e3UTT7hEoiv6sL0=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TP7IF3QT6NGZLH6AP2B3TUOA6Q.JPG", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
