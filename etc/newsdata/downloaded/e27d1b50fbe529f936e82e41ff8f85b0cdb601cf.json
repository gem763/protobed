The patients may be scared. This is not good practice,\" he said. \"The protesters have injuries. This searching must be done after they are healed.\"\n\nHe said he worked as a first aider at protest sites in his spare time.\n\n\"I didn't tell any of my supervisors - only some colleagues with the same values,\" he said. \"But when I see people injured, I have to provide first aid.\"\n\nPolice have denied accusations of brutality, saying they have shown utmost restraint in life-threatening situations and issued warnings to protesters with colour-coded signs before they respond with tear gas or baton charges.\n\nBan on police information\n\nSeparately, a court in Hong Kong has banned people from disclosing personal information about police officers and their families, including names and photos.\n\nHong Kong's High Court issued the injunction on Friday, after the police force sought its intervention to halt \"doxxing\" - the publication of private information online - by pro-democracy protesters.\n\nThe police and justice secretary also sought a ban on publishing details about a police officer's Facebook and Instagram IDs, their car number plates and any photograph of an officer or their family without consent.\n\nThe court agreed to a temporary order, which will last for 14 days pending a longer legal hearing.\n\nThe current wording leaves no exceptions, including for media, making it unclear how it will be applied and whether it will restrict work by reporters.\n\nIn Hong Kong, protesters are angry about what they see as creeping Chinese interference in Hong Kong, a former British colony that returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under a \"one country, two systems\" formula intended to guarantee freedoms that are not enjoyed on the mainland.\n\nChina denies meddling. It has accused foreign governments, including the United States and United Kingdom, of inciting the unrest.", "description": "Medical professionals gave speeches to a peaceful crowd condemning alleged excessive force used by police.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/26/8dce19f78dcd47f3b7e953be99b6f350_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
