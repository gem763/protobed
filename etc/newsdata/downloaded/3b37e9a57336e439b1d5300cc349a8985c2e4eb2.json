That brings together members across the House.\u2019\n\nMr Johnson went on to say: \u2018Not only has this House been considering this issue for three-and-a-half years, but last week when this Bill was being debated there was not a single new idea, there was not a single new suggestion, and all they wanted was more time, more weeks, more months, when they couldn\u2019t even provide the speakers to fill the time allotted.\u2019\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nThe prime minister accused Mr Corbyn of wanting delay over certainty (Picture: PA)\n\nThe prime minister went on to claim that Labour are not interested in delivering Brexit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said: \u2018All they want to do is procrastinate.\n\n\u2018They don\u2019t want to deliver Brexit on October 31, on November 31, even on January 31.\u2019\n\n\u2018They just want to spin it out forever, until the 12th of never. And when the 12th of never eventually comes around, they\u2019ll devise one of their complicated Parliamentary procedures and move a motion for a further delay and a further extension then.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
