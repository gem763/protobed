Pete Buttigieg\u2019s supporters LIGHT AOC up after she rails on him over Elizabeth Warren and Beto", "language": "en", "text": "One of the best parts of watching the Democratic primaries is how quickly they all start to turn on one another. It\u2019s all fun and games when they\u2019re in agreement that ORANGE MAN BAD, but once it gets real and they figure out they have to run against each other it turn ugly fast.\n\nAnd it\u2019s glorious.\n\nApparently, Pete Buttigieg was honest about the amount of money it would take ANY Democrat to even compete with Trump, let alone beat him, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez got so cranky with him.\n\nSmall-dollar grassroots campaigns, aka what Buttegieg insults here as \u201cpocket change,\u201d out-fundraise him by millions. Our nation\u2019s leaders should be working to end the era of big money politics, not protect it. & Beto\u2019s gun policy isn\u2019t \u201cpicking a fight,\u201d it\u2019s taking a stand. https://t.co/a6k7rgXHiD \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) October 14, 2019\n\nQuit picking on Beto and Liz!\n\nHa.\n\nThis is strangely out of character for you. These comments are critiques of quotes taken out of context, but also aren't as coherent as usual. Every candidate can be picked apart in this way so I'm curious what prompted your criticism here. \u2014 PoliPhinosaur (@phinosaur) October 15, 2019\n\nThese comments are absolutely in character for her.\n\n\"\"& Beto\u2019s gun policy isn\u2019t \u201cpicking a fight,\u201d it\u2019s taking a stand.\"\" \u2013 If Bobby (not Beto) O'Rourke advocating to take away my property isn't \"picking a fight\", what is \"picking a fight?\" \u2014 Dan Wholihan (@DWholihan) October 15, 2019\n\nWait\u2026\"Warren's small donor fundraising\"?@AOC, please don't let this be signaling. Please tell me that you're going to endorse the only real leftie in the race. I truly hope that the waiting is a strategy and that you'll #EndorseBernie \u2014 Wib Jest \ud83c\udf39 (@WibJest) October 15, 2019\n\nBernie?\n\nHilarious.\n\nI admire you but feel this is low for you. Pete does not sell and has never sold his soul to the highest bidder and no one understands weapons of war more than a veteran. Please stop attacking the one guy that can possibly unite America and make kindness the standard. \u2014 princess_Babs (@princessBabs3) October 15, 2019\n\nShe especially ticked off the Buttigieg crew.\n\nDid u know that @PeteButtigieg has implicitly defended u & Rep. Omar from Trump\u2019s attacks on where you\u2019re from? The least you could have done before inserting yourself in this was to watch the video. Reporters twist things sometimes to get more clicks on T. You should know this. \u2014 New New Yorker for Pete \ud83d\udc7b\ud83d\udd2a\ud83d\udd2a (@NYC_Loving_Girl) October 15, 2019\n\nMayor Pete has a grassroots campaign of passionate followers. Furthermore, he is level headed and knows the challenges with gun control and taking baby steps to enact lasting change. He\u2019s smart and strategic. \u2014 princess_Babs (@princessBabs3) October 15, 2019\n\nI disagree with you on this matter. I\u2019m small donor @PeteForAmerica @PeteButtigieg Read what he said not what you think he said. \u2014 Gram_chris (@Gramchris2) October 15, 2019\n\nI guess you didn't watch the FULL video, eh? Easy to take the clickbait. \u2014 citybythelake (@citybythelake) October 14, 2019\n\nI implore you to read the full quote. \u2014 Maryland for Pete \ud83e\udd80 (@MDforPete2020) October 15, 2019\n\nThis went well, AOC.
