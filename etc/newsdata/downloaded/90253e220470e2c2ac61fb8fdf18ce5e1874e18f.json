They said the dancing was great. It was just that they wanted him to be a little bit more cheeky in that cha cha.\n\n\"I feel like Dev went out there and did exactly what they said.\"\n\nDev added that he also felt like he'd given the second performance his all.\n\n(Image: BBC/Guy Levy)\n\n(Image: BBC/Guy Levy)\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\nBut sadly it wasn't enough for the judges who unanimously voted to save Viscountess Weymouth and Aljaz Skorjanec.\n\nDianne was so upset by the decision she couldn't complete the obligatory final dance and pulled out of appearing on the show's podcast with her boyfriend Joe Sugg after filming wrapped.\n\n(Image: BBC/Guy Levy)\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nBut the red-head said she hopes it's not over for Dev and she'll continue teaching him if he wants to continue to learn to dance.\n\n\"I'm just really, really sad it's over,\" Dianne told Rylan Clark-Neal.\n\nRadio 1 DJ Dev also said that he was shocked by the judges' final say as he had given it is all in the dance-off.\n\n\"I feel like I really, really went for it and tried to give it everything ... I guess it wasn't enough.\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nViewers have also been expressing their shock at the couple's early eviction.\n\nSome have even accused the show of 'fixing' the results by claiming they could not get through when they tried to vote for Dev on Saturday night.\n\nWhile others said they may not tune in again after claiming the judges got it wrong.\n\nShirley Ballas appeared on Monday's Loose Women where she opened up about the situation.\n\nShe said that she voting public were also responsible for Dev's demise.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n\"People have got to get out there and vote. we do our job. As you can see there were many people saved with lot lower scores.\n\n\"It's just so important...I respect everybody at home who\u2019s been watching fifteen series. Everyone has a favourite. We do our job to the best we can.\n\n\"We have to do it right there in that split second on the one minute 20 seconds. We have to make a decision.\n\n\"The three judges were unanimous. It wasn\u2019t down to me. It was unanimous and I agreed.\"\n\n*Strictly Come Dancing returns on Saturday 19th October at 6.40pm with the results show on Sunday 20th October at 7.15pm on BBC One", "description": "Dianne Buswell spoke of her upset with the Strictly Come Dancing judges in her first TV interview with evicted Dev Griffin", "authors": ["Lucy Needham", "Image", "Bbc", "Digital Eroteme.Co.Uk", "Bbc Guy Levy", "Pa", "Itv"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20580261.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Strictlys-Diane-stunned-judges-voted-Dev-off-as-he-did-exactly-what-they-said.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
