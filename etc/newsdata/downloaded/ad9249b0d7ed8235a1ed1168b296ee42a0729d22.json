What is he using that time to do? Well, he started his free Sunday by angrily tweeting about the NFL and Patriots owner Robert Kraft.\n\nWill not be playing in the @NFL anymore these owners can cancel deals do whatever they want at anytime we will see if the @NFLPA hold them accountable sad they can just void guarantees anytime going on 40m 2 months will see if they pay up ! \u2014 AB (@AB84) September 22, 2019\n\nBrown is referring to the $9 million bonus that was guaranteed to him when he signed with the Patriots. The Pats cut him just days before $5 million of that was due.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nWhile the money is guaranteed, Yahoo Sports\u2019 Charles Robinson wrote on Sept. 11 that the Patriots included language in Brown\u2019s contract that allows them to void that guarantee if he undermines the image of the team.\n\nBrown said in the tweet that he \u201cwill not be playing in the NFL anymore,\u201d but this isn\u2019t the first time he\u2019s threatened to quit football. He tweeted something similar just last month (was it only a month ago?) when he was fighting with the NFL and his former team, the Oakland Raiders, about his choice of helmet. It wasn\u2019t true then, but it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess if it\u2019ll be true this time.\n\nThat tweet alone would have been enough to keep Brown\u2019s name on everyone\u2019s lips on Sunday, but he wasn\u2019t done. He had something to say about Pats owner Robert Kraft.\n\nStory continues\n\nKraft got caught in the parlor AB speculations fired different strokes different folks clearly \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2642\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/eKrAE0Vwih \u2014 AB (@AB84) September 22, 2019\n\nBrown tried but badly failed to show the hypocrisy between Kraft\u2019s situation and his own. Kraft allegedly had a consensual sexual encounter with a massage parlor employee. Brown is accused of forcibly raping a woman while she repeatedly yelled for him to stop. And as if it wasn\u2019t enough for him to equate a consensual sexual encounter with forcible rape, he included what appears to be a picture of him and Britney Taylor, his former trainer who has accused him of raping her.\n\nBrown didn\u2019t just go after the owner of his former team. He went after Pittsburgh Steelers QB Ben Roethlisberger and NFL analyst and Hall of Famer Shannon Sharpe.\n\n4 games for Big Ben crazy world I\u2019m done with it pic.twitter.com/ZXVZXzM4xh \u2014 AB (@AB84) September 22, 2019\n\nShannon Sharp the funny guy on tv \ud83d\udcfa still after this pic.twitter.com/ZlVvvOqKWg \u2014 AB (@AB84) September 22, 2019\n\nIt\u2019s true that both Roethlisberger and Sharpe have been accused of sexual assault and are still employed. What Brown seems to be missing is that right now, no one is stopping him from playing football. He\u2019s acting like he\u2019s been banned for life when he\u2019s just under investigation. If a team signs him he\u2019ll likely land on the commissioner\u2019s exempt list, which would be a waste of time and money for that team.\n\nRight now, teams are probably waiting until the NFL finishes its investigation before they sign him, especially since a suspension could follow. But once he\u2019s done serving his suspension, he\u2019s free to play football \u2014 just like Roethlisberger was.\n\nAnd to add a cherry on top of Brown\u2019s unhinged Sunday morning tweetstorm, he essentially endorsed Patriots fans threatening the Sports Illustrated writer who exposed Brown\u2019s second accuser and his efforts to intimidate her.\n\nSomeone needs to delete the Twitter app from Brown\u2019s phone, or maybe just take his entire phone away, because he\u2019s not doing himself any favors.\n\nAntonio Brown is using his free Sunday to angrily tweet about the NFL and Robert Kraft.
