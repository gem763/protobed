In an ongoing lawsuit, Smith alleges that delayed diagnosis and treatment resulted in devastating amputations of her legs and hands. Jarrad Henderson, USA TODAY\n\nAs part of its ongoing \u201cDeadly Deliveries\u201d investigation, USA TODAY examined usually secret patient billing records from 7 million births in 13 states to identify U.S. hospitals with high childbirth complication rates. This part of the series on maternal harms focuses primarily on Touro Infirmary in New Orleans, one of at least 120 hospitals across the country where USA TODAY found that mothers suffer severe childbirth complications at rates double that of other hospitals. A related data tool allows people to find out how their local maternity hospitals fared in the states that provided data.\n\nWomen at these outlier hospitals were more than twice as likely to have had blood transfusions, hysterectomies, seizures, heart attacks, strokes or other indicators that their deliveries were far from routine. Touro\u2019s rate, for instance, was 2.8 percent \u2013 or 367 of more than 13,000 women who delivered there from 2014 to 2017.\n\nHospitals are quick to blame patients, saying they arrive carrying the baggage of poverty and poor prenatal care. But USA TODAY found that is only part of the story. At Touro, the data, medical records and lawsuits reveal a complicated mix of misdiagnoses, delayed care and a failure to follow safety measures.\n\nWith 700 women dying every year and about 50,000 more injured, the U.S. has the highest maternal death rate among the world's developed nations. The first part of USA TODAY\u2019s \u201cDeadly Deliveries\u201d investigation published in July, revealing that every year, thousands of women suffer life-altering injuries or die from childbirth because hospitals and medical workers skip safety practices known to save lives. Following that investigation, the leadership of the House Committee on Ways and Means sent letters to maternity hospitals across the country asking them to answer a series of questions and provide copies of protocols and data about mothers dying and being injured from childbirth. In December, Congress passed and the president signed into law landmark legislation to create a national program to confidentially collect and analyze standardized data on every mother\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cWe were heartened by the calls to action to improve childbirth safety following our initial \u2018Deadly Deliveries\u2019 installment and believe that putting a focus on hospitals with the highest rates could inform a road map to improvement,\u201d said Alison Young, USA TODAY investigative reporter.\n\n\u201cThe real-life \u2013 and potentially life-saving \u2013 impact already being made by \u2018Deadly Deliveries\u2019 is exactly why USA TODAY invests in investigative reporting,\u201d said Amy Pyle, USA TODAY national investigations editor.\n\nTo learn more about USA TODAY\u2019s latest investigation, visit https://maternal.usatoday.com.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/pr/2019/03/07/usa-today-identifies-hospitals-high-childbirth-complication-rates/3090174002/", "description": "Examination of usually secret patient billing records identifies U.S. hospitals with higher-than-average rates of dangerous complications.", "authors": ["Staff", "Usa Today Network Pressroom", "Published A.M.
