I've never heard such patronising nonsense.\n\nFirst, most women my age have no problem whatsoever talking about the menopause. They do so in their droves, on radio phone-ins, in chat rooms, on TV.\n\nThere's barely a female celebrity aged 45 and over who hasn't spoken about her experience, from Carol Vorderman and Davina McCall to Jennifer Saunders and Lorraine Kelly.\n\nCarol Vorderman (left) and Lorraine Kelly (right) are among a raft of celebrities to have discussed the difficulties of the menopause\n\nDawn Butler and Jeremy Corbyn at the Labour party conference in Brighton last month\n\nI myself have written extensively about it in this newspaper \u2014 some might argue ad nauseam. If Ms Butler thinks it's still a taboo issue, perhaps she should cancel her subscription to Socialist Worker and buy the Mail instead.\n\nSecond, the idea that singling out a group of people for special treatment will 'reduce workplace stigma' is absurd. Nothing creates an atmosphere of fear and loathing in the workplace quite like the notion that some employees are not pulling their weight.\n\nAfter all, men, too, suffer from debilitating middle-aged symptoms \u2014 losing the hair on their heads, acquiring it in other places such as ears and noses, becoming obsessed with fast cars and motorbikes, and so on. How long before they too start clamouring for time off to alleviate these conditions?\n\nJoking aside, not only would such a policy be a headache for employers and open to all kinds of abuse, it's also inherently sexist.\n\nIt takes us back to Victorian times when women were dismissed as the weaker sex, unable to participate normally in everyday life on account of their hormones.\n\nIt implies that, because of our fundamental biology, we are unequal to men and incapable of carrying out tasks without concessions being made on our behalf.\n\nNext thing you know, Labour will be saying we need time off because our brains are too small.\n\nDon't get me wrong: the menopause is a challenge. Many women suffer a whole raft of unpleasant symptoms \u2014 I know, I've been there. But the idea that these somehow render us invalids, unfit for work and in need of special pleading, is beyond infuriating.\n\nThere's barely a female celebrity aged 45 and over who hasn't spoken about her experience, from Davina McCall (left) to Jennifer Saunders (right)\n\nIn fact, if anything, they make us tougher by the very fact of having to overcome them. In the same way that parents are often excellent employees because they are reliable, less selfish and good at pulling together as a team, menopausal and post-menopausal women have a determination and wisdom that others lack.\n\nEmployers shouldn't be getting less of us, but more.\n\nLook around you. The world is full of strong, independent, beautiful women managing just fine without this patronising little policy. So thanks, Ms Butler, but no thanks. We'll take the HRT instead, and battle on.\n\nPersonally, I find the spectacle of politician\u2019s families being paraded for the cameras rather tiresome; but I did love the sight of Sajid Javid\u2019s mum in the audience during his speech at Party Conference. I can\u2019t help feeling that if more of our elected representatives had their mothers keeping a stern eye on them, the standard of debate would be greatly improved. Even better, if the mums were put in charge for a day (obviously in Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s case it would have to be his nanny), I\u2019m sure Brexit would be done and dusted in time for Corrie.\n\nNow I'm worried about vaping too\n\nThis week saw the first death linked to vaping in the UK. In America, no fewer than 13 fatalities are being blamed on e-cigarettes \u2014 including several young people.\n\nAs the mother of teenagers, I am suddenly a bit panicked about this. Like many parents, I bought the Public Health England line that vapes are '95 per cent safer than cigarettes'.\n\nVapes and flavoured vaping liquids sit on display\n\nWhile not exactly thrilled at the prospect, I did at least feel that as an exercise in damage limitation, they were better than a pack of 20 B&H.\n\nNow this throws all that into question. Meanwhile, vapes continue to be ruthlessly targeted at young people through social media 'influencers', selling flavours deliberately aimed at the younger palate: mango, apple, vanilla. And it works: 67 per cent of 16 to 18-year-olds have tried them.\n\nForget alcopops: if it does turn out these devices are dangerous, this whole generation could be facing a serious health crisis.\n\nIf ever a situation called for urgent clarification, possibly in the form of a government inquiry, surely this is it.\n\nMother Nature's pleasure principle\n\nScientists are satisfied they have divined the reason for the female orgasm: the theory is that at an earlier stage of evolution, it was necessary to trigger ovulation. That is no longer the case, but the sensory infrastructure remains.\n\nThe other explanation, of course, is that Mother Nature is not stupid. She had to find some way of persuading women to engage in an act that carries a high risk of resulting in a painful and, even today, potentially fatal outcome: childbirth.\n\nA few seconds of fleeting pleasure seems the very least we deserve.\n\nIt's Mirren the marvellous\n\nContinuing this column's commitment to older women showing the younger generation how it's done (see last week's picture of Jennifer Lopez), here is Helen Mirren looking sensational at Paris Fashion Week in a Giambattista Valli dress. She has white hair, she's 74, she has bunions, she should be sipping tea in her bath chair. And yet she's never looked more alive. If this is the future, then sign me up.\n\nHelen Mirren walks the runway during the 'Le Defile L'Oreal Paris' Show as part of Paris Fashion Week on Saturday\n\nWar over warpaint\n\nApparently the Army is considering allowing male soldiers to wear make-up in the 'interests of equality'.\n\nCurrent rules state female personnel may do so as long as it is 'inconspicuous' (in which case why bother?).\n\nThe same rules require men to shave every day, including weekends.\n\nFollowing the relentless 'equality' logic, females will presumably be required to do the same.
