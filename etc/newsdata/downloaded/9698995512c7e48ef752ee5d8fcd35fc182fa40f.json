I only learnt about it a few years ago. Doing that research and going into it deeply, it really opened my eyes. I\u2019m just glad I learnt it.\u201d\n\nAsked if black history should be compulsory in schools, he says \u201cit needs to be channeled the right way,\u201d adding: \u201cYou don\u2019t want for [kids] to turn to hate themselves or hate other kids because of what happened [in the past]...
