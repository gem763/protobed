The outage is reportedly Chime's third since July and was caused by an issue with the database of payment processor Galileo, according to people familiar with the matter cited by CNBC. Business Insider Intelligence\n\nThe neobank tweeted at around 10:30 a.m. EST on Friday that card purchases, ATM withdrawals, direct deposits, ACH transfers, and Chime checkbook were working normally and that it was working to bring Pay Friends, mobile check deposits, and in-app support back online.\n\nThe outage struck Chime at a highly inopportune moment, as it can disrupt its trajectory to achieve major scale. Chime has been working to raise new funding from investors at a valuation of at least $5 billion, per Axios, and its customer base is growing rapidly: It rose from 1 million users in mid-2018 to 5 million this year.\n\nAt this rate of growth, Chime is getting close to boasting the same number of clients as some of the smaller major US banks: The upcoming merger of SunTrust and BB&T, for example, is expected to yield a bank with around 10 million clients. Further, when asked which digital-first bank they have an account with, 8% of US adult respondents said they use Chime, according to primary research from Business Insider Intelligence (enterprise only) and Attest.\n\nRespondents to the online survey were representative of the US population on the criteria of age (18-73), gender, and living area. This data highlights that Chime has achieved a significant footprint in the region. But a major outage could hurt its growth trajectory in two ways: First, if customers are left in the lurch without access to their funds, they're much more likely to leave Chime; and second, the negative publicity surrounding the outage could discourage prospective customers.\n\nNeobanks as a whole can't afford outages like these in their services, as it calls into question their usefulness relative to incumbent banks. Outages of online banking tools happen to all banks, but an online banking outage lasting more than 24 hours for a bank that extends its services exclusively through online channels is a disaster.\n\nOne of the main routes that neobanks can take to better profit margins as they're struggling on the road to profitability is to convince customers to use their neobank as a primary bank, which would boost both deposit and transaction volume.\n\nBut the prospect of suddenly losing access to banking services for an entire day or more could easily cause consumers to dismiss this possibility, as legacy banks at least have branches that can act as an analog failsafe option for customers to handle banking functions if online services go down.\n\nWant to read more stories like this one?
