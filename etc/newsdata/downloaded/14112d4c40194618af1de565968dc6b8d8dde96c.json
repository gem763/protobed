But they're battling hate speech with more speech.\n\nPeople hold up signs and shout while listening to speakers during a Rally Against Hate. (Photo: Josh Edelson, AP)\n\nAs graduation season approaches and commencement speakers are announced, universities are no doubt bracing for yet another season of controversy over the choice of speaker. And no wonder: A recurrent, troubling theme in the news media is that college students\u2019 support for free speech is diminishing, especially when they find the speech offensive. In March, a Gallup/Knight Foundation survey found that a majority of students value diversity over free speech, and that nearly two-thirds think the First Amendment should not protect hate speech.\n\nThere is less media coverage, however, of survey data highlighting positive aspects of students\u2019 reported experiences concerning both diversity and free speech. For example, in a 2016 Gallup/Knight survey, nearly three-fourths of students described the racial climate on their campus as excellent or good. These positive attitudes were shared by large majorities of Hispanic (75%), Asian (70%), and black (62%) students. Moreover, in the 2018 Gallup/Knight survey, only one out of four students overall said they have felt uncomfortable because of something that was said on campus about their race, ethnicity or religion and overwhelming majorities of students in all demographic and political categories say they are able to freely express their views.\n\nMore: Police must act fast to protect First Amendment rights: Robert Shibley\n\nMore: We need to restore trust in free speech. We're opening a new center to help: Napolitano\n\nIn September 2017, Buzzfeed News reported similarly encouraging results from what it described as \u201cthe first comprehensive survey of hate speech at higher education institutions since the 2016 election.\u201d While that survey confirmed 154 hate speech incidents at more than 120 campuses around the country (out of the almost 5,000 total), \u201ccolleges typically responded to bias incidents quickly and to the satisfaction of their students ... In nearly every case, university presidents sent off mass emails con\u00addemning the hate speech.\u201d In short, rather than censoring hate speech, the universities responded with the classic \u201ccounterspeech\u201d approach that is not only true to the First Amendment, but also effective in curbing hateful attitudes and actions. As Barack Obama has repeatedly told college and other audiences: \u201cThe strongest weapon against hateful speech is not repression; it is more speech \u2014 the voices of tolerance that rally against bigotry.\u201d\n\nSo why the disconnect between students\u2019 general satisfaction with the racial and free speech climates on their campuses, and their support for changing U.S. law to permit punishing hate speech? I think a major reason is that students underestimate the power of their own voices and other counterspeech in curbing hateful attitudes and actions, while overestimating the efficacy of censorship in doing so.\n\nMany human rights activists in other countries that strictly enforce hate speech laws have endorsed the American approach, concluding that it is more effective, as have experts in international agencies. For example, in 2015, the European Commission Against Racism and Intolerance concluded that counterspeech and other non-censorial measures are \u201cmuch more likely\u201d than censorship \u201cto prove effective in ultimately eradicating\u201d hateful speech and conduct.\n\nWhile hate speech and crimes are still too common in the U.S., they are swiftly and strongly condemned not only by those directly affected, but also by government officials, community lead\u00aders, and powerful social media campaigns like #BlackLivesMatter and #MeToo. This is hardly to say \u201cMission Accomplished\u201d when it comes to endemic societal and individual biases. But it is proof positive that human rights activism has been flourishing despite \u2014 or even because of \u2014 the hateful, discriminatory speech and conduct.\n\nMost encouragingly, marginalized populations are increasingly raising their voices and being taken seriously. Shaun Harper, Director of the University of Southern California\u2019s Race and Equity Center, describes this development as \u201can unmuting of black collegians,\u201d who are now \u201cspeaking more loudly\u201d than ever \u201cabout the \u2026 racism they experience in classrooms and elsewhere.\u201d Likewise, we recently have been witnessing the extraordinary \u201cunmuting\u201d of even much younger students to protest the gun violence that terrorizes their classrooms and lives.\n\nMore: My pro-free speech views made me the target of a smear campaign at Vassar College\n\nPOLICING THE USA: A look at race, media, justice\n\nIn contrast, extensive experience with hate speech laws in other mature democracies shows that they too often mute members of minority groups and their advocates. For example, the UN\u2019s Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination concluded that hate speech laws \u201chave been used to the detriment of\u201d minority groups, and threaten \u201cto curtail expressions of protest at injustice, social discontent or opposition.\u201d One case in point: In 2016, a French court criminally convicted an LGBT rights leader, and saddled her with a fine of more than $2500, for labeling the leader of an anti-marriage equality group as a \u201chomophobe.\u201d\n\nMoreover, there is no evidence that countries that enforce hate speech laws experience declines in the amount of either hateful speech or discriminatory behavior, and ample evidence to the contrary. Agnes Callamard, Director of Global Freedom of Expression at Columbia University, noted that European countries with strict hate speech laws recently have been \u201cravaged by intolerance and. . . increasing inequality,\u201d as well as \u201crising levels of violence and hate.\u201d Referring to the mounting anti-Semitic violence throughout Europe, on April 20, Israeli Independence Day, New York Times columnist Bret Stephens chillingly observed: \u201cTo be Jewish \u2014 at least visibly Jewish \u2014 in Europe is to live on borrowed time.\u201d\n\nWhich brings us back to college students\u2019 seemingly inconsistent attitudes, calling for censorship of hate speech while also feeling both more positive about the racial climate on their campuses, and more empowered to raise their voices against the still serious ongoing problems. I am hopeful that the two latter trends will ultimately persuade students that counterspeech \u2014 their own and others\u2019 \u2014 is a \u201cmuch more effective\u201d strategy than censorship for promoting further positive change. The speech of these students and many others before them has brought us this far in the struggle for equal rights \u2014 and it has the power to take us even further.\n\nNadine Strossen, a constitutional law professor at New York Law School, is also the past President of the American Civil Liberties Union.
