What an amazing night for rugby in general!!\"\n\nThe Japanese pace, allied with the ability of halfbacks Yu Tamura and Yutaka Nagare to exploit the shortside before changing the direction of play, was crucial to the hosts' attacking game plan.\n\nSuch tactics, however, mean teams tire. Japan did just that, letting Scotland back into the game with two second-half tries.\n\nBut the team skippered by the inspirational flanker Michael Leitch dug deep and showed another side of their make-up: a mental fortitude and defensive tenacity that effectively shut down the game.\n\nIt is not easy to train such combative cohesiveness, but Japan's veteran lock Luke Thompson explained that everything had been well planned.\n\n\"We have been to some dark places in preparation - pretty tough camps and that is modern rugby,\" said the 38-year-old Kiwi-born second-rower, who is playing his fourth World Cup.\n\n\"You don't go out and do that stuff by accident, you have to earn it.\"\n\nJoseph said there was no doubt his players had benefited from exposure to Super Rugby with Japan's Sunwolves outfit.\n\n\"It was the tenacity, I guess, of our team at crucial parts of the Test which helped,\" he said.\n\n\"Persistence and confidence and trust the plan is what saw us through. In the last two or three minutes it was a Test match we didn't want to lose.\"\n\nDawson said Japan were playing a \"unique\" style.\n\n\"Not even the All Blacks play at some of the speed they do,\" the former scrum-half said.\n\nScotland coach Gregor Townsend predicted a \"very tough game\" for South Africa in the quarter-finals.\n\n\"Japan play a really fast game and create quick ruck ball at the ruck and they execute their set piece really well,\" he said. \"It will be a very close game.\"", "description": "Japan weren't expected to reach the Rugby World Cup quarter-finals, but they have surprised the sport by unleashing a \"unique\" style.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7921/898d2ea2b6f142ba872aacf77a16dd16.png", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
