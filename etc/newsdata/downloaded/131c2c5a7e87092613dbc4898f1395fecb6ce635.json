In June, Salesforce.com Inc. CRM, -2.14% agreed to acquire Tableau Software Inc. for $15.7 billion, and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s GOOG, -1.66% GOOGL, -1.76% Google Cloud agreed to buy analytics software company Looker for $2.6 billion in cash.\n\nNeither company was done \u2014 Salesforce has since agreed to acquire ClickSoftware for $1.4 billion and Google acquired cloud-computing company Elastifile for an undisclosed sum. Competitors have jumped in too, with VMware Inc. VMW, +0.64% agreeing to spend about $5 billion to acquire cybersecurity company Carbon Black Inc. CBLK, -0.42% and former spinoff Pivotal Software Inc. PVTL, -0.13%, while Splunk Inc. SPLK, -3.22% agreed to buy cloud monitoring company SignalFX for $1.05 billion in cash and stock.\n\nThey are not alone \u2014 here are some of the biggest software acquisitions since last summer.\n\nThe acquisition drive has been driven by large tech companies seeking to shore up gaps in their offerings, primarily in the areas of cybersecurity, data analytics, and AI, according to Maribel Lopez, principal analyst at Lopez Research.\n\n\u201cFor the most part, every single large IT vendor has some hole in one of those three areas that they need to fill,\u201d Lopez told MarketWatch.\n\nStifel analyst Tom Roderick agreed, saying digital disruption trends are making tech companies scramble to shore up their gaps.\n\n\u201cFrom a fundamental angle, digital disruption in the enterprise has never been more prevalent, which means that large scale technology vendors at risk of being disrupted are moving faster and paying more aggressive multiples to acquire next generation businesses that help future proof their portfolio of products,\u201d Roderick told MarketWatch.\n\nPrime examples, Roderick said, are International Business Machines Inc. breathing life into its \u201cmoribund\u201d cloud strategy by buying Red Hat, and SAP picking up Qualtrics just a month after the Utah-based software company had filed for an initial public offering. Those companies, like Salesforce especially, are doing everything they can to be a one-stop shop for businesses.\n\n\u201cSecondarily, behind fundamentals, you shouldn\u2019t dismiss the tax reform act put in place in 2017 that served to repatriate meaningful levels of cash reserves for some of the biggest tech vendors in the U.S.,\u201d Roderick said.\n\nLopez said that momentum may last for another few months but that depends on how the fourth quarter works out as the U.S. economy deals with President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war with China and inverted yield curves. Software stocks were a big target for investors looking for continued growth in tech earlier this year, but the momentum has seemingly slowed.\n\nWhile the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF IGV, -0.95% is up 24% for the year to date, it\u2019s only up 2.6% over the past three months. The ETFMG Prime Cyber Security ETF HACK, -0.95% is up 12% for the year but down 2% over the past three months. The First Trust Cloud Computing ETF SKYY, -1.19% is up 19% for the year but flat over the past three months.\n\nIn comparison, while the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.69% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -1.11% are up about 16% and 20%, respectively, for the year, the S&P 500 is up 4.7% over the past three months and the Nasdaq is up 4.8%.\n\nIf stock prices stall out or turn around, the momentum for acquisitions \u2014 especially with stock \u2014 could turn around as well.\n\n\u201cIf people\u2019s stock get pummeled in Q4, they\u2019re not going to be out buying things for a billion dollars,\u201d Lopez said. \u201cSo if you\u2019re a startup and you can get out with somebody in the coming like two, three months, it\u2019s a good time to exit. After that, it could stall out for a bit.\u201d", "description": "A recent surge in software company acquisitions may keep going for another few months while the cash is still out there but a rocky fourth quarter might take...", "authors": ["Wallace Witkowski"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GT025_ibmred_ZG_20181029210758.jpg"}
