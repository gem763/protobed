The picture also clearly shows the type of lock and handle the door has, making it even easier for potential burglars to plan their entry\n\nNaive homeowners like Zoella are unwittingly giving burglars large amounts of information that can assist break-ins.\n\nBy showing off expensive televisions, sound systems and other valuable electrical goods, influencers and celebrities are making themselves more vulnerable to theft.\n\nOne picture highlighted by the research shows Geordire Shore star Gaz Beadle, 31, posing in his back garden with his son and two dogs.\n\nTo the untrained eye it seems like a sweet family snap, but experts warned that the image shows multiple points of entry for anyone planning to break in and swipe the star's prized possesions.\n\nHere, Gary Beadle poses with his son whilst revealing the entire back of his home and garden, including several potential entry points, such as windows and sliding doors which are left ajar\n\nA spokesperson for Origin told Femail: 'Here, Gary Beadle poses with his son whilst revealing the entire back of his home and garden, including several potential entry points, such as windows and sliding doors which are left ajar'.\n\nGary wasn't the only Geordie Shore star to overshare their home. His ex-girlfriend Charlotte Crosby, 29, recently shared an image of her posing on her crushed velvet sofa - a trend popular with influencers.\n\nBut in the snap, she gives potential intruders a look at her windows and the layout of her house, which could help assist a break in.\n\nThe master bedroom was second in the list of rooms shared online, despite being the room intruders are most likely to target for jewellery, cash and other valuables.\n\nThe kitchen and garden then closely follow as the most likely spaces that homeowners are inadvertently posting on their public profiles.\n\nCharlotte Crosby, 29, recently shared an image atop her crushed velvet sofa - a trend popular with influencers. But in the snap, she gives potential intruders a look at her windows and the layout of her house, which could help plan their entry\n\nBen Brocklesby, director at Origin, said: 'We help thousands of UK homeowners improve the security of their homes every year and conducted this research as we wanted more people to be aware of the dangers of oversharing online.\n\n'Strong and secure doors and windows is just one step to beating the burglar - residents also need to be conscious of what they are sharing online.\n\n'Something as simple as sharing a photo on a public profile can give burglars a shop window view into your home.'\n\nPhotographs of keys by the front door, showing exactly where they are kept during the day, was among the posts analysed during the research.\n\nOther posts that were equally as inviting for criminals included photos of expensive cars positioned right outside properties.\n\nOne user hadn't turned off location tracking, which means anyone using the social media channel could not only see the car and its number plate, but also exactly where it was kept overnight.\n\nHere, Olivia Bowen poses in front of her front door, offering another angle of their home and a clear view of potential entry points for an intruder\n\nLove Island stars Olivia Buckland, 25, and her husband Alex Bowen, 28, often share snaps taken inside their lavish Essex pad.\n\nIn one snap, while Olivia stuns in a bright orange dress, the background shows her front door and the type of lock she has.\n\nIn another, the pair pose outside their home revealing two cars, their garage door and several windows, helping burglars to identify where they live and the assets they own.\n\nInfluencer Poppy Deyes, sister of Zoella's boyfriend Alfie, was also among the famous faces that overshared snaps of their home.\n\nIn one image, the 28-year-old, sits atop a kitchen island in a blue boiler suit; but the background shows glass panelled doors which could be used by burglars as an entry point.\n\nIn another, the pair pose outside their home revealing two cars, their garage door and several windows, helping burglars to identify where they live and the assets they have\n\nLove Island star Georgia Steel, 21, is also guilty of revealing too much of her home.\n\nThe reality TV personality inadvertently offered potential intruders a glance into her flat, including a view of the sliding doors which lead to a first floor balcony in one of her many Instagram snaps.\n\nDoug Skins from Secured by Design said: 'While it's great to keep in touch with your friends and family, be careful about what you share online as you never know who else may see your activity.\n\n'Think seriously about who can read your posts and secure your profile by checking privacy settings. Also, think before you share \u2013 do you really need to make that information or photo public?'\n\nIn this image, Poppy Deyes offers followers a view into her kitchen, including a glass panelled door which could be used by burglars as an entry point\n\nHere Love Island's Georgia Steel inadvertently offers potential intruders a glance into her flat, including a view of the sliding doors which lead to a first floor balcony\n\nBen Brocklesby concluded: 'With the rise of interiors influencers sharing photos of their properties online every day, it's unsurprising that homeowners want to contribute to this trend by proudly sharing photos of the inside of their house with followers.\n\n'Even something as simple as taking a selfie with friends can mean you're sharing snippets of your home in the background.\n\n'By making profiles private and being careful not to share photos of access points and valuables, homeowners can make sure their property stays safe and secure.'\n\nPublic profiles of 500 UK homeowners were analysed as part of the research, with nearly 50 per cent posting at least one photograph of their home online.", "description": "Conducted by Origin, a British window and door brand, in partnership with Secured by Design, the national police crime prevention initiative, the researcher have revealed the risks of oversharing.", "authors": ["Bridie Pearson-Jones For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/15/20085790-0-image-a-16_1571839318123.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
