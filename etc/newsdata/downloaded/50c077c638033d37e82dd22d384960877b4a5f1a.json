This morning, for example, the Republican continued tweeting, for no apparent reason, about how great it would\u2019ve been to hold the international gathering at his Doral, Florida, golf resort.\n\nThis afternoon, as Politico reported, Trump continued whining.\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Monday claimed he\u2019s receiving unfair scrutiny because of the \u201cphony emoluments clause,\u201d as he defended his prior decision to host next year\u2019s G-7 summit at his Doral resort in Miami. Trump over the weekend reversed himself and canceled plans to hold the meeting of world leaders at his property after numerous critics questioned whether the move would violate a Constitutional clause that forbids a president from profiting from foreign governments or receiving any money from the U.S. government except his or her annual salary. \u201cYou people with this phony emoluments clause,\u201d Trump said has he took questions from reporters during a Cabinet meeting.\n\nIt\u2019s worth emphasizing, whether the president realizes this or not, that his emoluments troubles pre-date his G7 gambit. There have been multiple court cases, for example, challenging Trump\u2019s D.C. hotel accepting foreign funds, which indirectly end up in the Republican\u2019s pocket.\n\nBut more important is the fact that Trump considers the emoluments clause to the Constitution \u201cphony.\u201d That\u2019s absurd, even by 2019 standards.\n\nArticle I, Section 9 of the U.S. Constitution \u2013 a document, incidentally, that Trump swore to preserve, protect, and defend \u2013 states, \u201c[N]o Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State.\u201d\n\nThe Constitution\u2019s framers took very seriously the threat of American officials being beholden to foreign powers, which is why this clause of the Constitution is more than a legal afterthought. Rather, it\u2019s a key principle of the document that created our government.\n\nTo be sure, it was relatively obscure before the Trump era, but that\u2019s largely because we haven\u2019t traditionally had many leading American officials who\u2019ve tried to accept funds from foreign states.\n\nBut stepping back, there\u2019s a broader concern about the president\u2019s occasional hostility for the Constitution he has a responsibility to uphold.\n\nTrump\u2019s White House recently argued, for example, that the congressional impeachment process, as outlined by the Constitution, is actually unconstitutional. Earlier in the year, the president and his team claimed Trump could grant himself the authority to redirect federal funds, in defiance of Congress\u2019 wishes, despite the Constitution giving Congress the power of the purse.\n\nEven before taking office, there were some hints in this direction. In July 2016, then-candidate Trump met with GOP lawmakers on Capitol Hill, and members sought some assurances about his constitutional principles.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t particularly impressed,\u201d then-Rep. Mark Sanford (R-S.C.) said at the time. \u201cIt was the normal stream of consciousness that\u2019s long on hyperbole and short on facts. At one point, somebody asked about Article I powers: What will you do to protect them? I think his response was, \u2018I want to protect Article I, Article II, Article XII,\u2019 going down the list.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Constitution consists of seven articles. There is no Article XII.\n\nFor years, many on the right took great care to describe themselves as \u201cconstitutional conservatives.\u201d If any of them have principled concerns about the president\u2019s antics, now would be an excellent time for them to speak up.", "description": "We were reminded again today that Trump has a strained relationship with the Constitution he swore to preserve, protect, and defend.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/videos/n_msnbc_brk_trump_dems_impeachment_191021_1920x1080.jpg?itok=d_Xr5wtv", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
