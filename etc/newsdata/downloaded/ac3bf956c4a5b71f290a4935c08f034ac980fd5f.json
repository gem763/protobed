The big sticking point is the portrayal of the famous super villain as a sad, mentally-disturbed loser driven to breaking point by a series of unhappy breaks that would have shredded Job\u2019s fortitude.\n\nArthur Fleck is one of life\u2019s victims. In his 40s he lives with his invalid mother (Frances Conroy) in a seedy apartment block in Gotham City. He imagines a future for himself as a stand-up comedian but he\u2019s scary rather than funny. Arthur has a mental problem that causes him to laugh hysterically when under pressure \u2013 and every day brings new pressures.\n\nJoker conceives a hopeless passion for the single mum who lives down the hall (played by Zazie Beetz).\n\nThat laugh is a high-pitched shriek that cascades into a mad cackle. It\u2019s one of the few recognisable traits he shares with the Joker we know from the Batman movies.\n\nArthur\u2019s day job is working as a clown, complete with fright wig, grease paint and floppy shoes, but rather than spreading joy he attracts aggravation. He\u2019s beaten up more than once, betrayed by friends, and conceives a hopeless passion for the single mum who lives down the hall (Zazie Beetz). His own mother is forever writing letters to her former employer \u2013 billionaire businessman Thomas Wayne, (Yes, another Trump surrogate!) who ignores her pleas for assistance.\n\nHeath Ledger's performance as Joker set the benchmark for the character. AP\n\nNo present-day actor is better than Joaquin Phoenix when it comes to playing the psycho. He was chilling last year in the role of a well-intentioned serial killer in Lynne Ramsay\u2019s You Were Never Really There. That film now reads like a rehearsal for Joker. There was the same mad stare, the same hesitant, stumbling speech, the same buried trauma. The character even lived with his old mum.\n\nHe was always going to have to work hard to get past Heath Ledger\u2019s electrifying performance as the Joker in The Dark Knight Rises (2008), but he\u2019s incandescent. There\u2019s rarely a moment when Phoenix isn\u2019t on screen. We follow him through every sordid episode of Arthur\u2019s life and creep inside his mind. Todd Phillips makes these fantasy sequences so naturalistic we are continually having to do a double-take. It seems impossible that Arthur would elicit warm, paternal feelings from talk show host, Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro); or get admiring looks from the girl down the hall.\n\nIt\u2019s all in his head, and for a few bewildering minutes it\u2019s in ours as well. The real Arthur seems designed to give everyone the creeps with his long greasy hair, his boney frame, and his weird stare. When he smiles it comes across as a sinister leer. It\u2019s so creepy it may prevent Phoenix from taking out the Oscar for which he is now a front-runner.\n\nThe critical disapproval of Joker seems to kick in when Arthur undergoes a transformation which permits him to unleash the violent impulses that have been raging around in his psyche for most of his life.", "description": "No present-day actor is better than Joaquin Phoenix when it comes to playing the psycho.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.899%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_404%2C$y_23/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/138aad21a11f773b8db3c75725a938d78cc021f7", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
