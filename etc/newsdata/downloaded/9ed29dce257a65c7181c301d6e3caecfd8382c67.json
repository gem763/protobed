The result is a bid-ask spread for the average S&P 500 stock that is close to a multi-year high,\u201d she wrote. The bid-ask spread is the difference between the prices quoted for an immediate purchase (the bid) and the immediate sale (the ask) of an asset.\n\nJerry Lucas, senior trading strategist at UBS Global Wealth Management, said that the rise of high-frequency trading algorithms, which increasingly serve as market makers, are \u201calso causing headaches for traders.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe algos provide great liquidity when there is no news, but when a big new comes in the algos go away until things stabilize,\u201d he said.\n\nOther market observers say that looking just at volumes for individual stocks no longer presents a full picture of the S&P 500 universe, which is increasingly comprised of derivatives like exchange-traded funds, futures and options.\n\n\u201cTrading volumes in stocks is a small part of the story compared to trading in indices, futures, and ETFs and so on,\u201d Tim Edwards, managing director of index investment strategy at S&P Dow Jones Indices told MarketWatch. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t alarm me that you\u2019re seeing less volume in individual stocks.\u201d\n\nEdwards said that while there is a stereotype that ETF investors are passive, the data show that these instruments are being used very actively, and therefore declining liquidity in individual stocks isn\u2019t creating a situation where the overall market isn\u2019t performing its \u201cprice discovery\u201d function.\n\nIn a recent research paper, Edwards showed that in 2018 there was $127.56 trillion in trades either directly in or linked to the S&P 500, and that the asset-weighted holding period of these instruments was just 11 days, suggesting that there were plenty of willing buyers and sellers of these instruments.\n\nModernIR\u2019s Quast, however, argued that one can\u2019t take solace in the stability of the derivative market if the securities that undergird that market are increasingly illiquid.\n\n\u201cInvestors expect the ETF to reflect what the underlying stocks are doing, but growing spreads indicated that\u2019s not necessarily the case,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, \u201cThe waxing and waning of spreads becomes and end to itself when investors think ETFs are supposed to be a proxy for stocks.\u201d", "description": "S&P 500 volumes hover near record lows, contributing to fears that decreased liquidity could exaggerate market swings.", "authors": ["Chris Matthews", "Markets Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT721_dry_as_ZG_20191021135215.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
