People only \"know\" what they see on the internet.'\n\nMiley also addressed the inequity of how famous women are portrayed in their pursuit of love and intimacy, as compared to famous men.\n\nFormer love: Miley and Liam married in 2018 before splitting over the summer (pictured in 2012)\n\n'Men (especially successful ones) are RARELY slut shamed. They move on from one beautiful woman to the next MOST times without consequence. They are referred to as \"legends\", \"heart throbs\",' she continued, 'where women are called sluts/whores! I am trying to just THRIVE/survive in a \"mans\" world.'\n\n'If we can't beat em, join em!' Miley concluded the section. 'If our president can \"grab em by the p***y...\" can't I just have a kiss and acai bowl?!?!'\n\nAfter specifically responding to being recently spotted kissing Cody, she addressed the budding relationship on the next screen of her Instagram story.\n\n'I refuse to recluse and \"date\" from home cause A. That's not fun B. Extremely uncomfortable/puts me in a vulnerable position,' the Slide Away performer expressed.\n\nStating how she feels: After specifically responding to being recently spotted kissing Cody, she addressed the budding relationship on the next screen of her Instagram story\n\n'I would like to share an activity with someone I am dating and not be stuck at home with pretty much nothing to do but \"Netflix and chill\".\n\n'This \"dating\" thing is new to me too. I've never been an \"adult\"/grown a** woman experiencing this... I was in a committed relationship for almost All my teens and early 20s; with the exception of a few breaks, which usually in those times I was working my a** off with not much R&R... and \"meeting/trusting\" people in my position is really tuff.'\n\n'Don't f***ing pity me, not what I'm asking for,' Miley concluded. 'I have a great life I wouldn't trade for \"privacy\" but PLEASE don't make this awkward for me! I am trying to make light and like always MAKE FUN of myself/and the public's perception of me! Get used to me dating \u2013 this is where I am at!'\n\nThis isn't the first time the singer has used social media to vent.\n\nShortly after her split from Liam Hemsworth was made public late this summer, Cyrus made a public statement on Twitter an Instagram that revealed some of her feelings about the split, and how it was important for her to set the record straight.\n\n'At this point I had to make a healthy decision for myself to leave a previous life behind,' she tweeted on August 22.\n\n'I am the healthiest and happiest I have been in a long time. You can say I am a twerking, pot smoking, foul mouthed hillbilly but I am not a liar.'", "description": "Liam Hemsworth was spotted working up a sweat in Toronto, Canada on Saturday while he filmed his new movie, Dodge and Miles.", "authors": ["Annita Katee For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/00/19346860-0-image-a-77_1570319191927.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
