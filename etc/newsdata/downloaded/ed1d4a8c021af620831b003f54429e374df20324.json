President Donald Trump has given countries until November 4, 2018, to stop importing petroleum from Iran. This wide-scale ban is part of a new campaign of confrontation and pressure against the Islamic Republic. This demand comes on the heels of the U.S. departure from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), also known as the Iran nuclear deal, which was signed in 2015.\n\nDuring negotiations, the JCPOA was marketed as the only option for curtailing Iran\u2019s nuclear program short of war. Supporters of the deal routinely cited an increased risk of war in their arguments against exiting the deal and Rouhani\u2019s statement, on the surface, appears to confirm such concerns. But how seriously should these threats be taken?\n\nWe\u2019ve Been Here Before\n\nIran threatening to close the Strait of Hormuz is nothing new. In fact, as recently as 2012, the Obama administration had its own confrontation with Iran over the latter\u2019s nuclear program.

But a year later, both sides resorted to negotiations that led to the JCPOA.\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "(Close the Strait of Hormuz.)", "authors": ["Edward Chang"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/vVWaUxd0ZEybIY7AZr2LJg--~B/aD05NjA7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/b15bdeb3b8791643f51f2dc5dc4695e8", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
