But you have to be careful what you say in those situations as well.\n\n\"It\u2019s not only him, it\u2019s a lot of people. They speak a lot of bulls**t about us. It\u2019s always the same.\n\n(Image: Michael Regan)\n\n\u201cFor me it\u2019s strange because they were in the same situation as us. They were players as well.\n\n\u201cMaybe sometimes we play good, sometimes not so good.\n\n\"But if you speak every weekend, every game, bulls**t like this then they will not get respect for what they say.\u201d\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\nXhaka was also annoyed that Lys Mousset\u2019s winner for United came from a corner and it is the 22nd goal Arsenal have conceded from a set-piece under boss Unai Emery.\n\n\u201cOf course it\u2019s frustrating because it\u2019s so easy,\u201d said the midfielder. \u201cIt\u2019s too easy if you lose the game because of a corner or free-kick. We have to improve things.\n\n(Image: Michael Regan/Getty Images)\n\n\u201cWe did good things as well. We were compact in defence, they didn\u2019t have a lot of chances. But if you want to be in the top four, you have to beat Sheffield.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not interested in what people say and speak. We have to speak in our group to improve things and work hard.\u201d\n\nXhaka claims the Gunners must also show more resilience away from home, insisting it should not matter where they play.\n\n\u201cWe have to stop speaking about mentality or bulls**t like this,\u201d he said. \u201cFor me it\u2019s the same if you play home or away.\n\n\"You have to win. You have to show big character. You have to show good games and not to find always the same excuse.\u201d", "description": "Arsenal fell to a 1-0 defeat at Sheffield United and Evra - on duty as a Sky Sports pundit - called Arsenal \"babies\"", "authors": ["David Anderson", "Image", "Michael Regan", "Action Images Via Reuters", "Michael Regan Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20671042.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Premier-League-Sheffield-United-v-Arsenal.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
