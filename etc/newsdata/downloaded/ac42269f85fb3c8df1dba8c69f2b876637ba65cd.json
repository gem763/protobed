We knew we weren't going to get 5% growth.\"\n\nThe Trump-backed tax cuts and deregulation measures led to 2.9% growth in 2018, a year after U.S. GDP rose at a 2.4% pace. However, growth has slowed this year and some economists believe a recession could be a year or so away.\n\nMoore was part of the economic team that put together the president's growth package.\n\nIn March, Trump said he would nominate Moore to an open Federal Reserve governorship. Moore pulled his name from consideration two months later amid a battery of embarrassing headlines surrounding opinion columns he had previously written as well as allegations from his divorce proceedings.\n\nDuring his interview with Hasan, Moore concedes that Trump can be \"a jerk in public\" but said he likes the president.\n\n\"I think people underestimate his intelligence,\" Moore said. \"I bet his IQ \u2026 I think he's probably got about a 180 IQ. The guy is amazing, his breadth of knowledge about the world affairs.\"", "description": "Former Trump campaign advisor Stephen Moore says President Donald Trump knew he couldn't achieve the 5% growth he promised while campaining.", "authors": ["Jeff Cox"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105869285-1556118514411gettyimages-1132014040.jpeg?v=1570639442", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
