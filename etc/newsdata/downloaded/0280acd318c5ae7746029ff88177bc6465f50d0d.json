Leeds, who had only won once in eight previous games at home, ended the Championship\u2019s only unbeaten start.\n\n\u201cI am very disappointed,\u201d said Bilic. \u201cWe talked about this is a big opportunity.\u201d Instead, Leeds took it. Marcelo Bielsa was booked in a fractious encounter but delighted with his side\u2019s resilience. \u201cIt was a big, big effort from the team,\u201d the Leeds manager said.\n\nHis side\u2019s quick counter-attacking brought the only goal. After a blistering break, Jack Harrison then seemed to lose his way when tracked by a host of defenders, but he found the advancing Ezgjan Alioski. The left-back\u2019s driven shot took a telling deflection off the former Leeds defender Kyle Bartley on its way in.\n\nLeeds should have had a second goal, and were almost made to rue a remarkable double miss on the stroke of half-time as Sam Johnstone made a terrific double save from Patrick Bamford and Helder Costa. Neither was more than four yards out. Each should have scored.\n\nAlbion have been the Championship\u2019s comeback kings, taking 15 points from losing positions, and came agonisingly close to turning another game around. They nearly almost equalised immediately after conceding with Matheus Pereira drawing a fine save from Kiko Casilla. The Brazilian had four opportunities to level and kept coming agonisingly close.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs Leeds clung on to their lead, Bielsa was forced to substitute his substitute Tyler Roberts with the defender Luke Ayling. Bilic added: \u201cWe definitely deserved to score one goal. I am very proud of our performance, especially in the second half.\u201d\n\nLeeds goalkeeper Casilla played even though the FA are investigating a claim from Charlton that he racially abused their on-loan West Brom player Jonathan Leko on Saturday. Bielsa said: \u201cI couldn\u2019t give an opinion about this because it is for the authorities but we reject any act of racism.\u201d\n\nMatch details\n\nLeeds (4-1-4-1) Casilla; Dallas, White, Cooper (Berardi 34), Alioski; Phillips; Costa, Shackleton (Roberts 46 (Ayling 74)), Klich, Harrison; Bamford.\n\nSubstitutes Miazek (g), Douglas, Nketiah, Clarke.
