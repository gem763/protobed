Freddy Krueger\u2019s?) Kurt Cobain\u2019s green cardigan has them all beat by a landslide. The sweater he wore during Nirvana\u2019s MTV Unplugged performance was just purchased for $334,000. That price tag makes it the most expensive sweater ever auctioned, according to The Guardian. Kurt Cobain wore the sweater while performing at Sony Music Studios in front of a live audience on April 5, 1994, five months before he killed himself. The Manhattan-brand sweater is made of olive-green mohair and acrylic. It is unwashed with stains. The auction took place at the Hard Rock Cafe in New York during Julien\u2019s Auctions\u2019s two-day rock-memorabilia event.\n\nSOLD for $334,000! A vintage cardigan sweater worn by Kurt Cobain during Nirvana's MTV Unplugged performance in 1993.\n\n\n\nSold in our \"Icons & Idols: Rock 'N' Roll\" auction at the @HardRockCafeNYC and online at https://t.co/ahsXX38A8G! #JuliensAuctions #Auction #KurtCobain #Nirvana pic.twitter.com/lnxaTpxuoJ \u2014 Juliens Auctions (@JuliensAuctions) October 26, 2019\n\nOne of the musician\u2019s guitars was also auctioned off: a turquoise left-handed guitar that Cobain used during the In Utero tour. The buyer, who purchased it for $340,000, also received a handwritten note from Courtney Love saying that this was one of Cobain\u2019s favorite guitars. The instrument previously sat in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, where in a few months nominees like Whitney Houston and Dave Matthews Band may be inducted and honored alongside Cobain.", "description": "Nirvana front man Kurt Cobain\u2019s unwashed green sweater was auctioned off for $334,000, making it the most expensive sweater ever auctioned.", "authors": ["Zoe Haylock"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/28/28-kurt-cobain.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
