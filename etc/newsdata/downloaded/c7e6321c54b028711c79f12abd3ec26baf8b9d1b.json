Shares of the company rose 5.5% to 263.5 pence in early trading.\n\nCandy Ventures confirmed on Monday that it was in the early stages of considering an offer for Capco, following a report from The Times that Candy brothers, Nick and Christian Candy, have held early stage talks with Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund about a joint move on Capco.\n\nEarlier this year, the FTSE 250 company proposed to split its prime London estates of Covent Garden and Earls Court. It announced an intention to make Covent Garden as a central London focused REIT.\n\nCapco said last month there was progress with parties interested in buying the Earls Court business and that its board of directors were working with \u201cselected parties\u201d for a possible sale.\n\nIn May, the value of its interest in Earls Court was 412 million pounds, which was a steep drop in valuation from that of Dec. 31.\n\nCapco was in talks last year to sell the bulk of its interests in the estate to Hong Kong billionaire property developer Li Ka-shing\u2019s CK Asset Holdings (1113.HK).
