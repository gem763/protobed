The Madness Continues", "language": "en", "text": "I&I Editorial\n\nThe Nobel committee has cheapened its Peace Prize by handing it to some questionable, even asinine, recipients in the last few decades. It will reach a new low if, as some are predicting, and even hoping, it chooses Greta Thunberg this week.\n\nThe British Daily Mail reported last week that, according to oddsmakers, she \u201cis the one to beat\u201d for the prize, which carries a $930,000 payout. It is not, however, a sure thing. Greta\u2019s \u201cyouth, outspokenness and confrontational approach,\u201d says Reuters, \u201cpresent challenging questions for the Norwegian Nobel Committee.\u201d\n\nGiven the committee\u2019s record, though, it would be naive to think it won\u2019t do the most foolish thing it possibly could. Let\u2019s reacquaint ourselves with a few of the recent undeserving winners of the Nobel Peace Prize:\n\nYasser Arafat (1994), a known terrorist who shared the award with Israelis Shimon Peres and Yitzhak Rabin , and continued to order terrorist attacks after receiving the prize.\n\nand continued to order terrorist attacks after receiving the prize. Barack Obama (2009), \u201chonored\u201d just months after he took office, whose top accomplishments then, and remain to this day, nothing more than getting himself elected to public offices.\n\nAl Gore (2007), a charlatan and hypocrite who has ridden climate hysterics to the peaks of wealth and acclaim.\n\nAnd Rigoberta Menchu Tum (1992), the Guatemalan who claimed to be an advocate for the poor but whose \u201c\u2019achievements\u2019 cited by the Nobel committee\u201d were \u201clater revealed to have\u201d been largely made up, says the British Telegraph.\n\nHer prospects were apparently boosted by her recent United Nations \u201cspeech.\u201d Evidently being granted a bully pulpit in front of that body\u2019s general assembly, then using it to hector, nag, scowl, and in general behave with the entitlement mindset of a \u201cspoiled brat\u201d screeching \u201chow dare you\u201d multiple times is an impressive feat.\n\nWhile basking in the shining approval of puerile adults, Greta accused those in attendance, and all who were unfortunate enough to hear her, of having \u201cstolen my dreams and my childhood\u201d with \u201cempty words.\u201d This is a teen who has grown up in a time and place of privilege, prosperity, and peace that no generation has never seen. Yet, with \u201cgrown up\u201d heads nodding as if she\u2019s an oracle of the age, she has the gall to accuse someone \u2014 who? \u2014 of stealing the hope and expectations of her youth.\n\nIf her dreams and childhood have been stolen, they weren\u2019t taken by the companies that have for decades provided cheap energy that is the backbone of economic growth, and the consumers whose lives are immeasurably improved by their products. She has been robbed by her adult handlers, who have both indulged her idiosyncrasies and immaturity, and used her as a mascot for their pet cause.\n\nMaking the sorry spectacle of Greta-mania even more irksome is the fact that the narrative she\u2019s pushing is dubious at best. At worst, it\u2019s an outright fraud, kept alive by scientists with political agendas, militant activists, and willing dupes.\n\nThough it might seem so, the committee that hands out the Nobel Peace Prize isn\u2019t a collection of virtue-signaling, popularity-craving, shallow teenagers. It\u2019s made of virtue-signaling, popularity-craving, shallow adults who have in the past acted like teenagers, and in the near future might be shredding their final and already fraying thread of credibility by awarding a rude and insolent child a participation trophy.\n\n\u2014 Written by I&I Editorial Board\n\nNote to Readers: Issues & Insights is a new site launched by the seasoned journalists behind the legendary IBD Editorials page.
