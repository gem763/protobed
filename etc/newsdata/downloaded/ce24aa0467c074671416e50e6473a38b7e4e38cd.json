With a big player, there\u2019s a lot said and if you listen to it all the time, you can wonder what you\u2019re doing.\n\n\u2018I understood the quality of Christian. I understood his young age. He\u2019s just turned 21 recently and it\u2019s a big move for him. And I have other options for him in those areas. Let\u2019s give him full credit.\n\n\u2018He wants to know what I want for him, what the PL is like, what his new team-mates are like, that\u2019s not always going to be an easy road.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve just stayed calm with it, I see the big picture with him. I want him to be successful at this club because he\u2019s a good lad, he wants to do very well, that\u2019s very clear.\n\n\u2018Acting like he\u2019s acting, training like he\u2019s trained the last two or three weeks, playing like he\u2019s played the last two or three weeks obviously makes me very, very happy.\u2019\n\nChelsea\u2019s win in Amsterdam takes them to the top of their Champions League group.\n\nThe Blues host the Dutch giants at Stamford Bridge in a fortnight\u2019s time, where they can take hold of the group with another victory.\n\nMORE: Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain steals the show as Liverpool show their flair in comfortable win over Genk", "description": "Chelsea boss Frank Lampard insists he's delighted with Christian Pulisic's development at the club and says he had to 'shut his ears' at some of the criticism in recent weeks....", "authors": ["Sean Kearns"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1177772470_1571866220.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
