(AP) - There are plenty of reasons why the Tampa Bay Buccaneers have a losing record through five games, none more glaring than a struggling secondary that coach Bruce Arians says is not nearly physical enough for his taste.\n\nThe 66-year-old coach, in his first season of trying to transform a team that hasn\u2019t made the playoffs since 2007 into postseason contenders, went as far as to call his defensive backs \u201csoft\u201d following Sunday\u2019s 31-24 road loss to the New Orleans Saints.\n\nArians was asked Monday how he expects the mostly-young group of cornerbacks and safeties will respond to his characterization as the Bucs prepare to travel to London this week to host the Carolina Panthers on Sunday.\n\n\u201cPositively, I hope,\u201d the coach said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nThe Bucs have had one of the league\u2019s leakiest pass defenses for most of the club\u2019s 12-year playoff drought. The difficulty general manager Jason Licht and three different coaching staffs that have been assembled during the GM\u2019s tenure have had fixing the problem is reflected in the fact the team has used eight high draft picks over the past three years on defensive backs who\u2019ve yet make much of a difference.\n\nNevertheless, Arians remains confident that rookies Mike Edwards, Sean Murphy-Bunting and Jamel Dean, whose development has been slowed by injury, can help as the season progresses.\n\nWHAT\u2019S WORKING\n\nJameis Winston and the passing attack continue to make strides, even though the Saints were able to hold WR Mike Evans without a catch for only the second time in his six-year career. With defenses paying extra attention to Evans, third-year pro Chris Godwin continues to thrive. He had his third straight 100-yard game at New Orleans, finishing with seven receptions for 125 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nWHAT NEEDS HELP\n\nThe offensive line struggled against the Saints, who sacked Winston six times. Right tackle Demar Dotson and right guard Alex Cappa were injured Sunday, so the unit\u2019s depth will be tested.\n\nSTOCK UP\n\nWinston didn\u2019t have a huge game, but he played fairly well for the fourth straight week. The Bucs finished with just 252 yards total offense, in large part because they were unable to get the running game going and continue to struggle to convert on third down.\n\nSTOCK DOWN\n\nCB Vernon Hargreaves\u2019 play has slipped since returning an interception for a touchdown in the season opener against San Francisco and making a game-saving stop of Christian McCaffrey on fourth-and-less-than-yard from the Bucs 1 in the closing minutes a 20-14 victory over Carolina in Week 2.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to have better. I think he\u2019s capable of better,\u201d Arians said. \u201cHe\u2019s got great hands, he\u2019s got great anticipation, he\u2019s a very smart player, so yeah, I would expect a little bit more.\u201d\n\nINJURED\n\nDotson (hamstring) likely won\u2019t play against Carolina. Cappa has a broken arm and is expected to miss \u201ca few weeks,\u201d Arians said.\n\nKEY NUMBER\n\nAbout 20,400. Approximately the number of miles the Bucs will have flown by the time they complete a stretch of five games is which they won\u2019t play at Raymond James Stadium before home to face the Arizona Cardinals on Nov. 10.\n\nNEXT STEPS\n\nHost Panthers in London on Sunday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "There are plenty of reasons why the Tampa Bay Buccaneers have a losing record through five games, none more glaring than a struggling secondary that coach Bruce Arians says is not nearly physical enough for his taste.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Fred Goodall"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/06/buccaneers_saints_football_88629_c0-162-3885-2427_s1770x1032.jpg?652b991c80d0d630d223e05a661c82c543a6e702", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
