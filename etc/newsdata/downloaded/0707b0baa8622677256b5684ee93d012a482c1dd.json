Green Activists Demand Early Cleaning", "language": "en", "text": "Since time immemorial, the rivers of north India have been regarded as not only the lifeline of the people residing in the adjoining areas but also very sacred in their religious and cultural beliefs. Yamuna, which passes through Delhi and Agra, is among the most prominent but Green activists have gathered along the banks of the river to demand its early cleaning.\n\nThe reason? The banks of the river withstood a tragedy barely 10 days ago when hundreds of people on a pilgrimage (Braj Yatra) were swept away while crossing the river in a pontoon bridge. The fragile plastic rope they were holding on to didn't prove strong enough and many began to drown after a virtual stampede, news agency IANS reported.\n\nThough all the pilgrims were saved from drowning, many of them gulped down the toxic river water as they attempted to keep themselves afloat. While two pilgrims died later, hundreds had to be hospitalised and some of them are still under treatment at private hospitals.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE IMAGE.

Earlier, there had been cases of only animals falling sick after consuming the toxic water.\n\nDon't Miss 2.7 K SHARES 18.5 K SHARES 18.6 K SHARES 12.1 K SHARES 2.6 K SHARES\n\nThe state government, however, has denied the charges of negligence and of failing to prevent pilgrims from crossing the Yamuna.\n\n\"These pilgrims on a yatra tried to cross the river Yamuna on the Palwal-Aligarh border, holding on to a fragile rope that did not prove strong and many drowned after a stampede. Hundreds lost control and took sips of the polluted water,\" an activist told IANS on Monday.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE IMAGE. BCCL\n\n\"An alarm was raised and scores were hospitalised in Mathura, Vrindavan, Kosi and Naujheel for treatment. So far, two have died, many are still critical. The district administration and the police should be taken to task for allowing devotees to cross the river, when dangers were staring at the face,\" he said.\n\nMore than 20 pilgrims are still in a serious state. An organiser of the yatra, led by Padma Shri Ramesh Baba of Barsana, accused officials of the Haryana government, who had failed to repair the pontoon bridge in time.\n\nReports claimed that a plastic rope tied to tractors on both sides of the river was provided to support pilgrims for wading through the river.\n\n\"People of short height could not prevent water from entering their mouths. When one pilgrim was seen drowning, a number of them ran to rescue him. This resulted in a stampede,\" a source said.\n\nWhat is shocking for locals is the apparent apathy of the administration.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE IMAGE. BCCL\n\n\"Today (Tuesday) being Yama Dwitiya, thousands of pilgrims will come for the special Yamuna bath,\" the source added.\n\nNeither the Yogi Adityanath government in Uttar Pradesh nor the local MP Hema Malini have addressed this problem of river pollution, despite repeated demands and assurances, agitated locals said.\n\nThe stink from the river causes nausea and puts off the visitors who choose to return to their hotels and dharamshalas for the ritual bath.\n\n\u201cThe river is already dead in Vrindavan,\u201d declares Jagan Nath Poddar of the Friends of Vrindavan forum. With hardly any fresh water flowing, the stink at the ghats and the heaps of garbage are proving a nightmarish experience, the locals added.\n\nWith IANS Inputs", "description": "Since time immemorial, the rivers of north India have been regarded as not only the lifeline of the people residing in the adjoining areas but also very sacred in their religious and cultural beliefs.
