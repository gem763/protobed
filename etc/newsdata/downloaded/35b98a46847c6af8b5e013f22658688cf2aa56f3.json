That and more in Trysta Krick's Week 7 overreactions. USA TODAY\n\nARLINGTON, Texas \u2014 What Rod Marinelli meant was that his defense needed to play with more confidence and energy.\n\nWhat Marinelli meant was that his blitzing backers needed to lower their pads better, bend their knees more effectively and \u201cstop looking like deer in (headlights),\u201d defensive end DeMarcus Lawrence explained.\n\nBut what the Cowboys\u2019 70-year-old defensive coordinator said in the defense\u2019s first meeting to prepare for the Eagles this week didn\u2019t strike those vague or clich\u00e9 chords. Instead, Marinelli told the defense Wednesday: \u201cWe\u2019re going to blitz with some swagger.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe said that as soon as we got to our defensive meeting,\u201d cornerback Jourdan Lewis, who blitzed for one of Dallas\u2019 three sacks Sunday, told USA TODAY Sports. \u201cIt was pretty funny. We all had a good chuckle.\u201d\n\nCowboys defensive end Demarcus Lawrence (90) sacks Eagles quarterback Carson Wentz (11) and causes a fumble in the first quarter at AT&T Stadium.

Swagger was exactly what the defense embodied. They set the tone in the game\u2019s first drive.\n\nOnly 1:42 had elapsed when Eagles quarterback Carson Wentz found tight end Dallas Goedert on an 8-yard dart up the middle. But as Goedert turned downfield, he was cornered by Cowboys linebackers Jaylon Smith and Leighton Vander Esch. Smith stripped Goedert on his way down. Defensive tackle Maliek Collins dove for the recovery. For the first time in seven weeks, the Cowboys offense began a drive in opponent territory. They scored on a 20-yard Tavon Austin run six plays later. They\u2019d find the end zone again after Lawrence strip-sacked Wentz on the next drive.\n\nAfter scoring three points in the first half of the last three games combined, the Cowboys compiled more points in six minutes than they would allow the Eagles all night.\n\n\u201cOn primetime, we went out there and got our asses kicked,\u201d Goedert said. \u201cSo, that\u2019s pretty embarrassing.\u201d\n\nEagles coach Doug Pederson agreed.\n\nPederson had told a Philadelphia radio station Monday his team would win in Dallas to overtake the NFC East. Lawrence retorted Friday that Pederson should shut up, adding after the Cowboys\u2019 win: \u201cI told him to shut up, didn\u2019t I? What do you think he\u2019s doing now?\u201d Pederson admitted after the loss that he was humbled. If it wasn\u2019t the worst loss of his career, the Super Bowl-winning coach said, \u201cit\u2019s either one or two.\u201d\n\nFor the Cowboys, it was the end of three.\n\nRather than enter their bye week on a four-game losing streak, the Cowboys\u2019 first win in a month will help them move past poor performances against the Packers and Jets. A defense with uncharacteristically bad tackling in the three-game skid contained Eagles runners more effectively, allowed just three conversions on nine third-down attempts and recorded a season-high four takeaways. After each takeaway, quarterback Dak Prescott told himself: \u201cWe have to go turn these into points.\u201d\n\nAnd they did.\n\nCoaches scripted Austin\u2019s 20-yarder after the first fumble recovery. Running back Ezekiel Elliott soared over fullback Jamize Olawale\u2019s block for a second post-recovery touchdown. When a snap bounced off Wentz\u2019s chest in the fourth quarter, Cowboys defensive end Kerry Hyder recovered. Three plays later, Prescott faked a pass to Elliott then scrambled 8 yards into the endzone.\n\nFor third time tonight, Cowboys convert fumble recovery (Kerry Hyder this time) for rushing TD (Dak Prescott this time).\n\n\n\nIn the process, Dak passes Roger Staubach for franchise record with 21 career rushing TDspic.twitter.com/F0rD4SCLav \u2014 Jori Epstein (@JoriEpstein) October 21, 2019\n\n\u201cThe defense was playing their butt off, making turnovers and giving us a chance on short fields,\u201d said Prescott, whose 21st career rushing touchdown broke Roger Staubach\u2019s franchise record. \u201cThen it was our time to compliment them and tell them thank you by putting six points on the board. Being able to do that is just great complementary football from this team.\u201d\n\nThe Cowboys' offense featured a balanced attack with 189 yards rushing and 239 passing. Elliott traversed 111 yards on the ground. Star receiver Amari Cooper had 106 by air.\n\n\u201cMan,\u201d Cooper said after his five-catch day, \u201cif I can ball out the same game that Zeke balls out, we\u2019ll never lose.\u201d\n\nWith 15 days until they face the Giants on Monday Night Football, they can first focus on their success in disproving Pederson\u2019s assurance.\n\nLawrence insisted they would before the game. After Dallas moved into the division lead, Marinelli credited his defensive captain\u2019s leadership and bold words.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been around guys like that, (Warren) Sapp,\u201d Marinelli told USA TODAY Sports. \u201cThat\u2019s what they bring. The confidence. It\u2019s not false chatter. It\u2019s not elevator music. It\u2019s inside of you.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what Marinelli said of Lawrence and the Cowboys, anyway.\n\nWhat he meant: Against the Eagles, this team showed swagger.\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Jori Epstein on Twitter @JoriEpstein.\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.
