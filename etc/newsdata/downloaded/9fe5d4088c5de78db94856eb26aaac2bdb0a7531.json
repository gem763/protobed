But markets and economists have struggled to interpret the mixed signals sent by ECB officials in recent weeks, with cacophony rising ahead of what will be Mario Draghi\u2019s last significant meeting as ECB president. According to most analysts, the ECB could cut its already-negative key rate further, embark on a new asset-buying program, and/or make its current long-term refinancing facility more favorable for eurozone banks.\n\nPoint No.1: Hawks rising. Draghi said in July that the central bank was considering all options to fight a slump that threatens to worsen due to the many uncertainties hanging over the world economy. Since then, the \u201chawks\u201d \u2014 eurozone central bankers who have been skeptical of or opposed monetary loosening \u2014 have become more vocal. Led by Germany\u2019s Jens Weidmann, the Bundesbank president, they are now arguing that the current situation doesn\u2019t demand a massive new monetary-policy easing plan. Draghi, on the other hand, has insisted that inflation expectations in the eurozone are showing that markets don\u2019t believe in the ECB\u2019s capacity to reach its (only) official goal of staying at the \u201cbelow but close to 2%\u201d level. It currently stands at an annual 1%. The ECB president has also pointed out that current uncertainties weighing on economic activity \u2014 the threat of trade and currency wars, the slowdown in emerging markets, or Brexit \u2014 are already by themselves contributing to the slowdown.\n\nMarket Extra: The ECB decision is coming \u2014 here\u2019s what to expect\n\nPoint No. 2: Cacophony spreading. Besides the traditional hawks becoming more vocal, a new cacophony emerging among the monetary union\u2019s policy makers has muddled the ECB\u2019s message. That may be because Draghi\u2019s term expires on Oct. 31, and the eurozone\u2019s national central bankers already don\u2019t feel bound by the same discretion they used to show when the Italian was clearly running the show. Finland\u2019s Olli Rehn said last month that the ECB was preparing a \u201csignificant and impactful\u201d package that would include \u201csubstantial and sufficient\u201d bond buying. On the other hand, France\u2019s Fran\u00e7ois Villeroy de Galhau expressed skepticism earlier this month on the need to resume bond buying at the moment. It was unclear whether either was expressing a personal preference or laying out the ECB party line. But it is a sign that Draghi\u2019s successor, Christine Lagarde, may have to struggle to bring coherence to the central bank\u2019s message, with a 25-strong ECB governing council that includes the 19 member states\u2019 central bankers.\n\nPoint No. 3: Markets doubting. No wonder that markets are now wondering whether the ECB\u2019s package will be forceful enough to alleviate fears about the euro, which might strengthen if the plan is deemed too timid by investors. The common currency is down 3% against the dollar USDEUR, -0.0668% and up 1% against the pound GBPEUR, +0.0268% (due to Brexit concerns) since the beginning of the year. A stronger currency would hinder the ECB\u2019s stated goal of boosting inflation, because it would make imported goods cheaper. Prices have risen so little in the eurozone in the last four years, with the central bank constantly missing its target, that some economists are now suggesting it should openly adopt a \u201csymmetrical\u201d approach to inflation targeting \u2014 i.e., explicitly announce that it is now aiming much higher than 2% on a temporary basis. After all, the ECB\u2019s price target is supposed to be set for the \u201cmedium term.\u201d\n\nPoint No. 4: Governments diddling. Draghi will undoubtedly yet again call for eurozone governments to do their (fiscal) part to fight the slowdown, in the form of public spending by countries that can afford it, such as Germany and the Netherlands. His appeals are likely to fall on deaf ears, as they have for the past two years, in spite of the fact that Germany, the EU\u2019s economic laggard this year alongside Italy, is flirting with recession. Berlin is only considering the limited fiscal stimulus allowed by its stringent debt and deficit rules, but that would come after a recession or a serious slump has happened, not before. The incapacity or refusal of European governments to do more for their economies, coupled with stalled attempts at eurozone reform, should give ECB \u201cdoves\u201d more argument to act. Knowing that what they decide Thursday will in any case be judged too little for some and too much for the others.\n\nRead on: Trump attacks \u2018boneheads\u2019 at Fed and warns terrorists on 9/11 anniversary", "description": "The central bank will announce a new package of monetary easing on Thursday amid conflicting fears it may overreach \u2014 or be too timid.", "authors": ["Pierre Brian\u00e7on", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HH289_draghi_ZG_20190410084951.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
