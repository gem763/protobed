I fully believe it.\n\n\u201cI have not seen a single salmon in a river so far. The bears are starving, and it breaks my heart, seeing this unfold.\n\n\u201cI believe it is important to show this side too. Here in the Broughton is no salmon left for the bears (and whales I must assume?).\n\n\u201cAdvertising still shows the happy bears feasting on salmon, well, sorry to say - not here.\n\n\u201cWe saw this sow with her two little ones a couple of weeks ago, and then we saw her again only a few days ago.\n\n\u201cI have no idea how she would make it through the winter without salmon.\n\n\u201cI sure prefer to show you beautiful nice wildlife and nature pictures, but it is important and my duty as a photographer to show you this side too.\n\n\u201cWe have to protect wild BC salmon - NOW.\u201d\n\nThe area is a haven for bear watching with tourists from around the world flocking to the area to see grizzlies in the wild.\n\nThe Mamalilikulla First Nation has been monitoring the animals in the region for several years.\n\nJake Smith, guardian watchman manager for the Mamalilikulla First Nation, told CNN. \u201cThe bears are in trouble.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey have drastically changed within a couple of months.\u201d\n\nMr Smith arranged for 500 salmon, donated by A-Tlegay Fisheries Society on Vancouver Island, to be spread along the shorelines that the grizzlies frequent.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nHe said the bears started eating the fish right away.\n\n\u201cWe were about 30 feet away from them,\u201d Mr Smith said.\n\n\u201cA little grizzly looked up at us, and the mother bear came out to get the fish.\u201d\n\nAccording to a report published in August by the Fisheries and Oceans Canada, the country\u2019s climate is warming twice as fast as the global average impacting salmon\u2019s ecosystems.\n\nThe research also blames marine heatwaves, increased floods and droughts as causing significant stress on the fish.\n\nOpen-net fish farming is also affecting the wild salmon population spreading disease and pollution in the water, according to critics.\n\nJoy Thorkelson, president of the United Fishermen and Allied Workers\u2019\n\nUnion, said: \u201cThe impacts of this climate change disaster has been coast wide.\u201d\n\nMore than half of Canada\u2019s grizzly population lives in British Columbia, and their average weight is 15 to 62 stones, according to the Nature Conservancy of Canada.", "description": "WARNING - DISTRESSING IMAGES: Bones and and muscle are visible through the emaciated bear's fur as salmon becomes scarce", "authors": ["Christopher Bucktin", "Image", "Rolf Hicker", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20433484.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-Bear.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
