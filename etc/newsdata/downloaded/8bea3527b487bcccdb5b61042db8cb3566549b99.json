To some, it was a creative tactic from desperate residents. For others, it was a declaration of hostility to the homeless \u2014 a Band-Aid measure in a city where their plight has drawn national scrutiny and where shelters still can\u2019t meet demand. The homeless count in San Francisco jumped 17 percent from 2017 to this year as rents and real estate prices continue to skyrocket and as the Trump administration considers an intervention in California.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOpponents rolled the rocks into the street overnight; city workers put them back; people rolled them out again. Protesters gathered Sunday, while residents called a meeting and said they faced harassment.\n\nBy last weekend, the boulders were exposing just how high tensions are running amid a city homelessness crisis that years of policy proposals have done little to dent. They\u2019d become a \u201csymbol,\u201d said Danielle Baskin, a San Francisco artist who walks through Clinton Park on her way to work and whose Twitter account now identifies her as an \u201cAnti-Rock Agitator.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey shine lights \u2014 not just to people in San Francisco but to thousands of people in the country \u2014 that the housing crisis is a serious problem, if people are fighting over rocks,\u201d Baskin told The Washington Post.\n\nAD\n\nBaskin, who joined the dispute with an attempt to sell the rocks on Craigslist, became deluged with Twitter and Facebook messages from people interested in bringing the boulders down. She\u2019s still working her way through all the emails she has received.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cPeople are pretty fascinated at what\u2019s going on in San Francisco,\u201d she said. \u201cThis situation of extreme wealth disparity and homelessness is sort of on the rise everywhere. And it\u2019s just the worst in San Francisco.\u201d\n\nBREAKING: Here it is, video of the first official boulder removal from Clinton Park today.\n\n\n\nThey make a loud THUD as they fall. https://t.co/UQizhcvpCp pic.twitter.com/ZGMm69ga1r \u2014 Joe Fitz Rodriguez (@FitzTheReporter) September 30, 2019\n\nBaskin\u2019s dismay over the boulders taps into long-standing frustrations with an increasingly expensive Bay Area and tech prosperity that has left many behind. Clinton Park sits in the Mission Dolores neighborhood, home to the city\u2019s oldest building along with a median home value and condo listings that top $1 million. Real estate company Redfin estimates houses overlooking Clinton Park at more than $1 million in worth as well.\n\nAD\n\nResidents, many of whom have declined to give their names to news outlets, push back on accusations that they are overreacting to homeless campers.\n\n\u201cThis is about people yelling and screaming at 3 in the morning and openly flashing weapons,\u201d one fed-up woman told the San Francisco Chronicle. \u201cI\u2019m not rich. I\u2019m having a hard enough time making it myself. They even set up a shelf and were openly dealing drugs, and nobody was doing anything.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nReports to San Francisco\u2019s 311 service show frequent requests from Clinton Park for \u201cencampment cleanups\u201d and complaints about needles. And city officials say the concerns are valid.\n\n\u201cA neighborhood had people in tents who were literally selling drugs,\u201d San Francisco Public Works Director Mohammed Nuru told The Post. Echoing residents, he said the rocks were working \u2014 drug dealing in the area seemed to stop.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cSo we fully support the neighbors in this situation,\u201d Nuru said.\n\nPublic Works employees said last week that the boulders will remain in place, as they do not violate city codes and left a walkway.\n\nBut activists had other ideas. For them, the boulders are part of a worrying phenomenon called \u201chostile architecture\u201d that makes public spaces deliberately inhospitable, often with the aim of keeping homeless people away. Critics have noted \u201canti-homeless\u201d design choices around San Francisco, including spiked planter boxes and benches that fold up overnight; cities nationwide try to ward off campers with controversial tactics such as removing public seating or even blaring the song \u201cBaby Shark\u201d on a loop.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cFour thousand dollars to just dump their rocks on the street,\u201d Baskin said, referencing the total raised by a now-defunct GoFundMe page documented in screen shots. \u201cIt was pretty upsetting to me and seemed very disrespectful of another human being.\u201d\n\nDaniel Bartosiewicz, who said he camped in Clinton Park for two months, lamented to NBC Bay Area that none of the neighbors talked to him about their concerns.\n\n\u201cThey would have saved a lot of money and a lot of trouble if they just said something to us,\u201d he said. \u201cUse your compassion and love and understanding. We\u2019re humans.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to local media outlets, a neighbor who recalled struggles with feces smeared around houses said she\u2019d tried to shoo some campers away.\n\nAD\n\nHomeless, living in a tent and employed\n\nAs news of the Clinton Park rocks spread, a resistance formed. On Friday evening, police responded to a report of about 30 bicyclists rolling the boulders onto the street, spokesman Adam Lobsinger said. When officers arrived, the bikers were gone and there was no crime to investigate, he said, given that the rocks\u2019 owners were unclear.\n\nAD\n\nThat was just the start of the anti-boulder campaign.\n\nPeople gathered in the middle of the night to knock the rocks out of place and wear down a city eager to avoid traffic obstructions. A friend of Baskin\u2019s took the rocks\u2019 measurements, interested in using wood to turn them into a bench. Some people tried to cart the boulders away in a truck, Baskin said; she said she did not participate and declined to name those involved but described chipping in for the vehicle rental.\n\nAD\n\nThe growing attention to the boulders has reportedly alarmed residents. One video that circulated on Twitter with the caption \u201cHow the Clinton Park folks reacted to their boulders getting moved again\u201d shows a man yelling for people to leave.\n\n\u201cThe cops are already on their way,\u201d he shouts. (San Francisco police said Friday\u2019s bicyclist incident was their only record of a call involving Clinton Park boulders).\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe traded criminals for activists and the media,\u201d one unnamed resident told the San Francisco Chronicle. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to feel the fire anymore.\"\n\nOpponents were ready to move rocks as many nights as they had to until officials gave in, Baskin said, even gathering Sunday for a small protest with signs. Then, on Monday, they got their wish.\n\nAD\n\nNuru said the request to remove the boulders came from the residents who put them up \u2014 worried now not just about the sidewalks but about \u201cthreatening\u201d emails they had received. The residents want the source of the controversy gone while they \u201cregroup and figure out what\u2019s next,\u201d he said.\n\nThat next step could be some sort of landscaping, he said. One option: heavier boulders.\n\n\u201cThe problem is they were not big enough,\u201d Nuru told the San Francisco Examiner on Monday.\n\nAD\n\nSaying the city is working to expand both temporary and permanent solutions to homelessness, Nuru told The Post he thinks the rock-movers would do better to \u201cchannel their energies to do positive things.\u201d\n\nBaskin said she wishes that \u201cwe could all talk.\u201d She\u2019s planning to put out signs for a community meeting, although she does not know how many of the residents behind the rocks will be willing to show up and reveal their identities.\n\nWith the controversy still brewing, advocates who have spent years tackling San Francisco\u2019s homelessness crisis are attempting to keep the focus on underlying issues rather than a media-sucking drama.\n\n\u201cSo ask us about the boulders,\u201d the Coalition on Homelessness dared its Twitter followers this weekend. \u201cAsk us about the boulders, and we\u2019ll tell you the real story.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe issue is not the rocks.\n\n\n\nThe issue is that the City\n\n\n\n1) Does not provide sufficient housing, healthcare or even shelter for homeless folks AND THEN AT THE SAME TIME\n\n\n\n2) Makes it impossible for them to exist in public space through 26+ laws, hostile architecture, police etc \u2014 Coalition on Homelessness (@TheCoalitionSF) September 29, 2019\n\nContacted Monday about the rock debacle, Joshua Bamberger, a professor at the University of California at San Francisco who helps lead a homelessness research initiative, said he was far more interested in big-picture problems and proven solutions to the crisis afflicting his city and so many others \u2014 solutions such as \u201chousing, housing and housing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are so many streets in San Francisco where people are sleeping or uncomfortable sleeping,\u201d Bamberger said, sounding exasperated.
