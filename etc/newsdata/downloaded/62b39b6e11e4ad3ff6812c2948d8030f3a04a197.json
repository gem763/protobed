There has yet to be any evidence, though, to back up the accusation.\n\nOver the last year, illegal immigration at the U.S.-Mexico border had increased significantly, leaving federal immigration officials with increasingly less space to detain and hold migrants. In response, the Trump administration enacted a \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d policy that returns adult border crossers and the children they arrive with at the border back to Mexico while they await their asylum process.\n\nLast year, the Trump administration enforced its zero-tolerance policy to stop the flow of illegal adult border crossers from arriving at the country with minor children. The separation of adult border crossers from the children they arrive with has occurred since before 2001, court records have shown, and the Obama administration used the same detention centers that are currently being used.\n\nDetaining child border crossers was a policy during the Obama administration, and Breitbart Texas exclusively reported on the conditions in which unaccompanied minors were being packed into crowded cells and holding facilities.\n\nAs Breitbart News has noted, Health and Human Services (HHS) centers \u2014 where unaccompanied minors are often sent \u2014 feature comfortable living conditions.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.
