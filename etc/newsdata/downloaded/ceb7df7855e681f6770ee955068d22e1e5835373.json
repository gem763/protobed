In all cases ... Costco is currently overvalued,\" said Brandon Fletcher, analyst at Bernstein Research.\n\nLet's get our membership card and check out the charts and indicators.\n\nIn the daily bar chart of Costco below, we see that prices have been climbing since the late December low. Corrections to this uptrend have been shallow, short-lived or both.\n\nThis kind of price action is often seen in strong trends as any dip is viewed as an opportunity to commit more money.\n\nPrices are above the rising 50-day moving average line and the rising 200-day line. In early April the 50-day line crossed above the 200-day line for a bullish golden cross.\n\nThe daily On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line shows a steady bullish rise from December to confirm the price gains. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator has crossed to the downside to signal a take-profits sell.\n\nIn the weekly bar chart below, we see that prices have doubled the past three years. Costco is above the rising 40-week moving-average line. The weekly OBV line has been bullish the entire rise and the MACD oscillator is bullish on this longer time frame.\n\nIn the Point and Figure chart of Costco below, we see a longer-term bullish price target of $381.\n\nBottom line strategy: Traders can still go long COST or add to longs around $290. Risk below $260 with the $350 and $380 area the price targets.", "description": "Cramer and Bernstein's Fletcher differ on the retailing club.
