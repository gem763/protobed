But the main message coming out of Doha very well might have been \u201cWait \u2018til Next Year.\u201d\n\nThe Tokyo Olympics, the first that will take place without Bolt since 2000, start in less than 10 months, and the worlds provided some clues as to what\u2019s ahead - and also about the problems this sport still faces.\n\nThere were a few athletes with the star power to shine for at least a couple of days, including a pair of double gold medalists: Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, a vibrant new mom from Jamaica who established herself as the woman to beat, again, in the sprints; and Noah Lyles , the American with the silver hair who won the 200 and anchored the U.S. to a long-awaited victory in the 4x100 relay.\n\nThere were also problems aplenty for the sport that anchors the Olympic program over the final week of the games.\n\nDoping reared its head, as usual.\n\nIt came in the form of the latest developments in the long-running Russian scandal , leading to the question: Which athletes from the world\u2019s second-biggest delegation will be allowed to compete next year, and under what conditions?\n\nAnd in the form of 100-meter champion Christian Coleman\u2019s confusing, and ultimately dismissed , whereabouts case.\n\nAnd then by the sudden removal of Alberto Salazar , the famed distance coach who received a four-year doping ban based on evidence that he ran experiments with supplements and testosterone, all as a way of trying to build a stronger, better runner.\n\nOne of Salazar\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, Sifan Hassan, pulled a first-of-its-kind double, winning gold medals in the 1,500 and 10,000 meters.\n\nShe came under scrutiny, not only for associating with Salazar but for her romp in the 1,500 meters - a wire-to-wire runaway that makes her the favorite at any distance she tries next year.\n\n\u201cSadly, it is the world we live in,\u201d IAAF president Sebastian Coe said. \u201cIt is inevitable that outstanding performances, given the broader nature of trust, is permanently a question.\u201d\n\nThat wasn\u2019t Coe\u2019s only problem.\n\nThe debate about the wisdom of bringing the IAAF\u2019s biggest competition to a country that is admittedly still gearing up to host the biggest in any sport - the 2022 World Cup - haunted this event from the get-go.\n\nIt put Coe on the defensive about the thin crowds that suddenly - magically? - got much bigger toward the end, as the criticism mounted; and also about the road races run in the middle of the night in stifling conditions that sent dozens of athletes off the course and into the medical tent.\n\nBut next year in Tokyo, the weather could be even hotter .\n\nSo, consider this a warm-up for the main event.\n\nCoe said that, going into the final day, 28% of medalists in Qatar were aged 24 or under.\n\n\u201cWe have some metrics that tell us our sport is in pretty good shape,\u201d he said.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at a few of the up-and-comers about whom Coe speaks:\n\nJAPANESE RELAY MEMBERS\n\nAug. 7, 2020, will be an electric day inside the Olympic Stadium. Japan has never earned Olympic gold in the men\u2019s 4x100 relay, but the team certainly stoked some enthusiasm when it won a surprise silver in Rio de Janeiro four years ago.\n\nA foursome anchored by Hakim Sani Brown, who runs at the University of Florida, backed that up by setting a national record (37.43 seconds) to capture a bronze medal. Handoffs and teamwork are the key for Japan, which will not beat the United States on speed alone.\n\nMUTAZ BARSHIM\n\nThe biggest cheers of the Doha championships were saved for Barshim , the high jumper who was born in Doha and represents Qatar.\n\n\u201cThe Qatari Falcon\u201d sent the fans home happy, and will be a favorite in Tokyo. Hard to imagine him savoring a victory more than this one, though.\n\nSALWA EID NASER\n\nThe women\u2019s 400 stage belonged to heavy favorite Shaunae Miller-Uibo. But the 21-year-old Naser, born in Nigeria but now running for Bahrain, stole the show with a time of 48.14 seconds. The world record of 47.60 seconds has long been thought untouchable, in part because it was set by an East German in the 1980s. Maybe not now, though.\n\n\u201cAnything is possible,\u201d Naser said.\n\nWOMEN\u2019S 400 HURDLES\n\nDalilah Muhammad broke her own world record in adding a world title to her Olympic crown. Pushing her in Doha and down the road will be 20-year-old Sydney McLaughlin, who earned the silver in Doha as Muhammad held her off by .07 seconds.\n\nAnd while Muhammad\u2019s world record currently stands at 52.16 seconds, the talk in this event is that the 52-second barrier could be breakable.\n\n\u201cIt is definitely possible,\u201d Muhammad said.\n\nARMAND DUPLANTIS\n\nThe Swedish pole vaulter who lives in Louisiana and went to LSU gave defending world champion Sam Kendricks of the U.S. a run for his money. Kendricks prevailed, but not after a back-and-forth tussle that ended with Duplantis taking silver.\n\n\u201cI am young,\u201d Duplantis said. \u201cI have a lot more opportunities.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "If the goal of this year's track and field world championships was to find a fresh face, a vibrant personality, a one-of-a-kind talent to replace the mile-wide void left by Usain Bolt's absence, then consider it still a work in progress.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Eddie Pells", "Pat Graham"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/07/qatar_athletics_worlds_56185_c0-225-4910-3087_s1770x1032.jpg?9cf477d860b97a4ed0a70c60e81b8226b88c2551", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
