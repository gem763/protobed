They charge that he used his ill-gotten gains to fund a lavish lifestyle, including homes in New York City and Los Angeles, a private jet and this award-winning superyacht.\n\n\n\nThis is the second time the yacht has been up for sale since Malaysian authorities seized it from Mr. Low. In April, the Malaysian government announced that it sold the vessel to hospitality conglomerate Genting Group for US$126 million, according to a media release at the time.\n\n\n\nSince then, Genting, which operates luxury yacht charters, has been renting the \u201cTranquility\u201d out to well-heeled clients to the tune of \u20ac1.1 million (US$1.23 million) per week\u2014including model Kylie Jenner, who posted pictures on social media of herself and her entourage jumping from the top deck into the sea below. Genting Group could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\n\n\nGenting is now reportedly asking $200 million for the vessel, according to Business Insider. Mansion Global could not independently confirm the price, as an email to the brokerage was not immediately returned.\n\n\n\nExceedingly spacious, the yacht has enough rooms to accommodate 26 guests plus 31 crew. Boat-builder Oceanco originally delivered the superyacht in 2014 to a flurry of awards and accolades, including \u201cFinest New Yacht of the 2014 Monaco Yacht Show.\u201d\n\n\n\nFrom Penta: The World\u2019s Largest Superyacht Is Built to Help the Ocean\n\nThe interiors features polished marble floors and oak finishes, according to the listing with Camper & Nicholson. There\u2019s a working see-through piano in the upper saloon, a formal dining room and a fully equipped gym.\n\n\n\nA spa suite includes a sauna, hammam, experiential showers\u2014including a mini plunge pool\u2014massage room and beauty salon, the listing says.\n\n\n\nThe maze-like master suite on the upper deck has dual dressing rooms and an adjoining office with its own terrace and plunge pool.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["Beckie Strum"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-118529?size=1.452894438138479&width=1280", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
