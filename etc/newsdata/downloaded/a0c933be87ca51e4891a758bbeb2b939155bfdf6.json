Ron DeSantis. | AP Photo/ Evan Vucci Trump rescues Florida GOP fundraiser amid leadership fight\n\nTALLAHASSEE \u2014 President Donald Trump\u2019s promise to headline the Republican Party of Florida\u2019s annual fundraiser has given it a much-needed financial and emotional boost going into 2020, even as the news has laid bare divisions within the state party\u2019s leadership.\n\nThe party\u2019s scramble to land a Trump visit culminated in a political victory for Gov. Ron DeSantis on Tuesday and effectively left state GOP Chairman Joe Gruters with a title but no influence. The power play caps a monthslong effort by DeSantis to elbow the chairman out of power.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIt also ended the 24-hour drama that saw the party\u2019s Statesman\u2019s Dinner canceled due to a lack of interest, then rescheduled with a bang.\n\nOn Monday night, the party tweeted that it was canceling the Nov. 9 fundraiser. The announcement hit a party already reeling from internal shakeups and took many top officials by surprise.\n\nOne person blindsided by the tweet was DeSantis, whose team had explicitly instructed Gruters to hold off on sending a public notice that the event was canceled.\n\nBut the tweet went out anyway, just as DeSantis was personally reaching out to Trump to persuade the president to speak \u2014 and keep the event's flubbed planning out of the public eye.\n\nWhen DeSantis announced Trump\u2019s Dec. 7 visit less than 24 hours later, it was Gruters\u2019 turn to be surprised.\n\n\u201cThe governor last night said, \u2018If Joe is not going to f---ing listen, he will not be able to get anything on this,'\u201d said one GOP consultant with knowledge of the process. Gruters \u201cknew nothing this morning when this was announced.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Gruters was calling members of the Florida GOP\u2019s executive committee at 9 a.m Tuesday to do damage control on the canceled dinner \u2014 at the same time as DeSantis was taking the stage at a state Capitol press conference where he would announce Trump\u2019s visit.\n\nIn a text message, Gruters dismissed the idea that he was out of the loop.\n\n\u201cThis was the plan all along and I appreciate the governor for securing the president for what will be a very special evening,\u201d Gruters told POLITICO.\n\nHe did not respond to questions about whether he knew the Trump announcement was coming prior to DeSantis\u2019 remarks Tuesday morning.\n\nWhite House spokesperson Hogan Gidley did not immediately respond to questions about the timeline of events. A DeSantis spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nWhen Gruters signed a contract in July to hold the Statesman\u2019s Dinner at Disney\u2019s Coronado Springs Resort, he had yet to line up a keynote speaker. In the months that followed, he couldn\u2019t land his No. 1 pick: Trump.\n\n\u201cJoe said, \u2018No big deal, I\u2019m going to get Trump,\u2019\" said the GOP consultant. \u201cHe worked to get Trump for months, and sold tables to the grassroots based on that promise, but was unable to sell tables to lobbyists.\u201d\n\nAbout two weeks ago, it became clear the planning process was falling apart. Gruters asked DeSantis for help.\n\nThe governor\u2019s office reached out to Washington. The White House told DeSantis that Trump wasn\u2019t available Nov. 9, but he had two dates open in December, both of which were discussed Monday night.\n\nOn Monday, DeSantis chief of staff Shane Strum asked that the party not to cancel the Nov. 9 event. But the tweet was issued at 4:45 p.m., as DeSantis\u2019 team was hashing out details with the White House.\n\n\u201cShane was telling Gruters, saying, \u2018Do not send it out yet,\u2019\u201d said the consultant familiar with the back-and-forth. \u201cHe said 'hold on,' but it went out anyway.\u201d\n\nAfter the news of Trump\u2019s pending visit broke Tuesday morning, the Republican Party of Florida sent an email to members that heaped praise on DeSantis. The note came not from Gruters, but the party\u2019s executive director, Peter O\u2019Rourke.\n\n\u201cUnder the great leadership of Governor DeSantis, we will secure victory for the President and will rally support for all our GOP candidates on the ballot,\u201d O\u2019Rourke wrote in the email, a copy of which was obtained by POLITICO. \u201cFlorida is an important state and we will work together with Governor DeSantis to ensure that we Republicans are successful in delivering the necessary outcomes to the great benefit of Florida and our country.\u201d", "description": "The party\u2019s scramble to land a Trump visit culminated in a political victory for Gov.
