(SGX:BBW) Should Consider This, First", "language": "en", "text": "Dividend paying stocks like Azeus Systems Holdings Ltd. (SGX:BBW) tend to be popular with investors, and for good reason - some research suggests a significant amount of all stock market returns come from reinvested dividends. Unfortunately, it's common for investors to be enticed in by the seemingly attractive yield, and lose money when the company has to cut its dividend payments.\n\nIn this case, Azeus Systems Holdings likely looks attractive to investors, given its 4.0% dividend yield and a payment history of over ten years. We'd guess that plenty of investors have purchased it for the income. There are a few simple ways to reduce the risks of buying Azeus Systems Holdings for its dividend, and we'll go through these below.\n\nClick the interactive chart for our full dividend analysis\n\nSGX:BBW Historical Dividend Yield, October 22nd 2019 More\n\nPayout ratios\n\nDividends are usually paid out of company earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. So we need to form a view on if a company's dividend is sustainable, relative to its net profit after tax. In the last year, Azeus Systems Holdings paid out 50% of its profit as dividends. This is a middling range that strikes a nice balance between paying dividends to shareholders, and retaining enough earnings to invest in future growth. One of the risks is that management reinvests the retained capital poorly instead of paying a higher dividend.\n\nAnother important check we do is to see if the free cash flow generated is sufficient to pay the dividend. Last year, Azeus Systems Holdings paid a dividend while reporting negative free cash flow. While there may be an explanation, we think this behaviour is generally not sustainable.\n\nWith a strong net cash balance, Azeus Systems Holdings investors may not have much to worry about in the near term from a dividend perspective.\n\nConsider getting our latest analysis on Azeus Systems Holdings's financial position here.\n\nDividend Volatility\n\nOne of the major risks of relying on dividend income, is the potential for a company to struggle financially and cut its dividend. Not only is your income cut, but the value of your investment declines as well - nasty. Azeus Systems Holdings has been paying dividends for a long time, but for the purpose of this analysis, we only examine the past 10 years of payments. The dividend has been cut by more than 20% on at least one occasion historically. During the past ten-year period, the first annual payment was HK$0.026 in 2009, compared to HK$0.21 last year. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 23% a year over that time. Azeus Systems Holdings's dividend payments have fluctuated, so it hasn't grown 23% every year, but the CAGR is a useful rule of thumb for approximating the historical growth.\n\nIt's not great to see that the payment has been cut in the past. We're generally more wary of companies that have cut their dividend before, as they tend to perform worse in an economic downturn.\n\nDividend Growth Potential\n\nWith a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to evaluate if earnings per share (EPS) are growing - it's not worth taking the risk on a dividend getting cut, unless you might be rewarded with larger dividends in future. In the last five years, Azeus Systems Holdings's earnings per share have shrunk at approximately 7.5% per annum. Declining earnings per share over a number of years is not a great sign for the dividend investor. Without some improvement, this does not bode well for the long term value of a company's dividend.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Dividend paying stocks like Azeus Systems Holdings Ltd.
