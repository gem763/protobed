The Pixel Buds add more battery life and are true wireless earbuds, coming in at $179.\n\nThe new Pixel Buds come in a larger, egg-shaped case versus the flatter case of its predecessor (which proved to be the source of many irksome problems).\n\nGoogle says with the new Pixel Buds \u201cthe experience comes to you\u201d \u2014 hands-free access to the Google assistant means you don\u2019t have to turn to your phone. Just say \u201cHey Google\u201d to ask the Assistant for whatever you need and then you can resume whatever you were doing. Apple similarly added hands-free access to Siri earlier this year.\n\nThe Pixel Buds\u2019 long-range Bluetooth connection makes it so they can be used even when your phone isn\u2019t with you. Inside, the Pixel Buds can stay connected up to three rooms away, and outside, up to a football field away, according to Google. The Pixel Buds pair with your Pixel phone and other Android 6.0+ devices with a single tap, and can also pair with Bluetooth 4.0+ laptops, tablets and iOS devices.\n\n#PixelBuds give you instant access to the Google Assistant. Just say \"Hey Google,\" to get directions, send a text or email, and even translate foreign languages.

According to Google, it scanned thousands of ears to create a design that would be comfortable for as many people as possible. And these tiny buds pack five hours of continuous battery life on a single charge, and up to 24 hours of battery life using the case.\n\nA new hybrid design is meant to address all sorts of sound issues \u2014 while the ear tips do seal the ear to emphasize audio when you\u2019re listening to a call or music, a vent on the bottom lets through environmental sound. And the buds respond to your surroundings with adaptive sound, and will automatically raise and lower the volume depending on the environment you\u2019re in.\n\nWhen you\u2019re making calls, the two microphones in each Pixel Bud focus on your voice, while Google says a built-in accelerometer that can detect speech through jaw vibration should ensure that you can be heard in less than ideal conditions, like while exercising or when outside on a windy day. Speaking of which, they\u2019re also sweat and water resistant.\n\nA hint at what could be included in Pixel Buds 2 was spotted back in February on Twitter, when Google senior VP Hiroshi Lockheimer appeared to have outlined a checklist for what to expect in the next iteration of the company\u2019s earbuds. And, well, we got some of them?\n\nWish list for the perfect pair of truly wireless buds:\n\n\n\n\u2714\ufe0f Great sound quality, latest codecs\n\n\u2714\ufe0f 10+ hours before needing a charge\n\n\u2714\ufe0f A case that fits in tight pockets, USB-C\n\n\u2714\ufe0f Sweat-proof for workouts\n\n\u2714\ufe0f Intuitive, tactile buttons\n\n\u2714\ufe0f Auto mutes when someone is talking to me \u2014 Hiroshi Lockheimer (@lockheimer) February 24, 2019\n\nThis isn\u2019t Google\u2019s first attempt at earbuds. The original Pixel Buds came out in 2017, and were filled with persistent annoyances which made the experience of using them, well, not great. The charging case was a struggle both to close and position the buds just right for charging. The touch controls allowed for too many errant taps, and certain basic tap controls were missing. And they weren\u2019t actually wireless since they\u2019re attached with a connecting cable.\n\nThe Google Pixel Buds will be available next year in the US at $179, and will come in four colors: Clearly White, Oh So Orange, Quite Mint and Almost Black.\n\nDeveloping.
