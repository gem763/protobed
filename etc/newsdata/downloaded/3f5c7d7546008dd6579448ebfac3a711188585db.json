He then fled the scene, driving west on the highway while shooting at people on foot and in vehicles.\n\nHe appeared to fire randomly at the pedestrians and drivers he encountered.\n\n[Among the Texas shooting victims: A high-school student, a beloved uncle and a father of two]\n\nAmong the victims was Edwin Peregrino, 25, slain on his parents\u2019 front lawn in Odessa. According to his older sister, Peregrino heard gunshots and ran outside to investigate. He was killed as the gunman sped past.\n\nAnother victim, 15-year-old Leilah Hernandez, was out shopping for a truck with her parents and brother when she was killed. Joseph Griffith, 40, was shot and killed while waiting at a traffic light with his wife and two children.\n\n\u201cThis maniac pulled up next to him and shot him, took away his life, murdered my baby brother. Like nothing,\u201d said Carla Byrne, Griffith\u2019s older sister. \u201cWe are so broken.\u201d\n\nAt one point, Ator hijacked a U.S. Postal Service van in Odessa, killing driver Mary Granados.\n\nAfter a chaotic several minutes, police pursued Ator to the parking lot of the Cinergy movie theater in Odessa, where he exchanged fire with officers and was killed. On Sunday, officials suggested that he might have been planning to continue his attack at the theater.\n\nSkyler Flores, 22, was inside the theater when the shootout occurred. She said moviegoers were evacuated from the back of the theater and into an open field, then told to get down onto the dirt.\n\n\u201cIt felt insane,\u201d Flores said.\n\n[Texas shooter hijacked a U.S. postal service truck and sped down the highway]\n\nInvestigators are searching for a motive in the shooting. Ator lost his job on the day of the attack, but investigators do not necessarily view that as the motivation, said one official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the ongoing investigation.\n\nThey are exploring whether Ator\u2019s mental health might have played a role, the official said. It was not immediately clear whether Ator had a diagnosed condition. He previously had been charged with criminal trespass and evading arrest, according to a public records search, plus two traffic misdemeanors.\n\nAt a Sunday news conference, Odessa Police Chief Michael Gerke said officials are investigating how the shooter acquired his weapon.\n\nGerke declined to identify Ator by name. \u201cI am not naming the subject,\u201d Gerke said at the news conference held at the University of Texas of the Permian Basin on Sunday. \u201cI refuse to. I am not going to give him any notoriety.\u201d\n\nHe said officials don\u2019t think this was an act of domestic terrorism.\n\nThe police chief also refused to describe a timeline of events. \u201cIt\u2019s a very chaotic situation,\u201d he said, that is \u201call being pieced together.\u201d Police and FBI officers are investigating at least 15 crime scenes. Amid the mayhem, the Midland Police Department warned about two possible shooters. Officials said that error was caused by the gunman switching vehicles.\n\nAmong those injured were at least three police officers and 17-month-old Anderson Davis, who was hit in the chest by shrapnel. Family members say she has a hole in her lower lip and tongue and that her front teeth were knocked out. The child is in stable condition, according to Hailey Wilkerson, a friend of the family.\n\n\u201cShe did come out of surgery and she is doing great, and they may let her go home today,\u201d Wilkerson said. She said the child\u2019s mother is \u201cstill in shock.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re an amazing family. You don\u2019t ever think something like this will happen to somebody you know personally,\u201d Wilkerson said. \u201cAll they want was for their baby to be better.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnderson Davis, 17 months, is recovering after being shot. (Courtesy of the Davis family)\n\nOn Saturday, Odessa and Midland were gripped by fear. By Sunday, the mood had shifted from anxiety to mourning. Across the state, flags were lowered to half-staff. In Odessa, neighbors donated blood and restaurants offered free meals to first responders.\n\nOn Sunday night, about 1,000 people gathered for a prayer vigil at the university, including Odessa Mayor David Turner and Midland Mayor Jerry Morales. The spot was near one of the intersections where shots were fired.\n\nTurner thanked the first responders and ensured the crowd that both cities are doing everything they can to ensure residents\u2019 safety. He confirmed that Permian Basin law enforcement officials were working 15 scenes on Saturday. \u201cAt that time, we saw the very worst of humanity, but we also saw the best \u2026 as citizens ran into danger to help their fellow man.\u201d\n\nMorales told the crowd that Midland and Odessa had shown that they could come together and that Midland was there to provide support. \u201cWe are one \u2026 we are Permian strong!\u201d he said before leading the crowd in the Lord\u2019s Prayer.\n\nSeveral clergy members from various faiths led prayers in English and Spanish.\n\nSeveral hundred people stood in line to get #PermianStrong T-shirts that were being made by art students at the university. \u201cThis was our response to the last 24 hours of tragedy,\u201d professor Chris Stanley told The Washington Post.\n\nSaturday\u2019s mass shooting was Texas\u2019s second during August. A gunman killed 22 people and injured dozens in a massacre at a shopping area in El Paso on Aug. 3.\n\nAt Sunday\u2019s news conference, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) made a reference to the El Paso attack and other mass shootings that have rocked the state in recent years. In 2017, 26 people were killed by a gunman at a Baptist church in Sutherland Springs, the deadliest mass shooting in Texas history. He also mentioned a school shooting in Santa Fe and a 2016 shooting of police officers in Dallas.\n\n\u201cThe status quo in Texas is unacceptable,\u201d he said Sunday. \u201cAction is needed.\u201d\n\n1 of 20 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 The scene after a gunman shoots over 20 people in Odessa, Tex.
