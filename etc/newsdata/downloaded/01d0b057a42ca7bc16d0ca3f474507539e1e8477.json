Ben Gilbert/Business Insider\n\nIt might sound like bad news, but it's actually an important part of GameStop's effort to reboot \u2014 the company is shoring up operating expenses and other needless expenditures as it attempts to stay afloat.\n\n\"If they close 200 stores this year, operating expenses should drop by $20 million next year,\" Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter told Business Insider in an email last week. But that's not all: The company is expecting to close a \"much larger\" group of stores in the next one to two years, according to Bell.\n\nRead more: GameStop's new CEO and CFO reveal their plan to repair the company's decimated stock price after a brutal year in which hundreds of millions of dollars in value were wiped out\n\nThe initial wave of closures, he said, are \"opportunistic,\" whereas the next wave of closures will come from a deeper look at each store and its region.\n\n\"We are applying a more definitive, analytic approach, including profit levels and sales transferability, that we expect will yield a much larger tranche of closures over the coming 12 to 24 months,\" Bell said on last Tuesday's investor call.\n\nA first look at where some of those stores closures are likely to happen comes from Thinknum, which did a proximity analysis of the retailer's worldwide footprint. It found some pretty stark metrics:\n\nOn average, there are two other GameStop locations within five miles of any given store.\n\nThat average grows to six locations within 10 miles of any given store.\n\nAt one Manhattan store, there are a whopping 35 other stores within just five miles.\n\nThat density problem applies to GameStop's locations all over the US, from Florida to California, according to the Thinknum analysis.\n\nAs we learned on a tour of New York City-area GameStop stores this summer, there are a staggering number of locations in the five boroughs. There's a good reason for that: GameStop grew largely by mergers and acquisitions, primarily of other video game retailers. As GameStop grew it store count, it increased its redundancies.\n\nBen Gilbert/Business Insider\n\nThe closures are the latest cost-saving measure from GameStop's new leadership team \u2014 the company has already had two waves of layoffs.\n\nUnder its new leadership team, GameStop launched an initiative known as \"GameStop Reboot\" that's intended to breathe new life into the retail chain. The first step of the reboot involves addressing issues with so-called SG & A, a financial term that stands for Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. In simpler terms: It means lowering the cost of salaries, taxes, advertising, and other nonproduction costs.\n\nUnfortunately, it also means layoffs and store closures.", "description": "If you're at a GameStop, there are likely to be another two GameStop locations within five miles.
