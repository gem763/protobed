Brian Bledsoe doesn\u2019t know, but he understands that change is coming. Automation could mean the end of jobs like his, and Republicans have a chance to help millions of workers who could soon need help.\n\nBrian is a truck driver living near Dallas. He got behind his first big-rig wheel in the mid-2000s, after serving in the Army. He quickly took to it, telling my organization, Heritage Action for America, that he \u201csat in the driver\u2019s seat and didn\u2019t look back.\u201d\n\nBrian is not alone: About 3.5 million people worked as truck drivers last year. As recently as five years ago, it was the most common job in 29 states, including eight of the 10 most populous.\n\nTechnological advances will increasingly threaten these jobs. UPS recently experimented with autonomous delivery vehicles between Phoenix and Tucson, Arizona, as well as a longer route from Phoenix to Dallas. Last month, in Virginia, the auto manufacturer Daimler put self-driving trucks on some public roads. The federal government also gave $15 million to a Virginia group to research how best to incorporate autonomous trucks into the infrastructure system.\n\nHuman beings likely won't fill the growing demand for truck shipping\n\nThese advances are being spurred, in part, by the shipping industry\u2019s growing needs. Truck freight tonnage is expected to rise by more than a quarter over the next decade, yet there\u2019s already a shortage of more than 60,000 drivers, according to the American Trucking Associations. If necessity is the mother of invention, then trucking companies will continue to look for alternative ways to fill the worker gap. Automation is the logical choice.\n\nHe knows the nature of work is changing: Andrew Yang gets why Donald Trump won. He won't be president but he deserves attention.\n\nBrian keeps a watchful yet concerned eye on these developments. A free-market conservative who volunteers with Heritage Action, he believes that innovation benefits customers. But he also knows that many of his fellow truck drivers aren\u2019t prepared for a future when their jobs won\u2019t exist, saying that most of them \u201cwill be up a creek without a paddle.\u201d\n\nTruck stop (Photo: Pete Aster/The Daily Chronicle via AP)\n\nWhile he guesses that a driverless future could be anywhere from 15 to 30 years away, he urges younger drivers to \u201cstart developing other skills now,\u201d while they still can.\n\nThis is good advice, and not just for truck drivers. Recent estimates put 25% of U.S. jobs at high risk of automation.\n\nThe loss of good paying jobs is a palpable fear for people of all political stripes. Polling conducted by Heritage Action found that 82% of Americans believe that a significant number of jobs and careers won\u2019t exist in 10 years due to automation, as well as outsourcing. We also found that nearly 90% of Americans, including clear majorities of Republicans, Democrats and independents, support putting a renewed emphasis on job training programs. The question for Republicans is how to promote job training that works.\n\nReams of research show that federal job training programs fail to deliver meaningful results while costing a significant amount. Surveying decades of evidence, the White House Council of Economic Advisers concluded this year that such programs are \u201clargely ineffective.\u201d Yet according to the same analysis, \u201cstudies consistently\u2026 show\u201d that private-sector training is effective.\n\nThis opens a door for Republican policymakers to offer creative and conservative ways to remove regulatory barriers and incentivize more business- and community-led job training programs.\n\nConservatives have to go on the offensive\n\nPresident Donald Trump has taken some praiseworthy initial steps on this front. At his direction, the Department of Labor is developing a novel private sector-driven apprenticeship program. He has also established the Workforce Advisory Board, which released in September a series of workforce proposals, including a business-led marketing campaign and better state-federal employment data sharing. Yet executive action alone is insufficient to address the growing need for workforce training. Congress, too, must rise to this challenge.\n\nOne worthy proposal is the Higher Education Reform and Opportunity Act. Introduced by Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, it would allow states to accredit new kinds of educational and training programs, such as those run by trade schools. Compared with the current one-size-fits-all federal accreditation system, this would spur the innovation needed to help people of all ages \u2014 not just the young \u2014 to obtain skills-based training. Workers facing job loss from automation may benefit the most from such bold policies.\n\nMisplaced priorities: Trade with China isn't our top economic challenge. Donald Trump should tackle automation.\n\nWorkforce development is slowly gaining traction on the Republican side of the aisle, while Democrats continue to advocate spending more money on existing programs. The evidence shows that more spending won\u2019t do much to help people like Brian Bledsoe and his fellow truck drivers. Like so many others, their industry is confronting technological disruption. To keep up and keep working, they need innovative policies that are at least as disruptive of the job training status quo.\n\nTim Chapman is the executive director of Heritage Action for America.
