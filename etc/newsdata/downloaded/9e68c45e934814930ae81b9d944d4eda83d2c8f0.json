The company blasted out of the recession, with Ford stock running up to as high as $17 in 2014. Since then, however, fate has not been so kind to Ford stock investors.\n\nFord (F) More\n\nAuto sales peaked a few years ago in North America. Meanwhile, Europe faces persistent economic weakness and the trade war has cast a huge shadow over the company\u2019s operations in China. Alarmingly, rival General Motors (NYSE:GM) has made huge inroads in that market as well.\n\nIn any case, add it all up, and Ford\u2019s stock price has been in a long steady decline. Since 2014, shares have lost nearly half their value, and with hardly any significant rallies along the way. While Ford pays a generous dividend, that hasn\u2019t been enough to make up for the stock\u2019s inexorable decline. Things may be about to take a turn for the better, however.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe Auto Market Is Heating Up\n\nWhile the auto industry is hardly booming right now, things are perking up. Look at the most recent monthly data. Thomas King, a senior VP of data analytics for JD Power, said that: \u201cStrong volumes coupled with higher average sales prices means that consumers will spend more purchasing new vehicles in August than any month in history.\u201d\n\nEncouragingly for the auto makers, the average sale price of vehicles is rising nicely as more customers buy SUVs. The extended weakness in oil prices has resulted in cheaper gasoline, and people are taking that into account when purchasing new vehicles. With Ford relying on the F-150 for so much of its profits, gas prices are a solid tailwind for the firm.\n\nTurning back to the figures, however, August numbers won\u2019t be enough to make 2019 a huge year for auto sales. JD Power and LMC Automotive are still forecasting a 1.7% decline in total light vehicle sales for 2019. But that\u2019s nearly flat, and is well ahead of some more pessimistic assessments earlier this year.\n\nF Stock\u2019s Huge Dividend\n\nIf you look at all 500 companies in the S&P 500, Ford stock currently offers the 13th-highest dividend yield of all. Its 6.54% dividend yield is only a whisker behind Dow (NYSE:DOW) at 6.61% for being the highest-yielding industrial company in the index. Nearly all of the companies that yield more than Ford are deeply troubled businesses, such as slumping oil and gas companies or struggling firms in the retail sector.\n\nF stock, by contrast, is still performing reasonably well while offering its massive yield. Given its 2018 results, Ford can easily sustain its current dividend. Earnings were double its dividend payout from last year.\n\nSimilarly, the company\u2019s cash flow after accounting for CAPEX left it enough room to pay more than twice the present dividend rate. We\u2019re not at peak auto sector profits right now either. That said, if another big recession comes around, the dividend might run into trouble; Ford had to suspend its payouts for several years during the financial crisis.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfitability a Significant Concern for Ford Stock\n\nIt\u2019s not all great news for Ford stock though. The big issue facing the firm right now is that profitability has stalled out. While the company has grown revenues by roughly half since the financial crisis, net income has barely budged. It varies from year to year but there\u2019s been little in the way of meaningful growth.\n\nFord is making a gigantic multi-billion dollar restructuring effort. Much of its focus is with international operations; the company is not earning money in various of its overseas markets. All these attempts at cost-cutting are angering some members of the labor force though. With the tight job market in the U.S. and Canada among other places, it may be difficult for Ford to save that much money by squeezing costs.\n\nTrade War Hits Profits\n\nThere\u2019s also the uncertainty of what will happen as the trade war intensifies. Through 2017, China accounted for around 20% of Ford\u2019s overall vehicle sales. This figure dropped in 2018, and will almost certainly struggle as long as the current icy relations persist.", "description": "It has been a bumpy few years for investors in Ford (NYSE:F) stock.
