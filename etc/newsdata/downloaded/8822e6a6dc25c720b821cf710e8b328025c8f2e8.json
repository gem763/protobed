He was told officials would help reunite him with his young daughter, Beatriz.\n\nSandra Chica hugs her daughter at a rally for her husband Pablo Villavicencio, who was arrested and detained in 2018 after delivering pizza to the Fort Hamilton Army Base (file image)\n\nHonduran father Victor embraces his daughter after his release from a detention center in Los Angeles after six months in ICE custody (file image)\n\nImmigrant children entertain themselves at a detention facility in McAllen, Texas on November 2018 photo (file image)\n\nHe signed them, and Jairo was deported without her. By the time Beatriz was reunited with her family, she had lost her ability to speak Mam, an indigenous Mayan language, making it nearly impossible for her to communicate with her mother.\n\nThe lawsuit also alleges physical abuse by shelter staff. The same Guatemalan girl Beatriz, had bruises on her legs and a scar on her back when she was reunited with her father, Vice reported.\n\nJorge, a migrant from Honduras, was separated from his sleeping daughter in the middle of the night and did not get a chance to say goodbye, Vice reported.\n\nHe was brought to a Customs and Border Protection processing station, and when an officer told Jorge to leave the cell, the suit claims, Jorge assumed he was being taken in for questioning. Instead, he was transferred to an ICE detention facility.\n\nAndres, a 6-year-old from Honduras, was 'torn kicking and screaming' from his father's arms, the suit claims.\n\nHis father, Jacinto, tried to tell immigration officers about his son\u2019s heart murmur during the traumatic scene. Andr\u00e9s was eventually sent to live with a foster family in New York, who he was told to call 'Mom' and 'Dad.'\n\nImmigration officers allegedly told one woman, Lorena, that she needed to sign the forms to be reunited with her teenage daughter, who\u2019d been sent to a shelter before being transferred to foster care, Vice learned. After Lorena signed the form, though, she was deported to El Salvador without her daughter, and they didn\u2019t see each other for more than a year.\n\nFamilies arrive at the Annunciation House in El Paso, Texas after being reunited (file image)\n\nFamily separations began on a large scale in early 2018 and were widely decried as inhumane. President Donald Trump ended the policy in June 2018 by executive order, and a federal judge in San Diego ordered the reunification of 2,700 children, although advocates say many more were separated.\n\nThe government carried out family separations without a reunification plan in place. Thousands of parents weren't told where their children would be placed, and the federal agency that housed the kids after they were taken didn't always know that they had traveled with a parent. Chaos ensued when parents desperate to find their children couldn't track them down. In some cases, parents were deported without their children.\n\nIn this latest suit, the ACLU wants class action status, meaning if it wins, thousands of families who are not plaintiffs can also be compensated. Attorneys didn't list a dollar amount requested, but have also filed complaints with the Department of Homeland Security that seek $3 million per family. Those complaints could be eventually tied into this lawsuit.\n\nA man from El Salvador gets reacquainted with his six-year-old daughter in July 2018 in El Paso, Texas, after spending two months separated trying to cross into the U.S. (file image)\n\n'We think that the family separations was so extreme and so unprecedented that if ever there was a case warranting damages, it\u00b4s this one,' ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt said. Gelernt said families who were separated deserve to be compensated for the trauma they suffered and that he hoped the money, if granted, would be used to get mental health assistance and so that families could 'put their lives back together.'\n\nA spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security said it doesn't comment on pending litigation.\n\nChild welfare experts have said family separation leads to lifelong trauma, especially in young children.\n\nIn one case, a Guatemalan woman and her two sons, then ages seven and eight, were separated after crossing from Mexico into Arizona in May 2018. The woman, identified in the lawsuit only as 'Ana,' didn't know where they were for three weeks, despite pleas for information.\n\nShe eventually learned they had been flown to Miami. Ana was released in early July and reunified with her kids a week later. The family, which fled gang violence and religious persecution in Guatemala, was granted asylum and lives in Florida. But the boys still struggle with trauma, the lawsuit alleges. The youngest boy can't sleep or bathe alone, and his brother acts out in anger, according to the lawsuit.", "description": "The ACLU lawsuit seeks damages for thousands of families who were separated at the border.
