Josh Hawley blasts LeBron James over 'garbage' comment on China", "language": "en", "text": "Sen. Josh Hawley, Missouri Republican, unleashed on NBA superstar LeBron James over his comment Monday that a team executive who tweeted in support of Hong Kong pro-democracy protesters \u201cwasn\u2019t educated on the situation.\u201d\n\n\u201cHaving just been in Hong Kong\u2014on the streets & with the protestors\u2014this kind of garbage is hard to take,\u201d tweeted the senator. \u201cLeBron, are YOU educated on \u2018the situation\u2019? Why don\u2019t you go to Hong Kong? Why don\u2019t you meet the people there risking their lives for their most basic liberties.\u201d\n\nThe NBA has been accused of kowtowing to China in the name of protecting the league\u2019s financial interests following a now-deleted Oct. 4 tweet by Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey that said, \u201cFight for freedom. Stand with Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nHaving just been in Hong Kong - on the streets & with the protestors - this kind of garbage is hard to take. LeBron, are YOU educated on \u201cthe situation\u201d? Why don\u2019t you go to Hong Kong? Why don\u2019t you meet the people there risking their lives for their most basic liberties https://t.co/KvphH9RiAl \u2014 Josh Hawley (@HawleyMO) October 15, 2019\n\n\n\nThe biggest star in pro basketball, James had remained mum on the issue before speaking to reporters prior to Monday\u2019s preseason game in Los Angeles, where he characterized Morey as \u201cmisinformed.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to get into a [verbal] feud with Daryl Morey, but I believe he wasn\u2019t educated on the situation at hand. And he spoke,\u201d James said. \u201cSo many people could have been harmed, not just financially but physically, emotionally, spiritually. So just be careful what we tweet and what we say and what we do, even though yes, we do have freedom of speech, but there can be a lot of negative that comes with that too.\u201d\n\nJames, a Los Angeles Lakers forward who has been outspoken on social-justice issues, took heat for his statements on social media, later tweeted that he had made his remarks about the \u201cramifications\u201d of Morey\u2019s tweet, not the substance.\n\nLet me clear up the confusion. I do not believe there was any consideration for the consequences and ramifications of the tweet. I\u2019m not discussing the substance. Others can talk About that. \u2014 LeBron James (@KingJames) October 15, 2019\n\n\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
