If an agreement is not reached by Monday 23 September a general election will be held on 10 November.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, S\u00e1nchez turned down a request for an urgent meeting from Albert Rivera, the leader of the Citizens party.\n\nRivera had softened his party\u2019s line, offering to help S\u00e1nchez back into office by abstaining during any forthcoming investiture debate, on the proviso PSOE promised not to increase taxes, ruled out pardoning the 12 Catalan leaders on trial for their role over the 2017 independence bid, and rejected the support of secessionists in the Navarra region.\n\nTimeline Spain heads for fourth election in four years Show Hide 2015 general election Voter anger over economic woes and corruptions scandals leaders to a hung parliament. The two main parties - the ruling People\u2019s party (PP) and the Socialists (PSOE) - suffer big loses at the expense of newcomers (leftwing) Podemos and (rightwing) Ciudadanos. Neither the PP nor the PSOE manage to secure a majority in parliament to form a new government, so \u2026 2016 General election \u2026 another election is held in June. Voter turnout is the lowest since the transition to democracy in 1975. The PP\u2019s vote share increases, but parliamentary deadlock continues. PSOE leader Pedro S\u00e1nchez refuses to allow PP leader Mariano Rajoy to form a minority government, citing the corruption scandals swirling around the PP. S\u00e1nchez resigns Years of simmering discontent among PSOE members with S\u00e1nchez boil over and he is ousted as leader after powerful factions rebel against his refusal to allow Rajoy to form a government. Rajoy secures role as PM With S\u00e1nchez gone, the political paralysis is broken and Rajoy returns as PM after the PSOE abstains on an investiture vote in parliament. S\u00e1nchez re-elected as PSOE leader S\u00e1nchez regains the leadership of the still-divided PSOE, his hardline anti-Rajoy stance bolstered by a slew of corruption scandals involving former senior PP figures in Madrid\u2019s regional government. Rajoy testifies in court Rajoy becomes the first serving Spanish PM to testify in a criminal case. He emphatically denied any knowledge of an illegal funding racket in the PP. Cifuentes scandal The president of Madrid\u2019s regional government, PP's Cristina Cifuentes, resigns after video footage emerged of her apparently being caught stealing two tubs of face cream seven years previously. Rajoy had refused to heed calls to sack Cifuentes after an earlier scandal involving false claims about her academic qualifications. S\u00e1nchez becomes PM The PSOE calls a vote of no confidence in the scandal-plagued Rajoy administration, and it passes through parliament with the help of regional parties and Podemos. S\u00e1nchez is sworn in as PM the next day. Budget impasse S\u00e1nchez is unable to get his 2019 budget passed through parliament after the Basque and Catalan nationalist parties who had supported him against Rajoy vote against it. Yet another election is called. 2019 general election Another inconclusive election sees the PSOE increases its vote share, as the PP vote plummets and the far-right Vox party enters parliament for the first time. Speculation immediately turns to how the PSOE will secure the majority needed to form a government. Fresh elections loom again S\u00e1nchez\u2019s efforts to put together a government are hobbled by the refusal of the Citizens party to countenance a pact with the PSOE, and by the socialists\u2019 own firm veto on entering a coalition with Unidas-Podemos. If an agreement is not reached by 23 September a new general election will be held on 10 November.\n\nS\u00e1nchez said his party was already fulfilling the conditions.\n\nThe acting PM was due to call Rivera, Podemos\u2019s leader, Pablo Iglesias, and Pablo Casado, the leader of the conservative People\u2019s party (PP), on Tuesday to determine their \u201cfinal decision\u201d as Monday\u2019s deadline moved closer.\n\n\u201cPedro S\u00e1nchez is committed to establishing a legislature without the need for elections and to creating a stable government, which is what Spain needs,\u201d said a PSOE source.\n\nRecent polls suggested the socialists would again finish first in a repeat poll, but would still fail to secure a majority. They predict the PP will finish second, picking up more seats than in April, while Citizens will fare very badly, losing between 19 and 23 seats.", "description": "S\u00e1nchez has until next Monday to form government or election takes place on 10 November", "authors": ["Sam Jones"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b6a8563d8ab0b444299921a14ea8df5853a3b9d/739_0_2761_1656/master/2761.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f683ffe1894ee4c35a912faf9fc56df0", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
