This was nothing more than a political discussion \u2014 the problem is that I had it with that guy,\u201d Bonnen wrote. \u201cMy colleagues have always deserved the facts and context this recording provides, and with clear evidence now disproving allegations of criminal wrongdoing, the House can finally move on.\u201d\n\nBut for local Democrats, the audio in no way absolved the speaker and spurred numerous calls for his resignation. A transcript of the recording published by the Dallas Morning News suggests that Bonnen offered Sullivan and Empower Texans media credentials for the House floor if they helped him defeat GOP lawmakers who do not align with his views.\n\n\u201cI just think we\u2019ve got to get through 2020, guarantee if we try and hold this majority \u2014 which, with all due respect to Trump, who I love by the way \u2014 he\u2019s killing us in the urban-suburban districts,\u201d Bonnen says in the recording, according to the transcript. \u201cIf we can make this work, I\u2019ll put your guys on the floor next session.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBonnen repeatedly expressed concerns about maintaining Republican control of the House, where Democrats need to flip nine seats to gain the majority. Empower Texans has accused House Republicans of not being conservative enough, according to the Morning News, and previously provided funds to challengers of GOP incumbents. In the meeting, Bonnen asked Sullivan to fund and support certain GOP candidates over others.\n\nHe also railed against House Democrats, including Rep. Jon Rosenthal of Houston, calling him a \u201cpiece of [expletive]\u201d that \u201cmakes [his] skin crawl,\u201d according to the transcript. The speaker also called Rep. Michelle Beckley of Carrollton \u201cvile\u201d and said Dallas County Rep. Ana-Maria Ramos is \u201cawful.\u201d\n\nBeckley, who was mentioned at least seven times in the meeting, said Tuesday that Bonnen must resign. Beckley defeated GOP Rep. Ron Simmons in 2018, a year that saw Texas Democrats pick up 12 seats from Republicans. It was indicative of a continued shift since 2010, when Republicans won 101 out of 150 House seats for a commanding supermajority.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSince then, however, nearly all districts represented by the Texas House are becoming bluer, Beckley said in an interview. She added that Bonnen\u2019s recorded conversation with Sullivan was a clear indicator that Republicans in the state are \u201cafraid\u201d of her and other Democrats seeking to flip the House next year.\n\n\u201cI am what they most fear, that is my biggest take on the entire thing,\u201d Beckley said Tuesday. \u201cOn the name-calling, my feelings aren\u2019t hurt \u2014 I think this shows there are a bunch of scared men in the Republican Party. That\u2019s my take there.\u201d\n\nBeckley said the recording revealed a \u201cblatant\u201d quid pro quo in addition to other ethics violations by Bonnen, who represents a district south of Houston. In August, state lawmakers asked the Texas Rangers to investigate allegations surrounding the meeting when Sullivan claimed he was offered a quid pro quo, the Dallas Morning News reported.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRep. Chris Turner, chairman of the Texas House Democratic Caucus, said in a statement that Bonnen\u2019s remarks about Democrats were \u201cdisgraceful and unbefitting of the high office he holds,\u201d and had no place in the Texas Legislature. Turner specifically cited Bonnen\u2019s reported remarks on Beckley and Ramos, which he called \u201csexist and completely out of bounds, even with the Republicans\u2019 low standards of the Donald Trump era.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen a political party has had too much power for too long, it begins to destroy itself from within,\u201d Turner, of Grand Prairie, wrote Tuesday. \u201cToday, the long-standing deep divisions within the Republican Party in Texas have been laid bare for everyone to see.\u201d\n\nThe Democratic caucus will discuss the situation further during a meeting Wednesday, he said.\n\n\u201cSpeaking only for myself, I personally believe these revelations are incompatible with Mr. Bonnen serving another term as speaker,\u201d Turner added.\n\nRead More:\n\nAD", "description": "Texas Democrats called for the resignation of GOP House Speaker Dennis Bonnen after the audio's release, in which he also urged a conservative activist to target members of his own party.", "authors": ["Michael Brice-Saddler", "General Assignment Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/iugB1YH35P6xH3eEEuseYKHW6OY=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WQVOJKXPMYI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
