Nichols of Washington to dismiss or move the case to New York, saying Trump\u2019s lawsuit involves a state law and actions by state officials, none of which occurred in Washington. The court has ordered New York not to respond to any request while that motion is pending.\n\nAD\n\nIn Monday\u2019s 40-page filing, House General Counsel Douglas N. Letter said Trump\u2019s case should be dismissed on legal and constitutional grounds, saying the president has no basis to sue because Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard E. Neal (D-Mass.) has not made any request to New York under the law, and the committee has not decided whether to do so.\n\n\u201cAt present, Mr. Trump does not and cannot allege that he is suffering harm,\u201d Letter wrote, and while New York is bound by the court\u2019s orders, \u201cBy Mr. Trump\u2019s own admission, any future Committee request by itself also would not injure him.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAt the same time, Letter argued, the Constitution\u2019s \u201cspeech or debate\u201d clause absolutely bars the executive branch from interfering in Senate or House members\u2019 deliberations, whatever their content or motivations, while lawmakers perform their official duties.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere is simply no precedent in our system of divided government for the Judicial Branch to intrude upon a Congressional committee\u2019s deliberative affairs in this manner,\u201d Letter argued, adding, \u201cThis Court should not be the first to issue such a plainly inappropriate order.\u201d\n\nTrump on July 23 sued Neal and New York officials to prevent them from using New York\u2019s Trust Act, enacted earlier that month, which allows New York tax officials to turn over Trump\u2019s state tax returns to three House committees upon their request.\n\nAD\n\nAttorneys for Trump did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday but will file a response in court next month.\n\nTrump called the pursuit of his private financial information an attempt at political gain and accused New York lawmakers of violating his First Amendment rights by trying to discriminate and retaliate against him \u201cfor his speech and politics.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nNew York lawmakers presented the new law as a means of empowering congressional oversight by unearthing details of the president\u2019s past business dealings, his income and other personal financial information that he has refused to release via his federal tax returns.\n\nAD", "description": "In its filing, the House says no court has ever blocked Congress from even considering an action before it has decided to take it.", "authors": ["Spencer S.
