About 310 people currently work at the NSC. All of the people asked not to be identified because the plan to reduce the NSC\u2019s size hasn\u2019t been made public.\u201d Bloomberg\n\nANOTHER WHISTLEBLOWER COMING FORWARD? -- \u201c2nd Official Is Weighing Whether to Blow the Whistle on Trump\u2019s Ukraine Dealings,\u201d by NYT\u2019s Michael Schmidt and Adam Goldman: \u201cA second intelligence official who was alarmed by President Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine is weighing whether to file his own formal whistle-blower complaint and testify to Congress, according to two people briefed on the matter.\n\n\u201cThe official has more direct information about the events than the first whistle-blower, whose complaint that Mr. Trump was using his power to get Ukraine to investigate his political rivals touched off an impeachment inquiry. The second official is among those interviewed by the intelligence community inspector general to corroborate the allegations of the original whistle-blower, one of the people said.\n\n\u201cThe inspector general, Michael Atkinson, briefed lawmakers privately on Friday about how he substantiated the whistle-blower\u2019s account. It was not clear whether he told lawmakers that the second official was considering filing a complaint.\u201d NYT\n\nMEANWHILE\u2026 SPEAKER NANCY PELOSI was on the stump raising money and selling House Democrats\u2019 impeachment effort this week.

Local Fox News coverage\n\n-- HOW IT PLAYED: \u201cAJC EXCLUSIVE: Pelosi defends impeachment, Dems\u2019 plans for Georgia,\u201d by Atlanta Journal-Constitution\u2019s Tamar Hallerman and Greg Bluestein: \u201cU.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi vowed Friday to protect Georgia\u2019s most vulnerable Democratic lawmaker and flip another suburban Atlanta seat in next year\u2019s election, even as the push for impeachment poses new challenges for her party\u2019s candidates.\n\n\u201cIn an interview with The Atlanta Journal-Constitution\u2019s editorial board, the California Democrat vehemently defended her recently launched inquiry against President Donald Trump, framing it in sweeping moral and ethical terms as she described the U.S. Constitution as \u2018hanging by a thread.\u2019 \u2018Nobody came to Congress to impeach a president,\u2019 Pelosi said, \u2018but we do take an oath to protect and defend our Constitution and to protect our Republic if we need it.\u2019\u201d AJC\n\nUP NEXT -- \u201cHouse Democrats subpoena White House for Ukraine documents,\u201d by Andrew Desiderio, John Bresnahan, and Heather Caygle: \u201cThree top House Democrats subpoenaed the White House on Friday night seeking documents related to President Donald Trump's efforts to pressure Ukrainian officials to target his political rivals, a dramatic escalation of the impeachment fight with the president. ...\n\n\u201cDemocrats gave the White House a two-week deadline of Oct. 18 to comply with their demand, and they warned [White House chief of staff Mick] Mulvaney \u2014 a former House member himself \u2014 that his \u201cfailure or refusal to comply with the subpoena, including at the behest of the President or others at the White House, shall constitute evidence of obstructing the House's impeachment inquiry and may be used as an adverse inference against you and the President.\" POLITICO\n\nGood Saturday morning.\n\nA message from Goldman Sachs 10,000 Women: Since 2008, Goldman Sachs has trained and empowered women business owners in developing economies through our 10,000 Women program, with 70% of graduates reporting higher revenues and nearly 60% creating new jobs in their communities.

Schiff and Pelosi never thought I would release the transcript of the call. Got them by surprise, they got caught. This is a fraud against the American people!\u201d \u2026\n\n-- AND HITTING BACK AT ROMNEY: \u201cSomebody please wake up Mitt Romney and tell him that my conversation with the Ukrainian President was a congenial and very appropriate one, and my statement on China pertained to corruption, not politics. If Mitt worked this hard on Obama, he could have won. Sadly, he choked!\u201d \u2026\u201cMitt Romney never knew how to win. He is a pompous \u2018ass\u2019 who has been fighting me from the beginning, except when he begged me for my endorsement for his Senate run (I gave it to him), and when he begged me to be Secretary of State (I didn\u2019t give it to him).

They worried that Trump would make promises he shouldn\u2019t keep, endorse policies the United States long opposed, commit a diplomatic blunder that jeopardized a critical alliance, or simply pressure a counterpart for a personal favor.\n\n\u201c\u2018There was a constant undercurrent in the Trump administration of [senior staff] who were genuinely horrified by the things they saw that were happening on these calls,\u2019 said one former White House official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the private conversations. \u2018Phone calls that were embarrassing, huge mistakes he made, months and months of work that were upended by one impulsive tweet.\u2019\u201d WaPo\n\nWAPO\u2019S ASHLEY PARKER: \u201c\u2018Me!

But at the very least, they said, Perry played an active role in the Trump administration's efforts to shape decisions by the newly elected government of President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\n\u201cAmong other changes, Perry pushed for Ukraine\u2019s state-owned natural gas company Naftogaz to expand its board to include Americans, two people familiar with the matter said. Two long-time energy executives based in Perry\u2019s home state of Texas were among those under consideration for that role, one source familiar with the administration\u2019s dealings with the company said.\u201d POLITICO\n\nSCOOP: NATASHA BERTRAND: \u201cJustice Department hasn\u2019t interviewed key Russia probe witnesses\u201d: \u201cFor months, President Donald Trump\u2019s allies have been raising expectations for prosecutor John Durham\u2019s investigation into the origins of the Russia probe, predicting that he will uncover a deep state plot to stage a \u2018coup\u2019 against the president. ...\n\n\u201cBut in the five months since Attorney General Bill Barr tapped Durham to investigate the origins of the Russia probe, and whether any inappropriate \u2018spying\u2019 occurred on members of the Trump campaign, he has not requested interviews with any of the FBI or DOJ employees who were directly involved in, or knew about, the opening of the Russia investigation in 2016, according to people familiar with the matter. The omission raises questions about what, exactly, Durham\u2014alongside Attorney General Bill Barr\u2014has been investigating.\u201d POLITICO\n\nA message from Goldman Sachs 10,000 Women: Explore the stories of our 10,000 Women graduates and find out how they're generating revenue and creating jobs in their communities.\n\n2020 WATCH -- \u201c\u2018You built the nation\u2019: Trump courts black voters in White House mini-rally,\u201d by Nolan D. McCaskill: \u201cPresident Donald Trump held what amounted to a mini-rally with nearly 300 young black supporters inside the White House on Friday, replete with campaign-style chants of \u2018USA!\u2019 and \u2018four more years!\u2019 \u2018You broke the sound barrier,\u2019 Trump told the audience of African American students and young professionals, who greeted him with chants and cheers inside the White House\u2019s East Room. \u2018I\u2019ve never heard it quite like that, and I appreciate it. We love you.\u2019\n\n\u201cWith an eye on the 2020 election, the president delivered his pitch to black voters \u2014 and aired his grievances \u2014 in true Trumpian fashion. He not only touted historically low unemployment among black Americans but also conducted a roll call of his top black supporters, calling out some of his African American critics while slamming Democrats and the news media along the way. At one point, Trump also credited African Americans for building the country, a seeming reference to their ancestors\u2019 role as slaves.\u201d POLITICO\n\n-- \u201cJoe Biden calls Trump 'unhinged' in first new ad of $6 million early-state push,\u201d by CNN\u2019s Eric Bradner\n\n-- \u201cSanders and Warren put big donors on notice with massive hauls,\u201d by David Siders: \u201cThe latest batch of fundraising reports released this week confirmed a new reality of presidential politics: the traditional, big-dollar model of funding a presidential campaign is going the way of landlines and the VCR.\n\n\u201cWith Elizabeth Warren\u2019s announcement Friday that she had raised nearly $25 million in the last three months \u2014 slightly less than Bernie Sanders reported Tuesday \u2014 two candidates who didn\u2019t hold traditional donor events became the top two fundraisers in Democratic primary.

Chief Executive Tim Cook reached out to one of his most important contacts in Washington, Jared Kushner.\n\n\u201cMr. Kushner arranged a call between Mr. Cook and his father-in-law, President Trump, people familiar with the call said, giving the Apple chief a chance to explain how tariffs would increase iPhone prices and impair Apple\u2019s ability to compete against rivals such as Samsung Electronics Co.\n\n\u201cWithin days, the Trump administration scaled back its tariff plan to exempt a swath of electronics products, including iPhones, saying it wanted to protect consumers ahead of the holiday shopping season.
