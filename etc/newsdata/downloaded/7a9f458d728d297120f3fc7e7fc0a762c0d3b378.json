We\u2019re only observing that today just happens to be a national holiday, on a day that just happens to be the 55th anniversary of Keanu Reeves\u2019s birth. Labor Day/Keanu\u2019s birthday is a bittersweet holiday: a sign of the end of summer, but also the beginning of a new year of Reeves-led projects, late-night talk show appearances, and charming red-carpet interviews to look forward to. Consider the year he\u2019s had! He saw the 20th anniversary of The Matrix, introduced audiences to the dark art of dog fu for John Wick 3, voiced Canada\u2019s leading stuntman, Duke Caboom, and got punched by Randall Park. He reckoned with the fact that he\u2019s the internet\u2019s boyfriend, gave some stranded strangers a van tour of Bakersfield, and taught an awestruck audience at The Late Show With Stephen Colbert what happens after we die. Of all the people in Hollywood to be enjoying a moment, to have bloggers attaching a -ssance suffix to the end of their name willy-nilly, we\u2019re happy it\u2019s him. So celebrate Keanu\u2019s big day by watching the above teaser from obscure 2013 indie Generation Um \u2026, which shows the birthday boy scarfing down a vanilla cupcake.\n\nThen enjoy this video, entitled \u201cKeanu Reeves Eats Another Cupcake,\u201d which appears to be a clip from a different obscure movie called Exposed (2016). If that isn\u2019t enough for you, you can watch this MTV interview from 2017 where Keanu talks about the time he got a cupcake with a single candle in it for his 46th birthday, a \u201clovely gift from Jessica at Technicolor.\u201d Happy birthday, you beautiful Virgo!", "description": "It\u2019s September 2, which means it\u2019s beloved actor Keanu Reeves\u2019s 55th birthday. The banks are closed. The post office is closed. Coincidence? We think not. We reflect on the year in Keanu and celebrate with videos of him eating cupcakes.", "authors": ["Rebecca Alter"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/02/2-keanu-reeves.w1200.h630.jpg"}
