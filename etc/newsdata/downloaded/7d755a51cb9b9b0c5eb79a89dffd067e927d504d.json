Another reason, he said, was suspicion of past corruption in Ukraine \u2014 which included Ukraine\u2019s possible role in interfering in the 2016 presidential election, including its possible possession of a Democratic National Committee server.\n\nMulvaney said: \u201cThe look back to what happened in 2016 certainly was part of the things [President Trump] was worried about in corruption with that nation. That is absolutely appropriate.\u201d\n\nWhen a reporter said that was a \u201cquid pro quo,\u201d Mulvaney objected that it was routine for the U.S. to withhold funding from foreign nations all the time. He gave an example from this week: the U.S. had withheld aid from the \u201cNorthern Triangle\u201d nations \u2014 El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala \u2014 until they agreed to help stop migration.\n\nMulvaney later added: \u201cThe money held up had absolutely nothing to do with Biden.\u201d\n\nWhen another reporter used the term \u201cquid pro quo,\u201d Mulvaney objected:\n\nThose are the terms you use. Go look at what [U.S. Ambassador to the European Union] Gordon Sondland said today in his testimony \u2014 was that, I think, in his opening statement \u2014 he said something along the lines of, they were trying to get the \u201cdeliverable,\u201d and the deliverable was a statement by the Ukraine about how they were going to deal with corruption. Okay? Go read his testimony, if you haven\u2019t already. And what he says, and he\u2019s right, that\u2019s absolutely ordinary course of business. This is what you do. When you have someone come to the White House \u2014 when you either arrange a visit for the president, you have a phone call with the president \u2014 a lot of times we use that as the opportunity to get them to make a statement of their policy, or to announce something that they are going to do. It\u2019s one of the reasons you can sort of announce that on the phone call or at the meeting. This is the ordinary course of foreign policy.\n\nAs Mulvaney was speaking, Vice President Mike Pence was preparing to announce a cease-fire agreement with Turkey in which the U.S. would withhold further economic sanctions once Turkey had allowed Kurdish fighters to withdraw.\n\nThe White House has insisted throughout the Ukraine controversy that there was no \u201cquid pro quo\u201d in relation to a request by the president that the Ukrainian government look into possible corruption involving Biden\u2019s son, Hunter Biden, and the former vice president\u2019s past pressure to fire a prosecutor who had investigated his son\u2019s company.\n\nMulvaney did not admit that there had been a \u201cquid pro quo,\u201d but said only that the U.S. had attached ordinary conditions to funding, including a demand that Ukraine commit to fight corruption and investigate past interference in a U.S. election.\n\nWhite House correspondent Jim Acosta later told viewers, as anchor Brooke Baldwin shook her head disapprovingly, \u201cMick Mulvaney was asked at one point whether or not this sounds like a quid pro quo and he said, we do this all the time.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cNow, the reason I said it\u2019s sounds like this is a \u2018catch me if you can\u2019 administration is because essentially what Mick Mulvaney is laying out is the same legal argument laid out by former President [Richard] Nixon in that famous interview that he did after his presidency, that if the president does it, it\u2019s not illegal.\u201d\n\nThat is not what Mulvaney said. In fact, Mulvaney pointed out that the White House had referred the transcript of Trump\u2019s phone call with the Ukrainian president to the Department of Justice for criminal investigation \u2014 one that had cleared the president. He also noted that the White House had released the transcript publicly without fear of any impropriety.\n\nAcosta went on: \u201cHe [Mulvaney] did try to draw the line that, well, this didn\u2019t have anything to do with Joe Biden. That\u2019s baloney, Brooke. Because as you just pointed out a few moments ago, it\u2019s in the transcript.\u201d\n\nHowever, it has already been widely reported that Ukraine did not know any aid had been suspended until several weeks after the July 25 telephone call.\n\nOther outlets took a different approach from that of CNN.\n\nPolitico, for example, reported: \u201cMulvaney appears to confirm Ukraine aid was contingent upon probe into 2016 election.\u201d which is accurate. It also published a vaguer headline: \u201cMulvaney appears to confirm Ukraine aid was tied to political probe.\u201d It did not conclude, however, that the White House had admitted to a \u201cquid pro quo.\u201d\n\nUpdate: Mulvaney clarified Thursday evening that there was never any \u201cquid pro quo\u201d with Ukraine, adding that no funding had been withheld for reasons related to a suspected Democratic National Committee communications server (that was said, at the time, to have been hacked by Russians, but was never handed to the FBI).\n\nJoel B.
