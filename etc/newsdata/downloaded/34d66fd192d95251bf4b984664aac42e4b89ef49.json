'Pre swim breakfast courtesy of baby,' he captioned\n\nMusician turned athlete: Cody's breakfast comes ahead of his swimming race at USC later in the day\n\nMiley's skills in the kitchen saw her make Cody two slices of peanut butter toast topped with banana as well as a berry smoothie that had goji berries sprinkled over the top.\n\nCody's breakfast comes ahead of his swimming race at USC later in the day.\n\nThe long-time friend's social media post comes after the Mother's Daughter singer shared a long post on Friday about how hard it was to date in the public eye while slamming 'slut-shamers' for calling her a 'whore.'\n\nSpeaking her truth: On Friday, Miley Cyrus took to social media to express herself about how she's portrayed in the media, and her new relationship with Cody Simpson; the pair seen here in Miley's Instagram post from 2015\n\nFor one of the topless shots of Cody, Miley captioned in the form of a checklist, listing out the hunk's credentials: his age, Australian nationality (which she mentioned is 'my type' surely as a nod to her ex love Liam), and his 'abs'.\n\n'I know the public feels invested in my past relationship [with ex Liam Hemsworth] because they felt like they saw it thru from the beginning,' the star began her longer confessional.\n\n'I think that's why people have always felt so entitled over my life and how I live it because they've watched me grow up.'\n\n'But I am grown now,' Cyrus continued, 'and make choices as an adult knowing the truth/details/reality.' People only \"know\" what they see on the internet.'\n\nMiley also addressed the inequity of how famous women are portrayed in their pursuit of love and intimacy, as compared to famous men.\n\n'Men (especially successful ones) are RARELY slut shamed. They move on from one beautiful woman to the next MOST times without consequence. They are referred to as \"legends\", \"heart throbs\",' she continued, 'where women are called sluts/whores! I am trying to just THRIVE/survive in a \"mans\" world.'\n\n'If we can't beat em, join em!' Miley concluded the section. 'If our president can \"grab em by the p***y...\" can't I just have a kiss and acai bowl?!?!'\n\nAfter specifically responding to being recently spotted kissing Cody, she addressed the budding relationship on the next screen of her Instagram story.\n\nShe's into him: For one of the topless shots she posted of Cody, Miley captioned in the form of a checklist, listing out the hunk's credentials\n\n'I refuse to recluse and \"date\" from home cause A. That's not fun B. Extremely uncomfortable/puts me in a vulnerable position,' the Slide Away performer expressed.\n\n'I would like to share an activity with someone I am dating and not be stuck at home with pretty much nothing to do but \"Netflix and chill\".\n\n'This \"dating\" thing is new to me too. I've never been an \"adult\"/grown a** woman experiencing this... I was in a committed relationship for almost All my teens and early 20s; with the exception of a few breaks, which usually in those times I was working my a** off with not much R&R... and \"meeting/trusting\" people in my position is really tuff.'\n\n'Don't f***ing pity me, not what I'm asking for,' Miley concluded. 'I have a great life I wouldn't trade for \"privacy\" but PLEASE don't make this awkward for me! I am trying to make light and like always MAKE FUN of myself/and the public's perception of me! Get used to me dating \u2013 this is where I am at!'\n\nClaiming what's hers: Another of Miley's adoring snaps of Cody on her Instagram story on Friday\n\nThis isn't the first time the singer has used social media to vent.\n\nShortly after her split from Liam Hemsworth was made public late this summer, Cyrus made a public statement on Twitter an Instagram that revealed some of her feelings about the split, and how it was important for her to set the record straight.\n\n'At this point I had to make a healthy decision for myself to leave a previous life behind,' she tweeted on August 22.\n\n'I am the healthiest and happiest I have been in a long time. You can say I am a twerking, pot smoking , foul mouthed hillbilly but I am not a liar.'\n\nSetting it straight: This isn't the first time the singer has used social media to vent", "description": "Cody Simpson professed his love for Miley Cyrus on Saturday morning when he shared she had made him a healthy breakfast to start the day.", "authors": ["Annita Katee", "Dan Heching For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/05/20/19340538-0-image-a-29_1570303075427.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
