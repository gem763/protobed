(AP) - Wisconsin health officials say the state has recorded its first human case of West Nile virus this year.\n\nThe Wisconsin Department of Health Services said Wednesday the case involves a resident of northeastern Wisconsin.\n\nThe department is advising residents to continue to protect themselves against mosquito bites.\n\nWest Nile virus is spread to humans through the bite of an infected mosquito and is not spread person to person. Mosquitoes get the virus by feeding on infected birds.\n\nThe majority of human West Nile cases occur during the months of August and September. However, the risk of contracting West Nile and other mosquito-borne illnesses is present any time mosquitoes are active, so residents should prevent mosquito bites through the rest of the summer and into early fall.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Wisconsin health officials say the state has recorded its first human case of West Nile virus this year.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
