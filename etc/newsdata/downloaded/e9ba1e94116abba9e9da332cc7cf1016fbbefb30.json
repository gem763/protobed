Ole Gunnar Solskjaer\u2019s side took command of Group L with this Europa League victory over Partizan Belgrade and kept a clean sheet in the process, though that is where the signs of encouragement end. Anthony Martial\u2019s penalty converted at the end of the first half was decisive but so too was Partizan\u2019s wasteful finishing.\n\nThere are mitigating circumstances. 18-year-old James Garner made his first senior start. 19-year-old full-back Brandon Williams made only his second. Martial played his first significant minutes since August. Jesse Lingard was also returning from a spell on the sidelines. Harry Maguire was captaining United for the first time and so caught up in the moment, he briefly forgot to perform his pre-match coin toss and pennant-sharing duties.\n\nIt was all played out in a predictably heated atmosphere too, with uniformed firefighters \u2013 yellow helmets and all \u2013 placed at each end of the pitch to extinguish flares. Amid the hostility, there was also poignancy. The Partizan Stadium was the site of the Busby Babes\u2019 final game together before eight of their number lost their lives in the Munich air disaster. United officials held a memorial ceremony on the pitch on Thursday morning.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

United\u2019s away record has been one of the many sticks used to beat him and his players during a difficult start to the season. The streak is over now. But the underlying problems remain and should not be masked by a valuable three points won in challenging circumstances. A better team than Partizan would have punished United\u2019s performance.\n\nManaged by Aston Villa cult icon Savo Milosevic, Partizan made 15 attempts on Sergio Romero\u2019s goal, hitting the post through on-loan striker Umar Sadiq, and they believed they deserved a penalty of their own when the ball struck two United arms in as many minutes. Slicker counter-attacks and more precise finishing would have earned them a result. United, meanwhile, were just as lacklustre in attack.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Though Jesse Lingard struck the post, they created precious little in the way of clear-cut chances \u2013 a familiar problem under Solskjaer. At least Williams showed why his manager is constantly demanding more direct football from his players. His surge past Nemanja Miletic drew a foul from the Partizan full-back and left referee Xavier Fernandez without much choice but to point to the spot.\n\nDespite the waves of Partizan attacks which followed, United would hold on to end that miserable away run. \u201cOf course I\u2019m happy now that we can just look forward to the next one,\u201d Solskjaer said. \u201cTry to build momentum.\u201d Trips to Norwich, Chelsea in the EFL Cup and Bournemouth now follow.
