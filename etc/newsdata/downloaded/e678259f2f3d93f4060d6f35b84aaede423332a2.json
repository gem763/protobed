Tatyana Zenkovich\n\nIt will, of course, be nothing of the sort if Mr Erdogan has his way. His primary objective is to remove the Kurds and their SDF allies and replace them with a significant proportion of the millions of Syrians who have sought refuge in Turkey during Syria's long-running civil war. It is a policy that amounts to little more than ethnic cleansing.\n\nThe Turks' obsession with consolidating their hold over the border territory with Syria is borne of their long-running conflict with Kurdish separatists who, prior to the civil war, supported the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, a neo-Marxist organisation that is designated as a terrorist group by the US, Britain and other North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) member states.\n\nThe YPG, so far as the Turks are concerned, is just another manifestation of the PKK, whose leader, Abdullah Ocalan, is currently languishing in a Turkish jail where he is serving a life sentence.\n\nThe YPG's problematic provenance begs the question why, given its terrorist links, it became an ally of Washington in the first place. The answer lies somewhere in the old Arabic adage: the enemy of my enemy is my friend.\n\nMr Trump certainly regards the relationship as being based on mutual benefits, rather than shared interests, pointing out in one of his tweets that \"The Kurds fought with us, but were paid massive amounts of money and equipment to do so.\"\n\nNevertheless, the prospect of Washington abandoning an erstwhile ally that has played a central role in defeating an anti-American organisation like IS does not look good, as it gives the impression that the White House is prepared to ditch its allies the moment they outlive their usefulness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFortunately, the president appears belatedly to have grasped the implications of his pledge to allow Mr Erdogan the freedom to create his \"safe zone\" along the Syrian border, and has subsequently threatened to \"obliterate\" the Turkish economy if Ankara oversteps the mark with the Kurds.\n\nThere is, though, a wider consideration that needs to be taken into account for countries like Britain, which regard themselves as close allies of the US, but must now contend with a president whose conduct can appear capricious, to say the least.\n\nBritain, too, has worked closely with the Kurds and the SDF in the fight against IS, and continues to support them over the vexed issue of what to do with the estimated 70,000 IS fighters - several hundred of whom are said to originate from Britain - who are living in the squalor of Kurdish-run prison camps.\n\nOne option that has been mooted is that Turkey assumes responsibility for the IS fighters in return for being allowed to establish its safe zone, a suggestion that needs to be treated with caution as Ankara stands accused of funding several IS-related groups during the Syrian conflict.\n\nA better option would be to allow the Kurds to continue holding the captives while the outside world works out how to deal with them. Otherwise there is a very real possibility that they might end up being released and allowed to rejoin terror groups, IS among them, which really would be a betrayal of all those who fought to destroy the Islamist caliphate.\n\nThe Telegraph London", "description": "Trump\u2019s decision to pull American troops back from the Syrian-Turkish border raises fears of a rebirth of the murderous caliphate.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.8315%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_149%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/0d5633de6d12b08149812445ec2b97aeec1bddc2", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
