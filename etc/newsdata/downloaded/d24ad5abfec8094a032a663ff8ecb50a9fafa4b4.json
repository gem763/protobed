Today, by reducing biodiversity, we are running the risk of losing our critical ecosystem players, many of whose importance we don't yet fully appreciate.\"\n\nIn 2017, scientists warned that a sixth mass extinction in Earth\u2019s history was underway due to the loss of wildlife in recent decades caused by human overpopulation and overconsumption.\n\nA separate study in 2018 said that it could take between three and five million years to recover the levels of biodiversity that are expected to be lost over the next 50 years.\n\nAgencies contributed to this report", "description": "The mass extinction event that killed the dinosaurs led to the world\u2019s oceans being disrupted for millions of years, according to new research.", "authors": ["Conrad Duncan"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/28/12/mass-extinction-stock.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
