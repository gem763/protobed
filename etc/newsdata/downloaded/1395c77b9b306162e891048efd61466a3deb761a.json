If this is not possible, we will have to leave with no deal.\n\n'In the event of no deal, the Government will prioritise the flow of goods at the border while continuing to take a risk-based approach to controls and checks on goods to minimise additional friction.'\n\nHe added: 'We will continue to work to make sure we have the best possible preparation to support the flow of goods.'\n\nMr Edwards told the PA news agency: 'This is the farcical level we have descended to - the British Government can no longer even guarantee we have the necessary supplies of toilet paper in a crash-out Brexit.\n\n'It's already said it's willing to flush the economy down the toilet, but now we won't have the paper to clean up after.\n\n'As much as this revelation lends itself to toilet humour, it shows the serious damage a no-deal Brexit would do, even to our most basic of supplies.'\n\nMichael Gove, pictured in Downing Street earlier this month, today published the government's latest No Deal Brexit planning documents\n\nMichael Gove today ramped up the government's preparations for a No Deal Brexit as the chances of an agreement being struck between Britain and the EU appeared to collapse.\n\nBoris Johnson effectively killed off hopes of a Brexit deal this morning after turning down a demand from Angela Merkel for Northern Ireland to stay in the customs union 'forever'.\n\nThe early morning phone call - and the subsequent reaction from Donald Tusk who accused Mr Johnson of playing a 'stupid blame game' - seemingly put the UK on course for a chaotic split from Brussels.\n\nMr Gove then published a 159-page 'No-Deal Readiness Report' spelling out all of the measures the government has undertaken to prepare for a bad break on October 31.\n\nThe document sets out in detail the government's belief that the UK will be able to cope with No Deal.\n\nThe timing of its publication will be greeted by critics with suspicion given that it came just hours after a disorderly divorce from the bloc appeared to become more likely.\n\nThe document outlines the actions ministers have taken to minimise the disruption a No Deal Brexit could cause in areas like food supplies, medical supplies and border control.", "description": "Essity, which makes the Velvet and Cushelle brands said it was developing 'robust contingency plans' across its supply chain to cope with no deal, but warned stocks were 'not unlimited'.", "authors": ["David Wilcock", "Whitehall Correspondent For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/17/19451984-0-image-a-15_1570552685590.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
