Or the desire to build up the club and the influence I had on the club.\n\n'To build up the club when we built the stadium, against the fact that I could have won more by going somewhere else and being less limited financially. At the end of the day, I'm happy to do what I did.'\n\nThe Frenchman did win seven FA Cups alongside his three league triumphs, as well as seven Community Shields, but there will always be an element of disappointment that the club's last Premier League win came in 2004.\n\nWenger is currently a pundit on beIN SPORTS but is eyeing up a return to management\n\nWenger says he is proud of the legacy he created at Arsenal, where he won three league titles\n\nDespite that, Wenger is proud of his time in north London and even questions whether his style would have worked at Real Madrid.\n\n'I thought from a very young age I want to work the way I like to work,' he added. 'Sometimes today I weigh up a little bit \"have I done well or not?\".\n\n'But I felt that I was in a club [Arsenal] where I met my needs the way I wanted to work.\n\n'Why change that and maybe be in a bit more glorious situation but less happy situation, where I had less influence on the club [Real Madrid]? So I decided that I keep trying to experience my love story [at Arsenal].'", "description": "Wenger spent 22 years in charge of the Gunners, winning three Premier League titles in the early stages before a barren spell saw the club go 14 years without league success.", "authors": ["Ben Nagle For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/09/19682138-0-image-a-9_1571041651568.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
