Koreans responded by staging a boycott of Japanese goods at home and eschewing trips to Japan.The think tank said it compared the amount of spending by Koreans in Japan during July and August with the same months in 2018.According to the Korea Tourism Organization, the number of Koreans that visited Japan in July and August was 870,400, down 27.6 percent from a year earlier.At the same time, Korea saw its number of Japanese visitors rise. According to the Japan National Tourism Organization, the number of Japanese visitors to Korea during July and August rose 10.8 percent from a year earlier to reach 604,482.\u201cJapanese people who visited Korea in July and August booked their flights before the relationship between Seoul and Tokyo became hostile,\u201d KERI said.\u201cIt is suspected that the increase in the number of Japanese visitors during those months was a result of the country\u2019s distinct culture of not canceling trips.\u201dEven though the number of Japanese visitors to Korea increased during the summer, Korea\u2019s airlines lost revenues because they cut flights from Korea to Japan.While local hotels, restaurants, bars and retailers saw their profits rise on-year during the summer thanks to spending by Japanese tourists, the airlines lost around 95.5 billion won in revenues.Japan\u2019s accommodation businesses were hit the hardest with a 118.8 billion won drop, followed by 101.9 billion won for restaurants and 77.1 billion won for the retail sector.\u201cIf the relationship between the two countries continues to worsen, the number of Japanese visitors to Korea could fall as well,\u201d said Yoo Hwan-ik, a director at KERI. \u201cThe negative effect for Korea could snowball in the long-term.\u201dBY PARK SU-RYON, KO JUN-TAE [ko.juntae@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://pds.joins.com/jmnet/koreajoongangdaily/_data/photo/2019/10/06201513.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
