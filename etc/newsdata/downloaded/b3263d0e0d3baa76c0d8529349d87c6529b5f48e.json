Maes, 21, was assigned to the Army\u2019s 1st Cavalry Division when he was injured about a year ago while his unit was on maneuvers in Poland as part of a joint training mission called Atlantic Resolve.\n\nA loader for an M1A2 Abrams, Spc. Maes had been sleeping following an exhausting exercise when the 65-ton tank suddenly started rolling downhill, Army officials said in a release.\n\n\u201cI called out to the driver, \u2018Step on the brakes!\u2019\u201d Spc. Maes said. \u201cBut, he shouted back that it wasn\u2019t him.\u201d\n\nA investigation later revealed the tank\u2019s parking brake failed and a hydraulic leak meant the emergency braking procedures were unresponsive. With their tank careening down the hill, they could only hold on.\n\nSpc. Maes was thrown across the tank when it crashed into an embankment. All three crewmembers were seriously injured, Army officials said.\n\nThe driver, identified as Private First Class Victor Alamo, sustained a broken back. The gunner, Sergeant. Aechere Crump, had a serious wound to her thigh. The turret of the tank slammed back on impact, crushing Spc. Maes\u2018 leg.\n\n\u201cI pushed and pulled at my leg as hard as I could to get loose and felt a sharp tear,\u201d Spc. Maes recalled. \u201cI thought I had dislodged my leg but when I moved away, [it] was completely gone.\u201d\n\nAlthough seriously injured, he managed to crawl back into the rear of the tank and grabbed a tourniquet to stop the bleeding. They couldn\u2019t call for help because the tank\u2019s radio system was apparently damaged in the crash.\n\nThen, Spc. Maes heard his cell phone ringing. Sgt. Crump, also seriously wounded, found it and tossed it to him. He managed to send out a call for help. The last thing he remembered was seeing his sergeant major running up the hill carrying the leg.\n\n\u201cI wanted to keep it [and] see if it could be reattached. But, it was pulverized,\u201d Spc. Maes said, according to the Army.\n\nIn addition to losing a leg, Spc. Maes also broke his ankle, his pelvis and his shoulder. He spent four months in intensive care.\n\nSpc. Maes is now recovering and learning to adapt to his new life at the Warrior Transition Battalion at Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio. He undergoes regular therapy to prepare him for receiving a prosthetic leg through a cutting edge procedure called osseointegration.\n\nRather than using a traditional socket to attach the prosthesis, surgeons at the hospital will implant a titanium rod in the bone of his residual limb. It\u2019s not unlike a dental implant, hospital officials said.\n\nSpc. Maes said he now wants to become a prosthetist and help others in his situation.\n\n\u201cWhen something like this happens, it\u2019s easy to give up because your life won\u2019t be the same and you\u2019re not wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cLife will take a 180 but it doesn\u2019t have to be a bad thing. Don\u2019t let it hinder you from moving forward.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
