His fetish landed him on the wanted list of multiple Indian states.\n\nAfter being caught in 2014 with his uncle, Yarlen jumped bail and had disappeared since, until now. He was tracked down by the MP Special Investigation Team to a shanty on the Gujarat-Vadodara highway.\n\nYarlen allegedly belongs to a community that believes sloth bear penises can cure various illnesses, including impotency. He allegedly said that he would eat the reproductive organs of the bears as they are the best aphrodisiacs.\n\nSloth bears are on the International Union for Conservation of Nature\u2019s (IUCN) Red List as \u201cvulnerable.\u201d\n\nA Madhya Pradesh forest department official told AFP, \"He's jumped bail earlier and fudged documents. Over the years, he has taken on several names as well, the latest being Jasrat.\" He also said that Yarlen would sell the gallbladders of the bears to businessmen across India. In certain communities, gallbladders and reproductive organs of sloth bears are thought to cure cancer, asthma and chronic pain among other illnesses. Bear bile, a digestive fluid secreted by the liver and stored in the gallbladder, is coveted by some in China and other Asian countries, where it\u2019s marketed as a cure for everything from hangovers to cancer.\n\nYarlen is also being investigated for killing a tigress that disappeared from the Pench Reserve in Madhya Pradesh in 2012. The skin of the tigress, T13, was found a year later in Nepal. Yarlen confessed to killing the tigress during interrogation.\n\nThe man was found with several Aadhaar cards and three fake voter IDs. He told officials that he became a poacher at 15, and since then has killed multiple tigers, sloth bears and hundreds of wild boars and peacocks.\n\nThroughout the years he had disappeared, Yarlen was jumping from village to village. He avoided getting caught by bribing the village leaders with the wild boards he would catch.\n\nCall records of Yarlen proved that he was working with Delhi-based agents who are known for being major suppliers of tiger skin and bones to China, Tibet and some western countries.\n\nAbout 75 percent of the world\u2019s tigers live in India, with Madhya Pradesh having the most within the country. India committed to doubling its tiger population by 2022, but in revealing last year's tiger census, it has done so four years early.\n\nFind Edoardo on Twitter and Instagram.", "description": "The arrest also solves the mystery of a tigress' death, whose skin was found in Nepal in 2013, a year after she was last seen.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5dafe64550286b00922f4e4a/lede/1571808858103-FotoJet-66.jpeg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
