A business associate in Shanghai doesn\u2019t seem to have an explanation yet, either. Are the bitter-enders at CNN and NBC News finally ready to stop defending the indefensible?\n\nLast week this column noted that former Vice President Joe Biden once again declined to offer a defense of his family\u2019s business model even in an op-ed ostensibly responding to attacks on this model. Over the weekend, his son Hunter Biden quit another of the overseas engagements for which he seemed eminently unqualified.\n\nGet news and analysis on politics, policy, national security and more, delivered right to your inbox\n\nThe Journal\u2019s Ken Thomas and Thomas Grove noted on Sunday:\n\nHunter Biden is stepping down from a director\u2019s position at a Chinese private-equity firm and said he wouldn\u2019t serve on any foreign boards if his father, Joe Biden, is elected president, lowering his controversial business profile as it becomes embroiled in the 2020 election and Democrats\u2019 efforts to impeach President Trump.\n\n...The former vice president\u2019s son, 49 years old, served on the board of Ukrainian natural-gas company Burisma Holdings Ltd. while his father oversaw U.S. policy on Ukraine as vice president. Hunter Biden stepped down from the Burisma board in April. The younger Biden remained a director of BHR (Shanghai) Equity Investment Fund Management Co., a Chinese investment firm, where Mr. Trump also alleges inappropriate conduct by the Bidens. Hunter Biden said Sunday he would remove himself from the firm\u2019s board on Oct. 31.\n\nThe statement released through Hunter Biden\u2019s lawyer, George Mesires, described his work for Burisma, saying \u201cat no time has any law enforcement agency, either domestic or foreign, alleged that Hunter engaged in wrongdoing at any point during his five-year term.\u201d\n\nThis is the Bill Clinton standard\u2014that any conduct not deemed illegal in a foreign jurisdiction is fair game for those with U.S. political juice.\n\nToday the Journal\u2019s Mr. Thomas reports from Washington:\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Joe Biden released a series of ethics proposals Monday, looking to spotlight concerns about President Trump\u2019s record while also addressing criticism about his son\u2019s business dealings.\n\n...Hunter Biden is sitting for an interview with ABC News that will air Tuesday, which will mark his first televised comments on the matter.\n\nIf Hunter Biden can come up with a good explanation for ABC of what he was doing in overseas locales where his father was leading U.S. policy, perhaps he can also share it with his longtime partners. Cissy Zhou and Jun Mai report today in the South China Morning Post:\n\nBHR (Shanghai) Equity Investment Fund Management Company has grabbed global media attention for its links with Hunter Biden, the son of former United States vice-president Joe Biden, after US President Donald Trump fired a barrage of corruption allegations at him and requested China investigate the Bidens\u2019 financial activities in the country.\n\nThe company has repeatedly declined to elaborate on the younger Biden\u2019s role at the firm when contacted by the South China Morning Post via phone, mail and visits to the office. But Jonathan Li Xiangsheng, the firm\u2019s chief executive and Hunter Biden\u2019s partner, has said the company was working on an explanation about the American\u2019s role.\n\nLi refused to comment on the younger Biden when reached by the Post on Monday.\n\nA recent visit to the firm\u2019s registered address in Beijing found a small, plainly decorated office, where a receptionist said she had never seen Hunter Biden.\n\nMore than five years after going into business with Hunter Biden, his associates in China are still \u201cworking on an explanation\u201d of his role there? If this doesn\u2019t arouse the curiosity of a neutral journalist, it\u2019s hard to imagine what would. But the reaction of much of the American media perhaps tells us how rare such journalists have become.\n\nIn a Saturday op-ed entitled, \u201cHe who must not be named,\u201d George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley noted a widespread media urge to simply suppress the story:\n\nHunter Biden: The mere mention of his name seemingly triggers the vapors among cable TV hosts and their guests.\n\nWhen President Trump turned to the Bidens and Ukraine in a speech, MSNBC host Nicolle Wallace cut off the coverage, declaring she had to protect the listeners: \u201cWe hate to do this, really, but the president isn\u2019t telling the truth.\u201d When Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) tried to answer a question about the Ukraine scandal by referencing the Bidens, \u201cMeet the Press\u201d host Chuck Todd angrily told him not to \u201cgaslight\u201d the nation.\n\n...What is most remarkable about the paucity of coverage of Hunter Biden\u2019s dealings is the conclusory mantra that \u201cthis has all been investigated.\u201d ...When Rep. Lee Zeldin (R-N.Y.) raised the issue on CNN, host Erin Burnett cut him off: \u201cThere is no evidence of Joe Biden doing anything wrong, and this is something that has been looked into, and I think \u2014 I want to make a point here \u2014 I think what we need to talk about right now is what did the president right now do or not do.\u201d Other CNN hosts have repeated the line of \u201cno evidence of wrongdoing\u201d like a virtual incantation.\n\nInstead of a near-religious repetition of a Biden defense, perhaps staff at CNN and NBC could try to get an answer to a simple question: What did Hunter Biden\u2019s overseas associates think they were paying for?\n\n***\n\nFollow James Freeman on Twitter.\n\nSubscribe to the Best of the Web email with one click.\n\nTo suggest items, please email best@wsj.com.\n\n(Teresa Vozzo helps compile Best of the Web.
