Both Osaka and Djokovic are defending champions.\n\nOsaka clearly wasn\u2019t right during the match. Since the start of the Open, she has worn a brace on her left knee. Late in the match, Osaka gingerly moved her left foot when she ran to the left.\n\n\u201cI hurt my knee in Cincinnati, but it\u2019s getting better,\u201d Osaka said. \u201cI just needed to take a painkiller.\u201d\n\nIn her 7-6, 6-4 victory, Bencic had 29 winners and just 12 unforced errors, while Osaka had 26 winners and 21 unforced errors.\n\nBelinda Bencic celebrates her win against Naomi Osaka.

In the third round here, Osaka dumped Cori \u201cCoco\u201d Gauff in a prime-time matchup, and then she comforted Gauff when she was overwhelmed during the post-match festivities.\n\n\u201dIt\u2019s something I have learned over the summer that even if you aren\u2019t playing your best, you\u2019re going to play people who are going to play their best. You have to figure out how to win those matches,\u201d Osaka said on Monday. \u201cI think on that side I have a lot of growing up to do.\u201d\n\nNow that Osaka is gone, Serena Williams is the only player still in the tournament who has won a Grand Slam title. The draw appears favorable for Williams, with No. 5 Elina Svitolina as the only other remaining player in the top 10. Bencic will play against Donna Vekic, who has reached her first major quarterfinal.\n\nWilliams, the eighth seed, is a six-time U.S. Open champion and aiming to win her 24th Grand Slam title, which would tie her with Margaret Court for the most in the sport. Williams hasn\u2019t won a Slam since the Australian Open in 2017, although she has played in three Slam finals since coming back from giving birth to her daughter in Sept. 2017. She has battled injuries to her ankle, knee and back for most of this season.\n\nAshleigh Barty, who lost to No. 18 Wang Quiang in the fourth round, will take over the No. 1 ranking from Osaka after the tournament.\n\nThe loss by Djokovic, who has won four of the past five Grand Slams, increases the possibility of a long-awaited showdown between Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal at the U.S. Open. The longtime rivals have met in the finals of the other three Slams but have never played in New York. Nadal plays 2014 U.S. Open champion Marin Cilic for a spot in the last eight on Monday night.\n\nStan Wawrinka and Novak Djokovic embrace after Djokovic\u2019s retirement from the match on Sunday night.
