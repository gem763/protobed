According to CNN\u2019s report on its poll we do not know exactly the answer to the question because \u201cadult\u201d could mean anyone 18 or older.\n\nThe polling methodology includes some information about respondents \u2014 \u201c30 percent described themselves as Democrats, 26 percent described themselves as Republicans, and 44 percent described themselves as independents or members of another party.\u201d\n\nThey are either likely voters, registered voters, or adults \u2014 the sample is just U.S. adults not registered or likely voters.\n\nNonetheless, CNN\u2019s polling director concludes support for getting rid of Trump is growing even as they report good news for Trump:\n\nHalf of Americans say President Donald Trump should be impeached and removed from office, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS, a new high in CNN polling on the topic and the first time that support for impeachment and removal has significantly outpaced opposition. As support for impeachment has inched upward, however, Trump\u2019s approval ratings overall and for handling major issues have not taken a hit. Overall, 41 percent approve of his handling of the presidency and 57 percent disapprove, similar to his ratings in early September and August polls conducted before the House of Representatives formally launched an impeachment inquiry in late September. The share who say Trump used his office improperly to gain political advantage against a potential 2020 opponent in his interactions with the President of Ukraine stands at 49 percent, about the same as in the September CNN poll. At the same time, more now say Trump did not use the presidency improperly (43 percent up from 39 percent), as the share who are undecided on the question dipped. That shift was largely driven by a 16-point increase in the share of Republicans who say Trump didn\u2019t improperly use the presidency (from 71 percent to 87 percent).\n\nSome obvious political polling numbers: 87 percent of Democrats support impeachment and removal.\n\n\u201cAmong Republicans, just 6 percent say they support impeaching and removing the Republican President, lower than the 14 percent who said so in a September CNN poll,\u201d CNN reported.\n\nIndependents are evenly split at 50 percent, according to CNN.\n\nThe poll notes that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who unilaterally announced the start of an impeachment inquiry and has yet to draft an impeachment resolution and have a House vote, is nonetheless gaining in popularity.\n\n\u201cHer favorability rating stands at its best mark since April 2007, with 44 percent holding a favorable view of her, and 46 percent unfavorable. That increase rests mostly on a shift among independents since May \u2014 32 percent had a favorable view of her then, while 42 percent do now,\u201d CNN reported.\n\nCNN noted in its poll reporting that Trump\u2019s favorability rating is holding steady at 42 percent.\n\n\u201cThe President has also seen his approval ratings for handling top issues hold steady or increase in the last month,\u201d CNN reports. \u201cHis approval rating for handling the economy has rebounded from an early September dip: 52 percent approve on that score, up from 48 percent. His numbers have held about even on immigration and foreign affairs, while ticking up 4 points on foreign trade.\u201d\n\nThe CNN Poll was conducted by SSRS from October 17-20. Results for the entire sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.7 percentage points.\n\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter", "description": "CNN released a poll on Tuesday that found 50 percent of Americans are now in favor of impeaching and removing President Donald Trump.", "authors": ["Penny Starr"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/nc-donald-trump-rally-9919-gettyimages-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
