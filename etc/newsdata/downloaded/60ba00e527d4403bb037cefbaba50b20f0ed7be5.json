From mining coal, the oil and gas boom, to embracing wind power, Halkirk has seen many power shifts in the last century.\n\n\"I would love another oil boom, but what are the chances of that,\" Schulmeister asked.\n\nStill, many people rely on jobs in the oil industry and long for times past, when industry and employment were booming. The Patch 2030 analyzes the impact of the slowdown in the oil and gas sector and how Canada can compete successfully in global markets in the coming decades.", "description": "As Canada tries to balance its oil-reliant economy with its environmental goals, we look at what the polarizing debate means for the future of the country's oilpatch.", "authors": ["Cbc Radio"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.3229734.1504197162!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/junior-oil-patch-facing-tough-fall.jpg"}
