(NOAA/RAMMB)\n\nHurricane Lorenzo is continuing its menacingly mystifying performance after a brief stint as a Category 5 hurricane.\n\nHurricane and tropical storm warnings have been issued for the Azores \u2014 an island chain about 1,000 miles west of Portugal \u2014 as the 105 mph hurricane continues to set records. From there it will churn toward Britain as its dizzying dance draws to a close late week. Until then, dangerous conditions will spread over the Portuguese paradise beginning Tuesday evening.\n\n110mph #Lorenzo chugging along northeast towards The Azores.

Two to four inches of rain is likely for the western Azores, although some places may see a bit more.\n\nDangerous surf and destructive waves are another story.\n\nPortuguese government meteorologists are forecasting a southwesterly swell with 30 to 40 foot seas and occasional waves up to 72 feet. Over the open ocean, individual wave heights may, in the most extreme cases, approach 90 to 100 feet. A number of major transatlantic shipping routes are set to be affected.\n\nSensational, 100+ foot wave heights are forecast to occur near the Azores on Wednesday, associated with Hurricane #Lorenzo.\n\n\n\nWaves don't get much bigger than this.

The first time occurred within a window last Wednesday to Thursday morning, when Lorenzo surged from an 80 mph storm to a 130 mph monster. That brought it to Category 4 status.\n\nAfter some gradual weakening, Lorenzo did it again, strengthening from 115 mph Saturday morning to 160 mph by 11 p.m. It was a wild move by the storm, one not anticipated by the National Hurricane Center or meteorologists across other sectors.\n\nLooking back at the history of NHC intensity forecasts for #Lorenzo and comparing them to the observed intensity, we can see that the first peak was fairly well-anticipated, but the second and even stronger peak was certainly not. https://t.co/FzmsZqi0Bt pic.twitter.com/Wq1Gv4ASlw \u2014 Brian McNoldy (@BMcNoldy) September 29, 2019\n\nAt 10:10 p.m. Saturday, the National Hurricane Center announced Lorenzo became a Category 5 storm, which it then described as \u201cthe strongest hurricane this far north and east in the Atlantic basin.\u201d\n\nLorenzo is now an extremely powerful category 5 hurricane. It is the strongest hurricane on record this far north and east in the Atlantic basin. pic.twitter.com/nUR5ugJws7 \u2014 National Hurricane Center (@NHC_Atlantic) September 29, 2019\n\nAt that time, Lorenzo was located more than 600 miles east-northeast of where any other Category 5 hurricane on record had tracked before, per Sam Lillo, a graduate student at the University of Oklahoma.\n\nLocation of where all Atlantic Category 5 #hurricanes first reached Category 5 strength. #Lorenzo is highlighted in blue. pic.twitter.com/dpQfnEXPty \u2014 Philip Klotzbach (@philklotzbach) September 29, 2019\n\nPhilip Klotzbach, a hurricane researcher at Colorado State University, tweeted a map of all recorded Category 5 origin points. As you can see in the image above, Lorenzo stands alone.\n\nThe climate context\n\nWhile it\u2019s impossible to attribute a single storm to climate change, it\u2019s safe to say the trends exhibited by Lorenzo fit into an overall pattern favoring stronger, and potentially more errant, tropical cyclones.\n\nAccording to NOAA\u2019s Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory, \u201cthe global proportion of tropical cyclones that reach very intense (Category 4 and 5) levels will likely increase due to anthropogenic warming.\u201d A summary of available research suggests \u201crainfall rates will likely increase\u201d as well; warmer atmosphere\u2019s capacity to hold \u2014 and release \u2014 water is rising disproportionately faster than temperatures. Rising sea levels also favor more destructive storm surge threats.\n\nThis projected increase in storm intensity may already be underway.\n\nThe past four seasons, each of which have featured at least one Category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic, lend credence to this likelihood. It\u2019s been a wild and unprecedented four years of hurricane activity, with Matthew, Irma, Maria, Michael, Dorian and now Lorenzo all achieving this elusive \u2014 and terrifying \u2014 status.\n\n#Lorenzo becomes the newest member of the Category 5 club in the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n\n\nTo recap: There have been 26 Category 5 storms in the Atlantic since 1960 (satellite era). Since 2000? 14. Since 2016? 6.\n\n\n\n...and we had a Cat. 5 \"drought\" from 2008-2015. pic.twitter.com/RODbss0ISb \u2014 Steve Bowen (@SteveBowenWx) September 29, 2019\n\nResearch conducted by James Elsner, a professor of meteorology at Florida State University, illustrates that the past four years fit into a much broader increasing trend in Atlantic tropical cyclone strength.\n\nLorenzo also rapidly intensified twice, presenting a forecast challenge to meteorologists in a field where models often fail to adequately predict such dramatic fluctuations in strength. Over the open ocean, it can be chalked up to an imperfect forecast, but rapid intensification can have enormous implications for storms close to shore. Rapid intensification was a key ingredient before landfall in both Harvey and Michael, which caused devastating damage in coastal Texas and Florida respectively.\n\nKerry Emanuel, a hurricane researcher and atmospheric scientist at MIT, wrote a 2017 paper in which he finds \u201cthe incidence of storms that intensify rapidly just before landfall increases substantially as a result of global warming.\u201d Even more alarming is Emanuel\u2019s simulation that storms intensifying 70 mph or more within 24 hours \u2014 which he ascribes as \u201coccurring on average once per century\u201d during the climate of the late 20th century \u2014 may now occur \u201cevery 5-10 years by the end of this century.\u201d\n\nA link between rapid intensification and climate change is well-established across the literature.\n\nMeanwhile, Lorenzo\u2019s peculiar location is significant as well. Lorenzo\u2019s leap to Category 5 strength occurred well outside the historical norm for storms of such strength, coming just two years after Ophelia became the Atlantic\u2019s northeasternmost Category 3 on record.\n\nA 2014 study by several atmospheric scientists found the latitude belt at which hurricanes achieve their maximum strength is slowly shifting poleward, at the rate of 35 to 40 miles per decade. It is unclear whether a link exists between how far east a storm develops and climate change, though of note is the anomalously warm water present in the eastern Atlantic during the time of Lorenzo\u2019s passage.\n\nAll this aside, the latest National Hurricane Center outlook presents some good news regarding upcoming Atlantic tropical activity. Aside from Lorenzo\u2019s slow decline, \u201ctropical cyclone formation is not expected during the next 5 days.\u201d", "description": "It was the farthest north and east Category 5 on record.
