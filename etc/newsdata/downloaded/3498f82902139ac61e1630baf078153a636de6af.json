Maybe learn from them? Your leaders are open about their choices + they *are* choices to be ignorant.\u201d\n\nAnother tweeted: \u201cDid they just compare themselves to Rosa Parks\u2026 Who had PLANNED this action and had a community behind her to support the boycott to limit the damage done to the most affected? Unlike XR? The caucasity.\u201d\n\nDid they just compare themselves to Rosa Parks...

Targeting working class workers using a green form of transport: bad. Invoking Rosa Parks whilst ignoring critique of your very white and racist tactics and rhetoric: truly awful,\u201d another said.\n\nOthers have criticised the comparison for being made during Black History Month.\n\nBritish Transport Police confirmed eight people had been arrested on suspicion of obstructing the railway on Thursday, and also urged commuters not to \u201ctake matters into their own hands\u201d.", "description": "Rosa Parks was a civil rights activist in Montgomery, in the US, arrested in 1955 for refusing to give up her seat to a white passenger on a bus.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/12/wire-19833794-1571311430-786_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
