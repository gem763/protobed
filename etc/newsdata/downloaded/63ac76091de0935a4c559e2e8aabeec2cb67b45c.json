Some 88.7 per cent of that was plastic, the ministry said. Plastic also dominated the waste found below the surface, including on the seabed.\n\nBut Mr Huo insisted overall conditions in the country\u2019s coastal waters, including issues like wastewater entering the seas from rivers, were improving.\n\n\u201cChina is the biggest producer and exporter of plastic products, accounting for about 30 per cent of the world\u2019s total, but that doesn\u2019t mean China is a major marine plastic polluting country,\u201d he told a press briefing in Beijing.\n\nHowever, scientists say China is the world\u2019s leading generator of plastic waste.\n\nIn a study published in May, researchers at Tianjin University warned China\u2019s \u201cmassive impact on the plastic levels of the ocean\u201d was \u201ca definite cause of concern\u201d with \u201cmultiple economic, environmental and biological complications\u201d.\n\nEarlier this year, Beijing published an action plan designed to clean up Bohai Bay, one of the country\u2019s busiest and most polluted waterways, in northeast China.\n\nThe government has earmarked 7 billion yuan (\u00a3770m) for the clean-up this year alone, but Mr Huo said it is still expected to struggle to meet a key target aimed at making at least 73 per cent of Bohai\u2019s waters fit for human contact by next year. At present 70 per cent meets that standard.\n\nChina is planning to make about 30 per cent of its coastal waters completely off-limits to development as part of a national \u201cecological red line\u201d scheme.\n\nBut it is also trying to protect its rivers and improve the environment of its cities by moving polluting industries like steel and petrochemicals to the coast.\n\nAdditional reporting by Reuters", "description": "The amount of plastic polluting China\u2018s coastal waters has soared following a government drive to stop rubbish being dumped in the country\u2019s rivers.
