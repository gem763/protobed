Of course he\u2019d want to kick back and spend some time relaxing on a beautiful secluded island. Good thing his next movie has plenty of sand, sun and (at least one) sociopath. According to The Hollywood Reporter, Raimi is set to direct an as-yet unnamed film from Mark Swift and Damian Shannon, the screenwriters behind 2009\u2019s Friday the 13th reboot and 2003\u2019s Freddy vs. Jason.\n\nThe movie is being described as \u201cMisery meets Cast Away,\u201d suggesting that something similar to Stephen King\u2019s nightmare cat-and-mouse game between an author and his most deranged fan will be transported to the deserted island setting of Robert Zemeckis\u2019 2000 adventure drama. Or, and we\u2019re just spitballing here, it\u2019ll be a shot-by-shot remake of Cast Away, but instead of Wilson the volleyball, it\u2019s just a full-on severed head.", "description": "Evil Dead and Spider-Man director Sam Raimi is set to direct an untitled horror movie set on a tropical island that is being described as Misery meets Cast Away.", "authors": ["Halle Kiefer"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/08/26/19-Sam-Raimi.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
