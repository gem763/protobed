The NPA has insisted over the past five years that there is evidence linking her to this so-called poison plot and that she will be charged as a suspect.\n\n\"Now they confirm that there is no evidence of any plot and there is no evidence of anyone ever been linked to such a plot. She should never have been implicated on this bogus charge.\"\n\nRoux said Ntuli-Zuma was weighing her options.\n\nA letter to the Hawks written by acting KwaZulu-Natal director of public prosecutions, advocate Elaine Zungu, dated September 13, states that there is no evidence that Zuma was poisoned.\n\nIt also states that Zuma has not deposed to an affidavit detailing the alleged poisoning on his life and that she could not refer to him as a complainant.\n\n\"The SSA reports contain no evidence at all that Mr Zuma was poisoned, let alone by whom,\" reads the later.\n\nMaNtuli is the second of Zuma's four wives.\n\nThe Sunday Times reported that in early August 2014, during a trip to the US, doctors diagnosed an ailing Zuma as having been poisoned.\n\nHowever, not trusting US doctors, Zuma went to Russia later that month for treatment. Russian doctors reportedly confirmed the diagnosis.", "description": "Former president Jacob Zuma's wife, Nompumelelo Ntuli-Zuma, is considering legal action against the police and the National Prosecuting Authority, her lawyer told News24 on Friday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/6930/a3ea915b77d64cbbab3527960eed709c.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
