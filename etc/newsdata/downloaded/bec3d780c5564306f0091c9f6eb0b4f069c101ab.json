That\u2019s a guy,\u201d Medley said in the video.\n\n\u201cWith a body like that it\u2019s a guy, you\u2019re absolutely right, Morgan added.\n\n\"With a body like that, it's a guy.\"\n\n\n\nSonja and Dorinda make offensive comments about a transgender model a #NYFW! #RHONY pic.twitter.com/RPl5slwDDS \u2014 Haus of Bravo (@HausOfBravo) September 11, 2019\n\nPetty apparently overheard the comments, and described them later as \u201cdisheartening and disappointing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was really excited to do the fashion show for Garo Sparo for New York Fashion Week because he was using models of diversity, and I knew they were filming the \u2018Housewives of New York\u2019 and I knew they were front row and literally, as I was walking down the runway, I heard them making these statements,\u201d Petty told Page Six in a statement.\n\n\u201cMy philosophy is that people can\u2019t choose their sexual orientation. They can\u2019t choose their gender identity,\u201d she continued. \u201cThey can\u2019t choose or not choose to have a disability or a mental illness or even their race, but things people can choose to do is not to be rude and cruel to people over things they have no control over.\u201d\n\nIn a different video, Morgan can be heard asking Medley, \u201cWho is that?\u201d as \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race\u201d alum Miz Cracker walks by. \u201cOh, that\u2019s a guy, right?\u201d she continued.\n\nThomas Concordia via Getty Images Luann de Lesseps, Ramona Singer, Sonja Morgan, and Dorinda Medley attend Garo Sparo Atelier Runway Show\n\nMedley and Morgan since apologized in a joint statement to Page Six, and cited their history of advocating for LGBTQ causes. Morgan famously has claimed she has raised \u201cmillions\u201d for the LGBTQ community on the long-running reality TV show.\n\n\u201cWe have a history as longstanding supporters of the LGBTQ community in many ways and apologize for our offensive comments at the fashion show,\u201d the two told Page Six Style.\n\nMany Bravo fans have called Andy Cohen, creator and executive producer of the multicity \u201cReal Housewives\u201d franchise, to take action against his stars.\n\nI\u2019ve said it before and I\u2019ll say it again: as someone who is a Bravo superfan, it\u2019s also glaringly apparent to me that the Housewives franchise has a major homophobia and transphobia problem (and has for a long time) https://t.co/6yWloYTNnK \u2014 Serena Daniari (@serenajazmine) September 11, 2019\n\nPlease address the transphobic comments made by sonja an dorinda at the ny fashion show. So many of the trans community are hurt an angry over the crass comments they made. \u2014 sandy (@sandyakambrace) September 11, 2019\n\nSo @Andy gonna act like Eddie Murphy\u2019s 80s stand up was \u201cvery problematic for him when he was coming up\u201d to try to get a sound bite out of @Instatituss... But he still keeps these two on the payroll?\n\n\n\nMhm...https://t.co/SuL7p5Bc0V \u2014 Eamon Paton-Usry (@Eamon2Please) September 11, 2019\n\nI like Sonja and Dorinda, but they deserve to be in hot water for this. #rhony #bravohttps://t.co/IEJtZBVm67 \u2014 Housewives Tonight!
