He didn't play the final after that but he is definitely one of my soldiers.'\n\nPark Ji-Sung (pictured) often played ahead of Evra on the left-hand side for Manchester United\n\nAndrea Pirlo, who Evra played with at Juventus for one season, makes the cut, and the Frenchman had some warm words to say about United stalwarts Paul Scholes and Ryan Giggs.\n\n'When I joined Man Utd, a lot of people asked me who impressed me the most and people were always expecting me to say Wayne Rooney or Cristiano Ronaldo, but Giggs and Scholes were just amazing. They were role models.'\n\nForwards: Cristiano Ronaldo, Carlos Tevez\n\nBy the time Evra arrived at Manchester United from Monaco in January 2006, Cristiano Ronaldo had been at Old Trafford for two-and-a-half seasons.\n\nThe Portuguese has progressed to become one of the greatest players of all time, but is Evra surprised by the extraordinary level the Portuguese has reached?\n\n'Not surprised. I remember when he won his first Ballon d\u2019Or, he said he had to win five,' Evra explained.\n\n'He is the most professional player I\u2019ve ever played with. That's why when we compare him to Messi, I always choose him. Messi is just a gift. God tells him to go and play with us kids, but Cristiano works so hard.\n\nEvra was full of praise for Cristiano Ronaldo, and rates him higher than rival Lionel Messi\n\n'Before he signed for Juve, 20 minutes before, he called me about what it was about. He will still play until he is 40.\u2019\n\nThe most notable omission is Wayne Rooney, who doesn't make the cut due to Carlos Tevez's inclusion.\n\n'This one was a tough choice, Tevez or Wayne Rooney?' admitted Evra.\n\n'But it comes from my heart, even if I am a close friend to Wayne... I played with Tevez in Manchester and Juventus, and what a player. He is a warrior and when we had him and Wayne up front, I was feeling sorry for the defenders.'\n\nManager: Sir Alex Ferguson\n\nUnsurprisingly, Evra's manager for all but one season at Manchester United is his all-time coach.\n\n'People respected Ferguson so much, I was scared of disappointing him. This was really important and we have such a close relationship. When I make a big decision, I definitely call him.'\n\nToughest opponent: James Milner\n\nHe picked James Milner as his toughest opponent due to their battles in the Manchester derby\n\nHowever, the most startling admission from Evra was that he named James Milner as his toughest ever opponent, over Barcelona's Lionel Messi.\n\n'He frustrated me because I\u2019m an attacking defender. I was like 'just go on attack.'\n\n'When I played the derby, I had him always up against me. Messi, I could deal with him.'", "description": "Patrice Evra named his 'ultimate' team-mate XI for clubs he's played at, and alongside a few surprising names on the list, he explained why James Milner was his toughest ever opponent.", "authors": ["Kieran Jackson For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/00/20011946-0-image-a-61_1571699063790.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
