The homicide rate for that age group fell by 23% from 2007 to 2014, but rose by 18% in 2017.\n\nThis reflects overall suicide rates. They\u2019ve risen nearly 30% between 1999 and 2016, the CDC also said last year, citing mental-health issues as one major factor. Between 1999 and 2016, suicide rates increased significantly in 44 states, with 25 states experiencing increases of more than 30%.\n\nAside from mental-health conditions, relationship problems and/or loss, life stressors, plus recent and/or impending crises were common across all groups.\n\nAside from mental-health conditions, relationship problems/loss, life stressors, and recent and/or impending crises were common across all age groups. \u201cSuicides and self-harm injuries cost the nation approximately $70 billion per year in direct medical and work loss costs,\u201d the CDC added.\n\nAnxiety and depression are on the rise among American teenagers.
