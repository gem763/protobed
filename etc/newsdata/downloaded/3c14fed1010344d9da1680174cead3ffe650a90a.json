I think you're a f****** idiot is what I do.'\n\nAll the while the bus driver occasionally interjects expressing his own frustration at the situation - and saying the BMW driver is on the wrong side of the road.\n\nDozens have commented on Mr Joseph's post, some comparing the BMW driver to Pickering - and the cyclist later commented on his post clarifying what happened in the end.\n\nMr Joseph said: 'As much as I wanted to drag him out I didn't. Another guy asked him to move and he did.\n\nThe BMW driver said \"If you had asked me nicely then we wouldnt be in this mess.\"\n\n'The mess started before I got there and I was actually nice to him to start with.\n\n'When I told him \"Come on man, we all have places we need to be\" he told me he didnt give a f***.\n\n'The whole thing that I was involved in probably lasted 15 minutes, who knows how long before I got there.'\n\nDozens have commented on Mr Joseph's post (below), some comparing the BMW driver to Pickering - and the cyclist later commented on his post clarifying what happened in the end (above)\n\nAmong those commenting on the post was Leighton Roberts, who said: 'What an absolute helmet! The obstruction is clearly on his side of the road also.'\n\nWhile Jay Huxtable said: 'How can someone be that much of a c*** and think they're in the right? Utter t***.'\n\nAnd Donna Jones said: 'I hate entitled people like this so much. Just move your poxy car.\n\n'Clearly in the wrong. Fair play to you, there's no way I could have kept my cool like that.'\n\nOthers, including Carl Sergeant, commented on BMW drivers as a whole, saying: 'Typical BMW driver, should have asked him if knew his car had indicators because most don\u2019t.'\n\nMr Joseph's footage has now been shared dozens of times and attracted more than fifty comments. In his post, he asks if anyone knows the BMW driver.", "description": "Elliot Joseph, from Swansea, south Wales, took footage of himself chastising the motorist for holding up traffic.
