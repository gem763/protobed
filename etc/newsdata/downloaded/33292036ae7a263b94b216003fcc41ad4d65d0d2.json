Listening to Queen\u2019s Bohemian Rhapsody inspired him to become a musician\n\nQueen may not be an obvious influence on Radiohead but listening to them as a child kick-started his passion for music. \u201cI started playing when I was seven, eight,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I was obsessed with Queen when Bohemian Rhapsody came out. I lay down in front of these big speakers in my friend\u2019s house and we just listened to Bohemian Rhapsody and at that point I decided, \u2018Yep this is what I\u2019m doing\u2019.\u201d\n\n2. As a child he built his own guitar. It wasn\u2019t amazing\n\nSoon after his Bohemian Rhapsody epiphany, young Yorke decided to build himself a guitar. \u201cIt sort of worked,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was literally rough cut out with a saw, you know \u2013 it was terrible. And then shortly after that my dad felt sorry for me and eventually bought me one.\u201d\n\n3. He was born with his left eye permanently shut, and had multiple surgeries on it as a child, but he likes the fact it is different\n\n\u201cWhen I was born, the left eye was shut: there was no muscle that would open it\u201d he explains. \u201cThis was in the seventies when they\u2019d take a bit of muscle from elsewhere \u2013 in my case my arse \u2013 and they graft it on to make it work.\u201d He had a number of operations but the last one went wrong and he decided against having any more. \u201cAt that point I decided I liked the fact that it wasn\u2019t the same, and I\u2019ve liked it ever since. And when people say stuff I kind of thought it was a badge of pride, and still do.\u201d\n\n4. Radiohead are named after a song by Talking Heads, so there's no surprise that he chooses one of their songs\n\nYorke tells the story of the first time he heard Talking Heads\u2019 1980 album Remain in Light, at the same friend\u2019s house where he had listened to Bohemian Rhapsody. \u201cIt was like a bomb going off in my head; I\u2019d literally never heard anything like it,\u201d he says. \u201cTalking Heads did something with a studio that had never been done before. And even at a young age I could see that.\u201d Despite pleas to be allowed to take the full LP to his desert island, he settles for its opening track, Born Under Punches (The Heat Goes On). \u201cI\u2019ll just have to imagine the rest of the record, won\u2019t I?\u201d he says.\n\n5. He credits two of his teachers with setting him on the career path he is still on today\n\nHe didn\u2019t feel like he fitted in at the all-boys private school he attended. \u201cThe music school and the art school was my sanctuary,\u201d he says. But it was nonetheless where he met the rest of the boys who would go on to form Radiohead, and he credits two of his teachers for giving him the opportunities in that set them on that path. \u201cI guess I was really lucky. Two of these teachers \u2013 the head of the art department and the head of the music department \u2013 saw something in me and were incredibly supportive,\u201d he recalls. \u201cYou don\u2019t realise until afterwards how important that is. I am absolutely convinced that if both those kind men, if they had not done that, I wouldn\u2019t be here today doing this.\u201d", "description": "The Radiohead frontman spoke to Lauren Laverne about his life, and his favourite music.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p07nw5ln.jpg"}
