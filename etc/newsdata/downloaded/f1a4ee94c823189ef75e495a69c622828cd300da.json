Biden.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, California Democrat, launched the start of an impeachment inquiry Tuesday after Mr. Trump acknowledged discussing Mr. Biden during a July phone call with Mr. Zelensky before eventually releasing the assistance to Ukraine.\n\nA rough transcript of the call subsequently issued by the White House shows Mr. Trump asked Mr. Zelensky to \u201cdo us a favor\u201d by investigating Mr. Biden and his son, Hunter, ahead of releasing the aid. Mr. Trump and his defenders have denied it constituted a quid pro quo.\n\nRussians were \u201cinvading a peaceful, democratic country,\u201d and Mr. Trump \u201cwas delaying the self-defense weapons that Ukraine needed,\u201d Mr. Frank said on \u201cReal Time.\u201d\n\nThe United Nations previously assessed that 13,000 people have been killed in eastern Ukraine since Russian-backed separatists seized parts of the country in 2014.\n\nThe White House did not immediately return a message requesting comment.\n\nMr. Frank, 79, retired from Congress in 2013. He held the role of the top Democrat on the key House Financial Services Committee during his last decade in office.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
