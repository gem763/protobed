Houston gave Russell Westbrook another game off while he recovers from knee surgery in the spring, hoping to get the former Oklahoma City point guard onto the floor when it heads to Japan to play a pair of exhibition games against Toronto.\n\nLos Angeles is easing Kawhi Leonard into the season after he led the Raptors to the NBA championship, and Paul George is still recovering from shoulder surgery and not ready for contact. With those two swingmen together, the Clippers are one of the favorites to win their first title.\n\nThey will also give Los Angeles a pair of defensive stoppers to throw at Harden. Without them, the Clippers couldn\u2019t contain the 2018 MVP.\n\nComing off a triple-double on Monday against Shanghai, Harden played 28 minutes and shot only 8 of 22 from the field and 4 for 14 from 3-point range, but hit 17 of 20 free throws.\n\nHe also committed an offensive foul in the first half that Houston coach Mike D\u2019Antoni tried to overturn by using the one challenge coaches get per game this season. Replay showed that Harden hooked his defender\u2019s arm with his right arm while he dribbled with his left hand, so the call was upheld.\n\nThe remainder of the schedule includes Sacramento and Indiana playing the first of their two-game set in India, followed by the Brooklyn Nets hosting Brazilian club Franca. Kyrie Irving is not expected to play after sustaining a facial fracture late last month.\n\nROCKETS 109, CLIPPERS 96\n\nIn Honolulu, rookie guard Chris Clemons scored 15 points and Clint Capela had 14 points and 11 rebounds. Houston finished 11 for 48 from behind the arc, with Ben McLemore making three.\n\nMontrezl Harrell scored 17 points and fellow reserve Lou Williams had 13 in the Clippers\u2019 preseason opener. Rookie Terance Mann had eight points and nine rebounds.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Los Angeles Clippers\u2019 new superstar duo isn\u2019t available yet, and the Houston Rockets aren\u2019t ready to use theirs.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Brian Mahoney"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/04/rockets_clippers_basketball_50651_c0-151-3600-2249_s1770x1032.jpg?86a0ad2941f4f8cac64fde118e16286d6ebd0c8d", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
