Edgar is in a position; he was supposed to fight Aljamain Sterling, and Aljamain fell out, got hurt.\n\n'Frankie's coming to the end of his career and he could end up getting himself into a title position again. So to take the Conor fight makes no sense.'", "description": "Poirier is a potential opponent for McGregor, but the Irishman appears to have his eyes firmly set on facing veteran fighter Frankie Edgar after suggesting the two will meet in December.", "authors": ["Jordan Seward For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/11/19827554-0-image-a-20_1571652854377.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
