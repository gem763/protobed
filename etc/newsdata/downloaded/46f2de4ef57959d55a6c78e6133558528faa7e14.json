Bloomberg\n\n\"The President has abandoned the people who helped us destroy ISIS, chaos is unfolding and when I hear the President: 'We're getting out of Syria.' My statement to you is this is worse than what Obama did,\" Senator Graham said.\n\n\"When Obama left Iraq, all hell broke loose, and if you think Mr President, ISIS is only a threat to Europe, you really don't understand ISIS. ISIS is wanting to come after all of us. Not just Europeans.\"\n\nAsked if this could become Mr Trump's Vietnam, Senator Graham replied, \"No, this is worse.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSenator Graham recounted a meeting two weeks ago with President Erdogan in which he told the Turkish leader that a \"win-win\" would be a situation in which an American-led international force would create a safe zone that would protect Turkey from the Kurds and vice versa.\n\nHe also told President Erdogan \"if you go into Syria and try to deal with this through a military operation, I will crush your economy, you will be putting the American people in a bad spot, you will make us abandon somebody who helped us destroy ISIS \u2013 and you really did a lot to create ISIS by creating open flows of foreign fighters into Syria.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the three top House Republicans \u2013 Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Whip Steve Scalise, and Conference Chair Liz Cheney \u2013 announced that they and dozens of their GOP colleagues would be introducing legislation to impose sanctions against Turkey for its military offensive against US-allied Kurdish forces.\n\nThe legislation is similar to what Senator Graham and Senator Chris Van Hollen have proposed.\n\n\"If Turkey wants to be treated like an ally, it must begin behaving like one. They must be sanctioned for their attacks on our Kurdish allies,\" Ms Cheney said in a statement.\n\nAt his news conference, Senator Graham highlighted that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had asked people to \"pray for the Kurds\".\n\n\"I think he's sending a message to Americans,\" said Senator Graham. \"You need to stand by the Kurds, because if you abandon them, then the forces that oppose us are going to take over Syria.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n70,000 displaced\n\nThe escalating violence sent thousands of civilians on both sides of the Turkish-Syrian border fleeing their homes, and aid agencies warned of a humanitarian crisis, with the United Nations reporting more than 70,000 people already displaced in north-eastern Syria.\n\nThe Syrian National Army, a group of rebel factions backed by Turkey, said it had seized a dozen villages in north-eastern Syria as part of the ground offensive.\n\nKurdish authorities in northern Syria said as many as 10 civilians were killed by Turkish forces, while mortar and rocket fire from Syria left six people dead in Turkey, local officials said.\n\nSyrian residents described mayhem as civilians fled clashes on the border.\n\n\"I had to leave with only the clothes I had on me,\" said Mikael Mohammad, a clothing shop owner from Tal Abyad, which lies a quarter-mile from the Turkish frontier.\n\nMr Mohammad and his family left the town as soon as the bombardment started Wednesday evening. He said they slept outside in a rural area some 40 kilometres farther south.\n\n\"The shelling is barbaric and indiscriminate. We spent the night in the open air among scorpions and snakes,\" he said. \"Everything I rebuilt in the last few years, I may have just lost again.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWashington Post", "description": "One of President Trumps biggest supporters said the situation could be \"Trump's Vietnam\" \u2013 but worse \u2013 as Turkey ignored international protests.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2043%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_67/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/2538d369d8025cc973605ee0409857855e713276", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
