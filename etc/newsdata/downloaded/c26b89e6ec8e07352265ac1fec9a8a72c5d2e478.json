Cory Booker (D-NJ) defended former Vice President Joe Biden Tuesday night at the Democrat presidential debate in Ohio after CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper brought up his son, Hunter Biden, and his Ukraine dealings.\n\nBooker said:\n\nI am having deja vu all over again, first of all, because I saw this play in 2016\u2019s election. We are literally using Donald Trump\u2019s lies and the second issue we cover on this stage is elevating a lie and attacking a statesman. That was so offensive. We should not have to defend ourselves.\n\nBooker added, \u201cThe only person sitting at home that was enjoying that was Donald Trump seeing that we are distracting from his malfeasance and selling out his office.\u201d\n\nCooper asked Biden:\n\nPresident Trump has falsely accused your son of doing something wrong while serving on a company board if Ukraine. I want to point out there\u2019s no evidence of wrongdoing by either one of you. Having said that, on Sunday, you announced that if you\u2019re president, no one in your family will be involved in any foreign businesses. My question is: if it\u2019s not okay for a president\u2019s family to be involved in foreign businesses, why was it okay for your son when you were vice president?\n\n\u201cMy son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong,\u201d Biden responded to Cooper. \u201cI carried out the policy of the United States in rooting out corruption in Ukraine. And that\u2019s what we should be focusing on.\u201d\n\nCooper followed up and asked, \u201cHe admitted he made a mistake and showed poor judgement by serving on the board. Did you make a mistake by letting him?\u201d\n\nBiden then claimed he \u201cnever discussed a single thing with my son about anything having do with Ukraine\u201d and insisted the focus should be on \u201cTrump\u2019s corruption.\u201d", "description": "Cory Booker defended Joe Biden Tuesday night after a CNN moderator brought up his son, Hunter Biden, and his Ukraine dealings.", "authors": ["Kyle Morris"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Booker-Ohio-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
