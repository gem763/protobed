It was not immediately clear what the impact of the Ontario facilities\u2019 closure will be on the company\u2019s operations. The Ontario facilities were once operated by Newstrike Brands, which Hexo acquired in the spring. Hexo had 822 employees as of April 30, according to its last quarterly filing.\n\nThe shutdown and layoffs at Hexo arrive amid a broad downturn in the sector, as cannabis companies in Canada struggle to meet investor expectations and, in some cases, their own \u2014 as in Hexo\u2019s case. The dearth of retail weed stores remains an ongoing issue in Canada as the first anniversary of legal, recreational pot rolled by on Oct. 17. Wall Street analysts have also tamped down expectations for the past several weeks, issuing a wave of price target reductions.\n\nHexo stock closed down 6.3% in regular trading and fell 2% during the after-hours session.\n\nU.S. traded shares of Hexo have dropped 41% in the past three months, as the benchmark S&P 500 index SPX, +0.19% has fallen 0.5%. The ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF MJ, +1.14% has fallen 29% in the past three months and the Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences Index ETF HMLSF, +0.66% dropped 33.5% in the same period.\n\nThe closure was also reported by The Hamilton Spectator, which said the layoffs occurred at a site with two greenhouses in production in Beamsville, Ontario, and another two greenhouses under construction. The newspaper said 100 layoffs occurred at the site.\n\nHexo\u2019s layoffs announced Thursday included the chief manufacturing officer, Arno Groll, and the chief marketing officer, Nick Davies.\n\nThe facility shutdown occurred the day after the Quebec-based licensed cannabis producer said it was raising C$70 million ($53.5 million) in convertible debentures through a private placement and that it was postponing its earning call until Tuesday.\n\nHexo is now expected to report July-quarter results Monday, with a conference call scheduled for Tuesday at 8:30 a.m. Eastern.\n\nAccording to analysts polled by FactSet, Hexo is expected to report losses of C$0.06.\n\nHexo is expected to report sales of C$15 million, up from C$1.4 million in the year-ago period. Earlier in October, Hexo issued a revenue warning, telling investors that it now expected revenue for the July quarter of C$14.5 million to C$16.5 million, well below the then-consensus of C$24.8 million. Hexo also rescinded its fiscal 2020 financial outlook and did not offer a replacement.\n\nHexo\u2019s chief financial officer resigned at the beginning of October.", "description": "As cannabis producer Hexo Corp. heads into earnings next week, it will shut down several facilities it operates nearby Niagara Falls, Ontario as a result of...", "authors": ["Max A.
