This is becoming a political pile on, and regulators risk foreclosing one of the best opportunities in public health, which is to reduce cigarette smoking. \u2026Vaping devices include an array of products from pens to tanks. \u2026The point is to offer the buzz of a cigarette without the combustion of tobacco that releases carcinogens and makes smoking so dangerous. \u2026agencies like Public Health England have said such e-cigs are 95% safer than smokes. \u2026No one wants kids addicted to nicotine, and the question is how to balance these competing equities. It is hardly obvious that banning flavors will keep teens from vaping. \u2026A Juul executive told Congress this summer that a result of exiting convenience stores has been other actors exploiting the vacuum by selling illegal flavor pods. Expect more such unintended consequences. And if the flavor ban doesn\u2019t reduce the number of teen vapers, then what? The next step looks like an even broader ban, which won\u2019t be a net positive to public health. \u2026The question is not whether vaping is healthy\u2014it isn\u2019t\u2014but whether the frenzy against e-cigarettes is moving faster than the evidence. \u2026forgotten in the rush are the 480,000 Americans who die each year from smoking.\n\nIn addition to his attacks on the twin scourges of salt and large-sized drinks, Michael Bloomberg is a leading advocate of vaping restrictions.\n\nJacob Sullum of Reason explains why, if successful, his efforts will cause more death.\n\nFormer New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire busybody who can be counted on to oppose individual freedom in almost every area of life, is launching a prohibition crusade against flavored e-cigarettes. \u2026The premise of Bloomberg\u2019s $160 million campaign, which aims to persuade \u201cat least 20 cities and states\u201d to \u201cpass laws banning all flavored tobacco and e-cigarettes,\u201d is that flavored e-liquids are obviously designed to entice \u201cchildren,\u201d because only children like them. That is demonstrably false. ..Last year, Vaping360, a site aimed at former smokers who have switched to vaping and current smokers who are thinking about it, surveyed readers about their favorite Juul pod flavors. It got more than 38,000 responses, and the top pick by far was Mango (46 percent), followed by Cool Mint (29 percent), Cr\u00e8me Brul\u00e9e (11 percent), and Fruit Medley (8 percent). \u2026Surveys of former smokers find that flavor variety plays an important role in the process of switching to vaping. The Food and Drug Administration has acknowledged \u201cthe role that flavors\u2026may play in helping some smokers switch to potentially less harmful forms of nicotine delivery.\u201d \u2026Bloomberg has \u201ccommitted nearly $1 billion to aid anti-tobacco efforts.\u201d Now he is committing $160 million to pro-tobacco efforts, lobbying for laws that will drastically reduce the alternatives to conventional cigarettes, resulting in more smoking-related disease and death.\n\nRobert Verbruggen also explains cost-benefit analysis in his column for National Review.\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s Food and Drug Administration is gearing up to ban e-cigarette flavorings besides the ones that taste like tobacco. It\u2019s unclear if this would have any benefits for public health. \u2026Upstart products such as e-cigarettes, which deliver nicotine without all the tar and other nasty chemicals that cigarettes contain, and are estimated to be 95 percent safer as a result. \u2026even for minors it\u2019s far better to vape than to puff Camels, and it\u2019s not as if no adult enjoys, say, strawberry flavoring. Better taste is one reason to vape instead of smoke for pretty much anyone who has to decide between the two, and if e-cigs are limited to tobacco flavoring, this rule could push some people back toward traditional cigarettes. And if real cigarettes are 20 times as dangerous as e-cigs, it doesn\u2019t take much switching to cancel out the benefit of a reduction in vaping.\n\nBut I also like his article because he points out that this is another example of the \u201cadministrative state\u201d in action.\n\n\u2026this is not a decision that Congress ever should have left in the executive branch\u2019s hands. \u2026in 2009 Congress, in its infinite wisdom, gave the FDA the authority to regulate tobacco products \u2014 except for all the products that were already on the market. This meant that the agency would have authority over upstart products competing with cigarettes, but the rules would not apply to cigarettes themselves. \u2026\u2026Congress should write laws, especially laws that ban entire product categories, not turn that power over to unelected busybodies who will opt for regulation over personal freedom every single time they encounter a choice between the two.\n\nBest of all, he makes the libertarian argument that people should enjoy liberty.\n\nWhat is clear is that it will be a disaster for personal freedom\u2026 Smoking cigarettes is one of those things that we allow adults to do even though it\u2019s obviously bad for them, causing numerous cancers and other health problems. \u2026It\u2019s a free country. \u2026One does not need to be a dyed-in-the-wool libertarian to be disgusted at this affront to personal freedom and responsibility. \u2026Adults should be free to do what they want, so long as they take responsibility for the consequences of their actions. That includes smoking. And it definitely includes the far safer alternative of vaping fruit-flavored e-juice.\n\nAmen.\n\nI think the utilitarian argument for vaping is strong. As this visual from an anti-cancer group in the U.K. notes, it passes a cost-benefit test for savings lives.\n\nBut utilitarianism isn\u2019t everything.\n\nI can\u2019t resist also unleashing my inner libertarian as we conclude today\u2019s column.\n\nThe bottom line is that people should be allowed to take risks. They should even be allowed to make dumb choices.\n\nThat includes drug use, sugary drinks, gambling, over-eating, smoking, voting for socialists, hang gliding, alcohol usage, and standing between a politician and a TV camera.\n\nIt\u2019s called freedom.", "description": "Moral panics in Washington are not a recipe for good .09/27/2019 12:18:54PM EST.", "authors": ["Daniel J.
