For anyone who has subscribed to Apple Music, the music store will now be hidden on the Mac.\n\nSidelining the all-in-one iTunes in favour of separate apps for music, video and other services will let Apple build features for specific types of media and better promote its TV streaming and music services to help offset slowing sales of iPhones.\n\nIn the early days, iTunes was simply a way to get music onto Apple\u2019s marquee product, the iPod music player.\n\nUsers connected the iPod to a computer, and songs automatically synced \u2014 simplicity unheard of at the time.\n\nApple launched its iTunes Music Store in 2003, two years after the iPod\u2019s debut.\n\nWith simple pricing at launch \u2014 99 cents a single, 9.99 US dollars for most albums \u2014 many consumers were content to buy music legally rather than seek out sketchy sites for pirated downloads.\n\nBut over time, iTunes software expanded to include podcasts, e-books, audiobooks, movies and TV shows.\n\nIn the iPhone era, iTunes also made backups and synced voice memos. As the software got bloated to support additional functions, iTunes lost the ease and simplicity that gave it its charm.\n\nAnd with online cloud storage and wireless syncing, it no longer became necessary to connect iPhones to a computer \u2014 and iTunes \u2014 with a cable.\n\nThe way people listen to music has changed, too. The US recording industry now gets 80% of revenue from paid subscriptions and other streaming.\n\nIn the first half of 2019, paid subscriptions to Apple Music and competing services rose 30%, while revenue from digital downloads fell nearly 18%.\n\nThe Mac\u2019s new Music app, which gets the old iTunes icon, is the new home for music.\n\nThat includes songs previously bought from the iTunes store or ripped from CDs, as well as Apple\u2019s free online radio stations. It is also the home for Apple\u2019s music subscription.\n\nApple Music subscribers will no longer see the iTunes music store, unless they restore it in settings.\n\nNon-subscribers will see the store as a tab, along with plenty of ways to subscribe to Apple Music.\n\nThe iTunes store for TV shows and movies will still be prominent on Macs, though now as part of the TV app. Video available to buy or rent will be mixed in with other movies and shows \u2014 including exclusive offerings through Apple TV Plus.", "description": "In the early days, iTunes was simply a way to get music onto Apple\u00b4s marquee product, the iPod music player.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/20/wire-19410866-1570476534-881_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
