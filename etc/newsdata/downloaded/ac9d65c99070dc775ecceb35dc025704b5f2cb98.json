I want the best for you because I know that\u2019s exactly what Botham would want. And the best would be to give your life to Christ. I\u2019m not going to say anything else. I think giving your life to Christ would be the best thing that Botham would want you to do. Again, I love you as a person and I don\u2019t wish anything bad on you.\u201d\n\nEchoing his younger son\u2019s remarks, Brandt\u2019s father responded: \u201cI felt the same way. I wish I could\u2019ve extended the same courtesy. That is what Christ would want us to do \u2026 If you will not forgive, neither will your father [in heaven] forgive you. I don\u2019t want to see her rot in hell. I don\u2019t want to see her rot in prison. I hope this will help her to change \u2026\u201d\n\nPresiding Judge Tammy Kemp responded by stepping off the bench and handing Guyger her personal Bible. She said: \u201cYou haven\u2019t done so much that you can\u2019t be forgiven. You did something bad in one moment of time. What you do now matters.\u201d Summarizing, she then whispered in Guyger\u2019s ear, \u201cMa\u2019am, it\u2019s not because I am good. It\u2019s because I believe in Christ. None of us are worthy.\u201d\n\nThis is the heart of the Gospel.\n\nNone of us are worthy. None of us are good. All of us are sinners, and I am chief among them. We all are broken, and if we think we are justified, we stand condemned already.\n\nBut in spite of all this, Jesus has atoned for us. In fact, he gave his very life for us: \u201cBut God commendeth his love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.\u201d\n\nThe good news of the Gospel is that we can rise above resentment and revenge and become new creations in Christ. We don\u2019t have to let others control us. We don\u2019t have to be enslaved by perpetual victimization. We do not have to be held in bondage by the sins of others or the sins we find in ourselves.\n\nWe can forgive. We can be forgiven. We can be saved!\n\nSaved from anger.\n\nSaved from vengeance.\n\nSaved from self-righteousness.\n\nSaved from self.\n\nJesus made it clear that we should all pray, \u201cforgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us.\u201d He says further, \u201cFor if you forgive men their trespasses, your Heavenly father also will forgive you; but if you do not forgive men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.\u201d Finally, Christ, models this by praying, even at the point of torturous death, \u201cFather forgive them, for they know not what they do.\u201d\n\nJesus could not be more clear. We need to be forgiven, and we need to forgive. Only forgiveness breaks the cycle of sin.\n\nMartin Luther said, \u201cFor still our ancient foe, doth seek to work us woe; His craft and power are great, and armed with cruel hate, on earth is not his equal.\u201d\n\nJohn Newton cried, \u201cThere are two things I know: I am a great sinner, and Jesus is a great savior \u2026 Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me.\u201d\n\nThe cycle of \u201ccruel hate\u201d is only broken by grace; God\u2019s toward you, and yours toward others. And grace is only made real through the act of forgiveness.\n\nEndnote: Antithetical to this beautiful testimony of Brandt Jean, there was the ugly gunge of anger and resentment waiting on the steps just outside Wednesday\u2019s courtroom. Chants of \u201cNo justice, no peace\u201d rang out. \u201cHow many of us does it take to get justice?\u201d One pastor even shouted, \u201cIt\u2019s amazing how quickly injustice can be seized from the hands of justice. This is a travesty.\u201d\n\nBut Brandt Jean clearly understands something this pastor and his protesters do not. The story of his brother is not one of recompense or payback. Botham\u2019s story is not about demanding justice. It\u2019s about granting forgiveness. Or, as Brandt so beautifully said, it\u2019s about \u201cgiving your life to Christ [because that] would be the best thing that Botham would want you to do.\u201d\n\nJudge Kemp offered her closure to this story by saying, \u201cThank you [Brandt] for the way you modeled Christ.\u201d But, if you listen very carefully, you might actually hear Jesus extending his perfect summary: \u201cWell done, thou good and faithful servant. Well done.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Everett Piper, former president of Oklahoma Wesleyan University, is a columnist for The Washington Times and author of \u201cNot A Day Care: The Devastating Consequences of Abandoning Truth\u201d (Regnery 2017).\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
