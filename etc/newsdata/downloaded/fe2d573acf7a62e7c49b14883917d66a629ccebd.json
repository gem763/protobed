The key to avoiding this is by budgeting effectively and seeking out the lesser known, less-costly and mayhap more memorable experiences.\n\nStandard Bank has some key budgeting tips to help get you started, these include:\n\nGet all the info \u2013 Keep track of your income, tax and spending patterns. Know where you are going and what you\u2019d like to do and buff out your itinerary in advance.\n\nDo the math \u2013 Once you have this, start crunching the numbers and working out what your regular monthly expenditure is and how much of a cash cushion you have left.\n\nMake some changes \u2013 Split your expenses into two main categories \u2013 your fixed costs (bills) and your flexible expenses (groceries, petrol etc.) \u2013 so that you can control the flexible category for your travel activities without affecting your fixed costs.\n\nBe committed \u2013 Write down your budget plan or stick it up on your fridge as a reminder so that you don\u2019t slack too much and inhibit the enjoyment of your planned itinerary activities.\n\nTrack your process \u2013 Check in with your budget regularly \u2013 at least once a month \u2013 to ensure you\u2019re on par with your savings and budget plan.\n\nNow that your budget has been sorted and is on track... Here are some must-do Japan activities that won\u2019t completely break the bank:\n\nKick back in Japanese gardens and parks\n\nOn weekends, the local parks are known to come to life and burst with vibrancy and fun as locals come through in costumes, dance and perform and set an overall fun and entertaining atmosphere.\n\nWatch a Sumo Practice\n\nWhere better to soak up Sumo culture than in Japan? You\u2019ll find that some training facilities in Tokyo allow visitors to sit in on and spectate practice sessions \u2013 often for free.\n\nKeep shrining\n\nSoak up the richness of Buddhist culture in Japan as you visit some of its most beloved shrines and temples \u2013 from the popular Senso-ji Temple in Tokyo to the breath-taking plush Kiyomizu-dera Temple in Kyoto.\n\n\n\n\n\nTake a trip to the past through Japanese old towns\n\nWhile Japan is known for its technological and innovative growth that thrives in its neon concrete jungle cities, there is also a reflective side to the country that shows the beauty of Japanese cultural roots. Some old towns you can visit for a day to soak up some energy include: Kawagoe, Nara, Hida-Takayama and Magome to name a few.\n\n\n\n\n\nVisit an organic tea farm beside Mount Fuji\n\nThere\u2019s magic brewing beside Mount Fuji that is merely amplified from the iconic natural monument\u2019s presence.
