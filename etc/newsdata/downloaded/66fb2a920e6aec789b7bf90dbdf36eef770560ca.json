a red line for Mr Johnson.\n\nCrucially that means that the province can benefit from any future trade deals struck by the government after Brexit.\n\nHowever, Northern Ireland will remain an entry point into the EU's customs zone which means that UK authorities will apply UK tariffs to products entering Northern Ireland, but only if they are not earmarked for onward transportation across the border.\n\nFor goods at risk of entering the single market, the UK will collect EU tariffs on behalf of the bloc.\n\nEffectively this means creating a customs border in the Irish Sea between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.\n\nThe key line from the deal states the two sides are 'underlining their firm commitment to no customs and regulatory checks or controls and related physical infrastructure at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.'\n\nIt also states unequivocally that 'Northern Ireland is part of the customs territory of the United Kingdom'.\n\nHow will MPs react to this change?\n\nDeleting the backstop has been a demand of hardline Tory Brexiteer MPs ever since the protocol first emerged.\n\nHowever, many of those MPs have previously taken their voting cue on Brexit from the DUP which has already said it cannot support the proposed way forward from the PM.\n\nThe unionist MPs are against any proposal which would see Northern Ireland treated differently to the rest of the UK - erecting a customs border in the Irish Sea undoubtedly falls foul of that principle.\n\nThe question now is whether Tory Eurosceptic MPs join the DUP in saying they will not vote for the plan. If they do Mr Johnson will be in big trouble and his hopes of getting the deal through parliament will shrink.\n\nWhat about regulations?\n\nMuch the same as the backstop, Northern Ireland will remain aligned with single market regulations on all goods.\n\nBut the checks and procedures on such goods will take place at ports and airports in Northern Ireland and not at the land border.\n\nThe UK authorities will therefore assume responsibility for applying the EU rules in Northern Ireland.\n\nWhat about the thorny issue of consent?\n\nThis is one of the major differences in terms of how the new deal differs to the old one agreed by Mrs May.\n\nEffectively what has been agreed is that the Northern Ireland Assembly will be given a say on what should happen with the Irish border after Brexit.\n\nWhat happens next in the Brexit process? WHAT HAPPENS TONIGHT? Boris Johnson will arrive in Brussels this afternoon to attend an EU summit. European leaders will be presented with the proposed Brexit deal agreed by the EU and the UK and they will then be asked to rubber-stamp it. Mr Johnson has been lobbying other leaders hard to create a 'cliff edge' to improve his chances of getting the deal approved by MPs. That would mean essentialy will shift to the House of Commons. WHAT HAPPENS ON SATURDAY? Parliament is due to sit on Saturday when Mr Johnson will present his deal to MPs and ask MPs to vote for it. Without the support of the DUP it remains unclear whether he will be able to secure a majority. If he does win the vote then the UK will be on course for an orderly departure from the EU on October 31. WHAT HAPPENS IF MPS DON'T BACK THE DEAL ON SATURDAY? If he falls short and sees his deal defeated then Mr Johnson will be legally required to write to the EU to ask for a Brexit delay. COULD BRITAIN STILL LEAVE THE EU ON OCTOBER 31 He will then have to decide what to do next: Try to renegotiate an improved version of the deal or switch to calling for a No Deal Brexit. If he does the latter, believing that the EU will not budge any further, then he will likely need to force an early election to deliver it. WHEN WILL THERE BE AN ELECTION Opposition leaders have said that once a No Deal Brexit on Halloween is ruled out they will support an election. That means there could be a vote on going to the country early at the start of next week with a polling day at the end of November or the beginning of December. The one thing that could dramatically alter the above is whether Remain-backing MPs are able to force and win a vote on Saturday on holding a second referendum.\n\nThe customs arrangements outlined above will come into effect at the start of 2021 and, after an initial four-year period, Stormont Assembly members will be given a vote on whether to continue to apply them.\n\nSignificantly, that vote will be conducted on a simple majority head count and will not require the support of a majority of unionists and a majority of nationalists.\n\nThis means the DUP will not have the chance to exercise a veto. If the vote is carried, the arrangements will be extended for another four years.\n\nIf it transpires that a majority of unionists and a majority of nationalists do ultimately vote in favour of the move, then the extension period will be for eight years.\n\nThe document states: 'Where the decision reached in a given period had cross-community support, the subsequent period is the 8-year period following that period.'\n\nIf members vote to come out of the EU arrangements there would be a two-year cooling off period before that happened in order for a new way forward to be hammered out.\n\nSo basically the assembly would vote every four years on whether to stick with the arrangements or try something else.\n\nHow will MPs react to this proposal?\n\nThe consent issue emerged as perhaps the biggest sticking points in the talks in recent weeks.\n\nUnder initial proposals put forward by Mr Johnson the DUP would have been given an effective veto on the border arrangements.\n\nBut the compromise in today's deal that the vote in the assembly will only require a simple majority means the DUP would have significantly less influence over the process than it would have wanted.\n\nCombine disappointment over consent with the anger over the customs plans and the DUP appears incredibly unlikely to change its stance.\n\nMr Johnson may be able to win a vote in the Commons without the support of the DUP's 10 MPs.\n\nBut the big question now is how Tory Eurosceptics respond to the DUP's move.\n\nThe VAT issue had only emerged as a potential stumbling block as the talks neared a conclusion.\n\nAnd what about VAT?\n\nThe VAT issue had only emerged as a potential stumbling block as the talks neared a conclusion.\n\nWhat has been agreed would mean that EU rules on value added tax and excise duties will apply in Northern Ireland, with the UK responsible for their collection.\n\nHowever, revenues derived will be retained by the UK. The UK will also be able to apply VAT exemptions and reduced rates in Northern Ireland that are applied in Ireland.\n\nWill the UK still have to pay the Brexit divorce bill?\n\nYes. The previously agreed settlement on citizens' rights after Brexit and payment of the \u00a339 billion divorce bill stay as they were.\n\nThat also goes for a transition period of 14 months until the end of 2020, which can be extended by one year or two years.", "description": "Boris Johnson today agreed a Brexit deal with the European Union as he kept his hopes of taking the UK out of the bloc on October 31 alive.", "authors": ["Jack Maidment", "Deputy Political Editor For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/15/19840936-0-image-a-12_1571321204550.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
