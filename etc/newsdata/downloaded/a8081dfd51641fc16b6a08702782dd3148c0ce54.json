Allan Hubley wrote: \"Some of the comments made over the past couple of weeks in the media, or on social media are helping to destroy any remaining confidence our ridership has in the system.\"\n\nBeing told to quiet down or only ask questions in private doesn't stand well with me. - Coun. Riley Brockington\n\nHubley also accused them of distorting news about delays and malfunctions, scaring the public.\n\nCoun. Riley Brockinton, a member of the transit commission, said he believes Hubley is under pressure, but didn't appreciate his comments.\n\n\"At the end of the day, transit commissioners are here to advocate on behalf of OC Transpo bus and train riders, as well as the taxpayers who pay the bills,\" he said.\n\n\"Being told to quiet down or only ask questions in private doesn't stand well with me.\"\n\nCoun.
