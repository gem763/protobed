However, prior to the devastation, Luke Morgan (Gary Lucy) learns a shocking secret as the day of DJ\u2019s christening arrives, while Breda McQueen (Moya Brady) toys with the idea of letting prisoner Tony Hutchinson (Nick Pickard) walk free.\n\nIn the coming episodes, Luke comes to learn the truth about DJ\u2019s parentage, and he\u2019s shocked as a result. On the revelation, actor Gary Lucy said: \u2018It completely spins him out. He feels a whole mix of emotions, he feels betrayed by Ollie and Cindy. As a father, I can relate to how heart breaking it must feel to have lost out on all of the times with baby DJ, the big moments.\u2019\n\nHowever, in spite of Luke having realised that DJ is his son, he decides against revealing the truth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGary said: \u2018As hard as it is I think Luke makes the right call and realises that it\u2019s the right thing to do, to not break up the family unit that is forming with Darren and Mandy. Plus, he\u2019s fallen off the wagon at this point so he\u2019s not sure if he is capable of being the dad that the baby deserves.\u2019\n\nLuke is invited to DJ\u2019s christening, and ultimately, he decides to attend \u2014 although he promises not to cause any trouble. However, problems later ensue when he comes to the realisation that Cindy (Stephanie Waring) was aware of the truth and failed to let him know. How will he react?\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nThat\u2019s not the only drama taking place in the village prior to the chaos, as Breda begins to fear that her family will soon discover the truth, and thus she comes to believe that there\u2019s no other option than for Tony to die.\n\nHowever, Tony pleads for his life, and manages to convince the serial killer that she could hand herself in and, in effect, let him go. We know that Breda toys with the idea, but whether or not she follows through has yet to be revealed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWill Breda agree to let Tony go home to his family?\n\nHollyoaks continues Friday 25th October at 7pm on E4.\n\nMORE: Hollyoaks spoilers: Charlie and Ella killed as a result of Cindy Cunningham\u2019s actions?\n\nMORE: Hollyoaks spoilers: Mitchell Deveraux dies amid stunt week devastation after dumping Cleo McQueen for Scott Drinkwell?\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Secrets are aplenty during Hollyoaks' biggest week of the year, as Luke makes a discovery, while Breda toys with the idea of freeing Tony.", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/HO-EP-5288-HOLLYOAKS-STUNT-11-795f_1571929411.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
