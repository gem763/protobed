No timetable was given for the decision. The department said it is also mulling bringing back the 20-year bond and a new one-year floating rate note tied to the Secured Overnight Financial Rate (SOFR) an alternative to the U.S. dollar London interbank offered rate (Libor).\n\nWhat happened: Treasury made the announcement about possible new products when announced it will auction $84 billion in notes and bonds next week in its quarterly refunding auctions, unchanged from the previous auction in July.\n\nThe department will auction $38 billion in 3-year notes TMUBMUSD03Y, -1.47% on Nov. 5 and $27 billion TMUBMUSD10Y, -1.44% in 10-year notes on Nov. 6. The government will also sell $19 billion in 30-year bonds TMUBMUSD30Y, -1.50% on Nov. 7.\n\nThe offerings will refund about $60.5 billion of Treasury notes and other government paper and will raise $23.5 billion in cash.\n\nBig picture: Large institutional traders have been pushing for a 20-year bond but have been more sceptical about 50-year debt.\n\nIn other news, Treasury said it intends to maintain coupon issuance sizes at current levels over the upcoming quarter. Analysts said they thought Treasury can maintain coupon auction sizes at current levels into 2020 and meet unexpected increase in financing needs with additional bill issuance.\n\nThe department said little about the Federal Reserve\u2019s plan to buy $60 billion per bills per month.\n\nA Treasury official said the Fed plan was at a \u201cvery early\u201d stage and the department was monitoring it. The department was not making any changes to its bill offering as a result of the central bank program.\n\nMarket reaction: The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note edged back to 1.829% in early trading from 1.835% late Tuesday.", "description": "The U.S. Treasury said Wednesday it is exploring offering 20-year and 50-year bonds.", "authors": ["Greg Robb", "Senior Economics Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HF039_treasu_ZG_20190305103835.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
