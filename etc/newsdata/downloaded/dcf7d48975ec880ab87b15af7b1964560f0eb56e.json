McConnell said such silence 'would be good therapy for a number of them.'\n\nThe Clinton trial lasted six weeks. One dramatic moment came when Democrat Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia - who was appalled by Clinton's behavior but concluded it didn't merit conviction and removal from office - received a vote on a motion to dismiss the case.\n\nByrd lost, but it demonstrated that there was no way the Democratic president would be convicted by the required two-thirds majority of the Senate.\n\nMcConnell told Republicans that under the rules a motion to dismiss might be made this time by President Donald Trump's defense team. That could cut any trial short.\n\nThe Clinton trial featured fits and starts, but ultimately, the top Democrats and Republicans in the chamber developed a set of rules and procedures to guide their deliberations.\n\nMoment of history: This was the Senate trial of Bill Clinton unfolding - with Ed Bryant, then a GOP House member from Tennessee presenting evidence against the president\n\nMcConnell had vowed in a fundraising pitch that 'the way impeachment stops is with a Senate majority with me as majority leader.'\n\nIn fact, all it would take is 34 of the 53 Republicans in the chamber to vote 'not guilty' to acquit Trump, which is commonly seen right now as a foregone conclusion.\n\nRepublican Sen. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota said, 'One of the hardest things for senators to accept is they are not in charge of their own chamber.'\n\nAdded Cramer: 'I hope we don't have to live through it. I hope we can just read about the last one.'\n\nIn the House GOP Whip Steve Scalise invited GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham, who was an impeachment manager decades ago during President Bill Clinton's impeachment, to brief Republican lawmakers on the process ahead.", "description": "McConnell warned of a possible House impeachment vote by Thanksgiving that would force a trial in the Senate, likely by Christmas as he briefed Republican senators privately.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/13/19837278-0-image-a-23_1571317039900.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
