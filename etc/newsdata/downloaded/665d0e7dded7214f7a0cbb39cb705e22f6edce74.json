This myth-making scares workers in the present, and sparks proposals that should scare markets for the future.\n\nLike, what?\n\nRobot reaction\n\nBegin with the worst: The notion that automation is robbing the economy of millions of jobs. Relying on a Brookings Institution study that says 61% of U.S. jobs face high or medium exposure to automation in coming decades, candidates are proposing everything from universal basic income to limitations on trade.\n\nNews: Trump bashes Pelosi, Democrats during Texas rally\n\nYang, who brandished the Brookings study, and Warren, who engaged Yang in a long argument about whether automation or trade was doing more to kill jobs in a nearly full-employment economy, the candidates tried to outdo each other, declaring the economy broken and vowing to spend, in some cases, trillions of dollars on badly targeted \u201ccures.\u201d\n\nWow. This is so untrue it basically hurts.\n\nFirst, you know automation is happening when productivity rises. The point of automation is to raise the amount of output each worker can generate by supplementing their labor with machines. If productivity grows faster than sales of goods these workers make, fewer workers will be necessary. If sales rise faster than productivity, firms need fewer new hires to meet fresh demand, and will pocket more of the new revenue as profit.\n\nIf that sounds harsh, consider this: Productivity is where raises come from, as companies and workers divide these gains\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing \u2014 growth has been terrible for the past decade or more. Business investment growth (which leads to productivity growth) has been spotty, too, as companies pulled back after the dot-com crash, again during the 2008 financial crisis, and more recently (and modestly) in reaction to President Donald Trump\u2019s trade clashes with China and others.\n\nNot happening\n\nThis means that the wave of job-killing automation hasn\u2019t happened. The 3.5% unemployment rate might have been a clue.\n\nYang, for his part, is more concerned about future job losses. He argued that driverless trucks alone will cost 3 million U.S. jobs and artificial intelligence will claim many more. It\u2019s not hard to read futurists claiming AI will replace everyone from office workers to doctors.\n\nBut let\u2019s unpack the trucking claim illustratively.\n\nAutonomous trucks aren\u2019t here. There are pilots and tests, but autonomous vehicles are far from ready for day-to-day use \u2014 much farther than hype for Uber Technologies UBER, -1.72% , TSLA, -1.92% and others (remember Apple AAPL, +0.48% Car buzz?) has suggested.\n\nWhen Uber went public this year, CEO Dara Khosrowshahi dampened speculation about how fast Uber would be able to replace drivers \u2014 even though that\u2019s key to an inflection in Uber\u2019s profits. That\u2019s one reason Uber is down 25% since its IPO. Tesla\u2019s few orders for electric semi trucks are for models that use AI-like technologies to assist drivers, not replace them. And the number of truck drivers is steady to growing modestly, Labor Department data say.\n\nTake away Yang\u2019s assumptions about tech-driven job loss, and the case for a universal basic income to supplement wages lost collapses. (If you think jobs pay too little to live on, raise the $7.25 an hour minimum wage and re-empower unions).\n\nSkeptical of free trade\n\nWarren and Sanders also remain skeptical of free trade \u2014 listening to the argument at this week\u2019s Democratic debate about whether trade or automation costs more jobs, when both are job-additive, was pretty rich. Indeed, the slowdown in exports this year is the biggest factor that has the U.S. looking at an economic slowdown.\n\nThe argument that capitalism\u2019s a con leads naturally into the idea that government knows best, and vastly more economic decisions should be left to it.\n\nSanders\u2019s corporate governance plan, announced this week, would put Washington in charge of who should own public companies, by mandating that 20% of each public company belong to workers. It would ban stock buybacks, assuming an 86--year old president (in Sanders\u2019s second term) knows better than CEOs how to use capital at specific firms. And he would bar private health insurance because it\u2019s all just greed anyway.\n\nAll this risks upending a system \u2014 capitalism, you\u2019ve heard of it \u2014 that has delivered, by far, the world\u2019s highest living standards for many years. And these and other policies would reorient what remains the developed world\u2019s fastest-growing large economy.\n\nWhat\u2019s needed is much more measured change.\n\nBarack Obama reduced income inequality by modestly raising taxes on the rich and putting in near-universal health insurance, even if the government doesn\u2019t provide all insurance. A $15 minimum wage would boost pay for 33.5 million workers, according to the Economic Policy Institute. Without trillions of government spending. A two-worker household at that minimum would pull in $54,600 a year (assuming 35 hours a week \u2014 not bad for minimum wage. Even $12 would restore the working class\u2019s lost ground.\n\nPragmatism\n\nCommon-sense solutions \u2014 minimalist liberalism, if you need a new term \u2014 is practical, sellable to voters and achievable in a mixed economy. Many of Warren\u2019s ideas fit this mold, even as others don\u2019t.\n\nSubsidized child care, for example, would boost working families\u2019 effective earnings with money raised by a tax increase on higher incomes \u2014 taxes Trump cut, to little economic benefit. So would tuition-free university education \u2014 as many states once offered.\n\nAnswers like this flow naturally from seeing the economy as it actually is \u2014 imperfect, but hardly collapsing.\n\nPolitically, it\u2019s easier to sell a view of the economy that matches what people see around them. And that\u2019s the best path to making sure Trump doesn\u2019t win four more years.", "description": "The sheer amount of loose talk from Democrats about how capitalism is failing is stunning.", "authors": ["Tim Mullaney"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT613_yang_w_ZG_20191018101233.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
