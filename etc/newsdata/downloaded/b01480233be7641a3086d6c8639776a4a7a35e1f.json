Although blackberries are in full season, it\u2019s hard to pick enough from the hedgerows to make a whole crumble. Instead of mixing them with apple to bulk them out, toss them into this cake instead and top with the irresistible crumble mix. Happy blackberrying.\n\nSpiced blackberry and crunchy brown sugar crumble cake\n\nAs you would a crumble, serve with lots of thick, cold cream, preferably from a small, local dairy (check out the difference in flavour!) or with ice-cream, if you prefer.\n\nPrep 30 min\n\nCook 1 hr\n\nServes 6\n\n120g butter, at room temperature, plus extra to grease\n\n275g light brown sugar\n\n2 free-range eggs\n\n250g plain flour\n\n1 tsp baking powder\n\n1 tsp ground cinnamon\n\n10 black peppercorns, ground\n\n10 allspice berries, ground\n\n2 tsp ground ginger\n\n\u00bd tsp salt\n\n200g sour cream\n\n\u00bd tsp vanilla essence\n\n300g blackberries\n\nFor the crumble\n\n115g demerara sugar\n\n60g plain flour\n\n60g cold butter\n\nHeat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/ 350F/gas 4 and grease a 21cm cake tin.

Add the eggs one at a time, beating in between, until mixed.\n\nThomasina Miers' recipe for spinach and feta filo pie | The Simple Fix Read more\n\nIn a separate bowl, sift together the dry ingredients, then fold half into the creamed butter. Fold in the sour cream and vanilla, followed by the remaining dry mix. Pour half the batter into the baking dish, scatter with the blackberries, then pour the rest of the batter on top, making sure the blackberries are fully submerged.\n\nNext, rub together the crumble ingredients in a large bowl until they resemble large breadcrumbs. Scatter over the top of the batter and bake for 50-60 minutes, until golden. Leave to cool for 10 minutes before serving.\n\nAnd for the rest of the week\n\nMake drop scones at the weekend using the sour cream, blackberries and spices \u2013 they are the most delicious breakfast and take very little time. The crumble cake works well with apples or pears as well as blackberries. Blackberries are also a perfect match for game, particularly pigeon and venison.", "description": "Bulk up the bounty of blackberry season with a crunchy crumble topping \u2013 and not an apple in sight", "authors": ["Thomasina Miers"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1475be549ce160ffe8fd3e33730648a00f1f1fe1/0_260_8688_5213/master/8688.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6480ea9f149731324f9664ca43fbf33c", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
