It would be particularly absurd for Northern Ireland.\n\n\u201cIt would shatter the Belfast Agreement\u2019s Principle of Consent and completely undermine Northern Ireland\u2019s status as an integral part of the UK. We must not go down this route.\"\n\nMr Paterson spoke out despite other hardline Brexiteers offering Mr Johnson support.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nSelf-styled \" Brexit hardman\" Steve Baker later said he was \"optimistic\" that Mr Johnson's team would finalise a \"tolerable deal that I will be able to vote for\".\n\nAnd Jacob Rees-Mogg , the Commons leader who sits in the Cabinet, told LBC \"I think the votes are there now for a deal\" in Parliament.\n\nBut the DUP were lukewarm despite a 90-minute meeting between their leader Arlene Foster and the PM last night.\n\n\"Gaps remain and further work is required,\" a spokesman said after Ms Foster slipped out the back gate of No10 to avoid the press.\n\nToday Iain Duncan Smith, a former Cabinet minister, denied he \"exploded\" at No10 officials over the planned deal saying \"I wasn't exploding anywhere\".\n\nMr Duncan Smith added he and other Tories were not shown details of the deal.\n\nBoris Johnson's Brexit plan explained Boris Johnson sent the EU a new Brexit plan in October 2019 to replace Theresa May's 585-page Withdrawal Agreement. It would keep a transition period continuing EU rules and payments to December 2020. But it would scrap the Irish backstop, an insurance policy designed at preventing a hard border between Northern Ireland the Republic from 2021. In the backstop's place would be 'two borders': Northern Ireland and Britain would share a customs territory - forcing customs checks on goods crossing the 310-mile border with the Republic. Northern Ireland and the Republic would share EU single market rules - forcing checks on manufactured and agricultural products crossing the Irish Sea. Customs checks across the Irish border would only take place on a \"very small number\" of goods, away from the border itself to avoid new physical infrastructure. Meanwhile, Northern Ireland would get a chance to exit EU single market rules every four years through a vote in Stormont. But this proposal was reportedly dropped after anger in the EU. Stormont has not sat for years and there are fears such a veto would give the DUP too much power.\n\nBut he admitted a possible split, telling BBC breakfast: \"People often talk about the [Brexiteer group] ERG as some sort of homogeneous group. It's not.\n\n\"People make their own minds up and they will meet no doubt to discuss that in the next few days.\"\n\nAnd he said there was no need for a \"technical\" extension to the Brexit date - a prospect one minister, Oliver Dowden, repeatedly refused to rule out today.\n\nMr Duncan Smith said there could be \"some accommodation\" but added: \"Clearly it's important that the sovereign status of the UK remains exactly that - sovereign.\n\n\"It's not for other countries to dictate where our borders lie and how they work.\"", "description": "Some Tories signalled they could back the PM's deal in a crucial vote - but Owen Paterson hit out and the DUP were lukewarm after crunch talks in Downing Street", "authors": ["Dan Bloom", "Image", "Pool Afp Via Getty Images", "Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20589317.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_BRITAIN-EU-POLITICS-BREXIT-NATO-DIPLOMACY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
