He said that competition in the cloud space could be good for ORCL and other companies.\n\nIn this daily bar chart of ORCL, below, we can see that prices have tested the rising 200-day moving average line several times since early June. Prices are now above the rising 50-day moving average line and the rising 200-day line.\n\nThe trading volume has been uneven but the On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line has been making higher lows and higher highs since December and its strength has supported and confirmed the price gains.\n\nThe trend-following Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is above the zero line in positive territory.\n\nIn this weekly bar chart of ORCL, below, we can see that prices are above the rising 40-week moving average line.\n\nThe weekly OBV line has been strong the past 12 months and its rise helps to confirm the price gains with its story of aggressive buying.\n\nThe MACD oscillator is above the zero line and very narrow so we could soon see a crossover buy signal.\n\nIn this first Point and Figure chart of ORCL, below, we can see an upside price target of $64.\n\nIn this second Point and Figure chart of ORCL, below, we see more price history by using only close only data. Here the price target is near $77.\n\nBottom line strategy: With the rising 200-day moving average line being so well tested, I want to risk below it or below $52. Traders could go long here looking for $64 and then $77 over the next several months.", "description": "Let's review the charts and indicators....ORCL", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Oracle Is Set To Power Its Way To New Highs", "Let'S Review The Charts", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "James", "Rev Shark", "Eric Jhonsa", "Carolyn Boroden", "Bob Lang", "Doug Kass"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/safra-catz.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
