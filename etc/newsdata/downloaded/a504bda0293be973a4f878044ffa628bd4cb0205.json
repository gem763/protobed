You want to alert your issuer before fraudulent charges start piling up and get a replacement ASAP. But getting a new card could take days.\n\nAnd what if it\u2019s merely lost? You could cancel the card immediately \u2014 only to find it minutes later, hiding behind some couch cushions.\n\nHere\u2019s what to do when you realize your credit card isn\u2019t where it\u2019s supposed to be.\n\nFirst, freeze or lock your card\n\nWhen you\u2019re not sure what happened to your card, the best thing you can do is buy yourself some time to retrace your steps. That\u2019s easy to do if your card gives you the option to lock or freeze certain new card transactions remotely from your phone or computer. Freezing or locking your card generally takes only a few clicks, and cards can be \u201cthawed\u201d or unlocked instantly.\n\nIn 2015, Discover became the first major issuer to add this capability to its credit cards when it debuted a feature called \u201cFreeze it.\u201d\n\nThe feature \u201ctruly is an on/off switch that our cardmembers can use through their app or on our website to prevent new purchases, balance transfers and cash advances if they can\u2019t find their card,\u201d Laks Vasudevan, vice president of product strategy for Discover, said via email.\n\nSince then, almost every major issuer has introduced similar card controls. If your card has a feature like this, take advantage of it.\n\nStill missing? Contact your issuer\n\nIf, after you\u2019ve locked it, your card is still nowhere to be found, it\u2019s time to alert your issuer.\n\n\u201cCall the credit card company immediately and tell them,\u201d Chi Chi Wu, staff attorney for the National Consumer Law Center, said via email. \u201cThe company will cancel the card and send you a new one.\u201d\n\nBy doing this, you\u2019re preventing future unauthorized charges on the card, Wu notes. Of course, even if fraudulent charges are made, you generally won\u2019t be liable for them. Federal law sharply limits your liability for fraudulent credit card purchases on lost or stolen cards, and credit card networks\u2019 zero-liability policies generally mean you won\u2019t be liable for any amount. But it\u2019s best to prevent fraudulent charges in the first place, Wu says.\n\nRemember that after replacing your card, you\u2019ll no longer be able to use your old card number to make purchases or other transactions, even if you find it later. You\u2019ll also have to update any payment information for the recurring charges linked to your old card number. Generally, such a replacement will not affect your credit score, since the new card number will be associated with the same account.\n\nStolen? File a police report\n\nSay you\u2019re certain a thief stole your credit card \u2014 or even swiped your whole wallet. Calling your issuers to report the theft is a good start, but it\u2019s not the only thing you should do.\n\nIn cases of stolen credit cards, \u201cOne step you don\u2019t really see people taking, and they really should be taking, is filing a police report,\u201d says Kyle Marchini, senior analyst for fraud management at Javelin Strategy & Research, a research-based advisory firm.\n\nHe notes it\u2019s doubly important to file such a report if your driver\u2019s license was stolen, too, since it includes information that could be used for financial fraud or criminal impersonation. Reporting the theft could help the police gather information and potentially recognize patterns of similar criminal activity, Marchini notes.\n\nTo file a police report, call your local police department. Be prepared to provide information about where and when the theft happened and which items were stolen.\n\nHow to keep your cards close\n\nSometimes, credit cards go missing for reasons beyond your control. But if you regularly have trouble keeping track of your plastic, making these small changes could help.\n\nGive your card a home\n\nWhen you\u2019re done using a card, make a habit of putting it back in the same place every time \u2014 say, your wallet \u2014 rather than just pocketing it, setting it on a nightstand or letting it fly solo in your purse.\n\nTake a wallet inventory\n\nMarchini recommends making a list of all the cards in your wallet. \u201cIt makes it that much easier if your wallet does go missing or is stolen,\u201d he says. \u201cYou know who you should be getting in contact with.\u201d\n\nDownload your credit card issuer\u2019s app\n\nSet this up now so you\u2019ll be able to lock or freeze your card quickly in case it ever goes missing again. While you\u2019re at it, turn on push notifications to notify you about your card spending, too, so you can spot fishy charges right away.\n\nThis article was written by NerdWallet and was originally published by Forbes.\n\nThe article What to Do If You Lose Your Credit Card originally appeared on NerdWallet.", "description": "A missing credit card can put you in a tough spot, especially when you have no idea what happened to it.
