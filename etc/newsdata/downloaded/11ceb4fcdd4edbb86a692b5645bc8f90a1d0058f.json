The figure is higher in the Northeast: 85 percent.\n\nAD\n\nThat figure does not include Ocean City, which in 2009 decided to end its recycling program.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI think the money is certainly a component of it,\u201d Jessica Waters, communications manager for the town, told Answer Man. She said Ocean City saved $1.5 million a year when it eliminated recycling.\n\nBut more importantly, Waters said, was that even with recycling, 92 percent of the town\u2019s waste was going into a landfill.\n\n\u201cThat was really unacceptable,\u201d Waters said.\n\nThe decision was made to instead send Ocean City\u2019s trash to a company called Covanta for use in a waste-to-energy plant. The refuse is trucked to Pennsylvania where it\u2019s burned, heating water, producing steam and activating turbines for a generator. Said Waters: \u201cNow with Covanta, we landfill less than 2 percent of our waste.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOf course, that burning trash includes many things that could have been recycled, a fact that irks environmentalists.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhen you burn recyclables, you have to make more energy to get this virgin material out of the earth,\u201d said Josh Chamberlain, founder of Go Green OC, a grass-roots organization trying to persuade the city to reintroduce recycling.\n\nChamberlain \u2014 a filmmaker who lives in Austin \u2014 grew up in Ocean City, where he surfed and fished as a boy. He doesn\u2019t understand why a place that depends on natural beauty isn\u2019t doing more to preserve itself.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a beach town,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be facing rising sea levels before anybody. We should be doing whatever we can to be green.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOcean City doesn\u2019t have curbside recycling, but there is a recycling drop-off near a Walmart two miles outside of town for residents and visitors sufficiently motivated to drive there. Some tourists take their recyclables with them, like mountaineers packing trash off the slopes of Everest.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cPeople are literally driving home with beer bottles in their trunk, they feel so guilty,\u201d Chamberlain said.\n\nThat\u2019s a practice with which Chaz Miller of the Maryland Recycling Network, a coalition of recyclers in the state, is familiar.\n\n\u201cMy kids sort of accepted it as a price of growing up: bringing the sticky bag home,\u201d said Miller, who has worked on recycling issues for 40 years. \u201cI will say one thing in Ocean City\u2019s defense: People who are at the beach having a good time are lousy recyclers. They\u2019re not there to carefully sort out their recyclables.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s easiest to get single-family homes to recycle, Miller said. \u201cApartment buildings are harder and public places are hardest,\u201d he said. \u201cGo to an airport. You\u2019ll see garbage in the recycling bins and recycling in the garbage gins. It\u2019s like we partially have recycling behavior, and we partially don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBut, Miller said, \u201cI don\u2019t see why the city of Ocean City, especially the permanent residents, wouldn\u2019t be able to recycle perfectly well.\u201d\n\nPart of the problem for communities like Ocean City is that commodity prices for recyclables have dropped, forcing jurisdictions to pay for recycling to be taken away rather than reaping money by selling it.\n\nAD\n\nWaters, the beach town\u2019s spokeswoman, said: \u201cOur environment is our biggest asset here. We take very seriously making sure we\u2019re taking care of it and being responsible for it. We just use untraditional ways to do that.\u201d\n\nChamberlain of Go Green OC is unconvinced. The thought of all those beer bottles and plastic cups and cardboard packaging from all those hotels going up in flames in a Pennsylvania incinerator inflames him. He\u2019s working on a plan to introduce composting of organic materials to Ocean City restaurants, followed by cardboard recycling.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to see my hometown disappear,\u201d he said. \u201cMy initiative\u2019s not going to change the climate, but at least it could help slow [change] down.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSaid Miller: \u201cThe positive environmental impact of recycling is clear. It\u2019s an industrial process. It\u2019s not perfect, but it does save on raw material use. It does lead to lower greenhouse gas emissions. It\u2019s a net win for the environment.\u201d\n\nTomorrow: Even more on recycling!\n\nQuestions, please\n\nDo you have a question about the Washington area?
