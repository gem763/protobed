Imagine waking every morning wondering how you\u2019re going to spend that day appeasing two masters. One of them, a capricious force capable of fueling instability in the Middle East. The other, the oil market.\n\nHaving recently been stripped of his industry and mining portfolios as well as the chairmanship of Saudi Arabian Oil Co. \u2013 known as Saudi Aramco \u2013 Al-Falih\u2019s latest demotion is more of a coda than a coup. This being Saudi Arabia, especially under the current rule of the King and his son Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, there is naturally the whiff of intrigue. A more straightforward explanation is that the oil crash and long-delayed initial public offering of Aramco have claimed another scalp.\n\nAramco\u2019s new chairman is Yasir Al-Rumayyan, a board member running the sovereign wealth fund that is due to receive the world\u2019s biggest ever round of seed funding from the IPO. He is also a close adviser of MBS, as the crown prince is known. Meanwhile, the new energy minister will be Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, an energy ministry veteran who just happens to also be the half-brother of MBS.\n\nLook, it is a kingdom. Which has been the problem all along. Aramco\u2019s IPO, gargantuan as it might ultimately be, is in itself an expression of the realization that, as economic models go, a patronage system funded by oil rents looks so 20th century. Ali Al-Naimi, Al-Falih\u2019s predecessor as energy minister, was in the job for 21 years. Now Saudi Arabia will have switched ministers twice in the space of three, suggesting \u2013 to use an unfortunately apt metaphor \u2013 the permafrost is melting. Remember, MBS sprung the notion of selling off a sliver of the country\u2019s crown jewel as an integral part of his wider objective of promoting the idea of economic reform. He also threw out a valuation of $2 trillion, which was unfortunate because (a) just don\u2019t do that ahead of an IPO, and (b) it never looked realistic.\n\nThere is speculation Al-Falih\u2019s sudden opportunity to spend more time with his family reflects displeasure with where oil prices are. If true, it reeks of delusion. The fact that oil prices remain anchored around $60 despite rising tension with Iran \u2013 with Tehran tweaking things up again this weekend \u2013 and OPEC+ showing uncommon restraint on supply speaks to the difficulty Al-Falih, or anyone, faces in trying to push them higher.\n\nOn that front, rising bankruptcies and the virtual closure of the equity and high-yield markets to U.S. frackers offers more hope to Saudi Arabia\u2019s committed oil bulls. And yet Saudi Arabia\u2019s very efforts to support prices work against this trend, and don\u2019t help with faltering demand growth either. Equally, though, Al-Naimi\u2019s earlier strategy of trying to crush shale with low prices proved too painful for his country and, perhaps more importantly, his bosses.\n\nAs it is, unless oil prices rise closer to $100 a barrel and are expected to stay there, the world\u2019s money managers aren\u2019t going to price Aramco anywhere near $2 trillion (see my back-of-the-envelope scribblings here). And while $100 a barrel forever represents utopia for Saudi Arabia and other petro-states, it would constitute economic dystopia everywhere else \u2013 which renders it pure fantasy.\n\nIt is, therefore, hard to see what Al-Falih\u2019s replacement could do in terms of oil policy that is vastly different from the current course. Rather, this looks of a piece with MBS\u2019s earlier moves to centralize control.\n\nThis has implications for the apparently revived IPO project. Putting close allies and family members into key positions at Aramco and the energy ministry suggests we have entered the phase where MBS just wants this thing done, no questions. In doing so, however, it throws the spotlight once again on Aramco\u2019s duality. Separating the ministry from the chairmanship of the company was pretty standard in terms of trying to bolster Aramco\u2019s commercial identity, albeit undercut by the identity of the replacement. Now the ascendancy of a royal to the energy ministry, breaking with past tradition, reinforces the sense that the wider reform project looks a lot like an old-fashioned exercise in consolidating power.", "description": "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- It seems to me that Khalid Al-Falih, just ousted as Saudi Arabia\u2019s Energy Minister, is better off out of it.
