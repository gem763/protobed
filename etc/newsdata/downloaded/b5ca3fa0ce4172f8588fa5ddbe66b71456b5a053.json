Participants include 7-Eleven, GS25, CU and Emart 24, as well as big discount chains like Emart and Lotte Mart.Rep. Kim Chung-woo of the ruling Democratic Party said that the BOK\u2019s failure to communicate the effort led to scant awareness of the program in the public sphere.\u201cLack of proper promotion and a business model oriented toward suppliers - rather than consumers - led to the poor performance of the project,\u201d the lawmaker said in a statement. \u201cIn the beginning, the BOK was active in promotional activities such as putting banners at schools and outdoor billboards advertising in downtown areas, but later there has been little or no record of such efforts.\u201dKim noted that the central bank spent 2.5 percent of budgets allocated to the coinless society initiative in 2018 and refrained from executing any budget this year.A BOK source explained that the budget is supposed to be used throughout the rest of the year as the bank plans to enter into the second phase of the coinless society trial.\u201cWe plan to launch a new related service that will load loose change directly onto one\u2019s bank account in the fourth quarter and resume promotions by the time we launch the service,\u201d a source in charge of the proposal said.Yet, consumers are not the only one in the dark on the project - the service sometimes goes unnoticed by providers.Cashiers from three partnered convenience store chains - 7-Eleven, CU and GS25 - within 600 meters (0.4 miles) of the BOK\u2019s headquarters in central Seoul told the Korea JoongAng Daily that they had no knowledge of the initiative.When asked to load loose change onto a transit card, an employee at GS25 in Bukchang-dong in central Seoul said, \u201cI am not sure if we have such functions, and I don\u2019t know how to handle it even if they exist.\u201dEven if one happens to know what the coinless project is, they found it inconvenient since each retailer and convenience store has a different rule.For instance, CU and GS25 allow for depositing onto transportation cards such as T-Money and Cash Bee, whereas Lotte Mart and Emart only accept transactions with their own rewards programs.7-Eleven, on the other hand, handles Cash Bee and points from Lotte\u2019s retail affiliates and Naver Pay.The BOK official acknowledged the shortcomings but said the bank has no plans to reform the initiative.\u201cBecause the retail shops have their own infrastructure and system, it is hard to incorporate it into a comprehensive one,\u201d the source said. \u201cAnd when the BOK first planned the project, we didn\u2019t propose establishing a new infrastructure that could encompass all participants. So, we will leave it as it is for now, but we will add the new option [of depositing money onto bank accounts].\u201dBY PARK EUN-JEE [park.eunjee@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://pds.joins.com/jmnet/koreajoongangdaily/_data/photo/2019/10/13211929.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
