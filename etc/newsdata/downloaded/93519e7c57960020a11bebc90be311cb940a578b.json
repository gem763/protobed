Tom Cotton speaks with reporters in Washington, D.C. (Aaron P. Bernstein/Reuters)\n\nSenator Tom Cotton (R., Ark.) sent a letter to Intelligence Community Inspector General (ICIG) Michael Atkinson on Wednesday demanding answers after reports emerged Tuesday that the whistleblower had a \u2018professional relationship\u2019 with a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate.\n\nIn Atkinson\u2019s testimony to the Senate on Sept. 26, the ICIG refused to elaborate on his written report, which stated that there was an \u201cindicia of an arguable political bias on the part of the [whistleblower] in favor of a rival political candidate.\u201d But reports have surfaced that Atkinson elaborated on his original statement during his testimony before the House Intelligence Committee.\n\n\u201cYour disappointing testimony to the Senate Intelligence Committee on September 26 was evasive to the point of being insolent and obstructive,\u201d Cotton\u2019s letter reads. \u201c\u2026 This information is, of course, unclassified and we were meeting in a closed setting. Yet you moralized about how you were duty bound not to share even a hint of this political bias with us.\u201d\n\nIn his original Aug. 26 letter detailing the whistleblower\u2019s accusations, Atkinson said that the individual\u2019s political bias \u201cdid not change my determination that the complaint relating to the urgent concern \u2018appears credible,\u2019 particularly given the other information the ICIG obtained during its preliminary review.\u201d\n\nCotton ends his letter with a number of demands, including asking Atkinson to confirm the reports that the whistleblower had some level of professional relationship with a Democratic presidential campaign, and to clarify which candidate and the nature of the relationship. The letter also demands that Atkinson explain why he did not bring up the facts during the September hearing.\n\n\u201cThis information is urgently relevant for the American people and their elected representatives to evaluate the complainant\u2019s credibility and to determine whether the House\u2019s so-called impeachment has been, in reality, a well-coordinated partisan attack from the beginning,\u201d Cotton concludes.", "description": "Cotton wrote ICIG Michael Atkinson after reports emerged the whistleblower had a \u2018professional relationship\u2019 with a 2020 Democrat.", "authors": ["Tobias Hoonhout", "Jim Geraghty", "Victor Davis Hanson", "John Mccormack", "Rich Lowry", "Andrew C.
