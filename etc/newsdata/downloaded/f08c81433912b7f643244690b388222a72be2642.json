The body of one of those victims was removed Sunday night, while a second remains in the building. The New Orleans Coroner has not yet released the names of the deceased or the person still missing.\n\nThe danger did not end after the initial collapse Saturday morning as a 270-foot, multi-ton crane on top of the building became unsecured and threatened to topple. Another crane was moved into the area Sunday to stabilize it.\n\nWitness account: 'Mind boggling' Hard Rock hotel construction collapse in New Orleans\n\nAnswers will come with investigation: Engineer weighs in on Hard Rock Hotel collapse: 'Logically, it doesn't make sense'\n\nDozens of workers were injured when the top six to eight floors of the hotel under construction collapsed around 9 a.m. Saturday, sending debris cascading onto Rampart Street. Eighteen workers were transported to the hospital and several others transported themselves for treatment. Only one worker remains hospitalized and in stable condition. No bystanders were injured.\n\nAs engineering crews rushed to stabilize a listing crane and avoid further collapses, the blocks around the site were closed to traffic.\n\nHard Rock hotel construction collapses in New Orleans: 2 dead, 1 missing\n\nNeither the building nor the crane, McConnell said, have moved since Saturday.\n\nAs of Monday morning, nine nearby businesses still had no gas or electricity and 37 area families had been forced to relocate to hotels, according to Mayor LaToya Cantrell.\n\nThe roof of the Saenger Theater, directly across Rampart Street, was pierced with falling debris, according to the City, and all performances of the musical \u201cWicked,\u201d set to run until Oct. 20, were canceled.\n\nCantrell urged patience because it could take weeks or even months to clean up the area, explaining, \u201cThis structure is not stable. We want people to stay away from the area. How we touch it \u2013 it just matters.\"\n\nThe Hard Rock construction project, she said, was last inspected by the city on Sept. 24.\n\nThe federal agency OSHA is already on the scene of the collapse. Once the NOFD ends its rescue operation, OSHA will take over and begin its investigation.\n\nContributing: Associated Press\n\nThis article originally appeared on Montgomery Advertiser: Hard Rock Hotel collapse: 2 dead, 1 missing; cleanup could take weeks", "description": "Two people were killed and 19 injured Saturday when a Hard Rock Hotel construction project in New Orleans collapsed.
