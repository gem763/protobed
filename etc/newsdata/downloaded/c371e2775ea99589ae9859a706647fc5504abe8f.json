To promote literacy, FunDza focuses on the 'pleasure' aspect of reading and writing.\n\nStudies show that reading for pleasure is a powerful indicator of a young person\u2019s future success. Reading fiction is also linked to increased empathy, creativity, and an understanding of cause and effect, as well as the more obvious skills of language and vocabulary development.\n\nFounded in 2011, FunDza has grown quickly, getting exciting locally-created books and stories into the hands of thousands of young South Africans, most of whom are living in \u2018book-scarce\u2019 communities.\n\nFunDza encourages young people to explore their creative talents and to start writing too.\n\nThe initiative works formally through groups and informally, reaching people through the use of mobile technology, and the programmes are reaching thousands of young South Africans nationwide, having an impact on attitudes towards and behaviours around reading and writing.\n\nTo find beautiful local stories and audio to spark a joy for reading in your children visit Parent24's Storytime Hub.\n\nChat back:\n\nShare your story with us, and we could publish your letter.
