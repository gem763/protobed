Why Can\u2019t the City Build More Gems Like This?", "language": "en", "text": "Over the years, it became a poster child for the perils of public architecture in New York, as if the ambition of its design and not the city\u2019s broken bureaucracy was to blame for the library\u2019s extended timetable and escalating budget.\n\nFrom the start, pea counters in the city\u2019s Office of Management and Budget didn\u2019t see why Hunters Point needed a big fancy library, notwithstanding all the new apartment towers going up, bringing in droves of young families. The pea counters held the project up. Delays raised costs.\n\nI spoke with Chris McVoy, a partner at Steven Holl Architects. (Steven Holl was the library\u2019s architect; Olaf Schmidt, the project architect; Mr. McVoy also played a key role.) Mr. McVoy defended the city, blaming the troubles mostly on complications with construction.\n\nThere were specific obstacles like the resignation of the former Queens library president, a big backer and fund-raiser for the building, and a dockworkers strike in Spain that held up glass shipments. Credit goes to the local City Council member, Jimmy Van Bramer, a former library official, who helped keep the project alive when City Hall seemed ready to let it die.\n\nWhatever the specifics in this case, the issues around public architecture in the city are bigger than Hunters Point. It\u2019s not hard to find architects, clients, builders, public officials and others familiar with the city\u2019s capital construction program ready to unleash symphonic tirades about New York\u2019s crazy procurement rules, about the petty, internecine squabbles among city agencies, about the city-required shotgun marriages between architects and contractors, the costly and onerous liability regulations, notoriously late payments and a vast, sclerotic bureaucracy that squanders millions of tax dollars by causing needless, yearslong delays in the name of value engineering, then scapegoats architects.", "description": "The Hunters Point Community Library is one of the finest public buildings New York has produced this century.
