With its sculptured geometry \u2014 a playful advertisement for itself \u2014 it\u2019s even a little like the Pepsi sign.\n\nCompact, at 22,000 square feet and 82 feet high , the library is among the finest and most uplifting public buildings New York has produced so far this century.\n\nIt also cost something north of $40 million and took forever to complete. So it raises the question: Why can\u2019t New York build more things like this, faster and cheaper?\n\nOpening Sept. 24, Hunters Point is surely what Queens Library officials and the borough\u2019s former president, Helen M. Marshall, had in mind when the project was proposed more than 15 years ago: a crown jewel among Queens branches, at a singular, symbolic spot facing the United Nations and Louis Kahn\u2019s exalted Four Freedoms Park across the water.", "description": "The Hunters Point Community Library is one of the finest public buildings New York has produced this century.
