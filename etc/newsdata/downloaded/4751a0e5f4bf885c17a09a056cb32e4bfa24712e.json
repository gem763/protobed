A strong supporter of President Trump, he would make VA reform a priority. His campaign, so far, has been grass-roots and self-funded.\n\nIn a recent interview with American Military News, Merritt described a key motivation for running: lawmakers cashing in on their office: \u201cSo many times we see our representatives are using their positions to enrich themselves, to improve their own lives or the lives of their family members. Everybody scratches each other backs. . . . Americans are sick and tired of it.\u201d Describing himself as a \u201ccomplete outsider\u201d who is \u201ccompletely new to politics,\u201d Merritt says he will \u201chave a fresh look at how things are done and be able to do things differently,\u201d adding, \u201cI\u2019ve done that in business and in combat and been successful, and I\u2019m hoping to do that in Congress.\u201d\n\nA strong conservative who is a great admirer of Rush Limbaugh, Merritt is in particular a fan of federalism, which he claims is \u201cvery close to my heart\u201d:\n\nThe 10th Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees states\u2019 rights and it should be consistently reaffirmed at the Federal Level. The centralized power of Washington needs to be relinquished to the states and their local communities. A one size fits all policy that works well on paper in Washington will not be effective for all cities within the nation, the State of Georgia, or the First Congressional District. Federal overreach, which has been happening at a growing and startling rate, causes the degradation of our states\u2019 rights and local rights. Policy is best handled at the local level where the needs of the society are best understood.\n\nLaunched in 2012 (co-founder / brother Tyler is a West Point grad who flew helicopter combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan), Nine Line has resonated nationally because of its \u201crelentlessly patriotic\u201d stance, its veteran-intensive principles (the booming Savannah-based business employs over 200) and related philanthropy, and the promotion of a \u201cbrother\u2019s keeper\u201d culture that makes respect for Old Glory a top corporate tenet. (In 2017 Merritt, while still a Nine Line co-owner, launched Georgia Land and Cattle, a \u201cSouthern lifestyle\u201d company marketing everything from jerky to jackets.)\n\nNine Line also gained national attention earlier this year when CBS rejected its \u2019Murica-loving \u201cJust Stand\u201d Super Bowl ad (watch it here).\n\nHere\u2019s my 2013 interview with Dan about the founding of Nine Line. Merritt\u2019s dad (also named Dan) is well known to fans of Bill Buckley\u2019s classic sailing books. Dad Dan, WFB\u2019s Connecticut neighbor, served as crewmate on his storied Atlantic and Pacific voyages. In the interview, Merritt told a great story about this magazine\u2019s founder:\n\nAnyway, I have a particularly fond memory of Mr. Buckley that not many people know. I was a young kid, about 13 years old, and I made my way down to Yacht Haven, the marina in Stamford, where Mr. Buckley\u2019s boat Patito was docked. I was fishing off the boat all alone \u2014 or thought I was \u2014 smoking one of Mr. Buckley\u2019s cigars. As I was fishing, the boat rocked back and forth, and Mr. Buckley appeared out of nowhere, catching me, a 13-year-old, in the act of smoking his cigar. I thought I was in big trouble. But he just looked at me and said, \u201cAre you enjoying that cigar?\u201d Scared, I said, \u201cYes, Mr. Buckley.\u201d He said, \u201cGood. They are expensive.\u201d", "description": "It\u2019s impossible not to like or respect Danny Merritt, the young warrior, successful businessman, husband, dad (of four), and member of the extended National Review family who is now turning his attention to politics: He has launched a primary ...", "authors": ["Jack Fowler", "Andrew C.
