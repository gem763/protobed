He may actually have a case there. However, this is not gonna happen,\" said Napolitano.\n\nThe paper has taken heat from both sides of the aisle for walking back its allegations against Kavanaugh Sunday after swift backlash \u2014 with even MSNBC\u2019s liberal morning show and \u201cThe View\u201d taking issue with the Gray Lady.\n\nLate Sunday, The New York Times revised an explosive report about an allegation of sexual assault by Kavanaugh from his college days. The piece by Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly, adapted from their forthcoming book, alleged there was corroboration of an incident in which Kavanaugh, as a college student at Yale, exposed himself to a female classmate at a party.\n\nTRUMP RIPS NEW YORK TIMES OVER KAVANAUGH PIECE, CALLS FOR RESIGNATION OF ANYONE INVOLVED IN 'SMEAR STORY'\n\nHours later, The Federalist's Mollie Hemingway \u2013 who had reviewed an advance copy of the book \u2013 flagged a glaring omission and the paper eventually updated the controversial story after being lampooned on social media over the gaffe.\n\nThe update included the significant detail that several friends of the alleged victim said she did not recall the purported sexual assault. The newspaper also stated for the first time that the alleged victim refused to be interviewed, and has made no other comment about the episode.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIn an interview on MSNBC Monday night, Pogrebin and Kelly alleged that the key information may have been removed from the original draft in the editing process.\n\nNapolitano said he viewed the original report as an attempt to \"undermine\" Kavanaugh and the Supreme Court as a whole.\n\n\"The Supreme Court doesn't have an army to enforce its rulings. Its rulings are enforced because of the credibility that the legal community and judicial community puts in these nine justices. And if you begin diminishing one of them for reasons having nothing to with his intellectual understanding of the law, that will undermine the court,\" he said, adding it's also a \"serious issue\" if the FBI did not fully investigate all claims against Kavanaugh during the confirmation process.\n\nFox News' Brian Flood contributed to this report.", "description": "Supreme Court Associate Justice\u00a0Brett Kavanaugh could have a libel case to make against\u00a0The New York Times\u00a0over a now-revised\u00a0article that suggested fresh allegations of sexual assault, Judge Andrew Napolitano argued Tuesday.", "authors": ["David Montanaro", "David Montanaro Is A Senior Editor With Fox News."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/judgeKav.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
