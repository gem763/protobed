That would have been utter ruin. Instead, we met the situation with proposals to private business and to the Congress of the most gigantic program of economic defense and counterattack ever evolved in the history of the Republic. We put that program in action.[3]\n\nHoover would proudly admit that it was a \u201cprogram unparalleled in the history of depressions in any country and any time.\u201d Economists Lowell Gallaway and Richard Vedder write, \u201cHe was an interventionist who, among other things, found morally and intellectually unacceptable the classical means of dealing with earlier incidents of depressed economic conditions.\u201d[4]\n\nKeynesianism, and Keynes in General Theory, purports that full employment and recovering from a recessionary economy is achieved from increasing aggregate demand \u2013 or a recession is caused by an excess of goods and services. Keynesianism is the antithesis of classic and Austrian economics, and Say\u2019s Law (Jean-Baptiste Say, 1803) which is \u201c[d]emand is constituted by supply but only so long as supply consists of what those with incomes to spend want to buy;\u201d[5] that is, supplied products which create value for the consumer. This is the supply-side economics of the Reagan administration and the economics of Arthur Laffer. \u201cClassical economists understood that economies are not driven by demand but by value adding production, which is what they referred to as \u201csupply.\u201d They understood perfectly well that raising demand without an increase in the level of value adding output cannot be an answer to recession and unemployment.\u201d[6]\n\n[1] Murray N. Rothbard, 2008 (originally published in 1963), America\u2019s Great Depression, (Auburn, AL: The Ludwig von Mises Institute), p. 205. Hoover also stated, and acknowledged, that his administration \u201chad to pioneer a new field,\u201d and that \u201cthe primary question at once arose as to whether the President and the Federal government should undertake to investigate and remedy [economic recessions] evils\u2026.No President before had ever believed that there was a governmental responsibility in such cases. No matter what the urging on previous occasions, Presidents steadfastly had maintained that the Federal government was apart from such eruptions\u2026\u201d See Murray N.
