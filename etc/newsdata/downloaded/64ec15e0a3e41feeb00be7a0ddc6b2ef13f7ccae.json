The whistleblower is \u201calmost a spy\u201d who might be guilty of \u201ctreason.\u201d House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) should be arrested for \u201ctreason.\u201d Both are part of a \u201cCOUP\u201d which \u2014 if successful \u2014 could provoke a \u201cCivil War.\u201d\n\nHow is it possible to escalate any further from here? What is the step beyond the threat of political violence?\n\nThe willingness of elected Republicans to follow Trump in the scorched-earth defense of his power is a sign that the old GOP \u2014 defined by deference to institutions \u2014 is well and truly dead. It is one thing to reflect Trump\u2019s vicious, partisan tone; it is another to accept that portions of the U.S. government, including some in the FBI and CIA, are part of a conspiracy to overthrow the president. Smarmy sycophants such as House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) have joined in Trump\u2019s allegation of a \u201ccoup\u201d \u2014 indifferent to the institutional wreckage such a charge will leave behind.\n\nIn the White House, and in the conservative-fever swamps, the message is now the same. \u201cThe ongoing effort to undermine and remove a duly elected president,\u201d says columnist Monica Crowley, \u201cis a rolling deep state coup d\u2019etat (with an assist from the media), making it the most dangerous scandal in American history.\u201d Political activist David Bossie alleges a \u201cvast left-wing conspiracy . . . that began with Crossfire Hurricane, the Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee.\u201d The conspiracy-minded wing of the GOP is suddenly ascendant, and former Texas congressman Ron Paul can hardly contain himself. \u201cIt\u2019s hard not to ask whether this is a genuine impeachment effort . . . or a CIA coup!\u201d\n\nIs this something more than metaphorical excess? Unfortunately, it seems to be. Recent revelations show that Trump is a true believer in a truly balmy theory. He is convinced that Australian and U.S. spies \u2014 working with other elements of the U.S. deep state, and somehow with Britain and Ukraine \u2014 laid the fraudulent groundwork for the Mueller investigation in the hope of overturning the result of the 2016 election. This conspiracy theory is what Trump asked Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate, and what Trump asked Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison to investigate, and what Trump asked British Prime Minister Boris Johnson to investigate.\n\nZelensky was also asked (as Trump has now asked China) to investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter. This had the narrow (and highly unethical) purpose of gaining advantage over a political rival.\n\nBut it is this broader theory concerning the origins of the Mueller probe that seems to captivate Trump and Attorney General William P. Barr. Long before he was appointed to his office, Barr said the Mueller investigation risked \u201ctaking on the look of an entirely political operation to overthrow the president.\u201d In April, Trump told Fox News\u2019s Sean Hannity that Barr was examining \u201cbig\u201d and \u201cincredible\u201d proof that Ukraine had cooperated with Hillary Clinton to plant evidence against his campaign.\n\nTrump\u2019s series of calls to foreign leaders sought evidence to undermine the credibility of the Mueller investigation \u2014 and, in the case of Ukraine, urged its leader to work with Barr to expose the plot. What cooperation was given? What information was provided? The impeachment investigation will presumably ask and answer such questions.\n\nBut what is frightening, and undeniable, is that Trump is not just employing conspiracy theories as part of a propaganda campaign. He actually believes them. He seems convinced that an intelligence cabal \u2014 involving two of the United States\u2019 closest allies \u2014 sought to overturn his election as president. This would indeed be a dangerous scandal \u2014 if it were even remotely true.\n\nThe real danger lies in a U.S. president operating in a dream world where he is in a heroic struggle against enemies who conduct coups and might require armed resistance. What measures might be required to confront that kind of national emergency? How far will Trump go to root out the authors of treason and subversion?\n\nConsider a recent series of Trump tweets in this light: \u201cAs I learn more and more each day, I am coming to the conclusion that what is taking place is not an impeachment, it is a COUP, intended to take away the Power of the People, their VOTE, their Freedoms, their Second Amendment, Religion, Military, Border Wall, and their God-given rights as a Citizen of the United States of America!\u201d\n\nIt is hard to escape the undertone of menace.\n\nRead more from Michael Gerson\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook .", "description": "His defense relies on conspiracy theories, and he believes them.", "authors": ["Michael Gerson", "October At Pm", "Michael Gerson Is A Nationally Syndicated Columnist Who Appears Twice Weekly In The Post."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/JN9RCVCNl_V6AyU7sjYd644hOiQ=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6TXRFCXGEAI6TIZRFXYS2VVIBM.jpg"}
