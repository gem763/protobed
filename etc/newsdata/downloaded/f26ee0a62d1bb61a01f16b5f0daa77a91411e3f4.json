I\u2019m so proud of you, you don\u2019t know. You just showed that you can beat anyone, anywhere on any fucking time zone. Now have the whole week off.\u201d\n\nWith apologies for his French, the American coach had put his finger on it. His Raiders had come back to win in Indianapolis last weekend, but doing it against play-off contenders the Chicago Bears, late on, and in London, seemed like a statement worth commemorating. The Raiders have played in London twice before and lost both times. Last year, after a humbling defeat to the Miami Dolphins, Gruden said the main lesson he had learned was that jetlag mattered. This year the Raiders had been in the UK since Monday, the Bears only rocked up on Thursday. It was clear which of the two sides was the sleepier.\n\nChicago Bears v Oakland Raiders, Tottenham's first NFL game - in pictures Read more\n\nA late, majestic leap into the endzone by player of the game Josh Jacobs meant the Raiders came away 24-21 winners over the Bears at the first NFL London game of the year and the first ever at the Tottenham Hotspur stadium.\n\nThe brand-new ground, the first purpose-built NFL stadium outside of the United States, had a good night itself creating a constant spectacle of light and noise, even during play. The visitors liked it too, with Bears coach Matt Nagy describing it as \u201cphenomenal\u201d. It was pretty much the only positive adjective he used in his post-game remarks.\n\nWhether suffering from the time difference or not, the Bears didn\u2019t turn up in the first half. Their normally redoubtable defence, that had conceded just five touchdowns in their first four matches, gave up two in five minutes in the second quarter. They weren\u2019t helped by the enforced departure of defensive end Akiem Hicks with an elbow injury, but there was another player missing too. After a pre-game that had concerned itself with the trade which saw Khalil Mack leave the Raiders for the Bears last year (Mack calling the fixture a \u2018grudge match\u2019) the star linebacker failed to impose himself on the Bears\u2019 defensive plays.\n\nThe extra irony of all this was that it was Mack\u2019s departure that helped usher in Jacobs\u2019 arrival , the Raiders taking a first round draft pick from the Bears and using it to select the University of Alabama running back. Jacobs scored the opening touchdown, dancing through the centre of the Bears defence to bring an end to a 10 play, 90-yard drive.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Derek Carr (left) with Chicago Bears\u2019 Khalil Mack talk after the game.

(For the record it was Mack who gobbled up the interception that eventually led to David Montgomery\u2019s opening touchdown).\n\nThere were topsy-turvy moments, interceptions from the Bears\u2019 stand-in quarterback Chase Daniels, one of which was contentiously ruled out after he was adjudged to have been hit after releasing. There was also a fake punt from the Raiders that almost went horribly wrong only for the referees to overturn a ruling on a fumble. Then came the final moment of reckoning, a 14-play progression that moved from Oakland\u2019s three-yard line remorselessly up the field. Jacobs ran the ball on four of those plays. Finally it was first down on the Chicago two-yard line, and quarterback Derek Carr handed the ball off to Jacobs. He fixed his eyes on the heart of the line once more, the Bears by now ravenous. But instead of shimmying he hurled himself as much as five foot off the ground to clear the perimeter security and seal the game.\n\n\u201cHe proved a lot tonight,\u201d said Gruden of the rookie on whom he had put his faith. \u201cHe made some great runs. We\u2019ve been talking about our young players since they\u2019ve been here, the kind of effort that they provide and the smartness that they play with. We\u2019ve got a good feeling going right now.\u201d", "description": "Oakland Raiders\u2019 early arrival paid off as a Josh Jacobs double helped see off Chicago Bears 24-21", "authors": ["Paul Macinnes"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16b1801f3253892c5b45a76df886be8d5552bfb4/141_149_4347_2608/master/4347.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3e6404ad95254f0a4a8f9d12ac6952cb", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
