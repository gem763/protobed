The company's shares are trading up 2.7% as of 11.30 a.m in London (7.30 a.m ET).\n\nAccording to people familiar with the matter, Microsoft could yet still face competition from Amazon, and its cloud computing services which also hosts Netflix, citing \"President Donald Trump's interference in the bidding process.\"\n\nBloomberg also highlighted Amazon, due to its superior size, and a previous contract with the CIA was considered the frontrunner for the contract.\n\nHowever, Microsoft has had objections from workers, as a group of employees wrote on Twitter that \"We are disheartened that Microsoft accepted the JEDI contract,\" adding \"as Microsoft workers, we are now complicit of 'increasing the lethality' of the U.S. Department of Defense.\"\n\nMicrosoft said in a statement on Saturday that it would be pursuing defence contracts with the United States despite complaints from employees.\n\nThe actual contract is being handed to Microsoft's smaller business Azure, who has in the last year secured deals from Kroger Co and AT&T, but this deal marks a significant step up for the subsidiary.\n\nOn the Amazon snub, Trump also allegedly has a long-running feud with Jeff Bezos, who owns the Washington Post, who Trump says unfairly criticizes him. Bloomberg added that a new book by Guy Snodgrass, speechwriter to former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, reportedly says that Trump told Mattis to \"screw Amazon.\"\n\nBloomberg said it is believed that Amazon was the frontrunner till Friday evening.\n\nMicrosoft, Amazon, and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment.", "description": "The contract is for Microsoft's cloud computing services but could face further competition from Amazon according to Bloomberg.", "authors": ["Yusuf Khan"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db6cc18dee01920367db0b4?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
