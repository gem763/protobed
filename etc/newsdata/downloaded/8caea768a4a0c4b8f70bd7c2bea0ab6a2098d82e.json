A dedicated space for you to collate all things foodie, a recipe file can help plan everything from mid-week meals, to more special one-off occasions and also chart your experiments and findings in the kitchen along the way.\n\nWhen thinking about what recipe file is right for you, consider how much space you need and whether you\u2019re happy with the sections provided or would rather customise your own. Some have sheets allowing your book to grow and refill, whilst others come with a predetermined amount of pages.\n\nAs well as space to write down your favourite recipes, it\u2019s also a helpful place to store the recipe cards you\u2019ve been keeping from your weekly recipe boxes.\n\nA lovely gift for the food-mad friend in your life, many of these files came in a presentation box. Although, we also think it would be so lovely to receive one already filled in and passed down, particularly if you have someone going off to university or moving abroad.\n\nFamily favourites and memorable meals deserve to be documented and although we\u2019ve all got an endless stream of recipes available to us at the click of a button, this is a great way of collating your culinary successes. Many also include lots of clever extra features such as splash-proof plastic covers, conversion charts and stickers to make you smile.\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews.
