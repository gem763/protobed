Muilenburg noted that the U.S. \"aerospace industry is the largest exporter\" to China, contributing about $80 billion in trade surplus per year. While he expects Chinese demand for aircraft will continue to climb, Boeing does not see that demand coming in right now.\n\n\"In the near term, as we have shared, the U.S.-China trade situation has presented challenges for our wide-body production plans,\" Muilenburg said. \"The lack of orders from China in the past couple of years has put pressure on the production rate.\"\n\nBoeing forecast last month that China will need 8,090 new airplanes over the next 20 years, worth nearly $1.3 trillion in all. \"China clearly needs lift capacity,\" Muilenburg said, but the trade war means \"we don't have any firm orders from China at this point.\"\n\nDespite the lack of access to China's aerospace market, Boeing has optimistic \"prospects for the long-term wide-body market,\" Muilenburg said. Globally, Boeing expects demand for about 1000 \"small to medium-sized\" wide-body airplanes over the next ten years. But, until American and Chinese leaders put ink to paper on a deal, or at least an exception, Boeing will not be able to serve China's growing market.", "description": "Boeing is monitoring the trade war with China, as tariffs push the company to plan production cuts of its 787 Dreamliner.", "authors": ["Michael Sheetz"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105900356-1557321262173gettyimages-1140107185.jpeg?v=1559134014", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
