Basically it\u2019s a mountain of boxes in the corner of the room. And on a shelf right at the top, we have a box of tissues. The winner is the first person to climb up and get the box of tissues. It\u2019s quite hard because you just fall through the boxes.\n\n\u2018Holly and Mel played it a couple weeks ago, and I swear at one point, I thought: \u201cHas Holly got a hand inside Mel\u2019s mouth, trying to get up there?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018They\u2019re so competitive, both of them, so competitive, but that\u2019s what makes great TV. And me just winding up Mel B all the time.\u2019\n\nSounds like fun\u2026\n\nHowever, Keith insisted they actually \u2018get on really well\u2019, and Mel B has slotted into her team captain role perfectly.\n\n\u2018We filmed four episodes so far. And Mel B has just been glorious,\u2019 he continued. \u2018Paddy couldn\u2019t do it because he\u2019s doing Top Gear. Mel\u2019s just been fantastic.\n\nMel B slipped into her Celebrity Juice role like a total pro (Picture: Getty)\n\nMaybe let\u2019s just stay away from games where Holly ends up with her fist in Mel\u2019s mouth\u2026\n\nKeith is currently fronting a campaign to promote cinema etiquette with Showcase cinema, sharing the top 10 things people find most annoying by watching films in public.\n\nThink people slurping their drinks too loudly, chatting to anyone in sight and all kinds of PDA.\n\nBut there\u2019s one thing that annoys the ITV2 star more than anything else \u2013 feet in cinemas.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t really complain about things. If someone is noisy in the cinema, I would just simply move,\u2019 he added. \u2018I\u2019m always trying to be incognito, I won\u2019t to go up to someone and say, \u201cCan you please stop chomping your popcorn?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Apparently 22% of people do confront other people about their etiquette at the cinema, but I don\u2019t. I just put up with it.\n\n\u2018I think the worst thing in the cinema for me, which is not on this list, is if someone puts their feet up on the back of your chair. How rude can you be? You might as well spit in my ears! Oh my gosh, when someone puts their feet up, what\u2019s wrong with you?\u2019\n\nSo basically, if you\u2019re ever in the cinema with Keith, keep your shoes firmly on.\n\nCelebrity Juice returns to screens on 10 October, at 10pm, on ITV2.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
