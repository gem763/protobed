It's unclear what the South can do if the North starts destroying them.\n\nKim said Yangdok stood in 'striking contrast' to the Diamond Mountain area, which he has officially asked to demolish\n\nKim's comments about South Korea's tourist attraction has come amid frustration in the North that its neighbour has not restarted tours there, in defiance of international sanctions\n\nThe resort also includes an area which could be used as a ski slope, one of several in the country, in snowy conditions\n\n'(South Korea) will prepare creative solutions for Diamond Mountain tourism while sufficiently considering changed environments,' Lee said during a news conference.\n\nTours to Diamond Mountain were a major symbol of cooperation between the Koreas and valuable cash source for the North's broken economy before the South suspended them in 2008 after a North Korean guard shot and killed a South Korean tourist.\n\nDuring a visit to the site, Kim compared the South Korean properties at Diamond Mountain to 'makeshift tents in disaster-stricken areas or isolation wards' and ordered them to be replaced by modern North Korean facilities that display more national character and fit better with the natural scenery.\n\nHe criticized North Korea's policies under his late father as too dependent on the South while vowing that the North would redevelop the site on its own and fully control future tours, according to Pyongyang's official Korean Central News Agency.\n\nKim took another jab at Diamond Mountain's South Korean buildings while inspecting the construction of a new spa resort in central North Korea, the KCNA said Friday. Kim said the 'refreshing' buildings of Yangdok County Hot Spring Resort were in striking contrast to Diamond Mountain's 'architecture of capitalist businesses targeting profit-making from roughly built buildings.'\n\nExperts are divided over whether the North really intends to independently develop tourism for Diamond Mountain or is pressuring the South to restart the tours and upgrade aging facilities.\n\nSome say North Korea would struggle to develop the area on its own under heavy sanctions. Any tours to Diamond Mountain, located on the eastern coast near the inter-Korean border, would be dependent on South Korean travelers as the North's poor transport links make it difficult to bring Chinese tourists there, said Lim Soo-ho, an analyst from South Korea's Institute for National Security Strategy.\n\nKim is trying to create a North Korean tourism industry, with a host of new resorts being built including international airports\n\nAn aerial view of the Yangdok County Hot Spring Resort, which was visited by Kim Jong-un\n\nSeoul can't restart the tours or any other major inter-Korean economic activity without defying U.S.-led sanctions against Pyongyang, which have been strengthened since 2016, when the North began speeding up its nuclear and missile tests.\n\nThe Diamond Mountain tours were a major project of Kim's father, Kim Jong Il, who gave Hyundai the rights to construct a resort town and operate tours. South Korea's government and Hyundai have built about a dozen tourist facilities in the area, including hotels, restaurants, and spas, to accommodate the tours that began in 1998.\n\nNorth Korea said it took steps to freeze and confiscate South Korean properties at the resort in 2010 and 2011 while blaming Seoul for continuing its suspension of tours.\n\nIn a summit last September in Pyongyang, Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in vowed to restart South Korean tours to Diamond Mountain and normalize operations at an inter-Korean factory park in Kaesong when possible, voicing optimism that sanctions could end to allow such projects.\n\nKim raised the subject again during his New Year's speech this year, saying that Pyongyang was ready to restart the projects 'without any precondition' while making a nationalistic call for stronger cooperation between the Koreas.\n\nBut without a breakthrough in the nuclear talks between Washington and Pyongyang, the economic projects remain shelved.", "description": "Kim Jong-un turned up the heat on South Korea on Friday as he visited a newly-built spa in the North, while calling for a meeting with Seoul about tearing down a jointly-built resort, calling it 'shabby'.", "authors": ["Chris Pleasance For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/09/20170794-0-image-a-7_1571991145209.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
