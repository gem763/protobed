Leikeli47 brought half the crowd onto the stage during her set. JPEGMAFIA ran amock, dialling up the energy so high that no one could keep up. Slowthai brought out pals Peggy and Denzel. Triple One bounced from stage to mosh pit like it was no biggie.\n\nAnd ya boy Flume performed his new ~conceptual~ set with friends Vera Blue, Reo Cragun and Peggy, where he potted plants, spray-painted signs and smashed shit. It was wild.\n\nIf you\u2019re still battling FOMO/want to relive it all again, check out the pics for yourselves.\n\n", "description": "Listen Out Festival has come and gone for another year, and PEDESTRIAN.TV took a bunch of cheeky snaps of you lot having a fkn blast in Sydney.", "authors": ["Paigge Warton"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/PTV-LISTEN-OUT-lead-1-1024x639.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
