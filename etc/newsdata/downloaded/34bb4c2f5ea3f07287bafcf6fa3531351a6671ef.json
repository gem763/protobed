What is going on? What's happening right now?'\n\nSaw the funny side: Bieber, seen October 5, was obviously watching Taylor on Fallon\n\nThe blonde beauty looked horrified when the 'Tonight Show' host revealed the source of his knowledge - her mother Alison.\n\nHe said: 'Your mum may or may not have video taped you after surgery and she gave us the video.'\n\nTaylor exclaimed: 'For the television?' as the host explained: 'This is the world premiere.

I may have made some calls,' Fallon says to a shocked Swift when the clip ends\n\nRelatably embarrassing: 'That's on television?' the Lover singer asks in shock after the video rolls\n\nAs for Taylor and Justin, their relationship declined in June this year, after she accused both him and Scooter Braun of bullying her, after Scooter purchased Big Machine Records, who owns the majority of Taylor's master recordings.\n\nIn a blog post, Taylor claimed she was never given the choice to buy the masters herself and she is 'sad and grossed out' that they are now owned by Scooter, claiming it is her 'worst case scenario'.\n\nJustin - who is managed by Scooter - replied publicly, writing: 'What were you trying to accomplish by posting that blog? seems to me like it was to get sympathy u also knew that in posting that your fans would go and bully scooter.'\n\nThe message Taylor posted included an Instagram post of Justin Facetiming Scooter and Kanye West, with the caption 'taylor what up'.\n\nApologizing for his 'hurtful' message, Bieber said: 'Hey Taylor. First of all i would like to apologize for posting that hurtful instagram post, at the time i thought it was funny but looking back it was distasteful and insensitive.'", "description": "Hailey Baldwin has leapt to the defence of her husband Justin Bieber after he was attacked by Taylor Swift fans for 'mocking' the singer.", "authors": ["Dailymail.Com Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/17/19405142-0-image-a-22_1570465919759.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
