Under the restructuring terms, the leasing agreement with Cervejaria Petr\u00f3polis will cease to exist once that process is concluded.\n\nCervejaria Petr\u00f3polis, which is fighting in court for the right to maintain the leasing contract through 2024, declined to comment.\n\nBunge and Sodrugestvo did not immediately respond to a request for comment. CJ Selecta and seller Imcopa declined to comment.\n\nAn evaluation of the plants on sale in Imcopa\u2019s restructuring plan, dating back from 2017, states their combined value is 536.3 million reais.", "description": "At least three potential bidders have expressed an interest in buying two soy processing plants put up for sale by Brazilian grain crusher Imcopa Importa\u00e7\u00e3o, Exporta\u00e7\u00e3o e Ind\u00fastria de \u00d3leos SA, two sources familiar with the bidding process told Reuters.", "authors": ["Ana Mano", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
