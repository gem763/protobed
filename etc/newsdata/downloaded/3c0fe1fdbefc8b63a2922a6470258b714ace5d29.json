He said Uber viewed Cornershop as \"a concrete example\" of Khosrowshahi's new strategy to \"provide solutions to solve problems in people's daily lives.\"\n\nBoth Uber and Cornershop declined to comment further.\n\nNathan Lustig, a managing partner of Magma Partners, a seed stage venture capital fund for tech firms in Latin America, said Uber seemed to be gearing toward \"super-app\" status similar to Tencent Holdings' <0700.HK> WeChat and Rappi, backed by SoftBank <9984.T>.\n\nRappi has expanded at a breakneck pace in Latin America, with its restaurant delivery service emerging as a key competitor for Uber Eats.\n\nMexican antitrust officials earlier this year blocked a $225 million bid by Walmart to buy Cornershop, citing concerns the retail giant could not guarantee a level playing field for rival retailers.\n\nLustig said Cornershop had expanded rapidly since the Walmart deal fell through, resulting in a likely higher price tag for the Uber deal.\n\n\"I believe they grew the business multiple times since Walmart's deal was first announced,\" he said. \"Cornershop's tech and ideas work globally, so it's not just a Latin American bet.\"\n\nIn a statement, Uber said Cornershop would continue to operate under its current leadership, reporting to a board with majority Uber representation.\n\nCornershop has rapidly gained popularity in local markets, including Chile, where its uniformed staff are a common sight in the aisles of grocery stores hunting down orders for customers, before delivering them in branded, recyclable bags.\n\nNews of the deal comes amid a flurry of similar announcements from Uber, as it seeks to expand beyond its core taxi app.\n\nUber shares rose 4.8% in New York trading, although it was unclear whether the gains were related to the Cornershop move.\n\nThis week Uber launched a boat service in Nigeria's populous Lagos, expanded a helicopter taxi service in New York's JFK airport and began an app in Chicago to connect workers with businesses needing to fill available shifts.\n\nIncreased diversification comes as Uber's main ride hailing operations face mounting competition in Asia, and heightened U.S. regulatory scrutiny over the classification of its drivers as independent contractors.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Aislinn Laing and Dave Sherwood; additional reporting by Daina Beth Solomon; Editing by Christian Plumb and Tom Brown)", "description": "Uber Technologies Inc  said on Friday it would buy a majority stake in Chilean online grocery provider Cornershop as the ride hailing company seeks to widen its fast-growing food delivery app to include groceries and other goods.
