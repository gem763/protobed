AP\n\nFor all the talk of winning the \u201dwar\u201d up front ahead of the game, it was England\u2019s backs who had the decisive say, and particularly the George Ford/Owen Farrell axis at ten and twelve.\n\nIt seemed the axis that had been so influential in England\u2019s rebirth under Eddie Jones was cast aside ahead of this tournament, with Henry Slade and Manu Tuilagi developing chemistry in the centres.\n\nHowever Jones had never had opportunity to combine his two fly-halves with Tuilagi in midfield, and Slade\u2019s untimely injury over the summer meant England could push ahead with Ford-Farrell-Tuilagi in midfield.\n\nIt now seems foolish that any other midfield was ever contemplated. England are a better side with two distributors at ten and twelve, and Tuilagi can hold the defensive line in a manner that few other thirteens can.\n\nThis creates a defence that is too compact, with teams tending to focus on Tuilagi\u2019s game-breaking abilities in the carry, and not adequately spreading themselves.\n\nThe problem is, obviously, only exacerbated by losing a player. Ford and Farrell displayed their qualities to take advantage of an Argentina defence down a man.\n\nFirst and foremost was their ability to get the ball to width. With Elliot Daly beginning to flourish as a second or third receiver playmaking from the back, England were able to move the ball wide at will, and with Anthony Watson and Jonny May\u2019s raw pace able to stretch defences down the touchlines, Argentina\u2019s 14 men were forced to spread themselves wide to prevent England making easy metres and generating quick ball.\n\nArgentina didn\u2019t defend badly at all, considering the circumstances, but they were lacking in defensive stock.\n\nInvariably when you are down a man you either under-resource your defensive line or your backfield, and with two high-quality operators in Ford and Farrell, England could take advantage of either deficiency.\n\nArgentina wisely opted to more often leave space in the backfield, putting their spare man in the defensive line to cover the absence of Lavanini, and generally leaving just one man to cover in behind, with neither wing able to operate a pendulum (dropping back when the ball is on the opposite side of the pitch) given England\u2019s ability to get the ball wide quickly.\n\nFord and Farrell repeatedly kicked into the spaces left alongside Emiliano Boffelli, taking territory when it was offered and pushing the Pumas back.\n\nThat gave England a positional advantage, and they began to build pressure, not feeling any degree of urgency given Argentina\u2019s predicament.\n\nA criticism of Jones\u2019 team during the Six Nations was that they were a touch impatient, trying to force things in the red area rather than steadily building towards the score.\n\nEngland now appear to be a more patient side, and with Ford and Farrell calmly pulling the strings they broke Argentina down, utilising their bigger ball carriers intelligent to puncture holes, and then whipping the ball wide when opportunity presented itself.\n\nFord particularly was superb. The Leicester fly-half has developed his game over the last year or so, with his distribution now first rate and his territorial kicking far superior to where it was 12 months ago.\n\nTries for May, Daly, Youngs, and Ford himself took them to a comfortable bonus point win without having to truly get out of third gear, before fit again Jack Nowell and Luke Cowan-Dickie added a degree of gloss late on.\n\nThis was exactly the type of game that Jones would have wanted \u2013 a challenge, yes, but a victory that conserved energy and allowed a couple of returnees to reintegrate themselves.\n\nWhile England have yet to truly dazzle, they have taken maximum points from their first three games, and nobody has managed to push them particularly close thus far.\n\nAnd in Ford and Farrell they have the right hands in tandem at the tiller to guide them to World Cup contendership.", "description": "It wasn\u2019t quite the \u201cbattle\u201d that both teams predicted it would be, but England\u2018s win over Argentina\u00a0was an illustrative affair. It was something of\u00a0a shame that the game was effectively ended as a contest by a red card. The decision to send Tomas Lavanini off was absolutely the correct one \u2013 direct contact to the head of a tackled player, with force and without any mitigating", "authors": ["Harry Latham-Coyle"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/05/11/goerge-ford-analysis.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
