This time, he hopes to prevent the Astros from advancing.\n\nSigned by Tampa Bay last winter, Morton starts Game 3 in the best-of-five AL Division Series at Tropicana Field with his team down 2-0 to the Astros. Morton beat Oakland in last week\u2019s AL wild-card matchup.\n\nMorton faced his former team twice during the regular season, winning at home 4-2 on March 29 and losing 15-1 at Houston on Aug. 27.\n\n\u201cFor me, there\u2019s really no mystery with the Astros. It\u2019s just kind of they are who they are to me. I mean, I know those guys pretty well, on and off the field,\u201d Morton said. \u201cI\u2019m well aware of the challenges they present. I know what they\u2019re made of. I\u2019m just going to go out there \u2026 and try to make pitches and challenge them.\u201d\n\nZack Greinke pitches for Houston, following dominant starts by teammates Justin Verlander and Gerrit Cole in the first two games. Greinke is 8-1 with 3.02 ERA in 10 starts since being acquired by the Astros from Arizona at the trade deadline. In his last start, the right-hander came within two outs of throwing a no-hitter against Seattle.\n\nWAIT AND SEE\n\nThe Braves are one win from reaching the NL Championship Series for the first time since 2001. Who they\u2019ll send to the mound at Busch Stadium trying to wrap it up, they\u2019re not ready to say.\n\n\u201cWe really haven\u2019t had a chance - when I get back in there, things will calm down and we\u2019ll talk about that,\u201d manager Brian Snitker said after Atlanta rallied in the ninth inning to beat St. Louis 3-1 on Sunday for a 2-1 lead in the NLDS.\n\nOne possible option is bringing back Dallas Keuchel on short rest after he pitched 4 2/3 innings in series opener Thursday.\n\nDakota Hudson will start Game 4 for the Cardinals. The rookie right-hander is making his postseason debut after going 16-7 with a 3.35 ERA this year.\n\nYANKED\n\nHammered in two games at Yankee Stadium, the Twins try to avoid elimination in the ALDS when Jake Odorizzi (15-7, 3.51 ERA) faces New York.\n\nThe Yankees outscored Minnesota 18-6 in taking a 2-0 lead. If the Twins get swept, they would tie the North American major pro league record of 16 straight postseason losses, set by the NHL\u2019s Chicago Blackhawks from 1975-79. Minnesota\u2019s last 12 postseason defeats have all been against New York.\n\nLuis Severino starts for New York. The 25-year-old All-Star didn\u2019t make his regular-season debut until Sept. 17, spending most of the year rehabbing a lat muscle injury sustained while warming up for his first spring training start.\n\nSeverino joked he doesn\u2019t remember his first career start in the playoffs, when he allowed three runs to the Twins in 2017 while getting just one out in a wild-card game the Yankees rallied. He beat Cleveland in the 2017 ALDS but gave up six runs over three innings in a loss to Boston in the Division Series last year. Overall, he\u2019s 1-2 with a 6.26 ERA in the postseason.\n\nMAXED UP\n\nWashington ace Max Scherzer is set to start Game 4 of the NL Division Series - no more mystery or intrigue.\n\nThe Nationals originally had said Scherzer was expected to pitch Game 3 Sunday night. But during the day, they announced An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez would make the start - Los Angeles won 10-4 for a 2-1 lead in the matchup.\n\nScherzer was summoned from the bullpen by manager Dave Martinez in Game 2. The three-time Cy Young Award winner struck out all three batters he faced in Washington\u2019s 4-2 victory at Dodger Stadium on Friday night.\n\n\u201cWe talked after the game. Throwing Sanchez Game 3 and letting me get an extra day would probably be the best thing for me and for the team,\u201d Scherzer said Sunday. \u201cSo that was Davey\u2019s decision, and it\u2019s Davey\u2019s call.\u201d\n\nRich Hill starts for the Dodgers. He overcame knee trouble in September to put himself in position to pitch.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A look at what's happening around the majors Monday:", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/03/rays_athletics_baseball_95869_c0-125-3000-1874_s1770x1032.jpg?f52fad753beb582a85b1710fc9f6c2ec1ddbd99f", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
