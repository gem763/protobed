(Photo: Getty Images)\n\nNever married, never had children.\n\nOprah Winfrey, 65, is explaining why.\n\nIn an interview with \"People\" magazine's \"Women Changing the World\" issue out this week, the entertainment media mogul said she gave consideration to both marriage and kids. While she decided against both, she doesn't regret it.\n\nShe met longtime love Stedman Graham, now 68, at a charity event in 1986 and was once engaged to him. It was then she considered children, she told \"People.\"\n\n\"At one point in Chicago, I had bought an additional apartment because I was thinking, \u2018Well, if we get married, I\u2019m going to need room for children,' \" Winfrey said.\n\nOprah Winfrey met her longtime love, Stedman Graham, at a charity event in 1986. (Photo: Getty Images)\n\n'Sacrifice' and 'messed-up people'\n\nWinfrey said that years of working on \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" helped her to see that motherhood requires serious responsibility and \"sacrifice.\"\n\n\"I realized, 'Whoa, I\u2019m talking to a lot of messed-up people, and they are messed up because they had mothers and fathers who were not aware of how serious that job is,' \" she said.\n\nWinfrey added that she knows herself well enough to know that she lacks \"the ability to compartmentalize\" the way other women do. Because of this, she holds mothers in the \"highest regard.\"\n\n\"I don't don\u2019t know how you do that all day long,\" she said. \"Nobody gives women the credit they deserve.\"\n\nWinfrey said the show required 17-hour workdays and she would return home to her dogs and to Graham. She said her partner let her be who she needed to be in the world.\n\n\"He\u2019s never demanding anything from me like, 'Where\u2019s my breakfast? Where\u2019s my dinner?' Never any of that, which I believed would have changed had we married.\"\n\n\"Both he and I now say, 'If we had married, we would not be together,' \u201d she added. \"No question about it \u2013 we would not stay married because of what that would have meant to him, and I would have had my own ideas about it.\"\n\n'I don\u2019t have regrets'\n\nWinfrey said she doesn't look back and wonder at what might have been. In a way, she has fulfilled a maternal role, she said.\n\nSithokomele P.

I also believe that part of the reason why I don\u2019t have regrets is because I got to fulfill it in the way that was best for me: the Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy for Girls in South Africa,\" she said. \"Those girls fill that maternal fold that I perhaps would have had. In fact, they overfill \u2013 I\u2019m overflowed with maternal.\"\n\nREAD MORE\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/parenting/2019/10/10/oprah-winfrey-not-married-no-children-no-regrets/3930597002/", "description": "Years of doing \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" taught her that motherhood requires serious responsibility and \"sacrifice.\"", "authors": ["Sonja Haller", "Published P.M.
