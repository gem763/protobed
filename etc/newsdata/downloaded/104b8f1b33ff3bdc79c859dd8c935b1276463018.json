With Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party again withholding its support, the optimism is tinged with apprehension.\n\n\u201cWe have been here before,\u201d the chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, Mike Cherry, said Thursday.\n\nU.K. businesses see avoiding a no-deal rupture with the country\u2019s most important trading bloc as the overriding priority as it could bog down supply chains with customs checks and tariffs and upend arrangements that allow data to move freely across borders.\n\nAs companies digested the terms of the latest withdrawal agreement, some trade bodies were quick to urge lawmakers to ratify it on Saturday and put an end to three years of uncertainty that have clouded their prospects and hampered their investment plans. Ratifying the deal would trigger a transition period that preserves much of the current trading architecture, giving time to agree a new relationship.\n\n\u201cIt is now up to members of parliament to play their part and finally end the Brexit uncertainty that has been hanging over consumers and retailers,\u201d said Andrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium.\n\nVoting for a deal would prevent the worst no-deal hazards, unlock a transition period for striking future arrangements, and guarantee the rights of citizens living abroad. But it\u2019s far from perfect, said Carolyn Fairbairn, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, which claims to speak for about 190,000 businesses.\n\n\u201cThe deal remains inadequate on services, which make up 80% of the U.K. economy,\u201d she said in an emailed statement. \u201cAnd big questions remain about the feasibility of negotiating a new trade agreement deep enough in a 14-month transition period.\u201d\n\nShares of Tata Motors Ltd., owner of the luxury Jaguar and Land Rover brands, jumped the most in a decade after the deal was announced, although Jaguar Land Rover was hesitant to declare an end to the Brexit struggles of Britain\u2019s car industry.\n\n\u201cWe welcome the latest developments and await the next steps, but we cannot comment further until we have considered the detail of the deal and know whether it is supported by Parliament,\u201d the company said in a statement.\n\nOne possible sticking point for the auto industry revolves around \u201cappropriate and modern\u201d rules-of-origin provisions that would potentially add cost and complexity to manufacturing in the U.K., as carmakers would have to certify where parts came from. Under the plan put forward by former Prime Minister Theresa May, these checks wouldn\u2019t be needed.\n\n(Updates with small-business comments from sixth paragraph)\n\n--With assistance from Eric Pfanner and Siddharth Philip.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Thomas Seal in London at tseal@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Rebecca Penty at rpenty@bloomberg.net, Thomas Pfeiffer, John Bowker\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- British business allowed itself a moment of hope as Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the European Union reached an agreement to ward off a no-deal Brexit.Johnson now has to succeed where predecessor Theresa May failed three times and win approval for the deal from the U.K. parliament.", "authors": ["Thomas Seal"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/12hQ47aH6fNZszkEHCTezQ--~B/aD04OTg7dz0xMjk2O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/46b172c470e5036098880b6b20f4df74", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
