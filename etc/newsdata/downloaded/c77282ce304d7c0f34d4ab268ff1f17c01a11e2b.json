But I wanted to take the risk.\u2019\n\nDuring a demonstration on the last day of election campaigning in 2011, he saw police gun down several of his comrades in a massacre which claimed the lives of 57 people.\n\nWhile behind bars, Mosantu was forced to eat undercooked food which made him sick and had to share one bottle of water between 10 inmates at a time.\n\nThe activist, who is in his late twenties, was handcuffed with legs his tied, beaten with whips and had cold water poured on him.\n\nOn another occasion, he was deprived of food and forced to sit in the sun for hours at a time.\n\nMosantu eventually got his rejection overturned through an appeal, but is not sure what will happen if he applies to stay in the country permenantly (Picture: Joe Newman for

kind of \u2018mental torture\u2019 after making it to the UK in 2015.\n\nHe still doesn\u2019t know who paid for it, but a smuggler picked him up from prison during his last stretch and took him across the border to Angola.\n\nBut his life was still in danger there and he had to live in hiding in case someone recognised him and alerted DRC authorities.\n\nThe agent arranged a fake Angolan passport for him to travel to the UK, but Mosantu kept a Congolese voter ID card with him to prove his identity.\n\nDisplaced civilians fleeing violence in the Congo (Picture: Getty/Asia

prevent people being sent back to dangerous countries to appeal (Picture: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nAfter claiming asylum, he was given a seven hour grilling from Home Office officials who he says refused to believe he was from the DRC.\n\nHe answered very specific questions about local bus routes and directions on how to get around the capital of Kinshasa but says nothing was good enough.\n\nHis voter ID card was sent off for analysis at the National Document Fraud Unit (NDFU) and came back with \u2018inconclusive results\u2019.\n\nMosantu also got a friend back home, who has since disappeared, to post his school certificate, a background check form needed to go to university, and a birth certificate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe says \u2018aggressive\u2019 interviewers were suspicious about him wanting to speak his native language of Lingala instead of French \u2013 both of which are spoken in the Congo.\n\nWhen officers asked if they could call the London branch of the political opposition to confirm his identity, he says they did not guarantee his safety if he agreed.\n\nPoor job prospects for young people and a distrust in the political system often sparks unrest during DRC elections

over the standard six months \u2013 before getting a refusal letter, which said his \u2018nationality is doubted\u2019.\n\nIt admonished him for choosing to do the interview in Lingala, even though he agreed to take a French test, which was never carried out in the end.\n\nHe added: \u2018They said \u201cyou need to accept you\u2019re Angolan,\u201d there was his pressure to accept, to accept everything.\n\n\u2018It makes you feel down, like you\u2019re nothing, I was treated like a criminal.\u2019\n\nHe said excessively long lines of questioning and the hostile environment he was in \u2018makes you feel like you\u2019re in prison\u2019.\n\nFreedom From Torture\u2019s senior policy advisor Natasha Tsangarides said there\u2019s a danger of the process \u2018re-traumatising\u2019

managed to get the move overtrned in a legal appeal a few months ago.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the letter being delivered to the Home Secretary today, Freedom from Torture says: \u2018Too many people seeking refuge in this country are disbelieed and wrongly turned away by Home Office decision-makers.\n\n\u2018In order to prove they need safety here, they often must endure an appeals process that is lengthy, traumatic and costly to the taxpayer.\u2019\n\nIt claims nearly two in five appeals against asylum refusals last year were succesful meaning many people are needlessly being put at risk.\n\nThe charity\u2019s Lessons Not Learned report claims little has changed to rid the Home Office of its \u2018culture of disbelief\u2019 and \u2018inefficient decision-making\u2019 despite 15 years of research and recommendations to change.\n\nCalling for Patel to accept the report\u2019s findings, the letter adds: \u2018We believe that the impetus for reform must come from government. We know that inside the Home Office there is appetite for this.\n\nThousands of displaced people take refuge in July 2019 in the grounds of a Catholic Church in Drodo, east of the country (Picture: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nCopyright: 2011 Gallo Images\n\nMosantu was not safe in neighbouring Angola and had to use a fake passport to get to the UK (Picture: Joe Newman for Metro.co.uk)\n\nCongolese National Police patrol the streets of Goma on December 28, 2018 (Picture: AFP/Getty)\n\n\u2018Until it is given full backing by ministers, however, real and lasting change will not be achievable.\n\nThe letter calls for the department to \u2018ensure that the correct law and policy is used in deciding applications\u2019, for decisions to be \u2018right first time\u2019 and for a \u2018culture of humanity and protection\u2019 to be instated.\n\nIt adds: \u2018Britain is at a crossroads. Successive governments have failed to counter toxic narratives around immigration and asylum and lead an efficient department that provides protection from persecution to all those who need it.\n\n\u2018Change is possible, and essential, but requires commitment at the highest level.\u2019\n\nThe Home Office has been approached for comment.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
