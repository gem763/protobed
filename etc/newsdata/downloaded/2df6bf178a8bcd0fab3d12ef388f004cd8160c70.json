His leg looked mangled, even after three years of healing. \"I was shot 14 times and left for dead,\" he said.\n\nRichardson was just 16 years old when another young man he thought was his friend riddled him with bullets. But Sally Hazelgrove was one of the first faces he saw when he woke up from a coma in the hospital.\n\nThat\u2019s one of the reasons why Richardson, now 19, is fiercely defending the woman known as \"Miss Sally,\" who is embroiled in controversy after a viral video showed her cutting off his dreadlocks two years ago.\n\nThe social media onslaught began when Hazelgrove\u2019s organization, Crushers Club, which helps at-risk youth in Chicago through boxing and mentoring, received a $200,000 donation from Inspire Change, a social justice collaboration between Roc Nation, the company founded by Jay-Z, and the NFL. A mostly unknown Twitter account with the handle @RzstProgramming dug up a 2016 tweet from the Crushers Club account that shows Hazelgrove, who is white, cutting off the dreadlocks of two black male teenagers -- Richardson and another unidentified teen.\n\nThe tweet, which Hazelgrove wrote, was captioned, \"And another Crusher let me cut his dreads off! It\u2019s symbolic of change and their desire for a better life!\"\n\nToday, the NFL\u2019s #InspireChange \u201csocial justice\u201d group is funding & visiting a non-profit that wants to cut off the locks of Chicago Black youth for \u201ca better life.\u201d https://t.co/JdvWliIEqv pic.twitter.com/GpPV0DqK2M \u2014 Resist Programming \ud83d\udef0 (@RzstProgramming) September 5, 2019\n\nThe filmmaker Ava DuVernay, who is behind \"A Wrinkle in Time\" and the Netflix miniseries \"When They See Us\" about the Central Park Five, retweeted the original video last weekend, helping to set off a firestorm and charges of racism against Hazelgrove.\n\nI\u2019d like to have a conversation with you and those young people about dreads and desires and dreams. About dreads and \u201ca better life.\u201d\n\n\n\nShame on anyone supporting this full-on nonsense. https://t.co/NgHmoOKf0r \u2014 Ava DuVernay (@ava) September 6, 2019\n\nDuVernay, who is black and wears dreadlocks herself, also started a hashtag #loclife and encouraged people to share pictures celebrating the style. For many in the black community, dreadlocks symbolize an embracing of natural hair and are a symbol of pride -- deeply personal and political.\n\nControversy erupted late last year after a New Jersey wrestler was forced to cut his dreadlocks or forfeit a match. And a 2017 study found that black women with natural hair are often placed at a disadvantage in the workplace.\n\nDuVernay's #loclife post received over 50,000 likes, many from the association of social media accounts known as \u2018Black Twitter\u2019 \u2013 accounts run mostly by people of color who often use the platform to sometimes express outrage over social injustice as well as discuss culture, politics and topics.\n\nThe backlash to the video was so intense that Hazelgrove was forced to make an apology via the Crushers Club Twitter account.\n\n\"The Crusher\u2019s Club does not have any policies prohibiting dreadlocks \u2013 we welcome all hairstyles from our youth. On two occasions, our kids looked to change their hairstyles and asked us to assist. I understand how my social media posts could be interpreted as insensitive, but that was never my intention,\" she wrote. She declined to comment further when reached by ABC News.\n\nRichardson said it was a huge misunderstanding and was so irked he made a video defending Hazelgrove and Crushers Club, which was posted by media outlet TMZ.\n\nHe told ABC News that he felt that dreadlocks were a hairstyle that represented his life as part of a gang. After he was shot and joined the Crushers Club, he wanted to cut them off to disassociate himself from gang culture.\n\nEmilie Richardson/ABC News\n\n\"You shouldn\u2019t judge a person over a picture,\" he told ABC News. \"Because that\u2019s not who they are. And they don\u2019t know Sally. Sally is a good woman. All I know her to do is help and love people.\"\n\nRichardson, who now works with Crushers Club as a supervisor and is trying to finish high school, was adamant that he was the one who asked Hazelgrove to cut his hair. He said he felt comfortable enough to ask both because of his relationship with her, but also because she is the mother of biracial kids.\n\nDuVernay did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe individual who purports to run the Twitter account that initially shared the tweet of Hazelgrove cutting dreadlocks told ABC News in a message: \u201cWhen Jay-Z announced the Inspire Change initiative would be the 'actionable items' answer to the kneeling protests and the non-profits would be 'hand-selected and vetted' I decided check for myself,\u201d the individual, who did not identify wrote. \u201cIt was clear that this group had not been vetted and was practicing assimilationist views.\u201d\n\nHazelgrove launched the Crushers Club, where young men can go to learn to box and interact with mentors, in 2013, three years after moving to the Englewood neighborhood, which had historically high crime and incarceration rates.\n\nElizabeth Talbert said the organization helped turn her son\u2019s life around.\n\nMore than six years ago, her son Elijah Tribitt, who had been struggling in school, came to her and said he wanted to try boxing. Talbert was familiar with Hazelgrove, who she often saw picking up kids from school and dropping them off at Crushers Club.\n\n\"My son was failing at school,\" Talbert said. \"Miss Sally got him a tutor \u2013 now he\u2019s 4.0. And still boxing.\"\n\nEmilie Richardson/ABC News\n\nTalbert, who herself wears dreadlocks, was also frustrated with the criticism leveled against the organization. She said she finds it \u201cunnecessary.\u201d\n\n\"What does the hair have to do with the kids? No one else in the community put in that much time, energy and love,\" Talbert said.\n\n\"People was in that neighborhood for years, never helped a child out,\" Talbert said. \"Let me help you get off the streets. Let\u2019s play basketball. Let\u2019s pick up trash around the neighborhood. Let\u2019s clean the parks up. Those are things Sally do with the kids.\"\n\nTalbert said that Crushers Club helps the kids and their parents in the community in other ways, as well.\n\n\"When school [time] comes, the whole gym room is amazing,\" she said. \"Full of bookbags, school supplies. Some kids can\u2019t even get that at home.\"\n\nBoth Talbert and Richardson say they can understand the reactions to the controversial tweet, and the uncomfortable optics of a white woman cutting a young black man\u2019s dreads with the message of giving him a better life. But they remain steadfast in her support for Hazelgrove.\n\n\"People are quick to judge because she\u2019s a white woman,\" said Talbert. \"But she sees things in these kids that other people don\u2019t.\"", "description": "Kobe Richardson is fierce in defending Sally Hazelgrove after filmmaker Ava DuVernay and thousands across social media lashed out in a virtual feeding frenzy.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/kobe-richardson-1-abc-er-190909_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
