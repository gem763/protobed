REUTERS/Mike Blake\n\nThe candidates who participated in Thursday night\u2019s debate in Houston, and those scrambling to try to qualify for next month\u2019s debate in Ohio, have less than five months to plead their case to voters before the first nominating contest in Iowa on Feb. 3, 2020.\n\nBiden on Friday held campaign events in Houston, where a day earlier he clashed with liberal rivals Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders on healthcare, challenging the two U.S. senators to be honest about the cost of their plans.\n\nBiden came under fire from former U.S. Housing Secretary Julian Castro, who incorrectly accused the former vice president of forgetting what he had just in an exchange seen as an attack on Biden\u2019s age. And Biden\u2019s comments about racial inequality in schools prompted a rebuke from rival U.S. Senator Cory Booker.\n\n\u201cWe are at a tough point right now, because there\u2019s a lot of people concerned about Joe Biden\u2019s ability to carry the ball all the way across the end line without fumbling,\u201d Booker said on CNN after the debate.\n\nBut the top 10 Democratic candidates, sharing the debate stage for the first time after the party toughened the rules to qualify, also stressed their shared opposition to Republican President Donald Trump and scaled down some of the bickering that marked the first two debates this summer.\n\nBiden was sharper and more aggressive than in the earlier matchups, leaving him in a strong position as his rivals evaluate the best strategy in the race to pick a Democratic challenger to Trump in the November 2020 election.\n\nAside from Biden, Sanders and Warren, none of the other 17 Democratic contenders is regularly hitting double digits in support in opinion polls.\n\nSeveral major events are on the campaign schedule in coming weeks. Biden, Sanders and at least three other candidates are expected on Monday to attend the Galivants Ferry Stump meeting in South Carolina.\n\nThe next weekend, 18 candidates will attend the Polk County, Iowa, steak fry, a regular stop for presidential contenders, and at least 10 candidates will participate in a forum on LGBTQ issues.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee announced on Friday the next debate will be held in Westerville, Ohio, on Oct. 15 and possibly Oct. 16 depending on the number of qualifying candidates.\n\nAt least one more candidate, billionaire activist Tom Steyer, has met the tougher qualifications for the next debate.\n\nCASTRO ON THE OFFENSIVE\n\nCastro led the charge on Thursday against Biden by accusing him of flip-flopping in his description of his own healthcare proposal.\n\n\u201cAre you forgetting what you said two minutes ago?\u201d Castro, 44, asked Biden, 76, who has faced questions about his age.\n\nLater, he accused Biden of being quick to tie himself to former President Barack Obama when it suited him and walk away when it did not. Biden was Obama\u2019s vice president for eight years.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fulfilling the legacy of Barack Obama and you\u2019re not,\u201d said Castro, who also served in the Obama administration.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019ll be a surprise to him,\u201d Biden responded.\n\nBiden, who served under the first black U.S. president and enjoys strong support from likely black primary voters, also drew criticism for his response to whether Americans had a duty to repair the slavery\u2019s legacy.\n\nHe transitioned into an answer related to education that suggested bringing social workers into black families\u2019 homes to \u201chelp them deal with how to raise their children\u201d and having a \u201crecord player on at night\u201d to help with language acquisition.\n\nBooker said on CNN after the debate that Biden is sometimes \u201cmeandering in his speech.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s talking about people in communities like mine listening to record players. ... There are definitely moments when you listen to Joe Biden and you just wonder,\u201d Booker said.\n\nAntjuan Seawright, a Democratic strategist in South Carolina, which hosts the fourth nominating contest next year and the first that will have a sizeable proportion of black voters, said he did not think Biden\u2019s remarks would hurt him. Black voters have a \u201cgenuine love and affection\u201d for Biden, Seawright said, and his decades-long political career speaks for itself.\n\n\u201cThey know who he is, there\u2019s no second-guessing his record,\u201d he said.\n\nMost candidates avoided the attacks that marked the first two rounds of the debates. Those exchanges had dismayed some Democrats, who urged the candidates to focus on laying out their own positive agendas.\n\nBiden praised former U.S. Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke for his work after a mass shooting in his hometown of El Paso, Texas, drawing a sustained ovation from the debate audience.\n\nFormer U.S. Housing Secretary Julian Castro walks in the \"Spin Room\" following the conclusion of the third 2020 Democratic U.S. presidential debate in Houston, Texas, U.S. September 12, 2019. REUTERS/Jonathan Bachman\n\nO\u2019Rourke, who has called for gun licensing and a mandatory gun buyback for assault weapons, was asked if he was going to take away people\u2019s guns.\n\n\u201cI am if it was a weapon that was designed to kill people on a battlefield,\u201d he said. \u201c... Hell yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.\u201d\n\nThat response quickly drew criticism from Republicans. U.S. Representative Liz Cheney, a member of the House Republican leadership, on Friday called it \u201cone of the most concerning moments that came out of a debate that had a lot of concerning moments.\u201d", "description": "Former Vice President Joe Biden returned to the campaign trail on Friday after a Democratic debate that largely reinforced his front-runner status for the party's presidential nomination, leaving his rivals searching for how to wrest away the top spot.", "authors": ["Ernest Scheyder", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429398283&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C0SG", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
