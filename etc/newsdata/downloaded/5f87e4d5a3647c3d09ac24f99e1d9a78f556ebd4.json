All of the DNA used in the study came from people living in southern Africa today, including the Khoisan, a population who speak with \u201cclick\u201d consonants and traditionally practiced foraging.\n\nHayes and her colleagues used the mitochondrial DNA, which is passed down exclusively from mother to child, to map out the oldest known maternal line of humans alive today. According to their report in the journal Nature, the so-called L0 lineage and its sub-branches point back to an \u201cancestral home\u201d that spreads from Namibia across Botswana and into Zimbabwe.\n\nThe researchers next turned to geological, archaeological and fossil evidence to glean details about the climate and broader ecosystem in the region at the time. They found that a body of water the size of New Zealand, called Lake Makgadikgadi, once dominated the area, but had started to break up into a massive wetland 200,000 years ago. \u201cIt would have been very lush and it would have provided a suitable habitat for modern humans and wildlife to have lived,\u201d Hayes said.\n\nAccording to the DNA analyses, the L0 lineage split 130,000 years ago when some of the founder population moved north-east along a green vegetated route that opened up as rains drenched the arid land. A second wave of migration headed south-west about 20,000 years later as rainfall also increased vegetation in that direction. Those who headed north-east gave rise to farming populations, while those who went south became coastal foragers, the scientists believe. \u201cEssentially, these ancestors were the first human explorers,\u201d Hayes said.\n\nNeanderthal footprints found in France offer snapshot of their lives Read more\n\nBut other researchers are not convinced. \u201cI\u2019m definitely cautious about using modern genetic distributions to infer exactly where ancestral populations were living 200,000 years ago, particularly in a continent as large and complex as Africa,\u201d said Chris Stringer, who studies human origins at the Natural History Museum in London. \u201cLike so many studies that concentrate on one small bit of the genome, or one region, or one stone tool industry, or one \u2018critical\u2019 fossil, it cannot capture the full complexity of our mosaic origins, once other data are considered.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Vanessa Hayes speaks to Ju\u01c0\u2019hoansi people in Namibia.

Further studies, which have looked at whole genomes, point to populations who migrated out of Africa originating in the continent\u2019s east. \u201cThese and many other data suggest that we are an amalgam of ancestry from different regions of Africa with, of course, the addition of interbreeding from other human groups outside the continent,\u201d he said.\n\nSarah Tishkoff, a geneticist at the University of Pennsylvania, also raised doubts. \u201cHow can they know that there aren\u2019t old lineages in other regions if they\u2019re not included in the study?\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt is not possible to make inferences about the geographical origin of modern humans in Africa based solely on patterns of variation in modern populations. This is because humans migrate over long distances. They migrated out of Africa and across the globe within the past 80,000 years and they have migrated across Africa in the recent and ancient past.\u201d\n\nRebecca Ackermann, an archaeologist at the University of Cape Town, said the study appeared to brush aside extensive evidence that suggests the roots of our species are pan-African and beyond. \u201cDrawing sweeping conclusions about places of origin from analyses of this tiny part of the modern genome is deeply problematic and outdated,\u201d she said.", "description": "Other scientists raise questions about results, which were based on DNA samples", "authors": ["Ian Sample"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/875f103d3d7f6684f6fe042a3bf6a393df39f23d/0_282_5200_3120/master/5200.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d9b5c63ecffc9afe47be7baf42205e17", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
