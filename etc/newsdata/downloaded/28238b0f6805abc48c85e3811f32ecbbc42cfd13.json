This is how our interactions in VR and AR can one day look. It can change the way we connect.\u201d\n\nMr Bosworth goes on to explain exactly how this technology works, stating: \u201cYou have neurons in your spinal cord that send electrical signals to your hand muscles telling them to move in specific ways such as to click a mouse or press a button.\n\n\u201cThe wristband will decode those signals and translate them into a digital signal your device can understand, empowering you with control over your digital life.\u201d\n\nFollowing Facebook's announcement of the acquisition, CTRL-Labs shared a message across its social media platforms that it is \"thrilled \" to join Facebook Reality Labs, however not everyone was happy about the news.\n\nRecent scandals involving how Facebook handles and uses people's personal data raised some questions about the ethics of such technology being used by the company.\n\n\"Great for them, disappointing for the rest of us,\" wrote tech analyst Azeem Azhar. \"Facebook needs to inveigle itself into our lives less, not more.\"\n\nCTRL-Labs\u2019 wristband is not the only brain-computer interface that Facebook will be working on, having already unveiled a headset capable of transferring a person\u2019s thoughts directly onto a computer screen.\n\nA paper describing the mind-reading technology was published in Nature Communications earlier this year, revealing how the headset can decode brain activity to instantly transcribe what a person is saying into digital text.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re standing on the edge of the next great wave of human-oriented computing,\u201d Facebook said at the time.\n\n\u201cOne in which the combined technologies of AR and VR converge and revolutionise how we interact with the world around us \u2013 as well as the ways in which we workm play, and connect.\u201d", "description": "Facebook has acquired neural interface startup CTRL-Labs in a deal expected to be worth around $1 billion (\u00a3800m).
