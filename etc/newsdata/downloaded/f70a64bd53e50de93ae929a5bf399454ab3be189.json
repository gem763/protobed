We have to worry about what we're doing. He has to train hard.\n\n\"I feel that he has more pressure than I do. I just have to do what I have to do, and just let my hands go and focus.\"", "description": "Anthony Joshua and Andy Ruiz Jr are both set to come in lighter than first time around when they enter the ring for their rematch", "authors": ["Rich Jones", "Image", "Getty Images", "Piotr Molecki East News Rex", "Action Images Via Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20575253.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Andy-Ruiz-Jr-v-Anthony-Joshua-2-Clash-on-the-Dunes-Press-Conference.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
