The couple then ditched the van and drove off in the pickup truck and have not been seen since, Gonzales said.\n\nU.S. Marshals Service via AP\n\n\"We believe based on tips, calls into the Marshals Service from informants, from interviews, that the Barksdales were possibly east\" of the Snowflake, Arizona, area, Gonzales said, where some people live \"off the grid\" and can easily \"hide out.\"\n\n\u201cWe spent almost two weeks ... working this case around the clock since their escape,\" Gonzales said. \"We have not had any solid leads where they might be.\"\n\nAuthorities are now changing the direction of the investigation from a \"rapid manpower search to an intense fugitive search,\" Gonzales said.\n\n\"Instead of having 40, 50 police officers, agents on the ground, we're going to pull back a little bit, reset our investigation, go over other leads,\" Gonzales said.\n\nThe Barksdales are believed to be armed and dangerous and anyone with any information is urged to call the Marshal Service, Gonzales said.\n\nSusan Barksdale was not added to 15 Most Wanted List because her husband is the primary focus of the murder case, Gonzales said.\n\nThe pickup truck is described as a red GMC Sierra with Arizona license plate number 127XTY. A $5,000 reward is also available for the pickup truck, Gonzales said.", "description": "Blane Barksdale and his wife escaped by overpowering the transport team.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/blane-barksdale-flt-rt-ps-190910_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
