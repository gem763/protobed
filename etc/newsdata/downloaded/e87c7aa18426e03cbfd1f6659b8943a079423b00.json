In fact, since its IPO in 2002, the PIMCO Corporate & Income Opportunities Fund ( ) has given investors double the S&P 500\u2019s return.\n\nThe Power of a Top-Notch CEF\n\nPTY SPY Total Return 20yr Chart\n\nA lot of advisors dismiss funds that beat the S&P 500 in a year or two as simply lucky\u2014but that doesn\u2019t explain PTY\u2019s 777% return in 17 years. And a deeper look tells us a lot about CEFs and how we can harness them to retire earlier and lock in a massive income stream that too many pros say is unattainable.\n\nHow to Buy a 777% Winner (With an 8.6% Dividend) on the Cheap\n\nSince its inception, PTY has returned 13.6% annualized on its market price, while the S&P 500 has returned 9.3%. This outperformance is due to one factor: the fund\u2019s inherent return, despite the market\u2019s lower valuation of PTY.\n\nLet me explain the difference. If we look at the value of the portfolio of assets PTY holds, we see that this portfolio has risen 784.6% since its inception, a bit above the fund\u2019s market-price return.\n\nPortfolio Value Outraces Market Price\u2014and Hands Us a Discount\n\nPTY Price NAV 20yr Chart\n\nIn other words, PTY\u2019s portfolio gains and the dividends the fund has paid out, if reinvested, are greater than the market price you\u2019d pay for PTY if you bought it now.\n\nThis is in large part compounding magic: when you reinvest 8.6% dividends in such a high-performing fund, your total return is bound to grow. But the other part of the story is PTY\u2019s portfolio itself\u2014the real source of its massive outperformance\u2014and PIMCO\u2019s skill in managing it.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at that now.\n\nA Misunderstood Fund With an Undervalued Edge\n\nPTY\u2019s portfolio consists of $2 billion worth of a variety of debt instruments:\n\nIf we focus on the market value (MV) column, we see that the biggest allocation is to mortgage bonds (32.36%), separated into non-agency and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS\u2019s).\n\nThese are often depicted as complicated and exotic derivatives, but they\u2019re pretty simple at their core: imagine taking a large number of mortgages, putting them together in a single portfolio, then selling portions of that portfolio to investors.\n\nPTY would be one of these investors, because it can get less exposure to any one single mortgage, helping insulate its portfolio, even if housing crashes like in 2008. (It\u2019s important to note that PTY survived 2008 and kept beating stocks during that crash).\n\nThe other large exposure, to high-yield credit, is to bonds from corporations with lower credit ratings. Think of this as a group of loans that companies take out and pay back at a higher interest rate. With defaults in these loans staying below 2% most of the time, it\u2019s a lower-risk bet than many people think.\n\nBut it\u2019s even less risky for PIMCO, because it\u2019s the world\u2019s second-largest bond buyer. It can access top-quality bonds and information about companies that most other investors can\u2019t. This edge has helped PTY crush the market for decades. And since they still have that advantage, this outperformance will likely continue.\n\nThe Income Key to Financial Independence\n\nA lot of investors hear things like \u201cMBS\u2019s\u201d and \u201chigh-yield bonds\u201d and get scared. Others cynically say that this kind of outperformance can\u2019t last. But PTY not only survived the worst recession in living memory, its portfolio recovered faster than the S&P 500. And it paid out a high level of income throughout the crisis.\n\nThis is what really matters. Investors who held PTY during the crash saw unrealized losses in their portfolios\u2014but they also lost no money if they didn\u2019t sell. And PTY\u2019s huge income stream makes it possible to hold during tough times.\n\nRemember: PTY\u2019s dividend yield is 8.6%. That means investors get $716.67 per month for every $100,000 they invest. If you wanted that same income stream from an S&P 500 income fund, you\u2019d need to invest $450,000.\n\nYet financial advisors tell their clients to tolerate the pathetic yield they get from the stock market, because they don\u2019t understand how funds like PTY have been crushing the market for years. But PTY\u2019s record speaks for itself.\n\nAnd PTY isn\u2019t the only CEF that\u2019s crushed the index. It isn\u2019t even the best-performing CEF, or the highest yielding. There\u2019s a whole universe of CEFs out there that you can harness for financial independence.\n\nAnd now I want to introduce you to 5 of them with 8%+ dividends and 20% gains ahead in the next 12 months \u2026\n\n5 More 8%+ Dividends Wall Street Hides From You\n\nBefore I do that, I have to tell you that advisors aren\u2019t the only ones trying to keep CEFs off your radar. The big fund companies are in on it, too!\n\nI\u2019m talking about massive providers of exchange-traded funds (ETFs), such as Vanguard and iShares. These firms throw big marketing dollars at ETFs, and because most of these funds are automated, their costs are next to nothing.\n\nTranslation: even the low management fees they collect are pure profit.\n\nBut CEFs are different: with average yields of 7% and up, they often beat ETFs on dividends alone! And that doesn\u2019t account for the performance a top-flight human manager can add on, especially in areas like high-yield bonds, preferred stocks and real estate investment trusts (REITs).\n\nI just showed you how PTY demolished its benchmarks while paying an 8.5% dividend\u2014and bear in mind that its return is net of fees.\n\nI don\u2019t know about you, but I don\u2019t mind paying a few hundred bucks more in fees if it will net me a market-crushing 777% return!\n\nWhich brings me to the 5 CEFs I want to show you now. They\u2019ve delivered their shareholders life-changing gains, they yield 8% on average (with the highest yielder of the bunch paying an outsized 9.3%), and they\u2019re all bargains now.\n\nThe upshot: they\u2019re primed for 20%+ price upside in the next 12 months or less!\n\nDisclosure: Brett Owens and Michael Foster are contrarian income investors who look for undervalued stocks/funds across the U.S. markets.
