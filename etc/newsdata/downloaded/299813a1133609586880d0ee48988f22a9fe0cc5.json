It\u2019s just been difficult to get much attention in a category so utterly dominated by a single player. Even still, the company has managed to hold onto the number two spot in global market share, according to recentish numbers. At 11.1 percent, it\u2019s a little less than a third of what Apple\u2019s been able to generate.\n\nThe line has been a fairly stark contrast to Apple\u2019s offerings. Samsung\u2019s smartwatch philosophy is in line with its mobile counterpart: offer variety and don\u2019t be afraid to try new things. Compare that to the Apple Watch\u2019s annual improvements. The company offers one, key product, opting to make a little bit better, piece by piece.\n\nAnnounced at the Unpacked event that gave us the S10 back in February, the Galaxy Watch Active presented a streamlining of the line. And simplified \u2014and, most notably, cheaper \u2014 take on the Tizen-powered wearable line. Honestly, that $200 price point was really the key, putting the device in line with Fitbit\u2019s relatively recent foray into the category.\n\nA mere six months later, it returned with the Galaxy Watch Active 2. The device brings a smattering of upgrades, including improved heart rate monitoring (with the ECG sensor currently still in beta) and the addition of both an LTE model and a larger 44mm version. Thankfully, it maintains a streamlined design that\u2019s a welcome alternative to some of Samsung\u2019s bigger, bulkier offerings.\n\nOddly, the company has opted to move away from the rotating mechanical bezel with the Active line, which has long been Samsung\u2019s key differentiator in the category \u2014 perhaps in the spirit of maintaining that kind of minimalism, The rotating mechanical bezel is, simply put, the best way I\u2019ve come across for interfacing with smartwatches, including Apple\u2019s crown.\n\nThe Active 2 attempts to adapt the feature into a digital version with haptic feedback. Essentially you swipe around the outer edge f the device and haptics simulate the clicking of the wheel. It works better than I\u2019d initially anticipated, but the lack of the original feature is still pretty glaring. Here\u2019s hoping the company rethinks the omission for future versions.\n\nAs with the latest Apple Watch, there\u2019s an always on screen option, though it\u2019s going to take its toll on battery life. With the feature off, however, I was able to get more than two days life on a single charge, which isn\u2019t too shabby. That\u2019s better than Apple, though both companies are still well behind what Fitbit\u2019s able to get out of a device.\n\nHonestly, in 2019, all smartphone makers should be pushing for ways to get more life on a charge \u2014 especially those offering some form of sleep tracking. Now that other features like ECG have begun to become ubiquitous, this ought to be the next big push for the industry at large.\n\nMy Style is a fun, but ultimately unnecessary trick, wherein the app lets you tailor the color of a watch face using a smartphone photo of what you\u2019re wearing. The app selection is still pretty limited, compared to Apple\u2019s offering, though some key features like Spotify are here. That now includes offline playlists. Other key apps like YouTube have been improved as well.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine the company catching up to an Apple on the third-party app side, but Samsung\u2019s long had one key advantage over the Apple Watch: Android compatibility. And with Google\u2019s Wear OS being fairly consistently underwhelming, Samsung\u2019s got some real opportunity to capture even more marketshare.\n\nIt would be nice if the Active Watch 2 was a bit more aggressively priced. Apple\u2019s decision to keep older units around means you can pick up, say the Series 3 for $200. There\u2019s also the $200 Fitbit Versa 2. Some may find the $280 price point worth it for the (forthcoming) addition of things like ECG, but for most consumers, the $200 original Watch Active continues to be the better deal.", "description": "Samsung makes good, underrated smartwatches.
