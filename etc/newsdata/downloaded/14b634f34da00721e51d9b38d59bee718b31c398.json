Away from the glamorous beaches and Christ statue, the slums of Brazil\u2019s postcard city are in a constant state of war between drug trafficking factions like Red Command (CV), Amigos dos Amigos (ADA), and Third Command, as well as police and vigilante militias made up of rogue officers. Rodrigo works for Red Command near the neighborhood of Tijuca.\n\nHey, you around?\n\nYeah I\u2019m here bro but when are you gonna learn fucking Portuguese?\n\nSorry. What do you sell and where?\n\nI don\u2019t actually sell, I make deliveries. I\u2019m an airplane, which means you see me or give me a call, hand me the money, then I\u2019ll go get the stuff from my morro [\"hill,\" synonymous with \"favela\" in Rio]. We\u2019ve got all the kinds of drugs you have in Europe.\n\nI can get you coke bags for 30, 40, or 50 reais [40 reais is around $10], weed, crack, ecstasy. But the weed we have in Brazil is crap. Most of it comes from Paraguay. For friends I have one price, for unknown customers another. I make about 10-15 reals [$2.50-3.60] commission each time.\n\nHow long have you been in the game and how did you get into it?\n\nSelling drugs in the morro is like a culture. I was born seeing this culture, it\u2019s not unusual for me. My granddad sold drugs in the morro, my uncle, my mother, all my family. My mama shot three people and went to jail. She knew Fernandinho Beira-Mar [aka Seaside Freddy, the Red Command leader who organized a guns-for-drugs deal with Colombia\u2019s FARC rebels]. But until I was 22, I never touched anything. Then my friends down in Tijuca [a mainly white, tree-lined, middle class neighborhood in Rio] said, \u201cCan you get us something? We\u2019ll pay you money for it.\u201d\n\nA lot of people are scared if they come to the favela they\u2019ll get robbed, and sometimes they do. There\u2019s another reason. If you want to go in the favela, fine, that\u2019s your problem, but if you\u2019re coming out... a middle-class white boy like you coming out of the favela when he\u2019s not from here? For the police there\u2019s only one answer: you\u2019re here to buy drugs! Why do you think you pay me to take these flights?\n\nWe have a lot of social problems in the favela, so poor black people like me, we\u2019re almost invited to do this job. But I\u2019ve never thought of what I\u2019m doing as a crime.\n\n\"Bolsonaro and his pal, the new governor of Rio, declared war on drugs and now the police are going round shooting people from helicopters.\"\n\nWhat\u2019s it like in the favela?\n\nI love living here. It\u2019s wonderful: Everybody knows everybody, respects everybody, even the bandits. You just have to know not to make shit\u2014if you break the rules, you get punished. You can\u2019t steal or shoot here without permission, or you face the consequences. Sometimes a shot through the hand or the foot.\n\nMy friend Antonio works for the same gang at a different smoke shop, and we compete with each other. It\u2019s a franchise, like McDonald\u2019s. You\u2019ve got 3-4 McDonald\u2019s in the same hood but they\u2019re owned by different guys.\n\nWhat do you do when you\u2019re not \"flying\"?\n\nIn the day I shine shoes for the rich gringos on Copacabana. At night, that\u2019s when I start making my flights.\n\nWhat do you think about rich people, sitting in their houses, while you\u2019re risking your life and your freedom helping them get high?\n\nI get all kinds of customers. Some of them really I find very, very revolting. They talk down to me, and talk like money is the most important thing in the world. I feel like kind of an anarchist, I wanna burn it all down! But others are my friends. One\u2019s a middle-aged drama teacher. Another one\u2019s a 70-year-old guy who\u2019s never touched a beer in his life but we always smoke weed together.\n\nHave you ever had any trouble with the cops?\n\nAh, the cops! Once they stopped us and I had to show them I was gay and the customer was my boyfriend. They\u2019ve taken me down to the station several times but never do anything. This is Rio, you\u2019ve only got to ask them how much they want! How much you pay depends how much you have but if you\u2019ve only got one baggie they\u2019ll let you go for 300-500 reals [$70-$120]. Then after a few of those bookings most of the police are already friendly and even ask me to buy for them!\n\nThere\u2019s a new president, Bolsonaro, and his pal, the new governor [of Rio], Wilson Witzel, who declared war on drugs and now [the police] are going round shooting people from helicopters. But if you want to catch the real criminals you have to go to Ipanema or Leblon [the rich beachside neighborhoods].\n\nHow about other gangs?\n\nThere\u2019s some areas I won\u2019t go, for example Morro dos Macacos, because it\u2019s controlled by another group. There\u2019s two main cartels in Rio: Third Command and Red Command, and the milicia is just another faction. You won\u2019t go to those areas unless you want serious fucking health problems.\n\nADA is another group but they\u2019re going down. They\u2019re only got three communities left across the whole of Rio. But I heard they\u2019re paying the milicia to cause problems for us.\n\nSounds tough. How long do you see yourself doing this? Do you wanna retire or get another job?\n\nMy wife\u2019s six months pregnant now, soon she\u2019s gonna have our baby son. All I want is a stable job, then I can look after my wife and son.\n\nOnce when I was at the station I saw a cop who knew me. The first time he was getting all in my face but this time he asked me, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you do something else in your life? What can you do?\u201d I told him I can draw. I like to draw people, landscapes. \u201cOK, show me,\u201d he said, and he got me a pencil, paper, and told me to draw the figure. He took a look at it and said, \u201cIt\u2019s OK, you have time. You can practice.\u201d\n\n* Interview was conducted in person at a favela in Rio\u2019s North Zone and names have been changed.", "description": "\u201cI love living here.
