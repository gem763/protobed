And those are the kinds of things I think that have been most, most harmful long term to the foundation of America\u2019s virtuous character.\u201d\n\nOn Trump\u2019s personal life: \u201cHe has elements, I\u2019m sure, of honor in his life. And there\u2019s things that I think are not honorable. And I mention that because of the payment to a porn star for sexual relations outside of marriage. Look, I\u2019m one of those who believes that we have a responsibility to be honorable and faithful to our wives.\u201d\n\nOn calling on China to probe Joe Biden: \u201cWe certainly can\u2019t have presidents asking foreign countries to provide something of political value. That is, after all, against the law.\u201d\n\nOn abandoning the Kurds: \u201cA very dark spot in America\u2019s history.
