On this shoot, none of that applies. We are on a trading estate in Gateshead, in a unit that looks as tired as any depot you have ever seen, right down to the backroom office\u2019s carpet tiles that are now the colour of boot soles. The fulcrum of this production is not a swaggering auteur, but a slight, bespectacled 83-year-old man who, instead of barking orders, speaks in a tone as polite and wholesome as Ovaltine.\n\n\u201cRighto, folks!\u201d he says, swaddled in a coat against the autumn cold that keeps pushing in.\n\nThis is Ken Loach, socialist firebrand and provider of such recent headline hits as Tom Watson \u201cis the biggest threat\u201d to the future of the Labour party and Ed Miliband is a \u201cfake left\u201d politician \u2013 and those were from just one week in September. Yet the atmosphere on set is more like a school camping trip than a political seminar.\n\n\u201cKaren,\u201d Loach tells one actor, \u201cwe\u2019ll see more of you later.\u201d When he spots the innuendo, he breaks into a giggle, joined by the cast and crew. More directing notes follow, before he breaks off again: \u201cRicky, Charlie \u2013 don\u2019t take the piss.\u201d More laughter. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the liberal press here today.\u201d\n\nFifty years have passed since his breakthrough Kes, and Loach is still at it, winding up class enemies and sneaking reality into the multiplex. His latest is Sorry We Missed You, which will no doubt be described as a companion piece to I, Daniel Blake \u2013 the 2016 film about our inhumane welfare system that provoked condemnation from Tory ministers even as it shaped public debate about poverty in the fifth-biggest economy in the world.\n\nBoth films are set in and around Newcastle upon Tyne, both show the human wreckage left by a broken economy and a punitive state, and at the heart of both are characters who could be your dad, your uncle, your mate \u2013 men who start off with high hopes and faith in the system, yet who in 90 minutes on screen are swallowed whole by an abyss.\n\nIn Sorry We Missed You, that man is Ricky Turner. A blow-in from Manchester, he used to be a builder, until the financial crash killed the local trade. His latest, perhaps last, roll of the dice is to become a delivery driver; one of those guys who park their vans on double yellows and lug boxes to your door and who make today\u2019s consumer economy work. His wife is Abby, whose dreams of a family home died along with the collapse in 2007 of their mortgage provider, Northern Rock. She is a carer, looking after sick and elderly people as best as she can within the few minutes allowed by her agency.\n\nThe couple work in the gig economy, a world of zero-hours contracts, barely any holiday or sick pay, and firms that paint workers as their own bosses, even as they punish them for being an inch out of line or a minute over time. The gulf between rhetoric and reality is mapped in the film\u2019s opening minutes, when Ricky signs up at the depot with promises of being \u201cmaster of your own destiny\u201d just before another driver throws him a plastic bottle saying: \u201cYou\u2019ll need this for a piss.\u201d The routes they must follow don\u2019t allow for toilet breaks.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Kris Hitchen in Sorry We Missed You. Photograph: Entertainment One\n\nI have been reporting on this area for the Guardian for years and I am here to see what cinema can do with a subject usually confined to print. I have met an injured cleaner bullied so badly by her supervisor she considered suicide, minicab drivers who were whistled at \u201clike sheepdogs\u201d by their manager, an outsourced security guard living at home with his mum at the age of 46. The gig economy employs 4.7 million Britons, according to the TUC, from consultants on fat daily rates and hipsters in east London to these people working their guts out for poverty pay. Victorian capitalism used to mangle workers\u2019 limbs in machines; a large part of 21st-century capitalism does something less visceral but as devastating: it pumps you full of dreams of self-realisation even as it destroys your deepest notions of who you are.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s labour you can turn on and off like a tap,\u201d says Loach. \u201cIt follows on from Daniel Blake because while researching that film we were struck in the foodbank that a number of the people were working, and when we were in the benefits office most [claimants] were working. The idea of the working poor loomed large in our conversation.\u201d\n\nMost key players on Team Loach, meanwhile, have been with him for decades. Paul Laverty has been writing the screenplays since before Tony Blair entered No 10. To research this film, he hung around in car parks talking to drivers, doing their rounds with them, seeing them spend long days with only high-energy, gut-rotting drinks to keep them going. The cast on the other hand are largely new or relatively unknown, such as lead actor Kris Hitchen, who has spent the past two decades as a self-employed plumber, careering around in a van just like Ricky Turner. Other actors who usually work as delivery drivers respond to directions on loading and scanning parcels with finicky details about how it would be done in real life.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The director (centre) on the set of Bread and Roses with Adrien Brody and Pilar Padilla. Photograph: Allstar/FilmFour\n\nThis is Loach\u2019s 27th feature film, and it is done his way. The script is shot in sequence and actors learn the story as they go along \u2013 all the better to surprise them. \u201cI just want the performance to come straight from their stomach,\u201d he says. At lunchtime, everyone piles into a minibus to go to a church hall. Loach remembers shooting Bread and Roses in Los Angeles, and an actor asking: \u201cWhere are the chairs?\u201d\n\nLoach said: \u201cWhat chairs? There are a few around. Find one.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe always have chairs with our name on.\u201d\n\nLoach: \u201cHow old are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cSixty.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell I\u2019m fucking 75. When you see me sit down, you sit down.\u201d\n\nLoach laughs then says: \u201cWe keep going because we\u2019re so inexpensive.\u201d\n\nLabour haven\u2019t taken Johnson apart politically. We\u2019ve pretended he\u2019s a joke Ken Loach\n\nBy the time I next meet Loach at his production company in Soho in early September, nearly a year has gone by and his film is already lined up for release. Outside the edit suite, the Conservative government has failed to get the UK out of the EU, Theresa May is out of No 10 and Boris Johnson is in. A number of Labour MPs have left to form a new political party, ChangeUK, which has taken flight only to crash disastrously, even while Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour has slumped around 10 points in the polls. As he walks into the attic of the office townhouse, the most pressing issue on Loach\u2019s mind is not promoting his new film.\n\nThe new prime minister is \u201cvery dangerous\u201d, he says. \u201cA convincing populist, a piratical buccaneer who just cuts through the crap.\u201d He is also slicing through Her Majesty\u2019s Opposition. \u201cWe haven\u2019t taken him apart politically. We\u2019ve pretended he\u2019s a joke and we\u2019re not making the sharper analysis of where Johnson stands.\u201d\n\nWhen there is another general election, what does he think are Labour\u2019s chances? \u201cThey can win \u2026\u201d he begins. Then, ever the realist, he checks himself. \u201cCorbyn needs a team, and that\u2019s where the MPs around him have failed. Look at the ones who say: \u2018We won\u2019t work with him.\u2019 The majority of them would be very happy to see a rightwing leader \u2026 And the leadership\u2019s compromised too much with the [Labour] right.\u201d\n\nThis is not the routine criticism of Corbyn: it comes from one of his most stalwart and high-profile supporters. But if asked, Loach \u201cwouldn\u2019t have a hesitation\u201d in making another election film for Labour, as he did in 2017.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Kate Williams and Carol White in Loach\u2019s 1967 film Poor Cow. Photograph: Cinetext Bildarchiv/Allstar/Fenchurch/Studiocanal\n\nOne of his suggested solutions is forcing Labour MPs to reapply for their jobs before each electoral battle. It is a strategy that has left Margaret Hodge, MP for Barking for the past quarter century, fighting for her political life. \u201cEvery candidate in an election, whether you\u2019re a sitting MP or a councillor, should be chosen afresh. Every candidate should be asked: \u2018What have you done over the past five years?\u2019\u201d\n\nHis other big demand is for all wearers of the red rosette to argue hard for socialism: \u201cEnhancing trade union rights, planning the economy, investing in the regions, kicking out the privatised elements of the NHS.\u201d\n\nNote what is not on his list. \u201cThe big issues transcend Brexit,\u201d says Loach, who voted remain, albeit \u201cwith a heavy heart\u201d because of the EU\u2019s \u201cfree-market orientation\u201d. \u201cIf change is to come, it must come from the working class. That\u2019s why telling their story is important. That\u2019s why knowing our history is important.\u201d\n\nIt was the BBC\u2019s drama department that taught him this ethos. As a director on the Wednesday Play in the 1960s, Loach focused on people who barely got a look-in on screen or stage and put them on primetime BBC One. \u201cThe whole point of that project was: explain the world.\u201d In an era of two-and-a-half channels (BBC Two didn\u2019t reach much of the country), with schedules that only began at teatime, each episode was an event. They made headlines and lit up debates. His drama about homelessness, Cathy Come Home, prompted the founding of housing charity Crisis.\n\nEverything is micro-managed. We couldn't have done Cathy Come Home without people saying: Why have you cast this person? Ken Loach\n\nThis was the decade of kitchen-sink realism, of A Kind of Loving and A Taste of Honey, although that school of film-makers had one crucial difference, says Loach. \u201cThey saw the working class in the north as a location.\u201d The working class was both set dressing and a rung on the career ladder, just as they are in today\u2019s media. \u201cJohn Schlesinger went to the States, Lindsay Anderson went back to the Royal Court \u2026\u201d whereas to him, producer Tony Garnett and writer Roger Smith on the Wednesday Play, \u201cthat subject matter was the core of what we did\u201d.\n\nToday, he says, \u201cEverything is micro-managed, by a whole hierarchy above the programme-makers. There\u2019s no way we could have done Cathy Come Home without people saying: \u2018Why have you cast this person?\u2019.\u201d The meddling is as political as it is editorial and Loach reaches for a phrase from Garnett: \u201cIt\u2019s the enemy of creativity.\u201d\n\nWhat he is describing is the death of a liberal pluralism that could tolerate radical politics and formal experiment. Producer Rebecca O\u2019Brien first approached Channel 4\u2019s films division to fund I, Daniel Blake, as they had with previous Loach projects. \u201cThey seemed to take ages to get back to me,\u201d she recalls, before the money person at Film4 rang. \u201cShe said: \u2018I\u2019m embarrassed about this \u2026 but the current regime think we\u2019re already covering the area because we\u2019re doing Benefits Street.\u2019\u201d Asked for a response, a spokesperson for Film4 says it has \u201cbacked 11 Ken Loach films and at the time it was in development I, Daniel Blake didn\u2019t feel quite right for us\u201d. In the end, the tab was picked up by BBC Films.\n\n\u201cPeople are aware of what the unspoken rules are,\u201d says Loach. Otherwise, \u201cthe airwaves would be full of outrage at poverty, homelessness, the grotesque inequality, the stupidity of privatisation, the collapse of the NHS. But they\u2019re not \u2013 because of that pressure.\u201d\n\nAs we speak, the Edinburgh TV festival\u2019s MacTaggart lecture is in the headlines, thanks to Channel 4 News boss Dorothy Byrne calling the prime minister a \u201cknown liar\u201d in her address. Yet, the Byrne storm notwithstanding, Loach thinks some previous speakers show how cosy things have become. \u201cThe MacTaggart lecture: that\u2019s Jimmy MacTaggart, who was the main producer of the Wednesday Play. Jimmy was an iconoclast, constantly trying to knock down authority. The people giving the lecture are the authority that MacTaggart would have cut off at their knees. Now they use it as a mouthpiece for the establishment.\u201d Previous MacTaggart lecturers include not one but three Murdochs, including Rupert, plus Google\u2019s Eric Schmidt and a boardroom full of BBC and ITV bosses. \u201cThat\u2019s the wickedness of what they\u2019ve done to his name. He\u2019d have been horrified. These people: Jimmy MacTaggart would have pissed on them.\u201d\n\nFor him, the output of the BBC is full of cosy complacency. \u201cThe BBC\u2019s investigative journalism is a joke.\u201d Then he moves on to the recent Panorama on antisemitism in the Labour party.\n\nCorbyn urges May to see I, Daniel Blake to gain insight to life on welfare Read more\n\n\u201cThat was probably the most disgusting programme I\u2019ve ever seen on the BBC. Disgusting because it raised the horror of racism against Jews in the most atrocious propagandistic way, with crude journalism \u2026 and it bought the propaganda from people who were intent on destroying Corbyn.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a comeback that feels just as tin-eared as Labour\u2019s initial response - given the testimony of staffers in the documentary who talk emotionally about how their mental health was seriously affected - even if some of his points, especially on the lack of statistical context, seem justified.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Bruce Jones and Ricky Tomlinson in Raining Stones (1993). Photograph: Allstar/Channel 4 Films\n\nThe hard task in capturing Loach, whether in interview or over his films, is marrying up what he says with how he says it. He is the most self-effacing firebrand.\n\nAs a boy in the 1940s, Kenneth Charles Loach would be taken by his mum and electrician dad to Blackpool for a week every year. He remembers seeing \u201cthe old man going on the beach with his lace-up shoes and suit \u2026 seeing the comics and people rocking with laughter\u201d and his work often thrums with a quiet delight in the silliness of life, from the three-legged dog who makes a cameo in all his films to the sheer exuberance of Ricky Tomlinson showing off his backside in Raining Stones and Riff-Raff. Tomlinson has just turned 80 and Loach hopes they will work together again, \u201cbut I don\u2019t know if the arse has now gone beyond repair\u201d.\n\nAs for Loach himself: \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can go around the course again. It does get increasingly hard. You always feel a degree of insecurity about getting through a film. Knowing you\u2019ll be away from home for a long time, that you\u2019ve got to put a physical and emotional commitment to it that\u2019s got to last 12 to 14 hours a day.\u201d\n\nAnd as we end, I find myself wondering why Britain has been so casual about one of its giants and if it will ever again encourage someone of his political commitment and artistic stature.", "description": "As his new film Sorry We Missed You takes aim at zero-hours contracts, the director reveals why he still has to fight to get his films made, and how he thinks Labour should tackle the \u2018piratical\u2019 Boris Johnson", "authors": ["Aditya Chakrabortty"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41ff06dc97fc22588f0e5ebec65a7fba762b2376/0_1087_3980_2387/master/3980.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6e1d0c0465a1da7455317285318cf13c", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
