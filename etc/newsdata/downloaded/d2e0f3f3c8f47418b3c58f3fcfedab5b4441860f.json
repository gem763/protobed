Everything", "language": "en", "text": "Since becoming prime minister in July, Boris Johnson has pursued two goals: exiting the European Union by Oct. 31 (\u201cdo or die\u201d) and an early general election. He failed fairly decisively on the former, stymied by the same political stalemate that bedeviled his predecessor, but on Tuesday he got the elections, which will be held Dec. 12. The question is whether this will resolve or deepen the impasse over Brexit.\n\nMr. Johnson\u2019s calculations are basic politics. The polls give him a strong edge; he has a Brexit deal ready to go; his brand of entertaining, irreverent populism is popular on the campaign trail; and his Labour opponent, Jeremy Corbyn, is unpopular. So: Mr. Johnson leads the Conservatives to a parliamentary majority, achieves Brexit and gets five years in power.\n\nBut the three-year struggle over Brexit has turned British politics inside out, and plenty could go wrong with Mr. Johnson\u2019s scheme over the next six weeks. Most immediately, the House of Lords could still block the election, but that is the least likely problem. The greater problem was illustrated by Mr. Johnson\u2019s predecessor, Theresa May, who called snap elections for June 2017 in the hope of translating strong polls into a stronger majority, only to lose the majority and find herself reduced to a nettlesome minority government.\n\nThat could easily happen again. Party loyalties have been sharply eroded by Brexit, and many voters are likely to be driven by how they stand on leaving the European Union rather than how they\u2019ve voted in the past. In Scotland, where feelings run strongly against leaving the Union, for example, the Tories may lose seats. Mr. Johnson\u2019s \u201cdo or die\u201d pledge to quit the bloc by Thursday could also turn against him, along with his much-quoted declaration that he would rather be \u201cdead in a ditch\u201d than seek the extension that he was compelled to seek. That might nudge hard-core Brexiteers away from the Conservatives and toward Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit Party. Then there\u2019s Mr. Johnson himself, whose dubious integrity will surely be exploited by his opponents.", "description": "Brexit delayed, again, new elections called, again.
