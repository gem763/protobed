The initial plan was that Diess would start work at VW\u2019s Wolfsburg headquarters on Oct. 1 2015. However, Diess and BMW agreed he could shorten his gardening leave and take up his new job on July 1 instead.\n\nBoy was that a mistake on his part.\n\nIn Sept. 2015, barely two months after Diess landed, VW admitted rigging some 11 million vehicles worldwide to cheat diesel emissions tests \u2014 an admission that would lead to 30 billion euros ($33 billion) of penalties, provisions and recall costs.\n\nOn Tuesday German prosecutors charged Diess, who has since become CEO of the entire VW group, with stock market manipulation. They allege he was told about the cheating shortly before the end of July, some four weeks after he started work, but that he didn\u2019t immediately inform the market as he\u2019s obliged to do.\n\nMartin Winterkorn, who stepped down as VW boss when the cheating was revealed, and Hans Dieter Poetsch, VW\u2019s then finance director who is now the company\u2019s chairman, have been charged with the same offense. VW\u2019s position all along has been that it didn\u2019t recognize how financially serious its problems would prove to be with U.S. regulators (who got the ball rolling on uncovering and investigating the scandal). It reiterated on Tuesday that it thinks the latest allegations are groundless. Lawyers for the three men said similar.\n\nIf the case goes to trial, which wouldn\u2019t be until next year at the earliest, things could get awkward for VW. The news is particularly unhelpful for Diess, who has spearheaded the car giant\u2019s effort to leave behind the diesel scandal and embrace electric vehicles. Diess has bet the farm on his electric strategy and VW needs him to finish the job.\n\nThe charges are a reminder too that VW was perhaps a little cavalier in confirming Poetsch\u2019s elevation to the chairmanship even though he had the market manipulation allegation hanging over him. In view of his role in overseeing VW\u2019s recovery from the scandal, a VW shareholder once branded Poetsch the \u201cpersonfication of a conflict of interest.\u201d He certainly wasn\u2019t the fresh start VW probably needed.\n\nGiven the abject panic that any inkling of a U.S. criminal or regulatory investigation typically sparks in corporate boardrooms, it seems bizarre that VW executives failed to recognize the severity of the trouble the company was in back in 2015 and didn\u2019t communicate promptly to investors.\n\nAnyone who bought VW stock in the months prior to September 2015 can feel aggrieved that they weren\u2019t in possession of the same information that executives had. More than 30 billion euros of market value went up in smoke when U.S. regulators went public with their accusations about VW\u2019s use of \u201cdefeat devices,\u201d which hid diesel emission levels during tests, though it\u2019s since recovered much of that ground. A finding against the executives would provide fodder to investors pursuing civil claims for compensation. The stocks\u2019s 2.5% drop on Tuesday suggests today\u2019s crop of VW investors are worried, but not excessively.\n\nIn hindsight, Diess would have been better off staying in his garden in Bavaria a little longer. Rarely can such eagerness to show up to work have turned out so badly.\n\nTo contact the author of this story: Chris Bryant at cbryant32@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: James Boxell at jboxell@bloomberg.net\n\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.\n\nChris Bryant is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering industrial companies.
