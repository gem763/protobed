REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji/File Photo\n\nSEOUL (Reuters) - Deflation pressure is the biggest domestic risk facing South Korea\u2019s economy and its central bank should cut interest rates aggressively, a senior economist at credit rating agency S&P told Reuters on Wednesday.\n\nShaun Roache, Asia Pacific chief economist at S&P Global Ratings, also said during an interview in Seoul that the rating agency would trim its forecasts on South Korea\u2019s economic growth for this year and 2020 as soon as next week.\n\nHe said S&P\u2019s revised forecasts for South Korea\u2019s economic growth would be around 1.9% for this year, versus 2.0% seen previously, and about 2.2% for next year, down sharply from 2.6% seen before.\n\n\u201cI think the main domestic risk to Korea is low inflation, and deflation,\u201d Roache said. \u201cI think it is a problem that the BOK (Bank of Korea) is not meeting its own inflation target and has not met it for years.\u201d\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s annual consumer price inflation rate fell to zero in August, the slowest on record and bringing the average for this year\u2019s first eight months at 0.5%, far below the central bank\u2019s 2.0% target.\n\nRoache said the Bank of Korea should focus on boosting inflation, instead of placing a priority on containing housing prices. He said S&P now expects the central bank, which cut interest rates in July, to make two more rate cuts by early next year.\n\nHe dismissed an argument that the central bank should save ammunition for the next crisis, saying: \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make any sense. The best way to save the ammunition is to get inflation up. And the best way to get inflation up is to cut today.\u201d", "description": "Deflation pressure is the biggest domestic risk facing South Korea's economy and its central bank should cut interest rates aggressively, a senior economist at credit rating agency S&P told Reuters on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Choonsik Yoo", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190925&t=2&i=1433651722&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8O0CD", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
