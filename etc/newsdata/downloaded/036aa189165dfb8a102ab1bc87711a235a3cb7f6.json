Ted Cruz supported the push for stronger background check legislation after the recent string of deadly shootings over the summer, but warned that Democrats\u2019 plans would lead to an erosion of the Second Amendment.\n\n\u201cWe absolutely need to do more. We need to strengthen background checks,\u201d he said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve seen too damn many of these [shootings] in the state of Texas.\u201d\n\nShootings in Odessa, Midland and El Paso, Texas, left 29 people dead over the August recess.\n\nDemocrats passed a partisan background checks bill earlier this year that would extend to private sales. It hasn\u2019t made any headway in the Republican-controlled Senate despite the recent push by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.\n\nMr. Cruz slammed that particular option, warning that requiring background checks on private sales would pave the way for gun confiscation.\n\n\u201cThe only way to enforce that is a federal gun registry and a gun registry is the step you need for gun confiscation,\u201d he said. \u201cThe federal government should not be confiscating guns from law-abiding citizens.\u201d\n\nFormer Texas congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke went viral during this week\u2019s debate for enthusiastically calling for a mandatory buyback plan for AK-style guns.\n\n\u201cHell yes, we are going to take your AR-15, your AK-47, we are not going to allow it to be used against our fellow Americans anymore!\u201d he said.\n\nHe, along with Democratic presidential hopefuls Sens. Cory Booker and Kamala Harris, have voiced support for mandatory buybacks.\n\nMr. Cruz floated his 2013 bill with Sen. Chuck Grassley, which was reintroduced in May, as an alternative approach. The bill focuses on shoring up the National Instant Criminal Background Check System with stronger requirements for agencies.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said he\u2019s waiting for President Trump to decide what options he\u2019d support before taking anything up in his chamber.\n\nAccording to several Republican lawmakers meeting with the president on the issue, Mr. Trump is supportive of background checks but hasn\u2019t made a firm decision yet.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy told reporters at the GOP retreat in Baltimore this week that he expects that decision will be announced soon.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
