No doubt many preferred watching a bad NFL football game or reruns of Seinfeld to whatever it was that happened on that stage in Texas. We heard the laundry list of liberal lunacy and false promises. Banning semi-automatics, climate change, social justice, etc. Nothing new, but that doesn\u2019t make it any less comforting.\n\nHarris was especially cringeworthy though. She almost appeared inebriated at times. Take this clip for example.\n\nThe most depressing part about tonight's #DemocraticDebate is when @KamalaHarris replied to @JoeBiden's claim that her proposed exec order would be unconstitutional by *laughing* and blithely saying \"instead of saying no we can't, how about yes we can\" and listing Very Bad Things pic.twitter.com/32RboFItXL \u2014 Ari Cohn (@AriCohn) September 13, 2019\n\nIf you can\u2019t watch it, she\u2019s giggling like a school girl while badly delivering a \u201cyes, we can\u201d joke in response to Biden pointing out she\u2019s not a dictator who can do whatever she wants with executive orders.\n\nBut much more concerning (for Harris) than her horrible comedic skills is her positioning in the race, which continues to spook her donors. Things are starting to come to a head now.\n\nNEW: Kamala Harris' debate performance failed to sway big money donors. The leaders of a massive California donor network are struggling to pickup support for her candidacy. \u201cIt\u2019s been grim,\u201d said a person close to this network. My latest: https://t.co/wSDlCdfDgl \u2014 Brian Schwartz (@schwartzbCNBC) September 13, 2019\n\nGrim is never a word you want to hear about your campaign. CNBC has the report.\n\nSen. Kamala Harris\u2019 debate performance on Thursday failed to impress many of her party\u2019s big-money donors who were on the fence about her candidacy. Going into the Democratic primary debate in Houston, Harris\u2019 closest supporters privately acknowledged that if the senator from California did not come out swinging against her opponents and clearly define her policies, wealthy donors could shy away from her campaign. Many of them were hoping for a repeat of the aggressive tactics she used in the first debate, when she took on former Vice President Joe Biden for his willingness to work with segregationists as a senator in the 1970s. Now these sources say that those uncommitted contributors are still not convinced they can dedicate their expansive networks to her cause alone.\n\nWhen the money stops flowing, things can end very quickly.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anything has changed, and it\u2019s been grim,\u201d this person said. Donors believe that on the debate stage Harris is still \u201cunclear about her message and strategy,\u201d this person said. They liked the \u201cTrump focus,\u201d this person said, \u201cbut there was too much odd laughter and canned lines.\u201d This person added that most of their donors want to help former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., or South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg.\n\nThis is all predictable. I\u2019ll pat myself on the back again by reminding everyone that I said Harris was a sucker\u2019s bet the day after her supposedly \u201cgame-changing\u201d first debate performance. She simply doesn\u2019t have the charisma and she comes across as a fraud. Those are never qualities to lack if you want to connect with voters and create excitement.\n\nThe Democratic primary is essentially a three horse race right now and Bernie Sanders is mostly a mirage. He simply doesn\u2019t have the ability to build a majority. What\u2019s most likely to happen is that Sanders and Warren continue to split the crazy vote while Biden coasts down the middle. Harris is fast approaching not even being a factor. After her failure last night, she has no path to climb back in the race and with her donors bailing, cancellation is near.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nEnjoying the read?
