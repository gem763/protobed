This update features the usual bug fixes and security improvements. But Apple is also adding a handful of new features to its operating system.\n\nFirst, iOS 13.2 brings a ton of new emojis. The company now officially supports Unicode 12.0. You can now create all possible combinations of handholding-couple emojis regardless of gender or skin tone. There are new accessibility-focused emojis, such as a service dog, people using wheelchairs, prosthetic arms and legs, a person with a white cane and more. There also are new animals, a yawning face and new food options.\n\nIf you have an iPhone 11 or iPhone 11 Pro, iOS 13.2 enables Deep Fusion, an image-processing feature that should make your photos look better thanks to machine learning-enabled processing.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth mentioning that you can now change the resolution and frame rate of your videos in the Camera app directly.\n\nWith iOS 13.2, you can opt out of sharing Siri recordings with Apple employees and delete your Siri and dictation history. Go to Settings > Privacy > Analytics and Improvements to opt out at any time.\n\nFinally, iOS 13.2 enables HomeKit\u200c Secure Video for HomeKit-enabled cameras and adds support for the newly announced AirPods Pro.\n\nBefore updating to iOS 13.2, back up your device. Make sure your iCloud backup is up to date by opening the Settings app on your iPhone or iPad and tapping on your account information at the top and then on your device name. Additionally, you can plug your iOS device into your computer to do a manual backup in iTunes.\n\nDon\u2019t forget to encrypt your backup in iTunes. It is much safer if somebody hacks your computer. And encrypted backups include saved passwords and health data. This way, you don\u2019t have to reconnect to all your online accounts.\n\nOnce this is done, you should go to Settings as soon as possible to get in the queue. Navigate to \u2018Settings,\u2019 then \u2018General\u2019 and then \u2018Software Update.\u2019 Then you should see \u2018Update Requested\u2026\u2019 It will then automatically start downloading once the download is available.", "description": "Apple has released iOS 13.2 and iPadOS 13.2 for the iPhone and iPad.
