Left tackle Eric Fisher (groin) and left guard Andrew Wylie (ankle) also are sidelined.\n\nOn defense, Kansas City was without defensive tackle Chris Jones (groin) and defensive back Kendall Fuller, who broke his thumb in a 31-24 loss to Houston last weekend.\n\nOther inactives for the Chiefs included running back Darwin Thompson and tackle Greg Senat.\n\nWide receiver Emmanuel Sanders was active for Denver. He has been bothered by a sore knee and left a 16-0 victory over Tennessee last Sunday.\n\nRight tackle Ja\u2019Wuan James missed his sixth straight game after hurting his left knee in the opener. Receiver Juwann Winfree also was inactive along with cornerback Bryce Callahan, linebacker Corey Nelson, tight end Troy Fumagalli, tackle Calvin Anderson and defensive end Adam Gotsis.\n\nThe Broncos haven\u2019t beaten the Chiefs since 2015 when Peyton Manning was under center.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Patrick Mahomes was without two of his linemen and one of his receiving threats for the banged-up Kansas City Chiefs' game against the Denver Broncos on Thursday night.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/11/nfl_this_week_football_31666_c0-84-2016-1260_s1200x700.jpg?b4b9f7bd97ce92932d55a71ae40ffb1a4e531441", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
