Earlier this month the Department of Justice launched an antitrust investigation into a deal struck in July between California and four major automakers, Ford, Volkswagen, Honda and BMW.\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, which the administration says may be illegal, the companies said they'd produce passenger vehicles averaging 51 miles per gallon by model year 2026, a timeline that accords with regulations set by the Obama administration.\n\nUnder Trump, the EPA has has sought to roll back many of the environmental rules put in place by Obama \u2014 not just when it comes to fuel economy standards, but also methane emissions, air pollution and coal plants, among others.\n\n\"We are not supposed to go above and beyond and create our own laws,\" Wheeler explained to NPR. \"And under my administration here at EPA under President Trump, we are not going to create our own laws. We are going to follow the laws that Congress passed.\"\n\nThese efforts at deregulation have put the Trump administration squarely at odds with the California state government \u2014 and California politicians say they have no intention of backing down, including when it comes to this most recent fight.\n\n\"The Oval Office is really not a place for on-the-job training. President Trump should have at least read the instruction manual he inherited when he assumed the Presidency, in particular the chapter on respecting the Rule of Law,\" Becerra said Friday. \"Mr. President, we'll see you in court.\"", "description": "The lawsuit comes two days after the Trump administration revoked California's ability to set its own rules for automobiles.
