The 20-strong advisory group, which is made up of mostly Indigenous experts, will develop then refine models for reform over the next twelve months. The process is expected to cost $7.3 million. Indigenous Affairs Minister Ken Wyatt told Sky News all options are on the table for achieving an Indigenous voice. \u201cOne size does not fit all and that\u2019s why this work is important and I want it to be the foundation stone for the way in which all governments in the future will respond to Indigenous communities about their needs,\" Mr Wyatt said.
