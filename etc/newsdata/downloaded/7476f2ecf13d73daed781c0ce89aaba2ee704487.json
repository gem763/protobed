They will be talking to their counterparts. When Trump comes here, I\u2019ll be talking,\u201d sniffed Erdogan when asked by reporters about Pence\u2019s and Pompeo\u2019s impending visit. \u201cGreat news if you still wanted endless wars but with more geopolitical humiliation,\u201d mused Dan Foster about the news.\n\nTurkey's president @RTErdogan tells @AlexCrawfordSky he will not speak with the US Vice President about a ceasefire in Syria during his visit \u2013 adding that he will only talk to President @realDonaldTrump.

Besides, there are other ways to embarrass the U.S. that don\u2019t involve personally humiliating the vice president and the secretary of state. One is to have Erdogan loudly proclaim that he might snub Trump himself by declining to visit the White House as scheduled next month. Another is to ignore U.S. demands for a ceasefire in northern Syria and to reject America\u2019s invitation to act as a mediator between Turkey and the Kurds. The politic thing to do is to receive Pence and Pompeo warmly, listen attentively, then forget everything they\u2019ve said the moment they\u2019ve left. It sounds like that\u2019s what Erdogan will do.\n\nAs tends to happen in the Trump administration, the president\u2019s foreign policy and the foreign policy of literally everyone who works for him are two different things. Everyone from Pence on down sympathizes with the Kurds\u2019 plight and is pushing hard for a ceasefire before outright ethnic cleansing begins in earnest. Trump? Trump is Trump:\n\nPresident Trump: \u201cIf Turkey goes into Syria, it\u2019s not our problem.\u201d VP Pence and Pompeo being sent to deliver a very different message to President Erdogan regarding need for a ceasefire. \u2014 Jennifer Griffin (@JenGriffinFNC) October 16, 2019\n\nPresident Trump: \"The Kurds are much safer right now.

Pompeo\u2019s ability to end the conflict. \u2014 Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) October 16, 2019\n\nYeah, why the hell would you send Pence and Pompeo to try to negotiate a ceasefire while you\u2019re on TV broadcasting to the world that you don\u2019t care what happens to the Kurds or anyone else? What sort of pressure is Erdogan supposed to feel from that? For that matter, why send Pence and Pompeo at all? The time to send them on an emergency visit to Turkey was when Erdogan first told Trump that he was planning to invade northern Syria, not 10 days later when Turkish troops are advancing:\n\nROMNEY on Pence/Pompeo going to Turkey: \u201cIt's too late for this kind of conversation. I mean I'm happy that they're talking but my goodness.\u201d \u2014 Frank Thorp V (@frankthorp) October 16, 2019\n\nHow did we end up here? According to White House aides who spoke to the Times, Trump was underprepared for his call with Erdogan on October 6. When the Turkish leader threatened to invade northern Syria at long last to push the Kurds back, Trump didn\u2019t think to threaten him back with U.S. countermeasures like sanctions. Or at least, that\u2019s the charitable spin; the less charitable read would be that Trump really, truly has no problem with the Turks pulverizing America\u2019s allies in the war against ISIS, a point he\u2019s now made repeatedly in public, and only agreed to sanctions after the fact because of the harsh backlash he\u2019s received even from Republicans. Threatening Erdogan with sanctions on the call might not even have mattered: The Sultan knows Trump is a paper tiger.\n\nThe Turkish president probably anticipated U.S. sanctions, Soner Cagaptay, a Turkey scholar at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy and the author of the new book Erdogan\u2019s Empire, told me. But Erdo\u011fan and Trump have a good rapport, even an apparent \u201cpolitical man crush on each other\u201d as like-minded \u201cstrongmen presidents,\u201d he noted. And Erdo\u011fan expects Trump to ultimately \u201csave the relationship,\u201d such as when the U.S. president held back last summer on imposing congressionally mandated sanctions on Turkey over the NATO member\u2019s purchase of a Russian missile-defense system. \u201cErdo\u011fan is betting on that once again: that Trump will prevent devastating sanctions against Turkey\u2019s economy and military following the incursion,\u201d said Cagaptay\u2026 Thus far, \u2026 [new U.S.] sanctions extend to only three Turkish officials and the nation\u2019s defense and energy ministries.\n\nThat probably explains Erdogan\u2019s reversal on meeting Pence and Pompeo. He knows Trump doesn\u2019t care what happens to the Kurds or whether Assad and Russia increase their hold on Syria as a result. He may not even care what happens to ISIS so long as the group doesn\u2019t reconstitute itself before November 2020. But being personally rude to Trump\u2019s handpicked envoys by refusing to hear them out might be an unpardonable affront. Better to maintain the \u201cfriendship\u201d with Trump by being polite and then doing what you like, knowing that he\u2019ll find excuses \u2014 \u201cthe Kurds are no angels\u201d \u2014 to justify your actions for you.\n\nSpeaking of endless wars and political humiliation, here\u2019s a pair of viral clips from Russian state TV that are making the rounds today. If the president were a Democrat, this sort of immediate bug-out under threat paired with the degree of callousness Trump\u2019s showed the Kurds today would make this episode legendary in Republican media for a generation as proof of the essential cowardice and fickleness of left-wing foreign policy.\n\nLeft in a hurry: RT films inside abandoned US military base at Manbij, Syriahttps://t.co/iXcyOzv87Z pic.twitter.com/gHCN9ARXsT \u2014 RT (@RT_com) October 16, 2019", "description": "\"When Trump comes here, I'll be talking.\"", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/re-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
