The Trump administration had initially argued it was not covered by a whistleblower statute that would require its automatic disclosure to Congress.\n\nThe administration dropped its opposition to its release after a political firestorm erupted over news reports of some of the details in the complaint.\n\nPelosi cited the complaint as reporting \u201crepeated abuse of an electronic records system designed to store classified, sensitive, national security information, which the White House used to hide information of a political nature.\u201d\n\nShe said: \u201cThis is a cover-up. This is a cover-up.\u201d\n\nActing Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire, who had withheld the complaint after consulting with the Justice Department, told the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee on Thursday he believed the whistleblower was acting in good faith.\n\nDuring the July telephone call, Trump pressed Zelenskiy to investigate Biden in coordination with U.S. Attorney General William Barr and Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, according to a summary of the conversation released by the administration on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cIt is not the role of the president to shake down foreign leaders,\u201d Pelosi said.\n\nTrump has denied doing anything wrong and provided no evidence of any wrongdoing by Biden, the Democratic front-runner in the race for the 2020 presidential election.", "description": "U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Thursday accused President Donald Trump of trying to cover up an attempt he made to pressure Ukraine into investigating Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.", "authors": ["Susan Cornwell", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
