The decline was the largest since the company went public almost six years ago.\n\nGRUBHUB AND THIRD-PARTY DELIVERY APPS ARE DEVOURING SMALL BUSINESSES\n\nGrubhub cut its fourth-quarter revenue projections to $315 million to $335 million. It also trimmed its earnings forecast to $15 million to $25 million.\n\nAfter the bell on Monday, the food delivery company reported third-quarter revenue of $322 million, a 30 percent increase from the previous year, but short of the $330 milllion Wall Street analysts were expecting.
