Suddenly, Australia\u2019s previously hailed big LNG exporters were being blamed, along with state government gas development bans, for undermining the national energy market.\n\nWithin six months, previous complaints about expensive \u201cgold plating\u201d of electricity grids were overtaken by South Australia\u2019 statewide power blackout. That sounded the alarm that the world-leading penetration of unreliable wind and solar power threatened the security of energy supply and the stability of the eastern states electricity grid. Months later, French energy company Engie announced the imminent shutdown of the Hazelwood coal-fired power station in Victoria\u2019s La Trobe Valley, leading to a spike in prices.\n\nSix months after Hazelwood\u2019s exit, Energy Minister Josh Frydenberg used our 2017 National Energy Summit to sideline chief scientist Alan Finkel\u2019s proposed Clean Energy Target. This was replaced by the National Energy Guarantee, a product of the energy technocrats, which sought to deliver both lower carbon emissions and enough reliable energy supply. That aimed to provide a policy consensus that would give energy companies the confidence to invest in transforming Australia\u2019s energy system \u2013 which in turn would lower prices. But within another year, the NEG was dead too, and had taken Mr Turnbull\u2019s prime ministership with it. It was the fifth iteration of energy policy since 2007. The one constant has been the ending of Australia\u2019s previous competitive advantage in cheap power.\n\nSpeaking at last year\u2019s National Energy Summit immediately after the collapse of the NEG, Energy Security Board chair Kerry Schott warned that \u201canarchy\u201d had broken out in the National Electricity Market. Soon the debate caught up with why. The unprecedented force-feeding of solar and wind \u2013 particularly rooftop solar \u2013 into the power grid was collapsing the price of wholesale electricity during the day. That would be good, except that it is undermining the business and operational economics of baseload coal generation still needed to provide power at night or on still days. Negative wholesale prices during the day are being overwhelmed by soaring prices in the evening. Hydro and battery power sources are nowhere near making up the difference. In the meantime, the crisis of high power prices threatens to become a crisis of power supply itself.\n\nAll this is happening to a national energy market that was one of the standout achievements of the competition-based economic reform era of the 1990s. Now, this market is all but broken under the burden of a decade of failed climate change policies \u2013 from Julia Gillard\u2019s Labor-Greens over-reach that destroyed hopes for a least-cost economy-wide carbon price, to the uncoordinated state-based renewables and emissions targets now pursued by Victoria and Queensland. Successive policy failures have led to government policy interventions that, in turn, have progressively severed the link between price signals and the sort of private investment needed to reliably and efficiently keep the lights on.\n\nFederal Energy Minister Angus Taylor now argues that the energy market is so broken that the Coalition has no alternative but to intervene even more: such as through the \u201cbig stick\u201d threat to break up integrated power companies, pressuring energy companies to review plans such as AGL\u2019s foreshadowed closure of the Liddell coal-fired power station in NSW, the reintroduction of price controls and taxpayer underwriting of \u201cdispatchable\u201d or \u201cfirm\u201d coal, gas and hydro investment. Even if that is so, however, this can only be an emergency fix rather than an ongoing framework to encourage the $400 billion or so of investment in renewables, batteries and firmed power estimated to be required over the next 30 years.\n\nSooner rather than later, federal and state governments need to reverse course toward a stable and functioning energy supply market that relies on price signals to encourage the needed investment in new capacity. In the meantime, the previous symbol of Australia\u2019s great economic reform era will remain the most glaring and damaging example of the nation\u2019s wider political failure that\u2019s to blame for the stagnation of living standards.", "description": "A pile-up of fixes have muted the price signals needed for private sector investment in energy.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2627%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_189/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/fee1a865d3dd3713cc72d2f3ca89700f0cd6ad58", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
