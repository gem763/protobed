Despite reaching what Trump called a \u201cfantastic\u201d deal with China last week, recent reports suggest things could turn sour before anything is signed.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump holds a letter from China's President Xi Jinping during a meeting with China's Vice Premier Liu He in the Oval Office at the White House after two days of trade negotiations in Washington, U.S., October 11, 2019.

So this is not the time, I think, to let up pressure.\u201d\n\n\u2018Don't become part of Beijing's communist propaganda machine\u2019\n\nChina\u2019s trade issues with the U.S. come as the country struggles to deal with rising tensions over protests in Hong Kong, which is fighting for democracy. \u201cWhat China wants to do is steamroll them and dominate their neighbors,\u201d said Hawley.\n\nHawley, who recently traveled to the region, stressed what\u2019s happening there is of global concern, \u201cWhat Beijing wants to do in Hong Kong is directly tied to American security. It's one of the reasons we need to stand up.\u201d\n\nBasketball - NBA China Games - Los Angeles Lakers v Brooklyn Nets - Shenzhen, China - October 12, 2019.

Does he know the facts?,\u201d he said. \u201cDo any of these NBA players who are out against Hong Kong, do they know the facts of what's going on? It's really striking. Here's my message to the NBA. Don't become part of Beijing's communist propaganda machine. Show some independence.\u201d\n\nKenneth Underwood is a senior producer for Yahoo Finance.
