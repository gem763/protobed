He also spoke briefly with Merkel and Macron, with all three laughing and smiling\n\nJohnson must now secure approval for the agreement in an extraordinary session of parliament on Saturday, which would pave the way for an orderly departure on Oct. 31. But getting the votes is uncertain.\n\nThe Northern Irish party that Johnson needs to help ratify any agreement, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), has refused to support it, saying it is not in Northern Ireland\u2019s interests.\n\nThe head of the main opposition Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, said he was \u201cunhappy\u201d with the agreement and would vote against it. Labour has said it wants any deal to be subject to a public vote, but as yet has not indicated whether it will back any move for a second referendum on Saturday.\n\nJohnson appears intent on presenting parliament with a stark choice \u2014 the deal he has struck or no deal \u2014 in the hope of securing enough votes to get approval, sources said.\n\nHe has said he will not ask for a delay - even though parliament has passed a law to oblige him to do so if it has not finalised a deal by Saturday.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A passenger bus passes a pro-Brexit demonstration in Westminster, London, Britain, September 30, 2019.

The DUP have 10 votes.\n\nPeople hold placards as they attend a candlelit vigil on the border between Ireland's Donegal county and Londonderry county in Northern Ireland in Lifford, Ireland, October 16, 2019.
