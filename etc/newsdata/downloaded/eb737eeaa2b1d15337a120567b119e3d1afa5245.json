So, to them, this is a more-in-sorrow-than-in-anger thing \u2014 the special is a mid-life crisis or temper tantrum. Dave let us down.\n\nOther critics go right for the throat, though. \u201cAll the Worst White People Love Dave Chappelle\u2019s Sticks and Stones,\u201d laments a writer at The Root. \u201cThe aftermath of this special is a growing allegiance from one of the most hate-filled sections of the internet and the country today,\u201d adds another at Complex. If you\u2019re one of those misguided few who think Americans can still find common ground in the greatness of a performer like Chappelle, alas, no.\n\nBut maybe we can find common ground in this bit, at least? The second half cracked me up. Lots of profanity here, needless to say, so adjust your sound options accordingly.", "description": "Credibility.", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend", "Taylor Millard", "Andrew Malcolm", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/dc.jpg"}
