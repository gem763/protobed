That obviously made big headlines in the stock market today, but it\u2019s not propelling energy stocks higher in the manner that many had expected.\n\nStock Market Today More\n\nBy now, many of you have likely read about the background story. For those that haven\u2019t, this is the short-but-sweet scoop. A drone strike rattled Saudi Arabia over the weekend, forcing the country to cut its oil production in half.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe move is equivalent to about 5 million barrels per day, or roughly 5% of the world\u2019s daily production.\n\nHere\u2019s where things get tricky though. Reports say that the production cut is mostly a precautionary measure and that most of that output should be back online within 48 hours.\n\nAt first, many believed the attack was carried about Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels. Now it is alleged that Iran is behind the attack, which would significantly ratchet up tensions in the Middle East and potentially implicate a response from other nations outside of it (including the United States).\n\nOil\u2019s Big Implications\n\nNow you know the backstory on why oil prices are surging. But the implications are incredibly far reaching.\n\nFirst, where can oil prices go? Let\u2019s keep one thing in mind: Oil prices are back to where they were in June. We\u2019re still notably away from the April highs and down significantly year-over-year. So while some may suggest that there\u2019s enough supply in the market to keep a lid on oil prices, the charts suggest there could easily be more upside.\n\nImpacting supply is a few different factors. The first, can Saudi Arabia actually get a majority of production back online in as little as two days, or is it a save-face move ahead of the eventual Saudi Aramco IPO? Second, will the U.S. and other oil-rich nations make up the difference? While 5 million barrels per day is admittedly a lot of oil, between the rest of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and the U.S., it seems like most of this deficit could be covered.\n\nWill President Donald Trump help eradicate a shortage in supply? He seems eager to, tweeting about tapping into the country\u2019s strategic oil reserves and fast-tracking pipeline permits. Lastly, will conflicts be ongoing and will tensions remain high in the Middle East? If the answer is yes, then not only are future supply disruptions possible, but energy investors will price in a risk premium to the oil market.\n\nShould we see a big spike in oil prices that sustains for months on end, that may have negative implications going into the fourth quarter and holiday seasons. The last thing consumers need \u2014 both here in the U.S. and globally \u2014 is a substantial rise in gas prices that persists into 2020.\n\nFinally, a bulk of Saudi Arabia\u2019s production goes to Asia. What implications could that have on China\u2019s economy, which is already feeling pressure from the trade war?\n\nEnergy Stocks Make Big Moves\n\nSo far, the spike in oil has had a hit-and-miss impact on the energy sector. The Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLE) climbed \u201cjust\u201d 3.4% on the day. However, the VanEck Vectors Oil Services ETF (NYSEARCA:OIH) jumped 8.6% in the stock market today.\n\nExxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), which makes up 23% of the XLE, climbed a lackluster 1.5% on the day. Chevron (NYSE:CVX) makes up 22% of the ETF and jumped just over 2%. It\u2019s becoming clear why the XLE showed such little life on the day now.\n\nOthers were more pronounced, though. Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) jumped 5.3%, while Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) climbed almost 11% on the day. These are the top two holdings in the OIH, by the way.", "description": "Oil prices are exploding higher on the day, with crude oil up 13% from its close on Friday.
