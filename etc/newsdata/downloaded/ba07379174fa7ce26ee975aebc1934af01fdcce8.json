So it\u2019s on the offense to be a lot better situationally.\u201d\n\nIn a 12-10 loss at New Orleans, the Cowboys (3-1) were held to 257 yards, barely half of what they rolled up in each of their wins while scoring more than 30 points each time.\n\nTight end Jason Witten and running back Ezekiel Elliott had fumbles that helped contribute to the first halftime deficit of the season, and Prescott made a critical mistake taking a sack on the first play of the final drive, when they ran out of time needing only a field goal to win.\n\n\u201cWe know the potential of this team, we know how good we can be and we can\u2019t focus necessarily on what the record is,\u201d Prescott said. \u201cYou take the good, you take the bad, you live and learn from it and you get better because of it.\u201d\n\nThe Packers could be without top receiver Davante Adams, who had his career-high 180 yards receiving against the Eagles before injuring a toe in the second half.\n\nRUN AWAY, RUN AWAY\n\nThe Cowboys had 45 yards rushing against the Saints, their fewest since the second game of Elliott\u2019s second season in 2017. Dallas had 40 yards in that 42-17 loss to Denver, and Elliott finished with a career-low 8. But the Packers have the 26th-ranked run defense through four weeks.\n\n\u201cI just think you have to be careful about getting into numbers too much,\u201d Cowboys coach Jason Garrett said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to go do what we want to do and again, try to attack different ways, try to be who we are in all phases of our team.\u201d\n\nGreen Bay\u2019s Aaron Jones had his first career 100-yard game in a 35-31 win over the Cowboys as a rookie two years ago, but has averaged 20 yards in two games since going for 116 in Week 2 this year. Like their defense, the Packers have the 26th-ranked rushing offense.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to make sure the wide receivers are on the same page, the quarterback\u2019s on the same page, the tight ends are on the same page, the offensive line\u2019s on the same page and the running back is,\u201d left tackle David Bakhtiari said.\n\nDID DEZ CATCH IT?\n\nRandall Cobb, who spent his first eight seasons in Green Bay, is facing the Packers for the first time after signing with the Cowboys in the offseason. It took reporters six questions to get to the one he was waiting for: Did Dez catch it?\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been getting that a lot since I\u2019ve been here,\u201d Cobb said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know what the rules were back then. It\u2019s probably a catch nowadays.\u201d\n\nIt was a reference to Dallas receiver Dez Bryant\u2019s infamous catch that wasn\u2019t on fourth down in the fourth quarter of Green Bay\u2019s 26-21 divisional-round victory during the 2014 season. The deep ball was ruled a catch and overturned on review. Three years later, the rules changed.\n\nPROTECTING PRESCOTT\n\nThe Cowboys could be without six-time Pro Bowl left tackle Tyron Smith, who sprained an ankle against the Saints. Right tackle La\u2019el Collins missed the first two practices after a back issue cropped up this week.\n\nCameron Fleming would fill in for Smith. Dallas is considering moving second-year guard Connor Williams to Collins\u2019 spot and starting someone else at left guard. The Cowboys are set to face one of the NFL\u2019s two linebacking tandems with at least three sacks apiece in Preston Smith (4\u00bd sacks) and Za\u2019Darius Smith (three).\n\nHIGH DRAMA\n\nThe Packers are 3-0 against Dallas at AT&T; Stadium, with three dramatic victories, starting in 2013 when Rodgers was injured and Matt Flynn led Green Bay\u2019s 37-36 win after trailing 26-3 at halftime.\n\nTwo years after the Dez catch that wasn\u2019t, the Packers beat the Cowboys in the divisional-round again on Rodgers\u2019 improbable 35-yard completion to Jared Cook that set up Mason Crosby\u2019s field goal on the final play in Green Bay\u2019s 34-31 win.\n\nIn 2017, Rodgers\u2019 12-yard scoring pass to Adams with 11 seconds left gave Green Bay a 35-31 win as the teams combined for 30 points in the fourth quarter.\n\n\u201cSome places you feel really comfortable,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cThere\u2019s so much going on. It\u2019s a beautiful stadium with the jumbotron and the way it\u2019s set up, an interesting kind of walk through the club when you\u2019re heading on the field. A lot of stimuli, but we\u2019ve had some fun games there.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Dak Prescott and the Dallas Cowboys want to get their offense back to what it was doing before a sputtering loss that slowed their best start in more than a decade.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Schuyler Dixon"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/27/eagles_packers_football_29181_c0-164-3910-2443_s1770x1032.jpg?5aae93a4087b764f35bbc86f1dc8e238d84f7dc0", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
