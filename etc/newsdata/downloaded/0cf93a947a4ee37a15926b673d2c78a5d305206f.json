The commercial launch came in 2012, but uses have so far been mostly limited to ride-on lawnmowers and golf carts, along with construction machinery, where the chance of a puncture is high.\n\nToyota Group truckmaker Hino Motors used the motor show to display a vision of the future where electric, modular, people-to-parcel movers run on airless tires of its own design.\n\nToyota showed a hydrogen-powered concept car fitted with Sumitomo Rubber Industries prototypes at the previous event in 2017.\n\nMichelin and General Motors have announced a joint research agreement aiming to have airless tires on passenger cars by as early as 2024 (see the video above). Testing starts this year on the Bolt electric vehicle in Michigan.\n\nFor electrified vehicles (EV) in particular, the tires' design \u2014 a band of rubber encircling polymer spokes around an aluminum hub \u2014 allows for motors to be fitted directly inside the wheel, opening up space in the chassis to extend leg room or expand the trunk.\n\nEV manufacturers also hope that airless tires will in the future weigh less than their standard cousins, allowing crucial extra miles of driving range given consumer concerns about running out of power far from the nearest charging station.\n\nSo far though, making them more lightweight has proved difficult. Sumitomo Rubber says it has been able to reduce weight slightly by changing the shape of the polymer spokes, but the heft of the rubber tread still makes it a little heavier than current conventional tires.\n\nStructurally, too, there are challenges. Sumitomo Rubber has been able to increase the size of its prototypes somewhat since the last motor show, but it is still far from making them big enough and strong enough for a bus or truck.\n\n\"There will definitely be demand for airless tires for commercial vehicles in the future, but making something that can support that weight is a really huge obstacle,\" Hiroshi Ohigashi, of Sumitomo Rubber, said at the motor show.\n\nManufacturing costs are also a little higher than for pneumatic tires, but both Sumitomo Rubber and Bridgestone expect an eventual move to mass production would solve that.\n\nReporting by Kevin Buckland.\n\nRelated Video:", "description": "Makers of airless tires such as Japan's Bridgestone Corp. hope driverless cars will herald a breakthrough for their niche technology, which is more than a decade old but underperforms standard tires in every way except resistance to puncture.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims3/GLOB/crop/3000x1688+0+4/resize/800x450!/format/jpg/quality/85/https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims3/GLOB/crop/3000x1692+0+308/resize/375.99x211.997!/format/jpg/quality/85/https://s.aolcdn.com/os/ab/_cms/2019/10/25152314/PrototypeWheels04.jpg.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
