As Senator and former GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney Willard (Mitt) Mitt RomneyTrump defends Syria move: 'It's time to come back home' GOP senator: 'Not appropriate' to ask foreign governments to investigate Biden Senators call for Trump administration to testify on Syria MORE aptly noted, Republicans now find themselves on a Machiavellian (and Faustian) crusade to maintain power at all costs \u2014 facts, logic and duty to country be damned.\n\nIf historically-timid Democrats take their dedication to the rule of law and the Constitution seriously, they'll realize that much of Trump\u2019s political base is impervious to arguments \u2013 no matter how logical or factually sound \u2013 made outside of the truth-starved, conspiracy theory-peddling right wing media bubble. Welcome to Trumpian America.\n\nWith that reality in mind, Democrats should relentlessly promote the astutely spirited analysis of Fox News\u2019 chief judicial correspondent. Judge Napolitano has stated on multiple live television interviews that in pushing a foreign leader to perform a political \u201cfavor\u201d for him, Trump engaged in \u201ccriminal and impeachable behavior.\u201d In an era where powerful right wing echo chambers reign supreme, Napolitano\u2019s assessment is a messaging gold mine for constitutionally-minded (yet painfully PR-illiterate) Democrats.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIndeed, given Fox News\u2019 catnip-like effect on Trump\u2019s red-meat base, one must ask why Democrats are not squeezing every ounce of messaging value out of Napolitano\u2019s spot-on legal analysis. Democrats, apparently, continue to lack the go-for-the-jugular mentality that their right wing counterparts have successfully embraced for decades.\n\nJudge Napolitano\u2019s blistering take, especially in the context of the roiling internal conflict between Fox News\u2019 reporting and commentary divisions, should be a Democratic talking point, repeated ad nauseam, in every single media appearance. The same goes for Fox News characterizing a series of text messages exchanged by U.S. diplomats as \u201cdevastating\u201d to Trump. Equally noteworthy is a former Republican senator\u2019s stunning suggestion that \u201cat least 35\u201d of his former GOP colleagues would privately vote to impeach Trump.\n\nRelentless promotion of these explosive Fox News pieces knocks the GOP on its heels and forces Trump\u2019s base into the challenging position of defending its own propaganda machine.\n\nOf course, in an era of (per Fox News) \u201castonishing\u201d and \u201cdeeply misleading\u201d right wing spin, the occasional dissension from Trumpian orthodoxy, by itself, is not going to cut it.\n\nIndeed, in previous decades, the transcript of Trump\u2019s phone call with the president of Ukraine would have sufficed as the \u201csmoking gun\u201d leading directly to impeachment. Not anymore. As Fox News personality Geraldo Rivera rightly noted, a powerful right wing propaganda machine is shielding Trump from Nixon\u2019s fate.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWith that reality in mind, Democrats need more evidentiary \u201cmeat\u201d \u2013 in tandem with a blistering, Twitter-ready marketing strategy \u2013 to overcome the decades-long psychological operation that right wing media have mounted against the American public.\n\nDemocrats can start with the issue of U.S. security assistance to Ukraine. Why, after five years, did Trump suddenly and unilaterally halt critical American military aid to an ally at war? Trump\u2019s own national security team \u2013 let alone Congress, which authorized the funding \u2013 was left utterly baffled and blindsided by the decision. The same goes for the Ukrainians.\n\nWhile Fox News has reported that Trump engaged in an impeachable \u201cquid pro quo,\u201d his abrupt halt of U.S. assistance to Kyiv strikes at the heart of the crisis. Not only did the president of the United States illegally solicit foreign interference in an American election for personal gain, he did so by withholding crucial aid to an ally in the midst of a bloody conflict. As noted separately, Trump\u2019s excuse for suddenly and inexplicably halting assistance to Ukraine is utterly laughable.\n\nMoreover, Democrats must investigate how Trump used Rudy Giuliani Rudy GiulianiA dozen House Democrats call on EU ambassador to resign amid Ukraine scandal Former George W. Bush chief of staff endorses Trump impeachment inquiry Giuliani associates won't comply with House impeachment inquiry, attorney says MORE\u2019s highly improper backchannel with Ukraine to extort the Ukrainian president into opening a baseless, politically-motivated investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenA dozen House Democrats call on EU ambassador to resign amid Ukraine scandal Ex-Trump officials met with Zelensky campaign aides at Trump hotel earlier this year: report Overnight Health Care \u2014 Presented by Coalition Against Surprise Medical Billing \u2014 Buttigieg unveils aggressive plan to lower drug prices | Supreme Court abortion case poses major test for Trump picks | Trump takes heat from right over vaping crackdown MORE. In dispatching Giuliani to do his political dirty work, one must wonder if Trump figured that he could hide behind attorney-client privilege if the plot ever came to light, as it now has. In much the same vein, the firing of a widely-respected American diplomat in order to enrich Trump\u2019s cronies reeks of swampian corruption.\n\nIf nothing else, Trump is transactional. He has to personally get something out of every \u201cdeal.\u201d As such, Democrats should also investigate whether Trump pushed the Ukrainian government to drop criminal investigations into his campaign manager\u2019s enormously corrupt dealings in exchange for then-newly approved lethal military aid.\n\nThe constant drip of \u201cdevastating\u201d revelations, Fox News\u2019 (occasional) crushing analysis and diligent investigation by congressional Democrats have landed Trump in truly hot political water. It is high time for more patriots at Fox News (and in the overarching right wing media bubble) to set blind tribalism aside and speak out against a rogue president.\n\nMarik von Rennenkampff served as an analyst with the U.S. Department of State\u2019s Bureau of International Security and Nonproliferation, as well as an Obama administration appointee at the U.S. Department of Defense.
