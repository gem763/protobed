New details emerged about some of them Thursday after the indictment of two associates of Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s private lawyer.\n\nLev Parnas and Igor Fruman\n\nArrested as they sought to leave the country with one-way tickets, Giuliani\u2019s associates, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, have both been called to testify in the House impeachment inquiry.\n\nParnas was born in Ukraine, and Fruman in Belarus. Both are now U.S. citizens, based in southern Florida.\n\nThursday\u2019s indictment charges them with camouflaging political donations in order to advance the political interests of Ukrainian government officials as well as their own business interests.\n\nOver the past two years, they appear to have been pursuing two distinct goals. One was to help Giuliani oust the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine and gather negative information about the business dealings of Hunter Biden, the younger son of former Vice President Joe Biden, in that country.\n\nAllegations that Trump pressured Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the newly elected president of Ukraine, to investigate the Bidens in exchange for a White House meeting or military aid \u2014 or both \u2014 are at the center of the impeachment inquiry.\n\nThe pair\u2019s other goal was to use political contributions in order to change state and federal policies to further their recreational marijuana business venture. An unnamed foreigner with \u201cRussian roots\u201d gave them $1 million for that purpose, according to the indictment. It is illegal for foreigners to donate to U.S. political campaigns.\n\nBoth men appear to have met Trump. Parnas posted a photograph of himself with the president on Twitter in June, saying he was honored to call Trump his friend. Fruman told one news outlet that Trump invited him to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, in March 2018 for one of the president\u2019s first fundraising events for the 2020 election.\n\nLast year, Parnas and Fruman donated $325,000 to a pro-Trump super PAC, America First Action. They claimed the funds came from an energy company they had recently created. In fact, the firm had no income and no assets, according to the indictment. Prosecutors stated the funds came from a transaction between Fruman and third parties whom they did not name.\n\nMarie Yovanovitch\n\nIn an intriguing development, Thursday\u2019s indictment cites Parnas\u2019 efforts to help Giuliani and others oust Marie Yovanovitch as the U.S. ambassador in Ukraine. The State Department recalled her to the United States in May, months before the scheduled end of her tenure. How she lost her post is a key part of the impeachment inquiry.\n\nYovanovitch\u2019s critics alleged that she was disloyal to Trump. One informal adviser to the president made an unsubstantiated claim that she had told Ukrainian officials to ignore Trump\u2019s policies because he would be impeached. In his July call with Zelenskiy, Trump described the ambassador as \u201cbad news,\u201d warning, \u201cShe\u2019s going to go through some things.\u201d\n\nAllies of Yovanovitch said they feared she was removed because she was an obstacle to Trump\u2019s hopes that Ukraine would investigate the Bidens. Numerous foreign policy experts describe the three-time ambassador as highly competent and nonpartisan.\n\nShe is scheduled to testify Friday in the House impeachment inquiry, but it is unclear whether the administration, which claims the inquiry is not legitimate, will allow her to appear. So far, neither she nor her lawyers have commented publicly.\n\nFormer Rep. Pete Sessions\n\nPete Sessions, a former Republican congressman from Texas, is referred to in the indictment, but not by name. Parnas and Fruman contributed to his 2018 reelection campaign, disguising one contribution to avoid campaign finance limits.\n\nThe indictment alleges that Parnas recruited Sessions, then the chairman of the powerful House Rules Committee, to help try to oust Yovanovitch. At the same time, he and Fruman promised to help Sessions raise more than $20,000 for reelection.\n\nIn a letter last year to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Sessions accused Yovanovitch of disloyalty to the president.\n\nSessions lost his reelection bid, but announced this month that he was running for a different Texas congressional seat in 2020. He said Thursday that he knew nothing about the campaign finance scheme, and that he criticized the ambassador for one reason only: \u201cI believe that political appointees should not be disparaging the president, especially while serving overseas.\u201d", "description": "The cast of characters, both major and peripheral, involved in President Donald Trump's Ukraine saga continues to grow.
