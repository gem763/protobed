It is that they help others to be successful as well.\n\nThere was a strong theme of bigger purpose in this year\u2019s winners. The 11 category winners were led by University of Sydney academic Julie Leask, who is renowned for global research into vaccination uptake. Her work is about targeting the much bigger group, beyond the committed anti-vaxxers, who are genuinely hesitant, or don\u2019t have proper access to health services.\n\nWomen of Influence flows from the Financial Review\u2019s mission statement: that Australia\u2019s success comes from giving everyone access and opportunity. And Women of Influence is more than one night of the year. There are now 700 alumni working in a permanent active network to help women in community and business-based ventures.", "description": "The awards now have a strong theme of successful women bringing others along with them.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4056%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_561%2C$y_288/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/b6ece1a19f903e8dc14bb13956b4d97a19c0a918", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
