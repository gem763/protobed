And with the appointment of the special prosecutor, there remains the possibility that Smollett could be charged again with staging the attack.", "description": "Smollett's argument boiled down to the contention that Smollett shouldn't be required to reimburse the police department because he couldn't have known how much time and money would be spent investigating his allegations.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/03/0/0/AP19085542520434.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
