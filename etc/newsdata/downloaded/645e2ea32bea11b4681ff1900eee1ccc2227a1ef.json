While the primary concern has been on their effect on the climate, these gases and pollutants can also aggravate heart disease and cause inflammation, nerve disorders, atherosclerosis, and even cancer.\n\nThe microscopic PM2.5 particles are especially dangerous -- they're so small they can lodge deep into the lungs and pass into other organs and the bloodstream. In the short term they can cause inflammation and respiratory problems -- in the long term, cancer and heart attacks.\n\nThese harmful effects are most visible in Brazil's \"Arc of Deforestation,\" in the southern part of the rainforest where most of the burning is happening, the report said. In May and June about 5,000 children were hospitalized each month in this region -- twice the expected number.\n\nRed road dust mixes with fire smoke in the town of Ruropolis, Para State, Brazil, on September 6, 2019.", "description": "Wildfires raging in the Amazon rainforest are driving a spike in breathing problems and hospitalizations among children in Brazil, according to a new report.", "authors": ["Jessie Yeung"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191003141621-02-amazon-wildfire-082719-super-tease.jpeg"}
