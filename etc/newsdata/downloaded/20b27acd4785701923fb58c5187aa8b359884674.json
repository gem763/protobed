(Jim Lind)\n\nJim Lind, a photographer/creative photo retoucher based in New York City who is also the creative director for HOWL, says working with his cats was the biggest challenge of executing his \u201cFamily Vacation\u201d series.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a reason that most professional photoshoots involving animals hire pet wranglers and use trained animals. It\u2019s very apparent how terrible my pets are as models once I bring out their outfits, and they scramble away biting and scratching anything that lunges toward them,\u201d he said.\n\nLind, who shoots the images while on family vacations, got the inspiration for this growing project in 2012 after creating a \u201cSave the Date\u201d card for his wedding.\n\n\u201cIt was a picture of my wife stabbing me in the gut with a large sword on the countryside of Edinburgh. We had stumbled across a kitschy photo booth where you could dress up in classic Scottish highland attire and pose for the camera. I\u2019m assuming the photographer had more ordinary customers before us, because he lit up as soon as my wife, Ali, had asked if she could stab me with the sword. We had a good laugh at the image and thought we should do this every year to track the passage of time for our family. After seven years, we have added two cats into the mix, and we\u2019re still going strong.\u201d\n\nLind credits his wife as the support behind the creative process. \u201cShe wears many hats as she is the model, assistant and pet wrangler for this project. Whenever I come up with an idea, she is there to bounce ideas off of or to fan the flame of my imagination. Without her, this probably would\u2019ve just been another idea floating in my head that never came to fruition.\u201d\n\nAn iMac, Wacom tablet, Adobe Photoshop and a camera are essential tools used to construct the spellbinding scenes of \u201cFamily Vacation.\u201d \u201cThe good thing about being a photographer and retoucher is that you can create big-budget ideas on a pittance. The important thing is that I match the photo resolution, lighting direction and camera height, and everything else falls into place much easier. At the end, I usually like to break apart the images in After Effects and make parallax videos for fun, which are somewhere between a flat 2-D image and a 3-D moving scene.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about his postproduction process, he said: \u201cThe process usually starts with a good amount of research of the destination and mood images to draw inspiration from. Once I\u2019ve mulled it over for a good amount of time, I will either sketch it out on paper or write down the idea in detail. Then I have to convince my wife and coax my cats into uncomfortable positions. Once photographed, I sit on the images for way too long until I\u2019m reminded that it\u2019s almost New Year\u2019s and I haven\u2019t even started editing them. If the idea is more fleshed out before the shoot, then it falls into place much faster, and I can finish it in a week or two. However, if I don\u2019t fully know how the image is going to look, then it can take me several weeks to photograph additional details, search for stock or clean up mistakes.\u201d\n\nLind is in the process of editing for next year\u2019s family vacation photo featuring the island of Santorini in Greece. \u201cKeep an eye out in early 2020, as I\u2019m pretty excited for how this one is turning out!\u201d\n\nYou can find out more about Lind on his website.\n\n\n\nRio de Janeiro.
