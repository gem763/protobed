REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\nIn testimony before the U.S. Senate Banking Committee, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson, and Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Mark Calabria defended a plan to release Fannie and Freddie from government control more than a decade after they were bailed out during the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nWhile reiterating that legislation to overhaul the entire system would be ideal, the officials insisted they would pursue reforms if Congress failed to act.\n\n\u201cIf we do nothing, this is going to end very badly,\u201d said Calabria, who warned Fannie and Freddie are undercapitalized and overly reliant on government backing to weather any downturn.\n\nMnuchin said he would like to end a 2012 policy of claiming all Fannie and Freddie profits \u201cvery quickly.\u201d He added that beyond retaining earnings, the pair would also likely need access to third-party capital, estimating they could need to raise roughly $100 billion in reserves.\n\nAnd they received support from Senate Republicans to begin acting alone, as housing lobbyists are extremely pessimistic Congress would pass housing legislation before the 2020 presidential election.\n\n\u201cWhile it\u2019s the proper role for Congress to solve this ... I encourage you to act and to help us get to that point,\u201d said Senate Banking Chairman Mike Crapo.\n\nTheir plan, ordered by President Trump in March and published Thursday, is a first step on the long road to reforming Fannie and Freddie after a 2012 attempt by the Obama administration fell flat.\n\nLawmakers covered a range of legal and economic issues, including how the Treasury intends to bolster Fannie and Freddie\u2019s capital, and how the administration planned to shrink the pair\u2019s footprint, all while keeping mortgage costs stable.\n\nThe administration\u2019s plan called for Congress to pass legislation to ensure the housing market is not destabilized, notably by giving an explicit government guarantee for Fannie and Freddie\u2019s mortgage-backed securities, and setting up new charters that would allow other companies to compete.\n\nRepublicans and Democrats are already at odds over the report. Republicans praise the inclusion of several recommendations outlined in a draft bill unveiled by Crapo in February. Democrats say the plan will drive up housing costs for lower-income Americans.\n\n\u201cRather than create a system that addresses the needs of working families, the Trump Administration has put out half-baked proposals that will make mortgages more expensive and harder to get,\u201d said Senator Sherrod Brown, the top Democrat on the committee.\n\nFannie and Freddie securities have traded in a tight range since the committee meeting began. Fannie preferred shares were last up 0.6% on the day while Freddie preferred shares were up 1.6%. Fannie Mae common shares were last down 4% while Freddie Mac common shares were down 4.6%.", "description": "The Trump administration will pursue the reform of mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , the guarantors of over half the nation's mortgages, if Congress fails to act, officials told Congress on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Pete Schroeder", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190910&t=2&i=1428388300&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF891CJ", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
