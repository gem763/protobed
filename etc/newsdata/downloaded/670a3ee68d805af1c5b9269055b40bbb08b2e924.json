Owning a strong business and reinvesting the dividends is widely seen as an attractive way of growing your wealth. Unfortunately, it's common for investors to be enticed in by the seemingly attractive yield, and lose money when the company has to cut its dividend payments.\n\nPoenina Holding yields a solid 3.8%, although it has only been paying for two years. It's certainly an attractive yield, but readers are likely curious about its staying power. Some simple analysis can reduce the risk of holding Poenina Holding for its dividend, and we'll focus on the most important aspects below.\n\nClick the interactive chart for our full dividend analysis\n\nSWX:PNHO Historical Dividend Yield, October 21st 2019 More\n\nPayout ratios\n\nCompanies (usually) pay dividends out of their earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, the dividend might have to be cut. So we need to form a view on if a company's dividend is sustainable, relative to its net profit after tax. In the last year, Poenina Holding paid out 61% of its profit as dividends. This is a healthy payout ratio, and while it does limit the amount of earnings that can be reinvested in the business, there is also some room to lift the payout ratio over time.\n\nAnother important check we do is to see if the free cash flow generated is sufficient to pay the dividend. Poenina Holding paid out 122% of its free cash flow last year, which we think is concerning if cash flows do not improve. Poenina Holding paid out less in dividends than it reported in profits, but unfortunately it didn't generate enough free cash flow to cover the dividend. Were it to repeatedly pay dividends that were not well covered by cash flow, this could be a risk to Poenina Holding's ability to maintain its dividend.\n\nWith a strong net cash balance, Poenina Holding investors may not have much to worry about in the near term from a dividend perspective.\n\nRemember, you can always get a snapshot of Poenina Holding's latest financial position, by checking our visualisation of its financial health.\n\nDividend Volatility\n\nOne of the major risks of relying on dividend income, is the potential for a company to struggle financially and cut its dividend. Not only is your income cut, but the value of your investment declines as well - nasty. The dividend has not fluctuated much, but with a relatively short payment history, we can't be sure this is sustainable across a full market cycle. During the past two-year period, the first annual payment was CHF1.60 in 2017, compared to CHF1.70 last year. Dividends per share have grown at approximately 3.1% per year over this time.\n\nModest dividend growth is good to see, especially with the payments being relatively stable. However, the payment history is relatively short and we wouldn't want to rely on this dividend too much.\n\nDividend Growth Potential\n\nDividend payments have been consistent over the past few years, but we should always check if earnings per share (EPS) are growing, as this will help maintain the purchasing power of the dividend. EPS have fallen -12% over the last 12 months. That's not great to see, but there could be a number of reasons for this. Should the decline continue, we would become concerned. Any one year of performance can be misleading for a variety of reasons, so we wouldn't like to form any strong conclusions based on these numbers alone.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Today we'll take a closer look at Poenina Holding AG (VTX:PNHO) from a dividend investor's perspective.
