The decisions cost the county millions of dollars in tax revenue from 2013 to 2018, the lawsuit alleges.\n\nBut the county says it has not used executive referrals since 2012: \"That process does not exist in the LA County Assessor's Office,\" spokesperson Steve Whitmore told FOX Business.\n\nPrang, the assessor, arrived in 2014, but hasn\u2019t changed the favorable treatment, Smith said. Prang's predecessor, John Noguez was arrested in 2012 on corruption and conspiracy charges and is still awaiting trial.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s one of the biggest complaints of the whistleblowers I represent, is that nothing has changed under the new assessor,\u201d Smith said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nThe county says things have changed under Prang, that he came in and cleaned up the office after the 2012 scandal.\n\n\"Suffice it to say these allegations are completely unfounded and we are certain that the claims will be found meritless once the facts of the case are presented,\" Whitmore said. \"We want to emphasize that we do not retaliate against our employees and we have taken great measures to prevent what happened in 2012 from ever reoccurring in the office.\"", "description": "The three employees \"basically had their careers destroyed because they were complaining that there was special treatment given to certain individuals and companies,\" lawyer says.", "authors": ["Paul Conner"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/Los-Angeles-iStock.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
