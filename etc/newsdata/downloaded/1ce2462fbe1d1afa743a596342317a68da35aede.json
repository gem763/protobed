REUTERS/Mohamed Azakir/File Photo\n\nHariri\u2019s resignation on Tuesday left a political vacuum at a moment of acute crisis, with reforms urgently needed to ward off even deeper financial problems in one of the world\u2019s most heavily indebted states.\n\nAfter two weeks of anti-government protests largely subsided following Hariri\u2019s announcement, main roads in Lebanon reopened on Wednesday as security forces sought to restore a semblance of normality.\n\nBanks remained closed for an 11th working day but the Association of Lebanese Banks said they would resume normal operations and receive customers on Friday.\n\nPeople took to the streets again late on Wednesday in some parts of Lebanon, including in Beirut and the northern Akkar region where the army clashed with protesters blocking a road.\n\nHariri resigned after massive protests against the political elite, accused by demonstrators of overseeing rampant state corruption, saying he had hit a \u201cdead end\u201d in trying to resolve the crisis. [nL8N27E489]\n\nThe senior official, who declined to be identified, said any new cabinet led by Hariri should not include a group of top-tier politicians who were in the outgoing coalition government, without naming them.\n\nThe cabinet comprised top representatives of most of Lebanon\u2019s sectarian parties, among them foreign minister Gebran Bassil of the Christian Free Patriotic Movement, a prominent target of protesters.\n\nBassil is a political ally of the powerful Iranian-backed Shi\u2019ite group Hezbollah, which had opposed the government\u2019s resignation and has yet to comment on the departure of Hariri, a long-time opponent of the group.\n\nThe crisis has weighed on the country\u2019s sovereign debt and increased pressure on the Lebanese pound, which has been weakening on the parallel market below the official rate of 1,507.5 to the U.S. dollar. Prices in the black market for dollars varied from 1,750 to 1,850 pounds on Wednesday.\n\nThe banks had publicly raised security fears as the reason for their closure. Bankers and analysts have also cited concern about a rush by savers to withdraw their savings or transfer them abroad once the banks reopen.\n\nSCHOOLS AND UNIVERSITIES\n\nPresident Michel Aoun formally asked Hariri on Wednesday to continue in a caretaker role until a new cabinet is formed, as required by Lebanon\u2019s system of government.\n\nThere is no obvious alternative to Hariri as prime minister, a post reserved for a Sunni Muslim in Lebanon\u2019s sectarian power-sharing system.\n\nHariri, Lebanon\u2019s leading Sunni politician, is seen as the focal point for Western and Gulf Arab support for Lebanon, which is in dire need of external financial support to revive its economy and boost its foreign exchange reserves.\n\nThe education minister called on schools and universities to reopen on Thursday.\n\nThe army command said in a statement that people had a right to protest, but that applied \u201cin public squares only\u201d.\n\nAt night, soldiers fired tear gas to disperse protesters who blocked a road in Akkar and demonstrators closed a main route out of Tripoli city nearby, state news agency NNA said.\n\nPeople also returned to block part of a main bridge in Beirut which had re-opened earlier on Wednesday. \u201cWe were sitting at home. But when we saw the scuffles in the north, we came to show solidarity,\u201d said Farah, one of the protesters.\n\nThe main protest camp in a square in central Beirut was closed to traffic by security forces.\n\nHariri made his resignation speech on Tuesday after a crowd loyal to Hezbollah and Amal movements attacked and destroyed the camp in central Beirut.\n\nThe strife was the most serious on the streets of Beirut since 2008, when Hezbollah fighters seized control of the capital in a brief eruption of armed conflict with Lebanese adversaries loyal to Hariri and his allies at the time.\n\nSlideshow (8 Images)\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urged the formation of a new government responsive to the needs of the people. \u201cThe Lebanese people want an efficient and effective government, economic reform, and an end to endemic corruption,\u201d he said.\n\nIran\u2019s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei accused the United States and Saudi Arabia of stoking unrest in Lebanon and urged protesters to seek changes in a lawful way. Iran is a major backer of Hezbollah. [nL8N27F5I4]\n\nAoun said recent events had \u201copened the door to significant reform,\u201d but people would return to the streets if obstacles were placed in the way of the formation of a \u201cclean government\u201d.", "description": "Saad al-Hariri is ready to return as prime minister of a new Lebanese government, a senior official familiar with his thinking said, on condition it includes technocrats and can quickly implement reforms to stave off economic collapse.", "authors": ["Laila Bassam", "Tom Perry", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446696767&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9T148", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
