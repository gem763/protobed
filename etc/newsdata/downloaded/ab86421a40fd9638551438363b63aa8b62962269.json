That might be an unorthodox way to begin: a warning that I am biased in this author\u2019s favor. But actually, no. Two years ago, I admired Douglas Murray\u2019s The Strange Death of Europe from afar. Today, after having come to know him, I can say that Mr. Murray (a senior fellow at National Review Institute) is just as incisive, my appreciation is (deservedly) unwavering \u2014 and in any case, his most recent book, The Madness of Crowds, demands serious attention from friend and foe alike.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe book wades into four thorny issues \u2014 \u201cgay,\u201d \u201cwomen,\u201d \u201crace,\u201d and \u201ctrans\u201d \u2014 marking new territory for the author, whose last book was about Islam and immigration. No tidy resolutions are found in its pages. Rather there are questions \u2014 precisely the right questions \u2014 giving the reader permission to think, without telling her what to think. \u201cI hope that this book will help clear some terrain across which afterwards other people may more safely pass,\u201d he explains in his introduction, invoking as a metaphor the Great Viper, a mine-clearing device used by the British army during the Second World War.\n\nOur culture is a much longer, more sprawling river than is often imagined. Murray treks upstream to the polluted waters of contemporary philosophy, before heading back down to pop culture\u2019s shallower pools. Near the source of these waters, Murray discovers Foucault\u2019s \u201cperverse\u201d and \u201cdishonest\u201d obsession with power, as well as his disregard for charity and forgiveness. He finds latent Marxism, its anti-capitalist formula applied to new structures of \u201cprivilege,\u201d ones that relate to identity. The new formula insists that \u201cthe power of the patriarchal white males must be taken away and shared around more fairly with the relevant minority groups.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the academy, Murray encounters deconstructionists \u2014 perhaps more accurately labeled destructionists \u2014 and, nearby, social constructionists and others who have breathed life into some staggeringly mad ideas (e.g., that gender is entirely a \u201cperformance\u201d untethered to biology). The new \u201cdisciplines\u201d are fool\u2019s gold. Queer studies, black studies, gender studies, whiteness studies \u2014 all explore new \u201cinterlocking oppressions.\u201d Murray observes wryly that no accompanying \u201cmap of utopia\u201d has ever been (or, presumably, ever will be) provided. So what do we nourish ourselves with in the meantime, while awaiting salvation? Shame, anger, confusion, and despair \u2014 all force-fed to the young, whom the author advises us to pity.\n\nThe absurd cannot be explained, only exposed. And what can be said about the gender theorist Judith Butler that her own 100-word sentence (employing such phrases as \u201crelatively homologous,\u201d \u201cstructural tonalities,\u201d and, of course, \u201cpower relations\u201d) does not more immediately demonstrate? How better can the contradictions of modern feminism be summoned than by describing the pop singer Nicki Minaj\u2019s music video \u201cAnaconda,\u201d in which the invitation to \u201clook at her butt\u201d is made rather difficult to refuse, especially for the young man who, \u201cas her butt is being waved right in front of his face for the umpteenth time,\u201d makes the mistake of \u201cplacing one hand gently over her buttocks,\u201d at which point \u2014 consent! consent! \u2014 the music stops, the man is thumped, and his head is left hanging, \u201cmortified at his inexcusable behavior\u201d?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHomosexuality is another area of silently desperate confusion in today\u2019s discourse. Developing an idea from the writer Daniel Mendelsohn \u2014 who described having sex with other men as \u201cfalling through a reflection back into my desire, into . . . my self\u201d \u2014 Murray considers whether, in addition to homosexuality\u2019s being \u201can unstable\u201d foundation for individual identity and a \u201chideously unstable\u201d basis for collective identity, \u201cgays will always present a challenge to something innate in the group that make up the majority in society,\u201d since their desire is potentially more self-regarding than it is other-orientated. (Though, of course, all sexual acts have the potential to become self-regarding \u2014 irrespective of the sex of the partakers.) It\u2019s a fascinating, important consideration \u2014 and, naturally, a troubling one. But wrestle with this publicly and the likely result will be humiliation and loss of employment. Is it worth it? For most people, probably not.\n\nBut what happens when we are prevented from discussing tricky subjects such as race, sex, and sexuality? Far more than mere discomfort. There are victims. Dr. Johanna Olson-Kennedy, the medical director at the largest transgender youth clinic in the United States, is one of four doctors in the country overseeing experimental treatments, sponsored by the National Institutes of Health, on children as young as eight (for which there are no control groups). Such recklessness is funded by millions of dollars from the American taxpayer, who is left largely in the dark by the complicity and cowardice of the mainstream press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOnce, while discussing the removal of healthy breasts from teenage girls who identify as members of the opposite sex, Olson-Kennedy told a cooing, clapping audience: \u201cIf you want breasts at a later point in your life you can go and get them.\u201d \u201cReally?\u201d Murray wonders. \u201cWhere? How? Are people like blocks of Lego onto which new pieces can be stuck, taken off and replaced again at will? Is surgery so painless, bloodless, seamless and scarless today that anyone can just have breasts stuck on them at any point and live happily ever after, enjoying their new acquisitions?\u201d It gets worse. Olson-Kennedy\u2019s husband, a female-to-male transsexual and a social worker at her clinic, called for funds to be raised for the double mastectomy of a girl with Down syndrome, whose mother had only recently claimed her child was transgender.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite plenty more depressing and enraging examples, in many ways Madness is a more hopeful book than its predecessor. The Strange Death of Europe began with the statement \u201cEurope is committing suicide\u201d and ended with the suggestion that there are \u201cno decent answers to the future.\u201d Death spoke of death \u2014 of a culture poisoned by politics, having lost its religion. But Madness focuses on culture primarily as it relates to the individual. And perhaps that\u2019s why Murray thinks something can be done to save it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhat is wrong with the world,\u201d wrote G. K. Chesterton in a book by that name, \u201cis that we do not ask what is right.\u201d Murray\u2019s hope is articulated in similar terms. His great esteem is for the human spirit. Its resilience as well as its capacity for reason and generosity are our best shot at putting odious ideologies behind us and establishing the kind of culture \u201cof which Martin Luther King was dreaming in 1963.\u201d Such a project will take immense personal effort, naturally. A willingness to think out loud and risk being wrong, a readiness to forgive \u2014 and, in turn, be forgiven. Is the public square ready for such sanity? Perhaps not. But where telling the truth becomes impractical for the many, it becomes a moral duty for the few \u2014 those who are not answerable to compromised hierarchies. Writers, for instance.\n\nMurray has neither the tone nor the message of one crying in the wilderness. Rather, his is a voice singing freely in a tuneless land. A voice soaring high above the shrieking, wailing, and babble. It\u2019s an invitation \u2014 both delightfully and devastatingly clear. And who knows? Perhaps more voices \u2014 in welcome, glorious tension \u2014 will form a whole chorus, rising up into the ether toward a worthier aim. Toward harmony, instead of uniformity. Toward order, instead of utopia. And toward truth, instead of false gods and clanging dogma.\n\nThis article appears as \u201cHope Amid the Madness\u201d in the November 11, 2019, print edition of National Review.", "description": "A review of 'The Madness of Crowds: Gender, Race, and Identity,' by Douglas Murray", "authors": ["Madeleine Kearns", "Ramesh Ponnuru", "Jay Nordlinger", "John Hirschauer", "Charles C.
