Total, however, left Iran last year after U.S. sanctions snapped back, leaving CNPC with the opportunity to gain majority in the project. According to Iran\u2019s Petroleum Minister Bijan Zanganeh, however, this did not happen, and the Chinese company pulled out, too, leaving local Petropars solely responsible for the project.\n\nThere have been numerous reports from official Iranian news outlets about continued oil and gas exploration in defiance of U.S. sanctions. Last December, NIOC\u2019s Hendi said, \u201cBased on our Five-Year Development Plan, we have had good achievements in exploration of oil and gas reservoirs, so that we now rank first in terms of oil and gas reserves in the world,\u201d following successful new exploration results.\n\nThe U.S. sanctions have had no impact on exploration operations, Hendi said at the time, which continue as usual. Hendi then added that the sanctions had made Iran self-sufficient in producing equipment for oil and gas exploration.\n\nThe BP Statistical Review of World Energy 2018 with data at end-2017 places Iran fourth in proved oil reserves, behind Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, and Canada, and second in natural gas behind Russia.\n\n\n\nBy Irina Slav for Oilprice.com\n\nMore Top Read From Oilprice.com:\n\nRead this article on OilPrice.com", "description": "Iran\u2019s state oil company has reportedly found a major new gas deposit, containing enough energy to power its capital city for 16-years", "authors": ["Irina Slav"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
