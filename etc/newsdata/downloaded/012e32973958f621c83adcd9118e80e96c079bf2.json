Gorman, chairman & CEO of Morgan Stanley, testifies before a House Financial Services Committee hearing on \"Holding Megabanks Accountable: A Review of Global Systemically Important Banks 10 Years After the Financial Crisis\" on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., April 10, 2019. REUTERS/Aaron P. Bernstein\n\nThe ECB cut rates deeper into negative territory last month and said it would restart asset purchases, igniting a rare public debate as a growing number of policymakers question the value of its deep foray into unconventional monetary policy.\n\nMeanwhile, the Bank of Japan is laying the groundwork for deepening negative interest rates, analysts polled by Reuters said, with two-thirds of respondents expecting the central bank to loosen monetary policy this month.\n\nThe moves have raised a debate about the ammunition other major central banks such as the U.S. Federal Reserve have to fight a slowdown.\n\nHere are some comments made in the past few days:\n\nMORGAN STANLEY\u2019S CHIEF EXECUTIVE, JAMES GORMAN:\n\n\u201cWhat Europe is experiencing with negative rates, obviously is really bad. Not just for the financial sector, but for the broader economy. Do I worry about them being too low? Listen, the Fed\u2019s job is to manage the excesses and to prop up the weaknesses in any economic cycle. There\u2019s no rulebook that Jay Powell\u2019s got on his shelf behind saying at this point, with this information, you should do X. There\u2019s a judgement call. I personally would be more cautious bringing [U.S.] rates down because you are using up one of the tools that you have... At this point, I would probably price one more cut for the rest of the year, and then I would really sit back, watch and wait.\u201d\n\nJ.P. MORGAN CHASE\u2019S CHIEF EXECUTIVE, JAMIE DIMON ON LESSONS FROM THE CASE IN EUROPE:\n\n\u201cI think this is a lesson. I think they did it early on to save Europe basically from coming apart with the monetary union. We don\u2019t know. I think they\u2019ll be writing books about this in 50 to 75 years.\n\n\u201c[Negative rates] has huge negatives for savers and low-income people, for investors and for the capital markets. I, personally, would not buy debt below zero\u2026 There\u2019s something irrational about it\u2026I\u2019m not sure the monetary rules are the same for a negative rate as they are for a positive one.\u201d\n\nTOBIAS ADRIAN, FINANCIAL COUNSELLOR AND DIRECTOR OF THE IMF\u2019S MONETARY AND CAPITAL MARKETS DEPARTMENT:\n\n\u201cRemarkably, the amount of government and corporate bonds with negative yields has increased to about $15 trillion (11.6 trillion pounds). Moreover, markets expect about one-fifth of government bonds will have negative yields for at least three years. With rates staying lower for longer, financial conditions have eased, helping contain downside risks and support global growth for now. But loose financial conditions have encouraged investors to take more risks in a quest to achieve their return targets.\u201d\n\nDANIEL PINTO CO-PRESIDENT AND CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER OF JP MORGAN CHASE INVESTMENT BANK, SPEAKING AT THE INSTITUTE OF INTERNATIONAL FINANCE:\n\n\u201cI think one of the problems with negative (interest) rates is that it tends to have less effect today than a few years ago.\n\n\u201cBefore this current interest rate environment, if rates were going to be so low for so long, we would have started to get worried about the future. But today, as the population gets older and their priorities change, the distribution of rate changes don\u2019t affect the economy as much. For our business, we prefer high interest rates more than low interest rates, but in general, it doesn\u2019t make much of a difference.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the insurance business and pension business, it makes more of a difference because they have certain liabilities that become more difficult to manage as rates go lower and lower.\u201d\n\nRAY DALIO, FOUNDER OF GLOBAL MACRO HEDGE FUND BRIDGEWATER ASSOCIATES:\n\nDalio said he was worried perpetually low or negative interest rates was creating a \u201ccrazy or odd\u201d reality in which debtors barely had to service their debt.\n\n\u201cInterest rates become negative or near negative so the debt service payments for the interest rate are down a lot. And it\u2019s almost a situation where there\u2019s guaranteed debt rollover.\u201d\n\nAUSTRIAN CENTRAL BANK GOVERNOR ROBERT HOLZMANN:\n\nHolzmann, one of the newest members of the ECB\u2019s policy panel, said negative interest rates are not sustainable over the long term and some financial sector players simply can\u2019t adjust.\n\n\u201cInsurance companies and pension funds have no way to neutralise the negative rates and it becomes impossible to provide the rates of return individuals expect,\u201d Holzmann said.\n\nHe argued that given low returns, insurers and pension funds must take on more risk, which could then endanger financial stability.\n\nHolzmann also noted that ultra-low pension returns endanger European efforts to supplement a public pension system with a private pillar, another reason for the ECB to change its approach to negative rates.\n\nITALIAN CENTRAL BANK CHIEF IGNAZIO VISCO:\n\n\u201cBeing very unconventional, I think we have to be very careful of the possible negative effects of negative rates,\u201d Visco told a conference on the sidelines of the IMF and World Bank fall meetings. \u201cI would be very, very careful in going further in this direction.\u201d\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\nRESERVE BANK OF AUSTRALIA GOVERNOR PHILIP LOWE:\n\nLowe said it was \u201cextraordinarily unlikely\u201d that negative interest rates would be implemented to meet the country\u2019s inflation and growth targets, adding that low rates alone were unlikely to stimulate investment.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to speculate on ... negative interest rates and quantitative easing in Australia, other than to say that negative interest rates are extraordinarily unlikely in my country,\u201d Lowe said during a presentation at the IMF and World Bank fall meetings in Washington.", "description": "One of the hot topics of discussion at the International Monetary Fund's annual meeting was negative interest rates, which have been utilized by central banks in the euro zone and Japan to boost growth.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191019&t=2&i=1442495431&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9H25Y", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
