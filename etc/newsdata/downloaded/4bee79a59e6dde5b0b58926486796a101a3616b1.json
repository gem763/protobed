(AP) - Dawn Staley is ready to coach the game\u2019s best, just not yet.\n\nStaley, the U.S. national women\u2019s coach and head coach at South Carolina, will leave Monday for Miami for a quick mini-cap before the Americans head to Puerto Rico for the FIBA AmeriCup. It\u2019s a 10-team, weeklong event among countries in Central, North and South America that starts Sept. 22.\n\nGiven the continuing WNBA playoffs, Staley\u2019s certain most of the expected Olympians she\u2019ll guide in Tokyo next summer like Elena Della Donne of the Washington Mystics and A\u2019ja Wilson of the Las Vegas Aces will be tied up with their pro teams and unavailable to play in Puerto Rico. Still, she\u2019s got commitments from at least eight gold medal winners from 2016 for the 2020 games.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re used to working with each other and coming together for a common goal,\u201d said Staley, a three-time gold medalist as a player making her Olympic debut as head coach. \u201cThe USA Basketball culture is a coach\u2019s dream because they just want to win. And when you have that element, you\u2019re not dealing with anything besides winning and preparation to win.\u201d\n\nStaley followed the men\u2019s national team at the ongoing FIBA World Cup in China, both as a basketball fan and a cautionary tale of what can happen when players are not as familiar with each other as the women\u2019s teams have been much of the past 25 years .\n\n\u201cWe make it look like it\u2019s easy\u201d competing against the rest of the world, Staley said. \u201cBut we (coaches) stay up at night figuring out how we\u2019re going to play.\u201d\n\nHaving the best players available helps.\n\nEven then, Staley said while scoring is never an issue but defense is where the U.S. women will need to come together if they hope for a seventh consecutive Olympic title.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to get them out of their habits and get them into one habit with not a lot of playing time,\u201d Staley said.\n\nThat\u2019s part of why USA Basketball announced an expanded training program , including $2,000 a day for participating in camps and tournaments, with players like Della Donne, Wilson, Sue Bird and Diana Taurasi committed to extra team training sessions between November and April. WNBA All-Star Skylar Diggins-Smith, who missed the league season because she became a first-time mom, is joining Staley in Miami. While Diggins-Smith won\u2019t scrimmage or go to Puerto Rico, she\u2019ll learn Staley\u2019s system point guard to point guard.\n\nStaley is not worried about falling short, as the U.S. men did in losing in the World Cup quarterfinals.\n\nThe American women appear as stacked as ever heading into the next year.\n\n\u201cWhat I will do is get on my knees and pray that they\u2019re healthy\u201d for the Olympics, Staley said. \u201cThey\u2019ve already committed and they need to be out on the floor playing to ensure that we\u2019re able to compete and win another gold medal.\u201d\n\nStaley is heading out Monday after finishing up with her day job as Gamecocks coach . She worked out the team Friday and has a weekend of recruiting ahead - South Carolina football hosts No. 2 Alabama in a sold-out game - before turning her attention to the U.S. team.\n\n\u201cYou have to take one day at a time or it will overwhelm you,\u201d said Staley, smiling. \u201cI\u2019m good at compartmentalizing my life.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Dawn Staley is ready to coach the game's best, just not yet.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Pete Iacobelli"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/11/around_the_wnba_basketball_39190_c0-70-1675-1046_s1770x1032.jpg?cb342967521a9aab46a664660412ce5dfc0b7291", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
