There are bucket hats, baggy jeans, the tease of a return of hyper-colour t-shirts (pls pls pls) and I got to talk with an actual god-damned Backstreet Boy on the phone. If I could go back and tell Courtney in 1999 that she\u2019ll grow up to being someone who gets to reminisce on the 90s with the Backstreet Boys (!!!) she would not believe me in the slightest.\n\nYep, legit BSB legend AJ McLean got on the phone with us in the lead up to the Backstreet Boys bringing their huge world tour over to Australia in 2020, and walked me through a few of his choice looks that he kinda regrets.\n\n\u201cThere was a point in my hair changes that I ended up getting a spiral perm because I wanted to have an afro,\u201d AJ said.\n\n\u201cAnd I had an afro\u2013it was a legit afro. I had a pick, I picked that thing out. Cornrows, I could never have done that and been fine.\u201d\n\n\u201cSadly I lost my hair, and then I went with technology and got my hair back. So now I\u2019ve just recently started going back in my head like \u2018maybe I\u2019ll do the frosted tip thing again\u2018 I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m just kidding.\u201d\n\nLook, it was a trying time for everyone, really. I have strong memories of learning about pencil eyeliner and turning out some seriously questionable looks. I distinctly remember owning a \u201cmakeup palette\u201d that had lip colour that apparently could also be cream blush and eyeshadow. I understand.\n\nBut what looks from the 90s did he actually like?\n\n\u201cI think one of my all-time favourite ones that I ever did when I used to dye my hair, I dyed my hair leopard print,\u201d he said.\n\nI have tried in vain to track down a picture of this look because it honestly sounds fucking incredible. Please, someone send me a picture. I need to see.\n\nUntil then, more hyper-90s fashion:\n\nThe late 90s sure were\u2026a time.\n\nDespite being an iconic poster boy for the 90s and essentially a distillation of that era of fashion, right down to the bleach-tipped hair, tinted tiny sunglasses, and a penchant for an outrageous cowboy hat or full white top hat and tails (?) there is a fashion trend that AJ doesn\u2019t think he can revisit offstage.\n\n\u201cThere were some really bad wardrobe choices, but that\u2019s what was in, in that time. And now all that\u2019s starting to come back,\u201d he said.\n\nThat 90s look, the baggy jeans. I will never wear baggy ever again like I wear stuff so tight it\u2019s ridiculous. But I could never wear baggy, ever again. In our show now, I do wear baggy jeans and the first couple of shows it was uncomfortable. You think it\u2019d be the opposite but I was like I don\u2019t feel right, I feel like I took a poop in my pants. I don\u2019t feel right with this right now. And now, over the course of this tour, I\u2019m like you know what? If this was tight I\u2019d be sweaty, I\u2019d be uncomfortable, this is brilliant, I love this. I just had to dust off the cobwebs.\n\nThe Backstreet Boys are coming to Australia in all their 90s boy band/vocal group glory in May next year, and have just announced a couple more dates in Sydney and Melbourne, because way too many of us are apparently keen as mustard to revisit our own personal terrible fashion choices from the 90s.\n\nCop your tickets over here, Backstreet\u2019s back, baby.\n\nBACKSTREET BOYS AUSTRALIAN 2020 DNA TOUR\n\nWednesday, May 20\n\nBrisbane Entertainment Centre\n\nBRISBANE\n\nFriday May 22\n\nQudos Bank Arena\n\nSYDNEY\n\nSaturday May 23\n\nQudos Bank Arena\n\nSYDNEY\n\n(New Show)\n\nTuesday May 26\n\nRod Laver Arena\n\nMELBOURNE\n\nWednesday May 27\n\nRod Laver Arena\n\nMELBOURNE\n\n(New Show)\n\nSaturday May 30\n\nRAC Arena\n\nPERTH", "description": "The 90s were fraught with a lot of ill-advised fashions so Backstreet Boys style icon, AJ McLean, took PEDESTRIAN.TV through his cringiest looks.", "authors": ["Courtney Fry"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/aj-mclean-fb.png", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
