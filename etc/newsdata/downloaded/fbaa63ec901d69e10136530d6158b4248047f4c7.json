She appears restless and gives up on her game and launches herself back on to the tyres.\n\nIt was captioned: 'The female panda likes to jump into the tyres and stand on her head in them.\n\n'Sometimes she gently nibbles the tyres or drags them from one place to another where she lies in them, spreading her legs wide in the air.'\n\nThe panda rocked across the tyres and swung its legs across playfully after giving up on toying with a plastic container nearby. She arrived at the Moscow Zoo in April as part of a scientific programme along side a panda called Ruyi\n\nDing Ding clambers into one of the tyres and attempts an almost head-stand. Other times she 'gently nibbles the tyres or drags them from one place to another where she lies in them'\n\nThe zoo revealed the panda's tendency towards cardboard boxes and plastic barrels when she has had enough of the tyres.\n\n'She also enjoys the enclosure's water feature, especially on sunny days.'\n\nDing Ding arrived at Moscow Zoo in April after living at a Dujiangyan base in Sichuan, China, as part of a research collaboration between Russia and China.\n\nThis is just the second time that Russia has received pandas from China, with two joining Moscow from Baoxing in 1957.\n\nZoo director Svetlana Akulova told Central European News (CEN): 'We import bamboo from China every Friday and they eat around 40 kilogrammes (88 lbs) every day.'\n\nThe Moscow zoo makes pancakes with cornmeal to satisfy the animal's taste buds for the dessert.\n\nOtherwise their diet includes carrots, sweet potatoes and apples.", "description": "A panda called Ding Ding, 2, appears at home at Moscow Zoo after a clip emerged of her showing '101 different ways' to play with a car tyre, posted online yesterday.
