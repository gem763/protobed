Later, an area roughly 45 miles north of Aguililla was the scene of fierce clashes between members of the Jalisco New Generation cartel and regional self-defense groups.\n\nIn 2013, civilian groups faced with what they said was state inaction armed themselves in Michoac\u00e1n to fight the Caballeros Templarios (Knights Templar) cartel, one of whose bases was Aguililla.\n\nThey said they took up arms to defend themselves from kidnappings, extortion and killings. But some of the self-defense or vigilante groups were infiltrated by cartels and gangs.\n\nThe government of the former president Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto launched a process to disarm and legalize the vigilante groups and incorporate them into official security forces.\n\nMichoac\u00e1n\u2019s governor, Silvano Aureoles, has said the self-defense groups have not returned and has criticized federal authorities for not attacking cartels in his state with sufficient force and negotiating with vigilante groups he refers to as criminals.\n\nBesides avocado orchards, Michoac\u00e1n for decades has been known for marijuana plantations and the making of methamphetamine, as well as being home to the port of L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas, a key entry point of precursor chemicals used to make synthetic drugs.", "description": "\u2018Armed civilians\u2019 shoot state officers executing a judicial order in Michoac\u00e1n state, which has seen recent spike in violence", "authors": ["Associated Press In Mexico City"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e367ede1ce38e292edc804d57770846c99d507ac/0_110_4460_2677/master/4460.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=285315f3f5908dbc61772f96ccfc844e", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
