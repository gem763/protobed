She believes the biggest argument against homeownership is the idea that you can pick up and move at any point if a good job comes available in another area, giving a person the flexibility to pivot easily.\n\n\"But flexibility is the antithesis of stability, and people crave stability in their lives,\" Tarlov said.\n\nCLICK TO GET THE FOX BUSINESS APP\n\nTarlov said there is nothing more stable than being able to point to your home and saying you own it.", "description": "With a Wall Street Journal report saying the mortgage market is starting to reopen to more risky borrowers, some experts are concerned we could be on the brink of another financial crisis.", "authors": ["Blair Shiff"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/08/0/0/AP18238644560922.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"}
