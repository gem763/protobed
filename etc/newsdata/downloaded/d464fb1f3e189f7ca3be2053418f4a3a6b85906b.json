The department under Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has taken an unprecedented role in addressing what the Trump administration has called pervasive anti-Israel bias at colleges and universities.\n\nMrs. DeVos has publicly criticized activists who support \u201cBoycott, Divest, Sanctions\u201d policies against Israel over its treatment of Palestinians, a movement the secretary once called a \u201cpernicious threat\u201d on college campuses. The department\u2019s civil rights chief, Ken Marcus, previously ran an advocacy organization that filed civil rights complaints against BDS groups on campuses, arguing that they discriminated against Jewish students.\n\nIn a letter it issued to the two schools in August after a monthslong investigation, the department concluded that the curriculum doesn\u2019t align with guidelines for a $235,000 federal grant the program receives for international studies and foreign language programs.\n\n\u201cFederal funding is conditioned on a demonstration that a given center program is a \u2018national resource,\u2019\u201d the department\u2019s assistant secretary for postsecondary education, Robert King, wrote in the letter. \u201cWe are concerned that most of the Duke-UNC [Center for Middle Eastern Studies] activities supported with Title VI funds are unqualified.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times first reported the delivery of the letter.\n\nMr. King wrote in the letter that the Middle East program\u2019s emphasis on foreign-language instruction was unclear and took issue with the extent of its cultural offerings, saying they didn\u2019t advance U.S. economic or national security goals, and pointed specifically to a conference on art and film.\n\n\u201cAlthough Iranian art and film may be\u2026subjects of deep intellectual interest and may provide insight regarding aspects of the people and culture of the Middle East, the sheer volume of such offerings highlights a fundamental misalignment\u201d between the university\u2019s goals and those of the federal government, the letter states.\n\nThe department also concluded that the Middle Eastern studies program, among other things, \u201coffers very few, if any, programs on the historic discrimination faced by, and current circumstances of, religious minorities in the Middle East.\u201d\n\nThe investigation found that the program put \u201cconsiderable emphasis\u201d on the positive aspects of Islam, while not attempting to similarly demonstrate the positive aspects of Judaism and Christianity. The letter stated that the program\u2019s offerings were unduly focused on \u201cadvancing ideological priorities.\u201d\n\nThe department ordered the two universities to submit a revised curriculum, listing events it plans to host and the professors it employs. The universities were given a deadline of Sept. 22, before the department awards new grants at the end of the month.\n\nIn a statement, UNC-Chapel Hill said it is \u201ccommitted to working with the department to provide more information about its programs.\u201d Duke didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe letter\u2019s demands, particularly those taking issue with the viewpoints of the program\u2019s courses and professors, raised concern among advocates of free speech and academic freedom. Suzanne Nossel, chief executive of PEN America, a nonprofit group promoting freedom of expression, said that, while the letter raises legitimate concerns if federal funds are going toward courses that don\u2019t prepare students to speak Middle Eastern languages, as the grant requires, its reference to ideological positions is troubling.\n\n\u201cWhere it gets tricky is that a piece of this seems to touch on a sort of ideological policing,\u201d Ms. Nossel said. \u201cThe Department of Education needs to be scrupulous that they\u2019re not policing viewpoints.\u201d\n\nAs reports of the letter circulated, some advocates went further, accusing the Education Department of anti-Muslim bias, a notion the agency rejected.\n\n\u201cPro-Islamic programming isn\u2019t the concern\u2014it\u2019s the lack of diversity and foreign-language learning,\u201d spokeswoman Angela Morabito said in a statement. \u201cThe department is absolutely not criticizing the school for teaching the positive aspects of Islam.\u201d\n\nWrite to Michelle Hackman at Michelle.Hackman@wsj.com", "description": "The Education Department ordered Duke University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill to overhaul their joint Middle Eastern studies program, saying it reflected anti-Israel bias.", "authors": ["Michelle Hackman", "Michelle.Hackman Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-109038/social", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
