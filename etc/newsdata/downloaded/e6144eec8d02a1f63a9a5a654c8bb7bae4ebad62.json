The Louvre said the museum\u2019s request to borrow the work is still pending.\n\nLate runner: The Vitruvian Man\n\nThe final act in the row between Paris and Rome over Italy\u2019s contributions to the show came with a last-minute legal effort to halt the loan of the iconic Vitruvian Man drawing.\n\nLast week an Italian court rejected a bid by an association advocating for the protection of Italy\u2019s heritage \u2014 Italia Nostra (Our Italy) \u2014 to halt the loan of the work dating from the late 15th century, arguing that it was too fragile to travel.\n\nA spat over Italy\u2019s contributions to the Louvre show erupted late last year when the new populist rulers in Rome took issue with the previous government\u2019s agreement with Paris.\n\nLucia Borgonzoni, the number two in Italy\u2019s culture ministry and a member of the anti-immigration League party, argued that the accord was lopsided in favour of France.\n\nAt the height of the row, it appeared that Italy would cancel the accord altogether. It was finally resolved with Paris pledging to loan several Raphaels to Rome next year, the quincentenary of that artist\u2019s death.\n\nThe Vitruvian Man \u2014 which Italian media say is insured for at least one billion euros \u2014 will join the Louvre show later this month, but only for a few weeks rather than the full four months.\n\nThe drawing, kept in a climate-controlled vault in the Accademia Gallery in Venice, is rarely displayed to the public.\n\nThe exhibition curated by the Louvre\u2019s Vincent Delieuvin and Louis Frank, the heads of the museum\u2019s painting and graphic arts departments, includes infrared reflectographs that offer an insight into the master painter\u2019s techniques.", "description": "Paris (AFP) \u2013 A blockbuster retrospective of Leonardo da Vinci opens Thursday at the Louvre museum to mark 500 years since the death of the", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/22/daaedf_vitruvian-man-drawing-travel-exhibition-fears-its-fragility-louvre-blockbuster-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
