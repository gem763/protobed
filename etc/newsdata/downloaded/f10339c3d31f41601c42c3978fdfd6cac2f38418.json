May will step down as the Conservative Party leader on June 7 and remain as a caretaker prime minister throughout the party's leadership election process, which will begin the following week.\n\nThat could mean going back to the European Union to start from scratch and negotiate a new deal \u2014 but it could also mean drastic steps like a no-deal Brexit.\n\nShould the no-deal option be pursued by a Brexiteer successor to May, it would likely face severe backlash in Parliament and lead to an early general election.\n\nGo deeper: Everything you need to know about Brexit", "description": "It'll be up to someone else to move forward on Brexit.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/jBfzTX7HHp9dvWwDYe4KxfTnbS0=/0x0:4256x2394/1920x1080/2019/05/22/1558539005904.jpg", "published_at": "2019-05-24"}
