The percentages of whites, and white Republicans, who strongly agree that \u201cwhite people are currently under attack in this country\u201d have each dropped by roughly 25 points from the same time two years ago.\n\nDavid A. Graham: Trump\u2019s white identity politics appeals to two different groups\n\nIt isn\u2019t entirely clear what is motivating these changes. As Ashley Jardina, a political scientist at Duke, told me recently, there has been a 10 percent drop in the number of Americans who espouse white identity politics since Trump entered office. Many members of that group interpreted the election of Barack Obama, the first black president, as a threat to their group, and with Obama out of office, they may feel less threatened. Jardina also noted, though, that Trump\u2019s most explicit racist rhetoric turns off voters who may feel threatened but don\u2019t exhibit classical racial prejudice.\n\nBut the Trump era has also radicalized Democrats, and especially white Democrats, who by some measures are actually more liberal on race than fellow Democrats who are minorities. Reuters found that more Democrats say blacks are treated unfairly at work and by the police than in 2016\u2014remarkable given how coverage of police violence toward African Americans has dropped in the past few years\u2014while Republican attitudes have remained unchanged.\n\nMeanwhile, opinion shifts like the ones on race appear elsewhere. Consider immigration, which is Trump\u2019s signature issue\u2014though it is also inextricable from race, especially given Trump\u2019s focus on and rhetoric about Hispanic immigration.\n\nReuters found that white Americans are 19 percent more supportive of a path to citizenship for unauthorized immigrants than they were four years ago, and slightly less supportive of increased deportations. Other polls find related results. A record-high number of Americans\u201475 percent\u2014said in 2018 that immigration is good for the United States. Although the Trump administration took steps last week to limit even legal immigration, the Trump presidency has seen an increase in the number of Americans who support more legal immigration\u2014not just among Democrats, but even slightly among Republicans.\n\nDavid A. Graham: Trump goes all in on racism\n\nTrump, like other presidents but arguably more so, exerts a special type of gravity by virtue of his ability to set the topic of conversation. His fearmongering on immigration has led even Trump critics to argue that if moderates and liberals do not limit immigration, it will embolden hard-liners like Trump. Yet far from suggesting a large appetite for greater immigration restrictions that\u2019s being unmet, the polling data suggest a large appetite for more immigration that\u2019s going unfulfilled thanks to Trump\u2019s aggressive rhetoric. Moreover, there\u2019s been evidence of a backlash against the president\u2019s invective since the first months of his term. Trump has managed to force a national conversation around immigration, but rather than bring people to his side, he has convinced them he\u2019s wrong.", "description": "The president is reshaping Americans\u2019 political views, just not the way he intended.", "authors": ["David A.
