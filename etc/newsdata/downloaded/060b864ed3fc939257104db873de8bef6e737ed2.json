(NS: ), which has sizable exposure to the cash-strapped shadow lenders, slumped a record 5.5 cents to 80.9 cents on the dollar on Wednesday, the lowest since the bonds were sold in 2018.\n\nThe bank is at the epicenter of rising stress in India\u2019s credit markets, where shock defaults last year by a major infrastructure lender have led to broader strains at other shadow banks. Yes Bank\u2019s shares collapsed about 23% on Tuesday to the lowest since 2009, amid concerns that a cleanup in corporate debt could drag on. Debt woes among India\u2019s non-bank lenders including Indiabulls (NS: ) Housing Finance Ltd. have also prompted jitters for the sector.\n\n\u201cThe stock and bonds both are reflecting investor concerns on asset quality, where slower resolutions and rising stress could continue to pose pressure,\u201d said Diksha Gera, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst.\n\nA report that Yes Bank shares pledged by its co-founder Rana Kapoor, have been sold, has also weighed on the bank\u2019s shares. The India stock market is closed today for a holiday.\n\nKapoor stepped down as chief executive officer earlier this year after the Reserve Bank of India refused to grant him another three-year term amid a controversy over bad-debt accounting.", "description": "Indian Lender Yes Bank Bonds Slump by Record After Stock Crash", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic84460dd86d02d8d785da3b654cd025fb.jpg"}
