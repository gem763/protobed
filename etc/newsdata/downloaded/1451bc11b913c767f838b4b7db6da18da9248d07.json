Inflation is running high and citizens are finding their disposable income so squeezed they can\u2019t afford to go to the cinema or buy carpets for their homes anymore.\n\nAll those who spoke to Insider said they haven\u2019t seen any positive side to the sanctions, but that they are affecting every aspect of their daily lives.\n\nScroll down to see how US sanctions are impacting Iranians, from local skateboarders to carpet sellers to movie-goers:\n\nInflation is at a high in Iran, with $1 being worth 115,000 Iranian rials right now. This photo \u2014 which shows 130,000 rials \u2014 is worth $1.13.\n\ncaption A photo of Iranian bank notes, worth (in anti-clockwise order) 100,000 rials, 20,000 rials, and 10,000 rials. source Masoud Soheili/Business Insider\n\nTwo years ago, $1 was worth 30,000 rials.\n\nThe Trump administration in November 2018 re-imposed the ban on importing Persian \u201ccarpets of Iranian origin,\u201d leaving once-crowded carpet bazaars empty. Many Iranians can\u2019t afford to buy the rugs, and foreigners face difficulties exporting them.\n\ncaption Inside a near-empty carpet bazaar in Tabriz, Iran. source Masoud Soheili/Business Insider\n\nSource: US Treasury Department\n\nHashem Sekhavatmand, who has been selling carpets in the city of Tabriz since his teenage years, says he\u2019s never experienced a business downfall like this before.\n\ncaption Hashem Sekhavatmand in Tabriz bazaar, Iran. source Masoud Soheili/Business Insider\n\n\u201cHe should take out all Persian carpets in the White House,\u201d another carpet seller in Tabriz (not pictured) told Business Insider. \u201cPersian carpets should have nothing to do with political embargoes.\u201d\n\ncaption A carpet seller in Tabriz, Iran. source Masoud Soheili/Business Insider\n\nThere are no bars or clubs in Iran, so cinema is one of the most popular ways for Iranians to pass their time.\n\ncaption Outside Howeize Cinema in Mashhad, Iran. source Masoud Soheili/Business Insider\n\nBut fewer and fewer Iranians can go now because US sanctions have squeezed their disposable income.\n\ncaption Inside a near-empty theater in Howeize Cinema in Mashhad. source Masoud Soheili/Business Insider\n\nIran hasn\u2019t imported any Hollywood films since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, but that hasn\u2019t stopped US sanctions from affecting the country\u2019s movie industry. Inflation in the country has slashed the industry\u2019s budgets and ability to market internationally, Variety reported earlier this year.\n\ncaption An empty hallway inside a cinema in Mashhad, Iran. source Masoud Soheili/Business Insider\n\nSource: Variety\n\nMore and more young Iranians are getting into skateboarding, which is considered a western sport. They\u2019re finding it hard to source accessories and coaches for their sport.\n\ncaption Young Iranian skateboarders in Nahjolbalaghe Park, Tehran. source Masoud Soheili/Business Insider\n\n\u201cIran doesn\u2019t have any local brands for skateboarding and since our country is under sanctions right now and it\u2019s really hard to import anything from the West,\u201d one skateboarder, Negin Baghi, told Business Insider. She added that skateboarding accessories are hard to find and expensive.\n\ncaption Baghi in Nahjolbalaghe Park. source Masoud Soheili/Business Insider\n\nIran\u2019s fallen currency has, however, made it a cheaper country for tourists. Many bazaars in touristic areas are mostly occupied by tourists.\n\ncaption Reza bazaar in Mashhad, Iran. source Masoud Soheili/Business Insider\n\nMohammad Javad Zarif, Iran\u2019s foreign minister, accused the US earlier this month of \u201cDELIBERATELY targeting ordinary citizens,\u201d and called it \u201c#EconomicTerrorism, illegal & inhuman.\u201d\n\ncaption Russia\u2019s Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov meets his Iran\u2019s counterpart Javad Zarif in Moscow source Reuters\n\nSource: Javad Zarif/Twitter\n\nAnti-US sentiment can also be seen around many Iranian cities, and the wall outside the former US embassy in Tehran here is plastered with anti-US murals.
