It has since been updated and republished.\n\nOver the last month, solar stocks have really taken it on the chin. But once again, the huge declines are totally unjustified, creating a great buying opportunity for longer-term investors. As I\u2019ve noted in the past, I\u2019m convinced that JinkoSolar (NYSE:JKS), SunPower (NASDAQ:SPWR) and Daqo New Energy (NYSE:DQ) are great solar stocks to buy.\n\nIn the past month, JKS stock has tumbled 18%, SPWR stock has sunk 15% and DQ stock has lost 6%.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe catalyst for the retreat of solar stocks appears to be a decision by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to eliminate \u201ca requirement for utilities to offer long-term fixed prices for qualifying facilities.\u201d More specifically, many investors may have sold solar stocks due to dramatic language used by Democratic FERC Commissioner Richard Glick, who claimed the FERC\u2019s decision could pose a major threat to the proliferation of renewable energy in the U.S.\n\nBut I\u2019ll give those who have been completely avoiding the news for the last year a tip. The U.S. is going to have a very consequential presidential election in just over a year. Appointed officials are very political, and Glick was trying to dramatize the ramifications of the vote for partisan purposes.\n\nMuch more trustworthy are the assessments of apolitical Greentech and Colin Smith, the senior solar analyst at Wood Mackenzie Power & Renewables. Greentech said that the vote would have a \u201cmuted impact\u201d on U.S. solar. Smith maintained that the decision would affect less than 5% of solar projects under development today.\n\nOther much more powerful catalysts will ultimately have a bigger impact on solar stocks. Among these are the increased price competitiveness of solar energy in China and solar energy mandates in the U.S. Below I\u2019ll explore how JKS, DQ and SPWR will be positively impacted by these trends.\n\n\n\n\n\nSolar Stocks to Buy: JinkoSolar (JKS)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nResearchers from the KTH Royal Institute of Technology, M\u00e4lardalen University and Tsinghua University determined that, in all major Chinese cities, solar energy can be produced more cheaply than electricity from the grid. The research was originally reported in the journal Nature Energy.\n\nMeanwhile, the China Electric Power Planning and Engineering Institute has estimated that Chinese electricity demand would surge nearly 6% this year. Higher demand, combined with lower prices, is usually a winning formula for companies.\n\nMoreover, JinkoSolar\u2019s margins are likely higher in its home market because of lower shipping costs and the absence of any tariffs. Consequently, the coming expansion of solar energy in China should have a tremendously positive impact on Jinko\u2019s bottom line.\n\nAlso interesting is that, as of the end of the second quarter, the holders of JKS stock include some of the biggest names on Wall Street. The list includes names like Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Citigroup (NYSE:C), Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) and UBS (NYSE:UBS). Those big boys are usually not all wrong about a stock.\n\n\n\n\n\nSunPower (SPWR)\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nSunPower stock should benefit from four strong trends that are boosting solar energy in the U.S. SPWR will be boosted by the increasing cost-competitiveness of solar energy. But within America, SunPower is also getting huge lifts from state renewable energy mandates and from the increased use of solar energy by companies.", "description": "Editor's note: This story was previously published in June 2019.
