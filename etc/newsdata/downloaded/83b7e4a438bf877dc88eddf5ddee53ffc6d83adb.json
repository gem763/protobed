Little kid runs up to his tiny basketball hoop, dunks the ball, turns around to flex and holler. Meanwhile he doesn\u2019t see that the whole backboard is wobbling and about to collapse on his head. When it does, he looks confused.\n\nCongrats, New York Times! And Politico. And CNN. You\u2019re all the Dunking Kids. You keep throwing down on the Trump administration. The backboard of truth keeps falling on your head. The rest of us laugh.\n\nThe New York Times just issued its most spectacular correction since my personal favorite, from Nov. 7, 2012: \u201cAn earlier version of this article misspelled the singer\u2019s surname in a number of places. He is Bruce Springsteen, not Springstein.\u201d\n\nThis Sunday\u2019s correction cut the legs out from under its big Saturday scoop about a supposed new sex scandal about Brett Kavanaugh involving a woman who supposedly had Kavanaugh\u2019s penis shoved into her hand when they were both at Yale. The Times\u2019 gobsmacking correction noted that in the book from which its Saturday report was derived, \u201cthe female student declined to be interviewed and friends say that she does not recall the incident. That information has been added to the article.\u201d\n\nBackboard of truth meets skull.\n\nThis capped off a week in which the Times had to delete a tweet praising Mao Zedong, one of history\u2019s greatest mass murderers, as \u201cone of history\u2019s great revolutionary figures\u201d and another tweet saying that what happened on 9/11 was that \u201cairplanes took aim and brought down the World Trade Center.\u201d Times editors doubtless thought that mentioning radical Islamists were the ones who aimed those airplanes would play into Trump\u2019s hands.\n\nsee also NYT corrects story detailing Brett Kavanaugh sex misconduct claim The New York Times had to issue an embarrassing correction...\n\nMeanwhile, Politico was sticking with a bonkers attempt to make a scandal out of Air Force members paying a cheap $130 a night to stay at a Trump resort in Scotland called Turnberry while they were refueling their planes at a nearby airport Trump does not own or profit from.\n\nPolitico solemnly reported that \u201cup to 6 percent\u201d of Air Force members had stayed at the Trump property while refueling at the airport. So the resort is affordable, service members have been staying there since the Obama years and at least 94 percent of those staying in the area stay at some other hotel. Politico tried to frame this as a violation of the Emoluments Clause that forbids presidents from cashing in on their position while in office. That doesn\u2019t pass the laugh test.\n\nMeanwhile, MSNBC gave airtime to Jason Johnson, a journalism professor from Morgan State, who made the following vicious, defamatory and utterly bonkers statement about Justice Kavanaugh: \u201cI\u2019ve never heard of a guy who is a one-time rapist. I\u2019ve never heard of a one-time sexual assaulter. I grew up with guys like this. He\u2019s from around this area, right? He is the fifth guy in a gang rape. He\u2019s the guy who comes in after he is drunk because everybody else encourages him and he can get away with it. He\u2019s been pretty much covered his entire life. And now he\u2019s on the Supreme Court.\u201d\n\nJust a few days earlier, CNN issued a report on the circumstances around an American spy being taken out of Russia that was so wrong, the Times felt moved to contradict it: The decision to extract the spy was made while Obama was president, the Times reported, yet CNN blamed Trump for endangering the agent and forcing his extraction.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just a story of media bias. It\u2019s a story of utter unbe-frickin\u2019-lievable obliviousness by the media. CNN doesn\u2019t bother putting a fig leaf on anything anymore: A glance at CNN\u2019s homepage on any given day is like looking at an assortment of Democratic Party press releases.\n\nAny news that might be happening that can\u2019t be weaponized against Trump is of little interest. Any news that might make Trump or anyone on the right look bad is eagerly pushed through, ordinary standards of fairness and checking be damned.\n\nThe media think Trump\u2019s sometimes overblown attacks on them are making it more vital than ever. But what\u2019s really happening is that the media is beclowning itself trying to end Trump. One recent survey found 95 percent of Americans saying they were troubled by the current state of the media, and two-thirds think journalistic ethics will get worse during the election season.
