AFP/Getty\n\n\u201cIt has been impossible to get any domestic legislation done. Our politicians are unable to respond to the needs of young women with the domestic legislative response that is required to help those who are living right at the edges of society. These young women are looking at politicians who are not looking back because they are too busy fighting among themselves.\n\n\u201cThe last year has seen the coming together of lots of different bits of context. Young women have been the worst affected by austerity. They are much more likely to be offered a zero hours contract than young men. They are increasingly telling us their wellbeing is in decline and their financial situation is in decline, and they are feeling overlooked and ignored.\u201d\n\nThe research shows young women feel ignored by politicians as they are forced to battle low pay, in-work poverty and barriers to work, Ms Walker added.\n\nShe said: \u201cMore than one million young women in England and Wales are out of work or trapped in a low-paid job. More than one million have been paid less than a male colleague who has done the same or similar work. More than 800,000 have been sexually harassed at work and not reported it. And one in four young mothers have experienced discrimination when their employer found they were pregnant. The government must crack down on pregnancy discrimination and sexual harassment at work; and fix Universal Credit so that young women \u2013 who are more reliant on welfare support than young men \u2013 receive adequate, timely support.\"\n\nThe campaigner, who argued MPs urgently need to reconnect with young women, said the government needs to invest equally in training and skills for young women as they do for young men. She demanded equally available and funded vocational training for young women and called for apprentices to be paid equally whether in care or construction.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

It found 28 per cent skip meals every day and half skip meals at least once a week to feed their children.\n\nAmong those receiving universal credit, 37 per cent are skipping meals every day to make ends meet.\n\nYoung mothers who are in work often also struggle as they get less government support under the age of 25 and are more likely to be in low-paid jobs. Under-25s are not entitled to the national living wage but they are more likely to work in low-paid sectors such as clerical work, care and cleaning.\n\nSome 86 per cent of the burden of austerity since 2010 has fallen on women, research carried out by the House of Commons Library found in 2017.", "description": "More than two thirds of young women say their confidence in politicians has plummeted in the last year, new research has found. The Young Women\u2019s Trust attributed the declining trust\u00a0to the gridlock over Britain\u2019s departure from the EU \u2013 saying women\u2019s issues have been sidelined due to Brexit dominating the\u00a0political agenda.", "authors": ["Maya Oppenheim"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/06/19/19/young-woman-wallet.jpg"}
