They will do it and do it well because my players are the best. I will create something. It is what it is. Football is not how you handle the good situations. It\u2019s how you handle the bad ones. I am ready for the challenge. I like it, I like to live this situation.\u201d\n\nBut Guardiola did not look like a man who enjoys \u2018living this situation\u2019, a day before Manchester City\u2019s Champions League campaign begins at Shakhtar Donetsk. When the summer window closed, centre-half was the only position in which his squad was short. With Stones joining Aymeric Laporte on the sidelines for a significant period of time, that deficiency is now badly exposed. The one thing they did not want to happen has happened, barely a month into the season.\n\nCynics will point out that Stones\u2019s injury breaks up the partnership with Nicolas Otamendi which was widely blamed for Saturday\u2019s 3-2 defeat at Norwich City. Some of that criticism was unfair \u2013 particularly on Stones, who was not at fault for any of Norwich\u2019s three goals \u2013 but Guardiola has not been convinced by the pair together since they shipped four at Anfield in January last year.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nIn terms of scheduling, it has not come at the most inconvenient time either. A relatively kind Champions League draw means Stones will miss home games against Dinamo Zagreb and Atalanta after tonight\u2019s opener at Shakhtar Donetsk. Away days at Everton and Crystal Palace are the most pressing concerns on City\u2019s domestic schedule over the next six weeks. Stones can hope to recover in time for the next top-six encounter \u2013 a trip to Anfield in early November.\n\nAnd when looking back at the last two years of success at the Etihad, serious injuries that force Guardiola to deploy players in unfamiliar positions are a common, unifying denominator. It was Fabian Delph in the Centurions campaign, deployed to good effect at left back in Benjamin Mendy\u2019s absence. Last year, Mendy\u2019s fitness issues allowed Oleksandr Zinchenko to blossom in the same role. It is now Fernandinho\u2019s turn to fill in.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. 22 under 22: The young stars to watch in the 2019/20 Champions League Show all 23 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

He impressed in last year\u2019s Europa League, and combines unpredictability in 1-v-1 situations with a useful end product to make him a daunting prospect to face. Getty Images 3/23 Renan Lodi, Atletico Madrid Replacing Filipe Luis at Atletico Madrid will be a tough task for Renan Lodi, but the Brazilian is Atletico\u2019s only natural left-back and will therefore be integral for Diego Simeone this season. Lodi is a typical marauding Brazilian full-back, and is a keen crosser of the ball which suits Atletico\u2019s style of play. Getty Images 4/23 Eljif Elmas, Napoli The Macedonian is an eager midfielder, to say the least. Elmas distributes the ball well and is usually on the move shortly after, and has displayed a keen appetite for winning the ball back. Signed from Fenerbahce this summer, he has impressed in his short time with Napoli as a player who is always happy to take possession of the ball. Getty Images 5/23 Colin Dagba, PSG PSG are not typically associated with blooding through their own young talent, with many academy prospects often being sold rather than nurtured. Dagba has escaped such a fate, and established himself as first-choice right-back under Thomas Tuchel, keeping three clean sheets in his three starts this season. AFP/Getty Images 6/23 Matthijs de Ligt, Juventus The Dutchman already seems like a generational talent and was immense in Ajax\u2019s run to the semi-finals last year. He will be under a microscope at Juventus, especially with Giorgio Chiellini injured, but has already shown incredible leadership qualities and the ability to bounce back from a rocky debut as he did with the Netherlands. Getty Images 7/23 Ferran Torres, Valencia Valencia\u2019s young winger is a first-team regular, despite being just 19. The Spaniard operates predominantly from the right-hand side of midfield as an old-school type of winger - stay wide, beat a man, cross the ball - but is also comfortable taking up positions across the attacking third. Getty Images 8/23 Lee Kang-in, Valencia To say that the South Korean midfielder has flair would be an understatement. The 18-year-old has been linked with Real Madrid and Manchester City and it is clear why. He has bags of natural ability and is more than capable of playing himself out of a tight spot anywhere on the pitch. The Valencia man also possesses great technique with his left foot, and has featured regularly in their matchday squads this season. Bongarts/Getty Images 9/23 Trent Alexander-Arnold, Liverpool The Englishman\u2019s technical abilities are virtually unparalleled as a full-back, and many argue that he is already the best right-back in the world. In order to ratify such claims, Alexander-Arnold will have to help improve Liverpool\u2019s group stage away record from last year when they lost against PSG, Napoli and Red Star Belgrade, only just qualifying. Liverpool FC via Getty Images 10/23 Vinicius Jr, Real Madrid With Real Madrid\u2019s relatively small and injury hit squad, there is an expectation that Vinicius Jr will get chances to impress, particularly in games against Club Brugge and Galatasaray. The Brazilian has bags of flair and ability, but does need to work on his goal output before he can be considered as a more than a prospect. Getty Images 11/23 Victor Osimhen, Lille The Nigerian striker was signed with some of the fee Lille received for Nicholas Pepe, and looks to be a good investment with five goals in as many games in Ligue 1. Osimhen has shown he can handle the pressure of filling another\u2019s shoes, and will be seeking to impress as Lille\u2019s main man. AFP/Getty Images 12/23 Lisandro Martinez, Ajax One of two defenders signed to replace Matthijs de Ligt, Lisandro Martinez has hit the ground running at Ajax, who themselves will be looking to take advantage of a group without a clear favourite (Chelsea, Valencia, Lille). Martinez\u2019s efforts from the back are sure to be crucial in any Champions League success they have. Getty Images 13/23 Florentino Luis, Benfica Benfica are synonymous with producing talented players, and Florentino Luis appears to be the latest prospect from Lisbon. The midfielder reads the game exceptionally well, and it is not uncommon to see him slide in to intercept a pass. He is a deft tackler, but is not without technique and is more than capable of playing around a pressing opponent AFP/Getty Images 14/23 Reece James, Chelsea After a very successful campaign with Wigan, the Chelsea full-back\u2019s stock seems to have risen substantially this season, despite not playing a game due to injury. Cesar Azpilicueta has not played well and has looked like a player who has played 205 games in four seasons, with James likely to be given minutes in the Champions League in order to give the club captain a much-needed rest. AFP/Getty Images 15/23 Houssem Aouar, Lyon Aouar has a wonderful ability of carrying the ball into the final third, and is also capable of operating in tight spaces in and around the box. The composed midfielder has established himself as one of Lyon\u2019s most important players in recent years, and is another who may move on next season. AFP/Getty Images 16/23 Ibrahima Konate, RB Leipzig The French defender is a towering presence at the heart of the Leipzig defence. With the German club handed a group they should back themselves to qualify from (Lyon, Zenit and Benfica), it is likely we will see Konate test himself in the latter stages of the competition as well. Bongarts/Getty Images 17/23 Ansu Fati, Barcelona Given his performances thus far for Barcelona, it seems inconceivable that Ansu Fati is just 16. The Barcelona shirt does not seem to weigh him down at all - he plays with a freedom and unpredictability that is extremely refreshing and is sure to get him further opportunities to impress this season. Getty Images 18/23 Tete, Shakhtar Donetsk The latest in Shakhtar\u2019s production line of young Brazilians, Tete joined the club from Gremio in February. The skillful winger has impressed in his short time at the club, and is capable of causing real problems from the right-hand side. AFP/Getty Images 19/23 Kai Havertz, Bayer Leverkusen Although he is only 20, Havertz has made over 100 appearances for Bayer Leverkusen. Last season in the Bundesliga he established himself as a goal-scoring midfielder, scoring 17 times. This season\u2019s Champions League campaign is the chance for Havertz to further showcase his ability to Europe\u2019s elite - with the expectation that he will leave Leverkusen at the end of this season. Bongarts/Getty Images 20/23 Mason Mount, Chelsea It is a rarity to see players transition from the Championship to the Premier League so easily, but Mount has taken to the Chelsea first team like a duck to water. The Englishman\u2019s game intelligence is astounding at such a young age, and will suit the demands of Champions League football. AFP/Getty Images 21/23 Dani Olmo, Dinamo Zagreb Dani Olmo starred for Spain at the under 21 Euros during the summer, and surprisingly was not snapped up from Dinamo Zagreb. He moved to Croatia from Barcelona\u2019s La Masia academy back in 2014 and has not looked back, winning the league\u2019s player of the year last season. The attacking midfielder will have plenty of opportunities to impress and potentially qualify, with Zagreb fighting Atalanta and Shakhtar Donetsk for second place behind Manchester City. Getty Images 22/23 Jadon Sancho, Borussia Dortmund Sancho\u2019s talents are well-established but he should not be satisfied with just being a recognised player. This season\u2019s Champions League, when Dortmund face Barcelona and Inter Milan, is the perfect stage for him to show he can cope with the pressure of expectation and be talked about in the elite bracket of players by leading by example. Bongarts/Getty Images 23/23 Joao Felix, Atletico Madrid At the age of just 19, Joao Felix has the weighty expectations of Atletico Madrid fans upon his shoulders. His abilities with the ball are immense, but is another who will be looking to prove that they can make the step up and perform under intense scrutiny.

His abilities with the ball are immense, but is another who will be looking to prove that they can make the step up and perform under intense scrutiny. Getty Images\n\nBut in another sense, the timing is very bad indeed. City\u2019s defence is under greater scrutiny than at any point since Guardiola\u2019s difficult first year in English football. Laporte\u2019s absence deprives them of not only their best defender in a traditional sense, but also the player most adept at starting attacks by bringing the ball out from the back. Stones\u2019s injury, meanwhile, leaves them without their best alternative. The next month or so must now be negotiated carefully.\n\nThere is confidence in Fernandinho\u2019s ability to cover at the heart of the backline, as there should be in a player of his experience and consistency. His baseline defensive statistics from last season compare favourably with essentially any player in the Premier League when City\u2019s dominance of possession is taken into account. He has spent the last two years regularly dropping deep to form a three-man defence when City are in possession further up the field. His positional awareness and reading of the game is well-appreciated, his considerable ability in the air less so.\n\nHe was always likely to do a turn in defence this season. There is every chance that he helps to pull City through this. But the fact that City were prepared for this does not make it a particularly welcome turn of events. Fernandinho is 34-years-old. He has played more than 11,000 club minutes since Guardiola\u2019s arrival three years ago, an extraordinary number for an ageing player. Injuries began to take their toll at the end of last season. There is a reason why he had to be replaced at the base of midfield. Relying on him in the very last line of defence, which is now a perceived weak spot that opponents will target, could easily backfire.\n\nAnd perhaps more worryingly still, City have limited scope for reinforcements. The club registered the maximum of 17 non-homegrown players in their Premier League squad this summer, meaning there must be a one-in one-out policy on practically any overseas signing come January. Of those 17 players, only Claudio Bravo can really be considered dispensable. Allowing Leroy San\u00e9 to join Bayern Munich free up both a non-homegrown slot and funds for a club which is particularly conscious of complying with Financial Fair Play regulations, but San\u00e9\u2019s own long-term injury complicates matters.\n\nAs Guardiola advised journalists last Friday, any January signing looks unlikely. He is going to have to mend and make do, and at least it is not new territory for him or his players. \u201cThis team has done it in the past,\u201d he reminded everyone on Tuesday, harking back to those Delph and Zinchenko makeshift solutions, before taking on a more defiant tone.\n\n\u201cWhen we won the last two seasons seven titles, nobody gave us anything. We won for ourselves and we are going to do it again. The perfect ideal situation does not exist, it\u2019s how you approach these ones.\u201d He is ready for the challenge, he says. It could prove to be a significant, perhaps even season-defining one.", "description": "\u201cNo problem,\u201d Pep Guardiola said somewhat unconvincingly on Tuesday, having delivered the news that John Stones will be sidelined for up to six weeks with a muscular injury. \u201cIt\u2019s a challenge.
