But the move is sure to renew a nagging question: Can central banks do much good when rates are already ultra-low?\n\nAnalysts say the bank is likely to cut a key interest rate further below zero on Thursday and could take other steps, including restarting a bond-buying program to pump newly created money into the economy.\n\nThat could help the economy by making money cheaper to borrow, a policy that U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly pushed the U.S. Federal Reserve to emulate. Yet some officials question how much good another large blast of stimulus will do.\n\nThe possible stimulus has raised uncertainty about exactly how big a package might be decided at the gathering of the ECB\u2019s 25-member governing council. It will be President Mario Draghi\u2019s next-to-last meeting after an eight-year term as head of the monetary authority for the 19 countries that use the euro.\n\nDraghi gave clear hints in a June speech and after the bank\u2019s last meeting, on July 25, that more action was on the way to counter the slowdown in economic growth, which has been blamed in large part on the U.S.-China trade dispute.\n\nAnalysts think the ECB will at least cut the rate on deposits that it takes from commercial banks from a current minus 0.4% to minus 0.5% or even minus 0.6%. The unusual negative rate \u2014 in effect a penalty aimed at pushing banks to lend spare cash rather than let it pile up overnight at the central bank \u2014 suggests how stretched monetary policy has become in the wake of the Great Recession.\n\nBeyond that, the ECB\u2019s governing council could extend its current promise not to raise rates before mid-2020.\n\nAnd it could decide to resume bond purchases that were stopped in December before economic data took a turn for the worse. Florian Hense, an analyst from Berenberg Bank, said the ECB could purchase 30 billion euros ($33 billion) in government and corporate bonds a month for at least 12 months.\n\nThe bank purchased 2.6 trillion in bonds ($2.9 trillion) over almost four years, a step that drives up bond prices and drives down interest yields, since prices and yields move in opposite direction. Anticipation of more purchases has driven government bond yields across Europe below zero, meaning governments get paid to borrow and investors are willing to pay for a safe place to stash their money.\n\nThe Fed is also moving in the direction of more stimulus, though Trump would like it to cut rates faster and has praised the ECB\u2019s negative rates. The Fed cut its key policy rate in July for the first time in a decade, to a new range of 2% to 2.25%. Markets believe there is a near certainty the Fed will cut rates for a second time at its next meeting Sept. 17-18.\n\nTrump on Wednesday tweeted about the benefits in his view of negative interest rates, calling the U.S. Federal Reserve \u201cBoneheads\u201d for not pushing U.S. rates down to \u201cZERO or less.\u201d\n\nThere are doubts, however, about how much monetary policy can do.\n\nAmong the big issues hurting business confidence are political standoffs such as the trade war and Britain\u2019s uncertain exit from the European Union. Credit is already cheap and abundant for governments and companies with good credit ratings. And low rates can have side effects, such as eroding bank profits and inflating the prices of riskier assets such as stocks.\n\nECB governing council member Klaas Knot, head of the Dutch central bank, has said the economy isn\u2019t weak enough to warrant bond purchases. Another member, Sabine Lautenschlaeger of Germany, has said she opposes re-starting bond purchases.\n\nPrivate economists took strong issue with Trump\u2019s contention that negative rates would be good for the United States.\n\n\u201cNegative interest rates are totally destructive to savings and investment,\u201d said economist David Jones, the author of four books on the Federal Reserve. \u201cMoney is flowing out of countries that have negative rates.\u201d\n\nJones said rates that are near zero or actually negative in many European countries and Japan are a big reason that U.S. long-term rates are so low, as foreign investors search for better returns in the United States.\n\nAs central banks are stretched, the discussion has turned to government spending policy as a way to support growth.\n\nDraghi\u2019s designated successor, Christine Lagarde, said during her nomination hearing last month that fiscal policies \u201cneed to be available to stabilize our economies through downturns and avoid overburdening monetary policies.\u201d She urged governments to make pro-business reforms and spend on growth-friendly investment where possible.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a fairy,\u201d she said, adding that \u201ccentral banks are not the only game in town.\u201d\n\nLagarde, who resigned as head of the International Monetary Fund effective Friday after being nominated for the ECB presidency by European governments, will take over from Draghi on Nov. 1.\n\nDraghi has also urged governments that are in good financial shape to spend more on projects that would help growth, but has largely been ignored. Germany, the eurozone\u2019s biggest member, continues to run budget surpluses despite urging from the IMF to spend more on infrastructure such as extending high-speed internet to all areas of the country.\n\nThe eurozone economy grew a modest 0.2% in the second quarter while Germany shrank 0.1% and could fall into a technical recession, defined as two quarters of contraction, if it drops again in the third quarter.\n\n___\n\nCrutsinger contributed from Washington.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The European Central Bank appears to be preparing a new shot of stimulus to try to energize the economy.
