Legitimate investigations into his behavior become plots against the state. An impeachment inquiry isn\u2019t so much a constitutional process for determining whether a president violated the oath of office as a coup\u2014a crime against country.\n\nAs Trump tries to preserve his presidency, he\u2019s talking in just these grandiose terms, erasing the distinction between country and self, and grooming his base to see things the same way. That sort of thinking could ultimately portend a crisis, if Trump\u2019s actions in the months ahead mirror his rhetoric. If Trump thinks of himself as the state, would he leave office were the Senate to convict him in an impeachment trial, or were he to lose the 2020 election? Or would he count on an embittered electoral coalition to rise up and repudiate the verdict?", "description": "Matthew Teague, \"Double Blind\"; James Bamford, \"Big Brother Is Listening\"; Robert D.
