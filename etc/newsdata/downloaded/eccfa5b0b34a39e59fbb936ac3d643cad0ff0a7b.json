REUTERS/Philimon Bulawayo\n\nOver the next two years, human rights groups estimate as many as 20,000 people died in western Zimbabwe, most of them ethnic Ndebele. The indiscriminate purge came to be known in the Shona language as Gukurahundi: \u201cthe early rain that washes away the chaff\u201d. Zimbabwe\u2019s opposition called it genocide.\n\nDecades on, even after seizures of white-owned farms that triggered economic collapse, and campaigns of political violence that garnered far more international attention, it remains the darkest era in the nearly four-decade rule of Mugabe, who died on Friday at 95.\n\nMany of the victims were executed, often after being forced to dig their own graves. Others were thrown down wells or disused mine shafts.\n\nRape, torture, mass beatings and wholesale destruction of villages were also commonplace, according to \u201cBreaking the Silence\u201d, a seminal 1997 report on the episode by the Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace.\n\nThe killings met with muted international condemnation at the time, although researchers now say behind-the-scenes diplomatic pressure did lead to a reduction in the violence.\n\nMany Africans contrast the lack of global outrage to the chorus of international condemnation of the 2000 invasions of white-owned farms.\n\nMugabe\u2019s administration consistently denied reports of mass killings, presenting them as fabrications of hostile Western media.\n\nHowever, after Nkomo\u2019s death in 1999, Mugabe referred to the massacres as a \u201cmoment of madness\u201d. In a 2015 interview with a South African talk-show host, he acknowledged that the episode was \u201cvery bad\u201d but blamed it on renegade soldiers.\n\n\u201cSometimes they go out of their way, you see, to hurt and commit acts which are outrageous,\u201d Mugabe said in the interview. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to talk about that, but it has a story which has not been told in full.\u201d\n\nAccording to Australian researcher Stuart Doran, recently declassified diplomatic cables show that Mugabe knew of the mass killings, with one minister reported to have said in 1983 that the Fifth Brigade was acting \u201cunder Mugabe\u2019s explicit orders\u201d.\n\nPresident Emmerson Mnangagwa, who was Mugabe\u2019s security minister at the time and took over when Mugabe was ousted in 2017, has said Zimbabweans should speak more freely about Gukurahundi, to bring about national healing.", "description": "Just three years after Zimbabwe's independence from Britain, Robert Mugabe sent the army's North Korean-trained Fifth Brigade into Matabeleland to crush dissidents and former guerrillas loyal to liberation war rival Joshua Nkomo.", "authors": ["Macdonald Dzirutwe", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190906&t=2&i=1426876778&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF850XA", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
