The government has repeatedly said it is not prepared to significantly boost spending to revive growth and inflation.\n\nCiti\u2019s Josh Williamson said \u201cearly evidence\u201d indicated that household saving would continue to outstrip spending amid ongoing low wages growth, rising income taxes and falling consumer sentiment.\n\nHe also cited an increase in global downside risks for bringing forward his rate cut call, noting a recent jump in oil prices could temper household spending while slower growth in China was a major overhang for Australia\u2019s export-heavy economy.", "description": "National Australia Bank economists on Friday became the latest to join a growing pool of analysts predicting a third interest rate cut by the country's central bank in October, citing slowing economic growth and a smaller chance of fiscal support.", "authors": ["Swati Pandey", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
