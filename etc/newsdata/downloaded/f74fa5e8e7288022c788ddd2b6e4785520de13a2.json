By 1987, the firm had seven outlets.\n\nA wider company - Hays Travel Independence Group - was then formed in 1995, and the firm introduced homeworking in 1997.\n\nIt recently moved into brand new headquarters in Sunderland, and now operates from 190 of its own branches across the UK.\n\nOn Wednesday, little over two weeks after the collapse of Thomas Cook, Hays Travel announced plans to acquire a total of 555 Thomas Cook stores around the UK, providing re-employment opportunities for around 600 former Thomas Cook workers.\n\nThe company has already hired 421 Thomas Cook employees and has made further offers to dozens more.\n\n(Image: Evening Gazette)\n\nDavid Chapman, Official Receiver, said: \"I am pleased to announce we have reached an agreement with Hays Travel to acquire Thomas Cook\u2019s entire UK retail estate, comprising 555 stores across the country. This represents an important step in the liquidation process, as we seek to realise the company\u2019s assets.\"\n\nJim Tucker, at KPMG and Joint Special Manager of Thomas Cook\u2019s Retail division, said: \"This is an extremely positive outcome, and we are delighted to have secured this agreement. It provides re-employment opportunities for a significant number of former Thomas Cook employees, and secures the future of retail sites up and down the UK high street.\n\n\"We are pleased to have achieved this in a short time frame and in the context of a complex liquidation process, which is testament to a lot of hard work from a number of parties.\n\n\"Over the weeks ahead, we will work closely with Hays Travel and landlords to ensure a smooth transition of the store estate.\"\n\nJohn and Irene Hays, Managing Director and Group Chair of Hays Travel Limited, said: \"Thomas Cook was a much-loved brand employing talented people. We look forward to working with many of them.\"\n\nTSSA General Secretary, Manuel Cortes, hailed the deal that will save hundreds of jobs.\n\n\"This is very welcome news offering real hope of reemployment to former Thomas Cook retail staff, many of whom are our members,\" he said.\n\n\u201cWe have been clear from the start that Thomas Cook was a strong brand and that it was likely parts of the business would be able to move forward as a going concern.\n\n\u201cThroughout the industry the talent, commitment and skills of our members working for Thomas Cook was well known and I have no doubt they will bring the same dedication to Hays.\n\n\u201cWe will now move swiftly to gather more details about the deal and are seeking an urgent meeting with Hays about the part our union can play in supporting what will be a significant expansion for them across our high streets.\u201d", "description": "Founder John Hays was awarded the Freedom of the City award by Sunderland Council in 2016 - shortly after, he gave every staff member a \u00a3100 bonus for each year of service with the company", "authors": ["Emma Munbodh", "Image", "North News", "Pictures Northn", "Newcastle Journal", "Evening Gazette"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20546819.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_NNP-THOMAS_COOK_BUYOUT_13.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
