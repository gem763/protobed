The department said in a news release that the trip did \u201cnot represent a re-start of the Afghan Peace Process.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn addition to their reported visit to Pakistan, Taliban representatives have made similar official visits to Russia, China and Iran.\n\nBefore talks were called off last month, they were aimed at reaching a peace deal that would allow the United States to withdraw American forces from Afghanistan in exchange for a pledge from Taliban leadership to cut ties with al-Qaeda and support counterterrorism efforts. Khalilzad\u2019s team and Taliban leaders had negotiated for more than 10 months, and Khalilzad said in early September that a deal had been reached \u201cin principle.\u201d\n\nAn announcement of a peace deal appeared to be imminent until Trump abruptly scuttled talks on Sept. 7. Trump said the decision was made after a Taliban attack that resulted in the death of an American service member on Sept. 5.\n\nAD\n\nBut in the days that followed, officials in Kabul and Washington cautioned that talks were likely on hold rather than entirely scrapped. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared to signal as much when he told Fox News in a Sept. 8 interview that the negotiations were off \u201cfor the time being.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nKhalilzad arrived in Pakistan earlier this week, and Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid announced Wednesday that a delegation led by Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar would also travel to Pakistan. Baradar is a co-founder of the Taliban movement and was a lead negotiator throughout talks with Khalilzad.\n\nVideo released by Pakistan\u2019s Foreign Ministry showed Taliban leaders embracing ministry officials as they arrived in Islamabad for meetings. Pakistan has repeatedly urged both sides to resume peace talks, and the Taliban has said it remains open to talks with the United States.\n\nAD\n\nMujahid, the Taliban spokesman, said in a statement Wednesday that the \u201cagenda for discussions\u201d with Pakistani officials included \u201cissues of restoration of peace and security in the region.\u201d The statement made no mention of talks with Americans.\n\nAD\n\nA State Department spokesperson said Wednesday that Khalilzad was in Pakistan \u201cfor consultations with authorities in Pakistan\u201d to follow up on discussions held between Trump and Prime Minister Imran Khan at the U.N. General Assembly last week. The spokesperson was not authorized to discuss the trip on the record and released the statement on the condition of anonymity.\n\nAfter meeting with Taliban leaders Thursday, Pakistan\u2019s Foreign Ministry said Islamabad and the Taliban \u201cagreed on the need for . . . resumption of the peace process.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIt is \u201ctime to make all possible efforts for an early, peaceful resolution of the conflict in Afghanistan,\u201d the Foreign Ministry said in a statement. The statement also warned that \u201cbroad regional and international consensus for achieving peace in Afghanistan . . . provided an unprecedented opportunity that must not be lost.\u201d\n\nShaiq Hussain in Islamabad and Sayed Salahuddin in Kabul contributed to this report.\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news\n\nAD", "description": "For the first time since President Trump declared peace talks\u00a0\u201cdead,\u201d a U.S. envoy has met with Taliban leadership in Pakistan, two people familiar with the matter said.", "authors": ["Susannah George", "Foreign Reporter Covering Afghanistan"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/WcJqrV7KQAbpG2lcB8UIA58P2SE=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GHEDBMXGTQI6TJXIQ5M4LR7WBA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
