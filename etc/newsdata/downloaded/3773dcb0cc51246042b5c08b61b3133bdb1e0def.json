They'll be thinking, 'We can go and do a good game'.\n\n'Sometimes we don't win but when we do it is because we do something good.\n\n'We have to try it against a team we know quite well. We have played many times against Nuno Espirito Santo's team in Carabao Cups and leagues and other stuff.'\n\nGuardiola insists his side's excellent form at the Etihad Stadium is down to their own hard work\n\nGuardiola is proud of his side's home record and feels that has underpinned their title successes of the past two seasons.\n\nHe said: 'In some moments you need luck to win games, to make a lot of points, win titles.\n\n'But we have effort and very good things, so I'm proud of the the effort and the way we have done it.\n\n'Our first season (at City) was not consistent. We had problems. I didn't expect it when I landed here. I thought at home we would be strong and away tough but it was completely the opposite in the first season.\n\n'But since then, the second season and third season and this season as well, we have been strong at home. To try to win titles you have to be strong at home or you have no chance.'\n\nGuardiola believes his side's formidable home form was key in securing back-to-back titles\n\nFernandinho is set to continue in central defence for City alongside Nicolas Otamendi, with John Stones and Aymeric Laporte still out injured.\n\nIt will be the 34-year-old Brazil midfielder's third game in just over a week, but Guardiola is confident he can handle it.\n\nHe said: 'He didn't have many minutes in his legs before these three games. Except the last part of last season - in the previous seasons - he's played every three days over 11 months. So I think he can do it.'", "description": "Pep Guardiola has denied teams are intimidated by facing his Manchester City side at the Etihad Stadium, despite their record of having won 39 of their last 44 Premier League home games.", "authors": ["Andy Hampson", "Press Association Sport"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/05/10/19328954-0-image-a-9_1570268948161.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
