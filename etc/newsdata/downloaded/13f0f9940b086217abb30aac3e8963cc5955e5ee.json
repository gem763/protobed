Valuations are high, global growth is slow, and President Donald Trump's trade war with China has brought elevated volatility to stocks. Meanwhile, bonds, the only sensible alternative, are at near-record high prices and thus offer puny yields.\n\nWhat's an investor to do? One partial remedy is to increase your investment in health care stocks.\n\nHealth care, which comprises more than 15% of Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, is the only broad market sector that can hold its own in both bull and bear markets. Although, no question, its best performance relative to the overall stock market comes during selloffs. In 2018, for instance, while the S&P 500 retreated by 4.6% on a total-return basis (price plus dividends), the health care sector gained 5.6%.\n\nWhich would you rather have: a shiny new BMW or your health? To ask the question is to answer it. If you're really sick, you'll do whatever it takes to recover, no matter the cost. You'll skip the new car, if necessary. Demand for health care is virtually inelastic. What's more, as baby boomers age, they're requiring more medical care. Simultaneously, breakthrough advances in the treatments of diseases - often expensive treatment - continue at a rapid clip.\n\nBelow are my six best health care funds, in no particular order.\n\nSEE ALSO: The 19 Best ETFs for a Prosperous 2019\n\nFidelity MSCI Health Care ETF and Vanguard Health Care ETF\n\n\n\n\n\nDividend yield: 2.1% (FHLC), 2.1% (VHT)\n\nExpenses: 0.08% (FHLC), 0.10% (VHT)\n\n3-year return: 9.9% (FHLC), 9.9% (VHT)\n\n5-year return: 9.2% (FHLC), 9.3% (VHT)\n\nConservative investors will appreciate these two virtually identical, broad-based, health care funds: Fidelity MSCI Health Care ETF (FHLC, $43.60) and Vanguard Health Care (VHT, $168.46).\n\nBoth cheap index funds cover the entire health care waterfront. They each have 28% of assets in pharmaceutical companies, roughly a quarter in health care equipment and 19% in biotechnology. The rest of each fund's assets is distributed among managed care (including health insurance companies), life sciences tools, and health care services, supplies and facilities.\n\nThe funds track MSCI health care indexes - market-capitalization-weighted benchmarks of U.S. health care stocks. Consequently, they're both dominated by the industry's giants. Top holdings include the likes of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), UnitedHealth (UNH), Merck (MRK), Pfizer (PFE) and Abbott Laboratories (ABT).\n\nThe weight in mega-cap pharmaceutical stocks limits both the upside and downside of these health care funds. The big pharma companies still develop some innovative therapies. But mainly they either buy up or partner with small biotechnology companies that invent most of the breakthrough medical treatments nowadays.\n\nFor many investors, broad-based funds such as these will work better than a more aggressive product. You won't get the huge gains that you can in biotech, but you're unlikely to get killed in a market downturn either.\n\nThe primary difference between the two: Vanguard's ETF charges 0.1% in annual fees while Fidelity's charges 0.08%. Big whoop. On a $10,000 investment, the two-basis-point difference (a basis point is one one-hundredth of a percent) comes to a puny $20 per year. On the flip side, the Vanguard fund actually has slightly outperformed Fidelity's over the past five years.\n\nSPDR S&P Biotech ETF\n\n\n\n\n\nDividend yield: 0.1%\n\nExpenses: 0.35%\n\n3-year return: 9.8%\n\n5-year return: 8.8%\n\nIf broad health care funds such as the two above are relatively conservative, biotechnology stocks are among the most volatile equities you can find. SPDR S&P Biotech ETF (XBI, $79.17), another index ETF, is more than twice as volatile as the S&P. Indeed, it lost 15.3% in 2018, or more than thrice the S&P's deficit.\n\nBiotech is an industry that has lots of strikeouts - and a few home runs.\n\nAlex Bryan, a senior analyst at Morningstar, nevertheless likes this ETF for people who want to invest a portion of their money in biotech. That's primarily because the fund invests in 119 different stocks, and the largest holding - Genomic Health (GHDX) - is a mere 2.2% of the fund's total assets, thanks to XBI's \"modified\" equal weighting.", "description": "Let's face it: The stock market is infuriating.
