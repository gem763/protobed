REUTERS/Sumaya Hisham/File Photo\n\nThe Botswana Democratic Party, in power since independence day, faces an unusually tough parliamentary vote, after the country\u2019s former president and political heavyweight Ian Khama fell out bitterly with his hand-picked successor, President Mokgweetsi Masisi, earlier this year.\n\nThere is no clear winner in sight and little to distinguish the contestants on policy. But whichever party wins will inherit the unenviable task of tackling high unemployment, inequality and over-reliance on dwindling diamonds, which turned Botswana into one of Africa\u2019s wealthiest nations but cannot lift living standards forever.\n\nKhama, the son of founding president Seretse Khama, has thrown his weight behind an opposition coalition led by human rights lawyer Duma Boko. The outcome of Wednesday\u2019s vote will also determine who becomes president.\n\n\u201cWe are putting an end to this misrule by the BDP. We want our people to be more empowered and to enjoy more of this country\u2019s economic opportunities,\u201d Boko told a news conference on Thursday, promising to create 100,000 jobs, raise the minimum wage and grow the economy by more than 6 percent a year.\n\nSince freeing itself of its former colonizer, Botswana has bucked the trend on a continent often beset by post-independence civil conflict, autocratic leadership, and the squandering of natural resources by elites.\n\nIt has enjoyed peaceful, regular elections, and its vast diamond wealth, instead of fuelling war and rampant state theft, has been judiciously spent on free education and health.\n\nThe result: after decades of growth averaging 8 percent a year, per capital Gross Domestic Product is more than $8,000 \u2014 eight times that of Zimbabwe, five times Zambia, and about two thirds more than Namibia, its neighbors.\n\nBut clouds are gathering. Botswana\u2019s diamond sales fell 16% in the second quarter of 2019, and a partnership between Anglo American\u2019s De Beers and Botswana reported that production fell by 9% to 5.7 million carats in the second quarter.\n\nLOSING THEIR SHINE\n\nGDP growth is projected to slow to 4.3% in 2019, from 4.5% last year, and the economy remains vulnerable to swings in diamond prices and output.\n\nBotswana\u2019s 2019/20 fiscal deficit is predicted to be 3.8% of GDP, up from an earlier forecast of 3.5%, as revenue growth slows against accelerating spending.\n\nAlthough the country has diversified sources of economic growth with mining\u2019s contribution to GDP falling from about half in the 1990s to a fifth in 2018, exports are still precariously diamond-dominated, at 75 percent of foreign exchange earnings.\n\nBanking and tourism are stepping in to fill the gap, but they have failed to generate enough jobs, with unemployment at 20 percent.\n\nFaced with these challenges, there is little difference between the policies of any of the four candidates.\n\n\u201cWe want to create more jobs that are sustainable, improve the quality of our education to make youths job-ready and competitive as a well as give you better healthcare,\u201d Masisi said during a presidential debate held this week.\n\nThe original quarrel between Masisi and Khama concerned something Botswana has excelled at: preserving its elephants, even as they have come into conflict with its mushrooming human population.\n\nAnswering a call from farmers angry at having their crops ripped up by hungry elephants, Masisi in May reversed a 4-year-old hunting ban put in place by Khama, a keen conservationist.\n\nEven if Khama\u2019s candidate wins, though, it is unlikely the hunting ban would be restored: Boko supports lifting and says it should never have been introduced.\n\nMasisi enjoys a solid record and is popular with business. Wednesday\u2019s poll will test whether that is enough for him to keep the job.", "description": "For the first time since it won independence from Britain in 1966, Botswana faces a genuine electoral contest on Wednesday, as a feud between its current and a former president throws one of Africa's most stable nations into uncertainty.", "authors": ["Brian Benza", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191021&t=2&i=1443322998&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9K0RS", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
