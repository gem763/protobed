It was flat around 99.093 against a basket of major currencies.\n\n\"The timing of the U.S. travel bans and company blacklists associated with human rights issues have not helped to maintain a positive backdrop to these trade negotiations,\" said Rob Carnell, ING's chief economist for Asia-Pacific.\n\n\"They also look likely to provoke some retaliation from China, just a day before Vice Premier Liu He is due to arrive in Washington for trade talks,\" he said.\n\nLiu and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are due to meet on Thursday.\n\nA Chinese diplomat told Reuters that China wanted a deal.\n\nBut prospects for progress appear to be dimming as the dispute widens.\n\nOn top of the visa restrictions and corporate blacklistings, the Trump administration is also moving ahead with discussions around restrictions on capital flows into China, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter.\n\n\"The tensions will persist through to the year-end at least,\" said Westpac analyst Imre Speizer in Auckland, who is not expecting the talks to deliver a breakthrough deal.\n\n\"It'll be volatile good news, bad news, repeat for the rest of the year, but overall a negative tone.\"\n\nThe , the most sensitive currency to the trade talks, had dropped to a one-month low in offshore trade overnight, but was a little stronger at 7.1434 per dollar in onshore trade on Wednesday.\n\nThe Australian and New Zealand dollars ticked higher, with the rising 0.2% to $0.6741 and the 0.3% to $0.6312.\n\nSterling languished at $1.2214, close to its lowest since early September, on reports that talks between Britain and the European Union were close to breaking down without an exit deal.\n\nIn a telephone call on Tuesday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel told British Prime Minister Boris Johnson that a deal was \"overwhelmingly unlikely,\" a Downing Street source said.\n\nThe Times newspaper reported Johnson also faces a fresh rebellion in cabinet, with a group of ministers poised to quit due to concerns he is leading the country into a no-deal exit.\n\nThat leaves the outcome on Oct. 31, when Britain is due to quit the EU, deeply uncertain.\n\n\"The ever-fluid Brexit saga is expected to leave the pound exposed to politically-driven bouts of volatility over the coming weeks,\" said FXTM analyst Han Tan.", "description": "Dollar steadies as trade deal hopes fade, pound soft", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9806V_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
