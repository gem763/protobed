Warm Home Discount\n\nWhat is it? The Warm Home Discount is a support scheme aimed at households who may struggle to pay their energy bills.\n\nThe scheme was introduced by Government on April 1, 2011 and will run until 2021.\n\nIt's a one-off \u00a3140 discount on your energy bill over winter - but instead of being paid directly to you, it's automatically deducted from your bill over the winter months (between September and March).\n\nYou may also receive it as an energy rebate - all payments for last winter were paid by March 31, 2018. It's usually paid by Spring the following year, ie April 2020 for this coming winter.\n\nHow much? \u00a3140\n\nAvailable in: England, Scotland, Wales\n\nWho can claim? Low-income households; those on qualifying benefits\n\nDeadline to apply: Applications open until March 31, 2021\n\nFind out more on the Warm Home Discount, here.\n\n2. Cold Weather Payments\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nWhat is it? Cold Weather Payments are paid out by the Government during times of especially freezing weather.\n\nThe money goes to people on low incomes who receive a qualifying benefit, such as pension credit or certain employment benefits, when temperatures sink to below 0\u00b0C in the area they live in.\n\nPayments are triggered by data collected by the Met Office from 94 weather stations around Britain.\n\nThe scheme runs each year from November 1 to March 31.\n\nIf you do qualify, you'll get a \u00a325 a week payment for every seven-day spell of cold weather you experience.\n\nThe money is paid to the recipient within 14 days.\n\nHow much? \u00a325 a week\n\nAvailable in: England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland\n\nWho can claim? Low-income households; qualifying benefits when temperature falls to 0\u00b0c or below for seven days in a row.\n\nDeadline to apply: October 1, 2019 - March 31, 2020\n\nFind out more on Cold Weather Payments, here.\n\n3. Winter Fuel Payment\n\nWhat is it? The winter fuel allowance is a scheme designed to support vulnerable people over the colder months.\n\nIt was introduced around 20 years ago to help older people who were being forced to choose between eating and heating - it's a universal entitlement, and automatically paid to anyone who qualifies over the age of 64.\n\nThe scheme covers the period between November and December each year - those eligible should get their money by 14 January in the winter they're claiming it. It's paid directly into your bank account.\n\nHow much? \u00a3100-\u00a3300\n\nAvailable in: England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland\n\nWho can claim? Anyone born before April 5, 1954\n\nDeadline to apply: Applications open until March 31, 2020\n\nFind out more on the Winter Fuel Payment, here.\n\n4. Energy Company Obligation Three\n\nWhat is it? The Energy Company Obligation (ECO) is an initiative that energy suppliers must follow to help households cut their energy bills and reduce carbon emissions by installing energy-saving measures.\n\nBy last September, the Government said it had delivered over 2.4million measures in around 1.9million homes.\n\nThe idea is to help reduced bills in the long term for low income, vulnerable and fuel poor households.\n\nIt also includes supporting households that have a broken heating system by allowing the equivalent of 35,000 broken heating systems to be replaced per year.\n\nHow much? \u00a31,000+ off home improvements\n\nAvailable in: England, Scotland, Wales\n\nWho can claim? Supplier dependent and based on your home's efficiency rating\n\nDeadline to apply: Applications open until 31/03/22\n\nFind out more here.\n\n5. Nest Fuel Poverty\n\nWhat is it? Welsh Government Warm Homes, which includes the Arbed and Nest schemes, provides funding for energy efficiency improvements to low income households and those living in deprived communities across Wales.\n\nHomes are assessed individually to determine which energy efficiency measures are needed and will be most effective (ie insulation, draught proofing and boiler replacement). The energy saving measures will be implemented by British Gas who is the Nest partner for the scheme.\n\nAll households are able to receive a minimum 40% grant towards the cost of installing loft and/or cavity wall insulation. Some homes can receive a 100% grant.\n\nHow much? \u00a3408 a year (on average)\n\nAvailable in: Wales\n\nWho can claim? Means tested - based on health conditions. The domestic property must have an energy efficiency rating of F or G (poor energy efficiency).\n\nFind out more on the Next Fuel Poverty scheme, here.\n\n6. Warmer Homes Scotland\n\nWhat is it? Warmer Homes Scotland is designed to help vulnerable people make their homes warmer and more comfortable by installing a range of energy-saving measures.\n\nLast year the Government said over 14,000 households had received energy-saving changes through the scheme - effectively reducing their bills. Most have received measures valued at over \u00a34,000.\n\nAs well as a warmer house, experts say those who have qualified for the scheme have saved an average of \u00a3326 a year on their energy bills.\n\nHow much? \u00a3350 a year (on average)\n\nAvailable in: Scotland\n\nWho can claim? Homeowners and private sector tenants struggling to heat their home, who have lived in their property for at least 12 months, and who meet the qualifying criteria.\n\nFind out more on Warmer Homes Scotland, here.\n\n\"As the mercury drops, we can be certain that one thing will rise,\" Alex Dickson at Switchcraft said.\n\n\"Long showers, cranked thermostats and electric blankets beckon higher energy-bills. Some consumers might not be aware that the typical UK household spends more than half of its total billings on heating \u2013 even before things get chilly.\n\n\"And if you\u2019re one of the 15million energy customers sitting on a default energy tariff this winter, expect to be forking out hundreds in unnecessary payments.\"\n\n\"Forget the price-cap, forget extra blankets and forget hotties. If your home is on a 'default' or 'standard variable' tariff this winter, the single biggest contributor to energy bills won\u2019t be heating, it\u2019ll be your supplier.\n\n\"That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to shop around for an energy deal.\"\n\nHere's what you need to know about finding a better energy deal.", "description": "From the Warm Home Discount to Cold Weather Payments for when the big chill hits, here's what you need to know", "authors": ["Emma Munbodh", "Image", "Cultura Rf", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article12102705.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/Girl-warmly-wrapped-up-in-woollen-hat-and-scarf.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
