However, in preparation they are looking for accounts that are more accessible and will give them increased flexibility in the lead up to October 31.\n\n'The market is also seeing many savers take money out of investments, moving it across into savings, which can help explain the increased deposits in easy access accounts.'\n\nAccording to the latest figures from UK Finance, which cover mainly the bigger banks, savers have actually pulled money out of fixed-rate deposits over the last 12 months, despite the overall size of household deposits increasing\n\nHow savers have bumped easy access deposits over the last year... Value of household easy access deposits August 2018 Value of household easy access deposits August 2019 Percentage change \u00a3732,653,000,000 \u00a3759,530,000,000 3.6% Source: Bank of England\n\nWider economic uncertainty has also weighed on the money markets and impacted on swap rates, a measure of money market funding used as a pricing mechanism for savings and mortgage products.\n\nThis has narrowed the gap between fixed-rate and easy access products, with longer-term fixed-rates especially affected.\n\nAccording to figures from Moneyfacts, the average one year fixed-rate deposit in August last year paid 1.32 per cent while the average longer-term deposit paid 1.82 per cent.\n\nBy August 2019, the average one year fixed-rate paid 0.05 per cent more but the average longer-term deposit paid 0.10 per cent less.\n\n...And how fixed-rates have lagged behind Value of household fixed-rate deposits August 2018 Value of household fixed-rate deposits August 2019 Percentage change \u00a3163,923,000,000 \u00a3166,749,000,000 1.7% Source: Bank of England\n\nThis means that at a time when savers may be less inclined to tie up their money for longer, there is less of a financial incentive for them to do so.\n\nOne provider told This is Money they had boosted the number of easy access products on offer due to increased customer demand for short-term access to their savings.\n\nMeanwhile in some instances, easy access products may pay a higher rate of interest than fixed-rate products from the same savings provider.\n\nJames Blower, founder of the website The Savings Guru, noted: 'The best easy access rates are 1.45 per cent and the best one year is just 0.35 percentage points extra if you discount the Sharia banks.\n\n'Even locking money away for five years only gets savers a 0.75 per cent uplift with the 2.20 per cent available from Paragon Bank.'\n\nAnna Bowes, co-founder of Savings Champion, added: 'At the moment I think a combination of falling rates over the very recent past is to blame, plus uncertainty. People are unsure of what's going to happen so are probably more reluctant to tie their money up.'\n\nThe 12 months between August 2018 and 2019 also saw the arrival of Marcus Bank, which boosted the easy access market with a rate of 1.5 per cent. Between September 2018 and May 2019, it took in \u00a38billion in customer deposits and signed up a quarter of a million customers.\n\nThe financial firepower that Marcus, backed by Goldman Sachs, could bring to bear also helped drag rates up as it could afford to sit at the top of the best buy tables for such a long period of time, with others falling in behind it.\n\nNow it has cut its easy access rate to 1.45 per cent, others have also followed suit.\n\nBlower added: 'The big banks are awash with cash in poor paying accounts and are fighting a mortgage price war with that, which is keeping savings rates down.\n\n'The smaller banks can afford to pay more for deposits but simply can't cope with the volume it attracts. Most are looking for a few hundred million pounds of savings each year in a market totalling \u00a31.5trillion.\n\n'This is why many of them have to pull products if they find themselves at the top of the best buy tables. By doing that, the next placed has to follow suit and what we are seeing is a domino effect of providers pulling rates at the moment.'\n\nWhile the trend has been particularly pronounced over the last year, especially in the case of customers of the big banks pulling money out of fixed-rates and keeping their cash close, Anna Bowes said it is not entirely new.\n\nShe said: 'Before Funding for Lending was introduced in July 2012, just 60 per cent of the market was in easy access. Now it's 82 per cent, a huge change.\n\n'That said, the fixed-rate bond and Isa tables are the most popular on our website, so there is a great amount of interest in them.'\n\nFunding for Lending was a Government scheme which let big banks borrow from the Bank of England at low rates with the aim of getting more money flowing to mortgage borrowers and businesses.\n\nThis had a negative impact on savings rates as it meant banks no longer had to offer competitive rates to consumers in order to attract deposits.\n\n'Initially perhaps, savers were simply waiting for rates to improve after they started dropping heavily due to FLS, although unfortunately they just continued to fall', Bowes said.\n\n'The shame is that the average rate on an easy access account is just 0.55 per cent and the high street banks, who will probably hold much of this cash, are paying some of the worst rates.\n\n'So savers are missing out while they wait and hope for things to improve.'", "description": "An extra \u00a327billion went into easy access savings accounts, but while that may sound like a huge sum it only works out at about \u00a3515 per adult in the UK.", "authors": ["George Nixon For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
