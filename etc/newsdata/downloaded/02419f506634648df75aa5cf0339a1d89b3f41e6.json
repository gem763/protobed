In it, Goss appears alongside actor Daniel Franzese \u2015 who audiences will recognize from \u201cMean Girls\u201d and HBO\u2019s \u201cLooking\u201d \u2015 as one half of a tempestuous couple on an ill-fated vacation along the Mexican coast. Before the song reaches its emotional climax, the pair\u2019s altercations turn violent.\n\nGoss, who is based in Los Angeles, told HuffPost that the song was partly inspired by a recent trip he and his husband took to Mexico. The song\u2019s title, he added, refers to a marine geyser located on Mexico\u2019s Punta Banda Peninsula.\n\nNoting \u201cthe similarities of La Bufadora\u2019s power\u201d to \u201cemotional outbursts in a relationship,\u201d Goss said he\u2019d like the video to draw attention on what he describes as the \u201cunspoken issue\u201d of domestic violence among LGBTQ couples.\n\n\u201cAs humans, we can be so volatile or wounded at the drop of a hat,\u201d he explained. \u201cSometimes it is a choice we make, sometimes it is the deep-seated triggers that live within our bodies and minds. Just like La Bufadora, we ebb and flow, rest and explode.\u201d\n\nCourtesy of Tom Goss Singer-songwriter Tom Goss will release his new album, \"Territories,\" on Oct. 11.\n\nAlthough much of the cultural discussion about intimate partner violence has focused on heterosexual couples, recent research by the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control found that 26% of gay men and 37% of bisexual men have experienced rape, physical violence and/or stalking by an intimate partner in their lifetime.\n\nFor lesbian and bisexual women, those rates are 43.8% and 61%, respectively.\n\n\u201cLa Bufadora\u201d also gave Goss the opportunity to collaborate with Franzese. The two men will also appear in a forthcoming, three-song musical short that will be released alongside Goss\u2019s forthcoming album, \u201cTerritories.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think what Tom is doing here is showing a real vulnerable side of him and sharing fears and also bad memories along with really intimate thoughts and situations that most artists don\u2019t always let us see,\u201d Franzese said. \u201cI knew it would be an incredible project and I thought he would give good belly rubs. I was right about both.\u201d\n\nGoss, who has cited David Gray and Seal as influences, shot to viral fame in 2016 with his cover of \u201cSon of a Preacher Man.\u201d The music video reimagined the 1968 Dusty Springfield classic as a love story between two gay teens, one of whom happens to be the son of an evangelical preacher. As of Monday, it had received more than 3.9 million views on YouTube.\n\nSince then, he\u2019s emphasized LGBTQ themes in all of his subsequent videos, including \u201cQuayside,\u201d released earlier this year, and 2017\u2019s \u201cMore Than Temporary.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s described \u201cTerritories,\u201d due out Oct. 11, as his \u201cmost powerful\u201d work to date.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve spent the last two years writing, building, dreaming and creating,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to see how the world reacts.\u201d\n\nNeed help?
