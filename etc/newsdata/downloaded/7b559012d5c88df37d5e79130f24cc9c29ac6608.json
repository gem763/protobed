They tend to tell the same old stories, or promote some snake-oil-selling UFO \"expert.\" Perhaps the biggest issue I take with UFO documentaries is that they never focus on what actually matters: the people at the center of the frenzy, and the trauma they experience.\n\nBy this measure, Alan Stivelman\u2019s film Witness of Another World is the best documentary on the subject that I have ever seen.\n\nWitness of Another World tells the story of Juan P\u00e9rez, a lonely gaucho who, as a young boy, allegedly had an encounter with an anomalous aerial vehicle and the strange entities inside. In the 1970s, this incident made headline news in South America and, as the documentary shows, very much ruined P\u00e9rez\u2019s life. The film dives into P\u00e9rez\u2019s life 40 years later. Living alone, P\u00e9rez is still haunted by his alleged encounter.\n\n\u201cIn the beginning, I proposed to make this film in order to decode the mystery behind the UFO phenomenon,\u201d said Stivelman. \u201cThis mission was overshadowed by the acute sadness that Juan brought with him and the desire to understand why he had to have lived through that supernatural experience that marked him for the rest of his life.\u201d\n\nUFO documentaries usually make the same mistake: they try to \"prove\" that UFOs are real, or that they are alien, or interdimensional, or paranormal, or something else. They all inevitably fail. Stivelman\u2019s Witness of Another World is successful because it really isn\u2019t about UFOs, but about the people who have alleged encounters with them.\n\nYes, it is a movie about an alleged UFO encounter from 1978, but the UFO is really just a MacGuffin. P\u00e9rez is the real story here, and the conflicts he has with other people are really what the film is about. Watching P\u00e9rez break down on camera is one of the film's most powerful moments. It is jarring and painful\u2014a close up shot of his face, lined with wrinkles that don\u2019t seem to match his boyish bravado in the previous scenes.\n\n\u201cIt was there, as a filmmaker, that I had to make a crucial decision for the rest of the shooting. To continue with the investigation of the UFO phenomenon, to stay only in the phenomenological aspect, or to attend to Juan, to his suffering, and to look for a way to help him,\u201d Stivelman said.\n\nThe film is distributed by 1091 Media, formerly the Orchard, which has an established line-up of documentaries that focus on the paranormal and Ufological.\n\n\u201cIt's deep, emotional, and filmed in a way that fully encompasses what the abduction experience must've felt like. The film's also shot more like a feature than a documentary with beautiful reenactments. This really set the title apart from the rest in the genre and why 1091 picked it for distribution,\u201d said Vice President of Paranormal Content Jim Martin.\n\nApart from P\u00e9rez and Stivelman, the film also features computer scientist and author Jacques Vall\u00e9e, a venerated figure within UFO and paranormal circles. Vall\u00e9e interviewed P\u00e9rez when he was a boy, and has since held a firm conviction that the young gaucho had an encounter with a non-human intelligence.\n\n\u201cThis film does not attempt to reveal the UFO mystery but to lead the audience by the hand to walk beside it, to perceive it with their own consciousness and to draw their own conclusions,\u201d Stivelman explained.\n\nThe fundamental reason as to why the film works is that you don\u2019t need to believe any of it. No one can truly confirm P\u00e9rez\u2019s story. What the film portrays is a man clearly hurt by a traumatic event, who is emotionally and socially removed from his peers and family, simply because he nor they can cope. It shines a light into trauma itself.\n\nUFOs aside, the audience watches a man search, not for validation, but for healing. It is a very human story.\n\nWitness of Another World will be available worldwide on Vimeo and Amazon Prime on October 22nd.", "description": "'Witness of Another World' is a great UFO documentary because it's so grounded in the human experience.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5da64cf6f3e9040009b41ff3/lede/1571181094243-tempsnip.jpeg?crop=0.8638xw:0.9988xh;0.0852xw,0xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
