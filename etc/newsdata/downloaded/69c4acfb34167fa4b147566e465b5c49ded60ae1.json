(CSE: SNA) (CSE: SNA.CN) (OTCQB: SNAVF) (\"Star\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) reports that it did not file its annual financial statements for the financial period ended June 30, 2019, the related annual management's discussion and analysis and the related CEO and CFO certifications (collectively, the \u201cAnnual Filings\u201d) by the filing deadline of October 28, 2019 and therefore is in default of its requirements under National Instrument 51-102 - Continuous Disclosure Obligations and National Instrument 52-109 - Certification of Disclosure in Issuer's Annual and Interim Filings, as applicable.\n\n\n\nIn anticipation of the default described above, the Company had applied to the Ontario Securities Commission (\u201cOSC\u201d) for a management cease trade order under National Policy 12-203 \u2013 Management Cease Trade Orders which was expected to have only prohibited trading in securities of the Company by certain insiders of the Company. The Company\u2019s application was denied and, accordingly, the OSC informed the Company that it is noted in default on the OSC\u2019s reporting issuer default list for failure to file the Annual Filings and that it may be noted in default on the reporting issuer list, or default list, of each jurisdiction of Canada in which it is a reporting issuer, to the extent that such jurisdiction maintains a list and in accordance with the local policies and procedures of that jurisdiction, for failure to file the Annual Filings. The OSC further informed the Company that a cease trade order (\u201cCTO\u201d) will be issued. The Company has retained an auditor and is working towards meeting its continuous disclosure obligations and lifting the CTO.\n\nThe delay in issuing the Annual Filings is the result of a current lack of funds to remunerate the Company\u2019s auditors. The Company continues to suffer as a result of inappropriate attacks committed by certain dissident shareholders that are jeopardizing the Company\u2019s financing initiatives and continue to divert resources away from the Company\u2019s operation.\n\nAbout Star Navigation:\n\nStar Navigation Systems Group Ltd. owns the exclusive worldwide license to its proprietary, patented In-flight Safety Monitoring System, STAR-ISMS\u00ae, the heart of the STAR-A.D.S.\u00ae and of the STAR-ISAMM\u2122 Systems. Its real-time capability of tracking performance trends and predicting incident-occurrence enhances aviation safety and improves fleet management while reducing costs for the operator.\n\nStar\u2019s M.M.I. Division designs and manufactures high performance, mission critical, flight deck flat panel displays for defence and commercial aviation industries worldwide. These displays are found on aircraft and simulators, from C-130 aircraft, to Sikorsky and Agusta Westland helicopters, as examples.\n\nStar\u2019s subsidiary, Star-Isoneo Inc. is a specialised software firm, developing complex solutions in engineering, simulation and development for Canadian customers. Star-Isoneo works closely with Star in the development of the Company\u2019s MEDEVAC (STAR-ISAMM\u2122 and STAR-LSAMM\u2122) applications of the patented STAR-A.D.S.\u00ae technology, and on its current R&D program with Bombardier.\n\nCertain statements contained in this News Release constitute forward-looking statements.
