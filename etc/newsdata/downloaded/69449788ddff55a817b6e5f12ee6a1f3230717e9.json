Does he actually believe them? | Walter Shapiro", "language": "en", "text": "A puffed-up Donald Trump on Wednesday peddled his latest Syrian retreat as if his ability as a presidential peacemaker eclipsed Teddy Roosevelt, who won the 1906 Nobel prize for negotiating the end of the Russo-Japanese war, and Jimmy Carter, who helped broker the lasting Israeli-Egyptian accord.\n\nTrump has probably never heard of the swords-into-plowshares accomplishments of his predecessors. But even if Trump has noticed the Nobel prize in the Roosevelt Room of the White House, he probably would have dismissed it as a minor artifact compared with his strategic genius in bequeathing the Kurds to the tender mercies of Turkey and Russia.\n\nAs the president boasted, complete with a dollop of false modesty: \u201cToday\u2019s announcement validates our course of action with Turkey that only a couple of weeks ago were scorned. And now people are saying: \u2018Wow, what a great outcome. Congratulations.\u2019 It\u2019s too early [for] me to be congratulated. We\u2019ve done a great job. We\u2019ve saved a lot of lives.\u201d\n\nWow, indeed.\n\nBill Taylor\u2019s testimony removes any last plausible line of defense for Trump | Andrew Gawthorpe Read more\n\nFrom the phantom peace in Syria to the phantom wall on the Mexican border, the Trump presidency is based on the theory that reality is created by mere assertion. The scariest interpretation of the torrent of Trump lies is that the president actually believes the words that he is saying each time his lips move.\n\nIf truth is this malleable, why did Trump go to such lengths to delve for actual evidence in Ukraine about Hunter Biden\u2019s finances and the 2016 DNC hacking?\n\nWithout a shred of proof, Trump has been trumpeting for months such debunked claims as: \u201cWhen [Joe] Biden\u2019s son walks out of China with $1.5bn in a fund \u2026 and he\u2019s there for one quick meeting and he flies in on Air Force Two, I think that\u2019s a horrible thing.\u201d\n\nUp until now, the failed 1972 break-in at the Democratic National Committee at the Watergate held the record for presidential stupidity in the quest for re-election.\n\nAs John A Farrell tells it in his acclaimed 2017 Richard Nixon biography, the DNC was a backup site after Gordon Liddy had failed four times to break into the George McGovern campaign. As Farrell recounts: \u201cBugs planted in the DNC headquarters \u2026 could provide \u2018a wealth of information\u2019 of all kinds, Liddy believed.\u2019\u201d\n\nBy any rational measure, the Watergate break-in was dangerously unnecessary since Nixon would go on to carry 49 states against the hapless McGovern, even without planted microphones at Democratic headquarters.\n\nBut at least Watergate, at the beginning, was a tight-lipped conspiracy with the burglars, CIA-trained veterans of the 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion. In contrast, everyone from career diplomats like William Taylor to the government in Kyiv seemed to know about Trump\u2019s plotting in Ukraine.\n\nTaylor\u2019s explosive closed-door testimony on Tuesday captured the dimensions of the shakedown of the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Taylor, who temporarily heads the embassy in Kyiv, said that Gordon Sondland \u2013 a hotel executive turned ambassador \u2013 told him: \u201cPresident Trump is a businessman. When a businessman is about to sign a check to someone who owes him something \u2026 the businessman asks that person pay up.\u201d\n\nThe check was $390m in military aid to Ukraine that Congress had appropriated and the White House was withholding to pressure Zelenskiy. What Trump claimed he was owed was dirt on Hunter Biden and some sort of evidence buttressing the bizarre rightwing conspiracy theory that Ukraine had framed Russia for the 2016 hacking.\n\nLike Watergate, Trump\u2019s Pain in Ukraine threatens to bring down his presidency\n\nImagine, if you will, that the desperate Ukrainian had concocted a paper trail to please Trump. It almost certainly would not have made a difference in an election campaign that will mostly be a referendum on Trump. There is no guarantee that Biden will even win the Democratic nomination \u2013 and it seems ludicrous to believe that serious journalists would accept fabricated evidence about Hunter Biden.\n\nLike Watergate, Trump\u2019s Pain in Ukraine threatens to bring down his presidency.\n\nNothing better illustrates the increasing desperation of Trump\u2019s hardcore defenders on Capitol Hill than the efforts on Wednesday of two dozen Republican congressmen (and, yes, they were all male) to disrupt the impeachment depositions in a secure room of the House intelligence committee.\n\nThe Republican protest was nominally over the lack of public hearings on impeachment. But the enduring Washington truth is that when you are arguing process, you are losing.\n\nTaylor\u2019s written statement ended with an earnest plea: \u201cWe must support Ukraine in its fight against its bullying neighbor. Russian aggression cannot stand.\u201d Sadly, the same thing can be said about the Kurds, whom Trump also cynically and willfully abandoned.", "description": "The president\u2019s efforts in Ukraine break Watergate\u2019s record for presidential stupidity.
