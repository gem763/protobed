(pictured: Trump at gala in Washington Saturday)\n\nHunter Biden, 39, announced he will resign from the board of BHR (Shanghai) Equity Investment Fund Management Company at the end of the month following President Donald Trump's accusations of corruption with the state-backed firm in 2013. Hunter pictured with father Joe Biden in 2016\n\nIn that phone call, on July 25, Trump advised Zelenskyy to look into Joe Biden and Hunter Biden's deals in Ukraine.\n\nHunter then came under scrutiny for his work with Burisma, which he joined in April 2014 and served a five-year term before resigning earlier this year.\n\nTrump and his lawyer Rudy Giuliani claim that Vice President Biden threatened to withhold billions of dollars in loan guarantees in 2016 unless Ukraine fired the country's top prosecutor Viktor Shokin - who was leading a probe into Burisma.\n\nDespite Trump's claims that Biden misused his power in order to protect his son and Burisma Holdings - but there is no evidence to corroborate those claims.\n\nBiden has denied any wrongdoing in Ukraine.\n\nUS and Ukrainian officials also said that the investigation into the company was dormant at that time and Shokin was actually fired for the opposite reason, cut for failing to fight corruption.\n\n'Despite extensive scrutiny, at no time has any law enforcement agency, either domestic or foreign, alleged that Hunter engaged in wrongdoing at any point during his five-year term,' Hunter's statement said.\n\nEarlier this month Trump also called on China to investigate Biden, but the country's foreign ministry said they would not.\n\n'Under a Biden Administration, Hunter will readily comply with any and all guidelines or standards a President Biden may issue to address purported conflicts of interest, or the appearance of such conflicts, including any restrictions related to overseas business interests. He will continue to keep his father personally uninvolved in his business affairs,' Hunter's statement added.", "description": "The ban on private dollars, reminiscent of Biden's first days as a Senator nearly 50 years ago, comes as he has been lambasted by Democrat rivals for his leaning on lucrative fundraising events.", "authors": ["Ross Ibbetson For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/09/19680688-0-image-a-2_1571040336711.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
