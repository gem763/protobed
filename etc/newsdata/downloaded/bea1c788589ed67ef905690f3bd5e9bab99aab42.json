In fact, it has been his message from the day he was hired in November 2017.\n\nThat was also the day he declared that nothing less than the World Series will do.\n\n\u201cMy message from here on out is to play the last game of the World Series and win,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s all we are going to concentrate on, that\u2019s all we are going to worry about. How are we going to do that? By winning one more game each day.\u201d\n\nWinning one more game each day \u2014 a simple message that Martinez never wavered from since he took the job.\n\nThere were more than a few eyebrows raised that Nov. 2, 2017 day when Martinez sat in front of reporters at a press conference in the Nationals clubhouse and told everyone that his goal was to lead this team to a World Series championship.\n\nHe said the goal is \u201cto get to the next level and win a world championship in Washington.\u201d\n\nAnd in case you didn\u2019t hear him, he repeated himself.\n\n\u201cThe object is to win as many games possible,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cWe\u2019re not just here to win a playoff game. We\u2019re here to win a World Series.\u201d\n\nWere you paying attention? Just in case you weren\u2019t \u2014 again.\n\n\u201cAfter talking to the Lerner family and Mike (Rizzo, Nationals president and general manager) I think we have something in common and that is the desire and passion to bring a world championship to Washington,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get it done.\u201d\n\nHe might as well have been saying he was going to balance the federal budget.\n\nIt had been tried by others \u2014 some who seemingly were better qualified than Martinez to accomplish this goal.\n\nDavey Johnson had one World Series title on his resume when he declared in 2012 it was World Series or bust. He failed. Matt Williams said he was \u201cready to go.\u201d He left two years later without a World Series. Dusty Baker said he was \u201cexcited\u201d about coming here and spoke of the formula of the team\u2019s mixture of youth and experience. He was unable to use that mixture to reach the World Series.\n\nAnd then Martinez \u2014 with zero managing experience \u2014 went beyond all his predecessors\u2019 boasts and excitement and formulas for success and put himself out there with his testimony that nothing less than a World Series title would do.\n\nAnd now, here he is, farther than anyone who came before him, on the brink of talking his goals into existence.\n\nWhat may have fueled Martinez\u2019s boldness was that the owner, Ted Lerner, sat just a few feet away from Martinez at the press conference, and he was telling the Lerners what they wanted to hear. After four NL division titles followed by four early postseason exits, falling short of expectations, the family had made it clear they wanted more.\n\nTwo weeks before introducing Martinez, the Lerners wrote a letter to Nationals fans:\n\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve brought competitive, winning baseball back to Washington with a passionate fan base that every team in the Major Leagues would be proud to call its own. More than anything, we want to share with you the elation of the final out going in our favor, when we can finally bring a championship home to Washington. That \u2018One Pursuit\u2019 is the core driving force behind everything we do, from the first day of spring training to the last out of the final game.\n\n\u201cEven though this ultimately wasn\u2019t our season, we remain devoted to that cause. In further pursuit of that goal, we have decided to make a change in leadership and begin the process of finding a new manager.\u201d\n\nIf you wanted to manage their team, you knew what the Lerners were now not just expecting, but demanding.\n\nBut Martinez\u2019s words and his style have not changed since the day he took the job. His words and his style have not changed even when his team was 19-31 this season and on the brink of the worst failure yet.\n\nHe may have truly believed that they were going to \u201cwin one more game each day\u201d that day at the press conference. When he said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to get it done,\u201d Martinez may have been speaking from his heart.\n\nNo one is raising their eyebrows anymore.\n\n\u2981 Hear Thom Loverro on 106.7 The Fan Wednesday afternoons and Saturday mornings and on the Kevin Sheehan Show podcast.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
