The Orioles depended entirely on Mancini the night before and spread the wealth all through the lineup on the way to what seemed certain to be their 50th victory.\n\nMancini was right in the middle of it again, delivering a two-run double in the second inning that accounted for his 89th and 90th RBI of the season, but the Orioles\u2019 offense was already in full swing by that time.\n\nAnthony Santander, Rio Ruiz and Austin Hays had rattled off consecutive two-out doubles in the first inning to score two runs against Jays starter Clay Buchholz. Mancini\u2019s second-inning double gave Orioles starter Dylan Bundy more breathing room, before Villar and Santander homered in the fourth to give the Orioles a 7-1 lead.\n\nIt was Santander\u2019s 19th homer of the season, and it appeared to portend a rare blowout, especially after Bundy had shaken off some early control problems to allow just one run and strike out eight over five innings. But in this second straight season 100-plus losses, things are seldom that simple.\n\nThe Orioles would have to sweat this one out as the bullpen helped usher the Blue Jays back into the game.", "description": "Miguel Castro surrenders a grand slam during a ninth-inning bullpen meltdown as Toronto storms back for an 11-10 victory.", "authors": ["Peter Schmuck", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/kzXNROpLC8ABlU14uMYi3_Gzd_M=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ISCZXEW2SII6TP5RQSMIONUUOY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
