Dauster stopped me cold and said that the reports out of the Spire Institute school in Ohio were promising: Ball was maturing, he\u2019s now 6\u20196\u2033 with handles, had gotten serious about his game, and was starting to look like a quality NBA-level prospect. He was always potentially the most talented of the Ball brothers, but he seemed to get washed away in the wave of Big Baller Brand hype at a young age.\n\nThat wave crashed, Ball chose to take his game to Australia this year, and down under he has blown people away \u2014 to the point he is shooting up NBA draft boards into the top five and even three.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nESPN\u2019s Jonathan Givony went to Australia to watch Ball play, and like a lot of scouts he came away impressed. Ball is now third on ESPN\u2019s it\u2019s-far-too-early mock draft, and he got these quotes from scouts.\n\n\u201cIf he keeps this up, I don\u2019t see any way he isn\u2019t in the conversation for the No. 1 overall pick,\u201d one NBA executive told ESPN. \u201cHe completely changed my perception of the type of prospect he is, and all of the background info I gathered here from his coaches and teammates paint a very different story of what I thought about him off the court as well.\u201d \u201cHe plays with incredible pace. He\u2019s never sped up. He\u2019s never rattled by anything that\u2019s thrown at him,\u201d the same scout said. \u201cYou\u2019re expecting something magical to happen every time he has the ball. He sees everything. He can make every pass with either hand off a live dribble. His style of play is tailor-made for the NBA game, especially if you surround him with shooting and better finishers.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nThere\u2019s a long time between now and the draft next June, other potential high draft picks such as James Wiseman, Cole Anthony, and Anthony Edwards have not yet even taken the court. Teams draft boards are going to shift around a lot in the coming nine months.\n\nThat said, expect LaMelo Ball\u2019s name to be near the top of the draft boards.\n\nAnd yes, that means more LaVar Ball everywhere, too.
