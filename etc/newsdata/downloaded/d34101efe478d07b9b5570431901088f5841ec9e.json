A method of scoring that has become an endangered species accounted for more than one quarter of Barry John\u2019s points tally for his country. In one club match for Cardiff, when two of Llanelli\u2019s back-row forwards were his brothers who had threatened all sorts if they got hold of him, the game\u2019s greatest fly-half barely made a break or passed all match, but his four drop kicks delivered a 12-9 victory.\n\nWales cling on in face of Australia comeback to edge brilliant Pool D clash Read more\n\nBefore Sunday\u2019s effective group decider against Australia, it had been 35 internationals since Wales had scored with a drop goal. It was through necessity then, the fly-half Sam Davies winning the 2016 game against Japan in Cardiff with three points seconds from full time, but here it was a tactic that won a game in which Wales were outscored by three tries to two.\n\nDan Biggar\u2019s drop goal after 36 seconds, the quickest in the history of the World Cup, and another by his replacement Rhys Patchell three minutes into the second half, proved the difference between the sides in a fixture that has invariably this decade been decided by a few points. Until last November\u2019s 9-6 victory in Cardiff, they had lost 13 matches in a row to the Wallabies, several in the final minutes.\n\nThey absorbed two key details which they used to telling effect in delivering their first victory over a major southern hemisphere nation in the group or knockout stage of a World Cup: they turned pressure into points and held their nerve in the closing minutes so that when Australia sought to make their greater composure and technique tell, it was Wales who were making the right decisions.\n\nAustralia's Will Genia and Bernard Foley wilt in Wales defeat | Oliver Trenchard Read more\n\nThe Wallabies became gripped by despair \u2013 eventually blundering their way to a defeat that leaves them probably needing to beat England and New Zealand to reach the final.\n\nWales\u2019s ascent to the top looks less steep. With Fiji and Uruguay to come, they are on course to finish at the top of a World Cup pool for the third time: the other two occasions, in 1987 and 1999, did not include a tier one nation from the south and 20 years ago, when they were hosts, they were not inconvenienced by one from the north. The significance of a victory that leaves them with a potential quarter-final against France is that it was the first of its kind on this stage.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Alun Wyn Jones is tackled by Australia\u2019s Rory Arnold in what was a very physical match.

It did not take Gatland long to crack Europe \u2013 a mere couple of months \u2013 but the south took a little longer, some 10 years.\n\nWinston Churchill, rather than one of his admirers, may have been prime minister when Wales last defeated New Zealand, but South Africa have been mastered in the last four years and now Australia. What was notable about this victory was that when he started planning for the pool two years ago, Gatland would have been counting on the likes of Sam Warburton, Taulupe Faletau and Rhys Webb, Lions all, to help him break new ground.\n\nThe Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\n\nThey were all elsewhere but barely missed. Aaron Wainwright was involved in everything until his legs gave out from the effort, Josh Navidi helped thwart Australia\u2019s threat at the breakdown and, at scrum-half, Gareth Davies scored one of his side\u2019s two tries with a trademark interception and his scampering, hurry-up style allowed Wales to play with tempo and width in the opening half when they built up a 15-point lead.\n\nAnother Gareth Davies, who played for Cardiff, Wales and the Lions in the 1970s and 1980s and is now the Welsh Rugby Union chairman, was one of the many drop-goal specialists Wales used to manufacture, but his namesake, in a position that not long ago looked to be one of Wales\u2019s few areas of weakness because of the France-based Webb\u2019s unavailability, dropped Australia in it and kept Wales on course for Gatland\u2019s fitting finale.", "description": "With Wales outscored three tries to two, No10s ended a 35-international match gap since their last scored with a drop goal", "authors": ["Paul Rees"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/81cffed67253022f9ff6fff2e7d8453152b2191e/127_386_3520_2112/master/3520.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f039a891027a0c7dae6834a2166b14b9", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
