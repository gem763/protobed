Expect a free-flowing game with plenty of chances for both teams.\n\nThe pressure will be on Frank Lampard despite the odds being against him - he will not want to begin the season without a home win in four games at Stamford Bridge. If N\u2019Golo Kante is fit, he will play, but that is a big \u2018if\u2019.\n\nIf Kante does not play, Roberto Firmino will have a big impact on the game with Chelsea playing without a natural bridge between their defence and midfield - exactly the space in which the Brazilian does his best work.\n\nChelsea 1-2 Liverpool\n\nLatest updates\n\nTen minutes to go until Chelsea host Liverpool at Stamford Bridge. If Liverpool were to win they would become the first team to win the first six games of the season in consecutive years. Can Chelsea ruin the party? They held Liverpool to a 1-1 draw last season to end their winning run, will they do the same again today? Head-to-head Chelsea have won just one of the past nine Premier League meetings between the sides, drawing five and losing three. Liverpool have claimed five victories from their last 11 league trips to Stamford Bridge and the Blues have scored in all-but one of their last 20 meetings with Liverpool in all competitions. Liverpool are big favourites but Chelsea will throw everything they have at the Reds and maybe, just maybe, something will stick. Chelsea are searching for their first win at Stamford Bridge under Frank Lampard but it'll be a tough, tough ask. Liverpool have won their first five games of the season to make it 14 wins in a row but their first dropped points last season came against Chelsea. Team news N'Golo Kante makes his first start for Chelsea since August after recovering from an ankle injury. Mason Mount is also fit after a knock against Valencia midweek. There is also a start for Emerson after the full-back recovered from injury. He replaces Marcos Alonso. There\u2019s two changes for Liverpool from their last Premier League game as Roberto Firmino returns to the starting XI while Jordan Henderson replaces Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain in midfield.

Jurgen Klopp has seen the effect that the young players have had on the Chelsea team and he credits Frank Lampard for that improvement. He said: \"Chelsea had some problems but they have sorted it well. I don't think they expected [to lose to Valencia]. It reminds me of my team in Dortmund a few years ago. Really young but they only played because they were that good. \"Frank Lampard did an outstanding job at Derby so I am not surprised by him at Chelsea. But it is a difficult league. I can see some people are not happy with some results but that is not because of him. He is a really good manager.\" A once fierce and fiery rivalry, one that pitted Frank Lampard against Steven Gerrard, has lost it's spark. How did that happen and can it be reignited?
