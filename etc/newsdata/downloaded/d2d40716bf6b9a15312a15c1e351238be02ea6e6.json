Photo: Win McNamee/Getty Images\n\nLong before this week, when he referred to himself as the victim of a lynching, Donald Trump has been fluent in the language of a racist mob. It ran underneath the full-page newspaper ads he paid $85,000 for in 1989, in which he called for the execution of the five black teens about to be tried for the rape of a white female jogger in Central Park. In that ad, he fretted for families who could no longer enjoy strolls in the park thanks to the presence of \u201cwild criminals\u201d roaming the streets. \u201cI am not looking to psychoanalyze or understand [these men],\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cI am looking to punish them \u2026 I want them to understand our anger. I want them to be afraid.\u201d\n\nThe anger Trump wanted these kids \u2014 who would spend 13 years in jail before being fully exonerated in 2002 \u2014 and the public to understand was the anger of a powerful white New Yorker who did not want to tolerate the presence of less powerful New Yorkers. More than that, he wanted millions of readers to understand the potency of that anger: its money, its influence, its public reach, its ability to cast the mere presence of people he didn\u2019t like on the street as a violent threat to him and others like him.\n\nThese were the dynamics \u2014 fury at any disruption to his presence or preferences in the world, or to a social order which would keep him at the top \u2014 that Trump was so adept at conveying on a campaign trail in 2016, when he encouraged his massive, screaming, mostly white crowds to enact physical violence against any protesters who might take up space or challenge them. After one Black Lives Matter protester was beaten following one of his events, Trump told Fox News, \u201cMaybe he should have been roughed up, because it was absolutely disgusting what he was doing.\u201d At another rally, in Las Vegas, Trump told his jeering crowd, as a man was led out by police, \u201cYou know what they used to do to a guy like that in a place like this? They\u2019d be carried out on a stretcher, folks.\u201d\n\nThese calls echo the language and thinking of lynching, the extrajudicial torture and murder of mostly nonwhite people, and especially African-Americans, that was most common in the Jim Crow South. According to the King Center in Atlanta, \u201cMore than 4,400 African-American men, women, and children were hanged, burned alive, shot, drowned, and beaten to death by white mobs between 1877 and 1950.\u201d This is the greatness of American history to which Trump has promised his fans a return; these are the flames he has consciously stoked: the return of the mob, and with it the ability, via public spectacle, to punish and hurt those with less power who would challenge or inconvenience an old kind of authority. The cruelty, as Adam Serwer has written, is the point. Yet when Trump is leading the mob, he is rarely fully explicit in his evocation of an era of racist violence.\n\nOn Tuesday, he made his reference plain, at the moment that he decided to reverse the lynching framework by casting himself, and imagined future Republican presidents, as powerless victims of a punitive Democratic crowd. \u201cSo some day, if a Democrat becomes President and the Republicans win the House, even by a tiny margin,\u201d Trump tweeted, \u201cthey can impeach the President, without due process or fairness or any legal rights. All Republicans must remember what they are witnessing here \u2013 a lynching. But we will WIN!\u201d\n\nThis was the text of Trump\u2019s barely cogent missive, which not only made the vile comparison between a House impeachment inquiry and extrajudicial murder, but was also inaccurate in its assessment of congressional power dynamics and everything else, including spelling. Tactically, this gambit was not so different from Trump\u2019s previous claims that he was victim of mobs and witch hunts, but when he used the word \u201clynching\u201d outright, it was too much even for a couple of his party peers, including Mitch McConnell and Susan Collins, both of whom offered (extremely) tepid rebukes.\n\nYet it was just the thing for some other Republicans, chief among them South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham, who wasted no time getting in front of news cameras: \u201cWhen [an investigation is] about Trump,\u201d Graham said, claiming to describe the Democrats\u2019 approach to impeachment, \u201cwho cares about the process, so long as you get him. So yeah, this is a lynching.\u201d In case anyone wasn\u2019t clear, Graham also said, \u201cThis is a lynching in every sense,\u201d and later told Bob Costa, \u201cIf [the word] lynching bothers you, I\u2019m sorry \u2026 it\u2019s literally a political lynching.\u201d\n\nThe willingness to abuse power and then protect one\u2019s power by casting oneself as abused, via a fantasy of victimhood, surely has a lengthy history, but has become a particular hallmark of the post-Obama political era. The inversion of vulnerability so that it applies \u2014 nonsensically, ahistorically, yes, but too often, persuasively \u2014 to the least vulnerable is pervasive and effective. Those who were lynched were, definitionally, powerless. This makes it both particularly rich and particularly potent imagery for the powerful. It enables them to appropriate one of the only tools available to the powerless: the moral claim to a tale of injustice. Often, and often more subtly than how it unfolded on Tuesday, we are seduced by those with the loudest voices into seeing them \u2014 the most mighty \u2014 as the most mistreated.\n\nTrump and Graham are not even the first politicians this year to compare the experience of public censure in response to alleged abuses to being lynched. Virginia\u2019s lieutenant governor Justin Fairfax, a Democrat who in 2019 was accused on the record by two women of sexual assault, gave a speech in front of the Virginia State Senate in February in which he compared himself to a lynching victim. And it\u2019s not just elected officials. In 2018, the musician R. Kelly, who has since been indicted on ten counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse against minors, claimed that the Time\u2019s Up Women of Color Branch, which was then advocating a boycott of his music, was tantamount to the \u201cattempted public lynching of a black man who has made extraordinary contributions to our culture.\u201d That \u201cpublic lynching\u201d is the same language that Bill Cosby\u2019s publicist used about his conviction on sexual-assault charges in 2018; Cosby\u2019s wife, Camille, wrote a three-page statement comparing her husband\u2019s treatment to lynching. And one of the most famous uses of the lynching metaphor as defense of power came from Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, who asserted in 1991 that the accusations of sexual harassment made against him by Anita Hill (and corroborated by three other women who were not asked to testify at his Judiciary Committee hearing) constituted a \u201chigh-tech lynching.\u201d\n\nThomas, Cosby, Kelly, and Fairfax\u2019s use of the lynching comparison is different than Trump\u2019s; they are black men, recognizing in the metaphor its very real history, in which (mostly fantasized or invented) claims of sexual aggressions against white women were used to justify the torture and murder of black men. These men deployed the analogy in the face of multiple, credible allegations lodged against them, strategically using the history of racist violence as a shield, while in all cases except Cosby\u2019s, these men\u2019s accusers were primarily black women. (This is crucial, as Salamishah Tillet has argued, citing the journalist and anti-lynching activist Ida B. Wells, because while white women\u2019s sexual violability has too often been used as the justification for racist violence, the very real sexual violence done to black women has just as often gone not only unpunished, but unnoticed).\n\nNone of this particular subtext applies to either Donald Trump or Lindsey Graham, both of whom are white men. Nor does it apply to the many lawmakers, including current Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, who defended Bill Clinton during his 1998 impeachment proceedings by comparing that inquiry to a lynching (a \u201cpartisan lynching,\u201d was Biden\u2019s phrase). What they all have in common is a readiness to turn to a metaphor that erases their power, when charged with abusing it, and presents them instead as the real victims of injustice.\n\nTrump has repeatedly called the investigations into him \u2014 by special counsel Robert Mueller and now House oversight panels \u2014 a \u201cwitch hunt,\u201d and Trump\u2019s private counsel Rudy Giuliani tweeted that \u201cEven Salem witch trials didn\u2019t use anonymous testimony.\u201d The reference to a period of 17th-century violence in Salem, Massachusetts, carries far less historical weight than the callback to lynching \u2014 a widespread practice that was common for decades and arguably extends to this day. But it relies on the same strategy: the pretense of defenselessness against a mob. Giuliani, appearing on Fox News with Laura Ingraham, would double down on his preposterous witch-trial assertion, telling her that the women and men accused of sorcery in 1692 Salem \u201chad more rights\u201d than President Donald Trump in 2019. (For what it\u2019s worth, many of the women and men who were imprisoned, tortured, and killed in the 17th century were convicted based on \u201cspectral evidence,\u201d i.e., the testimony of spirits who appeared to random people sitting in the courtroom.)\n\nThe performance of inequity and injustice invites the public to view the powerful with a kind of sympathy that, ironically enough, is rarely available to those who have less power. This is the truly grotesque factor: It is power itself that renders people recognizable to us, affords them our sympathy and empathy; it\u2019s power that makes them more likely to be believed when they tell us of the injustice they have suffered.\n\nThis is why Brett Kavanaugh, a wealthy white federal judge who was credibly accused of sexual violence yet was nonetheless elevated to the most powerful court in the country, managed to so successfully present himself to the nation as mortally imperiled. \u201cMy family and my name have been totally and permanently destroyed,\u201d Kavanaugh said, while Trump postulated that \u201cit\u2019s a very scary & dangerous time for young men in America,\u201d describing those who opposed Kavanaugh\u2019s appointment as a \u201cliberal mob\u201d and suggesting that those on the right who defended him should get \u201csecurity to protect themselves.\u201d (It\u2019s certainly not just big bad Republicans who do this kind of inversion. In 2018, NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw described himself as having been \u201ctaken to the guillotine\u201d after having been accused by one woman of having kissed her against her will in the 1990s; the British director Terry Gilliam claimed in 2018 that actor Matt Damon, after having been criticized on Twitter for comments he made about Me Too, had been \u201cbeaten to death.\u201d)\n\nThe impulse to revert to falsified claims of vulnerability and physical suffering reflects the sense of many who believe themselves to have some innate claim to power \u2014 or maybe even just the experience of holding it \u2014 that that claim is being compromised, and that that loss of unchallenged primacy is tantamount to actual harm. The claim that established power is being threatened is also, circularly, the very imagined conviction that undergirded the practice of lynching itself. Black Americans were often lynched in response to the imagined or invented sexual incursions on white bodies, but also simply after moving into or nearby white communities, attempting to vote, or building successful businesses that interfered in any way with unfettered white profit.\n\nIt\u2019s this sense that is, to some degree, the distinguishing undercurrent of the era we\u2019re living through.\n\nIt\u2019s behind the MAGA hats and the nostalgia for a more officially stratified America; it underpins the drive to build courts that will reverse voting and reproductive and collective bargaining rights; it\u2019s what permits Trump to brag about grabbing women and hearken back at his rallies to the days when protesters would be taken out on stretchers and compare himself to a victim of lynching and not suffer for it with his base, but in fact become more warmly embraced as an expressor of their own convictions. It\u2019s what gives a crowd of white, suited Republican men the idea of barging into legitimate, regulated impeachment inquiry hearings in an effort to shut them down \u2014 as they did on Wednesday, delaying the deposition of a Defense Department official by five hours. It was simultaneously a piece of inane political theater, but also a frightening visual reminder: a taste of what a mob of powerful white men \u2014 claiming to be seeking \u201cjustice\u201d for a man who says he\u2019s been victimized \u2014 are capable of.\n\nSign Up for the Intelligencer Newsletter Daily news about the politics, business, and technology shaping our world.
