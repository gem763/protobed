He joined Friday\u2019s edition of SiriusXM\u2019s Breitbart News Daily for an interview with host Alex Marlow to discuss the film on the day of its launch in theaters.\n\n\u201cThis is the wake up call to the greatest crisis in American history since slavery, and that is the assault on free speech, and I don\u2019t exaggerate,\u201d Prager stated. \u201cI\u2019ve been on radio 35 years, and I may be wrong, but I never exaggerate what I believe. There is no question to me this is the greatest threat to the fundamental value of America \u2014 liberty \u2014 in its history, and certainly since slavery.\u201d\n\nLISTEN:\n\nPrager continued, \u201cWe have to wake up America. \u2026 I have to be honest. I did not make the film. I am in the film. The people who made the film did a great job. This is a great film. I\u2019ve seen it four times. I would be riveted if I saw it a fifth time.\u201d\n\nNo Safe Spaces will initially open in Phoenix, Arizona, with opportunities for national release, explained Prager. \u201cYour listeners in Phoenix have a chance to make this thing national, because if we sell out in Phoenix this weekend, we will go to theaters all over the country. They\u2019re looking at Phoenix as the test case.\u201d\n\nPrager said, \u201cYou really can bring a liberal\u2013 not a leftist \u2014 but a liberal relative [to see No Safe Spaces] because there are a lot of people who are liberal in this film who are frightened by what\u2019s happening on campuses, as well.\u201d\n\nAmericans broadly practice political self-censorship due to fear of the left, Prager noted. He has previously warned that fear of the left is more common than fear of God.\n\n\u201cThe greatest fears in America are all fears of the left,\u201d determined Prager .\u201dThey\u2019re fears of LGBTQ activists, that\u2019s why Procter and Gamble has now announced that its menstrual products are not just for women; the New York Times, the fear of being written up in the New York Times, the desire to be praised by the New York Times; [and] the fear of ostracization at work.\u201d\n\nPrager, who conducts orchestras as an avocation, recalled left-wing attempts to block his conduction of the Santa Monica Symphony in 2015 as illustrative of the left\u2019s intimidation of those detracting from its orthodoxy.\n\n\u201cI got emails from musicians all over America [during this time]. \u2026 When I conducted the Santa Monica Symphony at the Disney Concert Hall two years ago \u2026 a woman in one of the biggest orchestras in America wrote to me, she\u2019s in her orchestra 35 years, nobody knows she\u2019s a conservative.\u201d\n\nPrager continued, \u201cPeople come up to me in airports and they whisper, \u2018I\u2019m a conservative,\u2019 or they whisper, \u2018I\u2019m for Trump.\u2019 That is the grip of fear the left has on America today. People are literally afraid to come out as conservative.\u201d\n\nMarlow asked Prager about hope in pursuit of protecting the values of free speech and expression.\n\n\u201cWhenever I\u2019m asked the hope question, this is my response,\u201d replied Prager. \u201cIt\u2019s more cute than it is accurate, but I have to share it. Many years ago, a man I used to visit in Israel all the time \u2014 he was a sort of mentor to me, a well-known rabbi in Israel, I used to live at his home \u2014 told me a story [about] the early days in Israel when it was really very socialist. He applied for a phone. He [asked] the clerk in the office, \u2018How long will it take me to get my phone?\u2019 The clerk [responded], \u2018Six months.\u2019 So my friend asked the [clerk], \u2018Is there any hope I can it sooner?\u2019, and the [clerk] answered, \u2018Sir, there\u2019s always hope. There\u2019s no chance.'\u201d\n\nHumanity\u2019s capacity for darkness is eternal, warned Prager.\n\n\u201cI am too aware of the ability of civilization to decline rapidly,\u201d Prager remarked. \u201cAs a Jew, watching what happened to the most artistic [and] intellectual country in Europe in one generation going from great art to Auschwitz \u2014 I am not predicting that for American in any way \u2014 but I do not walk around optimistic about a humanity that thinks that George Soros is noble and George Washington is an a-hole. That\u2019s very bad.\u201d\n\nPrager shared his essentialist view of human nature and the human condition. \u201cYou have to be a fool if you believe people are basically good. You know why [some] think people are basically good? Because Americans are so nice, and [they] have no experience with mankind.\u201d\n\n\u201cReligious people know that human nature is not basically good,\u201d added Prager. \u201cYou can\u2019t be wise if you think human nature is basically good, everything you then believe is going to be nonsense.\u201d\n\nThe Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) rated No Safe Spaces PG-13, noted Marlow. \u201cThere\u2019s also a ratings controversy with the film. The MPAA trying to give you guys an unnecessarily high rating. This is obviously designed to cut down on the amount of people who can see the films. This is a film about free speech, and the MPAA basically proving your point right off the bat.\u201d\n\nThe MPAA\u2019s rating of No Safe Spaces as PG-13, explained Prager, was based on an animated assassination of \u2018Firsty,\u2019 a cartoon anthropomorphized depiction of the First Amendment.\n\nPrager concluded, \u201cHe who controls language, let alone news, controls the society. \u2026 I believe as a student of totalitarian societies I believe that only the press in a totalitarian state can brainwash people, and I have learned that that\u2019s not true. The press in a free society can brainwash people, and that is very disconcerting, but I have learned that in America and the [broader] West.\u201d\n\nBreitbart News Tonight broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot channel 125 weeknights from 9:00 p.m. to midnight Eastern or 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Pacific.\n\nFollow Robert Kraychik on Twitter @rkraychik.", "description": "The film No Safe Spaces is\u00a0a \"wake-up call to the greatest crisis in American history since slavery,\" said Dennis Prager.", "authors": ["Robert Kraychik"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/Dennis-Prager-Michael-Robinson-ChavezLos-Angeles-Times-via-Getty-Images.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
