At least one devoted soldier-gamer had even brought along a map of the fictional city from Grand Theft Auto.\n\nThere were also stacks of DVDs and, in a display of true American-ness, a fridge full of Coca-Cola. Scavengers also found basketballs and footballs at the site.\n\nGamers RISE UP at abandoned American base in Manbij:\n\n\n\n-Rainbow Six Siege\n\n-Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 (featuring: UNO)\n\n-A map of Los Santos, fictional city setting of GTA: San Andreas pic.twitter.com/6wOVCxRE9o \u2014 Serge (@Zinvor) October 21, 2019\n\nAn RT crew that filmed inside the deserted base last week found furniture, personal belongings and even an unfinished meals.\n\nAlso on rt.com Left in a hurry: RT films inside abandoned US military base at Manbij, Syria (VIDEOS, PHOTOS)\n\nWhile rushing out the door, the soldiers also apparently forgot to bring their \u2018come and take it\u2019 flag, so Russian media came and took pictures with it. Originating from the ancient Greek term \u2018molon labe,\u2019 the flag is a symbol of US military defiance, and, in this case, of stinging irony.\n\nRussian Journalist with US molon labe flag at abandoned American base in Syria pic.twitter.com/QMvgkRQJh4 \u2014 DoC\u00a9 (@DocPakistan) October 20, 2019\n\nThey also left behind a rather indecorous greeting to Russia, perhaps to offset the bitterness for the abandoned flag.\n\nThe troops pulled out of the base, located southwest of the northern city of Manbij, last Tuesday. The retreat followed the decision by the US President Donald Trump to withdraw American personnel prior to the Turkish operation against Kurdish-led militias. US forces have since crossed into western Iraq, where they may or may not finish reading all the Harry Potter books.\n\nLike this story?
