The reasoning was ridiculous, their demeanor absurdly transparent, and the self-righteousness was nauseating. President Trump now faces impeachment proceedings because he spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in July. Trump allegedly shook down the leader, saying he would withhold aid unless a corruption investigation was launched against Hunter Biden, who was sitting on the board of an energy company there without any prior experience. And then, a transcript of the call torched all of that. There was no quid pro quo as alleged in a whistleblower complaint. The complainant is reportedly a CIA officer, who didn\u2019t listen in on the call and the entire report is grounded by second-hand sources. It\u2019s all hearsay, which explains the oodles of errors. And did Democrats read the complaint before executing their impeachment fantasy? No.\n\nWith every passing day, it\u2019s becoming clearer that we have a nothing burger. Democrats wanted to impeach Trump because he won the 2016 election. Here was their window before the 2020 cycle to avoid angering their base. It\u2019s truly pathetic. To show that this whole effort has truly gone off the rails, Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD) is not talking about a new dossier the supposedly related to the Trump-Ukraine story is not supported by evidence\u2014and no one knows where it came from. State Department Inspector General Steve Linick was on the Hill Wednesday to discuss it. Raskin said it really has nothing to do with Trump\u2019s impeachment inquiry, but then decided to suggest that it follows the narrative the Trump team is trying to peddle regarding this Ukraine story (via Roll Call):\n\nThe State Department\u2019s inspector general on Wednesday shared with Congress a dossier of unknown origins that one lawmaker said contained conspiracy theories and was hand-delivered to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo months ago. With members away from the Capitol for a two-week recess, Steve Linick, the State Department\u2019s top watchdog, briefed congressional staffers Maryland Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin, on the documents that Raskin said arrived at the department in May. \u201cIt raises more questions than it answers,\u201d Raskin said of the documents. \u201cThe inspector general had no idea where it came from.\u201d [\u2026] Raskin said the documents are unclassified and posited that they came from the White House. He said they mention the family of former vice president and 2020 hopeful Joe Biden, and former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, who was abruptly recalled in May. Raskin reiterated that he and Linick are unaware of the documents\u2019 origins, but said the information in the dossier fits with the narrative espoused by Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani. [\u2026] \u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear whoever put it together was attempting to advance exactly the storyline Mr. Giuliani was,\u201d Raskin said.\n\nUh, how can it be clear if you don\u2019t know the origins, Jamie? You don\u2019t know. And maybe it is a distraction, but since you don\u2019t know where this came from, perhaps you shouldn\u2019t have given it the light of day. But we get it; \u2018orange man, bad.\u2019 So, you turn nothing into something by taking a swipe at the Trump White House, weaponizing unknown documents for which you cannot corroborate in order to score points\u2026because that\u2019s the responsible thing to do. CNN Contributor Phil Mudd, a former CIA and FBI agent, called this whole spectacle a \u201chot mess\u201d (via Free Beacon):\n\n\n\n\n\nMudd criticized Raskin for sharing information from a briefing with State Department inspector general Steve Linick. He said that it was irresponsible for the Democratic congressman to talk about the documents without confirming their origin. \"Let me give you another interpretation,\" Mudd told host CNN's Jake Tapper. \"The congressman put his foot in a cow pie and said isn't this cool. What a hot mess that was.\" Raskin insinuated that the inspector general was sitting on devastating information that could support President Trump's impeachment. \"The inspector general was basically just saying, we're sitting on this packet of disinformation which came from some uncertain place,\" Raskin told reporters. \"And again this is my interpretation of it. There may be misconduct by the secretary of state or other State Department employees in distributing this if they know where it comes from and they know that it does not have any authentic source in the White House.\" Mudd questioned the validity of Raskin's information. He said it would be easy to supply misinformation that would attract attention even if it was false. \"They don't know where this stuff came from,\" Mudd said. \"I could have sent it for all they know. He clearly hasn't reviewed it. He hasn\u2019t had the time to review it so we don't know exactly what\u2019s in there.\"\n\nIt\u2019s a fishing expedition. They have nothing. They have less than nothing. The Democrats were already pushing it with this Russian collusion myth for which there was zero evidence to support that claim. Many of us knew that from the get-go. The media still peddled this manufactured story until Robert Mueller\u2019s report torpedoed it. Shoot first, ask question later. That\u2019s the ethos of the Left right now with this impeachment circus, which is doing more damage to our institutions that Trump could allegedly ever do.", "description": ".10/03/2019 19:25:13PM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa", "Timothy Meads", "Leah Barkoukis", "Cortney O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/259/763525b1-6817-4b27-aac5-4eaed2007251.png"}
