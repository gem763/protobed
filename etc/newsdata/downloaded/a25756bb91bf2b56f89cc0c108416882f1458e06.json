Rep. Eliot Engel, who heads the Foreign Affairs panel, wants to hold a public hearing on the topic later this month and has invited the government's envoy for the talks, Zalmay Khalilzad, to appear before the committee.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cI want to be clear: I do not consider your testimony at this hearing optional,\u201d Engel wrote in a letter dated Thursday. \u201cYour appearance before this committee in an open setting is essential to our ability to carry out our oversight responsibilities.\u201d\n\nThe New York Democrat added: \u201cIf this letter is insufficient to secure your attendance, I will consider other options that would ensure this hearing takes place in a timely manner.\u201d\n\nAccording to the letter, members of the committee have invited Khalilzad to appear at least two times prior: A Feb. 26 invitation from Engel and the top Republican on the committee, Rep. Mike McCaul of Texas; and an April 8 invitation from every Democratic member of the committee.\n\nKhalilzad did not respond to either request, according the letter. And neither the State Department nor a spokesman for Khalilzad immediately responded on Thursday to a request for comment.\n\nThe envoy has held a series of meetings with representatives of the Taliban militia over the past several months. A draft peace proposal has been put together that envisions a drawdown of the U.S. troop presence in Afghanistan.\n\nThe U.S invaded Afghanistan after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, overthrowing the Taliban-led government while going after al-Qaida terrorists. Around 14,000 U.S. troops are now serving in the Muslim-majority country.\n\nKhalilzad\u2019s efforts to reach a deal with the Taliban has raised many concerns across Washington, on a bipartisan level, about the implications of a U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan.\n\nThere are fears that after the deal is struck, the Taliban will essentially knock out the elected, U.S.-backed Afghan government and allow the country to once again be a safe haven for terrorist groups.\n\n\u201cAfter nearly two decades of war, we all want to see the fighting in Afghanistan come to an end,\u201d Engel wrote in the letter. \u201cBut we want to make sure we are negotiating a peace and not simply a withdrawal.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump has long wanted to get U.S. troops out of Afghanistan, but he\u2019s also recently said that several thousand troops may have to stay, possibly to serve as a counterterrorism force.", "description": "House Foreign Affairs Chairman Eliot Engel wants to hold hearings on a potential peace agreement with the Taliban that would reduce U.S. troop presence.", "authors": ["Nahal Toosi"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/d5/bb/1b912972408da50bc1730db6be5d/190905-eliot-engel-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
