Hundreds of thousands of Shiites flock to the city every year to commemorate his martyrdom.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of the residents in Karbala and the city's security forces are Shiite.\n\nThe demonstrations are fuelled by anger at corruption, economic stagnation and poor public services.\n\nDespite its vast oil wealth, Iraq suffers from high unemployment and crumbling infrastructure, with frequent power outages that force many to rely on private generators.\n\nThe protests have grown and demonstrators are calling for sweeping changes, not just the government's resignation. Prime minister Adel Abdel-Mahdi has promised a government reshuffle and a reform package, which the demonstrators have already rejected.\n\nAn Iraqi soldier covers his face from tear gas during anti-government protests in the Shiite shrine city of Karbala\n\nAuthorities on Monday announced a curfew from midnight to 6am in Baghdad, as renewed protests there and across the south raged.
