Ford is way behind schedule, over budget, and still a ways from fixing the weapons elevators that were expected to be finished by the time the first-in-class ship leaves Norfolk Naval Shipyard at the end of its post-shakedown availability (PSA) later this month.\n\nThe Advanced Weapons Elevators required to move weapons to the flight deck quickly to facilitate higher sortie rates for increased lethality have been problems for years.\n\nThe secretary of the Navy said last year the elevators would be ready to go by the time the ship pulled out of the shipyard at the conclusion of its PSA, a maintenance period initially expected to end in July but delayed until the end of October. That is not going to happen.\n\nRead more: Trump's Navy secretary bet his job on getting a critical supercarrier weapon system to work. The Navy says it won't be ready in time\n\n\"We certified and turned over to the crew three elevators. A fourth one is very close,\" James Guerts, Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Research, Development and Acquisition, told Business Insider on Tuesday after a congressional hearing on ship and maintenance matters, adding that the Navy has managed to get seven of the eleven elevators moving.\n\nThe operational elevators go to the hangar bay, but the Navy is still struggling to ready the lower elevators that provide access to the ammunition and magazines on the lower levels.\n\nAs to what the problem is, Guerts stressed that this is not a technology issue, but rather a construction issue.\n\nThe Navy will continue to work on the elevators over the next 18 months. The challenge, however, will be feathering in the necessary work as the ship is at sea.\n\nEven as the service works to sort out the remaining problems on its carrier \u2014 now billions of dollars over budget with a total cost of roughly $13 billion \u2014 Navy leadership admitted before the Readiness Subcommittee of the House Armed Services Committee that the ship will deploy years behind schedule, although it remains hopeful it will be able to field this new platform sooner.\n\nWhile it was thought that the Ford might have full operational capability and be ready to deploy in 2021, only three years late, an exchange between Vice Adm. Tom Moore, commander of Naval Sea Systems Command, and Rep. Elaine Luria, a Democrat from Virginia, revealed that it may be much later.\n\n\"The original deployment was 2018, a year ago, and the best estimates we're looking at 2024, six years past that?\" she asked.\n\n\"I think we'll beat that,\" Moore said, later telling Business Insider that the final deployment date for the Ford is something still being worked out with the chief of naval operations.\n\n\"We're trying to pull it as far back to the left as we can,\" Moore told Luria, who characterized the Ford as a \"$13-billion nuclear-powered floating berthing barge\" during Tuesday's hearing.", "description": "The aircraft carrier USS Gerald R.
