According to his tweet, he and his family had been forced to evacuate their Brentwood home and were driving around trying to find a place to stay.\n\nMan these LA \ud83d\udd25 aren\u2019t no joke. Had to emergency evacuate my house and I\u2019ve been driving around with my family trying to get rooms. No luck so far! \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2642\ufe0f \u2014 LeBron James (@KingJames) October 28, 2019\n\nWhile the destructive wildfires in Northern California have been in the news over the past few days, the fire that\u2019s affecting James, his family and thousands of others is a brush fire near the Getty Center museum in Los Angeles. High winds and low humidity have caused the fire to spread, leading to the evacuation order that covers James\u2019 neighborhood.\n\nDespite the seriousness of the situation, people had jokes for James about him leaving his hometown Cleveland for LA, because of course they did.\n\nCleveland doesnt catch on fire. \u2014 Mr. Susan (@aaronfelix14) October 28, 2019\n\nCleveland's river literally caught fire because of how polluted it is \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80 \u2014 Joseph Chavez (@lil_CarneAsada) October 28, 2019\n\nThankfully, James and his family did end up finding a place to crash, which he tweeted about just after 4am in LA.\n\nFinally found a place to accommodate us! Crazy night man! \u2014 LeBron James (@KingJames) October 28, 2019\n\nHe also tweeted wishes for the safety of those affected, and gave thanks to the first responders who are undoubtedly working very hard all around California to manage the fires.\n\nI \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe for all the families in the area that could be affected by these \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25 now!
