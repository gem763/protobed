Apple usually positions itself as offering the most high-end, highly designed products, but its streaming service especially appears headed a different way, including an offer of one free year of Apple TV+ to buyers of new iPhones, iPads, Macs and Apple TVs.\n\nFull story: Apple drops price on new iPhone 11, undercuts Netflix and Disney on streaming\n\nThe news immediately hit the stocks of streaming rivals such as Netflix Inc. NFLX, -2.16% , Roku Inc. ROKU, -10.49% and Walt Disney Co. DIS, -2.19% . Netflix\u2019s entry-level streaming costs $8.99 a month, and Disney plans to charge $6.99 a month for its Disney+ streaming service that launches later this year. Roku has a free Roku Channel and lots of free content, but charges separately for premium channel subscriptions. Apple\u2019s TV+ will debut Nov. 1 on the Mac and some Samsung smart TVs, and on Amazon.com\u2019s AMZN, -0.59% Fire TV, Roku, LG, Sony and Vizio platforms at some point in the future, it said.\n\nThe lower price is likely both an admission from Apple that it can\u2019t compete with the libraries of content that Netflix and Disney have built, and a play to amass users while it adds that needed content to the service.\n\n\u201cThe Street was anticipating a $7.99-$9.99 price point, as clearly Cupertino is looking for market share coming out of the gates with these surprising price points that we loudly applaud,\u201d said Dan Ives, a Wedbush Securities analyst, in a note. He added that he believes Apple has the opportunity to gain 100 million consumers on the streaming front in the next three to four years.\n\nOn top of the low cost for its streaming services, Apple also offered a low price for its entry-level iPhone at $699, $50 below what many analysts were expecting, clearly an effort to boost its sagging iPhone growth. Last quarter Apple saw iPhone sales fall nearly 12%, but attributed a better-than-expected performance in China to pricing and trade-in deals that showed it can succeed through lower prices.\n\n\u201cWe think the lower iPhone 11 price point and trade-in program will help promote upgrades, specifically in China, while the Apple Arcade and TV+ offerings will help accelerate services growth,\u201d said Angelo Zino, a CFRA analyst, in a note to clients.\n\nPatrick Moorhead of Moor Insights & Strategy, however, believes that the lack of a 5G modem option in the iPhone 11 will hurt sales in China.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: Apple\u2019s iPhone 11 design is getting people worked up in all the wrong ways\n\nApple is taking a risk with its lower prices: The costs for producing top-tier content are very high, as Netflix investors have seen for years. Netflix has been warning investors about new rivals in the streaming business for the past few quarters, and spends billions each year on content licensing, as well as developing its own content. In its most recent quarter, Netflix said its streaming content obligations were $18.5 billion, which it funds with debt.\n\nIf Apple is willing to lose money on its streaming ambitions, it will need to make that up through iPhone sales, but the lower price on the iPhone 11 could hurt the margins on its biggest moneymaker, especially if tariffs take effect on smartphones. Combined, the two decisions bring up many questions about Apple\u2019s margin profile in the future, which Cook will undoubtedly face questions about from investors and analysts.\n\nApple clearly needs some big hits on Apple TV+ in order to increase its price, as Netflix has done repeatedly after attracting millions of users. Until it does, the new normal could see Apple adding more customers to its iEcosystem, but subtracting from its healthy profit margins.", "description": "One of the most surprising elements of Apple Inc.\u2019s September iPhone launch was its aggressive pricing on many products, especially its new streaming service.", "authors": ["Therese Poletti"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR046_iphone_ZG_20190910172954.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
