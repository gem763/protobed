Those arguing for the removal from Incirlik note that although the bombs do not appear to be in imminent danger of theft or unauthorized use, the risks of storing the weapons in Turkey have nevertheless increased significantly. They also note that maintaining the status quo is unacceptable in light of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s anti-U.S. rhetoric and actions.\n\nIn an Oct. 14 tweet, Richard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations and former State Department official in the George W. Bush administration, said the United States \u201cshould remove nukes from Turkey\u201d and \u201creduce dependence on use of its bases.\u201d Turkey under Erdogan is an \u201cally in name only,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to open-source estimates, the United States may store as many as 50 B61 gravity bombs at Incirlik. Those make up one-third of the approximately 150 nuclear weapons thought to be housed in five nations in Europe as part of NATO\u2019s nuclear sharing arrangements.\n\nThe original rationale for deploying U.S. nuclear weapons in Europe was to deter and, if necessary, defeat a large-scale attack by the Soviet Union. Since the end of the Cold War, the United States has drastically reduced the number of weapons on the continent, but still deploys a smaller number to extend deterrence to NATO allies and as a political signal of the U.S. commitment to the security of alliance members.\n\nThe Defense and Energy departments are in the process of an extensive rebuilding of the B61, at a cost that may exceed $10 billion. (See ACT, November 2016.)\n\nUnlike the other bases in Europe that host U.S. B61s, Incirlik does not have dedicated nuclear-capable fighter aircraft that can deliver the weapons. Moreover, Turkey does not train its pilots to fly nuclear missions. In the event NATO were to make a decision to use the weapons now stored in Turkey, the United States or another NATO member would fly its own aircraft to pick them up.\n\nAs a matter of policy, the Defense Department does not comment on the presence of nuclear weapons in Turkey or anywhere else in Europe. The Air Force, in its fiscal year 2015 budget request, noted the presence of \u201cspecial weapons\u201d at \u201cstorage sites in Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and Turkey.\u201d Since 2000, NATO has invested $80 million in \u201cinfrastructure improvements\u201d and as of 2014 planned to invest an additional $154 million \u201cfor security improvements.\u201d\n\nThe security environment has raised concerns. In March 2016, the U.S. military ordered the families of U.S. military personnel to leave southern Turkey, primarily from Incirlik, due to terrorist activity in Turkey and the conflict in nearby Syria.\n\nIn July 2016, following a failed coup attempt, the Turkish government arrested several high-ranking Turkish military officers at Incirlik and cut power to the base for nearly a week. In the year since, Erdogan has cracked down on opposition groups and independent media and strengthened ties with Russia. In addition, Turkey has arrested several U.S. citizens accused of abetting the coup and in October detained a Turkish employee at the U.S. consulate in Istanbul.\n\nOther NATO members also have had troubled relations with Turkey recently. For example, Germany in July removed its soldiers from Incirlik after Ankara refused to allow German lawmakers to visit the troops at the base.\n\nThe presumed presence of U.S. nuclear bombs raises the stakes. A former senior NATO official told Stars and Stripes in July that \u201cif there are nuclear weapons stored in Turkey, they should be removed given the instability, both in the country and across the border in Syria and Iraq.\u201d If removed, the weapons could be sent back to the United States or to another country in Europe that has the requisite facilities to store B61s and aircraft capable of delivering them.\n\nSo far, neither the United States nor NATO\u2019s military command have given any indication that withdrawal of the weapons has been seriously considered. Leaders of the 28 member countries of NATO, at their July 2016 summit meeting in Warsaw, reaffirmed the security role played by U.S. nuclear weapons deployed in Europe. (See ACT, September 2016.)\n\nJames Townsend, former deputy assistant secretary of defense for European and NATO policy during the Obama administration, told Arms Control Today in an Oct. 23 interview that decisions about U.S. force posture in Europe should not be impacted by \u201cthe politics of the day.\u201d\n\nThe United States should not pursue a unilateral change to NATO\u2019s nuclear posture \u201cdue to politics or even military expediency unless we do so with the Russians giving us something in return,\u201d he added.\n\nNATO may fear that removing the weapons from Incirlik not only would raise questions about the alliance\u2019s commitment to Turkey\u2019s security, likely exacerbating current political tensions, but also prompt uncomfortable debates about the merits of nuclear sharing inside the other host nations.\n\nIndeed, the deployment of U.S. B61s is controversial in some of these countries.\n\nFor instance, Martin Schulz, the German Social Democratic candidate for chancellor, said in August that were he to win the Sept. 24 election, he would advocate for the removal of the estimated 20 B61s stored in Germany. Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s Christian Democratic Union party ultimately prevailed, but the Social Democrats remain the second-largest political party in Germany.\n\nIn an article urging the withdrawal of all U.S. nuclear weapons from Europe published in the journal Survival in September, Steve Andreasen, a former White House official in the Clinton administration, argued that continuing \u201cNATO\u2019s nuclear status quo will come at an increasingly high financial and political cost, and high security risk.\u201d\n\nRecent developments involving Turkey highlight \u201cthe need for NATO to move to a safer, more secure and more credible nuclear deterrent\u2014including withdrawing, and not replacing, U.S. tactical nuclear weapons in Europe,\u201d he wrote.\u2014KINGSTON REIF", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2017-11-15"}
