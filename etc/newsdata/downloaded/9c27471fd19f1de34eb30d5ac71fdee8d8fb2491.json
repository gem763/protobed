CLICK HERE to subscribe to the newsletter.\n\nTHE TOPLINE: The Pentagon on Wednesday released new images and video of the weekend raid that killed ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, adding to the picture of the terrorist's final moments.\n\nU.S. Central Command (Centcom) chief Marine Corps Gen. Kenneth McKenzie said the mission, which he ordered to commence from Centcom headquarters in Tampa, Fla., began around 9 a.m. eastern time Saturday.\n\nOffering new details of the raid, McKenzie spoke as reporters at the Pentagon were shown the videos of the special operations team assaulting al-Baghdadi's compound and the strikes on the facility afterward.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nA video was first shown of the assault force's arrival at the compound \u2013 described as an area not traditionally operated in by U.S. forces and roughly an hour flight from the U.S. staging base in Syria.\n\nFighters from two locations can be seen gathering to fire on U.S. aircraft. Though the individuals were not assessed to be affiliated with al-Baghdadi, \"they demonstrated a hostile intent against U.S. forces and were killed by two airstrikes from supporting helicopters,\" McKenzie said as the strike was shown.\n\nCongress gets briefed: The House and Senate were also briefed on the raid by defense and intelligence officials Wednesday.\n\nAfter the House briefing, Speaker Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiOvernight Defense: House approves Turkey sanctions in rebuke of Trump | Trump attacks on Army officer testifying spark backlash | Dems want answers from Esper over Ukraine aid Mark Mellman: Three questions for Republicans White House: Democrats' resolution shows impeachment is 'illegitimate sham' MORE (D-Calif.) said the Trump administration still owes the House a briefing on the situation in northern Syria with Turkey.\n\n\"We had asked for a briefing on Syria, they wanted to give us a briefing on al-Baghdadi,\" she told reporters after the briefing. \"We welcomed that, and we congratulate our forces that did that so successfully. We still want the briefing on Syria and Turkey.\"\n\nAsked if the briefers at the classified session were unprepared to answer questions on Syria and Turkey, Pelosi said she \"can't go into what happened in there.\"\n\n\"But again, let's say on the plus side, the briefing on al-Baghdadi is something that we congratulate our forces for doing so successfully,\" she said.\n\nAsked if the broader Syria and Turkey briefing has been scheduled yet, Pelosi said, \"They said it will be.\"\n\nTODAY'S IMPEACHMENT UPDATE: Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan told lawmakers Wednesday he was aware of a \"campaign\" against the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine by President Trump Donald John TrumpNumber of uninsured children rises for second year, tops 4 million Trump moment from White House Halloween trick-or-treat event goes viral White House official says transcript of Ukraine call omitted key phrases: report MORE's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani Rudy GiulianiTrump attacks on Vindman trigger backlash AP: Saudi tycoon donated to Obama inauguration through a middleman House committees ask key Mulvaney aide for testimony in impeachment inquiry MORE over the summer, corroborating parts of the ex-ambassador's private testimony in the impeachment inquiry.\n\n\"My knowledge in the spring and summer of this year about any involvement of Mr. Giuliani was in connection with a campaign against our ambassador to Ukraine,\" Sullivan said under questioning from Sen. Bob Menendez Robert (Bob) MenendezTurkey sanctions face possible wall in GOP Senate Paul blocks Senate vote on House-passed Syria resolution House to vote on resolution condemning Trump's Syria pullback MORE (D-N.J.) during his confirmation hearing to serve as the U.S. ambassador to Russia.\n\nMarie Yovanovitch, who was ousted as U.S ambassador to Ukraine in late April, told House lawmakers in closed-door testimony earlier this month that Sullivan informed her she was recalled from her position in Ukraine because Trump had lost confidence in her.\n\nYovanovitch also said that she was told by Sullivan that there had been a \"concerted campaign\" against her since Summer 2018 but that she had done nothing wrong, according to her written opening statement.\n\nPressed Wednesday on the details surrounding Yovanovitch's dismissal, Sullivan repeated that it was because the president had lost confidence in her. He added that he asked why that was the case, and was not given a specific reason.\n\n\"My experience has been that when the president loses confidence in an ambassador, no matter what the reason, that the president's confidence in his ambassador in a capital is the coin of the realm, the most important thing for that ambassador,\" Sullivan told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n\nMeanwhile, in the House: A foreign service officer assigned to the White House says former GOP Rep. Robert Livingston (La.), now a powerful lobbyist, repeatedly urged that Yovanovitch be fired, according to a copy of the officer's opening statement obtained by The Hill.\n\nThe officer, Catherine Croft, is testifying Wednesday behind closed doors to lawmakers on three panels running the House impeachment inquiry.\n\nIn her testimony, Croft says that Livingston, who nearly became the Speaker in 1998 after then-Speaker Newt Gingrich Newton (Newt) Leroy GingrichMORE (R-Ga.) stepped down, repeatedly pressed her to fire Yovanovitch when she worked for the National Security Council.\n\n\"During my time at the NSC, I received multiple calls from lobbyist Robert Livingston, who told me that Ambassador Yovanovitch should be fired,\" her opening statement says.\n\n\"He characterized Ambassador Yovanovitch as an 'Obama holdover' and associated with George Soros,\" Croft's statement says. \"It was not clear to me at the time -- or now -- at whose direction or at whose expense Mr. Livingston was seeking the removal of Ambassador Yovanovitch.\"\n\nBolton on tap?: House investigators on Wednesday invited former national security adviser John Bolton John BoltonThe Hill's Morning Report - Presented by Better Medicare Alliance - Dems shift strategy on impeachment vote Judge schedules hearing for ex-Trump aide who refused to appear in inquiry Ex-Trump official's refusal to testify escalates impeachment tensions MORE to give a voluntary deposition next week as part of Democrats' impeachment inquiry, in what could be key testimony on Trump's contacts with Ukraine.\n\nDemocrats are seeking Bolton's closed-door testimony on Nov. 7, according to a source familiar with the impeachment proceedings, a move that comes following reports that his lawyers are negotiating with three House committees about possibly testifying.\n\nA lawyer for Bolton did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether his client intends to testify. And a spokesman for the House Intelligence Committee declined to confirm whether the Bolton hearing is expected to proceed as scheduled.\n\nWhile Democrats have said for weeks they want to hear from Bolton, Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff Adam Bennett SchiffSondland emerges as key target after Vindman testimony White House: Democrats' resolution shows impeachment is 'illegitimate sham' House votes to recognize Armenian genocide MORE (D-Calif.) fixed a spotlight on his possible testimony on Sunday.\n\n\"Obviously he has very relevant information and we do want him to come in and testify,\" Schiff said on ABC's \"This Week,\" calling Bolton a \"very important\" witness.\n\nThe Intelligence chairman also said he believes the White House will seek to block Bolton from testifying.\n\nAmid the House investigation into Trump's controversial dealings with Ukraine, Democrats now see the military hawk as a potential star witness -- one whose intimate knowledge of the Ukraine affair could expose more evidence of wrongdoing by the president.\n\nBolton is someone who was involved in some of the most explosive events related to Trump's contacts with Kiev, but it's unclear whether the longtime Republican stalwart would defend Trump's actions or paint the president's efforts to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to open an investigation into political rivals as an abuse of power.\n\nMORE SULLIVAN: Though Sullivan's confirmation hearing largely revolved around the impeachment allegations, he did get asked about another pressing foreign policy issue: the Open Skies Treaty.\n\nSullivan told senators he has been assured the United States has not withdrawn from the Open Skies Treaty after hearing rumors to the contrary.\n\n\"There would need to be substantial evidence to support the national security interest for withdrawal from that treaty, and there would need to be consultations with this committee, with Congress and, in particular, with our NATO allies and the other countries that are members of the treaty,\" Sullivan.\n\nAt the hearing, Sen. Ed Markey Edward (Ed) John MarkeySanders touts Ocasio-Cortez endorsement in new Iowa ad Sunrise Movement organizer: Sanders, Warren boast strongest climate change plans Ocasio-Cortez points to California fires: 'This is what climate change looks like' MORE (D-Mass.) said he \"has received information that before John Bolton resigned, President Trump may have made a decision to exit the Open Skies Treaty.\"\n\nSullivan told Markey he \"heard those same rumors\" and, after asking the White House about them, was assured the United States has not withdrawn from the treaty.\n\n\"To my knowledge, the United States has not withdrawn from the Open Skies Treaty,\" he said. \"In fact, the United States this month is chairing the Open Skies Consultative Commission.\"\n\nThe issue: The fate of the Open Skies Treaty has become a growing concern among Democrats.\n\nThe treaty, which has been in effect since 2002, allows the pact's 34 signatories to fly unarmed observation flights over the entire territory of other signatories. The intention is to increase transparency and reduce the risk of military miscalculation.\n\nPrior to his ouster, Bolton urged Trump to sign a document signaling his intent to withdraw from the treaty, according to The Wall Street Journal. Trump signed it, the Journal reported, citing two unidentified U.S. officials.\n\nUnder the terms of the treaty, a withdrawal requires a formal notice to the other signatories. The notice kicks off a six-month withdrawal period.\n\nON TAP FOR TOMORROW\n\nSen.
