Kalki Koechlin has always been someone who has chosen to live her life on her own terms. Be it choosing projects she felt intuitive about or choosing pregnancy out of wedlock.\n\nJust a few weeks ago, she officially shared the news of her pregnancy. The picture she shared took over the internet and they went viral for all the right reasons. Sharing the news of her pregnancy, she said she was feeling relieved that she does not have to hide her baby bump under layers of clothes.\n\nIn a recent interview, Kalki was quizzed if she was ready to face world and trolls who would impose their judgement on her decision of choosing the baby. Talking about her pregnancy and fighting the stigma attached to being an unmarried mother, Kalki said,\n\nDon't Miss 42 K SHARES 48 K SHARES 21.3 K SHARES 8.1 K SHARES 3.6 K SHARES\n\n\"I think I was a little nervous about the first announcement, but I also knew that these were going to be judgments that are going to come up. Only on social media, of course, you have your trolls. So like where\u2019s the husband? How can you do this? And you know, like don\u2019t wear tight clothes, don\u2019t show your belly and all that stuff. So that. That comes with my territory. I\u2019ve been used to doing that for the last 10 years with just being a celebrity. So I am okay. I\u2019m okay right now.\"\n\nShe also expressed that people are supportive and welcoming towards her decision of welcoming the baby in the world now.", "description": "There are actors who make rules and there are some to break a few.
