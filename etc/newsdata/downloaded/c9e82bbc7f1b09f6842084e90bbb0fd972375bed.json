It\u2019s trademarked, it\u2019s on merch, don\u2019t try me.\n\n\u2018Sometimes I feel like people do that stuff on purpose, like \u201cLet me use Jeffree\u2019s thing and then he\u2019ll cause a stir about it and I\u2019ll get a lot more views and subscribers.\u201d\n\n\u2018I\u2019m like b***h, I\u2019m not even gonna mention your name. Don\u2019t even bother searching for it after you hear this because we don\u2019t wanna give no one any clout.\n\n\u2018Thank god for lawyers. It\u2019s all draining. Why can\u2019t people just come up with their own f**king ideas.\u2019\n\nMichelle deleted her entire series of \u2018approved\u2019 videos, and issued an apology to Jeffree on social media, saying: \u2018Jeffree Star is one of the few YouTube gurus I watch and look up to in the YouTube community.\n\n\u2018Recently I uploaded 2 new videos in my youtube channel which was the \u201cMD Approved New Series\u201d inspired by Jeffree.\u2019\n\nShe continued: \u2018I was unaware that this \u201cJeffree Star Approved\u201d series is copyrighted in America.\n\n\u2018I would like to take this opportunity to sincerely apologise to Jeffree Star if in any way or another, I may have violated your rights from the use of your trademark.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Videos from my channel has been deleted already and rest-assured that it will not happen again. Again, I am sorry.\u2019\n\nWhile it looked like that beef had been put to bed, it seems Jeffree is not one to forgive and forget that easily\u2026\n\nGot a showbiz story?
