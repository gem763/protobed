He presented problems at home that any other parent would have found impossible to deal with.\n\n\"You stuck by James through thick and thin.\n\n\"So preoccupied and overwhelmed were you by his difficulties that you failed to appreciate how your own mental health had been affected.\n\n\"All parents are forgiving. You had to forgive an awful lot in terms of the disruptive and often upsetting behaviour of your son.\n\n\"He treated you very badly and failed to appreciate how much you cared for him.\"\n\nThe troubled son had longstanding issues with alcohol, resulting in frequent verbal argument with his mum.\n\nShortly after Bywater attacked James, she was heard shouting with blood on her hands and the kitchen floor at about 2pm.\n\nShe called the police saying she had stabbed her son and herself, said prosecutor Rachel Masters.\n\nMr Bywater\u2019s puncture wounds were cleaned and closed at hospital.\n\nHe later said he did not want his mother prosecuted, and died shortly after from \"matters entirely unrelated to this incident\".\n\nWhen Bywater, of Westfield Court, Redcar, was detained she denied attempted murder.\n\nShe was formally acquitted of this charge after the prosecution accepted her guilty plea to the lesser charge of unlawful wounding - her first conviction.\n\nZahra Baqri, defending, said the sleep-deprived mum acted impulsively amid serious depression when she saw her son drinking heavily.\n\nShe said: \u201cShe flipped when she saw the state that her son was in. She said he was killing himself with alcohol abuse.\n\n\"She proceeded to cut her own arm. She told doctors she wanted to frighten her son in a desperate attempt for him to stop drinking.\"\n\nMental health agencies and support workers who tried to help Mr Byswater fight his drug and alcohol addictions were unsuccessful.\n\nMs Baqri added: \"The defendant did everything to help him. She was a dedicated mother, so much so that she hardly found time for herself.\n\n\"The cause of James' passing was as a direct consequence of his addictions.\"\n\nIn the days leading up to the incident, Bywater had sought \u2018refuge\u2019 in her bedroom and was referred to the crisis team by her GP.\n\nShe had serious depressive episodes and suicidal thoughts as she was \u2018unable to cope\u2019.\n\nBut a consultant psychiatrist assessed her as very low risk of reoffending.\n\nJudge Ashurst ruled the case as \u2018exceptional\u2019 where the mother had reacted to extreme circumstances.\n\nHe told Bywater: \"You took a knife to James at a time when your levels of despair were especially high.\n\n\"You did not intend to kill him and although you bitterly regret picking up that kitchen knife, the injuries you caused in wounding James were not particularly serious.\n\n\"I make it clear to you that I'm not going to order you to return to custody today.\"\n\nBywater was given a one-year prison sentence suspended for 18 months with 24 days\u2019 rehabilitation activity \"to assist you in rebuilding your life after this very traumatic event\".\n\nIf you need to speak to someone, Samaritans are available 24/7 on 116 123 or by emailing jo@samaritans.org", "description": "Jacqueline Bywater, 58 and from Redcar, lashed out after years of trying to help her son who was verbally abusive and stole from her", "authors": ["Gareth Lightfoot", "Image", "Google"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20578950.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_JS190673101.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
