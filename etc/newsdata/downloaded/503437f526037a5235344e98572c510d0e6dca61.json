Except that in her case, life did not allow her the comforts, which many have become accustomed to. And then, the unbelievable happened. Mhatre became an overnight stand-up comedy sensation and is now a known face in the circle. For someone who toiled in others\u2019 homes as a maid, sold imitation jewellery on Mumbai\u2019s local trains to support three children and ailing husband, it can be best described as a fortunate stroke of serendipity. But that would not do justice to her story.Mhatre turned her life around solely on her will to succeed and the passion for making people laugh. \u201cIt was a tough routine existence. I used to wake up in the wee hours to get on the first local at 4:30 am to sell imitation jewellery and then proceed towards Malad, where I worked as a cook in a housing society. After that I would replenish the jewellery stock and get home by 5:00 pm and start preparing for the next day,\u201d says Mhatre, who used to occasionally crack jokes at home or with her employers to entertain them. \u201cIt was mostly because I enjoyed the comedy genre but to become a stand-up comedian was never part of my plan,\u201d she adds.Things took a U-turn, however, when Mhatre\u2019s ex-employer organised a small get-together for all the maids and the drivers of the society. \u201cThat\u2019s where I performed the first time, impromptu. A reporter from one of the dailies spotted me and published an interview. She also told renowned stand-up comedian Aditi Mittal about my talent, who approached me and insisted that I try my hand at stand-up. I am grateful to her for the opportunity! She mentored me through the process, offering me a chance to polish my act. That\u2019s how I embarked on this journey,\u201d Mhatre reminisces.Her jokes are a sharp critique on people\u2019s apathy towards their domestic help and workforce, while also taking subtle digs at patriarchal practices like observing Karva Chauth. \u201cI write my own jokes based on personal experiences and I want to continue creating content that the public can relate to. I have had people tell me after a show that they realised how insensitive they were at times towards their house help and have consciously tried to improve their attitude,\u201d says Mhatre, who feels she hasn\u2019t really ruffled too many feathers by her candid sketches.With punch lines like \u201cYahaan insaan ke liye daya kam aur sticker ke liye izzat zyada hoti hain,\u201d (People have no compassion for human beings, but have immense respect for price tags) that mock people\u2019s slavery to branded goods sold at malls, Mhatre feels this is her way of pointing out certain flaws plaguing the society. \u201cMy ex-employers have encouraged me to focus on stand-up because they feel I am able to raise a voice on issues, and usher in change in my own little way. I was fortunate to have good employers but my friends weren\u2019t so lucky and faced discrimination,\u201d she says.And how does she motivate herself and overcome challenges? Was there a point when she had any inhibitions? Mhatre quips, \u201cWhen you have travelled enough in Mumbai locals, I think nothing can intimidate you. Hard work never scared me either, and I always tell people there is no shame in doing any kind of work. No task is big or small. I had no option because I was the sole breadwinner back then, and I wanted to send my children to English medium schools.\u201dMhatre\u2019s daughters are now 22, 20, and 15; and she really wishes for at least one of them to pursue this field. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think they are as funny as I am. They just can\u2019t make people laugh,\u201d she points out and goes on to say, \u201cThe days of working as a maid are far behind me now and I wish to focus on this forever. The love and adulation from the audiences have helped me become more determined to pursue it with full force.\u201d", "description": "Meet Deepika Mhatre whose journey from being a domestic help to stand-up comedian is remarkable and inspiring", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://femina.wwmindia.com/content/2019/oct/deepika-mhatre-sm-thumb1570426990.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
