The Biden boys and their father had been through hell together. Hunter has said his first memory was waking up in the hospital next to his older brother, Beau, after the car crash that killed their mother and baby sister. He grew up to be a troubled man, his life pockmarked by addiction and failure.\n\nBeau died of brain cancer a few months before Biden traveled to Ukraine to push the government to crack down on corruption. It\u2019s not shocking that, at a moment when his family was consumed by grief, Biden wasn\u2019t inclined to confront his surviving son.\n\nBut even if you\u2019re not inclined to empathize with Biden \u2014 even if you assume the worst about him \u2014 Trump\u2019s conspiracy theory makes no sense. To believe it, you\u2019d have to first believe that the foreign affairs apparatus of the Obama administration was willing to put its credibility on the line in service of the black sheep of the Biden family. After all, Joe Biden wasn\u2019t freelancing in Ukraine; he was carrying out White House policy.\n\nFurther, if the Trump administration truly believes that Obama\u2019s Ukraine policy was crooked, one might ask why it has Pyatt, who helped accomplish that policy, representing America as ambassador to Greece.\n\nMost important, getting rid of Shokin made an investigation of Burisma more likely, not less. \u201cHe didn\u2019t want to investigate Burisma,\u201d the Ukrainian anti-corruption activist Daria Kaleniuk told The Washington Post. \u201cShokin was fired not because he wanted to do that investigation, but quite to the contrary, because he failed that investigation.\u201d\n\nHowever bad the optics around Hunter Biden, Joe Biden was not serving his son\u2019s interests. If anything, they were working at cross-purposes.", "description": "The president\u2019s accusations turn reality on its head and the media should say so.", "authors": ["Michelle Goldberg"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/30/opinion/30Goldberg1/30Goldberg1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
