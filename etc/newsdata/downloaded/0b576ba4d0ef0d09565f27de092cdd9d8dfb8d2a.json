The data included 16% who say they\u2019re not ready at all.\n\nThe survey comes amid uncertainty as the U.S. and China square off in a trade war that\u2019s entering its second year. Meanwhile, the 2008 financial crisis is still fresh in the minds of many Americans who lost jobs and burned through savings. Although the unemployment rate is now at a record 50 year low of 3.5%, economists are warning of slowing growth into 2020.\n\nThe news isn\u2019t all bleak, as some are taking modest steps to shore up their finances in case of a downturn. Bankrate found that nearly half (44%) of U.S. consumers are choosing to spend less money, while 33% are saving more for emergencies and 31% are paying down credit card debt.\n\nWoman eyeing shirt in clothing shop More\n\nMeanwhile, a slim 15% are saving for retirement, and 10% are looking for a better or more stable job, the firm found.\n\n\u201cThe steps that most people are taking are prudent steps in any environment. They\u2019re saving more and they\u2019re paying down credit card debt. If your household budget is tight or your income is stagnant, the only way to increase savings and pay down more credit card debt is spend less money,\u201d said Bankrate\u2019s chief financial analyst Greg McBride.\n\nSome of the data\u2019s findings reveal a generational split. Many millennials graduated college in the last recession to slim employment opportunities. According to Bankrate, that cohort is more likely than any other age group to be taking steps to secure their finances (at 74%), compared to 70% of Generation X, and 67% of baby boomers.\n\nStill, nearly a third of Americans (31%) aren\u2019t doing anything at all to prepare themselves for a recession, Bankrate found.\n\n\u201cAt first blush you\u2019d think that they must be the folks that are really buttoned up and fully prepared. And the fact is they admit to being even less prepared than the people that are taking steps to shore up their finances,\u201d McBride said \u2014 adding that \u201cwhat we\u2019re seeing is a sort of put your head in the sand mentality.\u201d\n\nSome 35% of the lowest earners \u2014 classified as those making under $30,000 a year \u2014 are taking no preventative measures in case of a recession, compared to 28% of those earning the most at over $80,000 a year.\n\nThe tendency to pay down credit card debt and save for retirement and emergencies rises with income level. When it comes to cutting back on spending, middle-income households earning $30,000 to $79,000 are more likely to do it compared to higher and lower-income households, the data found.\n\n\u201cA third of Americans saying that they\u2019re actively saving more for emergencies is a step in the right direction, regardless of what the economic path is ahead. If people have more savings and less debt, they\u2019re on more solid financial footing,\u201d says McBride.\n\nMore from Sibile:\n\nEric Trump: China is one of the reasons Donald Trump ran for president\n\nJobs report: Here\u2019s why you\u2019re not earning more despite record low unemployment\n\nWhy Wall Street may be \u2018way too sanguine\u2019 about Trump impeachment risks\n\nChina leveraging Trump impeachment \u2018desperation\u2019 in trade talks\n\nDemocratic lawmaker on Trump impeachment inquiry: \u2018We have no choice\u2019", "description": "Bankrate found that 4 in 10 of 2000 people surveyed would be under-prepared if growth turns negative in the next six to 12 months.
