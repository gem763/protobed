However, they like the convenience of ordering online and picking up in store.\n\n\"So we are seeing traffic and interaction and engagement with our brand continue to grow and I think it's that wonderful combination of great store experience and the suite of fulfillment capabilities that we are now offering that's driving great engagement and greater traffic visits to our stores and to our site,\" Cornell said.\n\nSeparately, Home Depot (HD) noted a 50% surge in all of its online orders picked up in store during the quarter.\n\nThe Nordstrom store is pictured in Broomfield, Colorado, February 23, 2017.REUTERS/Rick Wilking More\n\n\"While our stores remain the hub of our business, we know that many of our in-store sales are influenced by online visits and approximately 50% of all online U.S. orders were picked up in our stores during the quarter,\u201d CEO Craig Menear said on the call.\n\n\u201cOur customers continue to blend the channels of engagement, and we are investing to remove the friction as they do so,\" he added.\n\nPart of Home Depot's physical and digital strategy includes the rollout of automated pickup lockers for online orders. Over 1,100 stores with these lockers have seen their checkout scores increase 250 basis-points, versus the locations without the offering.\n\nWith all that in mind, a number of retail giants are ramping up delivery options to satisfy rising demand.\n\nThis summer, Nordstrom upped its available inventory for next day pickup, by offering seven times more selection in its Los Angeles area stores. This move resulted in sales from order pickup nearly tripling in the month of July.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, during the retailer's anniversary sale, transactions from pickup more than doubled, and nearly half of those customers used pickup for the first time. The customers who used order pickup doubled their overall spend, Nordstrom noted.\n\nGoing forward, the company intends to leverage its physical and digital assets in New York City, its largest market for online sales, with the opening of a flagship store and two local formats this fall.\n\n\u2014\n\nJulia La Roche is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.
