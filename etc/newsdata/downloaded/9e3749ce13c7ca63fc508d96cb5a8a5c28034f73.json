Police are investigating.", "language": "en", "text": "Their trendy downtown restaurant, which served up flatbreads and desserts, had been celebrated in as a symbol of Canada\u2019s tolerant, inclusive culture. It had welcomed tens of thousands of Syrian refugees with open arms, embracing them \u2014 and their cuisine \u2014 as their country was torn apart by war.\n\nThis week, the family behind the restaurant said they were closing over the death threats. Toronto police have opened an investigation, a spokesperson told The Washington Post.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHow that happened points to the cracks in that multicultural, harmonious image of Canada, ones that expose political divisions between left and right that are playing out through hateful rhetoric, heated protests and anonymous trolling on the Internet.\n\nThe Alsoufis, originally from Damascus, had left Syria behind over two decades ago for Saudi Arabia, where they ran a beachside resort in Jiddah. The patriarch, Husam, worked as a civil engineer, while his wife, Shahnaz, worked in special education.\n\nIn 2012, their daughter, Jala, moved to Canada to study architecture and psychology at the University of Toronto. Her parents and two brothers followed her three years later.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe were looking for a new home to hold us, and we couldn\u2019t find [anywhere] better than Canada to come,\u201d Husam said in a magazine interview in June. \u201cWe are starting our new life.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe family was unsatisfied with Canada\u2019s diluted versions of Middle Eastern food \u2014 halfhearted falafel and shawarma \u2014 and their parents were unable to put their Arabic degrees to use in their new city. So they decided to open a restaurant instead.\n\nIt was a family endeavor: Shahnaz ran the kitchen and Husam managed finances; Jala worked on marketing while their eldest son, Alaa, took care of the front-of-house. Ayham, a younger brother still in high school, was the taste tester.\n\nAD\n\nIn 2017, the family opened Soufi\u2019s in a white-walled storefront on Queen West, a fashionable strip in one of the coolest neighborhoods in the world. The restaurant was just as hip as it was Syrian, with brick walls and chalkboards covered in artifacts, photographs and writing in Arabic.\n\nThe Alsoufis said they hoped the restaurant would serve as a hub for Toronto\u2019s emergent Syrian community \u2014 while also introducing their new city, whose motto declares that \u201cdiversity is our strength,\u201d to the culture and cuisine of their home.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cSyrians are people. We\u2019re not just what they see in the news,\u201d Jala said in a video interview with Uber Eats. \u201cWe\u2019re more than that, and despite everything that\u2019s happening there, we are still a vibrant culture.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn particular, the restaurant placed an emphasis on hiring refugees, thousands of whom had been resettled in the Toronto area. Their familiarity with the cuisine proved key in the kitchen, which focused on two types of Syrian street food: manaeesh, a circular flatbread topped with crumbled halloumi, zaatar, or other vegetables and meat; and knafeh, a baked dessert of shredded phyllo dough and cheese doused in orange blossom syrup.\n\nEmployees wore yellow and black T-shirts displaying the Soufi\u2019s logo: From Syria, with Love.\n\n\u201c[It\u2019s] the whole idea of the restaurant \u2014 it\u2019s not only wars and problems that are happening there,\u201d Husam said. \u201cWe have a lot of love to give, and Syria is a very rich culture and rich cuisine. We want people to taste some of it.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe restaurant was an overnight success, heralded in a New York Times feature as the face of Toronto\u2019s growing passion for Syrian food. \u201cThe emergence of Syrian cooking illuminates an immigrant community\u2019s integration into the broader population, and the bridge that food can build to a new life,\u201d the article said.\n\nAll the while, as Soufi\u2019s rose to fame, Alaa became involved in local anti-fascist protests. He had already been involved in demonstrations in support of LGBTQ rights and opposing racism against migrants, the Toronto Star reported.\n\nAmid a long-shot campaign to gain influence in the Canadian Parliament, Maxime Bernier, a far-right member from Quebec, staged a fundraiser on Sept. 29 with the American political commentator Dave Rubin.\n\nAD\n\nBernier had broken off last year from the Conservative Party, to head up a new group that has since been linked to white supremacists. He has campaigned to cut immigration by more than half, railed against the \u201cglobalist agenda\u201d and declared an end to the era of \u201cpolitical correctness.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThat\u2019s what brought protesters outside his fundraiser, a talk on free speech in Canada, at a college about an hour outside of Toronto. Demonstrators hid their faces in bandannas and ski masks while carrying posters and chanting, \u201cNazi scum, off our streets.\u201d Four people were arrested.\n\nAmid the scuffle, a video was filmed of protesters shouting at and blocking Dorothy Marston, 81, as she tried to enter the venue on a walker. She eventually made it inside the event with the help of police. But almost instantly, the clip went viral.\n\nAD\n\nBernier called the protesters \u201cthugs.\u201d Marston, whom he later invited to a debate, said the protesters had interfered with her rights and made her feel like a criminal.\n\nCanada\u2019s free speech champion Dorothy and her husband Brian were our special guests at last night's Leaders' Debate.\n\n\n\nDorothy, notre championne canadienne de la libert\u00e9 d\u2019expression, et son mari Brian \u00e9taient nos invit\u00e9s sp\u00e9ciaux hier soir au d\u00e9bat des chefs. pic.twitter.com/Zxa1daM1bU \u2014 Maxime Bernier (@MaximeBernier) October 8, 2019\n\nAnd Alaa found himself doxed. A Twitter user identified him in an Oct. 1 tweet, labeling him one of the \u201cscumbags\u201d who had harassed Marston. His name and information spread across the Internet, retweeted by the likes of conservative pundit Ann Coulter, as did his ties to the restaurant.\n\nAD\n\nThreats began flooding into Soufi\u2019s Facebook page and email, including some that accused the family of \u201cterrorist actions.\u201d\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday, the Alsoufis admitted Alaa had been involved in the protests.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAlaa regrets the incident that occurred in Hamilton this past weekend,\u201d they said. \u201cThat said, he did not in any way verbally or physically assault the elderly woman and has nonetheless offered to apologize personally for not doing more.\u201d\n\nThe family said it was overwhelmed by death threats and other hate-filled messages, and on Sunday, Alaa had been physically assaulted. (Police haven\u2019t commented on this claim.) The attacks had proved to be so much that Soufi\u2019s would be closing permanently.\n\n\u201cWe could not put our family members, staff, and patrons in danger,\u201d the family said in a statement. \u201cThe magnitude of hate we are facing is overwhelming.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThis week, the white doors to the restaurant were shuttered, the windows covered in the yellow T-shirts reading, \u201cFrom Syria, with Love.\u201d Patrons and neighbors passed by to drop off flowers and leave messages of support to the family and restaurant, expressing shock at the violent messages directed toward the family.\n\n\u201cWe have the rule of law in Canada,\u201d one man told CityNews Toronto. \u201cWe don\u2019t issue death threats. This is not that kind of country.\u201d\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau wrote on Twitter on Tuesday, \u201cHatred and threats of violence have no place in Canada. We are always stronger together than when we\u2019re divided.\u201d\n\nHatred and threats of violence have no place in Canada. We are always stronger together than when we're divided. https://t.co/vnGmX1vts9 \u2014 Justin Trudeau (@JustinTrudeau) October 9, 2019\n\nEven the son of Marston, the elderly woman at the protest, condemned the attacks on the Alsoufi family in an interview with the Toronto Star.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m absolutely ashamed of anybody who called and threatened them. That\u2019s how polarized Canada is becoming. We have lost our ability to see reason,\u201d David Turkoski said. \u201cWe don\u2019t like war and persecution of anybody.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOn Wednesday, the family changed course, saying that it would reopen the restaurant after all.
