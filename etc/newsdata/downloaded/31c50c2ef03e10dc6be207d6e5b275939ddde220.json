The House of Representatives is not conducting a formal impeachment inquiry. To the contrary, congressional Democrats are conducting the 2020 political campaign.\u201d\n\nThat is exactly right. The dispiriting thing is that even now, even at this late date, they cannot acknowledge the obvious: Donald Trump won the 2016 election fair and square. He looks likely to win the 2020 election, too, something the Democrats also know but cannot countenance. Hence their round-the-clock effort to repeal the 2016 election, besmirch the president, and achieve \u201cby any means necessary\u201d the destruction of their political rival.\n\nIt used to be that politics involved compromise and accommodation. The Democrats have radicalized the process, declaring illegitimate anyone who is not themselves. It is profoundly anti-American as well as profoundly anti-democratic. We should all hope that they fail again in their effort to effect an anti-Trump coup, not because it is about Trump but because it is about the survival of our republic and \u201cwe the people\u201d who are supposed to be sovereign.", "description": "", "authors": ["Roger Kimball", "Amgreatness.Com Anti-Trump-Fraternity-And-Nevertrump-Sorority-Collude-In-Impeachment-Scam"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
