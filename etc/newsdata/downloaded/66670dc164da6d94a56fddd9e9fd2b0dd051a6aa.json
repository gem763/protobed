The film, directed by Matthew Michael Carnahan and produced by the Russos as the debut feature for their studio AGBO, tells the remarkable true story of the Nineveh SWAT Team\u2014an elite group of Iraqi soldiers fighting to reclaim their city from ISIS. It\u2019s akin to a more kinetic Black Hawk Down, minus the shitty politics and Ewan McGregor\u2019s mystifying accent.\n\nAs these are the Russo Brothers who rejuvenated the Marvel Cinematic Universe with Captain America: Winter Soldier, introduced Black Panther and Spider-Man to the MCU in Captain America: Civil War, and then closed out Phase Three in crowd-pleasing fashion with Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame, our talk eventually drifts to the news that Marvel has cut ties with Sony-owned Spidey, jettisoning the webslinger from any future Marvel films. Given how the Russos\u2014along with Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige\u2014fought tooth and nail to incorporate Tom Holland\u2019s Spider-Man into the MCU, they\u2019re sad to see him go, but enjoyed the ride.\n\n\u201cWe were extremely passionate about it. This is something we really wanted to happen, and fought a long time internally at Marvel to make it happen,\u201d Anthony Russo says of bringing Holland\u2019s Spider-Man into the fold.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy,\u201d adds Joe Russo. \u201cKevin [Feige] went through a lot. There were a lot of ups and downs, and he kept walking into our office and we\u2019d go, \u2018Look, we\u2019ve got to do it with [Sony],\u2019 and he\u2019d go, \u2018OK, I\u2019ll figure it out,\u2019 and walk back into his. He was looking for the way out. He wanted to open that door and have us go, \u2018We figured it out! We don\u2019t need Spider-Man!\u2019 because it\u2019s a lot of work to get two major corporations to play nice with each other, and the fact that it happened at all, we should all be dancing and celebrating that we got that little bit of time.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s why Joe and I are not so devastated or surprised that there\u2019s been a falling-out, because it was so hard to make it happen in the first place,\u201d offers Anthony Russo.\n\nThen there\u2019s the matter of Avengers: Endgame and its awards prospects. Since the film received rave reviews, and eclipsed Avatar as the highest-grossing movie ever, it stands to reason that there will be some Oscar chatter surrounding it\u2014even though it is a superhero blockbuster, a genre which, with the exception of Black Panther, hasn\u2019t exactly won over Academy voters.\n\nBut the Russos feel that awards pundits and voters often overlook just how difficult it is to make a big studio production like Endgame, employing thousands of workers and incorporating dozens of A-list movie stars in the service of a thrilling, large-scale film.\n\n\u201c I just want to stump for one thing, and that\u2019s Robert Downey. \u201d \u2014 Joe Russo\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly as difficult as it gets\u2014without question,\u201d says Joe Russo. \u201cOn a scale of 1-10, this is a 12. We\u2019ll say this: there certainly is a disconnect between the Academy and popular audiences. It started about 20 years ago. If you go back and look at the Academy Awards up until that point, they were in sync with popular audiences.\u201d\n\nMuch of the blame for this rests on the gross shoulders of Harvey Weinstein, who relentlessly harassed and manipulated Oscar voters into caping for his arthouse films under the Miramax banner\u2014many of which, e.g. Shakespeare in Love, Chicago, and The King\u2019s Speech, weren\u2019t worthy of the Best Picture Oscar.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what happened,\u201d chimes in Anthony Russo of Weinstein\u2019s influence. \u201cAnd to its credit, the Academy seems very focused on trying to champion smaller movies, which is awesome, but you don\u2019t want to have that be the only thing they try to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause then it just becomes an independent film festival, which we\u2019re all in support of, but if you want to draw an audience, and you have to draw an audience for the Oscars to keep working, then at some point you\u2019ve gotta listen to the audience,\u201d adds Joe Russo. \u201cWe don\u2019t make movies for awards. Yes, making this was exceedingly difficult. We made the two most expensive movies ever back-to-back. But I just want to stump for one thing, and that\u2019s Robert Downey.\u201d\n\nBoth the Russo Brothers believe that Downey Jr.\u2019s final turn as Tony Stark/Iron Man in Endgame is not only worthy of Academy Award consideration, but that he should win it.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if I have ever seen\u2014in movie history\u2014a global audience react to a performance the way they did to Robert Downey in that movie,\u201d claims Joe Russo. \u201cThere were people bawling in movie theaters, hyperventilating. I mean, that is a profound performance, when you can touch audiences all over the world to that degree. We\u2019ve never seen anything like that, and if that doesn\u2019t deserve an Oscar, I don\u2019t know what does.\u201d", "description": "The Russo Brothers sat down with Marlow Stern in Venice to discuss their new film \u2018Mosul,\u2019 awards prospects for their record-breaking blockbuster \u2018Avengers: Endgame,\u2019 and more.", "authors": ["Marlow Stern", "Senior Entertainment Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1567641839/190904-stern-russo-bros-tease_nuwxb1", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
