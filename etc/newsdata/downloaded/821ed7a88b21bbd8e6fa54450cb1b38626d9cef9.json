And our call of the day from Gene Tannuzzo, deputy global head of fixed income and senior portfolio manager at Columbia Threadneedle Investments, is urging investors to keep the faith in that asset class.\n\n\n\nFor one, bonds act as a \u201cshock absorber when other risk assets (like stocks) go down,\u201d Tannuzzo tells MarketWatch in a follow-up email to a recent interview. To be sure, some stock investors will hold their breath until we reach the end of this year, after the 2018 Christmas meltdown.\n\nRead: A \u2018jinx month\u2019 for the stock market is about to get under way\n\n\u201cThere is an old phrase, \u2018don\u2019t fight the Fed.\u2019 The Fed is cutting interest rates, and other central banks are easing also. This is a tailwind for bond prices,\u201d he said.\n\nAs the consumer sector in Europe and the U.S. is \u201cgrowing at a healthy pace,\u201d Tannuzzo suggests investors focus on bond exposure linked to strength in the consumer, such as asset-backed securities \u2014 those backed by an asset pool, such as home equity or auto loans.\n\nThat faith in the consumer also makes mortgage-backed securities attractive, he said. Blamed for the financial crisis, but seemingly back en vogue now, this type of bond pools together home loans. It does of course come with risk.\n\nBut as manufacturing and industrial sectors are struggling, he suggests avoiding corporate debt that relies on the business cycle and economy. Otherwise known as cyclical sectors, they include autos, industrials and export-heavy manufacturers.\n\nHe also sees some early warning signs when it comes to that hunt for yield, such as in the bank loan market where he\u2019s seeing highly leveraged issuers \u2014 those with big debt already \u2014 starting to come into the market. \u201cRecently, investors have been pushing back, and these deals are not getting done,\u201d said Tannuzzo.\n\nAnd here\u2019s one last piece of bond-related advice from him: \u201cThe energy market within high-yield bonds is struggling again with oil prices quite volatile. This could pressure default rates higher if energy prices drop further.\u201d\n\nRead: A \u2018jinx month\u2019 for the stock market is about to get under way\n\nRead: Meet the quiet Christian money manager who\u2019s comfortably beating the market\n\nThe market\n\nThe Dow YM00, +0.23%, S&P ES00, +0.24% and Nasdaq NQ00, +0.32% are modestly up.
