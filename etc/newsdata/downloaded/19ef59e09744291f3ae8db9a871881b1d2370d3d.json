General Assembly on Wednesday.\n\nSerraj said Libya was in crisis due to \u201cnegative foreign interference that led to institutional and political division\u201d and noted the crisis has grown to the point where Libya\u2019s capital city of Tripoli was attacked by the forces of a rival Libyan government.\n\nSerraj said those forces enjoy \u201cforeign financial and military support\u201d and referred to their commander, General Khalifa Haftar, as a \u201ccriminal.\u201d He noted the siege of Tripoli began while the U.N. secretary-general happened to be visiting the city in April in an effort to arrange a peaceable political solution to LIbya\u2019s ills.\n\n\u201cHis coup has failed, and here he is today, repeating once again his desperate attempts to militarize the country and to block our path towards a modern civilian state, ridiculing the revolution of the Libyan people and their sacrifices that were offered to rid the country of dictatorship,\u201d Serraj said of Haftar.\n\n\u201cWhat encouraged this war criminal to carry out this aggression is the report he received from certain states for years, in flagrant violation of Security Council resolutions on the arms ban,\u201d said Serraj. \u201cThis led him to be deluded and believe he could enter the capital in two days, but his delusions were destroyed and the world has come to know his reality, and to know that he is a bloody criminal seeking power.\u201d\n\nSerraj claimed that much of Haftar\u2019s foreign support drained away after he was trounced by the defenders of Tripoli and exposed as a \u201cfailure,\u201d but it is \u201cunfortunate\u201d that he still has some foreign patrons, including the United Arab Emirates, which has \u201callowed its territories to be a media forum for Haftar to issue his hate speech and incitement.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn addition, French Javelin missiles were found after the liberation of the city of Gideon in the center of the aggressor\u2019s operations,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe also find it strange the positions of some states, particularly our neighbor Egypt, who lecture us on democracy and a civilian state, and the economy, and how to distribute wealth,\u201d Serraj continued.\n\n\u201cWe denounce these efforts that support the war criminal and support coup plotters in violation of Security Council resolutions,\u201d he said. \u201cWe confirm that we will continue to respond to the aggressor and defeat him, despite whatever support he receives, and we consider his supporters morally and legally responsible.\u201d\n\nSerraj said Haftar\u2019s \u201cwidespread\u201d human rights violations include \u201cextrajudicial killings and forced displacement\u201d and the recruitment of child soldiers. These offenses have resulted in over 3,000 casualties plus \u201chundreds of thousands\u201d of refugees. He said Haftar\u2019s forces have deliberately attacked civilian targets, including airports and hospitals.\n\nSerraj asked the United Nations to send a fact-finding mission to Libya and asked the International Criminal Court (ICC) to open an investigation of Haftar.\n\nSerraj rejected Haftar\u2019s claims to be \u201cfighting terrorism\u201d and said he has misled the international community.\n\n\u201cNational Accord forces are the ones who have fought terrorism,\u201d he insisted. \u201cWe continue to work together to root out terrorism wherever it is, and we will continue to battle until we uproot all of terrorism. Our soldiers who have fought the terrorist organization are the ones who are fighting back the aggression against the capital now.\u201d\n\nSerraj accused Haftar of trying to split Libya in two and launch a war between the eastern and western halves. He called on the political leaders allied with Haftar to abandon him and work with the Government of National Accord to create a \u201cmodern civilian state\u201d across the entire country.\n\n\u201cI call upon all youth who have been convinced of war by a war-obsessed man to return securely and safely to their homes, and to take the side of the nation,\u201d he said.\n\nSerraj said his government\u2019s commitment to dialogue and political solutions does not extend to Haftar, who can no longer be regarded as a \u201cpartner for peace.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no room in dialogue for someone who wants to militarize the state,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter reviewing some of his government\u2019s efforts to decentralize power and spread funding across all of Libya, Serraj warned against \u201cattempts to sell Libyan oil outside of legal means,\u201d because \u201coil is the property of all Libyans and its management is the responsibility of the national oil company alone.\u201d\n\nThe GNA president strove to reassure the U.N. General Assembly that progress has been made on national security \u2013 a necessary precondition for restoring national prosperity and international trade \u2013 but his assessment was not entirely reassuring: \u201cBefore [Haftar\u2019s] aggression, we achieved positive strides in this regard, which has led to the return of several diplomatic missions to Tripoli. We were able to contain most armed groups, and implemented programs to collect weapons, and integrated former militants into national institutions.\u201d\n\nSerraj criticized the international community for remaining silent while crowded migrant centers have been subjected to bombing attacks. He stressed that the Libyan people are \u201cvictims of migration, not the cause of migration\u201d into Europe, and pledged to continue cooperation with the \u201ctarget states of migrants\u201d to address the issue, which he said could only be permanently addressed by encouraging \u201cdevelopment in origin states.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy country, as a transit point of migrants, critically needs political support in proportion to the challenge so that we can build the necessary institutions to control borders, to limit this phenomenon and minimize its impact,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cA stable Libya will be able to secure its borders and will be able to provide job opportunities to hundreds of thousands as per Libyan labor law,\u201d he pledged.\n\nDespite all of the Libyan woes he brought to the General Assembly, Serraj still found time to conclude his speech with a call for an independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital,\u201d and for a \u201cpeaceful, political solution in Syria and Yemen.\u201d", "description": "Falez Mustafa Serraj of Libya's Government of National Accord tells the U.N. foreign support inspired rogue General Khalifa Haftar to attack.", "authors": ["John Hayward"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/Falez-Mustafa-Serraj-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
