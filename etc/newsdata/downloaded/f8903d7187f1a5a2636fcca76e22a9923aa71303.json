Trump brought a whole new kind of vicious enmity to politics.\n\nAnd despite his critics\u2019 constant assertion that he and his followers are dripping from the fangs, it seems to be the people who most ardently oppose him who\u2019ve upped the game.\n\nGood grief, there\u2019s some hate for Trump out there.\n\nAnd that emotional drive is often partnered with stunning claims, which \u2014 perhaps not merely coincidentally \u2014 seem rarely outfitted with explanation.\n\nDonald Trump is an evil man who\u2019s destroyed every tenet of the Constitution and brought on Armageddon, and that\u2019s just the way it is.\n\nTo me, the hysteria doesn\u2019t help anything. There\u2019s no American conversation; there\u2019s only memes.\n\nThe Commander-in-Chief, among his most fiercest adversaries, has become a cartoon.\n\nApropos, on Saturday, director Rob Reiner made an announcement: Donald Trump is the most lawless president in history. Or, more accurately \u2014 as lawless as any in history.\n\nPowerful claim.\n\nRob also believes Trump has abused his position in order to \u201cline his pockets\u201d:\n\nThe Impeachment process is about to begin. The articles drawn up will be voluminous. Never in our nation\u2019s history has there been a more lawless President. He has continually lied to the American people & has used the Presidency to line his pockets. GOP, history is watching. \u2014 Rob Reiner (@robreiner) September 7, 2019\n\nSuch is the state in which we\u2019re living.\n\nSo is this, speaking of cartoons:\n\nDecades from now people will wonder how we could allow Individual-1 to cause chaos and fraud and destruction for so long, like a Tasmanian Devil on adderall. And we will have no good answers for them.https://t.co/ZvysX67rta \u2014 Adam Rifkin \ud83d\udc3c (@ifindkarma) September 7, 2019\n\nIs that really how history will remember things?\n\nThe above tweets are mild examples; there are much, much, much more extreme ones that I don\u2019t care to entertain at present time.\n\nAmerica appears to be currently separated into at least two countries: one which is in utter chaos, where the sky has fallen and the rivers have dried, where liberty has been abolished and Earth will never recover; and the other one, in which everything\u2019s fine and people look at the alternate nation and say, \u201cWhat the _____ is wrong with you??\u201d\n\nHow did we get here? We\u2019re co-existing in a fractured reality.\n\nWe may need to answer that question before we can address a more pertinent one:\n\nHow do we get back?\n\nHow do we return to that old school version of hating the president, as we all more or less live in the same United States?\n\nWe\u2019re supposed to be \u201cOne Nation Under God.\u201d As for God, that\u2019s a whole debate in itself.\n\nBut how do we even make it to the \u201cone nation\u201d part?\n\nI\u2019d like to hear from you.\n\nI\u2019d like to know.\n\nAt this moment, I surely don\u2019t.\n\n-ALEX\n\nSee 3 more pieces from me:\n\nAmerica Needs A Christian Revival\n\nSeptember 11th: Remembering Not Only Tragedy, But Something Greater\n\nPat Sajak Crushes Conservative Blacklisting, Outrage Culture, And The Absurdity Of The \u2018Look At Me\u2019 Generation\n\nFind all my RedState work here.\n\nAnd please follow Alex Parker on Twitter and Facebook.\n\nThank you for reading!
