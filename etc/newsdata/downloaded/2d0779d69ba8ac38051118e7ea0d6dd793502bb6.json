Two Ukrainian gas industry experts say the gas-market reforms pushed by Biden and others in 2014 and 2015 hit Firtash in the wallet, and badly. One knowledgeable outside observer estimated that the 2014 and 2015 gas reforms and legislation cost him hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nOn Dec. 9, 2015, Biden gave a speech to Ukraine\u2019s parliament. He praised the protesters who forced out Ukraine\u2019s Russia-friendly president, he recited Ukrainian poetry, and he called for reforms to Ukraine\u2019s gas market, too.\n\n\u201cThe energy sector needs to be competitive, ruled by market principles\u2014not sweetheart deals,\u201d he said, basking in the audience\u2019s repeated applause.\n\nFirtash, who built his fortune in part through a rather sweet gas-trading deal, hated it. Earlier this year\u2014more than three and a half years after the talk\u2014he was still seething. Firtash told The Daily Beast that the Ukrainian parliamentarians in the audience were humiliatingly subservient to Biden.\n\n\u201c He was the overlord. I was ashamed to look at this. I was repulsed. \u201d \u2014 Dmytro Firtash\n\n\u201cHe was the overlord,\u201d Firtash said. \u201cI was ashamed to look at this. I was repulsed.\u201d\n\nNow people linked to Firtash are at the heart of Republicans\u2019 efforts to find dirt on Biden, and a document Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani has said is key to his theory of Biden World malfeasance was produced for Firtash\u2019s legal team. The reporter who published that document, The Hill\u2019s John Solomon, is a client of Firtash\u2019s new lawyers, Victoria Toensing and Joe DiGenova. Over the summer, Trump pressured Ukraine\u2019s president to cooperate with Giuliani\u2019s efforts. That pressure stunned many Republicans and gave House Democratic leadership the impetus they had long sought to announce an impeachment inquiry.\n\nAnd two Giuliani associates reportedly brought up Firtash\u2019s name when talking about their plans for Ukraine\u2019s energy sector. Those two associates also worked with Giuliani to find dirt on Biden, and they\u2019ve both been charged with financial crimes. On top of that, Firtash\u2019s lawyers say one of them, Lev Parnas, has worked as a translator for his legal team.\n\nFirtash\u2019s blunt assessment of Biden\u2019s speech at the parliament and influence on Ukraine\u2014shared earlier this year with The Daily Beast and published here in full for the first time\u2014highlights how a battle over the future of Ukraine bled into the highest levels of American politics.\n\nFirtash\u2019s company did not respond to requests for comment. Biden\u2019s campaign called Firtash \u201c a Kremlin-friendly Ukrainian oligarch who\u2019s been wanted on bribery and racketeering charges in the U.S. since 2014.\u201d\n\nGas Man\n\nFirtash was born in Ukraine and\u2014like many other up-and-coming oligarchs\u2014grew rich in the rubble of the Soviet Union. After spending some time in Moscow, he started trading gas from Central Asia to Ukraine. His renown as a gas trader grew, and he made deals with Russia\u2019s state-owned giant Gazprom to move Russia\u2019s abundant gas to energy-hungry Ukraine.\n\nWith Gazprom\u2019s blessing, he got deals widely characterized as of the sweetheart variety: Firtash bought cheap gas from Russia, sold it for a lot more in Ukraine, and profited. He then bankrolled Russia-friendly politicians in Ukraine. One such politician was Viktor Yanukovych, who hired Paul Manafort. American diplomats at the time saw Firtash as a vector of Russian influence\u2014part of the connective tissue between the Kremlin and Kyiv.\n\nAnd American law enforcement saw him as a crook. On April 2, 2014, the Justice Department announced that he had been indicted for authorizing $18.5 million in bribes to Indian government officials. The case involved efforts to mine for titanium that would be used in Boeing planes.\n\nAustrian authorities arrested Firtash a few weeks before the DOJ\u2019s announcement. He posted about $174 million in bail and has since been living in Vienna, fighting extradition from his palatial corporate offices there. And while the allegation isn\u2019t part of the DOJ\u2019s indictment of Firtash, U.S. government lawyers have said in court that he\u2019s an \u201cupper echelon\u201d associate of a Russian criminal organization. Firtash says the claim is baseless.\n\nIn June of this year, an Austrian judge greenlit his extradition to the U.S. But his high-powered legal team is still fighting. And this July, that team got some new oomph: DiGenova and Toensing, a husband-and-wife duo who have worked on a host of contentious fights and have deep ties in Washington\u2019s tight-knit conservative legal community. They even reportedly secured a meeting about Firtash\u2019s case with Attorney General Bill Barr\u2014a sit-down many criminal defense lawyers would kill for.\n\nFirtash\u2019s team has long argued he\u2019s the victim of a political prosecution and that the U.S. government only targeted him to blunt his influence in Ukraine. That\u2019s where Biden comes in.\n\nDirect Hit\n\nIn 2014, hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians took to the streets in protest. After Yanukovych\u2019s government killed dozens of protesters, he was forced out and fled to Russia. He left behind a $20 billion hole in Ukraine\u2019s economy, and the country teetered on the brink of fiscal collapse.\n\nEnter Biden. The vice president helmed America\u2019s Ukraine policy, traveled to the country multiple times while in office, and said he spoke to the country\u2019s president and prime minister \u201cprobably on average once a week if you average it out over the last year.\u201d Kyiv was desperate for billions in support from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), where the U.S. holds sway. The Americans and the IMF pushed Ukraine to roll out a host of reforms to get the cash.\n\n\"The Obama administration, and Vice President Biden in particular, led the international community to help advance gas sector reforms in Ukraine,\u201d said a former State Department official with knowledge of the dynamics. \u201cThe thinking of the United States was that establishing an open, transparent gas sector would be vital to Ukraine\u2019s fight against entrenched oligarchic corruption and would shore up the country\u2019s strategic stability in the face of Russian aggression.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Firtash\u2019s control of RosUkrEnergo, which exerted monopolistic control over regional gas distribution, would have been threatened by these reforms,\u201d the official added.\n\nBiden has touted his leverage over Kyiv, including successfully pushing for the ouster of the country\u2019s then-chief prosecutor, Viktor Shokin. Biden wasn\u2019t the only one pushing for Shokin to leave as part of Ukraine\u2019s anti-corruption efforts. The prosecutor had put in anemic performance charging powerful and well-connected kleptocrats while in office and the IMF, the European Union, and Ukrainian anti-corruption activists all urged his ouster.\n\nShokin had also scrutinized a gas company whose board included Biden\u2019s son Hunter Biden, a fact that Trump and his allies have cited as evidence of corruption. They note that Shokin\u2019s replacement wasn\u2019t much better. But the reporter who broke the Hunter Biden story years ago reported that Joe Biden\u2019s overall anti-corruption push in Ukraine likely endangered the company his son was linked to.\n\nThe Americans and the IMF also pushed for a series of reforms to Ukraine\u2019s energy sector, including the gas industry. In 2014 and 2015, the Ukrainians unveiled a variety of changes: Kyiv changed the corporate governance of its state-owned gas company, Naftogaz; it passed its \u201cNatural Gas Market\u201d law, which the prime minister touted as having \u201cde-oligarchized and de-monopolized\u201d the gas market; and it rolled out a basket of regulatory changes to its gas sector\u2014with Biden cheerleading along the way.\n\nIn a July 2015 speech, Biden praised Ukraine for \u201cclosing the space for corrupt middlemen who rip off the Ukrainian people.\u201d\n\n\u201cMiddleman\u201d was an epithet often aimed at oligarchs like Firtash, whose gas business had raked in millions by acting as a broker between Ukraine\u2019s state-owned gas company and Russia\u2019s Gazprom.\n\n\u201cThere is one of the biggest state-owned enterprises, which is Ukrainian Naftogaz, a gas company, that had very shadowy and non-transparent deals with middlemen and with the Russian Federation,\u201d Arseniy Yatseniuk, the country\u2019s prime minister at the time, said in a speech just two days after Biden\u2019s. \u201cSo last year we eliminated this middleman. His name is Mr. Firtash. He is under FBI investigation and expected to be extradited to the United States.\u201d\n\nOleksandr Kharchenko, the director of the Center for Energy Industry Research Center in Kyiv, said the changes damaged Firtash\u2019s business interests.\n\n\u201cIt hit him directly,\u201d he said.\n\nYessed to Death\n\nFirtash, for his part, saw in Biden a swaggering politician overstepping his bounds\u2014and a Ukrainian audience embarrassingly enchanted with what they saw.\n\n\u201cWhen Biden came to Ukraine and he spoke in parliament, I was reminded of an old story from the Soviet Union when the first secretary of the ObKom [the regional committee of the Communist Party] came, and on the one side all the komsomoltsi [youth members of the Communist Party] lined up, and on the other the communists, and they all took loyalty oaths. You understand? That\u2019s how approximately it was with Biden,\u201d Firtash told The Daily Beast in February.\n\nBiden\u2019s influence in Ukraine, he added, was \u201cenormous.\u201d\n\nFirtash saw Yatseniuk, the prime minister at the time, as a pawn of Biden and other Americans.\n\n\u201cWho appointed whom, and who actually governed the country?\u201d he said.\n\nFirtash has also sparred with Andriy Kobolyev, who became CEO of Naftogaz under Yatseniuk. Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman\u2014the indicted Giuliani associates\u2014reportedly discussed an effort to oust Kobolyev earlier this year. Reuters has reported that Firtash financed their work.\n\nFirtash\u2019s lawyers say scrutiny of Biden\u2019s role is necessary for his criminal defense.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. and Austrian legal teams have always been focused on Dmitry Firtash\u2019s innocence,\u201d a spokesperson for DiGenova and Toensing said in a statement provided to The Daily Beast. \u201cThe U.S. Justice Department has submitted false and misleading statements about Mr. Firtash and the evidence in his case to the Austrian courts. In the context of reopening the extradition case, the Austrian legal team sought former Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin\u2019s sworn statement as one of numerous statements and other evidence submitted to the Austrian court. The former Vice President\u2019s role in Mr. Firtash\u2019s extradition is materially relevant to the Austrian lawyers\u2019 argument that the prosecution is political.\u201d\n\n\u201c They\u2019re masters at paying lip service to the guy who comes to town for a week. They will yes him to death, and then the minute he leaves, it\u2019s business as usual. \u201d \u2014 American political consultant\n\nThe 2015 reforms appear to have cost Firtash a lot of money. It\u2019s difficult to estimate how much, as the oligarch\u2019s finances are quite opaque. Victoria Voytsitska was a member of the eighth convocation of the Ukrainian parliament and a member of its committee on Fuel Energy, Nuclear Policies, and Security. She told The Daily Beast that the gas market reforms have likely cost Firtash about $215 million to $400 million a year since their 2015 rollout.\n\n\u201cFirtash really was pushed out of Naftogaz\u2019s financial flow,\u201d Kharchenko said.\n\nThat said, many caution against overestimating the significance of the reforms Ukraine implemented. Firtash remains immensely wealthy and powerful, and controls Ukrainian gas distribution networks, known as oblgazes. And in the wake of the Maidan Revolution, he kept control of his assets in Ukraine. Oligarchs still dominate Ukraine\u2019s energy sector, which is far from a bastion of transparency.\n\nEd Chow, an energy expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said Biden and the U.S. didn\u2019t push hard enough for major, structural changes.\n\n\u201cTo be fair, Biden was the most senior U.S. official interested in Ukraine,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout Biden, even less would have happened in terms of the U.S. government pressuring Ukraine. Ukrainians would have moved forward even less on reform. I would give the U.S. government a mixed grade.\u201d\n\nAn American political consultant who\u2019s worked in Ukraine for years and spoke anonymously because of client sensitivities said Kyiv has honed its ability to satisfy Westerners without upending the status quo.\n\n\u201cThe Ukrainians, if you look at their history, they\u2019ve always been at the edge of one empire or another,\u201d the consultant said. \u201cThey were used to dealing with viceroys, representatives of the sultan, representatives of the Lithuanian empire, the Polish empire, the Russian and Soviet empires. They\u2019re masters at paying lip service to the guy who comes to town for a week. They will yes him to death, and then the minute he leaves, it\u2019s business as usual.\u201d\n\nBut business changed for Firtash after 2015. And Biden stayed on his mind.", "description": "Dmytro Firtash\u2019s lawyers say his team had to investigate Joe Biden to defend their client.
