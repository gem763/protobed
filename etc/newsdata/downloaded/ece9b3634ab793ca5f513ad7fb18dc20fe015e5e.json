For a company called NLMK USA, which makes carbon flat-rolled steel in Farrell, Pa., there\u2019s nowhere to get those slabs domestically. That\u2019s meant it has to source them from China\u2013and pay a 25% import tariff\u2013or find an overseas supplier exempt from the tariffs. Meanwhile, prices have climbed as companies in the same situation scramble to find new supplies. As its costs rise, NLMK USA is taking fewer orders and running fewer shifts. \u201cIt\u2019s made it very difficult for us to compete,\u201d says Bob Miller, president and CEO of NLMK USA.\n\nThe Trump tariffs that have already led to cutbacks across the U.S. were joined on Sept. 1 by a new round of 15% levies on more than $125 billion in imports, from wireless headphones to lawn mowers. This brings the average tax on Chinese imports up to 21.2% from just 3.1% when Donald Trump entered the White House, per the Peterson Institute for International Economics. American businesses like NLMK USA are being drafted into the trade war whether they like it or not. \u201c[This hike] is going to have a bigger negative effect on the U.S. economy than any of Trump\u2019s previous increases,\u201d says James H. Nolt, a senior fellow at the World Policy Institute. \u201cThis is hitting the United States where it\u2019s particularly vulnerable right now.\u201d\n\nIn retaliation, Beijing on Sept. 1 began imposing additional tariffs on 1,717 U.S. exports, such as soybeans and car parts. While European exporters say they\u2019re being offered incentives to set up in a newly expanded free trade zone in Shanghai, their American competitors are complaining of increased red tape. Beijing\u2019s 5% levy on American crude oil marks the first time the fuel has been in the crosshairs since the world\u2019s two biggest economies began their tussle over trade more than a year ago.\n\nThe Chinese economy is also feeling the pinch. Growth in its manufacturing sector slowed in August for the fourth month in a row, and Trump has also threatened to use emergency presidential powers to force American companies out of China. On Sept. 2, China\u2019s Commerce Ministry complained to the World Trade Organization that the new tariffs \u201cseverely violated\u201d a truce that Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to at the G-20 summit in Osaka in June. \u201cIt\u2019s costly for China and the whole global economy,\u201d says Susan Shirk, chair of the 21st Century China Center at the University of California, San Diego, School of Global Policy and Strategy. \u201cIt\u2019s really slowing down human progress in so many ways.\u201d\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

The question is how much both the U.S. and China can lose and still declare victory.\n\ntrade\u2019s function as a political cudgel has lately seen a renaissance, as evidenced by its use in situations like Japan and South Korea\u2019s escalating dispute over reparations for historic abuses during Japanese colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula. But even as the tactic grows in popularity, its usefulness remains in question\u2013especially given the increased risk of trade wars\u2019 fueling diplomatic or even military confrontations.\n\nTrump\u2019s hard line with China is popular with his base, and even some Chinese business leaders quietly praise the U.S. President for pushing Beijing to enact what they consider to be much needed reforms to the state-oriented economy. But there is little sign China plans to enact the sweeping systemic changes to its policies on intellectual property, forced technology transfers, market access and industrial subsidies that would appease the Trump Administration. Beijing has consistently denied Washington\u2019s accusations that it engages in unfair trade practices, and portrays the U.S. as the aggressor. In uncharacteristically spiky rhetoric, state news wire Xinhua accused the U.S. of \u201cacting as a \u2018school bully'\u201d in a Sept. 1 op-ed.\n\nIt\u2019s also unclear what exactly Trump hopes to achieve. He wants China to cut assistance for state-run companies, for example. But it\u2019s unlikely that doing so would address the $419 billion U.S. trade deficit with China, which the President claims costs American jobs. Around 80% of China\u2019s exports come from the purely private sector, and almost half from multinationals like Walmart that simply manufacture in China, according to Nolt.\n\nIronically, economists say the only way to really bring that figure down would be for the Chinese state to intervene to artificially stymie trade with the U.S. \u201cWhat Trump really wants is way beyond China\u2019s capacity to give,\u201d says Nolt.\n\nAnd so the trade war rumbles on. Further tariff increases are expected in October and December, encompassing almost everything China sells to the U.S., from golf shoes to iPhones. If they\u2019re enacted, new research by University College London and the London School of Economics shows, Americans could lose something else this year: up to $970 per household.\n\n\u2013With reporting by ALANA SEMUELS/SAN FRANCISCO\n\nWrite to Charlie Campbell at charlie.campbell@time.com.\n\nThis appears in the September 16, 2019 issue of TIME.", "description": "American businesses are being drafted into Trump's trade war.
