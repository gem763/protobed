Nike pulled Houston Rockets merchandise from its stores in China.", "description": "Taipei (AFP) \u2013 Luxury Italian sports-car brand Maserati has cut sponsorship ties with Taiwan\u2019s top film awards, the latest international brand", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/27/abc180_maserati-linked-its-decision-cut-sponsorship-ties-film-awards-beijing-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
