(AP) - Atlanta United captain Michael Parkhurst will retire after the season, ending a 15-year career in which he was one of the top defenders in Major League Soccer.\n\nParkhurst announced his decision Monday before the team trained for a crucial match at New York City FC. Atlanta trails first-place NYCFC by four points in the Eastern Conference with three games left in the regular season.\n\n\u201cWell, the time has come for me, unfortunately,\u201d he said in a video tweeted by the team. \u201cI know I\u2019m one of the lucky ones to be able to say that I\u2019ve really, really enjoyed what I\u2019ve been able to do the last 15 years. To kick a soccer ball and get paid for it has been an absolute dream come true.\u201d\n\nThe 35-year-old defender was picked as captain after joining Atlanta for its first season in 2017. He helped the expansion team win the MLS Cup last season, as well as the Campeones Cup and the U.S. Open Cup this year.\n\n\u201cWe want to congratulate Michael on an illustrious career and thank him for immense contributions to Atlanta United,\u201d technical director Carlos Bocanegra said. \u201cHis career accolades speak for themselves, but during his time in Atlanta, he was a consummate professional and played an integral role for us, both on and off the field.\n\nParkhurst, born in Providence, Rhode Island, also played in the Danish Superliga and spent one season with Augsburg in the German Bundesliga before returning to MLS with Columbus Crew in 2014. He was a member of the U.S. national team for eight years, notably competing at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing.\n\n\u201cIn addition to solidifying our back line for the 2018 MLS Cup championship run, he was also an influential figure in building our club\u2019s culture and we\u2019re forever indebted to him for that,\u201d Bocanegra said. \u201cHe\u2019ll always be welcome back at Atlanta United.\u201d\n\nParkhurst finally won his first MLS Cup last December, having fallen short four other times.\n\nBut, after finishing in the top five in Defender of the Year voting in 2018, his playing time diminished significantly this season with the emergence of Miles Robinson. Parkhurst has only 14 starts and 18 appearances in 31 league games.\n\nStill, he remained an important figure in the locker room and off the bench.\n\nWith Atlanta United already clinching a spot in the playoffs for the third straight season, Parkhurst has a shot at one more trophy before he retires.\n\n\u201cFor now, it\u2019s back to the grind, it\u2019s back to practice,\u201d Parkhurst said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a big one Wednesday and I\u2019m looking forward to it.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Atlanta United captain Michael Parkhurst will retire after the season, ending a 15-year career in which he was one of the top defenders in Major League Soccer.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/23/atlanta_united_parkhurst_soccer_03296_c0-105-2500-1562_s1770x1032.jpg?4e7def89f6377519720abe58100251cad17ec71a", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
