In this case, it has the added advantage of convincing them that they must have missed something. Thus the whole of Remainer Twitter is now devoted to amateur constitutional lawyery in search of The Flaw.\n\nAs an amateur constitutional lawyer myself, but more importantly as a politics nerd who has been paying attention since Hilary Benn published his bill on 3 September, I am pretty certain that the law is watertight and that Johnson and his chief of staff Cummings are bluffing.\n\nSir John, in his speech on Thursday night, said: \u201cMy fear is that the government will seek to bypass statute law, by passing an order of council to suspend the act until after 31 October.\u201d\n\nNo normal person had heard of an order \u201cof\u201d council, as opposed to an order \u201cin\u201d council, which is the Privy Council\u2019s usual way of exercising the royal prerogative on behalf of the Queen.\n\nApparently an order \u201cof\u201d council is used to make minor amendments to the rules of bodies set up by royal charters. Anyway, the idea that Johnson could suspend an act of parliament is nonsense. A moment\u2019s thought would confirm that a government cannot simply set aside a law with which it doesn\u2019t agree \u2013 what then would be the point of parliament?\n\nIf Johnson were even to think of such a thing, Lady Hale, president of the Supreme Court, would be on TV declaring it void before the idea had even fully formed in his head.\n\nBenn\u2019s act is tightly drafted, and in the 24 days it has been public no one has found a way around it. It has been suggested, for example, that Johnson might declare a state of emergency; or that he might send a second letter to the EU cancelling the one he would be required by law to send. There are other ideas, but none of them has survived scrutiny by people who really are constitutional lawyers.\n\nJohnson\u2019s insistence on leaving the EU on 31 October \u201ccome what may\u201d is bluster. If he hasn\u2019t got a deal through parliament by 19 October, he will have to ask the EU for an extension or resign to make way for another prime minister who will.", "description": "John Major has joined the national parlour game of trying to find loopholes in the European Union (Withdrawal) (No 2) Act \u2013 the law passed by parliament to prevent a no-deal Brexit at the end of next month.", "authors": ["John Rentoul"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/25/22/boris-parliament-supreme-court.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
