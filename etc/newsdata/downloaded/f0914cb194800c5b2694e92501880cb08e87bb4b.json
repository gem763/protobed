But it is.\n\nAnd today, as Kimberley Hainey, 37, the monster who gave Declan life, was sentenced to a minimum of 15 years in jail for his murder, we, as a society should draw a line in the sand.\n\nNo child should be condemned to this life of misery because they were brought into the world by a hopeless drug addict.\n\nAnd if ever there is a cast iron case for a total re-think of drug addicts being allowed to keep their children, then it is this tragic murder of a 15-months-old Scottish toddler.\n\nThe poor little boy lay starving, in urine soaked nappies and filth while his mother pretended he was alive and carried on with her pathetic life.\n\nFor eight months between 2009 and 2010, she concealed his death and told neighbours he had gone to live with an aunt.\n\nIt was only when her parents finally went to the house that they discovered his mummified body in his cot.\n\nThe day before she was sentenced, the Crown Office in Scotland took the unusual step of revealing the shocking pictures of the house where Declan died.\n\nThey are among the most sickening images of we will ever see of the squalid pit where Declan was imprisoned in the months before his death.\n\nWhile Hainey went out selling his clothes and toys, Declan lay for hours alone, amid the empty cider bottles and lager cans, putrid milk carton, half-eaten food, and discarded takeaway boxes.\n\nA tiny coat still with the label still on it lay among the piles of rubbish.\n\nHainey was supposed to be off drugs \u2013 but the pictures tell a different story.\n\nNext to the filth-strewn sofa, is a pile of used drugs paraphernalia, tin foil and a lighter.\n\nAnd in the midst of all the squalor, a poignant reminder of what his life should have been for Declan - family snaps on the wall, a Christmas card including one which read \u2018For a Special Grandson\u2019.\n\nAs she was sentenced at the High Court in Glasgow, for murder and concealment of her son\u2019s body, Lord Woolman told her: \u201cDeclan\u2019s first birthday took place in April 2009, he appeared to have all his life in front of him.\n\n\n\nRubbish strewn cot: Declan Hainey's bed filled with waste including empty bottles of Irn-Bru, 3 Hammers cider, Lucozade, viodka and crisp packets\n\n\u201cHe was surrounded by a loving family and people thought you were a loving mother . A few months later he was dead.\u201d\n\nNow we learn that the Crown Office are considering a Fatal Accident Inquiry into Declan\u2019s death.\n\nSo they should be. If they don\u2019t have one, there out to be a public outcry asking why.\n\nThe cause of Declan\u2019s death is not known, but he is said to have last been seen when he was 15 months old. His body was discovered in March 2010, when he would have been 23 months old.\n\nWe have a right to know the details of how in this day and age a child can be left dead for eight months and nobody intervened.\n\nDuring the trial we heard various reasons why Hainey\u2019s life descended into the spiral of decay and drugs.\n\nPost natal depression was one that was offered in court.\n\nBut that is not the issue here.\n\nThe trial was told she had been put on a methadone programme but was signed off after social workers said she and Declan were doing well.\n\n\n\nDeclan was last seen alive aged 15 months. His body was discovered in March 2010, when he would have been 23 months old\n\nBut Hainey then refused to co-operate with her drugs counsellor and made excuses over why no one could see the boy.\n\nWhy weren\u2019t social workers breaking down her door?\n\nHow she came to be the kind of mother who abandoned her baby is anybody\u2019s guess.\n\nThe issue, is where was the safety net that is supposed to save children like Hainey from a fate like this?\n\nTime and again, our front pages scream outraged headlines when another toddler or child has been left to die.\n\nAnd as inquiries and court cases unravel, we continually find that social workers were involved, but either missed the signs, or were too overworked.\n\nBut the bottom line is this.\n\nDeclan's clothes and toys can be seen amongst the squalor of the house in which he tragically died\n\nHow many more children have to die before the policy is changed not to give drug addict parents their children?\n\nJust three years ago in Dundee, we had the tragic case of little Brandon Cunningham beaten stamped on by Robert Cunningham, the evil boyfriend of drug addict Heather Boyd. She had been selling her body for heroin the night her 23-month-old son died at the hands of her drug addict boyfriend.\n\nThe court heard that duodenum \u2013 part of the small intestine - was pressed against his spine until it burst.\n\nWe heard how doctors found at least 40 injuries on Brandon, including bruising and four fractured ribs.\n\nSocial workers had missed the warning signs, health visitors doctors failed to detect them.\n\nIn cases like this, there is always a knee jerk reaction asking where were the support teams.\n\nOf course in the case of Brandon and Declan they utterly failed in their job, and their failure led to the deaths of two beautiful little boys.\n\nIt\u2019s not more social workers we need to cope with the rise of child neglect through drugs and deprivation.\n\nIt\u2019s a fundamental change in policy towards drug addicts and their children.\n\nDuring years as a frontline reporter in Glasgow I worked on drugs investigation and spent time with families.\n\nI have seen at first hand, young mothers swallowed up by the scourge of heroin, being backed by social workers because they want to keep families together.\n\nOf course, somewhere in a drug addicts fuddled mind they will want to keep their children.\n\nBut the fact is, a heroin addict stumbles through each day shoplifting or working as a prostitute to feed their habit.\n\nMaking enough money for drugs is their first priority \u2013 not their child.\n\nI once went to a house where the prostitute heroin addict mother was selling sex for a fiver a time, to get enough money to get her portable TV back because she was getting her little girl for the weekend. She had given the television to her drug dealer to pay off some of her drug debts. She was living in squalor, yet social workers wanted to keep the family together.\n\n\n\nDrug addiction trumps all other desires- including the desire to care for a child\n\nI have no doubt the woman loved her toddler. But she loved heroin more.\n\nWhen are we going to realise allowing drug addict parents to keep their children just doesn\u2019t work?\n\nIt will never work.\n\nA drug addict will sell everything to get their next fix. They will steal from their parents, sell the furniture - they will sell their child if it comes to it.\n\nAnd as is tragically obvious from Hainey\u2019s case, they will leave their child to die, because drug addicts are not thinking on any rational level.\n\nWe continually hear of people turned down for adoption because they are too fat, too old, the wrong race.\n\nYet social workers who make decisions that don\u2019t just change lives but that can actually save lives or condemn a child to death, just don\u2019t see it, that a child would have a better chance if it was taken away from drug addict parents.\n\nIf a drug addict was clear of drugs for three years, then perhaps they deserve the chance of restricted, supervised access to their child.\n\nWe cannot keep taking chances with children\u2019s lives by prioritising the need for a family to be together.\n\nThe child is the only priority here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "ANNA SMITH: We cannot begin to imagine the final hours of little Declan Hainey.
