Unfortunately, just not in this case.\u201d\n\nMarlins manager Don Mattingly compared Alfaro\u2019s power to former Marlins and current St. Louis Cardinals outfielder Marcell Ozuna.\n\n\u201cWhen he hits them they go,\u201d Mattingly said.\n\nRojas broke a 2-2 tie with a run-scoring double to left off Giants reliever Shaun Anderson (3-5). Lewis Brinson singled in Rojas to make it 4-2.\n\n\u201cI was aggressive,\u201d Rojas said. \u201cI was trying to do damage instead of just putting the bat on the ball, and I hit it hard.\u201d\n\nJarlin Garcia (3-1) retired the only batter he faced for the win as the Marlins snapped a five-game skid.\n\nGarcia got Brandon Belt to fly out to left with Donovan Solano representing the go-ahead run at third with two outs in the seventh.\n\nAnderson gave up two runs on three hits in 1/3 of an inning.\n\nAlfaro\u2019s 15th homer ended a streak of 20 consecutive innings in which Miami was held scoreless going back to the fifth inning of Thursday\u2019s 3-2 loss to Milwaukee.\n\nThe Giants tied it in the seventh on Solano\u2019s pinch-hit, two-run triple to right off reliever Brian Moran.\n\nDugger gave up two runs on five hits.\n\nThe Giants have lost 10 of their last 13 home games and five of their last seven overall.\n\nJos\u00e9 Ure\u00f1a pitched around two singles in the ninth for his second save in three tries.\n\nRESPECT FROM PRADO\n\nKevin Pillar made a leaping backhanded catch near the top of center field wall, robbing Martin Prado of extra bases with one out in the fifth for a 407-foot out according to Statcast.\n\nThe catch earned Pillar a salute from Prado before he turned back to the Marlins\u2019 dugout.\n\nCHAMPIONS\n\nThe Sacramento River Cats, San Francisco\u2019s Triple-A affiliate, completed a three-game sweep of the Round Rock Express with a 7-5 victory on Friday to win organization\u2019s first the Pacific Coast League championship since 1977.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nMarlins: OF Garrett Cooper (left knee contusion) was examined on Saturday and will not need further tests, manager Don Mattingly said. Cooper suffered the injury making a sliding catch during Friday night\u2019s game. His status remains day-to-day. . LHP Josh Smith was claimed off waivers from the Cleveland Indians. He will join the team in Arizona on Monday. . INF/OF JT Riddle was transferred to the 60-day injured list.\n\nGiants: LHP Will Smith (back tightness) threw a light bullpen before Saturday\u2019s game and reported no discomfort, manager Bruce Bochy said. Bochy said he\u2019d wait see if any tightness developed before determining whether the All-Star closer was available to pitch Saturday. . OF Alex Dickerson (right oblique) took swings in the batting cage on and on the field and caught fly balls. . OF Mike Gerber was recalled from Triple-A Sacramento and IF Cristhian Adames was selected from Sacramento. . INF Corban Joseph was designated for assignment.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nMarlins: RHP Elieser Hern\u00e1ndez (3-5, 5.24 ERA) will pitch Sunday\u2019s series finale. Hern\u00e1ndez is 0-1 with a 6.52 ERA in three career relief appearances against San Francisco.\n\nGiants: RHP Johnny Cueto (1-0, 0.00) will make his second start since coming off Tommy John surgery.
