In fact, the Patriots offense in general had one of the worst performances a team has had in recent memory against the strong Bills defense.\n\nAccording to Tim Graham of The Athletic, Tom Brady and the Patriots had seven three-and-out series against the Bills, the passer's most since 2003. And the last quarterbacks to suffer that many three-and-outs in a game against the Bills? Ryan Tannehill and Tim Tebow.\n\nTom Brady hasn't experienced seven three-and-outs since 2003.\n\n\n\nThe last quarterbacks who endured as many three-and-outs against Buffalo were Ryan Tannehill and Tim Tebow. https://t.co/h5ltcOkPNx\n\n\n\n\u2014 Tim Graham (@ByTimGraham) September 30, 2019\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nNeedless to say, that isn't exactly great company for Brady to be keeping. Tebow lasted only three years in the NFL and failed to complete 50 percent of his career passes while Tannehill was a low-level starter and now is serving as a backup for the Tennessee Titans.\n\nObviously, Brady is a much better player than either Tannehill or Tebow, but it's still worth noting that he and the offense had some problems moving the ball against Buffalo.\n\nBrady has had issues over the course of his last three starts against the Bills. While the Patriots have won all three games, Brady has posted mediocre numbers, throwing for 600 total yards, three touchdowns, and three interceptions while completing only 55.6 percent of his passes. That's part of the reason Brady thought the Patriots offense \"could do better than that\" despite their victory.\n\nStory continues\n\nNew England still has a solid team in totality, so they are able to overcome issues to win. Still, it's worth noting how rough the offensive performance was against the Bills, and they'll have to figure out a way to produce more on the offensive side of the ball when they need to take on some of the league's better defenses.\n\nClick here to download the new MyTeams App by NBC Sports!
