But it represents only the beginning of what has to happen if Joe Biden is to halt the corrosive effect of a continuing barrage of unsubstantiated allegations and wild conspiracy theories that Trump and his fellow Republicans have spread.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFew know that better than 2004 Democratic nominee John F. Kerry, who when he was running for president saw the Silver Star that he received for valor in the Vietnam War tarnished by an organization that called itself Swift Boat Veterans for Truth. The group began with a news conference and a relatively modest television ad buy in which they claimed Kerry\u2019s actions in Vietnam did not warrant the decorations he received. By the time they were done with Kerry, \u201cswiftboat\u201d \u2014 the 50-foot aluminum craft Kerry skippered in Southeast Asia \u2014 had entered the political lexicon as a verb, describing a particularly lethal kind of smear campaign.\n\nOf course, there are plenty of differences between what happened then and what is going on now: While the attacks on Kerry came from a fringe group, Biden faces of chorus of disinformation that is being led from the Oval Office. Kerry had to contend with right-wing radio and Internet networks that spread via email. But social media had yet to emerge as an even more potent signal amplifier. Facebook was in its infancy, and Twitter had yet to be invented.\n\nStill, the tactic is the same: a jujitsu move to turn a candidate\u2019s asset \u2014 in Kerry\u2019s case his military record, and in Biden\u2019s his foreign policy expertise \u2014 into a liability. Biden could learn from some of the mistakes that Kerry made. Chief among them was trusting the advisers who initially warned the 2004 nominee against a forceful response, fearful that it would only elevate the accusations against him.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAt an appearance last Friday sponsored by the University of Chicago\u2019s Institute of Politics, Kerry reflected on what he did wrong and what that suggests for Biden. He commended a speech that Biden had given a couple of days before, in which the former vice president called for Trump\u2019s impeachment on the grounds that he is \u201cshooting holes in the Constitution, and we cannot let him get away with it.\u201d\n\nKerry told interviewer David Axelrod, the veteran Democratic strategist who now directs the institute, that Biden\u2019s speech was a good start, but added: \u201cHe\u2019s got to keep repeating it. He\u2019s going to have to bang away.\u201d He recalled that his campaign had counted on traditional media to set the record straight, and that indeed, stories doing so had run on the front pages of every major newspaper in the country.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t enough. \u201cThis was sort of a novel event in terms of fake news, and the miscalculation was that it\u2019s been answered, and the problem is when television is pounding away at it \u2014 and now we have a whole new set of platforms in social media \u2014 so that\u2019s just not enough,\u201d Kerry said. \u201cIt was a bitter lesson, obviously. We should have run ads. We should have countered it every day. We should have been out there in their face and calling them out on it.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe experience of 2004 also suggests that both Bidens must be as transparent as possible. Kerry resisted releasing his military records, raising what turned out to be unfounded suspicions that he was hiding something significant. (The new information in them turned out to be a transcript of his mediocre college grades.) If there is something anywhere that is incriminating or embarrassing, the Bidens should get it out now.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t let up,\u201d Kerry advised Biden. \u201cKeep pointing out where the corruption is today. Keep pointing out who it is who\u2019s told x-number of thousands of lies to the nation and keep pumping out there the findings that have shown [Biden] did no wrong. . . . I believe the American people ultimately will latch on to the truth. I believe that. But you\u2019ve got to force feed it.\u201d And get ready to do it over and over again.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Biden shouldn\u2019t allow Trump to \u201cswiftboat\u201d him.", "authors": ["Karen Tumulty", "Columnist Covering National Politics"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/mZ23ndUejuyEgJczat16UugqhoI=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XULUK7HPTAI6TCPL5RLM2QKHGI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
