As we moved in, white folks moved out because they were afraid of what our family represented.\u201d\n\nShe continued, \u201cI want to remind white folks that y\u2019all were running from us. This family, with all the values that you read about, you were running from us. And you\u2019re still running because we\u2019re no different than the immigrant families that are moving in, the families in Pilsen. The families that are coming from other places to try and do better. But because we can so easily wash over who we really were \u2014 because of the color of our skin, because of the texture of our hair \u2014 that\u2019s what divides countries, the artificial things.\u201d\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN", "description": "On Tuesday at the Obama Foundation Summit in Chicago,\u00a0former first lady\u00a0Michelle Obama accused \"white folks\" of running from \"us,\" while recounting her | Clips", "authors": ["Pam Key"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/michelle-obama-book-cover-photo-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
