U.S. private equity firm Oaktree Capital gained control of Billabong and Quiksilver over the past three years following troubled efforts by the companies to expand globally.\n\nSinger and Warbrick will gain shares in Kathmandu as will Rip Curl CEO Michael Daly, who will continue in his role and report to Kathmandu Chief Executive Xavier Simonet, the companies said in the statement.\n\nClothing retailers around the world are paring back brick-and-mortar operations to compete with online giants like Britain\u2019s ASOS Plc (ASOS.L) and low-cost \u201cfast fashion\u201d chains such as Zara, owned by Spain\u2019s Industria de Diseno Textil SA (ITX.MC).\n\nThe fiercer competition has coincided with broader economic headwinds which have prompted central banks to cut lending rates, making it cheaper to buy out other companies.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing rates being cut around the world, which means the cost of capital for foreign entities is getting much cheaper... so we\u2019ll probably see more M&A because of that,\u201d said Daniel Cuthbertson, managing director of Value Point Asset Management.\n\nAfter buying Rip Curl, Kathmandu said it would have 341 of its own stores around the world, plus 254 licensed stores in Australia, New Zealand, North America, Europe, South East Asia and Brazil.", "description": "New Zealand outdoor clothing maker Kathmandu Holdings said it will buy Rip Curl Group for A$350 million ($236 million) in a deal that sees the last of Australia's big three surf brands fall to overseas control.", "authors": ["Byron Kaye", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
