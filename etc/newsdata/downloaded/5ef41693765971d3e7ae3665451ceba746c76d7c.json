Then a lump under his right eye. His mother shuffled him from doctor to doctor, hospital to hospital until a biopsy finally came back with a diagnosis.\n\n\u201cThe doctor pulled out a picture of [Joseph] Merrick and told me this is what I will look like,\u201d Eddy Newton, 47, recalled to Fox News. \u201cAnd that I probably wouldn\u2019t live past my eighth birthday.\u201d\n\nJoseph Merrick was, of course, the 19th-century British man who became the poster child for neurofibromatosis, better known as \u201cElephant Man\u201d syndrome. Just a few years shy of 50 \u2013 Newton has defied the odds and is one of the oldest persons to survive such a severe strain of the condition.\n\nWOMAN BATTLING RARE 'SUICIDE DISEASE' HAS LEG AMPUTATED IN HOPES OF FINDING RELIEF FROM CHRONIC PAIN\n\nBut each day brings a succession of battles to stay alive. To date, the native of Riverside, Calif., has had to have more than 30 major surgeries, and more than 50 minor ones, to control the rampant and deadly disfiguration. When he was just 7 years old, a doctor removed a 7.5-pound tumor from his cheek.\n\nYet the most challenging aspect of living with \u201cElephant Man syndrome\u201d has been contending with the deep psychological scars that it renders and the taunting that comes from his physical appearance.\n\n\u201cThere was a lot of bullying, and I changed schools several times,\u201d Newton recalled of his turbulent childhood. \u201cBut there were good people too. I\u2019ll always remember my first day of elementary [school], and a classmate pushed his cheek out to imitate me. One girl saw it, and she jumped off the chair and fought him over it.\u201d\n\nMEDICAL MIRACLES: CHILD BURN VICTIMS IN SYRIA BROUGHT TO US FOR LAST SHOT AT LIFE\n\nEven today, Newton still marvels at the adults who mock him \u2013 and he marvels at those who boldly come to his defense. He recalled walking into a local diner just a couple of weeks ago, when a man who was there with his family immediately started bellowing \u201cOh my God, I would put a gun to my face if I looked like that!\u201d\n\n\u201cA big biker stood up \u2013 he must have been about 6\u20199\"--and warned him to sit down before he endured the most embarrassing six seconds of his life,\u201d Newtown recounted.\n\nThe disease has caused tumors to sprout wildly throughout his skull, producing extreme disfiguration and chronic pressure on his brain. That results in debilitating migraines that don\u2019t last weeks, but months.\n\n\u201cThey come in waves, sometimes lasting eight weeks,\" Newton said. \"Then there might be a seven-to-10 day period where they go down. I\u2019ve been dealing with this since I was 12 years old.\u201d\n\nAnd the surgeries are never-ending.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a wide spring in my eyelid to allow my eye to open and close. I\u2019m all cut up on my neck and torso too,\u201d Newton noted.\n\nMost recently, Newton went under the knife to remove an array of new tumors mottling his face and to revise his jawline, which doctors hope will assist with his breathing. But rounds of chemotherapy and radiation are also part of his bid to keep living and control the continuous tumors.\n\nAccording to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, neurofibromatosis is a group of three genetically distinct disorders that cause tumors to grow in the nervous system. Around half the cases are inherited, and the other half result from a \u201cspontaneous genetic mutation of unknown cause.\u201d\n\nNewton inherited the syndrome from his mother, who has a less severe case. Newton is one of less than 10,000 in the world to have been diagnosed with such a potent strain of neurofibromatosis.\n\nMedical scientists have not yet discovered how to stop neurofibromatosis from proliferating through the face and body.\n\nThe dizzying number of surgeries has left Newtown with deep facial and neck lacerations, a sagging eyelid and chin, no right ear, and only a few teeth left.\n\nThe intensity and frequency of his migraines and the ceaseless surgeries have made it difficult for Newton to find and hold down a job, and the struggle to make ends meet has resulted in dilapidated living conditions. Throughout his adult life, Newton has tried his hand at an array of positions.\n\nFor almost 20 years, the devoted music lover worked in a Southern California record store, then in a restaurant owned by a friend, followed by eight years taking random construction and building jobs in the Riverside area.\n\nBut at his lowest point, in 1996 he resorted to taking a job with the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey circus, where he traversed the American countryside as the \u201cMan with Two Faces.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was the sideshow freak,\" Newton said. \"Whenever I left the tent area, if I wanted to get something to eat, I had to cover my face with a hood so that nobody would get a free look. Emotionally, I was dead inside. I felt nothing. Finally, after nine months, I woke up and asked myself what the heck I was doing. I went to the airport in Tennessee, and I flew home.\u201d\n\nWOMEN PLASTIC SURGEONS IN AFRICA LEADING CHARGE AGAINST MOST UNDERREPORTED HEALTH EPIDEMIC IMPACTING MALES\n\nBut his wounds are his words. And rather than shirking from public view, Newton \u2013 who shrugs off the gasps and double stares \u2013 has long been speaking to students in Southern California about self-esteem issues. That trajectory began on Oct. 1997, when a disabled man in a wheelchair came into the record store where he was working and asked him to talk to some high schoolers.\n\n\u201cSomething amazing happened that day,\" he said of the first time he spoke to students. \u201cA girl named Raquel stood up and told me she was blind, but she came over to me and said she would take a picture of me with her hands. It was like I had just witnessed a miracle that day, watching this young girl come out of her shell. I knew then I wanted to help people, stop with the bullying and cyberbullying and all the attacking people do to each other.\u201d\n\nFor more than two decades, Newton has been trying to improve the lives of others. He volunteers at an orphanage in Tijuana, Mexico, and spent four months assisting the homeless after Hurricane Katrina ravished the livelihoods of thousands in 2005.\n\nRecently, he founded a non-profit ministry, \u201cEddy Unmasked.\" He hopes that in sharing his story with more teens across the country, he can foster a deeper awareness around bullying and the struggle to overcome low self-confidence.\n\nNewton\u2019s friends recently launched a GoFundMe campaign on his behalf to raise funds for his youth ministry, and enough to repair his ailing mobile home.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nNewton said his father abandoned him at just 7 years old \u2013 disappearing without so much as a goodbye. Since then, he has leaned on his mother as a beacon of love and support.\n\n\u201cMy mom has been helping me her whole life,\u201d Newton said. \u201cIt is time to take care of my mom.\u201d", "description": "At 47, Eddy Newton is now one of the oldest survivors of \"Elephant Man\" syndrome.", "authors": ["Hollie Mckay", "Hollie Mckay Has A Been A Fox News Digital Staff Reporter Since She Has Extensively Reported War Zones Including Iraq", "Syria", "Yemen", "Afghanistan", "Pakistan", "Burma", "Latin America Investigates Global Conflicts", "War Crimes", "Terrorism Around The World.
