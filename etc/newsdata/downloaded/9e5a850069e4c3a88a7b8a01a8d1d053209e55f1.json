Beyond that, however, it\u2019s a geopolitical whodunit with big implications for an already febrile region.\n\nThe unexplained attack adds to tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia over drone and missile strikes last month on Saudi oil facilities that briefly cut global supplies by 5%, the worst sudden disruption in history. The Saudis blamed Iran for that attack, with Tehran, in turn, pointing the finger at Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen.\n\nA spokesman for the National Iranian Tanker Company initially said the missiles involved in today\u2019s strike probably came from the direction of Saudi Arabia. NITC later withdrew that claim in a statement.It\u2019s unclear where else the missiles would have originated. Perhaps the NITC spokesman jumped the gun in speaking publicly.Even if Iran doesn\u2019t want to rush to point the finger at Riyadh, this attack underscores how vulnerable energy supplies in the region remain. That\u2019s bad news for oil, the global economy and broader political stability.\n\nGlobal Headlines\n\nJust in: The Nobel Peace Prize went to Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed for his work to end nearly two decades of conflict with neighboring Eritrea, easing tensions in the Horn of Africa.\n\nIn hot water | President Donald Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani is being scrutinized by federal investigators for his financial dealings following the indictment of two of his associates for violating campaign finance laws, Greg Farrell and Chris Strohm report.
