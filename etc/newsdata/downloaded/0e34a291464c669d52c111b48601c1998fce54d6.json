The trial will be part of a test conducted by the U.S. Department of Transportation\u2019s Unmanned Aircraft System Integration program, which seeks to \u201chelp tackle the most significant challenges to integrating drones into the national airspace and will reduce risks to public safety and security.\u201d\n\nFor FedEx customers who live inside designated areas and opt-in to Wing\u2019s service, Wing has designed a custom drone delivery box that will allow for the delivery of packages via drone directly to their home.\n\nPhoto: Wing\n\nMeanwhile, Walgreens plans to deliver over-the-counter medicine and other typical pharmacy goods (but not prescription drugs) by drone, with shipments potentially arriving within minutes of ordering.\u201d By speeding up delivery times, Walgreens hopes to improve the accessibility of healthcare in the area.\n\nThat said, the company with the most to gain may just be Sugar Magnolia, which through the use of drone deliveries, could extend its availability and service beyond that of other local competitors.\n\nWing\u2019s drone delivery trial follows years of planning and development by Amazon to create a similar service, which debuted its own custom package delivery drone earlier this year in June. However, aside from a select number of test flights, Amazon has yet to roll out a more widespread trial, which back in June, was expected to launch \u201cwithin months.\u201d\n\nSo while drone deliveries and flying cars may be taking a bit longer to become mainstream, little by little it seems at least one small section of our sci-fi future is becoming a reality.", "description": "After being the first drone operator to be granted its Air Carrier Certification in the U.S. earlier this year in April, Wing (a subsidiary of Alphabet) has partnered with America's FedEx, Walgreens and local craft goods retailer Sugar Magnolia to conduct a \u201cfirst-of-its-kind\u201d drone delivery trial later this...", "authors": ["David Tracy", "David Nield"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/qupdium203ycxcnh8g7j.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
