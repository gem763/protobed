At town halls and in interviews, members of the group express no regrets.\n\n\u201cI did the right thing, and I will be able to look in the mirror 30 years from now and say I was on the right side of history,\u201d Virginia Representative Elaine Luria told a packed town hall in her coastal district last week that\u2019s home to Naval Station Norfolk.\n\nLuria and the six other freshmen lawmakers who announced their support for an impeachment inquiry in a Sept. 23 opinion essay in the Washington Post are crucial to Democrats\u2019 chances of holding the House in 2020 and to the party\u2019s hopes of making inroads in former Republican strongholds in the presidential election. They won in 2018 by playing up their military or national security backgrounds and offering a moderate counter-balance to the Democratic Party\u2019s liberal wing.\n\nBacking an impeachment inquiry gives Republicans an opening to tie them to the progressive Democrats who\u2019ve been calling for Trump\u2019s impeachment for months.\n\n\u201cMake no mistake about it: backing impeachment will cost the Democrats their majority in 2020,\u201d Minnesota Representative Tom Emmer, head of the House GOP\u2019s campaign arm, said in a statement.\n\nCounter Attack\n\nThe campaign against them has already begun. Vice President Mike Pence in planning trips in the coming weeks to the districts of four Democratic freshmen who defeated Republican incumbents.\n\nSince swinging to support an impeachment inquiry, several of the vulnerable Democrats said at meetings with voters and in interviews that the events since then have only solidified their decision. Those include the White House releasing a rough transcript of Trump\u2019s call with Ukraine\u2019s president, a whistle-blower\u2019s complaint and the president himself publicly calling on Ukraine and China to investigate a Democratic opponent, former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\n\u201cThere is a national security threat in addition to the illegality of a president of the United States allegedly asking for election assistance from a foreign government,\u201d said Virginia Representative Abigail Spanberger, one of the Democrats being targeted by Pence.\n\n\u201cIf calling that out is wrong and gets me into political trouble, then why am I here if I\u2019m not here to stand up for the Constitution? Why am I in this role if I am not supposed to call out things that are endanger us and are a threat to our country?\u201d she said.\n\nLuria also said she wasn\u2019t deterred by political threats.\n\n\u2018The Right Thing\u2019\n\n\u201cI have to tell you I did not do it in regard to any political consequences. I did it knowing that in the past the district I represent has been held by a Republicans and people may say \u2018why would you do that? You might not be re-elected.\u2019 I don\u2019t care because I did the right thing,\u201d said Luria, a Naval Academy graduate who spent 20 years in the service.\n\nThe line earned Luria a standing ovation and a smattering of boos, reflecting the political divide in her district, which she won last year with 51% of the vote against Republican incumbent Scott Taylor.\n\nLuria said of the 420 calls she\u2019s received from constituents on impeachment in the last week and a half, about two-thirds were supportive. At her town hall last Thursday, those who spoke were more evenly divided.\n\n\u201cThere is no evidence so far as I\u2019m concerned, in my option, that warrants it. They have been trying to impeach this president from Day Two,\u201d said Jim Tarr, 65, a federal geologist, echoing other Trump supporters in the audience.\n\nMany attendees interviewed said that they respected Luria\u2019s judgment, as a former naval officer, about whether Trump may have imperiled national security by withholding aid to Ukraine.\n\n\u201cI think she is a taking a political risk but I like that she said she is not worried about her re-election,\u201d Conrad Schwab, who was among the crowd, said.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump has erased any lingering doubts among the swing-district Democrats who galvanized the House impeachment move two weeks ago despite the risks to their re-election chances in 2020.The decision by seven first-term Democrats elected in Trump-leaning districts to back", "authors": ["Erik Wasson", "David Welch"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/nkpmJ6BKYWnfXdYp86twKQ--~B/aD0xMzM0O3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/dfe2ea0732b0c8086b9ad2859106732b", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
