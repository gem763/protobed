More importantly, we love the Sandboxie community too much to do that.\"\n\n\"After thoughtful consideration we decided that the best way to keep Sandboxie going was to give it back to its users - transitioning it to an open source tool,\" Geftic said.\n\nUntil Sophos works out the kinks of releasing the tool as an open-source project, they've made Sandboxie a free download, available from its official website.\n\nImage: ZDNet\n\nSandboxie launched back in 2004 and in its initial version only supported Internet Explorer (IE), hence its original name of SandboxIE.\n\nIt purpose was to contain the IE browser inside a sandbox, which is a limited container where an app can run, separate from the rest of the operating system and adjacent apps. Sandboxes are an efficient way of constraining malicious code, so it can't reach sensitive parts of a user's computer.\n\nThe project became very popular, and its creator, Ronen Tzur, sold it to cyber-security firm Invincea in 2013. Along the way, Sandboxie started supporting other browsers, and was also expanded to run any other type of Windows apps, making it an ideal product to deploy inside sensitive enterprise networks.\n\nSophos acquired Sandboxie when it bought Invincea in February 2017.", "description": "Sandboxie is now a free download.
