Brodie, but he nixed the move with the hopes of remaining with the only professional club he\u2019d known at that point.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n\u201cI just didn\u2019t really get the impression I was being shopped around and my initial feeling was to stay in Toronto and that\u2019s kind of why that situation panned out the way it did,\u201d Kadri said to Sportsnet\u2019s Eric Francis.\n\n\u201cIt was nothing against Calgary. I obviously love that city and love going there as a visiting team. I just had aspirations of staying put.\u201d\n\nKadri could have been a member of the Flames.

Shortly after the rejected Flames trade, Kadri was sent to the Avalanche, much to his chagrin.\n\n\u201cYes, I was bummed out \u2013 I\u2019d be lying to you if I told you I wasn\u2019t,\u201d Kadri said.\n\n\u201cI quickly turned the page. Obviously I have a lot of memories and a lot of things I\u2019ll never forget over there. They treated me well, but now my focus is playing with the Avalanche and doing whatever it takes to win. I really want to be here.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nAs fate would have it, Kadri makes his Avalanche debut against the Flames, so there\u2019s a chance the 29-year-old might be wondering what could\u2019ve been during a game pitting two Pacific Division rivals against each other.\n\nMore NHL coverage from Yahoo Sports", "description": "Nazem Kadri might be wondering what could've been as he makes his Colorado Avalanche debut Thursday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/cqxEhR7K27vHxxPay1ij8w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD02OTkuNzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/1TdIqJ5Jb1eTBCEb5KRI5A--~B/aD03Njg7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/ef23c120-e62f-11e9-a97f-f2579ee5721c", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
