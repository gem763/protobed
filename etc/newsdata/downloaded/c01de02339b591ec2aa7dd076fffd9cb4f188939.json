She's a co-founder of #TimesUp' legal defense fund and the former chief of staff to First Lady @MichelleObama.\n\n\n\nTchen joins us in Studio 57. pic.twitter.com/qaV7eKoXjn \u2014 CBS This Morning (@CBSThisMorning) October 7, 2019\n\nAmong them is a new law in New York extending the statute of limitations for some sexual assault cases, allowing accusers a longer period of time to seek justice.\n\nAn attorney and former chief of staff to then-first lady Michelle Obama, Tchen co-founded the group\u2019s legal defense fund, which provides legal representation for women speaking out against sexual misconduct in the workplace, particularly low-income women. It is run by the National Women\u2019s Law Center in Washington.\n\nThe group\u2019s other initiatives have included ensuring gender parity in Hollywood. At the Sundance Film Festival in January, it teamed up with the University of Southern California\u2019s Annenberg Inclusion Initiative and launched the 4% Challenge, referring to the fact that only 4% of the highest-grossing movies over the last decade were directed by women. In response, a number of Hollywood stars and movie studios pledged to work on a project directed by a woman in the next 18 months.\n\nOn Monday, Tchen announced another new initiative: Time\u2019s Up Impact Lab, which will spearhead research on policies to combat workplace sexual misconduct. According to Tchen, the lab received \u201ca generous donation\u201d from Pivotal Ventures, founded by Melinda Gates and led by Jennifer Klein, the chief strategy and policy officer for Time\u2019s Up.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen an openness by companies [to address sexual misconduct], but here\u2019s the thing: They actually don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d Tchen said. \u201cWe need to build research and data. We don\u2019t know what works.\u201d", "description": "Former head Lisa Borders abruptly resigned in February after only four months in the role because her son was accused of sexual misconduct.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9b40d72000004e004ebbfa.jpeg?cache=zjnjvfv95u&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
