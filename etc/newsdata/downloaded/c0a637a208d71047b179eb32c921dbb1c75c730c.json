After wading through every possible leak imaginable the time has finally come. The Google Pixel 4 and 4 XL have been announced for real. And as an added bonus, they're both cheaper than last year's counterparts. Here's everything Aussies need to know about the new range. Read more\n\nBut a bit about the new phones first.\n\nThe 4 starts at $1,049, with the XL starting at $1,279. For comparison, last year the 3 started at $1,199 and the 3 XL started at $1,349.\n\nGoogle is placing a huge emphasis on the upgraded camera this year. While the main lens is still 12MP, the telephoto lens has been bumped up to 16MP.\n\nOn the front you'll find 8MP again, but there is a wider range of field.\n\nNight Sight, which was introduced in the Pixel 3, now includes astrophotography that is apparently capable of capturing the stars and even the Milky Way.\n\nHDR+ has also gotten an upgrade with Live HDR+ which lets you mess with the likes of highlights and shadows in the view finder - so you can see how you picture is going to turn out even before you take it.\n\nUnder the hood you'll find a new Snapdragon 855 processor, 6GB RAM and either 64GB or 128GB of storage. Google sure does love that 128GB ceiling. Hopefully it will raise the roof to at least 256GB next year.\n\nYou can read more about the new features here.\n\nHere's the rest of the main specs:\n\nPixel 4 Pixel 4 XL Operating System Android 10 Android 10 Display 5.7-inch 1080p+ with 90Hz refresh rate 6.3-inch 1440p+ with 90Hz refresh rate Body 68.8 x 147.1 x 8.2 mm, 162 grams 75.1 x 160.4 x 8.2 mm, 193 grams Camera Rear: 12.2MP \u0192/1.7 main and 16MP \u0192/2.4 aperture telephoto with 4K video resolution.

Telcos are getting their plans live as we type.\n\nTelstra\n\nThe cheapest Pixel 4 plan with Telstra is $79.13 for 15GB data on a 36 month plan. This is for the 64GB model.\n\nOf course, this isn't a lot of data and it's a long time to be locked into a contract.\n\nIf you don't mind the contract length, we'd recommend upgrading to the 60GB a month plan for $89.13 a month.\n\nOr if you'd prefer a 24-month plan we would be looking at the $103.70 a month plan that comes with 60GB data.\n\nThe same goes for the Pixel 4 XL, our pick is the 24-month 60GB plan, which will set you back $113.29.\n\nOf course, if you'd prefer 128GB storage on your device it's going to cost extra.\n\nIf you grab your Pixel through Telstra before January 13, you'll get a bonus Google Nest Hub.\n\nTelstra Pixel 4 64GB Plans (24 months)\n\nTelstra Pixel 4 128GB Plans (24 months)\n\nTelstra Pixel 4 XL 64GB Plans (24 months)\n\nTelstra Pixel 4 XL 128GB Plans (24 months)\n\nTelstra Pixel 4 64GB Plans (36 months)\n\nTelstra Pixel 4 128GB Plans (36 months)\n\nTelstra Pixel 4 XL 64GB Plans (36 months)\n\nTelstra Pixel 4 XL 128GB Plans (36 months)\n\nOptus\n\nThe cheapest Optus plan is the 64GB Pixel 4 which is $70 a month for 4GB data on a 36-month plan.\n\nWe definitely don't recommend opting for this.\n\nInstead, consider the $93 a month 60GB plan, which only runs for 24-months.\n\nAgain, it will cost more to go for a 128GB Pixel 4 or any of the 4 XL models.\n\nIf you go with Optus before December 31, you'll get a bonus Harman Kardon Citation One Speaker with Google Assistant.\n\nOptus Pixel 4 64GB Plans (24 months)\n\nOptus Pixel 4 128GB Plans (24 months)\n\nOptus Pixel 4 XL 64GB Plans (24 months)\n\nOptus Pixel 4 XL 128GB Plans (24 months)\n\nOptus Pixel 4 64GB Plans (36 months)\n\nOptus Pixel 4 128GB Plans (36 months)\n\nOptus Pixel 4 XL 64GB Plans (36 months)\n\nOptus Pixel 4 XL 128GB Plans (36 months)\n\nVodafone\n\nIf you order with Vodafone before October 23, you'll get a bonus JBL Link 10 Wireless Portable Speaker.\n\nVodafone Pixel 4 64GB Plans (24 months)\n\nVodafone Pixel 4 128GB Plans (24 months)\n\nVodafone Pixel 4 XL 64GB Plans (24 months)\n\nVodafone Pixel 4 XL 128GB Plans (24 months)\n\nVodafone Pixel 4 64GB Plans (36 months)\n\nVodafone Pixel 4 128GB Plans (36 months)\n\nVodafone Pixel 4 XL 64GB Plans (36 months)\n\nVodafone Pixel 4 XL 128GB Plans (36 months)\n\nAs Gizmodo editors we write about stuff we like and think you'll like too.
