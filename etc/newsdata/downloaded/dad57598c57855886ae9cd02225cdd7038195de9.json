Some days I couldn\u2019t even drink water \u2014 I could never get the balance of liquids right.\u2019\n\nVanessa in 2001 (Picture: Getty Images Europe)\n\nShe\u2019s spoken about her health struggle (Picture: Rex Features)\n\nThe cause of her worsening symptoms was that the gastric band had slipped, and doctors advised that she would need gastric bypass surgery to correct it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe surgeries saw Vanessa drop from a size 18 to a size 12, and the broadcaster says she doesn\u2019t have any regrets despite the pain she went through.\n\nShe explained: \u2018It was hell, but definitely worth it, though I wish I hadn\u2019t had so many years struggling with the band.\n\n\u2018It affected my mood and social life \u2013 as well as making me so sick. But I\u2019m here now and not looking back.\u2019\n\nVanessa had previously been open about her struggles with her weight, and revealed she turned to food to help her cope with heartbreak.\n\nShe previously told Bella magazine: \u2018After my husband left I was properly heartbroken, and couldn\u2019t eat, and for the first time I lost a hell of a lot of weight and I began to get happier again.\n\n\u2018So the more I ate again and the weight went back on.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
