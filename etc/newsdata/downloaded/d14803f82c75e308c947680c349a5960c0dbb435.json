There, she was asked why Imaginary has funded more women founders than men (it has just happened that way, suggested Massenet). She was also asked about starting a brand and enumerated the ways that it has become dead simple to do it, from services like Shopify that make launching a storefront easy, to third party logistics companies that make shipping product a cinch, to services like Affirm that make it easier to get paid.\n\nMassenet, of course, noted the challenges of operating in a sea of other brands, many of which are inclined to copy one another. In fact, she recounted that when Net-a-Porter launched, it did so, to her great aggravation, with copy published sideways and upside down on its website \u2014 a move that was then replicated by rivals that believed the mistake was by design.\n\nBut she also underscored the reasons that direct-to-consumer brands should, if they can swing it, set up actual brick-and-mortar spaces, which a growing number are doing.", "description": "Natalie Massenet, the fashion entrepreneur who founded the designer fashion portal Net-a-Porter, chaired the British Fashion Council for four years and today runs Imaginary Ventures, a venture firm that\u2019s focused on consumer startups, took the stage a bit ago at Vanity Fair\u2019s New Establishment Summit.
