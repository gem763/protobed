Aside from convention-challenging, glass ceiling-shattering, nonconformist ways, their most memorable outfits comprise candyfloss-hued clouds of tulle. And, this season, they are bang on trend.\n\n\u201cThe material itself transcends all eras,\u201d says London fashion week designer Ryan Lo, who has used tulle \u201cfor as long as I can remember\u201d. He has found a fanbase in the likes of Elle Fanning and Maisie Williams as a result. \u201cWe knit it, gather it, smock it, use it as a petticoat, make ruffles, flowers \u2013 the possibilities are endless.\u201d For AW19 his references run a gamut of epochs, retaining the \u201cserious period dreamy quality\u201d.\n\nFellow tulle aficionados Molly Goddard (creator of that Killing Eve pink gown) and Simone Rocha \u2013 the women who have given tulle cool credentials for the 21st century \u2013 both took it to new heights, while keeping it rooted in reality. See A-line dresses worn with tapered trousers at the former, transparent teamed with PVC bralets at the latter.

At Peter Pilotto, it came in rainbow hues; at Dior, Maria Grazia Chiuri\u2019s full skirts were peppered with a punky plaid pattern; and it was tiered, ruched and ruffled at Huishan Zhang. \u201cThere is a sense of nostalgia and romance in everything I do \u2013 soft and feminine,\u201d says Zhang, who was inspired by the starlets of the 50s. \u201cTo me, tulle is there to soften a texture or to add this frill and femininity to a frame.\u201d\n\nIn construction and styling, it\u2019s a trend moving the fabric on from its slightly saccharine reputation, says Lo, who uses nylon instead of silk tulle. \u201cI want both Hello Kitty kawaii and grownup polish. The plasticky feel gives a more subversive touch to otherwise stuffy old pieces.\u201d", "description": "Made famous by everyone\u2019s favourite assassin, Villanelle, this versatile material has find its way from saccharine to subversiveGallery: the season\u2019s best tulleRead more from the autumn/winter 2019 edition of The Fashion, our biannual fashion supplement", "authors": ["Scarlett Conlon"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2686374bd71c55dac22b697b0f9e038441c73988/0_954_4032_2418/master/4032.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=fc9a553ebb49e080b8a0c8ac9c385c1e", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
