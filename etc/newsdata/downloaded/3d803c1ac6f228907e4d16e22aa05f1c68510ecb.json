In most cases, the re-wearing of a near-\u00a3500 dress is hardly news, but royalty (of the literal and celebrity kind) in clothes we\u2019ve already seen has always captured the public\u2019s imagination. Harper\u2019s Bazaar have an entire gallery dedicated to every article of clothing Kate Middleton has reworn, as well as one dedicated to general celebrity outfit repeats.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTiffany Haddish was crowned America\u2019s thrifty sweetheart for rewearing her $4,000 Alexander McQueen dress an unprecedented five times (still probably not quite enough to properly justify its cost-per-wear) and Keira Knightley became a prudent legend when she was spotted in a customised version of her (albeit Chanel) wedding dress on multiple occasions.\n\nTiffany Haddish was crowned America\u2019s thrifty sweetheart for rewearing her $4,000 Alexander McQueen dress (Picture: Matt Sayles/A.M.P.A.S/Getty Images)\n\nWe are obsessed with famous people daring to wear something more than once, as it feels relatable: a \u2018celebs \u2013 they\u2019re just like us!\u2019 moment of fashion faux pas or frugality. But if anything, in recent years we have become \u2018just like them\u2019, with insatiable appetites for new outfits, our wardrobes slowly morphing into ceaseless conveyor belts of polyester.\n\nA need for new outfits per post has been an issue for fashion bloggers and influencers, our newest type of celebrity, for several years. But it\u2019s something that increasingly affects anyone with an Instagram account.\n\nThough not necessarily privy to the same massive amounts of money and freebies from designers, having platforms and audiences of your own online (however small) has meant that outfit repetition has become a much-missed thing of the past for many. According to 2017 research by environmental charity Hubbub, 41 per cent of all 18-25-year-olds feel the pressure to wear a different outfit every time they go out, unsurprisingly rising to 47 per cent for young women.\n\nLast year, research by Barclaycard showed almost one in 10 Brits partake in a rising trend called \u2018snap and send back\u2019 \u2013 buying clothes solely to post a photo of them online, and then sending them back immediately for a refund. They stated it was in part fueled by the hashtag #OOTD (outfit of the day).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe rise of social media has coincided with the rise of sites that seem to exist only to provide cheap, one-off garments that are made to be snapped in once. E-tailors Miss Pap, I Saw it First, Boohoo and Pretty Little Thing all have whole sections on their sites dedicated to dresses for a fiver, and Missguided came under fire this year for releasing a bikini that cost just \u00a31.\n\nThe fact that not purchasing a new outfit for just one month is posed as a challenge shows how normalised constant spending on clothes has become\n\nBack in the day, cost-effective alternatives like George and Primark were cheap, but you were still expected to wear your purchases more than once. Not everyone is #blessed with #gifted items, but with fast fashion showing no signs of slowing down, your bank balance no longer stands in the way of ensuring you can keep up with the Kardashians.\n\nThe ramifications of fast fashion on the environment are well known. The apparel industry accounts for 10 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions and is the second largest industrial polluter after oil. Workers are continually exploited in the creation of cheap garments.\n\nThere have been several attempts to combat the wastefulness: recycling initiatives by shops like M&S, H&M and Intimissimi reward shoppers with money off for donating unwanted clothes. Breathing life into worse for wear clothes through upcycling is a re-emerging trend. Thrift shopping is experiencing a boom, and this year saw Oxfam launch Second Hand September, a campaign encouraging consumers not to buy new clothing for 30 days.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe fact that not purchasing a new outfit for just one month is posed as a challenge shows how normalised constant spending on clothes has become.\n\nThe days of investing in classic pieces feel increasingly far away . Staples like the \u2018little black dress\u2019, the \u2018plain white tee\u2019, and a sturdy pair of multi-wear jeans simply aren\u2019t valued in the same way they were a few years back. But quality over quantity is sustainable for your wallet and more importantly, the world.\n\nAnd, if all else fails, there is always the option of simply sharing fewer pictures.\n\nMORE: Meghan Markle is being a birth \u2018brat\u2019 and I love her for it\n\nMORE: I made a 16th century shirt and it taught me about the crisis of fast fashion\n\nMORE: New Look is wrong to slash prices \u2013 consumers no longer want fast fashion\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "The Duchess of Sussex wearing an old dress to the WellChild Awards 2019 was a welcome move in the age of fast fashion and Instagram's #OOTD.", "authors": ["Yomi Adegoke", "Journalist"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_90473206_1571410065.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
