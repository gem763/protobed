Then you slam face-first into the wall of text that is the patch notes, and your enthusiasm deflates like a punctured whoopee cushion. Reading is a lot of work. What if someone could just read the patch notes for you?\n\nThat\u2019s the approach Supergiant Games\u2019 narrative-driven roguelite Hades has been taking with its big updates, bolstered by a suitably story-centric twist. The game\u2019s patch notes include a video of its disembodied narrator reading each and every word in a deliberate yet still dramatic tone. It makes for an almost ASMR-like experience that nonetheless feels like it belongs in Hades\u2019 universe. Very few people can make phrases like \u201creduced power scaling from improved rarity\u201d feel like gateways to adventure, and yet, he finds a way. Today, I listened to him read the patch notes for the game\u2019s new \u201cSuperstar\u201d update for more than 16 minutes. I do not regret having spent my time that way.\n\nContrast this with other games\u2019 patch notes, which unceremoniously bombard you with de-contextualised stats and other granular details in a way that feels divorced from the larger experience of being immersed in the game. Patch notes are necessary in this age of constantly updating \u201clive\u201d games, but they\u2019re almost unanimously dull and unappealing. They are a slog. Instead of reading them, maybe you go to a news site or Reddit and try to suss out the highlights. Or maybe you just jump into the game and hope for the best. Or maybe you\u2019re a lapsed player hoping to dive back in, but the looming specter of information overload convinces you to continue keeping your distance.\n\nI\u2019d love to see more developers take a crack at making patch notes feel fun \u2014 or, at least, momentous. I think the latter is what Hades does especially well. Major updates are capital-E Events, and even in its patch notes, Hades pulls out all the stops. Will patch notes ever be a rollicking great time? Probably not; they include phrases like \u201creduced power scaling from improved rarity,\u201d after all. But video games are an entertainment medium, and game designers are clever people. Punch them up a little! Or at least find somebody with a cool voice to read them for you.", "description": "We\u2019ve all been there: Your favourite game drops a big update, and you\u2019re desperate to find out what\u2019s changed.
