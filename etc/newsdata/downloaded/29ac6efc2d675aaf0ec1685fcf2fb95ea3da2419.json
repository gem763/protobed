The nocturnal crustaceans aren't afraid to tell a predator to back off.\n\nBut scientists just learned it's more than the ominous snapping of their pincers that wards off enemies.\n\nAfter studying the way the crabs communicate when threatened, a team of researchers at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography has discovered the crabs have another noisy line of defence \u2014 their stomachs.\n\n\"I was pretty blown away,\" marine biologist Maya deVries told As It Happens host Carol Off. \"They are communicating with their stomachs.\"\n\nThe findings were published this week in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B.\n\nFeeling crabby? Rumbling stomach? For ghost crabs, it's both. Scripps's Jennifer Taylor & former postdoc <a href=\"https://twitter.com/deVriesMaya?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@deVriesMaya</a> found that these <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/crabs?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#crabs</a> use a structure in their stomach, the gastric mill, to communicate when agitated.

But getting a window into the insides of an agitated crab proved difficult.\n\n\"We needed to see the gastric mill actually moving at the same time that the sound was being produced,\" deVries said. \"That's actually really tricky to do!\"\n\nProfessor Maya deVries was a post-doc fellow at Scripps Institution of Oceanography and the co-author of a new study on crab communication. (Submitted by Maya deVries)\n\nEventually, the researchers teamed up with medical doctors at UC San Diego Hillcrest Medical Center and they hatched a plan to X-ray the crabs.\n\n\"This is definitely the first time that they had stuck crabs into this machine before,\" deVries said. \"But it worked.\"\n\nWhile sporting X-ray protective gear, deVries and her team used remote-controlled Hexbug toys to mimic the crabs' predators.\n\nMaya deVries says the researchers used robotic remote-controlled Hexbug toys to test how the crabs reacted to a predator. (Dr. Emily L.A. Kelly)\n\nAccording to deVries, the whole set-up was \"a pretty wild scene.\"\n\nBut in the end, the team captured clear video evidence of the crab grinding its gastric mill in sync with the mysterious sound.\n\n\"It's really neat because this means that this behaviour, that is so important for them for defending territory and fighting with other crabs, this actually frees up their claws for them to still be able to make the sound with a different part of their body,\" deVries said.\n\n\"It's highly possible that there are a lot of other animals that are doing this and we just haven't discovered it yet.\"\n\nWritten by Kate Cornick and John McGill.
