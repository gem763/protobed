WITCH HUNT!\u201d his campaign said in one fundraising text message sent Tuesday. \u201cI need you on my Impeachment Defense Team.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss: Trump campaign capitalizes on impeachment threat, raising millions from supporters this week; state-level Republican group is fundraising with an \u2018Impeach This\u2019 T-shirt\n\nIn the 24 hours that followed Pelosi\u2019s Tuesday announcement, Trump and the Republican National Committee raised $5 million from online donors in all 50 states, campaign manager Brad Parscale said. In addition to the online money, he was expected to have raised $5 million for his reelection from a Wednesday night fundraiser, followed by an additional $3 million from a Thursday morning breakfast, according to an RNC official.\n\n\u201cHuge groundswell of support leading to Trump landslide in 2020!\u201d Parscale tweeted Wednesday.\n\nThe swell of contributions comes right before next week\u2019s third-quarter fundraising reporting deadline and will further pad what is already expected to be a massive haul. More than a year out from the November 2020 contest, his campaign and the RNC have already reported pulling in more than $210 million since the start of 2019, Federal Election Commission records show. That\u2019s more than all the current Democrats seeking to replace him raised combined during that period.\n\nBut he\u2019s not the only one trying to cash in on the impeachment fervor, which stems from his efforts to get Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a potential 2020 rival, and his family. None of the allegations against Biden or his son Hunter, who worked for a Ukrainian gas company, have been substantiated.\n\nBiden, too, saw an uptick in donations last weekend after news of Trump\u2019s conversation with the Ukrainian president broke, according to his campaign. He\u2019s running ads on Facebook urging supporters to \u201cstand with Joe.\u201d And his campaign says he has had his best week of fundraising since his second week as a candidate.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump sat in the Oval Office asking a foreign leader to investigate Joe Biden\u2019s family because he knows Joe Biden will make sure he\u2019s a one-term president,\u201d one online ad states. \u201cDon\u2019t let the president get away with this gross abuse of power.\u201d\n\nThe Democratic National Committee similarly reported a surge in fundraising after sending out a fundraising appeal late Tuesday urging donors to \u201cstand with Speaker Pelosi as the House moves forward with an official impeachment inquiry.\u201d", "description": "Trump and the Republican National Committee raised $5 million from online donors, campaign manager Brad Parscale said.
