Apparently stubborn to adhere to the law, liquor was again confiscated the past weekend.\n\nGrassy Park police spokesperson Warrant Officer Wynita Kleinsmith says police and a liquor officer had an integrated operation with other law enforcement agencies and the Western Cape Liquor Authority.\n\n\u201cOfficers observed the premises, in Kers\u00adhout Street, Lotus River, and saw that liquor was being sold [from the premises]. When entering the place, liquor [found at] the premises was confiscated. The 48-year-old suspect was arrested,\u201d Kleinsmith says.\n\nThe same evening, premises in 6th Avenue was also searched and liquor was seized there as well.\n\nA 38-year-old man was arrested.\n\nKleinsmith confirms both suspects were arrested on charges of selling liquor without a liquor licence.\n\nAn amount of 284 860F was confiscated at both premises.\n\nTwo weeks ago, on Friday 30 September, police went to the same premises in Kers\u00adhout Street and also confiscated liquor at the unlicensed shebeen.\n\nAt the previous operation, more than 70 000F liquor, freezers on the premises and a undisclosed amount of cash were confiscated.\n\nThe next evening, the same premises were searched and liquor to the amount of 103 590F was confiscated. A 15-year-old was arrested on charges of selling liquor without a valid liquor licence.\n\nThe suspects have since appeared in court on charges of selling liquor without a licence.", "description": "A follow-up police operation at a popular shebeen in Lotus River resulted in liquor being confiscated and a man being arrested on Friday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://graph.facebook.com/10227041841/picture", "published_at": "2016-10-11"}
