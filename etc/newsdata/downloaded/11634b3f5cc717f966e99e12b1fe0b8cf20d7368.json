This could just be a coincidence but also, we\u2019ll probably end up watching this on the next season of Keeping Up With The Kardashians so \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af.\n\nRighto, so according to E!News, Kylie and sister Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian were snapped enjoying a gals night at The Hyde nightclub in West Hollywood. Khlo\u00e9\u2019s ex-husband Lamar Odom was also spotted at the club with his girlfriend, Sabrina Parr. It\u2019s unclear whether or not the exes exchanged polite peasantries or just made awkward eye contact but again, we\u2019ll probably find out next season.\n\nKylie and Travis Scott \u2013 parents of wee angel Stormi Webster \u2013 are reportedly \u201ctaking space apart\u201d after being together for more than two years. Neither party confirmed the split\u2026 that is until Kylie took to her socials to deny she had that \u201c2am date\u201d with Tyga.\n\nThe internet makes everything 100 times more dramatic than what it really is. There was no \u201c2am date with Tyga\u201d. You see me drop two of my friends off at a studio that he happened to be at. \u2014 Kylie Jenner (@KylieJenner) October 3, 2019\n\n\u201cTravis and I are on great terms and our main focus right now is Stormi,\u201d she continued. \u201cOur friendship and our daughter is priority.\u201d\n\nSources have told multiple outlets that Kylie and Travis\u2019 split is not official.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a firm split. They\u2019ve been fighting again, but have still seen each other within this last month.\u201d\n\nAbout a gazillion rumours have since hit the internet, each claiming to know the reason behind the split. According to Entertainment Tonight, Kylie wanted Travis to be \u201cmore dedicated to the family.\u201d Again, this is from a mysterious source so grain of salt.\n\n\u201cKylie is young, but she really wants the traditional family life. She has seen her older sisters with big families and multiple kids and she wants the same,\u201d the source continued.\n\nBut ultimately, their \u201cpriorities are different\u201d right now.\n\nThe source added Kylie also has some trust issues, claiming Travis was caught \u201cmessaging another girl on Instagram.\u201d\n\nAnd then, there\u2019s Travis\u2019 alleged secret girlfriend. I just \u2013 it\u2019s too much. But if you want to read more about said secret girlfriend, aggressively click on the below.\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, Travis has absolutely denied these cheating rumours. In an Instagram Story posted over the weekend, he wrote: \u201cIt\u2019s really affecting when u see false things said about u once again these false stories about me cheating are just simply not true. Focusing on life, music, and family at this moment is what\u2019s real.\u201d", "description": "Kylie Jenner\u00a0has been spotted at the same club as ex-beau\u00a0Tyga\u00a0just days after denying they shared a \"2am date\" with him.", "authors": ["Steffanie Tan"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2017/09/KylieTygaPregnancy.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
