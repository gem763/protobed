Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Wednesday, 2nd October.\n\n1. A synchronized slowdown\n\nWall Street is set for more heavy losses at the opening Wednesday after the weakest reading in 10 years suggested heavily that the U.S. hasn\u2019t been spared the slowdown in manufacturing suffered by China and Europe.\n\nAt 6 AM ET, the contract was down 172 points or 0.6%, while the contract was down 19 points or 0.6% and the contract was down 0.8%.\n\nGlobal stocks had extended their losses overnight. While Chinese markets remain closed for the national holiday, the Japanese fell 0.5% and the was down 1.4% after morning trading in Europe.\n\n\u2019s monthly payrolls report at 8:15 AM ET (1215 GMT) will show how broadly the slowdown is affecting hiring, while speeches from Philly Fed President and his New York counterpart may indicate whether the data has moved the Fed\u2019s dial towards further easing.\n\n2. Impeachment tension rises\n\nThe economic backdrop is gloomy enough even without the threat of political instability in Washington, but that seems increasingly hard to avoid.\n\nThe House of Representatives prepares for a clash with the State Department over its attempts to depose two officials in relation to allegations that President Trump pressured his Ukrainian counterpart to help him dig dirt on the son of his likeliest opponent in next year\u2019s elections, Joe Biden.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo wrote to House leaders saying he wouldn\u2019t allow his officials to be \u201cbullied\u201d into testifying without proper preparation.\n\nInvestors have reacted by seeking safety in Treasury bonds. The yield has now fallen to 1.54%, while the now yields 1.63% and the 2.09%.\n\n3. WTO to update on Boeing-Airbus\n\nThe World Trade Organization is due to announce at 10 AM ET (1400 GMT) how much the U.S. is entitled to levy in tariffs against the EU in retaliation for illegal launch aid given by the Europeans to Airbus.\n\nThe ruling prepares the way for the Trump administration to open a new front in the U.S.\u2019s multiple trade disputes, although whether it will wish to pursue that opportunity with its customary gusto \u2013 given the increasingly harsh impact on the global economy so close to the election campaign \u2013 remains an open question.\n\n4. Johnson\u2019s plans trigger Brexit mini-panic\n\nEurope\u2019s stock markets had more than just the ISM survey to worry about overnight, as U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s draft plans to break the deadlock over Brexit met with a chilly response from Ireland and the EU.\n\nIn a rare move, both the and the U.K. stock market fell in tandem (usually the export-sensitive rises when the pound falls), as investors girded themselves for an increasingly likely \u201cNo Deal\u201d scenario.\n\nJohnson is set to wind up the Conservative Party\u2019s conference later with a speech that will reportedly cast the offer as a \u201ctake it or leave it\u201d deal to the EU, hoping that the euro zone\u2019s acute slowdown will cause the EU to blink at the last minute.\n\n5. Exxon Mobil (NYSE: ) warns on profit; EIA data due\n\nExxon Mobil (NYSE: ) cast a pall over the upcoming earnings season with a warning that operating profits fell last quarter for the fourth consecutive quarter in the three months to September. A regulatory filing showed all three of its major businesses slumping from a year ago.\n\nIn part that\u2019s due to lower oil prices, the outlook for which will be fleshed out later by the U.S. government\u2019s for last week. figures released Tuesday showed a surprising and sharp drop in crude inventories, putting a floor under after a precipitous slide in recent days.\n\nExxon (NYSE: ) also bemoaned weaker results in its chemical business and the lack of a tax benefit from the year-ago period. Its official results are due Oct. 31. The warnings come amid signs of a sharp slowdown in output growth due to lower prices.", "description": "Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Wednesday", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPECBI0GV_L.jpg"}
