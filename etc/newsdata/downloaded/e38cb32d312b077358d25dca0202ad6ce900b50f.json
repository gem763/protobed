Stephenson defended AT&T\u2019s place in the market, adding that where the company \u201cintends to play, it is not that crowded.\u201d He added that emphasizing the HBO name brand already distinguishes the service from its competitors, putting it in a league of its own.\n\n\u201cThis is a product that\u2019s going to be very different from anything else that you\u2019ve seen in the market so far,\u201d Stephenson said. \u201cThis is not Netflix. This is not Disney. This is HBO Max. We feel very comfortable at these investment levels that we can do something very, very significant in the market and drive some significant subscriber gains. This is going to be a meaningful business to us over the next four or five years. So we\u2019re talking a 50 million subscriber business.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is not Netflix. This is not Disney. This is HBO Max.\u201d\n\nStephenson\u2019s comments are reminiscent of what Netflix CEO Reed Hastings and Disney CEO Bob Iger have previously said about their own projects. Iger recently told CNBC that Disney+ is \u201cvery, very different than the other services out there,\u201d adding that \u201cwhile we view the others as competition, we\u2019re not fixated on the competitive side of things here.\u201d Hastings wrote in his recent third quarter earnings letter to shareholders that although \u201cnew competitors have some great titles (especially catalog titles), none have the variety, diversity and quality of new original programming that we are producing around the world.\u201d\n\nDespite the content offerings being different \u2014 AT&T is selling the idea of prestige content that people associate with the HBO name, while Disney is courting subscribers through nostalgia plays \u2014 these companies are selling similar products. They want to bring subscribers into their ecosystems, beating out time spent on other platforms. AT&T, whether Stephenson wants to admit it or not, is competing with Netflix and Disney. HBO Max is also competing with YouTube, Twitch, Fortnite, and live sports matches. Pretending that an oversaturated market doesn\u2019t play a major factor in today\u2019s streaming landscape doesn\u2019t take away from the fact that it\u2019s a busy playing field.\n\n\u201cEvery service has something to offer\u201d is essentially the message that subscribers are walking away with. But everything comes down to a few key aspects: price and content slate. AT&T hasn\u2019t announced a price tag or launch date for its service, but it\u2019s poised to do so on October 29th during a special investors day event for HBO Max.", "description": "AT&T is set to announce the launch date, price, and first offerings for its upcoming HBO Max streaming service, and CEO Randall Stephenson has a message for investors: it\u2019s not Disney, Netflix, or any of those other services.", "authors": ["Julia Alexander", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IWcDqpykxPiO7gJ05rzLku_Rick=/0x214:5472x3079/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19324891/1175540118.jpg.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
