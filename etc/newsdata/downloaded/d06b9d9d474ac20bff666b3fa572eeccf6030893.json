McCarthy has undergone a baptism by fire, dealing with the fallout of an escalating Middle East crisis and the fate of American troops caught squarely in the crossfire.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with The Washington Times on Thursday, Mr. McCarthy said Pentagon officials noticed \u201cpotential provocations with Turkey and we thought it was in the best interest of our safety of our soldiers to ensure that they move that disposition of forces until we could work out a political solution.\u201d\n\nHis comments came just hours before the U.S. and Turkey brokered a five-day cease-fire meant to allow Kurdish fighters \u2014 who have long fought alongside American forces against Islamic State in the region \u2014 to retreat to safety outside the 20-mile buffer zone along the border that Ankara is demanding.\n\nThe move to withdraw U.S. forces from the region has drawn sharp criticism on Capitol Hill as well as American troops, who fear the withdrawal has given Turkey a green light to invade and jeopardizes the gains made against ISIS in Syria in recent years.\n\nMr. McCarthy, who deployed to Afghanistan in 2001 with the 75th Ranger Regiment in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, said it was vital that troops in the field understand the basis for U.S. policy as they pull back from positions in northeastern Syria.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for us to communicate to the soldiers in those formations that we make these decisions based off the national interests and the national objectives of the country,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the interim, that was a tactical move that was made and we\u2019ll see as these discussions can continue ultimately where this drives toward.\u201d\n\nMr. McCarthy raised eyebrows earlier this week when at the Association of the U.S. Army\u2019s annual conference when he appeared to acknowledge grumbling in the ranks over Mr. Trump\u2019s Syria pullback.\n\n\u201cEverybody has opinions in the war of ideas. But, when national policy decisions are made, we salute and move on,\u201d he said Monday.\n\nLawmakers have mulled new sanctions on Turkey in the 2020 defense policy bill, which is still in negotiations.\n\nThe brief pause in the fighting on the Turkish-Syrian border, however, could drive bill negotiations into high gear.\n\nSenate Armed Services Committee Chairman James Inhofe, Oklahoma Republican, told reporters this week the talks on the National Defense Authorization Act \u201ckind of are stalling\u201d because Syria had become a more pressing issue, Defense News reported.\n\nA key deadline for the bill was missed earlier this month when the House and Senate failed to agree to a final NDAA by Oct. 1, the start of the 2020 federal fiscal year.\n\nMr. McCarthy, who served as acting Army secretary before being sworn in formally Sept. 30, said he and other top Army officials are concerned that any further delays in the bill\u2019s passage \u201cwill slow down from the tremendous momentum that we built\u201d in transforming the service to fight future challenges, primarily from rising rivals such as China and Russia.\n\n\u201cWe made some pretty bold moves because we\u2019re trying to modernize the Army in the most comprehensive way probably in the last 45 years,\u201d he continued.\n\nThe Pentagon is currently operating on a continuing resolution that was signed into law by President Trump last month and expires on Nov. 21.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s this time of year when everybody kind of quickly looks and says, \u2018OK, let\u2019s hurry up and get that bill done,\u2019 because the system will immediately slow down,\u201d Mr. McCarthy added.\n\nHe warned that if Congress fails to a regular budget, military readiness could suffer.\n\n\u201cEverybody pulls back the energy,\u201d he said. \u201cThey reduce training plans cause they don\u2019t know whether they\u2019re going to get money again or how much operational readiness, industry rates of vehicles, reduce.\u201d\n\nAccording to Army data, the production of various vehicles and weapons systems, including the UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter and Hellfire missiles, would be suspended under another continuing resolution.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to have some predictability and you have got to have that funding on time,\u201d he said, but explained that the Army has been \u201cblessed\u201d with the funding proposal that has been put forth.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
