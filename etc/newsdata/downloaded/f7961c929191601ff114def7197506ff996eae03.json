The Taliban claimed responsibility, saying its target was an intelligence services office next door.\n\nAnother 30 people were killed in a US air strike in Khoygani district in Nangarhar province in the east.\n\nVillagers and local Afghan officials said the dead were farmers working on a field of pine nuts in a densely forested area.\n\nThe American military initially stated that its drone had been targeting Isis fighters and efforts were ongoing to establish the identities of the victims.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

We are working through it now with the officials.\u201d\n\nBut Malik Rahat Gul, a clan elder, was adamant what had happened was obvious.\n\n\u201cThese workers were sitting together around a bonfire when they were hit from the air with a bomb, they were just workers,\u201d he said.\n\nThe day before, suicide bombers killed 48 people in two separate blasts.\n\nOne was in Charakar, in Parwan, where President Ghani was holding a rally and is believed to have been the intended target. The Taliban claimed credit for the explosion, which killed 26, and also for a second blast in the centre of Kabul near an Afghan army base and the US Embassy, which claimed a further 22 lives.\n\nAccording to United Nations figures, nearly 4,000 civilians have been killed or wounded in the first half of the year, with a sizeable increase in \u201ccollateral damage\u201d caused by American-led foreign forces and the Afghan army and police.\n\nFor Afghans, who have faced decades of unending conflict, the future holds little to be optimistic about.\n\nMohammed Amir Gul\u2019s brother-in-law Safi was seriously wounded in last week\u2019s Kabul bombing. It was a hazard, he pointed out, faced by people every day.\n\n\u201cSafi was just in the area going to meet someone when this happened. He has injuries to his legs and back and had to have an operation. He won\u2019t be able to work for a very long time and there would be no income for his wife and children. The rest of the family has to help out\u201d said Mr Gul, an electrical engineer.\n\n\u201cMy family and I will vote in the election, but we have heard the Taliban will target the (polling) stations as they have done in the past. It is a very great worry.\u201d\n\nHis colleague Farzaad Rahman added: \u201cMy family will vote as well. We\u2019ll vote but I just cannot see things getting better. We also know that there is fraud in elections here.\n\n\u201cSo is it worth the risk with the bombings? Who knows? I can\u2019t see much hope for the future, we thought the talks (in Doha, Qatar) would lead to something, but that isn\u2019t going to happen now, so we just carry on.\u201d\n\nThe Afghan government had been effectively excluded from the Doha negotiations between an American team, led by Zalmay Khalilzad, a former US ambassador to Afghanistan, and a Taliban delegation augmented by members of the organisation\u2019s leadership from its headquarters in Pakistan.\n\nAfghan as well as western officials had warned that the agreement envisaged by Mr Khalilzad, which would have led to the vast majority of American forces pulling out before next year\u2019s US presidential election, gave far too many concessions to the Taliban without getting anything like enough in return.\n\nMr Ghani, who had been among the critics of the proposed deal, said after the bombings: \u201cBy continuing their crimes, the Taliban have once again proven that they have no will and desire for peace and stability in Afghanistan and that all their movements are nothing but deceit.\u201d\n\nThe Afghan president also promised to take further steps to prevent civilian casualties following the drone strikes. He said he had already introduced several \u201cchecks and balances\u201d to stop night raids and other, often US-planned, military operations, which put civilians at risk.\n\nMr Ghani faces an immediate crisis after the US, soon after finishing the Doha process, accused the Afghan government of abjectly failing to fight corruption and cut more than $160m (\u00a3128m) in direct funding.\n\n\u201cWe stand against those who exploit their positions of power and influence to deprive the Afghan people of the benefits of foreign assistance and a more prosperous future,\u201d said the US secretary of state Mike Pompeo, in a damning statement.\n\n\u201cWe expect the Afghan government to demonstrate a clear commitment to fight corruption, to serve the Afghan people, and maintain their trust. Afghan leaders who fail to meet this standard should be held accountable.\u201d\n\nMr Ghani\u2019s main rival at the polls, Abdullah Abdullah, has vowed to fight corruption. Yet critics have pointed to his time as chief executive officer in a power-sharing deal and demanded to know why graft continued then.\n\nMr Abdullah lost previous elections to Mr Ghani and Hamid Karzai, the country\u2019s first president after the fall of Mullah Omar\u2019s Taliban regime. Both the elections were mired in allegations of ballot rigging.\n\nMr Karzai, who has changed his views in the past about talking to the Taliban, maintains that the Doha talks should resume. \u201cTaking note of the demands of all Afghans I call on the government of the United States to restart negotiations with the Taliban and the government of Afghanistan in an immediate move,\u201d he said.\n\nWalid Durani, a 20-year-old student, commented: \u201cKarzai has said in the past that the Taliban can\u2019t be trusted for a dialogue. Now he wants talks on a deal, which was not good for the Afghan people, to get attention. Maybe he is positioning himself for an attempt back in power if the elections end badly. One must be sceptical about what all the politicians are saying.\n\n\u201cThe main aim of the Afghan people should be to avoid getting blown up between now and the end of the week when we vote,\u201d declared Mr Durani.", "description": "The final days before Afghanistan\u2019s presidential elections are being filled with rallies and speeches, but also with a grim foreboding of the carnage that\u00a0has already claimed a lethal toll of those\u00a0murdered and maimed.
