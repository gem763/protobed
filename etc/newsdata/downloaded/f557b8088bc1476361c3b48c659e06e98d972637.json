Don\u2019t be these people.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe conductor helped them out by giving them the last remaining seat in first class, but Amanda said the situation should never have occurred.\n\nShe added: \u2018I\u2019d like to know what happens to those who remain in a spot that isn\u2019t theirs. Are there no penalties?\u2019\n\n\u2018This situation is not about my children not having manners enough to stand for the elderly. This is about a culture of bullying and entitlement.\n\n\u2018My kids and I were being fair and following rules and these two were not. They immediately switched into bully mode as they saw us approach, clearly aware that those seats were ours.\n\nHer three children had to squeeze into two seats (Picture: Manda_like_wine/Twitter)\n\n\u2018Given how easy it was for the conductor to move us to another carriage to diffuse the situation, had they been in real need, I\u2019m sure they would have gotten moved as well. Instead they broke the rules and tried to make my children and I feel powerless. I don\u2019t have time for that.\u2019\n\n\u2018I would always give up a seat, reserved or not, for someone who needed it more. But for her to tell me that my tickets meant nothing and then refuse to acknowledge me? Do people just expect you to slink away?\u2019\n\nA spokesperson for CrossCountry trains said: \u2018It\u2019s a shame when a family has reserved seats to travel together, to be let down by others who ignore the labels in the back of their chairs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018However, we\u2019ll be thanking our conductor for quickly resolving the situation and hope they all enjoyed the extra space in First Class.\u2019\n\nThey added that people would be entitled to compensation if they reserved seats and were not able to use them or find alternatives.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
