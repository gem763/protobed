Banks' clients rely on these systems being secure and continuously available -- the consequences of outages or data breaches are critically significant, both to the client and to the bank,\" he said.\n\nThere are four criteria MacLochlainn would say explains why IBM z continues to be a fit-for-purpose core banking platform, the first being continuous availability, noting that 83% of clients report near 100% availability.\n\nSee also: NAB looks at moving core banking to the public cloud\n\n\"IBM z is recognised as the most secure computing platform,\" he added as a second reason.\n\n\"IBM z is designed to support the heaviest and most data intensive workload, the system architecture has been refined over decades with this specific business use case in mind. The scale of the workloads involved would otherwise require significant numbers of distributed systems with significant uplifts in management complexity and cost.\"\n\nThe fourth, he said, is that it's a proven platform.\n\n\"References abound, as are failed projects deployed on alternative architectures,\" he said.\n\nOne of the big four banks have already contracted IBM for at least one z15.\n\nAccording to MacLochlainn, the government department of every major economy that's responsible for collecting money and dispersing money also runs these core functions on mainframes.\n\nSee also: Department of Human Services is building a new private cloud\n\n\"A population of 25 million represents a lot of tax and social security records, so the scale of the data processing is massive,\" he said.\n\n\"Collection and disbursement of monies are critical government services and require continuous availability. Citizens rightly expect to be able to access the service 365 days a year; consequently, IBM z is absolutely fit for purpose.\"\n\nRELATED COVERAGE", "description": "Australia's biggest banks and government welfare delivery are some of the major use cases down under.", "authors": ["Asha Barbaschow"], "top_image": "https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/15/c70b1ca9-4585-43e1-b2a5-f242a7d92f45/thumbnail/770x578/53a7e10b36d4ab0d7390b94576a2098a/ibm-z15.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
