A total 379 Singaporean young adults completed four online questionnaires. The first questionnaire asked participants to recall if their parents told them lies that related to eating, leaving and/or staying, misbehaviour, and spending money. Some examples of such lies were: 'If you don't come with me now, I will leave you here by yourself' and 'I did not bring money with me today, we can come back another day'. The second questionnaire asked participants to indicate how frequently as adults they lied to their parents. It asked about lies in relation to their activities and prosocial lies (or lies intended to benefit others), and exaggerations about events. Last, participants filled in two questionnaires that measured their self-reported psychosocial maladjustment and tendency to behave selfishly and impulsively.\n\nShe said: 'Our research suggests that parenting by lying is a practice that has negative consequences for children when they grow up.\n\n'Parents should be aware of these potential downstream implications and consider alternatives to lying, such as acknowledging children's feelings, giving information so children know what to expect, offering choices and problem-solving together, to elicit good behaviour from children.'\n\nThe experiment was conducted in collaboration with the University of Toronto, the University of California, San Diego, and China's Zhejiang Normal University.\n\nProfessor Setoh ceded that a limitation of the test was getting young adults to self-report on their childhood memories, which could have faded.\n\nAnd she said that future investigations should try to ascertain the reasoning behind parents' decision to lie.\n\nShe said: 'It is possible that a lie to assert the parents' power, such as saying \"if you don't behave, we will throw you into the ocean to feed the fish\", may be more related to children's adjustment difficulties as adults, compared to lies that target children's compliance, such as \"there is no more candy in the house\".", "description": "The quick-fix parenting tactic of fibbing could be detrimental over the years as it cultivates scheming, selfish and disruptive personality traits, according to psychologists in Singapore.", "authors": ["Jack Elsom For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/14/19298736-0-image-a-39_1570197156374.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
