A new study says some can benefit", "language": "en", "text": "(CNN) For decades, healthy patients were told to take a low-dose aspirin as a precaution to help prevent heart problems, but the guidelines changed this year. For patients who have had a heart attack, stroke or open heart surgery, a daily aspirin is still recommended and can be a lifesaver. But the blood-thinning effect from aspirin could cause a major bleeding event, so for many healthy patients, the daily aspirin habit was not worth the risk.\n\nA new study published in the medical journal Annals of Internal Medicine on Monday came to a different conclusion.\n\nThe study found that aspirin reduces the risk of heart problems for at-risk patients and for some patients without a known risk of cardiovascular disease. The researchers concluded that the benefits of aspirin outweigh the harms of bleeding, if you compared the risk of death from one bleeding event compared to the risk of hospitalization or death from a cardiac event.\n\nAt least 12.1% of men and 2.5% of women without a history of heart problems got a net benefit from five years of aspirin treatment, the study found. The percent benefit increased even more if you compared the risk for two bleeding events to two cardiovascular events.\n\nResearchers figured this out by looking at data from more than 245,000 healthy adults ages 30 to 79 years old in New Zealand.", "description": "For decades, healthy patients were told to take a low-dose aspirin as a precaution to help prevent heart problems, but the guidelines changed this year.
