They\u2019re the same.\u201d\n\nDemonstrating that his contempt for politicians is not confined to the rivals for the premiership in Tuesday\u2019s Israeli election, he adds with a laugh: \u201cLike Fatah and Hamas.\u201d\n\nAbu Hazima, 36, is standing on the weather-beaten deck of a boat owned by the Abu Odeh family. It should be heading 15 nautical miles into the Mediterranean to exploit a four-month-old extension to limits enforced by live fire, arrests and seizures of boats that stray past the Israeli navy\u2019s vessels. The limit has been as low as three miles \u2013 compared with 20 miles prescribed under the Oslo accords \u2013 so this ought to have been a welcome respite.\n\nBut in blockaded Gaza, life is rarely that simple. Starved of spare parts, which Israel says could be used by Hamas for military purposes, the crew has had to stay in port while a mechanic cannibalises a truck gearbox to repair the boat\u2019s broken one.\n\nAbu Hazima is not alone in seeing the leading contenders in Tuesday\u2019s election as two sides of the same coin. \u201cWe don\u2019t care who is in charge of Israel \u2013 even if it\u2019s Trump,\u201d says Issa Hassan, 22, who runs a coffee stall on the edge of the beach in Gaza. \u201cWe\u2019re like a ball being kicked between the PA [Palestinian Authority] and Hamas and Israel. We are hit by everybody.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Said Abu Odeh (left), 24, and Mohammed Abu Odeh (right), 28, in a family-owned fishing boat in Gaza. Photograph: Ali Mousa/The Observer\n\nAhmad Gharabli, 31, who runs the stall next door, agrees gloomily that \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter\u201d who is the Israeli prime minister after Tuesday. \u201cThe Jews don\u2019t like us,\u201d he says. \u201cThey don\u2019t care about us.\u201d\n\nIndifference to the election result is understandable. None of the leading candidates has highlighted the impact of a crippling 12-year economic blockade on Gaza, during which time unemployment has increased to a historic high of 46.7% (compared with 15% in the West Bank). Indeed, Gaza was largely marginal in the campaign until a few nights ago, when Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s protection officers rushed him from an election podium in Ashdod after two rockets were launched from the strip, probably by Islamic Jihad.\n\nThe footage \u2013 gleefully seized on by both Benny Gantz and Avigdor Lieberman, the former defence minister who is likely to play kingmaker if there is a hung parliament \u2013 did not enhance the prime minister\u2019s \u201cMr Security\u201d image. That, no doubt, is one reason why two days later, Netanyahu declared he saw \u201cno alternative\u201d to another war in Gaza. Despite more than 18 months of border protests, in which more than 200 Palestinians and one Israeli soldier have been killed, Netanyahu and Hamas have pulled back several times from the brink of an all-out war. Indeed, the public posture of Netanyahu\u2019s opponents has actually been fierier.\n\nGantz began his campaign for this year\u2019s first election, only five months ago, with a video boasting how he had bombed parts of Gaza \u201cback to the stone age\u201d as military chief of staff in 2014. (A Netherlands court will on Tuesday hold an initial hearing on a universal jurisdiction case brought against Gantz by a Palestinian Dutch citizen, Ismail Ziada, over the killing of six members of his family during the 2014 war.)\n\nFor this reason, some Palestinians in Gaza are less convinced than Israeli liberals that Netanyahu\u2019s removal would promise a better future.\n\nAhmed Alfalit, 48, an ex-Hamas militant, graduated from Hebrew University while serving 20 years of a life sentence for a stabbing attack in which an Israeli settler was killed. Released in the prisoner swap for Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, he now runs a private college teaching Hebrew and Israeli affairs. An avid follower of Israeli elections, he predicts Netanyahu will keep the premiership and adds: \u201cI don\u2019t think Netanyahu will start another war and I don\u2019t think the others would put Gaza in a better situation.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018I\u2019m terrified of another war,\u2019 said Roba Shabit, 21, an English trainer and student at Islamic University. Photograph: Ali Mousa/The Observer\n\nStallholder Gharabli thinks another leader would be more \u201caggressive\u201d that Netanyahu, who he thinks has \u201cunderstandings\u201d with Hamas.\n\nBut Gazans are well aware that political substance does not always match rhetoric. Noting Gantz\u2019s bellicose warning in August that a war led under his premiership against Hamas would be \u201cthe last\u201d, Roba Shabit, 21, a student at Islamic University who teaches English to graduates, says: \u201cI\u2019m terrified by the possibility of another war but I don\u2019t think Gantz will do that if he wins. I think he was appealing to voters on the right.\u201d A point in favour of this argument is that after the 2014 war, Gantz called for an easing of Gaza\u2019s dire economic conditions, in order to \u201ctilt to hope over despair\u201d in Gaza and prevent a subsequent conflict.\n\nThis raises the question of whether Netanyahu\u2019s own Gaza threat last week \u2013 like the even higher profile one to annex the Jordan Valley in the West Bank \u2013 was more than merely playing to the right before the election. Hamas is increasingly restive over what it says is Netanyahu\u2019s repeated failure to fulfil promises brokered by Egypt, the UN and Qatar to ease the blockade beyond the painfully incremental modifications enacted so far. The extreme rightwing parties that Netanyahu would need for a coalition would almost certainly prefer him to move militarily on Gaza than to order the lifting of the blockade.\n\nFor now, the frustration of Gaza\u2019s younger generation is palpable \u2013 and not just among those who have risked life and limb at the border fence each week. Nineteen-year-old Fadi Dorra has no job, but earns 10 shekels a day helping out at Hassan\u2019s beachside stall. Along with 48% of Gazans polled last year, he would like to emigrate. \u201cThere\u2019s no work here, no income.\u201d Asked who he would like to see lead Israel after the election on Tuesday, Fadi says bluntly: \u201cI don\u2019t give a shit. I don\u2019t care about it. We need work. We need to live.\u201d", "description": "On Gaza City\u2019s quayside, Palestinians fear that Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s rivals in Tuesday\u2019s poll are as belligerent as he is", "authors": ["Donald Macintyre"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2f3f9017ae27d0e3abd07945b8c0d5c9f32f4414/0_161_4200_2520/master/4200.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6538b77ebdebb39f9392cf0b52efc2ea", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
