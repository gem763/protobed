Other unions say it is inspiring them.", "language": "en", "text": "So as union officials met about a contract deal that, if approved, would end the five-week strike of some 46,000 United Automobile Workers members \u2014 one of the longest private sector strikes in recent years \u2014 Piroch was here with three vanfulls of other displaced workers from the Lordstown plant to voice dissent.\n\nAD\n\nIn the lobby of the Renaissance Center, the futuristic complex that is GM\u2019s headquarters in downtown Detroit, Piroch and other workers shouted \u201cNo vote!\u201d and \u201cInvest in Lordstown!\u201d as union executives walked by.\n\nAD\n\nThe tentative contract agreement addresses many of the central issues of the dispute, picketing members said. It provides some temporary employees with a path to full employment. And it reduces the eight-year \u201cgrow-in\u201d for new employees to be brought up to full wages of about $32 an hour to about four, before abolishing it completely by 2023.\n\nThe lower starting pay of $17 was a concession made in the years after the recession.\n\nBut with the absence of provisions to reopen the plants in Michigan, Ohio and Maryland that GM shuttered in 2018, the deal is in some ways a reminder of the larger economic forces that have eroded the status of manufacturing workers in recent years \u2014 which the union, despite its numbers, is relatively powerless to address.\n\n\u201cI need something in Lordstown,\u201d Piroch said. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason there isn\u2019t a product in Lordstown. [GM CEO] Mary Barra made $22 million with a product in Lordstown.\u201d\n\nWorkers interviewed by The Washington Post this week said that they felt their strike was worth it, both for the compromises it helped obtain and as a show of force at a time when unions had been left for all but dead.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe understand that we\u2019re fighting for working class people \u2014 it\u2019s bigger than just the UAW,\u201d said Martin Tutwiler, 42, a GM worker in Detroit. \u201cIt\u2019s about having a living wage. So you don\u2019t have to work multiple jobs to pay bills.\u201d\n\nUnion participation has been on the wane for decades, its decline paved by \u201cright to work\u201d laws passed by Republican state legislatures that have chipped away at unions\u2019 strength and succeeded at demonizing them. Meanwhile, inequality continues to widen \u2014 its line charted almost perfectly with the decline in union membership.\n\nOn Trade Unions & Inequality: This chart from IMF researchers is pretty wow \u2014 azizonomics \u2014 http://t.co/oDSACqBMOk pic.twitter.com/LJSOIfxLtW \u2014 Robert Went (@went1955) April 25, 2015\n\nOnly about 10 percent of American workers are in labor unions \u2014 a percentage that has halved since the Bureau of Labor Statistics began tracking the number in 1983.\n\nAD\n\nBut there has been a surge of energy in the world of organizing, as attention has turned to former middle class strongholds in the Midwest, like Lordstown, where workers say they feel left behind.\n\nAD\n\nStrikes are at their highest levels since the 1980s. And a hybrid form of activism that has expanded to include workers organizing across different workplaces has emerged as scrappy but effective way to pressure companies and local governments for change on issues like the minimum wage.\n\nThe UAW fight for a better contract with GM was in many ways a throwback to the decades when large numbers of autoworkers regularly shut down production at factories for better contracts.\n\nAD\n\nIt is the longest strike at GM since 1973, when a stoppage lasted 100 days. At more than 1 million work days lost \u2014 and counting \u2014 the strike is one of the largest in the private sector in the last twenty years.\n\nAnd there is a sense that the contract deal \u2014 a win for workers, because it maintained provisions GM tried to trim and added improvements \u2014 could inspire other workers.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIn social movements, you see waves of working class activity as people learn from each other,\u201d said Josh Murray, a sociology professor at Vanderbilt University and the co-author of a recent book that argues that American auto companies destroyed their capacity to compete in the 1960s because of the way they sought to ward off strikes. \u201cThere\u2019s this idea of the politics of the possible. Most working people aren\u2019t against unions or having more money and benefits, but there\u2019s a risk to doing those things. But as more and more of these things happen and people win, then more people get on board.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAbout 25,000 teachers in Chicago went on strike this week, potentially building on momentum from the West Virginia teachers strike in 2018.\n\nMary Kay Henry, president of the Service Employees International Union, said that its public service division, which represents more than a million government and school employees, had seen more strikes in the last two or three years than anytime in the last four decades.\n\nAD\n\nThat group represents 7,500 school staff \u2014 aides and special education assistants, custodians and security guards \u2014 who are striking in Chicago. Henry said that members of her union, many of whom had shown up to support UAW picket lines across the Midwest, had watched the GM strike deal with issues like health care and temporary workers, that have affected school employees as well.\n\n\u201cThe UAW GM strike and the Verizon strike the CWA did in 2016 are all indicators that working people think government officials should put more power in their hands and rebalance the power that corporations currently hold in our democracy,\u201d she said.\n\nThe GM strike has not been without costs.\n\nAD\n\nThe company has lost more than $1 billion in earnings, workers have forfeited $835 million in wages \u2014 they do not receive their paychecks during the strike \u2014 and the federal government and the state of Michigan have lost $313 million and $18 million in tax revenue, respectively, according to estimates from the East Lansing consultancy, the Anderson Economic Group.\n\nAD\n\nParts suppliers to GM facilities across the country laid off thousands of employees and reduced the hours of many more, sending unemployment claims skyward in states like Michigan and raising fears that the prolonged stoppage could tilt economically vulnerable areas into local recessions.\n\nThe full cost of the strike won\u2019t be known for weeks.\n\nAD\n\nAnd if the UAW\u2019s rank and file votes down this contract offer, it will continue.\n\n\u201cIt had to happen \u2014 it needed to happen,\u201d said GM worker Gary Zanetti, 58, picketing outside the Hamtramck Assembly plant in Detroit, a smoldering garbage can fire keeping him warm. \u201cSince the last contract, [GM] made $40 billion.\u201d\n\nThe Hamtramck plant was one of four that GM scheduled for closure, but as part of the contract negotiations, GM agreed to produce an electric truck there. Zanetti and co-workers Allan Vroman, 63, and Chris Viola, 36, were skeptical it would protect jobs, aware that electric vehicles require less labor than internal combustion engines.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d Vroman asked. \u201cAre they telling you they\u2019re going to build seven electric trucks and call it a day? Are we going to build little electric scooters?\u201d\n\nAD\n\nVroman scoffed at the $11,000 bonus GM was offering full-time workers who signed the contract.\n\n\u201cThe more money they throw at you, the more you get suspicious,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to throw 11 grand at you. Maybe you won\u2019t read page two.\u201d\n\nAbout a half-mile away at another entrance, another picketing employee, Sherwood Reason, 64, said the strike was worth the pain, even if the compromise it yielded was imperfect. He spoke about watching jobs get automated away in the plant\u2019s paint shop in his 21 years at the company.\n\n\u201cTo even get what we\u2019re looking for is kind of unrealistic, because the world is changing,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are certain things you just can\u2019t do anything about.\u201d", "description": "The strike is part of an uptick in workplace organizing in recent years, raising hopes that unions could end their decades long slide.", "authors": ["Eli Rosenberg", "Economics Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Y5HgLzPZ12BfyT9ruKXhDArtaeY=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BFF6OXHQLYI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
