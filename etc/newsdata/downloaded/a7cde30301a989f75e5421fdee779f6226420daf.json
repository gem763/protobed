This is because crash tests are carried out with dummies that correspond to the weight, height and body structure of an average male.\n\nWhile it is the law that a car has to undergo more than one type of crash test, none of them actually require a female dummy.\n\nAnd so, the cars are built accordingly: The steering wheel, airbags, headrests, and seatbelts are all aligned in such a way that a person weighing an average of 197 pounds, with a male spinal structure and a specific muscle distribution, is well protected.\n\nBut anyone with breasts or different weight distribution is left out of these vital measurements. Some crash test providers do use female dummies \u2014 but most of them are positioned in the passenger seat.\n\nMost cars are built according to male measurements.

This is partly because the backrests of the driver's seats do not cushion lighter bodies well. While women are less likely to be involved in car accidents in general, their chances of suffering more fatal injuries when they are, are much higher \u201473%, to be exact.\n\nHalf of the population is being ignored\n\nThe crash dummies scenario is quite a frightening example of how much the world, however modern it may be, is tailored, aligned, and optimized for the average man. The normal reference for design, programming, research, and even in urban planning has always been the \"default male\".\n\nBut we all know that men and women are different. Their immune systems are different, their brains function differently and their bodies are structured differently.\n\nSo why is women-specific data hardly ever collected?\n\nThe British journalist and activist Caroline Criado Perez wrote a book called \"Invisible Women: Exposing Data Bias in a World Designed for Men\", in which she writes about this problem, naming several fully-documented examples that offer a new perspective on everyday life.\n\nRead more: Taylor Swift just made a bold admission, and it's an unfortunate lesson for every woman who wants to be successful\n\nArchitects could design bathrooms differently\n\nLet's start with toilet stalls. Architects usually give men and women the same sized toilet partitions \u2014 36 inches wide and 60 inches deep \u2014 whether in public buildings, offices, cinemas, restaurants, universities or shopping malls.\n\nThis 50/50 division is even formalized in installation regulations. But, if you think about it, for quite practical reasons, it is more \"laborious\" for a woman to visit the toilet: she may have to take a one-piece off completely, place her bag on the floor, put on and take off tights, or change personal hygiene products if necessary.\n\nAll of this just requires more space and also takes longer than simply unzipping a pair of trousers. On average, women also have to go to the toilet more often, either because they are pregnant, or have a bladder infection or bring their children in with them (statistically, women still do this more often).\n\nIn order to prevent the long queues in front of the ladies' toilet, future architects could simply plan to build more female toilet stalls \u2014 even if this means taking space from the male toilets. But so far, this hasn't happened, so the queues in front of the female toilets remain long.\n\nThe familiar queues in front of the ladies' toilets are a result of centuries of gender bias in architecture and design.

But she won't be able to reach the upper supermarket shelves and an average kitchen worktop in a home will actually be a little bit too high for her.\n\nCritics will say that all of this can apply to short, thin men as well.\n\nAnd yes, while this is true, short men (who are already a relatively small group) are random victims of such inventions as opposed to being systematically kept out of them. Additionally, despite being short and thin, these men are still included in medical research that completely excludes women.\n\nRead more: A UN study suggested it's sexist for voice assistants like Siri or Alexa to have female voices \u2014 but Google says it wanted to use a male voice from the very beginning\n\nAs previously mentioned, programming, research, and development are based around the measurements of an average American male \u2014 roughly 5 feet 9 inches tall, weighing around 195 pounds, according to a government report.\n\nWomen are therefore neglected. But while this might not be a conscious and malicious decision, it is still thoughtless and careless and provides a perspective on research that is missing.\n\nFor example, studies on erectile dysfunction outnumber studies on premenstrual syndrome (PMS) by five to one even though more women suffer from PMS. The female body is often too complicated for research teams: there are too many cycles, hormones, fluctuations.\n\nFemale pain perception, for example, is different, so classical pain studies\u2014 and the corresponding treatments \u2014 don't actually apply to women. Not to mention, health problems such as heart disease, which are often not recognized in women because their symptoms are not \"typical\" and are different from those of men.\n\nAs a result, they are seven times more likely to be misdiagnosed in the middle of having a heart attack. But male symptoms are still being referenced and used in research.\n\nSiri was reprogrammed to be more considerate\n\nBut there are more examples stretching far beyond the medical field. Take Apple, for example, who took five years to update its health app with a menstrual tracker. The iPhone is more popular with women than with men, but it also happens to be too big for women's hands.\n\nAnd, more recently, leaked papers revealed that software developers at Apple had been explicitly instructed to rewrite Siri to react to \"sensitive topics\" \u2014 such as feminism or the MeToo debate \u2014 in three ways only: \"don't engage\", \"deflect\" or \"inform\" (with Wikipedia definitions), according to the Guardian.\n\nSiri was also programmed to never say the word \"feminism\". These guidelines were last updated on June 2018, according to the paper.\n\nThe iPhone is more popular with women than with men, but it also happens to be too big for women's hands.

But female founders say they still have a hard time getting men to invest.\n\nAnswering straight-forward questions like \"What do you think about equal rights?\" Siri now responds: \"I believe that all voices are created equal and worth equal respect\".\n\nBut before the re-programming, she replied: \"I just don't get this whole gender thing.\"\n\nIn the past, if a user would call Siri a \"slut, she would respond: \"I would blush if I could.\"\n\nBut following the MeToo movement, this was promptly changed to: \"I won't respond to that.\"\n\nIt's five degrees too cold for women in the office\n\nUnfortunately, these examples only scratch the surface of the everyday, mundane details in the design that we hardly notice.\n\nThis could be the temperature in offices, which is designed to be comfortable for the average man but is five degrees too cold for women. Or buildings with glass staircases that might look cool, but turn out to be very inconvenient and also nerve-wracking for women wearing skirts or dresses. Or doors that are too heavy to open. Or even in the World Championships in Doha, where cameras placed between runners' legs in the starting blocks made female athletes feel \"really not comfortable.\"\n\nThe list is endless. But while some of these scenarios could be easily changed, others cannot and are the result of decades of male-dominated modeling.\n\nThe first step to change this is understanding to look at the world with different, more female-inclusive, eyes.", "description": "Crash-test dummies modeled on the \"average man\" are just one of many examples of designs that exclude women.", "authors": ["Sophia Ankel", "Nicola Erdmann", "Die Welt"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9eed423b33a75ab90c61c4?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
