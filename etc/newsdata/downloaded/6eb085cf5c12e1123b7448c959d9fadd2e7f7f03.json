In \u2018The Yellow House,\u2019 Sarah M. Broom wonders.", "language": "en", "published_at": "2019-08-29", "text": "\n\nSarah M. Broom, author of the memoir \u201cThe Yellow House.\u201d (Adam Shemper)\n\nHome. Those four letters teem with such meaning it\u2019s a miracle they don\u2019t collapse under the weight. Home can manifest in the intangible \u2014 a sound, a scent \u2014 or the concrete (four walls, the feel of your mother\u2019s hand, the spot on the sofa where you always find yourself sitting).\n\nHome can induce nostalgia, or anxiety. Like the curves of spines and the shapes of noses, home is, for each of us, a shade different.\n\nFor Sarah M. Broom, home is memory and history, recounted with rigor, candor and grace in her new memoir, \u201cThe Yellow House.\u201d The actual wooden structure after which the book is named is gone, a casualty of Hurricane Katrina.\n\n\u201cThe Yellow House was witness to our lives,\u201d Broom writes of the home where she and most of her 11 older siblings grew up. \u201cWhen it fell, something in me burst.\u201d\n\nBroom probes the history of her family and New Orleans East \u2014 a part of the city often missing from maps and history books, even though it\u2019s significantly larger than the French Quarter \u2014 before and after Katrina. Archival research and oral histories factor heavily in the work.\n\nRecently, Broom and I spoke about how and why she undertook this project, the necessity of writing frankly about family and her ongoing examination of what home means.\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nQ: The scope of your book is large. You tell the story of your family and New Orleans over several decades. You're not even born until about 100 pages in. Logistically, how did you approach this project?\n\nA: I had to map it out. Imagine an overlay: The bottom page is the yellow house, the street I lived on and New Orleans East. Then on top of that I put New Orleans history. And then on top of that I put American history, and then I had hundreds of hours of interviews.\n\nThe first thing I wrote was my grandmother as a character. She was immensely hard to write. I always had the feeling that my grandmother was the beginning of the story of myself. I don\u2019t believe when you\u2019re born the story starts; the story already started, all the chaos we have going on now our children will inherit.\n\nThis is an American story. My mother bought a house, she had a dream. Houses are supposed to pay off, earn you dividends, right? They\u2019re an investment in the American concept. So, what happens when your investment doesn\u2019t pay off?\n\nQ: You are the youngest of 12 in a family that, like all others, has its secrets and wounds. How did you give yourself permission to write this story?\n\nA: That was the chunk of the work actually, figuring out how to give myself permission to tell a history that in a lot of ways preceded me. I was also giving myself permission to \u201ctell on\u201d my family and \u201ctell on\u201d the city of New Orleans, which also has its secrets and its stories. Also, as a black woman writer, I was shoring myself up to write knowing that often black women are not actually listened to.\n\nThe thing that kept me going was that I was writing this story essentially for my family. I wanted there to be something that lasted. I wanted there to be a kind of narrative history that a child in New Orleans East could pull off the shelf. When I remembered that I was writing for my family, for my 50 nieces and nephews, and for the little girl growing up on the street where I grew up, I sat down and wrote.\n\nBut it still was hard. There are ways in which I wanted to protect family, but then I realized that the thing I wanted to protect them from would make the story hagiography. My quest in this book was to present a world as full, as nuanced, as layered, as textured as I possibly could \u2014 it was crucial that this not be a praise song to these flawless people.\n\nQ: There's a moment in the book I won't soon forget. Your sister Deborah wanted to go to college, but your father wanted her to work and help support the family. When she refused, you write, \"she was beat by Simon Sr. with a sugarcane.\" Later, when Deborah is about to get married at the family home, Simon Sr. wakes up early to cut the lawn before the ceremony, you write, he \"fixed his sadness outside.\" It's a nuanced, specific portrayal. Was it difficult to walk the line between protecting and exposing your father, since he died when you were an infant?\n\nA: In the case of my father, my goal was not to protect him. The person I thought most about was Deborah, because she told me the story. I asked her for permission.\n\nThere could be no story of the kind that I\u2019ve written without my family\u2019s permission to tell it. They\u2019re brave, courageous people. Also, they understand that, in a way, this story is bigger than them. In a way, I\u2019m discussing the complication of being, ancestrally speaking, from a group of people who couldn\u2019t write their stories, couldn\u2019t keep their stories, couldn\u2019t tell their stories, and the incredible importance of saying what exactly happened and not necessarily feeling shame.\n\nAs for Deborah, I don\u2019t think she is at all embarrassed by that story.\n\nQ: I don't think it's embarrassing, just vividly rendered. In 10 years, if someone asks me about \"The Yellow House,\" that moment will be one I remember.\n\nA: That was the goal. I was trying to write something where people were alive on the page, where when my father dies, you understand why that matters so much, because he was real for you. I was really trying to humanize these people in a way that they aren\u2019t humanized in the typically told story of New Orleans.\n\nQ: One last question. You and your partner live in New York; do you own a home there?\n\nA: I don\u2019t think I want to talk about that. We\u2019ve got to have something for ourselves.\n\nQ: I hear that. So you don't think I'm a total busybody that was my lead-up to ask how you feel about homeownership.\n\nA: I have a little place in New Orleans, too, which is tiny, but I own it. But yes, we\u2019re New York people. I\u2019ve thought a lot about this: If you don\u2019t own something, can you still feel tethered to it? I think the answer\u2019s yes. You might feel more tethered especially when you don\u2019t own. I think a lot, obviously, of land loss and land being taken from people historically in America.\n\nHome is even more a metaphor for me now than a real thing. It is the thing I\u2019m interrogating and trying to understand. What my work tries to explore is this: What is home, and how do you know when you\u2019re there?\n\nNneka McGuire is a multiplatform editor at The Lily, The Washington Post\u2019s website that focuses on the stories of women.", "description": "Broom\u2019s sweeping memoir pays homage to family and New Orleans.", "authors": ["Nneka Mcguire", "Multiplatform Editor", "September At Am", "Nneka Mcguire Is A Multiplatform Editor At The Lily.
