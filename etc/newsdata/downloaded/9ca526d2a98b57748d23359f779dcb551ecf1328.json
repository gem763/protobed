The company agreed not to pass along the $65 million to customers on their energy bills, according to ABC 10.\n\nThe commission uncovered 67 cases where crews struck underground lines while excavating, and concluded \u201cthe threat of physical and economic harm associated with each of the violations makes them severe,\u201d the San Francisco Chronicle reported, referencing the settlement document.\n\nThe company was also accused of failing to provide enough qualified workers to help flag electric cables, according to the Chronicle.\n\nJeff Chiu/AP, FILE\n\n\u201cThe events that took place were unacceptable,\u201d company officials told employees in a note obtained by ABC10. \u201cWe take responsibility for not living up to our commitment to accurate reporting and record-keeping in this case.\u201d PG&E also admitted to failing to address the problem between 2012 and 2017, despite concerns raised by many of its supervisors, according to ABC 10.\n\nAccording to the settlement agreement, every late inspection that the company made under its locate and mark program posed a potential safety hazard and improperly marking the work as being done on time kept the company from fixing the problem. California\u2019s Public Utilities Commission [CPUC] says failures in the notification system contributed to 67 cases where crews struck underground lines while excavating, although nobody died.\n\nThe company agreed to pay $5 million fine to the state and another $60 million to improve its locate-and-mark service. The settlement also requires PG&E to replace its software system, and increase its staffing and training.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
