The deeply strange and wonderful people at MONA have you covered.\n\nWith Mona Foma looming large on the calendar this coming January in the beautiful, Kingly city of Launceston in gorgeous Northern Tasmania (God\u2019s Country, for those of you keeping score at home), festival organisers are keen to get punters from the mainland milling about the city while acts like Flying Lotus 3D take the joint over.\n\nTo get that done, the festival is giving away an entire Boeing 737\u2019s worth of seats to one lucky punter and 149 of their mates. All you\u2019ve gotta do to be in the running is find the plane.\n\nThe Air Mofo plane has been hidden somewhere in Tasmania \u2013 or, at least, a virtual map of Tassie \u2013 thanks to a competition Mona Foma is set to throw open as of next week.\n\nThe gist of it is simple: at 9am on Thursday, October 10th, they\u2019ll be hiding a giant purple and gold Boeing 737 somewhere on a map of Tasmania. All you\u2019ve gotta do to win is be the first to find it. Straightforward, right?\n\nREAD MORE 10 Things To Do This January To Make You Feel Smarter / More Cultured\n\nMona Foma is already giving away a whole mess of clues as to where the hidden plane will be via the competition website, so you might want to start taking some notes and boning up on your Tassie geography. There\u2019s also gonna be clues on social media, in email mailouts, and on YouTube as well. So keep yr dang eyes peeled.\n\nThe grand prize is an entire plane \u2013 all 150 seats of it \u2013 departing from either Melbourne or Sydney that will fly you and literally all your friends to Launceston from the 17th till the 19th of January. Everyone on the plane gets a three-day Mona Foma pass, and probably a whole mess of god knows what on the flight down.\n\nYou\u2019ll quite obviously have to sort out 150 peoples\u2019 worth of accomodation yourself, but the flight alone clocks in at a staggering $99,000 worth of prize. Which is a fair chunk of change by anyone\u2019s estimation.\n\nLaunceston in summer. Mona Foma. You and 150 mates on a plane together.\n\nThe only thing you\u2019ve gotta figure out is who gets the exit rows.\n\nThe full 2020 Mona Foma program is being announced on October 18th.", "description": "Ahead of the 2020 Mona Foma, the festival is giving away an entire 150-seat flight for you and all your mates.
