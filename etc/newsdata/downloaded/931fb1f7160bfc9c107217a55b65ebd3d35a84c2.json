Thomas) by a lake, stalking a skunk with a stone.\n\nHe opens a door latch, and throws the now-dead animal to the floor in a room partially shrouded in darkness.\n\nSuddenly, SOMETHING emerges from the shadows as the sound distorts, and terrified, the boy leaves the room and re-latches the door in a hurry.\n\nWe then see Keri, who according to the film's IMDb synopsis is a 'small-town Oregon teacher,' lost in thought on a grey day \u2014 which are plentiful in horror films.\n\nCompelling choice: The most unique element of the clip is the sound, and the choice to forego any dialog until the very end; the film stars Jeremy T. Thomas\n\nShe's seated at a cafe and she locks eyes with the quiet boy as he passes by outside.\n\nSoon the ambient creeks, unpleasant gristling and other sounds acquiesce into a tempo of sorts, showing the little boy continue to hunt and scavenge for 'food' (or rather, dead and rotting animal carcasses) for his new 'friend' in the darkness.\n\nAfter an inevitable shot of a creepy doll (another plentiful element in horror movies), the worst happens \u2014 the unseen menace has escaped its enclave, leaving a bloody trail in its wake.\n\nYuck: Soon the ambient creeks, unpleasant gristling and other sounds acquiesce into a tempo of sorts, showing the little boy continue to hunt and scavenge for 'food' for his new 'friend'\n\nThe worst happens: The unseen menace escapes its enclave, leaving a bloody trail in its wake\n\nCut to a grisly murder scene, where Keri and Plemons' sheriff \u2014 Russell's character brother, according to the synopsis \u2014 survey the carnage.\n\nAnother officer holds up the title 'character' to the light \u2014 an antler.\n\nThe boy is seen again outside, in the woods with a friend, as they run in to the creature, or whatever it is, and as the tempo of eerie sounds builds to a crescendo, the police cock their guns, Keri pieces together a creepy child's doodle (another horror trope) and finally, finally, we have a glimpse of the menace: bloodied skin, rippling sinewy muscle, but human \u2013 or almost human, save for a horrific sharp-toothed grimace.\n\nThey've got this under control: Cut to a grisly murder scene, where Plemons' sheriff \u2014 Russell's character brother, according to the synopsis \u2014 surveys the carnage\n\nCreepy: An officer holds up the title 'character' to the light \u2014 an antler\n\nAnother horror trope: Keri pieces together a creepy child's doodle\n\nThen, as the horrific creature emerges in the darkness, the only word in the trailer is uttered, presumably by the little boy: 'Daddy?'\n\nWhile horror maestro del Toro (of Pan's Labyrinth and Cronos fame) co-produced, Antlers is directed by Scott Cooper \u2014 the acclaimed director of Crazy Heart, the 2009 film which won Jeff Bridges his Best Actor Oscar (and which scored costar Maggie Gyllenhaal a nod for Best Supporting Actress.\n\nBased on the story The Quiet Boy, by Nick Antosca and published on Guernica this past January, Antlers is due for release next April.\n\nDisgusting: The 'monster' has bloodied skin and rippling sinewy muscles\n\nStuff of nightmares: Antlers is based on the story The Quiet Boy, by Nick Antosca and published on Guernica this past January", "description": "Just in time for Halloween, a new trailer has surfaced for the terrifying film Antlers, co-produced by Guillermo del Toro and starring Keri Russell and Jesse Plemons.", "authors": ["Dan Heching For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/22/20103906-0-image-a-34_1571865428195.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
