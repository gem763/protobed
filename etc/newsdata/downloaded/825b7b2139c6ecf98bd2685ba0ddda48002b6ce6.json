Allen Brack said in an online post to the gaming community.\n\n\u201cI want to be clear: our relationships in China had no influence on our decision.\u201d\n\nBrack contended the player violated rules \u201che acknowledged and understood.\u201d\n\nThe company would have taken the same decision if the \u201copposing viewpoint (had been) delivered in the same divisive and deliberate way,\u201d he said.\n\nBlizzard became the target of a boycott by gamers and a walk-out by employees this week after it decided to deny Blitzchung $10,000 in prize money and ban him for a year.\n\n\u201cIn the tournament itself Blitzchung \u2018played\u2019 fair,\u201d Brack said.\n\n\u201cWe now believe he should receive his prize. But playing fair also includes appropriate pre-and post-match conduct, especially when a player accepts recognition for winning in a broadcast.\u201d\n\nHowever, a six-month suspension seemed more appropriate in retrospect, so Blitzchung will be allowed back in the Hearthstone pro circuit after that time, Brack said.\n\nHearthstone is a hugely popular online card game in which two opponents take turns to deploy different characters with different abilities to try to defeat each other.\n\n\u201cWe have these rules to keep the focus on the game and on the tournament to the benefit of a global audience, and that was the only consideration in the actions we took,\u201d Brack said.\n\nThe 21-year-old university student, who was wearing eye goggles and a gas mask \u2014 equipment frequently used by protesters in Hong Kong \u2014 pulled down his respirator to broadcast his message.\n\nThe online stream was cut off mid-interview shortly afterward and the video has since been taken down.\n\nNg told AFP he was not surprised at being kicked out of the competition, but said: \u201cI don\u2019t regret saying that stuff. And even now, I don\u2019t regret it at all.\u201d", "description": "San Francisco (AFP) \u2013 Gaming company Blizzard Entertainment said Friday China had nothing to do with its decision to punish an eSports champion who", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/11/ab302e_hearthstone-is-hugely-popular-online-card-game-in-two-opponents-deploy-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
