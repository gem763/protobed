He was a masterful politician, selected to be Gov. George W. Bush\u2019s second-in-command in 1998 under the misapprehension he would be pliable.\n\nIn a sense he was our Tito, as in Josip Broz, the dictator who ruled Yugoslavia from World War II to his death in 1980. Yugoslavia was a powder keg, a hopelessly complex patchwork held together by Tito. The Republican Party of Texas, too, was a patchwork. When it became truly dominant, it grew to encompass a variety of seemingly contradictory political tendencies: good-ol\u2019-boy rural conservatives, big-city chambers of commerce, fire-breathing evangelical warriors, white-shoe professionals, white-pride populists and a surprising number of nonwhite voters. On top of that, Texas encompasses a bewildering political environment that consists of five of the nation\u2019s 20 largest cities, each its own planet, and vast rural areas that have little in common with one another.\n\nHow do you keep that together? Just as Tito did: nationalism and flexible political principles. Republicans waved the Texas flag harder than Democrats did. Mr. Perry\u2019s first decade was taken up, in the true manner of an Eastern Bloc dictator, with expansive infrastructure projects \u2014 his own 10-year plan \u2014 until that became unpopular and he became a Tea Party guy. He could be pro-immigrant, a border hawk, a warrior for Christ, whatever you needed.\n\nHis long tenure froze the Republican hierarchy and the ambitions of its apparatchiks under him. When he left, the lieutenant governor and attorney general had all been in place for over a decade, and many of the state\u2019s Republican members of Congress were hardened vets, too (with the notable exception of Ted Cruz).\n\nThen Mr. Perry stepped down. The succession appeared to go flawlessly \u2014 but it was harder than ever to say what exactly the Republican Party of Texas was about. The new governor, Greg Abbott, didn\u2019t appear to want to do anything. Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, an eccentric suburban Christian soldier who unnerved many in his own party, immediately went to war with House Speaker Joe Straus, a moderate Jewish Republican from the leafier parts of San Antonio. Attorney General Ken Paxton was quickly indicted on a charge of felony securities fraud.", "description": "A wave of G.O.P.
