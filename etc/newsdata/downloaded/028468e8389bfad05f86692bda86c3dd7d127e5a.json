The prime minister is said to be furious at the claims by journalist Charlotte Edwardes that at a private lunch in 1999, Johnson touched her leg under a table, grabbing \u201cenough inner flesh beneath his fingers\u201d to make her \u201csit upright\u201d. Downing Street insiders privately described the claims as \u201cbollocks\u201d and \u201cnonsense\u201d. Edwardes tweeted on Sunday night: \u201cIf the prime minister doesn\u2019t recollect the incident then clearly I have a better memory than he does.\u201d Johnson also remains under pressure over his relationship with American tech entrepreneur Jennifer Arcuri, whose company received a public grant. Conference delegates, meanwhile, can expect plenty of references to the \u201csurrender act\u201d after the PM refused to moderate his language and repeated the phrase a dozen times on the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr programme yesterday.\n\nWhistleblower safety \u2013 Lawyers acting for the whistleblower at the centre of the impeachment scandal say President Trump\u2019s remarks are putting their client in danger. Andrew Bakaj said Trump\u2019s demands to know the identity of the whistleblower have led to safety concerns, and a $50,000 reward for information that would identify him or her. Bakaj has called on senior Democratic and Republican leaders to \u201cspeak out in favour of whistleblower protection\u201d. On Sunday night, Trump tweeted: \u201cI deserve to meet my accuser, especially when this accuser, the so-called \u2018Whistleblower\u2019, represented a perfect conversation with a foreign leader in a totally inaccurate and fraudulent way\u201d. He also quoted a Fox News guest who said \u201cremoving the President from office (which they will never be), it will cause a Civil War like fracture in this Nation from which our Country will never heal\u201d. It followed a weekend of Trump defenders, led by his lawyer Rudy Guiliani, attacking the unnamed whistleblower in an attempt to push back against the rapidly intensifying impeachment inquiry. Last week Trump compared the whistleblower to a spy.\n\nVocational training \u2013 The education secretary, Gavin Williamson, will announce plans today to launch a further eight institutes of technology, a collaboration between further education colleges, universities and employers to offer higher-level technical training. Williamson, who will announce the policy at the party conference, will say courses could become more popular than universities and that the new institutes of technology are intended to end the sector\u2019s image as a poor relation. They come on top of an additional \u00a3400m in funding for further education and sixth-form colleges announced at the end of last month.\n\nFar-right vote collapses \u2013 Austria\u2019s Freedom party has lost more than a third of its support, in elections in which it was punished over a corruption scandal that brought down the government. The former chancellor Sebastian Kurz, 33, looks certain to reclaim his position as the youngest leader in the world after his conservative People\u2019s party (\u00d6VP) secured 37.1% of the vote \u2013 its best result since 2002. The Freedom party\u2019s vote fell to 16%, while the Green party jumped to its best result at national elections with 14%. Kurz signalled on Sunday night that he was willing to enter coalition talks with both the Freedom party and the Green party.\n\nHeart attacks \u2013 Women are dying from heart attacks unnecessarily because of the mistaken perception that they mostly happen to men. Inequalities at every stage lead to women being diagnosed late and not getting the prompt treatment and aftercare they need to survive a heart attack, according to the British Heart Foundation. Research shows that more than 8,000 women died between 2002 and 2013 in England and Wales because they did not receive the same standard of care as men.\n\nAsleep at the wheel? \u2013 There are calls for truck drivers to be routinely tested for sleep apnoea after an Italian study found that half suffer from breathing disorders. The survey of 905 truck drivers found that approximately half suffered from at least one sleep-related breathing problem that could potentially cause them to fall asleep at the wheel. Researchers found that 77% were overweight or obese. According to Luca Roberti, president of the Italian sleep apnoea patient association, \u201cthis is due to a lifestyle that forces the drivers to sit for several hours a day, with little physical activity and a poor diet, leading to a greater risk of excessive daytime sleepiness and of dozing off unexpectedly while driving.\u201d\n\nToday in Focus podcast: Is it over for Justin Trudeau?\n\nJustin Trudeau achieved a historic victory in 2015 but as he nears the end of his first term a series of scandals are making his political future far less certain.

Over a lunch of chicken, rice and sweet honeyed fatteh, the unmistakable thud of a nearby missile shook the windows of a restaurant. The diners paid no attention to the whine of the Saudi warplane even as it circled back for a second, third and fourth hit.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mustafa al-Adel shows the place where his brother\u2019s body was found on 11 September 2019. Photograph: Achilleas Zavallis/Achilleas Zavallis for The Guardian\n\n\u201cBut the regional power\u2019s scorched earth policy in this proxy war has brought it no closer to victory. With Iran\u2019s help, the Houthi forces now possess sophisticated drone technology and can launch cross-border rocket attacks deep into Saudi Arabia, targeting assets such as oilfields, military bases and airports. Some call this the Kingdom\u2019s Vietnam, but it could be much, much worse. The victims are ordinary Yemenis, who are paying an extraordinary price.\u201d\n\nSport\n\nDina Asher-Smith was able to savour a stunning 100m personal best, a new national record of 10.83sec and, most of all, a sparkling silver medal after finishing behind the legendary Jamaican Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce at the World Athletics Championships in Doha. Australia\u2019s rugby vice-captain, Samu Kerevi, has called on authorities to bring in players to advise on the regulations covering the contact area, fearing that the game will cease to be a collision sport and become \u201csoft\u201d, after he was penalised in the game against Wales on Sunday. Beauden, Jordie and Scott Barrett will become the first trio of brothers to appear for the All Blacks in a World Cup match after they were named to start for the three-times world champions against Canada. Riyad Mahrez decorated Manchester City\u2019s victory against Everton on Saturday with a glittering display that left Pep Guardiola purring over his \u201cgift\u201d. And cycling\u2019s world time trial champion Rohan Dennis, who defended his crown just last week in Harrogate, has had his contract with race team Bahrain-Merida terminated with immediate effect.\n\nBusiness\n\nSir Philip Green\u2019s Miss Selfridge chain posted a \u00a317.5m loss last year as sales fell and it wrote down the value of loss-making stores. Sales at the youth fashion chain fell more than 15% to \u00a3102m in the year to 1 September 2018, while pretax losses more than quadrupled from \u00a34.3m a year before. Losses widened after more than \u00a312m in one-off costs mostly related to property writedowns were added, as well as redundancies.\n\nThe pound is buying $1.229 and \u20ac1.124.\n\nThe papers\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: The Guardian\n\nBoris Johnson remains front and centre on many of today\u2019s papers, with the Telegraph reporting a \u201cPlot to force Johnson into Brexit extension\u201d, in a story that claims opposition leaders will meet to see how they can force him into requesting an extension of Article 50. The Mirror says the PM\u2019s connection with US businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri is an \u201cabuse of power\u201d. The FT has \u201cDUP balks at Johnson plans\u201d. The Mail also carries a picture of Johnson with the headline: \u201cBoris\u2019s blonde \u2018told her friends they DID have an affair\u201d (but saves the most space for \u201cWomen driven to the brink by care crisis\u201d). The Guardian has \u201cPrime minister forced into denial of claims he groped two women\u201d, but it saves its splash for the devastating civil war in Yemen.\n\nThe Express gives Johnson some support before his party\u2019s conference: \u201cBoris rally cry: get Brexit done to fix divided Britain\u201d but leads on \u201cBumper rise for pensions\u201d. The Times ignores Johnson and and Brexit altogether and opts for \u201cChildren face ban from school if not vaccinated\u201d. The i also splashes on that story with \u201cCompulsory vaccinated targeted for UK children\u201d.\n\nAnd the Sun has splashed on an \u201cexclusive\u201d about the \u201cPurrminator\u201d, a \u201cmonster puss(cat)\u201d on the loose in Hampstead.\n\nSign up\n\nThe Guardian Morning Briefing is delivered to thousands of inboxes bright and early every weekday.
