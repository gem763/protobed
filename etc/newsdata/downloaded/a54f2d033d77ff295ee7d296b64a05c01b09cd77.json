Believe him?", "language": "en", "text": "Nobody has seen the \u201cBMF\u201d title belt, but Conor McGregor has?\n\nSure.\n\nSpeaking at a sponsor\u2019s event Tuesday in Kyiv, Ukraine, McGregor said not only has he seen the belt that will be awarded to the winner of Jorge Masvidal vs. Nate Diaz at UFC 244, there\u2019s more to it.\n\n\u201cI designed that \u2018Bad Motherf***er\u2019 belt,\u201d McGregor said. \u201cI actually designed that. I signed off on the design of how they are creating that belt.\u201d\n\nThat was McGregor speaking in literal terms before he continued more figuratively.\n\n\u201cSo most certainly that belt was brought into fruition, brought to life because of me: the real bad motherf***er,\u201d he added. \u201cSo most certainly one of those men is on my radar.\u201d\n\nOK, here are some thoughts on that:\n\n1. McGregor did not design that belt; let\u2019s just get that out of the way. UFC president Dana White just said last week that McGregor is no longer \u201cthe man.\u201d You think they let him design a \u201cBMF\u201d belt the UFC trademarked?\n\n2. Yeah, perhaps there was a time when McGregor could lay claim to being the baddest motherf***er in the game \u2013 and even then he tapped out to Diaz. Is that what BMFs do? Win a fight. Or better yet, just fight.\n\n3. Speaking of which, we\u2019d be happy if either Masvidal or a Diaz trilogy actually is on McGregor\u2019s radar. It\u2019s hard to know if McGregor will ever fight again \u2013 he\u2019s very rich, plus it probably would help to not be the subject of sexual assault investigations. But if McGregor does decide to fight again, trying to prove he\u2019s still a BMF against one of those gangsters would be the most intriguing thing McGregor could come back to.\n\nThe Blue Corner is MMA Junkie\u2019s blog space.
