The slime is made from spirulina extract, charcoal powder, and lime and lemon juice.\n\nThe lime slime is drizzled around the edge of the cup, with the main body of the drink featuring coconut milk, mango, and pineapple essence, all blended up into a black blizzard.\n\nNo unicorn Frappuccinos here (Picture: Starbucks)\n\nIf you\u2019d like to amp up the spooky spirit, you can also have a special coconut cream and charcoal powder mixture added to the top, to make the Frappuccino look like it\u2019s oozing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEagle-eyed punters may have noticed that the ingredients contain no dairy, and they\u2019d be right in thinking that the Phantom is totally vegan friendly. So, you can channel the underworld regardless of your moral position on animal products.\n\nAvailable for six days only, the #PhantomFrappuccino will be haunting UK stores from 26 October.\n\nPrices start at \u00a32.70, and you can tweet and Insta your creepy creations using the hashtag to let everyone know you\u2019ve tried it.\n\nWe\u2019re sure you\u2019re dying to. Mwahahaha.\n\nMORE: What I Rent: Adelaide, an 18-year-old mum paying \u00a3625 a month for a two-bedroom flat in Littlehampton\n\nMORE: The workouts you should be doing at each stage of your menstrual cycle\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "UK Starbucks fans rejoice, you can now get your hands on this spooky Frapp in time for Halloween.
