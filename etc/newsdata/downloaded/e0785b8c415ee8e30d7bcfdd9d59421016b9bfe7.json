Since he began consolidating power in 2015, he has marketed himself to domestic and international audiences as a force of modernity, touting an agenda of cultural liberalization and economic reform. In 2016, he outlined his would-be revolution with the release of \u201cSaudi Vision 2030,\u201d an ambitious plan to establish Saudi Arabia as a \u201cglobal investment powerhouse\u201d and \u201ca gateway to the world.\u201d\n\nThe development of a \u201csophisticated digital infrastructure\u201d is at the heart of Prince Mohammed\u2019s vision. And while many of his proposals remain unrealized \u2014 loftily promised futuristic cities have yet to materialize \u2014 the crown prince\u2019s obsession with technology has wrought some significant changes. He has overhauled numerous state agencies from the top down, establishing \u201ce-government solutions\u201d for services like court fees, charitable donations, health care and travel records. The slew of new e-portals are overseen by the newly created National Digitization Unit, a centralizing agency tasked with being a \u201cdisrupter\u201d of the status quo and an \u201cincubator\u201d for a modern information society.\n\nThe shift toward \u201ce-government\u201d has brought welcome efficiency to Saudi Arabia\u2019s sluggish public sector. The government boasts that Meras, an interface for starting businesses, has cut the wait time for some financial services from 81 days to 24 hours, while the Ministry of Interior\u2019s app Absher gives citizens access to 130 government procedures from their phones. With a population that is largely young (roughly 70 percent of Saudis are under 35) and tech-savvy (there are approximately 1.4 cellphones for every resident), Saudi Arabia is primed for such digitization. According to the government\u2019s own data, Absher alone logged over 20 million transactions between mid-2015 and August 2018.\n\nWhen using these apps, Saudis make a familiar trade-off: swapping access to their personal information and devices in exchange for convenience. But unlike, say, a customer of Amazon, a Saudi citizen often has little choice. Certain government fees, for example, are now payable only online, according to a Saudi journalist.", "description": "Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia says he wants to bring his country into the 21st century.
