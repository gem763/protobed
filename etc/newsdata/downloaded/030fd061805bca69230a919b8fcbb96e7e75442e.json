The electors then choose the president at the Electoral College.\n\nIn a split decision, the three-judge federal appeals panel said the Constitution allows electors to cast votes at their own discretion.\n\nThe panel ruled in the case of Colorado elector Michael Baca, who refused to vote for Democrat Hillary Clinton, the presidential winner in Colorado in 2016.\n\nBaca crossed out Clinton\u2019s name on his ballot and wrote in John Kasich, the Republican governor of Ohio, who also ran for president.\n\nThen-Secretary of State Wayne Williams removed Baca as an elector and replaced him with another who voted for Clinton.\n\nThe Denver court ruling applies to Colorado and five other states in the 10th Circuit: Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Utah and Wyoming.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Colorado officials said Wednesday they want the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn an appeals court ruling that presidential electors can vote for the candidate of their choice and aren't bound by the popular vote in their states.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/06/21/election_2020_trump_biden_19165_c0-97-2827-1746_s1200x700.jpg?083acd3dbdda336d6525ed3025c52ebcee3a8aab", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
