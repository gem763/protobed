Because I\u2019ve told you this before, but it\u2019s not about me. It\u2019s about we. It\u2019s about making sure that people all around have their voices heard and just like the 2016 election, that we show them that people\u2013 everyone\u2019s got a voice and we all should be able to participate in the process and system and have our voices heard.\n\nSpicer\u2019s advancement on the show last week bothered those on the left, many of whom expressed their dismay in angry social media posts. While the former White House Press Secretary is aware of their outrage, he tends to filter it out. The show is doing well despite the threat of boycotts, and \u201cclearly there\u2019s enough support for me,\u201d Spicer explained.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re over halfway through the show. We\u2019ve had four eliminations, I\u2019m still in the game. And that to me basically says that despite the loud voices on the left, there\u2019s clearly enough support throughout the country to keep this thing going,\u201d he said, adding that conservatives are sending a direct message to left-wing activists who push \u201ccancel culture\u201d:\n\nWhat frustrates them I think, is when they do shout out \u201cCancel this person out. Don\u2019t let them on. Don\u2019t let them succeed\u201d and then people vote. Because they don\u2019t get it. They don\u2019t understand where these votes coming from. \u201cWho are these people who don\u2019t agree with me or don\u2019t think like I do?\u201d\n\nSpicer said the phenomenon is \u201cactually the cool part\u201d of the entire experience. He hopes his presence is making some of the loud voices on the left realize that they cannot cancel out conservative thought.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s a great message to send. For all of those folks on the right\u2013 that we are equal participants and we cannot be canceled out,\u201d Spicer said.\n\n\u201cHopefully this is helping the overall movement and people realize\u2013 hey look you\u2019re an advertiser, if you\u2019re a show, there are a lot of active folks on the right that you should be paying attention to,\u201d he added.\n\nViewers can vote for Spicer and Lindsay Arnold Monday evening between 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. EST by texting SEAN to 21523 up to ten times and voting on ABC.com up to ten times.", "description": "Sean Spicer hopes his presence\u00a0on Dancing with the Stars is continuing to send a powerful message to members of the intolerant left.", "authors": ["Hannah Bleau"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Sean-Spicer-DWTS-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
