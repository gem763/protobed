So many choices, claims, and promises. The ideal ratio of 3 to 6 to 9? Disputed. The \u201cperfectly balanced\u201d dose? Depends. My advice? Just stick with your omega-3s.\n\nPerfect isn\u2019t there\n\nThe fatty acid \u201cteams\u201d\n\nEicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) produces chemicals that help reduce inflammation and symptoms of depression (1, 2).\n\nproduces chemicals that help reduce inflammation and symptoms of depression (1, 2).

Some say the ratio is 4 omega-6 to 1 omega-3. Others say 1-to-1 omega-3 to omega-6. Others say 2-to-1. It\u2019s all over the map. Let me share the basic science as simply as I can.Omegas 3, 6, and 9 all play different, specialized roles in our bodies. And each has a specialized team of component acids. The omega-3 team includes some super-skilled players:Working together, the omega-3 fatty acids do all of this invaluable health work:That\u2019s as impressive a shopping cart of benefits as you\u2019ll find anywhere. The trick is this\u2014our bodies can\u2019t do home-made omega-3s. Even our ancient great-great-great-great grandparents couldn\u2019t do that. We have to get omega-3 from our diet. Way back when, no problem\u2014there were no processed foods, only natural fruits, nuts, grains, and veggies. And any meat our ancestors ate fed on only\n\nSo what about omegas 6 and 9?\n\nSupporting brain function\n\nPromoting normal growth and development\n\nStimulating skin and hair growth\n\nMaintaining bone health\n\nRegulating metabolism\n\nMaintaining the reproductive system\n\nProducing energy\n\nOmega-6 overdose\n\nomega-3-rich grasses and other natural sources . Today? Forget it. The Standard American Diet (SAD, the perfect acronym) is rich in over-processed, over-salted, over-sugared, under-nutritious, non-foods\u2014and is hugely deficient in omega-3s. Imagine tossing all of those omega-3 benefits out the window. But that\u2019s how it is. Simply put, omega-3 deficiency leads to chronic inflammation and its terrible outcomes\u2014obesity, diabetes, heart disease, neurodegenerative disease\u2026the list goes on. I have just a few go-to supplements I recommend to all my patients. Omega-3 is one of them.The omega-6 team also contains different, specialized sub-acids. Working with the omega-3 team, many play a critical role in:Well done, omega-6s! But there\u2019s a catch. Some omega-6s promote inflammation\u2014preventing omega-3\u2019s incredibly important anti-inflammatory properties. And here\u2019s another key reason why I say no to omega-6 supplements.Just like omega-3, omega-6 fatty acids, can\u2019t be produced by our bodies. We get them from our diets. And guess what most Americans\u2019 diets already contain? Typically, 14 to 25 times more omega-6 fatty acids than omega-3 fatty acids. A full-on SAD can push that up to 50 to 1. Let there be a healthy, continuing difference of opinion as to the perfect ratio of omega 3 to omega 6. But let it be beyond dispute that 14 to 25 to 50 omega-6 to 1 omega-3 is dangerously over the top. In fact, it\u2019s highly likely that the omega-6 overdose plays a huge role in the nationwide epidemic of chronic inflammation. Let\u2019s let The Mediterranean Diet point the way, where the high end of the ratio is 4 omega-6 to 1 omega-3. Me, I\u2019d tighten the reins even more: the ideal ratio is 2\u20131.\n\nThe omega-9 team\n\nOleic acid , a fat found in olive oil, macadamia oil, poultry fat, and lard. Some suspect it\u2019s the fat responsible for olive oil\u2019s amazing powers, but it\u2019s not proven.\n\n, a fat found in olive oil, macadamia oil, poultry fat, and lard.

Other studies have found that people with high omega-9 diets had less inflammation and better insulin sensitivity than those who ate diets high in saturated fat These are important benefits. But we don\u2019t need to get them from supplements. Not only are they already the most abundant fats in our cells, but our bodies can produce all the omega-9 we need, unlike with omegas 3 and 6. And we can get it delivered from a healthy diet. That\u2019s why there\u2019s no recommended dosage. There\u2019s omega-9 a\u2019plenty already in us. No need to add more.First, I hope this explains why you don\u2019t need omega-6 or omega-9 supplements. If anything, you should look for ways to reduce your omega-6 and 9 intake\u2014especially if your diet looks anything like the SAD. Reducing omega-6s means limiting your consumption of vegetable oils other than olive oil, avocado oil, nut and seed oils and reducing or limiting fried foods that have been cooked in refined, processed vegetable oils\u2014the ubiquitous soybean oil, sunflower oil, corn oil, canola oil, cottonseed oil, safflower oil, and a few others. Second, you should be sure your omega-3 intake is at least 1,000 mg/day (make sure your supplement says 1,000 mg of omega-3 and not just 1,000 mg of oil). Talk that over with your doctors. Third, and it pains me to say it, if you depend on fish for your omega-3 intake, reduce that intake from my formerly recommended 3 servings/week, max, to 1 serving, max, of 3 ounces, max. This poor world\u2019s waters are so contaminated that there\u2019s always a serious risk of heavy metal and mercury toxins, no matter where the fish come from. Indeed, I test every patient for those contaminants. It\u2019s really quite horrifying that just about every one shows danger signals ranging from mild and tolerable, within limits, to high. I don\u2019t think many Americans could ever be assured of adequate omega-3 intake from oily fish alone. Following my recommended weekly serving limit will make it all but impossible. So leave omega-6 and omega-9 supplements on the pharmacy shelves. Let your supplement be omega-3s. You\u2019ll be taking good care.\n\nReferences", "description": "Should you be taking one of the popular omega-6 or .09/02/2019 3:23:40AM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/_townhall/resources/images/thog.png"}
