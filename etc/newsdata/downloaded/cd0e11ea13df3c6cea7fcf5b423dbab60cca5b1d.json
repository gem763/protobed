The Tuesday after Labor Day has become so infamous, it\u2019s earned its own hashtag: #TerribleTrafficTuesday.\n\nIt is, as the folks at AAA Mid-Atlantic put it, the beginning of the end of the late summertime lull on area roads. The kids are back in school; adults have returned to work.\n\nAccording to the authors of the latest Urban Mobility Report published by the Texas A&M Transportation Institute, the Washington region has the third worst traffic congestion in the nation.\n\nAnd sadly, it\u2019s all downhill after Tuesday.\n\n\u201cGridlock will worsen with each passing workday in September following Terrible Traffic Tuesday,\u201d said John Townsend, a spokesman for AAA Mid-Atlantic.\n\nAccording to the Texas A&M Transportation Institute, Townsend said, each Washington area commuter loses 102 hours a year to traffic congestion \u2014 that\u2019s up from 67 hours in 2013. That year, the region took the top spot as the most congested in the nation. It has since dropped to third behind Los Angeles and the San Francisco-Oakland area.\n\n\n\nTraffic crawls along the Capital Beltway during rush hour. (Jose Luis Magana/AP)\n\n[\u2018It\u2019s a waste of time\u2019 \u2014 Washington is No. 3 in traffic congestion]\n\nDrivers aren\u2019t the only ones who should plan ahead and prepare for crowded conditions post-Labor Day. The summerlong shutdown of six Blue and Yellow line Metro stations continues this week.\n\nMetro has provided shuttle service between the shuttered stations and the impact was somewhat lessened because the shutdown was scheduled during the summer, when the system is typically less busy. However, as passenger volumes return to normal this week, riders should be prepared for crowded stations and platforms and should add extra time to their commute.\n\nThe six stations south of Reagan National Airport \u2014 Braddock Road, King Street-Old Town, Eisenhower Avenue, Huntington, Van Dorn and Franconia-Springfield \u2014 which have been closed since late May for a massive platform rebuilding project, are scheduled to reopen Sept. 9.\n\n[Metro stations shuttered in summerlong shutdown will reopen on time, officials say]\n\nStill, the vast majority of Washington-area residents commute by car, and while traffic relief this summer might have seemed slight, the return of hundreds of thousands of schoolchildren, whether they are ferried by bus, harried parents or walk to school, will bring a noticeable change.\n\nMotorists are reminded to slow down \u2014 especially near school zones \u2014 and to watch for stopped buses. It is illegal to pass a stopped school bus that has its stop arm down, signaling that it is loading or unloading students.\n\n\u201cIt is imperative that everyone who shares the road to prepare himself or herself for back to school, whether the person is a student or not,\u201d said Leah Scully, traffic safety specialist for the AAA Mid-Atlantic Foundation for Safety and Education.\n\n\u201cArea drivers have had the roads to themselves since mid-June,\u201d Scully said in a statement. \u201cAs schools open across the Washington metro area, drivers must realize that their commute time may increase. Leaving home a little earlier in the mornings can help them get where they need to be on time and with less stress.\u201d\n\nAAA Mid-Atlantic says Maryland commuters will have it the worst Tuesday. According to the group\u2019s analysis of traffic data from the Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration, traffic volumes on key freeway segments across the region increased dramatically between 2012 and 2018.\n\nAccording to the group:\n\n\u2022Traffic volume on the Woodrow Wilson Bridge from Alexandria to exits along National Harbor increased by more than 36,000 vehicles day during that time frame. Traffic over the bridge was increasing even before the MGM casino opened, AAA Mid-Atlantic said.\n\n\u2022The segment of the Interstate 270 spur to Montrose Road generates 19,000 to 22,000 more vehicle trips per day than it did in 2012.\n\n\u2022The American Legion Bridge, one of the worst bottlenecks in the region, continues to worsen. Traffic across the bridge from the Virginia state line to the Clara Barton Parkway in Maryland increased by nearly 24,000 vehicles per day between 2012 and 2018.\n\nOfficials across the region are working on solutions. Virginia officials have signed an agreement to expand the 495 Express Lanes from the Dulles Toll Road interchange to the American Legion Bridge.\n\nMaryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) is also pushing a plan to add toll lanes to I-270. Though leaders in Montgomery County say relief is most needed on the northern portion of the highway, the Hogan administration has said it will seek private companies to build toll lanes on the lower portion first, in part because tolls from that section will help subsidize construction of the lanes north of I-270, which are expected to be less lucrative.\n\n[Hogan\u2019s plan prioritizes toll lanes on the lower part of I-270]\n\nOther officials are looking at strengthening the region\u2019s bus network to alleviate pressure on roadways.\n\nThere also are signs that the Intercounty Connector may be helping to reduce traffic volume on a portion of the Beltway between Montgomery and Prince George\u2019s counties.\n\nThe number of vehicles using one of the busiest sections in Prince George\u2019s County, from the Montgomery County line to Interstate 95, decreased from 265,905 vehicles daily on average in 2012 to 252,402 vehicles daily in 2018. AAA Mid-Atlantic officials said the decrease in traffic volume may be due to more commuters using the ICC, which parallels that section of the freeway. The ICC is the second most utilized toll road in Maryland.\n\nRead more:\n\nHundreds attend town hall on Hogan\u2019s plan to add toll lanes to I-270\n\nSix Blue and Yellow line Metro station will reopen on Sept. 9\n\nVirginia will expand 495 Express lanes to the American Legion Bridge\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "The post-Labor Day return to work and school marks a return to more congested roads.", "authors": ["Lori Aratani", "Reporter Focusing On Transportation Issues", "Including Airports", "Airlines", "The Nation'S Railroad", "Subway Systems", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/XyJm8eHX4bIEknZZ3IfY0_zg1u8=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/O2R7GMDGFII6TJUYFKHYBDE47M.jpg"}
