Novartis has said previously it was offering discounts to U.S. insurers on the condition they add Zolgensma to their policies to ensure quick authorisation.\n\n\"With respect to Zolgensma, you have to divide the total sales by the net pricing that we've achieved and also look at our U.S.-EU mix,\" Narasimhan told analysts on the call. \"We're in the range of 100 patients treated currently under the paid programme.\"\n\nNarasimhan also told reporters on Tuesday that insurers are seeking to tie payments to Zolgensma's long-term efficacy, but said he has seen no \"material uptake\" of five-year installment plans that Novartis has suggested to help soften the financial burden.\n\nNovartis declined to confirm the average per-patient cost figure based on revenue and patients treated.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by John Miller; Editing by Michael Shields)", "description": "Novartis sales data on Tuesday suggested the Swiss drugmaker is reaping less than the $2.1 million U.S. list price for its gene therapy Zolgensma, as insurers may be getting breaks on the world's most-expensive one-time treatment.
