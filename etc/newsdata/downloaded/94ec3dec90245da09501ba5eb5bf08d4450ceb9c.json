This is one of the last vestiges of the once enormous powers of the Prince Bishops of Durham.\n\nGranted extensive privileges by William the Conqueror, the bishops ruled County Durham like kings from the 11th century until 1836.\n\nClimb the new steel and larch Auckland Tower in the centre of Bishop Auckland and you can see the heart-stopping landscape left by the bishops. Ahead of you are the prickly Gothic spires of Auckland Castle \u2014 no longer lived in by the Bishop, but partly used for his office \u2014 hence the parking space.\n\nMedieval marvel: Auckland Castle is set to reopen to the public after a \u00a3150 million refurbishment\n\nWrapped round the castle are the River Wear and rolling hills of the 200-acre deer park, created as a private hunting ground for the prince bishops, and now a public park, complete with the bishops\u2019 fishponds, an 18th-century bridge, an ice house and stone pyramid.\n\nNext Saturday, Auckland Castle reopens after a \u00a3150 million refurbishment that has revived not just the castle, but the whole pocket town of Bishop Auckland.\n\nThe castle is in a splendid mishmash of styles: from the 12th-century chapel (the largest private chapel in Europe), to the wedding-cake Gothic of the 18th century. How different the castle and town are from seven years ago.\n\nIn 2012, the Church of England wanted to sell the castle\u2019s greatest treasures: the Biblical paintings of Jacob And His Twelve Sons, by the Spanish master Francisco de Zurbaran, which had been in the castle since 1756.\n\nJust when this collection was about to go under the hammer, enter Bishop Auckland\u2019s fairy godfather, former investment banker, Jonathan Ruffer.\n\nIn 2013, he gave \u00a315 million to buy those fabulous pictures \u2014 and Auckland Castle itself.\n\nFrancisco de Zurbaran\u2019s paintings in the castle\u2019s long dining room\n\nLook down from Auckland Tower and you\u2019ll see the new Mining Art Gallery \u2014 the only gallery of its kind in the country \u2014 with 420 works by local artists, many miners, including Tom McGuinness and Norman Cornish. Opposite the Mining Art Gallery there will soon be a Spanish Gallery, housing 17th-century masters from Ruffer\u2019s collection in a converted bank. It will be the only gallery in Britain dedicated to Spanish art.\n\nArt history scholars from Durham University are housed in the castle\u2019s Elizabethan lodge. A Faith Museum (Ruffer is a devout Christian) will open next to the castle in 2020.\n\nIn the south-facing walled garden \u2014 where some of Britain\u2019s first pineapples were grown in the 17th century \u2014 there will be a walled garden and restaurant.\n\nIn 2016, Ruffer set up Kynren \u2014 An Epic Tale of England, a live outdoor show recreating English history and legend, from the Roman conquest and King Arthur\u2019s quest for the Holy Grail, to Churchill\u2019s wartime leadership.\n\nStill, Bishop Auckland is now so full of life \u2014 artistic, architectural, theatrical \u2014 you need never leave the town and castle to enjoy the full spoils of a medieval Prince-Bishop\u2019s existence.", "description": "Auckland Castle in the town of Bishop Auckland is set to reopen to the public  after a \u00a3150 million refurbishment.
