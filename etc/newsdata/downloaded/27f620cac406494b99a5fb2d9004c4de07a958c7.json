But literally, absolutely nothing has been offered to me, or pressured on me, nothing.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Maximum impact \u2013\n\nEngels added he suspected the ban was deliberately announced by the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) during the World Championships for maximum impact.\n\n\u201cThey kept moving (the announcement) back and moving it back, strategically placing it in the middle of the worlds so it would upset all of Alberto\u2019s athletes,\u201d said Engels.\n\n\u201cKind of messed up on their part but I understand they were trying to make an impact.\u201d\n\nEngels is concerned the revelations will damage the reputation of innocent athletes who train with the Oregon Project.\n\n\u201cIt just sucks because the Oregon Project is a little bit more tarnished,\u201d he said. \u201cIt puts a bad name on everyone.\u201d\n\nEngels revealed he had quizzed his coach, Julian, about reports linking Salazar to illegal practices before he signed.\n\n\u201cWhen I joined the group I asked about all the stuff going on and Pete said there was nothing to worry about,\u201d Engels said.\n\n\u201cI fully trust Pete. I always have, he\u2019s been a great coach, a great leader and a great example.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile one of the Oregon Project\u2019s most forthright critics, Engels\u2019 USA team-mate Jenny Simpson, said Salazar\u2019s downfall should be cause for celebration.\n\n\u201cI think certainly everyone should take really seriously what\u2019s going on with the Salazar group, and what\u2019s going on with him,\u201d Simpson told reporters after winning her 1,500m semi-final to set up a showdown with Hassan in the final.\n\n\u201cFor a long time people talked about some dark shadow, some cloud. I\u2019m not talking about a cloud anymore, we have a conviction. That makes the situation really different.\u201d", "description": "Doha (AFP) \u2013 Alberto Salazar is banned but the disgraced coach continues to cast a shadow over the World Championships.
