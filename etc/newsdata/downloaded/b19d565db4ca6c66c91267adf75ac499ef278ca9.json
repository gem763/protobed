Not all may be running on Macbooks, but those who are will most likely be interested in giving Firefox another go in the coming months, knowing the browser won't eat away at their battery at a much faster pace than Chrome or Safari.\n\nPer a Bugzilla entry, at the technical level, Mozilla engineers managed to cut down Firefox's power consumption by switching browser page rendering operations to Core Animation, the graphics rendering and animation engine that's built into both iOS and macOS.", "description": "Two years after Firefox Quantum's release, Mozilla devs said they fixed Firefox's battery-draining problem.", "authors": ["Catalin Cimpanu"], "top_image": "https://zdnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/06/10/8d0199ef-c02f-45ab-95c8-1e6d344613c9/thumbnail/770x578/a1dc039a33750e048f27d77d5cbaacf9/firefox.png"}
