However, she notes that in order to retain and attract talent they need to offer a good salary, sociable working hours and training.\n\nNevertheless, Eos co-founder Ms Brereton thinks her firm will be able to attract people from the big four who are looking for a change.\n\n\"We are interviewing every day,\" she told the BBC, adding that they already had a list of potential clients who want to work with the new firm, which began trading this week.\n\nMs Brereton and Ms Kjaer resigned from KPMG in February over the firm's response to allegations of bullying.\n\nIn a statement, KPMG said: \"KPMG has a strong, inclusive culture, evidenced by consistently high employee engagement scores, good retention rates and numerous awards for our role as a top employer.\n\n\"We are proud of the contribution our people make to the UK.\"\n\nDo you work long hours?
