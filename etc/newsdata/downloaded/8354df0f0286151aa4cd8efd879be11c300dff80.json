About two dozen other California cities have banned flavored vapes, and states and communities across the country are following suit as the Trump administration moves to take the products off the market.\n\nJuul already has spent more than $4.5 million trying to convince voters to overturn San Francisco\u2019s first-in-the-nation e-cigarette ban with a November ballot initiative. It\u2019s working on a repeal effort of a similar measure in a smaller nearby city.\n\nIf San Francisco\u2019s broad ban prevails at the ballot box, it will likely encourage more cities and states to take bold measures. Just last week, a third California city voted to end all e-cigarette sales.\n\n\u201cThis is not just crazy San Francisco saying that e-cigarettes are bad for folks, particularly bad for our young people,\u201d said city Supervisor Shamann Walton, who wrote the city ordinance that banned e-cigarettes. \u201cWe need to do everything that we can to keep them out of the hands of our youth here in San Francisco and continue work to make sure that happens across the state and across the country.\u201d\n\nCalifornia Playbook newsletter Our must-read briefing on politics and government in the Golden State.

Morning Consult reported Monday that the share of Americans who view Juul unfavorably is more than five times higher than it was in July 2018. Of the 1,900 brands tracked, Juul is now second to last in popularity. Only Marlboro is worse.\n\nMatthew Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, said he sees flavor bans, rather than all-out prohibitions, as the primary way state and local governments will push the federal government for decisive action. But if that doesn't happen, all bets may be off, particularly given public concern over the recent vaping-related illness.\n\n\"There has been growing moment for the need for strong government action, both to curtail the explosion in youth use and to get to bottom of the recent serious illnesses,\" Myers said. \"Unless cities and states see a real change, then they're going to continue to look for solutions that protect their citizens.\"\n\nAfter President Donald Trump\u2019s announcement at the White House last week, FDA officials told lawmakers that the agency will issue rules within weeks, giving e-cigarette makers 30 days to pull flavored products off the market or face fines. Only products that receive FDA approval would be allowed back on the market after agency review.\n\nThe CDC on Monday activated its emergency operations center to bolster the interagency response to the mysterious lung illness linked to vaping.\n\nMuch of the anti-vaping action has been driven by local governments with some 30 cities nationwide \u2014 including 22 in California \u2014 already enacting comprehensive flavor restrictions, including products that contain menthol. More than 200 jurisdictions around the country now enforce some form of restrictions around e-cigarettes to address youth vaping.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom on Monday announced an executive order that calls for steps to reduce youth access to vaping products and a $20 million public health education campaign about tobacco and cannabis. But he stopped short of calling for a ban on flavored tobacco products.\n\nSan Francisco was the first major city to adopt a comprehensive flavor ban in 2017, and city voters last year overwhelmingly rejected a nearly $12 million tobacco industry-funded ballot measure seeking its repeal.\n\nThen the city supervisors went beyond the flavored ban, making history in June by passing the most restrictive e-cigarette measure in the country. It would suspend sales of all vaping products until they undergo review by the FDA, a process that could take years.\n\nJuul quickly funded a successful drive to put an initiative, Proposition C, on the city\u2019s November ballot that seeks to overturn the ban and replace it with a set of sales restrictions the company supports.\n\nGetty Images\n\nFor Juul, flavor restrictions may be tough enough \u2014 the company said it already shifted the sales of its \u201cnon-traditional\u201d flavors out of retail locations \u2014 but full sales prohibitions take it to another level.\n\nKwong, the Juul spokesperson, said the company was \u201cdisappointed\u201d the two other Bay Area cities \u2014 Livermore and Richmond \u2014 \u201ctook the same path\u201d as San Francisco, instead of focusing on \u201cthe opportunity to enact tough and effective regulation that will prevent youth access.\u201d\n\nJuul\u2019s strategy is to work with municipalities to avoid banning any products, preferring to push for stricter point-of-sales regulations. The company points to new electronic systems that make it harder for e-cigarettes to be sold illegally to minors and limit the amount people can purchase. Company officials said they\u2019ve already installed 50 at outlets in San Francisco and about five in Livermore, in addition to updating thousands of systems around the country.\n\nThe company is also emphasizing the products as a way to help adult smokers transition from traditional cigarettes, an approach that some public health experts support but remains controversial. Two days before Trump\u2019s flavor ban was announced, the FDA warned Juul against marketing its vapes as much safer than tobacco products without agency approval to do so.\n\nIf all else fails, Juul will likely consider legal action against the cities that ban their products, according to a source close to the company.\n\nWhile the sales prohibitions remain limited to the Bay Area, Trump\u2019s move and the spurt of action by other communities is creating a far more difficult environment for the vaping industry. That makes the outcome of San Francisco\u2019s ballot measure even more critical.\n\n\u201cThis movement is real from a grassroots perspective because parents are feeling it in every community,\u201d said Larry Tramutola, a political strategist running a campaign against Juul\u2019s ballot measure. \u201cLocal jurisdictions are trying to find solutions to these problems, and I think Juul has been a little caught off guard.\u201d\n\nRichmond Mayor Tom Butt, whose city approved a comprehensive ban on e-cigarette sales, said the fate of the San Francisco ballot measure may determine whether more cities follow this path. And he said he's not surprised that the movement against all e-cigarette sales has started in the region.\n\n\"California is generally in the front of the rest of country, and the Bay Area is out in front of California,\" he said.", "description": "The industry leader is fighting to overturn San Francisco\u2019s ban on all e-cigs through a November ballot initiative \u2014 and other cities are watching.", "authors": ["Victoria Colliver"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/d0/50/23e5fcce4d7fa9e3e2b1f993dba9/190916-gavin-newsom-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
