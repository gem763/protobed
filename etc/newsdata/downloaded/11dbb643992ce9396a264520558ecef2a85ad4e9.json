Michael Bennet announced that he raised $2.1 million in the third quarter of the year, an amount on the low end of the Democratic presidential field so far.\n\nThe number is a dip for Bennet from the second quarter, when he raised about $2.8 million. Bennet's campaign said he ended September with $1.8 million cash on hand, meaning he spent more than he raised in the previous three months. Bennet reported having close to $2.2 million in the bank at the end of the second quarter.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\"Our strategy to run a lean, strong campaign in early states is working, and we have the resources to compete and win. We\u2019re continuing to run TV, rural radio, and digital ads and build out our infrastructure and staff,\u201d Shannon Beckham, a spokeswoman for Bennet, said in a statement. \u201cInstead of allowing the DNC\u2019s flawed debate criteria to dictate this race, we\u2019re communicating directly with voters and caucusgoers. ... Michael spent more time in Iowa in September than any other candidate, and we believe it will pay off in the long run.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/dd/ff/2c319d934e45bcd19ea2daec5dbd/191002-michael-bennet-gty-773.jpg"}
