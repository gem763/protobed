His body was found on Thursday.\n\nThe Taliban have not immediately commented on the killing, which rights group Amnesty International condemned as a \u201cwar crime\u201d.\n\n\u201cEven as the Taliban claims to be pursuing peace, it continues to kill people in the most gruesome way,\u201d Samira Hamidi, its South Asia researcher, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThis tragedy underscores the grave dangers that human rights defenders in Afghanistan face.\u201d\n\nThe Taliban control or influence roughly half of Afghanistan and are said to be at their strongest since the United States invaded in 2001 and overthrew their government.\n\nInsurgent groups continue to negotiate with the United States and have demanded that all foreign forces leave.\n\nThe United States ended its combat role in 2014, although 20,000 U.S. and NATO forces remain. They still train and support Afghan troops fighting the Taliban who fear being left vulnerable if the United States leaves.", "description": "Taliban militants launched a major attack in Afghanistan's western province of Farah on Friday, the latest in a series of assaults on provincial centres just a day after a deadly suicide bombing in Kabul, officials said.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
